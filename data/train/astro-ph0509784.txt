    "the reionization of the cosmic neutral hydrogen , left over from the big bang , was an intrinsically inhomogeneous process @xcite .",
    "the basic cause of this inhomogeneity is modulation by large scale structure of the formation process of the ionizing sources .",
    "the scatter in the local matter density produces corresponding scatter in physical observables during the epoch of reionization .",
    "in particular , modulation of the formation of the first sources by large scale density modes will introduce scatter into the redshift at which reionization is completed in different regions due to the scatter in local matter density @xcite .",
    "this implies that the redshift of reionization is not a single number that is universally applicable to all regions of the universe , but rather follows a distribution which strongly depends on the physical size of the region under consideration @xcite . by a fixed redshift , different regions of a given size",
    "expand and cool by different amounts since they were reheated by reionization at different times .",
    "inhomogeneous reionization leaves scars on the igm in the form of a scale - dependent distribution of temperatures and densities .",
    "the fluctuations in the igm temperature affect galaxy formation by increasing the minimum mass of a dark matter halo that would accrete gas from the photo - heated igm @xcite .",
    "since the temperature fluctuations are scale dependent , the variance of the distribution of galaxies will also be strongly scale dependent .",
    "this will strongly influence the power spectrum of fluctuations in the galaxy distribution and alter its shape relative to the underlying power spectrum of the dark matter .",
    "previous treatments of the reheating feedback @xcite assumed that the photo - heating of the igm and the corresponding suppression of galaxy formation was uniform . in this paper",
    "we explore the implications of the non - uniformity of this process .",
    "future observations of the high redshift galaxy power spectrum , @xmath1 , may be used to constrain cosmological parameters .",
    "since the scale at which the dark matter power spectrum becomes non - linear is smaller at high redshift , the high - redshift galaxy surveys would be able to probe smaller scales ( i.e. modes with a higher wavenumber @xmath2 ) than their low - redshift counterparts such as _ sdss _ or _",
    "2df_. the combination of the small scale data along with low redshift galaxy surveys and cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) measurements , may significantly improve our ability to constrain inflationary parameters .",
    "this is particularly true for the spectral index @xmath3 , and the running of the spectral index @xmath4 , since the small scale observations increases the range of @xmath2modes over which these inflationary parameters can be constrained .",
    "the _ cosmic inflation probe _ ( _ cip _ ) is a proposed mission to undertake such a high redshift galaxy redshift survey @xcite . _",
    "cip _ is designed to be a space - based large area galaxy redshift survey between @xmath5 m and @xmath6 m , that would observe @xmath7 galaxies in h@xmath8 emission within the redshift interval @xmath9 to @xmath10 .",
    "in such a survey , the galaxy power spectrum could be determined to an exquisite precision of @xmath11 over the wavenumber interval of @xmath12 to @xmath13 comoving @xmath14 . assuming linear bias these observations",
    "could potentially constrain the spectral index to better than @xmath15 .",
    "however , we will show in this paper that the corrections to the galaxy power spectrum imprinted by the scale dependent fluctuations of the igm temperature after reionization are far greater than the existing uncertainties in the inflationary parameters .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in ",
    "2 we discuss the manner by which large scale modes would introduce scatter into the redshift of reionization , and how this will impact galaxy formation . in ",
    "3 we present numerical results for the imprint of fluctuations in the igm temperature on the galaxy power spectrum . finally ,  4 summarizes our main conclusions .",
    "we adopt the standard @xmath16cdm cosmological model consistent with the _ wmap _ data @xcite , with the parameters @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "all distances and wavenumbers throughout the paper are in comoving coordinates .",
    "as discussed in  1 , the process of reionization was inhomogeneous due to the modulation of structure formation by large scale density modes .",
    "the associated fluctuations in the redshift of reionization produced corresponding fluctuations in the temperature and density of the photo - ionized igm .",
    "since different regions were reionized at different times , they cool by different amounts and therefore obtain a distribution of temperatures at any redshift slice of the universe .",
    "we will assume that all reionizing sources had the same spectrum and therefore photo - heated the local igm to the same temperature .",
    "it is the distribution of reionization redshifts , not the scatter in the photo - heated temperatures , that is assumed to produce the distribution in igm temperatures in our formulation is far greater than the uncertainty associated with the inflationary initial conditions .",
    "] this temperature distribution produces scatter in physical observables in the igm , such as the galaxy formation rate .",
    "any region of size @xmath23 in the universe has a probability distribution for its local matter density which will change the redshift at which the collapsed fraction of matter in the region exceeds some threshold and makes the region reionized @xcite .",
    "this threshold is determined by the astrophysics of the problem , such as the star formation efficiency , the radiation spectrum , the escape fraction of ionizing photons from galaxies , as well as the clumping factor of the high redshift igm @xcite .",
    "however , given the redshift of reionization ) region will be ionized .",
    "we assume that voids ( @xmath24 ) are ionized by nearby overdense regions at @xmath25 ( so this is not the average but rather the completion redshift of reionization ) . ] , @xmath25 , @xcite showed that fluctuations around this redshift are independent of these astrophysical complications .",
    "the large - scale polarization anisotropies of the cmb @xcite and the scale of the ionized regions around quasars at @xmath26 @xcite indicate that the redshift of reionization is most likely between @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "long wavelength density fluctuations contribute to the background density and alter the rate of evolution within a region with respect to the background .",
    "this implies that the time at which the collapsed fraction of the perturbed region reaches a reionization threshold will be randomly shifted with respect to the time at which an unperturbed region reaches the threshold @xcite . the collapsed fraction in the modulated region",
    "can be equated to the collapsed fraction in an unperturbed region by shifting the redshift of the perturbed region by @xmath29 , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the overdensity of the region under consideration of radius @xmath23 and @xmath32 is the collapse threshold at redshift @xmath33 .",
    "the mass variance , namely the root - mean - square fluctuation in mass of regions of size @xmath23 , is defined as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the fourier transform of the window function . we adopt a top - hat window function in real space of radius @xmath23 with the fourier transform @xmath36    there is a minimum mass of dark matter halos into which the cosmic gas can collapse , dissipate , fragment and eventually form stars @xcite .",
    "in fact there are two independent minimum masses : _",
    "( i ) _ the jeans mass , which delineates the mass scale when gravitational forces exceed baryonic pressure support ; _ ( ii ) _ the cooling mass , below which the gas cooling time is longer than the halo dynamical time and fragmentation into stars is not possible .",
    "depending on the thermal state of the igm , either mass scale will determine the minimum galaxy mass .",
    "in the pre - reionization universe , where the igm is extremely cold and the minimum mass is set by the requirement that the cooling time be less than the dynamic time .",
    "while the original reionizing sources can be formed through dissipation and fragmentation caused by h@xmath37 cooling , feedback effects may have photodissociated much of the h@xmath37 in the universe and required future dissipation and fragmentation to proceed by atomic hydrogen line cooling @xcite .",
    "the minimum virial temperature for atomic hydrogen cooling is @xmath38 k , this consideration sets the minimum virial radius , @xmath39 , in equation ( [ collapsed ] ) .",
    "once the igm is reionized and photo - heated to a characteristic temperature of @xmath40 k , the jeans mass will exceed the cooling mass .",
    "in fact , we will see in the next section that the jeans mass is replaced by the filtering mass , which incorporates the entire igm thermal history .",
    "nevertheless , we will assume that the initial minimum scale for ionizing sources is given by the requirement that the halo can through atomic hydrogen line transitions .",
    "equating the arguments in equation ( [ collapsed ] ) , we can solve for the fluctuation in the reionization redshift @xcite @xmath41,\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is approximately constant at high - redshift . since @xmath31 is a random variable drawn out of a gaussian probability distribution with zero mean and variance @xmath43",
    ", @xmath29 is also a random variable .",
    "the relation between @xmath31 and @xmath29 is a linear transformation , and so the distribution of @xmath29 is gaussian , with a different variance . in this paper",
    "we will use monte - carlo sampling to calculate the distribution of physical quantities , such as reionization redshift , gas temperature and fluctuations in the galaxy number density . throughout the paper",
    "we ensure that our mass density fluctuations are always physical ( @xmath44 ) and uncollapsed ( @xmath45 ) by discarding regions that violate either of these conditions .",
    "we also assume that voids , regions with @xmath46 , will be photo - ionized by neighboring overdense regions ; and so all voids will be reionized at @xmath25 .",
    "figure [ dz ] shows the standard deviation of the fluctuations in the redshift of reionization as a function of region size .",
    "as the size of a region increases the scatter in reionization redshift fluctuations decreases . on scale @xmath47 mpc the fluctuations in the redshift of reionization become substantial .",
    "the baryons traced the temperature of the cmb with @xmath48 until they thermally decoupled from it at @xmath49 @xcite , after which they cooled adiabatically with @xmath50 until the first galaxies formed .",
    "these galaxies produced photons above the lyman limit ( @xmath51 ev ) that ionized and photo - heated the igm to a temperature set by the slope of their ionizing spectrum .",
    "if stars were the dominant source of reionization , then the igm was heated to a temperature @xmath52@xmath53 k ( with the precise value depending on the initial mass function of stars ) . after being",
    "reionized the gas cooled predominantly due to adiabatic cooling through its hubble expansion , but at high redshift ( @xmath54 ) the evolution of the gas temperature was also determined by compton cooling off the cmb and photo - ionization heating @xcite . in overdense regions , the gas eventually experienced adiabatic heating as it broke away from the hubble flow and condensed under the local gravitational pull .",
    "this effect will modify our results only on the smallest scales .",
    "even though filaments and pancakes may form at these high redshifts , the structures are typically not virialized .",
    "one ( or two ) dimensions may collapse early but other directions still expand and so the filamentary gas experiences both adiabatic heating and cooling @xcite . numerical simulations of the intergalactic medium indicate that our approximate treatment holds for most of the gas mass ( see e.g. , fig . 1 and top left panel of fig . 2 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in our simplified treatment , we assume instantaneous reionization of hydrogen and ignore reionization of helium .",
    "gradual photo - ionization of hydrogen would keep the igm at a high temperature for a longer period of time before cooling processes begin to work .",
    "we nevertheless include recombinations of the ionized igm and the heat input from subsequent photo - ionizations .",
    "if reionization occured at a similar redshift as , it will heat the igm to a somewhat higher temperature ; however , the temperature of the reionized igm is uncertain by an even larger factor due to the unknown spectrum of the ionizing radiation .",
    "reionization is expected to heat the igm at a lower redshift , @xmath55@xmath56 ( zheng et al . 2004 ; theuns et al .",
    "2002 ) , for which the characteristic mass scale , @xmath57 . ] , above which the abundance of dark matter halos is exponentially suppressed , is higher than the mass scale affected by the high igm temperature .",
    "these circumstances reduce the influence of reionization on the galaxy power - spectrum at low redshifts .",
    "figure [ temp ] shows the redshift evolution of the igm temperature for several reionization redshift : @xmath58 ( purple , dot - dashed ) , @xmath59 ( red , dotted ) , @xmath60 ( blue , dashed ) , @xmath61 ( green , long dashed ) and the universal evolutionary track ( black , solid ) .",
    "when reionization occurred early , the igm temperature quickly approached a common evolutionary track ; this effect is evident in figure [ temp ] . at high redshifts",
    "the timescale for photo - heating and compton cooling is shorter than the age of the universe , so the balance between these physical processes determines the common evolutionary track .",
    "if reionization occurred early enough , the @xmath62 igm temperature will not be sensitive to fluctuation around @xmath25 .",
    "since reionization was inhomogeneous , there is a probability distribution of possible igm temperatures for any region of scale @xmath23 in the universe .",
    "the actual igm temperature of a region regulates the formation of galaxies in it .",
    "first , the gravitational force of the galaxy halo must be able to overcome the baryon pressure resisting collapse .",
    "these considerations determine the jeans mass , namely the minimum halo mass into which the igm gas may assemble .",
    "second , the gas that collapses into a galaxy must be able to cool and dissipate in order to fragment and form stars , and so the cooling time of the gas must be shorter than the dynamical time of the halo . in the absence of molecules",
    ", this implies that the virial temperature of the host galaxy must be greater than @xmath38 k , so that atomic line cooling will be efficient .",
    "the naive jeans mass overestimates the effects of baryon pressure since the matter distribution can not instantaneously adjust to a new thermal and hydrodynamical state of the gas @xcite .",
    "the adjustment process occurs on the dynamical timescale of the halo . incorporating the associated delay results in a new effective scale , the _ filtering scale _ , which replaces the jeans scale and can be written in @xmath2-space as @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the scale factor and @xmath65 is the growth factor of linear density perturbations . the baryonic power spectrum , @xmath66 , which is strongly influenced by gas dynamics on small scales is then related to the dark matter power spectrum @xmath67 through @xcite @xmath68 the thermal state of the igm impacts structure formation through the suppression of small scale baryonic power and the corresponding increase in the minimum galaxy mass .",
    "prior to reionization the minimum mass was set by the cooling time requirement . in reionized regions of the universe the minimum mass is now set by the filter mass .",
    "figure [ masses ] shows the jeans mass ( solid , black ) and the filtering mass ( red , dotted ) at @xmath69 for several values of @xmath25 .",
    "the jeans mass initially decreases as the redshift of reionization increases .",
    "the wavenumber corresponding to the jeans length , @xmath70 increases for a fixed @xmath71 as the igm temperature decreases due to adiabatic cooling for small @xmath25 . for",
    "large @xmath25 the igm temperature approaches a universal temperature track and jeans mass becomes a constant because the igm temperature for a fixed @xmath72 is independent of @xmath25 .",
    "the behavior of the filtering mass is more complicated since the impact of the increased igm temperature on the halo mass distribution is delayed .",
    "when @xmath25 is close to @xmath72 the filtering mass can be significantly smaller than the jeans mass because of the afforementioned delay .",
    "this effect can be seen in figure [ masses ] for small @xmath25 .",
    "eventually the altered igm temperature is capable of affecting the halo mass distribution and the filtering mass rises with increasing @xmath25 .",
    "since the gas temperature approaches a universal evolutionary track , the filtering mass curve becomes shallow at high @xmath25 .",
    "however , the filtering scale depends on the thermal history and an earlier reionization implies that the igm had a high temperature ( @xmath73 k ) for a longer time .",
    "this causes the filtering mass to monotonically increase with increasing @xmath25 .    because the temperature of the igm is inhomogeneous , its effect on galaxy formation is scale dependent and",
    "so it alters the shape of the power spectrum for the distribution of galaxies .",
    "we calculate this effect through monte - carlo simulations of the process .",

    "the minimum halo mass can be linearized as @xmath95 where @xmath96 , @xmath97 is the average minimum halo mass , then the mass averaged linear bias will have the extra term @xmath98    for @xmath58 the fluctuations in the minimum mass will be anti - correlated with the standard lagrangian biasing effect since the minimum halo mass curve has a positive slope ( see fig .",
    "[ masses ] ) .",
    "physically this means that an overdense region which reionized earlier than average , will have a larger minimum halo mass because the halo mass distribution has had a longer amount of time to reflect the photo - heated igm gas pressure . if @xmath99 the effects of the fluctuation in the minimum halo mass will be weakly anti - correlated with the eulerian linear bias . in the case of early reionization",

    "the fluctuations in the redshift of reionization begin to be substantial ( see fig .",

    "the effects of radiative feedback on galaxy formation were assumed to be restricted to the small scales on which individual galaxies could impact the evolution of their neighbors .",
    "we have found that the radiative feedback produced by the process of reionization changes even the large scale ( @xmath105 mpc ) amplitude of the galaxy mass variance ( see fig .",
    "[ variance ] ) .",
    "the ionizing sources are highly clustered @xcite , so the regions during reionization are much larger than the volume that an individual galaxy could ionize .",

    "the effects of inhomogeneous reionization clearly dwarf the slight changes caused by varying the inflationary parameters .",

    "the imprint of reionization on the high redshift galaxy power spectrum is strong because we assumed that galaxies which reside in @xmath115 halos will be observed .",

    "however , galaxies which are only a few times more massive than @xmath115 are still assembled through mergers of lower mass galaxies and their luminosity should be significantly affected by a depletion in the star formation rate of their building blocks of mass @xmath115 .",
    "additionally , supernova feedback may deplete the progenitors of their baryonic gas , and then the inhibited gas accretion may significantly prevent any subsequent star formation in these halos ( e.g. dekel & silk 1986 ) . since the effect of reionization could be larger by orders of magnitude than the allowed range of variations due to uncertain inflationary parameters , it may not be practical to confine a search to sufficiently massive halos where the inflationary variations dominate .",

    "the distortion of the galaxy power spectrum may be used as a new probe of inhomogeneous reionization . even if a wide field survey like _ cip _ might not have the sensitivity to observe galaxies in halos as small as @xmath115 , the _ james webb space telescope _ ( jwst ) with @xmath116 nj sensitivity most certainly will . a deep exposure ( similar in concept but deeper than the hubble deep field ) of a field with dimensions of @xmath117",

    "the filtering scale differs from the jeans scale since it involves an average over the thermal history . immediately following the photo - heating of the igm , the filtering scale lags behind the jeans scale .",
    "the delay is displayed in figure [ masses ] , where the filtering mass rises initially rapidly and later more gradually as the redshift of reionization increases , while the jeans mass declines at first and then approaches a constant . if reionization occurred at @xmath58 , the overdense regions which reionize earlier would have a larger @xmath80 than average , reducing the number density of galaxies .",

    "<S> we consider the effects of inhomogeneous reionization on the distribution of galaxies at high redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> modulation of the formation process of the ionizing sources by large scale density modes makes reionization inhomogeneous and introduces a spread to the reionization times of different regions with the same size . after sources photo - ionize and heat these regions to a temperature @xmath0k at different times , </S>",
    "<S> their temperatures evolve as the ionized intergalactic medium ( igm ) expands . </S>",
    "<S> the varying igm temperature makes the minimum mass of galaxies spatially non - uniform with a fluctuation amplitude that increases towards small scales . </S>",
    "<S> these scale - dependent fluctuations modify the shape of the power spectrum of low - mass galaxies at high redshifts in a way that depends on the history of reionization . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting distortion of the primordial power spectrum is significantly larger than changes associated with uncertainties in the inflationary parameters , such as the spectral index of the scalar power spectrum or the running of the spectral index . </S>",
    "<S> future surveys of high - redshift galaxies will offer a new probe of the thermal history of the igm but might have a more limited scope in constraining inflation . </S>"
