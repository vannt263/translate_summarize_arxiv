    "dissipation , while generally seen as detrimental for quantum computers , can nevertheless be a useful resource if suitably engineered . appropriately chosen system - bath couplings can result in a non - equilibrium dynamics where initial states converge towards some dynamical steady state .",
    "this kind of ` quantum reservoir engineering ' has been proposed as a viable approach towards the experimental preparation of interesting many - body states  @xcite .",
    "remarkable examples include the preparation of pure states with long - range order in bose - einstein - condensates  @xcite , photonic arrays  @xcite , as well as topologically ordered states  @xcite .",
    "more generally , verstraete et al .",
    "@xcite argued that , at least in principle , an arbitrary quantum computation can be realized by dissipation .",
    "the corresponding process is similar to feynman s clock construction and has the final state of the computation as its steady state .",
    "subsequent work  @xcite following this program proposed dissipative gadgets allowing to realize different dissipative dynamics during subsequent time - intervals .    here we examine the dissipative preparation of specific topologically ordered states .",
    "while not realizing a fully dissipative computation , this basic primitive could act as a building block in a hybrid scheme where initial states for quantum computation are prepared by thermalization and subsequent computations are performed in the usual framework of topological quantum computation .",
    "we ask whether dissipative processes can be used to realize an _ encoder _ , i.e. , a map which turns states on individual physical qubits into encoded ( many - qubit ) states .",
    "in contrast , previous work only considered the dissipative preparation of _ some _ ground state without guarantees on the logical information .",
    "it is worth mentioning that various unitary encoders are known for topologically ordered systems . for the toric code",
    "@xcite on an @xmath0  lattice , dennis et al .",
    "@xcite gave a unitary circuit with two - local controlled - not ( cnot ) gates of depth  @xmath3 acting as an encoder .",
    "bravyi et al .",
    "@xcite showed for any evolution under a local time - dependent hamiltonian acting as an encoder requires time at least  @xmath4 . in turn , brown et al .",
    "@xcite present a duality transformation from a 2d cluster state to a topologically ordered state which can be interpreted as a geometrically local quantum circuit of matching depth . dropping the requirement of locality , aguado and vidal  @xcite gave an encoder with depth  @xmath5 with geometrically non - local two - qubit gates .",
    "the dissipative encoder considered here may be realized by designing suitable system - environment interactions .",
    "this is to be contrasted with schemes involving error correction , which generally consist of syndrome extraction by measurement and associated correction operations . for the toric code , an encoding procedure of this form",
    "was given  @xcite .",
    "it involves active error correction operations similar to the minimal matching technique used in  @xcite .    to define the notion of an encoder in more detail ,",
    "consider a quantum error - correcting code @xmath6 encoding @xmath7  logical qubits into @xmath8  physical qubits .",
    "informally , an encoder is a map taking any state  @xmath9 into its encoded version  @xmath10 .",
    "( this notion implicitly assumes a choice of basis of  @xmath11 ) .",
    "since we are interested in a physical system of @xmath8  qubits , we will require the encoder to convert a ` simple ' unencoded initial state into an encoded logical state .",
    "that is , we ask that for a fixed subset @xmath12 of qubits and a fixed product state @xmath13 on the remaining qubits , the encoder maps @xmath14 we are interested in encoders realized by evolution under a markovian master equation @xmath15 here the liouvillian has lindblad form @xmath16 with lindblad operators  @xmath17 acting locally on a constant number of qubits .",
    "we ask whether the completely positive trace - preserving map ( cptpm )  @xmath18 generated by  @xmath19 is an ( approximate ) encoder for sufficiently large times  @xmath20 , i.e. , whether it can realize the map  ( [ eq : encodermap ] ) .",
    "our result is the following .",
    "[ thm : encoder ]",
    "let @xmath21 be the toric code consisting of @xmath22 qubits on the edges of a periodic @xmath0-lattice .",

    "@xmath30 and @xmath31 are located along a horizontal respectively vertical line passing through @xmath32 .",
    "* @xmath33 are the remaining @xmath34 qubits .",
    "there is a geometrically local liouvillian  @xmath19 ( with @xmath35-qubit lindblad operators ) such that the following holds : for any state @xmath36 on @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and for any @xmath39 , we have @xmath40 whenever @xmath41 in this expression , we use the trace norm @xmath42 for hermitian operators .",
    "we will give a detailed description of the relevant liouvillian in section  [ sec : schemedescription ] .",
    ", and their appropriate initialization for encoding : qubits @xmath43 are initialized in the state to be encoded .",
    "each qubit in  @xmath44 is in the state  @xmath45 , while qubits in  @xmath46 are in the state  @xmath47 .",
    "the state of the remaining qubits  @xmath33 can be an arbitrary ( mixed ) state . in the figure",
    ", we also illustrate the support of possible realizations for logical operators @xmath48 and @xmath49 associated with the first and second logical qubit , respectively .",
    "our encoding procedure requires choosing one such realization for each logical pauli generator such that they overlap only at the initial unencoded qubits .",
    "[ fig : encoderqubits ] , width=377 ]    the evolution  @xmath18 implements a continuous - time version of a local error correction process somewhat analogous to toom s rule : excitations move towards a single plaquette / vertex where they annihilate .",
    "an analogous ground - state preparation scheme for more general frustration - free hamiltonians was discussed in  @xcite .",
    "however , guarantees about encoded information appear to be harder to obtain in their generic scheme . furthermore because their construction requires the injectivity  @xcite property of the associated projected entangled pair state ( peps ) description ( and hence blocking of sites ) , the resulting locality of the lindblad operators will be slightly worse .",
    "in contrast , our scheme directly exploits the stabilizer structure of the underlying code , resulting in a comparatively simple liouvillian .",
    "indeed , our construction is optimal in terms of locality , i.e. , the number of particles involved in each lindblad term  @xcite .",
    "related locality constraints for pure steady states were derived in  @xcite . in our setup",
    ", the initial product state determines in a transparent way which code state is prepared .",
    "our work goes beyond the mere characterization of steady states by adding two key ingredients : the consideration of logical observables ( which are preserved ) and an analysis of the convergence towards the ground space of the toric code .",
    "the bound @xmath1 on the convergence time established by theorem  [ thm : encoder ] improves on the @xmath50 upper bound predicted for the analogous construction in  @xcite , without a guarantee on the logical information .",
    "in fact , it is tight : there are initial states  @xmath51 which thermalize slowly , i.e. ,  @xmath52 is far away from the code space  @xmath11 for any time  @xmath53 . in separate work  @xcite",
    ", we provide a general no - go theorem in this direction : dissipative state preparation of topologically ordered states requires at least a linear amount of time in  @xmath54 if the liouvillian is local . combined with theorem  [ thm : encoder ] , this implies that the construction presented here is optimal in terms of preparation time among the entire class of local liouvillians .    in summary , our work shows that dissipative processes can be used to implement an encoder for the toric code .",
    "intriguingly , this encoder is more time - efficient than the best known unitary circuit .",
    "we stress , however , that both types of encoders need to be supplemented with additional mechanisms in the presence of noise , especially if the encoded information is further processed . as discussed in  @xcite , local liouvillians such as the one considered here are not suitable for the preservation of encoded information .",
    "we first describe a generic liouvillian associated with a stabilizer code  @xmath11 with stabilizer generators  @xmath55",
    ". we will subsequently specialize this to the toric code .",
    "let  @xmath56 be the projections onto the @xmath57 eigenspaces of the stabilizer  @xmath58 .",
    "the code space  @xmath11 is the ground space of the hamiltonian @xmath59 ( the global energy shift is introduced for convenience ) .",
    "our goal is to implement a local error - correction strategy by a dissipative evolution .",
    "concretely , we associate a unitary pauli correction operator  @xmath60 to each stabilizer generator  @xmath58 such that @xmath60 and @xmath58 anticommute , i.e. , @xmath61 .",

    "the key property of the function  @xmath146 is the fact that it is compatible with the way excitations are propagated under the correction operations .",
    "more precisely , for each stabilizer  @xmath58 , let @xmath147 be the set of correction operations that anticommute with it , i.e. , @xmath148 then @xmath146 has the property that @xmath149 namely , whenever an excitation is created by @xmath150 at @xmath58 , one can be certain that a higher valued excitation has been removed at @xmath151 .",

    "according to the definition of @xmath168 and @xmath169 , this implies @xmath170 i.e. , the expectation value decays exponentially .",
    "the claim  ( [ eq : ddecay ] ) then follows from the fact that @xmath171 for all @xmath172 since these are projections , hence @xmath173 .    with lemma  [ lem : logicalinfopres ] and lemma  [ lem : convergencetimebound ] , we are ready to prove our main result .",

    "we have presented a quasi - local time - independent liouvillian which generates a dissipative encoder : it encodes two physical qubits into the ground space of the toric code .",
    "its key features are translation - invariance in the bulk , optimal locality of the lindblad operators , as well as optimal , i.e. , linear convergence ( encoding ) time of the resulting dissipative encoder as a function of the lattice size .",
    "this illustrates the power of engineered dissipation for state preparation in a non - trivial setting with degeneracy .",
    "since the liouvillian is constituted of quasi - local cptpm associated with each stabilizer , one may interpret the resulting evolution @xmath18 as the repeated application of the ` average ' correction map ( cf .  ( [ eq : averagebtsuperop ] ) ) .",
    "this viewpoint immediately results in a preparation algorithm for surface code states .",
    "the latter inherits the properties of the dissipative evolution : it is translation - invariant up to boundary conditions , composed of feedback - free quasi - local maps , and requires only a minimal number of iterations to converge .",
    "these features make it an attractive candidate for potential experimental realizations .",
    "the most pressing open question is to incorporate noise in the form of control and initialization imperfections into the design and analysis of such an encoder .",
    "the holy grail is to engineer a reasonable , possibly time - dependent liouvillian master equation such that after a specified initial period physical qubits are encoded with only a constant , lattice - size independent probability of suffering uncorrectable errors .",
    "expecting further reduction seems impossible without changing the assumptions due to the possibility of an error occuring on the unencoded qubit .",
    "as it stands , our protocol @xmath54-fold amplifies such an initial error probability as certain errors on the qubits in @xmath194 are propagated into logical errors .",
    "indeed , we suspect that a fully fault - tolerant encoding scheme would require progressively growing the code s physical support while simultaneously introducing dissipative terms responsible for self - correction within this support . as in @xcite",
    "such terms would be responsible for ensuring that the rate of occurence for uncorrectable errors decreases with the code size .",
