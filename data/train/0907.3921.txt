    "ls  i  + 61@xmath0  303 is a high - mass x - ray binary system at an estimated distance of @xmath1 , composed of a compact object and a b0 ve star of 12.5 @xmath2 with a circumstellar disc .",
    "the observed radio through optical emission is modulated with a period ( @xmath3 ) , which is believed to be associated with the orbital period of the binary system @xcite .",
    "new spectroscopic optical measurements by aragona et al .",
    "@xcite provide a reassessment of the orbital elements , with periastron now believed to take place at phase @xmath4 and the orbital eccentricity @xmath5 .",
    "x - ray modulation at the orbital period has been measured with the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) all - sky monitor @xcite , although regular observations taken every 2 days over a period covering 6 orbital cycles in 2007 - 2008 with the rxte proportional counter array ( pca ) show no evidence for phase - dependent flux modulation @xcite . these same measurements , as well as later measurements by ray & hartman @xcite reveal bright x - ray flaring episodes lasting longer than 10 minutes , with substructure on the timescale of a few seconds , and possible quasi - periodic oscillations",
    ". a much shorter timescale flare , lasting 0.23 seconds , has also been detected with the swift burst alert telescope ( bat ) @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the x - ray variability may be related to other sources in the same field - of - view ( e.g. @xcite ) .    a gamma - ray source coincident with ls",
    "i  + 61@xmath6303 was first detected by cos - b @xcite ; observations with the energetic gamma ray experiment telescope ( egret ) revealed variability on both short ( @xmath7daily ) and long ( @xmath7monthly ) timescales @xcite .",
    "firm identification of the gamma - ray source with ls  i  + 61@xmath6303 was achieved when ground - based tev gamma - ray observatories provided an accurate position for the site of the variable gamma - ray emission @xcite .    with the exception of the crab nebula , ls  i",
    "+ 61@xmath6303 is now possibly the most heavily observed tev source , with deep exposures by whipple @xcite , magic @xcite and veritas @xcite accumulated over many years .",
    "tev emission is only strongly detected around apastron ( around phases @xmath8 ) , although weak evidence for low - flux emission at other phases has been reported @xcite .",
    "analysis of the complete magic dataset has revealed modulation of the gamma - ray flux close to the binary orbital period .",
    "the relatively low source flux combined with an orbital period closely matched to the lunar cycle means that the variability of the tev emission with phase is often investigated using data taken over many orbital cycles , thus implicitly assuming no major orbit - to - orbit variability .",
    "comparison with observations at other wavelengths also often assumes a consistent orbital dependence ; clearly , strictly contemporaneous observations allow more rigorous conclusions to be drawn .",
    "the launch of the large area telescope ( lat ) onboard the fermi gamma - ray space telescope provides the opportunity for such studies .",
    "first results from lat observations @xcite show that ls  i  + 61@xmath6303 is detected continuously over all phases and that the lightcurve shows orbit - to - orbit variability . unlike the behaviour at tev energies , the emission measured by the lat peaks at apastron . to coincide with the first lat observations",
    ", veritas conducted an intensive observing campaign during one orbital cycle in october / november 2008 , covering phases @xmath9 .",
    "further observations were made to overlap with a suzaku x - ray exposure in january / february 2009 .",
    "the results of the veritas observations are presented here .",
    "veritas @xcite is an array of four imaging atmosperic cherenkov telescopes located at the basecamp of the fred lawrence whipple observatory near tucson , arizona .",
    "the array has been fully operational since mid-2007 and has sensitivity sufficient to detect a source with 1% of the steady crab nebula flux in @xmath10  hours .",
    "observations cover the energy range from 100  gev to beyond @xmath11  tev with an energy resolution of 15 - 20% above 300  gev , and an angular resolution per gamma - ray photon of @xmath12 at 1  tev .",
    "observations of ls  i  + 61@xmath6303 were made during clear nights with all four telescopes operating and no major hardware problems .",
    "the source was offset from the centre of the field - of - view by @xmath13 to allow simultaneous background estimation ( _ wobble _ mode @xcite ) . in october / november 2008 ,",
    "28.6 hours of data were collected over 19 nights , from @xmath9 ; although we note that observations on the last 3 nights ( @xmath14 ) were only possible at decreasing source elevation angles ( and so lower sensitivity ) .",
    "observing conditions were excellent ; this dataset is the most sensitive tev exposure yet obtained within a single orbital cycle of ls  i  + 61@xmath6303 .",
    "observations in january / february 2009 were planned to coincide with a 130  ks suzaku exposure beginning 2009 - 01 - 25 at 16:22 utc .",
    "8.2  hours of observations were made on 5 nights , from @xmath15 .",
    "poor weather resulted in a four - day gap in coverage , from @xmath16 .",
    "all of these observations are summarized in table  [ observations ] .",
    "the data were analysed using standard veritas analysis tools @xcite and with gamma - ray selection cuts suitable for a point - like source with a spectrum similar to that of the crab nebula .",
    "the background in the source region was estimated using the `` ring - background '' method @xcite .",
    "the mean elevation at which these observations were made is @xmath17 , resulting in an energy threshold ( defined as the peak of the differential gamma - ray rate for a crab nebula - like spectrum ) for this analysis of 440  gev .",
    "all results have been verified using two independent analysis chains .    the complete 36.8  hour exposure results in a @xmath18 excess and a mean integral flux above 500  gev of ( @xmath19)@xmath20ph  @xmath21s@xmath22 .",
    "table  [ observations ] shows the results for each of the individual night s observations .",
    "the quoted significance values are not corrected for statistical trials ( 24 nights = 24 trials ) .",
    "we find no significant evidence for emission on any single night , pre- or post - trials .",
    "figure  [ lightcurve ] shows flux upper limits as a function of orbital phase for the two orbits covered here , and for both orbits combined .",
    "the lack of strong emission from ls  i  + 61@xmath6303 during these observations is somewhat suprising , but does not necessarily contradict previous measurements .",
    "the conclusion of previously published magic and veritas results is that the source is , on average , detected at tev energies in the phase range @xmath8 .",
    "low statistics have not allowed us to draw firm conclusions about the light curve shape in this region , or to address the possibility of orbit - to - orbit variability . as noted above , the apastron coverage during this campaign was limited , with large data gaps .",
    "for example , the coverage between phases 0.72 and 0.82 consists of only 40 minutes at @xmath23 elevation ; the peak of the tev emission might well have occured between these phases for these orbits and been undetectable .",
    "much stronger conclusions can be drawn for the october / november 2008 observations over phase ranges @xmath24 , with a large dataset of nightly observations at high elevation angles .",
    "the source is not detected by veritas during any of the phase bins in this range , while strictly contemporaneous fermi measurements show the gev lightcurve peaking during periastron ( around @xmath4 ) @xcite .",
    "clearly , the gev and tev flux states are not correlated .",
    "there are now many models in the literature which describe high energy processes in ls  i  + 61@xmath6303 ( e.g. @xcite .",
    "these consider both accretion - driven and pulsar - wind scenarios and invoke both hadronic and leptonic relativistic particle populations .",
    "their predictions are often fit to mean broadband spectral energy distributions ( seds ) gathered from observations made at different times in different wavelengths .",
    "the evidence presented here for a lack of correlation between the tev and gev fluxes shows that the orbital dependence of the emission in these wavebands is not the same , providing an additional constraint for the models to address",
    ". a number of processes could be important in this ; the energy dependence of photon - photon absorption leads to differing opacities for gev and tev emission around the orbit(e.g .",
    "synchrotron loss rates and inverse compton efficiencies are both also expected to vary as the compact object encounters changing stellar wind densities and photon fields @xcite , which will modify the tev and gev fluxes differently .    [",
