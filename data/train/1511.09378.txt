    "an _ inverse monoid _ is a monoid @xmath1 with the property that for each @xmath6 there exists a unique element @xmath7 ( the inverse of @xmath8 ) such that @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the _ natural partial order _ on an inverse monoid @xmath1 is defined as follows : @xmath11 if @xmath12 for some idempotent @xmath13 .",
    "each inverse monoid admits a smallest group congruence which is usually denoted by @xmath14 .",
    "inverse monoids appear in various areas of mathematics due to their role in the description of partial symmetries ( see @xcite for this approach ) .",
    "an inverse monoid is called @xmath3-inverse if each class of the least group congruence has a greatest element with respect to the natural partial order .",
    "for example , free inverse monoids are @xmath3-inverse due to the fact that the cayley graph of a free group is a tree .",
    "this implies that every inverse monoid has an @xmath3-inverse cover , i.e. , every inverse monoid is an ( idempotent separating ) homomorphic image of an @xmath3-inverse monoid .",
    "this is the only known way to produce an @xmath3-inverse cover for any inverse monoid , but it constructs an infinite cover even for finite inverse monoids .",
    "it is natural to ask whether each finite inverse monoid has a finite @xmath3-inverse cover .",
    "this question was first formulated by k.  henckell and j.  rhodes @xcite , when they observed that an affirmative answer would imply an affirmative answer for the pointlike conjecture for inverse monoids .",
    "the latter conjecture was proved by c.  j.  ash @xcite , but the finite @xmath3-inverse cover problem is still open .",
    "k.  auinger and the second author reformulate the finite @xmath3-inverse cover problem in @xcite as follows .",
    "first they reduce the question of the existence of a finite @xmath3-inverse cover for all finite inverse monoids to the existence of a generator - preserving dual premorphism  a map more general than a homomorphism  from a finite group to a margolis  meakin expansion of a finite group . the margolis ",
    "meakin expansion @xmath15 of a group @xmath16 is obtained from a cayley graph of @xmath16 similarly to how a free inverse monoid is obtained from the cayley graph of a free group .",
    "if there is a dual premorphism @xmath17 from a finite group @xmath18 , then @xmath18 is an extension of some group @xmath19 by @xmath16 , and , for any group variety @xmath2 containing @xmath19 , there is a dual premorphism from the ` most general ' extension of a member of @xmath2 by @xmath16 .",
    "this group , denoted by @xmath20 , can also be obtained from the cayley graph of @xmath16 and the variety @xmath2 .",
    "it turns out that in fact the existence of a dual premorphism @xmath21 only depends on the cayley graph of @xmath16 and the variety @xmath2 .",
    "this leads in @xcite to an equivalent of the finite @xmath3-inverse cover problem formulated by means of graphs and group varieties .",
    "the motivation for our research was to obtain similar results for a class of inverse monoids significantly larger than margolis - meakin expansions .",
    "studying the dual premorphisms @xmath22 , where @xmath1 is an inverse monoid and @xmath2 is a group variety , we generalize the main construction of @xcite for a class called finite - above @xmath0-unitary inverse monoids , which contains all finite @xmath0-unitary inverse monoids and the margolis ",
    "meakin expansions of all groups .",
    "this leads to a condition  involving , as in @xcite , a process of constructing descending chains of graphs  on a finite - above @xmath0-unitary inverse monoid @xmath1 and a group variety @xmath2 that is equivalent to @xmath1 having an @xmath3-inverse cover over @xmath23 , or , as we shall briefly say later on , an @xmath3-inverse cover via @xmath2 .",
    "our condition restricts to the one in @xcite if @xmath1 is a margolis  meakin expansion of a group . as an illustration",
    ", we apply this process to find a sufficient condition on the natural partial order and the least group congruence @xmath14 of @xmath1 for @xmath1 to have no @xmath3-inverse cover via @xmath5 , the variety of abelian groups .    in section 2 ,",
    "we introduce some of the structures and definitions needed later , particularly those from the theory of inverse categories acted upon by groups .",
    "these play an important role in our approach , especially the derived categories of the natural morphisms of @xmath0-unitary inverse monoids onto their greatest group images and some categories arising from cayley graphs of groups .",
    "in the first part of section 3 , we introduce the inverse monoids which play the role of the margolis  meakin expansions of groups in our paper .",
    "the second part of section 3 contains the main result of the paper ( theorem [ main ] ) .",
    "section 4 is devoted to giving a sufficient condition in theorem [ abelmain ] for a finite - above @xmath0-unitary inverse monoid to have no @xmath3-inverse cover via the variety of abelian groups .",
    "in this section we recall the notions and results needed in the paper . for the undefined notions and notation , the reader is referred to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "let @xmath1 be an inverse monoid ( in particular , a group ) and @xmath24 an arbitrary set .",

    "a non - empty path ( cycle ) @xmath69 is called _ simple _ if the vertices @xmath70 are pairwise distinct and @xmath71 .",
    "as it is usual with paths on cayley graphs of groups , we would like to allow traversing edges in the reverse direction .",
    "more formally , we add a formal reverse of each edge to the graph , and consider paths on this extended graph as follows . given a graph @xmath44 ,",
