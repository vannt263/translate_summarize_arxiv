    "our knowledge of the structure of small - scale magnetic features on the sun is based mainly on spectroscopic observations in polarized light . to obtain the information from observations",
    ", we have to take recourse to laborious simulations of spectral effects .",
    "the simulation is made for such spectral line parameters which depend primarily on the properties of magnetic elements and can be easily interpreted .",
    "nowadays we are able to study spatially unresolved magnetic elements with strong magnetic fields .",
    "a technique for the diagnostics of small - scale magnetic features has been elaborated quite well .",
    "concurrent spectropolarimetric observations of several hundred lines are successfully carried out .",
    "multidimensional mhd models of solar granulation are built .",
    "all these advances make it possible to calculate the stokes profiles of spectral lines , compare them with observations , and gain information on the internal structure of magnetic flux tubes .",
    "the most interesting object of studies in the interpretation of the stokes profiles is the v - profile asymmetry found in 1985 in observations of plages and the quiet sun network @xcite . up to now",
    ", no source has been found for the asymmetry of stokes profiles ( see overview @xcite ) .",
    "while the mechanism of area asymmetry can be understood in general , the amplitude asymmetry may be caused by various factors ( variations of velocity along and across the line of sight , time variations , etc . ) , and so we still do not understand what makes the v - profile amplitudes asymmetric even at the disk center . that is why any attempt to reproduce the observed asymmetry using mhd models gives an additional valuable information on the structure of magnetic elements and their environment .",
    "a correct reproduction of the asymmetry is the most rigorous test for solar granulation models .    in this study we intended to calculate the stokes profiles of photospheric lines using 2-d mhd models of the solar photosphere described in our paper @xcite , to study profile variations in time and in space depending on amount of magnetic flux and position on the solar disk , and thus to find whether such theoretical models can be used to interpret spectropolarimetric observations .",
    "theoretical 2-d nonstationary mhd models of the solar photosphere @xcite are characterized by a high spatial resolution ( the horizontal calculation mesh width is 15  km ) , the existence of magnetic flux tubes in the region simulated , as well as the existence of nonmagnetic regions between the flux tubes  the granules .",
    "these models allow not only the simulation of spectral effects in the stokes v profiles , but the analysis of i profiles as well , and this widens the scope of spectral analysis .",
    "recall major features of these models .",
    "we commonly assume in 2-d models that magnetic elements are either symmetric from the viewpoint of parallel transfer or axially symmetric . in the first case they are magnetic flux slabs , and in the second case they are magnetic flux tubes .",
    "our models deal with flux slabs , but we call them flux tubes by convention .",
    "the simulated region comprises @xmath0 calculation meshes with a horizontal and a vertical width of 15  km , it is rectangular in shape , 3840  km wide and 1920  km high , its upper boundary corresponds to the height @xmath1  km above the level @xmath2 .",
    "the region may be considered as 256 vertical columns spaced at intervals of 15  km parallel to one another and to the line of sight .",
    "the location , thickness , and number of magnetic flux tubes in the simulated region depend on mean amount of magnetic flux and simulation time .",
    "the number of flux tubes and their width at the level @xmath3 increase with mean magnetic flux .",
    "the filling factor in the region grows with magnetic flux .",
    "the temperature in the flux tubes in the region of formation of spectral lines , i.e. , above the level @xmath3 , increases as compared to the surrounding nonmagnetic medium .",
    "the intensity of the continuous radiation emerging from flux tubes also increases .",
    "the maximum magnetic field strength in flux tubes is approximately the same in all models ( @xmath4  mt at @xmath3 ) .",
    "the wilson depression is 150200  km .",
    "comparing the temperature @xmath5 averaged over space and time for our mhd models and the temperature @xmath6 for the quiet photosphere ( the empirical homogeneous holmu model ) , we found that @xmath5 for a theoretical nonstationary nonmagnetic model was higher than @xmath6 , the excess being as large as 400 k in the region where weak lines are formed ( @xmath7 ) and several tens of degrees in the region where moderate - strong lines are formed .",
    "the space - average temperature for mhd models slightly diminishes with growing simulation time at a particular mean field strength .",
    "the temperature @xmath5 diminishes as well with increasing mean field strength in the simulated region .",
    "we used four model sequences in the stokes profile calculations , the mean magnetic field strengths in them were 0 , 10 , 20 , and 30  mt , each sequence had five models calculated for points of 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 , and 25 min in time . in all",
    ", we had twenty 2-d models .",
    "the model for a specific mean strength ( for instance , 10  mt ) and a specific point in time ( for instance , 25 min ) is designated as mhd-10 - 25 .",
    "the transfer equations for a radiation polarized in a magnetic field were solved separately for every model column .",
    "first the optical depth @xmath8 in the continuum along the line of sight was determined , and then the stokes profiles were calculated in the lte approximation by the procedure described by beckers @xcite and landi deglinnocenti @xcite .",
    "the algorithm and program for the stokes profile calculations are described in detail by sheminova @xcite .",
    "the mesh for solving the equations of transfer along the line of sight was built in the following manner . the initial mesh point ( the point on the upper boundary of simulated region where the radiation emerges on the solar surface )",
    "was found from the model values of the geometric height @xmath9 , continuous absorption coefficient @xmath10 , and matter density @xmath11 which correspond to two points in the model beginning from the upper boundary of the region : @xmath12 $ ] according to the trapezoidal formula",
    ". then all subsequent points @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "thus the model values of @xmath9 were scaled to the @xmath8 scale and then to the @xmath14 scale .",
    "after that , we specified a standard mesh nonuniform in @xmath14 : @xmath14 was 0.2 , 0.15 , 0.1 , 0.05 , and 0.1 in the intervals between @xmath14 values of -6.4 , -5.2 , -4.0 , -3.0 , -0.5 , and 1.0 .",
    "all model parameters were calculated according to the standard mesh , and our experience suggests that the mesh gives stable results .",
    "the number of mesh points did not exceed 95 .",
    "the models were calculated for various distances from the disk center with @xmath15 taken into account .",
    "the models were thus made ready for exact calculations of the transfer equations of unno - beckers - landi deglinnocenti .",
    "the stokes profiles were calculated for each column , then they were averaged over the simulated region , and we got a profile for a particular magnetic flux and a particular point in time . as we had five models for points in time 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 , and 25 min , we had five corresponding profiles .",
    "we averaged them over time and found a resulting profile for a specific magnetic flux , and this profile could be compared with observations which have a low spatial and temporal resolution . to study the center - to - limb variations in the stokes profiles ,",
    "the calculations were made for five values of @xmath16 , 0.45 , 0.67 , 0.83 , 1.0 .",
    "we picked the optimum horizontal mesh width which would provide the necessary accuracy with shortest computing time .",
    "calculations of a profile averaged over time and over columns with mesh widths of 15 , 30 , 45 , 60 , and 90  km suggested that the optimum mesh width was 60  km , and thus we worked with 64 columns rather than with 256 .",
    "we selected seven lines which are often used in observations of magnetic features .",
    "table  1 gives their atomic parameters : the low excitation potential @xmath17 , effective land factor @xmath18 , oscillator strength @xmath19 from @xcite ( and from @xcite for the line fe i @xmath20  526.06  nm and for fe  ii lines ) , effective optical depths of formation of the profile center and the whole profile  @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the damping constant was calculated with unsold s formula .",
    "the lines were selected so that the photospheric region where they are formed might be as extended as possible .",
    "as is evident from the effective line formation depths calculated with the depression contribution functions for the quiet sun @xcite , the lines selected by us refer to that region in the photosphere which extends from @xmath23 to @xmath24 , and therefore all results of our spectral analyses refer to just this part of the photosphere .",
    "the number of lines was limited mainly by great time expenditure in the stokes profile calculations for the mhd models .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]             so , the calculations of i profiles and their parameters reveal that mhd models for the quiet sun describe adequately the observed spectral effects and reproduce the well - known relationships , but a quantitative checking suggests that the model is slightly `` overheated '' , and this is likely to be the cause of small absolute shifts derived by us . to test this assumption",
    ", we studied the variations of the calculated central depths @xmath25 , equivalent widths @xmath26 , and absolute shifts @xmath27 along the region simulated with a zero field strength for points in time 2125 min .",
    "we selected two lines , @xmath20  614.9  nm ( @xmath28  km ) and @xmath20  525.02  nm ( @xmath29  km ) , in order to follow the parameter variations at different photospheric levels . the line @xmath20  525.02  nm being highly sensitive to temperature , the dependence of its central depth on distance @xmath30 along the region has sharp dips at the boundaries of granules and intergranular lanes , where the temperature rises .",
    "the equivalent widths follow in general the run of @xmath31 , but there are some peculiarities .",
    "the relations @xmath31 and @xmath32 account for temperature variations in the region , and @xmath33 accounts in full measure for variations in vertical velocity .",
    "figure 2 displays the absolute shifts along the length of the region simulated by mhd-0 .",
    "the shift @xmath34 is predominantly positive in intergranular lanes and negative in granules , thus allowing a clear delineation between granules and integranular lanes .",
    "we observed no significant difference in the changes of @xmath33 for both lines at different photospheric levels .",
    "oscillations of vertical velocities in time can be seen in granules , but we could not detect 5-min oscillations , probably because of a long temporal step ( 1 min ) .",
    "the absolute shifts calculated for the profiles averaged over the region at the moments 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 min are 517 , 5 , -51 , -127 , -316  m / s ( @xmath20  614.9  nm ) and 794 , -167 , 55 , -161 , -347  m / s ( @xmath20  525.02  nm ) , and for the profiles averaged also in time they were 4  m / s ( @xmath20  614.9  nm ) and 60  m / s ( @xmath20  525.02  nm ) .",
    "these shifts are substantially smaller than the observed shifts , especially for the line fe  ii @xmath20  614.9  nm .",
    "a shift of -133  m / s observed in @xmath20  525.02  nm is attained in the calculations at some moments , but a shift of -1108  m / s observed in the @xmath20  614.9  nm line has not been reached at all .",
    "we may infer that the time averaging is a very delicate element in simulating absolute shifts .",
    "it has to be done either over a long time interval or with a small time step .",
    "there may exist another cause of small shifts in the region of fe  ii line formation .",
    "observations indicate that the pattern of convective motions changes in the middle photosphere , the correlation between brightness and velocity is violated .",
    "blue absolute shifts become very small at a height of about 300  km and become even red above this level .",
    "below , at a height of 100  km , blue shifts increase up to 1.52  km / s .",
    "it is likely that our models simulate inadequately the violation of the brightness ",
    "velocity relationship , and so the gradient of vertical velocities in the models is too low .",
    "the cause appears to be a too large line opacity coefficient , which results in a slower cooling of the matter than in the actual solar photosphere .",
    "profiles of the stokes parameters i , q , u , and v offer considerable scope for studying physical conditions in small - scale magnetic features .",
    "the diagnostics of magnetic fields is made primarily with the q , u , and v profiles of some infrared lines @xcite and v profiles of lines in the visible region , and with the use of the method of v - profile amplitude ratios for pairs of lines @xcite or center - to - limb variations in the v - profile parameters @xcite . the diagnostics of velocities in magnetic elements is made by measuring zero - crossing shifts , broadening and asymmetry of v profiles . the zero - crossing shift @xmath35 is measured with respect to the wavelength of the core center of i profile ( @xmath36 ) , i.e. , @xmath37 , @xmath38 being the wavelength of the v - profile center .",
    "the v - profile center is a point in the profile where it crosses the @xmath20-axis , passing from its blue wing to the red wing .",
    "the wavelength of the i - profile center @xmath36 is defined as a point where @xmath39 rather than the center of gravity of the profile core .",
    "the v - profile broadening is defined by the full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of the blue and red wings and by the difference @xmath40 between the blue and red wing maxima .",
    "the v - profile asymmetry is measured by the parameters @xmath41 and @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 being the amplitude and area of the blue ( @xmath45 ) and red ( @xmath46 ) wings ( they are usually taken without sign ) .",
    "the temperature diagnostics in spatially unresolved magnetic elements is done from the q , u , and v profiles of strong lines and also with the use of the v - profile amplitude ratio between two lines with different temperature response .      observed i and v profiles ( with large @xmath47 )",
    "can be found in paper @xcite , they were obtained for three lines ( fe  i 615.1  nm , 617.3  nm , fe  ii 614.9  nm ) in the plage regions 0.63@xmath48 in size , the observation time was 0.5 s. the lines fe  ii 614.9  nm and fe  i 615.1  nm were observed simultaneously in an active plage near a spot at @xmath49 , and the line fe  i 617.3  nm was observed in another intense plage near a spot at @xmath50 . we compared these profiles with calculated profiles averaged over the entire simulated region ( about 7@xmath48 ) and over time ( 5 min ) .",
    "the mean field strength in this region was 30  mt .",
    "no stokes profiles calculated with our models could fit the observed profiles .",
    "then we calculated anew the profiles for the fe  i @xmath20  617.3  nm line , having changed the spatial averaging .",
    "we selected two areas 1.5@xmath48 and 0.6@xmath48 in size from the simulated region with a stronger magnetic flux tube located at the center of these areas ( region 2 in fig .",
    "3 @xcite ) .",
    "thus we increased substantially the filling factor .",
    "figure 3 displays the i and v profiles averaged over time for the entire region ( 03840  km ) , for the entire region 2 ( 18002800  km ) , and for the central part of region 2 ( 22002600  km ) .",
    "the results of our calculations confirmed the assumption of amer and kneer @xcite that the filling factor is of great importance for the cases considered .",
    "time variations in the profile do not reproduce the observed weakening of i profiles , while spatial changes of the region seem to account for the observed effect .",
    "notice that the @xmath51 zero - point in fig .",
    "3 coincides with the zero - crossing wavelength @xmath38 for the v profiles , just as this was done in @xcite .",
    "figure 4 shows the asymmetry of amplitudes ( @xmath52 ) and areas ( @xmath53 ) as well as zero - crossing wavelength shifts ( @xmath35 ) derived for v profile calculated with mhd models and observed taken from the literature .",
    "the calculated profiles were obtained for three regions at the disk center with mean field strengths of 10 , 20 , and 30  mt , the time interval was 2125  min .",
    "the effective heights @xmath54 of formation of each v profile were taken from table  2 .",
    "our calculations @xcite indicate that the heights @xmath54 calculated with a magnetic field and without it are practically the same . besides",
    ", the effective heights for i and v profiles differ insignificantly . as can seen from fig .  4",
    ", the calculated amplitude asymmetry fits quite well the measurements in plages with high spatial resolution @xcite , while the calculated area asymmetry is systematically smaller than the observed one .",
    "the area asymmetry varies from 0 to 0.08 as measured by various observers and from -0.05 to 0.02 in our calculations , i.e. , our models do not reproduce the observed area asymmetry @xmath53 .",
    "the zero - crossing shifts @xmath35 derived for simulated regions with a mean field strength of 20  mt are in accord with observations made with a high spatial resolution @xcite .",
    "as regards the absolute shifts of i profiles ( see table 2 ) , our calculations do not reveal any blue shift as we have already noted for the region with a zero magnetic flux .",
    "the absolute shifts @xmath55 , averaged over all lines were found to be 35 , 25 , 129 , 147  m / s for mean magnetic fluxes of 0 , 10 , 20 , 30  mt , respectively .",
    "one can see that the effect of shift `` reddening '' with growing filling factor does really exist .",
    "brandt and solanki @xcite measured @xmath56  -223 , -125 , -104 , -164  m / s for different filling factors ",
    "@xmath57% , 1%  @xmath58  4% , 4%  @xmath59  8% , or @xmath60",
    "8% respectively .",
    "thus , we may infer that the simulated asymmetry and shift parameters follow the general trends observed in the behavior of these parameters .",
    "the calculated v - profile amplitude asymmetry and zero - crossing shift fit observations .",
    "the fact that we derived underestimated parameters for the v - profile area asymmetry and absolute shifts of i profiles suggests that the velocity field structure in the mhd models @xcite is inadequate .",
    "figure 5 illustrates the behavior of the calculated amplitude asymmetry @xmath61 , area asymmetry @xmath53 , and zero - crossing shift @xmath35 as functions of @xmath62 , the position of the simulated region on the disk .",
    "low - resolution observations of v profiles of the lines fe  i  524.7 , 525.02  nm @xcite are shown by dashed lines , the data were averaged over many plages which differed by their filling factors .",
    "our calculations were made for three regions with 10 , 20 , and 30  mt in the time interval 2125 min , for different values of @xmath62 .",
    "the calculated dependence of @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath35 , agrees satisfactorily with the observed one .",
    "for @xmath63 the asymmetry parameters of both lines fe  i  524.7 , 525.02  nm are smaller than the observed asymmetry parameters .",
    "figure 6 shows the magnetic line ratios mlr =  @xmath64 , the stokes v peak separation line ratios plr =  @xmath65 , and the temperature line ratios tlr =   @xmath66 calculated by us for different values of @xmath62 , the observed ratios @xcite are also given .",
    "the relations mlr@xmath67 and plr@xmath67 , which provide information on the magnetic field gradient , indicate that the calculated ratios mlr are higher than the observed ones , especially at the center of the disk .",
    "the ratios must grow toward the limb if @xmath68 decreases with height , but our data suggest that this effect is weak .",
    "it is likely that the field gradient in the flux tubes simulated is lower than in actual flux tubes in the region of formation of these lines .",
    "the calculated plr values are smaller than the observed ones : the effect is the same as for the v - profile amplitude ratios discussed above .    to study the temperature stratification in small - scale magnetic elements , we selected the lines fe  i  525.06 , 524.7  nm .",
    "the first line being stronger than the second one , @xmath69 for it is smaller by 13% as compared to @xmath70 , and therefore @xmath71 at the center of the disk and @xmath72 at the limb .",
    "deviations from these values specify the temperature variation in flux tubes . observations @xcite give the value @xmath73 .",
    "this means that the line becomes weaker in a flux tube owing to a temperature increase with respect to a nonmagnetic environment .",
    "the deviation from unity diminishes toward the limb  the temperature difference @xmath74 between the flux tube and the medium decreases . as can be seen in fig .  6 ,",
    "the calculated values of tlr are higher than the observed ones .",
    "this suggests that @xmath74 in the simulated areas are smaller as compared to actual temperature conditions observed in plages .",
    "the results obtained with the line - ratio method indicate that the magnetic field strength gradients and the temperature distribution in flux tubes are not reproduced adequately by our mhd models .",
    "observations require larger gradients and higher temperatures .",
    "simulation of spectral effects in the stokes profiles with the use of multidimensional mhd models demonstrates once again that construction of such models is of prime importance for the interpretation of spectra with the aim to study the structure of the atmospheres of the sun and stars .",
    "the simulation of spectral effects in v profiles carried out earlier with 1-d models of magnetic flux tubes proved to be incapable of adequate representation of observations .",
    "asymmetry is not reproduced in the one - dimensional approximation ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "the two - dimensional simulation employed in this study improved considerably the qualitative results , though it is still far from the desired performance .",
    "the principal results of this study are as follows .    1 .",
    "the iron abundance derived from the equivalent widths and central depths of selected spectral lines is @xmath75 .",
    "the bisectors of i profiles are c - shaped .",
    "the blue bend of bisectors in moderate - strong lines is smaller than the observed one .",
    "we obtained smaller absolute wavelength shifts , especially for fe  ii lines .",
    "for instance , the observed shifts @xmath55 for the lines fe  i @xmath20  525.02  nm , fe  ii @xmath20  614.9  nm are -133 and -1108  m / s , while the calculated shifts are 63 and 5  m / s .",
    "the calculated absolute shifts `` redden '' with growing mean field strength in the region simulated , just as the observed shifts do .",
    "the amplitude asymmetries calculated for the v profiles of the lines studied , @xmath52 , fit satisfactorily the observations made with high temporal and spatial resolution , they range from 0 to 0.3 . the deeper the line",
    "is formed , the greater is the asymmetry @xmath52 , while no direct dependence on magnetic field strength is found .",
    "the asymmetry of v - profile areas was found to be smaller than the observed one  our calculations give @xmath53 from -0.05 to 0.02 , while the observed values range from 0 to 0.08 .",
    "the asymmetry @xmath53 grows with field strength and is virtually independent of the line formation height .",
    "the zero - crossing shifts in v profiles relative to i profile are larger for the lines which form deeper in the photosphere , they also increase with magnetic flux . for regions simulated with mean field strengths of 10 , 20 ,",
    "30  mt we derived shifts ( averaged over all lines ) of 824 , 482 , 218  m / s , respectively , while low - resolution observations in the plages usually produce shifts of about 200  m / s and high - resolution observations in the plages give about 400  m / s .",
    "the agreement may be considered as quite satisfactory .",
    "the stokes profiles as well as their temperature and magnetic ratios calculated as function of height in the photosphere and position on the solar disk reproduce qualitatively the tendencies observed in the behavior of these parameters , but the quantitative estimates are not consistently in agreement .",
    "our final inference is that our models are `` overheated '' in the upper photosphere and as a consequence the gradients of velocities and magnetic field are underestimated .",
    "we believe that the overheating is caused by a too high opacity coefficient in lines , and in addition , the simulation results for the upper layers are strongly affected by boundary conditions .",
    "thus , the synthesis of spectral effects is a rather rigorous test for mhd models . on the other hand , further improvement of numerical simulation methods",
    "advances our understanding of the physical processes responsible for the formation of small - scale magnetic elements and the observational spectral effects related to them .",
