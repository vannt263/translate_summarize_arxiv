    "@xcite ) predicts almost scale invariant cosmic density perturbations  @xcite , which explains the observed large scale structure of the universe and the cosmic microwave background  @xcite .    among inflation models ,",
    "chaotic inflation  @xcite is the most attractive model since it is free from the initial condition problem . especially , even if the universe is closed and likely to collapse just after the beginning of the universe , the potential energy of the inflaton easily dominates before the collapse and hence inflation naturally takes place  @xcite .",

    "the model becomes consistent with the constraint from the planck experiment  @xcite . especially , the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath4 is much smaller than the prediction of the purely quadratic model if the shift - symmetry breaking in the kahler potential is non - negligible .",
    "however , if the shift symmetry is largely broken in the kahler potential , the inflaton potential obtains large sugra effects for large inflaton field values .",
    "the inflaton potential depends on the inflaton field through an exponential factor @xmath5 and hence it blows up exponentially for large inflaton field values .",
    "it should be reminded that for chaotic inflation to naturally take place event in a closed universe , the inflaton potential must flat enough for a large field value where the inflaton potential energy is as large as the planck scale  @xcite .",
    "if the inflaton potential is too steep for the large field value , inflation is unlikely to take place .",
