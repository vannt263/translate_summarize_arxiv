    "in theories without elementary scalar fields , electroweak symmetry breaking is accomplished through the dynamical generation of fermion masses of order a tev .",
    "this chiral symmetry breaking must somehow be fed down to the lighter quark and lepton masses to produce their mass spectrum .",
    "the original `` extended technicolor '' idea was to accomplish this via broken gauge interactions , with symmetry breaking scales ranging up to @xmath0  tev .",
    "there are two main problems with this idea .",
    "one is that it immediately raises the question of what breaks these new interactions . what plays the role of the order parameter for this breakdown ?",
    "if it is another mass - type order parameter then it must involve new fermions with exotic quantum numbers , since conventional quarks and leptons are not allowed to have mass above the electroweak breaking scale .",
    "the other problem is that the complicated structure of the quark and lepton mass spectrum is directly reflected in the structure of the new gauge interactions .",
    "this led to models having an input structure ( in the form of the symmetry and representation content ) no less complicated than the output structure ( the quark and lepton mass spectrum ) , and basically the whole extended technicolor idea gradually sank under its own weight .",
    "our motivation for the current work comes from the well know fact that there is a much richer set of possible order parameters which may be utilized by a strongly interacting theory , beyond the simple mass - type order parameter .",
    "therefore the order parameters that signal the breakdown of flavor symmetries could actually be constructed out of the known quarks and leptons , due to their participation in strong flavor dynamics at high scales .",
    "the only constraint is that these order parameters respect electroweak symmetry , which in turn ensures that quarks and leptons do not develop masses on these scales and thus remain in the theory below the flavor scale . among such @xmath1 invariant order parameters",
    "are ones involving four fermions .",
    "they will result in effective 4-fermion interactions in the low energy theory , and thus the same order parameters responsible for breaking flavor symmetries can be responsible for feeding down the tev masses to lighter quark and leptons .",
    "the difference from extended technicolor models is that we now have a larger class of possible operators , and the variety in size and structure of these operators must be a reflection of strong dynamics , rather than a reflection of some input structure .",
    "we mention in passing that there are 2-fermion order parameters involving standard quarks and leptons , of the chirality preserving type , which could serve as flavor breaking order parameters .",
    "if right - handed neutrinos are appended to the standard model set of fermions , then a majorana - mass - type order parameter could also be considered . in this work",
    "we shall restrict ourselves to the study of the more diverse set of 4-fermion order parameters , which we shall refer to as ( nonperturbative ) 4-point functions .",
    "we are entertaining the possibility that strong interactions dynamically break various flavor symmetries , but preserve @xmath1 .",
    "for this to happen the gauge interactions may have to be chiral , so that the gauge interactions themselves resist the formation of masses .",
    "for example a competition between different gauge interactions could end up reducing the attraction in the mass channels .",
    "in nonchiral theories as well , it could simply be that the critical coupling required for the formation of a more symmetric 4-point function is less than that for any 2-point function .",
    "in any case we stress that _ any _ strongly interacting theory of flavor above the electroweak scale must preserve @xmath2 . with the neglect of fermion masses the chirality structure of the various 4-point functions will be the focus of our attention , and we often keep the flavor and gauge structures implicit . the chirality structure",
    "is constrained by @xmath1 symmetry and in particular 4-point functions having an odd number of each chirality , such as @xmath3 are excluded .    to illustrate this discussion consider a strong @xmath4 gauge interaction for an even number @xmath5 of massless fermions in the fundamental representation of the gauge group .",
    "the flavor symmetry is @xmath6 .",
    "the chirality preserving 4-point functions can be made invariant under this chiral symmetry , while the chirality changing 4-point functions can not be invariant .",
    "the formation of the latter can still be consistent with a chiral isospin ( or ` electroweak ' ) symmetry and a vector ` family ' symmetry , @xmath7 the corresponding chirality changing 4-point functions have the structure @xmath8 where the upper case superscripts denote family , the lower case superscripts denote isospin and @xmath9 is a @xmath10 anti - symmetric matrix .",
    "an investigation into the nonperturbative generation of 4-point functions requires knowledge of the effective action and gap equations of the 4-point functions .",
    "we use the procedures in @xcite to derive these tools in a general context .",
    "before we present the detailed derivations , we provide an overview which summarizes the derivations .",
    "we will also explore the solutions to the gap equations in the framework of the model of the previous paragraph , in the large @xmath11 limit .",
    "more than three decades ago de dominicis and martin published a set of papers @xcite in which they provide procedures for the derivation of gap equations and effective actions for various @xmath12-point green functions . although their analysis was presented in the framework of non - relativistic statistical physics the procedures can be readily applied to quantum field theory .",
    "we follow their procedure for 4-point functions to derive the effective action and gap equations in the context of gauge theories with massless fermions .",
    "below we review their procedure in its adapted form .",
    "we are only interested in the part of their analysis dealing with 4-point functions .",
    "there are two parts to this procedure , which can be regarded as two independent ways to derive the required gap equations .",
    "one part provides a direct derivation of these equations .",
    "the other part is a derivation of the effective action , from which one can then reproduce the same gap equations by imposing a stationarity condition of the form @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes a 4-point function . although the direct method is perhaps a quicker method to obtain the expressions for the gap equations , it is the other method which actually makes a statement about the vacuum of the theory by showing that these gap equations extremize the effective action .",
    "= 2 cm    the direct method is presented in detail in sec .",
    "the goal is to derive the gap equations for the five 4-point functions as presented in ( [ v6 ] ) .",
    "schematically they are all of the form @xmath15 where @xmath14 is a connected , amputated 4-point function .",
    "the @xmath16 s are sums of bubble chains , shown in fig .",
    "[ chain ] , formed by connecting @xmath14 s through pairs of fermion lines .",
    "there are three different bubble chains because there are three ways to pair off the four external lines of a 4-point function .",

    "the diagrams are also 2-particle irreducible ( 2pi ) since the fermion line represents the full fermion propagator .",
    "we are assuming that the fermion propagator itself does not break any symmetries and in particular is massless .",
    "the main task in the direct derivation of the gap equations is to find the expressions for the @xmath16 s in terms of the @xmath14 s ; here we sketch the procedure .",
    "we require the following definition :  when a 4-point diagram can not be separated into two parts where each part has a pair of the original external lines , by cutting two internal fermion lines , the 4-point diagram is said to be _ simple _ with respect to this particular pairing of external lines .",
    "the sum of all 4-point diagrams that are simple with respect to one specific pairing of external lines is denoted by @xmath20 .",
