    "one of the most challenging problems in modern physics is the unification of the gravitational interaction with other known interactions in nature .",
    "many attempts , from early kaluza - klein theory  @xcite to present supergravity and superstring theories , all involve going to higher dimensions and postulating the existence of extra spatial dimensions .",
    "the modern view regarding these postulated extra dimensions is that they are a physical reality , rather than merely a technical intermediate device for obtaining rather complicated four - dimensional theories from simpler lagrangians in higher dimensions .",
    "if these extra dimensions really exist , one must explain why they are not seen .",
    "the usual answer is that they curl into an extremely small compactified manifold , possibly as small as the planck length scale , @xmath0 cm .",
    "therefore low - energy physics should be insensitive to them until distances of the compactification scale are being probed .",
    "in general , one has the possibility of observing the presence of the extra dimensions in a scattering experiment in which energies greater than that associated with the compactification scale are achieved .",
    "various upper bounds have been put on the size of possible extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "for example , an upper bound of @xmath1 1 tev was given in orbifold compactifications of superstrings @xcite .",
    "however , if only gravity propagates in the extra dimensions , the upper bound can be much larger .",
    "a recent proposal is that the fundamental scale of quantum gravity can be as low as few tev and the observed weakness of gravity is the result of large extra dimensions in which only gravity can propagate @xcite .",
    "this scenario could be realized in the context of several string models @xcite in which one has a set of three - branes ( 3 + 1 dimensional spacetime ) in the entire spacetime with extra dimensions .",
    "the standard model particles are confined to one of the branes , while gravitons propagate freely in the entire bulk .",
    "the size of extra dimensions could then be as large as 1 mm in this type of model .",
    "extra dimensions of sufficiently large size may manifest themselves in particle colliders@xcite and in the possible deviation from newton s law at short distances@xcite , and they may also have implications in gauge unification@xcite and cosmology@xcite .    however , a question arises naturally as to whether there are any lower bounds on the sizes of extra dimensions .",
    "it is the common belief that the existence of extra dimensions has no effect on low - energy physics as long as they are extremely small .",
    "recently , we have argued that this is not the case , because of lightcone fluctuations arising from the quantum gravitational vacuum fluctuations due to compactification of spatial dimensions  @xcite .",
    "an explicit calculation was carried out in the five - dimensional prototypical kaluza - klein model which showed that the periodic compactification of the extra spatial dimensions gives rise to stochastic fluctuations in the apparent speed of light which grow as the compactification scale decreases and are in principle observable .",
    "basically , the smaller the size of the compactified dimensions , the larger are the fluctuations that result .",
    "this is closely related to the casimir effect , the vacuum energy occurring whenever boundary conditions are imposed on a quantum field .",
    "the gravitational casimir energy in the five - dimensional case with one compactified spatial dimension was studied in @xcite , where a nonzero energy density was found , which tends to make the extra dimension contract .",
    "this raises the question of stability of the extra dimensions .",
    "it is possible , however , that the casimir energy arising from the quantum gravitational field and other matter fields may be made to cancel each other  @xcite , thus stabilizing the extra dimensions .",
    "quantum lightcone fluctuations due to the compactification of spatial dimensions  @xcite , although similar in nature to the casimir effect , come solely from gravitons . hence , no similar cancellation is to be expected .    in an earlier work @xcite , we examined lightcone fluctuation in a five - dimensional model with periodic compactification .",
    "we found that there seem to be observable effects which essentially rule out this model .",
    "that is , we derived a lower bound on the compactification scale which is larger than upper bounds derived from other considerations .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is threefold : to further develop the basic formalism , to provide more details of the five - dimensional calculation , and to extend the analysis to some higher dimensional models .    in section",
    "ii , we give a brief review of the formalism , discuss the observability of lightcone fluctuations , and derive the graviton two - point functions in the transverse tracefree gauge for spacetimes with an arbitrary number of dimensions ( detailed calculations will given in the appendix ) . in section iii",
    ", we examine light cone fluctuations in spacetimes with extra dimensions periodically compactified into a torus .",
    "the five - dimensional prototypical kaluza - klein model , of which some results have already been reported , will be studied in great detail .",
    "higher dimensions up through 11 will also be discussed .",
    "section iv deals with light cone fluctuations in the brane - world scenario , as motivated by a recent proposal of extra dimensions of macroscopic size .",
    "we will summarize and conclude in section v.",
    "to begin , let us examine a @xmath2 dimensional spacetime with @xmath3 extra dimensions . consider a flat background spacetime with a linearized perturbation @xmath4 propagating upon it , so the spacetime metric may be written as @xmath5 where the indices @xmath6 run through @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath8 be one half of the squared geodesic distance between a pair of spacetime points @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and @xmath11 be the corresponding quantity in the flat background . in the presence of a linearized metric perturbation , @xmath4",
    ", we may expand @xmath12 here @xmath13 is first order in @xmath4 .",
    "if we quantize @xmath4 , then quantum gravitational vacuum fluctuations will lead to fluctuations in the geodesic separation , and therefore induce lightcone fluctuations .",
    "in particular , we have @xmath14 , since @xmath13 becomes a quantum operator when the metric perturbations are quantized .",
    "the quantum lightcone fluctuations give rise to stochastic fluctuations in the speed of light , which may produce an observable time delay or advance @xmath15 in the arrival times of pulses .      here",
    ", we shall discuss how light cone fluctuations characterized by @xmath16 are related to physical observable quantities .",
    "for this purpose , let us consider the propagation of light pulses between a source and a detector separated by a distance @xmath17 on a flat background with quantized linear perturbations .",
    "for a pulse which is delayed or advanced by time @xmath15 , which is much less than @xmath17 , one finds = _ 0+_1+ .... =12[(r+t)^2-r^2]rt .",
    "[ eq : separation ] square the above equation and take the average over a given quantum state of gravitons @xmath18 ( e.g. the vacuum states associated with compactification of spatial dimensions ) , t_^2=| _ 1 ^ 2 |r^2 .",

    "note that we can also get this result from the gravitational quantum average of the retarded green s function @xmath24 when @xmath25@xcite .",
    "therefore , the root - mean - squared deviation from the classical propagation time is given by t_obs= r. [ eq : mdt ]    at this point , a question may arise as to whether the formal procedure of taking the absolute value in deriving the relation between @xmath15 and @xmath26 , eq .",

    "this is essentially the same as eq .",
    "( [ eq : mdt ] ) , apart from a dimensionless factor of order unity .",
    "we should note that there may be other ways to define the quartic operator , @xmath29 .",
    "one possibility is to let @xmath30 , provided that the integrals involved can be defined .",
    "both of these definitions were discussed in ref .",
    "there it was found in some model cases that the two definitions yield the same result , apart from numerical factors of order unity , which are not important for the present purposes .",
    "note that @xmath15 is the ensemble averaged deviation , not necessarily the expected variation in flight time , @xmath31 , of two pulses emitted close together in time .",
    "the latter is given by @xmath15 only when the correlation time between successive pulses is less than the time separation of the pulses .",
    "this can be understood physically as due to the fact that the gravitational field may not fluctuate significantly in the interval between the two pulses .",
    "this point is discussed in detail in ref .",
    "these stochastic fluctuations in the apparent velocity of light arising from quantum gravitational fluctuations are in principle observable , since they may lead to a spread in the arrival times of pulses from distant astrophysical sources , or the broadening of the spectral lines .",

    ".    now we wish to discuss the rather subtle issue of the relation of lightcone fluctuations to lorentz symmetry .",
    "it is sometimes argued that lightcone fluctuations are incompatible with lorentz invariance .",
    "the most dramatic illustration of this arises when a time advance occurs , that is , when a pulse propagates outside of the classical lightcone . in a lorentz invariant theory , there will exist a frame of reference in which the causal order of emission and detection is inverted , so the pulse is seen to be detected before it was emitted .",
    "thus the lightcone fluctuation phenomenon , if it is to exist at all , seems to be incompatible with strict lorentz invariance .",
    "our view of the situation is the following : lightcone fluctuations respect lorentz symmetry on the average , but not in individual measurements .",
    "the symmetry on the average insures that the mean lightcone be that of classical minkowski spacetime .",

    "( the fact that the @xmath56 schwarzschild spacetime has a naked singularity at @xmath57 need not concern us . for the purpose of this model , we can confine our discussion to a region where @xmath58 ) suppose that this ensemble has @xmath59 , but @xmath60 .",
    "it is well known that light propagation in a @xmath61 schwarzschild spacetime can exhibit a time delay relative to what would be expected in flat spacetime .",
    "this is the basis for the time delay tests of general relativity using radar signals sent near the limb of the sun . in the present model , however , the time difference is equally likely to be a time advance rather than a time delay .",
    "a measurement of the time difference amounts to a measurement of @xmath55 .",
    "this model is lorentz invariant on the average because @xmath59 and the average spacetime is minkowskian .",
    "however , a specific measurement selects a particular member of the ensemble , which is generally not lorentz invariant .",
    "in addition to the fact that the mean metric is minkowskian , there is another sense in which lightcone fluctuations due to compactification exhibit average lorentz invariance .",
    "note that @xmath62 , and hence @xmath15 , depends on the riemann tensor correlation function @xmath63 , which is invariant under lorentz boosts along the @xmath9-axis .",
    "thus if we were to repeat the above calculations of @xmath62 in a second frame moving with respect to the first , the result will be the same . in both cases",
    "one is assuming that the detector is at rest relative to the source .",
    "this is a reflection of the lorentz invariance of the spectrum of fluctuations , which is exhibited by the compactified flat spacetimes studied in this paper , but not by the schwarzschild spacetime with a fluctuating mass .",
    "we shall use a quantization of the linearized gravitational perturbations @xmath4 which retains only physical degrees of freedom .",
