    "the observed filamentary distribution of the large scale structure in the universe , which are often called the cosmic web , have so far motivated plenty of works . after the ingenious breakthrough made by @xcite",
    ", a theoretical framework has been provided within which the characteristic properties of the cosmic web can be explained qualitatively in terms of the tidal influences in the universe dominated by the cold dark matter ( cdm ) .",
    "the influence of the tidal forces on the orientations and distributions of the large scale structure has been a target of many fruitful studies which either numerically or observationally proved that the tidal effect is strongest near the pancakes .",
    "a pancake refers to the two - dimensional sheet - like structure in the universe , which form through gravitational collapse along the local tidal field .",
    "the first order lagrangian perturbation theory , the zeldovich approximation @xcite , is probably the most popular model for the pancake formation which was originally suggested assuming the hot dark matter ( hdm ) dominated universe .",
    "the cosmic web theory , however , showed brilliantly that the presence of pancakes are also very possible in the cdm - dominated universe due to the large scale coherence of the tidal field .",
    "n - body simulations of cdm particles indeed demonstrated that the first collapsed objects look like pancakes @xcite .",
    "the large - scale coherence of the tidal field that is responsible for the formation of pancakes in turn causes the dark matter halos near or on the pancakes to have strong spatial correlations in the orientations @xcite .",
    "the reason that the degree of the tidally induced alignments is highest near the pancakes can be understood given the fact that the pancakes are the first collapsed objects , being still in linear regime while the filaments are more severely modified by the nonlinear process .",
    "the formation of pancakes induces not only the spatial correlations in the halo orientations but also the anisotropy in the velocity field . in our previous paper (",
    "* hereafter ,",
    "nl06 ) , we have for the first time detected a @xmath4 significant signal of the velocity anisotropy induced by the pancaking effect in the high - resolution n - body simulation . in spite that the signal is found to be very weak because of the non - conserved nature of the velocity field , the velocity anisotropy holds a crucial key to understanding the pancaking effect on the structure formation .    in the light of the first detection of nl06 ,",
    "a couple of questions naturally arise : when does the pancaking effect influence most dominantly the formation of dark halos ? ;",
    "how does the pancake scale change with time ? ; what are the implications and consequences of the pancaking effect on the structure formation ? ; is the standard theory capable of quantifying the velocity anisotropy ? .",
    "our goal here is to provide answers to these questions .",
    "we organize this paper as follows . in  2",
    ", we introduce the analyzing method to investigate the evolution of the pancaking effect in the millennium simulation .",
    "we describe analytic modeling and compare it with the results obtained in the simulation catalog in  3 .",
    "finally , we discuss and conclude the results .",
    "to investigate the evolution of local pancaking effect , we use the millennium run simulation halo catalogs for the concordance @xmath0cdm cosmology @xcite .",
    "a periodic box of this simulation is @xmath5mpc on each side and the cosmological parameters are @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 .",
    "we choose four different redshift catalogs , approximately @xmath1 , and @xmath10 among 64 output times of the simulation .",
    "then we analyze the alignments of dark - matter halo velocities to the local pancake plane in each catalog .",
    "basically , to find a local pancake , we follow the methodology suggested by nl06 .    as a first step in measurement ,",
    "we select the halos which contain more than @xmath11 particles ( the left column of table [ tab : num ] ) since those halos in millennium run catalog which have too low particle numbers ( less than @xmath12 ) are poorly sampled and severely contaminated by the numerical noise . in other words , only those halos which have enough particles to define a halo density profile are reliable ( v. springel in private communication ) .",
    "thus , we set the particle number cut - off at 50 .",
    "next , among the selected halos , we pick out field halos which are still in quasi - linear regime by using the method suggested by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the number of identified field halos is shown in the right column of table [ tab : num ] .",
    "the field halos are suited for our purpose because they may not be seriously affected by gravitational forces of many other halos , retaining their initial conditions at the moment that they collapsed .    using only those field halos , we determine local pancakes using the practical methods proposed by nl06 .",
    "first , we find two nearest field halos for a field halo and define a local pancake plane enclosing all the three halos . here",
    ", the local pancakes are found by changing the criterion distance @xmath13 from @xmath14 @xmath15mpc to @xmath16 @xmath15mpc which is a lower limit of @xmath17 , the displacement vector to the first nearest halo .",
    "in other words , @xmath13 satisfies the following condition : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the displacement vector to the second nearest neighbor .    with the determined local pancakes ,",
    "then we calculate the alignment angles between a halo velocity vector and a vector normal to the local pancake plane , @xmath20 .",
    "finally , we obtain the probability density distribution of @xmath20 , @xmath21 , by counting the number of halos in each bin of @xmath20 .",
    "we note that in order to examine the dependence of the particle number cut - off which is used when we determine the halos , we recalculate the velocity - pancake alignment for those halos which include more than @xmath12 particles though low - particle number halos suffer from simulation noise . from this calculation , we obtain almost perfectly consistent results with the results of the catalog in which halos include more than @xmath11 particles as can be seen in fig . [",
    "fig : pro ] ( particle number cut - off is @xmath11 ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : pro30 ] ( particle number cut - off is @xmath12 ) .",
    "thus , the velocity - pancake alignment is not affected by the choice of particle number cut - off .",
    "figure [ fig : pro ] shows @xmath21 with poissonian error .",
    "the three columns correspond to three different cases of @xmath22 , and @xmath10 , respectively , and the three rows to three different scales of @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "the horizontal dotted line in each panel represents a random distribution . as can be seen in the right column , when @xmath13 is @xmath14 , the halo velocity tends to be slightly aligned with the normal to the local pancake plane at @xmath2 .",
    "this tendency becomes stronger as @xmath13 increases to @xmath25mpc .",
    "it can be interpreted that the local pancaking effect arises at least around @xmath26 . meanwhile , at @xmath27 , for the case of @xmath28 , there is no alignment .",
    "then local pancaking effect starts to be visible near @xmath29mpc .",
    "moreover , as one can see in the left column , when @xmath28 at @xmath30 , the halo velocity does not tend to be aligned with the normal to the local pancake plane any more . rather it tends to lie on the plane .",
    "the alignment signal begins to be seen when @xmath13 is approximately @xmath25mpc .",
    "we infer from these phenomena that the pancaking effect disappears since the gravitational attraction forces from the close neighbor halos affect halo velocities rather than the initial pancaking effect .",
    "therefore , we find the velocity - pancake alignments are strongest at @xmath31 , indicating that the pancaking effect starts at @xmath32 .",
    "we refer that we do not make more analysis of the velocity - pancake alignments for higher redshift to find a redshift at which pancaking effect starts since the number of halos decreases rapidly as redshift increases .",
    "even if the value of @xmath33 itself might increase , the value of @xmath34 which is inversely proportional to the number of halos would increase .",
    "thus , it would be hard to determine precisely at which redshift both the values of @xmath33 and @xmath34 reach maximums .",
    "figure [ fig : his ] plots the average of @xmath20 at four different @xmath35 , and @xmath10 as a function of linear characteristic pancake scale , @xmath36 .",
    "we refer that @xmath36 is defined as the average distance between the center of mass ( cm ) for three halos on the local pancake plane to all the three halos , which was proposed by nl06 .",
    "the horizontal dotted line in each panel represents @xmath37 of random distribution of the angles .",
    "as one can see in each panel , there is a specific range of @xmath36 where @xmath37 is relatively higher than those at the other pancake scales .",
    "this specific range implies local pancaking effect significantly occurs on specific pancake scale .",
    "comparing to panels each other , overall @xmath37 increases , its slope is steeper and the specific range shifts to small @xmath36 when going to high redshift .",
    "this tendency can be clearly seen when we see that the regions of filled with oblique lines , which represent the area consisting of a few of the highest values , move to small @xmath36 as going to high redshift .",
    "more quantitatively , the peak value is approximately @xmath38 at @xmath30 while the one is @xmath39 at @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , the peak position of histogram is approximately @xmath40mpc at @xmath30 whereas the one is @xmath41mpc at @xmath2 .",
    "this gradual change with redshifts can be understood the same way as fig .",
    "[ fig : pro ] ; after pancaking effect on halo velocities arises , it is gradually attenuated by gravitational force among halos , especially among very close halos .",
    "in order to investigate the tendency of the anisotropic distribution of halo velocity theoretically , we construct an analytic model using the similar methodology to @xcite .",
    "we begin on the zeldovich approximation @xcite @xmath42 which intrinsically estimates the formation of pancakes . here , @xmath43 is the eulerian coordinate , @xmath44 is the lagrangian coordinate , @xmath45 is the linear velocity potential and @xmath46 is the growth factor , @xmath47^{3}}.\\ ] ] by taking the time derivative of zeldovich approximation , we obtain equation of the velocity of cosmic particle smoothed on pancake scale , @xmath48 equation ( [ eq : xdot ] ) is appropriate to investigate pancaking effect on halo velocity at early stage since equation ( [ eq : zel ] ) describes initial state of non - linear evolution . also , we assume the density field is smoothed on the pancake scale , which is valid in this approximation because this approximation is available in the regime preceding the moment of the collapse to a pancake .    using a similar logic given by @xcite who found an expression for the alignments between the tidal field and the halo position vectors , we take into account nonlinear effects into equation ( [ eq : xdot ] ) , and write an expression for the velocity alignments with the tidal field as @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are tidal shear tensor and its time derivative , respectively .",
    "@xmath52 is time derivative of @xmath53 , which is @xmath54,\\\\ \\label{eq : dhda } \\textrm{where}\\quad h'(a)&=&\\frac{dh(a)}{da}=-\\frac{3}{2}\\omega_{m}a^{-4}(\\omega_{m } a^{-3}+\\omega_{\\lambda})^{-1/2 } , \\quad { \\dot a}=ah_{0}(\\omega_{m}a^{-3}+\\omega_{\\lambda})^{1/2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] notice that @xmath33 is a value in @xmath55 $ ] .",
    "if @xmath33 is @xmath56 , it represents a perfect correlation between local pancaking and halo velocity while if @xmath33 is @xmath14 , it means there is no correlation between them . in velocity - velocity correlation , it is unlikely that the value of @xmath33 is close to unity since the velocity of a halo is not a conserved quantity and initial memory of local pancaking effect on velocity have been reduced . in order to show that the velocities of halos are not completely random but has some degree of alignments with the normal vectors to the local pancakes",
    "though the value of @xmath33 is expected to be very small , we have calculated the error on the value of @xmath33 , that is , the standard deviation of @xmath33 for the case of no alignment .",
    "the formula for the error of @xmath33 , @xmath34 is given as @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the total number of halos @xcite .",
    "with defined error , if @xmath33 is larger than @xmath59 , one can say that there is a signal of true local pancaking effect .",
    "we diagonalize equation ( [ eq : velcor ] ) by applying the relation referred by @xcite @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are an eigenvalue of the @xmath63 and its time derivative , respectively .",
    "thus , equation ( [ eq : k ] ) is changed to @xmath64^{2 } } { ( 1-d\\lambda_{i})^{2}},\\quad k_{ij}=0 \\ ; ( i\\ne j).\\ ] ] the eigenvalues @xmath61 are ordered by @xmath65 .    to obtain the probability distribution ,",
    "we assume probability density distribution of the alignment angles , @xmath20 , is gaussian @xcite @xmath66v^{2}dv,\\ ] ] where @xmath67 .",
    "finally , we can express the probability distribution of @xmath20 , @xmath68 is , @xmath69 here , @xmath70 .    to compare with the results from simulation analysis , we use @xmath0cdm cosmological parameters , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath71k , @xmath72 , @xmath6 , which are the same values as the parameters used in millennium simulation .",
    "first , we calculate @xmath73 by using following equation : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is a growth function , @xmath76 is primordial power spectrum that is @xmath77 , @xmath78 is transfer function @xcite and @xmath79 is spherical top - hat window function .",
    "when evaluating equation ( [ eq : sig ] ) , we use @xmath36 obtained by simulation analysis for @xmath80 . also , the redshift at which @xmath36 is determined in the simulation is chosen as @xmath81 value in equation ( [ eq : sig ] )",
    ".    then we obtain @xmath82 in equation ( [ eq : pden ] ) .",
    "we decide @xmath83 as @xmath56 because @xmath84 means the formation of the structure like a pancake in the zeldovich approximation , @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the mean density of the universe and @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) are the eigenvalues of the local tidal field , @xmath63 . for @xmath89 and @xmath90",
    ", we choose the most probable values of the following probability distribution , @xmath91 here , @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the probability distribution derived by @xcite and @xcite : @xmath94.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we put these eigenvalues in equation ( [ eq : kdiag ] ) to obtain the normalized eigenvalues , @xmath95 .",
    "finally , we fit theoretical estimation of @xmath21 , equation ( [ eq : prob ] ) , to the numerical results as adjusting a correlation parameter @xmath33 in equation ( [ eq : prob ] ) .",
    "we determine @xmath33 minimizing @xmath96 distribution @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 are the values from simulation analysis and from theory , respectively and @xmath100 is the poissonian error from simulation analysis .",
    "the comparison numerical results with theory is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : the ] .",
    "the filled circle points represent the numerically measured @xmath21 with poissonian errors and solid line represents the analytic distribution .",
    "as can be seen in the figure , the simulation data points are in good agreement with our analytic formulation .",
    "also , as shown in table [ tab : eta ] , the strength of local pancaking effect on the halo velocity depends on the redshift . at @xmath2 , though halos are closely located at each other like @xmath29mpc , @xmath33 is @xmath101 , which turns out to be @xmath102 ( see table [ tab : eta ] ) .",
    "thus , even though the value of @xmath33 is much less than unity , it is definitely a strong signal of velocity - pancake alignments , exceeding @xmath103 times the standard deviation , @xmath34 .",
    "this strong signal which approximately amounts to @xmath104 shows the existence of the velocity - pancake alignment .",
    "even when @xmath28 at @xmath2 , @xmath33 is @xmath105 which is @xmath106 which indicates that a pancaking effect appears even at @xmath28 .",
    "then going to present epoch , the effect is reduced by gravitational attraction .",
    "finally , at @xmath30 , when @xmath13 is @xmath107mpc , @xmath33 is almost @xmath14 and @xmath34 is also @xmath14 .",
    "in addition , as one can see the tendency in fig .",
    "[ fig : the ] and in table [ tab : eta ] , at @xmath2 , pancaking effect becomes stronger as @xmath13 is approximately @xmath108mpc and then @xmath33 and @xmath34 gradually decreases when @xmath13 is larger than @xmath25mpc . in other words ,",
    "the value of @xmath33 and @xmath34 at @xmath2 is the largest with @xmath109 .",
    "a similar tendency also appears at different redshifts , instead the range of @xmath13 is shifted to larger scale caused by the expansion of the universe .",
    "thus , we analytically find that there is a specific range of pancake scale where pancaking significantly affects halo velocity .",
    "in addition , we show how the pancaking effect changes with different redshifts .",
    "to find the tendency of the redshift dependence of @xmath33 , we fit @xmath33 as a function of redshift to quadratic equation .",
    "the coefficients are shown in table [ tab : fz ] .",
    "figure [ fig : zco ] plots the quadratic fitting function ( dashed line ) and compares it with the simulation data points ( filled circles ) . as fig .",
    "[ fig : zco ] shows , we note that @xmath33 is a function of redshift , in a good agreement with the quadratic equation .",
    "moreover , @xmath33 is a function of the characteristic pancake scale , @xmath36 .",
    "we also fit @xmath110 to quadratic equation which can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : rco ] .",
    "the dashed line and the filled circles represent the fitting function and the data points , respectively .",
    "we can see a good match between the quadratic functional form and the simulation data .",
    "the best - fit coefficients are shown in table [ tab : flp ] .",
    "we analyze the evolution of the pancaking effect by using millennium simulation .",
    "we obtain the signal of the strong alignment between the halo velocity and the normal to the local pancake plane at @xmath26 when characteristic pancake scale is approximately @xmath3mpc .",
    "the alignment signal implies the first collapse of the protocloud may have occurred around @xmath26 and the size of the pancake may have been around @xmath3mpc .",
    "this result is in agreement with @xcite which reports pancakes form at @xmath26 and their masses is approximately @xmath111 .",
    "then as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pro ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : his ] , the alignment signal evolves .",
    "pancaking effect is weakened as going to low redshift , which means the pancaking effect on halo velocity is gradually attenuated by the gravitational attraction among the neighbor halos .",
    "in addition , pancake scale at low redshift is larger than that at high redshift .",
    "we expect the local pancaking effect could be detected in observation",
    ". it may be possible to achieve the signal of the velocity alignment using the velocity data reconstructed from 2mass redshift survey @xcite .",
    "we intend to measure the signal in observation for our future project .",
    "it is interesting to note that the pancakes are expected to have formed coincidentally at @xmath26 when the star formation rate in massive galaxies is the highest @xcite , which is one of the phenomena referred to ` downsizing ' . in ` downsizing ' scenario , the stars in more massive galaxies formed at higher redshift and those in less massive galaxies recently formed , where ` antihierarchy ' can be suggested .",
    "recently , however , @xcite show this phenomenon is natural in hierarchical clustering process .",
    "nevertheless , a coincidence between the pancake formation epoch and the epoch of the heavily star - forming may imply the structure formation is not simply hierarchical but complicated @xcite .",
