    "although the cosmic background radiation ( cbr ) was first discovered over thirty years ago @xcite , the detection of its temperature anisotropy waited until 1992 when the cosmic background explorer ( cobe ) satellite provided its impressive experimental support@xcite for the big bang model .",
    "in particular , the cobe results were consistent with a scale - invariant spectrum of primordial scalar density perturbations@xcite such as might be generated by quantum fluctuations during an inflationary period.@xcite    this discovery of temperature anisotropy in the cbr has inspired many further experiments which will be sensitive to smaller angle anisotropies than the cobe satellite was ( about @xmath3 ) .",
    "nasa has approved the flight of a satellite mission , the microwave anisotropy probe ( map ) in the year 2000 and esa has agreed to a more accurate later experiment called the planck surveyor .",
    "the expected precision of these measurements implies that the angular dependence of the temperature anisotropy will be known sufficiently well that the location of the first accoustic ( doppler ) peak , and possibly subsequent ones , will be resolved .    although the hot big bang theory is supported by at least three major triumphs : the expansion of the universe , the cosmic background radiation and the nucleosynthesis calculations , it leaves unanswered several questions .",
    "the most important unanswered questions are the horizon and flatness issues .    when the cbr last scattered , the age of the universe was about 100,000 years compared to its present age of some 10 billion years . as we shall see , the horizon size at the recombination time subtends now an angle of about @xmath4 of @xmath5 radians . on the celestial sphere",
    "there are therefore approximately 40,000 causally disconnected regions .",
    "nevertheless , these different regions have a uniform cbr temperature to an accuracy of better than one part in @xmath6 .",
    "this is the horizon problem .",
    "the flatness problem may be understood from the cosmological equation @xmath7 evaluating eq.([cos ] ) at an arbitrary time @xmath8 and dividing by the same relation at the present time @xmath9 and using @xmath10 gives @xmath11 for high densities we write @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the radiation constant and g is the effective number of degrees of freedom .",
    "this leads to the relation between time and temperature , after substituting the numerical values [ @xmath14 @xmath15 combining eq.([omega ] ) with eq.([time ] ) leads to @xmath16 given the proximity of @xmath1 to unity , we then deduce that @xmath17 at , for example , @xmath18 ( @xmath19 1second ) must be equal to one within one part in @xmath20 ! otherwise the resultant cosmology will be incompatible with the present situation of our universe .",
    "this extraordinary fine - tuning is the flatness problem .",
    "the goal@xcite of the cbr experiments is to measure the temperature autocorrelation function .",
    "the fractional temperature perturbation as a function of the direction @xmath21 is expanded in spherical harmonics @xmath22 and the statistical isotropy and homogeneity of the universe imply that the coefficients have expectation values @xmath23    the plot of @xmath24 versus @xmath25 is expected to reflect oscillations in the baryon - photon fluid at the surface of last scatter",
    ". in particular , the first doppler peak should be at the postion @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the angle now subtended by the horizon at the time of the last scattering , namely the recombination time corresponding to a red shift @xmath28 .    the horizon and flatness problems described above can both be solved by the inflation scenario which has the further prediction that @xmath29 if the cosmological constant vanishes or more generally that @xmath30 if the cosmological constant does not vanish .",
    "the question we address here is restricted to the question of how much the value of @xmath0 alone - likely to be accurately determined in the next few years - will tell us about the values of the cosmic parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 ?    in section 2 , the case @xmath31 is discussed . in section 3 , there is the more general case ; and finally in section 4 there is discussion of the figures derived .",
    "when the cosmological constant vanishes , the einstein - friedmann cosmological equations can be solved analytically ( not the case , in general , when @xmath33 ) .",
    "so we shall begin by doing this special case explicitly .",
    "it gives rise to the well - known result that the position of the first doppler peak ( partial wave @xmath0 ) expected in the partial - wave analysis depending on the present matter - energy density @xmath1 ( for @xmath34 ) according to @xmath35@xcite .",
    "we shall show in the next section how in the general case with @xmath33 there is a rather serious `` comic confusion '' in disentangling the value of @xmath1 from the position @xmath0 of the first doppler peak .",
    "let us use the metric :    @xmath36 \\label{metric}\\ ] ]    for a geodesic @xmath37 and , in particular , @xmath38 einstein s equation reads @xmath39 where we take curvature @xmath40 .",
    "let us define : @xmath41 then from eq.([einstein ] ) we find that @xmath42 and so it follows that @xmath43 since @xmath44 , the value at time @xmath8 can be computed from the integral @xmath45 this can be performed easily with the substitution @xmath46 to give the result : @xmath47 > from eq.([einstein ] ) evaluated at @xmath9 we see that @xmath48 and so , using @xmath49 in eq.([psi ] ) gives now @xmath50 the position of the first doppler peak depends on the angle subtended by the horizon size at the time @xmath8 equal to the recombination time .",
    "this corresponds to the distance @xmath51 . according to the metric of eq.([metric ] )",
    "the angle subtended is @xmath52 and the position of the first doppler peak corresponds to the partial wave @xmath0 given by @xmath53 now the red - shift at recombination is about @xmath54 so we may approximate in eq.([sinh ] ) to find @xmath55 using @xmath56 gives @xmath57 in particular , if @xmath29 and @xmath34 , one has @xmath58 .",
    "if @xmath0 does have this value empirically it will favor this simplest choice , although as we shall see in the following subsection even here the conclusion has ambiguities .    in fig .",
    "1 we plot @xmath0 versus @xmath1 for the particular case of @xmath59 .",
    "for the general case of @xmath61 we use the more general einstein cosmological equation : @xmath62 where @xmath63 . we define @xmath64 substituting @xmath65 and @xmath66",
    "now gives rise to the integral@xcite for @xmath67 @xmath68 in which @xmath69 .",
    "consider first the case of an open universe @xmath70 .",
    "then @xmath71    we know that @xmath72\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since @xmath73 we may approximate : @xmath74 and hence @xmath75 it follows that for this case @xmath70 that @xmath76 for the case @xmath77 we simply replace @xmath78 by @xmath79 in eq .",
    "( [ l1c+ ] ) . finally , for the special case @xmath80 , the generalized flat case favored by inflationary cosmologies , eq.([l1c+ ] ) simplifies to : @xmath81 in fig .",
    "2 we plot the value of @xmath0 versus @xmath1 for the case @xmath80 ( flat spacetime ) .",
    "the contrast with fig 1 is clear : whereas @xmath0 increases with decreasing @xmath1 when @xmath82 ( fig .",
    "1 ) the opposite behaviour occurs when we constrain @xmath83 ( fig.2 ) .",
    "with @xmath1 and @xmath2 unrestricted there are more general results . in fig .",
    "3 , we display iso - l lines on a @xmath84 plot .",
    "the iso - l lines are ( from right to left ) for the values @xmath85 respectively .",
    "one can see that from the _",
    "position_(@xmath0 ) only of the first doppler peak there remains a serious ambiguity of interpretation without further information .    in fig , 4 ,",
    "there is a three dimensional rendition of the value of @xmath0 versus the two variables @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "let us now turn to an interpretation of our figures , from the point of view of determining the cosmic parameters .    in the case where @xmath86 , fig.1 .",
    "is sufficient . in this case , there is the well - known dependence@xcite @xmath87 illustrated in fig.1",
    ". it would be straightforward to determine @xmath1 with an accuracy of a few percent from the upcoming measurements .",
    "of course there is a strong theoretical prejudice towards @xmath31 . but no underlying symmetry principle is yet known .",
    "if @xmath88 , one knows that it is not bigger than order one ; this is very many orders of magnitude smaller than expected@xcite from the vacuum energy arising in spontaneous breaking of symmetries such as the electroweak group @xmath89 .",
    "nevertheless , recent observations of high redshift type 1a supernovae have led to the suggestion of an _ increasing _ hubble parameter @xcite .",
    "an interpretation of this is that the cosmological constant is non - zero , possibly @xmath90 but is still consistent with @xmath91 .",
    "it should be added that these conclusions are quite controversial and await further verification . but these results are enough to motivate a full consideration of non - zero values of @xmath2 .",
    "thus we come to fig .",
    "2 which depicts the @xmath1 dependence of @xmath0 when @xmath30 is held fixed as in a generalized flat cosmology that could arise from inflation .",
    "we notice that here @xmath0 _ decreases _ as @xmath1 decreases from @xmath29 , the opposite behaviour to fig .",
    "thus even the sign of the shift of @xmath0 from @xmath92 depends on the size of @xmath93 .",
    "it is therefore of interest to find what are the contours of constant @xmath0 in the @xmath84 plane .",
    "these iso - l lines are shown in fig . 3 for @xmath94 in increments @xmath95 .",
    "if we focus on the @xmath96 contour ( the seventh contour from the left in fig .",
    "3 ) as an example , we see that while this passes close to the @xmath97 point it also tracks out a line naturally between those shown in figs . 1 and 2 ( actually somewhat closer to the latter than the former ) .",
    "our main conclusion is that the position @xmath0 of the first doppler peak will define the correct contour in our iso - l plot , fig .",
    "3 . more information will be necessary to determine @xmath1 and the validity of inflation .",
