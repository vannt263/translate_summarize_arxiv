    "nowadays , the use of chiral symmetry in low - energy pion - interactions is justified by @xmath5 .",
    "the small masses of the quarks @xmath6 and @xmath7 , treated as perturbations in a chiral symmetric lagrangian , give rise to a well defined chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) .",

    "drift corrections begin at @xmath12 and , in principle , should be smaller than the spin - orbit terms , which begin at @xmath16 .",
    "however , in this channel , the hierarchy is again not respected .",
    "the leading term in the three - nucleon potential , known as @xmath14-@xmath44 , has long range and corresponds to the process shown in fig.1c , in which a pion is emitted by one of the nucleons , scattered by a second one , and absorbed by the last nucleon .",
    "is this case , the intermediate @xmath4 amplitude , which is @xmath45 for free pions , becomes @xmath19 and the three - body force begins at @xmath16 .",
    "the first modern version of this component of the force was produced by fujita and miyazawa@xcite , its chiral structure has bee much debated since the seventies@xcite and , nowadays , a sort o consensus has been reached about its form@xcite .",

    "the evaluation of @xmath12 corrections requires the inclusion of single loop effects and is associated with a large number of diagrams , which are being calculated by epelbaum and collaborators@xcite . in order to produce a feeling for the structure of these corrections , we discuss a particular set of processes belonging to the @xmath14-@xmath44 class , considered recently@xcite .",
    "full results involve expressions which are too long and cumbersome to be displayed here .",
    "however , their main qualitative features can be summarized in the structure @xmath49 $ ] , where @xmath50 is the leading term shown above and the factors within square brackets are chpt corrections .",
    "the function @xmath51 can be obtained directly from @xmath50 , by replacing @xmath52 , where the @xmath53 indicate changes smaller than @xmath54 .",
    "this part of the chpt correction corresponds just to shifts in the parameters of the leading component .",
    "the term @xmath55 , on the other hand , represents effects associated with new mathematical functions involving both non - local operators and complicated propagators containg loop integrals , in place of the yukawa functions .",
    "the strengths of these new functions are determined by a new set of parameters @xmath56 , which are also typically about @xmath54 of the leading ones .    in summary",
    ", chpt gives rise both to small changes in already existing coefficients and to the appearance of many new mathematical structures .",
    "the latter are the most interesting ones , since they may be instrumental in explaining effects such as the @xmath57 puzzle .",
    "chiral symmetry has already been applied to about 20 components of nuclear forces , allowing a comprehensive picture to be assessed . according to chpt",
    ", the various effects begin to appear at different orders and the predicted hierarchy is displayed in the table below .     & @xmath2 & @xmath37 & @xmath37 + @xmath13 & @xmath58 & & + @xmath19 & @xmath59 & @xmath60 & + @xmath16 & & @xmath61 & @xmath62 + @xmath12 & & @xmath63 & @xmath64 +    in ref . , the relative importance of @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 terms in each component of the @xmath37-@xmath68 has been studied . in general , convergence at distances of physical interest is satisfactory , except for @xmath34 , where the ratio between @xmath12 and @xmath16 contributions is larger than @xmath69 for distances smaller than @xmath70 fm .",
    "as far as the relative sizes of the various dynamical effects are concerned , one finds strong violations of the predicted hierarchy when one compares @xmath34 with @xmath33 and @xmath43 with @xmath30 , as discussed above .",
    "it is interesting to note that , in both cases , the unexpected enhancements occur in the isoscalar sector .",
    "the numerical explanation for this behavior is that some of the lecs used in the calculation are large and generated dynamically by delta intermediate states .",
    "however , it is also possible that perturbation theory may not apply to isoscalar interactions at intermediate distances .",
    "this aspect of the problem is explored in the next section .",
    "the structure of @xmath34 was scrutinized in ref . and found to be heavily dominated by a term of the form v_c^+(r ) ~- ( 4/f_^2)(c_3 - 2c_1 ) - c_3 ^2/2 _ n_n(r ) , where the @xmath71 are lecs and @xmath72 is the leading contribution from the pion cloud to the nucleon scalar form factor .",
    "this close relationship between @xmath72 and @xmath34 indicates that the study of the former can shed light into the properties of the latter .",
    "the nucleon scalar form factor is defined as n(p ) | _ sb | n(p ) = _ n(t ) ( p ) u(p ) ,    where @xmath73 is the symmetry breaking lagrangian .",
    "it has already been expanded@xcite up to @xmath12 and receives its leading @xmath19 contribution from a tree diagram associated with the lec @xmath74 .",
    "corrections at @xmath16 and @xmath12 are produced by two triangle diagrams , involving nucleon and delta intermediate states . in configuration space@xcite , the scalar form factor",
    "is denoted by @xmath75 and one writes _",
    "n ( ) = - 4 c_1 ^2 ^3 ( ) + _ n_n(r ) + _ n_(r ) ,    where @xmath72 and @xmath76 are the finite - range triangle contributions .",
    "the symmetry breaking lagrangian can be expressed in terms of the chiral angle @xmath77 as @xmath78 .",
    "the ratio @xmath79 describes the density of the @xmath80 condensate around the nucleon and is displayed in fig .",
    "one notes that it vanishes at large distances and increases monotonically as one approaches the center .",
    "this means that the function @xmath81 becomes meaningless beyond a critical radius @xmath82 , corresponding to @xmath83 , since the physical interpretation of the quark condensate requires the condition @xmath84 . in ref . , the condensate was assumed to no longer exist in the region @xmath85 and the @xmath4 sigma - term was evaluated using the expression _",
    "n = r^3 f_^2 ^2 + 4_r^drr^2_n ( ) .    this procedure yields 43 mev@xmath8649 mev , depending on the value adopted for the @xmath87 coupling constant , in agreement with the empirical value 45@xmath88 mev .",
    "this picture of the nucleon scalar form factor is sound and can be used to gain insight about @xmath34 .    inspecting fig .",
    "[ f7 ] ( right ) , one learns that the hierarchy predicted by chpt is subverted for distances smaller than 1.5 fm , since the @xmath12 delta becomes more important than the @xmath16 nucleon .",
    "on the other hand , the good prediction obtained for the nucleon @xmath89-term ( and also for the @xmath90 @xmath89-term@xcite ) indicates that the functions @xmath91 and @xmath92 can be trusted up to the critical radius @xmath93  0.6  fm . just outside this radius ,",
    "the chiral angle is close to @xmath94 , indicating that the pion cloud is non - perturbative in that region .",
    "this picture is supported by fig .",
    "[ f5 ] ( right ) since , at least up to 1 fm , the prediction for @xmath34 agrees well with the argonne phenomenological potentials .",
    "this leads to our main conclusion , namely that the range of validity of calculations based on nucleon and delta intermediate states is wider that that predicted by chpt .",
