    "it is possible to project the random walk into @xmath3 by choosing a base - point and then using the action of @xmath2 .",
    "they showed that if the subgroup of @xmath2 generated by the support of @xmath7 is non - elementary , then almost every sample path converges to some uniquely ergodic foliation in @xmath0 .",
    "this means that there is a well defined hitting measure @xmath8 on @xmath0 coming from the random walk .",
    "moreover , the measure @xmath8 is a harmonic measure in the sense that if @xmath9 is a measurable set of @xmath0 then @xmath10    complete train tracks on @xmath1 define an atlas of charts on the space @xmath11 of measured foliations on @xmath1 .",
    "the set of integer weights on a train track correspond to mutli - curves on @xmath1 carried by it .",
    "so the transition functions between charts have to preserve the integer weights . as a result , even though this process does not necessarily give , after projectivization , a global _ lebesgue _ measure on @xmath0 , there is still a well - defined lebesgue measure class .",

    "the proof of the theorem works by actually constructing a singular set for @xmath8 i.e. a measurable set in @xmath0 that has full lebesgue measure and zero harmonic measure .",
    "conversely , one can ask if there is a lebesgue measure @xmath12 on @xmath0 such that @xmath12 is a harmonic measure for some initial distribution ? if it exists , the distribution has infinite support as a corollary to our theorem .",

    "prove the key measure theory result that we exploit in the construction of the singular set . in section  [ torus ]",
    ", we explain the construction of the singular set in the special case of the torus , and indicate how the construction should generalize . in the process , we introduce the techniques of classical interval exchanges . in section  [ niem ] ,",

    "the group of orientation preserving diffeomorphisms of @xmath1 that preserve the set of punctures modulo those isotopic to identity , is called the mapping class group of @xmath1 . throughout",
    ", we shall denote the mapping class group by @xmath2 .",
    "the space of marked conformal structures on @xmath1 modulo biholomorphisms isotopic to identity is called the teichmller space of @xmath1 . by the uniformization theorem ,",
    "modulo isometries isotopic to identity , there is a unique marked hyperbolic metric in each marked conformal class .",
    "this means that the teichmller space can also be thought of as the space of marked hyperbolic metrics on @xmath1 modulo isometries isotopic to identity .",
    "we denote the teichmller space by @xmath3 .",
    "the mapping class group @xmath2 acts on @xmath3 by changing the marking .",
    "it is a classical theorem that topologically , the teichmller space @xmath3 is homeomorphic to an open ball in @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the genus and @xmath6 is the number of punctures of @xmath1 .",
    "thurston showed that @xmath3 can be compactified by the space @xmath0 of projective measured foliations on @xmath1 , such that the action of the mapping class group @xmath2 on @xmath3 extends to a continuous action on the boundary , @xmath0 of @xmath3 .",
    "the space @xmath0 is homeomorphic to a sphere of dimension @xmath16 .",
    "it is also the same as the space of projective measured laminations @xmath17 on the surface by a homeomorphism that is mapping class group equivariant .      a train track on the surface @xmath1 is an embedded 1-dimensional cw complex in which there is a common line of tangency to all the 1-dimensional branches that join at a 0-dimensional switch .",
    "this splits the set of branches incident on a switch into two disjoint subsets , which can be arbitrarily assigned as outgoing edges and incoming edges .",
    "train tracks whose complementary regions are either triangles or once punctured monogons are said to be _",
    "complete_. here , we shall restrict only to complete train tracks .",
    "one can assign non - negative weights to the branches of a train track so that the sum of the weights of the outgoing branches at a switch is equal to the sum of the weights of the incoming branches .",
    "each such choice of weights compatible with the switch conditions , defines a measured foliation on @xmath1 . a measured foliation defined this way is said to be _ carried _ by the train track .",
    "the set of measured foliations carried by a complete train track has the structure of a cone ( i.e. a homogeneous set ) in @xmath18 , over a convex polytope of dimension @xmath16 with finitely many extremal vertices .",
    "moreover , the directions determined by the extremal vertices are rational ; hence we can find a minimal integer point on each of them .",
    "these integer points represent simple closed curves on @xmath1 , and are called the _ vertex cycles _ of the train track . in general ,",
    "integer points in the cone represent multi - curves carried by the train track .",
    "complete train tracks on @xmath1 define an atlas of charts on the space @xmath11 of measured foliations on @xmath1 .",
    "if we choose to projectivize by a normalization , such as the sum of weights is 1 , the transition functions do not preserve this normalization .",
    "so we do not get a global measure on @xmath0 by this process .",
    "however , the transition functions have to preserve the multi - curves i.e the integer points .",
    "hence , there is a well defined measure class on @xmath0 .",

    "the bound for @xmath257 then follows by exploiting the @xmath258-hyperbolicity of the tree . finally , the set @xmath210 is the disjoint union of limit sets of cones for vertices of the form @xmath259 .",
    "so by using the estimate for the cones inductively we get the exponential decay for @xmath260 .",
    "the element @xmath114 as a split of the classical interval exchange on the torus in fig  [ torustrack ] , can be seen to be a dehn twist in the vertex curve given by band 1 .",
    "this vertex curve is the curve with slope @xmath261 in the farey graph of figure  [ dual ] , and @xmath114 acts on @xmath241 as a parabolic element with fixed point @xmath261 .    for the general mapping class groups ,",
    "the action of the reducible elements on @xmath0 , in particular dehn twists , is similar to the action of @xmath114 on @xmath241 .",

    "so the construction of the singular set is essentially similar .",
    "however , because of the issues outlined below , it becomes technically harder in this context to construct the sequence of sets @xmath60 to which proposition  [ bc2 ] is applied , and trickier to prove the above mentioned measure estimates for these sets .    first , a natural class of charts on @xmath0 is obtained from _",

    "this allows us to show that the combinatorics of the initial non - classical interval exchange that we construct , belongs to some attractor .",
    "the rauzy induction which was defined for classical interval exchanges generalizes directly to non - classical interval exchanges . unlike the situation for complete train tracks , for non - classical interval exchanges , the expansions given by repeated rauzy induction uniquely",

    "the second issue is that for the general mapping class groups , the appropriate quasi - isometric models are the marking complexes . unlike @xmath100 which is @xmath258-hyperbolic , the geometry of the marking complex is intricate .",
    "instead , we project the mapping class group random walk to the curve complex .",
    "the combination of the results of kaimanovich - masur and klarreich shows that one does not lose any stochastic information about the random walk in the process .",
    "there are a number of advantages in considering the curve complex : foremost is that the curve complex is @xmath258-hyperbolic ; the coarse negative curvature proves to be very useful in analyzing the projected random walk . secondly ,",
    "in the curve complex , the set of essential simple closed curves carried by a non - classical interval exchange is quasi - convex .",
    "as we shall see , a recent technique due to masur - mosher - schleimer can be utilized to get information about sub - surface projections to annuli that are carried deeply inside this quasi - convex set .",
    "this information enables us to apply the key tool , theorem  [ exp - decay ] of maher , to get the required exponential decay estimate for the harmonic measure .",
    "a train track on the surface is an embedded 1-dimensional cw complex in which there is a common line of tangency to all the 1-dimensional branches that join at a 0-dimensional switch .",
    "this splits the set of branches incident on a switch into two subsets , one of which will be called the set of outgoing edges and the other the set of incoming edges .",
    "we consider only _ large _ train tracks i.e. tracks whose complementary regions in the surface are either ideal polygons with at least 3 cusps or once - punctured polygons .    a _ train route _ is a regular smooth path in the train track .",
    "in particular , a train route traverses a switch only by passing from an incoming edge to an outgoing edge or vice versa .",
    "an essential simple closed curve is said to be _ carried _ by a train track if it is isotopic to a closed train route .",
    "a train track is _ recurrent _ if for every branch there is an essential simple closed curve carried by the track such that it passes through the branch .",
    "similarly , a train track is _ transversely recurrent _ if for every branch there is an essential simple closed curve hitting the train track efficiently ( i.e. the complement of the union of the train track and the curve has no bigons ) such that it intersects the branch at least once . a track that is both recurrent and transversely recurrent",
    "is called _",
    "birecurrent_.    one can assign non - negative weights to the branches so that the sum of the weights of the outgoing branches at a switch is equal to the sum of the weights of the incoming branches . in particular , by counting the number of times a carried multi - curve passes over a branch we get an assignment of integral weights that automatically satisfies the switch conditions . after normalizing",
    "so that the sum of weights is 1 , the set of possible weights on the train track can be identified with a set of projective classes of measured foliations .",
    "these projective classes of measured foliations are said to be _ carried _ by the train track .",
    "a train track is _ maximal _ if it is not a proper subtrack of any other train track .",
    "a maximal birecurrent train track is called _",

    "the converse is not true .",
    "see @xcite for examples .",
    "the set of normalized weights carried by a complete train track gives a chart of @xmath0 .",
    "a generic foliation carried by a complete train track has a three pronged singularity in each complementary ideal triangle and a simple zero in every once - punctured monogon .    for technical reasons mentioned at the end of section  [ torus ] , instead of complete train tracks",
    ", we consider _ non - classical interval exchanges_. a non - classical interval exchange is a complete train track with a single switch .",

    "such bands shall be called orientation reversing bands . the set of possible normalized widths that can be assigned to the bands",
    "can be identified with projective classes of measured foliations carried by the non - classical interval exchange .",
    "similar to classical interval exchanges , rauzy induction is defined for non - classical interval exchanges by comparing widths of the bands in critical positions on the extreme right of the base interval , and then splitting the broader band by the narrower one till we hit the base interval again . in general , splitting a recurrent train track need not give a recurrent train track ; rauzy induction for non - classical interval exchanges however preserves recurrence . splitting a non - classical interval exchange in this manner",
    "gives a new non - classical interval exchange with widths given exactly as in equation  .",
    "moreover , if the initial non - classical interval exchange is labeled then the labeling induces forward under rauzy induction .    starting with any permissible initial widths , repeated rauzy induction gives a unique expansion associated to it .",
    "the induction is not defined when @xmath263 . for non - classical interval exchanges ,",
    "this is always a co - dimension 1 condition , and hence measure zero .",
    "the set of foliations for which the expansion stops after a finite number of steps is a countable union of such measure zero sets , and hence of measure zero .",
