    "semianalytical models predict that there may be approximately 100 hvss within 8 kpc of the galactic center due to the break up of equal - mass binaries @xcite .",
    "while the smbh at the galactic center remains the most promising culprit in generating hvss , other hypervelocity ejection scenarios are possible , such as a close encounter of a single star with a binary black hole @xcite . in this case",
    ", the star gains energy from the binary black hole and is flung out of the galaxy while the orbit of the black hole binary shrinks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "another alternative hypervelocity ejection model involves the disruption of a stellar binary in the galactic disk ; here a supernova explosion in the more massive component can accelerate the companion to hypervelocities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "so far , all confirmed hvss are massive b - type stars such as those observed around the central smbh ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , since the ejection mechanisms described above apply to any stellar mass , it is important to search for hvss among the larger set of longer - lived , lower mass stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if a smbh ejection mechanism is at play , then metal - rich stars originating from the galactic center ought to pollute the metal - poor halo .",
    "previous attempts to mine sloan extension for galactic understanding and exploration ( segue ) and segue-2 stellar halo data found no metal - rich , old ejected stars @xcite .",
    "the lack of a significant population of old , metal - rich hvss suggests that the initial mass function at the galactic center is mildly top - heavy .",
    "alternatively , hypervelocity ejection mechanisms may be more complex than previously thought .    in this paper",
    "we identify the first set of g- and k - type candidatehvss from segue .",

    "blue lines represent a transverse velocity 5 times higher than the radial velocity .",
    "the majority of our candidates show large transverse - to - radial velocity ratios , characteristic of a sample strongly affected by large proper - motion errors .",
    "we caution that some of our hvs candidates may be high - velocity flukes , and we calculate the likelihood of this in section 3.2.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      although the typical error in proper motion in the segue database is @xmath1 mas yr@xmath0 , proper - motion errors can , for some stars , be much larger than expected for a normal distribution , especially at the high - velocity end @xcite . with this in mind , we consider the possibility that these hvs candidates may have true velocities much lower than can be explained by the reported errors and that they are in fact bound to the galaxy .    in order to determine the true range of velocities for our hvs candidates , as well as the probability",
    "that these candidates are bound given a more realistic error distribution , we built a monte carlo simulation to sample possible orbital parameters for each hvs candidate .",
    "@xcite obtained a proper - motion error distribution for the sdss+usno - b catalog by compiling proper motions for a sample of sdss quasars that met the @xcite criteria .",
    "we randomly resampled a million realizations of each hvs candidate s kinematics from the @xcite non - gaussian proper - motion error distribution and gaussian radial velocity errors .",
    "we also resampled each candidate s position , assuming gaussian errors in the distance determinations as well .",
    "we find that 13 of the 20 candidates remain hypervelocity with greater than 90% probability .",
    "figure 2 shows the distribution of velocities drawn randomly from the errors for the three least and most bound candidates . in most cases , the drawn velocity well exceeds the escape velocity , represented by the vertical dashed lines .",
    "we performed a second monte carlo test to quantify the chance that these high velocities are simply the extreme tail end of the velocity error distribution within the entire segue g and k dwarf sample . here",
    "we construct a new mega - segue sample built from 1000 realizations of each segue star , in which each realization is drawn from the error distribution in proper motion , radial velocity , and distance as described above .",
    "we then calculate the  interloper likelihood \" for each candidate with respect to the mega - segue sample ; this is the probability that a slow , noncandidate star within our sample could have had the observed velocity of a particular candidate , given the errors :    @xmath2    where n@xmath3(@xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 ) is the number of stars in the mega - segue sample with velocity greater than or equal to the observed velocity of candidate @xmath7 that were originally tagged as hypervelocity in the data and n@xmath8(@xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 ) is the total number of stars in the monte carlo sample with velocity greater than or equal to the candidate s velocity .",
    "all candidates have less than a 25%  interloper likelihood , \" and more than half have less than 10% .",
    "together , these two tests indicate that some of our candidates may in fact be the result of a statistical fluke .",
    "however , we expect the bulk of the candidates to remain hypervelocity .",
    "table 1 lists the velocity of each candidate determined from the proper motions reported in dr9 , the minimum velocity calculated from a million realizations of the proper motion , radial velocity , and distance errors , the escape velocity for each candidate in a spherically symmetric galaxy , the probability that the candidate may be bound given the escape velocity at its position , and the interloper likelihood as described above .",
    "we construct an analytical , multicomponent model of the milky way gravitational potential to predict the orbits of stars in the galaxy based on the initial six - dimensional observed position and velocity .",
    "the model is easily modifiable and can be tuned to reflect the observed galactic structural parameters .",
    "our model includes the following components : a central smbh with @xmath9 ; a spherical hernquist bulge @xcite with @xmath10 and @xmath11 kpc ; miyamoto@xmath12nagai thin and thick disks @xcite with @xmath13 , 0.3 kpc thin - disk scale height , 1 kpc thick - disk scale height , and 3 kpc scale lengths for both ; and a navarro@xmath12frenk@xmath12white ( nfw ) dark matter halo @xcite following the formalism of @xcite ; we chose @xmath14 , @xmath15 kpc , and @xmath16 for the milky way .",
    "recent studies have argued for a shorter thick - disk scale length ( e.g. ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; however , this change would have a negligible effect on our results because of the comparatively low mass of the thick disk component .",
    "the model can also be tuned for varying degrees of axisymmetry or triaxiality in the halo . for this study",
    "we use both spherical and triaxial models . for the triaxial model",
    ", we adopt the axis ratios @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the galactic cartesian coordinate system used here is centered on the galactic center ; the @xmath19-axis points from the center toward the sun ( located at @xmath19 = 8.2 kpc @xcite ) , the @xmath20-axis points along the direction of galactic rotation , and the @xmath21-axis points toward the north galactic pole . to calculate velocity in this coordinate system ,",
    "we convert radial velocity , distance , and proper motions to @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 in the galactic coordinate system . note that issues with astrometry in dr8 , as explained in section 3.5 of @xcite and the associated erratum @xcite , have been resolved for the dr9 astrometry used here .",
    "we choose the velocity of the local standard of rest to be 238 km s@xmath0 , and the motion of the sun with respect to that is @xmath25 km s@xmath0 , @xmath26 km s@xmath0 , and @xmath27 km s@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this galactic model is consistent with the measured proper motion of sgra * , @xmath28 mas yr@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "then , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 are transformed into the galactic cartesian coordinate system , and we calculate the orbits backward in time for 1 gyr using a fourth - order runge@xmath12kutta integrator .",
    "the choice of 1 gyr is sufficient to discern the direction of origin while not being significantly influenced by a changing galactic potential .",
    "we examine the variation of each candidate s orbit given the errors described in section 3.2 .",
    "figure 3 shows the 1@xmath29 and 2@xmath29 orbits for hvs 20 , indicating that for some of the candidates the velocity errors are sufficiently large that the candidate itself may be bound .",
    "we find that the differences between orbits in the spherical versus the triaxial model are negligible for unbound orbits , since the stars have little time to respond to the halo potential .",
    "therefore , for simplicity , when discussing unbound orbits we show only those in the spherical case .",
    "however , in instances when the orbit may be bound , as for hvs 20 in figure 3 , the halo shape definitely influences the candidate s trajectory , suggesting that marginally bound stars may help constrain halo triaxiality .",
    "velocity errors for the corresponding candidate .",
    "the like - colored stars mark the current positions of the candidates . none of the orbits plotted here intersect near the galactic center , suggesting a different origin for these stars . in additional ,",
    "if these stars had been traveling for 13 gyr , they may have originated from as far as tens of megaparsecs away .",
    "the dashed lines , highlighted in yellow for visibility , point toward m31 s location 1 gyr ago , assuming m31 proper motion , radial velocity , and distance from @xcite .",
    "this interval was chosen to roughly coincide with the travel time of a hypervelocity star originating in m31 .",
    "none of these hvs candidates seem to be coming from m31 , which therefore is ruled out as a possible origin.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]      as shown in figure 4 , the trajectories of these hvs candidates do not originate from the galactic center , which would be expected if the stars were ejected by three - body interactions with the smbh . instead , they appear to be coming from all directions , which suggests that other ejection processes may be at play .",
    "we considered the smbh at the center of m31 as a possible source @xcite , and given the velocities of the stars , we find the required flight time to reach the solar neighborhood would be approximately 1 gyr .",
    "figure 4 shows the orbits corresponding to the seven most unbound candidates , each with a 1@xmath29  wedge \" of possible orbits .",
    "it can be seen that the candidates could not have come from m31 s smbh position 1 gyr ago ( dashed lines ) .",
    "the orbits of the other 13 candidates are consistent with not arriving from m31 .",
    "therefore , the smbh at the center of m31 is not responsible for ejecting these stars .",
    "however , this does not exclude other galactic and extragalactic sources such as globular clusters , satellite galaxies , or the centers of distant galaxies within @xmath30 mpc .",
    "since it is more difficult to trace the past orbits of globular clusters and known satellite galaxies because of tidal stripping , shocks , and other mass - loss effects , we can not say with certainty whether these stars could have originated in the galactic disk , the bulge , or globular clusters .",
    "another approach to determine whether these candidates belong to a particular population is to examine their chemical compositions .",
    "we compared the metallicities of our candidates with the metallicity distribution functions ( mdfs ) of known globular clusters @xcite , the segue g and k dwarf samples representative of the milky way disk population @xcite , the galactic bulge @xcite , and by extension the bulge of m31 , assuming a peak metallicity of @xmath310.23 @xcite .",
    "we also compared the metallicity distribution of our candidates with the mdf of the galactic halo , although with a peak at @xmath32 } < -1 $ ] @xcite it is clearly inconsistent with our candidates .",
    "the mdfs for each population are shown in figure 5 .",
    "as perhaps expected , the metallicity of the hvs candidates is consistent with the g and k dwarf samples in the disk .",
    "their metallicities are also largely consistent with the high - metallicity end of the globular cluster population and the low - metallicity end of the galactic ( and m31 ) bulge .",
    "similarly , the stars [ @xmath33/fe]-values are broadly consistent with these stellar populations . unfortunately , based on the information here , none of these populations can be decisively ruled out as a possible source , although it is clear that these hvss do not originate from the metal - poor globular cluster system .",

    "the popular ejection mechanisms described insection 1 involve a central smbh and can not explain these stars .",
    "the question where these stars originated , and how they gained such high velocities , remains .",
    "one of the best - known hypervelocity mechanisms involves a binary system in the disk , in which a supernova explosion ejects the companion star ( e.g. ; * ? ? ?",
    "there are many lesser known hypervelocity ejection mechanisms as well . for example , multibody ejections from the dense central regions of globular clusters ( e.g. ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) including globular clusters that may have dissipated over the lifetime of the galaxy ( e.g. ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may boost a star to hypervelocities .",
    "in addition , there could be a three - body interaction involving an intermediate - mass black hole or otherwise very massive star ( e.g. ; * ? ? ? * ) . a final hypervelocity ejection mechanism involving a stellar dynamical process",
    "could be the partial tidal disruption of a single star around a smbh @xcite .",
    "furthermore , three - body interactions between galaxies , such as m31 ( e.g. ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the large and small magellanic clouds ( e.g. ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , have been suggested as possible hypervelocity ejection mechanisms , although we have already ruled out m31 specifically .",
    "hvss may also receive an energy boost during the tidal stripping process as long streams are stripped from an accreted satellite ( e.g. ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .",
    "a significant fraction of the candidates failed the dist22 @xmath54 7 requirement , meaning that photometric blending from a near neighbor may have affected the proper - motion determination .",
    "a larger number of the candidates suffer from too few detections in the sdss+usno - b catalog . confirming these candidates as hvss would require additional astrometric analysis in order to verify their proper motions ; the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "fine guidance sensor may be appropriate .",
    "there is also the possibility that these candidates are unresolved spectroscopic binaries , which could imprint a large radial velocity signal .",
    "future , higher resolution spectroscopic observations could easily decide this issue and would also allow a more detailed chemical analysis to shed light on their origins .",
    "the fact that we find no low - mass hvss coming from the galactic center continues to pose a problem for a universal initial mass function and an unbiased binary ejection mechanism .",
    "if we simply assume a salpeter initial mass function and a mass - blind dynamical process , we would naively expect roughly 150 hvss in the 0.6@xmath121.2 solar mass range in our sample , compared with the 14 known 3@xmath124 m@xmath55 hvss @xcite .",
    "either the initial mass function near the galactic center is top - heavy or the process acting at the galactic center ejects over 10 times more high - mass stars than low - mass ones .",
    "there is tentative evidence from the arches and other young star clusters at the galactic center that the initial mass function is top - heavy , with a slope of about @xmath121.6 @xcite , although this is a matter of debate .",
    "if we adopt this slope for our initial mass function , then we still should have observed roughly 40 hvss with spectral types g and k , which would require an ejection mechanism that favors massive stars by more than factor of 3 .",
    "our constraints on the initial mass function are consistent with the findings of @xcite , who searched for metal - rich f / g halo hvss .",
    "this earlier study placed stricter limits on the ejection mechanism , however , because f / g stars would be expected to accumulate in the halo over their main - sequence lifetimes , while our sample probes only stars passing through the solar neighborhood ; stars ejected from the galactic center through stellar binary disruption , for example , would reach and pass through our sample in mere tens of millions of years .",
    "our results are also consistent with the constraints from @xcite , who considered the s stars at the galactic center to be the captured companions of binary star tidal disruption , a process that ejects the second star .",
    "we report a set of 20 hypervelocity candidates from the segue g and k dwarf sample .",
    "these candidates have velocities greatly exceeding the escape velocity at their respective positions in the galaxy , albeit with large proper - motion errors .",
    "monte carlo estimates of the position and kinematics of these stars show that seven of the 20 exceed the escape velocity at their respective locations within the galaxy with at least 98% probability and that each candidate s interloper likelihood is less than 25% .",
    "surprisingly , an orbit analysis indicates that none were ejected from the galactic center .",
    "the confirmation of these candidates as hvss argues for a more careful exploration of alternative ejection mechanisms such as interactions within globular clusters , dwarf galaxies , or tidal tails , as well as ejections from supernovae in the galactic disk .",
    "if these stars are truly hypervelocity , their spectra could already contain clues to their origin .",
    "for example , abundance patterns indicative of supernova contamination would confirm or rule out a candidate s having been ejected from a high - mass binary system @xcite .",
    "one remaining question is why these stars were not identified in previous hvs campaigns .",
    "a possibility is that prior searches focused on extreme radial velocities ( e.g. ; * ? ? ?",
    "while the radial velocities of our candidates are relatively modest , it is the addition of proper motions that boosts these stars into hypervelocity candidacy . naturally , our sample also explored a cooler spectral type than previous work .",
    "future surveys may be more successful in identifying hvss with both radial velocity and proper - motion measurements .",
    "we are expanding our search for hvs candidates to the entirety of the sdss dr9 sample in order to include all spectral types .",
    "analysis of any additional candidates identified in this search , as well as follow - up , is deferred to a future paper .",
