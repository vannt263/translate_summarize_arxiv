    "a universal unanswered question in neuroscience is how the human brain activities can be mapped to the different brain tasks ?",
    "as one of the main techniques in task - based functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fmri ) analysis , multivariate pattern ( mvp ) is a conjunction between neuroscience and computer science , which can extract and decode brain patterns by applying the classification methods @xcite .",
    "indeed , it can predict patterns of neural activities associated with different cognitive states @xcite and also can define decision surfaces to distinguish different stimuli for decoding the brain and understanding how it works @xcite . analyzing the patterns of visual objects",
    "is one of the most interesting topics in mvp classification , which can enable us to understand how brain stores and processes the visual stimuli .",
    "it can be used to find novel treatments for mental diseases or even to create a new generation of the user interface .",
    "technically , mvp classification is really a challenging problem .",
    "firstly , most of the fmri data sets are noisy and sparse , which can decrease the performance of mvp methods @xcite .",
    "the next challenge is defining the regions of interest ( rois ) @xcite . as mentioned before ,",
    "fmri techniques allow us to study what information are represented in the different regions .",
    "so , it is really important to know what are the effects of different stimuli on the brain regions , especially in complex tasks ( doing some simple tasks at the same time such as watching photos and tapping keys ) . on the one hand ,",
    "most of the previous studies manually selected the rois . on the other hand , defining wrong rois can significantly decrease the performance of mvp methods @xcite .",
    "another challenge is the cost of brain studies . combining different homogeneous fmri data sets",
    "can be considered as a solution for this problem but data must be normalized in a standard space .",
    "the procedure of normalization can increase the time and space complexities and decrease the robustness of mvp techniques , especially in voxel - based methods @xcite .",
    "the last challenge is visualization . as a machine learning technique",
    ", mvp represents the numerical results in the voxel - level , network connections , etc .",
    "sometimes , it is so hard for neuroscientists to find a relation between the generated results and the cognitive states .",
    "the contributions of the paper are four fold : firstly , the proposed method estimates and analyzes a snapshot of brain image for each stimulus based on the level of using oxygen in the brain instead of analyzing whole of fmri time series .",
    "indeed , employing these snapshots can dramatically decrease the sparsity .",
    "secondly , our methods can automatically detect active regions for each stimulus and dynamically define rois for each data set .",
    "further , it develops a novel model of neural representation for analyzing and visualizing functional activities in the form of anatomical regions .",
    "this model can provide a compact and informative representation of neural activities for neuroscientists to understand : what is the effect of a stimulus on each of the automatically detected regions instead of just study the fluctuation of a group of voxels in the manually selected rois .",
    "the next contribution is a new gaussian smoothing method for removing noise of voxels in the level of anatomical regions .",
    "lastly , this paper employs the l1-regularization support vector machine ( svm ) @xcite method for creating binary classification at the rois level and then combine these classifiers by using the bagging algorithm @xcite for generating the mvp model .",
    "as the most prevalent techniques in the human brain decoding , mvp methods can predict patterns of neural activities . since spatial resolution and within - area patterns of response in fmri",
    "can provide an informative representation of stimulus distinctions , most of previous mvp studies for decoding the human brain focused on task - based fmri data sets @xcite .",
    "they used these data sets for generating different forms of neural representation , include usually voxels ( volume elements in brain images ) , nodes on the cortical surface , the average signal for an area , a principal or independent component , or a measure of functional connectivity between a pair of locations @xcite .",
    "previous studies demonstrated that mvp classification can also distinguish many other brain states such as recognizing visual @xcite , or auditory stimuli @xcite .",
    "pioneer studies just focused on the special regions of the human brain , such as the fusiform face area ( ffa ) or parahippocampal place area ( ppa ) @xcite .",
    "haxby et al",
    ". showed that different visual stimuli , i.e. human faces , animals , etc .",
    ", represent different responses in the brain @xcite .",
    "hanson et al . developed combinatorial codes in the ventral temporal lobe for object recognition @xcite .",
    "norman et al . argued for using svm and gaussian naive bayes classifiers @xcite .",
    "anderson and oates studied the chance of applying non - linear artificial neural network ( ann ) on brain responses @xcite .",
    "there is great potential for employing sparse methods for brain decoding problems @xcite .",
    "carroll et al .",
    "employed the elastic net @xcite for prediction and interpretation of distributed neural activity with sparse models @xcite .",
    "richiardi et al .",
    "extracted the characteristic connectivity signatures of different brain states to perform classification @xcite .",
    "varoquaux et al .",
    "proposed a small - sample brain mapping by using sparse recovery on spatially correlated designs with randomization and clustering .",
    "their method is applied on small sets of brain patterns for distinguishing different categories based on a one - versus - one strategy @xcite .",
    "mcmenamin et al .",
    "studied subsystems underlie abstract - category ( ac ) recognition and priming of objects ( e.g. , cat , piano ) and specific - exemplar ( se ) recognition and priming of objects ( e.g. , a calico cat , a different calico cat , a grand piano , etc . ) .",
    "technically , they applied svm on manually selected rois in the human brain for generating the visual stimuli predictors @xcite .",
    "mohr et al . compared four different classification methods , i.e. l1/2 regularized svm @xcite , the elastic net , and the graph net @xcite , for predicting different responses in the human brain .",
    "they show that l1-regularization can improve classification performance while simultaneously providing highly specific and interpretable discriminative activation patterns @xcite .",
    "osher et al .",
    "proposed a network ( graph ) based approach by using anatomical regions of the human brain for representing and classifying the different visual stimuli responses ( faces , objects , bodies , scenes ) @xcite .",
    "the fmri techniques visualize the neural activities by measuring the level of oxygenation or deoxygenation in the human brain , which is called blood oxygen level dependent ( bold ) signals .",
    "technically , these signals can be represented as time series for each subject .",
    "most of the mvp techniques directly analyze these noisy and sparse time series for understanding which patterns are demonstrated for different stimuli .",
    "the main idea of our proposed method is so simple . instead of analyzing whole of the time series , the proposed method estimates and analyzes a snapshot of brain image for each stimulus when the level of using oxygen is maximized . as a result",
    ", this method can automatically decrease the sparsity of brain image .",
    "the proposed method is applied in three stages : firstly , snapshots of brain image are selected by finding local maximums in the smoothed version of the design matrix .",
    "then , features are generated in three steps , including normalizing to standard space , segmenting the snapshots in the form of automatically detected anatomical regions , and removing noise by gaussian smoothing in the level of rois .",

    "same as previous studies @xcite , @xmath0 can be formulated by a linear model as follows : @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the design matrix , @xmath14 is the noise ( error of estimation ) , @xmath15 denotes the sets of correlations ( estimated regressors ) between voxels .",

    "@xmath21 is also the number of all categories in the experiment @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , each category ( independent tasks ) contains a set of homogeneous visual stimuli .",
    "in addition , the nonzero voxels in @xmath22 represents the location of all active voxels for the @xmath20 category @xcite . as an example , imagine during a unique session for recognizing visual stimuli , if a subject watches 4 photos of cats and 3 photos of houses , then the design matrix contains two columns ; and there are also two sets of correlations between voxels , i.e. one for watching cats and another for watching houses",
    ". indeed , the final goal of this section is extracting 7 snapshots of the brain image for the 7 stimuli in this example .",
    "the design matrix can be classically calculated by convolution of time samples ( or onsets : @xmath23 ) and @xmath2 as the hemodynamic response function ( hrf ) signal , @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "in addition , there is a wide range of solutions for estimating @xmath5 values .",
    "this paper uses the classical method generalized least squares ( gls ) @xcite for estimating the @xmath5 values where @xmath25 is the covariance matrix of the noise ( @xmath26 ) : @xmath27 each local maximum in @xmath28 represents a location where the level of using oxygen is so high .",
    "in other words , the stimulus happens in that location .",
    "since @xmath28 mostly contains small spikes ( especially for event - related experiments ) , it can not be directly used for finding these local maximums .",
    "therefore , this paper employs a gaussian kernel for smoothing the @xmath28 signal .",
    "now , the interval @xmath29 is defined as follows for generating the kernel : @xmath30 where @xmath31 denotes a positive real number ; @xmath32 is the ceiling function ; and @xmath33 denotes the set of integer numbers .",
    "gaussian kernel is also defined by normalizing @xmath29 as follows : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the sum of all elements in the interval @xmath29 .",
    "this paper defines the smoothed version of the design matrix by applying the convolution of the gaussian kernel @xmath36 and each column of the design matrix ( @xmath28 ) as follows : @xmath37 @xmath38 where @xmath39 .",
    "since the level of smoothness in @xmath40 is related to the positive value in , @xmath41 is heuristically defined to generate the optimum level of smoothness in the design matrix .",
    "the general assumption here is the @xmath42 can create design matrix , which is sensitive to small spikes .",
    "further , @xmath43 can rapidly increase the level of smoothness , and remove some weak local maximums , especially in the event - related fmri data sets .",
    "figure [ smootheddm ] illustrates two examples of the smoothed columns in the design matrix .",
    "the local maximum points in the @xmath44 can be calculated as follows : @xmath45 where @xmath46 denotes the set of time points for all local maximums in @xmath47 .",
    "the sets of maximum points for all categories can be denoted as follows : @xmath48 as mentioned before , the fmri time series can be also denoted by @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is all voxels of fmri data set in the @xmath51 time point .",
    "now , the set of snapshots can be formulated as follows : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the number of snapshots in the brain image @xmath0 , and @xmath54 denotes the snapshot for @xmath55 stimulus .",
    "these selected snapshots are employed in next section for extracting features of the neural activities .",
    "algorithm [ alg : snapshotselection ] illustrates the whole of procedure for generating the snapshots from the time series @xmath0 .      in this paper ,",
    "the feature extraction is applied in three steps , i.e. normalizing snapshots to standard space , segmenting the snapshots in the form of automatically detected regions , and removing noise by gaussian smoothing in the level of rois . as mentioned before",
    ", normalizing brain image to the standard space can increase the time and space complexities and decrease the robustness of mvp techniques , especially in voxel - based methods @xcite . on the one hand ,",
    "most of the previous studies @xcite preferred to use original data sets instead of the standard version because of the mentioned problem . on the other hand",
    ", this mapping can provide a normalized view for combing homogeneous data sets . as a result",
    ", it can significantly reduce the cost of brain studies and rapidly increase the chance of understanding how the brain works . employing brain snapshots rather than analyzing whole of data",
    "can solve the normalization problem .",
    "normalization can be formulated as a mapping problem .",
    "indeed , brain snapshots are mapped from @xmath56 space to the standard space @xmath57 by using a transformation matrix for each snapshot .",
    "there is also another trick for improving the performance of this procedure .",
    "since the set @xmath22 denotes the locations of all active voxels for the @xmath20 category , it represents the brain mask for that category and can be used for generating the transform matrix related to all snapshots belong to that category .",
    "for instance , in the example of the previous section , instead of calculating 7 transform matrices for 7 stimuli , we calculate 2 matrices , including one for the category of cats and the second one for the category of houses . this mapping can be denoted as follows : @xmath58 where @xmath59 denotes the transform matrix , @xmath60 is the set of correlations in the standard space for @xmath20 category .",
    "this paper utilizes the flirt algorithm @xcite for calculating the transform matrix , which minimizes the following objective function : @xmath61 where the function @xmath62 denotes the normalized mutual information between two images @xcite , and @xmath63 is the reference image in the standard space .",
    "this image must contain the structures of the human brain , i.e. white matter , gray matter , and csf .",

    "experimental studies on 4 visual categories ( words , objects , consonants and nonsense photos ) clearly show the superiority of our proposed method in comparison with state - of - the - art methods .",
    "in addition , the time complexity of the proposed method is naturally lower than the previous methods because it employs a snapshot of brain image for each stimulus rather than using the whole of time series . in future",
    ", we plan to apply the proposed method to different brain tasks such as risk , emotion and etc .",

    "<S> multivariate pattern ( mvp ) classification holds enormous potential for decoding visual stimuli in the human brain by employing task - based fmri data sets . </S>",
    "<S> there is a wide range of challenges in the mvp techniques , i.e. decreasing noise and sparsity , defining effective regions of interest ( rois ) , visualizing results , and the cost of brain studies . in overcoming these challenges </S>",
    "<S> , this paper proposes a novel model of neural representation , which can automatically detect the active regions for each visual stimulus and then utilize these anatomical regions for visualizing and analyzing the functional activities . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , this model provides an opportunity for neuroscientists to ask this question : what is the effect of a stimulus on each of the detected regions instead of just study the fluctuation of voxels in the manually selected rois . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , our method introduces analyzing snapshots of brain image for decreasing sparsity rather than using the whole of fmri time series . </S>",
    "<S> further , a new gaussian smoothing method is proposed for removing noise of voxels in the level of rois . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed method enables us to combine different fmri data sets for reducing the cost of brain studies . </S>",
    "<S> experimental studies on 4 visual categories ( words , consonants , objects and nonsense photos ) confirm that the proposed method achieves superior performance to state - of - the - art methods . </S>"
