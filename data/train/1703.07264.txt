    "a constant theme throughout the work of sergei ovsienko was the notion of gelfand - tsetlin subalgebras and modules introduced for @xmath3 in @xcite , then more generally for @xmath0 in @xcite , finally arriving at the more general definition of harish - chandra algebras and modules in @xcite .",
    "he returned several times to the subject and its applications to representation theory , as can be seen in the articles @xcite .",
    "there were also many independent developments such as the construction of quantized versions of gelfand - tsetlin modules @xcite , the study of gelfand - tsetlin algebras and modules over orthogonal lie algebras @xcite , and the construction of several new families of infinite dimensional gelfand - tsetlin modules , including applications to the classification of irreducible modules over @xmath0 @xcite , just to name a few .",
    "it is a pleasure to contribute to the continuing development of this subject .",
    "the notion of a gelfand - tsetlin module ( see definition [ d : gt - modules ] ) has its origin in the classical article @xcite , where i. gelfand and m. tsetlin gave a presentation of all the finite dimensional irreducible representations of @xmath0 in terms of certain tableaux , which have come to be known as _ gelfand - tsetlin tableaux _ , or gt - tableaux for shot .",
    "the action of @xmath0 over a tableau is given by rational functions in its entries , and the poles of these rational functions form a nowhere dense set in @xmath2 ; the formulas for this action are known as the gelfand - tsetlin formulas . starting from this observation , yu .",
    "drozd , ovsienko and v. futorny introduced a large family of infinite dimensional @xmath0-modules in @xcite .",
    "these modules have a basis parametrized by gelfand - tsetlin tableaux with complex coefficients such that no pattern is a pole for the rational functions appearing in the gt - formulae ( such tableaux are called _ generic _ , hence the name `` generic gelfand - tsetlin module '' ) .    in @xcite , futorny ,",
    "d. grantcharov and l. e. ramrez built new gt - modules starting from a @xmath1-singular tableaux ( see definition [ d : various - tableaux ] ) .",
    "these @xmath1-singular modules are given by generators and relations , and the action of @xmath0 is given by new explicit formulas ; the proof that these formulas indeed define an action of @xmath0 requires long calculations .",
    "we present a new approach , which consist of first building a `` universal generic gt - module '' ( definition [ t : generic - gt ] ) and then finding a `` universal @xmath1-singular module '' ( definition [ d : v - b ] ) as a submodule .",
    "thus the @xmath0-module structure is built in by construction on the singular modules , and the formulas for this action are deduced from those of the generic case .",
    "let us be a little more explicit .",
    "the set of poles @xmath4 of the original gelfand - tsetlin formulae can be described as the union of all integral translates of a certain finite hyperplane arrangement centered at the origin in @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath5 be the complement of @xmath4 , and let @xmath6 be the algebra of regular functions defined over @xmath5 , so for every point @xmath7 there is a generic gelfand - tsetlin module @xmath8 .",
    "we show that these modules form a flat family over @xmath5 by constructing a free @xmath6-module @xmath9 over which @xmath10 acts by @xmath6-linear operators , such that @xmath11 for each @xmath7 as @xmath0-modules , see theorem [ t : generic - gt ] .",
    "now fix two entries @xmath12 and @xmath13 , let @xmath14 be the set of tableaux with @xmath15 and no other critical entries , and let @xmath16 be the algebra of regular functions over @xmath17 . in theorem [ t : v - b - u - stable ] we show that the flat family over @xmath5 extends to a flat family over @xmath18 by finding a full @xmath16-lattice @xmath19 which is stable by the action of @xmath0 . from this",
    "we immediately get for each @xmath7 that @xmath20 as @xmath0-modules , while for @xmath21 we obtain a @xmath0-module @xmath22 .",
    "we finally show that @xmath23 is isomorphic to the corresponding @xmath1-singular module constructed by futorny , grantcharov and ramrez , and recover the action of the gelfand - tsetlin subalgebra of @xmath24 on it .",
