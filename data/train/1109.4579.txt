    "observations of the inner regions ( @xmath1 5 au ) of circumstellar disks are essential for obtaining a complete understanding of star and planet formation . the inner disk interacts with the central star , thereby controlling the accretion and ejection of material and setting the timescale for star formation and disk evolution .",
    "in addition , inner disks are the likely birthplace of terrestrial planets . however , these regions are difficult to study , because of their small angular size at the distance of nearby star - forming regions and the proximity to their parent stars .",
    "recently , significant advancements in our understanding of inner disks have been made with two complementary techniques : ir interferometry and high - resolution spectroscopy .",
    "ir interferometry is capable of observing thermal emission from the dusty component of disks with resolutions of a few mas ( probing size scales down to a few hundredths of an au ; millan - gabet et al .",
    "1999 ; eisner et al .  2003 ; akeson et al .",
    "2005b , monnier et al .  2005 ) .",
    "these observations have shown that standard , optically thick accretion disk models ( such as outlined by @xcite ) fail to simultaneously fit spectral energy distributions ( seds ) and visibilities @xcite .",
    "better fits to visibilities were obtained with an optically thin inner gas disk interior to a hot , puffed - up wall of dust @xcite , with the dust wall located where temperatures are high enough to sublimate silicate grains @xcite .",
    "recent observations and modeling efforts have introduced complications to this simple picture , including a significant source of emission of unknown origin _ inside _ the dust sublimation radius ( for an extensive review , see * ? ? ?",
    "however , the major conclusion  that there is a defined inner radius consistent with dust sublimation  still holds true .",
    "the complementary technique of high - resolution spectroscopy has been used to study rovibrational emission from hot gaseous molecules , specifically h@xmath2o and co ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , that originate in the inner disk atmosphere .",
    "because of the high temperatures ( @xmath3 k ) required to populate vibrationally excited states , co vibrational emission originates at disk radii similar to those probed by ir interferometry ( @xmath1 a few au ) . when the spectral resolution is high enough that the emission lines are spectrally resolved , the line profile acts as a proxy for the spatial location of the gas , under the assumption that the emission originates in a rotating keplerian disk .",
    "since the emission line wings represent the highest observed velocities , the flux in the line wings originates at the inner edge of the molecular disk .",
    "thus , emission lines ( after a correction for disk inclination ) can be used to measure molecular gas inner radii .    in this work ,",
    "we present observations of co @xmath4=1@xmath50 emission from a large sample of protoplanetary disks , including `` classical '' optically thick disks around t tauri stars ( ctts s ) and herbig ae / be ( haebe ) stars , as well as transitional disks  disks whose inner regions are depleted of small dust grains ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the disks in the chosen sample all have known inclinations , allowing us to use line profiles to derive co inner radii , which we then compare to the interferometric dust inner radii .",
    "we also fit the emission line fluxes with a local thermodynamic equilibrum ( lte ) slab emission model , and relate the bulk properties of the gas to the measured co inner radii .",
    "most of our spectra were obtained with nirspec @xcite , a high - resolution ( @xmath625,000 , fwhm@xmath012.5 km s@xmath7 ) spectrometer on the keck ii telescope .",
    "these observations are derived from several observing runs spanning the years 20012010 , and are part of a large nirspec survey of protoplanetary disks , portions of which have been previously presented @xcite .",
    "the data were observed in the @xmath8 band in echelle mode with a 0.@xmath943@xmath1024@xmath9 slit . each source was observed in at least two grating settings , thereby encompassing wavelengths between @xmath11 and @xmath12 m , with the exception of a hole between orders at @xmath13@xmath14 m .",
    "this wavelength range covers the first two r - branch lines and the low / mid p - branch ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) of the @xmath4=1@xmath50 co rovibrational spectrum , as well as the h i pf@xmath17 and hu@xmath18 transitions , and in a few cases the hu@xmath19 transition .",
    "an observation log is provided in table [ tbl : log ] .",
    "tw hya s co emission lines were not well resolved with nirspec and this source was therefore observed with phoenix @xcite on gemini south , as first reported in @xcite .",
    "it was observed on 2006 april 7 and 8 using the 0.@xmath935@xmath1014@xmath9 slit . with its significantly higher spectral resolution ( @xmath20 @xmath0 60,000 , fwhm @xmath0 5 km s@xmath7 ) , but smaller spectral coverage , the phoenix observations resolve the emission lines from p(6 ) to p(9 ) .",
    "objects were observed in nod pairs and then differenced .",
    "exposure times ( integration time multiplied by co - adds ) were limited to one minute in length to minimize atmospheric changes between nods .",
    "wavelengths were calibrated using telluric emission lines .",
    "nearby a and b standard stars were observed to correct for telluric absorption features .",
    "any h i lines present in the standard star spectra were fitted by kurucz models before dividing source spectra by the standard .",
    "standard stars were also utilized for flux calibration , using @xmath8-band fluxes estimated from two micron all sky survey @xmath21-band photometry @xcite and spectral types from the literature .",
    "portions of the spectra with poor atmospheric transmission ( typically @xmath22 , but the exact percentage for each source was determined empirically ) were removed .",
    "wavelengths were shifted to correct for a doppler shift due to earth s motion , which depends on the time of year .",
    "many sources were observed at multiple doppler shifts , thereby `` filling in '' regions of poor atmospheric transmission and creating complete line profiles , even for low - excitation lines .",
    "( high excitation co lines do not suffer greatly from telluric absorption ) .",
    "a more detailed explanation of the data acquisition and reduction used for the nirspec observations in our survey can be found in @xcite .",

    "in fact , it is believed that the disk upper atmosphere is thermally decoupled from the dust , and its temperature is set by a complex balance of gas heating and cooling @xcite .",
    "therefore , we have chosen a model that makes a minimal number of assumptions about the underlying temperature .",

    ", it allows for a good fit to the line wings ( and hence @xmath59 ) _ independently _ of lower - velocity portions of the line profile .",
    "we have chosen to model the line profiles as emission from a disk with co luminosity per unit radius @xmath60 , where @xmath61 and @xmath60 is a broken power law with @xmath62 for @xmath63 and @xmath64 for @xmath65 . by directly fitting for the shape of @xmath60 , rather than beginning with the temperature and co column density profiles , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , and using these to _ deduce _",
    "@xmath60 , we make the problem both computationally manageable and simple to interpret .",
    "a similar procedure was used by @xcite to model co and h@xmath2o emission from the disk around the young star svs 13 .",
    "a broken power law is empirically convenient , as it has enough free parameters to properly fit most line profiles ( in many cases a single power law is not sufficient to fit the observed line profiles ) , and yet the inner radius turns out to be well constrained .",
    "a broken power - law approximation for @xmath60 also has a physical basis .",
    "at all radii , @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the flux emitted by the co per unit radius . at small radii , if the gas is optically thick , temperatures are high and so the emission near 5 @xmath70 m is in the rayleigh  jeans regime ( i.e. , @xmath71 ) . at larger",
    "radii , however , there should be a steeper decrease in @xmath69 as temperatures drop , the blackbody curve peaks at or beyond 5 @xmath70 m , and @xmath72 drops much more rapidly with @xmath73 .    in all models",
    ", we have assumed @xmath74 au , as the models are insensitive to @xmath75 beyond @xmath0 a few au .",
    "we allow @xmath76 to take values of @xmath56 , @xmath77 , @xmath58 , or @xmath78 .",
    "@xmath76 primarily affects the degree of double peak in the line profile , but is not well constrained because of degeneracy with other parameters .",
    "we tested values for @xmath79 from @xmath77 to @xmath80 and , as we will discuss , this parameter has an important effect on the determination of the co inner radius , @xmath59 .",
    "values of @xmath59 from 0.005 to 10 au were tested , with the lower limit being the approximate radius of a solar mass star and the upper limit producing maximum velocities similar to the nirspec resolution .",
    "we also tested a similar range of values for @xmath81 , though @xmath81 was by definition always larger than or equal to @xmath59 .",
    "most of the model parameters turn out to be strongly degenerate , so that they can not be uniquely determined from the line profiles , and since our focus was to study co inner radii , we did not make an effort to understand these parameters in detail . instead , our goal was to investigate whether @xmath59 could be determined robustly .",
    "we find that if @xmath79 is strongly negative , then the line shape becomes very sensitive to @xmath59 .",
    "this is demonstrated in the middle panels of figure [ fig : fluxfit_plot1 ] , which show @xmath82 as a function of @xmath59 and @xmath79 , with all other parameters being free variables .",
    "if @xmath83 , then @xmath59 is robustly determined . if @xmath79 is 0 ( i.e. , @xmath60 is flat from @xmath59 to @xmath81 ) , then the line shape becomes insensitive to @xmath59 , but is instead sensitive to @xmath81 .",
    "( for intermediate values of @xmath79 , the line shape is sensitive to a combination of @xmath59 and @xmath81 . ) thus , the line profile is sensitive to steep drops in @xmath60 .",
    "this is due to the fact that in order to be sensitive to some @xmath84 ( either @xmath59 or @xmath81 ) , any change to this parameter , @xmath85 , must result in a significant change to the total line luminosity , i.e. , @xmath86 must be a significant fraction of @xmath87 . in figure",
    "[ fig : lineplot ] , we show line profiles with @xmath88 and @xmath89 for two different values of @xmath59 , and demonstrate that with @xmath89 the line profile is very sensitive to @xmath59 , but with @xmath88 , the line profile changes only slightly with changes in @xmath59 .",
    "due to the dependence of @xmath59 and @xmath81 on @xmath79 , we have explored two classes of solutions that can fit the data well in most cases . in the first approach , @xmath79 is set to @xmath56 , and @xmath59 is well - determined . in the second @xmath79",
    "is set to @xmath80 , and @xmath81 is well - determined .",
    "the best - fit parameters in these two cases are presented in table [ tbl : modelfits ] .",
    "the best - fit line profiles and corresponding @xmath60 profiles are shown in figure [ fig : fluxfit_plot1 ] .",
    "the @xmath88 case places no constraints on the inner edge of the co emission and has a sudden steep drop - off in @xmath60 occurring at @xmath81 .",
    "the @xmath89 case has a distinct region free of co between @xmath90 and @xmath59 .",
    "we believe that the second class of models is more physically motivated , as co can be cleared out near the star due to photodissociation or disk truncation . however , we can not empirically rule out the other class of models .",
    "there are a few sources in which the @xmath88 solution results in a significantly - improved fit  most notably as 205 n and wa oph 6 ( see figure [ fig : fluxfit_plot1 ] ) .",
    "however , as 205 n is known to be a member of a small subset of disks with `` peaky '' line profiles @xcite , in which low - velocity flux may be enhanced by a low - velocity disk wind @xcite .",
    "thus , a keplerian disk model is probably not appropriate in this case , and we do not believe that the model with @xmath88 is necessarily more physically realistic than the model with @xmath89 .    in most cases , one class of fits is not preferred over the other , and since we feel the @xmath89 case is more physically motivated , we adopt this model for the remainder of this work .",
    "however , in figure [ fig : rin_rmid ] , we show that @xmath59 with @xmath89 and @xmath81 with @xmath88 are related such that @xmath91 ( because with @xmath88 there is still some flux contribution from the region inside @xmath81 ) . therefore ,",
    "uncertainty about the choice of model simply means that there is a systematic uncertainty in the location of the drop - off in @xmath92 by a factor of a few , and any _ trends _ in @xmath59 should be robust .",
    "when comparing @xmath59 with other disk radii elsewhere in the paper , we will refer to our best - fit @xmath59 as @xmath93 .",
    "assuming zero error in disk inclination , it is apparent from the @xmath82 diagrams in figure [ fig : fluxfit_plot1 ] that @xmath59 is uncertain to @xmath0 0.5 dex , or factors of a few .",
    "uncertainties are also introduced due to errors in disk inclination . these scale",
    "roughly as @xmath94 , and so are largest for low - inclination disks . with a typical inclination ( @xmath95 ) and error ( @xmath96 ) , errors in @xmath20 ( derived from kepler s law ) are @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "thus , they are similar to or somewhat smaller than the systematic uncertainties . however ,",
    "for smaller inclinations , uncertainties in @xmath99 may dominate . in any case , an uncertainty of @xmath0 0.5 dex should reasonably be assumed for @xmath59 .",
    "for a few sources with narrow line profiles , it is apparent from the lack of a large radius cutoff in @xmath82 ( figure [ fig : fluxfit_plot1 ] ) that the models are fairly insensitive to differences in @xmath59 at radii larger than the best - fit value .",
    "these include ab aur , hd 135344 b , hd 141569 a , hd 190073 , lkh@xmath23 330 and sr 21 .",
    "as discussed in section [ sec : modelresults ] , there is a systematic uncertainty introduced by the two classes of models capable of reproducing the observed line shapes .",
    "there is also a potential bias introduced by the choice of lines used in the composite line profile . in theory",
    ", one should be able to obtain the same @xmath59 from all emission lines and we have tested whether using only low - excitation lines ( @xmath100 ) yields the same result . in practice , we find that utilizing low - excitation lines only , the derived @xmath59 are similar to or larger than the nominal @xmath59 , with the ratio typically being 12 .",
    "although biased towards larger @xmath59 , this is within our known uncertainty of a factor of a few , and we believe that the high - excitation lines are likely to be more sensitive to @xmath59 , and so yield the more accurate fit .      at least two other methods for determining @xmath59 have appeared in the literature . in one ,",
    "a co temperature ( and density ) profile is assumed , and @xmath59 is fit as a single free variable in a disk model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in our model , in contrast",
    ", the temperature , density , level populations , and emitting area are all wrapped up into @xmath60 . to compare the two models , we fit model line profiles , constructed using the procedure described in @xcite , with the simple model described here , setting @xmath101 . we find that disk temperature profiles of the form @xmath102 with @xmath103 are equivalent to models with @xmath104 , and @xmath105 is equivalent to @xmath106 .",
    "compared to the values derived by @xcite , we find similar radii for many sources , with the notable exception of hd 141569 a , lkh@xmath23 330 , and sr 21 , for which @xcite find radii larger by factors of a few to @xmath0 10 .",
    "all three of these sources , however , are ones in which @xmath82 is not sensitive to @xmath59 at radii larger than the best - fit value .",
    "we also find radii consistent with @xcite for as 205 a and tw hya , who estimate inner radii of 0.04 and 0.1 au , respectively ( although they caution that the parameter space for these models was not well explored ; j.  e.  bast , private communication ) .",
    "our respective results are _ inconsistent _ for vv ser , for which bast et al .",
    "derive an inner radius of 0.08 au and we derive an inner radius of 0.72 au ; however , a closer look at their model reveals that they are in a regime similar to our @xmath88 case , in which @xmath82 is simply not very sensitive to the choice of inner radius .    another common approach to estimating @xmath59 is to simply choose some velocity ( typically either 2@xmath10 the half - width at half maximum ( hwhm ) , or the half - width at zero intensity ) , and set @xmath59 to the radius with that keplerian velocity .",
    "the difficulty of this approach is that it is not obvious which velocity to choose . in figure",
    "[ fig : radcomp ] , we compare @xmath59 to inner radii derived from fitting the profiles with single or double ( emission plus absorption ) gaussians ( @xmath107 ) . in particular , we show solutions in which @xmath59 is derived from the velocity at 1.7@xmath10 hwhm , which comes closest to reproducing our results . deviations from 1:1 are of order a factor of a few , and so this simple approach is remarkably consistent with our more complex model .",
    "thus , we suggest that using the velocity at 1.7@xmath10 hwhm is a reasonable choice for calculating @xmath59 using simple gaussian fits .",
    "we use this result to incorporate lkca 15 into our analysis , utilizing the fwhm measured by @xcite .",
    "this result also gives us confidence that the model - derived @xmath59 is reflecting the bulk line shape and fwhm , and is not instead some spurious result heavily biased by the line / continuum ratio , the noise level , or any other aspects of the data .",
    "four sources in our sample ( hd 135344 b , sr 21 , tw hya , and vv ser ) have inner radii derived from a combined line shape and spectro - astrometric ( sa ) profile analysis @xcite . although the overlapping sample is small , and two of these are sources for which we do not have a strong upper limit on @xmath59 ( see section [ sec : benchmark ] ) , our results appear broadly consistent with these results .",
    "@xcite measured co inner radii for hd 135344 b , sr 21 and tw hya assuming a power - law disk temperature profile , and derived values within a factor of 3.5 of our @xmath59 .",
    "note that the sa signal is most sensitive to the _ extent _ of the co emission , and also provides a hard upper limit on @xmath59 .",
    "however , the sa profile is not very sensitive to @xmath59 , and so modeling that incorporates sa is subject to the same uncertainties in the gas temperature profile , and does not necessarily determine @xmath59 more accurately .",
    "@xcite report sa radii , which they define as the radius at the peak of the sa profile , for hd 135344 b , sr 21 , tw hya and vv ser .",
    "the sa signal is the flux - weighted mean position of the emission at each velocity and is therefore sensitive to the distribution of emission rather than simply the inner boundary .",
    "the sa radii will therefore always be larger than @xmath59 unless the emitting region is infinitesimally thin . in the context of our two - power - law model , the sa radii",
    "would be affected by @xmath79 , @xmath76 and @xmath81 , since these all affect the amount of flux at large radii .",
    "thus , the sa profiles are complementary to the results from line shape analysis , and the two can potentially be used in concert to derive the shape of @xmath60 .",
    "the sa radii ( @xmath108 ) derived by @xcite are factors of 25 larger than our @xmath59 .",
    "we have tested our two - power - law models with a simple code to calculate @xmath108 and find that we can simultaneously reproduce the observed @xmath59 and @xmath108 by adjusting other model parameters .",

    "we assume @xmath135 @xcite . neglecting to include the accretion contribution to the luminosity yields outliers with high accretion rates ( see figure [ fig : acc ] ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : lrin_acc ] we show the strong correlation between @xmath93 and @xmath136 , consistent with dust sublimation temperatures of @xmath137 for ctts disks and slightly lower temperatures , @xmath138 for haebe disks .",
    "transitional disk radii are larger , but also follow a similar trend ( discussed further in section [ sec : trans ] ) . including all disks ,",
    "the @xmath79-value associated with linear regression of @xmath139 against @xmath140 is @xmath141 , and excluding transitional disks , it is @xmath142 , so the increase in radius with luminosity is highly statistically significant . therefore , we believe this is strong evidence for a dependence of @xmath93 on dust sublimation .",
    "the slope of the trend ( excluding transitional disks ) , @xmath143 , is somewhat steeper than the slope of @xmath144 expected from dust sublimation alone , at the 2 @xmath145 level . in more detail , @xmath93 may be set by a balance of photodissociation ( which eats outward in the disk ) and accretion ( which replenishes inward ) .",
    "this could result in relatively smaller @xmath93 for t tauri disks and larger for haebe disks due to the respectively lower and higher photodissociating uv fluxes .",
    "if dust acts as a shield against photodissociation , then we should also expect a correlation between @xmath93 and measured dust inner radii from near - ir interferometers .",
    "we show these radii in figure [ fig : gas_dust ] , along with a line marking a 1:1 correlation , and another marking the best linear fit .",
    "although there is a statistically significant correlation between the two variables , there is also significant scatter , of order 0.5 dex .",
    "uncertainties in @xmath93 can be a factor of a few ( see section [ sec : errors ] ) , which may account for some of the scatter . also , dust inner radii are measured using different models in different studies ( including thin rings , disks , both inclined and not inclined ) , and so it is possible that some of the scatter arises from the choice of dust model , or from dust models not accounting for the disk inclination .",
    "using a coherent sample of interferometric visibilities , analyzed in the same way , and accounting for disk inclination , could test this hypothesis .",
    "another possibility is that there is real scatter due to different rates of photodissociation and/or replenishment via accretion .",
    "this is consistent with the observation that several haebe disks have anomalously large @xmath93 , while several ctts s have anomalously small @xmath93 .      as discussed in several prior studies",
    "@xcite , @xmath93 lies well inside @xmath146 for many transitional disks ( where @xmath146 is the radius at which the disk becomes optically thick ) . this result has also been confirmed via spectroastrometry for hd 135344 b and tw hya @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : radplot_trans ] , we closely reproduce the results of @xcite , who showed that the best - fit @xmath93 lie somewhere between @xmath147 and @xmath146 for all disks .",
    "an important caveat is that , as discussed in section [ sec : modelresults ] , @xmath93 , the upper limit to @xmath93 is not well constrained for hd 135344 b , hd 141569 a and sr 21 . the emission in sr 21 and hd 141569 a could originate at or near @xmath146 , as is observed for the transitional disk hd 100546 @xcite ; however ,",
    "for hd 135344 b , some of the co gas must originate from within the inner , optically thin region @xcite .    using the procedures described in section [ sec : procedure ] ,",
    "we derive significantly larger radii for transitional disks than for classical disks at the same luminosity .",
    "this difference is typically an order of magnitude  much larger than our uncertainties  and holds true for almost three orders of magnitude in luminosity . here",
    "we discuss some possible explanations for this difference .",
    "one possible explanation is that this is the result of some systematic bias in our analysis .",
    "two possibilities come to mind .",
    "first , since @xmath93 depends on the line wings , one might derive smaller inner radii by `` fitting the noise '' at large velocities .",
    "however , since transitional disks tend to have lower continuum s / n levels , and lower line / continuum ratios than classical disks @xcite , this would tend to bias one toward deriving larger characteristic velocities and hence _ smaller _ inner radii for transitional disks .",
    "in addition , we find that the transitional disk radius discrepancy holds even if we examine @xmath59 derived from the hwhm .",
    "a second possibility is that @xmath93 appears to depend somewhat on the choice of lines included in the line composite , with lower - excitation lines yielding larger radii by up to a factor of @xmath148 .",
    "since 6/8 transitional disks in our survey ( gm aur , hd 135344 b , hd 141569 a , sr 21 , tw hya , and ux tau a ) did not have high - excitation emission lines , their low - excitation lines were analyzed instead , and this could result in spuriously large radii for these disks .",
    "however , this bias produces only up to a factor of two difference in @xmath93 , while the observed difference is an order of magnitude .",
    "furthermore , the discrepancy is also seen for doar 44 and lkh@xmath23 330 , which do have high - excitation emission lines . instead , we suggest that the lack of high - excitation emission is a reflection of the relatively larger emitting radii ( and thus lower emitting temperatures ) for these disks .",
    "a physically - motivated explanation for the radius discrepancy is that @xmath93 in transitional disks is not set by sublimation , but rather by dynamical truncation by an embedded protoplanet .",
    "although embedded protoplanets have been posited as a possible explanation for the inner clearings in transitional disks , they are expected to orbit at radii capable of producing the sharp transition between the optically thin inner and optically thick outer disk regions .",
    "since the @xmath93 we find here is usually significantly smaller than @xmath146 we would actually need to invoke dynamical truncation by _ additional _ planets , in smaller orbits .",
    "in particular , we would predict planets located at radii near @xmath149 @xcite .",
    "this is in line with recent work suggesting that multiplanet systems may be required to explain transitional disks @xcite .",
    "however , this explanation would need to be consistent with the apparent increase in @xmath93 with luminosity .",
    "this is not unreasonable , as the mass and location of the protoplanets may depend on the disk and/or stellar mass .    another possible explanation for the radius discrepancy , and",
    "one qualitatively consistent with the increase of @xmath93 with luminosity , could be that the dust disk is still truncated at @xmath147 , but that photodissociating uv photons penetrate a finite distance into the tenuous transitional dust disk , making @xmath150 . a possible quantitative test for this hypothesis would be to calculate a uv penetration depth and compare to the radius discrepancy",
    ". however , this is difficult to test in practice , since the local dust density at @xmath147 is not known .",
    "( although sed models can place some constraints on the location and surface density of the inner disk dust , they do not do so to the precision required here . ) yet , with sufficiently low dust densities , this explanation is plausible ; for example , with @xmath151 and a dust density @xmath152 ( equivalent to a vertical dust surface density of @xmath153 g @xmath154 for a scale height of 0.1 au ) , the penetration depth ( to @xmath155 ) is @xmath156 au . for comparison ,",
    "@xcite measure a dust surface density of @xmath157 g @xmath154 at the inner edge of the tw hya disk .",
    "a final possibility we consider is that the co temperature structure in the emitting layer is different for classical and transitional disks .",
    "since we can not distinguish between models with steeply declining line luminosity , @xmath60 , beginning at @xmath93 , and models with flat @xmath60 at smaller radii ( see the discussion in section [ sec : modelresults ] ) , it is possible that some aspects of the latter model are more appropriate for transitional disks .",
    "this possibility could be tested with radiative transfer code that properly treats the gas heating and cooling as well as the line radiative transfer .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xcite , in contrast , find no significant difference between sa radii for transitional and classical disks . as discussed in section [ sec : sa ] , the sa radii are complementary to @xmath59 , as they represent the flux - weighted mean radius .",
    "therefore , the results of @xcite suggest that differences in co emission between transitional and classical disks are erased at large radii , and the outer extent of the emission is similar for the two classes of disks . if the outer extent is the same , but the inner radius is larger for transitional disks , the emission from these disks should come from a smaller range of radii .      if the co line flux is dominated by emission from near @xmath93 , we should expect a positive correlation between @xmath93 and the characteristic emitting area , @xmath111 , derived from the rotation diagram fits .",
    "in fact , as shown in figure [ fig : larea_plot ] , we find that for classical disks , @xmath111 is approximately @xmath158 .",
    "if the emission comes from a ring located at @xmath93 and of thickness @xmath159 , then the rotation diagram results are consistent with @xmath160 au .",
    "interestingly , the relationship is quite different for transitional disks . excluding hd 141569 a , which has an anomalously large area ( probably due to poorly constrained high-@xmath161 line fluxes ) a similar calculation yields @xmath162 au .",
    "this is at least qualitatively consistent with the fact that the emission from transitional disks may come from a smaller range of radii , as suggested by @xmath59 and @xmath108 .    with a rotational temperature , @xmath163 , and a location , @xmath93",
    ", we can explore the relationship between dust and gas temperatures . in figure",
    "[ fig : trot_teff ] , we show @xmath163 and @xmath164 , defined as the effective temperature for a blackbody grain fully exposed to stellar plus accretion radiation .",
    "we find no statistically significant correlation between these two variables .",
    "in addition , while models predict gas temperatures in the upper layers of disk atmospheres to be in excess of the thermal dust temperatures @xcite , we find that @xmath163 is similar to , or often less than , @xmath164 .",
    "although we have assumed blackbody grains , a correction for the relative absorption and emission efficiencies for disk grains would make dust temperatures even higher ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the similarity between @xmath163 and @xmath164 is also curious in light of recent results highlighting the need for a high gas temperature in order to produce observed h@xmath2o emission lines , which have critical densities similar to the co lines observed here @xcite .",
    "a possible explanation is that @xmath163 represents a characteristic temperature for the emitting region , which is lower than the temperature at the inner rim .",
    "we also find lower @xmath163 for transitional and haebe disks than for ctts disks , on average .",
    "this result is consistent with the slightly larger values of @xmath165 observed for haebe disks , seen in figure [ fig : lrin_acc ] .",
    "in conclusion , we have used observations of co emission from a large sample of ctts , haebe and transitional disks to probe inner disk structure . using a conceptually simple parameterization of the co emission as a function of disk radius , we find that co inner radii can be robustly determined .",
    "these inner radii are similar to the stellar corotation radii for low - mass stars , but significantly larger than stellar corotation radii for disks around haebe stars .",
    "we find a strong size ",
    "luminosity relationship for co inner radii , and suggest that co emission is truncated at the dust sublimation radius .",
    "transitional disks are obvious outliers , with co inner radii typically an order of magnitude larger than classical disks at the same luminosity , even though the emission typically arises from well within the transition radius at which the disk becomes optically thick .",
    "we also compare co inner radii with gas characteristics derived from rotation diagram fits .",
    "we find that classical and transitional disk line fluxes are separately consistent with emission from a single temperature ring of width 0.15 and 0.01 au , respectively , located at the co inner radius .",
    "we also find systematically lower rotational temperatures for transitional disks and disks around haebe stars , than for those around t tauri stars , which is consistent with observed differences in the ratio of co inner radius to dust sublimation radius .",
    "finally , we find rotational temperatures similar to , or slightly lower than , the expected temperature of blackbody grains located at the co inner radius .",
