    "analysis of a ( fictitious ) diffusion process on space or spacetime has become a powerful tool for characterizing classical and quantum models .",
    "the usefulness of this method stems from the spectral properties of laplace operators , which allow us to determine such quantities as the return probability or spectral dimension .",
    "the former can be applied to calculations of the vacuum energy density and entanglement entropy @xcite .",
    "studies of the spectral dimension , which is one of the possible tools allowing to characterize the spacetime dimensionality at different scales , has become especially popular over the last ten years in the context of quantum gravity . in particular , this is so because the spectral dimension can tell us what is effective spacetime dimension perceived by a field defined of a given spacetime .",
    "the results may also be used for a comparison of different models of the planck scale physics . however , the potential convergence of their predictions has to be treated as a hint rather than indication of the more fundamental relation .",
    "the reason is that different structures of ( quantum ) geometry may lead to similar running of the spectral dimension with scale .",
    "the avalanche of papers concerning the spectral dimension mentioned above has been triggered by the seminal analysis performed in the framework of causal dynamical triangulations ( cdt ) @xcite . in this case",
    "it has been shown that deep within physical phase c spacetime undergoes a dimensional reduction from the classical value @xmath1 at large diffusion times ( ir limit ) to @xmath2 at small times ( uv limit ) .",
    "the result has been subsequently generalized , showing that the uv value of the spectral dimension varies depending on a position on the cdt phase diagram .",
    "in particular , in the region of the phase c close to the phase a the value @xmath3 has been measured , which , interestingly , can serve as a resolution to the entropic argument against the asymptotic safety scenario @xcite .",
    "the dimensional reduction to @xmath4 in the ultraviolet limit seems to be a common feature of a variety of approaches to quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "it has been observed in ( besides cdt ) : hoava - lifshitz gravity ( for the characteristic exponent @xmath5 ) @xcite , asymptotic safety scenario @xcite , multi - fractal spacetimes @xcite , causal sets ( probed by a scalar field ) @xcite and spin - foam models @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the value @xmath4 is not completely universal but typical for a certain class of models , describing a specific type of quantum spacetime configurations , perhaps a specific phase of the gravitational field . in particular",
    ", as we already mentioned , the values different from @xmath6 can be found on the cdt phase diagram . while in the physical phase",
    "c the dimensional reduction from @xmath7 to @xmath8 $ ] has been observed , in two other phases values of the spectral dimension are significantly different , e.g. in the non - geometric phase b the spectral dimension diverges at small scales .",
    "another example of @xmath9 is provided by the noncommutative @xmath10-minkowski spacetime , which is often considered in models of doubly special relativity or relative locality framework .",
    "it has been shown to be characterized by the dimensional reduction from @xmath7 to @xmath11 @xcite but this value is obtained for a particular choice of the laplace operator on spacetime . meanwhile , in the case of the relative locality - inspired laplacian the spectral dimension diverges at small scales @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we extend the above results by investigating the diffusion on spacetime whose ( poincar ) symmetries are deformed by effects predicted in the effective regime of loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) .",
    "namely , it has been shown that as a consequence of requiring the anomaly freedom the classical algebra of gravitational constraints ( the hypersurface deformation algebra ) is subject to a quantum deformation @xcite .",
    "a pronounced manifestation of the deformation is the phenomenon of a``dynamical '' signature change @xcite . here ,",
    "in particular , we study the role of such a signature change in the description of a diffusion process .",
    "our calculations are performed in the symmetry - reduced setup , where the isotropy and homogeneity of spacetime are assumed",
    ". then the hypersurface deformation algebra is equivalent to a deformed version of the poincar algebra .",
    "the explicit form of the latter deformation has so far been obtained only in the spherically symmetric case @xcite , where the algebra is effectively two - dimensional . the corresponding deformed poincar algebra ( as well as the coalgebra )",
    "was also studied in @xcite . in @xcite , by assuming equality between spectral and hausdorff dimensions , is has been suggested that the loop deformation of the hypersurface deformation algebra may lead to the dimensional reduction to @xmath12 .    in the next sections , inspired by the analysis performed in @xcite , we recover the form of a particular deformed four - dimensional poincar algebra by imposing certain reasonable conditions .",
    "while such a method does not lead to the unique form of the deformation , the obtained results allow to deduce a number of qualitative conclusions . in particular , as we show , the deformation may lead to the appearance of a new invariant energy scale .",
    "furthermore , we explicitly derive the invariant measure on momentum space , which turns out to be different from the one that could be naively expected from the form of the mass casimir .",
    "the symmetry algebra turns out to be compatible with the standard heisenberg algebra of phase space variables and therefore we assume that the latter algebra is undeformed .",
    "finally , ( in the momentum representation ) we calculate the average return probability and the resulting spectral dimension of spacetime , which is a function of the scale parameter .",
    "we consider two distinct cases , depending on the deformation parameter .",
    "the physical meaning and relations of the results with other approaches are discussed .    throughout this paper",
    "we use the planck units , where @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 denotes the planck mass .",
    "the perturbative analysis of the effective regime of loop quantum gravity has revealed ( see e.g. @xcite ) the following form of the quantum - deformed hypersurface deformation algebra : @xmath16,d[n^a_2 ] \\right\\ } & = d \\left [ n_1^b \\partial_b n^a_2 - n_2^b \\partial_b n^a_1 \\right ] , \\label{dhda1 }   \\\\ \\left\\ { s[n],d[n^a ] \\right\\ } & = -s \\left [ n^b \\partial_b n \\right ] , \\label{dhda2 }   \\\\ \\left\\ { s[n_1],s[n_2 ] \\right\\ } & = d \\left [ s \\omega q^{ab } ( n_1 \\partial_b n_2 - n_2 \\partial_b n_1 ) \\right ] , \\label{dhda3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 denotes the spatial metric , with spatial indices @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the spacetime metric signature . @xmath20",

    "due to the effects of lqg the scalar constraint is subject to a quantum deformation .",
    "moreover , the hypersurface deformation algebra itself is deformed through the presence of the factor @xmath24 , which is some function of gravitational field variables",
    ". the general form of this function in lqg is not yet known but it has been explicitly derived for specific symmetry reduced configurations . in the case when the sign of @xmath24 is constant the deformation can actually be absorbed by an appropriate transformation of variables , which can not be achieved if the sign is changing @xcite .    in particular ,",

    "@xmath33 is energy density of the matter content of universe and @xmath34 the maximal allowed value of energy density , expected to be of the order of the planck density .",
    "we note that the classical value @xmath35 is correctly recovered in the limit of low energy densities @xmath36 . on the other hand ,",
    "when the density reaches the maximum @xmath37 , the opposite value @xmath38 is achieved .",
    "since the deformation factor @xmath24 in ( [ dhda3 ] ) is accompanied by the metric signature @xmath19 , the change of the sign of @xmath24 can be interpreted as the signature change @xcite .",
    "namely , at low energy densities we have @xmath39 , which corresponds to the classical lorentzian ( for @xmath40 ) or euclidean ( for @xmath41 ) space , while at the maximal density @xmath42 , in the deep quantum regime , the effective signature becomes @xmath43 .",
    "moreover , at @xmath44 the sign of @xmath45 turns out to be indefinite ( i.e. @xmath46 ) , which can be associated with the state of so - called asymptotic silence or ultralocality @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we are going to consider the algebra ( [ dhda1]-[dhda3 ] ) restricted to linear hypersurface deformations , characterizing homogeneous and isotropic spacetime configurations .",
    "in such a case the above deformed algebra of constraints ( for @xmath40 ) is equivalent to a certain deformation of the poincar algebra , by which we mean the universal enveloping algebra of a lie algebra @xmath47 .",
    "as we discuss it in appendix , the limit of linear deformations can be imposed on ( [ dhda1]-[dhda3 ] ) by choosing the spatial metric to be given by the kronecker delta , @xmath48 and restricting the expressions for a lapse function and shift vector to the linear form : @xmath49 where @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the infinitesimal parameters of , respectively , a time translation , spatial translations , boosts and rotations .",
    "the rotation matrix can be expressed in terms of infinitesimal angles @xmath54 as @xmath55 . under such assumptions",
    "the scalar and diffeomorphism constraints can be expanded into the following combinations of the poincar algebra generators : @xmath56 & = s[\\delta t + v_a x^a ] = -\\delta t p_0 - v^a k_a\\ , , \\label{slin}\\\\ d[n^a ] & = d[\\delta x^a + { r^a}_b x^b ] = -v^b p_b - \\varphi^b j_b\\ , .",
    "\\label{dlin}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 denote the generators of time translations , spatial translations , boosts and rotations , respectively .    in appendix",
    "we show how the ( standard ) poincar algebra can be recovered by imposing the conditions @xmath48 and ( [ slin]-[dlin ] ) on the classical hypersurface algebra . the loop deformed algebra ( [ dhda1]-[dhda3 ] ) ,",
    "although very similar to the classical one , does not allow to straightforwardly apply the same methodology . while for the undeformed brackets ( [ dhda1]-[dhda2 ] ) the derivation of the corresponding sector of the poincar algebra is the same as in appendix , the bracket ( [ dhda3 ] ) contains the additional function @xmath24 inside the diffeomorphism constraint .",
    "the most convenient solution would be to find a way to extract @xmath24 in front of the constraint .",
    "however , apart from the perturbative approach , which has been used e.g. in deriving ( [ eq : ii.01 ] ) , it is not possible to do so directly .",
    "the strategy that we are going to apply here is based on the observation that a diffeomorphism constraint with some additional function @xmath61 of field variables inside can always be rewritten as the unmodified diffeomorphism constraint multiplied by a certain functional of @xmath61 .",
    "namely , @xmath62",
    "= f[f ] d[n^a]\\,,\\ ] ] where the functional @xmath63 $ ] is simply given by @xmath64 = \\frac{d[f n^a]}{d[n^a ] } = : \\langle f \\rangle_d\\,,\\ ] ] which can be interpreted as the diffeomorphism average of the function @xmath61 .",
    "then the problematic right hand side of ( [ dhda3 ] ) can be expressed as @xmath65   \\nonumber\\\\ & = s \\langle \\omega \\rangle_d d\\left[q^{ab } ( n_1 \\partial_b n_2 - n_2 \\partial_b n_1 ) \\right ] \\nonumber\\\\ & = -s_{\\text{eff}}(v^a p_a + \\varphi^a j_a)\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we introduce the effective signature @xmath66}{d\\left [ q^{ab }   ( n_1 \\partial_b n_2 - n_2 \\partial_b n_1 ) \\right]}\\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : ii.02}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since @xmath67 can now be treated just like the ordinary signature @xmath19 , it is possible to expand the bracket ( [ dhda3 ] ) in the same way as its classical counterpart ( [ hda3 ] ) .",
    "consequently , using the procedure discussed in appendix we obtain the deformed poincar algebra that is determined by the following brackets : @xmath68 where the effective signature @xmath69 appears only where @xmath19 is located in the standard poincar algebra .",
    "as one can see , @xmath70 is some unknown function of the symmetry generators , related via ( [ eq : ii.02 ] ) to the deformation factor @xmath24 , which is present at the level of the hypersurface deformation algebra .",
    "if the form of @xmath24 was known as a function of field variables , then one could also try to derive the form of @xmath70 , using e.g. the brown - york generators @xcite .",
    "precisely speaking , our deformed poincar algebra is a certain quotient of the tensor algebra defined by the brackets ( [ dp1]-[dp9 ] ) and the latter is actually a semi - classical deformation of a poisson algebra . in other words ,",
    "@xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 can be viewed as functions on classical phase space ( spacetime and the corresponding momentum space ) but satisfying the deformed brackets . passing to",
    "the quantum theory would require replacing @xmath71 $ ] and promoting @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 to quantum operators .",
    "however , for the purposes of this paper it is not necessary to discuss the full quantum picture ( in particular , in the framework of quantum groups ) and therefore we restrict the considerations to the semi - classical regime .",
    "as mentioned above , a priori we do not know the functional form of the deformation factor @xmath70 .",
    "however , we are able to constrain it using mathematical consistency and experience gained from the symmetry reduced models , as well as calculate it explicitly in some particular cases .",
    "let us first note that since @xmath70 is generally a non - trivial function of the algebra generators , the brackets ( [ dp1]-[dp9 ] ) do not define a lie algebra .",
    "nevertheless , it is reasonable to require the jacobi identities , which are a feature of the poincar ( lie ) algebra , to be satisfied even for a deformed version of this algebra .",
    "the main motivation to do so is that in such a case the ( standard ) leibnitz rule for the action of an algebra on itself is preserved .",
    "one can also naturally expect that @xmath70 is rotationally invariant .",
    "moreover , the ordinary poincar algebra should be recovered in the limit of vanishing deformation ( which will correspond to low energies ) .",
    "our final assumption , which we choose here as a specific simple example , is that @xmath70 depends only on the translation generators and is a separable function of the form @xmath72 , where @xmath73 and @xmath74 can be determined from the other conditions .",
    "if we allowed @xmath70 to depend on rotations @xmath59 and boosts @xmath60 , the analysis and interpretation of results would be much more difficult .    in the case of lorentzian signature @xmath40 the jacobi identities lead to a differential equation on @xmath75 , which has the solution @xmath76 with two independent real constants @xmath77 , @xmath78 . as we will now show",
    ", the classical limit imposes a relation between @xmath77 and @xmath78 .    by construction , ( [ omegasolution ] )",
    "commutes with all generators of the algebra ( [ dp1]-[dp9 ] ) and hence it is a casimir element of the latter .",
    "then the mass casimir element @xmath79 of the algebra ( determining the mass square of a particle whose symmetries are described by ( [ dp1]-[dp9 ] ) ) , with the standard classical limit , can be constructed as the appropriate combination of @xmath70 and the unit element , namely @xmath80 the conditions that have to be satisfied in order to recover the proper classical limit are @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is a ( positive or negative ) real constant .",
    "consequently , the mass casimir can be written as @xcite @xmath85 and the classical expression is recovered for @xmath86 .",
    "furthermore , taking into account the fact that @xmath83 , the deformation factor ( [ omegasolution ] ) simplifies to @xmath87 let us note that , in contrast to ( [ eq : ii.01 ] ) , @xmath70 is not a bounded quantity . in the calculations we assumed that in the limit @xmath86 the expression ( [ omegalorentz ] ) tends to @xmath88 , restoring the undeformed poincar algebra .",
    "below we will extend the symmetry algebra by the heisenberg algebra and identify the translation generators with components of a momentum .",
    "then ( [ omegalorentz ] ) can also be seen as tending to @xmath88 in the low energy limit @xmath89 , @xmath90 .",
    "let us now consider an extension of the symmetry algebra ( [ dp1]-[dp9 ] ) by the ( undeformed ) heisenberg algebra of spacetime positions @xmath91 and four - momenta @xmath92 , defined by the brackets @xmath93 with spacetime indices @xmath94 and where @xmath95 is the minkowski metric . applying the approach of @xcite we find the following realization of ( [ dp1]-[dp9 ] ) in terms of the @xmath91 and @xmath92 generators :",
    "@xmath96 the above expressions do not depend on the explicit form of @xmath97 .",
    "then for @xmath70 given by ( [ omegalorentz ] ) we find that the brackets of @xmath91 with the boost generators have the non - trivial form @xmath98 and satisfy all necessary jacobi identities . in this sense",
    "our deformed poincar algebra is compatible with the standard heisenberg algebra ( [ uh ] ) .",
    "the merger of these two algebras describes usual commutative spacetime and corresponding momentum space but endowed with deformed relativistic symmetries .",
    "however , such an extension of the symmetry algebra is ambiguous , since the latter alone is actually insufficient to determine the form of the heisenberg algebra . to this end",
    "we need also the coproduct and antipode on the algebra ( [ dp1]-[dp9 ] ) , which would turn the latter into a hopf algebra .",
    "then the appropriate heisenberg algebra could generally be constructed using the so - called smash product construction , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "therefore , in principle , ( [ dp1]-[dp9 ] ) can as well describe symmetries of a noncommutative spacetime , determined by some deformed heisenberg algebra .",
    "currently it is not yet known how the hopf algebraic structure of symmetries can be extracted from the loop quantization in 3 + 1 dimensions , apart from the ad hoc method of @xcite ( although it has recently been done in 2 + 1 dimensions @xcite ) . therefore ( [ uh ] ) should be understood as the simplest possible ansatz for the heisenberg algebra consistent with ( [ dp1]-[dp9 ] ) , which does not diverge too far from usual physics .",
    "the mass casimir element ( [ casimirlorentz ] ) is invariant under rotations , since it is constructed from the deformation factor ( [ omegalorentz ] ) .",
    "not surprisingly , the set of its symmetries is actually larger , since ( [ casimirlorentz ] ) is also preserved by an appropriate deformed version of the lorentz transformations , which we will now introduce .    for simplicity",
    "let us restrict to boosts with a velocity @xmath99 in the @xmath100 direction .",
    "then the deformed lorentz transformation of a four - momentum @xmath101 ( whose components are identified with the translation generators via ( [ eq : ii.03 ] ) ) has the following form : @xmath102 the difference with respect to the ordinary transformations is contained in the factor @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the usual lorentz factor . in the classical limit @xmath86 we correctly obtain @xmath105 .    a natural question in this context",
    "is the possibility of existence of an energy scale that is invariant under the action of transformations ( [ l1]-[l4 ] ) . indeed , solving the equation @xmath106 for @xmath57 we find that it has two solutions @xmath107 , although only when @xmath108",
    ". in other words , if we take an arbitrary four - momentum of the form @xmath109 ( with @xmath108 ) , then acting with a deformed boost ( [ l1]-[l4 ] ) we obtain the vector @xmath110 , which shows that the energy component @xmath57 is conserved .",
    "therefore @xmath107 are the invariant energy scales that we were looking for . meanwhile , in the case of @xmath111 such an invariant does not exist .",
    "let us note that @xmath107 , @xmath108 are distinguished values of energy within our model for other reasons as well .",
    "namely , both the deformation factor @xmath70 and mass casimir @xmath79 become divergent at @xmath112 .",
    "moreover , @xmath70 changes sign when crossing either @xmath112 or @xmath113 .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath111 we observe that @xmath70 is positive definite , there is no divergence of @xmath79 and hence no distinguished energy scale .",
    "it is also worth to mention that the invariant energy scale @xmath107 has some similar features to the invariant scale characterizing one of the models of doubly special relativity @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it can be suspected that the regions in four - momentum space determined by the energy values @xmath107  with @xmath114 , @xmath115 or @xmath116  are physically disconnected .",
    "more precisely , we want to check whether it is possible to boost a momentum from one region to another . to this end",
    "let us consider an arbitrary vector of the form @xmath117 , where @xmath118 , so that @xmath115 .",
    "a deformed boost with the velocity @xmath99 transforms the energy component into @xmath119 where always @xmath120 and hence @xmath121 .",
    "therefore energy remains in the range @xmath122 , unless we take superluminal velocities .",
    "choosing @xmath123 one can reach the analogous conclusions for momenta with @xmath57 lying above @xmath124 or below @xmath125 .",
    "these three regions can be , therefore , described as physically separated momentum subspaces .",
    "when four - momentum space is endowed with a given algebra of symmetries , then the latter determines the form of the infinitesimal invariant volume element , which plays the role of a measure on this momentum space . for the poincar algebra",
    "the invariant momentum space measure is simply @xmath126 . on the other hand , since the symmetry algebra ( [ dp1]-[dp9 ] ) and",
    "the corresponding transformations ( [ l1]-[l4 ] ) are a deformed counterpart of the poincar case , one can reasonably expect that the invariant measure on momentum space with the symmetries ( [ dp1]-[dp9 ] ) is an appropriate modification of @xmath126 .    in order to explore this issue",
    "we calculate the jacobian determinant of a momentum transformation ( [ l1]-[l4 ] ) @xmath127 the above result leads to the following relation between the measure in the initial coordinates and the one in the boosted coordinates : @xmath128 where @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "let us now try to find such a function @xmath131 that the condition @xmath132 is satisfied . from ( [ d4ptrans ] ) we infer that under a deformed boost ( [ l1]-[l4 ] ) the function @xmath131 has to transform as @xmath133",
    "furthermore , the correspondence with the classical case requires that in the limit @xmath86 we have @xmath134 .",
    "then the form of @xmath131 can be deduced by observing that there exists the equality @xmath135 combining all above relations we find the invariant momentum space measure @xmath136 this result will be crucial for calculating the average return probability in sec .",
    "[ rwsd ] .",
    "it is worth stressing that the measure ( [ mommeas ] ) differs from the one that could be naively expected from the mass casimir ( [ casimirlorentz ] ) .",
    "namely , writing ( [ casimirlorentz ] ) as @xmath137 one naturally deduces that the invariant measure should have the form @xmath138 however , the measure obtained in such a heuristic way is explicitly breaking the invariance with respect to the deformed boosts ( [ l1]-[l4 ] ) .",
    "so far we have focused on the lorentzian model , with the signature @xmath40 . however , to introduce a diffusion process on spacetime we actually need to consider the euclidean version of our deformed symmetry algebra .",
    "one the issues in this context is that the laplace operator defined on spacetime ( as well as in the momentum space representation ) has to be elliptic . for the model considered in this paper",
    "the situation is complicated by the fact that the sign of @xmath70 changes with energy .",
    "therefore , we expect the laplace operator to be of a mixed type ( either elliptic or hyperbolic , depending on the energy range ) . in order to be able to probe spacetime by diffusion from large scales up to small scales",
    "we restrict here to the situation where spacetime is euclidean at large scales .",
    "nevertheless , one has to keep in mind that for @xmath108 the sign of the euclidean version of @xmath70 changes and spacetime becomes lorentzian at energies exceeding @xmath124 , which is making the diffusion ill defined for such a regime of momenta . the alternative possibility would be to consider the lorentzian case discussed in sec .",
    "[ defpoinc ] , again with the sign changing @xmath70 .",
    "such a case is , however , also ill defined ( for @xmath108 ) since it would contain the regime where the measure is negative , leading to a substantial difficulty in interpreting the trace of heat kernel as the average return probability ( see sec .",
    "[ rwsd ] ) .",
    "the latter could be remedied @xcite by an appropriate modification of the diffusion equation but here we follow the conservative approach .    a transition from the lorentzian to",
    "euclidean domain can be performed either by an analytic continuation , called the wick rotation , or by introducing a priori the euclidean counterpart of the deformed poincar algebra . since the analytic continuation may turn out to be tricky , as it is the case for the @xmath10-poincar algebra (",
    "where the deformation parameter @xmath10 has to be analytically continued as well , although this is so due to the coalgebra @xcite ) , both of the possibilities are discussed below .",
    "the wick rotation that we consider here is the analytic continuation @xmath139 , @xmath140 . applying it to the deformed brackets ( [ dp1]-[dp9 ] ) we find that the only formulae that change are those depending on the effective signature @xmath69 , which become @xmath141 by redefining the signature @xmath19 to the correct euclidean value @xmath41 they can be restored to their previous form ( [ dp3 ] ) , ( [ dp7 ] ) but with the wick - rotated @xmath70 .",
    "namely , applying @xmath139 to the lorentzian deformation factor ( [ omegalorentz ] ) we obtain its euclidean counterpart @xmath142 and therefore the effective signature turns into @xmath143 .",
    "then the brackets ( [ dp1]-[dp9 ] ) define the deformed euclidean algebra , while in the low energy limit @xmath144 and hence the classical euclidean algebra is recovered .",
    "furthermore , wick - rotating the lorentzian casimir element ( [ casimirlorentz ] ) we obtain @xmath145 one can observe that for @xmath111 the expression ( [ casimireuclid1 ] ) is a positive definite function , while for @xmath108 it is positive below the invariant energy scale @xmath146 , negative above this scale @xmath147 and divergent at @xmath112 .",
    "the negativity of @xmath148 could indicate that we are entering the hyperbolic regime of the laplace operator .",
    "however , this is so only if the relation between the laplace operator and the mass casimir is linear , while in general this may not be the case .",
    "in order to explore the other possible definition of the euclidean counterpart of our model we first assume that @xmath41 . in this case the classical limit gives us the condition @xmath149 , equivalent to @xmath150 .",
    "the latter is the same as in the lorentzian case for the function @xmath70 .",
    "consequently , the solution for @xmath151 is analogous to ( [ omegasolution ] ) and reads @xmath152 the agreement with the expression ( [ omegaeuclid1 ] ) can be achieved by setting @xmath153 , for which ( [ omegaeucsol ] ) reduces to @xmath154 then the mass casimir is again given by a superposition of @xmath151 and the unit element , namely @xmath155 the conditions that guarantee the proper classical limit @xmath156 are @xmath81 and @xmath157 , leading to @xmath158 which is identical to ( [ casimireuclid1 ] ) , as it should .",
    "we have already collected all necessary ingredients to address the main subject of this paper  a diffusion process on ( wick - rotated ) spacetime with the deformed symmetries ( [ dp1]-[dp9 ] ) .",
    "namely , on a riemannian manifold of @xmath159 topological dimensions and with the metric @xmath160 a diffusion ( or random walk ) is described by the heat equation @xmath161 where @xmath162 denotes the auxiliary time ( which plays the role of a scale parameter ) , @xmath163 is the laplacian and we assume the initial condition @xmath164 in general , the laplacian may differ from the usual one @xmath165 , @xmath166 . for @xmath167 with the standard euclidean metric the solution to ( [ heatkernel ] ) ,",

    "then phase space has the ordinary structure and it seems that the usual notion of the fourier transform should be preserved .",
    "however , in the case of models characterized by non - trivial phase space the fourier transform can be substantially different from the standard one @xcite .",

    "[ invmeas ] can perhaps be coming from the corresponding modification of the fourier transform , which arises due to the deformation of symmetries ( [ dp1]-[dp9 ] ) , irrespective of the form of the heisenberg algebra .    in order to correctly define the counterpart of the heat kernel ( [ hksol ] ) for the considered model we have to make two changes that we have already suggested .",
    "namely , use the appropriate laplace operator @xmath169 and the invariant measure on momentum space @xmath171 .",
    "the invariance is necessary to guarantee the independence of the results from a particular reference frame , which has to be fulfilled at the level of the average return probability @xmath172 obtained by the space averaging of the return probability @xmath173 .",
    "both @xmath169 and @xmath171 should be invariant quantities , leading to the invariance of the whole expression .",
    "then the spectral dimension is defined as @xmath174 and is a function of the scale parameter @xmath162 .",
    "nevertheless , in our case @xmath160 is the euclidean metric and hence @xmath175 .",
    "the invariance of the laplace operator @xmath169 under rotations and deformed boosts is guaranteed by the fact that it can be expressed in terms of the euclidean mass casimir as @xmath176 the last term has been included to show that , in general , higher order powers of the casimir may contribute to the expression for @xmath169 .",
    "however , here we restrict to the simplest possibility , setting @xmath177 , simply due to the fact that we do not know what the extra @xmath178 parameters could be .",
    "taking @xmath179 given by ( [ casimireuclid2 ] ) and the invariant measure ( [ mommeas ] ) we can finally write the following average return probability : @xmath180 here we introduce the notation @xmath181 and @xmath182 , while @xmath183 and @xmath184 denote the corresponding ranges of integration .",
    "the above expression can be given the probabilistic interpretation when @xmath185 .",
    "it also has the correct classical limit @xmath186 for which one obtains @xmath187 .",

    ", we measure the same dimension of ( wick - rotated ) spacetime as for the four - dimensional minkowski spacetime .",

    "another possibility is that , in contrast to the previous subsection , energy is restricted to the range between the invariant scales , i.e. @xmath198 $ ] .",
    "then , performing the calculations analogously to ( [ eq : vi.01 ] ) , we find that ( [ psigma ] ) has the form @xmath199 with the following asymptotic behaviors : @xmath200 and @xmath201 the spectral dimension corresponding to ( [ eq : vi.02 ] ) can only be obtained numerically and its running is shown in fig .",

    "in principle we could also consider the cases with @xmath205 $ ] or @xmath206 $ ] .",
    "however , this would not allow us to probe the large scale limit of spacetime , which is associated with low energy contributions to the laplace operator .",
    "the last remaining case is given by @xmath111 .",
    "for the lorentzian signature @xmath40 the sign of @xmath70 remains constant irrespective of the values of @xmath208 and @xmath193 , and hence the signature change does not occur . in turn , the euclidean @xmath151 changes its sign at @xmath209 .",
    "nevertheless , the laplace operator @xmath169 remains elliptic in the whole range of @xmath208 and @xmath193 and we have no reason to restrict the intervals @xmath183 and @xmath184 .",

    "obtain @xmath212 which has the asymptotic behaviors : @xmath200 and @xmath213 the analytic expression for the running spectral dimension calculated from ( [ eq : vi:03 ] ) is quite complicated and we do not show it here but the corresponding plot is presented in fig .",

    "the latter ultraviolet value can have the following interpretation . at high energies @xmath214 the deformation factor",
    "@xmath70 tends to zero , corresponding to the so - called ultralocal @xcite or carrollian limit @xcite of spacetime and its relativistic symmetries . in the carrollian limit , in which the speed of light is taken to zero ,",
    "spacelike separated points become effectively decoupled , due to the collapse of their lightcones into null worldlines .",
    "then spacetime becomes a congruence of such ( one - dimensional ) worldlines , as it is schematically depicted in fig .",
    "[ assil ] . since increasing energy is equivalent to probing smaller scales of spacetime , we indeed have the dimensional reduction to @xmath0 .",
    "such a value is consistent with the analysis @xcite of loop quantum cosmology in the case characterized by the hypersurface deformation algebra ( [ dhda1]-[dhda3 ] ) .",
    "the significance of these results is that ultralocality is one of the features of the belinsky - khalatnikov - lifshitz ( bkl ) conjecture @xcite or asymptotic silence scenario .",
    "on the other hand , in @xcite it has been argued that asymptotic silence is characterized by the dimensional reduction to 2 , which results from an elongation of the anisotropic cosmological model in one particular direction during each of the kasner epochs .",
    "then spacetime effectively has one spatial and one temporal direction .",
    "however , such a viewpoint is in contradiction with ultralocality , which is achieved first in the bkl scenario .",
    "namely , in this scenario universe first decouples into non - interacting points of space , each described by the minisuperspace homogeneous cosmological model .",
    "then the chaotic dynamics is acting at the level of the points . treating an elongation in the internal space of a point as an elongation in the three - dimensional space violates the initial suppression of the spatial dependence of fields .",
    "therefore , the interpretation in which the bkl conjecture leads to the dimensional reduction to 1 seems to be better justified .",
    "it should be stressed that the results in this subsection ( as well as in the previous ones ) have been obtained in the euclidean domain of the model , which can be treated either as an independent case or as the wick - rotated version of the lorentzian model . the second possibility is supported by the observed consistency with the lorentzian picture of the collapse of lightcones . therefore , we conclude that the dimensional reduction of our model does not fundamentally depend on the spacetime metric signature .",
    "this is also in agreement with the fact that , irrespective of the signature @xmath19 , in the limit @xmath215 ( or @xmath216 ) the effective signature @xmath69 ( or @xmath217 ) tends to zero and the deformed algebra ( [ dp1]-[dp9 ] ) becomes the ( standard ) carroll algebra .",
    "the analysis presented in this paper addressed the issue of probing a loop - quantized spacetime configuration by the diffusion process .",
    "the considered model was given by minkowski spacetime but with symmetries described by a deformed poincar algebra whose form is motivated by the predictions of the effective regime of loop quantum gravity . while the exact form of such an algebra is still unknown in general , we proposed a specific case that has the structure recovered from the loop - deformed hypersurface deformation algebra .",
    "namely , using reasonable assumptions , like the conservation of the jacobi identities by the deformed poincar algebra , we have determined the particular form of the deformation factor .",
    "we assumed an extension of such a symmetry algebra by the standard heisenberg algebra of phase space variables .",
    "subsequently we showed that our symmetry algebra leads to deformed lorentz transformations , which preserve two distinguished energy scales .",
    "we have also derived the form of the invariant momentum space measure .",
    "the above ingredients were applied to precisely define ( after the wick rotation ) and analyze the diffusion process on spacetime endowed with the considered deformed algebra of symmetries . in particular , we have found that in the case in which the deformation factor tends to zero in the high energy limit , the spectral dimension reduces to @xmath0 at small scales , as it is expected in the asymptotic silence scenario . besides , the presence of the invariant energy scale allows to consider our model as an example of the doubly special relativity ( dsr ) , which could be further studied within the latter framework .",
