    "the determination of the condensates of the qcd vacuum is a very important issue in phenomenology of strong interactions @xcite .",
    "as known , it can only be done in a non - perturbative formulation of the theory . at present ,",
    "not much is known about the condensates from first principles .",
    "some attempts exist to determine them on the lattice or in the models of the instanton vacuum . in practice ,",
    "however , the qcd sum rules still remain a basic tool for doing so .",
    "thus , there is a strong need for new alternative approaches to the problem .",
    "the ads / cft correspondence @xcite has opened new avenues for studying strongly coupled gauge theories . although the original proposal was for conformal theories , various modifications",
    "have been found that produce , in particular , gauge / string duals with a mass gap , confinement , and supersymmetry breaking @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we continue our study of the condensates within gauge / string duality . in @xcite , we estimated the value of the gluon condensate with a result that is surprisingly close to the original phenomenological estimate of @xcite . as known , qcd is a very rich theory supposed to describe the whole spectrum of strong interaction phenomena .",
    "the question naturally arises : how well does gauge / string duality describe other condensates ? here , we attempt to _ analytically _ determine a function @xmath2 and a parameter @xmath0 , which appear in nonlocal and mixed condensates , as an important step toward answering this question .",
    "the simplest quark - gluon mixed condensate is that associated with a dimension-5 operator constructed from the quark and gluon fields as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is an antisymmetric combination of @xmath5-matrices .",
    "it is well known that it plays an important role in various qcd sum rules @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath0 appears as a constant of proportionality in the conventional parametrization @xcite    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is a quark ( chiral ) condensate and @xmath8 is a gauge coupling constant .    one possible way to determine both the mixed condensate and the parameter @xmath0 is to consider a nonperturbative gauge invariant correlator , also known as the nonlocal condensate ,    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is a path - ordered wilson line defined as @xmath11 $ ] . here",
    "@xmath12 is a parameter of the path running from @xmath13 at @xmath14 to @xmath15 at @xmath16 .",
    "the path is taken to be a straight line .",
    "if one sets @xcite    @xmath17    then @xmath0 is given by the coefficient of @xmath18 , with @xmath19 , in the expansion of the function @xmath2 as @xmath20    @xmath21    note that this formula holds in euclidean space .",
    "in minkowski space it is modified by replacing @xmath22 @xcite .    before proceeding to the detailed analysis ,",
    "let us set the basic framework for the dual description .",
    "we take the dual string spacetime as a product of five - dimensional space , with the euclidean metric    @xmath23    and some five - dimensional internal space @xmath24 . here",
    "@xmath25 is a parameter whose value can be fixed from the heavy quark potential ( cornell model ) or the slope of the regge trajectory of @xmath26 mesons .",
    "we also take a constant dilaton and discard other background fields . in",
    "what follows , we assume a trivial dependence on the internal space @xmath24 . unlike other string duals , this model does share a few key features with qcd that singles it out and makes it very attractive for phenomenology : first , the model is a nearly conformal theory at uv , where it leads to the quadratic corrections @xcite .",
    "second , the model results in a phenomenologically satisfactory description of the confining potential @xcite .",
    "finally , at finite chemical potential its extension provides the phenomenologically acceptable equation of state for cold quark matter @xcite .",
    "to begin with , we will make an ansatz for computing the function @xmath2 within gauge / string duality whose justification , initially , is that it combines the ingredients at hand in the most natural way .",
    "gradually , further evidence for the ansatz will emerge .",
    "let us set the quark operators and the wilson line on a four - manifold which is the boundary of a five - dimensional manifold .",
    "we will assume that the function @xmath2 is given in terms of the area ( in string units ) of a surface in the five - dimensional manifold by    @xmath27    here @xmath28 is the area of a surface sketched in figure 1 .",
    "it is worth noting that a similar representation suggested in @xcite has proven successful for studying the expectation value of the polyakov loop in pure gauge theories .",
    "recently , it was shown in @xcite that it also reproduces the exponential decay of the correlator @xmath29 at large separations , as expected in qcd . in the model with dynamical quarks",
    "it appeared in @xcite .",
    "a difference is that here the wilson loop goes along an internal direction on a five - dimensional boundary .",
    "following @xcite , we will now describe the shape of the static string stretched between the quark sources in the background geometry .",
    "first we set the quark operators at @xmath30 on the boundary ( @xmath31 ) , as shown in figure 1 .",
    "next , we make use of the nambu - goto action endowed with the background metric    @xmath32    in the static gauge @xmath33 and @xmath34 , the action becomes    @xmath35    where @xmath36 .",
    "a prime denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath37 .",
    "then , as in @xcite , we find the equation of motion for @xmath38    @xmath39    as well as its first integral    @xmath40    the integration constant can be expressed in terms of the maximum value of @xmath38 . on symmetry grounds ,",
    "the function @xmath41 has a maximum at @xmath42 .",
    "it is @xmath43 , as shown in figure 1 .",
    "since @xmath41 is an even function , we pick a fundamental domain defined by @xmath44 .",
    "moreover , it is convenient to use the inverse function @xmath45 subject to the boundary conditions    @xmath46    using these boundary conditions , the solution to equation in the fundamental domain is    @xmath47    where @xmath48 . finally , the solution on the interval @xmath49 is simply @xmath50 .",
    "if we set @xmath31 , then becomes    @xmath51    which is the form in which it is written in @xcite .",
    "having found the function @xmath45 describing the string shape , we can now calculate the renormalized area of the surface shown in figure 1 .    to begin with ,",
    "we choose the gauge @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "then we substitute this into the action to obtain    @xmath54    here we have rescaled @xmath38 such that @xmath55 .",
    "the integral is divergent at @xmath56 due to the factor @xmath57 in the metric . to proceed , therefore , we need to regularize it .",
    "a way to deal with this divergence is to cut off the integral at @xmath58 .",
    "so , we have ( up to terms vanishing for @xmath59 )    @xmath60 \\,.\\ ] ]    now , by integration by parts , the action is    @xmath61 \\,,\\ ] ]    where @xmath62 is the imaginary error function .    as in @xcite",
    ", we use the modified minimal subtraction scheme to deal with the power divergence .",
    "so , we subtract @xmath63 , where @xmath64 denotes a constant whose value must be specified from renormalization conditions . finally , using we get    @xmath65      actually , the function @xmath66 is written in parametric form given by equations and . at this time it is not clear to us how to eliminate the parameter @xmath67 and find @xmath2 as a function of @xmath68 .",
    "we can , however , gain some important insights into the problem by considering two limiting cases .",
    "first , let us have a close look at @xmath69 .",
    "according to @xcite , it is a continuously growing function defined on the interval @xmath70 $ ] .",
    "the asymptotic behavior near zero is given by    @xmath71    where @xmath72 .",
    "since @xmath73 means @xmath20 , small @xmath67 s correspond to small values of @xmath68 .",
    "the asymptotic behavior near @xmath15 is given by    @xmath74    thus , this region corresponds to large values of @xmath68 .    at this point",
    "a comment is in order .",
    "if we take @xmath75 $ ] , then there exists the upper bound on the maximum value of @xmath38 such that @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "in view of the formula , this means that @xmath77 as @xmath78 .",
    "once the behavior of @xmath69 is understood , we can use it to study the properties of the function @xmath2 at short and long distances .",
    "we begin with the case of small @xmath68 .",
    "expanding the right hand side of equation in @xmath67 , in next - to - leading order we have    @xmath79    then combining this with , we find the desired behavior of the function @xmath2 at short distances    @xmath80    where @xmath81 and @xmath82    in a similar spirit , we can explore the long distance behavior of @xmath2 .",
    "it follows from that in the neighborhood of @xmath83 the renormalized area behaves as    @xmath84    along with the relation , this means that the function @xmath2 decays exponentially at long distances as    @xmath85    where known as the correlation length has been also computed in @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath86 this behavior is precisely analogous to what is expected in qcd .",
    "having understood the two limiting cases , we are now able to make some estimates relevant to phenomenology .    to make an estimate of the parameter @xmath0 , we need to fix a value for the constant @xmath64 .",
    "first , we will fix it from the standard normalization of @xmath2 that is @xmath87 @xcite .",
    ", it requires a caveat . in section 3",
    ", we will propose a more refined way .",
    "] from , we find that @xmath88 . given the value of @xmath64 , we can estimate the parameter @xmath0 , with the result    @xmath89    here we have used @xmath90 and @xmath91 as it follows from the fits to the slopes for the regge trajectory of @xmath26 mesons @xcite and the linear term of the cornell potential @xcite .",
    "there is a long history of attempts to estimate the value of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "according to the original phenomenological estimate based on the qcd sum rules @xcite , which is widely accepted , it is given by @xmath92 .",
    "thus , our estimate is very satisfying at this point .",
    "of course , there are other estimates which are also close to the original value . for comparison , lattice simulations @xcite and the field correlator method @xcite both result in somewhat larger values , of order @xmath93 .    to complete the picture ,",
    "let us estimate the parameter @xmath94 resulting from long distances . with our values for the parameters",
    ", we have    @xmath95    this value is surprisingly closed to the pion mass that may be an indication that at long distances the correlator is dominated by the lightest meson contribution .    on the other hand ,",
    "our stringy construction suggests a natural normalization condition @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the string tension ( the coefficient of the linear term in the cornell potential ) . for a typical value of @xmath98",
    ", it gives @xmath99 together with @xmath100 .",
    "this simple estimate allows us to draw the following conclusions :    \\(i ) the value of @xmath94 is now close to the lowest energy level of the heavy - light mesons in the heavy quark effective theory @xcite which is around @xmath101 .",
    "this suggests that at long distances the correlator is dominated by this lowest state .",
    "\\(ii ) @xmath0 is definitely larger than @xmath102 ( up to a factor of @xmath103 ) , and that it is of order @xmath104 .",
    "interestingly , the lattice calculation of @xcite and the instanton liquid model of @xcite yield even larger values , about @xmath105 .",
    "\\(iii ) an additional free parameter is needed if one also wants @xmath87 . a simple way to introduce",
    "it is to use a slightly modified ansatz @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is the normalization constant defined by eq ..    some comments about the value of @xmath0 .",
    "the procedure for determining @xmath0 is very sensitive to the procedure of extracting the power divergence .",
    "this is consistent with the literature , where the values show significant scatter ( up to a factor of @xmath108 ) .",
    "one of the motivations for this work was to calculate it in a new nonperturbative approach that would shed light on this problem .",
    "finally , let us present the results of numerical calculations .",
    "the parametric equations and predict a characteristic form for the function @xmath2 , as shown by the upper curve in figure 2 .",
    "it is of great interest to compare this form with phenomenological models .",
    "various possibilities of those have been discussed in the literature . here",
    "we will consider two simple models , say a and b , for the vacuum distribution function @xmath109 which in euclidean space is related to @xmath2 by an integral transform @xmath110 .",
    "following @xcite , we take @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "both these functions reproduce @xmath113 for large @xmath68 .",
    "the normalization is chosen so that the zeroth moment is @xmath114 or , equivalently , @xmath87 .",
    "in addition , the first moment must obey @xmath115 .",
    "we see that in the phenomenologically important interval @xmath116 our model is closer to the model b whose distribution function falls exponentially at large @xmath12 . for @xmath117",
    "the agreement between the models is quite good .",
    "the maximum discrepancy occurred at @xmath118 is of order 25 % .",
    "there is a large number of open problems associated with the circle of ideas explored in this paper . in this section",
    "we list a few .",
    "\\(i ) our analysis is not very accurate for various reasons . for one thing ,",
    "the string breaking effect must be included in the calculation of the renormalized area @xmath28 .",
    "what happens when a light @xmath119 pair is created ?",
    "the surface is now modified by the string decay , like that of figure 3 .",
    "thus , one might expect that this would require improvement of the analysis of section 2 at large distances . at this point",
    "it is worth noting that the string breaking scale is of order @xmath120 .",
    "therefore , it is tempting to say that the discrepancy with the phenomenological models of figure 2 for @xmath121 is a result of the string breaking effect .        also , the normalization of the nonperturbative correlator @xmath29 ( function @xmath2 ) at @xmath122 is problematic : one might worry that this is a territory of perturbative qcd .",
    "it is therefore interesting to see what happens if the correlator is normalized at a length scale @xmath123 .",
    "for doing so , let us set @xmath124 and see whether @xmath0 has a reasonable value . as before , we take @xmath125 and @xmath91 . using , we find numerically that a solution to @xmath126 is @xmath127 . with this value of @xmath67",
    ", the renormalized area vanishes at @xmath128 . finally , we get from              now , a problem arises .",
    "if one tries to compute the function @xmath2 within the model based on a truncated ads space , where the shape of a static string is the same as in ads space until the string is long enough to reach the cutoff ( ir brane location ) @xcite , how can the expansion occur ?",
    "\\(iii ) an interesting observation of lattice simulations @xcite is that at low temperatures ( below @xmath133 ) the parameter @xmath0 is almost independent of the temperature .",
    "we can gain some understanding of this by writing the dual string spacetime either as , with @xmath134 a periodic variable of period @xmath135 , or as @xcite      where @xmath137 . since small @xmath68 s",
    "correspond to small @xmath138 s , we expand the five - dimensional metric around the @xmath131 background by writing @xmath139 and @xmath109 as power series in @xmath38 . the first term in the expansion is a constant which equals @xmath15 .",
    "it comes from the @xmath131 metric .",
    "the second term determines the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "it is due to the leading correction to the @xmath131 metric . in our case",
    "the correction is independent of the temperature , so the parameter @xmath0 is independent , too .",
    "this reasoning , however , requires a caveat at high temperatures , where the expansion around @xmath131 is no more appropriate .",
    "\\(iv ) in section 2 we cut off the integral over @xmath140 .",
    "what if we had chosen to cut off the integral over @xmath38 and then subtract @xmath141 ? in that case the large @xmath68 behavior of @xmath28 remains unaffected since @xmath142 as @xmath78 , but @xmath138 depends on @xmath68 at smaller @xmath68 so the small @xmath68 behavior of @xmath28 will be different . at large distances . ]",
    "although we have no satisfactory explanation of why the regularization of section 2 is more appropriate , we chose it because it leads to quite reasonable results .",
    "\\(v ) as a final remark , we should point out that in holographic qcd @xmath0 is treated as a free parameter whose value is fixed by phenomenology @xcite . in such an approach one starts from a five - dimensional effective field theory action , somehow motivated by string theory but without higher derivatives terms ( stringy @xmath143 corrections ) , and tries to fit it to qcd as much as possible .",
    "one might think of criticizing this approach on the grounds that it does nt include ( all ) stringy @xmath143 corrections to the effective action ( for example , see @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , it is tempting to determine the value of @xmath0 by saying that it can be done as a result of the @xmath143 corrections .",
    "as we have seen above , the effective string theory description provides evidence for this by showing the @xmath143-dependence of @xmath0 .",
