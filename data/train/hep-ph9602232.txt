    "the dynamics of relaxation of inhomogeneous field configurations out of equilibrium is an important problem and a common theme in cosmology and high energy physics .",
    "in high energy physics the experimental possibility of studying the chiral and quark - gluon phase transition with high luminosity hadron colliders and upcoming heavy - ion colliders makes imperative the understanding of relaxation and transport processes in extreme environments@xcite .",
    "a very exciting possibility@xcite that can be studied in high energy - high luminosity hadron collisions or relativistic heavy ion collisions within the energy range of the upcoming rhic and lhc colliders , is that after the chiral phase transition , regions in which the chiral condensate is misaligned with respect to the vacuum state are formed .    in these ultra - high energy heavy ion collisions ( @xmath3 ) a large energy density ( a few @xmath4 )",
    "is deposited in the collision region corresponding to temperatures above the critical value for chiral symmetry restoration @xmath5 . in this situation ,",
    "it is possible that within a volume of a few @xmath6 an inhomogeneous coherent field configuration is formed corresponding to a region in space in which the chiral symmetry is restored .",
    "the idea@xcite is that as these regions cool down they relax towards the equilibrium situation emitting a large number of soft pions .",
    "such a configuration has been dubbed a ` disoriented chiral condensate ' ( dcc ) .",
    "bjorken , kowalski and taylor proposed a ` baked alaska'@xcite scenario in which this configuration relaxes via the copious emision of pions strongly correlated in isospin .",
    "such a scenario could also explain the centauro events observed in cosmic rays in which the ratio of charged to neutral pions is different from @xmath7@xcite .",
    "a microscopic , field theoretical description of the dynamics of relaxation of these field configurations with typically large amplitudes faces at least two major obstacles .",
    "the first is a non - perturbative treatment of inhomogeneous , large amplitude field configurations .",
    "the second is a consistent description of non - equilibrium processes that can allow a _ real time _",
    "calculation of the evolution .",
    "recently there has been a surge of interest in the description of non - equilibrium processes both in cosmology and high energy physics .",
    "we refer to non - equilibrium processes to those corresponding to the the time evolution of quantum states in field theory which * are not * hamiltonian eigenstates as well as the time evolution density matrices that do not commute with the hamiltonian . in particular the relaxation of strong electric fields@xcite and the evolution of homogeneous scalar order parameters during phase transitions in minkowski and cosmological spacetimes @xcite .",
    "the non - equilibrium aspects of disoriented chiral condensates have been studied within different approximation schemes by several authors@xcite , but mainly focusing on homogeneous expectation values or correlation functions .    however , to the best of our knowledge , these studies focused on the evolution of a homogeneous but time ( or proper time ) dependent mean field and fluctuations around it but did not address the relaxational dynamics of _ inhomogeneous _ field configurations including _ quantum and thermal _ effects .    moreover ,",
    "inhomogeneous field configurations appear in cosmology when topological objects , such as textures or cosmic strings involving inhomogeneous field configurations are considered .",
    "their relaxational dynamics is thought to have a bearing on the spectrum of fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background radiation @xcite .",
    "the focus of this article is to study the _ linear _ relaxational dynamics of inhomogeneous , coherent field configurations both at zero and finite temperature in the @xmath8 linear sigma model .",
    "as is known such model is the relevant field theory for the description of chiral condensates .",
    "we use out of equilibrium closed time path methods @xcite combined with the amplitude expansion @xcite to study the time evolution of @xmath9 .",
    "we consider small initial field amplitudes such that we can keep just the linear term in the amplitude expansion . in such approximation",
    "the field evolution equations linearize .    whereas the focus is on the description of the dynamics within the setting of the chiral phase transition , the analysis presented below applies to a wide variety of physical situations in which a inhomogeneous scalar order parameter relaxes to the equilibrium situation via the production of lighter scalar fields in a medium .",
    "the main idea is that after a phase transition ( within the framework of dcc s the chiral phase transition ) regions are formed within which the scalar order parameter is inhomogeneous . as the zero momentum component rolls towards the equilibrium value , these inhomogeneous configurations will relax in such a way that the spatial gradients of the field configuration become smaller so as to decrease the energy .",
    "this relaxation will be accompanied by the production of quanta , such as pions in the case of dcc s .    here",
    "we study the o(4 ) linear sigma model in the broken symmetry state , at temperatures below the chiral phase transition as an effective low energy theory of @xmath10 ( up and down quarks ) which presumably incorporates the effects of strongly interacting qcd on chiral dynamics@xcite .",
    "wilczek and rajagopal@xcite have argued that the o(4 ) linear sigma model effectively describes the same _ equilibrium _ universality class of qcd with two flavors of light quarks and proposed to study it within the context of dcc .",
    "clearly this simple model misses a great number of degrees of freedom , hadrons , vector mesons , etc . and can only be justified as an effective description at temperatures well below the chiral phase transition when the degrees of freedom with much higher masses are not relevant .",
    "the linear sigma model may also be obtained as a landau - ginsburg effective theory from a nambu - jona - lasinio model@xcite which is a popular description of the phenomenology of chiral symmetry at the quark level and which has also been used as an alternative description of dccs@xcite .",
    "the o(4 ) linear sigma model has also been studied within the context of texture type configurations deemed relevant in certain cosmological models of structure formation@xcite , hence our study may be relevant in these cosmological scenarios as well .",
    "we will restrict our study to the case in which the condensate occurs in the isoscalar channel , without isospin violation . in section",
    "ii we introduce the model , discuss its range of validity and summarize aspects of non - equilibrium field theory relevant to the calculation .",

    "at this point we recognize that the linear @xmath0-model is a strongly coupled effective theory and any perturbative approximation will be subject to criticism .",
    "this important objection notwithstanding , we pursue the study of the non - equilibrium evolution of the condensate with the hope of learning new features of the decay of the condensate that will perhaps be rather generic and persist in higher order calculations or eventually in a non - perturbative treatment .",
    "since we want to understand the relaxation of inhomogeneous perturbations of the condensate around the equilibrium value @xmath21 , we write @xmath22 where the average above stands for the expectation value in the non - equilibrium state discussed below , and the fluctuation field @xmath23 describes the @xmath0 mesons in the broken symmetry state .",
