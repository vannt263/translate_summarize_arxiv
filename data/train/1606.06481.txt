    "this work continues the study of multiphoton processes @xmath7 in the center - of - mass ( c.m . )",
    "energy domain @xmath8 gev with the snd detector  @xcite .",
    "the main goal of these studies is the measurement of radiative decays of excited vector resonances of the @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 families  @xcite , as well as the search for rare processes of @xmath12-even resonance production in the @xmath3 annihilation  @xcite .",
    "while searching for the rare reactions mentioned above , hadronic processes containing @xmath10-meson in the final state decaying into @xmath13 constitute a significant background ( the @xmath14 branching fraction is @xmath15  @xcite ) .",
    "for example , the process @xmath16",
    "@xcite dominates in the five - photon final state and hinders the search for the radiative processes @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "the @xmath19 process studied in this work is important to search for the radiative processes @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "a possible source of hadronic background in the @xmath22 final state is the process @xmath5 .    at energies below 2 gev ,",
    "the total cross section of @xmath3 annihilation into hadrons needed , for example , to calculate the running coupling constant of the electromagnetic interactions , is determined as a sum of exclusive hadronic cross sections .",
    "the process @xmath5 has not previously been measured and was not included in this sum . in this work",
    "we select this process for the first time and measure its cross section .",
    "the snd detector collects data at the @xmath3 collider vepp-2000  @xcite operating at c.m .",
    "energies @xmath23 gev .",
    "this analysis uses data collected in 2010 - 2012 . during the experiments",
    ", the energy range 1.05 - 2.00 gev was scanned several times with a step of 20 - 25 mev . because of the smallness of statistics , we measure the cross section averaged over the energy intervals , listed in table  [ tabl1 ] .",
    "a detailed description of the snd detector is given in refs .",
    "the main part of this non - magnetic detector is a three - layer spherical electromagnetic calorimeter based on nai(tl ) crystals .",
    "the solid angle coverage of the calorimeter is 95% of 4@xmath24 .",
    "its energy resolution for photons is @xmath25{e_\\gamma({\\rm gev})}$ ] , and the angular resolution is about @xmath26 .",
    "direction of charged particles are measured in a tracking system consisting of a nine - layer drift chamber and a proportional chamber with the signal readout from the cathode strips .",
    "the solid angle coverage of the tracking system is 94% of 4@xmath24 . from the outside",
    "the snd calorimeter is surrounded by a muon system . in this analysis ,",
    "the muon system veto is used to suppress the cosmic - ray background .",
    "simulation of the signal and background processes is performed using monte - carlo generators that take into account initial - state radiative corrections calculated according to ref .",
    "in particular , emission of an additional photon is simulated with the angular distribution according to ref  @xcite .",
    "interactions of the particles produced in the @xmath3 annihilation with the detector material are modeled using the geant4 package  @xcite .",
    "simulation takes into account changes in the experimental conditions during the data taking , in particular , dead detector channels and variations of the beam - induced background .",
    "the beam background leads to the appearance of spurious photons and charged tracks in data events . to account for this effect in the simulation , special background events , recorded during the experiment with a random trigger ,",
    "fired detector channels in these events are superimposed on the simulated events .    in this work ,",
    "the @xmath0 process is studied in the channel @xmath27 .",
    "since the final state for the process under study contains no charged particles , we use the process @xmath28 for normalization . as a result of the normalization a part of systematic uncertainties associated with the hardware event selection and",
    "spurious charged tracks from the beam background are canceled out .",
    "accuracy of the luminosity measurement using the @xmath28 process is 2.2%  @xcite .",
    "the selection of signal @xmath27 events is performed in two stages .",
    "initially , events with exactly 7 photons with energy greater than 20 mev , no charged particles , and for which the muon - system veto is not triggered , are selected .",
    "for these events , the following conditions on the total energy deposition in the calorimeter @xmath29 and on the total event momentum @xmath30 , calculated using energy depositions in calorimeter crystals , are imposed : @xmath31 the transverse profile of the energy deposition in the calorimeter for reconstructed photons is required to be consistent with that expected for an electromagnetic shower  @xcite .",
    "the latter requirement provides separation of events with well isolated photons from those with merged photons or with clusters in the calorimeter produced by @xmath32 mesons .",
    "the main background processes are the following : @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 with the decay @xmath37 .",
    "the process @xmath38 , having five photons in the final state , is a background source because of a relatively large cross section .",
    "additional photons in @xmath38 events arise from splitting of electromagnetic showers , initial state radiation , and beam - induced background .",
    "further selection of events is based on kinematic fits , which use the measured photon angles and energies as input parameters .",
    "the fit is performed under the hypothesis that the seven - photon event proceed through the particular set of intermediate particles ( with corresponding mass constraints ) , and satisfies energy - momentum conservation laws . as a result of the kinematic fit , photon energies are refined and the @xmath39 of the assumed kinematic hypothesis is calculated .",
    "first of all , the @xmath40 hypothesis is tested , and the condition @xmath41 is imposed .",
    "then the photon pairs , candidates for the @xmath42 and @xmath43 mesons , are searched .",
    "it is required that the invariant mass of the candidate is in the range @xmath44 .",
    "events with one @xmath43 meson candidate and two @xmath42 candidates are selected as possible signal events . to suppress the background from the processes @xmath45 , events containing three @xmath42 candidates",
