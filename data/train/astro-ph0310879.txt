    "large - scale bars are present in some @xmath1 of all disk galaxies ( knapen et al 2000 ; eskridge et al . 2000 ) .",
    "secondary stellar bars within large - scale bars are also common , occurring in about @xmath2 of barred galaxies ( laine et al .",
    "2002 ; erwin & sparke 2002 ) .",
    "interest in secondary stellar bars is motivated by the hypothesis that they are a mechanism for driving gas to small radii to feed the supermassive black holes powering active galactic nuclei ( e.g. regan & mulchaey 1999 ) . however , the efficiency of such transport is uncertain because of the complete lack of knowledge of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , the pattern speeds of the primary and secondary bars . whereas a number of pattern speeds of large - scale bars have been measured ( see aguerri et al .",
    "2003 , hereafter adc03 and references therein ) , no such measurements in nested systems have been performed yet .",
    "the presence of nested bars with different pattern speeds has been inferred largely on the basis of their apparently random relative orientations ( buta & crocker 1993 ) . the possibility that @xmath5 is supported by the simulations of rautiainen et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , which showed that secondary bars can naturally form and survive for more than few rotation periods in pure stellar disks .",
    "the morphological characteristics of these systems are suggestive of stars in the secondary bars oscillating about the loop orbits studied by maciejewski & sparke ( 2000 ) for models with @xmath5 .",
    "however , simulations have also found other possibilities ( friedli & martinet 1993 ) , including cases where two stellar bars counter - rotate ( sellwood & merritt 1994 ; friedli 1996 ) .",
    "a model - independent method for measuring pattern speeds is the tremaine - weinberg method ( tremaine & weinberg 1984 , tw hereafter ) .",
    "this gives the pattern speed @xmath6 of a single bar as @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are luminosity - weighted average position and line - of - sight velocity measured parallel to the major axis of the galaxy disk , and @xmath10 is the disk inclination .",
    "long - slit spectra parallel to the disk major - axis can measure all the quantities needed by eqn .",
    "[ eq : tw1 ] provided that the galaxy is free of extinction . if several parallel slits at different offsets @xmath11 relative to the major axis are available for a galaxy , @xmath12 can be obtained as the slope of a plot of @xmath9 versus @xmath8 . in a double barred galaxy ( hereafter s2b ) , for a slit passing through both bars , eqn .",
    "[ eq : tw1 ] is modified to @xmath13 provided the two bars are rigidly rotating through each other , i.e. that the total surface density is described by @xmath14 .",
    "[ eq : tw2 ] is then a consequence of the linearity of the continuity equation .",
    "[ eq : tw2 ] can be solved for @xmath4 by first measuring @xmath3 as in eqn .",
    "[ eq : tw1 ] with slits which avoid the secondary bar , and then modeling to obtain @xmath15 from the observed @xmath16 .",
    "however , the two bars are not likely to rotate rigidly through each other when @xmath17 ( louis & gerhard 1988 ; maciejewski & sparke 2000 ; rautiainen et al .",
    "2002 ) , requiring additional modeling to obtain @xmath4 .",
    "nonetheless , when @xmath18 , eqn .",
    "[ eq : tw2 ] reduces to eqn .",
    "[ eq : tw1 ] and is satisfied exactly . thus testing whether @xmath19 does not require any assumptions .",
    "an ideal target for this purpose is the s2b ngc 2950 , which is a large ( @xmath20 [ de vaucouleurs et al . 1991 , hereafter rc3 ] ) and bright ( @xmath21 [ rc3 ] ) early - type barred galaxy .",
    "ngc 2950 is classified rsb0(r ) and its total absolute magnitude is @xmath22 ( rc3 ) adopting a distance of 23.3 mpc ( tully 1988 ) .",
    "the presence of a secondary stellar bar has been discussed extensively by wozniak et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , friedli et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , and erwin & sparke ( 2002 ) on the basis of ground - based and _ hubble space telescope _ images in both optical and near - infrared bandpasses .",
    "the secondary bar of ngc 2950 is typical of those in the samples of laine et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and of erwin & sparke ( 2002 ) .",
    "ngc 2950 meets all the requirements for the tw analysis : it has an intermediate inclination , both bars have intermediate position angles ( hereafter pa ) between the major and minor axes of the disk and no evidence of spirals , patchy dust or significant companions .",
    "the photometric observations of ngc 2950 were carried out at the 1-m jacobus kapteyn telescope on december 27 - 28 , 2000 .",
    "we took multiple exposures in the harris @xmath23 ( 4 @xmath24 1200 s ) , @xmath25 ( 3 @xmath24 480 s ) , and @xmath26 ( 18 @xmath24 150 s ) bandpasses using the site2 @xmath27 ccd .",
    "this camera has a scale of @xmath28 pixel@xmath29 , yielding an unvignetted field of view of @xmath30 .",
    "the seeing fwhm was @xmath31 .",
    "the data reduction has been carried out using standard iraf tasks as in debattista et al .",
    "( 2002 , hereafter dca02 ) .",
    "images were bias subtracted , flatfielded , cleaned of cosmic rays , and corrected of bad pixels . the sky - background level was removed by fitting a second - order polynomial to the regions free of sources .",
    "photometric calibration , using standard stars , included corrections for atmospheric and galactic extinction , and for color as in dca02 .",
    "the radial profiles of surface brightness , ellipticity and pa were obtained by fitting elliptical isophotes with the iraf task ellipse .",
    "we first fitted ellipses allowing their centers to vary to test for patchy dust obscuration .",
    "we found no evidence of a varying center within the errors of the fits , and similar pa and ellipticity profiles for all bandpasses .",
    "thus we concluded that there is little or uniform obscuration , as required for the tw method .",
    "the ellipse fits were then repeated with the ellipse center fixed ; the resulting photometric profiles are plotted in fig .",
    "1 . we interpreted the local maximum in ellipticity at @xmath32 and the corresponding twist and stationary value in pa as the photometric signatures of the presence of a misaligned secondary bar inside the primary bar .",
    "this is confirmed by the analysis of @xmath33 and @xmath34 color maps and unsharp mask of the original frames ; in all we find no evidence of other small - scale structures such as nuclear rings or disks , spiral arms , star - forming regions , dust lanes and/or dust patches , in agreement with previous results ( wozniak et al .",
    "1995 ; friedli et al .",
    "1996 ; erwin & sparke 2003 ) .",
    "in particular , the structural details unveiled by the unsharp mask of the wfpc2/f814w image of the nucleus of ngc 2950 ( erwin & sparke 2003 ) are unlike those typical of nuclear stellar disks ( pizzella et al .",
    "the pas of the primary ( @xmath35 ) and secondary bar ( @xmath36 ) were measured in the @xmath37band image at @xmath32 and @xmath38 , at the two peaks in the ellipticity profile ( fig .",
    "the lengths of the primary ( @xmath39 ) and secondary bar ( @xmath40 ) were measured using three independent methods based on fourier amplitudes ( aguerri et al .",
    "2000 ) , fourier and ellipse phases ( dca02 ) , and a decomposition of the surface brightness profiles ( prieto et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the inclination ( @xmath41 ) and pa of the disk ( @xmath42 ) were determined by averaging the values measured between @xmath43 and @xmath44 in the @xmath37band profile ( fig .",
    "the spectroscopic observations of ngc 2950 were carried out at the 3.6-m telescopio nazionale galileo on december 18 , 2001 ( run 1 ) , march 20 - 22 , 2002 ( run 2 ) , and march 9 - 11 , 2003 ( run 3 ) . the low resolution spectrograph mounted the hr - v grism no .  6 with 600 @xmath45 and the @xmath46 slit .",
    "the detector was the loral ccd with @xmath27 pixels of @xmath47 @xmath48m@xmath49 .",
    "the wavelength range from 4660 to 6820   was covered with a reciprocal dispersion of 1.054 pixel@xmath29 and a spatial scale of 0.275 arcsec pixel@xmath29 .",
    "we obtained 4 spectra with the slit along the disk major axis ( run 2 and 3 ) , and 11 offset spectra with the slit parallel to it ( @xmath50 in run 1 , @xmath51 in run 2 , and @xmath52 in run 3 , fig .",
    "the exposure times were @xmath53 min and @xmath54 min for the major - axis spectra obtained in run 2 and 3 , respectively , and 45 min for all the offset spectra .",
    "comparison lamp exposures before and/or after each object integration ensured accurate wavelength calibrations .",
    "spectra of g and k giant stars served as kinematical templates .",
    "the seeing fwhm was @xmath55 in run 1 , @xmath56 in run 2 , and @xmath57 in run 3 . using standard midas routines , all the spectra were bias subtracted , flatfield corrected , cleaned of cosmic rays , corrected for bad pixels and wavelength calibrated as in dca02 .",
    "the accuracy of the wavelength rebinning ( @xmath58 ) was checked by measuring wavelengths of the brightest night - sky emission lines .",
    "the instrumental resolution was 3.10   ( fwhm ) corresponding to @xmath59  at 5170  .",
    "the major - axis spectra obtained in the same run were co - added using the center of the stellar continuum as reference . in all the spectra the contribution of the sky was determined by interpolating along the outermost @xmath60 at the edges of the slit and then subtracted .",
    "to measure @xmath9 for each slit ( fig .",
    "3a ) , we first collapsed each two - dimensional spectrum along its spatial direction in the wavelength range between 5060 and 5490  , obtaining a one - dimensional spectrum .",
    "the value of @xmath9 was then derived by fitting the resulting spectrum with the convolution of the spectrum of the k1iii star hr 4699 and a gaussian line - of - sight velocity profile by means of the fourier correlation quotient method ( bender 1990 , hereafter fcq ) as done in adc03 .",
    "we estimated uncertainties by monte carlo simulations with photon , read - out and sky noise . to compute @xmath8 for each slit ( fig .",
    "3b ) , we extracted the luminosity profiles from the @xmath61band image along the position of the slit after convolving the image to the seeing of the spectrum .",
    "the @xmath61band profiles match very well the profiles obtained by collapsing the spectra along the wavelength direction , confirming that the slits were placed as intended .",
    "we used the @xmath61band profiles to compute @xmath8 because they are less noisy than those extracted from the spectra , particularly at large radii .",
    "we obtained @xmath3 from the values of @xmath8 and @xmath9 for the slits at @xmath62 and at @xmath63 ( the latter constrain only the zero point ) .",
    "since the slits at @xmath62 do not cross the secondary bar , we assume @xmath64 and @xmath65 for them and obtain @xmath66 with a straight line fit .",
    "this gives @xmath67  arcsec@xmath29 ( @xmath68  kpc@xmath29 , fig .",
    "3c ) the value of @xmath3 does not change within errors ( @xmath69  arcsec@xmath29 ) when we exclude the slits at @xmath70 , confirming that they are not much affected by the secondary bar ( fig .",
    "we used the fcq to measure the line - of - sight velocity and velocity dispersion profiles of the stellar component along the major axis ( fig .",
    "all the major - axis spectra were co - added after being convolved to the same seeing .",
    "we derived the circular velocity in the disk region , @xmath71 , after a standard correction for the asymmetric drift as in adc03 .",
    "thus the corotation radius of the primary bar is @xmath72 and the ratio @xmath73 of the corotation radius to the bar semimajor axis is @xmath74 ( error intervals on @xmath75 and @xmath76 are @xmath77 confidence level and were measured with monte carlo simulations as in adc03 ) .",
    "we conclude that , within the errors , the primary bar of ngc 2950 is consistent with all previous measurements of @xmath78 in sb0 galaxies ( adc03 ) , which gives us confidence in our assumption that the signals in the outer slits are generated by the primary bar only .",
    "the photometric and kinematic integrals measured with the innermost slits ( @xmath79 ) include a contribution from the secondary bar .",
    "in particular , @xmath80 for the slits at @xmath81 if we extrapolate @xmath82 from large @xmath83 .",
    "a straight line fit to @xmath8 and @xmath9 for the slits at @xmath79 has a slope ( @xmath84  arcsec@xmath29 , fig .",
    "3c ) which is different at better than @xmath85 confidence level from the slope ( @xmath86  arcsec@xmath29 , fig .",
    "3c ) of the straight line fit for the primary bar .",
    "this may be because @xmath87 ; however , to justify this conclusion , we needed to exclude the possibility of a systematic error due to pa errors , which @xmath8 and @xmath9 are quite sensitive to ( debattista 2003 ) .",
    "we tested whether the difference in the slopes of the straight line fits may be due to only pa errors when @xmath18 by building a model of a s2b galaxy with a single pattern speed from an @xmath88body simulation of a sb0 galaxy described in debattista ( 2003 ) .",
    "we rotated particles by 90@xmath89 , rescaled their phase space coordinates by a factor of 0.2 , and added them back to the original galaxy with various primary to secondary mass ratios to approximately match ngc 2950 . after projecting this system as in ngc 2950 , we proceeded to measure @xmath8 and @xmath9 for slits misaligned with the major axis .",
    "even when pa errors reached @xmath90 , we were not able to produce a system which approaches the behavior of our observations .",
    "in particular , we were not able to produce a system in which the slopes of the integrals plotted versus @xmath83 are larger for @xmath9 and smaller for @xmath8 in the region of the secondary bar than in the region of the main bar , as we observed in ngc 2950 ( fig . 3a , b ) .",
    "we therefore concluded that the signatures we observed could not be an artifact of any pa misalignments on two bars rotating with a single pattern speed .",
    "our results , therefore , lead us to conclude , directly and for the first time , that @xmath91 .",
    "however , estimating @xmath4 is model dependent ; we illustrate this by considering two extreme cases .",
    "first , we assumed that the secondary bar dominates at @xmath92 , and used eqn .",
    "[ eq : tw1 ] with @xmath6 replaced by @xmath4 to find @xmath93  arcsec@xmath29 ( fig .",
    "3c ) . in the second case , we rewrote eqn .",
    "[ eq : tw2 ] as @xmath94 the observed quantities are @xmath8 and @xmath9 , while @xmath3 was measured above . to obtain @xmath15 , first we derived the values of @xmath95 in the region of the nuclear bar by fitting a straight line to the @xmath8 values at @xmath96 ( fits extending to smaller @xmath83 give larger @xmath97 ) , and obtained @xmath98 .",
    "then plotting @xmath99 versus @xmath15 , we obtain @xmath100 as the slope of the best fitting line ; the result is @xmath101  arcsec@xmath29 , _ i.e. _ secondary bar counter - rotating relative to the primary .",
    "( note that the range from @xmath102 to @xmath103 passes smoothly through @xmath104 , _ i.e. _ a vertical line . )",
    "we showed that the primary bar in ngc 2950 is rapidly rotating .",
    "if this is the norm in s2b galaxies , then it guarantees that primary bars are efficient at funnelling gas down to the radius of influence of secondary bars . in fig .",
    "4 , we plot the lines of slope @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "the range of @xmath4 is large enough that it must include the case where @xmath107 .",
    "however , it also includes the case where @xmath108 , which hydrodynamical simulations find leads to inefficient gas transport ( maciejewski et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "we suggest two avenues for fruitful future work .",
    "first , since the two bars can not be in exact solid body rotation ( louis & gerhard 1988 ; maciejewski & sparke 2000 ; rautiainen et al .",
    "2002 ) , a more accurate measurement of @xmath4 will require careful modeling and comparison with simulations to account for such effects .",
    "second , it may be that secondary bars oscillate about an orientation perpendicular to the primary bar , possibly accounting for @xmath109",
    ". this can be tested by repeating our measurements on a sample of s2b galaxies .",
    "nonetheless , we can confidently conclude that in ngc 2950 the two bars must have different pattern speeds , with the secondary bar having a larger pattern speed ."
