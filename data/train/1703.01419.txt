    "[ figs1]b .",
    "we adopted the theory described by sackmann et al@xcite .",

    "we have considered the finite aperture effect and have assumed that the interfaces are flat , while multiple reflections are neglected .",
    "the dual - wavelength technique is used in combination with the ricm technique@xmath98 . by using dual - wavelength technique ,",
    "the reliability of the interferometry is greatly increased . in particular ,",
    "the turning point of the profile can be identified unambiguously . a sample plot of eq .",
    "[ eqs1 ] with two different wavelengths is shown in fig .",
    "[ figs1]c .",
    "intensity of the measured interference fringe is then converted into height profile by curve fitting , as described below .",
    "first , we extract intensity line profile ( i.e. , intensity along a fixed line ) at different time as shown in fig .",
    "[ figs2 ] .",
    "next , the center height of the air gap at different time is estimated .",
    "[ figs3]a shows the measured intensity at the center , i.e. the red line in fig .",
    "[ figs2 ] , and the corresponding curve fittings by eq .",
    "[ figs3]b shows the corresponding height evolution at center . finally , the height profile @xmath99 at one specific time is obtained . the center height obtained before",
    "is used as initial value for curve fitting .",
    "[ figs4]a shows the measured intensity at one instant , i.e. the green line in fig .",

    "[ figs4]b . by repeating the curve fitting at different time , the profiles in fig .",
    "[ figm2]d - f in the main text are reconstructed .",
    "as the adjacent bright and dark fringes represent a height difference of about @xmath100 , we can safely tell the contrast difference smaller than @xmath101 , which is about 30 nm .",
    "configuration of confocal imaging is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figs5 ] .",
    "the liquid film is stained by fluorescent dye .",
    "the focal plane is located at the air - liquid interface .",
    "magnitude of received fluorescence light depends on the overlapping volume between the fluorescent film and confocal optical section ( red dashed box in fig .",
    "[ figs5 ] ) . therefore ,",
    "when the liquid surface lowers the received fluorescence intensity would decrease , and when it rises , the intensity would increase , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figs6]a .",
    "we calibrate the aforementioned relation by measuring the brightness at difference focal planes with respect to the liquid surface ( i.e. acquiring a z - stack ) , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figs6]b .",
    "if the focal plane is located inside the fluorescence film , the received light intensity would increase as the overlapping volume increases . when the focal plane is located in the air , the intensity would decrease .",
    "we can see that the three scenarios in fig .",
    "[ figs6]b are equivalent to the respective scenarios in fig .",
    "[ figs6]a .",
    "the calibration data are approximated by a straight line in a defined dynamic range as shown in fig .",
    "[ figs7 ] .",
    "because in each surface profile measurement , the focal plane position is known in prior , we can easily convert the fluorescence data to surface profile by the slope of the calibration line .",
    "a typical example of calibration data is showed in fig .",
    "[ figs7 ] .",
    "we measure both the reflected laser light and fluorescence signal with a z - scan near the air - liquid interface .",
    "the reflection signal peaks at the air - liquid interface , where @xmath102 is defined . in this figure",
    ", @xmath103 refers to the liquid film and @xmath104 refers to the air .",
    "the fluorescence signal has a sigmoidal shape as expected",
    ". the intensity increases ( decreases ) as @xmath105 increases ( decreases ) , and eventually attains to a maximum ( minimum ) value .    for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "the calibration data are approximated by a straight line as indicated in fig .",
    "[ figs7 ] .",
    "we choose a straight line that intersects the curve at @xmath106 , and defined the dynamic range as -8 to 6 @xmath107 . by doing so",
    ", the linear approximation is accurate near the end and center of dynamic range , and slightly overshoots in elsewhere .",
    "the maximum intrinsic error arises from the linear approximation is 1 @xmath107 .",
    "however , taking into account of variations in sample preparation , the maximum error we have seen in data is 1.8 @xmath107 .",
    "when measuring the surface profile near the initial air - liquid interface , the focal plane is fixed at the initial interface .",
    "when measuring the surface profile deep inside the liquid film , the focal plane is fixed at 10 @xmath107 above the glass substrate .",
    "the center of the droplet is obtained from the reflection image .",
    "the radial profiles at different angles are averaged to reduce random noise ( the red shaded area in fig .",
    "[ figm2]g , i s insets in the main text ) .",
    "the averaged radial profile is further smoothened by a moving average filter .    within the dynamic range , the surface profile @xmath105 and the corresponding measured intensity @xmath108",

    "[ figs7 ] ) .    with this high - speed confocal profilometry technique , we can measure the liquid film deformation quantitatively , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figs15 ] upper panel by the black curve . to compare with the air gap thickness , we plot together the droplet interface as the red curve and the difference in between is the air gap .",
    "clearly the air gap thickness is much smaller than the liquid film deformation",
    ". please also note that the black curve is measured by confocal profilometry and the red curve is obtained by dual - wavelength interferometry : due to equipment limitation , they can only be measured in two separate experiments with identical conditions instead of in one single experiment .",
    "the lower panel magnifies this air gap in a zoomed - in scale .",
    "the laser scanning confocal microscopy ( leica tcs sp5 ) image is obtained through a 10x oil immersion lens ( na = 0.4 ) .",
    "pinhole diameter is 1 airy unit .",
    "thickness of the confocal optical section is 15.8 @xmath107 .",
    "wavelength of excitation laser is 514 nm .",
    "fluorescence dye ( nile red , sigma ) is dissolved in toluene ( sigma ) .",
    "the fluorescence dye solution is then mixed with silicon oil ( shin - etsu kf-96 ) with kinematic viscosity of 500 cst .",
    "the viscosity of the final mixture , measured by rheometer ( antor - paar mcr301 ) , is 91 @xmath118 1 mpas .",
    "the density of the final mixture is measured to be 870 @xmath118 10 kg / m@xmath119 . as a result",
    ", the kinematic viscosity of the final mixture is calculated to be 105 @xmath118 2 cst .",
    "surface tension of the final mixture , measured by pendant drop method , is 16.8 @xmath118 0.2 mn / m .",
    "for comparison , the kinematic viscosity and surface tension of the oil film without dye are 100 cst and 20.9 mn / m respectively .",
    "the excitation light is regarded as uniform in magnitude throughout the z - range of the confocal optical section .",
    "this claim is justified as the rayleigh range of the gaussian beam is calculated to be 20.4 @xmath107 , while the depth of confocal optical section is 15.8 @xmath107 . since the concentration of fluorescence dye is low , we also neglected the intensity drop caused by absorption and scattering of fluorescence dye , which depends on the scanning depth .",
    "the methodology of measuring the flow is described below . in order to simultaneously measure the air flow and boundary liquid flow ,",
    "we combine particle tracking velocimetry ( ptv ) with the interferometry described in appendix  [ secs1 ] .",
    "tracer particles are added to the droplet and liquid film , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figs8 ] . in the drop ,",
    "polystyrene particles with diameter 2.4 @xmath107 is used . in the liquid film , pmma particles with diameter 0.74 @xmath107",
    "the setup is based on the interferometer described in appendix  [ secs1 ] , with an extra collimated laser beam ( 532 nm ) added to illuminate the sample at an angle larger than the acceptance angle of the microscope objective .",
    "the particles in the droplet are observed through their scattering of laser light , i.e. through dark field imaging .",
    "moreover , with the bandpass filters in front of the cameras , the bright scattered light can only be received by one camera but not the other . on the other hand , the particles in liquid film scatter",
    "the reflected light from the air - liquid interface and appear black .",
    "therefore , as show in fig .",
    "[ figs8 ] , the tiny dark spots which appear in both panels are the tracer particles in liquid film , while the bright spots which only appear in the right panel are the tracer particles in droplet .",
    "this technique allows us to simultaneously measure the boundary flows in both liquid drop and liquid film .    in order to calculate the mean air flow velocity @xmath120",
    ", we need to obtain the air gap profile first .",
    "following the same procedure as in appendix  [ secs1 ] , we first extract the line intensity profile for different time , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figs9 ] .",
    "next , the air gap profile is obtained through curve fitting and plotted in fig .",
    "[ figs10 ] for six particular time , ( 291 , 331 , 658 , 738 , 1023 , 1183 ) ms , which represent three time intervals ( 291 to 331 ms , 658 to 738 ms and 1023 to 1183 ms ) , as indicated by the red lines in fig .  [ figs9 ] .",
    "the difference of the air gap profile yields the volume flow rate q. subsequently , the mean air flow velocity is calculated by @xmath121 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figm3]e in the main text .",
    "the tracer particles are also tracked in the three time intervals . in each time interval , the radial position of each particle at different time is fitted by a 2nd order polynomial , and then the velocity of each particles is obtained from the slope of the fitted polynomial , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figs11 ] .",
    "the dots are the velocity @xmath122 of a particle at radial position @xmath71 .",
    "the particles which are located at different depth would have different speed , while the particles which are closer to the boundary would be faster .",
    "therefore , to obtain the boundary velocity @xmath123 and @xmath124 , we select the fast particles ( green dots in fig .  [ figs11 ] ) and fit them with polynomials ( red lines in fig .",
    "[ figs11 ] ) .",
    "subsequently , the mean boundary velocity is calculated by @xmath125 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figm3]d , e in the main text .",
    "next , as we have already obtained @xmath126 and @xmath127 from experiment , the lubrication force is calculated by @xmath128 note that this equation only gives the lubrication force founded in the region @xmath129 .",
    "nevertheless , it is approximately equals to the total lubrication force experienced by the drop because @xmath130 , and the thickness of the air film @xmath7 sharply increases for @xmath131 .",
    "however , in calculating the lubrication force from experimental data , we find that the numerical integration of eq .  [ eqs4 ] rises rapidly near the end of interval ,",
    "this problem mainly comes from the lack of data near the edge , as well as the poor performance of ptv in rapidly varying region .",
    "first we have difficulty in tracking particles near the edge of the air film because of the dense interference fringes there . as shown in fig .",
    "[ figm3]c and fig .",
    "[ figs11 ] , there are very few data points near the edge of @xmath133 , and the results around the edge rely entirely on the extrapolation . however , because the air flow velocity @xmath126 sharply increases around the edge , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figm3]e , it is expected that the boundary liquid flow should also sharply vary as the result of the strong shear stress there .",
    "it is well known that extrapolation fails in sharp varying regions .",
    "in addition , even with the few data points near the edge , the ptv technique also works poorly in sharp varying regions and tends to give smoothed - out results .",
    "therefore , the mean boundary flow velocity from ptv , @xmath127 , is largely underestimated at the edge , which causes the aforementioned error in numerical integral .",
    "therefore , instead of integrating to @xmath132 , we compute it by integrating to @xmath134 , where the velocity variation is much smaller and the data are much more reliable . in fig .",
    "[ figs12 ] , we demonstrate the numerical integration of eq .",
    "[ eqs4 ] with different upper bound , i.e. , we are evaluating @xmath135 where the ratio @xmath136 varies from 0.5 to 1 .",
    "the values of integral sharply jump near @xmath137 , while the change is much reduced below @xmath138 . nevertheless , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figs12 ] , it is clear that without considering the boundary flow , the calculated force ( blue line ) will always be much larger than the droplet weight ( red dashed line ) .",
    "by contrast , when the effect of boundary flow is considered , the calculated force is much closer to the weight .",
    "to make sure that our discovery is valid in general , we test it with various liquids having different viscosities , surface tensions and impact velocities .",
    "the droplet lifetime versus skidding distance for different liquids is shown in fig .",
    "[ figs14 ] .",
    "apparently , there always exist two distinct states with long and short life times .",
    "the impact velocities are , from top to bottom , 0.32 , 0.13 , 0.13 , 0.36 , 0.10 m/s respectively .",
    "this result proves the general validity of our finding unambiguously .",
    "the bottom view of an oil drop skidding on a freshly cleaved mica is shown in fig .",
    "[ figs13 ] .",
    "the viscosity of the oil drop is 50 cst , impact velocity is 0.32 m / s .",
    "the droplet center moves from the red to the blue spot along the green arrow line , which is also the axis of symmetry . at large substrate tilting angle , there are two initial contacts locating symmetrically beside the green trajectory ( fig .",
    "[ figs13]a ) . as tilting angle decreases the two contacts converge into one ( fig .",
    "[ figs13]b ) .",

    "<S> when a droplet gently lands on an atomically - smooth substrate , it will most likely contact the underlying surface in about 0.1 second . </S>",
    "<S> however , theoretical estimation from fluid mechanics predicts a contact time of 10 to 100 seconds . </S>",
    "<S> what causes this large discrepancy and how does nature speed up contact by two orders of magnitude ? to probe this fundamental question , we prepare atomically - smooth substrates by either coating a liquid film on glass or using a freshly - cleaved mica surface , and visualize the droplet contact dynamics with 30 nm resolution . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , we discover two distinct speed - up approaches : ( 1 ) droplet skidding due to even minute perturbations breaks rotational symmetry and produces early contact at the thinnest gap location , and ( 2 ) for the unperturbed situation with rotational symmetry , a previously - unnoticed boundary flow around only 0.1mm / s expedites air drainage by over one order of magnitude . together </S>",
    "<S> these two mechanisms universally explain general contact phenomena on smooth substrates . </S>",
    "<S> the fundamental discoveries shed new light on the contact and drainage research .    </S>",
    "<S> when a droplet lands on a substrate , a thin layer of air will be trapped in between@xcite , which significantly affects the dynamics of the droplet@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> basic fluid mechanics tells us that it is very difficult to push fluid out of a narrow gap@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the drainage of air as a droplet gradually approaches a smooth substrate should become increasingly slow . </S>",
    "<S> if one assumes a nearly uniform air gap , lubrication theory predicts that a millimeter - sized droplet driven by its own weight should contact a perfectly - smooth substrate in 10 to 100 seconds . </S>",
    "<S> such a long floating time on a smooth substrate has never been observed ! </S>",
    "<S> instead , most contacts occur in about 0.1 second even on atomically - smooth surfaces ( here we exclude the extended floating time caused by drop oscillation@xcite , substrate motion@xcite , thermal gradient@xcite , surfactant@xcite , and evaporation@xcite ) . what exactly happens as a droplet approaches and contacts an atomically - smooth substrate ? </S>",
    "<S> how does nature speed up contact by two orders of magnitude ? </S>",
    "<S> this extremely common but fundamental issue lacks an explanation . besides fundamental importance , contact time also governs the efficiency of many applications , such as cooling of hot objects , protection against freezing rain , surface coating , inkjet printing , separation of oil and water in crude oil production , and the cleanup of a large - scale oil spill@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , understanding the efficient contact strategy from nature could make an important impact both fundamentally and practically .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we systematically study the gentle contact made by a droplet gently landing on an atomically - smooth substrate , and exclude the straightforward situations triggered by violent impacts or surface irregularities . to prepare atomically - smooth substrates , we either coat a thin film of silicone oil on a flat cover glass or use freshly - cleaved mica substrate , and cover broad conditions of both liquid and solid surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> the oil film has thickness @xmath0 , kinematic viscosity 100cst , and surface tension 20.9mn / m . </S>",
    "<S> we subsequently impact a silicone oil droplet with diameter @xmath1 onto these substrates . to achieve a slow and peaceful droplet approaching , we keep the impact velocity relatively low ( @xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the droplet viscosity is also kept relatively high ( 10 to 100cst ) to eliminate surface wave perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> we simultaneously record the side and bottom views of approaching and contact processes with two synchronized high - speed cameras , at the frame rate of @xmath3 frames per second . </S>",
    "<S> we use dual - wavelength interferometry@xcite at the wavelengths @xmath4 and @xmath5 to directly probe the air gap profile between drop and substrate , with a resolution of @xmath6 ( appendix  [ secs1 ] ) . note that such interference patterns only measure the relative distance between droplet and surface , leaving the deformation in the thin oil film unknown . to accurately detect this small deformation , we develop a high - speed confocal profilometry : by correlating liquid depth with fluorescence brightness , the oil film s surface profile can be characterized at micron resolution within 20ms ( appendix  [ secs2 ] ) . this technique may find broad applications for dynamic measurements on liquid surfaces .    </S>",
    "<S> first we theoretically estimate the contact time with lubrication theory . assuming that the air gap has a uniform thickness @xmath7 , the contact time calculation is based on the force balance equation @xcite : @xmath8 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath9 is the droplet weight , which is balanced by the lubrication force @xmath10 , with @xmath11 the radius of droplet s flattened bottom and @xmath12 the dynamic viscosity of air . because @xmath13 is a constant , we have @xmath14 which indicates a dramatic slow down of approaching velocity @xmath15 with the decrease of @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the contact time can further be calculated as : @xmath16 @xmath17 , with @xmath18 the initial gap thickness , and @xmath19 the final gap thickness at which the van der waals force takes effect . clearly @xmath20 is essentially determined by the small value of @xmath19 , which is typically 100 nm or less . </S>",
    "<S> plugging in typical values yields : @xmath21 to @xmath22 for a millimeter - sized droplet . a more comprehensive theory that accounts for the non - flat dimple shape </S>",
    "<S> gives a similar equation@xcite : @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are shape factors for initial and final shapes . </S>",
    "<S> the predicted lifetime is largely the same as the flat case because the final shape is quite flat , as we will show later that the height - to - radius ratio of the dimple is only @xmath26 to @xmath27 .    </S>",
    "<S> we then demonstrate our experimental findings , starting with the results on thin oil film . a typical example with @xmath28 and drop viscosity 50cst </S>",
    "<S> is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figm1]a ( also see movie 1 ) : the droplet rebounds once ( stage 1 ) and then oscillates multiple times for about @xmath29 ( stage 2 ) ; after consuming all the kinetic energy , it floats peacefully in air for about @xmath30 ( stage 3 ) before eventually contacts the underlying liquid film . </S>",
    "<S> the total interval of @xmath31 is defined as the lifetime and summarized in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figm1]f . </S>",
    "<S> apparently the total lifetime is two orders of magnitude shorter than the theoretical estimation .    </S>",
    "<S> more interestingly , when the same substrate is accurately leveled a completely different state appears , which has a lifetime ten times longer ! as illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figm1]b ( also see movie 1 ) , within the initial @xmath32 the drop behaves almost identically with the previous example while subsequently it exhibits a much longer stable stage ( i.e. , stage 3 ) , as demonstrated in fig .  [ figm1]g . for </S>",
    "<S> this leveled situation there must exist a distinct contact mechanism which increases the lifetime significantly . note that even this long lifetime ( @xmath33 ) is still less than theoretical estimation by over one order of magnitude .    </S>",
    "<S> we carefully compare the two distinct states with their bottom views in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figm1]d and fig .  [ figm1]e ( also see movie 2 and movie 3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the interference patterns reveal their air gap evolutions throughout the contact process . on the inclined surface in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figm1]d the droplet skids a long distance from the red to the blue spot with an asymmetric late stage ; while in the leveled situation of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figm1]e it skids much shorter and a long - time symmetric late stage emerges . to compare their entire evolutions </S>",
    "<S> , we plot the line brightness along the green trajectory ( i.e. , the axis of symmetry ) with respect to time in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figm1]f and fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figm1]g , which reveals a remarkably - long stable stage on the leveled substrate .    to explore different contact situations </S>",
    "<S> , we systematically vary the substrate tilt angle @xmath34 , and plot the corresponding lifetime versus skidding distance as solid symbols in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figm1]h . </S>",
    "<S> only one sharp transition occurs around @xmath35 , suggesting exactly two contact states on a thin - film - coated substrate . </S>",
    "<S> however , when identical experiments are performed on a dry mica surface , only the short lifetimes appear , as shown by the open symbols . </S>",
    "<S> summarizing all data points , we find two contact states on smooth substrates : one with short lifetime universally occurs on both wet and dry surfaces , and the other with long lifetime appears only on leveled wet substrate . </S>",
    "<S> the same result reproducibly appears for various liquids with different viscosities , surface tensions and impact velocities , demonstrating its universal validity ( see fig .  [ figs14 ] in appendix  [ secsliq ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> using dual - wavelength interferometry , we illustrate these two contact states by directly measuring the air gap profile . </S>",
    "<S> again we start with the oil - coated substrate first . </S>",
    "<S> three typical experiments with large , small and zero tilt angles are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figm2]a - c respectively : the first two have short lifetimes and the third one has long lifetime . </S>",
    "<S> for the first two tilted situations , skidding under gravity breaks the rotational symmetry but the mirror symmetry with respect to drop trajectory is still preserved . for large @xmath34 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figm2]a , the skidding distance is long with two contact points locating symmetrically beside the trajectory . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath36 decreases in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figm2]b , the skidding distance reduces and the two contacts converge into one . </S>",
    "<S> more interestingly , in both panels the initial contact always occurs at the leading side of the moving droplet , indicating a thinner air gap at the front .    to verify it , </S>",
    "<S> we plot the corresponding gap profiles along the green trajectory in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figm2]d and fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figm2]e . </S>",
    "<S> as expected , skidding makes the gap front slightly lower than the back by about @xmath37 , which however produces large asymmetry just before contact : the back opening ( @xmath38 ) is ten times thicker than the thinnest location ( @xmath39 ) at the front . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , while the overall air volume is still large , the thinnest location at front already reaches the critical thickness of @xmath40 for contact . </S>",
    "<S> thus the short lifetime originates from the gap asymmetry which causes early contact at the thinnest spot , instead of draining most air out of gap .    </S>",
    "<S> moreover , identical patterns are also observed on the dry mica surface ( appendix  [ secsmica ] , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figs13 ] ) , proving that same mechanism takes place universally on both wet and dry surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> note that symmetry breaking is very sensitive to external perturbation : any tilting above @xmath41 can induce it on wet surface , and it always occurs on dry mica surface no matter how well it is leveled . </S>",
    "<S> although this mechanism looks straightforward , surprisingly it has been overlooked for a long time , with rotational symmetry typically assumed in most previous studies @xcite .    in sharp contrast to above short - lifetime situation , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figm2]f shows a symmetric air gap for long lifetime , with no distinction between front and back . </S>",
    "<S> for such a gap with rotational symmetry , contact can not occur until the entire perimeter reaches the critical thickness around 50 nm . therefore preserving rotational symmetry </S>",
    "<S> is the underlying reason for long lifetime , with an eventual contact taking place randomly on the perimeter as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figm2]c .    however , why long lifetime _ </S>",
    "<S> only _ occurs on wet substrate but never on dry mica surface ? to address this question , we measure the deformation of the thin oil film with our high - speed confocal profilometry ( appendix  [ secs2 ] ) . for the short - lifetime state in fig .  [ figm2]g , the droplet skids along the surface and makes a shallow indentation less than @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , for the long - lifetime situation the droplet stays at original location and keeps sinking down , producing a much deeper indentation of @xmath43 ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figm2]h , i ) . </S>",
    "<S> this deep indentation behaves as a trap and protects the droplet from external perturbations , which preserves rotational symmetry and leads to long lifetime . to make a direct comparison between the air gap and the liquid film deformation , we plot them together in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figs15 ] in appendix a. clearly the air gap thickness is much smaller than the liquid film deformation . on a dry solid surface , however </S>",
    "<S> , indentation is negligible and symmetry breaking can always be induced by small perturbations , such as gravity , air flow , and other environmental noises .    </S>",
    "<S> even the long lifetime ( @xmath44s ) is too short to match the theoretical estimation ( @xmath45s to @xmath46s ) . without asymmetry , </S>",
    "<S> how does nature speed up contact in this situation ? </S>",
    "<S> careful inspection provides a possible solution : the previous model adopts a parabolic velocity profile with zero boundary velocity @xcite , as shown by the left profile of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figm3]a . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the boundary velocity is typically neglected when the liquid viscosity is much higher than air ( i.e. , at the liquid film interface : @xmath47 , and at the droplet interface @xmath48 @xcite , with @xmath49 the liquid film thickness and @xmath50 the dynamic viscosity ratio between liquid and air ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , this assumption may break down as the gap thickness approaches as thin as @xmath51 ( i.e. , @xmath52 ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we adopt a more general velocity profile by adding boundary velocities to the parabola , as demonstrated by the right profile in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figm3]a . </S>",
    "<S> the extra boundary component may speed up air drainage , reduce lifetime , and solve the discrepancy . </S>",
    "<S> we write this generalized drainage velocity in the cylindrical coordinate as @xcite : @xmath53 with @xmath54 the parabolic poiseuille flow , and @xmath55 $ ] the couette flow induced from boundary . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath56 is the air pressure , and @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the top and bottom boundary velocities respectively ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> figm3]a ) . </S>",
    "<S> clearly @xmath59 is generated by the pressure gradient with parabolic z - dependence , while @xmath60 comes from the boundary velocities @xmath57 and @xmath58 with linear z - dependence .    to verify our model , we use tracer particles to visualize boundary flows in both the drop and the oil film , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figm3]b and fig .  [ figm3]c ( also see movie 4 and movie 5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> these images and movies unambiguously prove the existence of outward boundary velocities @xmath61 and @xmath62 . to quantitatively compare our model with experiment </S>",
    "<S> , we average eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eqm1 ] over z - coordinate to obtain an experimentally measurable expression : @xmath63 with @xmath64 describing the total leakage , @xmath65 ^ 2}{12\\eta_a}\\frac{\\partial p(r , t)}{\\partial r}$ ] the poiseuille component and @xmath66 the couette component .    </S>",
    "<S> we first measure the total leakage @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> because the pressure from droplet is @xmath68 , air is only compressed by a factor of @xmath69 and can be safely assumed as incompressible . </S>",
    "<S> thus by measuring the air gap evolution @xmath70 , we get the air volume within radius @xmath71 , @xmath72 , the volume flow rate @xmath73 , and the average total leakage @xmath74 .    </S>",
    "<S> we then measure the couette component @xmath75 with particle tracking ( appendix  [ secs3 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> one typical result at a particular moment @xmath76 is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figm3]d : solid and open symbols represent tracer particle velocities in droplet and liquid film . </S>",
    "<S> the upper bounds of solid and open symbols are taken as @xmath61 ( dotted line ) and @xmath62 ( dashed curve ) respectively , because tracer particles reach maximum velocities at the boundary ( appendix  [ secs3 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently we obtain @xmath75 as indicated by the dash - dotted curve in the middle .    </S>",
    "<S> finally we compare @xmath77 and @xmath78 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figm3]e : clearly @xmath78 takes a major fraction of @xmath77 for the entire stable stage , indicating that the boundary component @xmath78 is more important than the pressure - generated component @xmath79 for the majority of time . although both @xmath77 and @xmath78 decrease with time , the importance of @xmath78 inside @xmath77 grows with time and becomes completely dominant right before contact . </S>",
    "<S> the underlying physics is the following : the component @xmath80 diminishes rapidly with thickness , and thus @xmath78 grows progressively important and completely dominates the total drainage @xmath77 immediately before contact .    after including the boundary velocity component @xmath78 </S>",
    "<S> , we once again check the basic force balance between the lubrication force @xmath81 and the droplet weight @xmath82 . by integrating pressure ( obtained from @xmath83 ) over the droplet bottom area @xmath84 ( appendix  [ secs4 ] ) , we obtain @xmath85 values as plotted by the red symbols in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figm3]f . </S>",
    "<S> they agree excellently with the droplet weight indicated by the solid line . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , the previous model with the assumption of @xmath86 gives the black symbols , which overshoots by more than one order of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> this result quantitatively illustrates the importance of boundary velocity and solves the contact time discrepancy for the symmetric drainage situation with long lifetime .    to conclude </S>",
    "<S> , we have solved the fundamental question of why a droplet can contact a smooth surface so rapidly . </S>",
    "<S> in general the external perturbations will break rotational symmetry and cause a slight height difference ( @xmath38 ) in air gap , which produces significant gap asymmetry near the contact moment and leads to early contact at the thinnest spot . </S>",
    "<S> it typically speeds up contact by two orders of magnitude . for the symmetric situation , however </S>",
    "<S> , a small boundary flow around @xmath87 will expedite drainage by one order of magnitude . due to the small magnitude </S>",
    "<S> , both the height difference and the boundary flow have been overlooked by previous research , in which the rotational symmetry and fixed boundary condition are typically assumed . </S>",
    "<S> however we discover that these tiny quantities are crucially important to determine the contact time of actual contacts .    </S>",
