    "to date , we have yet to understand the origin of the large density of very faint , blue field galaxies despite enormous observational progress ( e.g. , @xcite ) . deep images to @xmath8 or fainter with the refurbished hubble space telescope",
    "( hst ) show a predominance of late - type or unusual galaxy morphologies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , as well as small sizes that suggest a large fraction of low - luminosity dwarf galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "the redshifts of individual galaxies observed with hst remain largely unknown .",
    "existing redshift samples include 17 galaxies to @xmath9 from forbes ( 1996 ) , 32 to @xmath10 from schade ( 1995 ) , and 34 to @xmath11 ( roughly @xmath12 ) from cowie ( 1995 ) but do not yet probe fainter than @xmath13 .",
    "the redshift distribution is , however , well established statistically to @xmath10 from the cfrs ( lilly 1995b ) .",
    "redshifts are crucial for determining the intrinsic properties of galaxies visible in deep hst images , and good spectra can also yield rotation velocities , velocity dispersions , stellar population age indices , and metallicities .",
    "a program to obtain deep spectra using the 10-m keck telescope is now underway as a new initiative called the deep extragalactic evolutionary probe , or deep ( @xcite ) .",
    "this paper reports on initial results of a new deep survey that utilizes redshifts from the keck telescope , supplemented by photometry , colors , and morphologies from images taken by groth ( 1996 ) with the refurbished hst .",
    "the target sample contains 230 galaxies , but poor weather permitted only 18% to be observed during the run .",
    "the acquired redshift sample of 35 galaxies is , however , generally representative of the target sample .",
    "the magnitudes are so faint ( median @xmath14 ; median @xmath15 ) and the redshifts so high ( median @xmath16 ) , that the current data provide a first glimpse of the nature of faint , distant field galaxies of @xmath17 luminosities at an epoch of roughly half the hubble age . , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , i.e. @xmath20 . at redshift @xmath21 ,",
    "@xmath22 for a blue ( @xmath23 ) galaxy of @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) , the lookback time is about 6.5 gyr for a hubble age of 13 gyr , and 1 arcsec corresponds to 7 kpc . ]",
    "the hst data are from two surveys which we dub the `` survey strip '' taken under hst program gto 5090 ( e. groth as p.i . ) and the `` deep field , '' under gto 5109 ( j. westphal as p.i . ) .",
    "the survey strip consists of 28 overlapping subfields taken with the hst wide field and planetary camera ( wfpc2 ) and forms a `` chevron strip '' oriented ne to sw at roughly 1417 + 52 at galactic latitude @xmath26 .",
    "each of 27 subfields has exposures of 2800s in the broad @xmath27 filter ( f606w ) and 4400s in the broad @xmath28 filter ( f814w ) .",
    "the 28th field is the deep field ( j2000 1417.5 + 52.5 ) , with total exposures of 24400s in @xmath27 and 25200s in @xmath28 .",
    "astrometry and photometry of the entire survey strip has been completed , with full details of the survey , data reductions , and calibrations described by groth ( 1996 ) . for the purposes of this paper , magnitudes are `` total , '' while ( @xmath29 ) colors are based on 1 arcsec diameter apertures .",
    "the morphologies were visually classified into three simple groups : `` o '' group for objects that appear round or elliptical , centrally concentrated , smooth , and _ largely _ symmetrical with at most a very weak disk ; `` s '' group for objects that have both a bulge and an apparent disk and/or spiral arms ; and `` * '' group for galaxies that are likely to have on - going star formation with late - type , irregular , asymmetrical , multi - component , or peculiar forms .",
    "these group designations were chosen to match the symbols used in the figures .",
    "note that at redshifts @xmath16 , the @xmath28 band corresponds to rest - frame @xmath30 .",
    "images of the entire spectroscopic sample are shown in figures  [ red][misc ] , along with magnitudes , colors , morphological group , redshifts ( when known ) , and resulting absolute rest - frame @xmath30 magnitudes and rest - frame @xmath31 colors .",
    "table 1 provides j2000 positions and corresponding identifications from cfrs .    except for two bright ( @xmath32 ) galaxies taken through clouds with a 1.0 arcsec - wide long slit ,",
    "the other 39 galaxy targets and several setup stars were observed through two focal - plane masks cut with multiple slitlets .",
    "this multislit mode allows simultaneous exposure of @xmath33 or more targets with the low resolution imaging spectrograph ( lris ; see @xcite ) .",
    "the detector was a tektronix 2048@xmath342048 px ccd ( 24 @xmath35 or 0.215 arcsec px@xmath36 ) . with a slitwidth of 1.23 arcsecs ,",
    "a 600 l / mm grating yielded 1.26   px@xmath36 and an instrumental resolution of @xmath37   fwhm , i.e. , r @xmath38 2000 .",
    "the spectral range was about 6500    9100  , depending on the exact position of the target on the mask .",
    "this spectral range was chosen to detect the strongest emission lines in faint galaxies : h@xmath39 @xmath406563 at @xmath41 , h@xmath42 @xmath404861 and [ oiii ] @xmath405007 at @xmath43 , and [ oii ] @xmath403727 at @xmath44",
    ". the slitlets were aligned along the 7 arcmin long axis of the lris field , which in turn was aligned with the ne - sw orientation of the survey strip . of the four allotted nights ,",
    "only part of one night , ut 1 may 1995 , was clear and calm enough to open the dome , during which we acquired 4@xmath341800s exposures through one mask and 3@xmath341800s through another at the same position ( but with a different selection of galaxies ) .",
    "seeing was variable but was estimated to be about 08 to 12 fwhm during most of the exposures .",
    "the spectroscopic reduction included the usual corrections for bias , dark , flats , and cosmic rays as well as sky - line wavelength calibrations and background sky subtraction .",
    "we chose to place the targets at two positions along the slit , separated by 3 arcsecs , during different exposures .",
    "this `` dither '' allowed corrections for the 1 - 2% fringing of the night sky seen at wavelengths greater than @xmath38 7200 by subtraction of the dithered images taken at each position .",
    "this method increases random sky noise by a factor of  @xmath45{2}$ ] .",
    "the 230 galaxies chosen for spectroscopy , of which only 38 were actually observed with keck , do not constitute a totally random , magnitude - limited sample .",
    "rather , they were chosen to span the full distribution of colors and diverse visual morphologies of the galaxies in the whole survey strip .",
    "the field of our keck observations included the deep field , where faint galaxies ( @xmath46 ) were selected , and four adjacent wfpc2 subfields , where brighter targets ( @xmath47 ) were selected ( see figure  4 ) .",
    "as indicated in table 1 , a few special targets were chosen because of their unusual morphology ( e.g. , a promising quadruple - lens candidate ) ; their detection in the radio ; or their elongation with position angles promising for rotation curve measures ( vogt 1996 ) . in addition , redshifts were measured for four emission - line objects serendipitously lying within slitlets of intended targets .",
    "the faintest objects were observed through both masks . within small number statistics and as shown in figure  4 , the present keck sample has a color distribution at each magnitude roughly similar to the entire hst sample , except that ten galaxies ( rather than the expected seven ) were observed with very red colors ( @xmath48 ) and magnitudes @xmath49 .",
    "the redshift identifications were made by first visually inspecting the two - dimensional sky - subtracted images for any strong emission lines .",
    "the extracted one - dimensional spectra were then examined for absorption lines when the continuum was bright enough , generally for galaxies with @xmath50 , or weaker emission features . in total",
    ", we have extracted 24 redshifts for our original targets , four redshifts for objects fortuitously lying in a slitlet , and two redshifts from longslit observations of @xmath32 galaxies .",
    "the reliability of these redshifts range from high ( i.e. , secure redshifts ) to moderately high ( i.e. , probable redshifts ) . in several galaxies ,",
    "only one emission line was detected , but its identification as [ oii ] @xmath403727 was considered to be secure if we resolved the doublet or found a rising continuum to the red .",
    "five more objects have apparent emission or absorption features , but highly uncertain redshifts ; six targets fainter than @xmath51 have yet to yield any reliable spectral features for redshift determination .",
    "figure 5 shows examples of our keck spectra that span a range of redshift reliability .",
    "an independent check of our coordinates , photometry , and redshifts can be made from the eight galaxies in common with cfrs ( see table 1 and lilly 1995a ) and shows good agreement .",
    "we find a mean positional offset between the cfrs and our coordinates of @xmath52 , which is certainly close enough to make secure identifications . the mean @xmath28 band difference ( cfrs @xmath53 )",
    "is expected to be @xmath54 mag , while we find 0.56 @xmath55 0.33 ; dropping the two very bright , large galaxies , 074 - 2237 and 074 - 2262 , whose photometry might be difficult , yields a significantly smaller standard deviation ( @xmath55 0.18 ) and a mean within expectations ( 0.46 mag ) .",
    "finally , the redshifts of all eight cfrs galaxies in common with our keck sample agree well individually , but have slightly lower values than ours by a mean difference of @xmath56 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the keck redshift survey is 100% complete for targeted objects to @xmath51 ( 24 galaxies ) and 85% complete for the whole sample to @xmath57 .",
    "we reached beyond @xmath58 only for targets with strong emission lines ; the redshifts of several of these faint galaxies remain highly uncertain ( see table 1 ) .",
    "figure  6b shows the magnitude versus redshift distribution of the sample , plus the 17 galaxies from forbes ( 1996 ) .",
    "the most striking aspect of the data is the high fraction of redshifts @xmath59 .",
    "the resultant median of the observed redshifts is 0.81 . due to the relatively high level of completeness",
    ", the median value of the whole sample must lie in the range 0.81 to 1.00 , even if the undetermined redshifts are entirely at @xmath60 or at @xmath61 , or if the number of galaxies at the @xmath62 and 1.00 peaks are halved to account for small - scale clustering effects .    for comparison ,",
    "the cfrs sample ( @xcite ) has nearly 600 redshifts to @xmath63 , a median redshift of @xmath64 , an overall completeness of 85% , and completeness for @xmath65 of 74% .",
    "our sample is 100% complete to these limits and includes 25 redshifts beyond @xmath16 , more than the 4 such redshifts in the @xmath66 survey of glazebrook ( 1995a ) , the 13 in the @xmath67 survey of songaila ( 1994 ) , or the 5 in the @xmath68 targets of schade ( 1995 ) , but still far short of the @xmath69 in the cfrs .",
    "figure  7 plots ( @xmath29 ) color versus redshift for the keck sample with morphological information encoded within the symbol shapes .",
    "the curves provide a guide to the intrinsic colors of local galaxies and to the expected colors for single instantaneous starbursts originating at redshifts @xmath70 or @xmath71 .",
    "one striking aspect of this figure is how well the galaxies fall within the bounds seen in local galaxies , a result already found in the larger cfrs sample ( crampton 1995 ) .",
    "we find no evidence for a significant new population of unusually blue or unusually red galaxies .",
    "other straightforward results are that very red _ field _ galaxies do exist at high redshifts @xmath72 and that such galaxies have colors comparable to those found for local ellipticals ; therefore , their most recent major star - formation event presumably occurred at redshifts @xmath73 .",
    "moreover , the intrinsically reddest galaxies are not necessarily purely elliptical in morphology ; bulges and at least one dust - reddened , inclined spiral are seen .",
    "although low - clustering amplitudes have been measured in angular correlation studies ( e.g. , efstathiou 1991 ) , the intrinsically blue galaxies here do partake in the strong clustering seen at redshifts @xmath16 and @xmath74 .",
    "they may thus contribute to the strong angular clustering observed among the bluest galaxies by landy ( 1996 ) .",
    "the diverse morphologies of these high - redshift , clustered galaxies are easily seen in figures  1 and 2 .",
    "what cosmological implications can we extract from this faint sample of galaxies ? given the relatively small numbers , median redshifts are a good starting point for comparison to theory .",
    "first , the 100% complete sample of 9 galaxies with @xmath75 has a median redshift of @xmath62 , with a possible range from 0.37 to 1.00 at the 95% confidence level ; this is consistent with the median of 0.56 for cfrs based on a much larger sample .",
    "second , the @xmath76 sample with 24 galaxies has the same median of 0.81 but a tighter range of @xmath1 to 1.00 at the 95% confidence level .",
    "this high median is an important finding , since songaila ( 1994 ) found the median to remain at @xmath77 for galaxies fainter than @xmath78 ( roughly @xmath79 ) , as predicted by some merger models .",
    "for example , the `` maximal merger model '' of carlberg ( 1996 ) , which matches observations to @xmath80 , predicts that the median will stabilize at @xmath2 from @xmath81 all the way to @xmath82 , contrary to what we find in this sample at @xmath83 .",
    "the high median is , however , consistent with at least two other scenarios .",
    "first , with no further evolution than that already found in the cfrs survey , lilly ( 1995c ) predict that the median should continue to rise to @xmath84 for @xmath85 and to @xmath86 for @xmath87 .",
    "second , the predictions of models that do include mild luminosity evolution but no mergers , such as those of gronwall & koo ( 1995 ) , are virtually identical to those predicted by cfrs . at this time",
    ", we have no basis to exclude other models , such as those of cole ( 1994 ) , that analytically track various other physical processes such as supernova gas removal and star - formation , as well as merging of dark matter halos .",
    "the width of the distribution is also a potentially powerful discriminant .",
    "for example , the fiducial bursting dwarf model of babul & ferguson ( 1996 ) predicts a narrow redshift distribution peaked at @xmath88 for a @xmath89 redshift sample , with a cutoff in numbers at @xmath70 , chosen by them by fiat , when dwarfs first form .",
    "our data , with the bulk of the redshifts @xmath90 , lend some support for this picture . on the other hand ,",
    "several very blue galaxies are seen beyond @xmath70 , while those very near @xmath70 span a wide range of colors rather than being dominated by the very blue colors expected from an ongoing burst of star formation ( see figure 7 ) .",
    "moreover , the diverse morphologies and diffuseness of many of the blue galaxies , discussed below , may be difficult to explain .",
    "more faint redshifts with stricter selection criteria will be needed to provide more definitive tests of the bursting model .",
    "redshifts also probe clustering .",
    "cfrs already paved the way with the discovery of 12 redshifts in a 0.016 redshift interval , indicating a five to ten times overdensity of galaxies at @xmath91 ( le fvre 1994 ) .",
    "this possible supercluster structure was found in a 10x10 field that coincidentally overlaps our field . as seen in figure  6a",
    ", we find a density enhancement at @xmath92 containing five galaxies , which may be the same structure , plus another stronger one at @xmath93 with ten galaxies ( standard deviations are measured within @xmath94 of the peak ) .",
    "since we see no visual evidence for any rich cluster of galaxies in our field and the velocity dispersion is relatively low ( @xmath95  ) , the @xmath62 enhancement is probably a rich group .",
    "we close with some discussion and speculations based on hst morphologies and colors .",
    "figure  1 shows 9 galaxies with very red colors within their central one arcsec diameters .",
    "the galaxies in the top two rows of figure  1 appear morphologically to be elliptical or s0 galaxies ( though phillips find that 073 - 2675 is better fit with an exponential , rather than an @xmath96 profile ) .",
    "combined with very red colors , these galaxies indicate the presence of luminous ellipticals in the field that are already quite old by @xmath97 .",
    "this presumes that the red colors are not due to dust extinction , which remains to be determined .",
    "based on the @xmath98 curve in figure  7 , the last significant star formation event presumably occurred at redshifts @xmath99 or greater .",
    "such very red galaxies have also been found among distant radio galaxies ( e.g. , mccarthy 1993 ) and cluster galaxies ( e.g. , dickinson 1996 ) .    yet several of these galaxies are not quite `` normal . ''",
    "galaxy 093 - 2470 appears to have four very blue compact objects imbedded in a symmetrical pattern within its halo , a pattern proposed to form a `` quad - lens '' system ( ratnatunga 1995 , broadhurst 1996 , crampton 1996 ) .",
    "although the `` maximal merger model '' of carlberg ( 1996 ) appears to be invalidated by the new redshifts , we do find some evidence for minor mergers among several of these distant red galaxies . except for 073 - 2675 ,",
    "the remaining five galaxies in the first two rows of figure  1 show close projected neighbors or tidal and merger `` tails , '' and some of this neighboring material is blue .",
    "perhaps we are watching the infall of dwarf galaxies , some possibly quite gas - rich , if the blue colors are due to active star formation .",
    "the implication would be that elliptical galaxies form early and yet can be built up by minor mergers over a much longer time period .",
    "this scenario could reconcile the apparent lack of luminosity or density evolution among red galaxies seen in the cfrs ( lilly 1995c ) or the mg ii absorber sample ( steidel , dickinson , & persson 1994 ) with the presence of well - formed , red field galaxies at an early epoch .",
    "the last row of figure  1 presents three very red _ disk _ galaxies . with a peak - to - peak rotation curve velocity of @xmath38600  ( vogt 1996 ) , the conspicuous edge - on system ( 104 - 4024 ) demonstrates that some massive",
    ", thin - disk , dusty systems already exist at @xmath16 , roughly half a hubble age ago .",
    "this single object , evidently similar to our milky way , supports what we believe to be the early formation of our own old disk .",
    "there are hints of very faint blue satellites that might eventually settle into this distant spiral , an evolutionary path that has also been proposed for the milky way ( majewski 1993 ) .",
    "another disk - like system , 094 - 2210 , shows a very red , bulge - like core surrounded by numerous blue `` blobs '' or arms .",
    "if this galaxy is a disk or proto - disk system with little dust extinction , it suggests that some bulges are already quite old by @xmath7 , with their most recent star formation occurring perhaps at @xmath73 ( see figure  7 ) .",
    "object 103 - 2074 appears to be another disky system of early type ( s0 or sa ) with a very red bulge .",
    "figure  2 shows two sets of galaxies : the bluer , high - redshift galaxies and those without redshifts .",
    "those with measured redshifts @xmath100 are organized into 7 rows divided into morphological groups .",
    "we argue that all six of the galaxies without redshifts are likely to be at high redshifts @xmath101 .",
    "since blue galaxies normally have strong emission lines of [ oii ] @xmath40 3727 that should be detectable to @xmath102 ( or especially of h@xmath39 for redshifts lower than @xmath103 ) , we argue that the five blue galaxies in our keck sample without measured redshifts are probably at higher redshifts . in support of this conjecture , we note that the bluest galaxy in our entire keck sample ( source 084 - 1720 ) has two definite absorption lines separated by @xmath3835  and appearing around 6770  ( see figure 5 ) ; we tentatively identify this doublet as fe ii @xmath402587 and @xmath402600 that would yield a redshift of @xmath104 .",
    "one relatively bright , very red galaxy ( source 083 - 3138 ) also has no redshift , but based on the similarity of its color to the galaxies in figure 1 with redshifts ( see figure 7 ) , we infer that it is likely to be at high redshift .",
    "the targets without redshifts are all presented in the last two rows of figure  2 .",
    "the large diversity of morphologies displayed in figure  2 is striking , ranging from compact galaxies shown in the first and second rows , normal disk - like systems in the third and fourth rows , to irregular , late - type systems with multiple blue star - formation sites in the fifth and sixth rows .",
    "this last group could be related to a proposed new class of `` blue - nucleated '' galaxies ( schade 1995 ) .",
    "the seventh row shows galaxies that are perhaps more elongated versions of the above galaxies or that may belong to the new class of `` chain '' galaxies defined by cowie ( 1995 ) .",
    "comparably complex and diverse morphologies can , however , be found even among local very blue galaxies such as clumpy irregulars , markarian galaxies , extragalactic hii regions , merging galaxies , or other peculiar classes ( c.f .",
    "images of hii galaxies presented by melnick 1987 ) .",
    "these various local blue systems often show similar , multiple concentrations of intense star formation .",
    "the new keck redshifts and hst morphologies combine to counter the view that low redshift , very blue , low luminosity dwarf galaxies dominate the late - type , peculiar systems detected in deep hst images ( e.g. , driver 1995 ) .",
    "instead , most of the keck galaxies with these morphologies are at high redshifts and are thus relatively luminous , though typically less luminous than @xmath105 . the apparent sizes of many of these distant galaxies are @xmath106 arcsec , however , which imply metric sizes of several kiloparsecs , quite typical of local dwarf galaxies .",
    "after corrections for cosmological dimming ( about 2.3 magnitudes at @xmath7 ) and k - corrections ( from @xmath38 0 mag for very blue galaxies to over 4 mag for very red galaxies at @xmath7 ) , the resultant restframe @xmath30 band surface brightnesses are higher than those of most local spirals and star - forming irregulars ( schade 1995 , phillips 1996 ) .",
    "thus , the faint blue galaxies are not explained by a class of very low surface brightness galaxies that have been missed by local surveys ( mcgaugh 1994 ) .",
    "whether the high redshift galaxies are indeed low - mass systems ( which may or may not have any direct relationship to local dwarfs ) or are the luminous tips of more massive systems will be decided by results of kinematic surveys .",
    "so far , only small samples of very blue , distant , field galaxies have been observed , many quite compact and as distant as @xmath107 , and these have yielded some luminous galaxies with very - low , emission - line velocity widths of @xmath108  ( koo 1995 , colless 1995 , guzmn 1996 , forbes 1996 ) .",
    "we conclude from the present sample that no single physical process ( e.g. , mergers or bursting dwarfs ) dominates the evolution of faint galaxies at redshifts @xmath7 .",
    "we find a diversity of morphologies from normal to peculiar , with no firm evidence for entirely new classes of galaxies for which local counterparts can not be found , a conclusion also reached by forbes ( 1996 ) .",
    "we also find bulge and elliptical systems that are well formed and red .",
    "equally tantalizing are the hints that a large fraction of galaxies are participating in further agglomeration and continued star - formation due to interactions , major mergers , and infalling satellites . taken together ,",
    "these early keck results for distant hst galaxies imply that much larger samples will be needed to disentangle and understand this exciting , complex , and very important early history of galaxies .",
