    "studies of current - voltage curves of tiny contacts between two electrodes  point contact spectroscopy  are a powerful tool for the investigation of charge transport through various systems .",
    "it has provided numerous important results for normal metals and superconductors.@xcite recently , two of us @xcite have studied such point contacts between two _ hopping insulators _ ( hi ) . when the diameter of the contact , @xmath0 , is smaller than the typical hopping distance in the bulk , @xmath1 , it has been found that the resulting conductance is determined by _ individual _ hopping processes , and not by an average over such processes ( as required for the bulk ) . indeed , in this case the tunnelling trajectory for a",
    " critical hop \" passes through the small contact region , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , and , in general , it is not straight . as a result , a typical trajectory connecting the two sides of the point contact , which determines the conductance of the whole system , is longer than the typical hop in the bulk .",
    ", width=188 ]    in this paper we show that the _ magnetoresistance _ of such a point contact provides further information about the properties of the individual localized states at its vicinity .",
    "the contact can also serve as a detector for the local spin polarization .",
    "we discuss several mesoscopic effects revealed by the application of the magnetic field : ( a ) the shrinkage of the wave functions , ( b ) aharonov - bohm oscillations , ( c ) spin accumulation and correlations near the contact , and ( d ) the hall effect .",
    "in addition to discussing such individual hops , we also discuss the statistics of these hops , when the experiment is repeated over many realizations of the sample or of the fermi level within one sample .",
    "the statistical properties of the resistance and of the magnetoresistance of point contacts are found to reflect the spatial and energy distributions of the individual hopping states near the contact .",
    "the calculated distribution function of the magnetoresistances at small values follows a power law ; at large values it decays as a stretched exponential .",
    "the aharonov - bohm oscillations associated with the contact allow the determination of the occupation numbers of the relevant states , as well as the strength of the impurity potential .",
    "spin - dependent effects reveal spin correlations and the point contact can thus serve as a detector of the local spin accumulation or depletion .",
    "finally , the mesoscopic hall effect is sensitive to the correlation length in the bulk , since the percolation cluster shunts the effective `` hall generator '' located near the contact .",
    "thus , the point contact spectroscopy is a powerful tool for _ quantitative studies _ of the nature and of the parameters of individual localized states .",
    "there are two reasons for the large difference between the conductance of the bulk and the conductance through a point contact .",
    "first , as shown in ref . , the total length of a typical  critical hop \" between the sites located near the contact in different half - planes ( or half - spaces ) is about twice larger than for hopping in the bulk .",
    "correspondingly , the resistance associated with this  critical hop \" is exponentially larger than that associated with a typical hop in the bulk .",
    "this leads to specific statistical properties of the contact resistance and magnetoresistance .",
    "the second reason is related to the different geometries of the percolation cluster in the bulk , when the point contact is present or absent .",
    "let us start with the second effect .",
    "the necessity to go via the contact yields an additional constraint on the choice of the hopping sites , compared with the choice for the bulk conductor . to estimate the expected increase of the resistance , we consider first the bulk resistance , @xmath2 ( this is the definition of @xmath3 ) . for the case of mott hopping , this resistance is determined by the effective resistor network percolation cluster , for which @xmath3 exceeds its critical percolation threshold , @xmath4 in @xmath5 dimensions ( here , @xmath6 $ ] , where @xmath7 is the density of states at the fermi energy , and @xmath8 is the decay length of the localized states).@xcite taking @xmath3 within the interval @xmath9 the typical correlation length of the percolation cluster can be estimated by @xcite @xmath10^{-\\nu}\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the hopping length ( which replaces the usual lattice constant for the percolation problem ) and @xmath12 is the percolation correlation length exponent ( equal to 4/3 in two dimensions ) . for a bulk hi , @xmath13 and the correlation length is @xmath14 . in the present case , which pertains to two dimensions , the actual percolating cluster can then be thought of as being built of a regular two dimensional structure , made of random blocks of size @xmath15 . the final resistance @xmath16 is then obtained by averaging the log of the resistance over these blocks .    in the presence of the point contact , the percolating cluster _ must _ pass via the orifice , with a probability of the order of unity . a sufficient condition for this is @xmath17 namely @xmath18 .",
    "otherwise , the orifice may be surrounded by a finite cluster , which is disconnected from the bulk .",
    "this increase in @xmath3 implies an increase in the total resistance , compared to that of the bulk hi .",
    "thus , the resistance of the system may be larger than @xmath19}$ ] . given eq .",
    "( [ bound ] ) , this may be as large as @xmath20 , but the temperature dependence of the resistance is still dominated by that of @xmath21 , which is similar to that of the bulk ( although it is renormalized ) .",
    "in this paper we concentrate on the case @xmath22 . in that case",
    ", we argue that the total resistance is dominated by that of the individual hop near the orifice .",
    "as we show below , this situation generates a different temperature dependence of the resistance , which allows one to discriminate between the two situations experimentally .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : section ii discusses the magnetoresistance , and shows how measurements of both the resistance and the magnetoresistance allow the extraction of detailed information on the individual localized states which dominate the hopping .",
    "this section also discusses the distribution of the magnetoresistance .",
    "section iii discusses the aharonov - bohm oscillations , due to the quantum interference between close paths near the point contact . in sec .",
    "iv we show that the amplitude of these oscillations depends on the site occupation and on the spin configuration of the relevant localized states , and argue that this dependence can be used to identify spin accumulation .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "v discusses the mesoscopic hall effect due to the individual configuration near the point contact .",
    "from now on we restrict the discussion to two - dimensional devices , and model the point contact by an orifice in the thin but infinitely strong barrier dividing the two - dimensional plane into the two semi - infinite half - planes , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "similar arguments also work in three dimensions .",
    "the orifice diameter , @xmath0 , is taken such that @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the concentration of the hopping centers .",
    "we next concentrate on one critical hop , between two sites on the two sides of the orifice , with coordinates @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( both measured from the bottom of the orifice ) .",
    "the assumption @xmath27 ensures that there will be only one such site on each side of the orifice . a relatively weak magnetic field @xmath28 , such that @xmath29 , is applied normally to the plane .",
    "we assume that the thickness of the sample , @xmath30 , satisfies the conditions @xmath31 the inequality @xmath32 ensures the two dimensional character of hopping , and the inequality @xmath33 allows using the three dimensional asymptotic behavior of the localized wave function .",
    "our main results also hold for @xmath34 .",
    "the wave function of a hydrogen - like isolated localized state in a magnetic field can be written as ( see , e.  g. ,  ref .  ) , @xmath35\\cdot \\mathbf{r}\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the wave function shrinkage , described by the factor @xmath36 , originates from the centrifugal potential induced by the magnetic field .",
    "we next discuss the overlap integral , @xmath37 , between the wave functions centered at @xmath38 and at @xmath39 .",
    "as long as we do not consider interference between this hop and other hops , the last term in @xmath40 only represents a phase factor , which does not affect the magnitude of the overlap between the wave functions at sites 1 and 2 . ignoring these phase factors",
    ", one has @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the dielectric constant .",
    "the magnetoconductance ratio @xmath43 is then given by the expression @xmath44    at low fields , it is reasonable to assume that the same pair of centers , at distances @xmath45 and @xmath46 , dominate both the zero field resistance and the low field magnetoresistance .",
    "interestingly , measurements of both the resistance and the magnetoresistance can yield information on the individual hop near the orifice . for the given pair of sites , the zero - field conductance is given as @xmath47\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the activation energy .",
    "this conductance is definitely distinct from the bulk variable range hopping one , which is given by the mott law , @xmath49 in fact , eq . ( [ cond ] ) exhibits an arrhenius activation temperature dependence .",
    "observing such a temperature dependence can indeed confirm that the conductance is dominated by the individual hop near the orifice , and not by the whole percolation cluster , as discussed at the end of the previous section .",
    "measuring this temperature dependence can then yield estimates for both @xmath48 and @xmath50 . measuring the conductance of a similar sample , without the orifice ,",
    "would yield estimates for @xmath51 and for @xmath52 . assuming that @xmath52 is roughly the same in both cases ( the difference in @xmath52 only adds a logarithmic correction to the exponent )",
    ", one can end up with an estimate of the combination @xmath53 .    as stated in ref .",
    ", the magnetoconductance of a similar bulk system has the form @xmath54\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is a numerical factor .",
    "since we know @xmath51 from the conductance , and we know the @xmath56-dependence of @xmath57 , we can use this information for estimating @xmath58 .",
    "measuring eq .",
    "( [ eq : gh ] ) can thus yield estimates for the combination @xmath59 . combining these two equations , one finds @xmath60 .",
    "it should be noted that the choice of the two sites which dominate the conductance may vary with temperature.@xcite in fact , one may end up with different arrhenius curves for different temperature ranges .",
    "the above method can thus yield details about the individual pairs of sites which dominate the hopping in each such range . in principle , this information can be used for building up the distribution of the hopping sites near the orifice in real space and in energy .    interestingly",
    ", the magnetoresistance allows one to find whether the transport is dominated by the states close to the contact . for bulk measurements ,",
    "the conductance yields the hopping length @xmath1 and then @xmath61\\propto r_h^3 $ ] .",
    "in contrast , when the conductance is dominated by the contact then @xmath1 is replaced by @xmath62 .",
    "we next assume that for the most probable configuration one has @xmath63 , where @xmath24 is an effective concentration of the hopping sites relevant for the conductance ( in the cases of the mott or the efros - shklovskii conductance , this concentration is temperature - dependent ) . with this assumption",

    "3+r_2 ^ 3\\sim",
    "2{\\bar r}^3 \\sim r_{12}^3/4 $ ] , namely about 4 times smaller than it would be expected for the bulk magnetoresistance for the same hopping length .",
    "we next discuss the statistics of the magnetoresistance , when the measurements are done on many realizations of similarly prepared samples . for this purpose",
    ", we introduce the relative magnetoresistance , @xmath65 .",
    "we also use the typical value for the exponent in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gh ] ) , @xmath66 .",
    "the characteristic magnetoresistance is then @xmath67 here we have taken into account that @xmath68 . equation ( [ eq : gh ] ) then implies that @xmath69 and the quantity @xmath70 can be treated as a typical value for the magnetoresistance .",
    "we next recall our assumption of low concentration , @xmath71 , which implies that there is only one relevant scatterer on each side of the orifice . at low fields",
    ", the same two centers will dominate both the zero field resistance and the magnetoresistance . under this assumption , the two distances @xmath45 and @xmath46 are independent of each other , and each of them is characterized by a poisson distribution , @xmath72 .",
    "the distribution of the @xmath73 magnetoresistance then becomes ( see appendix [ deriv ] for details ) @xmath74.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this distribution then obeys the scaling form @xmath75 , where @xmath76 } } { \\xi^{1/3 } ( 1-\\xi)^{1/3 } } \\ , , \\ ] ] see the plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : df ] .",
    "this scaling function has the limiting behaviors @xmath77 at small @xmath78 , and @xmath79 for large @xmath78 .",
    "thus at small enough @xmath80 the magnetoresistance has only a power law dependence on @xmath80 , in contrast to the contact resistance itself .",
    "needles to say , this limit represents very rare realizations .    , eq .",
    "( [ eq : df02]).,width=188 ]    at very strong magnetic fields , where the exponent @xmath81 becomes comparable to @xmath21 , the contact resistance can be lowered by including hopping between a pair of sites with site energies outside of the hopping energy band , since the concentration of the corresponding sites is larger and thus their typical spatial separation is smaller .",
    "this additional hopping reduces the magnetoresistance .",
    "such  switching \" between the different pairs with an increasing magnetic field is expected to lead to giant mesoscopic fluctuations of the magnetoresistance , which are similar to the fluctuations of the conductance as a function of temperature and applied bias , considered in ref .  .",
    "the presence of a third localized state , at @xmath82 near the point contact , yields a sample specific aharonov - bohm effect , i.  e. , oscillations of the magnetoconductance due to interference between different tunnelling paths .",
    "we next evaluate the interference between the  direct \" tunnelling trajectory , @xmath73 , which hits the orifice , and the  scattered \" trajectory , that starts at the same initial center , @xmath83 , and reaches the final center , @xmath84 , after being scattered by the scatterer @xmath85 . a typical arrangement of the centers",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .",
    "the trajectories interfere on the left side of the orifice , and almost coincide in the opposite half - space .",
    "the interference triangle for the case shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] is @xmath86 , the interfering paths being @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "we next follow the perturbative approach used by raikh and wessels.@xcite to leading order , the terms which involve site 3 contain denominators like @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the energy @xmath91 is spread within a band with a width of order @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the width of the hopping band .",
    "since the energies @xmath94 and @xmath95 belong to the hopping band , typically one has latexmath:[$|\\varepsilon_3|",
    "\\gg    @xmath91 .",

    "the typical area of the triangle , @xmath103 , can be estimated from the following considerations , cf .",
    "consider the triangle @xmath86 in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . for a symmetric configuration , the difference between the lengths @xmath86 and @xmath104 is @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the height of the triangle while @xmath16 is the distance between 1 and @xmath107 . as in ref .",
    ", we restrict ourselves to configurations where this difference does not exceed @xmath8 , so that typically @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "otherwise , the ratio @xmath110 becomes exponentially small , and the oscillations will not be visible .",
    "the probability for this restriction to hold is of the order of the ratio between @xmath103 and the typical area per impurity , @xmath111 , i.e. @xmath112 . since most experiments are done close to the metal - insulator transition , this probability need not be very low .",
    "once this restriction holds , then we may encounter large values of @xmath113 in eq .",
    "( [ ab ] ) , even for @xmath114 , is of the same order as the critical field for the positive magnetoresistance originating from the shrinkage of the wave functions .",
    "thus the aharonov - bohm oscillations decay strongly for @xmath115 .",
    "however , one can expect that an oscillation pattern will be observed in addition to the smooth increase of the resistance with the magnetic field , since the relative oscillation amplitude , @xmath116 can be of the order of unity .    for coulomb scattering centers with @xmath117 , we can follow the estimates of ref . and conclude that the quantity @xmath118 is of order 1 (  strong scattering \" ) . in the opposite case of weak scattering , @xmath119 , @xmath120 being a distance from the scattering center ,",
    "the dependence of the matrix element on the hopping distance becomes important .",
    "@xcite since in this case @xmath121 , the amplitude of the aharonov - bohm oscillations is significantly less than that for the case of strong scattering .",
    "correspondingly , the interference contribution decreases with the temperature due to the growth of the hopping length .",
    "the aharonov - bohm effect in a point contact can be used to in hopping systems . following ref .",
    ", we consider the situation where site 2 is empty and site 1 is occupied .",
    "if site 3 is also occupied , the tunnelling processes can be considered as tunnelling of the _ hole _ from site 2 to site 1 .",
    "the interference takes place only if the electron spins on sites 1 and 3 are parallel .",

    "otherwise , the interference contribution is absent . when both sites 2 and 3 are empty ( tunnelling of an electron from 1 to 2 ) , the interference effect is also present .    from eq .",

    "( [ 16 ] ) , we have assumed that @xmath129 , corresponding to the case of low temperatures and to hopping from left to right .",
    "the first term in the brackets is sensitive to the site spins . indeed , if there is no spin polarization , and if there are also no spin correlations , then on average @xmath130 .",
    "if there is a non - equilibrium source of spin accumulation or depletion , then the modulation depth will change , signaling the related local polarization .",
    "we next apply an external magnetic field , in equilibrium . writing the zeeman energy as @xmath131 , where @xmath132 is the bohr magneton and",
    "@xmath7 is the @xmath7-factor , we would have @xmath133 , where @xmath134 .",
    "if @xmath135 is in the plane of the triangle , then @xmath136 , and the magnetoresistance would become @xmath137    when the field is perpendicular to the plane , then the magnetoresistance has both the aharonov - bohm oscillations , at a typical scale @xmath138 , and the above contributions , which saturate for @xmath139 .",
    "the ratio of these scales is given by @xmath140 since @xmath141 is of the order of the bohr energy , say 200k , and since experiments would be typically done at a few degrees k , this ratio would become of order unity only when @xmath142 , but then it would be difficult to observe any conductance .",
    "thus , usually @xmath143 , and the spins would be saturated in the amplitude of the aharonov - bohm oscillations .",
    "since the field @xmath144 is well - defined , studies of the magnetoresistance in relatively weak magnetic fields can help calibrating the device , i.e. , finding @xmath118 and @xmath145 .",
    "indeed , if @xmath146 , the system exhibits a positive magnetoresistance , which saturates at @xmath147 .",
    "thus one should look for structures in which the positive magnetoresistance mentioned above is observed ( which means that @xmath148 ) and then obtain @xmath118 from the saturated value of this magnetoresistance according to the formulae given above . here",
    "we may profit from the fact that the saturation field depends only on well - defined values of @xmath149 and @xmath7 , and is thus easily specified .",
    "note that the spins can be aligned by a magnetic field in _ any _ direction , while the aharonov - bohm effect is sensitive only to magnetic fields perpendicular to the plane of the tunnelling .",
    "thus , even in the case when @xmath150 one can separate spin effects by applying the magnetic field parallel to the tunnelling plane .",
    "the effect depends on the product @xmath151 , and therefore it is independent of the _ sign _ of the spin polarization .",
    "this offers an alternative way for the observation of the spin accumulation which is generated by an ac electric field , as predicted in ref .  .",
    "in this paper we concentrate on the situation when the hopping through the point contact is dominated by the vicinity of this contact . in this case , the bias voltage is completely concentrated on the  critical \" pair of sites ( 1 and 2 ) near the orifice . as a result , we expect the hall voltage also to be generated only by the single triangle of sites 13o ( fig .",

    "<S> we also calculate the statistics of this magnetoresistance , which can be collected by changing the gate voltage in a single device . </S>",
    "<S> since the conductance is dominated by the quantum interference of particular mesoscopic structures near the point contact , it is predicted to exhibit aharonov - bohm oscillations , which yield information on the geometry of these structures . </S>",
    "<S> these oscillations also depend on local spin accumulation and correlations , which can be modified by the external field . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we also estimate the mesoscopic hall voltage due to these structures . </S>"
