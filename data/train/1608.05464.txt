    "with most of our used energy being lost as waste heat , there is a growing need for high - performance thermoelectric materials that can directly and reversibly convert heat into electricity .",
    "the efficiency of a thermoelectric material is determined by the dimensionless figure of merit @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the seebeck coefficient , @xmath4 is the electrical conductivity , @xmath5 is the temperature , and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the electronic and phonon thermal conductivities , respectively . to obtain a high @xmath1 value , one must try to increase the power factor ( pf=@xmath8 ) and/or decrease the thermal conductivity",
    ". however , the transport coefficients ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) are not independently tunable because they all depend strongly on the details of the band structure and the scattering of the charge carriers . as a result",
    ", it is still a challenge to obtain high @xmath1 thermoelectric materials , hindering their wide applications .",
    "several successful concepts have been developed to increase the @xmath1 value , such as the use of low dimensionality,@xcite which could enhance the pf due to the sharper density of states ( dos ) near the fermi energy or reduce the thermal conductivity originating from the increased phonon scattering .",
    "therefore , many efforts have been devoted to search for low - dimensional thermoelectric materials .",
    "due to the weak van der waals interactions between the neighboring layers , the layered materials serve as ideal candidates which can be readily exfoliated to two - dimensional ( 2d ) films.@xcite on the other hand , a high valley degeneracy in the electronic structure also contributes to the enhancement of the thermoelectric performance.@xcite such degeneracy can be engineered by tuning the doping and composition in a bulk material.@xcite if we could combine the above two concepts together , namely , introduce the high valley degeneracy into a low dimensional thermoelectric material , a large @xmath1 value may be achieved .",

    "tmdcs are presently being intensively researched due to their diverse and attractive properties.@xcite some of them , tis@xmath11 for example,@xcite were found to be good thermoelectric materials . when exfoliated into film ,",
    "the 2d tis@xmath11 was predicted to have much improved thermoelectric performance compared with its bulk counterpart when the thickness fell below 14 layers.@xcite hfs@xmath11 is another typical tmdc .",
    "it was theoretically predicted that the lattice thermal conductivity of the bulk hfs@xmath11 was about 9 wm@xmath12k@xmath12 at 300 k,@xcite which is much smaller than those of the mos@xmath11@xcite and ws@xmath11,@xcite making the hfs@xmath11 system a promising thermoelectric material .",
    "the room - temperature @xmath1 value of the bulk hfs@xmath11 was about 0.06,@xcite , still far away from the requirement of the thermoelectric application.@xcite if using the method of low dimensionality , the thermoelectric performance of the hfs@xmath11 system may be further enhanced . in this work",
    ", we investigate the thermoelectric properties of the 2d hfs@xmath11 monolayer .",
    "it is demonstrated that the hfs@xmath11 monolayer is an excellent n - type thermoelectric material , with much improved thermoelectric performance compared with the bulk .",
    "furthermore , the band valleys in the hfs@xmath11 monolayer can be effectively tuned by the external strain , and the seebeck coefficient and therefore the peak value of the pf are greatly increased . at the strain of 6% , where the degeneracy of the valence band valleys reach the maximum , the @xmath1 value of the p - type doped system is dramatically increased .",
    "our calculations were performed within the framework of the density functional theory ( dft ) , as implemented in the abinit code.@xcite the exchange correlation energy was in the form of perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe)@xcite with generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) .",

    "the hfs@xmath0 monolayer is an indirect - band - gap semiconductor , with the valence band maximum ( vbm ) and conduction band minimum ( cbm ) located at the @xmath22 and @xmath25 points , respectively .",
    "the band splitting due to the soc is observed . in particular , at @xmath22 point , the splitting energy @xmath26 of the vbm is 0.13 ev , thus the degeneracy of the two valleys near the vbm changes from 2 without soc to 1 when soc is included .",
    "however , the degeneracy of the conduction band valley near the cbm is unchanged .",
    "the band gap is calculated to be 1.22 ( 1.29 ) ev with ( without ) soc included .",
    "the electronic transport coefficients ( @xmath3 , @xmath27 ) are shown in figs .",

    "we can see that for the p - type doping , the seebeck coefficient and therefore the pf ( with relaxation time @xmath28 inserted ) are decreased due to the soc , while for the n - type doping , they keep unchanged .",
    "if we notice the change of the band structure due to the soc , we can deduce that the decrease of the seebeck coefficient may be caused by the decrease of the valley degeneracy .",
    "therefore , a possible way to optimize the pf is to engineer the band valleys .",
    "strain is an effective way to tune the electronic structure of the 2d material . in the following , a biaxial tensile strain , which is defined as @xmath29 ,",

    "no imaginary frequencies are observed in the phonon spectra until the strain increases up to 9% .",
    "when the strain reaches 10% , small imaginary frequency appears along the @xmath30 direction , thus the system tends to be unstable .",
    "therefore , the largest strain that the hfs@xmath0 monolayer can withstand is 9% .",
    "the hfs@xmath0 monolayer can withstand a relatively large strain , mainly originating from the special sandwich structure . when the strain is applied , the outer s atom layers move inside , so the thickness of the hfs@xmath0 monolayer is decreased , while the bond length between hf and s atoms is slightly altered .",

    "next , the strain effect on the electronic properties is investigated .",

    "the three valleys converge in energy and @xmath31 is decreased to zero . at this strain condition",
    ", the degeneracy of the valence band valley reaches the maximum , as displayed by the inset of fig .",
    "when further increasing the strain , the energy of valleys i and iii becomes larger than that of the valley ii , and the degeneracy is reduced , as demonstrated by the inset of fig .",
    "3(f ) . for the conduction band valleys , as the strain",
    "is increased , the valley iv is gradually elevated , while the valleys v and vi are lowered , therefore , the @xmath32 decreases monotonically with the increase of the strain ( see fig .",
    "the increase of the band valley degeneracy may be beneficial to the thermoelectric performance . in the following ,",
    "the electronic transport coefficients of the hfs@xmath0 monolayer under different strains are calculated by using the semiclassical boltzmann theory .",
    "since the system becomes unstable when the strain reaches 10% , we only consider the condition when the strain is not larger than 9% .",
    "figure 5(a ) shows the calculated absolute values of the seebeck coefficients at 300 k as a function of the doping concentration .",
    "we can see that for the p - type doping , the seebeck coefficient first increases as the increase of the strain , reaches its maximum at the strain of 6% , and then slightly decreases when further increasing the strain . for the n - type doping , however , the absolute value of the seebeck coefficient increases monotonically as a function of the strain , thus it reaches the maximum at the strain of 9% . if we notice the energy difference between the band valleys ( see fig .",
    "4 ) , we can find that the seebeck coefficient increases as the absolute value of the valley energy difference is decreased .",
    "when @xmath31 decreases to zero , the degeneracy of the valence band valleys becomes the largest , and thus the absolute value of the seebeck coefficient of the p - type doping reaches the maximum .",
    "the trend of the electrical conductivity as a function of the strain ( see fig .",
    "5(b ) ) is just opposite to that of the seebeck coefficient . here",
    "the relaxation time @xmath28 is inserted as a parameter .",
    "the electrical conductivity @xmath33 is generally decreased by the applied strain , which is detrimental to the pf . whether the pf will be improved by the strain or not is determined by the balance between the seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity . in fig .",
    "5(d ) , we plot the pf ( with @xmath28 inserted ) at 300 k as a function of the doping concentration under different strains . for the p - type doping ,",
    "the peak value of the pf first increases as increasing the strain , reaches the maximum at the strain of 6% , and then decreases slightly when the strain is further increased . for the n - type doping , however , the pf increases monotonically with the increase of the strain .",
    "the tread of the pf as a function of the strain is the same as that of the seebeck coefficient , indicating that the negative effect of the strain on the electrical conductivity is overweighed by the increase of the seebeck coefficient .",
    "therefore , the pf of the hfs@xmath0 monolayer can be greatly improved by the valley engineering through the method of strain .",

    "the hfs@xmath0 monolayer has much smaller lattice thermal conductivity than those of the mo / w based tmdc monolayers,@xcite the same as the case of the bulk systems.@xcite moreover , when under the external strain of 6% , the room - temperature @xmath7 is further suppressed to be 2.22 wm@xmath12k@xmath12 , due to the phonon softening of transverse and longitudinal acoustic ( ta and la ) modes , as well as the reduced gap between the acoustical and optical phonon bands ( see fig .",

    "the hfs@xmath0 monolayer can be used as an excellent n - type thermoelectric material .",
    "however , in the fabrication of thermoelectric modules , both the p- and n - legs are needed .",
    "interestingly , we find that the @xmath1 value of the p - type doped system is significantly increased by the applied strain , from 0.60 for the unstrained hfs@xmath0 monolayer to 3.67 for the 6% strained one . however , for the n - type doping , in spite of the increased peak value of the power factor ( with relaxation time inserted , see fig .",
    "5(d ) ) , the @xmath1 value is decreased by the external strain , from 4.48 for the unstrained system to 3.08 for the strained one .",
    "this is because that when inserting the thermal conductivity to evaluate the @xmath1 value , the optimal doping concentration gets decreased , moving to the region where the pf of the strained system is slightly smaller than that of the unstrained one .",
    "although slightly decreased , the room - temperature @xmath1 value is still above 3.0 , reaching the requirement of the thermoelectric application.@xcite    in table 2 , we summarize the maximum @xmath1 values of the unstrained and 6% strained hfs@xmath0 monolayer , with the optimal doping concentration and the corresponding seebeck coefficient , electrical conductivity , electronic and lattice thermal conductivities included . for the p - type doping , we can see that at the optimal doping concentration , where the maximum @xmath1 value is obtained , both the seebeck coefficient and the electrical conductivity is increased by the strain , while the lattice thermal conductivity is decreased , which lead to the significantly increased @xmath1 value . for the n - type doping , at the optimal doping concentration , although the electronic and lattice thermal conductivities are decreased , the seebeck coefficient and the electrical conductivity are also decreased , resulting in the decreased @xmath1 value for the 6% strained system .",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated the electronic , phonon , and thermoelectric properties of the hfs@xmath0 monolayer .",

    ", the maximum room - temperature @xmath1 value of 3.67 can be achieved for the p - type doped system , which is five times larger than that of the unstrained one .",
    "our results indicate that the thermoelectric performance of the hfs@xmath0 monolayer can be greatly improved by the band valley engineering through the method of strain .    in experiments",
    ", we can introduce strain to a 2d material in various ways .",
    "traditionally , strain can arise from the lattice mismatch between epitaxial thin films and substrates.@xcite in recent years , with the progress in nanotechnology , one could transfer a 2d film to a soft supporting substrate and apply strain to the film by either stretching@xcite or bending@xcite the substrate . by using this method",
