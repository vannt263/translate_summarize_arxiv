    "dark energy is one of the most important themes in physics today .",
    "however , we do not know much about dark energy due to the accuracy of current data . though the current observational data are consistent with a cosmological constant , the possibility that dark energy is dynamical is still not excluded by the data and has been attracting wide attentions in the cosmology and theoretical physics communities .    in order to detect the dynamics of dark energy ,",
    "one usually has to parameterize the equation - of - state parameter ( eos ) , @xmath13 , empirically , using two or more free parameters . among all the parametrization forms of eos ,",
    "the chevallier - polarski - linder ( cpl ) parametrization  @xcite , @xmath14 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are parameters and @xmath15 is the scale factor of the universe , is the most widely used one and has been explored extensively .",
    "however , as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the cpl description will lead to unrealistic behavior in the future evolution , i.e. , @xmath16 grows rapidly and eventually encounters divergence as the redshift @xmath17 approaches @xmath18 . in order to keep the advantage of the cpl parametrization and",
    "avoid its drawback at the same time , it is believed that a parametrization that is free of divergence both in the past and future evolutions is necessary .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , ma and zhang proposed the following hybrid form of logarithm and cpl parametrizations : @xmath19 this novel parametrization has well behaved , bounded evolution for both high redshifts and negative redshifts . in particular , for the limiting situation , @xmath20 , a finite value for eos can be obtained , @xmath21 . at low redshifts , this parametrization form reduces to the linear one , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 . of course",
    ", one can also recast it at low redshifts as the cpl form , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , it is clear to see that this parametrization exhibits well - behaved feature for the dynamical evolution of dark energy . without question ,",
    "such a two - parameter form of eos can genuinely cover scalar - field models as well as other theoretical scenarios . in ref .",
    "@xcite , this parametrization was used to explore the ultimate fate of the universe .",
    "the parametrization ( [ mz ] ) has been explored deeply by using the current data . in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have analyzed the detection of dynamics of dark energy with the parametrization ( [ mz ] ) by performing a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) global fitting method . since",
    "dark energy parameters are tightly correlated with the spatial curvature @xmath2 and neutrino mass @xmath26 , in this paper we will deeply analyze the influences of these factors on the detection of dynamics of dark energy .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : data ] we will introduce our global fitting procedure and the data we used for analysis ; the results are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : result ] , and our conclusion is given in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclu ] .",
    "we have modified mcmc package cosmomc  @xcite to perform a global fitting analysis for the dynamical dark energy parameterized above .",
    "as we know , within the dynamical dark energy models , the perturbations of dark energy are important  @xcite for the data fitting analysis . for quintessencelike or phantomlike models , whose @xmath13 does not cross the cosmological constant boundary , the perturbation of dark energy is well defined .",
    "however , when @xmath13 crosses @xmath18 , which is described by a quintom dark energy model  @xcite , one is encountered with the divergence problem for perturbations of dark energy at @xmath27 . for avoiding such kind of divergence problem , in this paper",
    "we use the method provided in refs .",
    "@xcite to treat the dark energy perturbations consistently in the whole parameter space in the numerical calculations .",
    "our most general parameter space vector is : @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 , with @xmath31 and @xmath32 the physical baryon and cold dark matter densities relative to the critical density , @xmath2 is the spatial curvature satisfying @xmath33 , @xmath3 is the total mass of neutrinos , @xmath34 is the ratio ( multiplied by 100 ) of the sound horizon to the angular diameter distance at decoupling , @xmath35 is the optical depth to re - ionization , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the parameters of dark energy eos given by eq .",
    "( [ mz ] ) , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the amplitude and the spectral index of the primordial scalar perturbation power spectrum , and @xmath38 is the sound speed of dark energy . for the pivot scale",
    "we set @xmath39mpc@xmath40 .",
    "note that we have assumed purely adiabatic initial conditions .",
    "note that the sound speed of dark energy is fixed in our analysis . in the framework of the linear perturbation theory , besides the eos of dark energy , the dark energy perturbations can also be characterized by the sound speed , @xmath41 .",
    "the sound speed of dark energy might affect the evolution of perturbations , and might leave signatures on the cmb power spectrum @xcite .",
    "however , it has been shown that the constraints on the dark energy sound speed @xmath42 in dynamical dark energy models are still very weak , since the current observational data are still not accurate enough @xcite .",
    "therefore , in our analysis , we have treated the dark energy as a scalar - field model ( multi - fields or single field with high derivative ) and set @xmath42 to be 1 .",
    "of course , one can also take @xmath42 as a parameter , but the fit results would not be affected by this treatment @xcite .    in the computation of the cosmic microwave background anisotropy ( cmb ) , we include the 7-year wmap temperature and polarization power spectra @xcite with the routine for computing the likelihood supplied by the wmap team  @xcite . for the large scale structure ( lss ) information , we use the power spectrum of luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) measured from the sdss dr7 @xcite . the supernova ( sn )",
    "data we use are the recently released `` union2 '' sample of 557 data @xcite ; note that the systematic errors are included in our analysis . in the calculation of the likelihood from",
    "sn we marginalize over the relevant nuisance parameter @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we make use of the hubble space telescope ( hst ) measurement of the hubble constant @xmath43  km  s@xmath40  mpc@xmath40 by a gaussian likelihood function centered around @xmath44 and with a standard deviation @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "in this section we shall present the results of the global fitting analysis .",
    "in particular , we shall test the influences on probing the dynamics of dark energy when spatial curvature and massive neutrinos are considered in the data analysis .",
    "since we know that both the spatial curvature parameter @xmath2 and the total mass of neutrinos @xmath26 are degenerate with the equation of state of dark energy @xmath13 , we are very much interested in seeing how these two factors affect the constraints on the parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , we also want to see how the current data constrain @xmath2 and @xmath26 within the framework of dynamical dark energy with parametrization ( [ mz ] ) .",
    "dark energy parameters and @xmath2 are correlated via the cosmological distance information . from the observation of cmb",
    ", the curvature of the observable universe @xmath2 can be determined by the position of first acoustic peak of cmb temperature power spectrum precisely .",
    "however , @xmath2 is tightly degenerated with @xmath46 , and such degeneracy can be , in certain level , broken by taking into account the data of large scale structure and supernovae .",
    "in constraining @xmath2 , one usually uses a combination of distance measurements from baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) and cmb . in this paper , however , we use the power spectrum of lrgs measured from sdss dr7 , instead of bao , to constrain @xmath2 . note that bao and the lrg power spectrum can not be treated as independent data sets because a part of the measurement of bao comes from lrgs as well . since the lrg power spectrum is a powerful probe of the total mass of neutrinos , @xmath26 , in this paper we uniformly use the lrg power spectrum , instead of bao , to constrain @xmath2 and @xmath26 . in the following",
    "we shall consider the case of massless neutrinos and see the influence of @xmath2 .",
    ", @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath46 and @xmath1 in the dynamical dark energy scenario ( [ mz]).[fig1 ] ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we present the two dimensional cross correlation and one dimensional probability distribution of @xmath2 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath46 and @xmath1 by fitting with 7-yr wmap , lrg , sn and @xmath1 data . from the panels of @xmath2@xmath4 and @xmath2@xmath5 , we find that the correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath4 is positive , but we do not observe much correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath47 confidence level ( cl ) constraint on @xmath2 is @xmath48 , from which we can see that our universe is very close to flatness .",
    "the @xmath6 cl limit is : @xmath7 .",
    "so , we find that in the dynamical dark energy model ( [ mz ] ) the spatial curvature is well constrained by wmap+lrg+sn+@xmath1 .",
    "it is of interest to make a comparison to the cases of @xmath49cdm ( @xmath27 ) model and constant @xmath13 model .",
    "komatsu et al . gave the limit on @xmath2 for the case of @xmath27 , @xmath50 ( @xmath47 cl ) , from wmap+bao+@xmath1 , and for the case of constant @xmath13 , @xmath51 ( @xmath47 cl ) , from wmap+bao+sn , where sn is the constitution sample .",
    "these results are in good agreement with our limit .",
    "how does the spatial curvature parameter , @xmath2 , affect the constraint results of ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) ?",
    "we find that , in a non - flat universe , the results are : @xmath52 thus , even when @xmath13 is allowed to depend on time , the current data are still consistent with a cosmological constant",
    ". however , a large range of values of ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) are still allowed by the data . comparing to the case in a flat universe : @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( @xmath47 cl )",
    ", we find that the best - fit values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 are shifted by @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively ; the error in @xmath4 is amplified by @xmath9 , and the error in @xmath5 is almost the same , only amplified by @xmath10 .",
    "one may be curious to know why the error on @xmath4 is significantly amplified , but that for @xmath5 is scarcely affected by the presence of @xmath2 .",
    "actually , this is fairly easy to be understood . from the fitting results , it is clear to see that @xmath4 is constrained more tightly than @xmath5 , i.e. , @xmath4 is more sensitive to the data , comparing to @xmath5 .",
    "the current constraint on @xmath5 is very weak , only at the level of @xmath57 , while for @xmath4 the constraint is much stronger , at the level of @xmath58 .",
    "thus , once @xmath2 is involved in the analysis , its influence on @xmath4 is , obviously , much greater than that on @xmath5 .    of course , the fact that @xmath5 is insensitive to the data is not specific to our parametrization form . in general , for a two - parameter dark energy eos form in which @xmath4 serves as a constant part and @xmath5 is used to describe the dynamical evolution of the eos , @xmath5 is always insensitive to the data comparing to @xmath4 .",
    "the constraints on @xmath4 and @xmath5 are mainly determined from their contributions to the hubble expansion rate @xmath59 which is more sensitive to @xmath4 than @xmath5 . during the calculation ,",
    "considering the same variations of @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the effect on @xmath59 from @xmath4 is more significant than that from @xmath5 .",
    "thus , when using the observational data to explore dark energy eos , the constraint on @xmath4 is usually better than that on @xmath5 by about one order of magnitude .",
    "this explains the fact that the time - evolution of dark energy eos can not be well probed by the current cosmological data . taking the number of parameters into account",
    ", it has been shown that the @xmath49cdm model is still the best one among all the current dark energy models ; see , e.g. , refs .",
    "it is expected that the dark energy observations of the next generation could measure the dynamical evolution of dark energy accurately .",
    "so , our conclusion that @xmath4 is affected by @xmath2 more severely than @xmath5 is universal , not specific to the parametrization adopted in this paper .",
    "obviously , the same conclusion is applicable to the case of massive neutrinos that will be discussed in the next subsection .",
    "weighting the neutrino mass is one of the most important challenges in modern physics .",
    "currently the neutrino oscillation experiments , such as atmospheric neutrinos experiments @xcite and solar neutrinos experiments @xcite , have confirmed that the neutrinos are massive , but give no hint on their absolute mass scale .",
    "cosmology can provide crucial complementary information on absolute neutrino masses , because massive neutrinos leave imprints on the cosmological observations , such as the hubble diagram , cmb temperature power spectrum and lss matter power spectrum @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , komatsu et al . have constrained the total mass of neutrinos , @xmath60 , from the 7-yr wmap data combined with the distance information . for a flat @xmath49cdm model ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath27 and @xmath61 , they found that the wmap+bao+@xmath1 limit is @xmath62 ev ( @xmath6 cl ) .",
    "the limit improves when information on the growth of structure is added .",
    "for example , they found that , when the bao is replaced by the power spectrum of lrgs , the combination wmap+lrg+@xmath1 gives @xmath63 ev ( @xmath6 cl ) for @xmath27 .",
    "thus , we can see that the power spectrum of lrgs plays an important role in constraining the neutrino mass .",
    "in the following we shall use the combination of wmap+lrg+sn+@xmath1 to constrain the neutrino mass , @xmath26 , as well as the parameters of dynamical dark energy , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , in a flat universe .",
    ", @xmath5 , @xmath46 , @xmath1 and @xmath26 in the dynamical dark energy scenario ( [ mz]).[fig2 ] ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we present the two dimensional cross correlation and one dimensional probability distribution of @xmath26 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath46 and @xmath1 , from the data combination wmap+lrg+sn+@xmath1 . from the panels of @xmath26@xmath4 and @xmath26@xmath5 , we find that there is an anti - correlation between @xmath4 and @xmath26 , but no significant correlation between @xmath5 and @xmath26 is observed .",
    "the global fitting gives the constraint on the neutrino mass in our dynamical dark energy scenario : @xmath8 ev ( @xmath6 cl ) .",
    "so , it is interesting to find that in our dynamical dark energy scenario ( [ mz ] ) the total mass of neutrinos can be well constrained by the data combination wmap+lrg+sn+@xmath1 . to make a comparison , we show the results of the constant @xmath13 model given by komatsu et al .",
    "@xcite : @xmath64 ev ( @xmath6 cl ) from wmap+lrg+@xmath1 , and @xmath65 ev ( @xmath6 cl ) from wmap+bao+sn ( where sn is the constitution data ) . in our case , even though there is one more parameter , @xmath5 , the constraint on @xmath3 is much tighter .",
    "this shows that the data combination we used , wmap+lrg+sn+@xmath1 , is fairly good at constraining the neutrino mass . to show this more clearly",
    ", we also use our data combination to make a global fitting calculation for the case of the constant @xmath13 model , and the constraint result we obtained is @xmath66 ev ( 95% cl ) .    how does the neutrino mass , @xmath26 , affect the constraint results of ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) ? we find that , with the non - zero neutrino mass , the results are : @xmath67 so , still , though the current data are consistent with a cosmological constant , a large range of values of ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) are still allowed by the data . comparing to the case with a zero neutrino mass , @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( @xmath47 cl ) , we find that the best - fit value of @xmath4 is shifted by @xmath68 , and the best - fit value of @xmath5 is shifted by @xmath69 ; the error in @xmath4 is amplified by @xmath11 , and the error in @xmath5 is amplified by @xmath12 . obviously , the reason that the influence on the error of @xmath4 by the presence of @xmath26 is much severer than that of @xmath5 is as the same as the case of the spatial curvature : @xmath4 is much more sensitive to the data than @xmath5 .",
    "with the 7-yr wmap temperature and polarization data , the power spectrum of lrgs derived from sdss dr7 , the type ia supernova data from union2 sample , and the new measurements of @xmath1 from hst , we have tested the dynamical dark energy parametrization , @xmath70 , in the presence of spatial curvature and massive neutrinos , by using a mcmc global fit method . for a time - dependent equation of state",
    ", one must be careful about the treatment of perturbations in dark energy when @xmath13 crosses @xmath18 .",
    "we used the method provided in refs .",
    "@xcite to treat the dark energy perturbations consistently in the whole parameter space in our numerical calculations",
    ". the sound speed of dark energy , @xmath42 , is fixed in our calculation to be 1 ; note that the value of @xmath42 is actually insensitive to our final fit results .",
    "our focus was put on the determinations of the spatial curvature of the observable universe , @xmath2 , and the total mass of neutrinos , @xmath3 , in our dynamical dark energy scenario , and the influence of these factors to the constraints on the dark energy parameters , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .    the @xmath6 cl limit on the spatial curvature is @xmath7 .",
    "thus , we find that in our dynamical dark energy model the spatial curvature is well constrained by wmap+lrg+sn+@xmath1 . in a curved universe , the constraint results of @xmath4 and @xmath5 are @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( @xmath47 cl ) .",
    "comparing to the case in a flat universe , @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( @xmath47 cl ) , we find that the error in @xmath4 is amplified by @xmath9 , and the error in @xmath5 is almost the same , only amplified by @xmath10 .",
    "our global fit gives the constraint on the neutrino mass in our dynamical dark energy scenario , @xmath8 ev ( @xmath6 cl ) .",
    "so , we find that in our dynamical dark energy scenario the total mass of neutrinos can be well constrained by the data combination wmap+lrg+sn+@xmath1 . with the non - zero neutrino mass ,",

    "we believe that it is fairly important to use some divergence - free parametrization to probe the dynamical evolution of dark energy .",
