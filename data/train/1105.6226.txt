    "pioneering observations of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) @xcite have demonstrated that our present universe is passing through an accelerated phase of expansion preceded by a period of deceleration .",
    "a new type of matter with negative pressure known as dark energy , has come up to explain the present phase of acceleration .",
    "the simplest candidate of dark energy , the cosmological constant ( @xmath1 ) , is consistent with various observations such as more precise supernova data @xcite , the cmb observations @xcite , the light elements abundance from big bang nucleosynthesis @xcite , the baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) detected in sdss sky survey @xcite , radio galaxies @xcite , and gamma - ray bursts @xcite . however , various other models were proposed as candidates of dark energy , such as the typical dynamical scalar field called quintessence @xcite , phantom corrections @xcite , a joint quintom scenario @xcite or chaplygin gas @xcite , to mention just a few out of a long list . on the other hand",
    "there are still many other ways to understand the accelerating universe , such as modified friedmann equation @xcite and dvali - gabadadze - porrati(dgp ) mechanism @xcite .",
    "but until now none of these models was demonstrated superior over the other .",
    "besides , while updating the current estimates of cosmological model parameters , one should try to use new probes .",
    "strongly gravitationally lensed systems belong to this category",
    ". they can provide the information on two angular diameter distances , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "one is the distance to the source and the other is that between the defector and the source . since angular diameter distance depends on cosmological geometry , we can use their ratios to constrain cosmological models .",
    "the discovery of strong gravitational lensing in q0957 + 561 @xcite opened up an interesting possibility to use strong lens systems in the study of cosmology and astrophysics .",
    "up to now , strong lensing has developed into an important astrophysical tool for probing both cosmology @xcite and galaxies ( their structure , formation , and evolution ) @xcite .",
    "now several hundreds of strong lens systems produced by massive galaxies have been discovered , but only @xmath7 galactic - scale strong lenses with known redshift of the lens and the source and measured image separation can form well - defined samples useful for statistical analyses .",
    "these well - defined strong lenses are particularly useful not only for constraining the statistical properties of galaxies such as stellar velocity dispersions or galaxy evolution @xcite , but also for constraining cosmological parameters such as the present - day matter density @xmath8 , dark energy density @xmath9 and its equation of state @xmath2 @xcite . for example , the cosmic lens all - sky survey ( class ) statistical data , which consists of 8958 radio sources out of which 13 sources are multiply imaged @xcite was first extensively used by @xcite , who found @xmath10 assuming a flat cosmology and non - evolving galaxy populations .",
    "@xcite reused this class statistical sample based on the velocity dispersion function ( vdf ) of early - type galaxies derived from the sdss data release 1 ( dr1 ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite reanalyzed 10 class multiply - imaged sources whose image - splittings are known to be caused by single early - type galaxies to check the validity of the dgp model with radio - selected gravitational lensing statistics .",
    "more recently , the distribution of gravitationally - lensed image separations observed in the cosmic lens all - sky survey ( class ) , the pmn - nvss extragalactic lens survey ( panels ) , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and other surveys was used by @xcite , who found @xmath11 assuming a flat cosmology and adopting semi - analytical modeling of galaxy formation .",
    "the idea of using strongly gravitationally lensed systems , in particular measurements of their einstein radii combined with spectroscopic data , for measuring cosmological parameters including the cosmic equation of state was discussed in @xcite and also in a more recent papers @xcite .    on the other hand , galaxy clusters , as the largest dynamical structures in the universe",
    ", are also widely used both in cosmology and astrophysics .",
    "firstly , their mass distributions at different redshifts can be described by the press - schechter function @xcite , which reflects the linear growth rate of density perturbations and therefore can provide constraints on cosmological parameters such as the matter and dark energy densities @xcite .",
    "secondly , combining the sunyaev - zeldovich effect @xcite with observations of clusters x - ray luminosity , one is able to measure or estimate the hubble constant and other cosmological parameters in given cosmological model @xcite .",
    "relevant discussions on the corrections to the sunyaev - zeldovich effect for galaxy clusters can be found in @xcite .",
    "more importantly , giant arcs generated by the galaxy cluster are perfect indicators of its surface mass density , while the mass distribution of the cluster s mass halo can be modelled from x - ray luminosity and temperature , which may provide certain observable @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite collected a new sample with such data from an online database bax and various literature , which led to some interesting results compared with those obtained by @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we try to collect a relatively complete observational data concerning the hubble constant independent ratio between two angular diameter distances @xmath0 from various large systematic gravitational lens surveys and galaxy cluster data .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [",
    "sec : method ] , we briefly describe the methodology for both strong gravitationally lensed systems : galactic lenses and galaxy clusters",
    ". then , in section  [ sec : data ] we present the @xmath0 data from various large systematic gravitational lens surveys and lensing galaxy clusters with x - ray observations and optical giant luminous arcs .",
    "we further introduce three popular cosmological models tested in section  [ sec : model ] .",
    "finally , we show the results of constraining cosmological parameters using mcmc method and conclude in section  [ sec : result ] .",
    "gravitational lensing is one of the successful predictions of general relativity .",
    "strong gravitational lensing occurs whenever the source , the lens and the observer are so well aligned that the observer - source direction lies inside the so - called einstein ring of the lens .",
    "@xcite tried to use lensing images as indicators to estimate cluster mass and constrain cosmological constant .    in a cosmological context",
    "the source is usually a quasar with a galaxy acting as the lens .",
    "strong lensing reveals itself as multiple images of the source , and the image separations in the system depend on angular diameter distances to the lens and to the source , which in turn are determined by background cosmology . since the discovery of the first gravitational lens the number of strongly lensed systems increased to a hundred ( in the castles data base ) and is steadily increasing following new surveys like the sloan lens acs ( slacs ) survey @xcite .",
    "this opens a possibility to constraining the cosmological model provided that we have good knowledge of the lens model .",
    "now , the idea is that the formula for the einstein radius in a sis lens ( or its sie equivalent ) , @xmath12 depends on the cosmological model through the ratio of ( angular diameter ) distances between lens and source and between observer and lens . under flat friedman - walker metric",
    ", the angular diameter distance reads @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the hubble constant and @xmath15 is a dimensionless expansion rate dependent on redshift @xmath16 and cosmological model parameters * p*. if the einstein radius @xmath17 from image astrometry and stellar velocity dispersion @xmath18 ( or central velocity dispersion @xmath19 ) from spectroscopy can be determined , this method can be used to constrain cosmological parameters .",
    "the advantage of this method is that it is independent of the hubble constant value and is not affected by dust absorption or source evolutions .",
    "however , it depends on the measurements of @xmath19 and lens modelling ( e.g. singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) or singular isothermal ellipsoid ( sie ) assumption ) .",
    "hopefully , spectroscopic data for central parts of lens galaxies became available from the lens structure and dynamics ( lsd ) survey and the more recent slacs survey etc , which make it possible to assess the central velocity dispersions @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the sis ( or sie ) model is still a useful assumption in gravitational lensing studies and should be accurate enough as first - order approximation to the mean properties of galaxies relevant to statistical lensing .",
    "for example , @xcite found that inside one effective radius massive elliptical galaxies are kinematically indistinguishable from an isothermal ellipsoid . in the previous works ,",
    "such an isothermal mass profile has also been widely used for analyses of statistical lensing @xcite .    however , let us note here that the velocity dispersion @xmath20 of the mass distribution and the observed stellar velocity dispersion @xmath21 need not be the same .",
    "@xcite argued that there is a strong indication that dark matter halos are dynamically hotter than the luminous stars based on x - ray observations , and dark matter must necessarily have a greater velocity dispersion than the visible stars . in this paper , we adopt a free parameter @xmath22 that relates the velocity dispersion @xmath20 and the stellar velocity dispersion @xmath19 @xcite : @xmath23 to be more specific , we have kept @xmath22 as a free parameter , since it mimics the effects of : ( i ) systematic errors in the rms difference between @xmath21 ( observed stellar velocity dispersion ) and @xmath20 ( sis model velocity dispersion ) ; ( ii ) the rms error caused by assuming the sis model in order to translate the observed image separation into @xmath17 , since the observed image separation does not directly correspond to @xmath17 ; ( iii ) softened isothermal sphere potentials which tend to decrease the typical image separations @xcite , and could be represented by @xmath22 somewhat smaller than @xmath24 .",
    "@xcite found that the presence of the background matter tends to increase the image separations produced by lensing galaxies from ray - tracing simulations in cdm models , though this effect is small , of order of @xmath25 or less .",
    "@xcite showed that richer environments of early type galaxies may have a higher ratio of dwarf to giant galaxies than the field .",
    "however , @xcite showed that this effect nearly cancels the effect of the background matter , making the distribution of image separations significantly independent of environment .",
    "they predicted that lenses in groups have a mean image separation which is @xmath26 smaller than that of lenses in the field .",
    "therefore , all these above factors can possibly affect the images separation by up to @xmath27 , which may be mimicked by introducing @xmath28 @xcite .    in the method we use ,",
    "the cosmological model enters not through a distance measure directly , but rather through a distance ratio @xmath29}{\\int_{0}^{z_s}[dz'/e(z';\\textbf{p})]}\\ ] ] and respective observable counterpart reads @xmath30 with its corresponding uncertainty calculated through propagation equation concerning the errors both on the stellar velocity dispersion @xmath21 and the einstein radius @xmath17 ( @xmath31 error for the einstein radius @xcite ) .",
    "another source of systematic errors in our method comes from the fact that einstein radius estimation from observed image positions depends on the lens model ( sis or sie or the other realistic mass distribution ) .",
    "moreover , the image separation could be affected by nearby masses ( satellites , neighbor galaxies ) or the structures along the line of sight .",
    "this last issue will also be discussed in the last section . here",
    ", let us note that formally , at the level of eq.([ratio1 ] ) the @xmath32 factor does the double job accounting for systematics associated both with @xmath19 and @xmath17 . since the main goal of this paper is to constrain cosmological parameters ,",
    "we firstly consider @xmath32 as a free parameter , obtain its best - fit value and probability distribution function @xmath33 , and then treat it as a `` nuisance '' parameter to determine constraints on the relevant cosmological parameters of interest .",
    "the procedure of marginalization is carried out following that of @xcite , where @xmath33 is normalized to one and is usually taken to be a gaussian or a @xmath34 function peaked at the best - fit value of @xmath35 .",
    "we then integrate the likelihood function , @xmath36 and determine the best - fit values and confidence level contours from @xmath37 .",
    "moreover , strong lensing by clusters with galaxies acting as sources can produces giant arcs around galaxy clusters , which can also be used to constrain clusters projected mass and cosmological parameters @xcite .",
    "when a galaxy cluster is relaxed enough , the hydrostatic isothermal spherical symmetric @xmath38-model @xcite can be used to describe the intracluster medium(icm ) density profile : @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the central electron density , @xmath41 and @xmath42 denote the slope and the core radius , respectively . assuming that whole gas volume is isothermal ( with the temperature @xmath43 ) ,",
    "the gravity of relaxed cluster and its gas pressure should balance each other according to the hydrostatic equilibrium condition . with the approximation of spherical symmetry",
    ", the cluster mass profile can be given by @xmath44 , where @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are , respectively , the boltzmann constant , the proton mass , and the mean molecular weight @xcite .",
    "a theoretical surface density can be derived as @xmath48 combining this with the critical surface mass density for lensing arcs @xcite @xmath49 a hubble constant independent ratio can be obtained @xmath50 the x - ray data fitting results may provide us the above mentioned relevant parameters such as @xmath43 , @xmath41 , and @xmath51 . the position of tangential critical curve @xmath52 is usually deemed to be equal to the observational arc position @xmath53 . in this paper we assume that the deflecting angle has a slight difference with the arc radius angle , @xmath54 , with the correction factor @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "the complete set of standard priors and allowances of the above parameters included in eq .",
    "[ [ ratio2 ] ] can be found in table 1 of @xcite .",
    "the observational @xmath56 and its corresponding uncertainty are also calculated through eq .",
    "[ [ ratio2 ] ] .",
    "we stress here that the observational distance ratio @xmath57 has both advantage and disadvantage .",
    "the positive side is that the hubble constant @xmath14 gets cancelled , hence it does not introduce any uncertainty to the results .",
    "the disadvantage is that the power of estimating @xmath8 is relatively poor @xcite .",
    "therefore we only attempt to fit @xmath8 in the case of a @xmath1cdm model ( where it is the only free parameter in flat cosmology ) . then for both cases above ( eq .  [ [ ratio1 ] ] and eq .  [ [ ratio2 ] ] ) ,",
    "we can fit theoretical models to observational data by minimizing the @xmath58 function @xmath59 where the sum is over the sample and @xmath60 denotes the variance of @xmath61 .",
    "for the einstein ring data , we first use a combined sample of 70 strong lensing systems with good spectroscopic measurements of central dispersions from the slacs and lsd surveys @xcite .",
    "original data concerning the sample can be found in @xcite(see for details ) . in our sample of 70 lenses",
    "some have 2 images and some have 4 .",
    "there are some general arguments in favor of sis model , but strictly speaking sis lens should have only 2 images @xcite , so one can try to use only 2 image systems out of the full sample .",
    "therefore we selected a subsample of @xmath62 lenses , which is summarized in table [ list ] where the names of lenses in the restricted sample are given in bold .",
    "as for the strong lensing arcs , redshifts and temperatures of the galaxy clusters are always searched out directly from online databases , such as cds ( the strasbourg astronomical data center ) or ned ( nasa / ipac extragalactic database ) .",
    "@xcite have chosen a new database established especially for x - ray galaxy clusters  bax , which provides detailed information including @xmath38 and @xmath51 .",
    "they also used the fitting results of chandra , rosat , asca satellites and vimos - ifu survey @xcite .",
    "the final statistical sample satisfy the following well - defined selection criteria .",
    "firstly , the distance between the lens and the source should be always smaller than that between the arc source and the observer , @xmath63 , which rules out half of selected lensing arcs .",
    "secondly , the arcs whose positions are too far from characteristic radius ( @xmath64 ) should also be discarded @xcite .",
    "at last @xcite obtained a sample of 10 giant arcs with all necessary parameters listed in table [ list ] .    now",
    "the observational @xmath0 data containing 80 data points for cosmological fitting are summarized in table [ list ] , with errors calculated with error propagation equation .",

    "in the first case , we consider @xmath32 as a free parameter and show the constraint results with the full @xmath65 and the restricted @xmath62 two - image galaxy lenses in fig .",
    "[ l1 ] and fig .",
    "[ w1 ] . in order to derive the probability distribution function for the cosmological parameters of interest , we marginalize @xmath32 through eq . [ [ lp ] ] and perform fits of different cosmological scenarios on the full @xmath3 sample as well as the restricted @xmath4 sample with the results displayed in table  [ result ] .    for the full @xmath3 sample ( containing 70 galaxy lenses and 10 strong lensing arcs ) ,",
    "first , in @xmath1cdm model where @xmath8 is the only free parameter we were able to make a reliable fit on the samples considered . this result is a considerable improvement over @xcite , where the authors failed to constrain @xmath8 with their sample of twenty einstein rings .",
    "let us compare our results with previously known ones .",
    "the current best fit value from cosmological observations is : @xmath68 in the flat case @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xcite gave the best - fit parameter @xmath69 for the flat @xmath1cdm model from the wmap5 results with the bao and sne ia union data .",
    "we find that our value of @xmath8 ( see table 2 ) obtained from the @xmath0 data is consistent with the previous works at @xmath70 .",
    "secondly , the best fit for the @xmath2cdm parameter agrees with that inferred from sne ia or wmap5 , and the @xmath1cdm model ( @xmath71 ) still falls within the 1@xmath18 interval from the @xmath0 sample .",
    "hence the agreement is quite good .",
    "thirdly , concerning the evolving equation of state in the cpl parametrization , confidence regions in the ( @xmath72,@xmath67 ) plane are shown in fig .",
    "one can see that fits for @xmath72 and @xmath67 are greatly improved as compared with those of @xcite .",
    "the values inferred are also in agreement with the wmap5 results presented in @xcite including combined wmap5 , bao and sne ia analysis .",
    "moreover , it can be seen that the concordance model ( @xmath1cdm ) is still included at 1@xmath18 level for the @xmath0 data applied here . for comparison",
    "we also plot the likelihood contours with the union2 sne ia compilation @xcite .",
    "one can see that the @xmath2 coefficients obtained from the @xmath0 sample agrees with the respective values derived from supernovae data ( almost the whole 2@xmath18 confidence interval for @xmath2 from the union2 data set lies within the 2@xmath18 ci from the @xmath0 data ) , which demonstrates the compatibility between the sne ia and @xmath0 data .",
    "this is also a great improvement over @xcite , where sne ia results and strong lensing results were found marginally inconsistent at 2@xmath18 .",
    "working on the restricted @xmath4 sample ( containing 36 two - image lenses and 10 strong lensing arcs ) , despite the sample size has decreased dramatically , we find that fits on @xmath8 in @xmath1cdm model are consistent with the standard knowledge ( see fig .",
    "[ l ] ) and the best fit for the @xmath2 parameter in quintessence scenario is higher than inferred from sne ia or wmap5 ( see fig .",
    "moreover , for the fits on @xmath72 and @xmath67 in cpl parametrization , even though confidence regions get larger in fig .",
    "[ cpl ] , the result also turns out to agree with sne ia fits .",
    "one should also note , that a systematic shift downwards in the ( @xmath72,@xmath67 ) plane persists .",
    "such a shift in best - fitting parameters inferred from supernovae ( standard candles , sensitive to luminosity distance ) and bao ( standard rulers , sensitive to angular diameter distance ) has already been noticed and discussed in @xcite .",
    "our result suggests the need for taking a closer look at the compatibility of results derived by using angular diameter distances and luminosity distances , respectively .",
    "recent discussions on the ideas of testing the etherington reciprocity relation between these two distances can be found in @xcite .    in conclusion",
    "our results demonstrate that the method extensively investigated in @xcite on simulated and observational data can practically be used to constrain cosmological models .",
    "moreover , good quality measurements of the relevant observational qualities such as the velocity dispersion and einstein radius turn out to be crucial .",
    "finally , four important effects , neglected here , should be mentioned .",
    "one is that both the einstein rings and x - ray observations of our new lensing sample come from different surveys or satellites ( slacs , lsd and sbas and chandra , rosat and asca , respectively ) , the differences in detectors and observing strategies may cause systematical errors which are hard to estimate .",
    "the second is that the observed image separation is affected by secondary lenses ( satellites , nearby galaxies , groups , etc ) in many cases . in this case , those lenses should not be used or the true @xmath17 corresponding to @xmath19 should be estimated through realistic modelling .",
    "however , most of our samples come from the slacs survey where the role of environment has been assessed in @xcite . namely , it was found that for slacs lenses the typical contribution from external mass distribution is no more than a few percent .",
    "the third important effect is , that the statistical procedure for cluster lenses relies on many simplifying assumptions .",
    "the realistic errors should be estimated by more realistic model of galaxy clusters besides the hydrostatic isothermal spherical symmetric @xmath38-model.the last one is the influence of line - of - sight mass contamination , with the significant effect of the large - scale structure on strong lensing @xcite .",
    "more recent results on this issue can be found in @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "large scale structure effects which change the typical separation between images are also included in the parameter @xmath32 - an increase of an arbitrary order @xmath73 in the velocity dispersion is equivalent to an increase of @xmath22 in the typical separation @xmath74 ( i.e. , @xmath75 ) @xcite . in order to be complete with the discussion of possible errors",
    "one should also notice that the redshifts @xmath76 and @xmath77 are also known with some accuracy @xmath78 and @xmath79 which propagates into theoretical distance ratio calculations . in principle one",
    "should have accounted for them by suitable numerical simulations .",
    "however , based on the experience gained on snia @xcite , this effect is likely to be much smaller than systematic errors discussed above .",
    "another straightforward solution based on poissonian statistics suggests that a sample size of order of a few hundred lenses might reduce the line - of - sight noise contamination down to a few percent @xcite .",
    "however , our @xmath0 data set is really small , and its range of redshift is also limited . fortunately , with the ongoing of various systematic gravitational surveys and more giant arc survey projects carried out by the international x - ray observatory ( ixo ) @xcite , extended roentgen survey with an imaging telescope array ( erosita ) @xcite and the wide field x - ray telescope ( wfxt ) @xcite being under way , the sample of strong lenses is growing rapidly , which may ease the problem of line - of - sight contamination .",
    "future observations will definitely enlarge our set and make the method applied in this paper more powerful .",

    "<S> strong lensing has developed into an important astrophysical tool for probing both cosmology and galaxies ( their structure , formation , and evolution ) . using the gravitational lensing theory and cluster mass distribution model </S>",
    "<S> , we try to collect a relatively complete observational data concerning the hubble constant independent ratio between two angular diameter distances @xmath0 from various large systematic gravitational lens surveys and lensing by galaxy clusters combined with x - ray observations , and check the possibility to use it in the future as complementary to other cosmological probes . </S>",
    "<S> on one hand , strongly gravitationally lensed quasar - galaxy systems create such a new opportunity by combining stellar kinematics ( central velocity dispersion measurements ) with lensing geometry ( einstein radius determination from position of images ) . </S>",
    "<S> we apply such a method to a combined gravitational lens data set including 70 data points from sloan lens acs ( slacs ) and lens structure and dynamics survey ( lsd ) . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> a new sample of 10 lensing galaxy clusters with redshifts ranging from 0.1 to 0.6 carefully selected from strong gravitational lensing systems with both x - ray satellite observations and optical giant luminous arcs , is also used to constrain three dark energy models ( @xmath1cdm , constant @xmath2 and cpl ) under a flat universe assumption . for the full sample ( @xmath3 ) and the restricted sample ( @xmath4 ) including 36 two - image lenses and 10 strong lensing arcs , we obtain relatively good fitting values of basic cosmological parameters , which generally agree with the results already known in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> this results encourages further development of this method and its use on larger samples obtained in the future . </S>"
