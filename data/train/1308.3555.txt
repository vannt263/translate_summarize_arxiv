    "in the past three decades , many theoretical efforts have been devoted to reveal and investigate the rich and novel phenomena in the photodetachment spectra of negative ions in external fields , among which the closed - orbit theory developed around 1987@xcite supplies a general semiclassical picture for the external - field effects ( note that a similar idea can also be found in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "other more accurate but much more complicated considerations have been made which also have achieved great success@xcite .",
    "both the predicted oscillatory structures above threshold and the quantum tunneling effect below threshold have been observed clearly in the related experiments@xcite .",
    "very recently , based on our previous studies on the photodetachment of negative ion in an external field , and stimulated by an experiment of the washington group @xcite where they reported the observed angle - resolved photoelectron spectra from doubly charged anions having the structure of a linear chain , @xmath1 ( with @xmath2 ) , we analyzed in detail the spatial interference structures on a screen for a theoretical model of negative - ion photodetachment near a repulsive center@xcite . in this case",
    ", a unique closed orbit can be found on the line between the electron source and the repulsive - force center .    in the present paper ,",
    "we use a well - established h@xmath0 model to investigate the effect in the photodetachment spectra induced by this returning closed orbit .",
    "after briefly depicting the theoretical model and the electron - wave propagation after detachment in sec .",
    ", we first use the standard closed - orbit theory@xcite to obtain a formula for the oscillatory structure in the photodetachment spectra above the zero - field threshold",
    ". then we extend it naturally to the energy range below the zero - field threshold by introducing a `` uniform approximation '' ( sec . ) .",
    "to understand the oscillations of the photodetachment spectra better , a comparison with the photodetachment spectra in a homogeneous electric field is made in sec . .",
    "a brief conclusion is given in sec .. atomic units are used throughout this work unless specified otherwise .",
    "here , we set the detached - electron source to be the origin of coordinate frame , and the @xmath3-axis is along the direction from the repulsive - force center to the electron source ( fig .",
    "1 ) . to distinguish the new frame from the previous one in ref.@xcite",
    ", we use a prime to denote the coordinates ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) relative to the repulsive center .",
    "the zero - field photodetachment of h@xmath0 has been well established in the literature@xcite .",
    "here we only sketch the theoretical model briefly . initially the electron is loosely bound by a short range potential and the initial bound state can be written as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a normalization constant and @xmath8 with the binding energy @xmath9 .",
    "after irradiation by laser light linearly polarized along the @xmath3-direction , the generated directly - outgoing wave is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the initial ejection angle of the photodetached electron , and @xmath12 with @xmath13 denoting the initial kinetic energy .",
    "@xmath14 satisfies @xmath15 .",
    "actually , one can find the following calculation is independent of such a surface @xmath16 .",
    "after being detached from the loosely bound initial state , the detached - electron motion is governed by the following hamiltonian @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the distance between the wave source and the repulsive center , and @xmath19 denotes the negative - charge number at the force center .",
    "the classical trajectory analysis for the present model has been presented in our previous work@xcite , from which one can immediately find a unique closed orbit lying on the line between electron source and the repulsive - force center ( see fig . 2 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "all the photoelectron wave propagates away from the source region to infinity except a small part of the outgoing wave that returns to the source region along the closed orbit .",
    "semiclassical propagation of the detached - electron wave along the closed orbit gives the returning wave as , @xmath20 where the maslov index @xmath21 equals one as this closed orbit touches a caustic surface just once at the turning point ; @xmath22 and @xmath23 are , respectively , the semiclassical amplitude and the accumulated phase ( action variation ) of an associated wave propagating along the closed orbit .",
    "when the detached - electron wave comes back to the source after semiclassical propagation along closed orbit , from eqs.(23 ) and ( 26 ) in ref.@xcite , we get the following expression for the semiclassical amplitude , @xmath24 with , @xmath25 where @xmath14 is an initial spherical surface around the source , and @xmath26 is the defined scaled energy as before .",
    "hence , we get the amplitude for the returning wave as , @xmath27      the returning wave propagating along the closed orbit can be obtained by substituting the above eqs.(2 ) , ( 7 ) and ( 10 ) into eq.(4 ) .",
    "then , after a further connecting procedure on a bound surface @xmath14 as usual@xcite , we get the returning wave near the wave source as , @xmath33~.\\ ] ] the returning wave in eq.(11 ) will overlap and interfere with the wave source , and oscillatory structures will be observed in the total photodetachment cross section described quantitatively in the next section .",
    "in this section , we use the standard procedure of the closed - orbit theory to derive a cross section formula above the zero - field threshold , and then we extend the obtained expression to a uniform one which is applicable for the energy range very close to the zero - field threshold and even below threshold .      according the closed - orbit theory@xcite , the oscillatory term in the photodetachment spectra contributed by the closed orbit is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes the absorbed photon energy ; @xmath36 and @xmath37 denote the light speed and the dipole operator , respectively .    by using the dipole operator ( here , @xmath38 ) , the initial bound state in eq.(1 ) and the returning wave in eq.(11 ) , the integration in eq.(12 ) can be written out as , @xmath39\\int^\\infty_0dr\\big[r^2e^{-k_br}\\int^{1}_{-1}\\tau e^{ikr\\tau }      d\\tau\\big]~,\\ ] ] where , @xmath40 . and the integration in eq.(13 ) can be worked out straightforward as @xmath41=\\frac{4ki}{(k_b^2+k^2)^2}~.\\ ] ]    from the above eqs.(12)-(14 ) , the oscillatory term induced by the closed orbit can be obtained as @xmath42 combining the smooth background without any external field@xcite , the total photodetachment cross section for the simple h@xmath0 model near a repulsive coulomb center can be written out completely as , @xmath43 where we substituted @xmath22 by eq.(7 ) .      very close to the zero - field threshold ,",
    "the cross - section expression in eq.(16 ) is not appropriate .",
    "besides , slightly below the zero - field threshold , the loosely - bound electron can also tunnel out through the repulsive potential , for which a consistent formula is also needed .",
    "first , we transform the formula in eq.(16 ) into a product of the zero - field cross section and a field - induced modulation function as following @xmath44 and separate the modulation function into @xmath45 where @xmath46 using the semiclassical amplitude in eq.(7 ) and the action variation in eq.(10 ) , the following limiting behavior can be found when the zero - field threshold is approached : @xmath47=1~.\\ ] ] hence in the modulation function only the first part @xmath48 will survive .",
    "as the photon energy is approaching the zero - field threshold , the closed orbit mentioned above will be shorter and shorter , and the pencil of the detached - electron wave propagating near this closed orbit will be mainly affected by the repulsive potential very close to the wave source .",
    "therefore , given that the spatial gradient of repulsive potential is proportional to @xmath49 , a linear approximation is possible for the repulsive potential very close to the zero - field threshold , and the limiting behavior of the surviving modulation function @xmath48 should be similar with that induced by a uniform electric field .    by carefully examining the photodetachment process in a uniform electric field , we find the amplitude @xmath50 and the action phase @xmath51 along closed orbit has a very simple but interesting relation , @xmath52 once substituting the above equation into eq.(18 ) , one can immediately find that the modulation function @xmath53 becomes identical to @xmath48 in this limit . on the other hand , for the photodetachment of negative ion in a uniform electric field , several quantum cross - section expressions have been obtained by fabrikant et .",
    "al.@xcite , and an completely analytic @xmath54-source model has also been well established by bracher et .",
    "al using a quantum - source theory@xcite , from which an exact form of the modulation function can be abstracted .",
    "accordingly , based on the above considerations , we replace @xmath55 by an exact form of the modulation function @xmath56 in the uniform - field case but with a different action variation @xmath23 , which we call `` uniform approximation '' . by this",
    "the modulation function in eq.(18 ) can be extended as @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a _ real variable _ defined as @xmath59 and @xmath60~.\\ ] ] for the uniform modulation function in eq.(22 ) , the second part in eq.(18 ) has also been uniformized using the airy function and its derivative , similar to what we did in ref . @xcite .      in fig.2",
    ", we display the behavior of the photodetachment spectra for h@xmath0 near a repulsive center using a representative case with @xmath66 and @xmath67 , where both the oscillatory structure above the zero - field threshold and the quantum tunneling effect below threshold can be observed clearly . an exact quantum calculation based on the coulomb green s function",
    "is also displayed in fig.2 , which confirms the accuracy of the present formula .",
    "the exact quantum treatment will be presented in a separate paper@xcite .",
    "finally we discuss the shift of photo - electron threshold caused by the repulsive center . according to the modulation function in eq.(22 ) , the action value in eq.(28 ) indicates that the photodetachment cross section vanishes completely once the scaled energy @xmath68 is smaller than minus one .",
    "therefore , the present theory suggests that , as a result of the presence of the repulsive center , the photo - electron threshold is actually shifted to a lower value ( @xmath69 ) relative to the zero - field photodetachment threshold .",
    "this theoretical result is consistent with the observations reported by the washington group in their experiments@xcite .",
    "by comparing the cross - section formula in eq.(16 ) with that in a uniform electric field@xcite , an interesting phenomenon can be observed : _ the modulation amplitude in the photodetachment spectra induced by a nearby repulsive center is identical to that induced by an effective uniform static field strength of @xmath70 _ , though the phase is different .",
    "the equivalence of oscillatory amplitudes in the total cross section might be a surprise at first glance , because the differential cross sections are completely different in ref.@xcite . to examine this further , we compare in fig.3 the total cross section for the photodetachment of hydrogen negative ion near a repulsive center with that in a uniform electric field .",
    "indeed , we can observe the same magnitude of the oscillations for the two different systems , and the physical reason can be found in the following .    given the generality of the derivation presented in this work , the formulas in eqs.(15 ) , ( 17 ) and ( 22 ) also represent the oscillatory behavior of the photodetachment spectra in a uniform electric field but with amplitude @xmath50 and phase @xmath51 for the returning wave along the closed orbit .",
    "therefore , to compare the two systems , we examine the related quantities in the photodetachment spectra which are , respectively , @xmath22 and @xmath23 for the photodetachment near a repulsive center and @xmath50 and @xmath51 for the photodetachment in a homogeneous electric field .",
    "let us first examine the phase .",
    "for photodetachment in a uniform field @xmath71 , the modulation phase can be worked out as , @xmath72 which is compared in fig.4(a ) with the phase @xmath23 in eqs .",
    "( 10 ) and ( 27 ) by using @xmath73 and @xmath74 for example . actually , from eq.(29 )",
    "one can find the ratio of @xmath23 to @xmath51 depends only on the scaled energy ( fig.4(b ) ) .",
    "in fig.4 we can find that only close enough to the threshold energy , the two phases are approximately equal ; as the energy increases from the zero - field threshold , the ratio monotonically decreases from unity . at any scaled energy above threshold ,",
    "the phase accumulation along the closed orbit in a repulsive force field is always smaller than that in the corresponding uniform static field .",
    "both the above two points are revealed clearly in fig.3 .    for the amplitudes @xmath22 and @xmath50 , one can easily find the following relationship @xmath75 which suggests the following two points .",
    "( 1 ) the ratio of @xmath23 to @xmath51 displayed in fig.4(b ) is also the ratio of @xmath76 to @xmath77 for the photodetachment near a repulsive center , which measures the contribution of the second part in eq.(22 ) when the photon energy is away from the zero - field threshold .",
    "( 2 ) the amplitude @xmath22 for the photodetachment near a repulsive center is exactly equal to the amplitude @xmath50 for the photodetachment in a homogeneous electric field , which is the reason why the oscillation amplitude of the photodetachment spectra in fig.3 is identical .    to see this more clearly from a dynamical view",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "5 a pencil of trajectories propagating alongside the closed orbit .",
    "the paths with turning points near @xmath78 ( red online ) are for a repulsive coulomb field , while those with turning points near @xmath79 ( green online ) are for the corresponding constant electric field . when the trajectories go out and then back to the dashed curve ( blue online ) , each `` red '' curve going out from the source at angle @xmath11 crosses the `` green '' curve that went out at that same angle .",
    "therefore the flux densities through surfaces perpendicular to the trajectories must be equal , and those surfaces coincide at the source .",
    "based on the preceding work@xcite , we have explored the total photodetachment cross section near a repulsive center by using a well - established h@xmath0 model . using the standard procedure in the closed - orbit theory",
    ", we derived a cross - section formula for the oscillatory structures in the photodetachment spectra above the zero - field threshold .",
    "and then , by introducing a `` uniform approximation '' , the cross - section expression has been extended to a uniform formula which is applicable for the energy range below the zero - field threshold . by comparing with the familiar case of photodetachment in a homogeneous electric field",
    ", we find the oscillatory amplitudes for the two different systems are identical , and the ratio of their oscillatory phase is only dependent on a scaled energy .",
