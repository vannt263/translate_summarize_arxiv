    "the ( small ) differential deflection of light rays by intervening structures allows us to study the projected mass distribution of the deflectors , without having to rely on assumptions about the state or nature of the deflecting matter . the first attempt to detect this effect , called weak gravitational lensing ,",
    "was made by tyson et al .",
    "( 1984 ) , who tried to measure the signal induced by an ensemble of galaxies .",
    "this area of astronomy blossomed with the successful measurements of the signal induced by rich clusters of galaxies at intermediate redshifts ( e.g. , tyson , wenk , & valdes 1990 ; bonnet , mellier , & fort 1994 ; fahlman et al .",
    "1994 ; squires et al . 1996",
    "; luppino & kaiser 1997 ; hoekstra et al . 1998 ; for an extensive review see mellier 1999 ) .",
    "these studies of rich clusters were an important first step in demonstrating the feasibility of weak lensing analyses , but nowadays more and more studies concentrate on blank fields .",
    "for example , galaxy groups have masses intermediate between clusters of galaxies and galaxies .",
    "hoekstra et al .",
    "( 2001 ) measured the ensemble averaged weak lensing signal from a sample of 50 groups identified by carlberg et al .",
    "( 2001 ) in the canadian network for observational cosmology field galaxy redshift survey ( cnoc2 ) .",
    "other applications of wide field lensing are the measurement of the lensing signal caused by large scale structure ( bacon et al . 2000,2002 ; hoekstra et al .",
    "2002a , 2002b ; kaiser , wilson , & luppino 2000 ; refregier et al .",
    "2002 ; van waerbeke et al .",
    "2000 , 2001 , 2002 ; wittman et al .",
    "2000 ) , and the study of galaxy biasing ( hoekstra , yee & gladders 2001b ; hoekstra et al .",
    "another important application is the study of the dark matter halos of field galaxies ( e.g. , brainerd , blandford , & smail 1996 ; griffiths et al . 1996 ; dellantonio & tyson 1996 ; hudson et al . 1998",
    "; fischer et al .",

    "rotation curves of spiral galaxies have provided important evidence for the existence of dark matter halos ( e.g. , van albada & sancisi 1986 ) .",
    "also strong lensing studies of multiple imaged systems require massive halos to explain the oberved image separations .",
    "however , both methods provide mainly constraints on the halo properties at relatively small radii .",
    "the weak lensing signal can be measured out to large projected distances , and in principle it can be a powerful probe of the potential at large radii , constraining the extent of the dark matter halos ( e.g. , brainerd et al .",
    "1996 , hudson et al . 1998 ; fischer et al .",
    "2000 ) . only satellite galaxies ( e.g. , zaritsky & white 1994 ) provide another way to probe the outskirts of isolated galaxy halos .",
    "the lensing signal induced by an individual galaxy is too low to be detected , and one has to study the ensemble averaged signal around a large number of lenses .",
    "redshifts for the individual galaxies are useful , because they allow a proper scaling of the lensing signal around the galaxies , and they are necessary for studies of the evolution of the mass - to - light ratio of field galaxies from lensing .",
    "hudson et al . ( 1998 ) were the first to make use of ( photometric ) redshifts in their galaxy - galaxy lensing analysis of the northern hubble deep field .",
    "unfortunately , the small area covered by the hdf limited the accuracy of their results .",
    "the analysis of commissioning data of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) by fischer et al .",
    "( 2000 ) was a major step forward .",
    "fischer et al .",
    "( 2000 ) detected a very significant lensing signal , demonstrating the importance of the survey for the study of galaxy halos .",
    "more recently , mckay et al . ( 2001 ) used the available redshift information from the sdss to study the galaxy - galaxy lensing signal as a function of galaxy properties .",
    "we obtained deep @xmath10-band imaging data for two fields that have been studied as part of the cnoc2 field galaxy redshift survey ( e.g. , yee et al .",
    "earlier results on groups of galaxies , based on these data , were presented by hoekstra et al .",
    "( 2001a ) . in this paper",
    ", we use the data to study the galaxy - galaxy lensing signal of three overlapping samples of galaxies ( one with , and two without redshift information ) .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section  2",
    "we present the observations and data reduction . in this section",
    "we also describe in detail the object analysis and the corrections for the various observational distortions . in section  3",
    "we discuss the redshift distribution of the sources we use in this study .",
    "we investigate the lensing by large scale structure in section  4 .",
    "the analysis of the galaxy - galaxy lensing signal is presented in section  5 . in section  6",
    "we present our estimates of the field mass - to - light ratio for different halo models . throughout the paper we take @xmath11 km / s / mpc , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 , although the results do not depend critically on the adopted cosmology .",
    "the canadian network for observational cosmology field galaxy redshift survey ( cnoc2 ) targeted four widely separated patches on the sky to study the field population of galaxies in the universe .",
    "redshifts of @xmath14 galaxies with a nominal limit of @xmath15 were measured , resulting in a large sample of galaxies at intermediate redshifts @xmath16 .",
    "a detailed description of the survey , and the corresponding data reduction is given in yee et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . in this paper",
    "we study the dark matter properties of the galaxies targeted by cnoc2 , and to this end we make extensive use of the redshifts and multi - colour photometry obtained by the cnoc2 survey .",
    "we observed the central parts of the two cnoc2 patches 1447 + 09 and 2148 - 05 ( yee et al .",
    "2002 , in preparation ) using the 4.2 m william herschel telescope ( wht ) at la palma .",
    "the images were taken using the prime focus camera , equipped with a thinned @xmath17 pixels eev10 chip , with a pixel scale of 0 pixel@xmath18 .",
    "the resulting field of view of the camera is approximately 8 by 16 .",
    "the patches observed in the cnoc2 survey are much larger than the field of view of the wht prime focus camera , and we observed a mosaic of 6 pointings .",
    "table  [ fields ] lists the central positions of the observed fields as well as the dates of the observations .",
    "the typical integration time per pointing is one hour in @xmath10 ( see table  [ info ] ) .",
    ".positions of the centres of the fields used for the weak lensing analysis .",
    "the last column gives the dates of the observations .",
    "[ fields ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     to estimate the luminosity density of the universe we use the results from lin et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , which are also based on the cnoc2 survey .",
    "we convolve the redshift distribution of the galaxies with the redshift dependent luminosity density from lin et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , which yields @xmath19 .",
    "we use this result , and our estimates for the average field mass - to - light ratio at @xmath20 to derive the corresponding values of @xmath8 , which are listed in column  6 of table  [ omegatab ] .    with the current data ,",
    "the statistical error in the value of @xmath8 is large .",
    "in addition , the uncertainty in the scaling relation of @xmath3 limits the determination of @xmath8 through this technique .",
    "we also assumed that all matter in the universe is associated with the galaxy dark matter halos .",
    "the lensing signal is not changed by adding a sheet of constant surface density ( gorenstein , shapiro , & falco 1988 ) .",
    "thus a uniformly distributed form of dark matter can not be detected in our analysis .",
    "consequently , our estimate for @xmath8 should be interpreted as a lower limit .",
    "another approach is to use independent measurements of @xmath8 ( e.g. , from cmb or cosmic shear studies ) to constrain the scaling relation for @xmath3 .",
    "we observed two blank fields of approximately 30 by 23 arcminutes using the william herschel telescope .",
    "the fields were studied as part of the canadian network for observational cosmology field galaxy redshift survey ( cnoc2 ) ( e.g. , yee et al .",
    "2000 ; carlberg et al . 2001 ) , and spectroscopic redshifts are available for 1125 galaxies in the two fields .",
    "earlier results on groups of galaxies , based on these data , were presented by hoekstra et al .",
    "( 2000a ) .",
    "we have measured the lensing signal caused by large scale structure .",
    "we observed signal is low , and consistent with more accurate measurements from much larger surveys ( e.g. , bacon et al .",
    "2002 ; hoekstra et al .",
    "2002a , b ; refregier et al . 2002",
    "; van waerbeke et al . 2002 ) .",
    "we examined the effect of an imperfect correction for psf anisotropy , and find the correction used here has worked well : it gives the smallest cosmic shear signal . in addition",
    "we find that the uncertainty in the correction has a negligible effect on the galaxy - galaxy lensing results .",
    "we have studied the ensemble averaged tangential distortion ( galaxy - mass correlation function ) around three subsamples of lenses . in all three cases",
    "a clear lensing signal is detected .",
    "we relate the lensing signal to an estimate of the velocity dispersion of an  galaxy , and find that the results for the three samples agree well with each other . for the sample of galaxies with redshifts from the cnoc2 survey we derive @xmath0 km / s ( or @xmath1 km / s ) .",
    "note , however , that this measurement is slightly biased , because of the clustering of the lenses .",
    "to study the properties of the dark matter halos surrounding the lens galaxies , we used a maximum likelihood analysis .",
    "this technique allowed us to derive constraints on both the velocity dispersion and the extent of the dark matter halos ( it naturally accounts for the clustering of the lenses ) .",
    "the value of the truncation parameter @xmath3 depends strongly on the assumed scaling relation , but the velocity dispersion is well constrained .",
    "galaxy groups can complicate the interpretation of the truncation parameter @xmath3 .",
    "we examined how galaxy groups affect our results , and we find that their effect is relatively small .",
    "our data are not sufficient for a detailed study , but the full cnoc2 data set can be useful to this end , as well as studies of numerical simulations .    under the assumption that all galaxies have the same total mass - to - light ratio , we find a value of @xmath2 km / s ( 68% confidence , marginalised over the truncation parameter @xmath3 ) for the velocity dispersion of an  galaxy . for the truncation parameter",
    "we obtain @xmath4 kpc ( 68% confidence , marginalised over @xmath5 ) , with a 99.7% confidence lower limit of @xmath6 kpc , and a 95% confidence upper limit of @xmath7 kpc . for this model",
    "we find that the average field mass - to - light ratio at @xmath21 is @xmath22 , comparable to what is found for rich clusters of galaxies ( carlberg et al . 1997 ) and galaxy groups ( hoekstra et al .",
    "2001a ) .",
    "the field mass - to - light ratio provides an estimate of @xmath8 , the matter density of the universe .",
    "the results from the weak lensing analysis provide a lower limit on @xmath8 , because lensing can not detect dark matter that is distributed uniformly through the universe .",
    "unfortunately , our estimate of the field mass - to - light ratio , and consequently the derived value of @xmath8 , depends strongly on the assumed scaling of @xmath3 .",
    "the results presented here demonstrate that weak lensing is a powerful tool to study the dark matter halos of field galaxies , as it can probe the mass distribution out to large projected distances .",
    "in this paper we have used approximately one quarter of the cnoc2 survey .",
    "an analysis of the full survey will improve the accuracy of the results by a factor @xmath23 .",
    "furthermore , many large imaging surveys are currently underway .",
    "first results from the red - sequence cluster survey ( rcs ) indicate that these surveys can provide accurate constraints on the dark matter halos of field galaxies ( e.g. , hoekstra et al .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank the members of the canadian network for observational cosmology without whom this project would never have been possible .",
    "we thank jocelyn bzecourt for his help to obtain part of the imaging data .",
