    "sn 2011fe / ptf11kly was discovered in the nearby spiral galaxy m101 by the palomar transient factory on august 24.167 , 2011 ( ut dates are used throughout this paper ) , and it was classified as a normal type ia supernova ( sn  ia ; nugent et al .",
    "sn 2011fe is one of the nearest type ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) discovered over the past three decades , with a cepheid - based distance of about 6.4 @xmath10 0.5 mpc ( @xmath11 mag ; shappee & stanek 2011 ) .",

    "thus , the discovery of this object provides a rare opportunity to study the properties of a normal sn  ia at both very early and very late phases .",
    "there are two competing scenarios for the progenitors of sne  ia .",
    "one is a system consisting of a single white dwarf ( wd ) and a nondegenerate companion ( whelan & iben 1973 ) ; the other is a system consisting of two wds ( iben & tutukov 1984 ) . the fact that these explosions are linked to their birth environments suggests that sne  ia may arise from multiple classes of binary evolution ( e.g. , wang et al .",
    "the early discovery of sn 2011fe leads to tight constraints on the nature of the progenitor of this particular sn  ia .",

    "details of the light curves are described in the following subsections .",
    "a polynomial fit to the near - maximum light curves reveals that sn 2011fe reached a @xmath6-band maximum of @xmath29 mag on jd 2,455,814.98 @xmath10 0.03 and a @xmath30-band maximum of @xmath31 mag on jd 2,455,816.92@xmath100.03 , very close to @xmath32 mag on jd 2,455,815.01@xmath100.06 and @xmath33 mag on jd 2,455,816.75 @xmath10 0.06 as given by pereira et al .",

    "pereira et al . (",

    "it is readily seen that the light curves of our comparison samples are similar around maximum light , except for sn 2003hv which exhibits a faster decline .",
    "closer inspection reveals a faster rise in all bands for sn 2011fe compared with sn 2011by , although these two sne  ia have similar values of @xmath7 .",
    "figure 4 shows comparisons of the late - time light curves over the period from t @xmath52 + 70 days to @xmath53 + 500 days relative to @xmath6-band maximum .",
    "one can see that large differences emerge in the @xmath5 band ; sn 2011fe declined more rapidly than sn 2003du and even the fast decliner sn 2003hv .",
    "past about 70 days after maximum light , the @xmath5-band decay rate of sn 2011fe is estimated to be @xmath54 mag ( 100 days)@xmath17 , while the corresponding decline rates are @xmath55 mag ( 100 days)@xmath17 for sn 2003du ( stanishev et al . 2007 ) and @xmath56 mag ( 100 days)@xmath17 for sn 2003hv ( leloudas et al . 2009 ) at comparable phases .",
    "although sn 2003du has small @xmath57(b ) , sn 2011fe still has a much faster decay rate compared to sn 2003hv .",
    "the faster decay shown by the @xmath5-band light curve of sn 2011fe is thus likely caused by its ejecta having a relatively lower opacity in the uv ( see also discussion in  5.3 ) .",
    "another possible factor is a difference in the magnetic field , which may lead to different amounts of positron trapping .",
    "figure 5 shows the color curves of sn 2011fe , including the two uv minus @xmath30 colors ( @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) .",
    "overplotted are the color curves of sne 2003du , 2003hv , 2005cf , 2011by , and 2012cg .",
    "all of the color curves are corrected for reddening in both the milky way ( schlafly & finkbeiner 2011 ) and the host galaxies .",
    "inspection of the plot reveals that sn 2011fe has bluer @xmath59 and @xmath58 colors than the comparison sne  ia before maximum light ( by @xmath60 mag ) , consistent with its strong uv emission at early times . on the other hand , the @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 colors of sn 2011fe exhibit behaviors that are similar to those of the comparison sne at early phases .",
    "the uv and optical color curves commonly showed an initial decline after the explosion and they reached their minimum values ( i.e. , bluest colors ) around maximum light , followed by an increase toward redder colors until @xmath64 days .",
    "the subsequent evolution of the different color curves shows large scatter .",
    "the @xmath65 and @xmath66 colors become nearly constant during the period from @xmath64 days to @xmath67 days .",
    "similarly , the @xmath68 color also showed a plateau feature during this phase , which then became redder in a linear fashion thereafter . at later phases , sn 2011fe",
    "is found to be progressively redder than sn 2003du and sn 2003hv in @xmath68 , suggesting that its photospheric temperature drops more rapidly than that of sn 2003du and sn 2003hv .",
    "meanwhile , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 evolved toward bluer colors ( declined by @xmath69 mag ) during the period from @xmath64 days to @xmath70 days . at @xmath71 days ,",
    "the @xmath61 and @xmath62 colors showed a flat evolution while the @xmath63 color gradually became red again .",
    "since we have photometry of sn 2011fe in the uv , optical , and nir bands covering wavelengths of 160024,000   , we can study its spectral energy distribution ( sed ) evolution by means of photometry .",
    "a rough sed can be constructed from the observed fluxes in various passbands at the same or similar epochs .",
    "the missing data can be obtained through interpolations of the neighboring datapoints whenever necessary .",
    "the observed fluxes are corrected for the reddening of milky way and the host galaxies .",
    "figure 6 shows the seds obtained at @xmath72 , @xmath73 , + 1 , + 7 , + 16 , and + 31 days with respect to @xmath6-band maximum .",
    "one can see that the seds show a prominent deficit in the @xmath74 band at all of these epochs , explained as line blending caused by iron - peak elements ( e.g. , wang et al .",
    "the sed of sn 2011fe is found to peak in the @xmath6 band at @xmath72 days , and it then peaked in the @xmath5 band at @xmath75 days and @xmath76 days .",
    "after maximum light , the sed peak shifted quickly toward longer wavelengths .",
    "around one month after maximum light , the emission in the @xmath77 band became stronger than that in the @xmath78 band , which is likely caused by the recombination of fe  iii .",
    "compared to sn 2005cf ( see fig . 12 in wang et al .",
    "2009a ) , sn 2011fe seems to show a faster decrease in the photospheric temperature .",
    "we constructed the bolometric light curve of sn 2011fe , as listed in table 5 , and compare it with that of sn 2003du , sn 2005cf , sn 2011by , and sn 2012cg , as shown in figure 7 .",
    "owing to the lack of nir data for sn 2011by , we assume it has the same nir / optical ratio ( @xmath79 as sn 2005cf . with a peak luminosity of ( @xmath80 erg s@xmath17 , we can deduce that the synthesized nickel mass is @xmath81  m@xmath18 for sn 2011fe according to the arnett law ( arnett 1982 ; stritzinger & leibundgut 2005 ) . in figure 8 , we plot the ratio of the uv ( 16003200   ) and nir ( 900024,000   ) fluxes to the optical ( 32009000   ) for sn 2011fe and the comparison sample sn 2005cf , sn 2011by , and sn 2012cg .",

    "we noticed that the @xmath83 ratio of sn 2011fe reached its peak one week earlier than that of sn 2005cf and also slightly earlier than that of sn 2012cg , suggestive of a shorter diffusion time for its higher - energy photons .",
    "given a similar ejecta mass and expansion velocity , this difference implies that the ejecta of sn 2011fe have a lower opacity at shorter wavelengths .",

    "one can see that the spectral features at these phases are dominated by intermediate - mass elements ( imes ) like calcium , silicon , oxygen , and magnesium , while the fe  ii / fe  iii absorptions are responsible for the troughs near 4300    and 4800   .",
    "note that the fit to the @xmath90 d spectrum looks better if co  ii and ni  ii are included .",

    "at @xmath114 days , the hvf of o  i @xmath97773 is measured to have a velocity of @xmath93 km  s@xmath17 and the photospheric component has a velocity of @xmath117  km  s@xmath17 .",
    "the photospheric velocity is consistent with that from si  ii and ca  ii lines .",
    "it is interesting to note that a second hvf of o  i  @xmath97773 may appear in the earlier spectra of sn 2011fe ( see minor absorption marked by the dotted line ) , which has a velocity of @xmath118  km  s@xmath17 ( zhao et al .",
    "the presence of oxygen at such a high velocity may naturally explain the formation of ca - hvfs seen in sn 2011fe .",
    "nugent et al .",
    "( 2011 ) noticed that the o - hvf shows a rapid velocity decline from about 18,000 km s@xmath17 to 14,000 km s@xmath17 in the first two spectra ( at @xmath119  d and @xmath120  d after explosion ) , and they attributed it to geometrical dilution during the early phases .",
    "however , it is more likely that the velocity variation they measured is actually related to different components of o  i  @xmath97773 absorption . from the synapps fit as shown in figure 12 , the feature with a velocity of @xmath121 to @xmath122  km  s@xmath17 may due to the blending of mg  ii and si  ii .",
    "the feature with a velocity of @xmath123  km  s@xmath17 remains unknown to us .",
    "the rising light curves are important , as they can determine the explosion time ( nugent et al .",
    "2011 ) , constrain the radius of the exploding star itself ( piro 2010 ; bloom et al . 2012 ; piro & nakar 2013 ) , and test the scenario of luminosity evolution of sne  ia as well as other properties of their progenitor systems , such as interaction with a companion star ( kasen 2010 ) .",
    "note that there is a difference between the explosion time and the time when the sn begins to brighten ( time of first light , @xmath124 ) because of a possible dark phase immediately after the explosion ( piro & nakar 2013 ; piro & nakar 2014 ) ; thus , we use @xmath124 relative to @xmath6-band maximum in the following discussion . in the `` expanding fireball model , '' the early - time flux",
    "is thought to be @xmath125 ( riess et al .",
    "1999 ; conley et al .",
    "2006 ) . assuming a more general form of the fireball model such as @xmath126 , a recent study using 18 sne  ia yields a mean ( but without stretch correction ) rise time of @xmath127 d and a mean index of @xmath128 ( firth et al .",
    "some modified models , such as a broken power law , are also proposed for the luminosity evolution of sne  ia ( e.g. , zheng et al . 2013 ) .    for sn 2011fe , nugent et al .",
    "( 2011 ) obtained a @xmath124 of mjd @xmath129 ( @xmath130 ) and @xmath131 @xmath132 .",
    "brown et al . (",
    "2012 ) estimated @xmath124 ranging from mjd 55796.62 to mjd 55797.07 in different bands , using the earliest data from @xmath14 uvot observations . with a bolometric light curve , pereira et al .",
    "( 2013 ) derived @xmath124 as @xmath133 for @xmath130 evolution and @xmath134 for @xmath2 , and @xmath135 .",
    "our extensive photometric data for sn 2011fe , starting within 1 day after the explosion , also enable better constraints on its luminosity evolution and first - light time .",
    "using the observed data at @xmath136 days and assuming a model of @xmath126 for the rising light curves , we find that the rising rate of the emission flux differs from @xmath130 evolution in all bands except @xmath30 and @xmath28 , where the flux rises in a manner close to @xmath130 evolution ( i.e. , n = 2.27 and 2.33 ) . residuals of the fits are shown in the bottom panels of figure 16 , and the best - fit results are listed in table 6 . from the @xmath137 fit , we found that the first - light time ranges from @xmath138 days ( @xmath5 band ) to @xmath139 days ( @xmath30 band ) , while the corresponding time estimated with the @xmath2 model spans from @xmath140 days ( @xmath28 band ) to @xmath141 days ( @xmath5 band ) . in light of the goodness of the fit",
    ", one may conclude that the rising light curve of sn 2011fe differs from the @xmath130 evolution , especially in the @xmath5 and @xmath6 bands where a faster rise ( and hence a larger index , @xmath142 ) is needed for a better fit , or the first - light times obtained in the @xmath143 bands are smaller than those in the @xmath4 bands .    in principle ,",
    "the first - light time ( or explosion time ) derived from different bands should have the same value , but this is not the case either for the @xmath137 fit or for the @xmath144 fit to the data .",
    "we thus refit the multi - band light curves of sn 2011fe simultaneously by forcing all the light curves to have the same @xmath124 . for the @xmath130 model",
    ", the combined fit gives @xmath145 ( mjd 55796.89 @xmath10 0.01 ) by using the data at @xmath136 d , while for the @xmath144 model , the combined fit gives @xmath146 ( mjd 55796.30 @xmath10 0.29 ) , with @xmath3 ranging from 2.25 ( in the @xmath30 band ) to 2.63 ( in the @xmath5 band ) .",
    "we noticed that the @xmath147 for the @xmath5-band data is much larger than that for other bands , so we refit the data by restricting only to the @xmath19 bands .",
    "we obtained @xmath148 ( mjd 55796.84 @xmath10 0.01 ) for the @xmath130 model , and @xmath149 ( mjd 55796.48 @xmath10 0.16 ) for the @xmath144 model , with @xmath3 ranging from 2.14 ( in the @xmath30 band ) to 2.43 ( in the @xmath6 band ) .",
    "the detailed results are shown in the right panels of figure 16 and reported in table 6 .",
    "again , one can see that the indeces @xmath150 and @xmath151 are larger than the values obtained for the @xmath4 bands ( which are closee to 2 ) .    for comparison , we overplot the @xmath26-band fluxes of some sne  ia with very early - time observations in the right panel of figure 16 , such as sn 2009ig ( foley et al .",
    "2012 ) , sn 2012cg ( marion et al .",
    "2015 ) , sn 2013dy ( zheng et al .",
    "2013 ) , and asassn-14lp ( shappee et al . 2015 ) , with the peak flux of each sn normalized to that of sn 2011fe .",
    "one can see that all of these comparison sne  ia clearly exhibit slower rises at early times , while they also have smaller @xmath7 than sn 2011fe .",
    "however , comparison of the @xmath7-corrected rise times between different sne  ia may not make much sense , given that the duration of the very early light curve does not correlate with the light - curve shape and the @xmath3 index shows a large range for the @xmath144 evolution of different sne  ia ( firth et al . 2015 ) .",
    "moreover , sn 2009ig and asassn-14lp have large photospheric velocities around the time of maximum light ( e.g. , @xmath152 km s@xmath17 ) , and these rapidly expanding sne  ia usually have shorter rise times compared to their normal counterparts ( zhang et al . 2010 ; ganeshalingam et al .",
    "2011 ) ; also , the early light curve of sn 2012cg may be affected by interaction with the companion star ( marion et al .",
    "2015 ) . on the other hand , since sn 2011by is considered to be a `` twin '' of sn 2011fe ( graham et al .",
    "2015b ) , it is interesting to include it in figure 16 even though its light curve does not cover the very early phases .",
    "as can be seen , sn 2011by is brighter than sn 2011fe at @xmath153 days , especially in the @xmath6 band ( see also the residual plot of figure 16 ) .",
    "this likely suggests that sn 2011fe may have an intrinsically faster rise rate compared to sn 2011by , since these two sne  ia have very similar @xmath7 values , consistent with the argument that the gamma - ray photons from the radioactive decay are less trapped in sn 2011fe and reach its photosphere more easily relative to sn 2011by .",
    "the late - time light curves can be used to constrain the underlying physics for the lingering light , such as radioactive decay of long - lived isotopes ( milne et al . 1999 , 2001 ) , interaction with csm , and light echoes ( li et al . 2002 ) .",
    "very late - time observations are rare for sne  ia .",
    "sn 2011fe provides us a good opportunity to study the late - time evolution of a normal sn  ia .",
    "based on late - time mid - ir photometry and nebular spectra , mcclelland et al .",
    "( 2013 ) found that the singly ionized iron - peak elements faded at close to the @xmath154co radioactive decay rate , while doubly ionized cobalt faded at a rate more than twice the @xmath154co radioactive decay rate owing to recombination . in section 3.1 , we noticed that sn 2011fe showed an apparently faster decay rate in the @xmath5 band compared to sn 2003du and sn 2003hv , which can be also interpreted as an opacity effect .",
    "alternatively , the sn has a relatively clean environment and the expanding ejecta do not interact with the csm expelled from the progenitor .    to obtain better knowledge of the late - time emission , we use our optical light curves to construct the late - time bolometric light curve by assuming that the contribution of nir - band emission is about 5% and",
    "the contribution of the uv - band emission is negligible after @xmath155 days , as adopted in the analysis of sn 2003hv ( leloudas et al .",
    "we fit the bolometric light curve during the phase from @xmath156 days to @xmath157 days using a simple model , @xmath158 , where @xmath159 is the bolometric luminosity , @xmath160 is the @xmath154ni mass , @xmath161 is the optical depth , and @xmath162 is the time when the optical depth to the gamma rays becomes unity ( e.g. , sollerman et al . 1998 ; leloudas et al . 2009 ) , as shown in the subset of figure 7 .",
    "we derive @xmath163 days and @xmath164  m@xmath16 , which is lower than the @xmath154ni mass obtained with the peak luminosity ( @xmath165  m@xmath18 ) .",
    "this large difference is perhaps caused by a substantial fraction of the flux being emitted beyond the uv through ir bands , or by positron escape and/or an ir catastrophe ( irc ) that occurs in the ejecta at very late phases as suggested by leloudas et al .",
    "the effect of an irc in sn 2011fe has been confirmed by fransson & jerkstrand ( 2015 ) using the spectrum taken at @xmath23 days . in comparison ,",
    "mazzali et al . (",
    "2015 ) derived the @xmath154ni mass as @xmath166  m@xmath18 and the stable iron mass as @xmath167  m@xmath18 for sn 2011fe , based on modeling of the nebular spectra .",
    "although the progenitor properties of sn 2011fe have been thoroughly studied in the literature , our extensive observations presented here still enable us to put useful constraints from a different perspective because the uv- or @xmath5-band emission may be sensitive to metallicity ( e.g. , hflich et al .",
    "1998 ; lentz et al .",
    "2000 ; sauer et al . 2008 ) .",
    "the stronger uv emission and fast - rising evolution seen in sn 2011fe indicate that the ejecta from the exploding wd may have smaller opacity compared to that of some normal sne  ia ( especially its `` twin '' sn 2011by ; foley & kirshner 2013 ; graham et al .",
    "this is further supported by the fast decay of the @xmath5-band light curve seen at late times , which is likely to be the result of less energy trapping in the ejecta .",
    "the unusual behavior of sn 2011fe shown in the uv and @xmath5 bands can be reasonably explained if the progenitor star of sn 2011fe has a lower metallicity than normal .",
    "this conclusion is supported by some other evidence and analysis .",
    "assuming that sn 2011fe is in the plane of the galactic disk of m101 , and adopting a gas - phase oxygen abundance gradient of bresolin et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , stoll et al . (",
    "2011 ) estimated that the oxygen abundance inferred at the site of sn 2011fe is 12 + log(o / h ) @xmath168 , which is apparently lower than the corresponding solar value .",
    "analysis of the observed uv spectra of sn 2011fe and sn 2011by also suggests that the former has a subsolar progenitor metallicity ( foley & kirshner 2013 ; however , see graham et al .",
    "the effect of metallicity variations in the progenitor on the synthetic spectra was recently studied by baron et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , who found that a delayed - detonation model with a progenitor metallicity of z@xmath16/20 can fit the spectra of sn 2011fe better than a metallicity of z@xmath16 .",
    "the sign of a metallicity effect on the explosions of sne  ia has been controversial ( e.g. , timmes et al .",
    "2003 ; brown et al . 2015 ; miles et al . 2015 ) .",
    "however , the study of sn 2011fe seems to indicate that the emission of sne  ia at shorter wavelengths could be enhanced with decreasing metallicity of the progenitors .",
    "in this paper , we present extensive observations of optical photometry and spectroscopy of sn 2011fe . fitting to the early - time multi - band light curves of sn 2011fe with a power - law model ( @xmath169 )",
    "yields a rise time of 18.00 days , which is consistent with previous results .",
    "the best - fit index @xmath3 is close to 2 in the @xmath4 bands , but larger than 2 in the @xmath143 bands , suggestive of a faster rise at shorter wavelengths .",
    "sn 2011fe is also found to have stronger uv emission and reach its uv peak a few days earlier than the comparison sne  ia such as sn 2005cf and the `` twin '' sn 2011by .",
    "moreover , the @xmath5-band light curve shows a remarkably faster decay rate at late times compared to other normal sne  ia .",
    "the early - time spectra of sn 2011fe resemble those of other normal sne  ia in many respects , including the presence of c  ii absorption and the hvfs from the ca  ii  nir triplet .",
    "note that no significant hvf is detected in si  ii @xmath96355 absorption even in the extremely early - time spectrum .",
    "the hvfs are relatively weak in sn 2011fe compared to other normal sne  ia with similar @xmath7 .",
    "on the other hand , the o - hvfs are very prominent in sn 2011fe , strong relative to normal sne  ia .",
    "moreover , a second hvf at higher velocities ( @xmath53 22,000 km  s@xmath17 ) can be also identified in some of our early - time spectra .",
    "the presence of this high - velocity oxygen indicates that the burning of the c+o white dwarf is not complete for sn 2011fe and the corresponding photosphere has a lower temperature .",
    "this is consistent with the relatively weak si - hvf in sn 2011fe , given an ionization ( or temperature ) effect and/or an abundance enhancement scenario for the formation of hvfs .",
    "these results suggest congruously that the expanding ejecta of the progenitor of sn 2011fe have a lower opacity and hence a lower metallicity .",

    "<S> we present well - sampled optical observations of the bright type ia supernova ( sn  ia ) sn 2011fe in m101 . our data , starting from @xmath0 days before maximum light and extending to @xmath1 days after maximum , provide an unprecedented time series of spectra and photometry for a normal sn  ia . </S>",
    "<S> fitting the early - time rising light curve , we find that the luminosity evolution of sn 2011fe follows a @xmath2 law , with the index @xmath3 being close to 2.0 in the @xmath4 bands but slightly larger in the @xmath5 and @xmath6 bands . combining the published ultraviolet ( uv ) and near - infrared ( nir ) photometry , we derive the contribution of uv / nir emission relative to the optical . </S>",
    "<S> sn 2011fe is found to have stronger uv emission and reaches its uv peak a few days earlier than other sne  ia with similar @xmath7 , suggestive of less trapping of high - energy photons in the ejecta . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the @xmath5-band light curve shows a notably faster decline at late phases ( @xmath8300 days ) , which also suggests that the ejecta may be relatively transparent to uv photons . </S>",
    "<S> these results favor the notion that sn 2011fe might have a progenitor system with relatively lower metallicity . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the early - phase spectra exhibit prominent high - velocity features ( hvfs ) of o  i @xmath97773 and the ca  ii  nir triplet , but only barely detectable in si  ii  6355 . </S>",
    "<S> this difference can be caused either by an ionization / temperature effect or an abundance enhancement scenario for the formation of hvfs ; it suggests that the photospheric temperature of sn 2011fe is intrinsically low , perhaps owing to incomplete burning during the explosion of the white dwarf . </S>"
