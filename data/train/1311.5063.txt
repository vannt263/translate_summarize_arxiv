    "because mass loss takes place throughout the star s main - sequence life , as the stars age , they spin down . for solar - mass main - sequence stars",
    ", it has been both empirically recognised @xcite and theoretically shown ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that the stellar angular rotation velocity @xmath2 scales with the age @xmath3 of the star as @xmath4 .    by comparing colour - period diagrams for open clusters at different ages ,",
    "it has been suggested that , as the cluster ages , stars that were once part of the spread group of fast rotators evolve into the more defined sequence of slow / moderate rotators as they spin - down @xcite .",
    "this evolution appears to occur more rapidly for more massive stars , indicating that the time for a star to spin - down increases with decreasing stellar mass .",
    "@xcite estimate that g dwarfs should make this transition in a time scale @xmath5  myr , while early to mid - k dwarfs should take @xmath6  myr , and late k dwarfs would take @xmath7  myr to evolve from the sequence of fast rotators to the moderate / slow rotator sequence .",
    "if the same trend continues down to the lower - mass - object range , one expects the spin - down time scale to be even longer for m dwarf ( dm ) stars .",
    "indeed , @xcite showed that by the hyades age ( @xmath8  myr ) , dm stars with masses above @xmath9 have already converged towards the tight period ",
    "colour sequence ( also shown as period  mass relation ) . by investigating a sample of field - dm stars in the fully convective regime ( masses @xmath10 )",
    ", @xcite showed that kinematically young ( thin disc , ages @xmath11  gyr ) objects rotate faster than the kinematically old ( thick disc , ages @xmath12  gyr ) objects , in agreement with previous expectations and also with activity lifetimes of late - dm stars ( * ? ? ? * @xmath13  gyr ) .",
    "none the less , recent studies have revealed an interesting behaviour for field dm stars less massive than @xmath14 ( @xcite from mearth data ; @xcite from kepler data ) .",
    "first , a wide range of rotation rates is observed , where a population of rapidly rotating dm stars coexist with a significant population of slow rotators ( possibly due to populations of stars with different ages ) .",
    "second , a trend exists in the upper envelope of the period  mass relation , which changes sign at masses around @xmath14 .",
    "note that the upper envelope of the perio ",
    "mass relation is defined by the slowest rotating stars at each mass bin . for @xmath15",
    ", @xcite found that the period of the slowest rotating objects rises with decreasing mass .",
    "this indicates that some dm stars might lose angular momentum more efficiently than other dm stars and higher mass stars .",
    "these observations represent a challenge for models of rotational evolution cool stars .",
    "new analytical models have been derived by @xcite , assuming a monopolar magnetic field , whose intensity does not depend on the stellar mass nor time . within this framework ,",
    "the increase of the braking time scale toward decreasing mass observed close to the fully convective boundary naturally arises from the strong decrease of stellar radii in this mass range .",
    "in addition , they argue that the existence of slowly rotating fully - convective field m dwarfs , could be accounted for by assuming that the rotation rate @xmath16 at which activity saturation occurs on lower - mass stars is much larger than @xmath16 of higher mass stars .",
    "we will argue in section  [ sec.rotev ] that taking into account the topology of the magnetic field might be an alternative ( and perhaps additional ) explanation .    in order to reproduce rotational evolution of stars in open clusters , empirically - motivated revisions in the standard solar wind - prescription",
    "have been used .",
    "these modifications , for example , allow for the presence of different magnetic field geometries @xcite , angular velocity saturation @xcite , decoupling between the radiative core and the convective envelope @xcite .",
    "the downside of the inclusion of empirical phenomena in such prescriptions is that they introduce parameters that are arbitrarily adjusted to fit the data .",
    "it is , therefore , crucial to understand from theoretical principles the role that winds of low - mass stars play on the extraction of angular momentum .",
    "recent works have provided important steps towards that direction @xcite , but the role of different magnetic topologies has not yet been investigated .    the magnetic field that emerges at the surface of the stars",
    "is expected to present different characteristics , reflecting the different stellar internal structures and operating dynamo mechanisms .",
    "this expectation is confirmed by recent surveys that probe the large - scale topology of the surface magnetic fields of dm stars @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that mid - dm stars ( either fully convective or with a small radiative core ) exhibit strong poloidal axisymmetric dipole - like surface magnetic topologies , while the partially convective ones present weaker , non - axisymmetric fields with significant toroidal component @xcite .",
    "the picture that arises from the analysis of a more recent sample of late - m objects @xcite shows two distinct populations : one with very strong axisymmetric poloidal fields ( similar to the mid - m stars ) and another with significant non - axisymmetric component , plus a significant toroidal component .",
    "the effect that complex magnetic field topologies might have on stellar winds has not been systematically investigated in the literature , as most of the theoretical work developed so far relies on simplified , axisymmetric geometries for the magnetic field . @xcite performed simulations of stellar winds of young suns with different alignments between the rotation axis and the magnetic dipole axis . in those simulations ,",
    "angular momentum losses are enhanced by a factor of @xmath17 as one goes from the aligned case to the case where the dipole is tilted by @xmath18 ( i.e. , as non - axisymmetry is increased ) . in the present work ,",
    "the variations of surface characteristics are observationally determined and constitute therefore an extra step towards more realistic models of stellar winds of low - mass stars .    to investigate the behaviour of angular momentum loss of low - mass stars , we present in this paper a comparative study of stellar winds of a sample of early - dm stars ( spectral types m0 to m2.5 ) , for which surface magnetic field maps have been obtained .",

    "a discussion about the effects of the field topology on angular momentum losses are presented in section  [ sec.discussion ] , where we also discuss possible effects on orbiting planets . in section  [ sec.conclusions ] , we present our summary and conclusions of this work .",
    "the stars considered in this study consist of six early - m stars ( spectral types m0 to m2.5 ) , for which the large - scale surface magnetic field maps have been reconstructed from a series of circular polarisation spectra using the zeeman - doppler imaging ( zdi ) technique . in this work ,",

    "section  [ sec.modelcomp ] ) .",
    "we find that the amount of open flux is approximately linearly related to the observed unsigned large - scale surface flux ( @xmath27 , figure  [ fig.fit_obs]a ) .    the mass loss - rate per surface area @xmath22 correlates with the unsigned surface flux @xmath26 to the power of @xmath28 a relatively tight correlation ( figure  [ fig.fit_obs]b ) .",
    "although we do not find a tight correlation between @xmath23 and @xmath26 ( @xmath29 , figure  [ fig.fit_obs]c ) , there is an impressive correlation between the braking time scale @xmath24 and @xmath26 : @xmath30 ( figure  [ fig.fit_obs]d ) .",
    "it is still early to argue that this correlation will hold for other spectral types and only by doing a large number of simulations we will be able to verify that .",
    "never the less , it is interesting to note that this correlation is qualitatively expected : dynamo theories predict that fast rotators should present large surface magnetic fluxes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and magnetic activity is indeed observed to be strong for fast rotators . in addition , theories predict that fast rotators lose angular momentum at faster rates than slow rotators @xcite , therefore presenting shorter braking time scales .",
    "as the star slows down , the braking time scale becomes increasingly longer and its magnetic flux becomes smaller .",
    "our results therefore support this picture , i.e. , dm - stars with large magnetic fluxes should have shorter braking time scales .",

    "it is not possible to isolate the individual dependences of the stellar parameters on @xmath23 . to numerically achieve that , a considerably large set of simulations would be required .",
    "in spite of this limitation , we have presented how a few wind - derived properties ( @xmath31 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath21 , @xmath24 ) are related to each other ( lower portion of table  [ tab.fits ] , figures  [ fig.fit_openflux ] and [ fig.fit_other ] ) , in a similar way as we did in section  [ sec.fits_obs ] .",
    "the increase of @xmath31 and @xmath23 with the unsigned open flux in slow rotators is predicted in the spherically symmetric model developed by @xcite , as @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in their model ,",
    "@xcite assume a radial surface magnetic field , which develops a relatively large azimuthal component with distance , caused by stellar wind stresses .",

    "although the slopes for @xmath39 and @xmath40 are similar to the ones derived from the weber - davis model , our results show rather large scatter , which we attribute to two factors .",
    "the first cause of the large scatter is due to the wide range of field topologies ( i.e. , deviations from the purely radial field topology assumed in weber - davis model ) and the second is due to dependences of @xmath23 with multiple variables whose dependence could not be isolated ( e.g. , the size of the alfvn  surface ; cf .",

    "in addition , our simulations suggest that @xmath23 and @xmath31 are correlated , although the correlation @xmath44 presents a large scatter and its power - law index @xmath25 has a large fitting error ( @xmath45 , cf .",
    "[ fig.fit_other]a ) .",
    "this correlation is an important point that must be considered in works that adopt formalisms of angular momentum - loss rates .",
    "for example , @xcite derived an analytical prescription for angular momentum losses , which , for a particular choice of magnetic field topology ( when the alfvn radius is proportional to @xmath46 ) , @xmath23 becomes independent of @xmath31 .",
    "this relation , although incorrect , had been widely used because it does not depend on the poorly constrained @xmath31 for cool , low - mass stars .",
    "the presence of non - axisymmetric fields provide extra magnetic and thermal forces acting in the ( asymmetric ) alfvn  surface that modify the loss of angular momentum ( @xcite , see appendix  [ ap.amloss ] ) .",
    "this is also verified in the simulations presented in @xcite .",
    "they performed simulations of stellar winds of young suns with different alignments between the rotation axis and the magnetic dipole axis . in those simulations ,",
    "angular momentum losses were enhanced by a factor of @xmath17 as one goes from the aligned case to the case where the dipole is tilted by @xmath18 ( i.e. , as non - axisymmetry is increased ) .",
    "the six early - dm stars investigated in this work have similar masses , radii , and effective temperatures , but comprise two different groups with different rotation periods . the slowest rotating stars ( gj 49 , ds leo and ce boo ) have rotational periods of @xmath47  days , while the fastest rotating objects ( dt vir , ot ser , and gj 182 ) have periods of @xmath48  days .",
    "despite sharing similar characteristics , members of each group present different surface magnetic field topologies and intensities .",
    "for this reason , this sample is useful for investigating the effects that different magnetic field characteristics play on stellar winds .",
    "we compare our results to what one would have obtained using a simplified , one - dimensional ( 1d ) wind model .",
    "the 1d semi - analytical solution is found by assuming ( i ) a star with a uniformly distributed , purely radial magnetic field , whose intensity equals the average observed radial field strength ( @xmath49 ) and ( ii ) a polytropic wind , with the same base density , temperature and @xmath50 as those adopted in our 3d simulations ( i.e. , the hydrodynamical quantities are as in the initial state of the simulation ) .",
    "note that the 1d wind solution we construct is exact for non - rotating stars and we expect some deviations for slowly rotating stars ( such as the ones in our sample ) .",
    "from assumptions ( i ) and ( ii ) , we are then able to calculate the spherical radius ( @xmath51 ) of the alfvn surface of this simplified wind model and also its mass - loss rate ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "we calculate the angular momentum - loss rates as in @xcite @xmath53 table  [ table2 ] shows how the angular momentum - loss rate @xmath54 predicted by a simplified 1d model compares to the value of @xmath23 derived from our 3d simulations .",
    "we find that @xmath55 ranges from 0.15 to 0.5 .",
    "one reason why the simplified 1d model over - predicts angular momentum loss rates is because assumption ( i ) implies that all the surface magnetic field contributes to the wind in the 1d simplified model , while in the 3d solution , only the open field lines participate in the angular momentum removal .    to isolate the effects that different field topologies might have on @xmath23 , it is interesting to compare stars with similar rotation rates and observed surface magnetic fluxes @xmath26 .",
    "comparison between gj  49 and ds  leo shows that ds  leo has @xmath23 that is larger by factor of @xmath56 , and comparison between ot  ser and dt  vir , shows that dt  vir presents @xmath23 that is a factor @xmath57 larger .",
    "our results demonstrate that different field topologies indeed affects the amount of angular momentum lost in the wind , as different magnetic field intensities and topologies contribute differently to extraction of angular momentum .",
    "although a factor of a few in @xmath23 seems to be a small difference , if 3d effects ( due to field topology ) are not properly accounted in rotational evolution models , this small deviation can lead to an error in predicting the rotation rates of dm stars .",
    "for example , if the assumed angular momentum - loss rates are smaller than the ` real ' ones , rotational evolution models end up predicting increasingly larger rotation rates with time and therefore an excess of fast rotators .",
    "it is difficult to quantify the error in the predicted rotation rates , since @xmath23 is a complex function of many variables , but a rough estimate is presented next . if we take an angular momentum loss rate that depends on the angular velocity to some power @xmath58 ( @xmath59 , for a given coefficient @xmath60 ) , one can show that , for large @xmath3 , @xmath61^{1/(-q+1)}$ ] , where we assumed that @xmath62 and that @xmath33 and @xmath32 are roughly constants ( e.g. , low - mass stars in the main - sequence phase )",
    ". therefore , a factor of @xmath63 excess in the coefficient @xmath60 predicts rotation rates that are different by a factor of @xmath64 .",
    "note that for @xmath65 , the skumanich s rotation - age relation ( @xmath4 ) is recovered and , in that case , overestimating the angular momentum loss rates by a factor of @xmath63 predicts rotation rates that are small by a factor @xmath17 .",
    "recently , @xcite found that the slope of the upper envelope of the period  mass distribution ( which is defined by the slowest rotating stars ) changes sign at masses around @xmath14 and that for @xmath15 the period of the slowest rotators rises with decreasing mass .",
    "simplified analytical models derived by @xcite are able to explain the slow rotation rates of dm stars by assuming that the rotation rate at which activity saturation occurs is much larger than the rotation rate at which higher mass stars saturate ( cf .",
    "section  [ sec.intro ] ) .",
    "an alternative , or perhaps an additional , explanation for the rise in period of the upper envelope of the period  mass relation found by @xcite could also be explained by different magnetic field topologies .",
    "cosmic rays play important effects on the chemistry and ionisation of planetary atmospheres .",
    "they could also be a source of genetic mutations in organisms @xcite .",
    "therefore , the impact of cosmic ray flux on exoplanets may have important implications for both atmospheric characterisation and habitability .",
    "the flux of cosmic rays that impact the earth is modulated over the solar cycle .",
    "@xcite found that the non - axisymmetric component of the total open solar magnetic flux is inversely correlated to the cosmic - ray rate . by analogy , if the non - axisymmetric component of the stellar magnetic field is able to reduce the flux of cosmic rays reaching the planet , then we would expect that planets orbiting stars with largely non - axisymmetric fields would be more shielded from galactic cosmic rays , independently of the planet s own shielding mechanism ( such as the ones provides by a thick atmosphere or large magnetosphere ) .    from reconstructions of stellar magnetic fields using the zdi technique ,",
    "it is possible to separate the axisymmetric part of the surface field from the non - axisymmetric one @xcite .",
    "however , it is not obvious if the non - axisymmetric field should maintain its surface characteristics at large distances .",
    "here we calculate the unsigned magnetic fluxes considering both the axi- and non - axisymmetric components of the magnetic field from the results of our simulations , following the approach of @xcite .",
    "their approach considers a potential field extrapolation , where the axisymmetric component of the magnetic field is obtained by averaging the contribution of the spherical harmonics of order @xmath66 over longitude @xmath67 .",
    "although the magnetic field derived in our simulations is not potential , we adopt a similar approach and define the axi - symmetric component of the magnetic field as @xmath68 the corresponding unsigned axisymmetric magnetic flux is @xmath69 in our computations , we take a sphere close to the outer edge of our simulations ( @xmath70 ) . we find that dt  vir , ds  leo and gj  182 have the smallest ratio of @xmath71 ( 0.18 , 0.52 , and 0.65 respectively ) .",
    "on the other hand , ce  boo , gj  49 and ot  ser are very axisymmetric and present the largest values of @xmath71 ( 0.95 , 0.88 and 0.97 , respectively ) .",
    "although these flux ratios are not identical to the axisymmetric - to - total magnetic energy ratios observationally derived ( * ? ? ?",
    "@xmath72 in table  [ table ] ) , the trend is similar to the observed one .",
    "this means that the axisymmetric magnetic field topologies that are observed can be used to characterise the degree of axisymmetric field at large distances from the star .",
    "therefore , if cosmic ray shielding is more efficient in planets orbiting stars whose magnetic fields are more non - axisymmetric , then planets orbiting dt  vir , ds  leo and gj  182 should be the most effectively shielded planets from galactic cosmic rays .",
    "detailed computations of the propagation of cosmic rays such as those performed in @xcite should provide better constraints of the effectiveness of the shielding of cosmic rays due to the non - axisymmetry of the host - star magnetic fields .      in section  [ sec.massflux ] , we showed that the mass flux profile is essentially modulated by the local value of @xmath73 and that , at least within our simulation domain , we find that the more non - axisymmetric topology of the stellar magnetic field results in more asymmetric mass fluxes distribution .",
    "likewise , we found that the stellar wind total pressure @xmath0 ( i.e. , the sum of thermal , magnetic and ram pressures ) is also modulated by @xmath73 and similarly , the more non - axisymmetric topology of the stellar magnetic field produces more asymmetric distributions of @xmath0 .",

    "contrary to the results obtained on wind models with axisymmetric magnetic fields , the alfvn  surfaces of the objects investigated here have irregular , asymmetric shapes , which can only be captured by fully 3d models .",

    "our simulations suggested that the complexity of the magnetic field can play an important role in the angular momentum evolution of the star , as different magnetic field intensities and topologies contribute differently to extraction of stellar angular momentum .",

    "<S> our simulations incorporate observationally reconstructed large - scale surface magnetic maps , suggesting that the complexity of the magnetic field can play an important role in the angular momentum evolution of the star , possibly explaining the large distribution of periods in field dm stars , as reported in recent works . in spite of the diversity of the magnetic field topologies among the stars in our sample , we find that stellar wind flowing near the ( rotational ) equatorial plane carries most of the stellar angular momentum , but there is no preferred colatitude contributing to mass loss , as the mass flux is maximum at different colatitudes for different stars . </S>",
    "<S> we find that more non - axisymmetric magnetic fields result in more asymmetric mass fluxes and wind total pressures @xmath0 ( defined as the sum of thermal , magnetic and ram pressures ) . because planetary magnetospheric sizes are set by pressure equilibrium between the planet s magnetic field and @xmath0 , variations of up to a factor of @xmath1 in @xmath0 ( as found in the case of a planet orbiting at several stellar radii away from the star ) lead to variations in magnetospheric radii of about 20 percent along the planetary orbital path . in analogy to the flux of cosmic rays that impact the earth , which is inversely modulated with the non - axisymmetric component of the total open solar magnetic flux , </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that planets orbiting m dwarf stars like dt  vir , ds  leo and gj  182 , which have significant non - axisymmetric field components , should be the more efficiently shielded from galactic cosmic rays , even if the planets lack a protective thick atmosphere / large magnetosphere of their own .    </S>",
