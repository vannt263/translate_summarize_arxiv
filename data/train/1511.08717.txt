    "the interaction between sufficiently intense laser pulses and spherical nanoclusters can lead to the complete expulsion of all the electrons from the cluster , as discussed in @xcite , and to a consequently rapid explosion of the left - behind ion cloud .",
    "the process is a well known mechanism of ion acceleration @xcite with many potential applications , ranging from fusion research @xcite to biomolecular imaging @xcite .",
    "while the explosion of a single species ion plasma leads to a broad energy spectrum @xcite , it has been verified that in the presence of ion mixtures conditions exist producing a quasi - monoenergetic distribution of the species having the larger charge - to - mass ratio @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations also pointed out a connection between the monochromaticity of the spectrum and the occurrence of overtakings among faster ions , leading to the formation of shock shells @xcite .",
    "the present work investigates in detail and from a theoretical point of view the energy spectrum of charged particles accelerated during the coulomb explosion of ion mixtures .",
    "in particular , a mixture composed by two types of ions uniformly distributed is considered .",
    "the ions of the two species have masses @xmath0 , @xmath1 and electric charges @xmath2 , @xmath3 , with @xmath4 the ions , which are initially at rest , start moving under the influence of the repulsive electrostatic forces , and the species with a larger charge - to - mass ratio moves faster . in this way , two concentric spherical regions , @xmath5 and @xmath6 ,",
    "are created having radius @xmath7 respectively , with @xmath8 .",
    "the sphere @xmath6 contains fast and slow particles and @xmath9 represents the frontline of the slow ions ; instead , the spherical shell in @xmath5 outside @xmath6 contains only fast particles .",
    "the ion dynamics is different in these two regions , and it is studied in detail in sect .",
    "2 ( inner region ) and in sect .",
    "3 ( outer region ) . the dynamics of the explosion depends strongly on the presence of shock shells .",
    "it is proved rigorously that the appearance of shocks depends only on the ratio between the total charge of the fast ions and the one of the slow ions , and not on their masses ( sect .",
    "4 ) . in sect . 5 , by using a hamiltonian approach the properties of the energy spectra are studied analytically . in particular , a rigorous proof is provided for the existence of a threshold for the generation of shock shells ( previously this proof was known only for the limit situation of @xmath10 @xcite ) , so confirming the results of numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "finally , some conclusions are reported in sect .",
    "whenever possible , the properties of the explosions have been deduced analytically , otherwise the study has been performed numerically with the so called `` shell method '' @xcite , which provides extremely precise results by exploiting the spherical symmetry of the problem .",
    "initially , all the ions are uniformly distributed inside a sphere of radius @xmath11 . as",
    "the charge density is constant , the radial electric field is linear .",
    "therefore , there will be a uniform expansion for both slow and fast ions , and consequently the charge density will remain constant inside the sphere @xmath6 , producing again a linear behaviour of the electric field . from this consideration",
    ", one can infer that the electric field inside @xmath6 remains a linear function of the radius @xmath12 at any time : @xmath13 under this assumption , the equations of motion for the fast and the slow ions inside @xmath6 can be written in a simple way .",
    "the uniform expansion can be described by introducing two functions , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , such that slow ions and fast ions initially at @xmath16 are moved at time @xmath17 to @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "moreover , the initial densities of the two species , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , evolve in time as    @xmath22    using gauss s law , the electric field inside the sphere @xmath6 can be written as : @xmath23 which has the correct dependence on @xmath12 , as in eq . .",
    "after introducing expression into the equations of the motion for fast and slow ions , by writing the acceleration of the ions of the two species as @xmath24 and @xmath25 , one finally obtains @xmath26 in which @xmath27 does not appear .",
    "equations can be rewritten in a more compact way , as @xmath28 being @xmath29^{1/2 } , \\quad \\alpha=\\dfrac{n_{f,0}}{n_{f,0}+n_{s,0 } } , \\quad \\beta=\\dfrac{q_s}{q_f}. \\ ] ] the quantity @xmath30 represents a characteristic frequency for the fast ion expansion , while @xmath31 is the fraction of fast ions in the cluster .",
    "the system of equations describes the dynamics of slow ions during the whole explosion and the motion of fast ions as long as they are inside @xmath6 .",
    "a fast ion , initially at @xmath32 , reaches the border of the inner region when @xmath33 .",
    "the time the ion crosses the sphere @xmath6 , indicated in the following as @xmath34 , is obtained by solving the equation @xmath35 considering a fast ion initially at @xmath27 , the electric field for @xmath36 can be written as @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the charge in the sphere of radius @xmath12 at time @xmath17 ; as long as overtakings between fast ions do not occur , @xmath38 is the sum of the total charge of slow ions and the charge of the fast ions initially inside a sphere of radius @xmath27 : @xmath39 consequently , for @xmath40 , the equation of motion for a fast ion outside @xmath6 is @xmath41 equation can be integrated in order to obtain the asymptotic kinetic energy of the fast ions , @xmath42 , as @xmath43 the energy spectrum of the fast ions , @xmath44 , can be written as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the total number of fast ions , while @xmath47 represents the number of ions having asymptotic energy in the interval @xmath48 . making use of eqs . and , the spectrum can be expressed parametrically as a function of @xmath49 , as : @xmath50    as pointed out in a previous work @xcite , shock shells arise when the fraction of fast ions , @xmath51 , is smaller than a critical value , @xmath52 .",
