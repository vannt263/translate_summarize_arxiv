    "a physical property of planetary systems that has yet to be fully understood is a connection between planetary formation and the metallicities of the host stars .",
    "there is now unequivocal evidence that main sequence ( ms ) fgk - type dwarfs known to have at least one giant planet ( i.e. , m@xmath3 m@xmath4 , where m@xmath5 is the planetary mass and m@xmath4 is a jupiter mass ) companion discovered via the radial velocity method are metal - rich compared to similar stars in the disk field not known to harbor close - in giant planets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "contrary to this observation , there is increasing evidence that this planet - metallicity correlation does not extend to evolved giant stars ; giants with planets tend to be more metal - poor than their main sequence counterparts ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the metallicity distribution of planetary host stars may hold critical clues to planet formation processes and the subsequent evolution of planetary systems .",
    "indeed , the favored interpretation of the planet - metallicity correlation observed for ms dwarfs is that planets form more readily in high - metallicity environments ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , in agreement with predictions of core accretion planet formation models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a competing interpretation , however , holds that the enhanced metallicity results from the accretion of h - depleted rocky material onto the star and pollution of the thin convective envelopes of fgk dwarfs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this scenario would be supported by the lower metallicities of giants with planets , which having been enhanced on the ms , would be diluted by the deepening convection zones as the stars evolve up the red giant branch .",
    "an observational result that has been used as an argument in favor of the primordial enrichment hypothesis and against the pollution hypothesis is the observed metallicities of subgiants : subgiants with planetary companions have been shown to have enhanced metal abundances , similar to those of ms dwarfs with planets @xcite .",
    "if the difference in metallicities of planet hosting dwarfs and giants results from the pollution and subsequent dilution of the stars convective envelopes , one might expect the subgiants to have intermediate metallicities , forming a metallicity gradient from the metal - rich ms dwarfs , to the increasingly diluted subgiants , and finally to the fully diluted giants . heretofore , this pattern has not been observed . in this paper , we present the results of a homogeneous metallicity ( [ fe / h ] ) analysis of 15 subgiants and 16 giants with planetary companions , as well as a control sample of 14 subgiants not known to harbor closely orbiting giant planets .",
    "this sample of evolved stars , which includes both giants and subgiants , constitutes the first to be analyzed in a homogeneous fashion within a single study .",
    "these metallicities are compared to those of a large sample of main sequence dwarfs with and without planets that have been derived as part of the same analysis and have been recently reported in @xcite .",
    "the sample of planet hosting stars studied here contains 31 targets .",
    "the target list was compiled from the extrasolar planet encyclopaedia , and these stars were originally part of the larger sample analyzed in @xcite : the latter study focused on the analysis of dwarf stars while the more evolved objects , giants and subgiants , are presented here .",
    "a sample of disk subgiants ( n=14 ) observed to not host closely orbiting giant planets was also observed with the same set - up , and the target list was obtained from the list of candidates deemed to be rv stable  from @xcite .",
    "the list with all stars analyzed in this study can be found in table [ obslog ] .",
    "the observations consist of high - resolution spectra ( r @xmath6 48,000 ) obtained with the feros spectrograph ( @xcite ) mpg / eso-2.20 m telescope ( la silla , chile ) .",

    "the derivation of stellar parameters and metallicities ( [ fe / h ] ) in this study followed the same methodology presented and discussed in .",
    "the same selection of and lines was analyzed and their equivalent widths were also measured using the automatic code of equivalent width measurement ares ( @xcite ) . in order to further test the quality of automatic equivalent width measurements for the parameter space covered by this particular set of subgiant and giant stars , equivalent widths of two sample targets hd 188310 ( with t@xmath8 typical of the giants in our sample and a spectrum with high s / n ) and hd 27442 ( typical t@xmath8 but with a lower s / n spectrum ) were measured manually ( using the task ` splot ` on iraf ) .",
    "our results indicate that equivalent widths measured with iraf compare favorably with the automatic ones : @xmath0ew@xmath9ew@xmath10 = @xmath11 m  for hd 188310 and @xmath12 m  for hd 27442 , which is consistent with previous results in @xcite .",
    "effective temperatures , surface gravities , microturbulent velocities and iron abundances were derived under the assumption of lte and self - consistently from the requirement that the iron abundance be independant of the line excitation potential and measured equivalent widths , as well as from the forced agreement between and abundances . although this analysis uses the approximation of lte , a discussion of possible non - lte effects in the fe abundances will be presented in sextion 4.1.3 .",
    "table [ atm_par ] lists the derived stellar parameters for the target stars .",
    "the number of and lines ( and the standard deviations in each case ) for each star is also listed .",

    "the typical values for the internal errors in this study are @xmath15 50 k in @xmath13 , 0.15 dex in log g , 0.05 km s@xmath16 for @xmath14 , and 0.05 dex in [ fe / h ] .",
    "( see for a discussion of these internal uncertainties ) .",
    "we note , however , that the real uncertainties are expected to be somewhat larger ( 100 k in @xmath13 , 0.20 dex in log g , 0.20 km s@xmath16 in @xmath14 and 0.10 dex in [ fe / h ] ) than the internal errors .",
    "the sensisitvity of abundances to changes in the parameters @xmath13 , log g and @xmath14 is also investigated . for this exercise ,",
    "we use 2 giants that span the @xmath13 interval of most of the giant sample : hd 11977 ( @xmath13 = 4972 k ) , ngc 2423 3 ( @xmath13 = 4680 k ) , and the subgiant hd 11964 ( @xmath13 = 5318 k ) .",
    "a variation of @xmath17100 k in @xmath13 induces a change of @xmath170.03 and @xmath170.05 dex in a ( ) for the coolest ( hd 122430 ) and hottest ( hd 11977 ) giants , respectively .",
    "for the subgiant , the sensitivity is @xmath17 0.09 dex .",
    "a variation of @xmath170.2 dex in log g does not affect significantly the fe abundances : a(fe ) changes by @xmath150.01 dex for the hotter stars and @xmath150.03 dex for the cooler stars .",
    "as expected , a decrease in the microturbulence causes an increase in a ( ) ; for the subgiant star , a change of @xmath170.20 km s@xmath16 causes a variation of @xmath180.08 dex in the abundance , while for the giants , this variation is around @xmath180.10 .",
    "the total errors in a(fe ) from these typical uncertainties are @xmath17 0.11 dex for the subgiants and @xmath17 0.13 dex for the giants . as the results in this study for the giants and subgiants will be compared to those for the dwarfs in , we repeat the above exercise for a typical dwarf with solar parameters ( hd 106252 ; ) .",
    "variations of @xmath17100 k in @xmath13 , @xmath170.20 dex in log g and @xmath170.20 km s@xmath16 in @xmath14 cause changes of , respectively , @xmath170.08 , @xmath190.01 and @xmath180.05 dex in a ( ) ; or a total error of @xmath17 0.1 dex .",
    "these total uncertainties for the dwarfs in paper i are slightly lower but not significantly different from the total uncertainties estimated for the subgiants ( 0.11 dex ) and giants ( 0.13 dex ) .    the derived effective temperatures for the stars in our sample can be compared with independent results from photometric @xmath20 calibrations .",
    "several photometric calibrations are available in the literature ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite presented a new implementation of the infrared flux method using 2mass magnitudes and kurucz models .",
    "a comparison of the derived spectroscopic effective temperatures with their photometric calibration is shown in the top panel of figure [ tefs ] .",
    "results are shown for all stars in our sample which have unsaturated @xmath21 2mass magnitudes ( with errors in @xmath22 0.1 mag ) ; reddening corrections from @xcite were applied to obtain the de - reddened colors .",
    "the comparison between the two scales is quite good for the entire @xmath13 range , with agreement for most of the stars within @xmath17100 k ( shown as the dashed lines in the figure ) .",
    "there is not a significant systematic difference in the effective temperatures between giants and subgiants , but we note a few outliers falling above the dashed lines ( mostly subgiants ) and 2 results for subgiants which fall below .",
    "the average difference between the two scales is well within the expected errors and overall agree with the variations typically found between different @xmath13 scales in the literature : @xmath23 ( this study - @xcite)@xmath24= @xmath25 k.    the more recent calibration by @xcite is hotter than that of @xcite ; a comparison with our results for the subgiants ( the calibration of @xcite only applies for dwarfs and subgiants ) shows a larger systematic difference of @xmath23 ( this study - @xcite)@xmath24= @xmath26 k. for the calibration of @xcite , we find @xmath27 k. this difference of @xmath1550 k is consistent with the discussion presented in section 2.5 of @xcite .",
    "reddening corrections applied to ( v - k ) influence the derived photometric temperatures : a change of 0.01 mag in e(b - v ) can lead to a change of 50 k in the effective temperature ( @xcite ) .",
    "note that @xcite have not adopted reddening corrections for stars in their samples closer than @xmath1575 pc .",
    "if we also neglect reddening corrections for those stars in our sample which are closer than @xmath1575 pc and recompute the photometric @xmath28s , the average differences become @xmath23 ( this study - @xcite)@xmath24= @xmath29 k.    the bottom panel of figure [ tefs ] shows the comparison of our derived effective temperatures with those obtained by @xcite ; the latter study also derived @xmath28 spectroscopically , although their analysis followed a different method which consisted in fitting the observed spectra by adjusting 41 free parameters ( one of them being the effective temperature ) .",
    "the @xmath28 results in the two spectroscopic analyses agree well : @xmath23 ( this study - @xcite)@xmath24= @xmath30 k.      as mentioned previously , analyzed unevolved stars with and without planets , while the present study focuses on more evolved stars , also both with and without giant planets .",
    "figure [ mbol_teff ] shows the location of the sample stars in an hr diagram with the bolometric magnitudes versus effective temperatures .",
    "the bolometric magnitudes for the stars were calculated using the bolometric corrections of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see details in ) .",
    "this figure also includes for comparison the sample of stars which was studied in ( represented by black filled circles ) , and these generally define the location of the main sequence .",
    "the target stars analyzed here are obviously more evolved . in this study ,",
    "a star is classified as a subgiant ( represented as red triangles in figure [ mbol_teff ] ) if it is 1.5 mag above the lower boundary of the main sequence and has @xmath31 ; the 17 stars which have @xmath32 are classified as giants ( represented as blue squares in figure [ mbol_teff ] ) .",
    "this boundary transition between the main - sequence and the subgiant branch is somewhat uncertain and for two stars in particular we adopted a different classification : hd 2151 was classified as a subgiant ( although it is not 1.5 mag above the lower boundary of the main sequence ) because of its low derived values of log g ( @xmath15 4.0 ) , and hd 205420 ( the isolated star with @xmath28= 6255 k and @xmath32 ) is considered as a subgiant . the transition between the subgiant and giant branches is also uncertain . in particular , the classification of two stars ( hd 177380 and hd 208801 ) which lie close to the base of the red - giant branch is uncertain ; however , their derived surface gravities are more compatible with their classification as subgiants .",
    "( nevertheless , the implications of including these stars as giants in our analysis is discussed in section [ sg ] ) .",
    "the adopted classification of the sample stars in giants and subgiants can be found in the last column of table [ obslog ] .",
    "table [ evol_par ] summarizes the evolutionary parameters calculated for the studied stars .",
    "the parallaxes are from the hipparcos catalogue ; the luminosities are calculated using the parallax , v magnitudes , reddening and the derived effective temperatures ( see for details ) .",
    "three stars ( namely ngc 2423 3 , ngc 4349 127 and hd 171028 ) were not present in the hipparcos catalogue , thus their @xmath7 magnitudes and parallaxes come from the references in the extrasolar planet encyclopaedia .",
    "note also that the @xcite model for reddening is accurate to distances within 1 kpc of the sun .",
    "the radii , masses , as well as hipparcos gravities and estimated ages in table [ evol_par ] were calculated using l. girardi s web code param , which is based on a bayesian parameter estimation method ( @xcite ) .",
    "we note that the @xmath33 evolutionary tracks ( @xcite ) were not used in this paper because these do not follow evolution through the red clump .",
    "the surface gravity values obtained here from the ionization equilibrium of and and in lte ( column 3 ; table [ atm_par ] ) can be compared with gravities which are based on hipparcos parallaxes ( column 11 ; table [ evol_par ] ) ; such a comparison is shown in figure [ loggs ] .",
    "the agreement between the average values for the two scales is found to be good : @xmath34 ( log g hipparcos @xmath2 log g this study)@xmath24 = @xmath35 0.12 dex .",
    "such an agreement between the hipparcos gravities and spectroscopic values derived from the agreement between fe i and fe ii suggest the absence of strong non - lte effects ( see discussion in section [ nlte ] ) .    concerning their masses and ages , the sample of giants studied here is more massive and younger than the subgiants and dwarfs ( from ) .",
    "the giants in our sample have an average mass of 1.82 @xmath17 0.68 m@xmath36 and a distribution ranging between @xmath15 1.1  3.8 m@xmath36 ; their average age is @xmath37= 2.22 @xmath17 1.37 gyr . for comparison",
    "we note that the sample dwarfs ( ) have @xmath38= 1.03 @xmath17 0.17 m@xmath36 ( encompassing the interval @xmath15 0.6  1.4 m@xmath36 ) and @xmath39= 5.34 @xmath17 2.70 gyr .",
    "the overlap in the mass range between the samples of giants and dwarfs is therefore small .",
    "we note that the masses and ages of the dwarfs were derived in a different way ( y@xmath40 evolutionary tracks and isochrones ) .",
    "however , it was shown in that the results from the two methods are consistent for dwarfs : @xmath41 m ( y@xmath40 - girardi s code ) = 0.03 @xmath17 0.05 @xmath42 and @xmath43 age ( y@xmath40 - girardi s code ) = 0.37 @xmath17 1.46 gyr ( see last paragraph of section 3.4 in ) .    in terms of their average masses ,",
    "the sample of subgiants studied here falls technically in between the sample of giants and dwarfs but there is considerable overlap in the mass range of the dwarf sample ( the subgiant sample encompasses the interval @xmath15 1.0  1.5 m@xmath36 ; with an average mass of 1.20 @xmath17 0.14 m@xmath36 ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the subgiants in our sample are on average slightly older than the dwarfs ( @xmath44 = 5.46 @xmath17 1.92 gyr ) , representing the oldest population in this study . in summary ,",
    "the sample subgiants are a more evolved population of the previously studied dwarfs from as these dwarfs and subgiants have approximately the same mass ranges .",
    "the sample giants , however , are evolved from stars which are more massive and are on average the youngest of all target stars .",
    "as the number of discovered planet hosting stars increases and samples include a larger number of stars which are on the red - giant branch , metallicity distributions of evolved stars hosting planets have started to appear in the literature . because the samples are still relatively small , and the abundance analyses are not always homogeneous , there is some controversy in some of the conclusions of recent studies of giants , which are briefly summarized as follows .",
    "@xcite compared the iron abundances of 7 giants with planets known at the time and found that their metallicity distribution was on average lower than that of dwarfs with planets .",
    "this result was later confirmed by @xcite who concluded that the metallicity distributions of giants with planets do not favor metal - rich systems .",
    "their results were based on a sample of 14 giants with planets ( 10 of which analyzed by their group ) and are interpreted as possible evidence for pollution .",
    "@xcite analyzed 380 g - k giants as part of the radial velocity survey at lick observatory .",
    "five of these stars host planets ; they also gather abundances from the literature for another 15 giants and obtain an average metallicity for the sample of -0.05 dex . in addition , this study concludes that there is an offset of 0.13 dex between the metallicity distributions of giants with and without planets ; the latter are found to be generally more metal poor .",
    "such an offset in the metallicity distributions is not confirmed in the recent study by @xcite , who analyzed a sample of 322 intermediate - mass late - g giants ; ten of these stars host planets .",
    "their comparisons between the metallicity distributions of giants with and without detected planets reveals no significant difference between the two samples ; both distributions have average metallicities around -0.12 dex . in the following sections we discuss the metallicity distributions for the giant and subgiant planet - hosting stars in our sample .      the iron abundance distribution derived from the sample of giant stars hosting planets ( n=16 )",
    "is shown in the top panel of figure [ giant_hist ] as a red dotted line histogram ; the average value for this distribution is @xmath0[fe / h]@xmath45= -0.06 dex . for comparison ,",
    "the iron abundances obtained for the sample of dwarf stars hosting giant planets ( n=117 ) from are also shown ( black solid line histogram ) .",
    "it is apparent from the figure that the metallicity distribution of the giant stars peaks at a lower metallicity value when compared to the dwarf stars ; the difference between the average [ fe / h ] is 0.17 dex .",
    "the application of a kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test gives a probability of only 1% that the main - sequence dwarfs and giants are drawn from the same parent fe - abundance population .",
    "it is important to recognize , however , the relatively small number of giant stars in this comparison , although this contains @xmath1545% of the total number of giant stars hosting giant planets found to date .    in order to improve the giant star statistics as much as possible , iron abundances for the remaining giants known to have planets were collected from different studies in the literature ; their metallicities are listed in table [ giant_lit ] .",
    "literature results for the giant star sample studied here are also presented for comparison .",
    "the histogram in the bottom panel of figure [ giant_hist ] shows the metallicity distribution for the sample including both the giants in this study and for all other literature giants in table [ giant_lit ] ( n=37 ; blue dashed line ) .",
    "the metallicity distribution for the planet - hosting dwarfs from is shown again for comparison .",
    "using the extended giant sample yields a similar conclusion : the metallicities of giant stars with planets are on average lower than dwarfs with planets .",
    "in particular , the average metallicity for the extended sample ( giants from this study plus literature ) is somewhat lower ( @xmath0[fe / h]@xmath24=-0.12 dex ) , but not significantly so , than the average metallicity obtained using only the giants from this study by 0.06 dex .",
    "the results from this extended giant sample reinforce the premise that giant stars with giant planets seem to have on average lower iron abundances than dwarf stars with giant planets . the application of a k - s test using the extended giant sample gives a very small probability of 1.91 x 10@xmath46% that the main - sequence dwarfs and giants are drawn from the same parent population .",
    "such results are in line with the conclusions by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) who discuss that the metallicity distributions of planet hosting dwarfs and giants are different ; with the giant stars having a distribution shifted to lower metallicites by 0.20.3 dex with respect to the dwarfs .",
    "as a final note , we recall the discussion about uncertainties in section [ param_feh ] .",
    "it was shown that our spectroscopic temperatures for the giants would be @xmath1520 k cooler if we considered the photometric temperatures as the correct  scale .",
    "this would result in underestimated abundances by 0.02 dex at most .",
    "the sensitivity of this parameter to @xmath13 , log g and @xmath14 was also discussed and the conclusion was that relative systematic effects of up to 0.1 dex can exist when comparing abundances of dwarfs and giants .",
    "comparisons of our metallicities with those from many studies in the literature ( see table 5 of and table [ giant_lit ] of this study ) do not show evidence for these possible systematic effects in our metallicities .",
    "even if they existed , neither would be sufficient to explain the differences of 0.17  0.23 dex found between the average metallicities of dwarfs and giants .",
    "an additional important aspect of the present study is the homogeneous abundance analysis for samples of subgiants with and without giant planets .",
    "a comparison of the metallicity distributions for the two samples ( figure [ subgiant_hist ] top panel ) points to a similarity to that found for dwarfs ; namely that subgiant stars without planets are on average more metal poor than the sample of subgiants hosting planets . the results from showed that the metallicity distribution of dwarfs hosting planets was more metal rich by 0.15 dex than that for dwarfs not hosting planets .",
    "this abundance offset found previously for unevolved stars compares well with the difference obtained here for subgiants : the average metallicity for our sample of subgiants hosting planets ( n=15 ) is @xmath0[fe / h]@xmath24 = + 0.12 dex and for subgiants without planets ( n=14 ) it is more metal poor by 0.21 dex ( @xmath0[fe / h]@xmath24 = -0.09 dex ) .",
    "@xcite also analyzed a sample of 86 subgiants , nine of which host giant planets .",
    "they find that the median metallicity of their sample of subgiants without detected planets is -0.01 dex , while that of the sample of subgiants with planets is + 0.35 dex .",
    "this is more metal rich than the results found here for planet hosting subgiants : the median metallicty of the subgiant distribution obtained here is 0.20 dex .    as discussed in the previous section ,",
    "the sample of subgiants studied here is in fact on average older than the sample of dwarfs ( from ) , as well as the giant star sample . in terms of their mass distribution the subgiants , although including a few more massive stars , constitute the same general population as the dwarfs , but are just older and more evolved .",
    "a comparison of the metallicities of subgiants in our sample and dwarfs from is shown in figure [ subgiant_hist ] ( bottom panel ) , and the distributions are not significantly different .",
    "a k - s test gives a probability of 56% that the two samples belong to the same parent population .",
    "based on a k - s test applied to their samples , @xcite also find that the metallicity distributions of main - sequence and subgiant stars with planets are consistent , and that both samples are more metal - rich than their counterparts without detected planets .",
    "there is presently a negligible offset ( 0.01 dex ) between the averages of the metallicity distributions of dwarfs with planets ( from ) and the subgiants with planets studied here : both have @xmath0[fe / h]@xmath1 + 0.11 dex . in general terms",
    ", this is what would be expected if dwarfs and subgiants come from the same population if there are no effects related to age - metallicity .",
    "it should be recognized , however , that the subgiant sample is significantly smaller than the dwarf sample and that this offset in metallicity , which is found to be zero for the stars with planets , could in fact be as large as @xmath150.05 dex given the uncetainties in the analysis and the small number statistics .",
    "in fact , there is a small offset of 0.05 dex between the averages of the metallicity distributions of dwarfs and subgiants without planets ( with the latter being more metal poor ) .",
    "for example , if the the planet hosting star ( hd 177830 ) which lies in the transition between the subgiant and red - giant branches ( previously noted in section [ evol ] ; figure [ mbol_teff ] ) is instead classified as a giant ( as in @xcite ) , this will affect the average metallicity of the sample of subgiants with planets which will change to a slightly lower value : @xmath0[fe / h]@xmath24=+0.10 dex ( n=14 ) ; or an offset between subgiants and dwarfs with planets of 0.01 dex ( note also that in this case the giants will have an average metallicity which is slightly higher of @xmath0[fe / h]@xmath24=-0.03 dex ) .",
    "if this offset in the metallicities between the dwarfs and subgiants is small but real , a possible interpretation for the lower metallicity found for the subgiants is that these small differences in the abundances are the result of chemical evolution , since the sample subgiant stars are older they would be on average slightly more metal poor .",
    "we note that the discusson about uncertainties presented in section [ param_feh ] revealed that no significant systematic effects should be expected in the comparison of metallicities of subgiants and dwarfs .",
    "it was also shown that our spectroscopic temperatures for the subgiants would be @xmath1550 k cooler if we considered the photometric temperatures as the correct  scale .",
    "this would result in underestimated abundances by 0.05 dex at most .",
    "therefore , if possible systematic effects do exist in our metallicities ( which does not seem to be true ) , they would not change the main point of the above discussion : the average metallicities of dwarfs and subgiants are equal within the expected uncertainties .",
    "given the comparisons in the metallicity distributions ( primarily from but also from lines ) between the dwarf , subgiant , and giant samples discussed here , it is important to assess non - lte and line - formation as a function of t@xmath47 , surface gravity , and stellar metallicity . within the homogeneous lte analysis conducted in this study ,",
    "planet - hosting dwarf and subgiant stars display the same [ fe / h ] distributions , while there is an overall difference of @xmath15 0.2 dex in the fe - abundance distributions of dwarfs and subgiants with planets when compared to giants with planets .",
    "could this difference be due simply to different non - lte effects between dwarfs / subgiants and giants ?",
    "non - lte calculations for iron contain uncertainties due to such quantities as electronic collisional cross - sections , in particular for dipole - forbidden transitions ; photoionization cross - sections , in particular those from the excited states ; a treatment of upper states ( particularly those for which no laboratory - measured energies are available ) ; recombination to the upper levels ; a treatment of autoionizing levels and related photoionization resonances ; and , most importantly , uncertainties due to treatment of collisions with neutral hydrogen atoms , which are poorly known ( hubeny 2010 , private communication ) . within these uncertainties , however , results from non - lte calculations in cool stars ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) generally find that departures from lte become larger in very metal poor stars , evolved stars , and stars with effective temperatures t@xmath48 6000 k. in the temperature and gravity regimes considered here , non - lte departures are much less important for lines , which are generally found to be closer to lte",
    ".    certain studies of non - lte in and find rather small departures from lte , even in rather metal - poor stars , such as globular cluster stars .",
    "for example , @xcite analyze main - sequence turn - off stars , subgiants , and giants in the globular cluster ngc 6397 ( with [ fe / h]= -2.35 ) and find total corrections to lte of of only 0.03 - 0.05 dex , with no differential non - lte effects between the main - sequence turn - off and giant stars . a more recent analysis of this cluster by @xcite notes that such small corrections found by @xcite were probably due to their adoption of rather high efficiencies of collisions between iron atoms and neutral hydrogen atoms , as paramaterized by the h i collision enhancement factor of s@xmath49 = 3 .",
    "given that one of the major uncertainties in non - lte calculations , as discussed above , is the efficiency of collisions of with neutral hydrogen , @xcite present results for h i collision enhancement factors , s@xmath49 , varying between 0 ( which corresponds to the strongest non - lte case ) and 2 ( corresponding to a situation closer to lte ) , as well as lte .",
    "figure 1 in their study illustrates differences between non - lte and abundances for 4 different stars : procyon ( t@xmath47 = 6510 k , log g = 3.96 , [ fe / h ] = -0.10 ) , @xmath50 vir ( t@xmath47 = 6060 k , log g = 4.11 , [ fe / h ] = + 0.04 ) , @xmath51 cet ( t@xmath47 = 5377 k , log g = 4.53 , [ fe / h ] = -0.43 ) , and hd 84937 ( t@xmath47 = 6350 k , log g = 4.00 , [ fe / h ] = -1.94 ) .",
    "it is clear from this figure that non - lte abundances of the most metal poor stars in the sample can be affected by as much as 0.15 dex when s@xmath49 = 0 , however this is only for the most metal - poor star in the sample , hd 84937 ; the effect of non - lte on decreases significantly for increasing metallicities , due to increasing electron densities .",
    "in addition , values of s@xmath49 as low as 0.1 lead to very small non - lte corrections for for all stars .",
    "although uncertain , the value s@xmath49=0.1 is favored ( @xcite ) and this would suggest that differences in the iron abundances between the samples of near - solar metallcity dwarfs , subgiants , and giants caused by non - lte corrections would be less than 0.1 dex .",
    "the calculations presented in @xcite predict that non - lte corrections for increase strongly with decreasing metallicity and , therefore , should be minimal at solar metallicities .",
    "in addition , the corrections become increasingly important for effective temperatures greater than t@xmath47 = 6000 k , as well as log g @xmath52 2.00 . the sample analyzed here",
    "is dominated by stars with log g @xmath53 2.00 , t@xmath47 = 4500 - 6000 k , and near - solar metallicities , where the predicted effects on are less than 0.1 dex .",
    "more recent results presented in @xcite increase the number of stars to five and indicate that lte can be considered as good as non - ltefor s@xmath49 @xmath54 0.1 and metallicities between solar and -0.5 dex , based on the analysis of stars such as procyon and @xmath51 cet . with values of s@xmath55 0.1 , combined with the points described above , lte abundances from and are expected to be be very close to those derived from non - lte ( within hundreths of a dex ) for the samples of stars with planets studied here .",
    "the theoretically predicted small non - lte effects on described above for near - solar metallicity stars are born out by observations of real stars in clusters which contain uniform fe abundances .",
    "one recent result relevant to this discussion is the abundance analysis of giants , subgiants , and main - sequence stars from a number of open clusters by @xcite , as well as the results from the analysis of main - sequence turn - off stars , subgiants , and giants in the globular cluster m71 ( one of the more metal - rich globular clusters ) by @xcite . a short summary of these studies would note that no significant abundance differences ( i.e. , @xmath43[fe / h ] @xmath53 0.05 dex ) were found in lte analyses of lines between stars with t@xmath56 60006100 k and log g @xmath15 4.24.6 when compared to those with t@xmath56 45004600 k and log g @xmath15 1.72.5 in any of the studied clusters .",
    "iron abundances from these studies are illustrated in figure [ clusters ] for the globular cluster m71 ( @xcite ) and the open clusters ngc 2682 and ic 4651 ( @xcite ) ; these particular clusters are shown as the numbers of stars studied in each cluster were the largest , and the clusters span a range in [ fe / h ] overlapping that of the sample stars included here .",
    "the top panel shows fe abundances ( as [ fe / h ] ) plotted versus t@xmath47 and the bottom panel is [ fe / h ] versus log g. the points are average values for stars found along the major phases of stellar evolution ( main sequence , turn - off , subgiant and giant branches ) , with the standard deviations in [ fe / h ] , t@xmath47 , and log g shown for each sub - sample .",
    "linear least - squares fits were carried out for each cluster and the derived slopes are labelled .",
    "for the near - solar metallicity open clusters , in particular , the slopes are very small and not significant indicating a good agreement between the lte fe abundances in dwarfs and giants .",
    "another piece of evidence that the fe abundances of the stars analyzed here are not affected by significant non - lte effects is the comparison of stellar surface gravities derived from the enforcement of lte ionization equilibrium between and , with surface gravities derived from fitting stellar models to luminosities obtained from hipparcos parallaxes ( so - called hipparcos gravities ) , as illustrated here in figure [ loggs ] .",
    "if fe i and/or fe ii suffer from significant departures from lte , gravities may be adversely affected .",
    "the mean difference in log g between these methods for subgiants and giants is log g@xmath57 log g@xmath580.12 dex .",
    "the standard deviation in this difference compares well with the expected uncertainty in defining log g by any method , while the small offset of 0.04 dex indicates excellent agreement between the two surface gravity methods .",
    "this small difference indicates that there are not significant departures from lte populations in and in the line - forming regions of near - solar metallicity dwarfs , subgiants , and giants in the t@xmath47 and log g regimes analyzed here .",
    "as the analysis of all stars in the present study was done in a strictly homogeneous manner , when coupled to the predictions that non - lte corrections to in near - solar metallicity dwarfs and giants with the range of stellar parameters studied here will be small ( much less than 0.1 dex ) , and the observations of rather uniform lte iron abundances derived in cluster dwarfs and giants , it is unlikely that non - lte departures can explain the differences observed here in the iron abundances of dwarfs and subgiants with planets , when compared to giants with planets ( @xmath15 0.2 dex ) .      the fact that the metallicity distribution of giant stars with planets in our sample is generally more metal poor than the metallicity distribution found for the dwarfs can not be explained in terms of galactic chemical evolution , as these results are opposite from what would be expected from chemical evolution : the giant sample stars being younger ( on average ) than the sample dwarfs would be more metal rich if one considers the effects of an age - metallicity relation .",
    "@xcite propose , on the other hand , that the difference in the metallicity distributions of dwarfs and giants with planets is not related to the formation process of giants planets themselves , but results from a galactic effect instead .",
    "his conclusions are based on ages and metallicities of sample giants and dwarfs analyzed by @xcite and @xcite . as radial mixing",
    "is a secular process , the sample of giants would be less contaminated by old , metal - rich wanderers of the inner disk .",
    "this scenario would only hold , however , if stars from the inner disk have a higher percentage of giant planets than stars born at the solar radius and assumes a metallicity gradient for the galactic disk .",
    "a relevant question concerning metallicity distributions of planet hosting stars in different evolutionary stages connects the possibility of late accretion of metal rich material onto the star to the dilution of this abundance signature as the star develops a deeper convective envelope .",
    "the expectation in such a scenario would be that the metal rich signature which is due to accretion would vanish as stars become giants ; their convective zones become larger and the metal rich material becomes diluted .",
    "if the high metallicity observed for the main - sequence stars hosting giant planets is indeed restricted to the outer envelope it is expected that subgiants will have a systematically lower metallicity than the dwarfs",
    ".    taken at face value , the metallicity distributions of planet hosting dwarfs , subgiants and giants obtained in this study are not in line with the dilution picture as there is not a consistent decrease in the average metallicities for planet - hosting stars going from dwarfs ( + 0.11 dex ) to subgiants ( + 0.12 dex ) , to giants ( -0.06 dex ) ; in particular between the dwarfs and subgiants . in addition , the absence of a trend in the plot of effective temperature versus stellar metallicity for sample subgiants ( shown in figure [ feh_versus_teff ] ) indicates the absence of dilution on the subgiant branch .",
    "a trend in the run of metallicity with effective temperature would be expected if the stars experienced increased dilution as they evolve redward on the subgiant branch , but this gradient is flat",
    ". the giants in our sample which are at the base of the red giant branch ( with @xmath59 ; see figure [ mbol_teff ] ) , are also shown in figure [ feh_versus_teff ] as it is at this stage that the convective zone deepens significantly .",
    "note that a similar range in metallicity ( roughly between [ fe / h]= -0.3 to + 0.3 dex ) is encompassed by the subgiants and giants in the figure , which indicates no significant differences between the metallicities of subgiants and giants at the base of the rgb .",
    "this result is in agreement with the findings of @xcite who also do not find a metallicity gradient as a function of @xmath28 along the subgiant branch and conclude that subgiants do not exhibit any evidence for dilution .    without evidence for dilution along the subgiant branch , the observations point to a scenario to explain the more metal poor distribution observed for giant stars in comparison with dwarfs which",
    "is related to the fact that the higher masses of the giant stars compensate for the lower metallicities by allowing , or favoring , the formation of planets because higher mass stars have on average disks with larger masses .",
    "a number of studies ( e.g. @xcite ) find that disk mass increases with stellar mass . as disk mass increases , the surface density ( @xmath60 ) within typical protoplanetary disks also increases and larger values of @xmath60",
    "favor the formation of giant planets in the core accretion model of planetary formation ( @xcite ; @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "the precipitation of a substantial planetary core which begins to accrete gas requires a threshold density of solid material ( which consists of the heavier elements , or metals ) .",
    "the observation that the average metallicity of planet - hosting stars is related to the average mass within a stellar sample , with giants representing the more massive but lower metallicity population , is taken as an observational signature of core - accretion as the main mechanism for planetary formation , at least for planets which form relatively close to their parent stars . the disk instability mechanism",
    "( see review by @xcite ) may still be important for the massive planets which form at large distances from their parent stars .",
    "examples of such systems may be the recently imaged planets found around hr 8799 ( @xcite ) and fomalhaut ( @xcite ) .",
    "the nature of planetary system architectures is quite likely a function of both stellar mass and metallicity .",
    "it is now well established that stars hosting giant planets have on average higher metallicities than stars which do not host closely orbiting giant planets ( see , e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "so far , however , most of the studies have concentrated on host stars which are on the main sequence .",
    "such a finding was recently corroborated from metallicities obtained in the homogeneous analysis of a large sample of main - sequence planet hosts and a control sample of stars without closely orbiting giant planets , which was presented in .",
    "the present study extends the main - sequence sample in by adding planet hosting stars which are evolved from the main sequence .",
    "we have determined stellar parameters and metallicities for a sample of 15 subgiants and 16 giants with planets discovered via radial velocity surveys and 14 comparison subgiants which have been found to exhibit nearly constant radial velocities and are not likely to host large , closely orbiting planets .",
    "the stellar parameters and iron abundances were derived from a classical spectroscopic analysis ( similar to ) .",
    "\\1 ) one strong point of the present study is the strictly homogeneous abundance analyses performed for the samples of dwarfs ( ) , subgiants and giants .",
    "an additional important aspect is the sample of disk subgiant stars which are known to be rv stable ( @xcite ) and can be used as a comparison sample for the subgiant planet - hosting stars .",
    "\\2 ) the subgiant sample in this study is found to be a slightly older population which has evolved mostly from the same underlying population as the dwarfs analyzed in ; the sample dwarfs and subgiants have significant overlap in their mass ranges .",
    "the sample giants , however , are evolved from stars which are more massive and are , on average , the youngest of all studied targets .",
    "\\3 ) the metallicity distribution obtained for our sample of 16 giant planet - hosting stars displays an average that is more metal poor by 0.17 dex than the metallicity distribution obtained in for the sample of planet - hosting dwarfs ( n=117 ) .",
    "when literature iron abundance results for all other presently known giant planet - hosting stars are included , in order to improve the giant star statistics to a total of 37 stars , the offset in the average metallicities between dwarf and giant planet - hosting stars is confirmed and becomes marginally larger ( 0.23 dex ) .",
    "\\4 ) the average metallicity of the planet - hosting subgiant sample is metal - rich relative to the sun , @xmath61\\rangle$ ] = + 0.12 dex .",
    "the latter distribution is similar to that obtained for the planet hosting dwarf sample , and on average more metal rich than that of subgiants without planets by 0.21 dex .",
    "this abundance difference between the subgiants with and without planets is in general agreement , within the uncertainties , with the abundance shift that is found for dwarfs with and without planets .",
    "\\5 ) the absence of a trend in the derived iron abundances with effective temperature for the sample subgiant stars shows no evidence for dilution on the subgiant branch .",
    "this flat gradient plus the fact that there is not a significant difference between the metallicity distributions of subgiant planet - hosting stars in comparison to dwarf planet - hosting stars , as would be expected from the more extended convective envelopes of subgiants in comparison with dwarfs , weakens the possibility of dilution as a viable explanation for the lower metallicity found for the giant stars .",
    "\\6 ) in the absence of substantial evidence for the dilution of accreted metal - rich material , the results in this study favor a scenario to explain the more metal poor distribution observed for giant stars in comparison with that of dwarfs which is related to the fact that the higher masses of the giant stars compensate for the lower metallicities , as higher mass stars have on average more massive disks with more metals available for planet formation through core accretion .",

    "<S> the analysis is done using the same technique as for our previous analysis of a large sample of planet - hosting and control sample dwarf stars . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison between the distributions of [ fe / h ] in planet - hosting main - sequence stars , subgiants , and giants within these samples finds that the main - sequence stars and subgiants have the same mean metallicity of @xmath0[fe / h]@xmath1 + 0.11 dex , while the giant sample is typically more metal poor , having an average metallicity of [ fe / h]=@xmath20.06 dex . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the subgiants have the same average metallicities as the dwarfs indicates that significant accretion of solid metal - rich material onto the planet - hosting stars has not taken place , as such material would be diluted in the evolution from dwarf to subgiant . </S>",
    "<S> the lower metallicity found for the planet - hosting giant stars in comparison with the planet - hosting dwarfs and subgiants is interpreted as being related to the underlying stellar mass , with giants having larger masses and thus , on average larger - mass protoplanetary disks . in core accretion models of planet formation , larger disk masses can contain the critical amount of metals necessary to form giant planets even at lower metallicities . </S>"
