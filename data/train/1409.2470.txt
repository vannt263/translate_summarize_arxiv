    "in the current paper we explore perpendicular diffusion of energetic particles such as cosmic rays due to the interaction with turbulent magnetic fields .",
    "the perpendicular diffusion coefficient is one of the elements entering the cosmic ray transport equation . in general , the diffusion of energetic particles is important to understand different processes in space and astrophysics .",
    "some examples which were discussed more recently in the literature are :    * the acceleration of particles due to turbulence ( see lynn et al .",
    "2014 ) . * shock acceleration at interplanetary shocks ( see li et al . 2012 , wang et al .",
    "* solar modulation studies ( see alania et al . 2013 , engelbrecht & burger 2013 , manuel et al . 2014 , potgieter et al . 2014 ) .",
    "* the motion of cosmic rays in our own and in external galaxies ( see buffie et al .",
    "2013 , berkhuijsen et al .",
    "2013 ) . * diffusive shock acceleration in supernova remnants ( see ferrand et al .",
    "2014 ) .    in the current article",
    "we explore perpendicular transport analytically and numerically for a specific turbulence model .    in the solar system , for instance",
    ", energetic particles interact with the solar wind plasma and , therefore , they are scattered .",
    "spatial diffusion is mainly caused due turbulent magnetic fields @xmath0 .",
    "in addition to such fields we also find an ordered magnetic field @xmath1 which breaks the symmetry of the considered physical system .",
    "therefore , we have to distinguish between diffusion of particles along and across the ordered magnetic field which can also be called the mean magnetic field .    especially diffusion across this field , also called perpendicular diffusion , is very difficult to describe analytically ( see shalchi 2009 for a review ) .",
    "more than a decade ago some progress has been achieved due to the development of the non - linear guiding center ( nlgc ) theory of matthaeus et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and more recently the unified non - linear transport ( unlt ) theory was presented in shalchi ( 2010 ) . the latter theory contains the nlgc theory , the field line transport theory of matthaeus et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , and the quasi - linear theory of jokipii ( 1966 ) as special limits .",
    "furthermore , the theory automatically provides a subdiffusive result for magnetostatic slab turbulence in agreement with the theorem on reduced dimensionality ( see jokipii et al .",
    "1993 and jones et al . 1998 ) and computer simulations ( see , e.g. , qin et al . 2002 ) .    in order to compute the perpendicular diffusion coefficient based on the aforementioned transport theories , one has to employ a certain turbulence model .",
    "previous models for which the perpendicular diffusion coefficient was calculated are the slab/2d composite model ( sometimes called two - component model ) and the goldreich - sridhar model ( see , e.g. , tautz & shalchi 2011 and shalchi 2013a ) . in the current paper",
    "we employ another model which was proposed recently , namely the model of _ noisy reduced magnetohydrodynamic ( nrmhd ) turbulence _ of ruffolo & matthaeus ( 2013 ) .    in the present paper",
    "we explore perpendicular diffusion in nrmhd turbulence analytically and numerically . by doing this",
    "we try to achieve the following :    1 .",
    "we show how the field line random walk limit with the correct field line diffusion coefficient can be obtained from the unlt theory .",
    "2 .   the first time we obtain the perpendicular diffusion coefficient of energetic particles for nrmhd turbulence .",
    "we test the validity of nlgc and unlt theories by comparing them with test - particle simulations in order to check our understanding of perpendicular diffusion .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly present the nlgc theory as well as the unlt theory .",
    "a discussion of the nrmhd turbulence model is given in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we compute the perpendicular diffusion coefficient analytically and in section 5 we use the simulations to test our analytical findings .",
    "we end with a short summary and some conclusions in section 6 .",
    "the analytical description of perpendicular diffusion is difficult ( see shalchi 2009 for a review ) since a quasilinear approximation is only valid in exceptional cases .",
    "a promising theory was proposed by matthaeus et al .",
    "( 2003 ) which is called the non - linear guiding center ( nlgc ) theory .",
    "the latter theory was compared with test - particle simulations and solar wind observations and agreement was often found ( see , e.g. , matthaeus et al .",
    "2003 , bieber et al .",
    "however , there are also problems with the theory such as the fact that the theory does not provide subdiffusive transport for slab turbulence ( see shalchi 2009 , tautz & shalchi 2011 ) .",
    "therefore , different extensions of the nlgc theory were proposed .",
    "one example is the extended non - linear guiding center ( enlgc ) proposed by shalchi ( 2006 ) .",
    "this theory was explicitly developed to handle perpendicular transport in slab/2d composite turbulence and provides the correct subdiffusive behavior for the pure slab case .",
    "alternative approaches were proposed thereafter ( see , e.g. , qin 2007 , ghilea et al .",
    "2011 , and ruffolo et al .",
    "all these approaches are basically extensions of the original nlgc theory .",
    "a very different approach was proposed by shalchi ( 2010 ) , namely the unified non - linear ( unlt ) transport theory .",
    "the main problem in analytical theories for perpendicular diffusion is the emergence of 4th order correlation functions . in the nlgc theory and the aforementioned extensions ,",
    "such 4th order correlations are approximated by a produced of two 2nd order correlations .",
    "the 2nd order correlations are then approximated by different models such as a diffusion model ( matthaeus et al .",
    "2003 , shalchi 2006 ) or a random ballistic model ( ghilea et al .",
    "2011 , ruffolo et al .",
    "the unlt theory is based on the direct evaluation of 4th order correlations by using the ( pitch - angle dependent ) fokker - planck equation .",
    "the unlt theory correctly describes subdiffusive transport in slab turbulence and contains the correct flrw limit without specifying the turbulence properties ( see , e.g. , shalchi 2014 ) .",
    "it also contains the nlgc theory and the field line diffusion theory of matthaeus et al .",
    "( 1995 ) as special limits justifying the name unified non - linear transport theory .    in the current paper",
    "we compute the perpendicular diffusion coefficient based on the nlgc theory and the unlt theory . in the following two paragraphs",
    "these two theories are discussed .      in matthaeus",
    "et al . ( 2003 ) the so - called non - linear guiding center ( nlgc ) theory was derived .",
    "the latter theory is based on several assumptions leading to the following non - linear integral equation for the perpendicular diffusion coefficient _ = d^3 k .",
    "[ nlgc ] here we used the wavevector @xmath2 , the magnetic correlation tensor p_mn ( ) = , [ bbcorr ] the parallel diffusion coefficient of the particle @xmath3 , the parallel mean free path @xmath4 , the mean magnetic field @xmath5 , and the particle speed @xmath6 .",
    "we have also used the parameter @xmath7 which is related to the probability that the particle is tied to a single magnetic field line .",
    "( [ nlgc ] ) was derived under the assumption that @xmath8 and that the turbulence is static .      because the nlgc theory is problematic in some cases",

    "the latter theory still provides a nonlinear integral equation for the perpendicular diffusion coefficient like the nlgc theory .",

    "however , the term ( [ defaaa ] ) in the unlt theory is completely different compared to the corresponding term in nlgc theory .",

    "all details can be found in the aforementioned paper . in the following",
    "we discuss some aspects of this model and its relation to two - dimensional turbulence .      in the following we discuss the magnetic correlation tensor ( [ bbcorr ] ) for the nrmhd model .",
    "according to ruffolo & matthaeus ( 2013 ) , the two relevant components of the magnetic correlation tensor have the form p_xx ( ) = k_y^2 a ( k _ ) \\ {    ccc 1 & if & | k _ | k + 0 & if & | k _",

    "compared to the tensor discussed in ruffolo & matthaeus ( 2013 ) , we have different prefactors in our model because we use a different form of the fourier - transform . as in ruffolo & matthaeus ( 2013 )",
    "we only consider the special case of axi - symmetric turbulence where the spectrum depends only on @xmath11 .",
    "we like to emphasize that @xmath12 in the model considered here and , therefore @xmath13 . before we discuss the spectrum @xmath14 we briefly think about the normalization . since we have to satisfy b^2 & = & b_x^2 + b_y^2 + & = & d^3 k + & = & _ 0^ d k _ k_^3 a ( k _ ) [ normal ] we can determine the constants in the spectrum @xmath14 .",
    "a key element in theories for particle transport and field line random walk is the turbulence spectrum . especially the large scales ( corresponding to small wavenumbers ) of the spectrum control field line diffusion coefficients and perpendicular diffusion coefficients of energetic particles ( see , e.g. , shalchi & kourakis 2007 , shalchi & weinhorst 2009 , minnie et al . 2009 , shalchi et al . 2010 ) . in the following",
