    "neutrinos have long been a rich hunting ground for physics beyond the standard model ( bsm ) .",
    "in fact , neutrino mass is so far the only bsm physics that has been established in laboratory experiments .",
    "astrophysical evidence of dark matter suggests the existence of bsm particles , which have nevertheless not been observed yet . among all feasible candidates , weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) are theoretically rather appealing .",
    "these may be observable through their interactions within detectors , as the earth moves through the sea of wimps .",
    "this possibility has triggered a cornucopia of experimental efforts of direct dark matter detection  @xcite .    in this letter",
    "we examine the physics potential of combining a liquid xenon ( lxe ) detector , designed to search for wimp dark matter , with an intense electron - capture neutrinos source in order to look for neutrino magnetic moments ( @xmath1 mm ) and other new physics in @xmath2 elastic scattering .",
    "the idea of looking for new physics in the neutrino sector using dark matter detectors has been proposed before in the literature , see for instance refs .",
    "direct dark matter detection relies on observing nuclear recoils with electron - equivalent energy down to @xmath3  kev . due to the small values expected for the dark matter interaction cross section ,",
    "large detector masses and low background levels are also required . a lxe time projection chamber ( tpc )",
    "can provide a large volume , low detection thresholds ( sub - kev ) and a very low background rate at the energies of interest . at the same time the electron density is higher in xenon than in any other stable noble gas , thus providing the largest possible target density in any given volume near the source .",
    "the idea of using liquid noble gas detectors to search for @xmath1 mm was first suggested by vogel and engel  @xcite , but never developed . as a by - product",
    "we also find non - negligible sensitivity to sterile neutrino oscillations in the @xmath41  ev@xmath5 range suggested by recent terrestrial experiments  @xcite .",
    "when a nucleus decays via electron - capture almost all of the available energy goes into a mono - energetic neutrino . among possible nuclei which decay via electron - capture",
    ", @xmath6cr  offers several practical advantages : it is readily produced by thermal neutron capture  @xcite , has a mean lifetime of 39.96  days and produces two mono - energetic neutrino lines at 750  kev ( 90% ) and 430  kev ( 10% ) .",
    "mega - curie - scale @xmath6cr  sources have been produced in the past and used to calibrate the gallium radiochemical solar neutrino detectors gallex  @xcite and sage  @xcite .",
    "in the presence of a @xmath1 mm , the differential cross section for @xmath2 elastic scattering can be written as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the electron mass , @xmath9 is the electron recoil energy , @xmath10 is the neutrino energy and @xmath11 is the @xmath1 mm in bohr magnetons ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath11 produces an increase in the number of events at low electron recoil energies .",
    "this makes two - phase lxe tpcs  @xcite , with their low - energy detection threshold , ideal detectors for such a search .",
    "currently , the lowest bounds on @xmath1 mm come from astrophysical observations  @xcite : @xmath13 .",
    "the best constraint from terrestrial experiments , on the other hand , has been obtained by the gemma experiment , @xmath14 at 90% cl  @xcite . in the sm ,",
    "@xmath1mms are expected to be many orders of magnitude below present bounds , yet many extensions of the sm produce an enhancement of the @xmath1 mm , see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein .        for our sensitivity estimate",
    ", we assume a data taking period of 100  days , using a @xmath6cr  source with initial strength of 5  mci .",
    "our choice for the strength of the source is based on simulations conducted for the sox experiment  @xcite of the gallex enriched @xmath15cr material  @xcite irradiated in the high flux isotope reactor at oak ridge national laboratory .",
    "we consider a generic lxe detector , but for definiteness we chose a design similar to the proposed lz detector  @xcite .",
    "we assume a cylindrical fiducial volume with equal diameter and height , @xmath16  m , which contains @xmath17  tons of lxe , and we assume that the radioactive source is placed 1  m below the fiducial volume , along the central axis of the cylinder .",
    "neutrinos are detected via electron elastic scattering in the detector , see eq .",
    "[ eq : xsecmu ] . under these assumptions ,",
    "a total of @xmath18 signal events are expected for a 100  day run .",
    "regarding backgrounds , we have considered contributions from solar neutrino interactions , @xmath19rn  and @xmath20kr  decay , and the @xmath21xe  @xmath22  decay . following ref .",
    "@xcite , the solar neutrino background is estimated to be 1.05 counts per ton and day for @xmath23 neutrinos and 0.51 counts per ton and day for @xmath24be neutrinos .",
    "the @xmath20kr  and @xmath21xe  backgrounds have been taken directly from fig .  2 in ref .",
    "@xcite and rescaled according to our run length and detector mass , while for @xmath19rn  we assume that a goal of 0.1  @xmath25bq / kg can be achieved  @xcite , about a factor of 30 reduction with respect to what has been achieved for exo-200  @xcite .",
    "finally , an important source of background could come from the source itself . in 10% of @xmath6cr",
    "decays there is a 320  kev gamma , which can easily be shielded with just a few cm of tungsten .",
    "however , impurities present in the chromium prior to irradiation , can lead to the production of mev gamma emitters  @xcite",
    ". these will require significant additional shielding to be reduced down to an acceptable level .",
    "we base our calculation of this background on the measured gamma activity of the gallex source  @xcite .",
    "our source is assumed to be shielded by a 17  cm thick tungsten layer , which , when combined with 70  cm of lxe ( present between the tungsten shield and the edge of the detector ) , provides an attenuation of @xmath26 for a 1.5  mev gamma .",
    "nevertheless , with @xmath27 gammas emitted per day ( in all directions ) , we expect about 10 to pass through the shielding and compton scatter in the detector fiducial volume .",
    "most of these would deposit energy in excess of the maximum from a @xmath6cr  neutrino , though .",
    "further suppression could come from a veto on mulit - site compton scattering events .",
    "we estimate the surviving background in the fiducial volume from source gammas to be less than 1 event per day at the start of the data taking , and , since @xmath2895% of mev gammas come from short - lived isotopes ( such as @xmath29cu , @xmath30ge and @xmath31na ) , this rate should rapidly decay with time .",
    "therefore , we will neglect these events in our analysis , but we note that care must be taken in the preparation of the @xmath15cr source material to ensure the required level of purity is reached .    to constrain the @xmath1 mm ,",
    "the analysis is done in terms of the recoil energy of the electron only .",
    "the recoil energies are smeared on an event - by - event basis according to a gaussian with @xmath32 . generally , we find that the energy resolution does not have a significant impact on the @xmath1 mm sensitivity .",
    "a poissonian @xmath33 is constructed using 0.1  kev wide bins in @xmath9 , from 2  kev to 140  kev unless otherwise stated . in this energy range",
    "a total of @xmath34 signal events are expected , together with a total of @xmath35 background events .",
    "the distribution of signal and background events in electron recoil energy is shown in fig .  [ fig : mu ] ( left ) .",
    "reducing the backgrounds does not significantly improve the sensitivity to this observable since in the low - energy region , where the @xmath1 mm enhancement is expected , the background rate is already quite low . on the other hand , we find the low - energy threshold to be the most relevant parameter in this analysis ( as expected from eq .",
    "[ eq : xsecmu ] ) .",
    "[ fig : mu ] ( right ) shows the dependence of the sensitivity as a function of detector threshold . with a fairly conservative threshold of 2",
    "kev the 95% cl bound is @xmath36 .",
    "such values would yield an improvement of a factor of 5 over the currently best terrestrial limit .",
    "a second possible application of the setup studied here would be the search for light sterile neutrinos .",
    "sterile neutrinos arise in most models of neutrino mass generation",
    ". searches for oscillations between active and sterile neutrinos have been conducted using many combinations of neutrino sources , detectors and oscillation channels  @xcite .",
    "experimental results are inconclusive , with strong tension between different data sets ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , refs .",
    "in particular , an analysis of gallex and sage data shows an apparent deficit of events which is consistent with oscillations involving a sterile neutrino with a squared mass difference with the active states @xmath37 and a mixing angle such that @xmath38  @xcite , which is commonly referred to as the _ gallium anomaly_. the smoking gun of a sterile neutrino would be to observe events following an oscillating pattern in @xmath39 , the distance traveled by the neutrino divided by its energy . a monochromatic neutrino source reduces the oscillating pattern to a pure function of @xmath40 . given the energy of the primary @xmath6cr  neutrino the oscillation length at @xmath41 would be @xmath42 90  cm and thus the oscillating pattern would be observable _ inside _ a meter - scale detector .",
    "the expected spatial resolution in lxe tpcs is at the sub - cm level , which makes them ideal candidates for such an experiment .    in our analysis , we have adopted a phenomenological approach based on a 3 + 1 framework , where there is only one extra sterile state at the ev scale . in this framework , the @xmath0 disappearance oscillation probability can be expressed in terms of one mixing angle and one mass squared splitting only , as : @xmath43 where @xmath10 is the neutrino energy , @xmath40 is the distance between the source and the interaction point in the detector , @xmath44 and @xmath45 is an effective mixing angle .",
    "the sensitivity to sterile neutrino oscillations is computed using the distance between the source and the interaction point ( @xmath40 ) as the main variable in the analysis .",
    "a binned gaussian @xmath33 is built using 3  cm wide bins .",
    "the detector is assumed to have a constant spatial resolution of 1  cm ; however , the largest uncertainty in @xmath40 comes from the shape and size of the radioactive source itself . in the present work",
    ", we assume that the source will be a cylinder with both height and diameter equal to 14  cm .",
    "to achieve such a compact source will require that the chromium material be enriched to @xmath2895% in @xmath15cr .",
    "this is much higher than what was achieved by gallex  @xcite , but similar to what was reached by sage  @xcite .",
    "a smearing function was generated , by a monte carlo calculation , that simultaneously accounts for the finite source size and the detector resolution .",
    "two nuisance parameters are added to the @xmath33 for signal and background normalization uncertainties .",
    "a gaussian penalty term ( or pull - term ) is added to the @xmath33 for the background uncertainty and marginalization is performed over both nuisance parameters . unless otherwise stated , no constraint is assumed for the flux normalization and it is therefore left completely free during the fit . for the backgrounds ,",
    "an uncertainty of 0.5% is assumed .",
    "we expect this could be achieved by using the data collected during the source - free operation of the detector corresponding to the the dark matter search .",
    "the process is repeated for each point in the @xmath46 parameter space . since the low - end threshold for the electron recoil energy is not expected to have a great impact on the sterile neutrino analysis , it is set to 5  kev in this case .",
    "the results for the sterile neutrino sensitivity are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sterile ] .",
    "since the sensitivity mainly comes from a shape analysis , this measurement is far from being limited by systematics .",
    "we find the main limiting factor to be the @xmath21xe  background .",
    "the expected number of background events ( across the full energy range ) is around 51,130 , from which around 44,000 are from @xmath21xe  @xmath22  decays .",
    "this background can be reduced by using lxe depleted in @xmath21xe , though .",
    "the sensitivities for both possibilities are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sterile ] ( left ) .",
    "for contrast , we also compare the lxe sensitivity to that of borexino / sox  @xcite using a comparable , 5  mci @xmath6cr  source ( the sox proposal is based on 10  mci ) .",
    "the complementarity in @xmath47 coverage of the two experiments is evident . in the case of lxe , the relatively high spatial resolution improves sensitivity at high @xmath47 , while for sox , the relatively large detector volume , or range in @xmath40 , improves the reach at low @xmath47 .",
    "it is remarkable that , for a depleted xe experiment , most of the region favored by the gallium anomaly is covered with _",
    "shape information alone_. therefore , if the gallium anomaly is correct this configuration would , with high likelihood , confirm it by a clear observation of the oscillatory pattern .",
    "both the sterile neutrino and @xmath1 mm searches are statistics limited and would be improved by repeated redeployments of the @xmath6cr  source .",
    "repeated deployment has a precedent in gallex , which irradiated and deployed the same source material twice  @xcite .",
    "we will consider five deployments , each identical in source strength and duration to our previously considered single deployment .    in the case of the @xmath1 mm search ,",
    "the sensitivity with increased statistics is remarkable . at 95% cl , assuming a low - energy threshold of 2  kev , the corresponding bound is pushed down to @xmath48 .",
    "if a lower threshold can be achieved , even the astrophysical limit would be surpassed .",
    "the sensitivity to sterile neutrino oscillations with increased statistics is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sterile ] ( right ) . in this case",
    ", we assume 90% depleted xe , and show sensitivities from both a shape - only analysis , and an analysis with the shape information plus a 2% uncertainty in the normalization .",
    "as can be seen in the comparison of the two bounds , no major improvement is expected from imposing the normalization constraint , since the information comes from observing the oscillating pattern in the detector . only in case of large @xmath49 , where the oscillation is averaged out ,",
    "would a normalization constraint help . according to our results , after five deployments the full gallium anomaly as well as a sizable region of the reactor anomaly would be covered at 95% cl .    obviously ,",
    "with 10,000 - 50,000 @xmath2 elastic scattering events with momentum transfers in the 100kev range a number of precision tests of the electro - weak sector of the sm become possible .",
    "assuming an absolute normalization at the 1% level and statistical errors at or below 1% , overall accuracies for the total cross section of 1 - 2% appear feasible , providing constraints on the weak mixing angle and its running .",
    "to summarize , our results indicate that the combination of a large liquid xenon detector , designed and built to search for dark matter , with a mega - curie scale electron capture neutrino source would provide excellent reach in the search for the neutrino magnetic moment , exceeding the current laboratory bounds by at least a factor of 5 . with repeated source deployments , such an experiment would even be competitive with the best astrophysical limits .",
    "moreover , this combination would allow a test of the reactor and gallium anomalies ; specifically , their interpretation as oscillations due to an ev - scale sterile neutrino .",
    "its reach would be complementary to other source proposals with sensitivity to the oscillating pattern over almost the entire interesting range of @xmath47 .",
    "clearly , a detailed technical feasibility study is required , but so far no major technological obstacles have been identified .",
