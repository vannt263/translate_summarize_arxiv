    "a research program in low energy neutrino and astroparticle physics is being pursued at the kuo - sheng(ks ) reactor laboratory@xcite .",
    "the ks laboratory is located 28  m from a 2.9  gw reactor core and has an overburden of about 30  meter - water - equivalent .",
    "its facilities were described in ref .",
    "@xcite , where limits on neutrino magnetic moments with a 1.06  kg germanium detector ( hpge ) at a hardware threshold of 5  kev were reported .",
    "the experimental procedures were well - established and the background were measured . in particular , a background level of @xmath1(cpd ) at 20  kev , comparable to those of underground cdm experiments , was achieved .",
    "the hpge data were also used in the studies of reactor electron neutrinos@xcite and for reactor axions searches@xcite .",
    "data taking and analysis are being conducted on a 200  kg csi(tl ) scintillating crystal detector array@xcite , towards the measurement of neutrino - electron scattering cross - section and therefore the electro - weak angle @xmath2 .",
    "the future scientific goals are to develop advanced detectors with kg - size target mass , 100  ev - range threshold and low - background specifications for wimp dark matter searches@xcite as well as the studies of neutrino - nucleus coherent scattering@xcite and neutrino magnetic moments@xcite .",
    "results from recent neutrino experiments provide strong evidence for neutrino oscillations due to finite neutrino masses and mixings@xcite . their physical origin and experimental consequences are not fully understood .",
    "experimental studies on the neutrino properties and interactions can shed light on these fundamental questions and constrain theoretical models , from which unexpected surprises may arise .",
    "it is therefore highly motivated to look for and establish alternatives of neutrino sources and detection channels , especially in regions of parameter space which are experimentally unexplored .",
    "one of the frontiers is to open the detector window in the previously unexplored low energy `` sub - kev '' regime .",
    "if experimentally realized , several important subjects in neutrino and astroparticle physics can be pursued .",
    "they are discussed in the following sub - sections .",
    "neutrino coherent scattering with the nucleus@xcite @xmath3 is a fundamental neutrino interaction which has never been observed .",
    "the standard model cross section for this process is given by : @xmath4 ^ 2 [ 1 -   \\frac{m_n t_n } { 2 e_{\\nu}^2 } ]   } \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\rm { \\sigma _ { tot } }    & = &   \\rm { \\frac { g_f^2   e_{\\nu}^2 } { 4 \\pi }   [ z ( 1 - 4 \\s2tw ) - n ] ^2   } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 , n and z are the mass , neutron number and atomic number of the nuclei , respectively , @xmath6 is the incident neutrino energy and @xmath7 is the measure - able recoil energy of the nucleus .",
    "this formula is applicable at @xmath8 where the momentum transfer ( @xmath9 ) is small such that @xmath10 , where r is the nuclear size .",
    "corrections due to nuclear form factors can be neglected at low energies : @xmath11 . the @xmath12n@xmath13 enhancement on the cross - sections signifies coherence .",
    "+    measurement of the coherent scattering cross - section would provide a sensitive test to the standard model@xcite probing the weak nuclear charge and radiative corrections due to possible non - standard neutrino interactions or additional neutral gauge bosons .",
    "the coherent interaction plays important role in astrophysical processes where the neutrino - electron scatterings are suppressed due to fermi gas degeneracy .",
    "it is significant to the neutrino dynamics and energy transport in supernovae and neutrons stars@xcite .",
    "being a new detection channel for neutrinos , it may provide new approaches to study other aspects of neutrino physics .",
    "for instance , the detection of supernova neutrinos using this mode was recently discussed@xcite .",
    "coherent scattering with the nuclei is also the detection mechanism adopted in the direct dark matter searches@xcite , such that its observations and measurements with the known particle neutrino is an important milestone as well .",
    "furthermore , neutrino coherent scattering may be a promising avenue towards a compact and relatively transportable neutrino detector , an application of which can be for the real - time monitoring on the operation of nuclear reactors@xcite , a subject of paramount global importance in the non - proliferation of nuclear materials .",
    "nuclear power reactors are intense source of electron anti - neutrinos ( @xmath14 ) at the mev range , from which many important neutrino experiments were based .",
    "the @xmath14-spectra are well - modeled , while good experimental control is possible via the reactor on / off comparisons .",
    "the magnetic moment results at ks@xcite set the stage to pursue the studies of neutrino - nucleus coherent scatterings with reactor neutrinos@xcite .",
    "the maximum nuclear recoil energy at momentum transfer much larger than neutrino masses is given by : @xmath15 the maximum neutrino energy for the typical reactor @xmath14 spectra is about 8  mev , such that @xmath16 for ge target ( a=72.6 ) .",
    "the differential cross section for coherent scattering versus nuclear recoil energy with typical reactor @xmath14 spectra is displayed in figure  [ diffcs]a .",
    "overlaid for comparisons are the contributions due to neutrino - electron scatterings from the standard model and magnetic moment effects at the present limit , as well as the 1  cpd benchmark background level .    in ionization detectors like hpge ,",
    "the measure - able energy is only a fraction of the energy deposit for the nuclear recoil events which have large de / dx .",
    "the _ quenching factor ( qf ) _ , defined as the ratio of the measure - able to the deposit energy , is about 0.2 - 0.25 for ge in the @xmath1710  kev region@xcite . accordingly , the maximum measure - able energy for nuclear recoil events in ge due to reactor @xmath14 is about 400 - 500  ev .",
    "the event rates for neutrino - nucleus coherent scattering at different threshold and quenching factors at ks are depicted in figure  [ diffcs]b .",
    "the goals of the r&d program is to devise an experiment based on ge - detector with a mass range of 1  kg , a threshold as low as 100  ev , and an on - site background level of 1  cpd below 1  kev . at the typical qf=0.25 ,",
    "the event rate for such configurations will be 11  kg@xmath18day@xmath18 or 4000  kg@xmath18yr@xmath18 , at a signal - to - background ratio of @xmath1922 .",
    "neutrino magnetic moments ( @xmath20 ) are parameters characterizing the spin - dependent couplings of the neutrinos to the photons@xcite .",
    "a limit of @xmath21 at 90% confidence level ( cl ) has been achieved at ks - lab with a high - purity germanium detector at a threshold of 12  kev and a background level of 1  cpd@xcite .",
    "this result was further improved upon by the gemma experiment@xcite with a similar design but at a closer location to the reactor core .    a natural by - product of a detector with kg - mass , 100",
    "ev threshold and 1  cpd background level would be to further enhance the sensitivities of @xmath20-searches at reactors",
    ". the physics threshold can be as low as 500  ev just above the coherence scattering detectable energy cut - off .",
    "a finite @xmath20 will contribute to @xmath22-e scattering with a differential cross - section term given by : @xmath23 ~ . } \\ ] ] the effects are much enhanced at this sub - kev energy due to the 1/t dependence , as illustrated in figure  [ diffcs]a .",
    "an improved sensitivity range down to @xmath24 can be expected .",
    "there are compelling evidence that about 25% of the energy density in the universe is composed of cold dark matter@xcite due to a not - yet - identified particle , generically categorized as weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp , denoted by @xmath25 ) .",
    "a direct experimental detection of wimp is one of the biggest challenges in frontier astroparticle physics .",
    "the wimp will interact with matter pre - dominantly via the same coherent scattering mechanism like the neutrinos : @xmath26 the major difference is that cosmology dictates that the wimps should be massive and its motion non - relativistic to be consistent with the observational data on structure formation@xcite .",
    "in addition , it is possible to have a spin - dependent interaction between wimp and matter .",
    "supersymmetric ( susy ) particles@xcite are the leading wimp candidates .",
    "the popular susy models prefer wimp mass ( @xmath27 ) of the range of @xmath12100  gev , though light neutralinos remain a possibility@xcite .",
    "most experimental programs optimize their design in the high - mass region and exhibit diminishing sensitivities for @xmath28 , where there is an allowed region if the annual modulation data of the dama experiment@xcite are interpreted as wimp signatures .",
    "simple extensions of the standard model with a singlet scalar favors light wimps@xcite . to probe the low - mass region , detector with sub - kev threshold",
    "is necessary .",
    "such threshold will also allow the studies of wimps bound in the solar system@xcite , and non - pointlike susy candidates like q - balls@xcite , but presents a formidable challenge to detector technology and to background control .    in direct wimp",
    "search experiments , the observed nuclear recoil rate per unit detector mass ( @xmath29 ) at recoil energy @xmath7 is related to the elastic wimp - nucleon cross section ( @xmath30 ) and @xmath31 via@xcite :    @xmath32 ~",

    "the lower bound of the integral @xmath39 denotes the minimal wimp velocity necessary to kinematically induce a nuclear recoil interaction . the enhancement factor from nucleon to nucleus",
    "is denoted by @xmath40 , which is equal to @xmath41 due to coherent effects for spin - independent couplings . in the spin - dependent case@xcite , couplings of the wimps to protons and neutrons are in general different , depending on @xmath42 ^ 2   ( \\frac{j+1}{j } )   ~~ ; ~~",

    "the maximal wimp velocity of @xmath46 corresponds to a kinetic energy of @xmath47 and the maximal recoil energy at ge of @xmath48 .",
    "the uniqueness and advantages of having a low - threshold detector are twofold .",
    "firstly , wimps with lower masses become detectable at a lower threshold , as indicated in eq .",
    "[ eq::cswimp ] , thereby opening a new window of observation .",
    "secondly , the lower bound of the integral @xmath49 in eq .",
    "[ eq::cswimp ] , which represents the minimum velocity of a wimp that produces a recoil energy @xmath7 , is proportional to @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , a lower threshold allows a larger range of wimps to contribute in an observable interaction and hence results in better sensitivities for all values of @xmath31 .",
    "a summary of the sensitivities of the spin - independent cross - section ( @xmath50 ) versus @xmath31 is depicted in figure  [ cdmplot ] .",
    "the best sensitivities to date in the low wimp mass region ( @xmath51 ) are due to data taken at ks with a ultra - low - energy germanium prototype@xcite with threshold of 200  ev , superseding those from the previous cresst - i experiment@xcite with sapphire(@xmath52)-based cryogenic detector at a threshold of 600  ev . the other experiments defining the current boundaries@xcite as well as the dama - allowed regions@xcite are superimposed .",
    "the striped region is that favored by susy models@xcite .",
    "projected sensitivities of full - scale experiments are indicated as dotted lines .",
    "although the @xmath22n and @xmath25n cross - section of eq .  [ eq::cohsm ] is relatively large due to the respective n@xmath13 and a@xmath13 enhancement by coherence , the small kinetic energy from nuclear recoils poses severe experimental challenges both to the detector sensitivity and to background control .",
    "various detection schemes using cryogenic@xcite , gas@xcite or liquid - gas two phase@xcite detectors have been investigated taking reactor neutrinos as the source .",
    "there was a recent study on using neutrino beam from stopped - pion facilities@xcite .",
    "alternatively , germanium - based ionization detectors@xcite offer a more matured technology , less costly to build and to operate , more compact , and easier to scale - up .",
    "this detector technology has been widely and successfully used in various areas of low energy neutrino physics and cold dark matter searches .",
    "`` ultra - low - energy '' germanium ( ulege ) detectors , developed originally for soft x - rays detection , are candidate technologies to meet these challenges of probing into the previously unexplored low - energy domain .",
    "these detectors typically have modular mass of 5 - 10  grams while detector array of up to n=30 elements have been successfully built .",
    "various ulege prototypes@xcite were constructed in the course of our r&d program , the highlights of which are discussed in the following sections .",
    "complementary to these , measurements of qf in ge at the sub - kev range is pursued at a neutron facility , following the previous successful measurements of qf in csi(tl)@xcite .",
    "+      a typical measured energy spectrum ulege prototype is depicted in figure  [ fe55]a . pulsed optical feedback preamplifiers",
    "were used to extract the signals from the electron - hole pairs .",
    "the output was transferred to two amplifiers at 6  @xmath53s and 12  @xmath53s shaping time , and read out by a 20  mhz flash analogue digital convertor@xcite . the sampling period extended from t=-20  @xmath53 to 70  @xmath53s where t=0 was defined by the trigger instant .",
    "calibration was achieved by external @xmath54fe x - ray sources ( 5.90 and 6.49  kev ) together with x - rays from titanium ( 4.51 and 4.93  kev ) , calcium ( 3.69  kev ) and sulphur ( 2.31  kev ) .",
    "excellent linearity down to threshold was demonstrated with a test - pulser .",
    "a random trigger uncorrelated to the detector provided the dead time and efficiencies measurements as well as the zero - energy calibration .",
    "the electronic noise which defines the threshold can be suppressed by pulse shape discrimination ( psd ) through correlating the two output signals at the two shaping times , as illustrated in figure  [ fe55]b .",
    "a threshold of 200  ev at @xmath1250% selection efficiency@xcite was achieved .",
    "background studies were made with the prototypes at the ks reactor laboratory and at the yangyang underground laboratory ( y2l ) in south korea .",
    "the detectors were surrounded by active anti - compton crystal scintillator detectors , passive shieldings as well as active cosmic - ray veto scintillators @xmath0 identical to the those for the ks 1  kg hpge experiment@xcite .",
    "data were taken under different hardware and software configurations . the best spectrum in terms of background and threshold",
    "is shown in figure  [ ulegebkg ] , with those from cresst-1@xcite and the 1-kg hpge@xcite superimposed .",

    "inspired by a novel design in the 1980s@xcite , there are recent important advances in the construction of a single - element ulege of 500-g mass@xcite , with which a detector threshold of 300  ev was demonstrated .",
    "this offers great potentials of scaling - up the detector mass to the kg - range and beyond with simple electronics and data acquisition schemes .",
    "realistic simulations were performed on the behaviour of photons and neutrons with kg - scale ulege .",
    "the variations of the `` after - cut '' rates the with detector mass are depicted in figure  [ bkgmc]a .",
    "the mass - normalized count rates at low energy ( @xmath1710  kev ) under a constant external @xmath56-background decrease by a factor of 10 for increasing ge target mass from 5  g to 1  kg , due to self - absorption of the target .",
    "similar behaviour applies to neutron - induced background , though the difference is less .",
