    "pioneering works already estimated that at least 1/3 of all the spiral galaxies are liners ( heckman et al .",
    "if they represented the faint end of the agn luminosity distribution , their study would be crucial for the understanding of agn activity , in particular in our nearby universe .",
    "but still nowadays , there is an ongoing strong debate on the origin of the energy source in liners , with two main alternatives for the ionizing source : either it is a low luminosity agn , or it has a thermal origin related to massive star formation and/or from shock heating mechanisms resulting from the massive stars evolution .",
    "the search for a compact x - ray nucleus in liners is indeed one of the most convincing evidence about their agn nature .",
    "the catalogue by carrillo et al . ( 1999 ) provides 476 liners with information from radio to x - rays .",
    "our sample comprises all the liners in this catalogue with enough quality data ( at least 25 counts in the range 0.5 - 10 kev ) in chandra - acis archives , made public up to novembre 2004 .",
    "this sample amounts to 51 liners , which resulted to be representative of the bright optical liners ( see gonzlez - martn et al .",
    "2006 , for details ) .",
    "attending to their hard x - ray ( 4.5 - 8.0*kev band ) morphology the sample has been grouped into two categories : ( a ) * agn - like nuclei * , with unresolved nuclear point - like source , and ( b ) * starburst - like nuclei * , with no detection of a nuclear point - like source .    the spectra from 0.5 to 10 kev have been fitted .",
    "two models ( thermal and non - thermal ) , and their combination , were tested to account for the spectral emission of the 23 objects with enough s / n , including absorption ( phabs ) and using solar metallicities and @xmath0@xmath1 statistics .",
    "only one object can be better fitted with a pure thermal model , whereas for 7 of them a pure power law is a better description .",
    "a combination of thermal and non - thermal components is required in the remaining cases .",
    "the resulting median spectral parameters are kt=0.64@xmath2  kev and @xmath3=1.89@xmath4 .",
    "nuclear luminosities were calculated from the best - fit model for these 26 galaxies , or estimated assuming a power law of @xmath5 and galactic absorption for the remaining 28 galaxies , for which no spectral fitting is possible .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ( left ) shows that agn - like nuclei tend to be more luminous than sb - like nuclei .",
    "color - color ( c - c ) diagrams have been defined and optimized to estimate @xmath3 , kt , and n@xmath6 when the spectral fitting is not possible .",
    "fig [ fig : fig1 ] shows the comparison between estimated and fitted values . excepting three cases , the c - c diagrams provide a good t estimation , and @xmath3 results to be slightly underestimated .",
    "sharp - divided images of the objects with available hst imaging ( 43 galaxies ) are used to classify our sample liners into two groups : ( a ) compact nuclear sources ( 35 objects ) ; and ( b ) dusty nuclear regions ( 8) . all the galaxies classified as agn by the x - ray imaging analysis show compact nuclei at the resolution of hst images .",
    "from the x - ray analysis , about 60% of the liners in our sample are agn candidates .",
    "these objects are , on average , more luminous in x - rays ( 2 - 10 kev ) , but their luminosities share a large overlapping range with sb candidates .",
    "both the luminosities and the morphological classes generally agree with those in previous studies ( ho et al .",
    "2001 , satyapal et al .",
    "2004 , 2005 , flohic et al . 2006 ) . the temperatures for the soft thermal component ( kt@xmath7 0.6 - 0.8 kev ) are similar to those in starbursts ( ott et al . 2005 , grimes et al . 2005 ) , and higher than those found for seyfert 1 nuclei ( kt@xmath7 0.25 kev , panessa et al .",
    "the hard power - law slope for liners ( @xmath8=1.8 ) is within the range found for seyferts ( cappi et al .",
    "2006 have found @xmath8=1.56 and 1.61 for sy1 and sy2 , respectively ) .    to gain insight into the emission mechanisms in these objects",
    ", we looked for other evidence of the agn nature at other wavelenghts :    * hst analysis * : all agn candidates show compact hst nuclei ( 28 galaxies ) .",
    "sb candidates ( 15 ) show both dusty ( 8) and compact ( 7 ) hst nuclei . among the seven sb candidates with unresolved optical nuclei ,",
    "4 show other evidences of hosting agn both in optical ( broad or double - peaked h@xmath9 emission line ) and radio ( see below ) .",
    "* radio evidence * : an unresolved nuclear radio core and flat continuum have been suggested as an evidence of agn nature .",
    "most of the liners in our sample classified by filho et al .",
    "( 2000 ) as agns in radio ( 13 objects ) result in agn - like class in x - rays ( 9 ) .",
    "* uv variability * : for the 7 objects in common with the sample of 17 liner galaxies with hst / uv data by maoz et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , five show time variability hinting to their agn nature ; all of them belong to our agn - like class .    * stellar populations * : for the 14 galaxies with data available ( cid - fernandes et al . 2004 )",
    "the contribution of young stars is always less than 3% .",
    "therefore , high mass x - ray binaries are not expected to be an important ingredient for the nuclear x - ray emission .",
    "l@xmath10/l[oiii ] may be used to detect compton - thick sources ( l@xmath10/l[oiii ] @xmath11 1 , maiolino et al .",
    "1998 ) . in fig .",
    "[ thick ] this ratio is shown for the 24 liners in our sample with available [ oiii ] luminosities , separately for agn ( left ) and sb ( right ) candidates .",
    "it can be seen that sb - like nuclei show lower values than agn - like ( mean values 0.96 and 11.0 , respectively ) .",
    "the high percentage of sb - like in the region occupied by compton - thick objects ( 50% ) imply that they may host a strongly obscured agn .",
    "this issue will be further analysed by searching for the presence of fe lines in xmm spectra .",

    "from the study of the nuclear properties of a sample of galaxies with liner nuclei we have obtained that :    * from the x - ray morphology , 60% of the liners are classified as agn - candidates .",
    "* most of the objects need both thermal and non - thermal components for the spectral fitting .",
    "c - c diagrams confirm this result . *",

    "high mass x - ray binaries are not expected to be an important contribution to the x - ray emission .",
    "* a high percentage of the nuclei in our sb - like class may host strongly obscured agns .",
    "although contributions from hmxbs and ulxs can not be ruled out for some galaxies , we concluded in gonzlez - martn et al .",
