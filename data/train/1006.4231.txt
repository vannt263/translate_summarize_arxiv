    "the investigation of the rare weak @xmath0 and @xmath1 meson decays represents a very interesting and important problem .",
    "such decays are governed by the flavour - changing neutral currents , which are forbidden at tree level in the standard model ( sm ) and first appear at one - loop .",
    "therefore , such decays are very sensitive to the contributions of new intermediate particles and interactions , predicted in numerous extensions of the sm ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . notwithstanding the fact that such decays have very small branching ratios , comparison of existing theoretical and experimental results for the rare semileptonic and radiative @xmath8 decays already provides one of the most rigid constraints on different new physics scenarios @xcite .    the theoretical analysis of the rare weak @xmath0 decays is based on the electroweak effective hamiltonian , which is obtained by integrating out the heavy degrees of freedom ( electroweak bosons and top quark ) @xcite .",
    "the qcd corrections to these processes due to hard gluon exchanges turn out to be important and require to resum large logarithms , which is done with the help of renormalization group methods .",
    "the operator product expansion allows to separate the short - distance part in the @xmath0 meson decay amplitudes , which is described by the wilson coefficients and can be calculated perturbatively , from the long - distance part contained in the operator matrix elements between initial and final meson states . for the investigation of the exclusive decay rates one needs to apply nonperturbative methods to calculate these hadronic matrix elements which are usually parametrized in terms of covariant form factors .",
    "clearly , such calculation is model dependent . in order to reduce model dependence , methods , based on the heavy quark and large energy expansions ,",
    "have been developed .",
    "they employ the new symmetries which arise in heavy quark and large energy limits and permit to significantly reduce the number of independent form factors @xcite .",
    "such methods allow a perturbative calculation of qcd corrections to the factorization approximation and thus are now popular in the literature @xcite .",
    "however , the important @xmath9 corrections can not be systematically taken into account in such an approach .",
    "rare @xmath8 transitions are the most studied ones both theoretically and experimentally @xcite .",
    "recently , detailed experimental data on differential branching fractions , angular distributions and asymmetries in the rare @xmath10 decays became available both from @xmath0 factories and tevatron @xcite .",
    "the measured values are at present consistent with the predictions of the sm within experimental and theoretical uncertainties .",
    "significantly better statistics on the rare @xmath0 decays is expected form lhc experiments ( especially from lhcb ) which will allow precision tests of the sm and can probably reveal signals of new physics @xcite .",
    "it is expected that the @xmath1 mesons will be copiously produced at lhc , making possible the experimental study of their weak rare decays .",
    "such decays received significantly less attention in the literature .",
    "the @xmath11 and @xmath12 were previously investigated using the relativistic constituent quark model @xcite , light - front quark model @xcite and three - point qcd sum rules @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the rare weak @xmath0 and @xmath1 decays in the framework of the qcd - motivated relativistic quark model .",
    "our model was previously successfully applied for the investigation of various electroweak properties of heavy and light hadrons .",
    "semileptonic decay rates of the @xmath0 @xcite and @xmath1 @xcite mesons as well as rare radiative decays of the @xmath0 @xcite were calculated in agreement with available experimental data . for this purpose , effective methods of the calculation of electroweak matrix elements between meson states with a consistent account of relativistic effects were developed .",
    "they allow to reliably determine the form factor dependence on the momentum transfer in the whole accessible kinematical range .",
    "the form factors are expressed as overlap integrals of the meson wave functions , which were obtained in the corresponding calculations of the mass spectra @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that we specially checked @xcite the fulfillment of the model - independent symmetry relations among form factors arising in the heavy quark and large energy limits .",
    "here we apply these methods to the calculation of the form factors of the rare @xmath8 and @xmath13 transitions and on this basis determine branching fractions and differential distributions of these decays .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",

    "expressions for the tensor form factors of the rare @xmath0 and @xmath1 meson decays in terms of the overlap integrals of meson wave functions are given in the appendix .",
    "the usual approach to the description of rare @xmath0 decays is based on the low - energy effective hamiltonian , obtained by integrating out the heavy degrees of freedom ( the top quark and @xmath14 bosons ) of the sm .",
    "the operator product expansion separates the short - distance contributions , which are contained in the wilson coefficients and can be calculated perturbatively , from the long - distance contributions contained in the matrix elements of the local operators .",
    "the calculation of such matrix elements requires the application of nonperturbative methods .",

    "the long - distance ( nonperturbative ) effects arise from the @xmath35 resonance contributions from @xmath36 and are usually assumed to have a phenomenological breit - wigner structure .",
