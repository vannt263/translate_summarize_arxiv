    "one of the main goals of the next generation of colliders will be to explore the higgs sector phenomenology .",
    "the simplest candidates for higgs sector physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) are the two higgs doublet models ( 2hdm )  @xcite , and , among these , the leading one is provided by the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )  @xcite .",
    "this requires a higgs sector called of type ii , where one of the higgs doublets couples to the toplike quarks and the other to the bottomlike quarks .",
    "the basic differences between the mssm and a general 2hdm of type ii ( 2hdmii ) depend , first , on the supersymmetric ( susy ) sector , which is obviously absent in the 2hdmii , and , second , on the different values of the higgs boson self - couplings . in the mssm , because of the underlying supersymmetry , these couplings are fixed in terms of the electroweak gauge couplings .    in all these models ,",
    "the physical higgs boson spectrum consists of two neutral cp - even higgs bosons @xmath1 and @xmath2 , one cp - odd higgs boson @xmath3 , and two charged higgs bosons @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "the tree - level parameters are the higgs boson masses @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 , the mixing angle in the cp - even neutral sector , @xmath9 , and the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two higgs doublets , @xmath10 . in the mssm , due to supersymmetry , these can be written in terms of just two free parameters , which are usually chosen as @xmath7 and @xmath11 .",
    "the higgs boson masses are therefore not independent parameters in the mssm , as they are in a general 2hdmii . once the radiative corrections are included these tree - level mass relations are significantly modified , but there still remains a clear pattern for the higgs boson masses in terms of the mssm parameters  @xcite .",
    "hence , if all these masses could be measured with good precision the mass pattern itself would be a first indirect indication of their susy origin .",
    "the most striking prediction of the mssm is that the lightest higgs boson mass lies below 130 - 135 gev , within the reach of present and next generation colliders , the fermilab tevatron  @xcite and the cern large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite .",
    "the properties of this higgs boson @xmath1 , however , are very similar to those of the sm higgs particle in the so - called decoupling regime where @xmath12  @xcite . for the relevant @xmath1 production processes and decay channels at the lhc , this decoupling already occurs , in practice , at @xmath7 values not far from the electroweak scale @xmath13 . for instance , the difference in the width of the main decay @xmath14 , from the sm value is less than @xmath15 for @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "there is just one region , corresponding to low @xmath7 and large @xmath11 values , where the pattern of @xmath1 branching ratios significantly differs from the sm one .",
    "it is because in this region the dominant decays to @xmath18 pairs and to @xmath19 pairs are enhanced and , as a consequence , the subdominant channels are significantly suppressed .",
    "thus , for most of the ( @xmath20 , @xmath11 ) parameter space it seems difficult to disentangle the nonstandard nature of @xmath1 and , in order to decide on its susy origin , one must consider in addition the phenomenology of the other higgs particles ( for a review see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "the relevant question then becomes one of finding susy signals by looking into @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 production and decays at colliders , and of distinguishing these signals from those of a general 2hdmii .",
    "obviously , if the susy particles are within the reach of the lhc and/or the tevatron , the priority is to look for their direct production .",
    "however , it may well happen that these turn out to be too heavy to be produced directly . in that case",
    "one will have to look for indirect susy signals via their contributions as virtual intermediate states in standard processes , in much the same way as was done in the past at the cern @xmath21 collider lep for indirect effects from top and higgs particles in precision observables .",
    "we are particularly interested here in their contributions to the radiative corrections involved in higgs physics .    in this work ,",
    "we consider a scenario where some or all of the higgs particles have been discovered and their masses and branching ratios have been measured , but the susy particles have not shown up yet .",
    "we will study optimal strategies to look for indirect susy signals via their radiative corrections in higgs boson decays  @xcite . since it is known that there are specific decay processes where some susy radiative corrections do not decouple , even in the case of a extremely heavy susy spectrum  @xcite",
    ", we will concentrate on these particular channels .",
    "this nondecoupling behavior is a genuine part of higgs sector physics and has not been found yet in other mssm sectors , such as , for instance , electroweak gauge boson physics  @xcite .",
    "the nondecoupling processes we consider here are the higgs boson decay channels into quark pairs , and more specifically we will concentrate on those that are enhanced at large @xmath11 values : @xmath14 , @xmath22 , @xmath23  @xcite and @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "we will also analyze the top quark decay channel @xmath25  @xcite which is complementary to the @xmath26 decay for low @xmath7 values .",
    "we will focus , in particular , on the susy qcd corrections from third - generation squarks , @xmath27 , and gluinos , @xmath28 , which are the dominant susy radiative corrections for most of the mssm parameter space and are numerically sizable  @xcite .",
    "for instance , in @xmath24 they can be as large as @xmath29 and of either sign for quasidegenerate gluinos and squarks of mass 1 tev and @xmath30 .",
    "these nondecoupling corrections were derived recently in  @xcite for all the higgs boson decay channels into all possible quark pairs , and analyzed in more detail for the @xmath31  @xcite and @xmath24  @xcite channels . for nearly degenerate gluinos and squarks these susy qcd corrections , to one - loop level , can be generically written as @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the corresponding partial decay width without the susy qcd contribution , @xmath34 is the strong coupling constant , @xmath35 is the bilinear higgs boson mssm parameter , @xmath36 is the gluino mass , @xmath37 is a common generic susy mass characterizing the squark masses , and @xmath38 is a function of @xmath39 and @xmath9 that depends on the specific channel  @xcite . the nondecoupling behavior is seen here as a nonvanishing contribution to the partial width of order @xmath40 , which is present even in the limit of a heavy susy spectrum where @xmath41 .",
    "these corrections are known to be particularly relevant for the @xmath42 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 decays , because it is precisely in these channels that the function @xmath38 grows linearly with @xmath11 and can provide sizable contributions for the interesting large @xmath11 region .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the susy electroweak ( susy ew ) corrections may also be relevant in particular regions of the mssm parameter space  @xcite . in the large @xmath11 regime and for quasidegenerate squarks , neutralinos , and charginos , these are known to behave as @xmath43 , where @xmath37 is the common generic mass for squarks , neutralinos , and charginos , @xmath44 is the tree - level top quark yukawa coupling , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 is the top quark trilinear coupling  @xcite . for small or moderate @xmath46 values and a heavy susy spectrum , these susy ew corrections",
    "are considerably smaller than the susy qcd ones and can be ignored , but for very large @xmath46 values , @xmath47 , these susy ew corrections do not decouple either and , depending on their sign , can increase or decrease the nondecoupling effect of the susy qcd corrections .    in order to select optimal observables to look for these indirect susy qcd signals we require of them , first , to be measurable at the tevatron  @xcite , lhc  @xcite , and/or the next generation linear colliders;. second , to be most sensitive to the mentioned susy qcd corrections ; and , third , to have the minimal theoretical and experimental uncertainties .",
    "we propose and analyze here a set of observables that satisfy all these conditions .",
    "these are the ratios of the branching ratios of the higgs boson decays into third - generation quarks to the branching ratios of this same higgs boson into third - generation leptons .",
    "we will show that these ratios can be considered optimal observables because of the following reasons : + @xmath48 the susy qcd nondecoupling corrections contribute just to the numerator , that is , to quark decays and not to lepton decays .",
    "the first will be considered as the search channel , the second as the control channel .",
    "+ @xmath48 these corrections are maximized at large @xmath11 and are sizable enough to be measurable .",
    "+ @xmath48 the production uncertainties are minimized in ratios .",
    "+ @xmath48 they will be experimentally accessible at the lhc or tevatron .",
    "+ @xmath48 they will allow one to distinguish the mssm higgs sector from a general 2hdmii .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 is devoted to an experimental overview of higgs particle searches at the tevatron and lhc .",
    "the relevant regions in the @xmath49 plane are briefly reviewed . in section 3",
    "the set of optimal observables is presented and analyzed in full detail .",
    "the leading contributions from tree - level and standard qcd corrections to these observables are also studied and their theoretical uncertainties estimated . the explicit formulas for nondecoupling susy qcd corrections from heavy squarks and gluinos are presented .",
    "a discussion of the relevance of the susy ew corrections is also contained in section 3 . a comparison between a general 2hdmii and the mssm is also included .",
    "the numerical results for the proposed observables and a discussion as a function of the mssm parameters are presented in section 4 .",
    "finally , the conclusions are summarized in section 5 .",
    "in this section we turn to the perspectives of the experimental measurement itself .",
    "we focus on the next hadron colliders : the tevatron and lhc . from this point of view",
    ", a measurement of the susy radiative corrections in higgs physics is the next step in the problem of discovering a signal of the existence of one or several higgs particles . only after a discovery , but immediately after , will the question of what is the underlying structure of the higgs sector be raised .",
    "as we have said , this is the principal motivation of our study .",
    "the discovery reach problem has been studied carefully and extensively by several working groups , both for the tevatron run 2  @xcite and for the lhc  @xcite . in particular , the searches for sm or mssm higgs bosons were used as benchmark channels during the design of the atlas and cms detectors .    following the results of these studies",
    ", one learns that for values of @xmath50 large enough so that the corrections are sizable , there are three regions in the ( @xmath7 , @xmath50 ) plane of phenomenological interest .",
    "the first is the region of large values of @xmath50 ( say @xmath51 ) , and low @xmath7 ( say @xmath52 gev ) . here",
    "several production processes grow with @xmath53 , and the corresponding cross sections are much larger than the typical sm ones .",
    "one example is the associated production of a cp - odd boson @xmath3 and bottom quarks : @xmath54 . in this region of the mssm , the lighter cp - even boson",
    "@xmath1 has essentially the same couplings and mass ( within 5% ) as the @xmath3 , effectively doubling the production cross section  @xcite .",
    "the heavier cp - even boson @xmath2 has sm bosonlike couplings , and its production rates are considerably smaller . in turn , the charged higgs boson @xmath4 is lighter than the top quark , and @xmath55 happens in a sizable part of the top quark decays .    with such large cross sections and relatively small masses",
    "this has been the main region examined at the tevatron during run 1 .",
    "in fact , the collider detector at fermilab ( cdf ) collaboration has already searched for associated production of @xmath56 , where @xmath57  @xcite , or @xmath58  @xcite , excluding a part of the ( @xmath7 , @xmath11 ) plane . also , the cdf and d0 collaborations have excluded a part of the mssm parameter space corresponding to unobserved decays @xmath55 , with @xmath59  @xcite , more specifically , the region where @xmath60 .",
    "it is clear that the search will continue in run 2 , and a discovery is possible before the start of the lhc  @xcite .",
    "the first analysis takes advantage of both the large cross section ( @xmath61(1 - 100 pb ) ) and large @xmath62 .",
    "the experimental signature is four jets with at least three of them @xmath63 tagged .",
    "this channel has also the advantage that it allows the reconstruction of @xmath7 and , once this mass is known , the production rate gives an idea of the size of @xmath50 . on the other hand , as in any search in a purely hadronic channel , the qcd background has to be properly understood .",
    "systematic errors at the @xmath64 level are not infrequent  @xcite .    in contrast , the channel @xmath65 , has to overcome a relatively smaller branching ratio ( @xmath6610% ) .",
    "however , the electroweak background @xmath67 is considerably less dangerous  @xcite .",
    "if an @xmath3 signal were found in these analyses , the corresponding ratio of @xmath18 to @xmath19 events would be a direct test of the susy qcd corrections .",
    "a possible signal in the charged higgs boson channel could also be useful  @xcite . in this case",
    ", it also happens that the susy qcd corrections do not decouple in the @xmath55 decay but they do decouple in the standard channel , @xmath68  @xcite .",
    "this is the reason why @xmath69 is considered now as the corresponding control width .",
    "the problem in this case is that the tree - level prediction changes rapidly with @xmath70 and @xmath50 . on the other hand , the accuracy in the experimental reconstruction of @xmath70 in the decay",
    "@xmath59 is limited , and this channel by itself does not provide information about @xmath50 . it should be pointed out that the lhc experiments will be able to explore this channel very efficiently .",
    "the second region of interest still has large @xmath50 , but @xmath71 gev @xmath72 gev gev @xmath73 gev are a mixture of the two cases discussed .",
    "a detailed description is complicated and beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "] . with such large masses",
    "this can be considered the genuine search zone of the lhc experiments  @xcite . in this zone , the heavier cp - even boson @xmath2 has similar couplings and mass than the @xmath3 boson , again doubling the cross section of the process @xmath74",
    "( @xmath61(10 - 1000 pb ) ) . now",
    "the light cp - even higgs boson @xmath1 behaves like the one in the sm with @xmath75 gev ( the precise mass value depends on the choice of the mssm parameters ) . in this region ,",
    "the mass of the charged higgs boson is either very close to @xmath76 and @xmath77 is negligible , or @xmath78 and @xmath55 is directly forbidden .",
    "then , the main possibility of producing charged higgs bosons is in the process @xmath79 .",
    "again , this cross section grows approximately ( at large enough @xmath0 ) with @xmath53 .    the main possibility of the tevatron here would be to detect the sm - like boson @xmath80 in the associated production @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "also , the analysis of the ratio @xmath83 can be extended , but only for relatively small values of @xmath7 and very large values of @xmath50  @xcite .    with respect to these last channels at the lhc , the challenge will be to detect the decay @xmath84 in events with four @xmath63 jets .",
    "studies have shown that to control the qcd background will be very difficult .",
    "in contrast , it will be possible to measure the decay @xmath85 and even @xmath86 .",
    "both channels are leptonic , and therefore do not allow an estimation of the susy qcd corrections .",
    "however , they will provide good measurements of @xmath7 and @xmath50 , which can be used in addition to other analyses ( say , @xmath59 ) .",
    "current studies for the lhc  @xcite indicate that values of @xmath87 better than @xmath88 and of @xmath89 better than @xmath90 ( if @xmath91 ) can be reached .    in the case that @xmath92 , the decay channel @xmath93 opens and can be used not only to complement the decay @xmath59 , but also to provide an independent estimation of @xmath7 ( in the frame of the mssm ) and @xmath50 .",
    "finally , we mention the very interesting region with @xmath94 gev and intermediate @xmath95 . at the lhc this zone",
    "is called the `` hole '' because the only higgs particle accessible is the sm - like one . here the main question would be not only to discriminate the mssm from a more general 2hdm sector , but to know if there is something beyond the plain sm .",
    "we will see in the next sections how the susy qcd corrections can be used for that matter .",
    "in this section we present the set of observables that are the most sensitive to the nondecoupling susy qcd corrections .    since we are looking for indirect signals of susy in an experimental scenario described by the discovery of higgs particles , with masses following the mssm pattern , and where the susy particles are too heavy to be produced in colliders , we will search for observables with very specific conditions . from the theoretical point of view",
    "the requirements are the following :    * in order to discriminate between the mssm and a nonsupersymmetric 2hdmii , we need observables with different predictions for these two models .",
    "* these predictions should be distinguishable even in the case of a very heavy susy spectrum . *",
    "the theoretical uncertainties must be minimized .",
    "some specific ratios of branching ratios will cancel these uncertainties either totally or partially .",
    "in particular , we wish the @xmath0 and @xmath9 dependence to appear just in the correction , but not in the lowest order contribution .",
    "on the other hand , the experimental requirements are the following :    * a control channel is needed in order to eliminate systematic errors , so that ratios of event rates are better than event rates themselves . * the corrections to the observables should be sizable in the large @xmath11 regime , since the relevant higgs particle production cross sections grow with this parameter , such that we have better statistics for larger values of @xmath11 .",
    "* there should be good identification of the final state particles . * experimental uncertainties from higgs particle production must be minimized .",
    "these will cancel in some specific ratios of events from higgs particle decays .",
    "* the expected accuracy at the lhc and tevatron for these observables should be good enough that the deviation produced by the corrections becomes apparent .",
    "in particular , the size of the susy qcd corrections must be larger than the expected error bars .",
    "we propose the following set of optimal observables , which satisfy the previous theoretical and experimental requirements :    @xmath96    in addition , we consider the following ratio : @xmath97 which complements the charged higgs boson observable in the low @xmath7 region .",
    "the predictions for these observables at the tree level are the same for any general 2hdmii , and in particular for the mssm .",
    "these are    @xmath98    where @xmath99    as a general remark , the differences in the predictions from the various models for all these observables come in the corrections beyond the tree level and will be discussed in the following subsections . in particular , it is interesting to emphasize that the predictions for the neutral higgs boson observables at the tree level are independent of @xmath0 and @xmath9 .",
    "the charged higgs boson observable depends on @xmath0 , but this dependence is very mild in the large @xmath0 region .",
    "therefore , these observables are especially sensitive to any extra contribution growing with @xmath0 . in the top quark decay observable , however , the tree level prediction goes as @xmath100 , for large @xmath0 , and it will be more difficult to disentangle the mentioned contributions .",
    "other analyses of the observables for the neutral channels in the large @xmath0 limit and in the zero external momentum approximation can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the neutral channel case with higgs boson mass corrections included has been analyzed in  @xcite .",
    "the nondecoupling susy qcd contributions to these observables in the mssm can be easily derived from the results for the effective yukawa interactions of the higgs sector with top and bottom quarks .",
    "these have been recently obtained at one - loop level , for arbitrary @xmath0 , and by a functional integration of bottom and top squarks and gluinos in  @xcite . for",
    "nearly degenerate heavy squarks and gluinos , these corrections can be written as    @xmath101   { \\nonumber}\\\\ o_{h^o } & = o_{h^o}^o & \\left [ 1- \\frac{2\\alpha_s}{3 \\pi } \\frac{m_{\\tilde g } \\mu}{m_{\\rm susy}^2 } ( \\tan \\beta - \\tan \\alpha ) \\right ]   { \\nonumber}\\\\ o_{a^o } & =   o_{a^o}^o & \\left [ 1- \\frac{2\\alpha_s}{3 \\pi } \\frac{m_{\\tilde g } \\mu}{m_{\\rm susy}^2 } ( \\tan \\beta + \\cot \\beta ) \\right ]   { \\nonumber}\\\\ o_{h^+ } & = o_{h^+}^o & \\left [ 1- \\frac{2\\alpha_s}{3 \\pi } \\frac{m_{\\tilde g } \\mu}{m_{\\rm susy}^2 } ( \\tan \\beta + \\cot \\beta ) \\right ]   { \\nonumber}\\\\ o_{t}&= o_{t}^o & \\left [ 1- \\frac{2\\alpha_s}{3 \\pi } \\frac{m_{\\tilde g } \\mu}{m_{\\rm susy}^2 } ( \\tan \\beta + \\cot \\beta ) \\right ] .",

    "@xmath37 is the common susy mass for squarks and gluinos ( @xmath102 ) and @xmath103 is the strong coupling constant evaluated at the corresponding decaying particle mass .",
    "the leading terms @xmath104 refer to the value of the observables without the susy particle contributions and will be discussed in subsection  3.3 .",
    "these formulas are for heavy squarks and gluinos , that is , for large @xmath37 , and are valid for all @xmath11 and @xmath7 values .",
    "corrections to the previous formulas are either of higher order in @xmath34 or suppressed by higher inverse powers of the heavy susy masses @xmath37 and , for the present analysis , can be safely ignored .    from a first look at eq.([eq.exprobs ] ) one sees clearly that the observables have different predictions within the mssm and in a general 2hdmii , since the former includes the susy qcd corrections , which do not exist in the latter .",
    "this main difference comes from the nondecoupling behavior of the susy qcd corrections in the higgs boson decays into quarks ( and in the top quark decay into charged higgs bosons ) , which is relevant even for a very heavy susy spectrum , such that @xmath105 .",
    "notice also that , as mentioned before , these susy qcd contributions grow linearly with @xmath11 so we expect sizable corrections for large @xmath11 .",
    "there are two limiting situations that are worth mentioning : the large @xmath7 limit @xmath12 , and the large @xmath0 limit @xmath106 . in the former limit",
    ", @xmath107 approaches @xmath108 ( correspondingly , @xmath109 ) and , as can be seen in eq.([eq.exprobs ] ) , the susy qcd correction decouples in @xmath110 .",
    "the other observables get exactly the same nondecoupling correction , proportional to @xmath111 .",
    "in addition , in this limit , the @xmath2 and @xmath112 masses approach the large @xmath3 mass .",
    "the leading contribution @xmath113 approaches the sm prediction and , therefore , as noted before , the situation can not be distinguished from the sm case . in the large @xmath11 limit",
    ", the corrections do not decouple in any channel , they are all proportional to @xmath0 and all have the same sign .",
    "the universal character of the corrections will be very useful in a global analysis , because it will yield strongly correlated signals in all the channels .",
    "it is well known that , in particular regions of the mssm parameter space the radiative corrections from the susy ew sector can also be relevant in the decays of the higgs bosons and top quark that we are considering here  @xcite .",
    "these susy ew corrections are largely dominated by the contributions with charginos or neutralinos and third - generation sfermions in the loops ; the contributions from the higgs sector being negligible .",
    "for instance , in the @xmath114 case with @xmath115 gev and for light top and bottom squarks and light charginos and neutralinos , @xmath116 gev , they contribute as much as @xmath117 with respect to the tree level width , whereas the susy qcd loops induced by squarks and gluinos are by far the leading susy effects and give a contribution larger than @xmath118  @xcite .",
    "these susy ew corrections can only be competitive with the susy qcd ones in the particular region of the susy parameter space where @xmath0 is very large ( @xmath119 ) , the bottom squarks are very heavy ( @xmath120 gev ) , and the top squarks and charginos are relatively light ( @xmath121 gev ) .",
    "for this particular choice , the total susy correction remains around ( 30 - 50)@xmath122 of the tree level width , with at most half of it of susy ew origin  @xcite .    for our present assumption of a very heavy susy spectrum with nearly degenerate susy particle masses ( @xmath123 )",
    "the susy qcd corrections provide by far the dominant contribution to the one - loop mssm correction . however , it is worth analyzing in more detail the susy ew corrections , which are known to provide extra non - decoupling contributions .",
    "these nondecoupling susy ew effects have been estimated in the literature just in the large @xmath124 regime and by means of an effective lagrangian formalism , which works in the zero external momentum approximation  @xcite . in this approach , the potentially large @xmath0 enhanced susy corrections to the higgs boson - quark - quark yukawa couplings",
    "are induced via the quark mass corrections . in particular , the expression for the bottom quark yukawa coupling , at the one - loop level and in the large @xmath0 limit , is  @xcite @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the on - shell pole bottom quark mass , @xmath127 gev , and the @xmath0 enhanced radiative corrections are encoded in @xmath128 where @xmath129 and @xmath130 refer to the bottom quark mass corrections from the susy qcd and susy ew sectors , respectively .",
    "@xmath131 is dominated by the bottom squark - gluino loops , and to leading order in the strong coupling is  @xcite : @xmath132 for sizable values of the soft trilinear coupling @xmath46 , @xmath130 is dominated by the top squark - chargino loops and more precisely by the top squark - charged higgsino contribution . by neglecting the bino effects , which have been found to be numerically insignificant , the susy ew mass correction to leading order in the top quark yukawa coupling and the electroweak gauge coupling is  @xcite ,    @xmath133 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath134 is the susy soft breaking chargino mass parameter and @xmath135 , @xmath136 , with @xmath137 the @xmath27 mixing angle .",
    "the one - loop integrals in @xmath129 and @xmath130 are defined by ,    @xmath138    for the simplest assumption that is considered in this work of all susy soft breaking parameters and the @xmath35 parameter being of comparable size , @xmath139 and consequently the mass corrections behave as , @xmath140 first , we see here that the nondecoupling effects induced from the previous expression for @xmath129 on the bottom quark yukawa coupling through eq.([eq : yuk ] ) are exactly the same as the ones extracted from the observables @xmath141 in eq.([eq.exprobs ] ) in the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "therefore both approaches coincide in this limit , but just eq.([eq.exprobs ] ) gives the correct behavior for moderate and low @xmath0 .",
    "second , we see that , even in the case of very large @xmath0 values and large @xmath35 , @xmath46 and @xmath134 , the size of the susy ew corrections remains always well below the susy qcd corrections .",
    "the relative signs of these contributions depend on our choice of the relative signs of @xmath36 , @xmath35 , @xmath46 , and @xmath134 . by choosing a combination of signs that maximizes the size of @xmath130 and for equally large susy parameters we find that @xmath142 is less than @xmath143 of @xmath144 .",
    "therefore , for this assumption on the size and signs of the susy parameters , we can conclude conservatively that the effect on the observables of eq.([eq.exprobs ] ) would be reduced by at most @xmath145 .",
    "since we are studying here the sensitivity of the observables in eq.([eq.exprobs ] ) involving higgs bosons and top quark decays to the susy qcd nondecoupling corrections for all @xmath0 values , a more precise analysis of these susy ew nondecoupling effects would require the use of compact formulas valid for all @xmath0 values , which are not available so far in the literature , and it is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "we will , however , take them into account conservatively in the final numerical analysis and conclusion by considering this somewhat pessimistic case in which they conspire for a @xmath145 reduction of the susy qcd signal .      here",

    "they are evaluated numerically with the fortran program hdecay  @xcite , using the renormalization group approach of  @xcite to obtain the mssm higgs boson masses .",
    "these standard qcd corrections contribute obviously just to the decays into quarks and are known to be as large as @xmath145 ( for a review , see  @xcite ) . in order to take into account large contributions from higher orders , we have used the running instead of the pole bottom quark mass .",
    "this resums the leading logarithms and improves the convergence of the series . to illustrate this , we show here the case of @xmath146 .",
    "we compare , in table 1 , the results of @xmath147 for @xmath148 gev ( normalized to the tree level width ) , computed at tree level , and at orders @xmath149 and @xmath150 in perturbation theory , using both the pole and running masses .",
    "0.4 cm    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in summary , the mssm predictions for the previous higgs boson observables are known up to an uncertainty of the order of 13% .",
    "any extra correction must be larger than that to be visible .",
    "here we investigate the similarities and differences of the set of observables defined in section 3.1 , in a general 2hdmii as compared to the mssm . for",
    "a given higgs sector mass pattern that is compatible with the mssm , the values of the observables at the tree level , and after including the standard qcd corrections , coincide with the corresponding ones in the mssm .",
    "note that the mixing angle in the neutral sector , @xmath9 , is a derived quantity in the mssm , whereas in the 2hdmii it is an independent parameter ( in principle @xmath151 , but actually the range in @xmath9 is further restricted if the higgs potential is required to be bounded from below ) and , hence , its value can be different in the two models .",
    "however , since the branching ratios in the numerator and denominator of our observables @xmath152 have the same dependence on @xmath9 , at the tree level the @xmath153 themselves are @xmath9 independent ( see eq.([eq.treeobserv ] ) ) .",
    "when the standard qcd corrections are included , this @xmath9 independence is still maintained . on the other hand , the standard electroweak corrections from @xmath154 , @xmath155 , @xmath156 are also similar in both models and , as already said , they have been estimated to be below @xmath157 and can be ignored here .",
    "therefore , the only differences , apart from the susy corrections , could come from the higgs sector radiative corrections .",
    "as mentioned before , these are negligible in the mssm but , in principle , could be larger in the 2hdmii .",
    "the reason is that these corrections involve the higgs boson self - couplings which in the 2hdmii are not restricted by susy and , in principle , can be large .",
    "we have estimated these potentially different contributions from the higgs sector to the one - loop level and for a higgs boson mass pattern compatible with the mssm , and they turn out to be very small , certainly well below the common ones discussed in the previous section .    in order to illustrate this we discuss the case of @xmath3 .",
    "we show in fig.[fig.diff ] the maximum absolute value of the difference between the mssm and 2hdmii higgs sector corrections for @xmath158 ( after scanning the allowed range in @xmath9 ) , relative to the tree - level prediction @xmath159 .",
    "more specifically , these differences come exclusively from the @xmath9-dependent one - loop diagrams , and from the triangular one - loop diagrams involving the higgs boson self - couplings .",
    "the contour lines separate the regions in the ( @xmath160 ) plane where the maximum difference between the mssm and 2hdmii is larger than 0.1% , between 0.05% and 0.1% , between 0.01% and 0.05% , and below 0.01% . in the region of interest ,",
    "@xmath161 gev  @xcite , this difference is always less than 0.1% .    in summary , as announced , the basic difference between the mssm and a general 2hdmii model , with respect to our observables , is that the large susy particle loop corrections do not exist in the second case . in the next section",
    "we discuss these contributions .",

    "even the perfect experiment with infinite statistics and perfect resolution can not make conclusions about the size of the corrections .",

    "3.2 , for very large @xmath46 values , the susy ew corrections do not decouple and this could increase or decrease the nondecoupling effect of the susy qcd corrections . for the present assumption of equally large susy parameters and by choosing a particular combination of signs that maximizes the size of @xmath193 , we find that this contribution always remains below @xmath194 of the @xmath195 one . in order to be conservative ,",
    "we have performed the exercise of considering this pessimistic case where the susy ew corrections reduce the susy qcd signal by @xmath196 ( see figs .  [ fig.concorrnegew ] and  [ fig.concorrew ] ) . as in figs .",

    "in this paper we have looked for indirect signals of a heavy supersymmetric spectrum via its contributions to the radiative corrections to higgs boson decays . for that purpose",
    "we have analyzed the dominant susy qcd corrections , coming from heavy squarks and gluinos , to the higgs boson decays into quarks .",
    "we have studied in detail the nondecoupling contributions , especially in the large @xmath0 region where their size is large . in order to search for these susy signals",
    ", we have proposed a set of observables consisting of ratios of higgs branching ratios into third - generation quarks ( @xmath201 and @xmath202 ) divided by the corresponding ones into third - generation leptons ( @xmath203 and @xmath204 ) .",
    "in addition , the observable for top quark decays given by the ratio of @xmath205 divided by @xmath206 , complementary to the previous charged higgs boson observable in the low @xmath7 region , has been analyzed .",
    "these observables are optimal for this purpose since the susy qcd corrections appear just in the decays to quarks and , therefore , the decays into leptons can be used as control channels .",
    "we have carefully studied any sources of uncertainty that would modify the prediction of the observables , previous to the susy qcd corrections . in particular , the theoretical uncertainties coming from the qcd corrections , and from the errors in the values of the sm parameters involved in the determination of these observables , have been evaluated .",
    "in addition , it has been found that the susy qcd corrections will allow one to discriminate between the mssm and a nonsupersymmetric 2hdmii , even in the case of a similar higgs sector mass pattern .",
    "our detailed study of this set of observables has revealed their high sensitivity to the susy qcd contributions and shown that they are sizable in most of the ( @xmath160 ) plane .",
    "the corrections to the different observables are strongly correlated .",
    "a global analysis of all of them , together with the experimental determination of @xmath7 and @xmath0 , will be part of the search for supersymmetric signals at future colliders , especially if the susy spectrum turns out to be very heavy .",
    "the measurement of these observables should be the next step after a higgs boson discovery at the lhc or the tevatron .",
    "we have seen that , with a modest experimental resolution of 50% , the observables would show evidence of the susy qcd corrections to the @xmath3 , @xmath2 , and @xmath112 decay widths , if @xmath190 .",
    "a better resolution of @xmath192 would show the corrections down to @xmath207 .",
    "our study of the susy ew effects shows that , even in the pessimistic case where the susy qcd corrections get reduced by @xmath196 , an experimental resolution of @xmath197 would expose the susy corrections down to @xmath190 .",
    "observation of the corrections in the @xmath1 case would require , in general , quite large values of @xmath0 .",
