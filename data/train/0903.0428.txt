    "more precisely , @xmath64 corresponds to the nonlinear semigroup defined by ( [ eq1 ] ) . as in the linear case , we have the following relation between @xmath60 and the process @xmath64 : @xmath71 one of the important questions in the study of parabolic linear and nonlinear equations is the one concerning the behavior of solutions ( or , in probabilistic terms , behavior of the corresponding diffusion process ) as @xmath72 . in our case , when the small parameter @xmath73 is present in front of the second order term , the limit of @xmath74 as @xmath75 , @xmath72 , depends on the manner in which @xmath76 approaches @xmath77 . in the linear case",
    "this problem has been studied in @xcite ( see also @xcite , @xcite ) .    in section  [ asc ]",

    "we study the exit problem for the process @xmath64 .",
    "we shall see that new effects appear when nonlinear stochastic perturbations are considered . in particular , even in the generic case , the distribution of the exit location @xmath84 need not be concentrated in one point .",
    "some related problems concern the notion of metastability for nonlinear perturbations of dynamical systems with several equilibrium points .",
    "let us consider the dynamical system ( [ dsyst ] ) in @xmath4 and its perturbations ( [ perturb ] ) .",
    "as before , @xmath5 and  @xmath6 are assumed to be lipschitz continuous .",
    "now we shall assume that the system has a finite number of asymptotically stable equilibrium points @xmath85 such that for almost every @xmath86 , with respect to the lebesgue measure , the trajectory of ( [ dsyst ] ) starting at @xmath8 is attracted to one of the points @xmath87 .",
    "we shall also assume that the vector field @xmath6 satisfies @xmath88 for some positive constants @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the case of more general asymptotically stable attractors ( for instance , limit cycles ) can be considered similarly , however for the sake of brevity we restrict ourselves to the case of equilibriums .",
    "the general theory of metastability was developed in @xcite in the framework of large deviations ( see also @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "it was shown , in particular , that for a generic vector field @xmath6 satisfying the assumptions above , for almost every @xmath86 and @xmath46 , with probability which tends to one when @xmath31 , the trajectory @xmath20 of ( [ perturb ] ) spends most of the time in the time interval @xmath91 $ ] near a point @xmath92 .",
    "this point is called the metastable state for the trajectory starting at  @xmath8 in the time scale @xmath93 .",
    "the metastable state can be determined by examining the values of the quasi - potential .",
    "namely , let @xmath94 , \\mathbb{r}^d ) , \\varphi(0 ) = x_i , \\varphi(t ) = x_j \\},~~1 \\leq i , j \\leq m.\\ ] ] these numbers determine a hierarchy of cycles along which the system switches from one metastable state to another with the growth of @xmath95 ( @xcite )",
    ".    we can also study metastability for nonlinear perturbations of dynamical systems .",
    "it turns out that now the transition between the equilibrium points does not occur `` immediately in the exponential time scale '' .",
    "this implies that now metastable states should be replaced by metastable distributions between the equilibriums .",
    "the description of metastable distributions is based on the study of the asymptotic behavior of solutions to ( [ eq1])-([bc ] ) when @xmath31 and @xmath78 .",
    "note that metastable distributions also arise in @xcite , @xcite , but for reasons which are different from what is discussed in this paper .",
    "such a modification to the notion of metastability leads to a modified notion of stochastic resonance .",
    "we briefly address the problems of metastability in section  [ genex ] , where we also consider other generalizations and some examples .",
    "the issue of metastability in the case of an arbitrary number of equilibrium points and cycles will be addressed in a forthcoming paper .    in this paper we considered nonlinear perturbations of a system with an asymptotically stable equilibrium . in this case",
    ", the exit from a domain containing this equilibrium occurs due to large deviations , and the exit time and exit distribution essentially depend on the perturbation .",
    "a related singular perturbation problem arises in the case when the equilbrium is stable but not asymptotically stable : for instance when the unperturbed system is hamiltonian .",
    "nonlinear stochastic perturbations in this case lead to a nonlinear version of the averaging principle .",
    "say , in the case of one degree of freedom , the limiting slow motion is a diffusion process corresponding to a nonlinear operator on the graph ( compare with @xcite , chapter 8) related to the hamiltonian .",
    "we will consider these problems in one of the forthcoming papers .",
