    "in a recent work we introduced the time - dependent multi - determinant approach ( ref.[1 ] ) ( tdmd ) , whereby the nuclear wave function is described as a linear combination of several slater determinants . the dirac variational principle has been used to obtain the equations of motion describing the time evolution of the nuclear wave function from an initial state .",
    "the method has been applied to the description of monopole resonances in a light nucleus .",
    "the tdmd has been shown to be a good dynamical approach in the sense that the initial energy and norm of the wave function are preserved by the equations of motion . in ref . [ 1 ] this has been shown without explicit reference to projectors to good quantum numbers ( i.e. angular momentum and parity ) .",
    "the proof of norm and energy conservation can be carried out also using projectors to good quantum numbers with only minor additional algebra on the assumption that the hamiltonian is rotational and parity invariant . the formalism of ref .",
    "[ 1 ] also has been used for imaginary time propagation which can be used to refine the ground state from an initial wave function .",
    "the purpose of this work is to extend the formalism introduced in ref .",
    "[ 1 ] to the description of quantum mechanical propagators .",
    "the key ideas are the following . in ref .",
    "[ 1 ] the nuclear wave function is described as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a slater determinant labeled by the index @xmath3 and each slater determinant was written as @xmath4 @xmath5 being the number of particles , @xmath3 labels the slater determinant and @xmath6 are generalized creation operators written as a linear combination of the standard creation operators @xmath7 in the single - particle state @xmath8 ( for example harmonic oscillator single - particle states ) .",
    "we can conveniently recast each slater determinant as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is an operator of the type @xmath11 \\eqno(5)\\ ] ] we use here a matrix notation , that is @xmath12 , where the sum runs over the single - particle states in the basis .",
    "we call the propagators of eq.(5 ) elementary propagators ( ep ) . the relation between the single - particle wave functions @xmath13 and the matrix @xmath14",
    "is given by @xmath15 note that the matrix @xmath16 uniquely specifies the single - particle wave functions @xmath17 , but the inverse statement is not true .",
    "in fact , in order to construct @xmath17 we need all matrix elements of the matrix @xmath16 , but only the matrix elements @xmath18 for @xmath19 and @xmath20 are used in eq.(3 ) .",
    "that is , only part of the information contained in @xmath16 is used in the tdmd approach .",
    "we can state that @xmath21 \\ad_1\\ad_2 .. \\ad_a |0 > \\eqno(7)\\ ] ] the sum in the square brackets is a propagator and the wave function is obtained by projecting this propagator onto a reference state .",
    "most of the information contained in the propagator is not used in the tdmd approach .",
    "it is natural to ask what is the equation of motion for this propagator and what kind of information can be extracted from it .",
    "we consider the following variational principles . if @xmath22 a propagator for a hamiltonian @xmath23 , the propagator satisfies the following variational principles for real time , @xmath24= tr [ \\delta\\rho^{\\dagger } h \\rho ] \\eqno(8a)\\ ]",
    "] @xmath25= tr [ \\rho^{\\dagger } h \\delta\\rho ] \\eqno(8b)\\ ] ] and for imaginary time @xmath26= -tr [ \\delta\\rho^{\\dagger } h \\rho ] \\eqno(9a)\\ ] ] @xmath27= -tr [ \\rho^{\\dagger } h \\delta\\rho ] \\eqno(9b)\\ ] ] eqs .",
    "( 8a ) and ( 9a ) are called eom1 , and eqs .",
    "( 8b ) and ( 9b ) are called eom2 .",
    "it is trivial to show that these variational principles lead to the exact real time propagator and imaginary time propagator if we use the full hilbert space .",
    "once we solve the variational equations we can evaluate @xmath28 and perform a fourier analysis in the case of real time to obtain the micro - canonical level density , or extract the free - energy in the case of imaginary time .",
    "these are the basic ideas of the extension of the tdmd method to propagators .",
    "that is , we use variational principles for the propagators under the assumption that they are written as a sum of time dependent elementary propagators of the type @xmath29 .",
    "we note that our method is very different from functional integrals based on the hubbard - stratonovich transformation ( ref.[2 ] ) . with functional integrals",
    "we end up with multidimensional integrals of propagators , and they are hardly computable with monte carlo methods .",
    "the same can be said for imaginary time functional integrals , although in some cases the partition function is amenable to monte carlo evaluation .",
    "moreover , in the case of the partition function our method is very different from the minimization of the free energy functional ( see for example ref .",
    "[ 3 ] ) . in this latter method",
    "the free energy is a functional of a density operator ( in some sense the propagator we have just described ) which must be minimized to obtain the actual propagator .",
    "the major stumbling block of this method is that we do not know how to compute the entropy in presence of a projector to good quantum numbers or if the density operator is a sum of elementary propagators .",
    "this difficulty has been the major hurdle in using the temperature dependent hartree - fock , or hartree - fock - bogoliubov methods in presence of exact projectors to good quantum numbers .",
    "this work deals mostly with formalism and only a few numerical examples .",
    "the outline of this work is the following . in section 2",
    "we derive in detail the equations of motion . in section 3",
    "we discuss a few properties in the imaginary time case . in section 4",
    "we discuss the equations of motion for the real time propagation , conservation laws , and how one can extract the micro - canonical level density from the fourier transform of real time propagators . in section 5",
    "we discuss a few numerical examples in a simplified hilbert space .",
    "as a notation , we use a caret to denote second quantized operators and we denote elementary propagators ( ep ) as @xmath30 \\eqno(10)\\ ] ] where the sum runs over the single - particle space @xmath19 .",
    "the matrix @xmath16 is time dependent .",
    "as well known , ep s form a group ( ref.[4 ] ) , and the product of two ep s is an ep .",
    "also , to any ep we can associate the matrix ( which we denote without the caret ) @xmath31 throughout this work , small letters will denote the logarithm of matrices as in eq.(11 ) which are denoted with capital letters . in this work",
    "we do not consider the most general ep , where we allow for particle number violation as done in the hartree - fock - bogoliubov formalism .",
    "the group property is still valid in such a case and it is the cornerstone of the method . given two ep s such as @xmath32 and @xmath33 represented by @xmath3 and @xmath34 respectively , the product @xmath35 is represented by @xmath36 .",
    "moreover , traces taken in the full hilbert space will be denoted as @xmath37 and traces taken in the single - particle space as @xmath38 . since we shall consider traces in the hilbert space , we start with grand - canonical traces , and we consider since the beginning , projectors to good quantum numbers , which we write schematically as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a rotation operator ( which is an ep ) dependent on the three euler angles , in the case of the angular momentum projector , or is the operator @xmath41 , @xmath42 being the particle number operator , in the case of particle number projector . in this latter case",
    "@xmath43 is a purely imaginary phase @xmath44 with @xmath45 .",
    "similarly we can recast the parity projector as in eq.(12 ) .",
    "the detailed form of @xmath46 can be found in many textbooks ( see for instance ref.[5 ] ) .",
    "the ansatz for the propagator is @xmath47 and @xmath48 we use this notation since often we omit the labels @xmath49 and @xmath50 , in order to shorten the equations , with the understanding that @xmath51 .",
    "consider the following traces @xmath52 = \\sum_{d'd } \\sum_e d^{\\star}(e ) \\tr [ \\hs \\ht \\hr ]   \\eqno(14)\\ ] ] where , again , @xmath33 is labeled by @xmath50 and @xmath32 by @xmath49 .",
    "note that we have used the cyclic property of the trace . using the aforementioned group property and the identity @xmath53 valid for any ep , we have @xmath54 = \\sum_{d'd } \\sum_e d^{\\star}(e)det [ 1 + str ] \\eqno(16)\\ ] ] to obtain the time derivative of @xmath55 .",
    "let us vary eq.(16 ) with respect to all @xmath3 s . using the identity , valid for any matrix @xmath56 , @xmath57 we obtain @xmath58 = \\sum_{d'd } \\sum_e d^{\\star}(e)\\det [ 1 + str ] \\tr(f \\dot s tr ) \\eqno(18)\\ ] ] where @xmath59 next , we evaluate the variation of eq.(18 ) with respect to a specific @xmath60 where @xmath61 are single - particle indices . again using the identity of eq.(17 ) we obtain @xmath62= \\sum_d \\sum_e d^{\\star}(e ) \\det [ 1 + str]\\times\\ ] ] @xmath63 \\eqno(20)\\ ] ] hence @xmath64}= \\sum_d",
    "\\sum_e d^{\\star}(e ) \\det [ 1 + str]\\times\\ ] ] @xmath65 we now have to evaluate the right hand side of the variational equations .",
    "let us assume that we have lumped together the kinetic energy and the two - body potential , as normally done in the shell model , and that @xmath66 where @xmath23 is already antisymmetrized ( i.e. @xmath67 ) .",
    "we have @xmath68 [ \\tr \\gamma \\cn ) ] \\eqno(23)\\ ] ] where @xmath69 and ( the sum over repeated indices is assumed ) @xmath70 we have then @xmath71\\times\\ ] ] @xmath72 \\eqno(26)\\ ] ] hence for a specified @xmath73 we have for the right hand side , which we call @xmath74 , @xmath75 [ \\tr(\\gamma \\cn ) ( rfs)+2(rf\\gamma fs)]_{a'a } \\eqno(27)\\ ] ] we are now in a condition to write down explicitly the equations of motion .",
    "let us consider first the imaginary time case .",
    "we have for @xmath76 ( the superscript refers to eom1 ) , @xmath77 the matrix @xmath78 can be read off from eq .",
    "( 21 ) and is given by the following expression @xmath79\\times\\ ] ] @xmath80 \\eqno(29)\\ ] ] in the case of real time propagation the equation of motion eom1 is @xmath81 the equations of motion eom2 can be obtained in a similar way .",
    "we first evaluate @xmath82 $ ] and then we vary the result with respect to @xmath83 .",
    "we simply write the result as @xmath84 for real time propagation and @xmath85 in the case of imaginary time .",
    "the matrices in eqs .",
    "( 31 ) and ( 32 ) have the following expressions @xmath86\\times\\ ] ] @xmath87 \\eqno(33)\\ ] ] and @xmath88 [ \\tr(\\gamma \\cn ) ( trf)+2(trf\\gamma f)]_{a'a } \\eqno(34)\\ ] ] in the case of real time eom1 and eom2 are the complex conjugate of each other .    if we consider neutrons and protons separately we simply have to add the extra isospin index to the single - particle indices .",
    "in such a case it is convenient to choose the matrices @xmath3 as block diagonal , i.e. the matrix @xmath3 does not couple neutrons and protons .",
    "this choice make the projection to the proper number of neutrons and protons easier .",
    "let us consider the imaginary time equations of motion .",
    "let us assume that at some initial time @xmath89 the propagator is a sum of hermitian ep s and a sum of non - hermitian ep s plus their hermitian conjugates .",
    "we then can say that for each @xmath90 there is a @xmath91 ( which can be @xmath49 itself ) such that @xmath92 , or @xmath93 .",
    "let us prove that the time evolution preserves the hermitian structure of @xmath55 and that eom2 is equivalent to eom1 .",
    "these two properties are essential from a physical point of view . in order to do so ,",
    "let us set @xmath94 since the projector satisfies the relations @xmath95 and @xmath96 the above functional are real .",
    "moreover we can rewrite eom1 schematically as ( using the sum convention ) @xmath97 which can be rewritten as @xmath98 taking the complex conjugate of eq .",
    "( 37 ) we have @xmath99 hence , comparing eqs .",
    "( 37 ) and ( 38 ) we have @xmath100 that is @xmath101 .",
    "this implies that @xmath102 strictly this is true if the solution of the system of eq.(37 ) is unique . if we have multipole solutions we can always force eq.(38 ) and still satisfy eq.(37 ) .",
    "this property guarantees that the spectrum of @xmath55 is real .",
    "next , eom2 can be rewritten as @xmath103 which can be recast as @xmath104 which implies that @xmath105 .",
    "therefore eom2 gives the same solution as eom1 .",
    "_ 3a . micro - canonical level density and constants of motion .",
    "_    the equations discussed in the previous section are not easy to solve .",
    "in fact , we expect that the numerical solution will show an exponential behavior as a function of the imaginary time and therefore some kind of numerical stabilization might be necessary especially for large values of imaginary time . in this section",
    "we discuss the real time propagation and a motivation on physical grounds .",
    "let us assume that we have solved eom1 ( or eom2 ) as a function of the time and let us evaluate @xmath106 consider the following fourier transform @xmath107 in the limit of @xmath108 .",
    "the function @xmath109 approaches the level density if we have evaluated @xmath110 with sufficient accuracy for the hamiltonian @xmath111 .",
    "there are a number of points to be discussed .",
    "consider first some conservation laws which must be satisfied if we have solved the equations of motion accurately .",
    "we shall prove that the quantities defined in eq.(35 ) are constants in time .",
    "let us rewrite eom1 and eom2 in the following form @xmath112 and @xmath113 multiplying eq.(45 ) by @xmath114 and summing over the indices , multiplying eq.(46 ) by @xmath115 and summing over the indices , and subtracting the two results one has @xmath116 the above is the time derivative of @xmath117 .",
    "the conservation of @xmath118 is slightly more involved to prove .",
    "consider eom1 as given by eq.(30 ) and eom2 given by eq.(31 ) .",
    "let us multiply eom1 by @xmath73 and sum over the indices , and eom2 by @xmath119 and sum over the indices and add the two results .",
    "we obtain , using the cyclic property of the trace and the definitions of @xmath120 and @xmath121 @xmath122 = 0 \\eqno(48)\\ ] ] let us now consider separately the particle number projection from the rest of the projectors to good quantum numbers , in the following way .",
    "let us define the complex fugacity @xmath123 and isolate it from the rest of the rotation operator . then @xmath124 = 0 \\eqno(49)\\ ] ] and @xmath125 the exact projection to the proper number of particles @xmath5 can be done by isolating the coefficient of @xmath126 in @xmath127 .",
    "let us consider the diagonal representation of the matrix @xmath128 and let us call @xmath129 its eigenvalues .",
    "recall ( although we work in real time ) that @xmath130 is a grand - canonical partition function and that the canonical partition function for @xmath5 particles is given by @xmath131 this is a homogeneous polynomial of power @xmath5 in the @xmath132 s for which the euler s theorem holds .",
    "let us call @xmath133 the canonical partition function for @xmath134 particles with the level @xmath129 removed .",
    "then eq . ( 49 ) can be rewritten as @xmath135 since @xmath136 the euler s theorem gives @xmath137 , and therefore @xmath138 hence the particle - number projected overlap is a constant of motion .",
    "these two conservation laws are a valuable test in order to control the accuracy of the time evolution .",
    "there are a few remaining points which will discussed in the next subsection .    _",
    "3b . the choice of the intial conditions .",
    "_    we have described in detail the form of the equations of motion but so far we have not specified the initial condition at @xmath139 .",
    "ideally we would set @xmath140 .",
    "this choice is necessary if we wish to evaluate the micro - canonical level density using eq.(44 ) .",
    "note however that we are solving an initial value problem and in principle we can take any initial @xmath141 . if we consider @xmath142 , we can only consider one single ep .",
    "there is simply no way to have @xmath142 with several independent ep s . in the case of several ep s",
    "we have several choices .",
    "consider for a moment the decomposition of the hamiltonian @xmath111 into a sum of quadratic operators of the type @xmath143 much is the same way it is done as a preliminary step to express the propagator with functional integrals . in eq.(54 )",
    "@xmath144 and @xmath145 are one body operators .",
    "the propagator after a small time interval @xmath146 , up to @xmath147 terms , can be be written as @xmath148 \\eqno(55)\\ ] ] as an initial start we can consider few terms of this type . in practice we do the following instead . consider simply a sum of the type @xmath149 where @xmath150 are one body operators , unspecified for the moment .",
    "for sufficiently small @xmath146 , only their sum contributes to the propagator , that is , the ansatz of eq.(56 ) is equivalent to the choice of just one ep .",
    "hence we first start from @xmath142 , using only one ep .",
    "we solve up to @xmath146 the equations of motion and we decompose @xmath151 into a sum of different ep s .",
    "such a sum of independent @xmath152 is our choice for the initial start .",
    "the set of @xmath152 is then evolved up to finite times . since the decomposition of the initial @xmath3 ( for @xmath153 ) into several @xmath3 s is arbitrary ,",
    "we expect the the solution of the equations of motion is not unique .",
    "that is the matrix @xmath154 can have @xmath155 eigenvalues .",
    "we test the eigenvalues of @xmath78 and we solve the linear system of equation ( 45 ) in the unknowns @xmath156 in the basis that diagonalizes @xmath78 . in doing so , we discard all @xmath155 eigenvalues and reconstruct @xmath156 in the original basis .",
    "that is we use the generalized inverse of @xmath78 . as a consistency test",
    "we verify that the @xmath156 obtained in this way satisfy the original system of eq.(45 ) .",
    "an additional choice is to write @xmath141 as a sum of ep s such that for small @xmath146 @xmath141 is proportional to @xmath157 up to @xmath147 terms .",
    "note that in general especially for large single - particle spaces , the sizes of the linear system to be solved for @xmath156 can be very large and mathematical libraries such as scalapack ( ref.[6 ] ) that can distribute large matrices into several processors are necessary .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath22 is obtained using runge - kutta methods of high accuracy .",
    "we give a few examples of the numerical solution of the equations of motion in the next section . as a final remark",
    ", we found that even if our initial start for @xmath22 is unitary , unitarity is broken as we evolve at finite times .",
    "this raises the question whether the number of levels obtained from eq.(44 ) is the correct one .",
    "we do not have in a strong argument regarding this point .",
    "however we can state that the integral over the energy of the micro - canonical level density has the correct value .",
    "the argument is the following .",
    "consider first the case of one ep .",
    "the projected overlap at @xmath139 is simply the projected trace of the unity operator .",
    "hence it is simply the total number of levels .",
    "such an overlap is a constant of motion , even if unitarity is broken at finite times . in the case of several ep s ,",
    "since at the initial time we decompose the propagator obtained after a small time interval @xmath146 into several ep s , the energy integrated micro - canonical level density is the same ( up to @xmath147 terms ) and , again , after we solve the equations of motion at finite time , we obtain approximately the correct value .",
    "let us consider a system of 6 neutrons in the 1s1p harmonic oscillator shells .",
    "we choose the harmonic oscillator frequency @xmath158 . for the interaction",
    "we take the neutron - neutron part of the n3lo interaction ( ref.[7 ] ) renormalized to the above single - particle space .",
    "this model is highly schematic and it serves solely to the purpose of testing the numerical method and the concepts of the previous sections . since we solve the equations of motion in real time we must ensure to have the proper number of particles .",
    "we can not use chemical potentials as usually done in the case of the imaginary time propagation .",
    "we also implement an angular momentum projector to @xmath159 . in one case",
    "we use the full angular momentum projector to @xmath160 .",
    "this model has only @xmath161 states with @xmath159 and @xmath162 states with @xmath160 .",
    "the full space contains @xmath163 states . in all calculations",
    "we take @xmath146 in the range of @xmath164 .",
    "let us consider first one elementary propagator , that is @xmath153 .",
    "we start from @xmath142 .      in fig.1",
    "we show the error in the conservation of the energy - like quantity @xmath165 defined in eq.(35 ) . throughout this work we use @xmath166 , that is ,",
    "we measure the time in units of @xmath167 . in fig.2",
    "we show the deviation from unitarity . as it can be seen ,",
    "although the propagator is not unitary , @xmath168 is constant for very long times . in fig .",
    "3 we show the micro - canonical level density given by eq . (",
    "44 ) as a function of the energy , together with the number function @xmath169      the number function counts the levels from @xmath170 up to a given energy @xmath171 .",
    "we took in eq.(44 ) @xmath172 . in the limit @xmath173",
    ", @xmath174 is a sum of dirac - delta functions and the number function increases by one unit anytime we cross a level .",
    "as it can be seen from fig.3 , in some cases @xmath175 increases by two units , which points out to a degeneracy ( or near degeneracy ) of two levels , not separated by @xmath172 . as a check ,",
    "note that the total number of levels is the correct one .",
    "in fig.4 we show the level density and the number function for @xmath153 using the full projector to @xmath160 .",
    "note that the projector gives a different approximation to the full propagator compared to the @xmath159 case .        in conclusion",
    ", we have generalized the time dependent multi - determinant approach to propagators using variational principles of dirac - type .",
    "we described in detail the equations of motion and showed that there are constants of motion not related to the unitarity of the propagator .",
    "such constants of motion are very useful to test the correctness and accuracy of the numerical methods . in the future we plan to extend these numerical techniques to the neutron - proton case for reasonably large shell model spaces .",
