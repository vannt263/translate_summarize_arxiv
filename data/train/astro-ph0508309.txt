    "among the known supernova remnants ( snrs ) , a handful contain fast - moving debris with optical spectra dominated by lines of oxygen and its associated burning products . in these metal - rich remnants ,",
    "the emission is produced by excitation of dense material from deep within the massive progenitor star ( @xmath410 m@xmath9 ) , laid bare by the supernova explosion .",
    "dense clumps of ejecta coast along mostly intact and undecelerated until they penetrate the hot , overpressured gas of the reverse shock . as shocks are driven into the fragments they are torn apart into clumps of varying size and density .",
    "the densest material ( @xmath1010 @xmath11 , @xmath12100 ) produces optical / uv spectra dominated by very strong oxygen line emission , with little or no emission from lines of h , he and n commonly seen in shocked interstellar material .",
    "the spectroscopic study of ejecta material in oxygen - rich supernova remnants ( osnrs ) provides us with a rare opportunity to study both the kinematics of the supernova ejecta and the products of both hydrostatic and explosive nucleosynthesis in massive stars .    to date",
    "there have been six osnrs identified : cassiopeia a ( minkowski 1957 , chevalier & kirshner 1978 , 1979 , reed 1995 , fesen 2001 ) , puppis a ( winkler & kirshner 1985 ) and 292 ( goss 1979 , murdin & clark 1979 , van den bergh 1979 , braun 1983 , dopita & sutherland 1995 ) in the galaxy , 0540@xmath769.3 ( kirshner 1989 ) and n132d ( lasker 1978 , 1980 ; morse , winkler & kirshner 1995 ; morse 1996 ; blair 2000 ) in the lmc , e0102@xmath772.2 in the smc ( dopita , tuohy & mathewson 1981 , tuohy & dopita 1983 , blair 2000 ) and a spatially unresolved remnant in ngc 4449 ( kirshner & blair 1980 , blair kirshner & winkler 1983 ) .",
    "although the core - collapse supernovae which produced these osnrs should have all left behind rotating neutron stars ( pulsars ) , 292 is the only galactic remnant from this class found to harbor both an active pulsar ( camilo 2002 , hughes 2003 ) and associated pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) ( hughes 2001 ) .",
    "earlier hri observations indicated that a central bar of enhanced x - ray emission was present in 292 , superimposed on an ellipsoidal disk of emission ( tuohy , clark & burton 1982 ) .",
    "recent imagery of 292 ( park 2002 , 2004 ; gonzalez & safi - harb 2003 ) have revealed that the x - ray bar is of normal composition , suggesting that 292 is interacting with circumstellar wind material . on the basis of the rich variety of physical processes present in 292 ( o - rich optical and x - ray emission , active pulsar / pwn and apparent circumstellar interaction ) one may argue that 292 is the best snr for a simultaneous study of all aspects of core collapse supernova explosions .    as with many supernova remnants known today , 292 was first discovered in a radio survey ( mills , slee & hill 1961 ) .",
    "the first followup radio observations ( lockhart 1977 ) showed a center - filled ( plerionic ) morphology , leading some to conclude that the remnant was `` crab - like '' , i.e. , that synchrotron radiation from a pwn dominated the radio appearance of the snr .",
    "however , further radio observations by braun ( 1986 ) demonstrated that there are two components to the radio morphology of 292 : a bright circular region near the center approximately 4 across embedded in a surrounding fainter plateau of emission approximately 8 across . in a more recent observation of 292 , hughes ( 2001 ) discovered a point source of hard x - ray emission near the geometric center surrounded by a nonthermal halo 1@xmath72 across .",
    "they argued that the source was a pulsar and pwn , a conclusion which was confirmed by discovery of 135 ms radio pulsations from the point source , now designated psr j1124@xmath75916 ( camilo 2002 ; hughes 2003 ) .",
    "subsequently gaensler & wallace ( 2003 ; hereafter gw03 ) showed that the spectral index of the bright radio core is consistent with synchrotron radiation from a pwn ( @xmath1=@xmath70.05 ) , while the index of the plateau is steep ( @xmath1=@xmath70.5 ) , consistent with particle acceleration in shocks .",
    "x - ray emission from the metal - rich ejecta in 292 was first detected in data ( clark , tuohy , & becker 1980 ) .",
    "detailed x - ray spectroscopy was performed by hughes & singh ( 1994 ) , who showed that the global x - ray spectrum of 292 was dominated by k - shell line emission from metal - rich ejecta . based on abundances derived from their global spectral models ,",
    "hughes & singh ( 1994 ) argued that the ejecta composition of 292 matched the yields of 20 m@xmath13 nucleosynthesis models best .",
    "however , in a recent analysis of spectra of 292  park ( 2004 ) , noting that only the x - ray lines of o , ne , mg and si were detected , suggested that the reverse shock has not yet penetrated beyond the layers of hydrostatically burned material . since knowledge of the relative abundances of both hydrostatic and explosive burning products",
    "are required for an accurate estimate of the progenitor mass from the supernova nucleosynthesis models , park ( 2004 ) concluded that the progenitor mass estimate by hughes & singh ( 1994 ) was no longer reliable .",
    "thus the mass of the progenitor star of 292 remains uncertain .",
    "the first optical imagery of 292 was performed by goss ( 1979 ) , who discovered a bright , crescent - shaped spur of nebulosity coincident with the extended radio source position .",
    "their spectra showed emission lines of oxygen and neon , but little or no line emission from hydrogen , helium or nitrogen .",
    "followup spectra of the spur acquired by murdin & clark ( 1979 ) , van den bergh ( 1979 ) , braun ( 1983 ) and sutherland & dopita ( 1995 ) showed broad [ o  iii ] lines extending over a velocity range @xmath142000 .",
    "narrowband optical ccd images of 292 have recently been acquired by winkler & long ( 2005 ; hereafter wl05 ) .",
    "according to all these studies , the optical appearance of 292 is dominated by radiative shocks in dense supernova ejecta which have undergone negligible mixing with the ism .    in this paper ,",
    "we report results of rutgers fabry - perot ( rfp ) imaging spectroscopy of 292 in emission lines of [ o  iii ] , h@xmath1 , and [ n  ii ] .",
    "both the narrowband [ o iii ] imagery of wl05 and our rfp scans have revealed extensive oxygen - rich material undetected in the earlier photographs , including previously undetected knots of o - rich ejecta similar to those seen in cas a and an equatorial belt of shocked material . as we will show , the compact knots of o - rich ejecta exhibit large radial velocities ( @xmath31500 ) , showing that these features are fast - moving knots ( fmks ) .",
    "in addition , we will show that the zero velocity [ o iii ] and h@xmath1 emission from the equatorial belt trace a bar - like structure matching a similar feature in the x - ray band .",
    "this confirms the assertions of park ( 2002 , 2004 ) and gonzalez & safi - harb ( 2003 ) that this feature is comprised of circumstellar material .",
    "the velocity range of both the fmks and the bright o - rich spur extends over a 50% broader range in velocities than previously determined for 292 ( murdin & clark 1979 , van den bergh 1979 ) , extending to @xmath33000 . throughout this paper",
    "we assume a distance of 6 kpc to 292  ( gw03 ) and quote distance - dependent quantities in units of 6 kpc .",
    "our observations of 292 were performed with the rfp spectrometer at the 1.5 m telescope of cerro tololo inter - american observatory .",
    "the h@xmath1 data were acquired on the night of 1998 february 17 ( ut ) , while the [ o  iii ] data were acquired on the nights of 1998 february 20 and 21 ( ut ) .",
    "the tek1024 ccd and 200 mm camera lens were used with the f/7.5 secondary focus , giving an image scale of 065 pixel@xmath15 for all the observations .",
    "the field of view was a circle 78 in diameter , centered on coordinates 11@xmath1624@xmath17305 , @xmath759@xmath1816013 ( 2000 ) for the h@xmath1 scans and 11@xmath1624@xmath17242 , @xmath759@xmath1816088 ( 2000 ) for the [ o  iii ] scans . in figure [ g292_oiii+allaps ] the rfp field of view is marked on the continuum - subtracted narrowband [ o iii ] image of wl05 .",
    "the broad etalon was used during all rfp observations .",
    "the h@xmath1 scans sampled the emission at 19 velocities from @xmath7800 to + 570 , at intervals of 70 per sample .",
    "the [ o  iii ] scans were centered on 5007  and ranged from @xmath71435 to + 1675 , sampling the emission from 292 in 29 samples over 100 intervals . during our observations",
    "we isolated emission from a single spectral order using ctio [ o  iii ] filter 4993/44 ( @xmath19=44  ) for scans centered in the range 4983 @xmath205001  , filter 5007/44 for scans in the range 5003 @xmath205019  and 5037/44 for scans in the range 5021 @xmath205035  . on the first night of the [ o  iii ]",
    "observations the median seeing was 19 , during which we acquired the scans between @xmath7250 and + 710 .",
    "the remaining fp scans were obtained during the second night of [ o  iii ] observations , when the seeing had worsened to 26 .",
    "two 500 s frames were acquired at each rfp etalon setting in both [ o  iii ] and h@xmath1/[n  ii ] .",
    "we reduced the fabry - perot images using iraf and our own custom software .",
    "each pair of fp scans was combined in iraf using the crreject option to remove cosmic rays and create images with an effective exposure time of 1000 s. we applied overscan and bias subtraction to all images in the standard way .",
    "separate flat field images of the telescope dome white spot were obtained at each observed wavelength , and were used to correct the detector pixel - to - pixel response variations and to remove the filter transmission function .",
    "the wavelength scale was calibrated using a series of comparison lamp exposures of nearby h@xmath1 and neon emission lines .",
    "the zero - point drift of the wavelength solution was determined from h@xmath1 and neon calibration exposures interspersed with the object frames during the observations .",
    "we estimate that the resulting wavelength calibration is accurate to better than 0.1  .",
    "the rfp instrumental spectral profile measured from the calibration exposures is well fit by a voigt function with a gaussian width of 44 and lorentzian width of 52 .",
    "the resulting instrumental fwhm is 117 .",
    "we scaled the transmission of the rfp scans to a common airmass using the ctio mean extinction tables . the variations in transparency between frames was tracked via photometry of unsaturated stars in the field . from the photometry we calculated the multiplicative constants required to bring the fluxes from all frames to a common level .",
    "next , we applied a gaussian smoothing kernel to each combined scan to produce a common effective seeing of 30 fwhm .",
    "finally we computed a coordinate solution ( accurate to within 02 ) for each image using seven usno@xmath7a2.0 catalogue stars distributed over the field of view .",
    "several factors complicate the identification of [ o  iii ] emission features in our rfp scans .",
    "292 lies in a rich stellar field and the sizes of many emission knots are comparable to the seeing fwhm , so there is a significant danger of mistaking stars for emission knots ( and vice versa ) .",
    "in addition , internal reflections within the etalon cause ghosts ( mirror images ) of the brightest stars to be projected across the optical axis in each frame , further complicating the identification of [ o  iii ] knots . to minimize these problems , we first subtracted the stars from each [ o  iii ] rfp scan using a background image created by median combining three fp scans devoid of any obvious line emission from the snr and the night sky . scaling the background image by a multiplicative constant and subtracting it from each of the 28 [ o  iii ] rfp scans",
    ", we generated a set of continuum - subtracted images .",
    "this process removes approximately 90% of the stars from each frame , leaving only residuals from the brightest stars and their ghosts .",
    "the ghosts were identified by tracing the reflection of each bright star across the fp axis , then removed by interpolating the surrounding sky emission over the ghost feature .",
    "we were able to check the completeness of our ghost removal by registering and comparing our individual fp scans with blue dss images .",
    "much of the ejecta material in 292 exhibits a morphology that varies strongly with velocity and position . to map this distribution we found it useful to extract snapshots of the entire remnant at a selected range of velocities .",
    "the wavelength of the fp transmission profile is not constant over the field but shortens quadratically from the optical axis to the edge of each frame , amounting to a 200 blueshift in our [ o  iii ] observations .",
    "thus , to create the single velocity images we interpolated the flux at each point in the field using rfp scans bracketing the desired velocity . to minimize source confusion we used the continuum - subtracted rfp scans to generate the constant velocity [ o  iii ] images .",
    "due to variations in sky emission between adjacent scans , the interpolation introduces a slight ringing effect into some constant velocity images , i.e. , some images show annular strips where the average pixel value differs from the value in the adjacent region .",
    "we applied a first order correction to the background by adding a constant pixel value to the mismatched annular regions .",
    "this brought the background pixel values in all the interpolated strips to within roughly 20% of one another .",
    "although this procedure did not correct for interpolation errors in the object emission and left some residual structure in the background , it was sufficient to allow easy identification of supernova remnant emission at each velocity interval .",
    "we were able to verify that for a given constant velocity image the brightest emission knots do correctly appear at the velocity centroids measured from line profile fits to the knots ( described in section  5 ) . to remove any further stellar residuals which may be mistaken for fmks , we interpolated the background over the positions of the brightest subtracted stars in the rfp field of view .",
    "we examined the remaining knots visible in the image sequence of figure [ g292redblue ] and verified that the flux from each knot followed the sequential rise and fall expected of real emission lines in the rfp frames .",
    "to illustrate the dependence of the global ejecta distribution on radial velocity , we present a sequence of constant velocity [ o  iii ] images in figure [ g292redblue ] .",
    "the sequence is arranged in order of heliocentric radial velocity , from blue to red , in increments of 120 ( roughly the instrumental profile fwhm ) .",
    "the sequence extends to @xmath211440 , although there is a highly blueshifted knot near the center of 292 still visible blueward of @xmath71440 and a similar , but much fainter knot , detected at + 1700 ( marked k1 and k2 , respectively , in figure [ g292_oiii+allaps ] ) .",
    "the faint , diffuse [ o  iii ] emission first detected by murdin & clark ( 1979 ) is clearly visible in the image at zero radial velocity ( corresponding to zero heliocentric velocity , or v@xmath22=4.5 ) .",
    "the diffuse [ o  iii ] does not appear at other velocities and extends beyond the edge of the snr shell defined by the x - ray and radio observations .",
    "this suggests that the diffuse emission is produced by photoionized interstellar gas , in agreement with the conclusion of murdin & clark ( 1979 ) .",
    "based on the single velocity images in figure  [ g292redblue ] , the shocked [ o  iii ] emission in 292 can be broadly placed into three categories :    \\(1 ) a bright , curved structure located on the eastern edge of 292 and exhibiting a broad velocity dispersion ( @xmath23 2000 ; murdin & clark 1979 ) .",
    "spectroscopic observations of this spur showed only emission lines of o and ne ( murdin & clark 1979 , van den bergh 1979 , braun 1983 , sutherland & dopita 1995 ) , indicating that the material was stellar ejecta uncontaminated by interstellar material .",
    "the earliest published spectra showed that the spur consists of predominantly redshifted material .",
    "the rfp scans presented in this paper confirm this result and show that the spur traces a semi - coherent structure at redshifted velocities , moving progressively inward ( toward the center of 292 ) with increasing radial velocity .",
    "this trend is consistent with the geometric projection expected from an expanding shell . a new feature , unseen in the earlier photographic images of 292 ( goss 1979 ; tuohy , clark & burton 1982 ) but clearly detected both in the [ o  iii ] image ( figure  [ g292_oiii+allaps ] ) and our rfp scans ( figure  [ g292redblue ] ) , is the collection of ` streamers ' seen radiating southward from the innermost edge of the spur .",
    "the streamer emission also moves inward with progressingly larger redshift , suggesting that these features trace a partially complete shell similar to the spur .",
    "\\(2 ) an equatorial belt running e - w along the projected center of the x - ray remnant .",
    "the optical belt appears as a clumpy line of broken filaments in figure  1 .",
    "it is kinematically resolved into multiple components by our rfp observations in figure  2 : a bar - shaped structure of material at zero radial velocity , projected onto a high velocity component of clumpy material . due to its intrinsic faintness ,",
    "the belt emission escaped detection in the earlier photographic plate images of 292 ( goss & shaver 1979 ; tuohy , clark & burton 1982 ) .",
    "as we will show , the bar seen in our rfp scans appears to be the optical counterpart to the bar seen in the images by park ( 2002 , 2004 ) and gonzalez and safi - harb ( 2003 ) .",
    "the appearance of both the bar and the diffuse emission over most of the field at zero radial velocity suggests that the bar also lies in the 292 rest frame .",
    "this is consistent with a slow wind ( v@xmath2410 ) origin for the bar .",
    "\\(3 ) fast - moving knots ( fmks , in analogy to similar features in cas a ; chevalier & kirshner 1978 ) seen in [ o  iii ] ( but not h@xmath1 ) out to radial velocities @xmath251500 .",
    "these conspicuous features are clearly seen in the narrowband [ o  iii ] image ( figure  [ g292_oiii+allaps ] ) , above and below the equatorial belt . in the rfp data the fmks range in size from around 5 down to the seeing limit of 3 .",
    "a clear trend in the fmk velocity distribution of figure  [ g292redblue ] is that nearly all of the northern fmks are either seen at zero velocity or are blueshifted , while most ( but not all ) of the southern fmks are either seen at zero velocity or are redshifted . unlike what is observed in cas a ( reed 1995 ; lawrence 1995 ; fesen 2001 ) , the fmks in 292 are more isolated and sparsely distributed across the remnant . aside from the spur ,",
    "there are no networks of curved ejecta filaments associated with the fmks as seen in cas a ( fesen 2001 ) .",
    "although the velocity image sequence is a useful tool for exploring the ejecta emission on a global scale , exploring the kinematics of individual knots and the dynamical processes affecting them ( e.g. , shear , dynamical instabilities , etc . ) is easiest when a sequence of ejecta knot images are arranged side by side in velocity as 2-dimensional spectra .",
    "we used the continuum - subtracted rfp scans to construct an image sequence of selected features including fmks , sections of the spur and portions of the equatorial belt . in figure",
    "[ g292.2dknots ] we present a set of ten spectra consisting of images 11@xmath2611 in size .",
    "the sequence includes the most blueshifted and redshifted knots detected in the rfp images ( k1 and k2 , corresponding to spectra 1 and 10 , respectively ) .",
    "there is clear evidence of velocity shear seen in spectrum 6 from the spur : emission extending redward from @xmath7100 to + 600 . in the remaining spectra",
    "the faint , photoionized gas surrounding 292 is clearly visible near zero radial velocity ( particularly in spectra 1 and 9 ) . in spectrum 3",
    "a pattern can be seen in the fmk emission where the top of the clump first appears at around @xmath71200 , then the lower portions progressively appear at increasingly redshifted velocities .",
    "spectrum 10 illustrates the spatial superposition between the zero velocity bar emission and the high velocity ejecta ( knot k1 ) present in the equatorial belt .",
    "to perform a detailed kinematic analysis of 292 we extracted spectra from both the spur and the individual fmks and fit the [ o  iii ] line profiles .",
    "although the star subtraction process used to create the single velocity images in figure [ g292redblue ] was adequate for the task of revealing the ejecta distribution , we utilized the unsubtracted frames for the spectral extraction to better calculate the local background around each emission knot .",
    "we selected fmks for spectral extraction by eye , taking care to avoid stellar contamination by checking that knots in the rfp scans did not appear as stars in the dss blue image of the 292 field .",
    "the apertures used for the spectral extractions were 32@xmath2632 squares , roughly equal to the seeing fwhm of the smoothed data .",
    "the extraction apertures for the bright southeastern spur were of the same size , laid out on a grid covering the entire structure .",
    "the extraction apertures also covered the brightest knots of streamer material seen just south of the spur in figure  [ g292_oiii+allaps ] .",
    "the spectral extraction consisted of first summing the emission within each defined extraction aperture , for each frame of the datacube . to subtract the sky emission",
    ", we selected a ring of pixels in each frame , centered on the optical axis and passing through the middle of each extraction aperture .",
    "this ensured that the sky fluxes were extracted at the same wavelength as the emission within each aperture .",
    "the ring consisted of all the sky lying off the supernova remnant which included the widespread diffuse emission but excluded stars or other detectable discrete sources .",
    "we summed the sky emission along the ring , rejecting pixels deviating more than 4@xmath27 from the mean value .",
    "we then multiplied the resulting sky spectrum by @xmath28 to obtain a scaled sky spectrum for each of the apertures . subtracting",
    "this spectrum from that of each emission knot yielded the final spectrum for each aperture .",
    "the sky subtraction removes large scale sources of background emission in the rfp data bandpass , namely galactic [ o  iii ] and diffuse [ o  iii ] surrounding 292 .",
    "routines were written to extract the [ o  iii ] profiles and subtract background emission from all the spectra . compared to typical long - slit spectral observations ( e.g. , the cas a study by reed 1995 ) ,",
    "the spectral range of our data is much shorter , covering only @xmath1452 at [ oiii ] and @xmath1430 at h@xmath1 .",
    "in addition , our spectra are typically less than critically sampled .",
    "we fit our data with a spectral profile that included both the instrumental and expected intrinsic source profile shapes , as described below . due to the large number of spectra obtained from both the fmks and the spur region , it was necessary to automate the line identification and fitting process .",
    "most of the fmk spectra exhibited solitary [ o  iii ] emission components .",
    "however , due to the combined factors of geometrical projection and the possible action of dynamical processes within the shocked ejecta of the spur ( instabilities , shear motions , etc . ) , the rfp spectra of the spur often exhibited [ o  iii ] emission from multiple velocity components .",
    "we did not know _ a priori _ the number of [ o  iii ] lines to expect in any single rfp spectrum , and therefore needed a method of determining the number of distinct significant emission lines in each spectrum .",
    "initial trial and error showed that maxima less than 4@xmath27 above the background failed to yield stable line profile fits , so only features with higher s / n were counted as separate components .",
    "although this eliminates the possibility of measuring radial velocities for some of the fainter emission , we were more concerned here with making reliable line identifications and measuring accurate radial velocities for well - defined features . after rejecting spectra of some of the fainter features in the rfp data ,",
    "our final sample consisted of 62 fmk and 462 spur / streamer spectra .",
    "we assumed the [ o  iii ] profiles to be intrinsically gaussian in shape ; convolved with the instrumental response of the rfp the resulting profile is a voigt function .",
    "therefore , we fit emission lines with voigt functions of fixed lorentzian width ( the instrumental value , 52 ) and left the line flux , gaussian width , line centroid and background level as free parameters . during each profile fit",
    "we initially set the width of the gaussian component equal to the instrumental value and the line centroid equal to the velocity of the local flux peak .",
    "the gaussian widths yielded by our fits to all the [ o  iii ] profiles ranged from close to the instrumental gaussian width ( 44 ) to values around 100 , with a few profiles exhibiting widths as large as 350 .",
    "overall , the line widths are consistent with [ o  iii ] emission from radiative shocks with @xmath350@xmath7200 , although the large widths of some of the emission lines may be produced by blending of narrower features . in figures [ g292knotspec ] and [ g292spurspec ] we present examples of spectra from nine fmks and sixteen locations in the spur , along with the line profile fits obtained using the method described above .",
    "although the main goal of the rfp observations was to map the [ o  iii ] @xmath05007 emission in 292 , it is not known whether other emission lines could have been shifted into the bandpass of our spectra .",
    "optical studies of other osnrs such as cas a ( reed 1995 ) have shown that the emission lines from some ejecta knots may be doppler shifted enough to cause ambiguity in distinguishing lines of one atomic species from those of another .",
    "obviously this is also a potential concern for 292 , where some features in our rfp spectra may be classified as either highly blueshifted [ o  iii ] @xmath05007 emission or highly redshifted [ o  iii ] @xmath04959 emission . in this study",
    "we assume that all the bright spectral lines we have fitted are due to the [ o iii ] @xmath05007 transition .",
    "it is possible that this has produced an error in the computed radial velocity ( by @xmath292900 km s@xmath15 if we have misidentified as @xmath05007 what is actually a @xmath04959 transition ) .",
    "resolving this potential ambiguity would require additional spectroscopy over a wider spectral band .",
    "for the ensemble of knots , however , we believe that this is unlikely to be an important or widespread effect . as we show in the next section ,",
    "the identification of the fmk spectral features as @xmath05007 lines leads to a simple kinematic picture of the fmks , and yields an age for 292 consistent with the age predicted by recent global models of the supernova remnant / pwn energetics ( chevalier 2005 ) .",
    "using the [ o  iii ] line profile fits , we calculated the radial velocities of the 62 selected fmks and plotted the velocities as a function of the knots radial distance from the geometric center ( @xmath1,@xmath30 ) = 11@xmath1624@xmath173468 , @xmath759@xmath1815@xmath3129@xmath32 ( 2000 ) for 292 as determined from the radio observations of gw03 .",
    "we present a position - velocity diagram of the fmks in figure [ g292knotvelcircle ] .",
    "the correlation observed between fmk velocities and their distances from the geometric center in figure [ g292redblue ] can be clearly seen in figure [ g292knotvelcircle ] .",
    "the velocities of the northern fmks increase with radial distance , ranging from around 0  at a 1  radius to around 1500  at the outer edge ( 35 ) of the sampled fmk distribution .",
    "the northern fmks appear to trace a portion of an ellipse in the position - velocity plane , consistent with the kinematic signature of an expanding shell .",
    "another identifiable property of the velocity distribution is that nearly all of the northern fmks exhibit blueshifted emission , while , by contrast , the southern fmks exhibit a more even mixture of blueshifted and redshifted emission .",
    "it is also clear from figure [ g292knotvelcircle ] that there is a significant spread in fmk radial velocities ( @xmath3500 ) at a given radius .",
    "this dispersion is much larger than the random statistical error in velocity ( @xmath350 ) .",
    "the fmks may then not strictly lie on a geometrically thin shell , making the definition of a shell expansion radius less well defined .",
    "however , we can at least fit a velocity ellipsoid to the outermost fmks in the position - velocity diagram in order to obtain a rough expansion age for 292 .",
    "we fit the position - velocity distribution in figure  [ g292knotvelcircle ] with a velocity ellipsoid , leaving the radius @xmath33 , expansion velocity @xmath34 and systemic velocity @xmath35 as free parameters .",
    "the expansion center coordinates were fixed to those of the geometric radio center of gw03 . excluding the southernmost fmks , we fit a curve to match the outermost points of the radial velocity distribution as closely as possible , paying particular attention to matching the most well - defined pattern , that of the blueshifted northern fmks .",
    "our best estimate is marked by the solid curve in figure [ g292knotvelcircle ] .",
    "the fitted radius of the fmk position - velocity distribution is 34 ( 5.9@xmath36 pc ) .",
    "this defines a circle with northern edge lying just interior to the northernmost fmks seen in figure [ g292_oiii+allaps ] .",
    "we find an fmk shell velocity v@xmath371700 , with a velocity centroid @xmath38 + 100 , although the latter is not very tightly constrained since it is comparable to the random statistical error in fmk radial velocities ( @xmath2150 ) and is smaller than the fmk velocity dispersion .",
    "our derived systemic shift is substantially smaller than the shifts seen in the other known osnrs : cas a ( + 900 ; reed 1995 ) , n132d ( @xmath7500 ; morse 1995 ) , e0102@xmath772.3 ( @xmath7500 ; tuohy & dopita 1983 ) , 0540@xmath769.3 ( + 370 ; kirshner 1989 ) and the remnant in ngc 4449 ( + 500 ; balick & heckman 1978 ) . assuming free expansion of the shell , the age @xmath39 ( @xmath40r@xmath41/v@xmath41 ) is @xmath42 years .    as a separate exercise",
    ", we also computed @xmath39 for two separate cases : ( 1 ) assuming the fmks formed with a range of initial velocities but experienced negligible deceleration over the lifetime of the snr , and ( 2 ) assuming the fmks formed with identical velocities but with different knots experiencing differing degrees of deceleration over the lifetime of the snr . in case 1",
    "we fit the position - velocity distribution of all the fmks , including the knots left out of the previous fit . in that case",
    ", we found a radius of 275 ( @xmath43 pc ) , a shell velocity of 1500 and @xmath38 + 85 ( this fit is marked by the dashed ellipse in figure [ g292knotvelcircle ] ) .",
    "these numbers give @xmath44 years . in case 2",
    "we did not know the degree of deceleration of each individual knot , so we took the 500 spread in the fmk velocity distribution as an approximation of the maximum deceleration experienced by the outermost knots . in that case , the original speed of the outermost knots was @xmath45=@xmath46= 1700 + 500 = 2200 , and the expression for the age is now @xmath47r@xmath41/(v@xmath48v ) .",
    "taking @xmath33=34 ( 5.9@xmath36 pc ) , the resulting age is @xmath49 years .",
    "thus , the range in ages derived from our analysis is ( 3000 - 3400)@xmath36 years .",
    "the kinematic age derived from our analysis is nearly twice the value inferred by murdin & clark ( 1979 ) from spectroscopy of the spur .",
    "the disparity between our age and that of murdin & clark ( 1979 ) occurs because the expansion radius of the fmks ( 34 ) is nearly 70% larger than that of the spur ( @xmath32 ) , while the expansion velocities of the two distributions are nearly the same ( @xmath501700 ) .",
    "as we illustrate in the next section , the position - velocity diagram of the eastern spur is highly complex and structured .",
    "it is unclear whether a simple geometric expansion model can be applied to the spur ; therefore , we believe that modeling the fmk kinematics provides cleaner , better estimates of both the expansion velocity and age of 292 .",
    "recently chevalier ( 2005 ) has applied self - similar models to constrain the supernova explosion types of a number of known core collapse snrs , including 292 .",
    "the models use observationally determined parameters such as the pulsar period and spindown rate , pwn luminosity and blast wave radius to classify the natal explosion type of each snr . in the case of 292  assuming a distance of 6 kpc , chevalier ( 2005 ) found that an age of 27003700 years was required for consistency with his models .",
    "another estimate of the remnant s age , 2900 yrs , comes from the spindown age of the pulsar , psr  j1124@xmath75916 , associated with 292  ( camilo  2002 ) .",
    "these values are in good agreement with the age of ( 30003400)@xmath8 years from our fit to the fmk radial velocities in 292 .",
    "this consistency in age estimates supports our assumption that the outermost knots in the position - velocity distribution have not been strongly decelerated .",
    "the position - velocity diagram of the spur ( figure  [ g292spurvelcircle ] ) presents a far more complex kinematic picture than that of the fmks ( figure  [ g292knotvelcircle ] ) .",
    "although the spur does exhibit some of the overall properties expected from an expanding shell ( e.g. , the inward progression of the [ o  iii ] emission with increasing radial velocity seen in figure [ g292redblue ] ) , one is hard pressed to identify the kinematic signature of such a shell in figure [ g292spurvelcircle ] .",
    "one place where such a kinematic signature possibly appears is in the redshifted ejecta north of the expansion center .",
    "between radii of 1 and 2 , the velocity of this material monotonically decreases from + 1000 to 0 .",
    "a more prominent feature is the tendency for many of the points in the position - velocity diagram to aggregate into radially extended clusters at nearly constant velocity . in particular , as demonstrated in figure [ g292spurvelcircle ] , there are two clusters of points ( mostly toward the south ) located at roughly 0 and + 950 ( both noted by braun ( 1983 ) ) , with a similar but less distinct clustering possibly at @xmath7300 .",
    "braun ( 1983 ) interpreted these features as breakouts of o - rich clumps superimposed on a more uniform , expanding shell of ejecta .",
    "the rfp data appear to be consistent with this interpretation . despite the rather confused radial velocity picture of the spur , both this feature and the fmk distribution described earlier",
    "extend over a total velocity range of approximately 3000 .",
    "psr j1124@xmath75916 in 292  is intriguingly close to the inner edge of the o - rich spur ( marked in figure [ g292_oiii+allaps ] ) .",
    "it is offset @xmath345 eastward from the geometric center of the snr , implying a substantial velocity component ( v@xmath51 450 for @xmath523400 years ) in the direction of the spur .",
    "this feature , combined with the known presence of a luminous pwn around psr j1124@xmath75916 raises an interesting question about the origin of the spur emission : could the spur be a shell of dense ejecta swept up from the inside by the motion of psr j1124@xmath75916 ?",
    "there have been no unambiguous kinematic signatures predicted for the interaction between a pwn and sn ejecta .",
    "however , vital clues may be found in existing optical spectra of this osnr : we would expect that as psr j1124@xmath75916 moved through the interior of 292 the innermost ejecta ( mostly ar - fe produced in explosive nucleosynthesis ) would be the first material to be shocked by the pwn .",
    "the lack of line emission from elements heavier than s in the global optical spectra of 292 ( murdin & clark 1979 ; sutherland & dopita 1995 ; wl05 ) strongly indicates that the optical emission from the spur does not arise in a pwn / o - rich ejecta interaction . as mentioned earlier , x - ray emission from these heavier species",
    "is also absent in the spectra of the 292 ejecta ( park 2004 ) , suggesting that in general there has been little or no interaction between the pwn and sn ejecta .",
    "a strong contrast may be drawn between here and the case of the osnr 0540@xmath769.3 in the lmc , where the pwn observed in the x - rays is completely enclosed by a ring of [ o  iii]-emitting ejecta ( reynolds 1985 ) .",
    "there , optical emission from s , ar , fe and ni are observed in addition to the usual o and ne lines ( kirshner 1989 ; serafimovich 2004 ) .",
    "based on evolutionary considerations , reynolds ( 1985 ) ascribed the optical emission from 0540@xmath769.3 to a pwn / ejecta interaction , consistent with the presence of optical emission from the innermost ejecta .",
    "the remaining interpretation for the spur emission in 292 is that it arises in an overdense shell of ejecta overtaken by the reverse shock .",
    "evidence for this picture may be found by comparing the morphology of the spur with hst optical images of cas a ( fesen 2001 ) , the most well - studied osnr .",
    "although the size scales of the cas a and 292 filaments differ by over an order of magnitude , they bear a striking similarity : both follow a concave shape , curving away from the snr expansion center , and both exhibit the scalloped morphology characteristic of rayleigh - taylor instabilities ( figure [ g292casa ] ) .",
    "most importantly , the ` wiggles ' in the spur point away from the expansion center , in close analogy to similar features seen in cas a. this suggests that high density material is penetrating into overpressurized , less dense material , precisely the condition required to produce rayleigh - taylor instabilities .",
    "these instabilities would likely leave a significant kinematic imprint on the ejecta velocity distribution , and may be partly responsible for much of the dispersion seen in the position - velocity diagram of the spur ( figure [ g292spurvelcircle ] ) .",
    "after following the procedure described earlier for subtracting stars from the rfp scans , we examined the h@xmath1 datacube for evidence of hydrogen and nitrogen line emission from 292 .",
    "the only scans exhibiting structure were the zero velocity scan and its two adjacent frames centered on @xmath762 and + 85 .",
    "interpolating the flux between rfp frames , we produced an image of the entire field at zero radial velocity . in figure [ g292haloiii ] the continuum - subtracted zero velocity h@xmath1 image is shown along with contours from the zero - velocity [ o  iii ] image .",
    "overall there is very little detailed correspondence between the h@xmath1 and [ o  iii ] morphologies of 292 . in particular , the high - velocity [ o  iii ] structures observed at all velocities in the rfp images exhibit little or no corresponding h@xmath1 emission .",
    "the most prominent features in the h@xmath1 image are a set of narrow filaments 30@xmath740 in length seen mostly on the eastern half of the h@xmath1 image .",
    "the filaments lie close to the o - rich spur , but due to the grossly dissimilar morphologies of the h@xmath1 and [ o  iii ] emissions , it is unlikely that they trace the same material .",
    "the filaments appear at zero radial velocity ( i.e. , in the rest frame of 292 ) , which raises the possibility that they are clouds of either shock - excited or photoionized circumstellar material .",
    "the lack of obvious emission from these filaments in both the [ o  iii ] rfp scans and the image of 292 places a strong constraint on the excitation mechanism of the h@xmath1 filaments : we can rule out both radiative shocks in o - rich material and radiative shocks faster than 100 in ism material ( hartigan , raymond & hartmann 1987 ) .",
    "if the filament emission is produced in slow ( @xmath53 100 ) radiative shocks , then we should be able to match the [ n  ii]:h@xmath1 flux ratios with the theoretically predicted values .",
    "we obtained a spectrum from one of the filaments ( the extraction box is marked in figure  [ g292haloiii ] and the spectrum is plotted in figure  [ g292halspec ] ) and fit the h@xmath1 and [ n  ii ] @xmath06548 line profiles .",
    "both lines were fit by voigt profiles with widths fixed at the instrumental values . to within the errors ( @xmath2115 ) the h@xmath1 and [ n  ii ] @xmath06548 lines",
    "are centered on zero radial velocity , consistent with an origin in the circumstellar medium around 292 .    from the profile",
    "fits we find that the ratio [ n  ii](@xmath06548):h@xmath1@xmath6 0.2 , with spectra extracted from the other nearby filaments exhibiting nearly the same ratios .",
    "theoretical values of the [ n  ii](@xmath06548):h@xmath1 ratio have been calculated by hartigan , raymond & hartmann ( 1987 ) for plane parallel shocks with equilibrium preionization and cosmic abundances .",
    "the ratios range from approximately 0.1 for a 90 shock ( higher values can be rejected because [ o  iii ] emission turns on very rapidly for faster shock speeds ) down to nearly zero for a shock speed of 20 . for this scenario to be correct ,",
    "we therefore require significant enhancement ( by factors of 2 or more ) in the nitrogen abundance in the ambient medium .",
    "this explanation also requires very high densities in the emitting filaments .",
    "the shock parameters of the 292 blast wave ( @xmath541 @xmath11 , @xmath32000 ; gw03 ) imply a high ram pressure , which combined with pressure conservation and low shock speed in the filaments ( @xmath5590 ) results in predicted preshock cloud densities @xmath23100 @xmath11 .",
    "the presence of such dense , localized structures in a predominantly low density medium seems unlikely , but it may be possible if the progenitor wind was highly clumped .",
    "an alternate explanation for the filaments is that they are low density ( n@xmath561 @xmath11 ) , neutral clouds photoionized by radiation from the shocks in 292 . as noted by hamilton & fesen ( 1986 ) for sn 1006 and morse ( 1996 ) for n132d ,",
    "the shocked metal - rich ejecta inside a supernova remnant is a source of hard uv and x - ray line radiation which escapes out into the ism and ionizes material surrounding the snr .",
    "another source of hard radiation is he  ii @xmath0304 photons from the ism material swept up by the blast wave .",
    "exposed to the dilute , time varying radiation field of the snr , nearby h  i clouds could remain significantly neutral while being heated to temperatures @xmath312,000@xmath715,000  k ( ghavamian 2000 ) .",
    "the resulting optical emission from the cloud would feature faint h@xmath1 , [ n  ii ] , [ s  ii ] and h@xmath57 emission and almost negligible [ o  iii ] ( as seen in tycho s snr , ghavamian 2000 ) . unlike the case of radiative shocks",
    ", the photoionization scenario can produce the observed [ n  ii]:h@xmath1 ratios without the need for enhancing the nitrogen abundances in the emitting clouds .",
    "a long - slit spectrum with larger wavelength coverage and higher spectral resolution is required to definitively establish the physical properties of the filaments in figure [ g292halspec ] and to decide between the photoionization and radiative shock scenarios .",
    "as we have already mentioned , there is an absence of high - velocity h@xmath1 and [ n  ii ] emission over the dynamical range sampled by our rfp data .",
    "this sort of material has been seen in cas a ( the ` fast - moving flocculi ' , or fmfs , reported in fesen , becker & blair ( 1987 ) ) .",
    "the cas a fmfs exhibit properties similar to both fmks and qsfs , namely high velocities and emission from nitrogen , hydrogen and helium .",
    "they are believed to be fragments of the progenitor photosphere which were expelled at high velocity during the supernova explosion . since the photosphere comprises the outermost layer of the ejecta , it is the first material to be overrun by the reverse shock .",
    "292 is nearly ten times older than cas a , while the survival time of dense , shocked knots is typically only on the order of a few decades .",
    "it seem likely then that any hydrogen / nitrogen - rich material ejected from the surface of the progenitor star would have been overrun and destroyed at an earlier evolutionary phase of 292 .      in our optical investigation of 292",
    "it is perhaps our study of the equatorial belt that benefits the most from the kinematic resolving power of the rfp .",
    "as previously defined ( see  [ global ] ) , the equatorial belt appears in the zero radial velocity [ o  iii ] image as a narrow bar of emission elongated in the e - w direction .",
    "this is very different from the larger , clumpier structure seen in the narrowband image in figure [ g292_oiii+allaps ] due to the geometric projection of high velocity knots ( such as k1 and k2 in figure [ g292_oiii+allaps ] ) onto the zero - velocity bar .",
    "we can trace the detailed structure of the belt at zero velocity using the marked features in figure [ g292_markbelt ] . in this image",
    "the most prominent portion of the bar ( b1 ) lies immediately west of the radio geometric center and is approximately 5 thick and 22 long .",
    "the [ o  iii ] surface brightness of b1 is @xmath320% of the brightest emission in the [ o  iii ] spur .",
    "fainter bar emission can also be seen extending to the east ( b2 ) and southeast ( b3 ) of b1 .",
    "both the bar and a patchy feature 2 further southwest ( marked as p1 in the figure ) are visible in our h@xmath1 image , although the bar is relatively fainter and smoother in h@xmath1 than in [ o  iii ] .",
    "as we will show in section 8.2 , features b1 and b2 appear to be optical counterparts to portions of the x - ray bar seen first in the and then the image of 292 . on the other hand ,",
    "another prominent zero - velocity feature seen in figure [ g292_markbelt ] , b3 , does not exhibit a clear x - ray counterpart .",
    "the rfp data of 292 shows that the [ o  iii ] emission is distributed over a wide range in velocity and consists of multiple components . therefore , to understand the interaction of 292 with its surrounding medium we must separate the ejecta knot [ o  iii ] emission from circumstellar / ambient [ o  iii ] emission .",
    "since much of the emission from 292 is emitted in the x - ray band , comparing our rfp data with the spectacular acis image of 292 provides a link between the optically - emitting components and global variations in density , temperature , composition and ionization state . for this comparison we utilized a 38 ks archival  observation of 292 , filtered to include only the oxygen k line emission between 0.55 and 0.75 kev",
    "we then smoothed the image with a boxcar of variable size , preserving a minimum s / n of 3 per smoothing beam .",
    "the smoothed 0.550.75 kev image of 292 is shown in the left panel of figure [ g292opticalxray ] .",
    "the x - ray contours are also shown to provide a reference for the eye in distinguishing contours around emission minima from contours around emission maxima .",
    "contours of the 0.55@xmath70.75 emission are overlaid onto the zero velocity [ o  iii ] and h@xmath1 images in the middle and right panels , respectively .      an important question arising from our rfp analysis",
    "is how the fast - moving ejecta seen in [ o  iii ] correlate with the chaotic x - ray emitting material seen in the acis image of 292 .",
    "the answer appears to depend on whether the optical emission in question belongs to the fmk population , equatorial belt or eastern spur material . in the following discussion",
    ", we present a qualitative first comparison between the optical and x - ray ejecta emission in 292 .",
    "_ fmks @xmath7_there is a clear spatial correlation between some fmks seen in the [ o  iii ] rfp data of 292 and the knots of x - ray ejecta seen in the image ( figure  [ g292fmks_xray+oiii ] ) . in particular , at the positions of the northern ( blueshifted ) knots , the extended x - ray features invisible at optical wavelengths often appear to terminate in fmks of [ o iii ] emission lacking x - ray counterparts .",
    "in addition , some of the [ o  iii ] fmks appear to be ` nested ' at intersection points between elongated strands of x - ray - emitting ejecta .    the correlations described above are consistent with ram pressure conservation in ejecta fragments of variable density . when an ejecta fragment encounters the overpressured gas behind the reverse shock , there are radiative shocks ( v@xmath58@xmath3100@xmath7200 ) driven into the densest portions of the clump ( n@xmath4100 @xmath11 ) , while partially radiative shocks ( v@xmath58@xmath14500 ) form in locations of intermediate density ( n@xmath1410 @xmath11 ) and fast non - radiative shocks ( v@xmath58@xmath41000 ) form in least dense ( n@xmath241 @xmath11 ) portions of the clump . in the resulting mixture of conditions ,",
    "the brightest optical and x - ray features often follow mutually exclusive spatial distributions , while material of intermediate surface brightness are often detected in both bands .",
    "whereas in a number of northern fmks we can trace what appear to be connected strands of ejecta material between the optical and x - ray images , most of the southern fmks tend to appear as solitary localized structures in [ o  iii ] surrounded by more extended , diffuse x - ray emission ( figure  [ g292fmks_xray+oiii ] ) .",
    "the dissimilarity in the x - ray - optical correlation between the northern and southern fmks may reflect a comparatively larger density contrast in the southern ejecta distribution : most of the southern knots may be composed of material too dense to produce anything but radiative shocks .",
    "it is unclear whether this inferrence , if correct , points to variations in the pattern of hydrodynamical instabilities during the sn event or whether it reflects differences beween the history of the reverse shock / ejecta interaction in the northern and southern portions of 292 .",
    "a large density contrast between the optically emitting and x - ray emitting material in the southern fmks would have consequences on the morphology and kinematics of the knots .",
    "using hydrodynamical simulations , klein , mckee & colella ( 1994 ) and jones , kang & tregillis ( 1994 ) showed that among the knots interacting with the low density ambient medium , those with a large density contrast parameter @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) remain intact and undecelerated longer than knots with smaller contrast parameters .",
    "anderson  ( 1994 ) found that reverse - shocked knots follow roughly a three - phase evolutionary process : ( 1 ) a bow shock phase , where the knot drives a shock into the low density medium ahead of it and in the process is itself compressed by a reverse shock , ( 2 ) an instability phase where the reverse shock exits the back side of the knot and a series of rayleigh - taylor and kelvin - helmholtz instabilities are initiated , and ( 3 ) a dispersal phase where the knot is strongly decelerated and the instabilities shred the structure into smaller pieces .",
    "anderson  ( 1994 ) noted that in a given knot the optical emission from radiative shocks will cease once the shock emerges from the rear of the knot .",
    "the fmks seen in [ o  iii ] have not been significantly decelerated ( see  [ fmks ] ) , so we can safely conclude that these knots have not yet reached the third ( dispersal ) phase of evolution .",
    "on the other hand , jones , kang & rudnick ( 1994 ) predict that the nonthermal radio emission from a knot will rise sharply during the second ( instability ) phase , as shearing forces amplify magnetic fields near the boundary of the knot . comparing the [ o  iii ] image with the 20 cm continuum image of gw03 , we find that some fmk groups , such as the two northernmost groups seen in figure  [ g292_oiii+allaps ] , are correlated with obvious patches of enhanced radio emission ( figure  [ g292fmks_20cm+oiii ] ) .",
    "in contrast , other fmks , such as the southernmost group of elongated knots in figure  [ g292_oiii+allaps ] , show little associated radio continuum emission ( figure  [ g292fmks_20cm+oiii ] ) .",
    "the presence of both optical and radio emission from the fmks suggests that the knots are somewhere between the bow - shock and instability phases of evolution .",
    "we note that the northernmost knots should be further into the instability phase than the southern knots , because of the greater relative prominence of radio emission from the northern knots .",
    "again , a higher density contrast for the southern knots would be consistent with this scenario . since it is rare to detect x - ray , optical , and radio emission from isolated fragments of ejecta in young snrs , further multiwavelength studies are clearly warranted .",
    "however , these are beyond the scope of the current article and are left to future work .    _ the spur @xmath7 _ the most coherent ejecta structure seen in [ o  iii ] images of 292 shows little morphological correlation with features detected in the image . as shown in the middle panel of figure [ g292opticalxray ] ,",
    "the top portion of the crescent - shaped spur is seen at zero velocity , at the eastern end of the equatorial bar structure .",
    "the top of the spur does not match any bright features in the image .",
    "the lower portion of the spur ( the redshifted structure seen out to + 1700 in figure [ g292redblue ] ) also shows little obvious x - ray emission .",
    "this suggests that virtually all of the main spur is composed of dense o - rich material .",
    "however , the streamers of material running southward of the spur exhibit [ o  iii ] clumps that lie at tips of x - ray knots .",
    "this may indicate that the ejecta material in the streamers is of more variable density , similar to what is seen in the fmks .",
    "the equatorial x - ray bar is perhaps the most prominent feature in the broadband x - ray image of 292 .",
    "when this feature was first discovered in the image , it was unclear whether the emission was from ejecta or circumstellar material . after finding that the kinematics of the [ o  iii ] emission in 1e 0102.2@xmath77219 could be explained by expansion of a distorted ring of high",
    "velocity ejecta , tuohy & dopita ( 1983 ) suggested that the equatorial belt seen in the image of 292 could be a similar structure seen nearly edge - on .",
    "however , detailed spectral analyses of the  x - ray data ( park  2002 , 2004 ; gonzalez & safi - harb 2003 ) cast doubt on this interpretation when these studies showed that the composition of the bar was generally consistent with cosmic abundances .",
    "a comparison of the optical and x - ray images in figure [ g292opticalxray ] indicates that the zero - velocity features b1 and b2 making up the [ o  iii ] bar are likely the optical counterparts of some parts of the x - ray structure seen by park  ( 2002 ) .",
    "the gap in the bar is closely matched in both the [ o  iii ] and x - ray images .",
    "in addition to the belt , a circular patch of [ o  iii ] emission 35 across can be seen approximately 13 southwest of b1 ( feature p1 in figure [ g292_oiii+allaps ] ) . in the x - ray image p1",
    "lies at the end of a ridge of material extending out from the center toward the southwest , suggesting that they are part of the same structure .",
    "some features such as b3 ( figure [ g292_markbelt ] ) are more difficult to interpret since they appear to be circumstellar material ( are seen only at zero radial velocity ) , but exhibit no clearly associated h@xmath1 or x - ray emission .",
    "other than these cases , finding direct matches between h@xmath1 and x - ray features in 292  is less straightforward .",
    "the x - ray emission and zero velocity h@xmath1 emission in figure [ g292opticalxray ] show little spatial correlation .",
    "as mentioned earlier , there is no x - ray emission from the h@xmath1 filaments on the eastern side of the remnant , indicating that they are not fast , non - radiative shocks in neutral gas ( i.e. , balmer - dominated shocks , chevalier & kirshner 1978 , chevalier , kirshner & raymond 1980 ) .",
    "the most plausible explanation for the equatorial bar emission in [ o  iii ] , h@xmath1 and x - rays is that it is produced by partially radiative shocks ( i.e. , shocks with incomplete cooling zones ) in moderate density ( @xmath61 @xmath11 ) circumstellar material .",
    "the incomplete cooling zones occur when the shock front has been moving through material for a time comparable to , but less than the cooling time scale of the shocked gas .",
    "features b1 , b2 and p1 in 292 may be the sites of partially radiative shocks in cosmic abundance material .",
    "partially radiative shocks have been modeled for the case of the cygnus loop by raymond  ( 1988 ) , who showed that the relative flux of [ o  iii ] to h@xmath57 ( or h@xmath1 ) is determined by the column density where the postshock flow terminates . therefore , if the shock is viewed at a time before the cooling zone has fully formed , it is possible for the output [ o  iii ] flux to significantly exceed that of both h@xmath57 and h@xmath1 .",
    "a truncated cooling zone in the equatorial bar would also explain its overall optical faintness , since the emitting gas would not have reached the full compression ( @xmath14100 ) attainable in a fully radiative shock .",
    "the best way to confirm the existence of a partially radiative shock would be to measure such ratios as [ o  iii]:h@xmath57 , [ o  ii]/h@xmath57 and [ o  i]:h@xmath1 from a long - slit spectrum of the bar and to compare the results with numerical shock model predictions .",
    "this will be the focus of a future study .",
    "clearly , 292 exhibits a very complex morphology . the optical study of wl05 and our rfp kinematic investigation",
    "have only begun to reveal the rich variations in elemental abundances , densities and kinematic properties across this osnr .",
    "we believe that further study will ultimately prove 292 to be every bit as interesting as cas a. from rutgers fabry - perot data we have extracted and fit [ o  iii ] @xmath05007 line profiles to 524 regions in 292 .",
    "our main results are as follows :    \\1 .",
    "the detection of numerous fast - moving knots of o - rich ejecta .",
    "these fmks are similar to the localized knots of ejecta seen in cas a. an interesting property of the fmks is that very few are detected at redshifted velocities ; either the o - rich ejecta are preferentially distributed on the near side of 292 or the reverse shock has not yet encountered all the ejecta on the far side of the remnant .",
    "the position - velocity diagram of the fmks exhibits the unmistakable kinematic signature of an expanding shell expanding at a radial velocity of 1700 . assuming a distance of 6 kpc",
    ", we derive an expansion age of 30003400 years for 292 .",
    "our fits indicate that the centroid of the fmk velocity distribution is only slightly redshifted ( @xmath3 + 100 ) .",
    "this systemic shift is substantially smaller than the shifts seen in the other known osnrs , and may reflect a difference in explosion asymmetry between 292 and other osnrs .",
    "the bright spur of o - rich material which dominates the optical appearance of 292 is kinematically resolved into a rippled shell of predominantly redshifted ejecta . however , interpreting the position - velocity diagram of the spur is not straightforward . extracting spectra from a grid of regions covering the face of the spur , we find that some points in the position - velocity diagram tend to aggregate into groups of constant velocity .",
    "these features are seen at @xmath7300 , 0 and + 950 , and we interpret them as ejecta clumps that have broken away from the main redshifted shell of expanding material .",
    "morphologically , the wiggles seen in the spur material at high redshifted velocities ( @xmath62600 ) are similar to the rayleigh - taylor unstable structures seen in cas a. as in cas a , the wiggles in the spur of 292 point away from the expansion center , indicating that the instabilities arise in reverse - shocked ejecta .",
    "this argues against the possibility that the spur is ejecta swept from the inside out by the relativistic wind nebula of the nearby pulsar psr j1124@xmath75916 .",
    "\\3 . optical detection of an equatorial bar matching portions of the bright x - ray bar structure seen in prior and  images of 292 .",
    "the bar is detected at the systemic radial velocity of 292 ( 0 , or v@xmath634.5 ) in both [ o  iii ] and h@xmath1 . the optical emission is faint , suggesting that the shocks driven into this material are just now becoming radiative .",
    "there are several other structures near the bar , but not aligned with it , which exhibit faint [ o  iii ] and h@xmath1 but are bright in x - rays .",
    "our detection of the bar in both [ o  iii ] and h@xmath1 confirms the assertion by park  ( 2002 , 2004 ) and gonzalez & safi harb ( 2003 ) that this material is of cosmic composition .",
    "the bar may be portion of a ring of circumstellar material similar to what is seen in sn 1987a , but with the difference that it is nearly an order of magnitude larger and of much lower density .",
    "there are a number of fmks along the line of sight to the belt that are kinematically resolved in our rfp scans but which give a stranded , chaotic appearance to this region in the narrowband [ o  iii ] images ( wl05 ) .",
    "there appears to be an absence of fully radiative shocks in cosmic composition material in 292 . all observed shocks are either fully non - radiative or partially radiative . from our rfp spectra",
    "we are unable to determine with certainty whether the belt is enhanced in nitrogen as may be expected for a circumstellar wind .",
    "deep long - slit spectroscopy and detailed modeling will be required to settle this issue .",
    "g.  would like to thank john raymond for helpful discussions on the shock physics presented in this paper , p.  f.  winkler for permission to use the narrowband [ o  iii ] image of 292 and bryan gaensler for making the 20 cm radio image available .",
    "the authors would also like to thank the referee for very helpful suggestions on clarifying the science of the paper and improving the presentation .",
    "this work was partially supported by chandra grants go0 - 1035x and go1 - 2052x , and nsf grant ast 9619510 .",
