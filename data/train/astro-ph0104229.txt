    "if antimatters exist in the universe , then their existence could be detected by either indirect search using gamma ray line spectrum , which comes from the annihilation of antimatter and matter ; or by the direct search using cosmic rays detector .",
    "on the other hand , if antimatters are absent in the universe , then cp - violation and baryon nonconservation must be observed .",
    "however , all such searches have been negative ( references 1 - 7 of alcaraz 1999 ) .",
    "there are no positive evidences supporting the existence or absence of antimatter . a direct detection of anti - nuclei such as anti - helium or anti - carbon could signal the existence of antimatter .",
    "the ams is an accurate , large acceptance magnetic spectrometer , which will be installed on the international space station for three years .",
    "the large acceptance and long duration will reduce the anti - helium limit to @xmath2 .",
    "dark matter is another unsolved puzzle of the universe .",
    "one of the candidates of dark matter , wimp ( weakly interacting massive particle ) , could annihilate in the halo of galaxy and produce an excess of positrons ( hardung & ramaty 1987 ; aharonian & atoyan 1991 ; dogiel & sharov 1990 ; tylka 1989 ; turner & wilczek 1990 ; kamionkowski & turner 1991 ) .",

    "since cosmic rays are charged particles , their trajectories are bent by the magnetic field . the geomagnetic field affects the arrival directions of cosmic rays , blocks lower energy cosmic rays , and traps some low energy particles in radiation belts .",
    "the geomagnetic field consists of two parts , the internal field ( main field ) produced by magnetic moments of the earth and the external field driven by the solar wind plasma .",
    "the internal and external fields merge at distance @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the mean earth radius 6371.2 km , forming the magnetosphere .",
    "although the ams flight was at low altitude of 380 km , the magnetic field lines passing through the ams path can reach an altitude of approximately 6.4 @xmath13 , well inside the magnetosphere .",
    "therefore , only the internal field is considered in the ams physics analysis .",
    "although the main field can be simplified as a dipole field , the error could be as big as @xmath14 in some regions .",
    "in realistic field , a series of spherical harmonics were used to fit to the measured value .",

    "also , the us department of defense fits the coefficients to the 12th degree , this field model is called the world magnetic model ( wmm ) .",
    "those two models are slightly different ( huang 2001 ) and their details can be found on the web .    along the west coast of south america and southern atlantic ocean",
    ", the magnetic field is the weakest on the earth surface . because of high radiations , many satellites experience some troubles when flying over these regions . the phenomenon in this region",

    "also particles with rigidity below the threshold can not escape from the geomagnetic field , i.e. particles are trapped by the geomagnetic field . in dipole field , the rigidity cutoff can be expressed in analytical form , called strmer cutoff ( strmer 1930 ) : @xmath24 @xmath25    [ cols= \" > , < \" , ]     in realistic field , the cutoff can not be formulated as a simple formula .",
    "the cutoff becomes a band of intermittent transition , which is called penumbra .",

    "figure 3 shows the vertical cutoff , @xmath26 at altitude of 40 km .",
    "[ fig : rigcut ]      for particles trapped inside the geomagnetic field , there are three types of motions ( walt 1994 ) .",
    "they are the gyrations along a guiding center magnetic field line , the north - south bounce motions due to the repelling force of convergent magnetic fields , and the east - west drift motions due to gradient drift and curvature drift .",
    "the positive charged particles drift eastward while the negative charged particles drift westward .",
    "after the ams01 flight , the detector was re - examined , first using the heavy ion ( he , c ) beam from 1.0 to 5.6 gv in gsi - darmstadt , and then using the proton and pion beam 2 to 14 gv in cern .",
    "the performance of the detector remained the same before , during , and after the flight ( alcaraz 1999 ) .    at 2 to 10gv , the resolution is approximately 0.11- 0.14 . at lower rigidity ,",
    "the resolution becomes worse due to scattering , while at higher rigidity , the resolution deteriorates due to limited resolution of silicon tracker .",
    "major contaminations of antihelium are confusions of charge magnitude @xmath27 and charge sign .",
    "the probability of confusion of @xmath28 from @xmath29 was estimated to be less than @xmath30 by the measurements of @xmath31 from the tof and tracker .",
    "particle directions are determined by the tof .",

    "in addition , events with collinear delta rays were rejected by identifying excess of energy within 5 mm of the track .",
    "finally , a probabilistic function was constructed from measurements of velocity , rigidity , and energy loss which described the compatibility of these measurements with passage of helium or antihelium .",
    "the last four candidates fail to be compatible with antihelium , and @xmath36 helium with rigidity of 1 to 140gv survives all the cuts .",
    "the antimatter limits at 95% confidence level are then estimated by the following three methods .",

    "they account for 5% at below 0.5 gev and decrease rapidly at higher energy .",
    "the deuterons abundance is about 2% in cosmic rays .",
    "both pions and deuterons can be rejected by requiring the measured mass to be consistent with mass of proton within three sigmas .",
    "owing to the detector resolution and possible energy loss in detector materials , the measured spectrum need to be unfolded to get the incident spectrum .",

    "the flux ratio of positrons to electrons varies with magnetic latitude and can be as large as 4 near the magnetic equator .",
    "some balloon experiments , operated in high latitude regions , obtained a ratio of approximately 1 .",
    "the excess of antimatter arouses questions concerning their origin . at high latitude",
    ", these albedo positrons could be higher than the cutoff and be mistaken as cosmic rays .",
    "owing to the geomagnetic rigidity cutoff , there are more cosmic rays coming from the west than from the east .",
    "this east - west effect is the major factor behind the large positron electron ratio .",
    "because of the geomagnetic field , only the positrons coming from the west and electrons coming from the east have the chance to move upward . since the primary cosmic ray fluxes from the west are larger than those from the east , the secondary positrons from the west are more abundant than the electrons from the east .",
    "the difference in rigidity cutoff decreases with increasing magnetic latitude , so does the flux ratio .",
    "a simple model was proposed to explain this large @xmath99 ratio , shown in figure 19 ( huang 2000 ) .",
    "although this is just a first - order approximation , the quantitative agreements evidence the validity of this model .",
    "[ fig : rep ]      events with @xmath80 originate mostly in high latitude region or have high rigidity .",
    "figure 20 shows some plots of these events .",
    "their flight - time distributions do not have two distinct peaks , although the @xmath69 can still be used for classifying sft and lft .",
    "some lft particles can drift over several drift periods .",
    "this is the typical behaviors of the l - shell splitting at l - shell @xmath1004 .",
    "also , the rigidity of these events are inside the penumbra , their trajectories become irregular .",
    "the source of sft particles is also uniformly distributed . however , the void in fig .",
    "[ fig : sft_src ] does not appear in this figure . unlike those in the fig .",
    "[ fig : lft_src ] , the sources of lft particles spread over all longitudes .",
    "these penumbra events have different distributions . _ the lft penumbra events are not included in _ ( alcaraz 2000b ) .",
    "[ fig : highlat ]",
    "the physics results of the ams01 shuttle flight are summarized as follows .",
    "* antimatter limit : @xmath101 for rigidity 1 . to 140gv / c@xmath102 . * primary cosmic ray spectrum in 10gev @xmath103 r @xmath103 200gev , @xmath104 where + @xmath105gev@xmath106/(m@xmath102 s sr mev ) + and @xmath107 .",
    "* measurements of primary electrons and positrons are consistent with previous results . *",
    "many particles are discovered below the geomagnetic rigidity cutoff , these particle must originate in the atmosphere and then rebound to space , i.e. atmospheric albedo particles . * for particle well below the cutoff ,",
    "two groups of atmospheric albedo particles are found , short flight - time and long flight - time particles . * * short flight - time particles are related to bounce motions , their sources are uniformly distributed , and they cover l - shell up to 6 . * * long flight - time particles are related to longitudinal drift motions , their source / sink positions are distributed at two distinct areas at east / west of the magnetic prime - meridian ( @xmath97 ) , and they cover l - shell up to 4 . * * a large latitude - dependent albedo e+/e- ratio is discovered .",
    "a possible explanation is the east - west effect .",
    "* particles near the cutoff exist mostly in high latitude and could drift over several drift periods .",
    "their source distributions are different from those of particles well below cutoff .",
