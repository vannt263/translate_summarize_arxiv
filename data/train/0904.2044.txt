    "neutron stars observed in nature are magnetized with the typical magnetic field strength @xmath2@xmath3",
    "g @xcite . for a special class of the neutron stars such as soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) and anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) , the field strength is often much larger than the canonical value as @xmath4 g , and these objects are collectively referred as magnetars @xcite .",
    "although such stars are estimated to be only a subclass ( @xmath5 ) of the canonical neutron stars  @xcite , much attention has been drawn because they pose many astrophysically exciting but unresolved problems .",
    "giant flaring activities observed in the sgrs have given us good opportunities to study the coupling of the interior to the magnetospheric structures @xcite , but we still know little of the relationship between the crustal fraction and the subsequent starquakes ( see references in @xcite ) .",
    "the origin of the large magnetic field is also a big problem , whether descended from the main sequence stars @xcite or generated at post - collapse in the rapidly rotating neutron star @xcite . assuming large magnetic fields before core - collapse , extensive magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) stellar collapse simulations have been carried out recently @xcite towards the understanding of the formation mechanism of magnetars .",
    "here it is worth mentioning that the gravitational waves could be a useful tool to supply us with the information about magnetar interiors @xcite . while in a microscopic point of view",
    ", effects of magnetic fields larger than the so - called qed limit of @xmath6 , on the eoss ( e.g. , @xcite ) and the radiation processes have been also elaborately investigated ( see @xcite for a review ) . for the understanding of the formation and evolution of the magnetars ,",
    "the unification of these macroscopic and microscopic studies is necessary , albeit not an easy task .    in order to investigate those fascinating issues ,",
    "the construction of the equilibrium configuration of magnetars may be one of the most fundamental problems .",
    "starting from the pioneering study by @xcite , extensive studies have been done and this research field is now experiencing `` renaissance '' @xcite , in which different levels of sophistication in the treatment of the magnetic field structure , equations of state ( eoss ) , and the general relativity , have been undertaken . among them , a more sophistication is required for the studies employing the newtonian gravity , because the general relativity(gr ) should play an important role for the equilibrium configurations of compact objects like neutron stars . as mentioned below , typical densities for neutron stars interior exceed the nuclear density @xmath7 .",
    "in such a high density region , the pressure @xmath8 and rest mass density @xmath9 becomes comparable , namely @xmath10 with @xmath11 being the speed of light .",
    "in such a regime , the newtonian gravity is too weak to gravitationally bind the neutron stars without the general relativity , that is @xmath12 becomes the orders of magnitude @xmath13 with @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 being gravitational constant , mass and radius of star .",
    "it is noted here that the equilibrium configurations of relativistic stars without magnetic fields have been elaborately studied using the lorene code @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , however , the method of constructing a fully general relativistic star with arbitrarily magnetic structures is still not available . in most previous studies , the weak magnetic fields and/or purely _",
    "poloidal _ magnetic fields have been assumed .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have treated relativistic stellar models containing purely poloidal magnetic fields . @xcite",
    "have analyzed similar models using a perturbative approach .",
    "@xcite have investigated structures of mixed poloidal - toroidal magnetic fields around a spherical star by using a perturbative technique .",
    "as shown in the mhd simulations of core - collapse supernovae ( see @xcite for a review ) , the toroidal magnetic fields can be efficiently amplified due to the winding of the initial seed poloidal fields as long as the core rotates differentially .",
    "after core bounce , as a result , the toroidal fields generically dominate over the poloidal ones even if there is no toroidal field initially . even for the weakly magnetized star",
    "prior to core - collapse , it should be mentioned that the magnetorotational instability @xcite could be another effective mechanism for generating large toroidal magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "as pointed by @xcite , such large magnetic fields generated by those processes may be confined inside the neutron star for thousands of years . moreover , recent calculations of stellar evolution suggest that toroidal component of magnetic field dominates over poloidal one with the orders of magnitude @xmath17 in the newly born neutron star after supernova explosion  @xcite .",
    "these outcomes seem to indicate that some neutron stars could have _ toroidal _ fields much higher than the poloidal ones , which motivated @xcite to study the equilibrium configurations with purely toroidal fields . in the study ,",
    "the master equations were derived for the first time for obtaining the relativistic rotating stars with the toroidal fields . on the other hand",
    ", it is well known that pure toroidal magnetic field in star is unstable  @xcite . @xcite",
    "have investigated the evolution of magnetic field in stellar interior and found `` twisted torus '' field configuration is stable , in which the poloidal and toroidal magnetic field have comparable field strength .",
    "recently , @xcite have confirmed the tayler instability in the neutron stars with the general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulation ( grmhd ) under axisymmetric condition .",
    "important finding of this study is the toroidal magnetic fields settle down to the _ new _ equilibrium states with the circular motion in meridian plane .",
    "this suggests that the toroidal magnetic field may remain in neutron stars even if the poloidal magnetic field is much weaker than the toroidal one .",
    "however there may remain a room yet to be sophisticated in @xcite that the polytropic eoss have been used for simplicity . in general , the central density of neutron stars is considered to be higher than the nuclear saturation density @xcite . since we still do not have an definite answer about the eos in such a higher regime ,",
    "many kinds of the nuclear eoss have been proposed ( e.g. , @xcite ) depending on the descriptions of the nuclear forces and the possible appearance of the exotic physics ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "while the stiffness of the polytropic eos is kept constant globally inside the star , it should depend on the density in the realistic eoss . since the equilibrium configurations are achieved by the subtle and local balance of the gravitational force , centrifugal force , the lorentz force , and the pressure gradient ,",
    "it is a nontrivial problem how the equilibrium configurations change for the realistic eoss .",
    "these situations motivate us to study the effects of the realistic eoss on the general relativistic stellar equilibrium configurations with purely toroidal magnetic fields . for the purpose",
    ", we incorporate the realistic eoss to the numerical scheme by @xcite .",
    "four kinds of eoss , of sly @xcite , fps @xcite , shen @xcite , and lattimer - swesty(ls ) @xcite are adopted , which are often employed in the recent mhd studies relevant for magnetars . by so doing , we construct thousands of equilibrium stars for a wide range of parameters with different kinds of eoss . as shown by @xcite",
    ", the toroidal field tends to distort a stellar shape prolately because the toroidal field lines behave like a rubber belt , pulling in the matter around the magnetic axis .",
    "such a prolate - shaped neutron star is pointed out to be optimal gravitational - waves emitters , depending on the degree of the prolateness @xcite .",
    "thus , we pay attention to how the prolateness is affected by the realistic eoss . for making such configurations , maximum magnetic field strength deep inside the magnetars can become as high as @xmath18 g , which could be generated due to @xmath19 dynamos in the rapidly rotating neutron stars @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the possibility of such ultra - magnetic fields has not been rejected so far , because what we can learn from the magnetar s observations by their periods and spin - down rates is only their surface fields ( @xmath20 g ) .",
    "we construct equilibrium sequences , along which the total baryon rest mass and/or the magnetic flux with respect to the meridional cross - section keep constant .",
    "it has been suggested that the magnetic field will decay by the process of the ohmic decay , ambipolar diffusion , and hall drift ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this implies the magnetic flux might not be well conserved during quasi - steady evolution of isolated neutron stars . however",
    ", taking account into these effect to the neutron star s evolution requires extensive efforts .",
    "hence , as a first approximation , we explore the evolutionary sequences by use of the equilibrium sequences of constant rest mass and magnetic flux .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the master equations for obtaining equilibrium configurations of rotating stars with purely toroidal magnetic fields are briefly reviewed in sec .",
    "[ sec : basic ] .",
    "the numerical scheme for computing the stellar models and eoss we employ in this study are briefly described in sec .",
    "[ sec : numsch ] .",
    "[ sec : result ] is devoted to showing numerical results .",
    "summary and discussion follow in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] . in this paper",
    ", we use geometrical units with @xmath21 .",
    "master equations for the rotating relativistic stars containing purely toroidal magnetic fields have been derived in @xcite .",
    "hence , we only give a brief summary for later convenience .",
    "assumptions to obtain the equilibrium models are summarized as follows ; ( 1 ) equilibrium models are stationary and axisymmetric .",
    "( 2 ) the matter source is approximated by a perfect fluid with infinite conductivity .",
    "( 3 ) there is no meridional flow of the matter .",
    "( 4 ) the equation of state for the matter is barotropic .",
    "although we employ realistic eoss in this paper , this barotropic condition can be maintained as explained in subsection [ eos ] .",
    "( 5 ) the magnetic axis and rotation axis are aligned .    because the circularity condition ( see , e.g. @xcite ) holds under these assumptions ,",
    "the metric can be written , following  @xcite and  @xcite , in the form , @xmath22    where the metric potentials , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , are functions of @xmath27 and @xmath28 only .",
    "we see that the non - zero component of faraday tensor @xmath29 in this coordinate is @xmath30 . in case of purely toroidal magnetic field",
    ", the grad - shafranov equation is known to be trivial because it is given only in terms of the @xmath31 component of the vector potential ( see kiuchi & yoshida ( 2008 ) for details ) .",
    "then the toroidal magnetic field can be determined by the integrability condition of the equation of motion ( see eq.(3 ) ) .",
    "integrability of the equation of motion of the matter requires , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is an arbitrary function of @xmath34 . the variables @xmath9 and @xmath35 represent the rest mass density and relativistic specific enthalpy , respectively . integrating the equation of motion of the matter , we arrive at the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium , @xmath36 where @xmath37 with @xmath38 being the angular velocity of the matter and @xmath39 is an integration constant .    here",
    ", we have further assumed the rigid rotation . to compute specific models of the magnetized stars ,",
    "we need specify the function forms of @xmath33 , which determines the distribution of the magnetic fields . according to @xcite , we take the following simple form , @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are constants .",
    "regularity of toroidal magnetic fields on the magnetic axis requires that @xmath43 . if @xmath44 , the magnetic fields automatically vanish at the surface of the star . @xcite",
    "have investigated how the choice of @xmath42 affects the magnetic field distribution . in this study , we consider the @xmath45 case because in the general relativistic mhd simulation , @xcite have found that magnetic distribution with @xmath46 is unstable against axisymmetric perturbations .",
    "note that @xcite has suggested that the magnetic field configuration of @xmath45 is unstable against non - axisymmetric perturbations .",
    "to solve the master equations numerically , we employ the kiuchi - yoshida scheme  @xcite , which does not care about the function form of eos . hence , it is straight forward to update our numerical code for incorporating the realistic eoss discussed below .    after obtaining solutions , it is useful to compute global physical quantities characterizing the equilibrium configurations to clearly understand the properties of the sequences of the equilibrium models . in this paper , we compute the following quantities : the gravitational mass @xmath15 , the baryon rest mass @xmath47 , the total angular momentum @xmath48 , the total rotational energy @xmath49 , the total magnetic energy @xmath50 , the magnetic flux @xmath51 , the gravitational energy @xmath52 and the mean deformation rate @xmath53 , whose definitions are explicitly given in @xcite . more explicitly , the mean deformation rate @xmath53 is defined as @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 with @xmath57 being the energy density of the matter .",
    "( g ) circumferential radius @xmath58 is defined as @xmath59 with @xmath60 being the coordinate radius at the stellar equatorial surface .",
    "for all the models , checking the relativistic virial identities   @xcite , we confirm the typical values are orders of magnitude @xmath61 , which are acceptable values for present numerical scheme .      as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] , equation of state ( eos ) is an important ingredient for determining the equilibrium configurations . instead of conducting an extensive study as done before for the studies of rotating equilibrium configurations in which a greater variety of eoss were employed , ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein )",
    ", we adopt here four kinds of eoss , of sly @xcite , fps @xcite , shen @xcite , and lattimer - swesty(ls ) @xcite , which are often employed in the recent mhd studies relevant for magnetars .    in the study of cold neutron stars , the @xmath62-equilibrium condition with respect to beta decays of the form @xmath63 and @xmath64 , can be well validated as for the static properties . since",
    "neutrinos and antineutrinos escape from the star , their chemical potentials vanish at zero - temperature @xmath65 with @xmath49 being the temperature .",
    "thus the @xmath62-equilibrium condition can be expressed as @xmath66 , with @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 being the chemical potentials of neutron , electron , and proton , respectively . with the charge neutrality condition",
    ", we can determine the three independent thermodynamic variables , ( for example the pressure as @xmath70 , with @xmath71 being the electron fraction ) , can only be determined by a single variable , which we take to be the density , namely @xmath72 @xcite , noting here that @xmath65 is assumed for the case of the cold neutron stars .",
    "thanks to this , we can use the formalism mentioned in sec .  [",
    "sec : basic ] without violating the barotropic condition of the eoss .",
    "it should be noted that @xcite has recently argued the breaking of the barotropic condition leads to the stabilization of the magnetic equilibria .",
    "this tells us the importance to model the neutron stars by multicomponent fluid , such as neutrons , electrons , and protons @xcite .",
    "however , taking into account this effect to equilibrium configuration is beyond scope of this article .",
    "furthermore , the barotropic condition plays a crucial role to obtain the bernoulli equation eq .",
    "( [ eq : ber ] ) .",
    "hence , in this article , we only consider the barotropic case for simplicity .    at the maximum densities",
    "higher than @xmath73 , muons can appear , and higher than @xmath74 @xcite , one may take into the possible appearance of hyperons @xcite .",
    "however , since the muon contribution to pressure at the higher density has been pointed to be very small @xcite , and we still do not have detailed knowledge of the hyperon interactions , we prefer to employ the above neutron star matter , namely @xmath75 , model to higher densities . in the following ,",
    "we shortly summarize features of the eoss employed here .",
    "the lattimer - swesty eos @xcite has been used for many years as a standard in the research field of core - collapse supernova explosions and the subsequent neutron star formations ( see references in @xcite ) ; it is based on the compressible drop model for nuclei together with dripped nucleons .",
    "the values of nuclear parameters are chosen according to nuclear mass formulae and other theoretical studies with the skyrme interaction .",
    "the shen eos @xcite is a rather modern one and currently often used in the research field .",
    "the shen eos is based on the relativistic mean field theory with a local density approximations , which has been constructed to reproduce the experimental data of masses and radii of stable and unstable nuclei ( see references in @xcite ) .",
    "fps are modern version of an earlier microscopic eos calculations by @xcite , which employs both two body ( u14 ) and three - body interactions ( tni ) . in the sly eos @xcite , neutron - excess dependence",
    "is added to the fps eos , which is more suitable for the neutron star interiors . as for the fps and sly eoss",
    ", we use the fitting formulae presented in @xcite .",
    "in constructing one equilibrium sequence , we have three parameters to choose , namely the central density @xmath76 , the strength of the magnetic field parameter @xmath41 , and the axis ratio @xmath77 . changing these parameters",
    ", we have to seek solutions in as wide parameter range as possible to study the properties of the equilibrium sequences in detail . for clarity , we categorize the computed models into two , namely , non - rotating or rotating and discuss them separately , as done in @xcite .    to calculate the non - rotating models , @xmath76 and @xmath41 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : funck ] ) ) have to be given with @xmath78 , where @xmath38 is the angular velocity . for the rotating models , one need specify the axis ratio @xmath77 in addition to @xmath76 and @xmath41 , where @xmath79 and @xmath60 are the polar and the equatorial radii , respectively . to explore properties of the relativistic magnetized star models with the realistic eoss",
    ", we construct thousands of the equilibrium models for each eos , namely for the non - rotating cases , @xmath80 models in the parameter space of @xmath81 , and for the rotating cases , @xmath82 models in the parameter space of @xmath83 . throughout this section",
    ", we mainly pay attention to the magnetic field dominant models , i.e. , the models with @xmath84 , since we are concerned with the structure of the magnetar .",
    "for some magnetars , the condition of @xmath84 could be realized because the internal magnetic field strength could reach an order of @xmath18 g and the typical spin period is several seconds .",
    "it should be noted that for the very fast spinning stars in which the dynamo process will work , the condition of @xmath85 might be realized and such models are important .",
    "however , recent observations support the fossil origin  @xcite rather than the dynamo process and our main interest is the observed magnetar so far . hence , in this paper , we mainly refer to the models with @xmath84 .",
    "first let us consider the static configurations for the following two reasons .",
    "( 1 ) since the magnetars and the high field neutron stars observed so far are all slow rotators , the static models could well be approximated to such stars .",
    "( 2 ) in the static models , one can see purely magnetic effects on the equilibrium properties because there is no centrifugal force and all the stellar deformation is attributed to the magnetic stress .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : non - rot ] , characteristic quantities are given for a @xmath86 star with the sly eos characterized by @xmath87 $ ] , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 .",
    "in the figure , it can be seen that the strong toroidal magnetic fields peaking in the vicinity of the equatorial plane ( panel ( c ) ) , acts through the lorentz forces ( see the arrows pointing perpendicular to the magnetic axis in panel ( d ) ) to pinch the matter around the magnetic axis , making the stellar shape prolate ( panel ( a ) ) .",
    "the maximum field strength reaches to @xmath92 for this model . from panel ( b ) , the regions where the magnetic pressure dominates over the matter pressure are seen to be formed . indeed , the toroidal magnetic field lines behave like a rubber belt that is wrapped around the waist of the star .",
    "the matter fastened by this belt becomes stiff as seen from the large adiabatic indices shown in panel ( e ) , where the definition of the adiabatic index is @xmath93 with @xmath94 being the entropy of the matter ( @xmath95 for the cold neutron stars considered here ) .",
    "these gross properties are common to the other realistic eoss . in the following , we move on to look the differences more in detail .",
    "figures [ fig : non - rot - fps]-[fig : non - rot - ls ] show the equilibrium configurations for the other eoss of fps , shen , and ls , plotted in the same style as fig .",
    "[ fig : non - rot ] . the central density for each model is set to be the same .",
    "comparing fig .",
    "[ fig : non - rot ] to fig .",
    "[ fig : non - rot - fps ] , the profiles of the stars with sly and fps eoss are quite similar , reflecting the resemblance of the stiffness of the eoss below @xmath87 $ ] considered here ( see fig . 1 in @xcite ) . on the other hand , the density distribution of the star with shen eos is found to become less prolate than those with sly and fps eos ( compare fig .",
    "[ fig : non - rot](a ) with [ fig : non - rot - shen](a ) ) .",
    "this can be understood by considering the differences in the distributions of the magnetic and matter pressures .",
    "the concentration of the magnetic field to the stellar center for shen eos is weaker than that for sly or fps eos ( compare fig .  [",
    "fig : non - rot](c ) with [ fig : non - rot - shen](c ) ) .",
    "moreover , the stiffened matter with higher adiabatic indices extends further out for shen eos than for sly or fps eos , ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : non - rot](e ) and [ fig : non - rot - shen](e ) ) , which means that the matter pressure stays relatively large up to the stellar surface for shen eos . as a result",
    ", the regions in which the magnetic pressure is dominant over the matter pressure can appear rather in the outer regions for shen eos than for sly or fps eos ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : non - rot](b ) -[fig : non - rot - shen](c ) ) .",
    "this implies that the magnetic fields for shen eos are effectively less fastening to pinch the matter around the magnetic axis than those for sly or fps eos . for ls eos",
    ", the regions in which the ratio of the magnetic pressure to the matter pressure , @xmath96 , is large also exist near the stellar surface ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : non - rot - ls](b ) ) .",
    "however , the density distribution is found to become similar to that for sly and fps eoss but not for shen eos because the magnitude of @xmath96 is sufficiently higher than that for shen eos , producing the strong fastening ( see the color legend of fig .",

    "the left thick red line represents the spherical star limit and the right thick red line does the non - convergence limit ( @xmath99 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : funck ] ) ) beyond which any solution can not converge with the present numerical scheme @xcite .",
    "strictly speaking , values of @xmath41 at the non - convergence limit depend on the central density @xmath76 .",
    "however , we confirm the non - convergence limit appears around @xmath100 for all the central densities we set in this study .",
    "thus , the non - convergence limits ( the right thick red lines in fig . [ fig : nonrot - qc - adm ] ) look like smooth curves . for all the eoss , the physically acceptable solutions exist in the regions bounded by these two lines .",
    "the filled circles on each line represents the maximum mass models . to focus on the sequence with the maximum mass , which we call as the maximum mass sequences henceforth , in table  [ tab : nonrot - admmax ] , we summarize their global physical quantities : the gravitational mass @xmath15 , the baryon rest mass @xmath47 , the circumferential radius at the equator @xmath58 , the maximum strength of the magnetic fields @xmath101 normalized by @xmath102 $ ] , the ratio of the magnetic energy to the gravitational energy @xmath103 , and the mean deformation rate @xmath53",
    "it should be noted that , irrespective of the eoss , the sequences with @xmath104 encounter the non - convergence limits before it reaches the maximum mass point ( see also table  [ tab : nonrot - admmax ] ) .    from table  [ tab : nonrot - admmax ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : nonrot - qc - adm ] , we can see that regardless of the different eoss , the maximum gravitational masses @xmath15 , do not increase with the magnetic flux so much , in comparison with the other global quantities .",
    "this is in contrast to the polytropic eos , in which the maximum masses increase almost monotonically with the magnetic flux @xcite . for clarifying the relation ,",

    "[ fig : phi - mmax](a ) , in which the increasing rates of the maximum masses , @xmath105 , with @xmath106 being the maximum masses of the spherical stars , are shown for the different eoss along the maximum mass sequences .",
    "it is seen that the maximum masses , irrespective of the different eoss , once decrease , and then begin to increase as @xmath103 becomes larger .",
    "this first decrease is because the volume of the high density regions can temporary become smaller as the magnetized stars transform to the prolate shape due to the magnetic fastening , while keeping the changes in the central density small .",
    "in fact , the central densities of the maximum mass sequences stay almost constant with those of the spherical cases ( see table  [ tab : nonrot - admmax ] ) . for the polytropic eos with @xmath107 (",
    "referred as pol2 in fig .",
    "[ fig : phi - mmax](a ) ) , with @xmath108 being the polytropic constant , the different trend can be seen .",
    "the masses keep increasing as the function of @xmath103 .",
    "as shown in table  [ tab : nonrot - admmax ] ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : phi - mmax](a ) ) , the maximum gravitational mass of the neutron stars with @xmath109 is larger than that with @xmath110 for fps and ls eos , but smaller for sly and shen eos . it should be noted this does not imply the maximum mass with sly or shen eos never increases because this is set by the non - convergence limit mentioned above .    fig . [",
    "fig : phi - mmax](b ) shows the degree of the deformation for the different eoss as a function of @xmath103 before the non - convergence limit .",
    "it is found that the degree can reach to an order of @xmath111 irrespective of the eoss . comparing with the polytropic case ( pol2 ) , we find the mean deformation rates become smaller for the models with the realistic eoss .",
    "the reason is as follows .",
    "the magnetic belt effects , due to which the matter is pinched , subside in the vicinity near the equatorial plane less than @xmath112 km ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : non - rot](d ) -[fig : non - rot - ls](d ) ) .",
    "the adiabatic indices there are generally higher than 2 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : non - rot](e)-[fig : non - rot - ls](e ) ) irrespective of the different eoss .",

    "[ fig : rot ] , we display typical distribution of the rotating equilibrium star taking a @xmath117 model with the sly eos characterized by @xmath118 $ ] , @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 .",
    "this model has the maximum magnetic field strength of @xmath124 and rotates in the mass - shedding limit . comparing fig .",
    "[ fig : rot ] with fig .",
    "[ fig : non - rot ] , we see that basic properties of the rotational equilibrium structure are similar to those of the static models .",
    "difference between them only appears near the equatorial surface of the stars .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rot ] , the density distribution is stretched from the rotation axis outward due to the centrifugal force and the shape of the stellar surface becomes oblate , which can be also seen from the value of the axis ratio @xmath77 . on the other hand ,",
    "the equi - density contours deep inside the stars are prolate , as confirmed from the value of the mean deformation rate @xmath53 . in the central regions , the magnetic fastening of the matter generically dominates over the centrifugal forces .",
    "it is should be emphasized that we here single out the magnetic field dominated models in which the ratio of the rotational energy to the gravitational energy @xmath125 is much smaller than the ratio of the magnetic energy to the gravitational energy @xmath103 even when they rotate at the breakup angular velocity because we focus on the magnetic effects on the stellar structure .",
    "in fact , typical values of @xmath103 and @xmath125 amongst the models computed in this study are orders of @xmath13 and @xmath126 , respectively .",
    "( as we will see later , we can not pick out such magnetic field dominated models for the supramassive sequences of the magnetized stars with the realistic eoss . )",
    "the effects of the rotation on the stellar structures are therefore secondary in the models shown in this subsection .",
    "likewise , the effects of the eos on the rotational equilibrium sequences are predominantly determined by the ones in the non - rotating sequences , which we mentioned in the previous section .      in this subsection , we pay attention to the constant baryon mass sequences of the rotating magnetized stars . as discussed in  @xcite , it is possible to single out a sequence of the equilibrium stars by keeping the baryon rest mass and the magnetic flux constant simultaneously .",
    "such equilibrium sequences may model the isolated neutron stars that evolve adiabatically losing angular momentum via the gravitational / electromagnetic radiations . for simplicity , we omit the evolution in the function @xmath33 ( eq . ( [ eq : i - con1 ] ) ) , which will change as a result of losing angular momentum , although there has been no simple way to determine it so far .",
    "it should be noted that the efficient gravitational radiations can be made possible only if the spin and magnetic axes are misaligned @xcite .",
    "however , including the misalignment to our model is extremely difficult because it breaks down the equilibrium condition due to the gravitational radiation . with the alignment axes , the spin - down via electromagnetic radiations could be possible if the outside of the star is non - vacuum @xcite .",
    "however , the condition that the outside of the star is vacuum is crucial here for calculating the equilibrium configurations . furthermore , the method to take into account the mixed ( poloidal - toroidal ) field in general relativistic equilibrium configuration is not still established as we mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] .",
    "bearing these caveats , we boldly pay attention to the constant baryon mass and magnetic flux sequence obtained from the equilibrium configurations to mimic the evolution of the magnetized neutron star in the following .",
    "as done in  @xcite , we divide the equilibrium sequences of the magnetized stars into two classes , _ normal _ and _ supramassive _ equilibrium sequences . in this study ,",
    "the _ normal _ ( _ supramassive _ ) equilibrium sequence is defined as an equilibrium sequence whose baryon rest mass is smaller ( larger ) than the maximum baryon rest mass of the non - magnetized and non - rotating stars . in table",
    "[ tab : bmass ] , the maximum baryon rest mass of the spherical ( magnetized rotating ) stars , which are referred as @xmath127 , with the each eoss , are given .",
    "note that @xmath128 is the maximum baryon mass of the magnetized star models calculated in this study ."
