    "initially the azimuthal distribution @xmath5 of light quarks and gluons is isotropic and the anisotropy develops during the expansion as an image of the initial eccentricity in coordinate space .",
    "the heavy quarks - created in a hard process - are initially isotropically distributed in the transverse momentum space .",
    "the final @xmath6 of heavy quarks shows therefore how the anisotropy of the light quarks and gluons is transferred to heavy quarks and hence reflects this interaction at later times .",
    "recently we have published an approach @xcite in which we have shown that the energy loss as well as the @xmath7 distribution of the single non - photonic electrons in heavy ion reactions can be understood in a pqcd based model in which the heavy quarks interact with the expanding quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) . in contradistinction to former approaches this model has two improvements , 1 ) a running coupling constant and 2 ) an infrared regulator in the t - channel , which has been determined by physical requirements .",
    "it is the purpose of this article to explore the details of the interaction between the heavy quarks and the qgp in this model , to determine the consequences for observables , to explore whether there is a simple way to describe the energy loss in this complicated environment and to predict correlations between the simultaneously produced @xmath0 and @xmath1 quarks .",
    "furthermore we extend the model to the future lhc collider energies and confront the results with other theories like the ads / cft approach .",
    "the model @xcite to describe the momentum distribution of heavy quarks or heavy mesons produced in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions has five major parts which we will describe one after the other : 1 ) the initial distributions of the heavy quarks , 2 ) the description of the expanding quark gluon plasma , 3 ) the elementary interaction between the heavy quarks and light quarks or gluons , 4 ) the interaction of the heavy quarks with the plasma and 5 ) the hadronization of heavy quarks into open charm and open beauty mesons .      for the momentum space distribution as well as for the relative contribution of charm and bottom quarks in pp collisions we use the pqcd results in fixed order + next to leading logarithm ( fonll ) of cacciari et al.@xcite .    for rhic energies",

    "the initial spectra is stiffer @xcite and as well shown in fig.[pts ] .",
    "the heavy quarks are isotropically distributed in azimuthal direction and therefore their @xmath6 is initially zero . any observed anisotropy of heavy mesons is due to the interaction of their constituents with the medium , and can therefore be used to reveal the strength of this interaction .    in the e866 experiment at fermi lab @xcite",

    "this model reproduces a variety of experimental findings .",
    "corresponding to two different equations of state this approach allows to calculate two distinct scenarios of the expansion . either the transition from the qgp to the hadron phase is sudden or the system traverses a mixed phase .",
    "hadronization after the mixed phase reproduces the spectra of light mesons and is therefore favored by experimental data . without a mixed phase also for heavy quarks",
    "the interaction time is too short @xcite in order to reproduce the energy loss and the azimuthal anisotropy seen in the experimental rhic data .",

    "this corona effect can be illustrated alternatively using the correlation between the average initial transverse position and the final transverse momentum displayed in fig .",
    "[ rhic4 ] ( right ) .",
    "there one can see that heavy quarks , passing the hadronization hypersurface with @xmath107 , originate from larger initial transverse distances than the overall glauber average ( @xmath108 ) .",

    "besides a mass dependence of the energy loss in the subdominant u - channel of the @xmath161 , which is @xmath162 , the energy loss is only mass dependent for intermediate @xmath2 ( @xmath163 ) , where @xmath164 in the the case of fixed @xmath165 .",
    "therefore the difference between the two theories can be made evident by comparing the @xmath40 for bottom and charm quarks .",
    "for this purpose one may define @xmath166 @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ rhic8 ] we compared the results of the different theories .",
    "it is evident that already the experiments at rhic energies allow to discard one of the theories if high @xmath2 d and b mesons could be identified .",
    "our model yields quite large values of @xmath167 due to the small value of the ir regulator .",
    "pqcd calculation with a fixed coupling constant @xcite yield smaller values . due to the mild dependence on @xmath168 , mentioned before , @xmath169 as soon as the initial momentum distributions become similar , @xmath170",
    "this is the case for @xmath171 gev / c ( see fig . [ pts ] ) .",
    "going from the known rhic to the unknown lhc energy domain we are facing the problem that it is not known how the properties of the qgp change with increasing energy .",
    "we give therefore our results for a range of charged particle multiplicities , @xmath172 , which have been predicted for lhc .",
    "we assume furthermore that the eccentricity in coordinate space remains the same .",
    "[ lhc1 ] shows the expected @xmath93 as a function of @xmath2 for d- and b- mesons for model e of @xcite which describes best the experimental data at rhic .",
    "this model has a k - factor of 1.8 .",
    "we see that at lhc we will experimentally cover the @xmath2 region in which @xmath93 increases with @xmath2 .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath93 values are still far away from 1 , expected for @xmath173 .",
    "the larger @xmath2 range at lhc will make it possible to discriminate unambiguously between the different energy loss models .",
    "[ lhc2 ] shows @xmath174 for three different theories : ads / cft @xcite , pqcd with radiative energy loss and constant coupling constant @xcite and our collisional energy loss model with a k - factor of 1.8 ( 5 ) for running ( fixed ) @xmath165 . for moderate @xmath2 @xmath175 the spectral form of the c- and b- quarks is different and @xmath174 is far from 1 , despite the fact that the energy loss becomes more and more similar for c- and b- quarks . above @xmath176 an identical spectral form of the quarks and a constant energy loss results in @xmath177 .",
    "pqcd calculation are bound to arrive finally at values of @xmath174 close to one due to the weak mass dependence of the cross section .",
    "the detailed form of @xmath167 depends on the cross sections or , more explicitly , on the form of the coupling constant and of the ir regulator employed in the pqcd cross section calculation .",
    "ads / cft , on the contrary , predicts even for the highest momenta @xmath178 , but it has not been demonstrated yet up to which @xmath2 values the approximations of the approach remain valid .",
    "the azimuthal anisotropy , which has been observed at rhic energies , will remains visible up to lhc energies , as can be inferred from fig .",
    "[ lhc3 ] , where we display @xmath6 for minimum bias events separated for b - quarks ( top left ) , b - mesons ( top right ) , c - quarks ( bottom left ) and d - mesons ( bottom right ) .",
    "`` @xmath179 '' means hadronization at the end of the mixed phase while `` @xmath180 '' means hadronization at the end of the pure qgp phase ; in the latter case , a k - factor of k = 2 - 3 , has to be applied in order to reproduce the experimental @xmath93 values for the most central events . in @xcite",
    "we found that the experimental values at rhic can only be reproduced when the hadronization takes place at the _ end _ of the mixed phase .",
    "as it is the case for the light hadrons at rhic , also the @xmath6 of heavy mesons follows an hydrodynamical behavior until @xmath181 but the absolute value of @xmath6 is only about half of that of light hadrons .",
    "we have described in detail the predictions of the approach which we have advanced recently to describe the energy loss and the azimuthal anisotropy of heavy quarks in the environment produced in heavy ion collisions and have extended our calculation toward lhc energies .",
    "it is based on pqcd calculations with a running coupling constant and an ir regulator derived from hard thermal loop calculations . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , with these new ingredients the energy loss due to elastic collisions is ( up to a factor of about 2 ) sufficient to produce the observed @xmath182 at rhic collisions .",
    "we have presented several observables which allow to test this model . in particular , we predict a large azimuthal anisotropy , even at lhc energies and strong correlations between @xmath93 and the transverse - momentum difference between the simultaneously produced @xmath20 pair .",
    "correlations between simultaneously produced heavy quark pair will allow for triggering on central collisions .",
    "the identification of d- and b- mesons will allow to reveal whether ads / cft describes the passage of heavy quarks through matter or whether we are still in the realm of pqcd .",
