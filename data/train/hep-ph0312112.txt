    "<S> we investigate the polarized parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) and their uncertainties by using the world data on the spin asymmetry @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the uncertainties of the polarized pdfs are estimated by the hessian method . </S>",
    "<S> the up and down valence - quark distributions are determined well </S>",
    "<S> . however , the antiquark distributions have large uncertainties at this stage , and it is particularly difficult to fix the gluon distribution . the @xmath1 analysis produces a positively polarized gluon distribution , but even @xmath2 could be allowed according to our uncertainty estimation . in comparison with the previous aac ( asymmetry analysis collaboration ) parameterization in 2000 , accurate slac - e155 proton data are added to the analysis . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the e155 data improve the determination of the polarized pdfs , especially the polarized antiquark distributions . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the gluon - distribution uncertainties are reduced due to the correlation with the antiquark distributions . </S>",
    "<S> we also show the global analysis results with the condition @xmath2 at the initial scale , @xmath3 gev@xmath4 , for clarifying the error correlation effects with the gluon distribution . </S>"
