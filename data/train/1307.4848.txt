    "entanglement and quantum discord have been widely accepted as two fundamental tools to quantify quantum correlations . in general",
    ", they are quite different from each other . the research on quantum correlation measures was initially based on the entanglement - separability paradigm and entanglement was considered as the unique quantum correlation that can be used to obtain a quantum speed - up .",
    "however , it has been recently shown that there exist quantum computational models such as the deterministic quantum computation with one qubit ( dcq1 ) protocol which contains no entanglement but demonstrates a quantum advantage @xcite . in this sense",
    ", entanglement does not seem to capture all the features of quantum correlations .",
    "therefore , many other measures of quantum correlations have been proposed in recent years .",
    "quantum discord @xcite is a widely accepted one among them .",
    "the quantum discord plays an important role in the research of quantum correlations due to its potential applications in a number of quantum processes , such as quantum critical phenomena @xcite , quantum evolution under decoherence @xcite and , as we just mentioned , the dcq1 protocol @xcite . to quantify the multipartite quantum correlations , generalizations of bipartite quantum discord to multipartite states",

    "@xcite , a measure of multipartite quantum correlations named as global quantum discord ( gqd ) is proposed , which can be seen as a symmetric generalization of bipartite quantum discord to multipartite cases . as a well - defined multipartite quantum correlation ,",
    "the gqd is always non - negative and symmetric with respect to subsystem exchange .",
    "moreover , its applications have been illustrated by the werner - ghz state and in the ashkin - teller model @xcite .",
    "now , the problem of the distribution of gqd throughout a multipartite system arises when we use gqd as a resource for quantum information processing .",
    "then , the monogamy property which characterizes the restriction for sharing a resource or a quantity is helpful to provide significant information for this issue and deserves systematic investigation . in general",
    ", the limits on the shareability of quantum correlations are described by monogamy inequalities @xcite .",
    "although the quantum correlations , such as entanglement and quantum discord , do not always obey the monogamy relations @xcite , the monogamy property can hold for gqd @xcite for a wider situations .",

    "we find that both of them can be used to characterize the quantum phase transitions at zero temperature .",
    "it is worth noting that the sum of all the nearest neighbor bipartite gqds is more suited to be used to describe the quantum phase transition in our model both for zero temperature and non - zero effective temperature case .",
    "this result is superior to the the results obtained in the previous literature @xcite . that is to say , we provide a new and more effective way to characterize the quantum phase transitions in this model .",
    "we believe that our result provide a useful method in understanding the distribution property of gqd in multipartite quantum systems .",
    "the introduced quantities not only play a fundamental role in the quantum information processing , but also can be applied to physical models of many - body quantum systems .",
