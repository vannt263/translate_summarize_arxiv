    "a.  peres wrote in 1984 a highly influential paper on the stability of quantum wave functions under random fluctuations of the hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "he introduced the overlap between the wave ",
    "function propagated by a known hamiltonian with the same wave function propagated by a slightly perturbed one as a measure for stability .",
    "this quantity is nowadays known as fidelity amplitude .",
    "its modulus square is called fidelity or loschmidt echo@xcite .",
    "based on heuristic arguments , numerics and physical intuition , he concluded that a regular fluctuation , i.  e.  a fluctuations obeying the same superselection rules as the original hamiltonian should have less effect on the stability of the quantum state than a chaotic one , i.  e. a perturbation with no additional symmetries .",
    "later the same question was addressed amongst others @xcite using ensemble theory @xcite .",
    "the perturbation as well as the original hamiltonian were chosen from a gaussian random matrix ensemble ( rme ) .",
    "average fidelity amplitude @xmath0 was calculated in second order perturbation theory .",
    "exponentiating the result yielded @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the mean level spacing of the original hamiltonian , @xmath3 is time measured in units of heisenberg time @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the breit ",
    "wigner spreading width of an unperturbed eigenstate@xcite .",
    "the first term is recognised as fermi s golden rule ( fgr ) .",
    "the second term is due to spectral fluctuations , i.  e.  fluctuations in the hamiltonian which do not affect the eigenstates ( called regular fluctuations by peres ) .",
    "the last term is a correction term which accounts for the spectral correlations of the unperturbed system .",
    "the perturbative result ( [ gps ] ) was confirmed experimentally @xcite .",
    "later it was completed and extended by exact calculations for different choices for the unperturbed system and for the perturbation . thereby unexpected features like fidelity revival at heisenberg time @xcite or fidelity freeze @xcite for purely off ",
    "diagonal perturbations were revealed .",
    "fidelity is , at least when averaged over a large number of eigenstates , closely related to the parametric energy correlator , respectively to its fourier transform , the so  called cross form ",
    "factor @xcite .",
    "the latter measure the susceptibility of the _ spectrum _ against fluctuations of the hamiltonian rather than the susceptibility of the wave  function .",
    "a relation between fidelity and these quantities is rather surprising but highly welcome for experimental purposes , since spectral measurements are much easier to perform than measurements of fidelity , which requires in principle knowledge of the entire wave  function .    the above mentioned results",
    "were derived and are valid under the assumption that already the unperturbed system has chaotic dynamics .",
    "but the case originally considered by peres , where a regular system is perturbed by a chaotic admixture , is in quantum information devices more relevant .",
    "there the unperturbed dynamics is usually well controlled .",
    "it has been object of several theoretical and numerical @xcite studies in the recent years .",
    "therefore it comes as a surprise that for this case a detailed ensemble theoretical analysis akin to the ones performed in refs.@xcite is lacking .",
    "the present work aims at filling this gap .",
    "we consider the same situation as peres did : a regular system is perturbed by fully chaotic fluctuations .",
    "we present exact analytic results for the averaged fidelity amplitude and cross form  factor in the corresponding rme .",
    "it turns out that in average both quantities are identical !",
    "what is more the exact result is identical with the one obtained in exponentiated second order perturbation theory ( [ gps ] ) .",
    "the result is compared with the ( known ) results for originally chaotic systems , which are perturbed by random fluctuations , confirming that a regular system is more susceptible to random fluctuations than chaotic ones @xcite .",
    "fidelity amplitude is defined by ( @xmath6 ) @xmath7 here @xmath8 describes the regular system and the fluctuating hamiltonian is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a chaotic admixture .",
    "we average over the spectrum of @xmath8 in an interval which is large enough to contain a large number @xmath11 of ( unperturbed ) levels but small enough such that the mean level spacing @xmath2 is constant .",
    "the strength of the perturbation is of order @xmath2 .",
    "this means that the dimensionless perturbation strength @xmath12 as well as a typical matrix element of @xmath10 are of order one ( see eq .",
    "( [ variance ] ) ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath12 is related to the breit ",
    "wigner spreading width via @xmath13 .    following the work by berry and tabor @xcite in a generic regular system , like for example a rectangular billiard , the energy levels are distributed in an intervall in the same way as independent random numbers .",
    "assuming ergodicity the average over the energy intervall can be replaced by an ensemble average over @xmath11 independent random numbers or likewise over an ensemble of @xmath14 matrices with uncorrelated eigenvalues @xmath15 ( poissonian spectrum ) .    for definiteness",
    "we assume the distribution function @xmath16 of each eigenvalue of @xmath8 to be a gaussian with zero mean and variance @xmath17 . in a region of order @xmath11 around the origin",
    "the eigenvalues are uniformly distributed with mean level spacing @xmath18 @xmath19 up to corrections of order @xmath20 .",
    "this implies a weak form of translation invariance @xmath21 for any @xmath22 , which will be used frequently .",

    "introducing coordinates @xmath142 and @xmath143 and using the weak translation invariance of @xmath144 it is seen that the @xmath129integration does not depend on @xmath145 .",

    "with @xmath151 we find @xmath152 and finally @xmath153 again the result coincides with exponentiated second order perturbation theory . here",
    "it is even more surprising than for the gue since the deceptively simple and compact result is  at least in the way it was calculated here  the outcome of a complicated conspiration of terms .",
    "the gse case is treated like the goe case .",
    "the calculation is simpler since no square root appears in @xmath139 .",
    "the result is @xmath154 .",
    "thus we can write the mean fidelity amplitude in all three cases concisely as in equation ( [ final ] ) .",
    "using supersymmetry we calculated fidelity amplitude and cross form  factor in a random matrix model for a regular system with a chaotic perturbation .",
    "surprisingly both quantities are identical under ensemble average .",
    "the result is a simple exponential of two terms .",
    "one term decays quadratically in time and one term decays linearly .",
    "exponentiated second order perturbation theory is exact , indicating that a more direct proof of our results is likely to exist .",
    "the fact that both quantities are identical can be reconciled with the general differential identity @xcite @xmath155 where only the subspace of the perturbation which is parallel to the original hamiltonian enters . to understand this we split the matrix space of perturbations @xmath156 into a subspace @xmath157 parallel and a subspace @xmath158 perpendicular to the matrix space of the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath159 via @xmath160 @xmath161 , @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "likewise any perturbation can be written as @xmath164 , where the parallel part shares the symmetries of @xmath8 . the model ( [ model ] ) might be generalized to @xmath165 where coupling strengths @xmath166 and @xmath167 might be different .",
    "since a chaotic perturbation breaks any symmetry of the regular system in our case @xmath168 consists in the truncation of @xmath10 to its diagonal part in the eigenbasis of @xmath8 .",
    "it is intuitively clear and has been shown perturbatively @xcite that the diagonal part of the perturbation in the eigenbasis of @xmath8 is responsible for the gaussian decay . on the other hand the linear term ( fgr )",
    "is due to the off - diagonal terms .",
    "this suggests to write our main results ( [ mainres1 ] ) and ( [ final ] ) in the form @xmath169 which obeys the differential relation ( [ gen ] ) .",
    "although we have proven equation ( [ final1 ] ) only for @xmath170 , we conjecture it to hold exactly for arbitrary coupling strength @xmath171 and @xmath167 .",
    "this conjecture is backed by a perturbative calculation akin to that leading to eq .",
