    "magnetic neutron scattering is a powerful technique for studying the magnetic structure and spin dynamics of various material systems .",
    "sometimes obtaining only relative scattering intensities is sufficient .",
    "increasingly it is necessary to convert the magnetic scattering intensities to absolute units , i.e. in terms of magnet moments ( @xmath0 ) or spin ( s ) per site .",
    "the principle of this normalization process has been described previously  @xcite . here",
    "we describe practical details of the normalization process and discuss potential problems .",
    "in addition , closely related yet different physical quantities , such as the dynamic spin correlation function @xmath1 and the imaginary part of the dynamic susceptibility @xmath2 are used to describe magnetic neutron scattering intensities .",
    "it is important to clarify the definition of and conversion between these quantities .",
    "these are the main purposes of this paper .",
    "the neutron scattering intensity measured at the detector can be written as a convolution of the differential scattering cross - section @xmath3 , which depends on the sample itself , and the instrument resolution function @xmath4 , which is mainly determined by parameters related to the instrument set - up  @xcite : @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the wave - vector and energy transfer . in practice",
    ", it is customary to divide the detector counts by the monitor counts , the latter being inversely proportional to the incident neutron wave - vector @xmath8 .",
    "therefore the modified neutron scattering intensity becomes : @xmath9 this is typically the case for measurements done on triple - axis spectrometers  @xcite ( tas ) . for measurements done on time - of - flight spectrometers where @xmath8-independent monitors are sometimes used ,",
    "there are usually data reduction options for users to choose , so that the end data are presented in a format where @xmath8 and @xmath10 are properly taken care of .",
    "this subtle difference will be discussed again when we describe the resolution volume determination in details below .",
    "here we only discuss the case of scattering with unpolarized neutrons . for coherent magnetic scattering from a system with a single species of magnetic atom  @xcite , @xmath11 the parameters used in eq .",
    "[ eqn:3 ] are explained below :    @xmath12 is the total number of unit cells , @xmath13 , and @xmath14  cm , @xmath15 is the magnetic form factor . @xmath10 and @xmath8 are final and incident neutron wave - vectors .",
    "@xmath16 is the debye - waller factor . @xmath17",
    "denote the cartesian coordinates @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , and @xmath20 are the projections of the unit wave - vector @xmath21 on the cartesian axes .",
    "@xmath22 is the dynamic spin correlation function , which is typically what one would eventually want to determine .",
    "@xmath23 satisfies a simple sum rule when integrated over a brillouin zone : @xmath24 it is also related to the imaginary part of the dynamic susceptibility @xmath25 via the fluctuation - dissipation theorem  @xcite : @xmath26 note that the prefactors we have included in this definition are necessary in order that @xmath27 is consistent with the bulk susceptibility , as we will show later .",
    "we then make a necessary approximation to `` decouple '' the instrument resolution and the scattering response function .",
    "@xmath28 where @xmath29 is the resolution volume , which should only be instrument dependent , and will later be referred to as @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath31 is the modified dynamic spin correlation function , taking into account that our scattering measurements are only sensitive to spin ( fluctuations ) along directions perpendicular to the wave - vector transfers . in the common case of isotropic spin excitations , as in a paramagnetic phase , @xmath32 ,",
    "thus @xmath33 the approximation in eq .",
    "[ eqn:5 ] is acceptable if @xmath34 is relatively smooth in the region of interest .",
    "when the real @xmath34 has sharp features relative to the resolution volume , usually the accurate non - distorted @xmath34 will only be obtainable through a deconvolution process , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "nevertheless , this approximation is always valid if one is interested in the total spectral weight , i.e. @xmath6 and energy integral of @xmath1 .    after putting all the numbers together",
    ", one can ultimately write down : @xmath35 where @xmath36  barn @xmath37@xmath38 is the unit for neutron scattering cross - section .",
    "we will see in later discussions that the denominator has the units of energy divided by cross - section ( typically barn@xmath39mev or barn@xmath39ev ) , thus @xmath40 here has a unit of mev@xmath41 or ev@xmath41 .",
    "alternatively , if one wants to express the results as squared magnetic moment per site , in units of @xmath42mev@xmath41 or @xmath42ev@xmath41 , the appropriate formula is @xmath43 which only differs by a factor of @xmath44 compared to @xmath34 .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that in many literature people use expressions such as @xmath45 , or simply @xmath1 when plotting magnetic neutron scattering results . in most cases ,",
    "unless explicitly noted , they actually correspond to either @xmath34 or @xmath46 that we discussed above",
    ".    sometimes it may be preferable to write the magnetic neutron scattering results in a form directly related to bulk susceptibility measurements .",
    "for such a purpose , the imaginary part of the dynamic susceptibility @xmath47 is often used , which can be converted from @xmath23 using eq .",
    "[ eqn:4 ] .",
    "this quantity is related to the bulk susceptibility through the kramers - kronig transformation : @xmath48 for the typical case of paramagnetic scattering from non - interacting spins , the bulk susceptibility @xmath49 using eq .",
    "[ eqn : sqw ] one can verify that the definition of @xmath50 in eq  [ eqn:4 ] satisfies eq .",
    "[ eqn : bulk ] . using eqs .",
    "[ eqn : iso ] , [ eqn:4 ] and [ eqn:6 ] , we have : @xmath51 in the case of anisotropic spin excitations , to avoid confusion it would make more sense to use the different components of @xmath52 explicitly rather than the general form @xmath2 .    the land-@xmath53 factor , the magnetic form factor @xmath15 , and the debye - waller factor @xmath16 are sample dependent and can be estimated .",
    "for example @xmath54 , @xmath55 for small @xmath6 where @xmath15 is large . and",
    "the magnetic form factor @xmath15 can be looked up in tables  @xcite .",
    "therefore , in order to determine the absolute magnitude of @xmath34 from the measured intensity @xmath56 , one needs to know the resolution volume @xmath30 . in general , to obtain the resolution volume one could use the following references : ( i ) nuclear bragg peaks ; ( ii ) sample incoherent elastic scattering ; ( iii ) standard sample ( e.g. vanadium ) incoherent elastic scattering , and ( iv ) sample phonon scattering . for single crystal samples , extinction in bragg scattering can often significantly affect the absolute bragg intensities , and a good understanding of the instrument resolution is required , so ( i ) is less commonly used nowadays . in this report , we will discuss some examples in our neutron scattering experiments where the magnetic scattering is normalized using ( ii ) or ( iv ) , providing formulas that one will be able to easily adapt to other measurements .",
    "we also briefly discuss the case ( iii ) .",
    "the experiments we discuss here include measurements on two different material systems .",
    "the first system is a fe - based superconductor fete@xmath57se@xmath58 , the so - called `` 11 '' compound .",
    "measurements on the `` 11 '' single crystal samples discussed here were all performed on the bt7 and spins triple - axis - spectrometers at the nist center for neutron research ( ncnr ) ( see ref .   for more details ) .",
    "we used horizontal beam collimations of guide - open - s-@xmath59-@xmath60 ( s represents `` sample '' ) for the inelastic scattering measurements on spins with fixed final energy of 5 mev and a cooled be filter after the sample to reduce higher - order neutrons . at bt7",
    ", we used beam collimations of open-@xmath61-s-@xmath61-@xmath60 with fixed final energy of 14.7 mev and two pyrolytic graphite filters after the sample .",
    "the second system is the multiferroic bifeo@xmath62 .",
    "neutron inelastic scattering experiments on the bifeo@xmath62 single crystal were performed on the arcs time - of - flight spectrometer at the spallation neutron source ( sns ) at oak ridge national laboratory ( see ref .  ) .",
    "the data discussed here are those using a 40  mev neutron incident energy .",
    "all the data are described in reciprocal lattice units ( r.l.u . ) of @xmath63 .",
    "this is one of the most straight - forward methods in doing absolute calibration . since the cross - section for incoherent elastic scattering is quite simple : @xmath64 the summation is performed over all atoms in the unit cell , where @xmath65 is the incoherent neutron scattering cross - section of the @xmath66th atom .",
    "based on eq .",
    "[ eqn:2 ] , the energy integrated incoherent elastic scattering intensity @xmath67 can be obtained by doing an energy scan through @xmath68 at a wave - vector transfer @xmath6 far away from any magnetic / nuclear bragg peaks . for elastic scattering , @xmath8=@xmath10 , therefore we have @xmath69    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab:2 ]    the resolution volume @xmath70 from the three phonon profiles shown in table  [ tab:2 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] are consistent within expected error bars . after obtaining @xmath71",
    ", we can use eqs .",
    "[ eqn:6 ] and [ eqn:6a ] to normalize magnetic scattering intensities  @xcite .",
    "assuming @xmath72 , we were able to calculate the integrated spectral weight and a spin per site of @xmath73 per fe , which is in good agreement with the theoretical expectation of @xmath74 for fe@xmath75 .",
    "the advantage of using phonon scattering for normalization is that by avoiding the use of elastic scattering , there is less background contribution in the normalization process .",
    "nevertheless , other factors such as phonon aharmonicity , variation of the debye - waller factor and uncertainties in the structure factor @xmath76 can still lead to systematic errors .",
    "it is reasonable to expect a systematic error in the range of @xmath77 in these normalization processes .",
    "in this paper , we have discussed various methods for performing absolute normalization of magnetic inelastic neutron scattering data .",
    "the resolution volume can be obtained using eqs .",
    "[ eqn:9 ] , [ eqn : phonon3 ] , or [ eqn : phonon4 ] , depending on the reference chosen for the normalization .",
    "data - sets from previous experiments are given as examples for the normalization process .",
    "the modified dynamic spin correlation function @xmath34 , or the imaginary part of the dynamic susceptibility @xmath2 , have been clearly defined in the paper ; and these quantities can then be obtained using eq .",
    "[ eqn:6 ] , [ eqn:6a ] , or [ eqn:6c ] .",
    "the formulas described here are for general purposes and independent of instrument configurations .",
