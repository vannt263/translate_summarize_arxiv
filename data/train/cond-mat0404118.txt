    "the observed breakdown of landau s fermi - liquid paradigm in a number of metallic systems has led to an explosion of effort to understand this _ non - fermi liquid _ ( nfl ) behaviour  @xcite . the nfl breakdown is usually identified by deviations of low - temperature thermodynamic and transport properties [ specific heat  @xmath1 , magnetic susceptibility  @xmath2 , electrical resistivity  @xmath3 from the predictions of landau fermi - liquid theory [ @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "such deviations been observed in many f - electron heavy - fermion metals and alloys  @xcite , and often ( but not always ) take specific forms : the specific heat sommerfeld coefficient @xmath7 diverges logarithmically as @xmath8 ; @xmath2 varies as @xmath9 or @xmath10 or @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) ; and @xmath13 varies as @xmath14 , @xmath15 .    by definition",
    "no phase transition occurs at a nonzero temperature in an ideal nfl system .",
    "nevertheless , in most nfl systems a magnetic phase is nearby in the appropriate phase diagram ; the transition temperature  @xmath16 is reduced by varying an experimental parameter  @xmath17 ( pressure , composition , magnetic field ,  ) , and nfl behaviour is observed in the neighborhood of the critical parameter value  @xmath18 for which @xmath19 is just suppressed to zero .",
    "this is a _ quantum critical point _ ( qcp )",
    "@xcite , which separates magnetically ordered and paramagnetic phases at zero temperature .",
    "most theoretical effort in this area has concentrated on effects of the qcp .",
    "magnetic resonance and other measurements have shown , however , that _ structural disorder _ is an important component of the nfl phenomenon in many systems .",
    "nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) and transverse - field muon spin rotation ( tf-@xmath0sr , i.e. , magnetic field applied transverse to the muon spin ) measurements in ucu@xmath20pd and ucu@xmath21pd@xmath22  @xcite demonstrated that the magnetic susceptibility in these nfl materials is strongly inhomogeneous . following",
    "this discovery two broad classes of theories began to address the role of disorder in nfl behaviour .",
    "in the ` kondo - disorder ' approach  @xcite structural disorder gives rise to a broad distribution of kondo temperatures  @xmath23 .",
    "nfl behaviour arises from low-@xmath23 spins that are not in the fermi - liquid state . in the ` griffiths - mccoy singularity '",
    "picture  @xcite spin - spin interactions freeze low-@xmath23 f moments into clusters with a wide distribution of sizes ; the larger clusters dominate the susceptibility and lead to divergent behaviour as the temperature is lowered . both kondo - disorder and",
    "griffiths - mccoy singularity scenarios seem to be compatible with observed nmr and tf-@xmath0sr linewidths  @xcite .",
    "longitudinal - field muon spin relaxation ( lf-@xmath0sr ) experiments in nfl ucu@xmath24pd@xmath25 , @xmath26 and 1.5  @xcite , and ceptsi@xmath27ge@xmath25 , @xmath28 and 0.1  @xcite , indicate , however , that the f - ion spin dynamics in these alloys are better described by a picture in which critical slowing down occurs cooperatively throughout the sample , rather than at ( rare ) low-@xmath23 spins or large clusters .",
    "the muon spin relaxation rates are nevertheless widely distributed , and the dynamic behaviour closely resembles that of spin glasses  @xcite . thus an important question is whether disorder in the interactions dominates the dynamics , as in a spin glass above the glass temperature , or if , instead , the critical slowing down is still controlled by a qcp .",
    "theoretical treatments exist  @xcite that combine elements of both these viewpoints , and describe a ` quantum spin glass ' with a suppressed or vanishing glass temperature .    in the meantime nfl systems have been discovered in which disorder does not appear to play an essential role . at ambient pressure",
    "these include cecu@xmath29au@xmath30  @xcite , ce(ru@xmath27rh@xmath31)@xmath32si@xmath32 , @xmath33  @xcite , ceni@xmath32ge@xmath32  @xcite , and ybrh@xmath32si@xmath32  @xcite .",
    "thus one can compare spin dynamics in ` disordered ' and ` ordered ' materials .",
    "the result of this comparison is evidence that the rapid muon spin relaxation in the disordered systems is due to slow dynamics associated with quantum spin - glass behaviour , rather than ( homogeneous ) quantum criticality .",
    "this evidence consists of    * the observation of a wide inhomogeneous distribution of relaxation rates characteristic of disordered systems when the relaxation is strong , * the fact that in the ordered nfl compounds  ceni@xmath32ge@xmath32 and ybrh@xmath32si@xmath32 , and even in the doped alloys  cecu@xmath29au@xmath30 and ce(ru@xmath34rh@xmath34)@xmath32si@xmath32 , the low - frequency weight of the spin fluctuation spectrum is more than an order of magnitude smaller than in the disordered nfl systems , and * remarkably good correlation of the muon spin relaxation rate and its inhomogeneity with the residual resistivity of nfl systems .",

    "candidate disorder - driven nfl mechanisms are discussed in , which describes the way in which tf-@xmath0sr ( and nmr ) linewidths probe the spatial inhomogeneity of the magnetic susceptibility that is the principal signature of disorder - driven nfl behaviour . as an example , tf-@xmath0sr evidence for a disorder - driven nfl mechanism in the nfl compound  ucu@xmath20pd is described in .",

    "it can in principle appear near any critical point , but is usually associated with spin - glass - like behaviour . in nfl materials",
    "such glassy spin dynamics may arise from the effect of disorder on quantum critical fluctuations . in muon",
    "spin relaxation results are compared with the residual electrical resistivity ( a measure of disorder in the electronic system ) and the low - temperature sommerfeld coefficient ( a measure of the characteristic electronic energy scale ) , and found to correlate well with the former but not the latter .",
    "these results establish strong links between quantum criticality , slow fluctuations , and electronic disorder in nfl materials  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0sr experiments and questions they raise raised are summarized in .",
    "as described briefly in the introduction , nmr and tf-@xmath0sr experiments  @xcite have revealed anomalously large and strongly temperature - dependent resonance linewidths in a number of nfl materials .",
    "it was realized  @xcite that this behaviour is characteristic of a spatially inhomogeneous distribution of local f - electron susceptibilities .",
    "this in turn suggests that a characteristic excitation energy  @xmath39 associated with the f electrons , which enters the zero - temperature susceptibility via the relation  @xmath40 , is inhomogeneously distributed due to structural disorder .",
    "in the single - ion ` kondo - disorder ' picture  @xcite this energy is the kondo temperature  @xmath23 , which is broadly distributed because of its extreme sensitivity to f - electron  conduction - electron hybridization . if the distribution function  @xmath41 is broad enough so that @xmath42 , as shown in ,    then at any nonzero temperature  @xmath43 the f ions with @xmath44 are not kondo compensated and are the source of nfl behaviour in the kondo - disorder model .",
    "bulk thermodynamic and transport properties are averages over @xmath41 of the usual kondo expressions for these quantities",
    ". it can be shown  @xcite that @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .",
    "a simple heuristic calculation may clarify how the inhomogeneous spread @xmath47 in @xmath48 might be expected to behave in a kondo - disorder model . assume a spread  @xmath49 in kondo temperatures  @xmath23 . assume further that the curie - weiss expression @xmath50 captures the essence of the local kondo physics",
    ". then @xmath47 is given by @xmath51 for small @xmath49 .",
    "thus @xmath52 should be roughly proportional to @xmath48 , with temperature an implicit parameter , reflecting the increasing effect of the distribution in @xmath23 in equation as the temperature is lowered .",
    "we do not expect this picture to be very accurate , as it assumes a small spread in @xmath23 and a simplified curie - weiss susceptibility , but a strong increase in @xmath52 at large @xmath48 ( low temperatures ) is evidence for the basic effect .",
    "the griffiths - mccoy singularity model  @xcite also invokes a broad distribution of @xmath23 , but assumes that uncompensated f - ion spins interact via rkky coupling and form clusters .",
    "these clusters then tunnel between orientational configurations via kondo spin - flip processes , and the distributed energy  @xmath39 characterizes these tunneling processes .",
    "the model exhibits griffiths - mccoy singularities associated with a qcp below percolation threshold .",
    "the thermodynamic properties diverge as @xmath8 in a manner described by a nonuniversal exponent  @xmath53 .",
    "predictions for the specific heat  @xmath1 , the magnetic susceptibility  @xmath2 , and the fractional rms width  @xmath54 of the inhomogeneous susceptibility distribution are given by @xmath55 @xmath56 thermodynamic properties have been shown to be in good agreement with this theory for a number of nfl alloy systems  @xcite .    for both the kondo - disorder and griffiths - mccoy singularity models fits to the bulk susceptibility determine the distribution function  @xmath57 , from which @xmath54 can be calculated .",
    "this can then be compared with nmr or tf-@xmath0sr linewidth data with no further adjustable parameters  @xcite as described below ; good agreement in a given nfl material can be taken as evidence for applicability of a disorder - driven mechanism of this kind .",
    "this procedure often works equally well for both the kondo - disorder and griffiths - mccoy singularity scenarios  @xcite , so that other experiments are necessary to distinguish between them .",
    "we briefly review the relation between the static resonance linewidth and the spread in local susceptibility .",
    "more complete descriptions are given in references  @xcite and  @xcite .    in a paramagnet in an applied magnetic field",
    "@xmath58 the time - average or static local field  @xmath59 at the site of a _ spin probe _ ( muon or nucleus ) is shifted by an amount  @xmath60 due to the hyperfine coupling ( direct or transferred ) between the spin probe and the surrounding electronic spin polarization .",
    "the relative shift  @xmath61 of the @xmath62 spin probe is given by @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the susceptibility of the @xmath65 f ion and @xmath66 is the transferred hyperfine coupling constant between spin probe  @xmath67 and ion  @xmath68 .",
    "a spatially inhomogeneous distribution of the @xmath64 gives rise to a corresponding distribution of the @xmath69 , and hence broadens the resonance line .    from equation the relation between the rms width  @xmath47 of the susceptibility distribution and the rms width  @xmath70 of the shift distribution",
    "can be shown to be @xmath71 where @xmath72 is an effective hyperfine coupling constant that depends on the spatial correlation of the disordered susceptibility and can be calculated from the @xmath66  @xcite .",
    "thus the spread in shifts is a direct measure of the spread in @xmath48 , a quantity that is very hard to obtain from other experiments .",
    "determination of @xmath72 in general requires knowledge of the spatial correlation function that describes disorder in the inhomogeneous susceptibility ; this correlation function can be determined from spin - probe spectra only if data are available for more than one spin probe  @xcite .",
    "the calculation simplifies in the extreme limits of long - range correlation ( lrc ) ( correlation length @xmath73 range of the hyperfine coupling ) and short - range correlation ( src ) ( correlation length @xmath74 nearest - neighbor f - ion distance ) .",
    "it is found that @xmath75 thus one can find @xmath47 from @xmath70 .",
    "furthermore , the quantity  @xmath76 is an estimator of the fractional spread in susceptibility  @xmath52 .",
    "a convenient way to compare the data to these model results is to plot @xmath77 [ cf",
    ".  equation ] and the theoretical @xmath54 ( cf .  ) versus @xmath2 , with temperature an implicit parameter  @xcite .",
    "an example of such a comparison is given below for the nfl compound ucu@xmath20pd .",
    "heavy - fermion materials in the series  ucu@xmath24pd@xmath25 , @xmath78 , exhibit nfl behaviour  @xcite .",
    "these alloys crystallize in the fcc aube@xmath79 structure ( space group @xmath80 ) . the end compound  ucu@xmath79 possesses two crystallographically inequivalent copper sites in the ratio @xmath81 at the @xmath82 and @xmath83 positions ( wyckoff notation ) , which are filled by pd ions in the alloys .",
    "therefore stoichiometric ucu@xmath20pd could crystallize in an ordered structure , with only @xmath83 sites occupied by pd ions , in which case disorder might not play a role in the nfl behaviour of this compound .",
    "chau  @xcite reported elastic neutron diffraction measurements on members of the ucu@xmath24pd@xmath25 series , and found no evidence for pd / cu disorder for @xmath84 .",

    "tf-@xmath0sr linewidths have been measured in a number of samples of ucu@xmath20pd  @xcite , including a previously - studied powder sample  @xcite ( powder  # 1 ) , the powder sample used for the neutron diffraction experiments ( powder  # 2 ) , and a bulk polycrystal consisting of a few single crystals .",

    "( a combination of tf-@xmath0sr and nmr results has shown that the src limit is appropriate to this system  @xcite . )",

    "( the dropoff for @xmath87  emu / mole ( i.e. , for @xmath88  k ) is not well understood but could be due to thermally - activated muon diffusion , which would motionally average the tf-@xmath0sr line and reduce its width . ) the samples were all prepared differently and are likely to have a range of defect concentrations , in which case the susceptibility inhomogeneity is remarkably insensitive to the amount of structural disorder .",
    "we note that the low - temperature values of @xmath77 in ucu@xmath20pd and ucu@xmath21pd@xmath22 ( which is definitely a disordered alloy ) are also very similar  @xcite .",
    "shown for comparison in is @xmath52 from the kondo - disorder model  @xcite .",

    "but in lf-@xmath0sr experiments it is the muon spin relaxation function  @xmath96 , not @xmath127 , that is spatially averaged . as discussed in , the observed time - field scaling of the spatially - averaged muon spin relaxation function  @xmath35 shows that the _ local _ @xmath127 , not just the spatial average @xmath218 , scales as @xmath219 .",
    "local frequency scaling is not a property of the griffiths - mccoy singularity model , in which the scaling is found only after the average has been taken , and only for a sharply resonant ( and nonscaling ) form [ equation ] of the local @xmath220",

    "thus the griffiths - mccoy singularity theory does not seem to account for the @xmath0sr results for a number of reasons .",
    "more generally , disorder - driven pictures that ascribes nfl behaviour to ` rare ' objects ( low-@xmath23 spins or large clusters ) lead to spatial distributions of spin fluctuation rates ( slow for the rare objects ) , and thus are not in agreement with time - field scaling .",
    "we conclude that local disorder - driven models account for inhomogeneous distributions of static susceptibility in disordered nfl materials ( ) , but that the distributed local dynamics in these models do not describe the observed muon spin relaxation .",

    "the question of local vs.  cooperative dynamics seems to be answered in favor of the latter as discussed above , at least for the ucu@xmath24pd@xmath25 system which has been studied most intensively .",

    "is there even a distinction in principle between these notions ? *",
    "the correlation shown in ( @xmath205 ) strongly suggests that glassy dynamics depend ` universally ' on residual resistivity .",
    "what does this mean physically ?",
    "is there a picture in which disorder - driven slowing down of fluctuations in a metal depends only on the electronic mean free path ? in this regard the increase of impurity scattering near a qcp predicted by varma , miyake , and co - workers  @xcite may be relevant if there is a slowing effect of this scattering on spin lifetime in the system near criticality . *",
    "more generally , how are the fluctuations slowed down ?",
    "is _ frustration _ involved , in the sense that it is involved in slow spin fluctuations in spin glasses and geometrically frustrated systems ?",
    "* is there a mixing of ( quantum ) critical and griffiths - mccoy singular behaviour ?",
    "do we need to invoke aspects of both phenomena  @xcite ?",
    "the static and dynamic response of spins in f - electron nfl materials exhibits very strong effects of disorder , revealing poorly - understood instabilities of quantum criticality in these systems to strong inhomogeneity and glassy behaviour .",
