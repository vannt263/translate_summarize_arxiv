    "einstein s general relativity ( gr ) has changed our understanding of gravitation and spacetime for almost one hundred years .",
    "the success of gr bases on its theoretical beauty and deep insights  @xcite , as well as its remarkable accuracy in explaining and predicting experimental phenomena  @xcite .",
    "the three classical tests proposed by einstein  @xcite , namely , i ) the perihelion precession of mercury s orbit , ii ) the deflection of light by the sun , iii ) the gravitational redshift of light , established gr as the most promising alternative for newton s gravity theory . later in 1960s , tests of the shapiro delay with the transmission of radar pulses  @xcite , and astronomical discoveries of quasars  @xcite , pulsars  @xcite , and cosmic microwave background ( cmb )  @xcite , reinforced gr s empirical foundation and significance in various regimes .",
    "subsequently , the systematic , worldwide efforts after 1960s in tests of gravity have verified gr to high precision  @xcite .    today , more aspects of gravitation are being explored .",
    "for instance , the gravity probe b ( gpb ) have determined the geodetic and frame dragging effects in gr to 0.3% and 19% respectively , by means of cryogenic gyroscopes in earth orbit  @xcite . in a second example , with the technique of timing with giant radio telescopes , the double pulsar has verified gr to 0.05% , and gr passed five tests simultaneously in _",
    "one _ system  @xcite . needless to say",
    ", we are going to witness the discovery of gravitational waves ( gws ) very soon with the global efforts from the gw communities . with the new developments of",
    "ground - based and space - based laser interferometric gw observatories  @xcite and pulsar timing arrays ( ptas )  @xcite , a new era of multi - wavelength , multi - message gw astronomy will soon open novel possibilities to test the foundations of gr , especially to deeply test its strong - field dynamics associated with neutron stars ( nss ) and black holes ( bhs )  @xcite .",
    "why are we continuously testing gr ?",
    "first of all , gravity is one of the most important forces in the nature whose sophisticated foundations call for persistent examinations to exquisite precision .",
    "secondly , puzzles associated with gravity still exist both theoretically and observationally . from the theoretical viewpoint",
    ", gr fails to make firm physical predictions at the singularities of bhs , which may need an incorporation of quantum fluctuations to evade infinities . in a broader concept ,",
    "there exist fundamental difficulties in combining gr with quantum principles and quantum field theories of particle physics into a single unified theory , namely quantum gravity , due to the issues associated with nonrenormalizability .",
    "observationally , the phenomena of dark matter and dark energy could be alluring signals suggesting the breakdown of gr at galactic and cosmic scales .",
    "several modified alternative gravity theories beyond gr were proposed to explain these new phenomena as gravitational manifestations , whose predictions need to be verified or falsified with further experiments  @xcite .",
    "thirdly , with persistent tests , high confidence in gr accumulated from observational facts will reinforce our faith in applying gr under different circumstances , like to the theories of the global positioning system  @xcite and the bh accretion disks  @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we consider the possibility of local lorentz invariance ( lli ) violation in the gravity sector .",
    "such a scenario arises numerous interests recently in the gravity community , for examples , in the theories of hoava - lifshitz gravity  @xcite and einstein - ther gravity  @xcite . in the generic pure - gravity sector of the standard - model extension ( sme ) in presence of a preferred frame ( pf )",
    ", we derive a new limit on the time - time component of the @xmath3 matrix in the standard coordinate frame .",
    "this component hardly plays an role in gravity experiments hence it is difficult to be constrained  @xcite .",
    "only until recently , bailey _",
    "_ obtained the first empirical limit of @xmath4 ( 68% cl ) from the gpb experiment  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 coefficient has no effect at leading order on the orbital dynamics of binary pulsars if we ignore the relative velocity of the binary to the pf  @xcite . following the suggestion in ref .",
    "@xcite , we utilize the boost of the pulsar system with respect to the pf to mix @xmath0 with other time - spatial and spatial - spatial components of @xmath3 through a lorentz transformation .",
    "because binary orbital dynamics is sensitive to the latter , such a mixture makes a new constraint of @xmath0 possible .",
    "we use the state - of - the - art double - line observations of neutron star ",
    "white dwarf ( ns - wd ) binaries with optical spectroscopy of the former and radio timing of the latter , and obtain the most stringent limit of @xmath0 up to now .",
    "our result , @xmath5 ( 95% cl ) , surpasses the previous limit obtained from gpb by a factor of 500 , and further confirms the validity of gr in its precision in describing gravitation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "the gravity sector of sme and its observable effects on the orbital dynamics of binary pulsars are reviewed .",
    "then the full coordinate transformation between the solar system and the binary is elaborated in section  [ sec : coordinate ] that is afterwards utilized to mix different components of @xmath3 . principles in choosing suitable binary pulsars for the test",
    "are stated in section  [ sec : psr ] , and numerical simulations of our three ns - wd binary systems , namely psrs  j1738 + 0333 , j1012 + 5307 , and j0348 + 0432 , are presented in section  [ sec : sim ] .",
    "discussions on different pfs and strong - field effects associated with nss are presented in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "section  [ sec : summary ] briefly summarizes the work .",
    "the light speed @xmath6 is adopted throughout the paper .",
    "the concept of lorentz symmetry violation is largely motivated by the hope to probe possible `` relic effects '' at low energy scales from the new physics of quantum gravity , as well as by the needs to perform the strictest tests on the most cherished fundamental principles  @xcite . with the fact that gr and the standard model of particle physics have passed all exquisite empirical examinations up to now  @xcite",
    ", one would expect that only tiny lorentz violations are allowed at current experimental energy scales .",
    "therefore , an effective field theory that catalogues all possible angles to deviate from an exact lorentz symmetry is very helpful in systematically conducting theoretical and experimental studies .",
    "sme is the effort along this direction by extending our currently well adopted field theories with lorentz - violating terms .",
    "it initially focused on the matter sector  @xcite , and lately is extended to include the gravity sector  @xcite , as well as the couplings between the matter sector and the gravity sector  @xcite .    in sme , a general lagrangian in riemann - cartan spacetime has the structure @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are lorentz - invariant and lorentz - violating terms respectively  @xcite .",
    "we here focus o the limit of riemannian spacetime and the pure - gravity sector with lorentz - violating operators of only mass dimension four or less ( dubbed as the minimal sme , or msme ) . with above restrictions , we have  @xcite , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the determinant of the metric",
    ", @xmath12 is the ricci scalar , @xmath13 is the trace - free ricci tensor , @xmath14 is the weyl conformal tensor , and @xmath15 is the cosmological constant that is set to zero for localized systems .",
    "the extra fields , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , are dynamical fields that gain vacuum expectation values , @xmath19 , @xmath3 , and @xmath20 , through the spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism  @xcite , which is similar to the higgs mechanism in the standard model of particle physics with a vacuum - condensed scalar field  @xcite . in the riemannian spacetime with post - newtonian approximations ,",
    "consistent treatments were carried out for the fluctuations around these vacuum expectation values , including the massless nambu - goldstone modes  @xcite .",
    "the fossilized field @xmath19 can be absorbed into redefinitions of the gravitational constant and other fields  @xcite .",
    "we will assume that proper rescalings are already done hereafter .",
    "the tensor fields , @xmath3 and @xmath20 , inherit the symmetries of @xmath21 and @xmath14 respectively .",
    "it was found that @xmath20 has no effects on physical experiments at leading order under the simplifying yet reasonable assumptions made by bailey and kosteleck ' y  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we will focus on observational effects from the rescaled vacuum expectation values of @xmath3 on the orbital dynamics of binary pulsars .",
    "the @xmath3 field is traceless and symmetric , consequently , in total nine physical degrees of freedom are encoded therein .",
    "is comoving with the pulsar system , with @xmath22 pointing along the line of sight to the pulsar from the earth , while @xmath23 constitutes the sky plane with @xmath24 to east and @xmath25 to north .",

    "the frames , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , are related through rotation matrices , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34.[fig : geometry],width=340 ]    in newtonian gravity , a bound orbit of a binary is a keplerian ellipse . for a binary pulsar ,",
    "the shape of the pulsar orbit is specified by the semimajor axis , @xmath35 , and the eccentricity , @xmath36 .",
    "the orientation of the orbit with respect to observers is described by three euler angles , namely the orbital inclination angle , @xmath37 , the longitude of periastron , @xmath38 , and the longitude of ascending node , @xmath39 ( see figure  [ fig : geometry ] for a graphical illustration ) .",
    "kepler s third law relates the orbital size with the orbital period , @xmath40 , through @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the total mass of the system ( here we identify @xmath43 as the pulsar mass and @xmath44 as the companion mass ) .",
    "is defined as the semimajor axis of the _ pulsar _ orbit , it should be replaced by @xmath45 to achieve an equality in eq .",
    "( [ eq : kepler3 ] ) . ]",
    "we further define the orbital frequency , @xmath46 , the projected semimajor axis of the pulsar orbit , @xmath47 , and the `` characteristic '' orbital velocity , @xmath48 for later notation simplification .    in presence of lorentz - violating fossil fields ,",
    "the orbital dynamics of a binary pulsar is modified  @xcite . by using the technique of osculating elements , bailey and kosteleck '",
    "y obtained the secular changes for orbital elements after averaging over one orbital period  @xcite , @xmath49 where we have defined , @xmath50 the @xmath3 fields in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : edot][eq : xdot ] ) are defined in the frame that is comoving with the center of the binary pulsar .",
    "the components of @xmath3 are projected onto the spatial coordinate frame @xmath51 that is attached with the orbit ( see figure  [ fig : geometry ] ) .",
    "the transformation between the pulsar frame and the canonical sun - centered celestial - equatorial frame is discussed in section  [ sec : coordinate ] .",
    "we will deal with small - eccentricity ns - wd binaries , where in most cases , the orbits are almost perfectly circular due to mutual tide forces , frictional dissipation , and exchange of materials during the evolutionary history  @xcite .",
    "therefore , instead of @xmath36 and @xmath38 , two laplace - lagrange parameters , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , are widely used in practice in order to break the notorious parameter degeneracies  @xcite . in the limit of @xmath54 ,",
    "it is easy to obtain  @xcite , @xmath55 and @xmath56 these formulae will be used in section  [ sec : result ] to construct corresponding tests of gravity .",
    "in sme , in order to be compatible with the riemann - cartan spacetime , the lorentz symmetry breaking is spontaneous with underlying dynamical fluctuations  @xcite . with this mechanism ,",
    "the tensorial background , @xmath3 , is _",
    "lorentz - invariant , while _ particle _ lorentz - violating .",
    "therefore , to experimentally probe the magnitudes of @xmath3 components , an explicit observer coordinate system should be specified .",
    "we adopt the standard sun - centered celestial - equatorial frame , @xmath57 , in the experimental studies of sme  @xcite . in the context of post - newtonian gravity",
    ", it is chosen as an asymptotically inertial frame that is comoving with the rest frame of the solar system and that coincides with the canonical sun - centered frame .",
    "the @xmath58 axis is pointing from the earth to the sun at vernal equinox of j2000.0 epoch , and the @xmath59 axis is along the rotating axis of the earth , and @xmath60 completes a right - handed coordinate system .    for the purpose of this paper , we will assume the existence of a pf for simplicity .",
    "the pf can be singled out by the global cosmological evolution or the universal matter distribution  @xcite .",
    "we will keep the choice of pf general .",
    "however , the isotropic cmb frame , which is the most natural choice from the cosmic viewpoint , is kept in mind as a benchmark .",
    "this simplification , compared with the most generic case of possible anisotropy in all frames  @xcite , is discussed in section  [ sec : discussion ] .    in the pf , by virtue of rotational invariance",
    ", the @xmath17 tensor takes a simple isotropic form  @xcite , @xmath61 here for numerical reasons , we have denoted @xmath62 to be the @xmath63 component in the pf .",
    "although the @xmath63 component of @xmath3 will in general change under a coordinate transformation , the value of @xmath62 , which specified in the pf , is fixed .",

(",

    ", one can clearly see a mixture between the @xmath63 component and the @xmath69 and @xmath70 components ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "although the systematic velocity of a binary pulsar is small ( typically , @xmath72 ) , precision experiments with pulsars can still put a meaningful constraint on the @xmath63 component with careful studies  @xcite .",

    "this statement does not necessarily mean that the limit from binary pulsars is `` weak '' , on the contrary , in most cases the limits from strongly self - gravitating bodies are _ much _ stronger than the corresponding limits from weakly gravitating bodies .",

    "in other words , they become system dependent .",
    "if such phenomenon also happens here , we will expect different values of @xmath0 for psrs  j1738 + 0333 , j1012 + 5307 , and j0348 + 0432 .",
    "nonetheless , if the dynamics is still within the perturbative region of the gravity theory , these @xmath0 s will be of similar values , and in this situation , we are eligible to combine results from different binary pulsars , as done in figure  [ fig : sky1 ] .    worthy to reemphasize that the @xmath0 constraints here are based on robust designs of tests , in contrast to the probabilistic tests performed in ref .",
    "the achievement is made possible with multiple observables measured simultaneously . even without a clear knowledge on @xmath39 , picking the worst limit out of all possible limits makes the test very robust .",
    "such ideas were also proposed in refs .",

    "e.g. _ interstellar scintillation  @xcite , we will gain further in constraining the sme parameters .    in the pure - gravity sector of msme",
    ", there are in total nine degrees of freedom to deviate away from gr at leading order  @xcite . here to focus on the theme of testing @xmath0 and to reduce the burden of work , we have assumed that there exists a pf where the spacetime is isotropic .",
    "universal anisotropy can exist in principle within the framework of sme .",
    "therefore , the actual constraint in this paper could be a linear combination of @xmath0 and the other time - spatial and spatial - spatial components of @xmath3 .",
    "however , it was already shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , that the time - spatial and spatial - spatial components of @xmath3 were constrained to very small values at levels of @xmath216@xmath217 , and more importantly , with multiple pulsar systems with different positions in the sky , different spatial orientations of orbits , and different 3-dimensional systematic velocities , the limits of these components tend to have very little mutual correlations ( see figure 3 in ref .",
    "therefore , the limit obtained in this paper is reliable even when there exists no pf at all for the gravity sector in sme .    from another viewpoint , in the past few years ,",
    "the time - spatial and spatial - spatial components in the sun - centered celestial - equatorial frame were already stringently constrained by lunar laser ranging  @xcite , atom interferometry  @xcite , and radio pulsars  @xcite . among these",
    ", the current best limits were obtained from the systematic analysis of 27 tests from 13 pulsar systems  @xcite . from the joint analysis of orbital dynamics of binary pulsars and spin evolution of solitary pulsars , the components of @xmath3 were constrained to be , at 68% confidence level , @xmath218 for @xmath219 , @xmath220 , and @xmath221 , and @xmath222 for @xmath223 , @xmath224 , @xmath225 , @xmath226 , and @xmath227 ( see table 1 in ref .",
