    "over the last years , a considerable number of high - quality observational data have transformed radically the field of cosmology .",
    "results from distance measurements of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) @xcite combined with cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) observations @xcite , dynamical estimates of the clustered matter @xcite , and age measurements of the oldest structures @xcite , seem to indicate that the simple picture provided by the standard cold dark matter scenario is not enough .",
    "these observations are usually explained by introducing a new hypothetical energy component with negative pressure , the so - called dark energy or quintessence ( for recent reviews on this topic , see @xcite ) . besides its consequences on fundamental physics ,",
    "if confirmed , the existence of this dark component would also provide a definitive piece of information connecting the inflationary flatness prediction with astronomical data .    on the other hand , from a purely theoretical viewpoint , the existence of a dark energy is related to an old problem of quantum field theories and theoretical cosmology , namely the role of vacuum in the cosmic evolution @xcite .",
    "arguments of covariance and symmetry lead to an energy - momentum tensor for the vacuum of the form @xmath6 , where @xmath0 is a scalar function which , in spatially homogeneous and isotropic space - times , may be , at most , a function of time only .",
    "therefore , the vacuum acts as a cosmological term , that is , as a perfect fluid with negative pressure given ( in a comoving frame ) by @xmath7 ( we work in units where @xmath8 ) .",
    "nevertheless , any tentative estimation of the vacuum energy density by quantum field theories in flat space - time leads to a divergent result , and any natural cutoff we may choose to impose in those calculations leads to a vacuum contribution at least forty orders of magnitude bigger than the observed limits . ]",
    "appears if we use a cutoff of the order of the energy scale of the qcd chiral phase transition , the latest of the cosmological vacuum transitions . for higher cutoffs , like the planck mass @xmath9 , the difference can be as big as 120 orders of magnitude . ]",
    "a possible way out of this trouble is to postulate some cancellation mechanism that leads to an exactly null vacuum contribution , the observed dark energy being due to a genuine cosmological constant or to other fields like quintessence or any other else .",
    "however , a more careful look at the problem of vacuum energy may suggest another possibility . the divergent result obtained by quantum field theories in flat space - time can not , rigorously speaking , be used in the context of curved , expanding backgrounds . on the other hand , in minkowski space - time",
    "the einstein tensor is null , and , therefore , any vacuum contribution to the energy - momentum tensor , divergent or not , should be canceled by a bare cosmological constant in einstein equations .",
    "now , if we could obtain the vacuum energy density in the expanding background , we should subtract the minkowskian contribution , obtaining a  renormalized \" vacuum density which would depend on the curvature , being very high for early times , but decreasing as the universe expands .",
    "as is well known , the bianchi identities @xmath10 lead , via einstein equations , to @xmath11 , which is an expression of energy - momentum conservation in the presence of the gravitational field . )",
    "is not lost if one supposes @xmath0 to be a scalar function of coordinates @xmath12 .",
    "actually , if one considers the right - hand side of the above equations as a conserved , total energy - momentum tensor @xmath13 , then no changes are needed in the general form of the einstein - hilbert action , although it would be necessary to know the actual interaction term between the matter and vacuum sectors . ] in the flrw space - time , this equation leads to @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the total energy density and pressure , respectively , while @xmath17 is the hubble parameter . by introducing the energy densities and pressures of vacuum and matter / radiation",
    ", one finds @xmath18 the above equation is equivalent to a continuity equation for matter in the presence of a source @xmath19 , meaning that the process of vacuum decay is concomitant to a process of matter production , a general feature of the vacuum state of any non - stationary space - time .",
    "we are probably far away from a definite theory of quantum vacuum in curved backgrounds or from the correspondent microscopic description of vacuum decay .",
    "alternatively , we can consider effective , theoretically or empirically motivated , decaying laws for the vacuum density , exploring its effects by means of macroscopic equations like ( [ continuidade ] ) .",
    "such an approach has an old history in the literature @xcite and a renewed interest in recent years @xcite .    in this regard ,",
    "a viable possibility has been proposed , with the vacuum density decaying as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 has the order of the cube of the energy scale of the qcd vacuum condensation @xcite . by using the observed values of @xmath22 and @xmath23 , it is straightforward to verify that the above law provides a value for @xmath0 very close to the value presently  observed \" .",
    "naturally , the theoretical justification for this decaying law is based on some phenomenological hypothesis and , as such , needs to be verified from a fundamental theory viewpoint .",
    "however , the important aspect here is that it leads to cosmological solutions in agreement with the standard scenario for the evolution of the universe , as explicitly shown in @xcite .",
    "the above decaying law , for instance , leads to an early radiation - dominated phase where the vacuum term and the photon production are negligible , and where the scale factor and temperature evolve exactly as in the standard friedmann solution .",
    "this phase is followed by a matter - dominated decelerating era , long enough to allow structure formation , and during which the vacuum density and matter production are dismissable until very recently . finally , the universe switches to an accelerated expansion driven by the vacuum , which tends asymptotically to de sitter solution .",
    "if we consider the present relative matter density ( the only free parameter of the model , besides the hubble constant ) around @xmath24 , we also obtain the present age parameter @xmath25 , which is in good accordance with current observations @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we are particularly interested in testing the viability of the above scenarios in light of the latest supernova ( sne ia ) data , as provided recently by riess _",
    "_ @xcite and by astier _",
    "as is well known , these two sne ia samples constitute the compilation of best observations made so far and provide the most direct evidence for the observed late - time acceleration of the universe .",
    "we also discuss other observational quantities , as the deceleration parameter @xmath26 , the transition redshift @xmath27 ( at which the expansion switches from a decelerated to an accelerated phase ) , and the total expanding age of the universe . in sec .",
    "ii we revise the main expressions and predictions of the cosmological solution with @xmath28 .",
    "the observational quantities of the model are discussed in sec .",
    "iv presents our sne ia analysis and a discussion on the observational constraints . in sec",
    "v we end the paper by summarizing our main conclusions .",
    "in the context of a flrw space - time with null spatial curvature , the einstein equations lead to the friedmann equation @xmath29 which , together with ( [ continuidade ] ) , the equation of state for the matter fields [ @xmath30 , and a decaying law for @xmath0 , completely describes the evolution of the scale factor and densities .",
    "as discussed earlier , we will consider @xmath20 , so that by combining the above expressions we find @xmath31 by imposing the conditions @xmath32 and @xmath33 , we can also obtain the solution for the scale factor @xcite , i.e. , @xmath34^{\\frac{2}{3\\gamma}},\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the first integration constant and the second one has been set equal to zero , in order to have @xmath36 at @xmath37 .",
    "note that the vacuum and matter densities are , respectively , given by @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "thus , by using eq .",

    "( [ rhoa])-([lambdaa ] ) reduce now to @xmath46 and @xmath47 while , in the limit @xmath48 , we have @xmath49 and @xmath50 from the above expressions , it is straightfoward to see that for small times the expansion is completely driven by the relativistic matter with its energy density scaling as @xmath51 .      for the dust phase ( @xmath52 ) , eq .",
    "( [ a ] ) scales as @xmath53^{2/3},\\ ] ] which means that for small times ( compared to the present ) , it can be approximated by @xmath54 note that the above expression has the same time dependence as in the standard scenario .",
    "this , in other words , amounts to saying that the varying cosmological term starts dominating only very recently , which guarantees a large enough dust - dominated era .",
    "for this matter - dominated epoch , eqs .",
    "( [ rhoa])-([lambdaa ] ) read @xmath55 and @xmath56 the first term in ( [ rhodust ] ) gives the usual scaling of non - relativistic matter fields , whereas the second term is related to the production of matter at the expenses of the vacuum decay .",
    "note that in the limit of large times ( @xmath57 ) , eq .",
    "( [ adust ] ) leads to the de - sitter solution , i.e. , @xmath58 note also [ from ( [ rhodust ] ) and ( [ lambdadust ] ) ] that while @xmath59 tends to zero @xmath0 tends to a genuine cosmological constant .",

    "the friedmann equation ( [ friedmann ] ) for the dust - dominated epoch can be rewritten as @xmath60,\\ ] ] where @xmath61 and @xmath62 stand for the current values of the relative matter density and hubble parameter . from the above equation , it is straightforward to show that the deceleration parameter , defined as @xmath63 , now takes the following form @xmath64 or , at the present time ( @xmath65 ) , @xmath66 note that for any value of @xmath67 ( as indicated by clustering and dynamical estimates @xcite ) , the present - day cosmic expansion is accelerating , which seems to be in full agreement with current supernova observations @xcite ( see sec .",

    "the cosmic acceleration in the presence of dust matter and a cosmological term is given by @xmath69 therefore , the net effect of the additional terms in ( [ rhodust ] ) and ( [ lambdadust ] ) is to increase the acceleration for a given value of @xmath59 .",
    "it is also possible to verify that the transition occurs soon after the first term in ( [ rhodust ] ) is supplanted by the sum of the second term and @xmath0 . in other words ,",

    "sne ia observations are certainly among the most remarkable findings of modern observational cosmology and provide the most direct evidence for the observed late - time cosmic acceleration . in this section we test the viability of the decaying vacuum scenario discussed above through a statistical analysis involving the most recent sne ia data , namely , the high - z sn search ( hzs ) team @xcite and the supernova legacy survey ( snls ) collaboration data @xcite .",
    "the total sample presented by the hzs team consists of 186 events distributed over the redshift interval @xmath75 and constitutes the compilation of the best observations made so far by them and by the supernova cosmology project plus 16 new events observed by hubble space telescope ( hst ) .",
    "this total data - set was divided into `` high - confidence '' ( _ gold _ ) and `` likely but not certain '' ( _ silver _ ) subsets . here",
    ", we will consider only the 157 events that constitute the so - called _ gold _ sample .",
    "the current data from snls collaboration correspond to the first year results of its planned five years survey .",
    "the sample includes 71 high-@xmath76 sne ia in the redshift range @xmath77 and 44 low-@xmath76 sne ia compiled from the literature but analysed in the same manner as the high-@xmath76 sample .",
    "this data - set is arguably ( due to multi - band , rolling search technique and careful calibration ) the best high-@xmath76 sne ia compilation to date , as indicated by the very tight scatter around the best fit in the hubble diagram and a careful estimate of systematic uncertainties .",
    "another important aspect to be emphasized on the snls data is that they seem to be in a better agreement with wmap results than the _ gold _ sample ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a discussion ) . in what follows",

    "i.e. , a flat @xmath0cdm scenario with @xmath95 , is also shown .",

    "we also note that the above reduced value of @xmath106 is very similar to the one found for the flat @xmath0cdm scenario and is slightly larger than the one obtained for the @xmath0cdm model with arbitrary curvature ( @xmath107 ) . for the snls analysis ( fig .",

    "the following era is dominated by dust for a long time , and only recently the varying cosmological term has become important .    here",

    "<S> we show that this @xmath2cdm model is indistinguishable from the standard one ( @xmath0cdm ) in that the early radiation phase is followed by a long dust - dominated era , and only recently the varying @xmath0 term becomes dominant , accelerating the cosmic expansion . in order to test the viability of this scenario we have used the most recent type ia supernova data , i.e. , the high - z sn search ( hzs ) team and the supernova legacy survey ( snls ) collaboration data . in particular , for the snls sample </S>",
