    "the identification of a gunn - peterson trough in the spectra of the most distant quasars at redshifts of @xmath3@xmath4 ( fan et al .  2004 ) hints that the reionization of cosmic hydrogen was completed only around that time , about a billion years after the big bang ( white et al . 2003 ; wyithe & loeb  2004 ) . on the other hand , the recent discovery of ly@xmath0 emission from galaxies beyond a redshift of @xmath1 ( hu et al . , 2002 ; kodaira et al . , 2003 ;",
    "rhoads et al . 2004 ; kurk et al . 2004 ; stern et al .",
    "2004 ) was naively interpreted as an indication that the surrounding intergalactic medium ( igm ) was highly ionized , in apparent conflict with the quasar data .",
    "although a galaxy is often surrounded by an hii region of ionized hydrogen ( haiman  2002 ; santos  2004 ) , its ly@xmath0 line could be heavily suppressed by the red damping wing of the resonant ly@xmath0 absorption in the surrounding igm ( loeb , barkana & hernquist  2004 ; cen , haiman & messinger  2004 ; ricotti et al .",
    "clustering of sources may result in hii regions that are larger than expected for a single galaxy , rendering the optical depth from the red damping wing of the igm irrelevant ( gnedin & prada  2004 ; furlanetto , hernquist & zaldarriaga  2004 ) . here",
    "we show that undetected sources such as short - lived quasars or a cluster of faint galaxies , are expected to dominate the growth of a galaxy s hii region and allow transmission of its ly@xmath0 photons prior to reionization .",
    "the average mean - free - path for an ionizing photon in a fully neutral igm is much smaller than the size of a cosmological hii region . by balancing the number of ionizing photons and neutral atoms we can therefore estimate the characteristic physical size of a spherical hii region surrounding a galaxy with a dark matter halo of mass @xmath5 ( loeb et al .",
    "2004 ) @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the star formation efficiency and @xmath8 is the fraction of ionizing photons that escape from the galaxy into the surrounding igm of neutral hydrogen fraction @xmath9 .",
    "here we have assumed that the number of ionizing photons per baryon incorporated into ( pop - ii ) stars is @xmath10 ( bromm , kudritzki & loeb  2001 ) , and that @xmath11 photons are required per baryon for the reionization of the hii region .",
    "the value of @xmath11 depends on the number of recombinations and hence on the clumpiness of the igm .",
    "the halo mass @xmath12 is a function of its velocity dispersion @xmath13 [ see eqs .",
    "2225 in barkana & loeb  ( 2001 ) ] , which we set equal to @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the halo circular velocity .",
    "similarly , the physical size of the hii region generated by an accreting supermassive black - hole of mass @xmath16 is ( white et al . , 2003 )",
    "@xmath17 where @xmath18 is the production rate of ionizing photons during the luminous quasar phase for a black hole of mass @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the fraction of the halo dynamical time during which the quasar shines at its peak luminosity .",
    "there is ample observational data on the number counts and clustering of quasars .",
    "we therefore compute the size of quasar hii regions using a simple , physically - motivated , and highly successful model for high redshift quasars that has been developed in earlier papers ( wyithe & loeb 2003a,2004 ) . the slow evolution of the quasar clustering correlation length with redshift ( croom et al .",
    "2001 ) implies that the black - hole mass scales with halo velocity dispersion independent of redshift .",
    "this conclusion is supported by direct observations of the @xmath21@xmath13 relation ( shields et al .",
    "the observed scaling and its redshift dependence [ @xmath22 follow naturally from a scenario where black - hole growth is limited by feedback over the galaxy dynamical time ( silk & rees 1998 ; wyithe & loeb  2003a ) . by associating quasar activity with major mergers ,",
    "it has been shown ( wyithe & loeb  2003a ) that when the quasar lifetime equals the galaxy dynamical time the observed number counts of quasars are accurately reproduced over a wide range of redshifts , @xmath23 .",
    "the size of the quasar generated hii region ( @xmath24 ) may therefore be evaluated using equation  ( [ dquasar ] ) , with a black hole mass that is related to the halo velocity dispersion ( wyithe & loeb  2003a ) through @xmath25 , and a lifetime that is governed by a value of @xmath26 corresponding to the typical fraction of the virial radius occupied by the luminous component of the galaxy .",
    "we point out that while the association of a total quasar luminosity with a dark - matter halo must be made via a theoretical model , the model used here correctly predicts the number density of high redshift quasars over a wide range of luminosities and redshifts .",
    "the total number of ionizing photons produced by a quasar ( with a universal spectrum ) during its lifetime , reflects a fixed fraction of its black - hole rest - mass energy .",
    "the ratio between the number of ionizing photons produced by the central quasar and by stars is @xmath27 since the dependence of @xmath28 on halo mass is steeper than linear for @xmath29 , quasars become increasingly more important for higher mass galaxies . given that both massive stars and quasars produce ionizing photons in short - lived episodes , the value of @xmath28 reflects their net yield of ionizing photons .",
    "the hii region generated by quasars remains as a fossil after the quasar activity ends , since the recombination time is longer than the hubble time at the mean igm density for @xmath30 .",
    "hence , relic hii regions from prior quasar activity must be considered when estimating the transmission of ly@xmath0 photons from high redshift galaxies . in what follows",
    "we show that this remains true even when considering the enhanced recombination rate of the overdense igm around massive galaxies .",
    "prior to reionization , galaxies generate their own strmgren ( hii ) spheres with characteristic sizes given by equations  ( [ dstar ] ) and ( [ dquasar ] ) .",
    "these spheres expand into a partially neutral igm .",
    "if the strmgren sphere is produced by a massive galaxy , then the external neutral fraction reflects the mean volume filling factor of all small hii regions produced by its neighboring low - mass galaxies .",
    "the clustering of galaxies around a bright galaxy could lead to overlap of their individual hii regions , even if the rest of the igm is predominantly neutral . as a result",
    "the hii region surrounding an observed galaxy could be larger than expected from equations  ( [ dstar ] ) and ( [ dquasar ] ) due to a cluster of faint galaxies that are below the detection threshold of the observations .",
    "the physical size @xmath31 of the hii region surrounding a galaxy of mass @xmath12 can be determined self - consistently with the mean neutral fraction into which the hii region expands , through the relation @xmath32 where the sizes of the strmgren spheres around the central halo of mass @xmath12 and a galaxy of mass @xmath33 , respectively , are @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "equation  ( [ rs ] ) accounts for the higher igm density due to infall around a massive halo through the nonlinear density contrast @xmath36 ( where @xmath37 is the mean background density ) at a radius @xmath38 from a halo of mass @xmath12 ( barkana  2004 ) .",
    "the associated density profile reproduces the appropriate two - point correlation function in the linear regime ( barkana  2004 ) and is evolved into the nonlinear regime in spherical shells .",
    "the number of galaxies surrounding the central halo is found from the press - schechter  ( 1974 ) mass function of halos , which in the vicinity of a massive halo must be modified relative to the background universe . within the spherical infall model , shells with density @xmath39 at radius @xmath38",
    "behave as if they are embedded in a closed universe with a matter density parameter @xmath40 , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the physical radial velocity of the shell ( the cosmological constant is negligible at the high redshifts of interest . )",
    "thus , @xmath43 is the physical number density of halos per unit mass computed in a universe with a density parameter @xmath44 ( with a normalization and a growth factor based on the local shell density ) .",
    "each hii region reaches its final comoving volume when the production rate of ionizing photons is balanced by the recombination rate interior to that volume . in this phase ,",
    "the hii volume is inversely proportional to the square of the mean density times a clumping factor .",
    "the clumping is accounted for by @xmath11 , but an additional factor of @xmath45 needs to be included on the right - hand - side of equation  ( [ rs ] ) to account for recombinations at the mean density within each shell .",
    "we assume that the most massive galaxy interior to the hii region is the one observed .",
    "this conservative assumption is reflected in the upper limit of the mass integration .",
    "the value @xmath46 is the minimum mass ( barkana & loeb  2001 ) , below which gas infall is suppressed from an ionized region that has been heated to @xmath47k .",
    "next we specify the free parameters in our model .",
    "the absorption spectra of the highest redshift quasars indicate that the most recent reionization of hydrogen occurred at @xmath48 ( fan et al .",
    "2001 ; wyithe & loeb  2004 ) .",
    "moreover , there is evidence for a temperature rise in the ly@xmath0 forest associated with the reionization of heii at @xmath49 ( theuns et al .",
    "we set the free parameters by requiring that hydrogen be reionized by @xmath50 , and helium be doubly reionized by @xmath51 .",
    "population - ii stars do not have spectra that are sufficiently hard to ionize heii , and so in the absence of population - iii stars at low redshifts the ionization fraction of heii is determined by quasars",
    ". the global ionization fractions of intergalactic hydrogen and helium are therefore @xmath52 where @xmath53 assuming the median spectral energy distribution of quasars ( telfer et al .",
    "2002 ) , and that @xmath54 of the photons of sufficient energy to double - ionize helium are utilized in the reionization of hydrogen ( wyithe & loeb  2003b ) . the ratio @xmath55 may be determined from the requirement that @xmath56 approach unity at @xmath49 .",
    "assuming , for simplicity , that @xmath57 and that the spectral slope of quasars blueward of the ionization threshold of hydrogen is specified by their median spectral template ( telfer et al .",
    "2002 ) , the ratio @xmath58 can then be determined from the requirement that @xmath59 approach unity at @xmath48 .",
    "gas clumping is expected to increase with cosmic time . by calibrating @xmath11 based on the reionization of helium and hydrogen at @xmath49 and @xmath60",
    ", we therefore overestimate the significance of recombinations at earlier times and derive conservative results for the minimum transmission of the ly@xmath0 line .",
    "we note that even though our model is calibrated by requiring that hydrogen reionization be completed at @xmath48 by pop - ii stars and quasars , an early generation of massive pop - iii stars may be required to produce a first partial or full reionization of hydrogen at @xmath61@xmath62 .",
    "an early reionization would in provide consistency between the quasar absorption at @xmath48 and the large scale polarization anisotropies of the microwave background detected by the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ ( _ wmap _ ; wyithe & loeb  2003b ; cen  2003 ) .",
    "reionization histories may now be calculated based on equation  ( [ fh ] ) for different star formation prescriptions , with @xmath18 and @xmath7 adjusted to meet the above global requirements .",
    "we adopt feedback - regulated prescriptions ( dekel & woo  2002 ; wyithe & loeb  2003a ) in which the star formation efficiency in a galaxy depends on its velocity dispersion @xmath13 , with @xmath63 for @xmath64 , @xmath65 for @xmath66 , and @xmath67 for @xmath68 .",
    "we consider four cases in this paper : ( * a * )  @xmath69 ; ( * b * )  @xmath70 , @xmath71 ; ( * c * )  @xmath72 ; and ( * d * )  @xmath73 , @xmath74 .",
    "the values of @xmath75 , and @xmath76 , correspond to the threshold for infall of gas from a photo - ionized igm and the threshold for atomic hydrogen cooling , respectively .",
    "the value of @xmath74 is calibrated empirically based on the local sample of galaxies ( kauffman et al .",
    "2003 ; dekel & woo 2002 ) .",
    "we also examine the case of @xmath77 to reflect our ignorance about whether a similar feedback operates at high redshifts , when the dynamical time within galaxies becomes comparable to the lifetime of massive stars .",
    "we have adopted the set of cosmological parameters determined by _ wmap _ ( spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) , and find that a constraint of late reionization at @xmath48 requires values for the parameter combination @xmath78 of 11 , 2 , 22 , and 17 for models * a - d*.    in the central panel of figure  [ fig1 ] , we plot the strmgren radius @xmath31 as a function of the velocity dispersion @xmath13 of a central galaxy at a redshift of @xmath79 .",
    "the four curves correspond to cases * a - d*. these calculations of @xmath31 are self - consistent with the average neutral fraction of the igm , which is obtained from the reionization histories ( eq .  [ fh ] ) , and plotted in the left panel of figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "a rapid , stellar reionization that completes by @xmath50 would imply a neutral fraction of @xmath80@xmath81 at @xmath82 , consistent with the analysis of the hii regions around the highest redshift quasars ( wyithe & loeb  2004 ) . at @xmath79 ,",
    "the hii regions approach a radius of @xmath83  mpc for @xmath84 , comparable to the values inferred for recently discovered galaxies ( kneib et al .",
    "2004 ; rhoads et al .  2004 ) .",
    "galaxies with @xmath85 , corresponding to the hosts of the luminous @xmath86 quasars , have @xmath87mpc in agreement with the observed sizes of their strmgren spheres ( white et al .",
    "2003 ) . for comparison",
    ", we also show by gray lines the naive estimate for the size of the hii region using only the stars within the central halo , and assuming a fully neutral igm at the mean density ( eq .  ( [ dstar ] ) .",
    "at @xmath82 , the ionized regions around galaxies with @xmath88 are sufficiently large to allow transmission of their ly@xmath0 emission line despite the red damping wing of ly@xmath0 absorption from the surrounding igm .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that these galaxies are observed , even if they reside in an igm that is significantly neutral globally .",
    "the optical depth @xmath89 to ly@xmath0 absorption at the galaxy redshift ( miralda - escude  1998 ) is plotted as a function of @xmath13 in the right hand panel of figure  [ fig1 ] for galaxies at @xmath1 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 . here",
    "the size of the hii region is based on equation  ( [ rs ] ) , while the neutral fraction outside the hii region was computed from equation  ( [ fh ] ) . at @xmath91 ,",
    "a galaxy must possess @xmath92 in order to have @xmath93 .",
    "however at @xmath94 , @xmath95 for galaxies with @xmath96 .",
    "hence , observations of galaxies at @xmath17 ( kodaira et al . , 2003 ; rhoads et al .  2004 ;",
    "kurk et al . 2004 ; stern et al . 2004 ) are fully consistent with reionization completing at @xmath48 .",
    "the requirement that hii and heiii be reionized at @xmath48 and @xmath49 respectively , make this conclusion robust against variations in @xmath97 or @xmath11 .",
    "we now explicitly examine the individual contributions from quasars and from the clustering of faint sources to the hii region around massive galaxies .",
    "first , we find the ratio between the quasar and stellar fluxes within the hii region , @xmath98 .",
    "the flux ratio @xmath28 from the central halo is obtained from equation  ( [ fgam ] ) .",
    "the mean flux ratio @xmath99 from other galaxies within the hii region of radius @xmath31 is then @xmath100 and the average flux ratio within the hii region is therefore @xmath101 the left - hand - panel of figure  [ fig2 ] shows @xmath102 for cases * a - d * at @xmath79 .",
    "quasars make a substantial contribution to the strmgren volume around massive galaxies , particularly in case-*a*. however the cluster of smaller galaxies surrounding the central halo contributes an overall ionizing luminosity that is mostly stellar , resulting in a value of @xmath98 that is smaller than @xmath28 .",
    "the fraction of the hii region excavated by the central galaxy is found from the ratio @xmath103 .",
    "this quantity is shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig2 ] as a function of @xmath13 for galaxies at @xmath79 .",
    "the regions around massive galaxies are predominantly ionized by the surrounding cluster of smaller galaxies .",
    "the luminous quasars discovered at @xmath86 have , during their active phase , luminosities in excess of the time - averaged luminosity of these clusters , and are therefore observed as the source of their hii region .",
    "the massive galaxies discovered prior to reionization should have strmgren spheres that are much larger than naively expected from the uv continuum flux of their stars .",
    "this increase arises for two reasons : _ (",
    "i ) _ there is an additional contribution from earlier quasar activity within the central and surrounding galaxies , and _",
    "( ii ) _ there is a biased clustering of faint sources surrounding the central galaxy which results in overlap of nearby hii regions at a time before overlap is achieved throughout the universe . the large extent of the hii regions allow transmission of ly@xmath0 photons from galaxies .",
    "we conclude that the discovery of ly@xmath0 emission from bright galaxies at @xmath104 does not indicate a highly ionized igm .",
    "nevertheless , the strength of the ly@xmath0 damping increases as the galaxy luminosity decreases or the redshift increases ( see the right - hand panel of fig . [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "a neutral igm would therefore suppress the low - luminosity end of the ly@xmath0 luminosity function of galaxies at high redshifts ."
