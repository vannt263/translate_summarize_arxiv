    "asymmetric simple exclusion processes ( asep ) have become an important tool for understanding complex non - equilibrium phenomena in chemistry , physics and biology @xcite . in the absence of fundamental framework for non - equilibrium systems asep",
    "have emerged as reference models , and they play the role similar to the ising model in the studies of equilibrium systems @xcite .",
    "aseps have been applied successfully to analyze the kinetics of biopolymerization @xcite , protein synthesis @xcite , molecular transport through nanopores and channels @xcite , the motion of motor proteins along cytoskeleton filaments @xcite , and investigation of car traffic processes @xcite .",
    "aseps are one - dimensional models where particles , that interact via an exclusion potential , hop along discrete lattices .",
    "many non - equilibrium processes can be described by single - channel exclusion processes .",
    "however , the necessity to analyze more realistic complex phenomena , that involve the transport along the parallel channels and existence of internal states , e.g. , motor proteins , vehicular traffic and hopping of quantum dots , stimulated the development of multi - channel aseps @xcite . theoretical analysis of multi - channel exclusion processes indicates that a coupling between channels has a strong effect on stationary - state phase diagrams and it leads to several unusual phenomena , such as localized domain walls @xcite .",
    "one of the most intriguing phenomena observed in aseps is symmetry breaking when the microscopic symmetric dynamic rules lead to the existence of macroscopic asymmetric stationary - state properties for some sets of parameters @xcite .",
    "however , mechanisms of symmetry breaking phenomena in aseps are still not well understood @xcite . currently , these phenomena are mostly described by mean - field approaches that neglect the correlations in the system , however , the agreement with computer simulations results is rather qualitative @xcite .",
    "there are suggestions that dynamic amplifications of fluctuations might lead to a broken symmetry in the asymmetric exclusion processes @xcite .",
    "it is also argued that the origin of this phenomena might be due to the effective boundary defects @xcite .",
    "note also that symmetry - breaking has not been obtained in the exact solutions of aseps @xcite .",
    "originally , the symmetry breaking has been observed in the single - lane exclusion process with two particles moving in opposite directions @xcite . using a mean - field approach and monte carlo computer simulations",
    ", it was shown that two stationary phases with broken symmetry are possible for some part of the parameter space , although , surprisingly , the agreement between theoretical predictions and numerical calculations was not good , in contrast to other steady - state properties of other aseps where the mean - field description is rather successful @xcite .",
    "there are controversial reports about the number of phases with broken symmetry .",
    "the existence of one of the symmetry - broken phase has been disputed on the basis of computer simulations by arndt et al .",
    "more extensive computer simulations @xcite confirmed the presence of two asymmetric phases , but also it was argued that phase transitions to the symmetric phase is different from the mean - field predictions .",
    "however , extensive high - precision monte carlo data @xcite indicated that the disputed intermediate phase is a finite - size effect and it disappears for very large systems .",
    "it is not clear if this observation of single asymmetric phase is correct for all aseps where the symmetry breaking have been observed . in addition , in single - channel two - species asep , where the symmetry breaking is observed , particles of different types interact with each other at every site of the lattice , i.e. , the interaction is global .",
    "it is not clear how the interaction between these particles localized in the specific parts of the system will affect the symmetry breaking .    in this paper",
    "we investigate two - lane aseps with two types of particles moving along different channels in opposite directions .",
    "the particles can not jump between the lanes , and two channels interact with each other only at the boundaries .",
    "the problem is motivated by the cellular transport of kinesin and dynein motor proteins that move along microtubules in opposite directions @xcite .",
    "the system is analyzed using a mean - field theoretical approach and extensive monte carlo computer simulations at different system sizes , and we conclude that the symmetry breaking is taking place in this system for some range of parameters .",
    "this observation supports the idea that symmetry breaking can be viewed as an effective boundary - induced phenomenon .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we give a detailed description of the model and we solve it in the mean - field approximation .",
    "in section 3 we present and discuss monte carlo computer simulations , and we compare them with theoretical predictions .",
    "finally , we summarize and conclude in section 4 .",
    "we consider a system of two parallel one - dimensional lattices with two types of particles moving in the different lanes in the opposite directions , as shown in fig",
    "two channels are identical and both have @xmath0 sites .",
    "the particles are interacting with hard - core exclusion potential which means that each lattice site can be empty , or it can be occupied by no more than one particle .",
    "the hoppings between the channels are not allowed , and the particle in the channel 1 ( 2 ) moves to the right ( left ) with the rate 1 if the next site is empty .",
    "the particles can enter the corresponding channel with the rate @xmath1 if the first site at the given lane is empty _ and _ the site @xmath0 at the other channel is unoccupied : see fig .",
    "1 . the particles exit both lanes with the same rate @xmath2 , that does not depend on the occupancy of the site 1 in the other channel . note that the particle at site @xmath3 can proceed to the site @xmath0 if the exit site is unoccupied independently of the status of site 1 at the other lattice .",
    "thus this model can be viewed as two - channel asep with narrow entrances .     if there are no particle at the exit of the other lane .",
    "exit rates are equal to @xmath4 at both channels independently of the occupation status of the exit site at the other channel . ]    the model , as described above and illustrated in fig .",
    "1 , is similar to a single - channel asep with two species where symmetry breaking has been previously observed @xcite",
    ". however , there are several important differences between two systems : in our model there are no restrictions on the bulk densities of particles in both channels and only the entrance to the channel is influenced by the other channel .",
    "the interaction between two types of particles is local in our system , in contrast to single - channel two - species aseps where particles interact along the whole lattice .",
    "theoretical studies of aseps indicate that an approximate mean - field analysis provides a very good description of these processes , as confirmed by comparison with available exact solutions and computer simulations @xcite . following this approach , we introduce @xmath5 and @xmath6 as occupation variables for the channel 1 and 2 , respectively , such that @xmath7 and/or @xmath8 if the corresponding site @xmath9 in the channel 1 and/or channel 2 is occupied , and 0 otherwise .",
    "the mean - field theory then assumes that there are no correlations in the probability of finding two particles at any two sites , i.e. , @xmath10    our system with particles moving on two channels in opposite directions can be viewed as two single - lane aseps with exit rates @xmath4 and entrance rates @xmath11 and @xmath12 for the lane 1 and 2 , respectively . from the dynamic rules of the system",
    "we conclude that the effective entrance rates are given by @xmath13 large - time dynamics and properties of single - channel asep are known exactly @xcite . in this case",
    "there are three stationary phases , specified by the processes at the entrance , at the exit and in the bulk of the system . for @xmath14 and @xmath15 the entrance is the rate - limiting step in the overall dynamics , and the system is found in a low - density ( ld ) phase with the particle current and bulk density @xmath16 when the exit is the slowest process in the particle dynamics ( for @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) , the system is in a high - density ( hd ) phase with steady - state properties given by @xmath19 for @xmath20 and @xmath21 the dynamics of the system is determined by processes in the bulk , and we have a maximal - current ( mc ) phase with @xmath22    since every channel can be found in one of three stationary phases , there are nine possible phases in the two - lane asep with narrow entrances , assuming that the dynamics in the channels is independent of each other . however",
    ", some of the phases might not exist . because of the coupling at the boundaries of the channels some of the phases could be asymmetric . to investigate this possibility",
    "let us consider separately symmetric and asymmetric cases .      in symmetric phases all properties in both channels are identical , @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the stationary - state particle current and the bulk density in the channel @xmath9 ( with @xmath26 , 1 ) .",
    "because of the symmetry , the probabilities to find particles in both channels are related via @xmath27    in mc phase the stationary current is equal to @xmath28 . from the expression for the current at the exit of the channel 2 , @xmath29 we derive @xmath30 . substituting this result into eq .",
    "( [ eq_1 ] ) yields the value for the effective entrance rate , @xmath31 then the conditions for the existence of this phase ( @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) can be written as @xmath34    in ld phase the current in both channels is equal to @xmath35 .",
    "the exit current from the lane 2 is equal to @xmath36 and we obtain @xmath37 . after substituting this result into eq .",
    "( [ eq_1 ] ) , it can be shown that @xmath38 because in the low - density phase @xmath39 and @xmath40 , one can show that the condition for existence of this phase is the following , @xmath41    another possible symmetric phase is hd phase where @xmath42 . because the exit current in the channel 2 is @xmath43 , we can show that @xmath44 .",
    "the existence of this phase is specified by the condition @xmath45 , and it can take place only for @xmath46 .",
    "this suggests that the hd phase can not be found in two - lane asep with narrow entrances .      in asymmetric phases",
    "the currents and densities in each channel are generally different , @xmath47 first , let us consider the possibility of phases when one of the lanes supports the maximal - current phase",
    ". for convenience , assume that the channel 1 is in the maximal - current state .",
    "the mc / hd phase is specified by @xmath48 however , these conditions contradict each other , and we conclude that mc / hd phase does not exist .    similarly , the conditions of existence for mc / ld phase can be written as @xmath49 the stationary currents in the system are given by @xmath50 which leads to the following expressions , @xmath51}{\\beta}.\\ ] ] because @xmath52 , it requires that @xmath53 > 1.\\ ] ] however , this expression can not be satisfied for @xmath54 and @xmath2 , and it leads us to conclusion that the mc / ld phase also can not exist in the two - lane asep with narrow entrances .",
