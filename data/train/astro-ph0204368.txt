    "the fourier spectrum can be a powerful technique in the search for periodic signals , pulsations , and quasi - periodic oscillations in the light curve of a x - ray source .",
    "the fourier power density @xmath8 is used to describe the variability amplitude at different frequency @xmath9 .",
    "a peak with power in excess of the noise distribution power in the fourier spectrum indicates the existence of a periodic component in the light curve .",
    "when estimating the amplitude of a periodic signal from the fourier power density spectrum , one must assume that the shape of a signal pulse is sinusoidal , which is usually not true for variability due to real physical processes .",
    "even more care should be taken in interpreting the fourier spectrum of an aperiodic process in the time domain .",
    "it is a prevalent misconception that the fourier power spectrum is the only way to express the distribution of variability amplitude vs. time scale , and that @xmath10 is a quantity describing the variability amplitude for the time scale @xmath11 .",
    "the actual relation between the fourier power and the variability process occurring in the time domain is given by parseval s theorem : @xmath12 or equivalently , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the counting rate at @xmath15 .",
    "parseval s theorem states that the integral of the fourier power density over the whole frequency range is equal to the variability power of the same process in the time domain .",
    "in fact , that is just the reason why the quantity @xmath16 is called _ power _ density .",
    "however , parseval s theorem says nothing about the power density _ distribution _ over the time domain .",
    "the fourier power at any given frequency within the limited range , @xmath17 , actually represents a sum of complex amplitudes from an infinite number of aliased frequencies , each contribution of which is reduced by a factor of sinc@xmath18 , with the sum of the squares of all the factors being unity .",
    "in contrast , the power at any given frequency in a time - based spectrum is most sensitive to the _ rate of change _ of the fourier spectrum with frequency near the nyquist frequency ( @xmath19 ) and its aliases , since the sinc function given above is changing most rapidly for such frequencies . the rms variation vs. time scale of a time series",
    "may , in fact , differ substantially from its fourier spectrum . even in the simplest case , where the signal is purely sinusoidal with a frequency @xmath20 , the fourier spectrum is a @xmath21 function for the continuous fourier transform or approximately a @xmath21 function for the discrete case .",
    "such a function has little power density at frequencies except those near @xmath20 , which , although in this case is a clear representation of what physical process is going on , is still not an accurate representation of the variability of the amplitude in a time series .",
    "only when the time step is set equal to or much greater than the period , @xmath22 , can the corresponding light curve ( or pulse profile ) of a sinusoidal signal be completely flattened to make the time variation vanish . at time scales shorter than @xmath23 , however , a variation of intensity still exists in the light curve , and under some circumstances one would wish that power over this region should not be zero .",
    "in fact , different but mathematically equivalent representations with different bases or functional coordinates in the frequency domain do exist for certain light curves .",
    "the fourier transform with its trigonometric basis is just one of many possible transforms between the time and frequency domains , and may not necessarily represent the true power distribution of a _ physical _ process in the time domain .",
    "one can also argue that any observable physical process always occurs in the time domain , and this is why real variability amplitudes at different time scales are useful in understanding a time varying process , in addition to the understanding gleaned from the conventional fourier spectrum .",
    "an algorithm to calculate the power density spectrum directly in the time domain without using the fourier transform has been proposed ( @xcite ) .",
    "we introduce the algorithm and compare the power spectra in the time domain with the fourier spectra for different kinds of time process model in  1 .",
    "we have studied the power density spectra of a sample of neutron stars and black hole binaries , in both the frequency _ and _ the time domains .",
    "the results are presented in  3 .",
    "a discussion of the potential gain in the understanding the intrinsic nature of physical processes occurring near compact objects via comparison of the two kinds of power density spectrum is given in  4 .",
    "the initial definition of the variation power in a light curve @xmath24 is @xmath25 where the light curve @xmath26 , is a counting series obtained from a time history of observed photons with a time step @xmath27 , @xmath28 is the corresponding rate series , and @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the average counts and count rates , respectively .",
    "the unit used for a power @xmath31 in spectral analysis in astronomy is usually rms@xmath32 , where rms refers to the analysed time series @xmath33 . in the case of @xmath33 being a counting series ,",
    "the power @xmath31 can be expressed in units of counts@xmath32/s@xmath32 .",
    "@xmath34 represents an integral of variability power for the region of time scale @xmath35 .",

    ", the number @xmath33 of counts per bin may be too small for it to behave as a normally distributed variable .",
    "but it is easy to get a large enough total number ( @xmath55 ) of segments from a certain observation period to satisfy the condition for applying the central limit theorem as well as for using the normal statistics on the mean @xmath60 .    to compare the power spectrum in the time domain with the fourier spectrum for the same process , we study three different kinds of time series .",

    "the fourier spectrum is shown by the dashed line in the middle panel of fig .",
    "1 . the areas under the two power density curves in fig . 1 are the same , as dictated by parseval s theorem .",
    "it is obvious that the fourier spectrum can not be interpreted as the distribution of variability amplitude vs. time scale .",
    "the power being concentrated at the sinusoid frequency @xmath20 does not mean that the intensity variation of the process exists only at the corresponding time scale @xmath23 .",
    "from the light curves with time steps @xmath62 s and 0.28 s , shown in the bottom panel of fig . 1 , we can see that variation of the intensity definitely exists at time scales @xmath63 s , but almost no power does in the fourier spectrum at those time scales .",
    "in contrast with the fourier spectrum , the power density spectrum determined in the time domain ( the solid line in the middle panel of fig.1 ) gives a proper description of the variability amplitude distribution of time scales .",
    "figure 2 shows the power density spectrum ( the solid line in the bottom panel ) derived in the time domain and the corresponding fourier spectrum ( the dashed line in the bottom panel ) for a periodic triangular signal ( the top panel ) .",
    "the fourier spectrum is obtained with 8192-point fft for a light curve with time step 1 ms .",
    "the many peaks at short time scales in the fourier spectrum ( high frequency harmonics ) do not mean that there really exist strong variations in the process at those time scales , which are just necessitated by mathematically decomposing the triangular signal into sine waves . as a result , a fourier spectrum may overestimate power densities at short time scales ( high frequency harmonics region ) for a periodic signal with pulse shape being far from a sinusoid .",

    "in the bottom panel of fig .  5 , the solid line shows the power density distribution expected for the signal @xmath93 , the plus signs indicate excess power densities in the light curve @xmath24 estimated by eqs .",
    "( 5)-(10 ) and the dashed line by fft . from fig .  5 , we can see , similar to the case of stochastic shot process , that the proposed algorithm of evaluating power densities in the time domain is capable of extracting the power spectrum of the signal from noisy data and that the fourier spectrum significantly underestimate the power densities at time scales around or shorter than the characteristic time scale of a stochastic process .",
    "as revealed by above study based on simulations , the power density spectrum derived in the time domain can describe the real power distribution with respect to time scale for different time processes .",

    ". then we remove all ineffective data points caused by failure due to the satellite , detector or data accumulation system , and calculate the power density spectra in the time domain , being based on a similar procedure in our simulation .",
    "the corresponding fourier spectra are constructed by using @xmath100 s ( @xmath101 ) time resolution light curves divided into parts containing 8192 bins .",

    "the left panel of fig .",
    "7 is from the qpo source , sco x-1 , whose power density spectrum in the time domain also shows a strong qpo structure but the peak shifts to shorter time scales due to the steep slope of the sinc function near the nyquist frequencies ( 7 - 12.5 hz ) as more and more of the 6 + hz qpo is accommodated by the time sampling .",
    "the difference between the spectrum of time domain and the fourier spectrum at short time scales for cyg x-2 ( see the right panel of fig .",

    "we first analyze the canonical source cygnus x-1 . on may 10 , 1996 ( day 131 of 1996 ) ,",
    "the all - sky monitor on rxte revealed that cyg x-1 started a transition from the normal low ( hard ) state to a high ( soft ) state .",

    "a fourier power density spectrum presented in the time domain can not be interpreted as the real power density distribution of the physical process studied . in principal ,",
    "the power densities in the time domain can be derived from a fourier spectrum only when one knows every power density spectrum in the time domain for each sinusoidal function at all fourier frequencies and adds them up with weight factors being the fourier amplitudes .",

    "the power density spectrum @xmath75 in the time domain obtained from an observation depends only on the intrinsic nature of the signal process and the statistical property of the observed data , as does the fourier power spectrum in the frequency domain .",
    "our simulation studies show that the proposed algorithm , eqs .",

    "these results indicate that the technique of spectral analysis in the time domain is a useful tool in timing and worth applying in temporal analysis for different sources . from figs .",
    "( 1 ) - ( 5 ) one can see that the difference of the fourier spectrum with the spectrum in the time domain is dependent on the model of time series and sensitive to the characteristic time of a stochastic process .",
    "we can then use the difference between two kinds of spectrum to study the intrinsic nature of a studied process .",
    "the power spectra shown in figs .",
    "( 8) and ( 9 ) for black hole candidates have a common character that the fourier spectra are significantly lower than the corresponding time - based spectra in the time scale region of @xmath102  s , which is similar to the simulation results for the stochastic shot model ( fig .",
    "3 ) or the markov process ( fig . 5 ) .",
    "the existence of stochastic shots in x - ray light curves of cyg x-1 has been noticed for a long time . with an improved searching and superposing algorithm and pca / rxte data of cyg x-1 in different states , feng ,",
    "li & chen ( 1998 ) find that the average shot profiles can be described by exponentials with characteristic time scales @xmath104 s. pottschmidt et al ( 1998 ) point out that an autoregressive process of first order with a relaxation time @xmath65 of about 0.1  s can reproduce approximately the variability of cyg x-1 .",

    "the qpo components behave in a more complicated fashion , but can be understood through the sensitivity of the time - based spectrum to variation at 2@xmath21 t , i.e. , at half the fourier sampling frequency ( the nyquist frequency ) .",

    "<S> the interpretation of fourier spectra in the time domain is critically examined . </S>",
    "<S> power density spectra defined and calculated in the time domain are compared with fourier spectra in the frequency domain for three different types of variability : periodic signals , markov processes and random shots . </S>",
    "<S> the power density spectra for a sample of neutron stars and black hole binaries are analyzed in both the time and the frequency domains . </S>",
    "<S> for broadband noise , the two kinds of power spectrum in accreting neutron stars are usually consistent with each other , but the time domain power spectra for black hole candidates are significantly higher than corresponding fourier spectra in the high frequency range ( 101000 hz ) . comparing the two kinds of power density spectra may help to probe the intrinsic nature of timing phenomena in compact objects . </S>"
