    "unlike simple liquids , where two - body potentials describe interactions at the atomistic levels , complex liquid interactions are always a result of an average process over the microscopic degrees of freedom . as a result",
    ", highly simplified models often accurately describe a number of experimental features ranging from structural to thermophysical properties .",
    "examples include colloidal dispersions , macromolecules , and combinations of the two @xcite . a noteworthy feature of these system is that the hard - core repulsive barrier for very short range is not an essential ingredient of the model . in the case of highly ramified polymers in good solvent ( star polymers ) , for instance , the center - of - mass of two polymer chains can be at a distance much smaller than their respective radii of gyration and they are well described by an effective gaussian interaction @xcite .",
    "the simplest of this class of minimal bounded potential is the so - called penetrable spheres ( ps ) @xcite that has attracted considerable attention in the last few years ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . in this case",
    "the infinite barrier of the hard sphere ( hs ) potential is replaced by a finite one , thus allowing for a finite probability of penetrating inside the core .",
    "a major advantage of the ps potential is , of course , simplicity . on the other hand",
    ", it lacks an attractive part which is expected to be relevant in such a complex environment in view of the ubiquity of van der waals dispersion forces .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to address this point by proposing a variation of the ps model in which a square well ( sw ) is added outside the core .",
    "this model , hereafter referred to as penetrable square - well ( psw ) , has an extremely rich phenomenology notwithstanding its simplicity , including a number of interesting limiting cases as will be discussed later on .",
    "one - dimensional bounded interactions do not belong to the class of nearest - neighbor fluids for which the total potential energy can be written as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the pair potential and @xmath2 are the coordinates of the @xmath3 particles confined in a segment of length @xmath4 , which eventually may be let to go to infinity .",
    "a necessary ( but not sufficient ) condition for a one - dimensional fluid to satisfy eq .   is to be a hard - core fluid , i.e. , a fluid made of particles which can not penetrate one another due to the existence of an infinite repulsive potential barrier in @xmath1 .",
    "nearest - neighbor fluids admit an analytic exact statistical - mechanical solution in one - dimension @xcite : the partition function , equation of state , and correlation functions of any order can be calculated analytically from the knowledge of the pair potential .",
    "in addition to hs @xcite , both structural and thermophysical properties can be analytically obtained in one dimension for baxter s sticky hard - sphere ( shs ) potential @xcite , and for the sw potential @xcite , but the technique permits in principle the analysis of a large class of nearest - neighbor one - dimensional potentials .    in the absence of the nearest - neighborhood constraint ( as happens with bounded potentials ) , the situation is far more complex and we are not aware of any general analytical approach to the problem , even in one dimension . as a matter of fact there exist only a few examples of analytically solvable one - dimensional models of this type , which include the kac potential @xcite and the coulomb potential @xcite . for ps ,",
    "it was observed @xcite that the exact analytic solution for hs can be efficiently exploited to build a rather precise , albeit approximate , solution of the penetrable counterpart .",
    "this analysis is here extended to psw interactions .",
    "using a low density expansion and the corresponding exact solution for the sw problem , we derive the exact result up to the second order in a density expansion of the radial distribution function and up to fourth order in the virial expansion of the equation of state .",
    "these exact low density calculations are contrasted with approximate theories such as the percus - yevick ( py ) and the hypernetted chain ( hnc ) closures , thus providing an assessment on the relative reliability of both approximations and the low density expansion . as a preliminary simplified step to our calculation",
    ", we also examine the penetrable counterpart of the shs problem , denoted as sticky penetrable spheres ( sps ) in the following , which provides a guideline to tackle the more difficult psw problem .",
    "the introduction of an attractive part of the potential into a penetrable interaction raises the important issue of the existence of a well defined thermodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "we address this problem for the psw model and provide compelling arguments to identify the stability region , which is guaranteed for a sufficiently small ( @xmath5 ) ratio between the attractive and repulsive energy scales and arbitrary values of the other parameters .    the remaining of the paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec : psw ]",
    "we introduce the model along with all its limiting cases ( including the sps fluid ) and we study its stability .",
    "section [ sec : formalism ] briefly accounts for the main equations necessary for the analytical solution of the nearest - neighbor class of fluids with arbitrary interactions .",
    "the exact solution of the one - dimensional shs potential is derived within this general approach in section [ sec : exactshs ] and this is used to obtain the corresponding low density solution of the sps in section [ sec : exactsps ] .",
    "a similar analysis is carried out in section [ sec : exactpsw ] for psw and the results are contrasted with those stemming from py and hnc closures .",
    "section [ sec : conclusions ] contains some closing remarks , whereas some of the more technical details are confined in suitable appendices .",
    "the penetrable square - well ( psw ) model is defined by the following pair potential ( see fig .",
    "[ potential ] ) @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are two positive constants accounting for the repulsive and attractive parts of the potential , respectively . here",
    "@xmath9 is the diameter of the sphere ( length of the rod in one dimension ) and @xmath10 is the width of the well .",
    "this model has a number of relevant limiting cases . when @xmath11 it reduces to a square - well ( sw ) fluid , whereas @xmath12 yields the penetrable - sphere ( ps ) model studied in ref .",
    "@xcite in the one - dimensional case .",
    "in addition it gives rise to an interesting variation , referred to as `` sticky penetrable spheres '' ( sps ) , within an appropriate limit of infinite well depth of vanishing width ( see below ) .",
    "finally , we recover the hard - sphere ( hs ) fluid in the combined limit @xmath13 and @xmath12 .    it is worthwile noting that the psw model ( and its variants ) considered here is different from other apparently similar models like the widom - rowlinson s of interpenetrating spheres @xcite , the concentric - shell model @xcite , or the permeable - sphere model @xcite ,    as usual , a very important role is played by the mayer function @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the inverse of the thermal energy ( @xmath16 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath17 is the absolute temperature ) . in the present model ,",

    "it also proves convenient to introduce the ratio @xmath28 which is a measure of the depth of the attractive well , relative to the `` penetrability '' of the core . in that way , eq .",

    "although the psw model can be defined for any dimensionality of the system , throughout the remainder of this paper we will specialize to the one - dimensional case .      as anticipated in the introduction , in our model we need to make sure that the system is always _",
    "stable _ in the sense that the total energy is always bounded from below by @xmath32 , @xmath3 being the number of particles and @xmath33 being an arbitrary positive constant @xcite .",
    "the physical origin of such an instability can be traced back to the fact that a soft core allows the possibility of a `` collapsed - state '' where the energy is no longer proportional to the number of particles @xmath3 and a well - defined thermodynamic limit may not exist . in a classic paper , fisher and ruelle @xcite provided a set of conditions on the pair potentials which are sufficient for stability , but the actual implementation of such conditions in soft - core systems is far from being trivial as was recently shown for gaussian - core models @xcite and lennard - jones fluids @xcite .    in the psw model ,",
    "the issue is clearly related to the interplay between the two energy scales , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , for the repulsive and attractive parts of the potential .",
    "as shown in appendix [ app : ruelle ] , we predict that the system _ might be unstable _ when @xmath34 whereas we prove that it is _ certainly stable _ in the opposite case @xmath35 .",
    "it is instructive at this point to consider a particular limit of the psw model which will be referred to as the sticky penetrable - sphere ( sps ) model ( see fig .",
    "[ potential ] ) .",
    "this is a variation of a widely used",
    "_ sticky hard - sphere _ ( shs )",
    "model introduced long time ago by baxter @xcite , which has proven to be extremely useful in the framework of complex fluids , recently even in its anisotropic version @xcite .",

    "( [ psw : eq3 ] ) ] , which becomes @xmath36 where @xmath37 the relation with the sps model is then provided by @xmath38 in the original shs model @xcite , @xmath39 , ( @xmath40 playing the role of an effective temperature ) but the connection with the psw model is readily achieved from eq . by considering the limits @xmath41 and @xmath42 so that @xmath43 remains finite . in spite of its usefulness",
    ", the shs model is known to suffer from some mathematical drawbacks , the most important of them being that it is unstable in spatial dimensions greater than @xmath25 , as pointed out by stell @xcite , in view of the divergence of the virial coefficient corresponding to a close packed configuration . for the sps model",
    "we will be able to achieve a number of exact results which can be exploited as a guideline for the more complex psw model .",
    ".[tab : models ] summary of the models . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in all previous cases , we have tacitly assumed @xmath44 . in principle , however , nothing prevents to consider the opposite case @xmath45 ( what implies @xmath46 ) . in this case",
    "the psw potential gives rise to an interesting class of models , at least from an academic point of view , with two positive energy scales ( @xmath7 and @xmath47 ) .",
    "if @xmath48 , we get a purely repulsive potential that could be called the penetrable square - shoulder ( pss ) model ( see fig .  [ potential ] ) .",
    "a peculiar situation occurs if @xmath49 : when two particles approach they have first to overcome the barrier @xmath47 at @xmath50 ; once done , they feel an attractive well of depth @xmath51 for @xmath52 .",
    "thus the potential is attractive for short distances and repulsive for larger distances .",
    "the simplest version of models with @xmath53 and @xmath49 corresponds to @xmath54 , which will be referred to as the hollow penetrable - sphere ( hps ) model ( see fig .",
    "[ potential ] ) .",
    "if , in addition , the limit @xmath55 is taken , one gets an _",
    "athermal _ potential that will be referred to as the hollow hard - sphere ( hhs ) model since the particles look like hard spheres of diameter @xmath56 with a `` hole '' of diameter @xmath9 inside .",
    "if two particles are separated by a distance larger than @xmath56 , they behave as hard spheres and never know about their holes . on the other hand ,",
    "if the separation between them is smaller than @xmath9 , they can never separate a distance larger than @xmath9 . in the hhs model , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , so that the functions @xmath59 and @xmath60 are well defined ( see below ) . in section [ subsec : py_hnc ] we will discuss the results for representative values of the parameters . a summary of the penetrable models treated in this paper , along with the corresponding values for the values for @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath61 characterizing them , is reported in table [ tab : models ] .",
    "the great advantage of dealing with one - dimensional models is that they are usually amenable to exact solutions , at least in the limit of sufficiently short range interactions @xcite .",
    "the trade - off is of course the fact that these models do not have phase transitions . in the context of fluids",

    "we obtain a pss model with successive soft repulsive barriers of decreasing height . if the second barrier is higher that the first ( @xmath202 ) , we find a potential that is attractive for short distances and repulsive for larger distances .",

    "this analysis mirrors that already performed for the ps model @xcite , can be tested against numerical simulations , and nicely complements the exact low - density results presented here .",
