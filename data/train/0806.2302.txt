    "massive stars in starbursts are thought to form predominantly in super star clusters ( sscs ) , which are massive , compact , young stellar clusters that are candidates for present - day analogues of young globular clusters because of their similar sizes and inferred masses ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although the great majority of sscs could be short - lived , destined to dissolve within  @xmath4 megayears ( ma ) and merge into the field star population @xcite , it is clear that their massive stars dominate feedback in starbursts .",
    "they return enriched matter and energy to the interstellar medium ( ism ) via stellar winds and supernovae , and their hard radiation fields heat and excite gas and destroy molecules and dust grains .",
    "a high surface density of star formation produces galactic - scale superwinds that can expel the ism from a galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "sscs are probably formed within giant molecular cloud complexes , so observations that can probe embedded dusty regions are required to detect the youngest sscs . by the time sscs",
    "have blown away enough of their natal material to be detected at visible wavelengths , they are usually at least several million years old , so their most massive individual stars are expected to have already evolved off of the main sequence . at this stage",
    "it is difficult to infer much about ssc formation environments , because the massive stars have significantly altered them .",
    "infrared and radio wavelengths are best suited to studying the youngest sscs , and radio interferometry has revealed a population of heavily obscured , compact thermal radio sources with inferred nebular densities n@xmath5 @xmath6 and radii of a few parsecs that appear to be powered by 100s-1000s of massive stars .",
    "these sources were dubbed ultra - dense hiirs ( udhiis , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in analogy with galactic ultra - compact hiirs ( uchiis , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which are excited by one or a few massive stars on subparsec scales , with n@xmath7 @xmath6 .",
    "udhiis are thought to be young , embedded sscs that have not yet disrupted and expelled the majority of their natal and surrounding material .",
    "their hard intrinsic emission is absorbed and reprocessed by surrounding dense gas and dust to emerge as a thermal blackbody component in the mid - ir , where it peaks at @xmath8 m depending on the temperature and distribution of the dust ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in the radio regime , udhiis are identified by a thermal bremsstrahlung spectrum that is self - absorbed below a few cm ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these features dominate the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of udhiis and can be used along with any escaping visible light emission to constrain the temperature , density , and geometry of the gas and dust excited by the ssc , as well as the age and stellar content of the cluster itself ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the galaxy has three bright extended regions in the irac bands , two of which correspond to the radio and optical regions a1 and a2 , and a third ( region b , not included in the hst field of view ) that is offset to the southwest and fainter in all bands .",

    "in order to interpret the measured seds , we begin by considering a simple model that ic  4662 requires a mixed model for its dust rather than a foreground screen . ] of a star cluster embedded in an hii region which is embedded in a dust cocoon , following @xcite and motivated by the uchii models of e.g. @xcite .",
    "the sed produced by this system is the sum of an optically thick , radio free - free component ( assumed to be a constant - density , dust - free hiir at a temperature of @xmath24 k extending from the center to an inner radius ) and an optically thin dust shell component ( extending from the inner to an outer radius with a constant density of silicate grains and a power - law temperature profile ) .",
    "we fit the seds from 3 cm to 5 @xmath14 m of a1 ( a2 ) to this model and arrive at hiir parameters : half - light radii of 4 ( 2.4 ) pc , n@xmath25 @xmath6 , and gas masses of about @xmath26 m@xmath2 .",
    "the dust shells have temperatures at the inner radius of @xmath27 k and masses of about @xmath28 m@xmath2 .",
    "the low model gas and dust masses relative to other udhiis like those in he  @xmath29 @xcite suggest that the exciting clusters a1 and a2 are more evolved , and have destroyed or ejected more of their surrounding matter in the process of emerging from their cocoons .",
    "figure  [ fig : seds ] shows that the hiir+dust cocoon model fits the data points well , with the exception of the near - ir filters that are dominated by stellar continuum emission and may contain pah emission at 3.3@xmath14 m .",
    "the radio data provide several constraints on the age and mass of the ionizing stellar clusters within regions a1 and a2 that are illustrated in figure  [ fig : agemass ] . from the radio continuum fluxes",
    "we derive a lyman continuum photon rate q @xmath30 s@xmath18 , which requires at least a certain mass in massive stars and hence an overall cluster mass for a full initial mass function as a function of cluster age @xmath31 ( we adopt a kroupa imf , * ? ? ?",
    "clusters in the m@xmath32 space above the green line in figure  [ fig : agemass ] have enough massive stars to explain the observed q values even if the radio fluxes are underestimates due to self - absorption .",
    "the blue line shows a weaker constraint following the same argument for the bolometric luminosity l@xmath33 of the exciting cluster .",
    "the lack of non - thermal emission at 3 cm implies no observable supernova ( sn ) activity , which excludes the region in m@xmath32 that is inside the red box .",
    "the detection of he  ii 468.6 nm line emission @xcite further restricts the permitted age range for the exciting sources to lie between 3 and 5 ma , as shown by the yellow lines .",
    "finally , a fit to the 3.3 and 4.5 @xmath14 m points in the seds of @xcite models for a range of cluster ages and masses yields @xmath31 and m values that fall on the magenta points , so the allowed cluster parameters are very tightly constrained at @xmath34 ma and m @xmath35 m@xmath2 .",

    "the smaller sh slits are perpendicular to the larger lh ones , title=\"fig:\",width=153 ]",
    "we observed ic  4662 regions a1 and a2 with spitzer irs in both high - resolution ( @xmath36 km  s@xmath18 ) settings : short - high ( sh ) covers about @xmath37 m with a @xmath38 slit , and long - high ( lh ) covers @xmath39 m with an @xmath40 slit .",
    "both slits are shown in both nod positions for each object in figure  [ fig : slits ] on the continuum - subtracted h@xmath13 and @xmath41 m images .",
    "the spectra were reduced and extracted from the full apertures using spice , and background - subtracted using the spot background calculator .",
    "figures  [ fig : spec_sh ] and [ fig : spec_lh ] show the sh and lh spectra , which feature a warm dust continuum , many high - excitation fine - structure lines , a weak pah feature at @xmath42 m but no discernible silicate absorption , and broad h  i humphreys @xmath13 ( hu@xmath13 ) emission at @xmath43 m .",
    "fine - structure lines in the irs spectra make possible the determination of many properties of the gas , dust , and stars within the emitting regions .",
    "we can estimate the extinction by comparing theoretical ratios of fine - structure lines that are well - separated in @xmath44 with the observed values . in this case we used [ ne  iii ] 15.6/36 @xmath14 m , which does not vary substantially over a wide range of expected electron temperatures and densities ( t@xmath45 , n@xmath45 ) .",
    "we thus assume t@xmath46 k and n@xmath47 @xmath6 and use the mid - ir extinction law for the small magellanic cloud of @xcite to derive for a1 ( a2 ) an extinction a@xmath48 mag for a foreground dust screen or a@xmath49 mag for dust mixed with the emitting gas . for either dust geometry , correcting the observed [ s  iii ] 18.7/33.5 @xmath14 m ratio for this extinction leads to n@xmath50 @xmath6 for a1 ( a2 ) , so our initial assumption of a low n@xmath45 gives a consistent result , whereas a higher assumption gives an inconsistent one and [ s  iii ] we are assuming they are co - located , although their ionization potentials do differ significantly . ] .",
    "our fit to the sed (   [ seds ] ) yields a higher n@xmath51 @xmath6 , which might be due to aperture differences between sh and lh slits : the larger area viewed by the lh slit could produce larger fluxes for the lh lines and hence drive down the measured ratio and derived n@xmath45 .",
    "we also note that @xcite reported a high _ gas _ density in warm photo - dissociation regions of n @xmath52 @xmath6 from iso data .",
    "these differing density tracers probe different gas phases that may not share the same emitting volume . here",
    "we adopt a low value of n@xmath47 @xmath6 in order to obtain a lower limit on the extinction .",
    "these values for a@xmath53 greatly exceed those that were determined based on optical spectroscopy by @xcite , who reported a@xmath54 mag from balmer decrement measurements , or even @xcite , who reported a much higher optical extinction equivalent to a@xmath55 mag . both groups used apertures of @xmath56 fwhm , which is comparable with the spatial extent of the sh aperture , which encompasses the bulk of the mid - ir and h@xmath13 emission from a1 and a2 ( figure  [ fig : slits ] ) , so comparison of our data sets",
    "is warranted .",
    "only a mixed dust model can reconcile the low optical a@xmath53 values with the high mid - ir ones .",
    "if the extinction were as low as that inferred from visible wavelengths , the mid - ir line ratios would have the theoretical values .",
    "if the dust were in a foreground screen , the high ir extinction would obscure most of the optical recombination line emission ; however , we detect only about three times the optically - derived lyman continuum flux from mid - ir and radio data , so a screen geometry is ruled out . in other spitzer observations of nearby and hence well - resolved massive star - formation regions , dust has been observed to be mixed with the stars and gas ( e.g. rcw 49 , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "several of the mid - ir fine - structure line ratios that we can measure from the irs spectra are useful excitation indicators for star - forming regions .",
    "for example , starbursts and hiirs form a diagonal band in a plot of [ s  iv ] 10.5/[s  iii ] 18.7 @xmath14 m versus [ ne  iii ] 15.5/[ne  ii ] 12.8 @xmath14 m , where higher - excitation objects have higher values of both ratios ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . with",
    "[ s  iv ] 10.5/[s  iii ] 18.7 @xmath14 m ratios @xmath57 and [ ne  iii ] 15.5/[ne  ii ] 12.8 @xmath14 m ratios @xmath58 , ic  4662 a1 and a2 both fall in the upper right corner of such a diagram , along with other metal - poor wr systems like ngc  5253 and ii",
    "zw  40 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". @xcite also report a very high excitation for ic  4662 based on its [ ne  iii ] 386.9 nm / h@xmath59 ratio , and @xcite report a high effective temperature t@xmath60 k from its uv spectrum .",
    "high excitation is caused by the hard radiation field of the most massive stars that are present in sscs , and we have several handles on the massive star content of ic  4662 s star - forming regions from our data . assuming that the radio continuum flux is due to free - free radiation from hiirs as above , we find q @xmath61 s@xmath18 for a1 ( a2 ) , and from the hu@xmath13 flux we find q @xmath62 s@xmath18 , in reasonable agreement . from these lyman continuum luminosities",
    "we infer that the number of hot stars needed to power the hiirs is @xmath63 o7v stars . from e.g. @xcite it is known that these regions contain wr stars , so using the models of @xcite and starburst99 @xcite we estimate that @xmath64 wrs should be present .",
    "this number agrees with that of @xcite after correcting for the mid - ir - derived extinction .",
    "we calculated neon and sulfur abundances for regions a1 and a2 from the observed fluxes of fine - structure lines relative to that in hu@xmath13 at 12.37 @xmath14 m , following a procedure similar to that used by @xcite , whose irs abundance study of blue compact dwarf galaxies ( bcds ) is useful to compare with ours .",
    "we measured sulfur in two excited states at [ s  iii ] 18.71 @xmath14 m and [ s  iv ] 10.51 @xmath14 m , which we expect to comprise most of the sulfur at such high excitation .",
    "following @xcite we assumed that only 10 % of the total s is in [ s  ii ] , since the typical ionic abundance of [ s  ii ] in bcds is @xmath65 % of that of [ s  iii ] @xcite . for neon we used the fluxes of [ ne  ii ] 12.81 @xmath14 m and [ ne  iii ]",
    "@xmath66 m and made no correction for unseen ionization states .",
    "all of these lines were observed with the same slit ( sh ) as hu@xmath13 so that no aperture corrections are needed , as would be needed if we used the lh detections of [ s  iii ] 33.48 @xmath14 m and [ ne  iii ] 36 @xmath14 m .",
    "the observed fluxes were corrected for extinction using the mixed model results discussed in   [ sec : extinction ] , and the resulting abundances for a1 ( a2 ) are : ne / h = @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) and s / h = @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) . in order to compare directly with the bcds of @xcite",
    ", we adopt their choices for solar abundances of ( ne / h)@xmath71 @xcite and ( s / h)@xmath72 @xcite .",
    "thus in solar units we have ( ne / h ) @xmath73 ( ne / h)@xmath2 and ( s / h ) @xmath74 ( s / h)@xmath2 .",
    "@xcite report a mean ne / h abundance of @xmath75 , which is consistent with our lower limits but nearly a factor of two larger .",
    "we note that the hu@xmath13 is significantly broader than the other nebular lines in the irs spectra .",
    "we investigated whether this broadening could be the direct signature of wr stars via their he  i / ii 12.36 @xmath14 m emission @xcite . however , the number of wr stars needed to explain the putative excess hu@xmath13 flux is far larger than the number of o stars expected to be present .",
    "therefore the cause of the broad hu@xmath13 line remains uncertain .",
    "the relatively weak pah feature at 11.3 @xmath14 m is consistent with the trends found by @xcite for a sample of bcds that have high excitation and low abundance like ic  4662 regions a1 and a2 .",
    "the nearby dwarf irregular galaxy ic  4662 harbors two sites of recent massive star formation that have thermal radio spectra , bright dust and h@xmath13 emission , and rich mid - ir spectra that feature nebular fine - structure lines , a hint of pahs at 11.3 @xmath14 m , and broad hu@xmath13 emission .",
    "our emission - line analysis indicates that this starburst has high excitation and low abundances like many ucd galaxies and in agreement with literature values .",
    "however , we find much higher extinctions ( a@xmath3 mag ) than previous shorter - wavelength studies , which can only be reconciled with the optical observations by a mixed geometry for the gas and dust in these regions . sed fitting of the radio - to - near - ir seds of the udhiis in regions a1 and a2 suggests that they are more evolved toward the ssc stage than similar embedded objects ( e.g. in he @xmath29 and ngc  5253 ) : a1 and a2 have lower gas masses in their hiirs and dust masses surrounding them , and this is consistent with their older ages of about 4 ma , inferred from radio and optical / near - ir data .",
    "the clusters that power the udhiis have masses of about @xmath23 m@xmath2 ( assuming a full kroupa imf ) , but they may not be massive , compact , monolithic sscs like those found in many starbursts , but rather clusters of @xmath76 m@xmath2 clusters that fill a larger volume of @xmath77 pc diameter .",
