    "compact jets of x - ray binaries have an approximatively flat spectral energy distribution ( sed ) extending from the radio to the mid - ir ( e.g. corbel et al . 2000 ; fender et al .",
    "2000 ; fender 2001 ; corbel & fender 2002 ) .",
    "these flat , or slightly inverted , spectra are usually ascribed to self - absorbed synchrotron emission from conical compact jets ( condon & dressel 1973 ; de bruyn 1976 ; marscher 1977 ; konigl 1981 ; ghisellini , maraschi & treves 1985 ) under the assumption of continuous energy replenishment of the adiabatic losses ( blandford & knigl 1979 ) .",
    "the compensation of these energy losses is crucial for maintaining this specific spectral shape . in absence of any additional dissipation mechanism along the jet ,",
    "the flows quickly cools down as it expands and this leads to a strongly inverted radio spectrum ( marscher 1980 ) .",
    "this problem can be avoided by assuming a non - conical jet , but fine tuning of the jet geometry is required in order to produce the observed flat seds ( hjellming & johnston 1988 ; kaiser 2006 ) .",
    "there is also the possibility that x - ray binary jets could be unconfined , then adiabatic losses would be strongly reduced .",
    "falcke ( 1996 , see also falcke & markoff 2000 ) has proposed a freely expanding jet model with negligible radial expansion losses .",
    "however the observational evidence indicates that jets are indeed confined and if this was not the case , the current observational constraints on the jet opening angle in x - ray binaries requires jet lorentz factors greater than @xmath110 ( miller - jones , fender & nakar 2006 ) .",
    "that is much larger than usually believed and also greater than the jet lorentz factor predicted by the model of falcke ( 1996 ) .",
    "this suggests that some form of dissipation occurring at large distance from the compact object does compensates for the adiabatic losses . in conical jets the dissipation rate",
    "must be distributed along the jet and scale like @xmath2 in order to reproduce the flat observed sed ( malzac 2013 , hereafter m13 ) . in phenomenogical jet emission models such a dissipation process is postulated ( blandford & koenigl 1979 ; zdziarski , pjanka & sikora , 2013 ) but the physical origin of this @xmath3 dissipation profile is not treated .",
    "such a dissipation could occur through conversion of either the jet pointing flux , or the jet kinetic energy into internal energy .",
    "lyubarsky ( 2010 ) suggested a mechanism of conversion of pointing flux into internal energy through magnetic reconnection .",
    "the dissipation profile expected from such processes is however difficult to predict and currently unknown .    in this paper",
    "i will instead explore the second possibility , and consider the conversion of jet kinetic energy through internal shocks .",
    "internal shocks models have been proposed to explain the multi - wavelength emission of jetted sources such as @xmath4-ray bursts ( rees & meszaros 1994 ; daigne & moscovitch 1998 ) , active galactic nuclei ( rees 1978 ; spada et al .",
    "2001 ; bttcher & dermer 2010 ) , or microquasars ( kaiser , sunyaev & spruit 2000 ; jamil , fender & kaiser 2010 , jfk10 hereafter ) . in these models ,",
    "shells of gas are continuously ejected with randomly variable velocities and then propagate along the jet . at some point ,",
    "the fastest fluctuations start catching up and merging with slower ones .",
    "this leads to the formation of shocks in which electrons are accelerated up to relativistic energies .",
    "these electrons then produce synchrotron and also , possibly , inverse compton radiation .",
    "a point that has been generally overlooked in all these studies is that the result is very sensitive to the properties of the assumed fluctuations of the lorentz factor of the jet .",
    "recently , m13 showed that the adiabatic expansion losses can be entirely compensated by internal shocks , provided that the fluctuations of the jet lorentz factor correspond to a flicker noise process i.e. with the fourier power spectral density ( psd ) , @xmath5 , of the fluctuations which is inversely proportional to the fourier frequency @xmath6 .",
    "the aim of this paper is to explore the sensitivity of the jet sed to the shape of the psd of the fluctuations as well as to the details of the modelling of the internal shocks . in section  [ sec :",
    "analytic ] , i generalise the analytical formalism of m13 to calculate the shock dissipation profile in the jet and its resulting time - averaged sed for input fluctuations with any psd shape . in section  [ sec : numeric ] , i describe a new numerical code designed to simulate the collisions and shock dissipation in the ejecta .",
    "i also investigate the sensitivity of the results to various approximations in the modelling of the shell collisions . in section  [ sec : results ] , i use both the analytical estimates and simulations to study the response of the jet to sinusoidal fluctuations , and fluctuations with a power - law psd , i also demonstrate the capability of the code in predicting the variability properties of the sources .",
    "consider a jet of time - average bulk lorentz factor @xmath4 .",
    "the jet is modelled as a set of discrete homogeneous ejecta that are ejected at regular time intervals @xmath7 comparable to the dynamical time - scale of the accretion flow ( i.e a few ms ) .",
    "i assume small , time dependent fluctuations @xmath8 of the lorentz factor so that the shell of gas ejected at time @xmath9 at the base of the jet has a lorentz factor @xmath10 .",
    "those ejecta then propagate ballistically along the jet axis . for simplicity , in these analytical estimates",
    ", the mass of the ejecta is assumed to be a constant @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the total kinetic power of the two - sided jets ( hence the factor 0.5 ) and @xmath13 the speed of light .",
    "the effects of a varying mass of the ejecta will be investigated numerically in section  [ sec : shellinjection ] , they are usually weak .",
    "the fourier transform of the fluctuations is defined as : @xmath14 since the lorentz factor does not vary on time scales shorter than @xmath15 , there is a fourier frequency @xmath16 above which @xmath17 . in other words",
    "@xmath18 is the highest possible frequency of the injected fluctuations .",
    "therefore , the initial variance of the injected fluctuations can be written as : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the fourier power spectral density ( psd ) of the fluctuations .",
    "on average the centre of momentum of two neighbouring shells at injection are separated by a distance @xmath21 ( where @xmath22 is the ratio of the jet velocity to the speed of light ) .",
    "this length also corresponds to the smallest scale of the velocity fluctuations . as the ejecta",
    "propagate downstream along the @xmath23 direction , the fastest shells catch up and merge with slower ones . during this process of hierarchical merging",
    "the average mass of the ejecta and their separation will increase @xmath24 .",
    "this growth in length scale implies a damping of the fluctuations of frequencies higher than @xmath25 . as a consequence ,",
    "the variance of the fluctuations decreases :    @xmath26    the problem appears simpler when viewed in the frame moving with a lorentz factor @xmath4 . in the limit of small scales",
    "fluctuations , this frame coincides with the frame of the centre of momentum of the shells .",
    "to first order in @xmath27 , the average velocity of the shells is 0 and its rms amplitude : @xmath28    in the limit of low amplitude fluctuations , the velocities in the moving frame are non - relativistic .",
    "all of the kinetic energy of the shells is available for conversion into internal energy .",
    "after all the fluctuations have been damped , the flow will have received a total energy @xmath29 per unit mass .",
    "the free specific energy of the system ( i.e available for dissipation ) is : @xmath30 then , from equation  ( [ eq : gammadek ] ) : @xmath31    the fluctuations of scale @xmath32 collide and merge after travelling for a time : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a factor of the order of unity accounting for the effects of the longitudinal extension of the ejecta .",

    "@xmath41 is the effective adiabatic index of the flow . for simplicity",
    ", it is assumed here that all the components of the flow ( thermal particles , relativistic particles , magnetic field ... ) have the same adiabatic index corresponding to that of a relativistic gas ( i.e. @xmath42 ) .",
    "neglecting the possible longitudinal expansion losses , the formal solution is : @xmath43^{2\\gamma_a-2}-\\int_1^{k}\\frac{d\\tilde{u}}{dk'}\\left[\\frac{r(k')}{r(k)}\\right]^{2\\gamma_a-2 } dk ' , \\label{eq : evole}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the jet radius after a time @xmath45 .",

    "in this paper we will consider only conical jets : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the jet half opening angle and @xmath49 the radius of the jet at its base .",
    "for a specific psd of the lorentz factor fluctuations , the specific energy profile @xmath50 can be evaluated by combining equation  ( [ eq : evole ] ) with equations  ( [ eq : dusdk ] ) , ( [ eq : tdek ] ) and ( [ eq : rdet ] ) .",
    "a fraction of the internal energy is in the form of relativistic electrons .",
    "another fraction is in the thermal energy of protons , the remaining fraction is in the form of magnetic field energy .",
    "the magnetic field energy density is : @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the equipartition factors related to the thermal energy of the ions @xmath54 , and to the internal energy of the accelerated electrons @xmath55 respectively .",
    "@xmath53 and @xmath52 are assumed to be constant and uniform along the jet .",
    "once the jet geometry is fixed , the average mass density @xmath56 of a shell with radius @xmath44 is given by : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the volume filling factor of the shells .",
    "the volume filling factor of the colliding shells , @xmath58 , is defined so that the average length of a shell of separation @xmath59 is @xmath60 .",
    "if @xmath61 , the jet is constituted of thin colliding ` pancakes ' , while for @xmath62 , the jet is a continuous flow . in principle , @xmath58 depends on the properties of the shells at injection . but",
    "@xmath58 is also expected to depend on @xmath23 ( or @xmath45 ) .",
    "indeed , the shells are strongly compressed during the collisions , then as they gain internal energy they can also expand under the effect of their own pressure .",
    "those effects are fully accounted in the numerical code , while a simple analytical treatment of the dynamic of the shells expansion and compression is proposed in section  [ sec : fc ] ) .",
    "the sed is not very sensitive to @xmath58 and , for the purpose of finding analytical estimates of the sed , @xmath58 is taken to be a constant along the jet , given by equation  ( [ eq : fe ] ) .",
    "the electron energy density is : @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the density and average lorentz factors of the accelerated electrons . for simplicity",
    "i assume that the accelerated electrons have a power - law particle distribution @xmath66 in the range @xmath67 and that the shape of this distribution does not depend on time or position in the jet .",
    "its normalization varies to account for the energy gains and losses of the electrons .",
    "the average lorentz factor of the electrons , @xmath68 is therefore a constant , and only the number of accelerated electrons varies .",
    "a different scenario in which the number of accelerated electrons is kept constant but @xmath65 is allowed to vary is discussed in appendix  [ sec : cnae ] and found to give similar results .    once the average magnetic field ,",
    "internal energy and density profile of the ejecta are determined , the time - averaged synchrotron emission of the jet can be estimated using standard formulae that are detailed in appendix  [ sec : analyticem ] .      in this section ,",
    "i derive simple analytical estimates of the jet volume filling factor . here , as it is customary , i assume that this expansion occurs in the co - moving frame at a speed : @xmath69 as long as the gas is close to equipartition @xmath70 is close to the sound speed and therefore @xmath71 corresponds approximately to the mach number of the colliding shells .    for simplicity",
    ", i consider that the longitudinal expansion is free and therefore the adiabatic losses due to longitudinal expansion can be neglected . any pressure work done during this expansion",
    "can only be used to accelerate or compress neighbouring shells so that overall , this does not represent a loss of energy for the flow .",
    "i thus do not expect that taking these effects into account would change the results dramatically .",
    "the shells can also undergo significant compression during shocks .",
    "when two shells are in the process of merging the compression velocity is simply the difference of velocity of the two merging ejecta @xmath35 . during a collision",
    "however , the compression lasts only for the time necessary for the shock to cross the shell , that is : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the speed of the shock in the frame of the unshocked ejecta . applying the jump conditions of blandford & mckee ( 1976 ) and to first order in @xmath35 , their equation ( 5 ) gives : @xmath74 during an infinitesimal time - interval @xmath75 , the length of a shell @xmath76 changes by an amount : @xmath77 the fist term represents the increase in size of the ejecta due to the mergers .",
    "the second terms is the contribution from compression and expansion which can also be written as : @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the amount of time during which the shell was compressed in the interval @xmath80 . or , equivalently : @xmath81 for simplicity , i approximate the compression factor as : @xmath82 then the @xmath34 parameter in equations  ( [ eq : tdek ] ) and  ( [ eq : dtcsdt ] ) is approximated as : @xmath83 the numerator on the right hand side of equation  ( [ eq : y ] ) accounts for the reduced distance between shells due to their longitudinal extension .",
    "the denominator corrects for the increased collision rate caused by the expansion velocity of the shells . using this expression for @xmath34 , equation  ( [ eq : dfsdt ] )",
    "can then be rewritten as : @xmath84 where @xmath85^{-1}.   \\label{eq : fe}\\ ] ] in the case where the mach number is a constant , it can be integrated easily and one gets : @xmath86 ,   \\label{eq : fvdet}\\ ] ] where @xmath87 is the initial value of the volume filling factor at time @xmath88 when the mach number became a constant .",
    "we can see from equation  ( [ eq : fvdet ] ) that at large times the system evolves asymptotically toward an equilibrium in which @xmath89 .",
    "as can be seen from equations ( [ eq : dfsdt2 ] ) and ( [ eq : fvdet ] ) , the changes in volume factor are driven by the variations of @xmath71 . therefore , if the variations of the mach number are negligible the volume filling factor tends toward a constant @xmath90 given by equation  ( [ eq : fe ] ) .",
    "in fact , the simulations show that the evolution of @xmath58 is more complex , but for the cases investigated in this paper it turns out that assuming a constant @xmath91 leads to a good approximation of the seds .    .",

    "the injected shells are then followed until they interact and merge with other ejecta . during the propagation",
    ", the internal energy of a shell decreases due to adiabatic losses . during the mergers a fraction of the kinetic energy of the shells",
    "is converted into internal energy .",
    "the product of mergers are in turn followed until they interact again , and so on .",
    "the temporal evolution of the initial lorentz factors of the shells injected at the base of the jet is determined according to its specified psd shape .",
    "this code is similar to that described in jfk10 , although developed independently .",
    "the reader is referred to jfk10 for a detailed description of the model and method . here",
    "i will focus only on the main differences between my code and that of jfk10 .",
    "probably the mot important differences regard the treatments of the shell collisions .",
    "let us consider two colliding shells of masses @xmath92 and @xmath93 travelling with lorentz factors @xmath94 and @xmath95 respectively , corresponding to velocities @xmath96 and @xmath97 . the lorentz factor of the merged shell correponds to the lorentz factor of their centre of momentum : @xmath98 this differs from the formula used by jfk10 to evaluate @xmath99 ( their equation 11 ) which is valid only in the ultra - relativistic limit .",
    "the amount of kinetic energy that is converted into internal energy during the collision is then : @xmath100    when two shells collide , a forward shock and a reverse shock form at their interface and then propagate in opposite directions in the frame of the centre of momentum of the shells . their motion is followed in the simulation . as in jfk10 ,",
    "the velocity of the shock fronts is calculated using the jumps conditions of blandford & mckee ( 1978 ) . however , contrary to the model of blandford and mckee ( 1978 ) the shells are in expansion , and in order to approximate the effect on the shock propagation velocity and also in order to keep the shock crossing time finite , it is assumed that the shock front velocity is the velocity used by jfk10 plus the shell expansion velocity . during this process",
    "the shell is gradually compressed , and its length decreases until the shock has crossed the shell .",
    "in contrast , jfk10 considered instantaneous compression i.e. at the time of contact the length of the shell is changed to the size it will have at the end of the compression . the present treatment is more realistic and the compression is gradual .    however , it is often the case that multiple collisions with other shells occur over the shock crossing time .",
    "therefore a shell may be traversed by many shock fronts traveling in different directions in its rest frame .",
    "some shock fronts may encounter other shock fronts . for simplicity and in order to limit the number of shock fronts that are followed numerically , i assume that when two shock fronts meet , the one formed during the earlier collision disappears .    between two events ,",
    "the instantaneous power dissipated at a shock front is assumed to be a constant @xmath101 . where @xmath102 is the remaining energy available for dissipaion in the shock .",
    "and @xmath103 is the dissipation time .",
    "@xmath103 is chosen to be the time before the shock front will reach the outer boundary of the ejecta .",
    "if two shocks meet before reaching a boundary , then the energy of the surviving shock front becomes the sum of the respective energies of both shock fronts reduced by the amount of energy dissipated up to that point : @xmath104 where the indices 1 and 2 refer to the parameters of the younger ( surviving ) and older ( disappearing ) shock front respectively , and the index @xmath105 and @xmath106 denote the properties of the shock before and after the encounter , respectively . @xmath107 and @xmath108 are the time since last update of the shock front energies . @xmath109 and @xmath110 are the energies remaining to be dissipated just after the last update . at the same time , @xmath111 is updated according to its current distance to the shell boundary and the shock front and current boundary velocities .    since the shock fronts that meet each other tend to travel in opposite directions ( in the cm frame ) , transferring the remaining energy of the suppressed shock front to the surviving one leads to overestimate the energy dissipation time .",
    "indeed some residual energy is trapped and may have to cross the shell several times carried by shocks traveling in different directions . to investigate how this affects the results ,",
    "i have implemented another scheme in which all the shock energy is dissipated before it either reaches the boundary , or interact with a younger shock front . in this scheme , @xmath103 is the time required to reach the boundary or encounter another shock , whatever is the shortest .",
    "as soon as , during the shock propagation , something happens to the shell ( e.g. a collision occurs ) , @xmath103 is updated accordingly and @xmath112 is reduced by the amount of energy that was dissipated up to this point .",
    "therefore , in this scheme the energy of a shock is dissipated only during its lifetime . since , for technical reasons",
    ", we arbitrarily make shocks disappear , this method tends to underestimate the dissipation time - scale .",
    "for this reason i call this scheme the ` fast ' dissipation method , and i call ` slow ' dissipation method the scheme described in the previous paragraph .    during the shock propagation and compression",
    "the shells are also expanding radially and loose energy through adiabatic expansion .",
    "the internal energy of a shell with centre of mass initially located at a distance @xmath23 from the base of the jet with an internal energy @xmath113 , traveling with a velocity @xmath114 and which is traversed by shock fronts that dissipate a constant total power @xmath115 , is after a time @xmath15 : @xmath116 x^{2 - 2\\gamma_a}\\ ] ] where @xmath117 .",
    "note that the internal energy in the co - moving frame is @xmath118 . in the simulations ,",
    "the shock energy is dissipated only if the relative velocity of the two shells is larger than the local sound speed .",
    "this is to account for the fact that only supersonic collisions can lead to shock formation and particle acceleration .",
    "however this turns out to have practically no effects on the results because the energy of subsonic collisions is negligible .",
    "the standard method to generate time series with the desired psd is the method of timmer & knig ( 1995 ) .",
    "this method was designed to model power - law noise but is easily generalised to any psd shape . for a process with a given psd , this method allows one to generate a realisation of the fourier transform through a random sampling of the squared amplitude and phase at each discrete fourier frequency .",
    "then , the time - series is generated by applying the inverse fourier transform .",
    "the amplitudes are sampled according to a @xmath119 distribution with 2 degrees of freedom , while the phases are drawn from a uniform distribution .",
    "this method takes into account the full stochasticity of a linear process .",
    "however due to the random sampling of amplitudes , a given realisation may have a power spectrum which differs significantly from that of the parent process .",
    "this may affect the results of the simulation in a way that is uncontrolled . in order to determine the average effect of a process with a given power spectrum",
    "it is often more convenient to fix the amplitude of the realised fourier spectrum to that of the parent process and randomise only the phases ( as done e.g. in done et al .",
    "this is the method that we will use in this paper , although both methods are implemented in the code .",
    "the time - series generated according to these methods have fluctuations that are symmetric with respect to the average .",
    "since we are often dealing with large amplitudes fluctuations , the time series can occasionally take negative values .",
    "this is a problem if the time - series is supposed to represent the evolution of the lorentz factor .",
    "if the number of negative values is small one can just replace the negative values by an average of the neighbouring ( positive ) values .",
    "if the number of negative values is large , another technique consists in generating a time series @xmath120 of desired psd as before but with a mean of 0 . then define the lorentz factor as : @xmath121 where @xmath4 is the desired average value of the lorentz factor and @xmath122 denote the mean value of @xmath123 .",
    "this procedure generates lorentz factors that never fall below unity .",
    "the psd of @xmath124 usually remains very close to that of @xmath120 .",
    "i also note that taking the exponential of @xmath120 makes the time series non - linear ( uttley , mchardy & vaughan 2005 ) .",
    "for this reason , in the following , this method of generating the lorentz factors will be referred to as the ` non - linear method ' while the simple direct method will be called the linear method. in fact the non - linear method is probably more realistic , because non - linearity appears to be a general feature of the variability of accreting black holes ( uttley et al .",
    "for this reason this is the method that is used by default in this paper .",
    "a comparison of the results obtained with both methods will be discussed in section  [ sec : results ] .    in most of the simulations shown in this paper",
    "i assume that the shells are all injected with the same mass . in principle",
    ", their mass could also fluctuate .",
    "besides the case of constant mass injection the code also allows one to simulate models in which the shells are injected with a constant kinetic power , and a third case in which the mass of the shell is variable with the same psd as the lorentz factor but the mass fluctuations and lorentz factor fluctuations are generated independently and are uncorrelated .",
    "these different scenarii will be discussed in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "the time dependent emission of each shell is calculated as described in appendix  [ sec : numem ] .",
    "this treatment of radiation transfer is very simplified and i summarise here the main approximations .",
    "first , the anisotropy of radiation in the co - moving frame of the ejecta is not taken into account .",
    "for example , equation  ( [ eq : inu ] ) neglects the angular dependence of the optical depth .",
    "this is a good approximation only for systems with a large inclination . also , the contribution of each individual active ejecta is computed independently , without taking into account the illumination from its neighbours",
    ". this effect might be important at small jet inclination when the line of sight crosses many ejecta .",
    "moreover , the spatial distribution of particles and magnetic field in the shells are assumed to be homogenous and the electron energy distribution is a pure power - law .",
    "the effects of the thermal component in the electron distribution ( see peer & casella 2009 ) are neglected .",
    "the effects of adiabatic cooling are taken into account by changing the normalisation of the electron distribution while its effects on the shape of the electron distribution are neglected .",
    "the radiation from the surface of the ejecta is assumed to be uniform at all times , the delays due to photons propagation within a shell are not taken into account .",
    "simple estimates , indicate that in cases that are relevant to the observations , these effects alter the sed only marginally .    on the other hand , the effects of radiative cooling can be very strong in the region close to the base of the emitting region ( see e.g. chaty et al .",
    "these radiation losses are neglected in the present version of the model .",
    "they affect predominantly the most energetics electrons , emitting in the optically thin regime , while the flat optically thick part of the sed is essentially unchanged ( zdziarski et al .",
    "2013 ) .    also , only the synchrotron emission is calculated and other processes such as inverse compton emission are neglected .",
    "inverse compton scattering of synchrotron photon or external radiation can be a significant source of gamma - ray emission which i have neglected .",
    "a comparison of the predictions of the internal shock model with observations from high energy instruments such as integral , fermi or hess would certainly put additional constraints on the model .",
    "the treatment of radiation transfer could therefore be improved and this is devoted to future works .",

    "they then continue to expand until they fill the whole volume . as a consequence of the delayed dissipation the specific energy profile rise is smoother than in the previous cases and peaks at about 3 times larger distances , before decaying as @xmath167 .",
    "the delayed dissipation leads to a sed that is slightly shifted toward lower frequencies although quite similar to that obtained in the previous case .    in more realistic simulations",

    "the dissipation profile is now somewhat broader and shifted toward larger distance . but",
    "overall , the specific energy profile and sed remain very similar to what obtained when the dissipation time was neglected . on the other hand ,",
    "the ` slow ' dissipation prescription ( shown in thick dashed curves ) leads to a much broader dissipation profile .",
    "it is formed by a first bump peaking around @xmath178 @xmath174 plus an extension that reaches the maximum distance of a few @xmath179 @xmath174 attained by the shells during the simulation time .",
    "this extension is due to the constant dissipation rate of the shock energy that remains trapped in the shells as a consequence of the ` slow ' dissipation prescription . as a consequence ,",
    "the peak of the specific energy occurs at a longer distance and at a level which is a few times lower than in the ` fast ' dissipation case . as the internal energy is lower , the compression is stronger .",
    "the volume filling factor reaches lower values and does not recover as quickly as before after compression . also , due to the presence of the residual energy dissipation at large distances the specific energy does not decay as @xmath167 but is flat or even slightly rising after @xmath180 @xmath174 .",
    "as shown in panel ( c ) , this causes the sed to flatten at long wavelengths . the sharp drop in flux below 1 ghz",
    "is related to the distance attained by the first ejecta in the course of the simulation time .",
    "interestingly , when the dissipation time is taken into account but the shells are not allowed to compress and expand , the dissipation is even more delayed ( as shown by the thin full and dashed curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : sin ] ) .",
    "this is because , in these cases , the absence of compression makes the dissipation time - scale longer .",
    "regarding the most realistic simulations taking into account both the internal dynamics of the ejecta and the dissipation time scale , the result seem to depend critically on the type of prescription for the dissipation time scale .",
    "the ` fast ' dissipation assumption , which probably underestimates the dissipation time - scale , produces dissipation over a relatively narrow range of distances and the results are in qualitative agreement with the predictions of the analytical model . on the other hand , the ` slow ' dissipation prescription , which overestimates the shock dissipation time - scale , spreads the dissipation over the whole jet extension .",
    "this affects significantly the shape of the predicted sed .",
    "however we will show in the next section that the differences obtained under ` fast ' and ` slow ' dissipation assumptions are strongly reduced if , instead of a simple sinusoidal variation of the jet lorentz factor , one considers a mixture of fluctuations with widely different time - scales and amplitudes .",

    "the associated compression prevents the shells from expanding and filling the entire volume until all dissipation ceases .",

    "the result is not very sensitive to the treatment of shock propagation and the analytical estimate of @xmath58 is reasonably accurate for the purpose of calculating the seds .",
    "the conclusion is that although some assumptions and approximations are required to model the treatment of the shock propagation and energy dissipation in the ejecta and the associated compression , in the case of flicker noise , the resulting seds appears to be rather insensitive to the details of this modelling . in the following",

    "[ fig : varfv ] shows the effects of assuming different volume filling factor of the ejected shells .",
    "it shows that different choices for @xmath185 induce differences in flux of a factor of 2 or more at the higher ( optically thin ) frequencies .",
    "the synchrotron emission is sensitive to the energy density ( in the form of particles and magnetic field ) in the ejecta . since the amplitude of the lorentz factor fluctuations and the mass of the shells are the same in the different simulations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : varfv ] , the energy dissipated in the shocks is the same .",
    "however , in the simulations with lower @xmath185 the first shocks occurs in a smaller volume .",
    "also , due to the smaller scale of the ejecta the energy is dissipated faster and the specific energy rises faster ( see panels a and b ) .",
    "the larger energy density then implies a higher synchrotron flux . nevertheless , after the first shock , the shells are compressed and can also expand .",
    "very quickly the evolution of @xmath58 becomes independent of the initial conditions ( see panel c ) .",
    "the optically thick emissions of the different models shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : varfv](d ) are almost identical .",
    "therefore , the choice of @xmath185 can affect the shape of the high frequency turn - over and the optically thin emission , but has no effects at lower frequencies .",

    "[ fig : linnonlin ] shows the results for the baseline model assuming both linear and non - linear lorentz factor fluctuations .",
    "there are significant differences because , for the moderate jet mean lorentz factor and the relatively large amplitude of the fluctuations that i assume , the linear method implies that many shells have a very small velocity ( as small as zero ) . in the non - linear method such low values",
    "are not allowed and the velocity is almost always mildly relativistic at least .",
    "the length of an injected shell is @xmath186 .",
    "mildly relativistic shells will have a length @xmath187 , but the slow ejecta of the linear model can have a much smaller extension .",
    "those slow shells are quickly hit by other ejecta . as can be seen in panel ( a ) and ( b ) the energisation of the shells start earlier in the linear model and",
    "is more efficient , dissipating a comparatively large amount of energy in a small volume .",
    "the earlier shocks also compress the shells more efficiently ( see panel c ) .",
    "the resulting synchrotron emission ( shown in panel d ) is therefore significantly stronger in the linear model and particularly in the optically thin regime .",
    "interestingly the analytical estimates are in better agreement with the non - linear model ( see m13 for a comparison ) .",
    "this is because the analytical model does not take into account the dependence of the length of the shell on velocity ( the length of each shell is implicitly fixed at the average value ) .",
    "[ fig : linnonlin ] also shows the effects of having randomly variable fluctuations of the mass of the ejecta .",
    "it shows that if the mass fluctuations are uncorrelated to the lorentz factor fluctuation , this has negligible effects on the shape of the sed , both in the linear and non - linear model .",
    "indeed , in this case the mass fluctuations do not change the dissipation profile in the jet .",
    "they just add some variability on the amount of energy dissipated during shocks , but this is averaged out in the time - averaged seds .",
    "the situation can however be very different if the fluctuations of the mass are in some way related to those of the lorentz factor . in fig .",
    "[ fig : linnonlin ] , i considered the case of both variable lorentz factor and mass but keeping the kinetic energy of the shells a constant equal to @xmath188 . where @xmath189 is the constant mass of the shell in the fiducial model . introducing this anti - correlation between mass and lorentz factor",
    "makes the average mass of the shell larger than @xmath189 by @xmath190 in the non - linear model and by 20% in the linear model .",
    "therefore the shock dissipation is enhanced and the jet is brighter . in the case of the non - linear model",
    "this enhancement is weak ( 20 percent at most ) .",

    "shock dissipation leads to a huge energy density .",

    "i would like to illustrate this feature of the model through a single example that may be relevant to the observations .",
    "figure  [ fig:2 ] shows sample light curves and power spectra obtained from the simulation with flicker noise , non - linear jet lorentz factor fluctuations , constant jet power and fast dissipation .",
    "the time average properties obtained for this simulation are shown in fig .  [ fig : linnonlin ] and discussed in section  [ sec : flickernoise ] . for what regards the variability properties",
    ", the jet behaves like a low - pass filter . as the shells of plasma travel down the jet , colliding and merging with each other , the highest frequency velocity fluctuations are gradually damped and the size of the emitting regions increases . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , the jet is strongly variable in the optical and ir bands originating primarily from the base of the emitting region and become less and less variable at longer frequencies produced at larger distances from the black hole .    in this simulation",
    "the amplitude of the variability is large , the frationnal rms amplitude integrated between 0.1 mhz and 50 hz is 1.08 , 0.96 , 0.54 , 0.40 and 0.20 at @xmath269 , @xmath270 , @xmath271,@xmath272 and @xmath273 hz respectively .",
    "the observations also show significant flickering in the infrared and optical band ( kanbach et al .",
    "2001 ; casella et al .",
    "2010 ; gandhi et al .",
    "at least part of this fast ir / optical variability is likely to arise from the jet , possibly through internal shocks .",
    "the observed variability amplitude appears however smaller ( 10 - 30 percent ) than what i obtain here .",
    "this might be due to the presence of a less variable emissions components like the outer accretion disc contributing to the optical / ir observed emission .",
    "nevertheless the shape of the observed ir / optical power spectrum is quite similar to the synthetic one at @xmath274 hz ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] ; see fig 3 of casella 2010 and fig .",
    "11 of gandhi et al .",
    "2010 for comparison )    it is worth noting that the delays due to propagation of radiation inside the shell are neglected in the simulations .",
    "since the escaping radiation is at most partially absorbed , the medium can be considered as optically thin .",
    "the photon escape time is then @xmath275 .",
    "taking into account photon propagation would therefore smear out the variability on time scales shorter than @xmath276 and this may have some effects on the simulated light curves .",
    "however the shortest observed time - scales are related to the shock dissipation time - scale @xmath277 which is given by equation  ( [ eq : tc ] ) . for the parameters considered , the dissipation is significantly longer than the escape time - scale : @xmath278 this approximation is thus unlikely to have any significant effect on the results presented here .",
    "another interesting property of the observed ir variability is the existence of correlations with the fast x - ray variability originating from the accretion flow .",
    "in particular , casella et al . (",
    "2010 ) measured de cross - correlation function of the x - ray and ir light curves and found significant correlations between the two bands with the infrared photons lagging behind the x - rays by about 100 ms . at this stage",
    "the present internal shock model does not describe how the fluctuations of the lorentz factor may be related to the x - ray fluctuations .",
    "nevertheless , we can make simple guesses .",
    "[ fig:3 ] shows the results obtained if one assumes that the x - ray flux scales like @xmath279 .",
    "this case may correspond to a situation in which both the jet and x - ray emission tap their energy from a single energy reservoir and are anti - correlated ( malzac , merloni & fabian 2004 ) .",
    "alternatively , this could also correspond to a situation in which the jet kinetic power is a constant and the lorentz factor fluctuations are related to fluctuations of the matter density in the innermost part of the accretion .",
    "this would induce fluctuations of the jet mass loading , causing a reduction of the lorentz factor when the ejected shells are more massive . at the same time ,",
    "in hot accretion flow models the x - ray flux scales approximately like the square of the accretion flow density , causing the jet lorentz factor and x - ray flux to be anti - correlated . in any case ,",
    "[ fig:3 ] , shows a cross correlation function that is very similar to that observed by casella et al .",
    "( 2010 ) . as can be seen from the inset of fig  [ fig:3 ] , the simulated ir light curves lag by about 200 ms behind the x - rays .",
    "although a detailed modelling of timing data is devoted to future work , it is encouraging to see that this simple model naturally predicts variability properties that are close to those observed in real sources .",
    "in this paper , i have explored the internal shock model for jet emission in the context of x - ray binaries , with an emphasis on the dependence of the time - averaged sed of the jet on the psd of the fluctuations of the jet lorentz factor .",
    "this exploration is based on both a new semi - analytical formalism , and a new numerical code describing the hierarchical merging of the ejecta and their associated synchrotron emission .    for conical jets ,",
    "the observed nearly flat radio to ir seds require electron acceleration and dissipation distributed along the jet over a wide range of distances .",
    "i have shown that , in the context of internal shock models , this implies that fluctuation of the jet lorentz factor have to be injected over a wide range of timescales .",
    "if instead , those fluctuations have a narrow range of time scales , as e.g. the sine fluctuations studied in sec .",
    "[ sec : sin ] , dissipation occurs mostly around one particular distance determined by the time - scale of the fluctuations .",
    "electrons propagating along the jet can be accelerated when they cross this dissipation region , but they are quickly cooled down by adiabatic expansion as they travel away .",
    "this leads to an radio - ir sed that is more inverted ( @xmath280 ) than usually observed in x - ray binaries . obtaining an exactly flat sed in the radio to ir range requires instead that the psd of the lorentz factor fluctuations scales like @xmath281 over a broad range of fourier frequencies .",
    "a steeper psd , leads to more dissipation at large distance from the black hole and a steeper radio - ir sed . on the other hand a flatter psd leads to dissipation closer to the base of the emitting region and the sed is inverted . for a power - law psd of injected fluctuations , i derived simple analytical estimates of the spectral index as a function of the slope of the psd ( see section  [ sec : emprop ] ) .",
    "these analytical formulae are in agreement with the results of the simulations .",
    "i have also shown that the internal shock model predicts a strong , wavelength dependent variability , that is similar to what observed in x - ray binaries .",
    "the variability properties of the model remain to be explored in more details and the detailed modelling of the observed x - ray vs ir fast timing correlations may provide important clue on the dynamics of the coupling between accretion and ejection processes . for instance the preliminary results presented here suggest that on short time scale the jet lorentz factor is anti - correlated with the x - ray luminosity and this could be due to fluctuations of the mass accretion rate on short time scales causing simultaneously a variation of the x - ray luminosity and mass loading of the jet .",
    "this also suggests that the fluctuations of the jet lorentz factor might be related to the observed x - ray variability .",
    "in fact , the formation of jets appears to be intrinsically connected to accretion processes and compact jets are usually believed to be launched from accretion discs ( blandford & payne 1982 ; ferreira et al .",
    "2006 ) . even in the case",
    "when the jet is ultimately powered by the rotation of the black hole ( blandford znajek 1977 ) , an accretion flow is required and most likely drives the fluctuations of the jet .",
    "the variability of the accretion flow in the direct environment of the compact object ( where the jet is also launched ) can be traced through x - ray variability studies .",
    "it turns out that the x - ray power spectrum of x - ray binaries is close to , although not exactly , flicker noise . at low fourier frequencies the power decreases approximatively like @xmath282 while at high frequencies ( @xmath283 hz )",
    "the power spectra often show more complicated structures such as broad lorentzian or quasi - periodic oscillations ( reig , kylafis & papadakis 2002 , 2003 ; gilfanov & arefiev 2005 ; gilfanov 2010 ) .",
    "if this connection between the variability of the accretion flow and the fluctuations of the jet lorentz factor is real , the model predicts a clear relation between the x - ray timing properties and the radio to ir spectral properties of x - ray binaries .",
    "such a connection , which will be explored in future works , could also be used to probe the dynamics of accretion - ejection onto a black hole .",

    "it is interesting to note that there is nothing to prevent @xmath441 from becoming larger than unity for large values of @xmath38 ( associated for example to fluctuations of large amplitude ) . in this case",
    "the jet would be required to be dominated by electron - positron pairs .",
    "fortunately , this situation never occurs in the examples shown in this paper .",
    "nevertheless , the fraction @xmath441 can evolve with @xmath38 from a vanishing number of accelerated electrons to almost 100 percent .",
    "it is not clear whether this is a good prescription .",
    "nevertheless , in order to test the sensitivity of the model to the particle kinetics we can consider a different scenario . in the following ,",
    "i explore what happens if we assume the number of accelerated particles is a constant but their average energy tracks the changes in internal energy .",
    "if the number of accelerated particles is conserved along the jet and neglecting longitudinal expansion , their number density profile @xmath442 depends simply on the geometry of the jet : @xmath443 where @xmath444 is the accelerated particle density at the base of the jet , @xmath445 is the mass density given by equation  ( [ eq : rho ] ) and taken at @xmath296 and @xmath441 is now a constant .",
    "the energy distribution of the accelerated electrons is still a power - law , and i assume that the slope @xmath446 is a constant , but the average energy of the of the particles can change due to changes in the values of @xmath447 and @xmath448 .",
    "however in the limit where @xmath449 , the average lorentz factor of the accelerated electrons is insensitive to @xmath450 : @xmath451 then using equation  ( [ eq : equipart ] ) , one finds that the integral @xmath452 , given by equation  ( [ eq : igm1 ] ) is not a constant anymore : @xmath453 with @xmath454    then by injecting the expression of @xmath455 given by equation ( [ eq : igamma ] ) in equations  ( [ eq : jnu ] ) ,  ( [ eq : kj ] ) ,  ( [ eq : alphanu ] ) , and  ( [ eq : kalpha ] ) , the dependence of the jet emissivity and absorption coefficients on @xmath249 is changed compared to our fiducial model .",
    "this dependence is now : @xmath456 @xmath457 where the constants @xmath458 and @xmath459 are given by equations  ( [ eq : kj ] ) and  ( [ eq : kalpha ] ) respectively with @xmath286 replaced by @xmath460 given in equation  ( [ eq : igamma0 ] ) .",
    "this can be used to compute the jet emission exactly in the same way as before and as described in appendix  [ sec : analyticem ] with the scaling of the synchrotron optical depth , i.e. the @xmath461 and @xmath462 parameters given by equations  ( [ eq : dpar ] ) and  ( [ eq : lpar ] ) , are changed to @xmath463 and @xmath464 .",
    "the slope of the partially self - absorbed region , given by equation  ( [ eq : alphab ] ) , becomes : @xmath465 we see that the dependence of @xmath466 is quantitatively different from that of the model with constant @xmath467 , but for typical values of @xmath46823 this difference is actually small .",
    "also , the cases @xmath469 corresponding in our model to flicker noise power spectrum of lorentz factor fluctuations still corresponds to a flat spectrum . in absence of dissipation ( i.e. @xmath470 )",
    "the slope of the spectrum ( @xmath471 ) is then only slightly more inverted than in the model used in the rest of the paper ( @xmath263 ) .    in the framework of the internal shock model , and for a power - law psd of the jet lorentz factor fluctuations ,",
    "the dependence of the sed on @xmath191 is changed only slightly .",
    "depending on the value of @xmath191 , the three spectral regimes discussed in section  [ sec : emprop ] are still present :    1 .",
    "@xmath218 : the sed can be approximated as a broken power - law with break frequency given by equation  ( [ eq : tnfreq1 ] ) . at @xmath254",
    "the jet emits in the partially self - absorbed regime and the sed can be approximated by the power - law of equation  ( [ eq : fnuinterm ] ) .",
    "the spectral index is given by equation  ( [ eq : alphatconstn ] ) with @xmath470 , this reduces to : @xmath472 above @xmath256 the jet emits in the optically thin regime as given by equation  ( [ eq : fnuopthin ] ) i.e. a power - law with spectral index @xmath257 .",
    "@xmath473 : the index of the magnetic field profile is @xmath474 and the sed can be approximated as a double broken power - law , with breaks at frequencies @xmath261 and @xmath262 given by equations ( [ eq : nus2 ] ) and ( [ eq : tnfreq1 ] ) respectively .",
    "below @xmath261 the flux is given by equation  ( [ eq : fnuinterm2 ] ) and the slope of the spectrum is @xmath471 given by equation  ( [ eq : alphatconstn ] ) . above @xmath261 , according to equation  ( [ eq : alphatconstn ] ) the spectral index is : @xmath475 above @xmath256 the jet emits in the optically thin regime as given by equation  ( [ eq : fnuopthin ] ) .",
    "@xmath476 : the sed is a broken power - law .",
    "the break frequency @xmath262 is given by equation  ( [ eq : nut2 ] ) . at low frequencies",
    "the emission is given by equation  ( [ eq : fnuinterm2 ] ) .",
    "the slope of the spectrum is again given by equation  ( [ eq : alphatconstn ] ) resulting in @xmath477 .",
    "above @xmath256 the jet emits in the optically thin regime as given by equation  ( [ eq : fnuopthin ] ) .",
    "[ fig:8 ] presents a comparison between the analytical estimates of the sed obtained assuming a constant @xmath478 and those assuming a constant fraction of accelerated electrons for the models discussed in section  [ sec : powerlawpsd ] and displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the value of @xmath441 was set to @xmath439 in order to match that obtained in the constant @xmath478 model with @xmath479 .",
    "overall the difference between the two sets of seds are relatively weak .",
    "this suggests that the results are not very sensitive to approximate treatment of the microphysics .",
    "nevertheless , it is worth noting that in this approximation the sed is calculated under the assumption that for each photon frequency @xmath358 of interest , there are accelerated electrons radiating most of their synchrotron radiation around @xmath358 .",
    "the fact that our electron distribution is spread only between @xmath480 and @xmath450 actually introduces additional breaks in the sed . in the model with constant @xmath478 , the choices of @xmath135 and @xmath481",
    "ensure that those breaks occur outside of the radio - ir range . in the constant @xmath441 model , which assumes changes in @xmath480 and @xmath450 , this",
    "is not granted and may introduce some spectral complexity that is not taken into account in the present estimates ."
