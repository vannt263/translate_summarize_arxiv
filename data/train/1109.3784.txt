    "in quantum gravity , the goal is the construction of an internally consistent theory , which can then be tested against experiment . since the typical scale of quantum gravity effects",
    "is generally expected to be @xmath0 , devising doable experiments that test the quantum nature of gravity is highly challenging .",
    "hence it is considerably simpler to _ indirectly _ test quantum gravity : clearly the observed low - energy properties of matter must be compatible with a quantum theory of gravity , if it is to describe our universe . a particular quantity that can be sensitive to quantum gravity fluctuations is constituted by fermion masses . within the standard model , these arise from chiral symmetry breaking ( @xmath1sb ) , either induced by the strong interactions , or by the higgs sector . in a similar fashion",
    ", quantum gravity fluctuations might induce strong correlations in the fermion sector and lead to @xmath1sb . in this case",
    ", the induced fermion masses would naturally be @xmath0 , analogously to qcd , where the fermion masses induced by @xmath1sb are comparable to @xmath2 . since our universe contains fermions which are considerably lighter than the planck scale , we conclude that any viable theory of quantum gravity must evade such a mechanism .    here",
    ", we will show that this requirement allows to put restrictions on quantum gravity theories .",
    "we first investigate generic uv completions for gravity by making use of the framework of effective field theories : irrespective of the uv completion for gravity , an effective parameterisation of quantum gravity fluctuations in terms of metric fluctuations should hold on scales up to a uv scale @xmath3 .",
    "( this allows , e.g. to compute quantum corrections to the newtonian potential , see , e.g. @xcite . )",
    "then the uv completion for gravity determines the values of the couplings in the effective theory on the uv cutoff scale @xmath4 .",
    "a renormalisation group ( rg ) study allows to investigate , whether the predicted values for the couplings are compatible with the existence of light fermions on lower scales .",
    "a parameterisation of quantum gravity fluctuations in terms of metric fluctuations is also central to a specific uv completion for gravity , namely the asymptotic - safety scenario @xcite , where the gravitational degrees of freedom are carried by the metric up to arbitrarily high momentum scales .",
    "the far uv is then dominated by an interacting fixed point in the running couplings .",
    "evidence for the existence of this fixed point has been collected , e.g. in @xcite ; for reviews see @xcite .",
    "the main difference between these two settings is , that in the latter case the requirement of an interacting fixed point determines the uv behaviour at arbitrarily high momenta . in the former",
    "setting , our analysis extends over a finite range of scales , only .",
    "the values of the couplings at the finite uv - scale @xmath4 are then not restricted by a fixed - point requirement , and are determined by the microscopic theory .",
    "within the framework of the functional rg , @xmath1sb is signalled by divergent four - fermion couplings . this connection arises as follows : introducing composite bosonic degrees of freedom , schematically @xmath5 , in the path integral , allows to rewrite a four - fermion coupling @xmath6 . within the bosonic picture , the onset of spontaneous symmetry breaking is signalled by the bosonic mass going to zero . thus @xmath7 signals the onset of spontaneous @xmath1sb in the purely fermionic language , which we will use here .",
    "to investigate , whether the four - fermion couplings diverge , we study their @xmath8 functions .",
    "we use a functional rg equation , the wetterich - equation @xcite for the scale - dependent effective action @xmath9 , which is the generating functional of 1pi correlators that include all fluctuations from the uv down to the infrared ( ir ) scale @xmath10 . at @xmath11",
    ", @xmath9 coincides with the standard effective action @xmath12 .",
    "the scale derivative of @xmath9 is given by @xmath13^{-1}(\\partial_t r_k)\\}. \\label{floweq}\\ ] ] here , @xmath14 ; @xmath15 is the second functional derivative of @xmath9 with respect to the fields , and @xmath16 is an ir regulator function .",
    "the supertrace @xmath17 contains a trace over the spectrum of the full propagator ( for reviews , see @xcite ) .",
    "this equation is exact , and is applicable in perturbative as well as non - perturbative settings , since its derivation does _ not _ rely on the existence of a small parameter .",
    "practical calculations do however usually require truncations of all possible operators in the effective action to a , typically finite , subset .    in choosing an appropriate truncation",
    "it is crucial that we include all four - fermion couplings compatible with the symmetries , since any of these might diverge and induce @xmath1sb .",
    "we thus study a fierz - complete basis of @xmath18 symmetric four - fermion interactions , where @xmath19 is the number of fermions , and @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21,\\\\ \\nonumber \\mbox{where }   v&= & \\left ( \\bar{\\psi}^i \\gamma_{\\mu}\\psi^i \\right)\\left ( \\bar{\\psi}^j     \\gamma^{\\mu}\\psi^j \\right ) , \\quad \\quad a=- \\left ( \\bar{\\psi}^i \\gamma_{\\mu}\\gamma^5\\psi^i \\right)\\left (    \\bar{\\psi}^j \\gamma^{\\mu}\\gamma^5\\psi^j \\right ) . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    generically , the @xmath8 functions of the dimensionless renormalised couplings @xmath22 read @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the fermionic anomalous dimension related to the wave - function renormalisation , see below . herein the first term arises from dimensional ( and anomalous ) scaling and reflects the perturbative non - renormalisability of four - fermion couplings in four dimensions .",
    "the quadratic contributions follow from a purely fermionic two - vertex diagram . a tadpole contribution @xmath25 may also exist , as well as a @xmath26-independent part @xmath27 resulting from the coupling to other fields , e.g. to the metric , thus being decisive for the question of @xmath1sb .",
    "the crucial observation is that whenever fixed points exist , initial conditions for the rg flow can be found such that chiral symmetry breaking is avoided , see fig .",
    "[ fig : parabolasketch ] .     function ( solid blue line ) exhibits two fixed points , the gauian one at @xmath28 and a non - gauian one at @xmath29 .",
    "arrows indicate the rg flow towards the ir , and initial conditions to the left of @xmath30 lead to @xmath1sb .",
    "further interactions can shift the parabola ( red dashed line ) such that no fixed points exist .",
    "such a scenario typically occurs in qcd - like theories @xcite . ]    to evaluate the gravitational contribution to the @xmath8 functions , we include terms carrying dynamics for gravitational as well as fermionic degrees of freedom in the following truncation @xmath31 herein the bare newton constant @xmath32 is related to the dimensionless renormalised newton coupling @xmath33 and we have included a cosmological constant @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath35 denotes a standard gauge - fixing and ghost term in landau dewitt background field gauge , see , e.g. @xcite .",
    "our truncation is motivated by similar truncations in qcd , which allow for a determination of the critical temperature for @xmath1sb @xcite .",
    "the @xmath8 functions for the newton coupling and the cosmological term have been analysed in this truncation ( with @xmath36 ) in @xcite .",
    "the main question is whether quantum gravity fluctuations lead to fixed - point annihilation in the @xmath8 functions . as our main result we observe that this is not the case .",
    "we find that for any @xmath37 the system of @xmath8 functions @xmath38 shows four fixed points ( for details of the calculation , see @xcite ) .",
    "thus metric fluctuations do not contribute strongly to @xmath26-independent terms in eq .",
    ", which could lead to fixed - point annihilation . instead , we find that gravity fluctuations mainly enhance anomalous scaling terms @xmath39 .",
    "thus our first conclusion is that , although gravity is an attractive force , metric fluctuations do not automatically induce strong fermionic correlations and lead to @xmath1sb and bound state formation .",
    "thus @xmath1sb is a question of _ initial conditions _ for the rg flow , cf .",
    "[ fig : parabolasketch ] . here lies the main difference between the asymptotic - safety scenario and other uv completions for gravity : in the former , the system has to sit on a fixed point in the far uv .",
    "if there were no fixed points in @xmath38 , asymptotic safety could not constitute a uv completion for gravity with dynamical fermions . here , we have four fixed points with different universal properties at our disposal , which all define a valid uv completion .",
    "the number of relevant couplings ( connected to the free parameters of the theory ) is either zero , one or two , depending on the fixed point .",
    "thus these fixed points constitute uv completions with varying predictive power .",
    "their existence entails that metric fluctuations do not directly induce @xmath1sb and the scenario is compatible with observations .    in the case of other uv completions for gravity ,",
    "there is no fixed - point requirement , and in fact the initial conditions for the rg flow can lie anywhere in the space of all couplings . here",
    ", the crucial observation is that unbroken chiral symmetry restricts the allowed initial conditions , see fig .",
    "[ effplot ] .",
    "we thus conclude that the existence of light fermions puts restrictions on any uv completion for gravity .",
    "-plane for @xmath40 and @xmath41 . for initial values to the right of the red lines the chiral system is in the universality class of the ( shifted ) gauian fixed point .",
    "any microscopic theory that would put the effective quantum field theory to the left of the red lines would generically not support light fermions ; thus the initial conditions are restricted to lie in the basin of attraction of the gauian fixed point . ]    in conclusion , we have found - within a truncation of the full rg equations - that , although gravity is an attractive force , even strong metric fluctuations do not directly lead to @xmath1sb and bound state formation for fermions .",
    "this result applies to asymptotically safe quantum gravity , as well as other uv completions , where we show that the requirement of unbroken @xmath1sb can be used to restrict the space of couplings .",
