    "in our work we study the system in which two small magnets attached to piezoelastic oscillators are moving in the magnetic field produced by the static magnets attached to the device .",
    "the moving magnets are coupled to each other by an electrical circuit .",
    "the whole device is subjected to vibrations , which are assumed may have a harmonic and stochastic origin .",
    "the schematic diagram of the model is presented in figure [ fig:1 ] .",
    "the moving magnets , characterized by their masses @xmath0 and @xmath1 , are attached to the piezoelastic beams and are separated from the static magnets by an air gap of thickness @xmath2 .",
    "the value of distance @xmath2 is responsible for creating the bistable state of their potential energy .",
    "the masses vibrate in the quasi - horizontal direction described by the variables @xmath3 and @xmath4 , which indicate their displacements from their initial positions .",
    "the distance between static magnets should be large enough to avoid mutual influence of the moving magnets with each other and also avoid the interaction between the moving magnet and the static field acting on the neighboring moving magnet .",
    "the mass disproportion parameter @xmath5 is defined by the relation : @xmath6 .",
    "the stochastic kinetic excitation @xmath7 is applied to the harvester ( we use the notation , where the tilde sign over the symbol indicates the stochastic behavior of a corresponding physical quantity ) .",
    "the energy generated by the piezoelastic beams is received by the resistance @xmath8 coupled with the device by an electrical circuit containing two capacitances @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the electrical circuit can be characterized by the time constant @xmath11 .",
    "the physics of the system is described in terms of the differential equations which couple the mass displacements @xmath3 , @xmath4 of moving magnets , and the voltage @xmath12 induced on the electric load .",
    "the dynamics of the tip mass motion is described by the newton s law    @xmath13    with the equation for the electrical potential @xmath14 @xmath15    where the over - dot sign means the time derivative , @xmath16 is the viscous parameter , @xmath17 is the piezoelectric coupling constant , and @xmath18 is the position to voltage coupling coefficient . the inertial force , @xmath19 , has the following form    @xmath20    where the total amplitude @xmath21 is given by the relation    @xmath22 . \\label{eq:4}\\ ] ]    the stochastic , time - dependent function appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq:4 ] ) is equal to @xmath23 , with @xmath24 being the set of randomly generated numbers ( with mean value equal to 0 , and the standard deviation equal to 1 ) obeying the gaussian distribution .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath25 transforms the system from the non - stochastic regime ( @xmath26 ) to the mixed one ( @xmath27 ) , i.e. when the stochastic excitations are `` added '' to the harmonic ones . the stochastic force presented above can be realized e.g. by considering the periodically moving parts exposed to the random shakes .",
    "for example this can be a situation of the rotating car wheel moving on the uneven road , or the helicopter rotor blades rotating in randomly changing engine conditions .",
    "the angular excitation frequency @xmath28 , and amplitude of excitation @xmath29 are treated for simplicity as the parameters .",
    "we use the standard relation connecting @xmath28 with the applied frequency @xmath30 : @xmath31 .",
    "the potential energy of moving masses appearing in eqs ( [ eq:1 ] ) is given ( after @xcite ) by    @xmath32    the parameters @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 represent the physical properties of piezoelastic beams , and the @xmath2 parameter ( see figure [ fig:1 ] ) is responsible for transferring the system from linear regime ( @xmath36 ) to the bistable regime @xcite .",
    "we perform the computations with parameters used in @xcite , where the corresponding non - stochastic system has been investigated .",
    "the values of parameters used in our model are presented in the table [ tab:1 ] .",
    "lll variable & variable value & variable unit + @xmath5 & 1.0@xmath371.2 & [ 1 ] + @xmath25 & 0.0@xmath371.0 & [ 1 ] + @xmath2 & 5;15 & [ mm ] + @xmath16 & @xmath38 & [ kg / s ] + @xmath17 & @xmath39 & [ n / v ] + @xmath40 & @xmath41 & [ s ] + @xmath8 & @xmath42 & [ k@xmath43 + @xmath18 & @xmath44 & [ v / m ] + @xmath0 & @xmath45 & [ kg ] + @xmath33 & 26.6 & [ n / m ] + @xmath34 & @xmath46 & [ j@xmath47m@xmath48 + @xmath35 & @xmath49 & [ j@xmath47m@xmath48 + @xmath29 & @xmath50 & [ n ] +    we will investigate the influence of stochastic excitations on the output power generated for different values of mistuning parameter @xmath5 . as was shown in our previous paper @xcite , the decrease of the air gap between moving and stable magnets to values less than @xmath51 raises a strong potential barrier which prevents the passage of the magnets through the @xmath52 points , i.e. to another side of the potential well , and",
    "therefore the value of maximum power generated by the device is much smaller compared to the situation , when the magnet can pass the potential barrier .",
    "therefore , in this work we use the values of parameter @xmath53 ( bistable case ) and @xmath54 ( monostable case ) .",
    "we use the set of 100000 random real numbers obeying the normal distribution function .",
    "the set of random numbers , with mean value equal 0 and the standard deviation equal to 1 , presented as the probability density histogram is shown in figure [ fig:2 ] .    in figure [ fig:3 ]",
    "we present the mean power as a function of frequency @xmath30 for different values of mass disproportion parameter @xmath5 and for different values of the @xmath25 factor .",
    "the mean power is given by the relation @xmath55 , where the @xmath56 term is the mean squared voltage generated on the electric load @xmath8 .",
    "as we can see in figure [ fig:3 ] , increasing the @xmath25 factor , i.e. introducing the stochastic behavior of the external force , causes an increase of output power , especially in the low frequency regime .    to compare the efficiency in the broad frequency range for the examples considered , we show in figure  [ fig:4 ] the effective output power as a function of parameter @xmath25 for different values of @xmath5 .",
    "the effective output power is obtained as the average of the mean power over the considered excitation frequencies , @xmath30 , changing from 0 to 15hz .",
    "as we can see in figure  [ fig:4 ] the effective output power grows with increasing parameter @xmath25 for all values of mistuning parameter @xmath5 considered in this paper .",
    "the increase of parameter @xmath5 causes the system to have two resonance frequencies , which are visible in figure [ fig:3 ] .",
    "it also slightly broadens the range of detected power ( see figure 3 ) . on the other hand the total power output decreases with growing mistuning parameter ( see figure [ fig:4 ] ) .",
    "for comparison we present in figure [ fig:5 ] the corresponding results for the parameter @xmath54 , i.e. when the device works in the linear regime ( monostable case ) . in this regime",
    "each moving magnet , shown in figure [ fig:1 ] , has only one stable minimum .",
    "the comparison of effective output power as a function of parameter @xmath25 for different values of @xmath5 for the monostable ( @xmath54 ) and bistable ( @xmath53 ) potential is presented in figure [ fig:6 ] .",
    "as we can see , the results obtained at @xmath54 are qualitatively the same as at @xmath53 .",
    "introducing double minima potential improves the efficiency of the device for almost all considered values of stochastic amplitude @xmath25 but only to a small degree .",
    "the computations in this work were done with the mathematica package .",
    "we used the ndsolve numerical differential equation solver .",
    "the time simulation to reach the self consistent solution was of the order of one hour when the time interval for sampling the solution was divided to approximately ten million steps .",
    "all the average values in numerical integrations were obtained using the monte carlo method with the number of steps in the order of one million .",
    "the random numbers were generated by the random number generator included in the mathematica package ( the same generator was also used in computing the monte carlo integrals ) .",
    "we have examined the energy generated by the energy harvesting device attached to a vibrating source in which harmonic excitations are mixed with the stochastic excitations .",
    "the results we obtained are compared with a purely harmonic case .",
    "the bistability of the system was achieved by the relatively small distance between moving and stable magnets ( @xmath53 ) , so the harvester worked mostly in the unsynchronized regime .",
    "we have analyzed the total mean power generated on the resistance @xmath8 in the function of excitation frequency in the harmonic and mixed stochastic regimes .",
    "the set of initial conditions corresponding to the stable initial positions of the moving magnets at @xmath57 ( i.e. the positions for which the potential energy reaches its minimum ) was used .    at increasing parameter @xmath25",
    "we have observed growth of the generated mean power , especially in the low frequency regime .",
    "it is interesting that the maximum power near the resonance frequency remained unchanged .",
    "the effective output power was increasing with increasing strength of stochastic excitation at all examined values of mistuning parameter @xmath5 which by itself did not increase the efficiency of harvester .",
    "it was shown that the stochastic behavior of the environment improves the efficiency of the energy harvesting device as compared to the harmonic case .",
    "this work was done due to partial support from centre for innovation and transfer of natural sciences and engineering knowledge at the rzeszw university .",
