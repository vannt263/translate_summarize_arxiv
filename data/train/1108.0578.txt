    "<S> it is , however , advantageous to use the formalism of our previous proof as it unveils the nonlocal nature of the part of eve s information which is erased by the channel , and its interconnection with the bi carried by the distribution ( [ pi ] ) . </S>",

    "<S> let us now focus on the remaining variable @xmath103 ( @xmath79 ) which is erased in the proof of the absence of secret correlations across the @xmath75 ( @xmath89 ) splitting . </S>",
    "<S> can honest parties also publicly announce this variable by using only lopc across the splitting ? </S>",
    "<S> if this was the case then it would be possible to create the distribution with gbi ( [ pi ] ) just from secret correlations with respect to the @xmath123 or @xmath124 splitting in the form of the distribution ( [ ptmsv ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , we answer the question in the negative . </S>",
    "<S> namely , the variable can be expressed as @xmath125 where @xmath126 , @xmath127 ( @xmath128 , @xmath129 ) and @xmath130 . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters @xmath131 are given below eq .  </S>",

    "<S> the variable ( [ xej ] ) contains the term @xmath136 involving variables belonging to both parts of the @xmath75 ( @xmath89 ) splitting . </S>",
    "<S> assume , that the variable @xmath103 ( @xmath88 ) is known publicly and the parties share the reduced distribution @xmath137 ( @xmath138 ) , which can be completely created by lopc across the splitting . </S>",
    "<S> the honest parties can then turn the `` nonlocal '' term into ( distillable ) secret correlations by combining locally with respect to the @xmath75 ( @xmath89 ) splitting the variable @xmath103 ( @xmath88 ) with their variables ( see appendix [ appendix b ] for the proof ) . as it is impossible to create secret correlations by lopc the variable @xmath103 ( @xmath88 ) </S>",
    "<S> can not be announced publicly by lopc and private communication across the @xmath75 ( @xmath89 ) splitting is needed for this task .    </S>",
    "<S> we have shown for the distribution ( [ pi ] ) , that although it does not contain secret correlations across a certain splitting , the creation of the whole of eve s information requires private communication across the splitting . </S>",
    "<S> this property obviously can not be obtained by mapping of the type ( [ p ] ) of pure states or classically correlated separable states , which are diagonal in the local product basis @xcite and product in the gaussian scenario @xcite , but one can get it by mapping of some non - classically correlated separable states which is the case of the state used for construction of gbi . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , one can find the property also for some other probability distributions constructed via the mapping of such a state . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite derived from a fully separable state @xcite exhibiting non - classical correlations @xcite , alice and bob do not share secret correlations . </S>",
    "<S> however , to create the distribution alice and bob have to reveal to eve , i.e. , publicly announce , the results of privately tossed , independent fair coins , but only if the results differ . in those cases for which alice and bob do not share their results with eve , </S>",
    "<S> i.e. , their results are the same , a shared secret bit is established between them . </S>",
    "<S> this is clearly impossible with lopc and a private channel is required to decide when to share their results with eve .    _ </S>",
    "<S> conclusions_. we derived a distribution carrying tripartite gbi . </S>",
    "<S> the entire distribution can not be constructed by lopc solely from secret correlations shared by a certain pair of honest parties because the creation of a part of eve s information requires private communication with the third honest party . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , this part of eve s information is found to be inextricably interconnected with the presence of the bi . as a similar nonlocal part of eve s information </S>",
    "<S> can also be traced for some other classical analogs of quantum phenomena , an open question arises about to which extent the interconnection between this information and the presence of the phenomenon is general . </S>",
    "<S> our results reveal the nontrivial nature of the classical information resources needed for formation of some classical analogs of quantum phenomena and show that they are linked to the quantum resources not only in the form of entanglement but also in the form of separable non - classical correlations .    </S>",
