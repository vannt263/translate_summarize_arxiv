    "with the discovery of the 125 gev particle  @xcite at cern in 2012 , and the absence of any other evidence of new physics , together with subsequent data confirming that it is indeed consistent with being the one predicted higgs boson of the standard model ( sm ) , it has become essential to ask the question : is that it ?",
    "after all , the sm needs just the one higgs .",
    "it is capable of doing it all , i.e. gives masses to the @xmath0 and @xmath1 bosons , as well as all the quarks and leptons .",
    "this means that the sm is potentially complete , and there is nothing else fundamental to discover , excepting of course the origins of neutrino mass and dark matter ( dm ) .    on the other hand",
    ", the discovered 125 gev particle may not be exactly the one higgs predicted by the sm .",
    "it may still hold some surprises as its properties are being scrutinized experimentally . on the phenomenological side ,",
    "it opens up the new possibility to use it as a probe of new physics , which is the topic of this workshop . on the theoretical side",
    ", we may want to understand how this one higgs occurs in a natural extension of the sm .",
    "numerous studies have been made on the extensions of the scalar sector of the sm : pacs category 12.60.fr . in particular , two higgs doublet models abound : type i , ii , x , y , etc . in all such cases , the linear combination with @xmath2 gev , i.e. that of the sm , is in general not automatically a mass eigenstate .",
    "another often studied scenario is that of flavor symmetry . to realize such a symmetry in a renormalizable theory , the higgs yukawa couplings @xmath3 , etc .",
    "require that there be more than one higgs doublet .",
    "what if there is only one higgs ? , i.e. a scalar doublet with @xmath2 gev , which is prevented from mixing with any other scalar by an approximate or exactly conserved symmetry .",
    "the former may be realized in a model of of flavor  @xcite for example . here under the symmetry @xmath4",
    ", there are three higgs doublets : @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath4 symmetry breaks softly to @xmath7 , both of which are then also softly broken .",
    "the @xmath8 higgs mediates @xmath9 mixing with a mass @xmath10 tev .",
    "the @xmath11 higgs mediates @xmath12 mixing with a mass @xmath13 tev .",
    "the @xmath14 higgs is almost exactly that of the sm .",
    "there is a unique prediction of this model , i.e. the branching fraction of @xmath15 may be as high as @xmath16 , whereas that of @xmath17 is much more suppressed .",
    "note that @xmath18 has been seen  @xcite with a branching fraction of @xmath19 .",
    "the latter was the inspiration of the scotogenic model  @xcite of radiative neutrino mass ( from the greek _ scotos _ meaning darkness , which identifies this symmetry as @xmath20 for dark matter .",
    "a second scalar doublet @xmath21 and three neutral fermion singlets @xmath22 are added to the sm which are odd under @xmath20 , whereas all other ( i.e. sm ) particles are even .",
    "the complex scalar @xmath23 is split so that @xmath24 .",
    "let @xmath25 , then @xmath26 is a dark - matter candidate .",
    "alternatively , it may be the lightest @xmath27 .",
    "using @xmath28 , the majorana neutrino mass matrix is given by @xmath29.\\ ] ] dark matter is either wimp ( weakly interacting massive particle ) in a freeze - out scenario , or fimp ( feebly interacting massive particle ) in a freeze - in scenario .     symmetry . ]",
    "the higgs connection to @xmath30 bosons is fundamental to the sm and should not be changed . _",
    "question _ : what about its other connections ?",
    "it has already been conjectured that it connects to neutrinos only through dm . why not to ( some ) quarks and leptons ?",
    "this is the subject of my recent paper  @xcite : instead of the higgs boson coupling directly to fermions , a dark @xmath31 symmetry as well as a flavor symmetry ( such as @xmath32 ) are imposed to forbid certain yukawa couplings .",
    "the flavor symmetry is then softly broken and the fermion gets a radiative scotogenic mass in one loop .",
    "the @xmath31 symmetry may also be broken into a residual @xmath20 symmetry .",
    "examples are shown below .",
    "quark mass with @xmath31 symmetry . ]",
    "quark mass with @xmath31 symmetry . ]     symmetry . ]    in these diagrams , there appear the analogs of scalar leptons and quarks as in supersymmetry , but the model is not supersymmetric .",
    "note that @xmath33 is a scalar electroweak doublet , whereas @xmath34 and @xmath35 are singlets .",
    "there is also only one copy of these scalars , instead of three copies in supersymmetry because there are three families of quarks .",
    "the flavor information is carried by the @xmath22 singlet fermions .",
    "the @xmath36 @xmath37 mass matrix softly breaks @xmath32 and its structure is transmitted to the quark and lepton mass matrices through their different couplings to the dark sector . in this way , a unified understanding of quark and lepton mixing is obtained by tracing its origin to the structure of dark matter .",
    "an immediate consequence of this scenario is a possible observable deviation  @xcite of the higgs yukawa coupling of @xmath38 which is well - known to be given by @xmath39 in the sm where @xmath40 gev . in the radiative mechanism for leptons , the doublet @xmath21 and singlet @xmath41 mix through the term @xmath42 , where @xmath43 .",
    "let the mass eigenstates be @xmath44 , and @xmath45 with masses @xmath46 and @xmath47 , then @xmath48 .",
    "let @xmath49 , the one - loop mass is @xmath50     plotted against @xmath51 for @xmath52 and @xmath53 with various @xmath54 . ]",
    "plotted against @xmath51 for @xmath66 and @xmath67 with various @xmath54 and @xmath68 . ]     plotted against @xmath69 with @xmath70 for various @xmath71 . ]",
    "take for example @xmath66 and @xmath67 , then @xmath72 .",
    "for @xmath73 , this yields @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "hence @xmath76 gev for @xmath77 .",
    "the effect on @xmath78 is plotted for various values of @xmath54 in fig .",
    "the charged scalars @xmath79 also contribute to @xmath80 . assuming again @xmath66 and @xmath67 , and also @xmath81 , @xmath82 is plotted against @xmath51 in fig .",
    "if we apply the same procedure to the muon , then @xmath83,\\ ] ] where @xmath84 this is plotted against @xmath69 with @xmath85 for various @xmath71 in fig .  7 .",
    "note that the usual factor of @xmath65 is missing in the denominator , thus allowing for a larger value of @xmath71 to explain the experimental deviation of @xmath86 from the sm prediction .",
    "the dark - matter singlet neutral fermions @xmath22 carry flavor and their mixing pattern gets transmitted to the quarks , leptons , and neutrinos .",
    "since flavor is organized through them , the production of scalar quarks , then @xmath87 with @xmath88 and @xmath89 will result in @xmath90 at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "in contrast , in the minimal supersymmetric standard model , the neutral gauginos do not carry flavor , so the decay of squarks to dark matter will mostly result in 2 jets + @xmath91 ( or @xmath92 ) + missing energy instead . consider the expected 13 tev run at the lhc .",
    "this signature is observable  @xcite with @xmath93 where the sm background is mainly @xmath94 production .     and @xmath95 that could produce a signal - to - background ratio , when compared to @xmath96 decays , larger than 5 in the opposite - sign opposite - flavor dilepton + 2 jets + missing energy signature , under the r2 and r3 cuts . ]     and @xmath95 that could produce a signal - to - background ratio , when compared to @xmath96 decays , larger than 5 in the opposite - sign opposite - flavor dilepton + 2 jets + missing energy signature , under the r5 and r6 cuts . ]",
    "applying the cuts : @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 , we consider four cut regions with @xmath100 gev and @xmath101 gev : @xmath102 the discovery domains in @xmath103 versus @xmath104 are shown in figs .  8 and 9 .",
    "_ question _ what does the one higgs really tell us ?",
    "the answer may be that flavor and dark matter are also connected and they do so through the one higgs .",
    "this new notion extends the scotogenic neutrino mass to all ( or most ) quark and lepton masses , with flavored dark matter . in this framework ,",
    "the new physics scales responsible for dm and neutrino mass are the same , say 1 tev . if so , its impact is verifiable in the near future at the lhc .",
