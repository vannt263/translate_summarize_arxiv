    "in many aspects of the society and the world we live in , network structures are a common occurrence . at the level of their phenomenological description , these networks are very heterogeneous",
    "both in the nature of their nodes and their links and , apart from their very network nature , seemingly have nothing in common",
    ". however , more detailed statistical analysis of various communication , transport , social , biological and other networks have revealed amazing similarities in their statistical characteristics .",
    "these findings , implying the existence of a general underlying organizing principle , have stimulated an entirely new wave of research and have given birth to the field of complex networks @xcite .",
    "the statistical characteristic of complex networks that proved to be the most suitable for demonstrating the common features of very different networks is the distribution of node degrees .",
    "it was found that in complex networks as different as internet @xcite , world wide web @xcite , citations @xcite , scientific collaborations @xcite , metabolic interactions @xcite and many others , the distribution of degrees has a power law character for large values of node degrees , i.e. a power law tail .",
    "this property of the aforementioned networks , which are also referred to as _ scale - free _ networks , was shown to be important in dynamical processes on networks , such as human epidemics and e - mail virus spreading @xcite and resilience to internet attacks @xcite . a deeper understanding and modeling of laws behind",
    "the formation of scale - free networks was clearly necessary .    the first crucial step towards unraveling the principles behind  scale - free \" networks was undertaken by barabsi and albert @xcite .",
    "their model ( in further text referred to as ba model ) is founded on two simple , but essential principles @xcite : network growth and preferential attachment .",
    "the network growth is realized by adding a new node to the network at each time step .",
    "the new node attaches to @xmath2 already existing nodes in the network .",
    "the rule of preferential attachment dictates that the probability of attaching a new node to the existing node is proportional to the degree of the existing node .",
    "these two basic principles are sufficient to reproduce a power law tail .",
    "a host of modifications and elaborations of the preferential attachment rule in the evolving networks followed very soon after the formulation of the ba model @xcite .",
    "these models succeeded in reproducing some of the statistical characteristics of complex networks , such as the power law exponent , in a more realistic manner .",
    "apart from the preferential attachment rule , it is possible to question how other elements of the ba model could be modified to better capture the properties of real world networks . in the process of adding a new node to a very large network ( such as www ) , it is reasonable to expect that only part of information about the entire network is effectively available .",
    "such an assumption is grounded in the fact that nodes usually have a limited processing capability or have ( e.g. topical ) interest only in a part of the network .",
    "it is also reasonable to expect that within the processed part of the network the attachment rule of the new node to the old ones is not completely random , but is preferential .",
    "namely , some of the old nodes are more  appealing \" to the new ones . a reasonable variant which encompasses the aforementioned properties is the filtration of global information @xcite .",
    "in this model of network growth , a new node selects a subset of existing nodes and then applies the rule of preferential attachment to the selected subset .",
    "the principle of selection may be chosen in various ways .",
    "the subset may be formed by randomly choosing a finite fraction or a fixed number of existing nodes @xcite . in the case of the choice of the finite fraction ,",
    "however , the selected subset may become unrealistically large for large networks and moderate fractions .",
    "one can also introduce an additional attribute of every node , and select into the subset only those existing nodes the attributes of which are sufficiently similar to the attribute of the new node @xcite .",
    "this model may , e.g. simulate the attachment to topically similar pages on the www .",
    "the investigation of the model of preferential attachment based on the realistic access to the information on the network structure is also important with respect to the properties of dynamical processes on networks .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that in scale - free networks there exists no threshold for the spreading of epidemics in human society or computer viruses in the internet . the key feature for the nonexistence of the epidemics spreading threshold ( or equivalently , lack of the phase transition )",
    "is the power law tail of the node degree distribution in scale - free networks . in the realistic modifications of information filtering it is reasonable to expect that some of the characteristics of the node degree distribution might change .",
    "one of the aims of this paper is to determine the behavior of the node degree distribution function for large degrees and its consequences for the dynamical processes on networks formed by information filtering .    in this paper",
    ", we study a particular model of information filtering with special emphasis on its theoretical description and tail characteristics . in this model , already introduced in @xcite , a selected subset , which we call the filtration subset , is formed by randomly choosing a fixed number of existing nodes .",
    "we concentrate on the determination of the node degree distribution and approach the problem in two different ways : theoretically , applying the master equation approach of dorogovtsev and mendes @xcite and using computer simulations , in a manner analogous to @xcite .",
    "the results of these two approaches are compared and their agreement discussed in detail .",
    "we start with the discussion of computer simulations of the network growth in our model .",
    "the network grows by addition of one new node at each time step .",
    "each new node connects to the existing network with _",
    "one _ link .",
    "this special choice facilitates the theoretical treatment and ensures a higher level of analytical tractability .",
    "therefore , at the time step @xmath3 , there are @xmath3 links in the network . in every simulation of the network growth ,",
    "a core of the network is initially formed .",
    "the core of the network is formed in a growth procedure where each new node is randomly connected to one of the existing nodes .",
    "the size of the network core is chosen to be larger than the maximal size of the filtration subset that is considered in this paper .",
    "as we consider filtration subset sizes up to 1000 , the network core size is taken to be 1100 in all simulations .",
    "the nodes are numbered starting from 0 , and the network is allowed to grow until the number of nodes , and respectively the number of links , reaches the maximal value @xmath4 , which is generally taken as @xmath5 .",
    "the statistical descriptors of the investigated network are obtained as averages over 100 independent realizations of the network topology .",
    "the stability of the node degree probability distribution was tested by varying the final network size from @xmath6 to @xmath7 .",
    "the simulations with different values of @xmath4 show the stability of the node degree probability distribution for all but the largest node degrees .",
    "the probability distributions are characterized by the exponential cut - off in the tail . for larger @xmath4 ,",
    "the position of the cut - off is shifted more towards larger node degrees , as already found in @xcite .",
    "the stability issues will further be addressed in section [ results ] .",
    "it has also been found that the node degree probability distribution does not depend in any significant way on the choice of the core of the simulated network .",
    "the results of simulations are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the cumulative probability distribution clearly exhibits the power law scaling for a broad range of node degrees and has a rapidly falling tail .",
    "the exponent of the power law behavior of the cumulative probability distribution is close to -2 .",
    "in the theoretical treatment of the node degree distributions we adopt the master equation approach of @xcite    in the type of the growing network investigated in this paper , each node is uniquely identified by the time of its attachment to the network which is hereafter denoted by @xmath8 . in such a framework , we introduce the probability that a node created at time @xmath8 , at some time @xmath3 , where @xmath9 , has the degree @xmath10 and denote it as @xmath11 . the probability that a randomly chosen node has a degree @xmath10 at time @xmath3",
    "is denoted by @xmath12 .",
    "the cumulative probability distribution is denoted by @xmath13 and defined as @xmath14 .",
    "the quantity of interest in our theoretical approach is the probability that the node added at time @xmath3 attaches to the node created at time @xmath8 which at that time has the degree @xmath10 .",
    "the size of the filtration subset is @xmath0 .",
    "the probability that the chosen filtration subset at time @xmath3 contains the node created at @xmath8 with the degree @xmath10 and that the sum of degrees of all nodes in the subset equals @xmath15 is    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the probability that the sum of degrees of @xmath18 nodes is @xmath19 at time @xmath3 .",
    "it is obtained as a convolution of the order @xmath18 of the probability function @xmath20 , i.e.    @xmath21    the expression ( [ 2 ] ) allows us to write equation ( [ 1 ] ) as    @xmath22    this probability of choosing the desired node in a selected filtration subset must be multiplied by the probability of choosing the node created at time @xmath8 from the selected filtration set .",
    "this phase of selection is preferential , i.e. the probability for any node being chosen is proportional to its degree . for the selected subset described above ,",
    "this probability amounts to @xmath23 . with all necessary elements specified",
    ", we can formulate the master equation for the probabilities @xmath11 :    @xmath24    for @xmath25 and    @xmath26    the limits of summation take into account the fact that the minimal degree of any node in the network is 1 .",
    "the term in the upper limit of the summations , denoted by @xmath27 , specifies the maximal value the sum of @xmath18 degrees can have . in the limit of infinitely large networks",
    ", it becomes infinite .",
    "performing index substitutions in the summations on the right - hand side of ( [ 4 ] ) and ( [ 19 ] ) and using ( [ 3 ] ) , we obtain    @xmath28    and    @xmath29    the probability function for the node degree can be further defined in terms of the probability @xmath11 as    @xmath30    furthermore , we introduce a function    @xmath31    which , together with ( [ 10 ] ) , leads to the recursive relations for the node degree probability function :    @xmath32    and    @xmath33    the set of equations displayed so far operates with the time - dependent probability distributions .",
    "as the results of simulations imply , the node degree probability distribution becomes stable when the growing network becomes large enough .",
    "therefore , in further considerations we investigate the stable probability distribution .",
    "this implies that @xmath34 and @xmath35 . for the stable degree",
    "node probability distribution , we have the following relations :    @xmath36    and    @xmath37    the set of equations ( [ 17 ] ) and ( [ 27 ] ) is a complicated set of equations given the fact that the functions @xmath38 depend on the entire probability distribution @xmath39 in a nonlinear fashion . in solving this set of equations",
    "we adopt the following iterative procedure .",
    "the function @xmath38 is calculated using a guess initial node degree probability distribution of the form @xmath40 with @xmath41 ( reminiscent of the albert - barabsi model ) .",
    "the function @xmath38 thus obtained , is further used to recursively calculate the probability distribution @xmath39 from the set of equations ( [ 17 ] ) and ( [ 27 ] ) .",
    "the obtained probability distribution is then used to calculate the function @xmath42 and the entire procedure is repeated until satisfactory convergence is achieved .",
    "the results of the calculations of the theoretical node degree probability distribution show excellent agreement with the analogous results obtained in simulations . in figs [ fig:2a ] , [ fig:2b ] , [ fig:2c ] , and [ fig:2d ] we show graphs of cumulative degree node probability distributions for the values of the subset size @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .",
    "the agreement of the two cumulative distributions obtained by completely different procedures is excellent , except for the largest values of the node degrees .",
    "the disagreement in this area of @xmath10 is attributed to the finite size effects of the cumulative distribution obtained by simulation .",
    "the agreement between the theoretical and simulational cumulative probability distribution is present not only for the linear parts of the graphs in the log - log plots , but also for the curved ones which represent the declination from the power law i.e. the quickly decaying tail .",
    "this fact is especially clear for smaller values of the filtering subset @xmath0 ( see e.g. figs [ fig:2a ] and [ fig:2b ] ) therefore , the theoretical distribution functions are capable of explaining the characteristics of the tail of the cumulative probability distribution @xmath47 .",
    "these findings support the use of the theoretically constructed distributions as predictions of the results that would be obtained in the simulations of larger networks .",
    "the stability of the node degree probability distribution for @xmath48 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : asymptote ] . for larger sizes of the simulated network @xmath4 , the node degree probability distribution approaches more to the theoretically obtained one . from the distributions displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : asymptote ] it is natural to expect that the simulated and theoretical curves will be in full agreement for the infinitely large simulated network .",
    "an analogous behavior is observed for all sample sizes @xmath0 .",
    "the disagreements in the tails of probability distributions between finite size simulated networks and theory are attributed to the finite size of the simulated networks .",
    "inspection of the theoretically constructed cumulative probability distribution shows that this distribution has a tail decreasing faster than the power law which dominates the appearance of the distribution for quite a large number of decades in @xmath10 .",
    "further inspection of these graphs in a linear - log plots reveals the exponential nature of the distribution tails .",
    "let us further examine characteristics of these tails .",
    "interesting information in this direction can be provided by taking into consideration the function @xmath42 appearing in the recursion relation for the probability function @xmath39 . in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] it is clearly shown that @xmath49 is very linear , i.e. the form of this function is    @xmath50    based on this form of dependence of @xmath51 on @xmath10 , we can treat the set of equations ( [ 17 ] ) and ( [ 27 ] ) in a much more analytically tractable fashion . for large values of @xmath10",
    "it is possible to write eq .",
    "( [ 17 ] ) in a continuum approximation as a differential equation    @xmath52    or , equivalently as    @xmath53    the solution of eq .",
    "( [ 31 ] ) is of the form    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is the integration constant .",
    "the cumulative probability distribution , obtained by the integration of expression ( [ 33 ] ) , then acquires the form    @xmath56    the final result demonstrates that the tail of the distribution has the exponential nature which is governed by the value of the coefficient @xmath57 .",
    "the value of the coefficient @xmath58 determines the exponent of the power law part of the cumulative probability function form .",
    "figure [ fig:4 ] , displaying the dependence of the coefficients @xmath58 and @xmath57 on @xmath0 , shows that for @xmath59 , the value of the coefficient @xmath58 lies in the vicinity of 2 , which produces the power law form analogous to the original albert - barabsi power law . the larger the value of @xmath0 , the closer is @xmath58 to the value 2 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath57 falls with the increase of the subset size @xmath0 .",
    "its dependence on @xmath0 is given by the regression @xmath60 .",
    "we see that a simple formula    @xmath61    describes the dependence of @xmath57 on @xmath0 very well .",
    "let us consider this fact in more detail to gain further understanding of the characteristics of the function @xmath51 and its coefficients @xmath58 and @xmath57 .",
    "the convolution function @xmath62 is a rather well localized distribution function , irrespectively of the ( non)localized character of the probability distribution function @xmath39 .",
    "this kind of behavior of the convolution probability function is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : conv ] .",
    "the function @xmath42 can then be written in the form    @xmath63    the convolution probability distribution @xmath62 is localized around its average value , amounting to @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the average node degree in the network . the largest contribution to",
    "the function @xmath42 comes from the interval around the average value of the convolution probability distribution @xmath62 . assuming that the denominator in the sum of the expression does not vary much in the interval where the convolution probability distribution is non - negligible",
    ", we can approximate @xmath2 in the denominator of this expression with @xmath64 .",
    "now it is possible to trivially sum the terms in the numerator to 1 ( since it is a probability function ) and the expression ( [ eq : fmconv ] ) becomes    @xmath66    this chain of arguments validates the expression ( [ eq : fmform ] ) and explains its origin .",
    "it is interesting to note , as specified in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] , that the assumptions introduced in the preceding paragraph work satisfactorily well even for the smallest values of the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated the modification of the ba model with the fixed size filtration subset .",
    "the node degree probability distribution was studied using simulations of network growth and theoretical modeling .",
    "these two approaches yield results for the node degree probability distribution which are in excellent agreement .",
    "the theoretical approach enables one to gain a deeper insight into the characteristics of the distribution .",
    "the cumulative probability distribution has a power law character with an exponential tail .",
    "the power law exponent approaches the ba model value -2 as the filtration subset size @xmath0 becomes larger .",
    "furthermore , excellent agreement of the simulational and theoretical distributions for all node degrees except the largest , enables us to use theoretical distribution in gaining information on the distribution tail beyond information available from simulations which are constrained by the finite sizes of the simulational data sets .",
    "the tail decays exponentially , the decay being slower for the larger values of @xmath0 . more precisely , the exponential factor is of the form @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is a very accurate description .",
    "the results reported in this paper demonstrate the possible mechanism of the realistic access to the network information in the process of growth of the network by preferential attachment .",
    "it is clearly shown how the declination from the concept of the global knowledge of the network leads to the modifications in the node degree probability distribution and how the exponential tail appears .",
    "these results have interesting implications on the problem of epidemics spreading since the exponential tail in the node degree probability function results in the existence of non - vanishing epidemics threshold .",
    "all other dynamic processes on networks that are sensitive to the ( in)finiteness of the moments of the node degree probability distribution are affected as well .",
    "the modification of the preferential attachment rule considered in this paper is just one of the possible elaborations towards the understanding of realistic networks .",
