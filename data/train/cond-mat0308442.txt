    "finite - size scaling has been developed intensively during the last few decades and it has become a standard tool in the studies of critical systems . an interesting application of the method is using the finite - size scaling of the distribution function of the order - parameter fluctuations as hallmarks of universality classes .",
    "the idea goes back to bruce who used it , _",
    "e.g. _ , to verify that the gas - liquid transition of the two - dimensional lennard - jones fluid belongs to the ising universality class @xcite .",
    "the list of applications to thermodynamic critical points is long @xcite and the idea has reemerged in nonequilibrium critical ( or effectively critical ) systems , as well .",
    "the usefulness of scaling functions as hallmarks of universality classes depends on their availability for comparisons .",
    "indeed , a significant portion of the applications is about the ising universality class where the scaling functions for the @xmath4 dimensional distribution functions are well known from simulations and field - theoretic results in @xmath5 are also available @xcite .",
    "the picture gallery of scaling functions is clearly far from complete since these functions have been systematically worked out only for surface growth models @xcite and for gaussian @xmath6 type noise processes @xcite .",
    "an important issue concerning the critical distribution functions is their dependence on the boundary conditions ( bc ) .",
    "while theoretical calculations usually address periodic systems , the building of a histogram of a physical quantity ( _ e.g. _ , the magnetization ) in an experimental system involves measuring the magnetizations in patches of a given size within the bulk of the system ( corresponding to block - spin magnetizations in an ising model ) .",
    "as has been shown by binder @xcite , the block - spin distribution function at criticality depends on the bc on the block , a finding that is not entirely unexpected since the infinite - range critical correlations feel the boundaries of the system .",
    "the bc dependence of the scaling functions is an interesting problem and , indeed , there has been a series of works where the pdf of the magnetization for the @xmath7 ising model at the critical point has been investigated for various bc @xcite including some exotic ones ( mbius strip , klein bottle ) .",
    "similar problems have also been studied for the roughness distribution of @xmath6 type noise processes @xcite .",
    "analytical results about bc dependence of the scaling functions are scarce : they are restricted to gaussian models @xcite , expansions around @xmath8 @xcite and around the spherical limit @xcite .",
    "this is why we decided to revisit the the @xmath9 ising model where the effect of bc can be seen in analytical detail .",
    "although the critical temperature of the @xmath9 ising model is zero , it displays nontrivial features in its finite - size scaling as the critical point is approached .",
    "the particular case of the distribution function of the magnetization in bulk blocks has already been discussed by bruce @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to calculate the scaling function for the case of periodic ( pbc ) , antiperiodic ( apbc ) , free ( fbc ) and block ( bbc ) boundary conditions , and thus gauge the importance of the role played by the bc .    for pedagogical purposes",
    ", we also compute the finite - size scaling of the magnetization fluctuations .",
    "the calculation is elementary in this case and one can easily observe that the periodic , antiperiodic , and free bc yield distinct scaling functions .",
    "furthermore , one can also see explicitly how the scaling function associated with the block bc emerges when a small part of a large system is used for measuring the fluctuations .",
    "the evaluation of the magnetization distribution is somewhat more involved but can be carried out relatively simply by using a combinatorial approach .",
    "for the periodic and free bc , the calculations yield nontrivial functions which are combinations of two delta peaks and a continuum background , with the relative weight of the delta functions reduced for the case of fbc .",
    "the delta functions disappear entirely for antiperiodic bc .",
    "finally , the combinatorial approach reproduces bruce s result for the bbc and it turns out that the block scaling function is identical to that of the fbc case .",
    "we consider the one - dimensional ising chain of @xmath10 spins ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) with ferromagnetic ( @xmath13 ) coupling and with various bc .",
    "the interaction energy of a given configuration of spins @xmath14 is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 for periodic , antiperiodic and free bc respectively .",
    "the model is exactly solvable using , _",
    "e.g. _ , the transfer matrix formalism @xcite , and the partition functions for periodic bc ( upper signs ) and for antiperiodic bc ( lower signs ) are @xmath17 while the correlations are given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 with @xmath20 and , furthermore , @xmath21 .",
    "the above quantities are particularly simple for free bc @xmath22 note that the correlations only depend on the distance of the two spins and not on their particular positions within the chain .",
    "this is true not only in the periodic case but also for apbc and fbc .",
    "also note that the @xmath23 , and @xmath24 superscripts refer to periodic , antiperiodic and free bc respectively throughout the paper .",
    "the mean square fluctuations of the total magnetization @xmath25 can be calculated via the spin correlations as @xmath26 we begin with the discussion of @xmath27 for the periodic- , free- , and antiperiodic bc , leaving the case of block bc for a separate subsection .",
    "substituting the expressions for the spin correlations ( [ pcorr],[fcorr ] ) into eq.([m2gen ] ) , one easily finds @xmath28 in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath29 ) all the above expressions reduce to @xmath30 one can see that the fluctuations diverge as @xmath31 , and they have a power - law singularity provided @xmath32 is used as the control parameter .",
    "one can also read off ( [ m22 ] ) the value ( @xmath33 ) of the susceptibility exponent @xcite .",
    "the correlation - length exponent , @xmath34 , is another exponent needed in finite - size scaling .",
    "it is obtained from the spin - spin correlations which decay exponentially in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the correlation length , @xmath35 , defined by the exponential decay is independent of the bc @xmath36 and diverges for @xmath37 as @xmath38}}\\sim { ( 1-v)^{-1}}=t^{-1 }    \\label{kszi}\\ ] ] thus providing us with @xmath39 . as noted by chen and domb @xcite ,",
    "the above definition of the correlation length ( rather than that found from the second - moment of the correlation function ) is the appropriate one to discuss finite size scaling for this model .",
    "the scaling form one expects in finite - size scaling in dimension @xmath40 is as follows @xcite @xmath41 with @xmath10 being the number of spins .",
    "putting in the above expression @xmath42 , the finite - size scaling suggestion takes the form @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the magnetization density .    dividing both sides of eqs .",
    "( [ m2 ] ) by @xmath10 , we indeed find that @xmath45 yields well defined scaling functions in the limit of @xmath46 while @xmath47 is kept finite .",
    "the scaling variable @xmath48 has a simple meaning since , in the scaling limit @xmath49 _ i.e. _ , @xmath50 is the average number of domains ( or domain walls ) in the system .",
    "the actual scaling functions are given below @xmath51 and they are shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : pfm2 ] . the functions belonging to different bc are clearly distinct thus demonstrating explicitly the bc dependence of the scaling functions .",
    "the scaling functions coincide for @xmath52 .",
    "this is understandable since large @xmath48 means large number of domain walls which means that the disordered regime is approached where the effects of the bc diminish .",
    "the differences in @xmath53 limit can be accounted for by the number of domain walls in the system . in particular , the ground state is completely aligned for pbc and fbc systems while it contains an arbitrarily positioned single domain wall in case of apbc . as a result @xmath54 explaining the values of the scaling functions at @xmath55 .",
    "the small @xmath55 behaviour of @xmath56 can be understood in terms of the smallest energy excitations above the ground states .",
    "these excitations are obtained from the ground state by adding a pair domain walls in case of pbc and apbc , while they consist of a single domain wall for fbc .",
    "their effect is a quadratic ( linear ) decrease of @xmath56 near @xmath55 for pbc and apbc ( fbc ) systems .",
    "we close this section with a note on the speed of convergence of the scaling function .",
    "looking at eq.([m2 ] ) , one can see that @xmath57 converges exponentially to its thermodynamic limit for pbc , while the convergence is only power law @xmath58 for fbc and apbc . as to the scaling function",
    ", it can be easily shown that the convergence is power law @xmath58 even in pbc case .",
    "more precisely , the correction term is of the form @xmath59 where @xmath60 with @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "[ fig : d1m2sc ] displays @xmath63 calculated from eq .",
    "( [ m2 ] ) for the pbc case ( note that for finite @xmath10 and using the scaling variable @xmath48 , the results are meaningful only for @xmath64 ) .",
    "it should be clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : d1m2sc ] that the convergence is slow although it may appear to be quite good at small @xmath48 due to the particular form of @xmath65 .",
    "when studying magnetization fluctuations in an experiment , one usually divides the system into blocks and measures the block magnetizations .",
    "the corresponding theoretical construction in the @xmath9 ising model is to consider a block ( window ) of length @xmath66 at a position @xmath67 in a system of total length @xmath10 , and study the fluctuations of the block magnetization defined as @xmath68 provided the full length of the block is within the system ( _ i.e. _ , it does not contain the boundary with the coupling @xmath69 ) , the correlations entering eq.([m2block ] ) and , consequently , @xmath70 does not depend on the location of the block , @xmath67 , and we can write @xmath71 substituting now the correlations for pbc ( [ pcorr ] ) , one readily obtains an expression which depends both on the block size @xmath66 and the system size @xmath10 : @xmath72 where the superscript @xmath73 denotes the periodic bc . introducing the `` aspect ratio '' @xmath74 , and using the scaling variable @xmath75 , the scaling limit @xmath29 , @xmath76 with @xmath77 and @xmath48 finite yields the following scaling function @xmath78 as one can see , the scaling function goes over into the fbc case if @xmath79 while it becomes the scaling function for the pbc case if @xmath80 .",
    "the function smoothly interpolates between the limiting cases in @xmath81 .",
    "if the block is embedded in a fbc system then @xmath82 can be deduced from the observation that @xmath83 is independent of the system size ( see eq .  [ fcorr ] ) .",
    "namely , @xmath82 must coincide with @xmath84 for the fbc with @xmath10 replaced by @xmath66 .",
    "thus we have a scaling function ( [ m2scaling ] ) which does not depend on the `` aspect ratio '' @xmath77 @xmath85    finally , the fluctuations in a block embedded in an antiperiodic chain , can also be calculated and the somewhat more complicated result has a similar structure as in case of embedding in a periodic chain .",
    "namely , changing the aspect ratio from @xmath80 to @xmath86 , the result interpolates between the apbc and the fbc scaling functions in eq.([m2 ] ) .",
    "the common feature of all the above results is that the bc become irrelevant in the limit @xmath87 where the block is much smaller than the system .",
    "furthermore , we find that this bulk behaviour coincides with the fbc result . whether this coincidence with the fbc result is a general feature of bulk fluctuations is not quite clear and should be investigated in more complicated and higher dimensional systems .",
    "if at a given temperature , _",
    "i.e. _ , at a given correlation length , the system size goes to infinity then the magnetization distribution goes to a gaussian around zero due to the central limit theorem , and goes eventually to a dirac delta function @xmath88 on the other hand , at any given system size as the temperature goes to zero , _",
    "i.e. _ , the correlation length goes to infinity , the magnetization goes to either plus or minus one , and the distribution becomes @xmath89 ~.\\ ] ] the importance of the @xmath90 scaling variable is that if @xmath1 and @xmath31 in such a way that the correlation length is always proportional to the system size ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath48 is a constant ( [ zetaxi0 ] ) ) then a nontrivial distribution arises even for the @xmath9 ising model .",
    "the meaning of @xmath48 suggests the development of a small @xmath48 ( small number @xmath91 of domain walls ) expansion .",
    "thus we shall first calculate @xmath92 , the probability of a given magnetization in the presence of @xmath91 domain walls .",
    "once @xmath92 is known , the probability of a given magnetization @xmath93 can be obtained by summing up @xmath92 @xmath94 the states with @xmath91 domain walls are degenerate as their energy @xmath95 depends only on the number of walls @xmath96 thus , the calculation @xmath92 reduces to counting all possible spin configurations @xmath97 at given @xmath91 and @xmath98 values @xmath99 here @xmath100 is the partition function corresponding to a given bc which , in the scaling limit , becomes @xmath101 for @xmath102 , _",
    "i.e. _ , if there is no domain wall in the configurations @xmath103    for @xmath104 , let @xmath105 be the position of the @xmath106th wall ( say @xmath107 when it is just before @xmath108 ) with @xmath109 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath110 for @xmath111 , and also note that by definition @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "let us denote the magnetization of the domain between @xmath114 and @xmath115 by @xmath116 .",
    "now , it is sufficient to obtain the number of configurations with the restriction @xmath117 and denote it as @xmath118 as @xmath119 note that fixed magnetization also means fixed number of upspins @xmath120 and downspins @xmath121 .",

    "<S> finite - size scaling functions are investigated both for the mean - square magnetization fluctuations and for the probability distribution of the magnetization in the one - dimensional ising model . </S>",
    "<S> the scaling functions are evaluated in the limit of the temperature going to zero ( @xmath0 ) , the size of the system going to infinity ( @xmath1 ) while @xmath2 $ ] is kept finite ( @xmath3 being the nearest neighbor coupling ) . </S>",
    "<S> exact calculations using various boundary conditions ( periodic , antiperiodic , free , block ) demonstrate explicitly how the scaling functions depend on the boundary conditions . we also show that the block ( small part of a large system ) magnetization distribution results are identical to those obtained for free boundary conditions . </S>"
