    "stripe ordering phenomena on the nanoscale seem to be an inherent consequence of electronic correlations in high - superconducting materials .",
    "they are most prominent close to @xmath3 hole doping  @xcite but they were also identified within a broader doping range in the pseudo - gap regime @xcite .",
    "however , the nature of the stripe order varies significantly for different cuprate materials .",
    "unidirectional charge- ( cdw ) and spin - density waves ( sdw ) have been detected in many cuprates by neutron scattering and x - ray experiments @xcite .",
    "however , the details are strongly material dependent .",
    "neutron scattering experiments on la@xmath4nd@xmath5sr@xmath6cuo@xmath7 ( lnsco ) at @xmath8  @xcite revealed static antiferromagnetic ( af ) spin - density wave order with a period of eight lattice constants and a concomitant charge - density wave with half this period .",
    "a similar spin structure was found in la@xmath9ba@xmath6cuo@xmath7 ( lbco )  @xcite , in la@xmath9ba@xmath10sr@xmath11cuo@xmath7 ( lbsco ) ( with @xmath12 )  @xcite , and in la@xmath4eu@xmath10sr@xmath6cuo@xmath7 @xcite , where sdw and cdw coexist at and near @xmath8 .",
    "a common feature of these cuprates is an anisotropic low - temperature tetragonal ( ltt ) phase and , in addition , a strong dopant disorder ; both , the ltt structure and the dopant disorder are supposed to pin stripes .",
    "however , not all cuprates exhibit a ltt phase or dopant disorder .",
    "while every chemical doping of the cuprate parent compounds introduces disorder , its impact on the superconducting properties depend decisively on the distance between the cuo@xmath13 planes and the dopants . in la@xmath9sr@xmath6cuo@xmath7 ( lsco )",
    "dopants are randomly positioned close to the cuo@xmath13 planes generating effective disordered impurity potentials to the in - plane electrons .",
    "in contrast , oxygen dopants order in cuo chains in yba@xmath13cu@xmath14o@xmath15 ( ybco ) that are separated from the cuo@xmath13 planes by a bao plane and they are roughly at twice the distance from the cuo@xmath13 planes than sr is in lsco .",
    "hence ybco is minimally affected by the dopants impurity potentials and is therefore considered as the cleanest material in the cuprate family . in pure lsco , which exhibits no ltt phase , spin stripes",
    "have been detected below @xmath16 , but no cdw order  @xcite .",
    "although no static stripes have so far been reported for ybco , electron - nematic order is inferred from anisotropies @xcite found in neutron scattering @xcite and thermoelectric transport @xcite measurements .",
    "in addition , incommensurate spin fluctuations are detected in superconducting ybco and a static cdw appears in the presence of an external magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "the different behavior of ybco may arise from both the absence of dopant disorder and the ltt structure .",
    "stripe phenomena in cuprates must therefore be considered strongly material specific . here",
    "we present a comprehensive analysis of their delicate response to the presence of disorder .    in the past few years",
    "the theoretical understanding of stripe formation in cuprates has advanced . early on neutron - scattering data on lnsco at",
    "hole doping @xmath8  @xcite suggested the formation of a spin - ladder structure in the cuo@xmath13 planes .",
    "this structure is built from half - filled , three - legged spin ladders , separated by quarter filled chains . the af spin structure changes sign from one ladder to the next , resulting in a wavelength of eight lattice constants .",
    "this same spin structure was later detected also in lbco  @xcite .",
    "indeed , theoretical models based on coupled spin - ladders describe @xcite with some success inelastic neutron scattering data on lbco  @xcite . already before the experimental discovery of stripes , zaanen and gunnarsson  @xcite and",
    "machida  @xcite predicted the formation of spin stripes in doped antiferromagnets from mean - field analyses of the hubbard model .",
    "the spin stripes suggested by tranquada and coworkers were found also in various numerical calculations using the hubbard model  @xcite , the @xmath17-@xmath18 model  @xcite or the spin - fermion model @xcite , and their existence is by now well established .",
    "a more delicate problem is the understanding of the coexistence of or competition between spin- and charge - stripe order and superconductivity . in disordered systems ,",
    "@xmath19-wave superconductivity and antiferromagnetism can coexist  @xcite . on the other hand , within a mean - field treatment of the @xmath17-@xmath18 model and variants of it ,",
    "the above described spin - ladder state was found to coexist with a striped form of @xmath19-wave superconductivity  @xcite .",
    "this superconducting ( sc ) state is modulated in space with the same period as the spin structure ; its sc order parameter is minimal in the center of the af spin ladder and maximal in between the spin stripes .",
    "striped superconductivity in this context corresponds to a unidirectional pair - density wave ( pdw ) state @xcite .",
    "notably this pdw oscillates with twice the wavelength of the accompanying cdw , which is caused by periodic zero - crossings . below we discuss and contrast the pdw with the periodically modulated @xmath19-wave superconductivity ( mdsc ) , which lacks a sign change , thus oscillating with the same wavelength as the cdw .    while the emerging spin order in these models is typically the same in a wide range of parameters for constant hole density , the stability of coexisting spin order and superconductivity varies strongly .",
    "the @xmath17-@xmath18 model displays two distinct limits which have been assessed within a mean - field approach in ref .",
    "@xcite : ( @xmath20 ) the strong @xmath18 limit , referred to as the so - called `` @xmath21-model '' , where @xmath21 parametrizes the attractive nearest - neighbor interaction and represents the dominating contribution to the interaction ( see sec .  [ subsec : vmodel ] ) and ( @xmath22 ) the weak @xmath18 limit .",
    "the latter is well described by a bcs model which includes a repulsive on - site interaction and is appropriately named the `` @xmath23-model '' ( see sec .",
    "[ subsec : umodel ] ) . in both limits ,",
    "spin stripes form .",
    "while in the @xmath21-model the spin ladders are separated by quasi - one dimensional ( 1d )  @xcite , mutually uncorrelated sc stripes , antiferromagnetism is weak in the @xmath23-model and coexists with two - dimensional ( 2d ) superconductivity  @xcite .",
    "the cuprates are estimated to be placed in between the two limits .",
    "some cuprate materials show characteristics which are qualitatively explained by the @xmath21-model , whereas others come closer to the physics of the @xmath23-model . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , for clean systems there is a balance between af and sc correlations in a certain hole - doping range within which specific details matter .",
    "this regime reacts sensitively to dopant disorder and is likely to describe the physics of 214-compounds .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the impact of inhomogeneities on striped superconductors and compare the theoretical results with the experimental observations . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ham ] we introduce the @xmath23- and the @xmath21-models as derived in ref",

    "[ sec : sum ] we summarize and discuss our results .",
    "we follow the general idea that the one - band hubbard model describes well the low - energy physics of the cuo@xmath13 planes of the cuprates , including antiferromagnetism and superconductivity @xcite . at strong coupling , a unitary transformation maps the hubbard model onto the @xmath17-@xmath18 model with an af exchange coupling @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "the non - local interaction in the @xmath17-@xmath18 model accounts for both superconductivity and antiferromagnetism already on the mean - field level @xcite . here",
    "we use an ansatz introduced by kagan and rice , in which the projection to exclude doubly occupied sites is replaced by an on - site repulsion term @xmath25 , leading back to the original @xmath17-@xmath18 model in the limit @xmath26  @xcite . on mean - field level , this ansatz is equivalent to the fully decoupled bcs hamiltonian @xmath27 with attractive nearest - neighbor interaction of strength @xmath21 and an on - site repulsion of strength @xmath23 , if @xmath21 is identified with @xmath18  @xcite . we employ this model on a square lattice including randomly positioned on - site impurity potentials @xmath28 and a perpendicular orbital magnetic field .",
    "specifically the model hamiltonian reads @xmath29 where @xmath30 creates an electron on site @xmath20 with spin @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the hopping matrix elements between nearest and next - nearest neighbor sites are denoted by @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "an electron moving in the external magnetic field from site @xmath35 to @xmath20 acquires the peierls phase @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the vector potential in the landau gauge .",
    "the attractive nearest - neighbor interaction is parametrized by @xmath39 and the chemical potential @xmath40 is adjusted to fix the electron density @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the hole concentration    a mean - field decoupling of the interaction term @xmath43 , leads to the standard term for bcs type superconductivity , plus an af interaction term of the form @xmath44 .",
    "the latter results in an energy gain @xmath21 for two electrons on nearest - neighbor sites with antiparallel aligned spins .",
    "consequently , the system exhibits an af phase above a critical @xmath21 ( @xmath45 ) @xcite . in this regime",
    "double occupancies become very rare .",
    "hence the term @xmath46 is small compared to the @xmath21-term and has no qualitative consequences in this scenario .",
    "this case is represented by the @xmath21-model . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath47 , no af order originates from @xmath21 and antiferromagnetism is controlled by @xmath23 .",
    "this case is adequately depicted by the @xmath23-model  @xcite .      as discussed above",
    ", the interaction @xmath49 is not important for magnetism in the limit @xmath47 , but leads to the standard bcs expression for the sc order parameter .",
    "thus the hartree - fock decoupling of @xmath50 can be restricted to the @xmath23-model : @xmath51 where @xmath52 . in the following",
    "we will focus mainly on hole densities at and near @xmath8 .",

    ", we subdivide the pairing order parameter into three contributions @xcite @xmath61 where the wavevector @xmath62 parametrizes the modulation of the pairing amplitude and reflects a finite center - of - mass momentum @xmath63 of the electron pairs .",
    "@xmath64 accounts for a homogeneous component of the order parameter",
    ". two distinct types of sc states are possible solutions for @xmath65 : if @xmath66 , the sc order parameter shows a stripe pattern modulated with wave vector @xmath62 , where the superconducting stripes are separated by channels of zero pairing amplitude across which the sc order parameter changes sign .",
    "if the absolute values of @xmath67 and @xmath68 are smaller than the homogeneous component @xmath69 , @xmath70 is always finite and modulated with wave vector @xmath71 .",
    "although the `` pure '' pdw with @xmath66 was phenomenologically suggested to be the ground state of striped high-@xmath72 superconductors  @xcite , all calculations of mean - field type so far led to ground states with dominating uniform component @xmath64 , c.f .",
    "@xcite .",
    "for large attractive interactions @xmath45 the hartree - fock decoupled hamiltonian of eq .",
    "is effectively described by the @xmath21-model hamiltonian @xmath74 where @xmath56 is defined as in eq .  .",
    "the term @xmath75 is responsible for antiferromagnetism ; it is controlled by the same interaction parameter @xmath21 as the sc order parameter . since in this limit",
    "af correlations are strong enough to separate the system locally into af regions close to half filling and into hole - rich regions far from half filling , the @xmath23-term contributes little and is therefore omitted from @xmath76 .    for hole doping around @xmath8 ,",
    "the solutions of the bdg equations for @xmath77 in the impurity - free case are very similar to those of the @xmath23-model @xcite .",
    "the main difference is the stronger magnetization of the magnetic stripes in the @xmath21-model . within the af stripes ,",
    "superconductivity vanishes , and the regions with dominant superconductivity are spatially separated into uncorrelated , quasi 1d filaments .",
    "therefore the phase relation between them is not fixed and the `` pure '' pdw state is degenerate to a solution with finite @xmath64 . because of the one - dimensional character of the solutions of the @xmath21-model , they barely adjust to impurities in comparison to the solutions of the @xmath23-model . this characteristic difference is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : v ] .      for a thorough analysis of our results",
    "we also discuss the following momentum space quantities . with the fourier transform of the factorized square of the magnetization @xmath78 we approximate the magnetic structure factor .",
    "in addition we discuss the absolute squares of the fourier transformed @xmath19-wave order parameter @xmath79 and the deviation from the average electron density @xmath80 @xmath81 in the strong disorder limit , the suppression of the electron density at the random impurity sites dominates the charge distribution even for small impurity potentials .",
    "coherent charge oscillations with small amplitudes are therefore barely visible in the fourier transform @xmath82 .",
    "since we are especially interested in these coherent charge modulations we exclude the impurity sites in the presence of strong disorder from the sum over sites in the fourier transformation .",
    "the momentum distribution is given by @xmath83 where the fermionic operators @xmath84 are the fourier transform of the real - space operators @xmath85 .",

    "homogeneous @xmath19-wave superconductors exhibit a finite gap away from the nodes on the brillouin zone diagonals .",
    "@xmath89 is therefore continuous everywhere except across the nodes .",
    "however , stripe formation leads to a reconstruction of the fermi surface attributed to finite pairing - momentum . in this case",
    "the pair density @xmath90 ( eq .  ) is readjusted and , as a result , the superconducting energy gap no longer covers all sectors of the underlying fermi surface .",
    "impurities , on the other hand , induce bound states within the superconducting gap , leading to a redistribution of spectral weight into the gap which can be observed in @xmath88 . in this process the transition from partially filled to empty states in @xmath89 narrows , implicating a partial reconstruction of the fermi surface .",
    "the momentum distribution of the pair density @xmath90 is defined as @xcite @xmath91 it measures the average correlation of the two occupied electron states @xmath92 and @xmath93 and thereby the parts of the brillouin zone where electron pairing occurs .",
    "eventually , we discuss the information contained in @xmath94 on the spin state .",
    "this quantity is maximal in those parts of the brillouin zone where antiferromagnetism dominates .",
    "thus the competition between superconductivity and antiferromagnetism can be analyzed by comparing @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "the hamiltonian   gives rise to unidirectional stripes which have been identified in the real - space quantities of clean @xmath19-wave superconductors above a critical on - site repulsion @xmath98 @xcite .",
    "for a clean ( @xmath99 ) @xmath19-wave superconductor ( @xmath19sc ) the free energy of stripe solutions is typically close to the homogeneous @xmath19sc solutions .",
    "depending sensitively on the initial conditions of the self - consistent bdg calculations we find either stripes or homogeneous af order , both coexisting with superconductivity .",
    "in clean systems , regular stripe solutions emerge only if the self - consistency loop is started from a striped initial state .",
    "however , in the presence of perturbations , such as impurities or vortices , or by a rectangular lattice geometry , stripes are pinned and the stripe solutions become robust against changes of the initial conditions .",
