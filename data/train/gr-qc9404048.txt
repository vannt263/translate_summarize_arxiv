    "in the modern picture of the early universe the exponential expansion period is known to be successful in solving a number of important problems occurring in the standard cosmology . during this inflationary phase , described by de sitter geometry",
    ", quantum field effects played an essential role for subsequent formation of the present universe . in this framework , the knowledge of the corresponding quantum state , originating from planck epoch , is important to reconstruct the phase transitions pattern of the inflation .",
    "one of the possibilities generally used @xcite , @xcite is to consider this quantum state as a de sitter invariant vacuum experienced by a freely moving observer as a thermal bath at the hawking temperature @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "a wider class of quantum states , associated in static de sitter coordinates to a thermal equilibrium at arbitrary temperature @xmath4 , has been investigated in our previous work @xcite . in the present letter",
    "we extend this analysis studying the back - reaction on de sitter geometry in these quantum states .    for simplicity we restrict our consideration to massless conformally invariant scalar theory where the finite temperature green function , globally defined on the whole space - time , can be exactly found .",
    "however , the corresponding renormalized stress tensor for arbitrary temperatures includes a traceless part singular on the horizon surface of two antipodal static coordinate systems , where thermal equilibrium is introduced .",
    "this extremely large energy density implies that , very close to the horizon , physical quantities can be computed only in the framework of quantum gravity , theory which would provide a natural short distance cut - off .",
    "thus , the singular part of the stress tensor can be interpreted as matter distribution sharply concentrated over two spherical shells of radius @xmath5 ( horizon size ) that propagate through the de sitter hyperboloid as light wave fronts .",
    "so far as , apart from the rest space - time , the quantum field inside the domains bounded by the shells is in thermal equilibrium , we will refer to these spherical 3-d regions as _ bubbles _ , that can be characterized by temperature @xmath4 , internal energy , and entropy .",
    "this letter is organized as follows : in section 2 we compute the renormalized stress tensor at finite temperature @xmath6 , and discuss its properties inside and outside the bubbles . in section 3 this tensor",
    "is used to evaluate , in the linear approximation , the back - reaction effects .",
    "the model of the flat expanding de sitter universe is then considered in section 4 to study the cosmological implications of the chosen quantum state . finally , we give our conclusions and remarks .",
    "let us determine the average value of the energy momentum tensor for conformally invariant scalar field theory @xmath7 in static de sitter space , where @xmath8 is the inverse temperature of the system .",
    "this tensor can be decomposed as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the traceless part , and @xmath11 is the local conformal anomaly that does not depend on the quantum state of the system @xcite .",
    "in particular , for de sitter space @xmath12 ( @xmath13 stands for the de sitter radius ) , and due to the conservation law @xmath14 , the traceless part has only one independent component .",
    "consequently , to find all its components it is sufficient to calculate only one of them .",
    "it is worth reminding that static de sitter metric @xmath15 reads @xmath16 where @xmath17 . in this space",
    "the temporal component of the stress tensor @xmath18 can be obtained observing that @xcite @xmath19 the last equation can be also rewritten in the following form @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the inverse hawking temperature .",
    "hence , due to the fact that for @xmath22 the stress tensor is completely anomalous ( @xmath23 ) , we have @xmath24 this enables to obtain the stress tensor in the form @xmath25 that coincides at zero temperature with the known result for the static conformal vacuum @xcite .    as one can see from ( [ eq : stresstensor ] ) the traceless part dominates near the horizon and corresponds for @xmath26 to the energy momentum tensor of a gas of massless scalar particles @xcite . in this case",
    ", the energy density has the usual planck form and results to be @xmath27 where @xmath28 plays the role of a local , redshifted temperature .",
    "the similar structure for the energy density in finite temperature rindler space is given in @xcite .",
    "as we have already mentioned one can interpret the energy singularity as a matter distribution over the surface of two spherical bubbles having the horizon size @xmath5 , and propagating as fronts of light waves .",
    "regions ( a ) and ( b ) represent their internal regions , where the stress tensor has identical forms , ( [ eq : stresstensor ] ) . in the external regions ( c ) , ( d ) the metric ( [ eq : metr ] ) changes to @xmath32 and describes an expanding ( or shrinking ) universe where @xmath33 now plays the role of time and @xmath34 has the meaning of a spatial coordinate . in these case",
    ", the horizon surfaces are removed to spatial infinities ( @xmath35 ) , and the structure of the stress tensor can be found on the base of ( [ eq : stresstensor ] ) .",
    "it follows immediately that in these domains @xmath10 corresponds to a non equilibrium thermal system .",
    "although the energy flows from the infinities ( @xmath35 ) are absent , the energy density decreases to the vacuum one due to the factor @xmath36^{-2}$ ] in according with adiabatic expansion of this universe .",
    "a remark concerning the thermodynamical parameters of the bubbles like their energy , and entropy it is worth being done here .",
    "these quantities can be computed in two ways : through the local energy @xmath37 @xcite , or in terms of the one - loop partition function @xcite .",
    "the first method can not be straightforwardly applied due to the divergence of the local energy and entropy at the horizon , whereas the other one gives a finite answer under @xmath38-function regularization @xcite .",
    "this fact might be understood in terms of renormalization of bubbles surface energy , which can cancel the local divergence . to partially support the above statement",
    "we refer to the analysis carried out for manifolds with conical singularities @xcite .",
    "such kind of defects is inherent to `` gravitational instantons '' associated to static de sitter space ( [ eq : metr ] ) at @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "consider now changing of de sitter geometry induced by the vacuum polarization in the given quantum states .",
    "einstein equations in semiclassical approximation are known to read as @xcite @xmath39 here @xmath40 indicates the solution of ( [ eq : einstot ] ) including quantum corrections @xmath41 to de sitter metric @xmath42 , and @xmath43 is the cosmological constant . as for the additional tensors @xmath44 and @xmath45 that appear due to the quantum corrections , and are defined in terms of the geometrical quantities @xcite , we will neglect them in the further analysis assuming the unknown constants @xmath46 , @xmath8 in ( [ eq : einstot ] ) to be equal to zero .",
    "then , expanding ( [ eq : einstot ] ) up to the first order in the metric perturbation @xmath41 , we have @xmath47    an essential progress in solving these equations can be achieved observing that the anomalous part of the renormalized stress tensor in the r.h.s . of ( [ eq : eins1 ] ) only gives rise to a redefinition of the de sitter radius @xmath13 .",
    "taking into account this trivial effect we can use instead of the total tensor only its traceless part @xmath10 .",
    "thus , after a little transformation , the initial equations take the form @xmath48 where we imposed the gauge conditions @xmath49 , @xmath50 ( the latter is compatible with the dynamical equations and fixes the residual gauge freedom ) .",
    "besides this , the property of de sitter space for which @xmath51 has been used in ( [ eq : eins5 ] ) .",
    "to proceed in our analysis , it is worth reminding that in the given quantum state ( @xmath6 ) the total de sitter symmetry @xmath52 is broken to the subgroup @xmath53 , where @xmath54 stands for de sitter boosts associated with translations along the coordinate @xmath34 .",
    "this enables us to restrict the degrees of freedom of @xmath55 , to the only nonzero components @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 , where the indexes @xmath60 are referred to the @xmath61 coordinates , and @xmath62 is the metric on @xmath63 ( in accordance with ( [ eq : metr ] ) @xmath64 ) .      in the static regions @xmath75 and @xmath76 can be chosen from the condition @xmath77 at @xmath78 that corresponds to the natural assumption for the vacuum effects to disappear in the flat limit @xmath79 , when the background space converts into minkowski one .",
    "as for the external domains , one can require for the perturbed metric to approach the de sitter metric in the limit @xmath80 , where local quantum effects disappear ( see ( [ eq : stresstensor ] ) ) .",
    "the components @xmath81 , @xmath82 , can be obtained from ( [ eq : int ] ) using constraints . on the other hand ,",
    "the non diagonal element @xmath83 , fixed by the condition @xmath84 , turns out to be completely independent of the stress tensor and other components .",
    "for this reason , we put it to be zero everywhere , which inside the horizon can be also justified by claiming its regularity at @xmath78 .      following the previously mentioned requirements , the integration constants @xmath75 and @xmath76 have to be put equal to zero for @xmath86 , whereas for @xmath87 we have @xmath88 .",
    "as far as the value of @xmath76 in the external region is concerned , it is left undetermined .",
    "this fact can be understood reminding that in the approximated approach of semiclassical theory two regions are separated by an infinite barrier , whereas in the correct theory both solutions should be matched at the horizon , so fixing the remaining constant .",
    "note also that solutions ( [ eq : solfin1])-([eq : solfin4 ] ) are valid only in the region where the perturbation expansion is reliable . in terms of the planck length @xmath89 ,",
    "this region results to be @xmath90 .",
    "therefore , if the de sitter radius @xmath91 the present analysis is not applicable to the bubble interior .",
    "finally , we observe that solutions ( [ eq : solfin1])-([eq : solfin4 ] ) of semiclassical einstein equations in de sitter background , can be immediately extended to anti - de sitter space just substituting @xmath13 with @xmath92 .",
    "this is connected to the fact that the renormalized stress tensor at finite temperature in anti - de sitter space has the same structure of de sitter one , once a complex scalar field with neumann and dirichlet boundary conditions for its two independent components is chosen @xcite .",
    "we discuss now the properties of the space taking into account quantum corrections ( [ eq : solfin1 ] ) - ( [ eq : solfin4 ] ) to de sitter metric .",
    "it can be done considering the different models of de sitter space corresponding to flat , open or closed expanding universes . for sake of simplicity",
    "we restrict in this letter our analysis to the flat model , which is generally used for cosmological applications .",
    "a more complete study will be given in a forthcoming paper @xcite .",
    "the corresponding metric has the familiar form @xmath93 ( @xmath94 is the line element on a sphere ) .",
    "this system of coordinates maps only a half of the de sitter hyperboloid . for a more clear representation",
    "we assume it to cover regions ( a ) and ( c ) on figure 1 . in this case",
    ", one of the singularities of the global stress tensor is placed inside the universe ( [ eq : flatun ] ) , in such a way that bubble s center corresponds to the origin of coordinates . at the same time , the other one is at spatial infinity ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "the map between ( [ eq : flatun ] ) and ( [ eq : metr ] ) or ( [ eq : metr2 ] ) can be written as follows @xmath96 note that by definition , the shell of the bubble coincides with de sitter horizon thus its size remains unchanged during inflation , but due to the expansion every point , once inside it , will move away . near the matter distribution surface @xmath97 the metric ( [ eq : flatun ] ) changes to @xmath98 where we introduced @xmath99 instead of @xmath100 to indicate that now it is not the proper time .",
    "the metric perturbations @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 follow from ( [ eq : solfin1 ] ) , ( [ eq : solfin3 ] ) and map ( [ eq : map ] ) , where @xmath100 is replaced by @xmath99 @xmath104 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : flatun])-([eq : solxx ] ) all the functions @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath81 and @xmath65 are supposed to be expressed in terms of @xmath99 and @xmath107 .",
    "so far as @xmath99 does not represent the proper time we need an additional transformation to pass to comoving coordinates ( @xmath108 ) , similar to ( [ eq : flatun ] ) , @xmath109\\equiv d\\tau^2 - \\gamma_{ij}dx^{i } dx^{j } \\label{eq : flatun''}\\ ] ] with @xmath110 , corresponding to @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 respectively .",
    "the above transformation reads @xmath114 and the functions @xmath115 and @xmath116 obey to the following differential equations @xmath117 in terms of these functions the metric corrections @xmath118 and @xmath119 result to be @xmath120 it is worth observing that the integration constant for @xmath116 , obtained from ( [ eq : comov ] ) , is not relevant because it can always be changed by redefinition of @xmath111 coordinate in ( [ eq : flatun  ] ) .",
    "as far as @xmath115 is concerned , its value is fixed , up to an inessential numerical constant , by requiring that metric components ( [ eq : flatun  ] ) depend only on the distance @xmath121 from the center of the perturbation .",
    "the effects of the quantum corrections to the metric ( [ eq : flatun ] ) can be expressed in another way by computing the spatial curvature @xmath128 of the universe ( [ eq : flatun  ] ) @xmath129 @xmath130 remarkably , due to ( [ eq : f ] ) it turns out to be completely independent of the constant @xmath76 and takes the simple analytical forms @xmath131 for inside and outside regions respectively . by definition ( [ eq : defk ] ) of @xmath132 it follows that curvature is negative if the bubble temperature @xmath133 higher then the hawking one @xmath134 , and changes the sign when @xmath135 . moreover , its value at @xmath78 does not depend on time @xmath136 , whereas in external region @xmath137 decreases as @xmath138 .",
    "this long range behaviour of the gravitational field is connected to the massless nature of the chosen scalar field . for massive matter fields one can expect that the gravitational effects will be exponentially smeared , on a length of the order of the inverse mass , outside the bubble shell .",
    "in this letter the local properties of thermal states for a quantum field in de sitter space - time have been investigated .",
    "we interpret the known singularity of renormalized stress - tensor as a matter distribution located on two spherical surfaces ( boundaries of bubbles ) moving far away one from each other .",
    "such domains , characterized by temperature , entropy , and etc . , give rise to a number of semiclassical effects .    to find the gravitational field produced by these perturbations ,",
    "the linearized einstein equations on de sitter background have been exactly solved for stress tensor of a conformal scalar field at finite temperature .",
    "the computations show the gravitational effects are weak far from the bubbles , and in the expanding universe they are exponentially damped .    in realistic cosmological models",
    "both the radius and thermodynamical properties of the bubbles might change during the universe evolution .",
    "note that external region of static coordinates ( [ eq : metr ] ) can be considered as a `` black hole '' absorbing `` information '' from the inner domain due to decays there of unstable field configurations of the higgs scalars . as a result of this process ,",
    "the bubble size , associated to the horizon , grows up and achieves cosmological values determined by the inverse of the hubble constant , @xmath139 at the present .",
    "however , due to the exponential damping , the presence of these inhomogeneous regions does not seem to affect the observable part of the universe , provided if it is far enough from them .",
    "we confine the present letter to these short remarks , leaving more complete analysis of the cosmological aspects of such theory to a forthcoming paper @xcite .",
    "finally , it is worth observing that the solutions obtained for the semiclassical einstein equations in de sitter background can be straightforwardly extended to the anti - de sitter geometry . in this case in fact , the stress tensor has the same structure of the de sitter one , once a complex scalar field with appropriate boundary conditions is chosen @xcite .",
