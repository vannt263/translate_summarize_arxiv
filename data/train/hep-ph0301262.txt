    "we can obtain good information on the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements and cp violation from @xmath0 decays . since the contribution of qcd in @xmath0 decays changes the whole structure of the theory , the study of @xmath0 decays is an intertwined field of particle physics . among these decays ,",
    "nonleptonic @xmath0 decays have been the subject of intense interest .",
    "especially the treatment of nonperturbative effects from the strong interaction is a serious theoretical problem in nonleptonic decays .",
    "precise experimental observation of nonleptonic @xmath0 decays makes it urgent to give firm theoretical prediction including the effects of cp violation .",
    "there has been a lot of theoretical progress in nonleptonic @xmath0 decays and we suggest how to consider nonleptonic @xmath0 decays from the viewpoint of the soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) .    the effective hamiltonian for nonleptonic decays from the standard model has been derived and the wilson coefficients of the operators for @xmath0 decays have been calculated to next - to - leading order , and next - to - next - to - leading order for some operators @xcite . in order to evaluate the hadronic matrix elements of four - quark operators , naive factorization @xcite was assumed , in which the matrix elements were reduced to products of current matrix elements .",
    "but there was no justification for this assumption except the argument of color transparency @xcite . besides that , decay amplitudes depend on an arbitrary renormalization scale @xmath8 in naive factorization since the wilson coefficients depend on @xmath8 , while the matrix elements of operators do not .",
    "ali et al . @xcite",
    "have improved the problem of the scale dependence by including radiative corrections of the operators before taking hadronic matrix elements .",
    "then the @xmath8 dependence of the wilson coefficients is cancelled by that of the radiative corrections of the operators .",
    "however , the decay amplitudes depend on calculation schemes since the off - shell renormalization scheme is used @xcite .",
    "politzer and wise @xcite suggested to take the heavy quark mass limit in computing corrections to the decay rate ratio @xmath9 .",
    "they have considered radiative corrections for nonfactorizable contributions and found that they are finite and the decay amplitudes are factorized .",
    "beneke et al .",
    "@xcite have extended this idea to general two - body decays including two light final - state mesons , in which the decay amplitudes can be expanded in a power series of @xmath10 .",
    "they show that nonfactorizable contributions including spectator interactions are factorized as a convolution of the hard scattering amplitudes with the meson wave functions , and the corrections are suppressed by powers of @xmath10 .",
    "this is an important step toward theoretical understanding of nonleptonic @xmath0 decays .",
    "first the amplitudes can be obtained from first principles and a systematic @xmath10 expansion is possible .",
    "second , since the on - shell renormalization is used , there is no scheme dependence . and they improved previous approaches by including momentum - dependent parts , which had not been included previously .",
    "however , when higher - twist light - cone wave functions are included , there appear infrared divergences in the amplitudes .",
    "these are treated as theoretical uncertainties , but from the theoretical viewpoint it is a problem to be solved in this approach .",
    "bauer et al .",
    "@xcite have proposed an effective field theory in which massless quarks move with large energy .",
    "this effective theory , called the soft - collinear effective theory , is appropriate for light quarks with large energy .",

    "we construct all the relevant operators in the effective theory at leading order in a gauge - invariant way by integrating out all the off - shell modes .",

    "we show that the four - quark operators in scet are factorized to all orders in @xmath1 and the argument of color transparency is explictly shown .",
    "and we consider nonfactorizable spectator contribution in scet , and find that they are also factorized to all orders in @xmath1 .",
    "the basic idea of the factorization properties in @xmath0 decays into two light mesons was sketched in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this paper , we extend the argument and discuss intricate characteristics of scet in nonleptonic decays , the details of the procedure of matching , and present all the wilson coefficients and technical details in the calculation .",
    "we also present the analysis of @xmath11 decays as an application , which is consistent with the calculation in the heavy quark mass limit at lowest order in @xmath1 .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in section  [ sec2 ] , we consider the effective theories @xmath2 and @xmath5 , which we employ in the analysis of nonleptonic @xmath0 decays and explain the field contents and discuss how to match these effective theories . in section  [ sec3 ] , we construct four - quark operators in @xmath2 , which are gauge invariant by integrating out off - shell modes .",
    "this is achieved by attaching gluons to fermion legs and by integrating out off - shell intermediate states .",
    "we discuss the factorization properties of the operators . in section  [ sec4 ] , we match the full theory and @xmath2 and obtain the wilson coefficients of the four - quark operators . in section  [ sec5 ] ,",
    "we consider nonfactorizable spectator interaction , in which subleading operators are enhanced to give the leading - order result .",
    "the structure of the subleading operators and the mechanism for the enhancement are determined by the power counting and the matching between effective theories . in section  [ sec6 ]",
    ", we consider the contributions to the heavy - to - light form factor .",
    "the time - ordered products of subleading operators from the heavy - to - light current and the interaction of an ultrasoft ( usoft ) quark and a collinear quark contribute to the form factor .",
    "in section  [ sec7 ] we combine all the results to apply scet to nonleptonic decays @xmath12 . and finally a conclusion is presented . in appendix",
    "a , we show how the auxiliary field method can be used to derive gauge - invariant four - quark operators in @xmath5 . in appendix b",
    ", we employ the auxiliary field method to derive gauge - invariant subleading operators in @xmath2 .",
    "the formalism of scet and the procedure of the two - step matching are discussed comprehensively in refs .",
    "@xcite and in ref .",
    "we will not discuss them in detail , but we review them briefly here .",
    "the momentum of an energetic quark moving in the light - cone direction @xmath15 can be decomposed as @xmath16 where @xmath15 , @xmath17 are two light - like vectors satisfying @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "there are three scales @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the hard scale .",
    "the momentum squared @xmath24 is typically of order @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is a typical hadronic scale @xmath27 0.5 gev .",
    "we introduce a small expansion parameter @xmath28 to facilitate the power counting .",
    "we construct scet in two steps , namely @xmath29 for @xmath30 , and @xmath5 for @xmath31 .",
    "formally we can construct @xmath5 directly from the full theory , but it is conceptually easy to construct @xmath29 and @xmath5 successively .    in scet , the collinear quarks @xmath32 and gluons @xmath33 have momenta @xmath34 .",
    "there are the soft fields @xmath35 , and @xmath36 , with momenta @xmath37 , and the usoft fields @xmath38 , @xmath39 with momenta @xmath40 .",
    "the collinear quarks interact with collinear gluons or usoft gluons , but not with soft gluons since they make collinear particles or heavy quarks off the mass shell . in order to derive the power counting method in @xmath2 , we move all the dependence on @xmath41 to the interaction vertices , and determine the @xmath41 dependence of all the fields @xcite",
    ". then we can construct all the operators in powers of @xmath41 systematically by integrating out the off - shell modes of order @xmath23 .",
    "the guiding principles of constructing operators in scet are gauge invariance @xcite , reparameterization invariance @xcite and the power counting @xcite .",
    "the wilson coefficients of the operators can be obtained through the matching between the full theory and @xmath2 by requiring that the matrix elements of operators in both theories be the same at any order of the perturbation theory .",
    "there is no mixing of operators with different powers of @xmath41 through radiative corrections as long as @xmath42 since the matching is performed perturbatively .    in @xmath5 for @xmath43 , we integrate out all the off - shell modes of order @xmath44 .",
    "then the collinear fields in @xmath5 have momenta @xmath45 , and the soft degrees of freedom have momenta @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is a new small expansion parameter in @xmath5 . here",
    "the collinear modes have momenta @xmath48 , which is appropriate to describe hadrons of size @xmath49 .",
    "the degrees of freedom of order @xmath50 in @xmath2 are all integrated out , and the usoft degrees of freedom in @xmath2 of order @xmath51 remain in @xmath5 with momentum @xmath52 , and we call them soft degrees of freedom in @xmath5 .",
    "the matching of @xmath2 onto @xmath5 is performed at @xmath53 .",
    "a subtle technical point in matching is to require gauge invariance . in order to see how to keep the gauge invariance ,",
    "let us consider a simple example of a heavy - to - light current . in the full theory the current @xmath54",
    "is matched to the operator in @xmath2 as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the wilson coefficient , and @xmath57 is the label momentum operator .",
    "the factor @xmath58 is the wilson line which is given by @xmath59.\\ ] ] this wilson line is obtained by attaching collinear gluons to the heavy quark and integrate out the off - shell modes of the intermediate states of order @xmath23 . in @xmath5 , the emission of soft gluons @xmath60 makes the collinear fields off the mass shell and we have to integrate out the off - shell modes .",
    "this is achieved by attaching usoft gluons to external fermion lines in @xmath2 and by integrating out the off - shell modes of order @xmath61 .",
    "it corresponds to factorizing the usoft - collinear interactions with the field redefinition @xcite @xmath62 the collinear effective lagrangian can be written in terms of @xmath63 and @xmath64 , that is , the collinear - usoft interactions are factorized with the field redefinitions given in eq .",
    "( [ redef1 ] )",
    ". then we match @xmath2 onto @xmath5 at a scale @xmath65 .",
    "for example , the heavy - to - light current is matched as @xmath66 where @xmath67 . in @xmath5 ,",
    "the fields with the superscript @xmath68 are fundamental objects .",
    "we rename the usoft field as the soft field in @xmath5 .",
    "we write @xmath69 , and lower the off - shellness of the collinear fields .    since the leading collinear lagrangian is the same in @xmath2 and @xmath5 , we can simply replace @xmath70 , and we obtain the final form of the operator @xmath71 where the superscript @xmath72 , which denotes @xmath5 , will be dropped from now on . from the two - step matching , it is clear why the wilson coefficients do not depend on the soft momentum .",
    "the advantage of the two - step matching is manifest when we consider time - ordered products in @xmath2 since these can induce jet functions involving the fluctuations of order @xmath73 . in @xmath2",
    "we can compute the jet functions with a well - defined set of feynman rules independent of the computation of the wilson coefficients at @xmath74 . and",
    "the scaling of operators in @xmath5 is constrained by the power counting in @xmath2 and especially , @xmath2 puts a constraint of the number of factors of @xmath75 , which can be induced from the fluctuations @xmath76 .",
    "therefore we can know how many powers of @xmath76 appear for a given process at a given order in @xmath1 , and this power counting is not spoiled by the loop effects since there is no dependence on the soft momentum in the wilson coefficients .",
    "this feature will be seen explicitly when we evaluate the decay amplitudes of nonleptonic decays which involve time - ordered products .    in nonleptonic",
    "decays into two light mesons , there are collinear quarks moving in opposite directions .",
    "we choose these two directions as @xmath15 and @xmath17 . for an energetic quark moving in the @xmath17 direction ,",
    "the momentum is decomposed as @xmath77 we denote a collinear quark by @xmath32 ( @xmath78 ) which moves in the @xmath15 ( @xmath17 ) direction .",
    "these fields satisfy the relations @xmath79 the collinear gauge field in the @xmath15 ( @xmath17 ) direction is written as @xmath33 ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "the effective lagrangian for @xmath78 and @xmath80 , which can be obtained from the colllinear lagrangian for @xmath32 and @xmath33 by replacing @xmath81 , @xmath82 respectively .",
    "this situation is simlar to two jets in the opposite direction @xcite , but we have a heavy quark interacting with collinear gluons in both directions , which makes the analysis more interesting and complicated .",
    "the effective hamiltonian for @xmath0 decays in the full theory is given as @xmath83 where the local @xmath84 operators are given by @xmath85 here @xmath86 and @xmath87 denotes down - type quarks , @xmath88 is the chromomagnetic field strength tensor , and @xmath89 are the color @xmath90 generators .",
    "the process of obtaining the gauge - invariant operators in scet requires two - step matching @xcite because the scet involves two different scales @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "first we match the full theory onto @xmath2 at @xmath93 , and we match successively onto @xmath5 at @xmath94 .",
    "a concrete example of the two - step matching was illustrated in ref .",
    "@xcite . in order to construct the operators in scet",
    ", we first have to specify which quark or antiquark goes to a certain direction to form a light meson .",
    "we set @xmath17 as the direction of a quark - antiquark pair to form a light meson , and @xmath15 as the direction of the remaining quark which combines with a spectator quark in a @xmath0 meson to form another meson .",
    "therefore the construction of the operators is process - dependent in the sense that we first specify the direction of each outgoing quark , and the number of operators in scet is doubled because we have two possibilities to assign two quark fields in both directions .",
    "a generic four - quark operator for nonleptonic @xmath0 decays in scet has the form @xmath95 , or @xmath96 , where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are dirac matrices , and @xmath99 is the heavy quark field in the heavy quark effective theory .",
    "these operators are derived from the operator @xmath100 in the full theory where @xmath101 ( @xmath102 ) are light quarks .",
    "the operator @xmath103 is obtained by replacing @xmath104 by @xmath32 , and @xmath105 and @xmath106 by @xmath78 . for the operator @xmath107 ,",
    "we replace @xmath105 by @xmath32 and @xmath104 and @xmath106 by the @xmath78 fields .",
    "the second operator produces a light meson , in which one quark comes from the heavy - to - light current and another antiquark from the light - to - light current to form a meson in the @xmath17 direction .",
    "a remaining quark goes to the @xmath15 direction .",
    "we can transform this operator to the form @xmath108 by fierz transformation . in order to simplify the organization of the computation",
    ", all the operators will be written in the form @xmath109 .",
    "if a fierz transformation is necessary to obtain this form , we apply fierz transformation in the full theory and perform matching accordingly .",
    "therefore we only have to consider operators of the form @xmath110 , but the two types of the operators with or without fierz transformation are regarded as distinct and their wilson coefficients are different .    though we know the form of the operators , the operator @xmath111 itself is not gauge invariant under the collinear , soft and usoft gauge transformations . in order to obtain gauge - invariant operators in @xmath5 , we employ two - step matching .",
    "we consider the emissions of collinear gluons @xmath33 and @xmath80 from external fermions in the full theory and integrate out the off - shell intermediate states of order @xmath112 to obtain the collinear gauge - invariant operators in @xmath2 .",
    "then we go down to @xmath5 , in which we consider the emissions of soft gluons @xmath36 which have momenta of order @xmath113 .",
    "the emission of soft gluons can cause intermediate states off the mass shell by the amount @xmath114 , which should be integrated out to obtain the final form of the operators in @xmath5 . to simplify the calculation , we will directly match the full - qcd operators to the operators in @xmath5 by considering the emissions of the collinear and the soft gluons from each fermion in the full qcd and integrate out all the intermediate states of order @xmath112 and @xmath115 to obtain the gauge - invariant operators in @xmath5 , as was done in ref .",
    "the result is equivalent to the two - step matching described above .",
    "we will use the two - step matching explicitly in treating the time - ordered products .",
    "we can construct gauge - invariant operators by attaching collinear or soft gluons to each fermion in the full qcd and integrate out off - shell modes .",
    "note that the soft gluons here have momenta of order @xmath116 , defined in @xmath5 . because the ordering of gauge fields is important due to the nonabelian nature of the gauge fields , we consider corrections to order @xmath117 .",
    "typical feynman diagrams at order @xmath117 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , and the remaining diagrams in which gluons are attached to other fermions are omitted .",
    "but it is straightforward to attach two gluons to all the fermion lines making intermediate states off - shell .    if collinear and soft gluons are attached to the heavy quark [ fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( a ) , ( b ) ] , the intermediate heavy quark and gluon states are off the mass shell and we integrate them out .",

    "we have considered the four - quark operators relevant to nonleptonic @xmath0 decays into two light mesons in scet at leading order in @xmath26 and to next - to - leading order in @xmath1 .",

    "when the effects of collinear and soft gluons are included , we can obtain gauge - invariant operators , and the explicit form of these operators guarantees the color transparency at leading order in @xmath26 but to all orders in @xmath1 .",
    "now the idea of the naive factorization in which the matrix elements of four - quark operators are reduced to products of the matrix elements of two currents has a theoretical basis .",
    "furthermore when we include spectator interactions which contribute to the nonfactorizable contribution and to the heavy - to - light form factor , the amplitudes , which include four - quark and six - quark operators , are factorized to all orders in @xmath1 .",
    "that is , the amplitudes can be written as a convolution of short - distance effects represented by the effective wilson coefficients and long - distance effects represented by the light - cone wave functions of mesons . and the convolution integrals appearing in the hard spectator interactions and in the hard contribution to the form factors are finite .",

    "the two types of the factorization properties , which correspond to the color transparency and the separation of long- and short - distance effects are satisfied to all orders in @xmath1 in nonleptonic @xmath0 decays .",
    "we can go beyond the leading - order calculation and consider subleading corrections in order to check the validity of the approach using scet .",
