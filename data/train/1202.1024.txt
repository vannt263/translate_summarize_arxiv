    "almost all available experimental results are consistent with the following vacuum oscillation parameters @xcite : @xmath35 there are , however , existing results which can not be accommodated within this picture , and suggest a possible need for extension beyond the three - neutrino framework .",
    "those results come from both appearance and disappearance measurements performed at relatively short baselines .    more specifically , two independent experiments , lsnd @xcite and miniboone @xcite , have observed three independent appearance - like excesses of electron neutrinos and/or antineutrinos in muon neutrino and/or antineutrino beams , at least two of which are consistent with oscillations at the level of 2.8 - 3.8 @xmath36 . under a two - neutrino oscillation approximation , each of those two measurements reveal excesses which correspond to a large @xmath4 , such that @xmath37 , requiring at least one extra neutrino mass eigenstate to be added to the standard three - neutrino mass spectrum .",

    "it is tempting to attribute the miniboone , lsnd , and reactor short - baseline signals to the existence of a single sterile neutrino ; however , attempted ( 3 + 1 ) fits have demonstrated that at least miniboone neutrino results and lsnd antineutrino results are incompatible under this scenario @xcite , suggesting that any successful theoretical interpretation of those results must be more complex than simply ( 3 + 1 ) .",
    "the source of this incompatibility is the fact that the miniboone antineutrino mode and lsnd antineutrino mode appearance searches prefer moderately small @xmath5 and @xmath55 ev@xmath8 , while the miniboone neutrino mode appearance search disfavors such @xmath5 values for the same @xmath56 ev@xmath8 . a minimal extension to the ( 3 + 1 ) model , which would allow for cp - violation ( i.e.  @xmath57 ) ,",

    "the y - axis parameter at the point of intersection of any ( dashed or solid ) vertical line with the corresponding ( dashed or solid , respectively ) black line corresponds to the effective @xmath85 parameter seen by a particular data set , as listed in tab .",
    "for example , in the top figure , the @xmath159 vertical line , in dashed red , intersects with the dashed black line at @xmath160  ev@xmath8 , and so the effective mass - squared difference seen by a 40  mev antineutrino in the lsnd beam corresponds to 0.45 ev@xmath8.,width=384 ]    as a final discussion point , we remark on the size of @xmath6 .",
    "while the form of the matter potential we have assumed is the same as that of the standard matter effect in three - neutrino oscillations ( @xmath161=constant ) , the resulting best - fit value suggested by the miniboone and lsnd data sets is roughly 500 times larger than that of standard matter effect .",
    "the result is consistent with the analytical picture presented in @xcite , where the authors state that in order to obtain observable , non - negligible matter effects in a model with a single sterile neutrino , one needs a matter effect potential of @xmath162  ev",
    ". the large value of @xmath6 may be quite difficult to explain in simple extensions to the theory .",
    "however , the good agreement of all three signatures within this three - parameter model motivates the development of theoretical interpretations which would lead to such a phenomenological effect .",
    "even though the vacuum oscillation parameters allowed in this model are constructed so as not to interfere with the atmospheric and solar oscillation scales , the @xmath25 and @xmath66 dependence can drive the effective @xmath85 and @xmath163 parameters to the solar and atmospheric parameter regions .",
    "therefore , one must ask whether constraints arise from solar / reactor and atmospheric / long - baseline accelerator experiments .",
    "reactor experiments pose little to no constraints to this scenario , as the low energy assures that the effective oscillation parameters deviate very little from the vacuum parameters ( which , according to the best fit , correspond to @xmath7  ev@xmath8 and @xmath164 ) .",
    "in fact , the reactor anomaly recently identified in short - baseline reactor experiments is consistent with small - amplitude oscillations due to a heavy ( @xmath1651 ev@xmath8 ) mostly - sterile mass eigenstate @xcite , and could reasonably be accommodated within the matter effect scenario .",
    "joint fits including the reactor data are necessary for more quantitative tests .",
    "it is likely that such matter effects affect neutrino propagation in the sun .",
    "however , this is probably dependent on the nature of @xmath66 .",
    "such effects should be investigated for particular @xmath66 underlying scenarios .    in the case of atmospheric / long - baseline accelerator oscillation experiments",
    ", we use the minos experiment as an example to investigate the effects of the best - fit model in sec .",
    "[ sec : fiveb ] .",
    "minos employs a near / far detector setup at @xmath166 km from a neutrino source , in order to look for @xmath17 and @xmath129 disappearance driven by the atmospheric @xmath4 scale , @xmath167 .",
    "the minos neutrino energy spectrum spans the 1 - 10  gev energy range , with a peak neutrino energy at 3 gev .",
    "because the @xmath85 deviation from the vacuum oscillation parameter becomes larger , overall , with increasing energy , and minos sits at a much higher energy than miniboone and lsnd , one might expect noticeable effects . from fig .",
    "[ effmixvse ] , one sees that for @xmath168 gev , the effective @xmath85 for neutrinos is similar to or larger than the vacuum @xmath4 , and therefore one might expect any possible oscillations to average out to half the disappearance amplitude , @xmath169 , for both the near and far minos detectors . here",
    ", @xmath170 corresponds to @xmath171 which is the standard @xmath17 disappearance probability amplitude for ( 3 + 1 ) sterile neutrino oscillations , except with @xmath172 , from eq .",
    "[ effum4 ] .",
    "figure  [ effs2thmm ] shows the @xmath170 dependence on @xmath25 for the best - fit parameters .",
    "one sees that @xmath170 is always equal to or smaller than the vacuum oscillation parameter @xmath173 for any neutrino oscillation experiment .",
    "therefore , the minos neutrino mode @xmath17 data set is insensitive to this model , since systematic uncertainties on the absolute event rate prediction at the near detector are much larger than this level .    in the case of antineutrino oscillations",
    ", however , the @xmath85 value decreases with @xmath25 and becomes negative beyond @xmath174  mev .",
    "note , however , that @xmath175 is insensitive to the sign of @xmath176 . beyond this point , therefore , the effective @xmath177 starts increasing linearly with @xmath25 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ effmixvse ] . given the best - fit oscillation parameters",
    ", we see that @xmath177 becomes close to the atmospheric @xmath167 for a narrow range of energies around @xmath178  mev .",
    "this range is on the very low edge of the minos energy range , and while the @xmath170 value for antineutrinos at this energy is predicted to be nearly maximal , without an actual fit it is difficult to make quantitative statements as to the level of constraint provided by minos antineutrino data , since the @xmath85 and @xmath170 vary rapidly in the minos antineutrino energy range . on the other hand ,",
    "it is reasonable to expect differences in the neutrino and antineutrino oscillation parameters obtained from minos @xmath17 and @xmath129 disappearance searches , respectively , such as those presented in @xcite .",

    "we have examined miniboone and lsnd results in oscillation fits to a model with a single , mostly - sterile neutrino mass eigenstate at a @xmath181 ev@xmath8 , with and without the presence of an effective matter - like potential of the form @xmath59 experienced only by sterile neutrino / antineutrino states .",
    "we find that the compatibility among lsnd and miniboone neutrino and antineutrino data sets increases significantly in the presence of a non - zero @xmath6 , with the best - fit parameters corresponding to the vacuum mixing parameters @xmath9 and @xmath7  ev@xmath8 , and @xmath10  ev . the best - fit parameters are consistent with reactor long - baseline , atmospheric , and accelerator long - baseline ( neutrino ) results , and can reasonably accommodate the recent reactor short - baseline anomalous result .",
    "implications for the minos antineutrino data set have also been considered ; the best - fit model predicts some observable effects in the minos antineutrino samples , and therefore minos sensitivity to those effects should be explored further .",
