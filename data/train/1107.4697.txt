    "one of the most remarkable predictions of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) arises in the higgs sector .",
    "supersymmetry requires the presence of two higgs doublets @xmath3 with a fully fixed yukawa structure .",
    "only one higgs @xmath4 can couple to the up - quark sector , while the other higgs @xmath5 couples to the down - quark and lepton sectors .",
    "the higgs potential quartic couplings are also determined in terms of the gauge couplings .",
    "when supersymmetry is softly broken some of these predictions are modified by quantum effects , but nevertheless the higgs quartic and yukawa couplings can be predicted as a function of the soft masses .",
    "this leads to some general predictions , the most important being the presence of a light higgs boson with mass @xmath6 gev .",
    "in addition there are relations between the heavy higgs masses such as @xmath7 .",
    "these predictions occur for the most popular models of supersymmetry - breaking , such as in gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking ( gmsb ) models .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to show that the higgs sector can be drastically modified if supersymmetry is broken dynamically by a strong sector at low energies @xmath8 tev .",
    "this can occur if the higgs responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking has sizeable couplings to this sector , which then leads to mixings with composite states .",
    "in particular , we will show that the mass of the lightest higgs boson can not only be heavier than the tree - level value , @xmath9 ( without large radiative corrections as in usual mssm models ) , but can also be significantly enhanced well beyond @xmath0 gev .",
    "furthermore the yukawa couplings can fully arise from supersymmetry - breaking effects , implying that it is possible to have a supersymmetric standard model with only one higgs doublet .    to accomplish this",
    ", there are several obvious generic problems that need to be addressed .",
    "first , a strong sector with a partly - composite higgs generically leads to corrections to standard model ( sm ) observables that have been very well measured at collider experiments .",
    "a second problem is related with the absence of large flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) .",
    "finally , we must generate sizeable gaugino and squark / slepton masses .",
    "however in contrast to gmsb models , the problem of generating sufficiently large higgsino masses ( the @xmath10-problem ) is easily solved in our setup because the higgsino can have sizeable mixing with the composite states .",
    "we will make the simplifying assumption that there is a unique strong sector responsible for supersymmetry breaking . as in gmsb models ,",
    "this sector will contain fields charged under the sm gauge group .",
    "due to our present lack of complete understanding of strong interactions , we will not consider any specific model of dynamical supersymmetry breaking .",
    "instead we will make use of the ads / cft correspondence in order to calculate observables and obtain predictions .",
    "generically this correspondence allows strongly - coupled gauge theories in the large-@xmath11 and large t hooft coupling limit to be described by gravitational theories in five dimensions @xcite .",
    "we will also consider the possibility of having the strong sector being responsible not only for supersymmetry breaking , but also for electroweak symmetry breaking . in this case",
    "the mssm higgs obtains a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) from a tadpole , as in bosonic technicolor models @xcite .",
    "a generic prediction of our scenario is that by mixing with the strong sector the lightest higgs boson can become much heavier than 130 gev without causing any conflict with electroweak precision tests ( ewpt ) .",
    "since the scale of supersymmetry breaking is low ( @xmath8 tev ) , novel ways are needed to generate sparticle masses consistent with collider bounds . for example",
    ", the problem of having sufficiently heavy gaugino masses can be remedied by marrying the gaugino with composite states thereby generating a dirac gaugino .",
    "similarly the squark and slepton masses will depend on how the mssm matter sector couples to the strong sector .",
    "if there is no direct coupling , one is forced to introduce an extra @xmath12 to mediate the breaking of supersymmetry to squarks and sleptons via flavor - independent @xmath1-terms .",
    "alternatively , the matter fields can mix with composite states and generate sizeable soft masses . in this case , yukawa couplings can be generated from the strong sector without requiring a second higgs doublet , but flavor symmetries are needed to avoid fcnc .",
    "our novel scenario leads to extraordinary mssm physics .",
    "for example , the lightest higgs boson may be observed through the golden @xmath13 decay channel , and can also have sizeable decays to the gravitino and higgsino whenever the @xmath14 channel is kinematically closed .",
    "signals of compositeness in the quark sector could also be visible at the lhc , and a tev - scale mass @xmath15 gauge boson , associated with the new @xmath12 gauge symmetry , could also be easily detected through its decay to leptons .",
    "the scenarios presented here share some similarities with models in a warped extra dimension with tev - scale supersymmetry breaking @xcite . also recently ,",
    "detailed strong sectors with similar properties has been proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite using seiberg dualities . for previous general studies",
    "see ref .  @xcite .",
    "in addition , while this article was being completed , we became aware of analogous phenomenological studies in ref.@xcite , that partially overlap with our present work .",
    "we go beyond the analysis in ref.@xcite by making use of the ads / cft correspondence to make quantitative predictions for large @xmath11 gauge theories .",
    "the strong sector will be broadly characterized by two parameters , the scale @xmath16 tev associated with the mass gap ( or , equivalently , the mass of the first resonance ) , and the number of  colors \" @xmath11 .",
    "we will assume that supersymmetry is completely broken in the strong sector with supersymmetry - breaking mass - splittings of order @xmath17 .",
    "the vacuum energy is therefore estimated to be @xmath18 ( assuming strong sector fields transform in the fundamental representation of the gauge group ) which implies that @xmath19-terms are generically of order f~^2 , [ fterm ] and similarly for @xmath1-terms . in certain cases it will be useful to parametrize , as usual , the breaking of supersymmetry by a dimensionless spurion superfield ^2 .",

    "<S> we show that when supersymmetry is broken at the tev scale by strong dynamics , the higgs sector of the mssm can be drastically modified . </S>",
    "<S> this arises from possible sizeable mixings of the higgs with the resonances of the strong sector . </S>",
    "<S> in particular the mass of the lightest higgs boson can be significantly above the mssm bound ( @xmath0 gev ) . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore only one higgs doublet is strictly necessary , because the yukawa couplings can have a very different structure compared to the mssm . </S>",
    "<S> using the ads / cft correspondence electroweak precision observables can be calculated and shown to be below experimental bounds . </S>",
    "<S> the most natural way to generate sparticle masses is through mixing with the composite states . </S>",
    "<S> this causes the gauginos and higgsinos to easily obtain dirac masses around 200 gev , while scalar masses can be generated either from extra @xmath1-terms or also through mixing with the strongly - coupled states . </S>",
    "<S> finally one of the most interesting predictions of these scenarios is the sizeable decay width of the higgs boson into a very light gravitino @xmath2 ev ) and a higgsino .    </S>",
