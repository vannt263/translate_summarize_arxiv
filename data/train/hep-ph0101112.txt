    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is today the only reliable theory for describing strong interactions .",
    "there exist many systems that can be used as a laboratory for exploring and testing the properties of this basic theory . among them ,",
    "the meson and baryon sectors have deserved a lot of investigations , essentially because they are very easily produced .",
    "however they belong to the non perturbative application of qcd and thus are not easy to be described from first principles . despite many improvements in recent years , on both theoretical and computational sides , the lattice gauge calculations are still not completely reliable and",
    "can not explain the whole bulk of known properties , even for the simplest systems such as the mesons , which consist of a valence quark - antiquark pair .",
    "this explains why so many various phenomenological approaches have been developped in order to describe the non perturbative part of qcd . among them",
    "the non relativistic quark model ( nrqm ) has met with an impressive number of successes @xcite .",
    "the puzzling question is that it still works even in situations where it is expected to fail ; there exist certainly some deep reasons for such a behaviour although they have not yet been clarified precisely ( see @xcite ) .",
    "basically the nrqm needs to solve a schrdinger type equation with two - body quark - quark ( or quark - antiquark ) interactions . in recent years",
    ", the determination of the interaction between constituent quarks has reached a high degree of sophistication and the whole spectra of mesons for instance can be accounted for in a rather satisfactory way @xcite .",
    "however one does know that the description of the spectra is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for aiming at a good explanation of non perturbative qcd .",
    "in particular several very different potentials can give rise to spectra of the same quality .",
    "one needs other observables in order to test more precisely the resulting wave functions .",
    "a possibility is the study of static properties , such as magnetic moments or charged square radii .",
    "but more sensitive observables concern the transitions between various states or production mechanisms ( which rely essentially on the same dynamical operators ) .",
    "one can think for instance on meson decays under strong forces ( a resonance giving two or several mesons ) or the decays under electroweak forces ( a resonance producing a photon or leptons in the final channel ) .",
    "the advantage of this last kind of transition is that the transition operator is known perfectly well and thus it is easier to disantangle the drawbacks coming from less well known strong interactions through the meson wave function .",
    "in fact this statement is not completely true in the nrqm .",
    "being a phenomenological theory , nrqm deals with effective degrees of freedom , the constituent quarks , and a pure dirac form of the quark - photon vertex in the transition operator is questionnable .",
    "moreover , even in the traditional approach of radiative transitions ( decay of a resonance into a resonance of lower energy plus a real photon ) several types of approximations are of current use ; the effect of these approximations can hide the necessity of using a more sophisticated vertex for the quark - photon coupling .",
    "most of those approximations originate from the formulae widely used in atomic or nuclear physics which are simply translated in the meson sector .",
    "let us mention the dipole approximation for e1 transitions , the long wave length approximation ( lwla ) and a non relativistic phase space factor .",
    "although these approximations are fully justified in atomic or nuclear physics , it is not obvious that they continue to work when applied to mesons . indeed in this sector",
    "the transition energy is typically @xmath0",
    "= @xmath1 = 0.10.5 gev , while the size of the source is roughly @xmath2 = 0.51 fm = 2.55 @xmath3 , so that the long wave length condition @xmath4 is not really justified .",
    "comparing the photon energy to the mass of the emitting meson also convinces us that a non relativistic phase space is probably not suited .",
    "moreover the fact that the electrons in an atom or the nucleons in a nucleus have the same mass is not true in the case of some mesons , and new phenomena can appear .    during the seventies and eighties ,",
    "a lot of works has been done on radiative transitions for mesons ( and also for baryons but we are not so interested in this sector here ) . at the very",
    "beginning they were studied in the vector dominance model @xcite , then the quark model was introduced either in the framework of mit bag model @xcite , the non relativistic quark model @xcite , 2 body dirac equation @xcite or some relativized phenemenological quark models @xcite .",
    "but even in the most complete and nice works , as @xcite or @xcite , there is always an approximation or an inconsistency which plagues the results or forbids to draw precise conclusions .",
    "most of relativistic models suffer of a bad treatment of the center of mass , relativized model do not treat with equal care the quark - quark potential and the electromagnetic operator .",
    "moreover in many papers , a non relativistic phase space or a long wave length approximation are used and we will see that this is not justified in the meson sector .",
    "in addition , only very few studies concern the totality of the known experimental data but focus on very specific transitions ( light quark sector or heavy quark sector or even more restricted sets ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is essentially twofold .",
    "first , within a very precise framework namely the nrqm , we want to investigate deeply and with a particular care the effects of all these approximations as compared to an exact treatment .",
    "second , we compare , on an exhaustive list of transitions and using an exact treatment , how different meson wave functions ( obtained with different potentials giving meson spectra of similar quality ) influence the results at the level of radiative transitions .",
    "we have in mind to see whether it is necessary to modify the quark - photon vertex ; our study is thus a first necessary step before undertaking a more difficult and ambitious program .    in this paper",
    "we will consider all the radiative transitions ( which are sufficiently reliable ) that are reported in the particle data group booklet because we want an exhaustive analysis .",
    "the experimental data can be gathered into several groups :    * the transitions allowed by lwla ; they are essentially m1 transitions ( @xmath5 or @xmath6 ) and e1 transitions ( @xmath7 or @xmath8 ) ; there is also the particular e1 transition corresponding to the decay @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) * the transitions forbidden by lwla ; they are scarce but interesting : they correspond to @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 transitions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we present how the meson wave functions are obtained and also the different quark - antiquark potentials that we are studying . in the third chapter we recall the formalism necessary for the description of radiative transitions putting the emphasis on the general treatment and the differences corresponding to the various approximations that we want to discuss . in the fourth chapter our final expressions for the total widths",
    "are summarized . in the fifth chapter",
    "the results are presented and the effects of each approximation are analyzed in detail .",
    "conclusions are relegated to the last chapter .",
    "in the nrqm , the meson is considered as a two particle system : a ( constituent ) quark of mass @xmath14 and an antiquark of mass @xmath15 submitted to a potential @xmath16 , so that the corresponding schrdinger equation writes :    @xmath17 \\mid \\psi_{\\alpha } \\rangle = m_{\\alpha } \\mid \\psi_{\\alpha } \\rangle\\ ] ]    where @xmath18 is the reduced mass , @xmath19 the relative momentum , and @xmath20 the total mass of the resonance .",
    "this last quantity , as well as the wave function @xmath21 , of course depend on the choice for the potential .",
    "the ordinary quarks @xmath22 and @xmath23 can be considered as an isospin doublet ; they are noted generically as @xmath24 .      in this paper",
    "we will consider three different types of potential , the so - called bhaduri s ( bd ) potential @xcite , al1 and ap1 potentials @xcite .",
    "for the purpose of our analysis , it is not necessary to introduce very sophisticated forms including spin - orbit , tensor forces , ... whose effects are not so important and which complicate quite a lot the formalism .",
    "we limit ourselves to potentials containing two different structures : a central term and a hyperfine term ; this is the minimum requirement to get reliable wave functions :    @xmath25    in this expression , we forget about the color term which is always the same whatever the meson under consideration .    the central term @xmath26 contains a short range coulomb part ( remnant of one gluon exchange ) and a confining term :    @xmath27    bd and al1 potentials exhibit a traditional linear confinement ( @xmath28 ) while ap1 potential uses @xmath29 , a power best suited to regge trajectories in non relativistic dynamics . in each potential",
    "the hyperfine term is short range ( remnant of the dirac factor of the fermi - breit approximation ) .",
    "for bd it is of yukawa type :    @xmath30    for al1 and ap1 it is of gaussian type :    @xmath31    but , contrary to bd , the size is mass dependent through @xmath32 the parameters for the potentials are gathered in table ( [ parapot ] ) .",
    "the meson spectra obtained with these potentials are rather good and have been presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "it is important to stress that they also give quite good results in the baryon sector ; so we have some confidence that they describe the quark dynamics in a meson in a rather satisfactory way .",

    "spin @xmath50 and orbital momentum @xmath52 are coupled to total angular momentum @xmath53 , but are nevertheless good quantum numbers .",
    "the color wave function is forgotten since it does not play any role in the formalism ; the flavor content of the meson is also forgotten since the electromagnetic operator does not change the quark flavor .",
    "the magnetic quantum numbers are not indicated here although the projection of the isospin plays a role since the operator is a mixing of isoscalar and isovector terms .",
    "we will come back on this point later on .",
    "we will use the expression of the space wave function both in position representation and in momentum representation .",
    "thus we write :    @xmath54    we use the same notation for the radial wave function @xmath55 in both representations if there is no risk of confusion .",
    "in fact the momentum representation is very often more convenient to deal with the matrix elements of the transition operator .",
    "moreover an approximation of the exact wave function in terms of gaussian functions will be particularly well suited to compute easily difficult quantities . in this case",
    "we write :    @xmath56    and a similar expression for the wave function in coordinate representation . in general",
    "the number of gaussian terms needed in ( [ fop ] ) to achieve convergence is rather weak .",
    "just to give an idea of the quality of such an expansion in the case of al1 potential , the masses @xmath57 and @xmath58 as function of @xmath59 are presented in table ( [ mpiro ] ) and compared to the exact ones ( obtained by solving the differential equation with the numerov algorithm ) .",
    "in the same spirit we plot the corresponding wave functions in figure ( [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "although there is some differences between the @xmath59=1 and @xmath59=2 cases , one sees that very rapidly the approximation ( [ fop ] ) can be identified to the exact solution . in practice",
    "we perform our calculations with @xmath59=5 and consider the corresponding wave function as the exact one .",
    "let us also point out that , since the basis states are not orthogonal , different sets of ( @xmath60 ) parameters can be used with equal success .",
    "in fact , we determine these coefficients by two different methods : i ) minimisation of the state with respect to these parameters , ii ) best fit of the exact wave function with a form like ( [ fop ] ) . for @xmath59=5 ,",

    "we want to stress at the very beginning that , due to the fact that the wave functions have been determined with given potentials and that the transition operator is perfectly well defined , all the results presented in this section ( except the very last subsection concerning mixing angles ) are free from any adjustable parameter .",
    "they are thus a very good tool for exploring in detail the drawbacks of the formalism .      in the various potentials under consideration",
    ", we do not consider instanton contribution which can mix strange and ordinary sectors .",
    "so , in order to describe correctly the scalar @xmath177 mesons , we must introduce by hand some flavor mixing angle .",
    "here we consider the idealized case of equal mixing between @xmath24 flavor ( isospin doublet @xmath22 or @xmath23 ) and strange flavor @xmath178 , which gives : @xmath179 @xmath180    with those presciptions the @xmath177 and @xmath181 mesons are orthogonal .",
    "some other comments are in order .",
    "the qed conserves the flavor of the particles at the vertex ( the radiative transitions with flavor change @xmath182 are intensively studied recently see @xcite but they need penguin diagrams that we do not consider here ) ; this implies that the quark content of meson @xmath99 is the same as the one in the initial meson @xmath113 ( in our elementary decay process exhibited in figure ( [ schema ] ) ) .",
    "nevertheless the experimental data show a non zero decay width for the following transitions concerning vector mesons : @xmath183 and @xmath184 . for a @xmath185 meson taken to be a pure @xmath186 , as usually prescribed ,",
    "this seems to indicate that flavor conservation is violated .",
    "instanton effects can not be advocated because they do not play any role for a spin triplet .",
    "those reactions result from more complicated processes .",
    "one can imagine for instance an annihilation of the @xmath187 pair in meson @xmath113 into one or several virtual gluons and creation of a new @xmath187 pair in meson @xmath99 ( of possibly different flavor ) that interacts and emits a real photon .",
    "this is possible only for neutral flavor mesons .",
    "indeed such transitions ( with change of flavor ) does not occur in kaons for example .    a possible way to take into account phenomenologically those kinds of transitons , in our elementary process ,",
    "is to include in the wave functions of the @xmath188 a strange flavor part , or / and in the @xmath185 wave function a @xmath24 flavor part .",
    "a difficulty immediatly appears in the case of @xmath66 resonance since it is isovector while a strange flavor can only create an isoscalar . for",
    "the @xmath188 and @xmath185 one could introduce a mixing flavor angle @xmath189 .",
    "the physical mesons are now a combination of the ideal @xmath190 and @xmath191 .",
    "@xmath192    now with this modification , the transition @xmath183 can be understood as the result of two contributions : @xmath193 and @xmath194 .",
    "for the @xmath184 only the @xmath24 flavor part of the @xmath185 contributes .    from the electromagnetic point of view ,",
    "only the charge is conserved , that is the projection of the isospin but not the isospin value .",
    "we can imagine an isospin mixing angle @xmath195 between neutral @xmath66 and @xmath188 . as a consequence @xmath66 couples to @xmath185 at the second order .",
    "another evidence for this possible mixing angle is the discrepancy between the neutral and charged channel of the @xmath196 .",
    "this isospin mixing could be understood by the near degeneracy of @xmath66 and @xmath188 masses @xcite .",
    "@xmath197    our mixing angles are chosen in order to recover the usual prescription for @xmath198 ; this does not correspond always to what can be found elsewhere . for a great part of our study",
    ", we work in the usual scheme and do not consider mixing angles .",
    "we will drop those presciptions at the very end .",
    "we investigate the quality of our results as the number of gaussians terms @xmath59 in the expansion ( [ fop ] ) of the wave function varies from @xmath199 ( approximation ) to @xmath61 ( exact wave function ) . for this study",
    ", we use a relativistic phase space , the al1 potential and focus on the transition @xmath200 .",
    "the convergence properties on the energies have already been discussed in table ( [ mpiro ] ) .",
    "the two formalisms  lwla and the general case  are employed .",
    "the results are shown in the table ( [ nbg ] ) .",
    "first of all , one can see a sizeable improvement going from @xmath199 to @xmath201 for both studies . limiting oneself to @xmath199 , as is very often done in literature can lead to 10 % error . for @xmath201 to @xmath202",
    "there is still a further small variation .",
    "for @xmath202 the convergence is achieved and a stable result is reached ; no further improvement is got passing from @xmath202 to @xmath61 .",
    "this is consistent with figure ( [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this means that 3 gaussian terms are enough to describe the wave function in a correct way . nevertheless ,",
    "for the rest of our study , every calculation is performed with @xmath61 and the result is considered as the exact one concerning the wave function .",
    "this is particularly important in the case of radial excitations ( with one or several nodes in the radial part ) , since obviously @xmath199 can not explain such a state and even @xmath201 could be a crude approximation .",
    "moreover , since our results are analytical , computation with @xmath61 is practically as fast as the @xmath202 case .",
    "we would like to point out that even if we used only one transition ( @xmath5 ) to test the quality of the wave function , the same conclusions are valid whatever the transition under consideration .",
    "we know by experience that @xmath61 is always a very convenient tool to describe the exact wave function .",
    "the fact that the above transition is better reproduced in lwla than in the exact formalism is not general and is commented later on .      to study",
    "which phase space , among the three ones proposed in the last section , is the most appropriate for those calculations , we used the al1 potential , exact wave functions and lwla . in any case",
    ", we showed in other works that all phase space considerations must be done with the experimental values of the resonance energies .",
    "the transitions @xmath11 and @xmath13 that are seen experimentally can not been explained in the lwla and are not reported in this part .    the results for the relativistic phase space ( rps ) , the mixed one ( mps ) and the non relativistic one ( nrps ) are compiled in the tables ( [ glo_rel_al1]-[glo_rel_al1_2 ] ) . a global glance at the quality of the results vs the phase space",
    "immediatly reveals that ( nrps ) is not a correct prescription , the theoretical results being very often too large , except may be for heavy mesons for which a non relativistic treatment is acceptable .",
    "the problem comes essentially from a wrong determination of the momentum @xmath203 , that enters both in the @xmath204 factor ( here taken as unity ) and in the dynamical amplitudes .",
    "there exist some important discrepancies between the relativistic and the non relativistic momenta ( this could be seen in the second and third columns of the different tables ) .",
    "we remind you that the experimental values of the meson masses are used .",
    "the mps supports this conclusion ; it uses the relativistic impulsion but a @xmath204 factor equal to one ( as in the non relativistic phase space ) and the results are much better than nrps ones , and little poorer than rps ones .",
    "so the predicted decays widths in nrps are essentially spoiled by wrong values of momentum .",
    "the change in the results going from mps to rps is proportional to the factor @xmath204 .",
    "so looking at the fourth column of the tables , one sees that the biggest deviation is around a factor 2 and concerns the transitions : @xmath205 or @xmath206 .",
    "the use of rps is quite satisfactory for the whole bulk of data , indicating that the wave functions are not completely crazy .    in the fourth column",
    "we also see that @xmath207 is a justified approximation for the heavy mesons , this is due to the fact that the mass spectrum is here more dense than in the light sector .    with those values of momenta and considering their important values for some transitions ,",
    "it is also interesting to be aware that the lwla could not be always a justified formalism . in the case of important mass differences between initial and final state",
    ", the recoil term could not be omitted .    in view of this discussion",

    "although this is not always the case , lwla often gives better ( as compared to experiment ) results ; this means that either the wave functions are not so good or that something is still missing in the theory .",
    "the transitions @xmath13 and @xmath11 are also purely magnetic but are completely forbidden in lwla .",
    "our complete treatment predicts them with the right order of magnitude .",
    "lastly @xmath260 and @xmath261 transitions show interference between electric and magnetic contributions while they are purely electric in lwla .",
    "since the electric part remains largely dominant there is no big difference between both formalisms except in the case of @xmath262 which is greatly enhanced in the right direction .",
    "an overall look at those tables shows us the similarity of the decay widths resulting from the al1 , ap1 and bhaduri potentials .",
    "the results obtained with al1 generally lie between those of bhaduri and ap1 .",
    "the predicted values coming from the al1 potential are smaller than the ap1 ones .",

    "one seems a little poorer .",
    "the trends are essentially the same and when one potential gives too low ( or too high ) value , so do the others .",
    "the agreement with experiment is satisfactory for all types of transitions , giving indication that we are in the good track for the description of mesons .",
    "the discrepancy with experimental situation exceeds 50% very scarcely and this can be considered as encouraging but not completely satisfactory .",
    "the fact that three different wave functions give more or less the same trends ( although there can exist 20% differences ) shows that the quality of the wave function is not responsible entirely for the discrepancy with experiment .",
    "moreover lwla as an approximation should give poorer agreement than a complete exact treatment .",
    "this is not the case ( except of course when it gives a null result ) .",
    "this proves that something is still missing in the formalism although the present day calculations provide the dominant contributions .",
    "+ now let us have a closer look to some interesting transitions .",
    "a special one concerns the neutral and charged decays of the @xmath66 into the @xmath263 .",
    "experimentally the decay width for the charged channel is 68 kev whereas the measure for the neutral is 102 kev . in our calculation",
    "the small difference between those two channels comes only from the tiny difference between the experimental masses of the @xmath264 and the @xmath265 .",
    "the decay width has the same expression for those transitions due to the term @xmath266 ^ 2 $ ] in expression ( [ mmu ] ) appearing for meson composed of a single flavor .",
    "that is @xmath267 ^ 2=\\frac{1}{9}$ ] for the charged channel and @xmath268 ^ 2=\\frac{1}{9}$ ] for the neutral one .",
    "so where does this important variation between those two channels come from ? first we have to point out that given the large uncertainties 67.82 @xmath243 7.55 and 102.48 @xmath243 25.69 the two values are nearly compatible with 76 mev .",
    "this means that there may be no problem with those channels except an experimental one !",
    "nevertheless if we rely more deeply on the experimental values a possible insight could come from the @xmath269 transition , which is identical to @xmath270 but with an enhancement by a factor 9 due to isospin .",
    "the experimental value 715 kev is roughly in agreement with this point .",
    "so even a small isospin mixing between the @xmath188 and the @xmath271 could increase sufficiently the decay width to explain the data .",
    "this hypothesis will be tested in the next part .",
    "we remark the same variation for the k * decaying into the k meson and for the b * into the b. yet this time the isospin factor explains this variation .",
    "it appears a factor @xmath272 for the neutral channel and a factor @xmath273 for the charged one in the lwla ( it is more complicated to estimate the ratio of the strange with the isospin doublet masses in the general formalism ) . using the experimental data and making the approximation that the matrix elements in those two channels are identical ( except the isospin dependence )",
    ", we find the relation : @xmath274 . in our potentials",
    "this ratio @xmath275 is 1.83 , 1.78 , 2.00 for the al1 , ap1 and bhaduri respectively .",

    "this means that for the transitions number one to five of the @xmath5 tables , the integral part is identical .",
    "now since the experimental hierarchy of the decay widths is reproduced in our calculation this could indicate that we used a correct prescription ; moreover since the numerical value are also reproduced this ensures the quality of our wave functions . + it is not sure that the decay of the @xmath280 into @xmath281 has been observed experimentaly but our result for this width tends to prove that it should be seen experimentally .",
    "+      if the wave function is composed of two parts as in the @xmath177 mesons ( flavor mixing ) , or in the @xmath66 ( isospin mixing with the @xmath188 ) , some precisions are needed in the formalism . in the case of @xmath177 , the wave function",
    "can be written : @xmath282 . in our study",
    "there is no instanton effect so we put by hand a mixing of 50% between the two flavors .",
    "that is we calculate separately the states @xmath283 and @xmath284 both normalised to one and we have @xmath285 , @xmath286 .",
    "a possible difficulty is that those states do not have the same mass in order to calculate the phase space ; nevertheless as we take the experimental value there is no difficulty .",
    "+ from a general point of view we write @xmath287 where 1 and 2 denote the two flavor ( or isospin ) components of the wave function .",
    "we have to calculate : @xmath288 so there could exist 4 components , and therefore some interferences . in the case of flavor",
    "mixing not all the terms will contribute due to flavor conservation .    as we have said in section [ comments ]",
    ", the @xmath185 could decay into the @xmath188 , the @xmath66 and the @xmath65 .",

    "we have analyzed carefully the different parts of this elementary process .",
    "first of all we have presented different formalisms ; the long wave length approximation , also called the static approximation , where the recoil term is neglected .",
    "we also investigated the dipole approximation , in which the spacial integrals are performed in the representation space with the presence of the factor @xmath307 ; another step in this non relativistic approximation is the replacement of @xmath307 by the photon energy @xmath147 . and",
    "finally we go beyong the long wave length approximation .",
    "the different formulae for the decay widths are presented in the appendix . in view of the results no formalism seems more suited than the others to describe the radiative decay , all of them giving the right order of magnitude , nevertheless the superiority of the general formalism comes from the fact that it allows the calculation of electric - magnetic interference terms and forbidden transitions in the lwla and da such as @xmath308 .",
    "+ secondly , we study three phase spaces : relativistic , non relativistic and mixed .",
    "this last one uses a relativistic momentum but a non relativistic value of the ratio @xmath204 which allows us to show that the important point is a good description of the momentum .",
    "anyhow we showed that a relativistic phase space is always better and should be used in any circumstance .",
    "+ then we checked the importance of the wave function through the use of three potentials : al1 , ap1 and bd .",
    "those calculations do not allow to show the superiority of one of them , the predicted values being of the same quality .",
    "for our results to be analytical we expand our wave functions as a sum of n gaussian terms .",
    "we showed that n=3 is sufficient to obtain a convergence of the results but in order to be sure to treat the exact wave function , we used everywhere in our calculation n=5 . we also showed that using exact wave functions is always preferable as the one gaussian approximation that is sometimes of common use",
    ". the difference could be as large as a 20% effect .",
    "+ finally we incorporated some mixing angles in order to calculate some otherwise badly reproduced or even forbidden transitions such as @xmath309 .",
    "those angles are of two kinds : isospin mixing between the @xmath66 and @xmath188 mesons and flavor mixing between the @xmath185 and @xmath188 mesons .",
    "the results are not satisfactory . except for a possible explanation of the important difference between neutral and charged decay of the @xmath66 into pion",
    ", the isospin mixing deteriorate the quality of the predicted value whereas for the flavor mixing there is no important improvements .",
    "+ although a completely rigourous formalism gives an overall satisfactory agreement with experimental data , we gave arguments that , in the framework that we considered ( nrqm and nr expression for the transition operator ) some physics is still absent .",
    "we think that one can explore two different directions : inclusion of relativistic effects both in the wave functions and in the transition operator , and introduction of form factors at the quark - photon vertex .",
