    "this is simply because our main recursion formula   may actually be viewed as a recurrence relation with constant coefficients depending algebraically on a complex variable @xmath75 .",
    "however , in many important cases one has to invoke quite different arguments in order to derive similar ( pointwise ) convergence results .",
    "for instance , the major challenge in the theory of finite difference equations is related to recurrence relations with varying coefficients . in this case",

    "well - known results on diagonal pad approximants at @xmath6 going back to markov @xcite claim that if the analytic function under consideration is the cauchy transform of a positive measure supported on a real interval then the poles of all pad approximants belong to this interval and thus both the pad conjecture and nuttall s conjecture are trivially valid for such functions ( see also @xcite ) . on the other hand",
    ", we saw in  3 that already algebraic functions which are obtained as the cauchy transform of a real but not necessarily positive measure supported on an interval might violate nuttall s conjecture .",

    "recall first that the conjugates of an algebraic number @xmath510 are by definition all algebraic numbers other than @xmath510 satisfying the irreducible algebraic equation with integer coefficients defining @xmath510 . notice that theorem  [ th : exist ] has an obvious analog for algebraic numbers .",

    "such matrices are the main ingredient in the vast program of studying multidimensional continuous fractions suggested by v.  arnold ( following the ideas of f.  klein ) .",
