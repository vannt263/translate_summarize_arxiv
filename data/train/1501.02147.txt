    "the metal - insulator transition ( mit ) , and disordered systems have been at the forefront of condensed matter research since the middle of the last century  @xcite , and yet this topic still has several open questions and is still actively investigated . in the last few years experimental evidence has been obtained about this topic ; in particular , reporting anderson localization of ultrasound in disordered elastic networks  @xcite , light in disordered photonic lattices in the transverse direction  @xcite , or in an ultracold atomic system in a disordered laser trap  @xcite .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite examined the mit in a dilute magnetic semiconductor ga@xmath5mn@xmath6as , which is a strongly interacting and disordered system .",
    "they found a clear phase transition together with multifractal fluctuations of the local density of states ( ldos ) at the fermi energy , showing , that multifractality is a robust and important property of disordered systems .",
    "multifractal properties consistent with the theory of anderson localization are also found in the ultrasound system  @xcite . on the theoretical side , we know that disorder plays a crucial role in integer quantum hall effect  @xcite , and recently it was shown that an enhanced correlation of multifractal wave - function densities in disordered systems can increase the superconducting critical temperature  @xcite or the multifractal fluctuations of the ldos close to criticality may lead to a new phase due to the presence of local kondo effects induced by local pseudogaps at the fermi energy  @xcite .",
    "moreover , anderson localization has also been reported in the spectrum of the dirac operator within the lattice model of qcd at high temperatures using spectral statistics  @xcite , and multifractal analysis seems to corroborate it , as well  @xcite .",
    "these models show an increased interest in understanding the nature of the anderson transition in the presence of various global symmetries .",
    "a comprehensive review of the current understanding is given in ref .  .",
    "these symmetry classes have been introduced first to describe random matrix ensembles , but the naming conventions are the same in the field of disordered systems .",
    "the classification considers two global symmetries : time - reversal and spin - rotational symmetry . as it turns out , beside these symmetries",
    "there are three further symmetry classes according to the presence of chiral symmetry , and in addition there are four bogoliubov - de gennes classes also , corresponding to particle - hole symmetry  @xcite prominent in hybrid ( superconductor - normal ) systems . the effect of symmetry classes at the anderson transition has already been investigated earlier  @xcite using spectral statistics , but there is much less work based on the multifractal analysis of the eigenstates , and multifractal exponents are known numerically only for the orthogonal class  @xcite .    our goal in this article is to fill in this gap and apply multifractal finite - size scaling ( mfss ) , developed originally by rodriguez , vasquez , rmer and slevin  @xcite , to the anderson models in the three conventional wigner - dyson ( wd ) classes . the organization of the article is the following . in sec .",
    "[ sec : anderson_classes_numerics ] we define the model and describe its numerical representation . in sec .",
    "[ sec : mfss ] we briefly describe the finite - size scaling analysis of the generalized multifractal exponents of the critical eigenstates , in sec .  [ sec : and_mfss ] we give the results obtained for the three universality classes and finally in sec .  [ sec : summary ] we summarize our results .",
    "in this article we investigate anderson models belonging to the three wd classes , without chiral and particle - hole symmetry .",
    "we investigate the case of diagonal disorder and nearest - neighbor hopping , therefore the hamiltonian reads as @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 stand for site- and spin index , @xmath10-s are random on - site energies , which are uniformly distributed over the interval @xmath11 $ ] , @xmath12 acts as disorder strength . using a uniform distribution is just a convention , other distributions of disorder , e.g. gaussian , binary , etc .",
    "can be used as well .    in the orthogonal class time - reversal and spin - rotational symmetry",
    "are preserved . in this case",
    "the hamiltonian is invariant under orthogonal transformations  hence the name  , therefore it is a real symmetric matrix .",
    "since spin does not play a role , we consider a spinless anderson model . in the numerical simulations",
    "the hamiltonian is represented by an @xmath13 real symmetric matrix , where @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is the linear system size in lattice spacing .",
    "the diagonal elements , are are uniformly distributed random numbers , the off - diagonal elements are zero , except if @xmath16 and @xmath17 are nearest neighbors : @xmath18\\text { , if } i = j\\\\ -1\\text { , if $ i$ and $ j$ are neighboring sites}\\\\",
    "0\\text { , otherwise}\\end{cases}\\ ] ] the energy unit is fixed by setting the hopping elements to @xmath19 . to avoid surface effects",
    ", we use periodic boundary conditions .",
    "however , this case was investigated very carefully by rodriguez _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , we consider this symmetry class to verify our numerical method , and to obtain a complete description of all the wd classes .    in the unitary class time - reversal symmetry",
    "is broken , which can be realized physically by applying a magnetic field .",
    "it can be shown , that either spin rotational symmetry is broken or not , the model will belong to the unitary class  @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian is invariant under unitary transformations therefore it is a complex hermitian matrix .",
    "we discuss the case when spin - rotational symmetry is present , because this way we can use spinless fermions again , which keeps the matrix size @xmath13 .",
    "however , one has to store about twice as much data compared with the orthogonal case , because here every off - diagonal matrix element is a complex number . obviously finding an eigenvalue and",
    "an eigenvector takes more time , too .    for the numerical simulations we followed slevin and ohtsuki  @xcite",
    "let us consider a magnetic field pointing in the @xmath20 direction with flux @xmath21 , measured in units of the flux quantum , @xmath22 .",
    "its effect can be represented by a unity phase factor , the peierls substitution for the hopping elements of the hamiltonian matrix .",
    "the upper triangular of the hamiltonian reads as @xmath23 \\text { , if } i = j\\\\ -1 \\text { , if $ i$ and $ j$ are neighboring sites}\\\\",
    "\\phantom{-1\\text { , } } \\text{in the $ x$ or $ y$ direction}\\\\ -e^{i2\\pi\\phi x } \\text { , if $ i$ and $ j$ are neighboring}\\\\ \\phantom{-1\\text { , } } \\text{sites in the $ z$ direction}\\\\ 0 \\text { , otherwise}\\end{cases}\\ ] ] complex hermiticity sets the off - diagonal elements in the lower triangular part , @xmath24 .",
    "periodic boundary conditions and flux quantization force a restriction for the magnetic flux namely , that @xmath25 must be an integer . in the thermodynamic limit",
    "arbitrarily small magnetic field drives the system from the orthogonal to the unitary class .",
    "however , in a finite system the relationship between the system size , @xmath15 , and the magnetic length , @xmath26 matters . in the case of weak magnetic field , @xmath27 , the system belongs to the orthogonal class , in the case of strong magnetic field , @xmath28 , it belongs to the unitary class .",
    "since we use system sizes that are multiples of 10 lattice spacings , see tab .",
    "[ tab : anderson_classes_fss_systemsize ] , we chose @xmath29 .",
    "this leads to @xmath30 therefore this choice clearly fulfills the two conditions above .    in the symplectic class time - reversal symmetry",
    "is present , and spin - rotational symmetry is broken , which describes a system with spin - orbit interaction . in this case",
    "the hamiltonian is invariant under symplectic transformations therefore it is a quaternion hermitian matrix . for the numerical simulations we followed asada , slevin and ohtsuki  @xcite .",
    "since in this case we have to deal with the spin index also , the hamiltonian is an @xmath31 complex hermitian matrix .",
    "diagonal elements corresponding to the @xmath16th site and hopping elements between sites @xmath16 and @xmath17 are @xmath32 matrices because of the spin indexes , having a form @xmath33 where @xmath10 is an uniformly distributed random on - site energy from the interval @xmath11 $ ] , @xmath34 and @xmath35 were chosen to form an su(2)-invariant parametrization , leading to the so - called su(2 ) model : @xmath36 and @xmath35 are uniform random variables from the interval @xmath37 $ ] , and @xmath38 has a probability density function @xmath39 in the range @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "the upper triangular of the hamiltonian has the following form : @xmath41 the off - diagonal elements are defined following complex hermiticity . to store the hamiltonian requires about eight times more memory compared to the orthogonal case , because here every off - diagonal element contains four complex numbers .",
    "finding an eigenvalue is much slower than for the unitary case , mainly because of the linear size of the matrix is twice as large .",
    "mfss deals with the eigenvectors of the hamiltonian , which is a large sparse matrix .",
    "recent high precision calculations  @xcite use jacobi - davidson iteration with incomplete lu preconditioning , therefore we decided to use this combination . for preconditioning the ilupack  @xcite",
    "was used , for the jd iteration the primme  @xcite package was used . since the metal - insulator transition occurs at the band center  @xcite ( @xmath1 ) at disorder @xmath42 for the orthogonal , at @xmath43 for the unitary ( depending on the strength of magnetic field ) , at @xmath44 for the symplectic class ( for our parameters ) , most works study the vicinity of these points . to have the best comparison",
    ", we analyzed this regime , therefore @xmath45 disorder values were taken from the range @xmath46 for the orthogonal class , @xmath47 disorder values were taken from the interval @xmath48 for the unitary class , and @xmath45 disorder values were taken from the interval @xmath49 for the symplectic class .",
    "system sizes were taken from the range @xmath50 , and the number of samples are listed in tab .  [",

    "in this paper we examined the three - dimensional anderson models belonging to the conventional wd symmetry classes with the help of multifractal finite - size scaling using two methods : a simpler method for fixed @xmath51 leading to a single - variable scaling function , and a more complicated one for varying @xmath51 resulting in a two - variable scaling function .",
    "both methods confirmed the presence of multifractality in all three symmetry classes , and we obtained critical parameters listed in tabs .  [ tab : anderson_classes_fitres_lambda01 ] and  [ tab : anderson_classes_fitres_vary_lambda_chosen ] in aggreement with each other and with previous results known from the literature .",
    "the more complicated varying @xmath51 method provided more precise values for the critical parameters , listed in tab .",
    "[ tab : anderson_classes_fitres_vary_lambda_chosen ] , and significantly different critical exponents for the different wd symmetry classes .    applying the method of varying @xmath51 we also calculated the multifractal exponents , that basically fulfill the expected symmetry relation eq .",

    "( [ eq : anderson_classes_deltaexpansion_vary_lambda])([eq : anderson_classes_alphaexpansion_vary_lambda ] ) fulfill the expected relation @xmath55 giving a further confirmation for the validity of our results for the mfes listed in tab .  [",

    "we also compared the numerical results to available analytical estimates , and found in some cases similar , but in other cases opposite qualitative behavior for expansion coefficients for the orthogonal and the unitary classes .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that the numerical precision of our results should be used as tests for future renormalization or other type of expansion approximations .",
