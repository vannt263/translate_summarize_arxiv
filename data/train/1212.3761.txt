    "the early stage of galaxy evolution can be characterized by the following two properties : a poor metal abundance and a rich gas content .",
    "although galaxies at the early evolutionary stages exist at high redshift , nearby blue compact dwarf galaxies ( bcds ) are a unique category of galaxies that have those two properties in the nearby universe @xcite .",
    "some bcds are also experiencing the most active class of star formation with the formation of super star clusters ( sscs ) @xcite .",
    "this kind of intense star formation may also provide a relevant laboratory to understand the conditions in which high - redshift galaxies experience their first starburst episode .",
    "such intense star formation as seen in bcds is occurring in dense and compact regions and thus can only be traced with optically thin star formation indicators , such as far - infrared ( fir ) dust luminosity ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) and radio luminosity ( thermal free  free emission from h ii regions plus non - thermal synchrotron emission from accelerated electrons ) @xcite .",
    "these two luminosities are strongly correlated in nearby star - forming galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in our previous paper , ( * ?",
    "* hereafter h11 ) , we observed a well studied bcd , ii  zw  40 , with the submillimetre array ( sma ; @xcite ) . in this paper , we add two bcds , he 2 - 10 and ngc  5253 , both of which also host high star formation activities likely to be associated with the formation of sscs in the centre @xcite .",
    "the radio emission at wavelengths @xmath4 a few cm is optically thick for free  free absorption , supporting the existence of young compact regions before the expansion of h ii regions @xcite .",
    "cm ) , where the radiation is optically thin for free  free absorption as far as our sample is concerned ( sections [ subsec : he2 - 10][subsec : iizw40 ] ) . ]",
    "all these bcds are also classified as wolf - rayet galaxies : the wolf - rayet feature indicates that the typical age of the current starburst is a few myr @xcite .",
    "some of the conclusions derived from ii  zw  40 by h11 can be generalized by increasing the sample .",
    "h11 argues that free  free dominated submillimetre emission can be a characteristics of young active star formation .",
    "h11 has clarified that , if we focus on the central star - forming region in ii  zw  40 , free ",
    "free emission dominates even at 880  @xmath2 . considering that global submm luminosity is usually dominated by dust @xcite ,",
    "the dominance of free  free emission at 880 @xmath2 is a special characteristics , which should be examined with a larger sample .    by increasing the sample",
    ", we can also explore the metallicity dependence of various properties .",
    "the metallicity of the interstellar medium is a fundamental quantity characterizing the galaxy evolution because it reflects the enrichment in heavy elements by stellar generations .",
    "some metallicity effects are expected in the formation of dense star - forming regions : ( i ) dust - to - gas ratio in low metallicity objects is generally low @xcite , which implies that the star - forming regions are less embedded by dust in low - metallicity objects than in high - metallicity objects ; and ( ii ) in a low - metallicity ( i.e.  dust - poor ) environment , star formation is expected to be less efficient because of less shielding of ultraviolet ( uv ) heating photons by dust and molecular hydrogen @xcite .",
    "thus , we will address the metallicity dependence of dust abundance and star formation efficiency by investigating gas and dust emission in bcds .    in observing intense starbursts associated with the formation of sscs ,",
    "a high spatial resolution is crucial to spot the young star - forming component .",
    "while high - resolution data of the central star - forming regions in bcds are available through various radio interferometric observations with arcsecond resolutions ( 1 arcsec corresponds to 51 pc for he 2 - 10 and ii zw 40 , and 18 pc for ngc 5253 ) , information of fir  submm dust emission on such a small scale was lacking for bcds .",
    "we thus performed sma observations of a few bcds to resolve their submm emission .",
    "shorter wavelengths such as mid - infrared can achieve almost arcsecond resolutions by single - dish telescope facilities such as the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _",
    "infrared array camera @xcite and _ akari _ infrared camera @xcite , but the mid - infrared emission is dominated by stochastically heated very small grains @xcite , which are not representative of the total dust amount ( although it is empirically known that the mid - infrared luminosity is well correlated with the total dust luminosity in bcds ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we explain the observations and the data analysis in section  [ sec : obs ] . in section  [ sec :",
    "model ] , we derive basic quantities related to star formation and submm emission , and discuss radio  fir relation .",
    "we also analyze co(32 ) emission and derive the molecular gas mass , which is used to estimate the dust - to - gas ratio and the star formation efficiency . after discussing our observational results in section  [ sec : discussion ] ,",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we selected nearby bcds which host young compact starbursts . searching for objects feasible for the sky coverage and sensitivity of sma , we chose he  2 - 10 and ngc 5253 .",
    "they have similar properties to our previous object , ii  zw  40 , in h11 : ( i ) the ages of the central starbursts are young ( @xmath5 a few myr ) as indicated by the wolf - rayet feature @xcite and the stellar spectral synthesis models @xcite ; and ( ii ) they host optically thick compact free  free emission at wavelengths @xmath4 a few cm , indicating an intense starburst in a dense compact region @xcite . since he 2 - 10 has a higher metallicity than the other two galaxies , we may be able to obtain a hint for metallicity effects ( section [ sec : model ] ; see table [ tab : data ] for the observed metallicity values ) .",
    "the distances ( @xmath6 ) and velocities ( relative to the local standard of rest ; @xmath7 ) adopted in this paper are listed in table [ tab : data ] .",
    "the sma observations of he 2 - 10 and ngc 5253 were carried out in the 340 ghz ( 880 @xmath2 ) band on 2012 january 11 in the subcompact configuration .",
    "seven antennas were used with projected antenna separations between 9.5 and 45 m. the receivers have two sidebands , the lower and upper sidebands , which covered the frequency ranges from 330.8 to 334.8 ghz , and from 342.8 to 346.9 ghz , respectively .",
    "the visibility data were calibrated with the mir package . as a flux calibrator we used callisto ( with an adopted flux of 14.5 jy ) for he 2 - 10 , and titan ( with an adopted flux of 2.36 jy ) for ngc 5253 .",
    "we used quasars j0730@xmath8116 and j1337@xmath8129 as amplitude and phase calibrators for he  2 - 10 and ngc 5253 , respectively .",
    "we adopted quasar 3c279 as a band pass calibrator for both objects . in generating the continuum data",
    ", we excluded the chunk containing the co(32 ) emission at rest 345.796  ghz .",
    "the calibrated visibility data were imaged and cleaned with the miriad package .",
    "the synthesized beam has a full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of 5.7 arcsec @xmath9 4.4 arcsec ( @xmath10 ) with a major axis position angle of @xmath11 for he 2 - 10 and a fwhm of 6.7 arcsec @xmath9 4.1 arcsec ( @xmath12 ) with a major axis position angle of @xmath13 for ngc 5253 .",
    "the largest angular scale sampled by this observation is 19 arcsec .",
    "we also use the sma subcompact data of ii zw 40 in h11 ( see h11 for details ) .",
    "@xmath14 ii zw 40 and haro 2 (= mrk 33 ) are also included in @xcite s sample ( table [ tab : hunt ] ) .",
    "+ @xmath15 since @xmath16 is not available , we assume the mean value obtained in @xcite .",
    "+ @xmath17 since the flux given by @xcite is probably overestimated because of confusion with nearby sources , we replaced the value with an interferometric flux at 2 cm ( 15 ghz ) given by @xcite . + note : mrk 527 was originally included in the sample of @xcite .",
    "because of the suspected contamination of nearby sources , this galaxy is not included in our sample ."
