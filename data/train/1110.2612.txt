    ", one may predict future price that is in line with trend perceived from the historical price records .",
    "clearly , tf does not act in the market alone , it almost always occurs in combination with other ( contrarian , fundamentalist ) strategies  @xcite .",
    "the concept of trend may represent some practical way for indication , parametrization or quantification of the non - randomness .",
    "the analysis of tf efficiency may be applied to measure deviations of the time - series from randomness . when the trend line is subtracted from the original signal ,",
    "the residuals may be treated as stationary detrended data .",
    "various non - parametric trend - removal approaches for trend estimation in the presence of the fractal noise have been proposed and applied in  ( see e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "the comparison of the random walk oriented strategy against tf strategy has been discussed  in  @xcite .",
    "the work has reported observation that speculative price movements on commodity futures do move in a regular , as opposed to random manner .",
    "the inefficiency of fx market has been investigated by means of the _ statistical approximate entropy _",
    "similarly , the _ permutation entropy _ has been used to characterize stock market development  @xcite .",
    "the general aspects of tf trading strategy and related risk factors in the hedge fund activities are described in the work  @xcite .    in  @xcite the group of trend satisfying currencies has been selected to optimize the portfolio construction .",
    "note that in the above - mentioned work the trend is determined through the use of the multiple time frame moving averages  ( direction indicators ) applied simultaneously to meet an optimality criteria for forecast .",
    "concerning relative complexity of aforementioned methods , in this paper we suggest elementary tf strategy which uses only difference between two currency exchange rates separated by given time span called here _",
    "time scale_. in this form , tf is accomplished as a single parameter prediction method , where the time scale is the only free parameter . we have analyzed statistics of isolated discretized trends as well as trends embedded into tuples containing list of elements sequentially ordered with increasing time scale .",
    "we have used six years statistics ( 2004 - 2009 ) of eur / usd currency exchange rates .",
    "the original oanda broker database of tick - by - tick quotations have been transformed into evenly spaced 1 minute time series .",
    "the statistics of agents population proceeds over the _ ask _ currency rate records .        the trend is defined by simplest possible manner by comparison of actual currency exchange rate with preceding one . for @xmath0th time lag scale @xmath1 and time @xmath2",
    "we define @xmath3 where , @xmath4 is the ask rate at which the price - maker is willing to sell the currency . specifically , the time scale may be defined recurrently by @xmath5 the advantage of the above choice is that @xmath6 allows nonuniform coverage of the broad domain from the 1 minute to approximately two days with denser occupation of smaller scales",

    "the tuple @xmath11 may be alternatively viewed as instantaneous macrostate variable for the appropriate decision making of the autonomous agents . in the present approach , each agent",
    "is provided with the information about @xmath7 she / he extracts by measuring the change of the currency rate on its internal specific time scale @xmath1 .      from the fx trader s point - of - view , the currency changes may lead to three principally distinct situations which we suggest to be encoded by three - valued variable @xmath12 we call _ currency _ _ rate _ _ shift_. it is defined using discretization of exchange rate as follows @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the demand price of particular currency and @xmath15 is the time horizon for which the currency rate change is being transferred to its discrete form .",

    "the position is supposed to be held from time @xmath2 to @xmath16 .",
    "for example , in the case of short selling , the holding period @xmath15 refers to the time between borrowing a currency pair from brokerage , selling it to someone else and then buying it back later . a steep enough currency movement characterized by @xmath17 needs to choose appropriate fx operation .",
    "it allows the holder of the short position to earn profit from the sale ( @xmath18 ) or from buying ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "clearly , relatively small currency changes are converted to @xmath20 . in this case",
    ", the position opening ( at @xmath2 ) causes the loose because of the bid - ask spread . however , an important issue not discussed in the present work is the number of units in the trade .",
    "in this section we attempt to answer the question of the relevant time scales for which tf agents come closer to the correct prediction .",

    "[ mean_matching_figure ] .",
    "the testing of the effect of the counter - trend expresses that current trends can be broken at any time because of arrival of new market information .",
    "surprisingly , when @xmath26 is calculated for counter - trend the matching becomes larger compared to the matching average calculated for @xmath11 .         in the previous subsection , we studied relationship of single trend with @xmath25 .",
    "the logical extension of former efforts will be the study of the correspondence between `` action '' @xmath11 and `` response '' @xmath25 .",
    "the question arises if the compatibility of many trends ( their signs ) makes the correspondence more pronounced and satisfying . here",
    "we choose to be less demanding with respect of sign by focussing on the correspondence between the overall effect of trends quantified by the absolute value of instant mean @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the degree of @xmath32 , @xmath31 correspondence may be measured by the conditional average @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes the cardinality of the set of events selected according to threshold @xmath35 .",

    "[ collective_decision_figure ] shows the cumulative effect represented by @xmath38 .",
    "as we can see , the monotonicity of @xmath38 detectable for @xmath39 min becomes interrupted at @xmath40 min , where peak is observed .",
    "it seems rather counterintuitive that function @xmath38 is increasing in @xmath15 .",
    "this fact stems from the relative suppression of @xmath41 states at larger @xmath15 , where currency changes become excessive .      in this subsection",
    "we introduce measure which admits to analyze prediction abilities based on the trend tuples .",
    "the basic idea behind can be seen as continuity in the multivariate space of dimension @xmath42 .",
    "the dissimilarity between two trend tuples @xmath43 and @xmath44 measured at different moments @xmath45 may be expressed by means of _ hamming - like distance _",
    "@xmath46 where @xmath47 , and @xmath48 as @xmath49 .",
    "then the statistics may be represented by the histogram of @xmath50 differences @xmath51 note that summation is carried out only for pairs that satisfy constraint @xmath52 .",
    "the assumption of continuity implies monotonic increase of @xmath53 on the @xmath54 ( related to hamming - like distance ) as @xmath54 is sufficiently small .",
    "other words , similarity of the tuples should imply similarity in the currency rate shifts  ( see fig  [ pattern_comparison_figure ] ) .",
    "the data analysis show us that monotonicity takes place in the limited @xmath42 , @xmath15 parametric region only , while the combination of large @xmath15 with small @xmath42 better achieves the expected monotonicity of @xmath53",
    ".    we may conclude from this that character of fx data and trading data in general impose restrictions on the overall tuple size and only tuples of the restricted size may be efficient in the reducing of the forecast error @xmath55 .",
    "results obtained show that the best performance is achieved within the range @xmath56  ( only three @xmath42 are plotted due to lack of space ) .",
    "we investigated statistical properties of tf and multi - tf strategies .",
    "we started with elementary tf forms where information comes solely from the difference of two prices ( two currencies ) separated by the fixed time scale  ( delay ) .",
    "the study of statistics revealed clear non - suitability of naive trend estimator for the forecast purposes . according to the results obtained , the trend continuation is less good compared to the contrarian strategy of the trend turnover .",
    "similar and quite universal conclusion has been confirmed by the previous studies performed for different market data ( including e.g. commodities ) which span over different time scales .    the statistical analysis supported development and implementation of parallelized tf strategies",
    "build upon the tuple which consists of many trends for contributing time scales .",
    "we have shown that one may benefit from the prediction potential of such complex information structures , however , the vast majority of problems remain to be solved . the optimal inter - tuple distance in common with suitable multi - valued trend discretization which regards bid - ask spread could be essential ingredients required for success of such efforts .",
    "in such formulation nearly optimal @xmath42 may play the role of the _ embedding _ _ dimension _",
    "@xcite , i.e. minimum number of independent variables necessary to describe system .",
    "intuitively , the parameter @xmath42 optimized to produce most reliable forecast ( including optimization of @xmath15 scale ) may be different from the value of true embedding dimension .    in the future",
    ", it would be interesting to experiment with _ recurrence quantification _ _ analysis _",
