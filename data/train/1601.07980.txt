    "properties of the @xmath0 structure are systematically investigated for 27 transition elements from the viewpoints of thermodynamical and mechanical stability using first - principles calculations .",
    "the mechanical stability is investigated in terms of phonon frequencies .",
    "the occupation number for @xmath1 orbitals roughly determines relative energy and volume of the nm @xmath0 structure as well as the other investigated crystal structures ( bcc , fcc , and hcp ) . for the group 4 elements ( ti , zr , and hf ) , the @xmath0 structure is thermodynamically favorable and is mechanically stable . for the group 7 elements ( mn , tc , and re ) , the @xmath0 structure is also mechanically stable , but they are thermodynamically less favorable compared with the group 4 elements . for the elements in the groups 5 and 6 , the lattice constants of the @xmath0 structure are largely deviated from the values coherent with the bcc structure .",
    "several @xmath25 transition elements , namely fe , co , and ni , have the @xmath0 structure with nonzero magnetic moments . for the @xmath0 fe , the @xmath24 state is the lowest in energy among the magnetic states and is also mechanically stable .",
    "co and ni show the fm @xmath0 structure , and it is lower in energy than the nm state .",
    "energies of binary alloys composed of the elements in the group 4 and those in the groups 5 and 6 are estimated by linear interpolation .",
