    "a random graph is a set of nodes that are connected by random links @xcite .",

    "therefore , random graphs are equivalent to a mean - field percolation process @xcite .",
    "random graphs underlie many natural phenomena from polymerization @xcite to the spread of infectious diseases @xcite , and they are also used to model social networks @xcite as well as complexity of algorithms @xcite .",
    "the classical random graph has no restrictions on the degree of a node . in many situations ,",
    "the number of connections is limited , and specifically , the degree of each node must be bounded .",
    "examples include the percolating network of contacts in a bead pack @xcite , computer networks @xcite , and communication networks @xcite .",
    "we modify the canonical model for an evolving random graph @xcite by imposing a strict bound on the degree of a node @xcite . in an evolving random graph ,",
    "two nodes are picked at random , and regardless of their degrees , the nodes are connected by a link . at the end of this process , a complete graph forms . in this study , we focus on a constrained process where the two nodes are linked only if both degrees are smaller than @xmath0 . starting with a set of @xmath2 isolated nodes , the final state is a regular random graph @xcite , where all nodes have degree @xmath0 ( fig .  [ fig - process ] ) .",
    "the evolving graph includes two types of nodes , active nodes with degree smaller than the maximum , and inactive nodes with the maximal degree .",
    "we obtain the density of active nodes from the full degree distribution , which is shown to be a truncated poisson distribution .    in general ,",
    "the graph is a set of disjoint connected components @xcite . in each component ,",
    "any two nodes are connected by a path . as in classical random graphs",
    ", our graphs could be in one of two phases  a non - percolating phase where all components are finite , and a percolating phase where a single _ giant _ component with a macroscopic number of nodes coexists with finite components .",
    "the transition between these two phases occurs when the number of links exceeds a threshold .",
    "for example , when @xmath3 , the critical link density , @xmath4 , is @xmath5 when @xmath6 the final state consists of dimers , while when @xmath7 the final state includes multiple rings @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the system does not condense into a single component .",
    "we study the more interesting situation where the system undergoes a percolation transition and the final state is a fully connected graph .        as a result of the linking process",
    ", connected components undergo an aggregation process . in the traditional binary aggregation framework @xcite",
    ", connected components are characterized by the total number of nodes @xcite . in our process , however , this minimal description does not lead to closed evolution equations .",
    "instead , we describe clusters by the total number of nodes of degree @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath0 . this complete description naturally lends itself to closed evolution equations .",
    "we use the elegant hamilton - jacobi method to obtain a formal solution for the density of connected components , and find the percolation thresholds from this solution .",
    "we also use the degree distribution to illuminate the behavior during the late stages of the evolution .",
    "the regular random graph forms via a two - step process .",
    "first , the giant component takes over the entire system .",
    "this step occurs after @xmath11 linking attempts , with @xmath12 . at this point ,",
    "only a small minority of the nodes in the giant component remain active .",
    "the total number of active nodes , @xmath13 , scales logarithmically with system size , @xmath14 eventually all nodes become inactive , and the regular random graph is complete .",
    "the number of linking attempts required to reach this final state is proportional to the system size .",
    "hence , the evolution of the regular random graph is much slower than the evolution of the classical random graph , where @xmath11 is logarithmic in @xmath2 @xcite .",

    "we discuss the results in section [ disc ] . in appendix",
    "a , we rederive relevant properties of classical random graphs using the hamilton - jacobi method .",
    "we study a random process that generates a regular random graph .",
    "the process starts at time @xmath15 with @xmath2 disconnected nodes . at each elementary step ,",
    "two nodes are chosen at random .",
    "if the degrees of the two nodes are both smaller than @xmath0 , a new link connects them ; otherwise , no link is added .",
    "time is augmented by @xmath16 after each linking attempt , , so that every node participates in one linking attempt per unit time , on average . linking is repeatedly attempted until a regular random graph forms ( fig .  [ fig - process ] ) .",
    "there are two types of nodes  active nodes with degree smaller than @xmath0 and inactive nodes with degree equal to @xmath0 . a new link between two active nodes of degrees @xmath17 and @xmath18 augments the degrees : @xmath19 this random process occurs with unit rate .",
    "the linking process transforms the system from a set of active nodes into a set of inactive nodes , as illustrated on fig .",
    "[ fig - process ] .",
    "let @xmath20 be the degree distribution , that is , the fraction of nodes with degree @xmath21 at time @xmath22 .",

    "equations are nonlinear because is a two - body process . yet",

    "[ fig - nt ] . as expected , the density of isolated nodes , @xmath38 , declines monotonically , while the density of inactive nodes , @xmath39 , increases monotonically .",
    "isolated nodes initially dominate , then nodes with degree one are most numerous , and eventually , inactive nodes take the lead for good .",
    "the average degree , @xmath40 , characterizes the overall connectivity .",
    "since every link connects two nodes , the density of links , @xmath41 , is proportional to the average degree , @xmath42 . by multiplying by @xmath21 and summing over @xmath21 ,",
    "we see that the average degree satisfies @xmath43 using the initial and final values , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , we have the integral identity @xmath46 .",
    "every node belongs to a connected component , or `` cluster '' .",
    "initially , there are @xmath2 clusters , and eventually , a single cluster remains .",
    "the number of clusters dwindles as a result of a cluster - cluster aggregation @xcite process : any link between two active nodes in separate clusters merges the two clusters .",
    "since the aggregation rate depends on the total number of _ active _ nodes , characterization of clusters by their total size is insufficient . adding the number of active nodes as a second variable does not lead to a closed description either , because the number of active nodes may change once a link is added .",
    "therefore , we use a complete description and characterize clusters by @xmath47dimensional vectors @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the number of nodes of degree @xmath21 .",
    "the cluster size , @xmath50 , is simply .",
    "finite clusters are typically trees @xcite .",
    "since there are links in a tree of size @xmath50 , we have the constraint @xmath51 in particular , minimal clusters with trivially satisfy this condition .    as a result of the linking process",

    ", the vector @xmath53 describes the degree augmentation @xmath54 , @xmath55 the aggregation rate @xmath56 in equals the product of the number of nodes of degree @xmath57 in the first cluster and the number of nodes of degree @xmath21 in the second cluster .",
    "the density @xmath58 of clusters with `` size '' @xmath59 at time @xmath22 obeys the rate equation @xmath60 where @xmath24 is the density of active nodes . henceforth , the time dependence is implicit .",
    "the gain term directly reflects the aggregation process , and the factor @xmath61 prevents over - counting .",
    "the loss rate is proportional to the total number of active nodes in the cluster , as well as the density of active nodes in the entire system .",
    "a crucial feature of the above rate equation is that the gain term and the loss term are different in nature .",
    "the gain term , which describes creation of clusters with finite size , is proportional to the product of cluster densities .",
    "the loss term , which describes loss of finite clusters due to linking , is proportional to the product of the cluster density and the total density of active nodes in the entire system , which does take into account the giant component , if one exists .",
    "for this reason , the rate equation is valid in the non - percolating phase as well as in the percolating phase .    in terms of the time variable @xmath31 ,",
    "the loss term becomes linear @xmath62 the initial condition is @xmath63 .",
    "the rate equations for the cluster size distribution are nonlinear , in contrast with the linear equations for the degree distribution",
    ". moreover , the rate equations are substantially more challenging than those previously analyzed in studies of multivariate aggregation processes @xcite .",
    "the generating function approach is generally useful in aggregation problems @xcite , and in our case , we must use the multivariate generating function @xmath64 here @xmath65 and @xmath66 is a shorthand for the product of monomials . multiplying by @xmath67 and performing the summation over @xmath59 , we find that the generating function evolves according to @xmath68 the initial condition is @xmath69",
    "the generating function satisfies a non - linear partial differential equation ( pde ) with non - constant coefficients .",
    "crucially , equation is a _ first - order _ pde , and hence , it can be reduced to a set of coupled ordinary differential equations ( odes ) by applying the method of characteristics @xcite .",
    "this is a significant simplification as a pde is essentially a collection of infinitely many odes .",
    "moreover , in the present case , we conveniently treat the governing equation as a _ hamilton - jacobi _ equation , thereby bypassing the method of characteristics @xcite .",
    "then , the canonical hamilton equations coincide with the equations for the characteristics .",
    "first , we convert into a hamilton - jacobi equation @xmath70 and view @xmath71 and @xmath72 as `` action '' and `` hamiltonian '' , respectively .",

    "one of the coordinates does not change , @xmath97 . we may integrate and solve for the final coordinate @xmath98 as a function of the initial coordinate @xmath99 . yet , as shown below , we need to solve the inverse problem  find @xmath99 as a function of @xmath98 .",
