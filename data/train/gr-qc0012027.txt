    "on account of the super - kamiokande atmospheric neutrino experiment , which confirmed a nonvanishing mass for the neutrino  @xcite , the neutrino oscillation problem became an even hotter topic in high energy physics , both from the experimental and from the theoretical points of view  @xcite .",
    "as a natural extension to this problem , many authors consider the neutrino oscillation in the presence of gravitation , that is , in a curved spacetime .",
    "this means to extend the physics related to the neutrino oscillation in a minkowski spacetime with lorentz invariance , to a riemannian spacetime with the usual invariance under general coordinate transformation .",
    "the gravitational effect on the neutrino oscillation has attracted much attention recently  @xcite in the framework of general relativity , although a lot of problems concerning the understanding of the gravitationally induced neutrino oscillation still persists .",
    "however many alternative mechanisms have been proposed to account for the gravitational effect on the neutrino oscillation ; _",
    "e.g. _ the equivalence principle and neutrino oscillation  @xcite . as a further theoretical exploration ,",
    "more recently torsion induced neutrino oscillation in @xmath0 spacetime @xcite with both curvature and torsion is also proposed  @xcite . in this article , we extend the neutrino oscillation problem into the spacetime with torsion but without curvature , _",
    "i.e. _ in a weitzenbck spacetime @xmath1 @xcite , in the framework of new general relativity ( ngr)@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we briefly introduce the gravitational theory in weitzenbck spacetime . in sec .",
    "iii we compare dirac equations in riemaniann spacetime and in weitzenbck spacetime , and in sec .",
    "we derive the evolutionary equation of the neutrino oscillation amplitude in weitzenbck spacetime .",
    "we set @xmath2 throughout this article .",
    "the new general relativity is a parallel tetrad gravitational theory , which is formulated on a weitzenbck spacetime @xcite .",
    "it is characterized by the vanishing curvature tensor and by the torsion tensor formed of four parallel tetrad vector fields .",
    "namely , the gravitational field appears as the nontrivial part of the tetrad field .",
    "we will use the greek alphabet ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 ,  @xmath6 ) to denote tensor indices , that is , indices related to spacetime . the latin alphabet ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 ,  @xmath6 ) will be used to denote local lorentz ( or tangent space ) indices .",
    "of course , being of the same kind , tensor and local lorentz indices can be changed into each other with the use of the tetrad , denoted by @xmath10 , and supposed to satisfy h^a _",
    "h_a^ = _ ^ ; h^a",
    "_ h_b^ = ^a_b .",
    "[ orto ]    as is known , curvature and torsion are properties of a connection@xcite , and many different connections may be defined on the same space .",

    "= _ a b h^a _ h^b _ , [ gmn ] in terms of which the levi  civita connection ^ _ = g^ [ lci ] can be introduced .",
    "its curvature ^ _ = _ ^ _ + ^ _ ^ _ - ( ) , [ rbola ] according to general relativity , accounts exactly for the gravitational interaction . owing to the universality of gravitation , which means that all particles feel @xmath12 the same , it turns out possible to describe the gravitational interaction by considering a riemann spacetime with the curvature of the levi  civita connection , in which all particles will follow geodesics .",
    "this is the stage set of einstein s general relativity , the gravitational interaction being mimicked by a geometrization of spacetime .    on the other hand , a nontrivial tetrad field",
    "can also be used to define the linear cartan connection ^ _",

    "if now we try to introduce a spacetime with the same properties of the cartan connection @xmath13 , we end up with a weitzenbck spacetime  @xcite , a space presenting torsion , but no curvature .",
    "this spacetime is the stage set of the teleparallel description of gravitation .",
    "considering that local lorentz indices are raised and lowered with the minkowski metric @xmath14 , tensor indices on it will be raised and lowered with the riemannian metric @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "universality of gravitation , in this case , means that all particles feel @xmath13 the same , which in turn means that they will also feel torsion the same .    from the above considerations",
    ", we can infer that the presence of a nontrivial tetrad field induces both , a riemannian and a teleparallel structures in spacetime .",
    "the first is related to the levi  civita connection , a connection presenting curvature , but no torsion .",
    "the second is related to the cartan connection , a connection presenting torsion , but no curvature .",
    "it is important to remark that both connections are defined on the very same spacetime , a spacetime endowed with both a riemannian and a teleparallel structures .    as already remarked , the curvature of the cartan connection vanishes identically : ^ _ = _ ^ _ + ^ _ ^ _ - ( ) 0 .",
