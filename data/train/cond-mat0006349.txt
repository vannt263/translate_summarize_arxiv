    "microscopic quantum superpositions are an everyday physicist s experience .",
    "macroscopic quantum superpositions , despite nearly a century of experimentation with quantum mechanics , are still encountered only very rarely .",
    "fast decoherence of macroscopically distinct states is to be blamed @xcite . in spite of that , recent years were a witness to an interesting quantum optics experiment @xcite on decoherence of a few photon superpositions .",
    "moreover , matter - wave interference in fullerene @xmath0 has been observed @xcite .",
    "another experiment has succeeded in `` engineering '' the environment in the context of trapped ions @xcite .",
    "recently the first detection of a macroscopic schrdinger cat state in an rf - squid was reported @xcite .",
    "all these successes tempt one to push similar investigations of basic quantum mechanics into the rapidly progressing field of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of alkali metal atomic vapors @xcite the condensates can contain up to @xmath1 atoms in the same quantum state . what is more , it is possible to prepare condensates in two different internal states of the atoms .",
    "some of these pairs of internal levels are immiscible , and their condensates tend to phase separate into distinct domains with definite internal states @xcite .",
    "the immiscibility seems to be a prerequisite to prepare a quantum superposition in which all atoms are in one or the other internal state , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the total number of condensed atoms .",
    "there are at least two theoretical proposals how to prepare a macroscopic quantum superposition in this framework @xcite .",
    "other proposals involve non - unitary evolution of the bec towards the schrdinger cat state by means of continuous quantum measurements @xcite .",
    "neither of these proposals addresses the crucial question of decoherence .",
    "this paper is a simplified and more pedagogical version of our previous work @xcite .",
    "all technical details of the calculations , in particular the computation of the decoherence rate for the bec superposition state , can be found in that reference .",
    "let us first make a short summary of some of the ideas for creating quantum superposition states of bose - eintein condensates .",
    "the methods that have been thus far proposed start with two weakly interacting dilute bose condensates of atoms in different internal states .",
    "let us call these internal states @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "atoms interact through s - wave collisions , characterized by a single parameter @xmath6 which is known as the scattering length .",
    "we shall consider the case of repulsive interaction @xmath7 ; it is known that for the opposite case the condensate is unstable above a critical total number of particles .",
    "it is assumed that the inter - scattering lengths for collisions @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the same , i.e. @xmath10 , which is in general different from the intra - scattering length @xmath11 .",
    "when the self - energy of atom - atom interactions of the bec is much less than the mode energy spacing , then one can treat the condensate in the two - mode approximation .",
    "moreover , the condensate is shined with a appropriately chosen laser that introduces a josephson - like coupling of strength @xmath12 that interchanges internal atomic states in a coherent manner .",
    "the condensate two - mode hamiltonian is    @xmath13    here @xmath14 is the energy of the lowest single - particle state in the trap ( assumed to be the same for @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "this hamiltonian was studied in great detail in @xcite .",
    "the precise quantum state of the condensate for all values of @xmath17 and @xmath18 was studied by means of a wigner - like distribution on the two - mode bloch sphere .",
    "it was found that when the repulsion between atoms in different states is bigger that the repulsion between atoms in the same state , that is when @xmath19 , then the condensate tends to phase separate in space into distinct domains with definite internal states .",
    "this condition is known as the immiscibility condition .",
    "more importantly , the ground state of the system is a quantum superposition state .",
    "when the `` purity '' factor defined as @xmath20 is much less than one , then the lowest energy subspace contains two macroscopic superpositions    @xmath21 \\ ; |0,0\\rangle     \\equiv     \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 } } ( |n,0\\rangle + |0,n\\rangle ) \\;\\;,\\nonumber\\\\ & & |-\\rangle=     \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\;n ! } } [ ( a^{\\dagger})^n - ( b^{\\dagger})^n ] \\ ; |0,0\\rangle     \\equiv     \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 } } ( |n,0\\rangle - |0,n\\rangle ) \\;\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the lower @xmath22 and the higher @xmath23 states are separated by a small energy gap of @xmath24 . in the extreme case of @xmath25 ( no laser applied )",
    "the two states are completely degenerate .",
    "if we just have @xmath26 , the @xmath27 states in fact contain an admixture of intermediate states @xmath28 such that their overlap is @xmath29    which does not correspond to a macroscopic superposition . from now on we assume the pure case , @xmath30 .",
    "the proposal of gordon and savage @xcite for obtaining these superposition states is similar to a typical experiment in quantum optics with non - linear systems . in the bec case ,",
    "the non - linearity is provided by the collisional interactions and the josephson coupling .",
    "the idea is to prepare an initial state with all the atoms in the same internal state and then turn on the josephson coupling for some amount of time adequately chosen .",
    "after the josephson coupling is turned off , the quantum state of the system has been modified , and a schrdinger cat state has been formed . other proposals for obtaining basically the same kind of superposition use a continuous quantum measurement process @xcite .",
    "as we have already mentioned , neither of the proposals for generating quantum superpositions in bec addresses the crucial question of decoherence .",
    "in fact , the condensate is an open quantum system which is in contact with an environment of non - condensed thermal particles .",
    "this interaction may be responsible for the loss of coherence between the components of the quantum superposition states of the previous section .",
    "if the decoherence time is very small , then the existence of these states in bec would be merely of academic interest , since the expectations of observing them in the lab would vanish .",
    "therefore it is important to understand how the thermal cloud affects the longevity of the bec cats .",
    "the hamiltonian for the dilute environment formed by non - condensed particles is    @xmath31\\;.\\ ] ]    @xmath32 is the single particle energy of level @xmath33 .",
    "after the transformation    @xmath34    @xmath35 adopts a diagonal form    @xmath36\\;.\\ ] ]    in figure 1 we make a schematic plot of the energy levels of the non - condensed system before ( @xmath37 ) and after ( @xmath38 ) applying the josephson coupling .",
    "for simplicity we consider an isotropic harmonic trap with a dip in its center , where the condensate particles will be localized ( we shall return to this point later ) .",
    "we see that when the laser coupling is applied , the states @xmath39 ( which are symmetric under the exchange @xmath40 ) and the states @xmath41 ( which are antisymmetric under the same exchange ) feel the same , but shifted , trapping potentials .",
    "the two ladders of energy eigenstates of the environment are separated by a gap equal to @xmath42 .",
    "each of the levels is occupied according to the thermal bose distribution . when the gap is much bigger that the typical thermal energy @xmath43 , then the antisymmetric states are unoccupied .",
    "we will see in the next section that this is a prerequisite for reducing decoherence .",
    "condensed atoms interact with non - condensed atoms via two - body collisions .",
    "the exact interaction hamiltonian @xmath44 can be easily obtained from the total ( gross - pitaevskii like ) hamiltonian    @xmath45 , \\ ] ]    after splitting the quantum fields @xmath46 and @xmath47 into condensate and bath parts , i.e.    @xmath48    where @xmath49 is the wave function of the condensate localized in the dip . after introducing the symmetric and antisymmetric operators @xmath39 and @xmath41 for the thermal bath , the interaction hamiltonian can be splitted into two terms , @xmath50 , which are respectively symmetric and antisymmetric under the interchange @xmath40 of system operators . for the sake of conciseness",
    ", we shall refrain from writing down the whole expressions for these two interaction hamiltonians .",
    "suffice it to say that each of them has two possible energy - conserving interaction verteces , both proportional to the interaction couplings @xmath51 or @xmath52 :    * there are inelastic two - body collisions that do not conserve the number of condensed particles ( condensate feeding and depletion processes ) .",
    "there are in turn two possible diagrams for these processes , and they are shown in figure 2 .",
    "the first one is proportional to the occupation number of initial non - condensed states ; since each occupation number is proportional to fugacity @xmath53 ( where @xmath54 is the inverse temperature of the thermal bath and @xmath55 its chemical potential ) , then the diagram is @xmath56 .",
    "the second one is proportional to the occupation number of the initial non - condensed state ( that is , proportional to @xmath57 ) , and energy conservation brings about another fugacity factor , so the final result is that this diagram is also @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "* there are elastic two - body collisions that conserve the number of condensed particles , and are shown in figure 3 .",
    "these diagrams are proportional to fugacity , @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "when fugacity is small ( which occurs when the gap between the condensate and non - condensate single - particle levels is bigger that the thermal energy @xmath59 ) , then the elastic processes dominate over the inelastic ones .",
    "the elastic collisions are also the most relevant ones in the computation of the decoherence rate , since we shall see that their contribution scales as @xmath60 ( with @xmath3 the total number of particles in the condensate ) , whereas the inelastic contribution scales as @xmath3 . for these reasons , from now on we shall concentrate only on the elastic processes .",
    "as we have mentioned in section iii , when @xmath43 the antisymmetric environmental states are nearly empty . only the symmetric states are occupied .",
    "since these latter states can not distinguish between @xmath4 and @xmath5 , all collisions that involve symmetric non - condensed states will not destroy the quantum phase coherence between the schrdinger cat s components .",
    "we refer to this condition as the perfect symmetrization limit . in this case , the states @xmath61 span a decoherence - free pointer subspace ( also known in the literature as decoherence - free subspace or , for short , dfs ) of the hilbert space , since they have degenerate eigenvalues of the interaction hamiltonian @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "any state of that subspace can be written as @xmath62 , with @xmath63 and @xmath54 complex numbers .",
    "if @xmath64}$ ] denotes a projector onto that subspace , then    @xmath65 } ] = 0 ,   \\label{conmut}\\ ] ]    which means that any quantum superposition @xmath66 in the subspace is an eigenstate of the interaction hamiltonian ( a perfect pointer state ) , and as such will retain its phase coherence and last forever .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian between the condensate and the thermal cloud is a sum of products of condensate operators and environmental operators .",
    "only terms with symmetric environmental operators are relevant because the antisymmetric states are empty .",
    "the total hamiltonian is symmetric with respect to @xmath67 so , to preserve this symmetry , the relevant terms with symmetric environmental operators also contain symmetric condensate operators .",
    "the argument simplifies a lot for small fugacity where there is only one leading term with the @xmath68 condensate operator .",
    "the states @xmath27 are its eigenstates with the same eigenvalue @xmath3 .",
    "they are also ( almost ) degenerate eigenstates of the condensate hamiltonian build out of @xmath69 .",
    "the coherent transitions @xmath70 break this degeneracy of @xmath27 but the difference of their eigenfrequencies is negligible as compared to the usual condensate lifetime of @xmath71s . in the next - to - leading order in fugacity",
    "there are symmetric interaction terms which change the number of condensed atoms .",
    "these terms drive the @xmath72 and @xmath73 states into slightly `` squeezed - like '' states @xmath74 and @xmath75 respectively @xcite .",
    "there are also terms which exchange @xmath4 with @xmath5 .",
    "they give each state a small admixture of the opposite component .",
    "superpositions of these are still decoherence - free pointer subspaces - there are no relevant antisymmetric operators to destroy their quantum coherence .",
    "when the antisymmetric environmental states begin to be occupied , then the commutation relation ( [ conmut ] ) is only approximate and states within the subspace will decohere .",
    "hence we must face the problem of calculating decoherence rates due to interactions with the environment .",
    "we shall first consider the case of @xmath25 , which corresponds to no josephson - coupling being applied , and for which the two states @xmath76 are exactly degenerate with respect to the condensate hamiltonian . in this case",
    "there is no difference between symmetric and antisymmetric environmental states . after some long but straightforward calculation which involves computing the master equation for the reduced density matrix of the condensed particles ( see @xcite for details ) , we find a lower bound for the decoherence rate    @xmath77    where @xmath3 is a number of condensed atoms , @xmath78 is a thermal velocity in the noncondensed thermal cloud , @xmath6 is a scattering length , @xmath44 is a volume of the trap , and @xmath79 is a number of atoms in the thermal cloud ,    @xmath80    this is a lower estimate since we have only considered terms to leading order in fugacity @xmath58 and to leading order in condensate size @xmath81 .",
    "next - to - leading order terms are @xmath56 and @xmath82 , in agreement with refs .",
    "@xcite , so they were neglected here . even without going into details of our derivation",
    "it is easy to understand where a formula like eq.([dr ] ) comes from .",
    "@xmath60 is the main factor which makes the decoherence rate large .",
    "it comes from the master equation of the bloch - lindblad form @xmath83 $ ] , with @xmath84 and @xmath85 the two internal states of the atoms .",
    "@xmath60 is the distance squared between macroscopically different components of the superposition @xmath86 - the common wisdom reason why macroscopic objects are classical @xcite .",
    "the factor in brackets in eq.([dr ] ) is a scattering rate of a condensate atom on noncondensate atoms - the very process by which the thermal cloud environment learns the quantum state of the system .",
    "let us estimate the decoherence rate for a set of typical parameters : @xmath87k , @xmath88hz , and @xmath89 nm . the thermal velocity is @xmath90 m/s . the volume of the trap can be approximated by @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is a return point in a harmonic trap at the energy of @xmath93 .",
    "we estimate the decoherence time as @xmath94 . for @xmath95 and @xmath96 it can range from @xmath97s down to @xmath98s . for @xmath99",
    "our ( over-)estimate for @xmath100 is large .",
    "however , already for @xmath101 and @xmath102 ( which are still within the limits of validity of the two - mode approximation ) @xmath100 shrinks down to milliseconds . given that our @xmath100 is an upper estimate and that big condensates are more interesting as schrdinger cats , it is clear that for the sake of cat s longevity , one must go beyond the standard harmonic trap setting .",
    "from eqs.([dr],[ne ] ) it is obvious that the decoherence rate depends a lot on temperature and on chemical potential .",
    "the two factors strongly influence both @xmath79 and @xmath103 .",
    "both can be improved by the following scenario , which is a combination of present day experimental techniques . in the experiment of ref.@xcite",
    "a narrow optical dip was superposed at the bottom of a wide magnetic trap .",
    "the parameters of the dip were tuned so that it had just one bound state .",
    "the gap between this single condensate mode and the first excited state was @xmath104k , which at @xmath87k gives a fugacity of @xmath105 .",
    "we need the gap so that we can use the single mode approximation . at low temperatures , the gap results in a small fugacity , which is convenient for calculations .",
    "we propose to prepare a condensate inside a similar combination of a wide magnetic and a narrow optical trap ( or more generally : a wide well plus a narrow dip with a single bound mode ) and then to open the magnetic trap and let the noncondensed atoms disperse .",
    "the aim is to get rid of the thermal cloud as much as possible .",
    "a similar technique was used in the experiment of ref.@xcite ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "let us estimate the ultimate limit for the efficiency of this technique .",
    "at the typical initial temperature of @xmath106k the thermal velocity of atoms is @xmath107 m/s .",
    "an atom with this velocity can cross a @xmath106 m dip in @xmath108s .",
    "if we wait for , say , @xmath109s after opening the wide trap , then all atoms with velocities above @xmath110 m/s will disperse away from the dip .",
    "a thermal velocity of @xmath110 m/s corresponds to the temperature of @xmath111k . as the factor @xmath112 in eq.([dr ] )",
    ", then already @xmath109s after opening the wide trap the decoherence rate due to non - condensed atoms is reduced by a factor of @xmath113 !",
    "it is not realistic to expect such a  cosmological \" reduction factor .",
    "the  dip \" which is left after the wide harmonic trap is gone could be , for example , a superposition of an ideal dip plus a wide shallow well ( which was a negligible perturbation in presence of the wide harmonic trap ) .",
    "the well would have a band of width @xmath114 of bound states which would not disperse but preserve their occupation numbers from before the opening of the wide trap",
    ". they would stay in contact with the condensate and continue to `` monitor '' its quantum state . even if such a truncated environment happens to be already relatively harmless , there are means to do better than that .",
    "further reduction of the decoherence rate can be achieved by  symmetrization \" of the environmental states . to this end",
    "we propose to turn on the josephson - like coupling @xmath12 in order to induce coherent transitions from states a and b. this has already been achieved experimentaly @xcite ; in their case @xmath115 .",
    "when @xmath116 we are in the perfect symmetrization limit , and hence no decoherence takes place .",
    "indeed , the symmetric and antisymmetric @xmath114-bands of states can be visualized as two ladders shifted with respect to each other by @xmath42 .",
    "in other words , the two sets of states feel the same , but shifted , trapping potentials .",
    "when @xmath116 , then the antisymmetric @xmath41 s are nearly empty since they can evaporate into symmetric states and then leave the trap .",
    "the symmetric @xmath39 s can not distinguish between @xmath4 and @xmath5 so they do not destroy the quantum coherence between the schrdinger cat s components .",
    "after symmetrization , @xmath79 in eq.([dr ] ) has to be replaced by the final number of atoms in the antisymmetric states only ;    @xmath117    here @xmath118 is the temperature before opening the wide trap .",
    "@xmath119 is the number of antisymmetric bound states which remain within the @xmath120-band of symmetric states .",
    "atoms in these antisymmetric bound states can not disperse away . for @xmath121",
    "this number @xmath119 is zero and there is no decoherence from the thermal cloud .    in figure 5",
    "we make a schematic graph of the steps we propose to engineer the trap in order to reduce decoherence due to the thermal cloud .",
    "interaction with the thermal atoms is not the only source of decoherence for the quantum superposition state of the condensate . among other possible sources we can mention :    * ambient magnetic fields : the condensed atoms have magnetic moments .",
    "if the magnetic moments of a and b were different the magnetic field would distinguish between them and would introduce an unknown phase into the quantum superposition , thus rendering its underlying coherent nature undetectable .",
    "fortunately the much used @xmath122 states of @xmath123rb have the same magnetic moments . for them",
    "the magnetic field is a  symmetric \" environment .",
    "* different scattering lengths : there is a typical @xmath124 difference between the @xmath8 and @xmath9 scattering lengths .",
    "the condensate hamiltonian is not perfectly symmetric under @xmath70 . even for a perfectly symmetrized environment , symmetric environmental operators couple to not fully symmetric condensate operators",
    "this means that for the @xmath125 difference of scattering lengths symmetrization can improve decoherence time by at most two orders of magnitude as compared to the unsymmetrized environment . * three - body losses : due to collisions involving three particles , the condensate is not stable but loses atoms via recombination into molecular states .",
    "hence a condensate has a finite lifetime , of the order of @xmath126s .",
    "the atoms which escape from the condensate carry information about its quantum state .",
    "they destroy its quantum coherence . in the experiment of ref.@xcite",
    "the measured loss rate per atom was @xmath127s for @xmath128 or around @xmath109 atom per @xmath129s .",
    "the last rate scales like @xmath130 so already for @xmath131 just one atom is lost per second ; decoherence time is @xmath109s .",
    "one possibility for increasing this decoherence time is to increase slightly the dip radius .",
    "the loss rate scales like density squared so an increase in the dip width by a factor of @xmath132 reduces the loss rate by a factor of @xmath133 .",
    "the aim of this paper was to discuss the `` longevity '' of schrdinger cats in bec s .",
    "we have shown that while in the standard traps decoherence rates are significant enough to prevent long - lived macroscopic superpositions of internal states of the condensate , the strategy of trap engineering and symmetrization of the environment will be able to deal with that issue .",
    "what remains to be considered is how one can generate such macroscopic quantum superposition , and how one can detect it .",
    "the issue of generation was already touched upon in refs .",
    "we have little to add to this .",
    "however , in the context of the gordon and savage proposal , it is fairly clear that the time needed to generate the cat state would have to be short compared to the decoherence time .",
    "if our estimates of eq.([dr ] ) are correct , symmetrization procedure appears necessary for the success of such schemes .",
    "detection of schrdinger cat states is perhaps a more challenging subject . in principle , states of the form @xmath134 have a character of ghz states , and one could envision performing measurements analogous to those suggested in @xcite and carried out in @xcite , where a 4-atom entangled state was studied .",
    "however , this sort of parity - check strategy , appropriate for @xmath135 , is likely to fail when @xmath3 is larger , or when ( as would be the case for the `` quasi - squeezed '' states anticipated here @xcite ) @xmath3 is not even well defined .",
    "a strong circumstantial evidence can be nevertheless obtained from two measurements .",
    "the first one would consist of a preparation of the cat state , and of a measurement of the internal states of the atoms .",
    "it is expected that in each instance all ( to within the experimental error ) would turn up to be in either a or b states . however , averaged over many runs , the number of either of these two alternatives would be approximately equal .",
    "decoherence in which the environment also `` monitors '' the internal state of the atoms in the a versus b basis would not influence this prediction .",
    "we need to check separately whether the cat state was indeed coherent . to do this",
    ", one could evolve the system `` backwards '' .",
    "however , this is not really necessary . for , as gordon and savage point out , when , in their scheme , we let the system evolve unitarily for more or less twice the time needed for the generation of the cat state , it will approximately return to the initial configuration .",
    "thus , we can acquire strong evidence of the coherence of the cat provided that this unitary return to the initial configuration can be experimentally confirmed .",
    "these are admittedly rather vague ideas , which serve more as a `` proof of principle '' rather than as a blueprint for an experiment .",
    "nevertheless , they may , we hope , encourage more concrete investigation of such issues with a specific experiment in mind .",
    "we are indebted to e.cornell , r.onofrio , e.timmermans , and especially to j.anglin for very useful comments .",
