    "our inference of the galaxy stellar mass buildup as a function of mass ( called here ghets ) consists of two main steps : ( 1 ) we find an analytical functionality for ( , @xmath0 ) , and ( 2 ) after generating the halo mahs , ( @xmath0 ) , we combine them with ( , @xmath0 ) to infer the ghets , ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "our starting point is the determination of ( , @xmath0 ) up to the highest redshift as possible .",
    "as mentioned in section 1 , such a relationship has been recently constrained up to @xmath25 by using the statistical formalism of matching one - to - one the cumulative theoretical  @xmath12 to the observed cumulative  at different @xmath11s : @xmath26 ( e.g. , moster et al .",

    "we will use the results from bcw10 , who started from an assumed parametric expression for ( , @xmath0 ) and explored the parameter space , including uncertainties and sample variance , with a monte carlo markov chain technique to fit jointly the  observed at different @xmath11s ( they actually carried out this analysis separately for two redshift ranges : @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) .",
    "the authors have estimated and carefully taken into account all kind of uncertainties , which introduce significant scatter in the   relations and affect even the shape of these relations ( see   3.3 for a discussion ) .    the observational input used in bcw10 is the total local  obtained in li & white ( 2009 ) from sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data , and the total  at higher redshifts ( up to @xmath29 ) homogeneously obtained in prez - gonzlez et al .",
    "( 2008 ) . for the halo mass function ,",
    "bcw10 used the results from n - body cosmological simulations by tinker et al .",
    "since these @xmath12s refer only to distinct halos , a correction by the sub - halo abundance was introduced ( see details in bcw10 ) .",
    "the mass of the subhalo is fixed as that one at the time of accretion into the halo , @xmath30 , but the satellite galaxy s  is associated with the current , i.e. , it is implicitly assumed that the satellite s  will continue to evolve in the same way as for centrals of halo mass @xmath30 ( the effect of fixing instead the satellite mass  at the redshift of accretion has virtually no effect on the overall ",
    "relation as checked in bcw10 ) .",
    "thus , the ( , @xmath0 ) relationship used here refers to the _ overall _ galaxy population at each epoch , and this _ includes _ satellite galaxies , though under the assumptions mentioned above for this sub - population . on the one hand , there are some hints that the ",
    "relation of only satellite galaxies should not differ significantly from the overall relation ( wang et al .",
    "2006 ) . on the other hand , satellites are not a dominant population at any epoch , in particular at high redshifts . therefore , even if its ",
    "relation is quite peculiar , its effect over the average   relation is expected to be negligible . for more details on the assumptions and role of uncertainties in the inference of the ( , @xmath0 ) relationship we refer the reader to the original work by bcw10 ( see also  ",
    "it is worth mentioning that bcw10 refer to their   relations as corresponding to `` central '' galaxies .",
    "this should be understood in the sense that for each ( sub)halo is considered only the  of one galaxy , the central one , but not in the sense that the satellite galaxy population has been excluded from the analysis ( see above ) .",
    "a ( sub)halo may contain more galaxies besides the central one ( satellites ) . therefore , the total stellar mass within the ( sub)halo will be larger if we account for satellites . in bcw10",
    "it was shown that the inclusion of satellites results in a `` total '' /  ratio sligthly larger than the `` central '' one at small masses but significantly larger at high ( group and cluster ) masses ( bcw10 ; see also yang , mo & van den bosch 2009 ) .",
    "some of this `` excess '' stellar mass is expected to end actually in the central galaxy due to satellite infall and/or tidal stripping of stars ( other fractions of this stellar mass may end in the stellar halo or remain in the surviving satellites ) ; this could modify the obtained overall ",
    "relation h@xmath31  at @xmath10 , the mass fraction of stars accreted by the central galaxy is negligible , indicating that the latter can not have grown substantially due to the accretion of satellite galaxy s stars ; rather their growth is dominated by individual evolution ( in situ sf ) . for halos larger than @xmath32 h@xmath31 , the central galaxy  may increase lately in a significant fraction by satellite accretion ( dry mergers ) ; another fraction of the accreted stars end in the stellar halo ( intracluster stars ) . ] .",
    "in general , we do not expect that the overall   relations inferred by bcw10 will be significantly affected by the ( unknown ) physics of satellite galaxies , at least for @xmath33  at any epoch , and for any mass at @xmath34 .",

    "if the galaxies of the sample that allow us to find the isochrones would be growing in , then the arrow would diverge from the @xmath6 isochrone .",
    "therefore , the fact that the arrow reaches the @xmath6 isochrone exactly reveals that this side of the diagram is dominated by galaxies with _ passive _ evolution .",
    "the previous considerations confirm the idea that ( , @xmath0 ) resumes the key astrophysical processes of galaxy stellar mass assembly and therefore it contains information about the evolution of individual galaxies .",
    "our aim now is to explore the implications of the ( , @xmath0 ) relations shown in fig .",

( 2 ) the ghets of massive halos ( log(/)@xmath73 at @xmath6 ) stop to grow , happening this earlier , the more massive are the galaxies .",
    "such a behavior is due to the folding seen in the -@xmath0 surface that inverts the spatial distribution of the ( , @xmath0 ) curves going from the left to the right side of the diagram . the same properties may be derived from figure [ galefficiency ] , where the ghets are shown as tracks that connect the /  relations . here",
    "the folding is seen in the blue dashed lines as a maximum that shifts to the higher  mass side as @xmath0 increases , making the lines cross each other .",

    ", each ghet grows faster than the corresponding mah since @xmath23 . for ( @xmath0=0)@xmath77 ,",
    "as the system is more massive , the stellar assembly of the galaxy occurs earlier in time with respect to the corresponding halo .",
    "our analysis shows conclusively that the stellar mass growth of galaxies deviates from the halo mass growth , specially for low- and high - mass systems .",
    "figures [ msmh ] and [ galefficiency ] show that the more massive the galaxies , the earlier their ghets start to slow down their  growth and at each epoch there is a typical halo or galaxy mass at which this growth stagnates ; this typical mass decreases with time .",
    "such a situation can be interpreted as a transition at each epoch from active to passive galaxy populations , a transition at early epochs happens only for the largest galaxies but at later epochs involves gradually smaller galaxies ( see   3.2 for a more quantitative discussion ) .",
    "this transition from active to passive regimes is observed in the evolution of the blue and red components of the .",
    "in fact , observations show directly that , despite the stellar mass growth , the blue ( late - type ) galaxy component of the  is not enriched with massive galaxies with time ; on the contrary , within the uncertainty , it seems to become poorer in massive galaxies ( e.g. , bundy et al .",
    "2006 ; bell et al .",

    "such a phenomenon is explained by a migration of galaxies from the blue to the red component of the ; the red ( early - type ) galaxy component of the  is continuously fed with the migrated galaxies .",
    "our result , in the light of such an interpretation , is remarkable because in our analysis the galaxy color bi - modality never has been taken into account .",
    "studies where the  were decomposed into blue and red populations support our result in an independent way ( e.g. , bell et al . 2007 ; drory et al . 2009 ;",
    "pozzetti et al . 2010 ) .",
    "note that the prediction of a population transition and the typical mass that separates the two populations at each @xmath0 depends on the position of the folding in the @xmath0 surface .",

    "the fact that the more massive are the systems , the earlier they finish their  assembling , transiting from the active to the passive population , will be called here _ population downsizing _ ( in the literature the term archaeological downsizing has been used to describe a related behavior of galaxies ; see e.g. , fontanot et al .",

    "the main results obtained here , which allow to establish a unified description of average galaxy evolutionary tracks for a large range of masses , are as follows .",
    "@xmath148 the folding in the @xmath0 surface , reflected mainly as peaks in the ( /)",
    "diagram that shift to higher masses as @xmath0 increases , introduces an important feature in the behavior of the ghets . for masses much smaller than the peak mass at a given @xmath0 , ( @xmath0 ) ,",
    "the ghets are in an active growth phase , whereas masses close to or greater than ( @xmath0 ) are in a quiescent or completely passive ( stagnated ) phase ( figs .",
    "[ msmh ] and [ galefficiency ] ) .",
    "therefore , at each @xmath0 there is a characteristic stellar mass at which on average galaxies slow down their growth and transit from an active ( star  forming blue ) population to a passive ( red ) population .",
    "this transition mass decreases with time , giving rise to a phenomenon called here _",
    "population downsizing_.    @xmath148 galaxies less massive than  at @xmath6 ( @xmath149 , @xmath150 ) have still growing ghets . besides , the lower the mass , the faster the later  growth , due likely to a delayed and lately active sf phase , a phenomenon called _ downsizing in ssfr_.    @xmath148 the shapes of the average stellar and halo mass assembling histories are quite different ( figure [ ghets ] ) . for galaxies that at @xmath6 have @xmath151 , their dark mahs at later epochs grow slightly slower as smaller is the mass , while their stellar ghets grow much faster . for @xmath152 , the larger the galaxy , the earlier its ghets attain a stellar mass stagnation ; until this epoch , the more massive the galaxy , the faster the  growth with respect to the corresponding  growth",
    ".    @xmath148 by neglecting any stellar mass growth by accretion ( dry mergers ) , a ghet allows to find the corresponding ssfr history , ssfr(@xmath0 ) , by calculating  and correcting by the stellar mas - loss recycling factor @xmath153 .",
    "the inferred ssfrs at different @xmath0 s and as a function of  ( figs .",
    "[ dotm ] , [ dotmobs ] , and [ ssfr - ms ] ) are reasonably consistent with recent observational studies based on direct measures of the ssfr of star - forming galaxies at different @xmath0 s .",
    "the ghet - based ssfrs corresponding to masses that at a given @xmath0 are larger than the transition mass ( @xmath0 ) , are much lower than the measured ssfrs of ( rare ) luminous blue galaxies , but agree or are even slightly larger than the measured ssfrs of red galaxies .",
    "the overall consistency between the ghet - based ssfr-  relations at different @xmath11s with direct inferences of these relations suggests that the accretion of stellar systems ( mergers ) plays a minor role in the  assembling of galaxies , excepting perhaps those that transited to the passive sequence ( the most massive ones ) .    @xmath148 by using the ssfr vs.  evolutionary tracks , we calculated the characteristic transition mass at each @xmath0 , ( @xmath0 ) , above which the average ghet starts to significantly decrease its growth rate , transiting from the active to the passive galaxy population .",
    "the result is roughly described by the relation log(/ ) = @xmath154 ( at least up to @xmath105 ) .",
    "this result agrees with recent observational determinations of the evolution of the mass , at which the early- and late - type  components cross each other , from @xmath155 to the present ( fig .",
    "[ mtran ] ) .",
    "@xmath148 we determined also the transition rate in number density of active ( blue ) to quiescent ( red ) galaxy population . at @xmath21 such a rate is @xmath156 gal gyr@xmath31 mpc@xmath126 and up to @xmath46 the rates are within @xmath157 gal gyr@xmath31 mpc@xmath126 , in good agreement with direct observational inferences of growth rate in number density of red galaxies .",
    "@xmath148 we further explored whether -based models of galaxy evolution are able to predict galaxy evolutionary tracks ( called here gets ) in agreement with the ghets , in particular at low masses where the downsizing in ssfr is evidenced by the ghets .",
    "we have shown that while the models with sn energy  driven outflows are able to reproduce the local ",
    "relation ( see also firmani et al .",
    "2010 ) , they fail in reproducing this relation at higher @xmath0 s . the difference between gets and ghets at low masses is rather large : the former ones show a fast decrease in ssfr with time almost independent of mass , while for the latter ones , the lower the mass , the slower the late decrease of ssfr ( downsizing in ssfr ) .",
    "from these results , we conclude that the general description of stellar mass buildup of galaxies provided by our average ghets appears rather successful : the predicted ssfr histories as a function of  and the predicted transition mass  as a function of @xmath0 , as well as the transition flux at different @xmath11s , are roughly consistent with direct ( but yet limited ) observational estimates of all these quantities .",
    "furthermore , our analysis reveals nicely the existence of a galaxy bi - modality related to the  growth activity : as @xmath0 decreases , smaller and smaller masses transit on average from the active ( blue star - forming ) to the passive ( red ) population .",
    "an important ingredient of our approach is the connection of  halos to the observed galaxies .",
    "therefore , the underlying hierarchical  scenario is successful in the sense that the predictions of the model are in agreement with independent observations .",
    "the average stellar and dark mass buildup of galaxies were found to be significantly different , specially for low and high masses .",
    "this result is in qualitative agreement with cw09 in spite of the differences in the data , method , and redshift range between their and our work .",
    "however , the results from both works are different at a quantitative level , which is seen , for example , in the different conclusions regarding the existence of a characteristic mass at each epoch at which the ssfr of galaxies is truncated .",
    "note that the ssfr and the determination of this characteristic mass ( ) are related to the first and second derivatives of the  growth , respectively .",
    "our results put in a unified picture both the population downsizing ( related to galaxies with @xmath158 at @xmath6 ) and the downsizing in ssfr ( related to smaller galaxies ) . the challenges are now to explain the processes that produce : ( 1 ) the transition from active to passive regimes in  growth associated with a sharp cessation of the sfr in massive galaxies , ( 2 ) the fact that the typical mass of ssfr truncation , , decreases with cosmic time ( population downsizing ) , and ( 3 ) the fact that the smaller is the halo , the more is delayed the galaxy s  growth ( downsizing in ssfr ) .",
    "items ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) seem to find partial explanations in aspects related to the same dark halo clustering ( environment ) evolution ( e.g. , neistein et al .",
    "2006 ) as well as to the introduction of feedback processes due to the agns of massive galaxies ( e.g. , silk & rees 1998 ; kauffmann & haehnelt 2000 ; granato et al . 2004 ; cattaneo et al . 2005 ; de lucia et al . 2005 ; bower et al . 2006 ; croton et al . 2006 ) .",
    "item ( 3 ) , as shown here , is a sharp and less understood problem . later re - accretion of the gas ejected by galaxies due to sn - driven outflows does not account for a solution to this issue ( firmani et al .",
    ". a better understanding of the astrophysical processes intervening in galaxy formation and evolution as well as the role of environmental processes is necessary .",
