    "the distribution of edge balance ratio for power law network is theoretically analyzed , which is the main result of this work .",
    "this paper focuses on the basic properties of edges .",
    "the in - degree of a vertex is the amount of edges pointing to it .",
    "if there is an edge from vertex a to b , we call vertex a the out - vertex of the edge .",
    "correspondingly , b is called the in - vertex .",
    "the in - vertex and out - vertex are not equivalent in a directed edge , which means edges are unbalanced in a directed network . in order to describe the balance level of edges , _ edge balance ratio _",
    "is defined as one of the properties of directed edges . for a directed edge from vertex a to b ,",
    "edge balance ratio @xmath4 is defined as @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the in - degrees of vertices b and a. the _ logarithmic edge balance ratio _ is defined as the logarithm of edge balance ratio , which is more convenient to describe the characteristics of the whole network .",
    "the edge balance ratio reflects the balance property of edges . in a common network ,",
    "the in - degree of a vertex roughly reflects its importance . in most cases ,",
    "a vertex with a larger in - degree is a more important vertex in the network .",
    "an edge with a large edge balance ratio implies that the in - vertex has a much larger in - degree than the out - vertex , which implies that the in - vertex is very likely to be more important than the out - vertex .",
    "a balanced edge is one whose in - vertex and out - vertex have similar importance .",
    "unbalanced edges are common in real - world networks .",
    "specially , in a directed network which follows power law , there are many edges pointing to the vertices with large in - degrees .",
    "most of edges like these are unbalanced ones .",
    "in microblogging networks there are abundant unbalanced edges .",
    "for instance , famous stars attract large amounts of followers . as a result ,",
    "most of these edges are extremely unbalanced and edges like these accounts for a large proportion in microblogging networks .",
    "edge balance ratio implies the type of edges in a microblogging network .",
    "the edges with balance ratios far larger than one reflect the common following relationships , in which most uses are likely to follow users more famous than themselves .",
    "edges with balance ratios close to one represent the relationships between friends or people in a similar social position .",
    "edges with balance ratios far less than one may contain much more information of the network , which means a highly ranked user follows an ordinary user , reflecting some hidden real - world relationship or not apparent information between individuals",
    ". therefore , research on edge balance ratio is of great significant on the microblogging platform .    as an indicator related only to local information",
    ", edge balance ratio can be easily calculated in distributed systems such as adaptive networks @xcite , where lots of works have been done on the activities such as adaptive learning and the diffusion process @xcite . in these systems ,",
    "edge balance ratio can be an important factor for both edges and vertices .",
    "since in - degree approximately reflects the importance of a vertex in the network , an edge with balance ratio larger than one can be called a _ positive edge_. an edge pointing from a high in - degree vertex to a low in - degree vertex is a _ negative edge _ , correspondingly .",
    "an edge with balance ratio close to one can be called a _",
    "normal edge_.    for the whole network , _ balance profile _ is proposed as a global measure of the network , which is defined as the distribution of logarithmic edge balance ratio .",
    "the balance profile reveals the overall trend of the edges in the network .",
    "it reflects much more information , including the proportion of unbalanced edges of various levels .    on the basis of balance profile",
    ", the _ positivity _ of a directed network can be defined as the expectation of logarithmic balance ratio with finite values . in a directed network with @xmath8 vertices , the logarithmic balance ratio of an edge ranges within @xmath9 $ ] .",
    "the expectation can be normalized by @xmath10 , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the set of edges with finite balance ratios .",
    "the range of positivity is @xmath13 $ ] . as the average of logarithmic balance ratios for edges , the positivity reveals the positive level of the whole network .",
    "especially , for a directed network with all the edges bi - directed , it can be calculated that the positivity is zero .",
    "positivity and assortativity reflect the properties of a directed network at different perspectives , though it seems that there are some similarities between positivity and in - in assortativity .",
    "assortativity is a measure of the level that the vertices link to those with nearly the same degrees .",
    "however , positivity measures the level of vertices pointing to ones with higher degrees .",
    "an edge from a low in - degree vertex to a high in - degree vertex and an edge with the opposite direction both contribute a smaller assortativity to the network , while the former leads to a larger positivity and the latter leads to a smaller positivity .",
    "if the network has a large assortativity , the balance profile concentrates around the unitary edge balance ratio .",
    "contrarily , the balance profile of a disassortative network is mainly far from the unitary balance ratio .",
    "the balance profile of a network with large positivity is mostly on the right side of the axis @xmath4 equals to one , while that of a less positive network has more on the left side . using both positivity and assortativity , the balance property of a network can be better described .    as an example , the in - degree distributions and balance profiles of four directed networks with different typical in - degree distributions are illustrated in fig . [ fig1 ] .",
    "the four networks have different shapes of balance profiles .",
    "the positivities of the networks are @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "the power law network has a large positivity , because the positive half of the balance profile is significantly higher than the negative half .",
    "the balance profiles of the last two networks are almost symmetrical , which leads to rather small positivities .",
    "power law distribution is the most common and the most important distribution in real - world networks .",
    "directed networks following power law are mainly discussed in this work . according to the properties of real - world directed networks , two basic assumptions are adopted in the network model .",
    "the in - degrees of the vertices in the network follow power law distribution approximately , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the amount of vertices with in - degree @xmath1 , @xmath20 is a scale factor and @xmath0 is the scaling exponent of power law .    for any vertex @xmath21 , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the probability that vertex @xmath24 has in - degree",
    "@xmath1 and @xmath25 is the set of followers of vertex @xmath21 .",
    "assumption 2 means that there is no bias on the followers of vertices on average .",
    "the proportion of various types of followers of a vertex approximately equals that of the whole network .",
    "the assumptions are reasonable in a microblogging network .",
    "real data of microblogging network verifies the correctness of the assumptions .",
    "the assumptions above are regarded as basic properties of the network .",
    "they are considered to be satisfied in the following of this paper .",
    "firstly , the amount of edges with balance ratio @xmath4 and in - vertex degree @xmath1 is calculated , as lemma 1 .",
    "please refer to the appendix for the proof of lemma 1 .",
    "if a power law directed network of @xmath8 vertices satisfies assumptions 1 and 2 , then the total amount of edges with out - vertices of in - degree @xmath1 and balance ratio @xmath4 is @xmath26 .",
    "the main result on edge balance ratio is proposed as theorem 1 , which provides the approximate calculation of the edge balance ratio distribution . here , we consider the edges with finite balance ratios only .",
    "if an @xmath8-vertex power law directed network satisfies assumptions 1 and 2 , for logarithmically divided counting intervals @xmath27\\ ] ] of edge balance ratio , the distribution of edge balance ratio follows power law piecewise . in detail , the amount of edges with balance ratio @xmath4 satisfies @xmath28 the scaling exponents of the four sections are @xmath29 , @xmath0 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively , where @xmath0 is the scaling exponent of the in - degree distribution of the network .    the outline of the proof is presented here while the details are included in the appendix .",
    "the cases of @xmath32 and @xmath33 are calculated separately .",
    "considering the edge balance ratios satisfying @xmath32 , the axis is logarithmically divided into counting intervals by @xmath34 $ ] .",
    "for each interval @xmath35 $ ] , the contribution of edge balance ratios @xmath4 within the interval is the sum for all the combinations @xmath36 falling into this interval , where @xmath37 is the in - degree of the out - vertex and @xmath1 is the in - degree of the in - vertex .",
    "it should be noted that each value of @xmath4 is discrete .",
    "not all values of edge balance ratio can have an edge exactly corresponding to it .",
    "the calculations for intervals with large @xmath38 and those with small @xmath38 are different .",
    "we divide the calculation into two parts , corresponding to the cases of @xmath4 far larger than one and slightly larger than one , respectively . for @xmath4",
    "slightly larger than one , the sum vibrates strongly for various intervals .",
    "we focus on the peak values only and it follows the power law .    similarly , considering the edge balance ratio less than one",

    ", we sum up all the combinations @xmath36 falling into it .",
    "the calculation is also divided into two parts .",
    "we focus on the peak values only for @xmath4 slightly smaller than one .",
    "the theoretical analysis reveals that the edge balance ratio obeys the power law piecewise if the distribution of in - degree obeys the power law distribution .",
    "the scaling exponent of the distribution of edge balance ratio in each section is strictly linearly determined by the scaling exponent of in - degree distribution . in - degree",
    "is the property of vertices while edge balance ratio is the property of edges .",
    "the relationship between the statistical properties of vertices and edges is established .",
    "positive edges are much more than negative ones in a power law network . in other words , there are much more edges with balance ratios larger than one than edges with balance ratios smaller than one .",
    "the trend of the overall network is positive , which means that most of edges in the network are positive or normal edges .    in twitter and sina weibo , for a famous user ,",
    "most edges related to it are from ordinary users , which leads to a large amount of positive edges . by contrast , for a user with few followers , most of his followers have similar ranks with him and there are few famous users follow him . consequently , most edges pointing to him are normal edges .",
    "the distribution under logarithmical intervals in theorem 1 is the balance profile of the network , which implies the characteristics of the network .",
    "the shape of the balance profile is determined by the scaling exponent @xmath0 .",
    "the balance profile for @xmath33 always rises in the double logarithmic coordinate system .",
    "according to the theoretical analysis , the slope is @xmath0 when @xmath4 is slightly smaller than one while the slope is @xmath29 when @xmath4 is far smaller than one .",
    "it is known that the scaling exponent @xmath0 of a real - world network is always larger than one in general .",
    "the shape of balance profile for @xmath41 is determined by the sign of @xmath42 .",
    "the slopes are @xmath30 and @xmath31 for @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "the balance profile always has a negative slope if @xmath4 is not far from @xmath45 .",
    "for the case @xmath0 larger than @xmath46 , the profile has a negative slope for @xmath44 . on the contrary , this segment of the curve will rise if @xmath0 is less than @xmath46 . in this case , edges with larger balance ratios account for a greater proportion .",
    "the critical value of @xmath0 is @xmath46 .",
    "it affects the trend of the balance profile a lot .",
    "in this section , numerical simulations are done to verify the theoretical results .",
    "real - world networks have a lot of randomness . in order to generate networks similar to real - world networks , two pairs of stochastic conditions",
    "are put forward , involving randomness into the network model . according to the conditions ,",
    "four types of networks are constituted to simulate real - world networks .",
    "the theoretical analysis is verified by simulations , including various stochastic networks with different power law scaling exponents .",

    "although the theoretical slope in the double logarithmic coordinate system matches the simulation well , the intercept is not as precise , especially when @xmath4 is much larger than one .    the main error sources are in the following areas :    1 .",
    "randomness is involved in the generated networks ; 2 .",
    "the estimation for @xmath20 in the power law representation of @xmath57 equal @xmath58 is not precise enough ; 3 .",
    "some approximations are utilized in the theoretical analysis , such as replacing the summation with integration .",
    "these lead to the error of estimated intercept in the double logarithmic coordinate system .",
    "however , the intercept is not as critical as the slope for the power law distribution .",
    "the scaling exponent is much more critical , which determines the property of the network .",
    "a stochastic network is generated with @xmath52 vertices and @xmath0 equals @xmath53 .",
    "the vertex with the largest in - degree has @xmath59 followers . if vertices are sorted by their in - degrees in descending order , the vertices at top @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 have @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 followers , respectively . considering these vertices and vertices with in - degrees @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath46 , and @xmath45 ,",
    "the edges related to them are selected for further investigation",
    ". the balance ratios of these edges are shown in fig .",
    "each sub - figure shows edges of all the vertices with the specified in - degree .",
    "the red points represent the edges start from the vertices , while the blue ones represent edges pointed to the vertices with the specified in - degrees .",
    "the distributions of in - edges are similar for vertices with various in - degrees and so are the distributions of out - edges .",
    "the reason for this is the assumption 2 , which is that the in - degree distribution of the followers of a vertex is approximately the same as the distribution of all vertices in the whole network .    as the increasing of the in - degrees of vertices",
    ", the red points are moving towards left and the blue ones are moving towards right .",
    "this is because that for the red out - edges , the edge balance ratios are smaller if the in - degree of the vertex is larger .",
    "similarly , for the blue in - edges , the balance ratios are larger if the vertex has a larger in - degree .",
    "the wizard - hat - shape balance profile is the superposition of all the statistics like this .",
    "the contribution of vertices with in - degrees @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath67 and @xmath66 is critical , for the amount of these vertices is huge , although the followers of them are few .",
    "correspondingly , the vertex with the most followers contributes a lot to the statistics of the balance ratio , even though there is only one such vertex in the network .",
    "[ fig6 ] illustrates the average in - degrees of in - vertices and out - vertices of the edges in each counting interval . for edges with large balance ratios , the in - degrees of the out - vertices have no significant disparity , while the disparity between the in - vertices of these edges leads to the disparity of edge balance ratio .",
    "correspondingly , for edges with small balance ratios , the disparity between the out - vertices contributes a lot .",
    "therefore , an edge with a large balance ratio is mainly because the in - vertex has a large in - degree , while the reason for a very small edge balance ratio is that the out - vertex has a large in - degree .",
    "in directed networks , edge balance ratio is an important measure of the balance property of edges , while balance profile is a description of the balance level of the network .",
    "if the in - degree distribution follows the power law , the distribution of edge balance ratio follows a piecewise power law , which is wizard - hat shaped .",
    "numerical simulation results confirm the theoretical analysis .",
    "real - world network datasets of twitter and sina weibo are used to obtain the statistics of edge balance ratio , which is basically consistent with the theoretical results . moreover ,",
    "some related topics and detailed discussions are also included in this paper .",
    "by assumption 1 , there are @xmath47 vertices with in - degree @xmath1 in the network . according to assumption 2 , among the followers of a vertex with in - degree @xmath1 , there are @xmath68 vertices having @xmath37 followers . consequently , the amount of edges with balance ratio @xmath4 whose target vertices having in - degree @xmath1 is @xmath69 where @xmath70 for the combination @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , the number of vertices with in - degree @xmath1 and edge balance ratio @xmath4 is @xmath71 altogether .",
    "the results of four sections are proved separately , corresponding to different cases .      for interval",
    "@xmath35 $ ] with a large @xmath38 , the following inequality @xmath72 is established for a fixed @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , it satisfies @xmath73 each pair of @xmath74 has a contribution of @xmath75 edges within this interval .",
    "the sum of ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) is @xmath82 it can be considered as the value at @xmath83 . in other words , the edge amount @xmath84 with respect to balance ratio @xmath4",
    "can be written as @xmath85 which obeys the power law with scaling exponent @xmath31 .",
    "if the interval @xmath35 $ ] has a small @xmath38 , the sum vibrates strongly for various intervals .",
    "we discuss the peak values only .",
    "peak values are placed at integer edge balance ratios . according to the expression @xmath86 of each @xmath1 , the value at edge balance ratio @xmath4 is @xmath87 it demonstrates that the peak values obey the power law with scaling exponent @xmath30 .        for the interval",
    "@xmath90 $ ] with a larger @xmath38 , @xmath37 should satisfy the inequality @xmath91 for a fixed @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , @xmath92 the contribution of the combinations @xmath74 within this interval is @xmath75 edges .",
    "the amount of edges for @xmath1 is approximately @xmath93 then sum over @xmath1 and the result is @xmath94        for the interval @xmath90 $ ] with a small @xmath38 , the edge amount value vibrates and the peak values are taken into consideration . similarly , the peak values are at @xmath97 for each integer @xmath1 . according to the expression @xmath86",
