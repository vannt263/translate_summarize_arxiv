    "over the past decade , the characterization and classification of topological insulator and superconductor ( symmetry protected ) phases of matter has played a central role in condensed matter research @xcite .",
    "these phases can not be adiabatically connected with a trivial atomic limit , they typically exhibit gapless excitations at the sample boundary .",
    "furthermore , there are topologically ordered phases with long - range entanglement that go beyond the symmetry - breaking classification of states of matter .",
    "topologically ordered states are a particular type of topological phase that arises in two or more dimensions and is characterized by a topology - dependent ground state degeneracy and long - range entanglement @xcite .",
    "the kitaev honeycomb lattice model is a paradigm model for the study of topologically ordered states @xcite .",
    "its discovery was an important milestone because it is one of the first models that could be solved exactly which exhibits topological order and phase transitions between states with abelian and non - abelian excitations .",
    "various extensions have been devised in two and three dimensions @xcite . in the three - dimensional case ,",
    "long - range entanglement does not necessarily imply a topologically ordered state , although there can be contributions to long - range entanglement that are of topological origin @xcite , and point - like excitations always obey bosonic or fermionic statistics . in spite of this , there is nevertheless an interest in understanding generalizations of the kitaev model to three dimensions because their study can lead to insights into the topological nature of certain interacting bosonic systems .",
    "one fundamental way to characterize topological phases of matter is with spatial entanglement .",
    "entanglement is an important tool used in condensed matter research to study properties of the phases of a system and the phase transitions that separate such phases @xcite . in particular , it has provided numerous insights related with both non - interacting topological insulators and superconductors @xcite as well as interacting topological phases @xcite .",
    "recently , it was shown by yao and qi @xcite that the entanglement of the 2d kitaev model can be understood as arising from two contributions : one describing an emergent static @xmath0 gauge field , and the second from non - interacting majorana fermions hopping on a lattice .",
    "this insight revealed the origin of the topological entanglement entropy of the kitaev model , and clarified the difference between its abelian and non - abelian phases in terms of its entanglement properties .    in this work",
    "we explore the extension of these results to three dimensions .",
    "we show that the same property of the entanglement found in the kitaev model holds for a three - dimensional generalization proposed by ryu @xcite .",
    "we explore the entanglement properties of this model in terms of signatures identifying the various phases of the system .",
    "we point out that introducing vortex defects in the @xmath0 gauge field does not affect the factorization property of the density matrix , so that the entanglement contribution arising from these defects is determined by gapless majorana degrees of freedom that are trapped by vortex configurations in the @xmath0 gauge field .",
    "we show examples of the effect of such vortex lines on the entanglement of the system .",
    "as a warm - up , we review the 2d kitaev model and its entanglement properties in this section . consider a honeycomb lattice with a spin-@xmath1 degree of freedom represented by pauli matrices @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) at each lattice site .",
    "because of the geometry of the honeycomb lattice , each site has three nearest - neighbors .",
    "we label the three possible vectors connecting a lattice site to its nearest - neighbors as @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6-links .",
    "the kitaev model is obtained by assigning anisotropic exchange couplings between nearest neighboring spins according the type of link that connects them @xmath7 this particular form of exchange interaction makes this model exactly soluble . in particular , its eigenstates",
    "can be obtained explicitly by writing the spin degrees of freedom in terms of majorana fermion operators .",
    "this is the method we will follow in this work , although one can also obtain the eigenstates through a jordan - wigner type transformation @xcite .",
    "the main idea is to describe the two - dimensional hilbert space of a spin-@xmath1 degree of freedom using a set of four majorana fermions @xmath8 which are defined in an enlarged four - dimensional hilbert space .",
    "these majorana operators satisfy @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "if one defines @xmath13 , then this operator is a consistent representation of @xmath14 if we impose a constraint that restricts @xmath15 to a two - dimensional hilbert space .",
    "this constraint is found by noting that the @xmath16 operators commute with the product @xmath17 . since @xmath18",
    ", we can impose the constraint @xmath19 to restrict @xmath16 to the desired two - dimensional hilbert space .",
    "one can check that @xmath16 defined with this constraint satisfies the same algebra as the original spin operators .",
    "hence , @xmath15 consistently describes the original spin-@xmath1 degree of freedom .    in terms of these new operators ,",
    "the kitaev model takes the form @xmath20 where @xmath21 are referred to as link operators , with @xmath22 depending on whether the @xmath23 and @xmath24 indices form a @xmath4 , @xmath5 or @xmath6-link .",
    "a consistent sign convention is to choose the @xmath23 index to label a site in the @xmath25 sublattice , and correspondingly @xmath24 in the @xmath26 sublattice .",
    "the fundamental advantage that is gained from using the majorana fermion language is made apparent by noting that the link operators satisfy @xmath27=0 \\quad \\text{and } \\quad \\left[\\hat{u}_{jk},\\hat{u}_{lm}\\right]=0.\\ ] ] we can thus diagonalize the hamiltonian and the @xmath28 operators simultaneously .",
    "an eigenstate of the kitaev model can then be labeled by a fixed configuration of eigenvalues of the link operators . since @xmath29 , the link operators only have two eigenvalues @xmath30 .",
    "once a configuration of eigenvalues is chosen , what remains is a hamiltonian of free majorana fermions @xmath31 hopping on a lattice , which can be solved straightforwardly .",
    "the effect of the link operators will be at most to change the signs of the hopping elements .",
    "this means the link operators effectively act like a static @xmath0 gauge field that couples to the @xmath31 majorana fermions .    to obtain the ground state",
    ", we need to know what configuration of the @xmath0 gauge field leads to the lowest overall energy .",
    "lieb showed that this configuration corresponds to all @xmath32 @xcite . using this configuration , and solving for the corresponding majorana fermion ground state @xmath33",
    ", one can then calculate the physical state @xmath34 by projecting into the sector in which @xmath19 for all @xmath35 .",
    "this amounts to averaging over all possible gauge transformations of the @xmath0 gauge field : @xmath36 here , @xmath37 is the total number of sites , @xmath38 with @xmath39 being a subset of lattice sites , and the sum runs over all possible subsets of sites .",
    "other energy eigenstates can be obtained by the same gauge averaging procedure with some initial configuration of @xmath0 fluxes .",
    "since the ground state has constant phases on the links , the hamiltonian in this sector is translationally invariant .",
    "a change of basis to momentum space leads to the following two - by - two single - particle hamiltonian @xmath40 where @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) are pauli matrices that act on the sublattice index , and @xmath43 with @xmath44 the primitive vectors that generate the @xmath25 hexagonal sublattice .",
    "the energy spectrum of this hamiltonian is @xmath45 .    due to the form of this spectrum ,",
    "one can divide the space of parameters into two regions . whenever the couplings satisfy the inequalities @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 ,",
    "the spectrum is gapless due to the time - reversal invariance of the majorana fermion hamiltonian . the spectrum in this parameter regime",
    "can thus be gapped out by the addition of three - spin interactions that break time - reversal symmetry .",
    "the resulting gapped ground state has quasiparticle excitations that obey non - abelian statistics , and so this phase is referred to as the non - abelian phase of the kitaev model . by contrast , if the triangular inequalities of the @xmath49 are not satisfied then the system is gapped without the need of any additional terms . in this case",
    "the excitations satisfy abelian statistics , and so in this case the system realizes an abelian phase .",
    "let us now briefly review how to quantify the entanglement of a state @xmath50 .",
    "one starts by choosing a partition of the hilbert space into two complementary subspaces , say @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the entanglement between these two parts of the hilbert space can be quantified by the so - called von - neumann entropy , defined as @xmath53 the reduced density matrix of region @xmath51 is given by @xmath54 $ ] , where @xmath55 denotes the trace over the degrees of freedom in @xmath52 .",
    "we will refer to the partitioning of the hilbert space as an entanglement cut that is performed on the system .",
    "a generalization of the entanglement entropy that has also been useful in characterizing condensed matter systems , namely the renyi entropy , is given by @xmath56.\\ ] ] we can recover the von neumann entropy by taking the limit @xmath57 .",
    "this form of the entanglement entropy in terms of the quantity @xmath58 $ ] will be useful for calculating the entanglement of the kitaev model and its 3d generalization .    as we will discuss in the following sections , the entanglement spectrum of kitaev - type models can be reduced to the computation of the entanglement of quadratic fermionic hamiltonians . in such cases , the entanglement entropy is completely determined by the eigenvalues @xmath59 of the correlation matrix @xmath60_{ij}={\\langle \\omega |}c^{\\dagger}_i c_j{| \\omega \\rangle}$]@xcite , where the @xmath61 indices are restricted to the @xmath51 subspace .",
    "the entanglement entropy @xmath62 in terms of this set of eigenvalues is then given by @xmath63 the set @xmath59 is called the single - particle entanglement spectrum and it corresponds to the eigenvalues of the correlation matrix .",
    "the entanglement entropy , and additionally , all entanglement quantities of a free - fermion ground state @xmath50 can thus be understood by analyzing the @xmath64 the @xmath65 lie between @xmath66 and @xmath67 and thus the closer the modes are to @xmath68 the larger the entanglement of a subsystem .",
    "the distribution of the @xmath65 is what we will keep track of in the discussion that follows .",
    "the phases of the kitaev model were characterized in @xcite using entanglement . in general , computing the entanglement of an interacting spin model can be challenging both analytically and numerically . however , because of the special structure of the kitaev model , this task is dramatically simplified .",
    "the entanglement of an eigenstate @xmath69 of the kitaev model can be obtained by separately calculating the entanglement of the @xmath0 gauge field and the majorana fermions .",
    "more specifically , yao and qi showed that the following relation holds @xmath70=\\text{tr}_{a , g}\\left[\\rho_{a , g}^n\\right]\\cdot \\text{tr}_{a , f}\\left[\\rho_{a , f}^n\\right]\\ ] ] where @xmath71 $ ] , the reduced density matrix @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) describes the majorana fermions ( a pure @xmath0 gauge field ) in region @xmath51 , and the trace @xmath74 runs over the fermion ( gauge ) degrees of freedom in region @xmath51 .",
    "the factorization of @xmath75 $ ] is useful because , by taking the limit @xmath76 , one finds that the entanglement entropy can be written as @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the entanglement entropy of the fermions ( gauge field ) .",
    "using this insight , yao and qi found that in both abelian and non - abelian phases the entanglement entropy of the kitaev model can generically be written as @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is a non - universal constant and @xmath81 is the length of the boundary separating regions @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath81 is the well - known area ( perimeter in 2d ) law for gapped states .",
    "the term that is independent of the boundary size is thus identified as the topological entanglement entropy .",
    "it is the same for all phases of the kitaev model , and it arises exclusively due to the presence of the @xmath0 gauge field .",
    "it was further argued that , although the topological entanglement entropy is the same for both abelian and non - abelian phases , there is nevertheless a way in which their entanglement properties can distinguish these phases .",
    "specifically , in the non - abelian phase the majorana fermion ground state acquires a nonzero chern number that leads to the presence of gapless states at the boundary .",
    "the presence of these boundary states leads to spectral flow in the entanglement spectrum and further contributes to the entanglement of the system .",
    "such edge states do not generically arise in the abelian phase , so there are no additional entanglement contributions in this phase .",
    "this distinction was argued by yao and qi to be related to the nature of the quasiparticles in the non - abelian phase .",
    "hence , they argued , the intrinsic difference between the abelian and non - abelian phases is manifested in their entanglement properties .",
    "although we will not make connections to the statistics of excitations in ryu s 3d model , we will nevertheless find analogous behavior concerning the entanglement properties of its eigenstates .",
    "in particular , the entanglement entropy is also separable into gauge field and majorana fermion components , and this insight allows one to understand and distinguish the topological phases of the system depending on the surface states ( or absence thereof ) in each phase , as we will see in later sections .",
    "in this section we discuss ryu s model and its entanglement properties @xcite ; we will refer it as the ryu - kitaev diamond ( rkd ) model .",
    "the overall structure of the rkd hamiltonian is analogous to that of the kitaev honeycomb model , namely one considers anisotropic exchange couplings between nearest - neighboring spin degrees of freedom . upon introducing majorana operators",
    ", the hamiltonian reduces to a problem of free majorana fermions hopping in the presence of a @xmath0 gauge field ; in this case in three dimensions .",
    "there is , however , a fundamental difference with respect to the kitaev model , namely the rkd model is designed to preserve time - reversal symmetry for all of its phases .",
    "this will have an important impact on the topological classification of the ground state which is manifested in its entanglement properties .",
    "the rkd model is realized on the diamond lattice .",
    "the diamond lattice is formed by two fcc sublattices @xmath25 and @xmath26 that are shifted by a vector @xmath82 ( @xmath83 is the lattice constant of the fcc conventional cell ) .",
    "we choose the primitive vectors @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 . each lattice site in the diamond lattice has four nearest neighbours , and the vectors connecting a site in sublattice @xmath25 to its nearest neighbours are : @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 .",
    "we illustrate the structure of the diamond lattice together with the @xmath91 vectors in fig.[lattice ] .    on each lattice site",
    "we place two spin-@xmath1 degrees of freedom @xmath2 and @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) . for convenience ,",
    "we define @xmath94 @xmath95 @xmath96 and @xmath97 we then couple nearest - neighboring pairs of spins in the following anisotropic way @xmath98 here , the values @xmath99 label the four possible nearest neighbors determined by the @xmath100 .",
    "the key feature of this model is again the anisotropic nature of the exchange interactions .",
    "similar to the kitaev model , the eigenstates of the hamiltonian are obtained by introducing majorana degrees of freedom at each site . in the present case ,",
    "since there is a four - dimensional hilbert space at each site , we can consider an enlarged eight - dimensional hilbert space with six majorana fermions @xmath101 ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "the eigenstates are constrained to be in the subspace where @xmath103 . by making the identification @xmath104 and @xmath105 ,",
    "the hamiltonian becomes @xmath106 where the link operators are given by @xmath107 . here",
    ", the link operators are again defined to go from sublattice @xmath25 to sublattice @xmath26 .",
    "these link operators commute with the hamiltonian , so we can replace them by a specific choice of eigenvalues .",
    "what remains is then a hopping model of two flavors of majorana fermions that feel the same @xmath0 field .",
    "the rkd model includes additional interactions between spins on three neighboring sites which are introduced in order to remove non - generic degeneracies in the energy spectrum .",
    "this effectively leads to the following second - nearest neighbor hoppings in the majorana fermion language : @xmath108 \\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\sum_{r_b}\\left[ik^z\\left(\\hat{u}_{r_b+s_1\\ , r_b}\\hat{u}_{r_b+s_3\\,r_b}\\right)\\lambda^t_{r_b+s_1 } s^z \\lambda_{r_b+s_3}\\right],\\nonumber\\\\ h_x&=&\\sum_{(i , j)\\in \\lambda}\\left\\{\\sum_{r_a}\\left[ik^x\\left(\\hat{u}_{r_a\\,r_a - s_i}\\hat{u}_{r_a\\ , r_a - s_j}\\right)\\lambda^t_{r_a - s_i } s^x \\lambda_{r_a - s_j}\\right ] \\right .",

    ", the single - particle momentum space bloch hamiltonian is @xmath118 where @xmath119 ( @xmath42 ) are additional pauli matrices acting on the sublattice degree of freedom , and we defined the functions @xmath120 the energy spectrum of the single - particle hamiltonian is given by @xmath121 , where @xmath122 . by evaluating this spectrum for various values of the parameters ,",
    "one finds that there are several distinct gapped phases separated by gapless critical points .",
    "these gapless points correspond to phase transitions between topologically distinct phases . in @xcite , ryu identified two main phases , namely a strong and weak topological phase .",
    "we will discuss these phases and their entanglement in the following sections .",
    "similar to the kitaev model , the rkd has topologically distinct phases depending on the relative strengths of the hopping parameters .",
    "let us consider the single - particle majorana fermion hamiltonian in momentum space .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath123 satisfies particle - hole symmetry @xmath124 ( @xmath125 ) , and time - reversal symmetry @xmath126 ( @xmath127 ) , where @xmath128 represents complex conjugation . note that the time - reversal symmetry operator satisfies @xmath129 .",
    "hence , the model we are considering belongs to the symmetry class diii of the altland - zirnbauer classification of non - interacting fermions @xcite .",
    "similar to 3d time - reversal invariant topological insulators @xcite , there are strong and weak topological states that can be obtained in this model as discussed in @xcite .",
    "the strong topological phase has robust gapless states on any surface that separates the bulk from the vacuum .",
    "it can be characterized by a @xmath130 topological invariant defined for 3d systems that satisfy chiral symmetry @xmath131 , where @xmath132 is the chiral operator . in the present case , this operator corresponds to @xmath133 . in the basis",
    "in which @xmath132 is diagonal , the operator @xmath134 can be written in block off - diagonal form ( where @xmath135 is the projection operator into the occupied states ) .",
    "let us then define the matrix in the block - off diagonal of @xmath136 as @xmath137",
    ". then the integer - valued topological invariant is given by @xcite @xmath138,\\label{nu3d}\\ ] ] where for the rkd model the @xmath137 matrix is @xmath139 as was verified in @xcite , there is a parameter regime for which @xmath140 , signaling a nontrivial 3d topological ground state .",
    "we will discuss in the next section particular realizations of the parameters for which @xmath141 and analyze the corresponding entanglement properties .    as to the weak topological states ,",
    "these arise when some of the hopping parameters are reduced sufficiently so that the ground state is adiabatically connected to either decoupled topological layers or decoupled topological wires . in these phases ,",
    "the system has boundary modes only on certain surfaces of the system depending on the direction of the layers or wires that realize the topological state .",
    "these boundary states are protected by translation symmetry and can be gapped out by introducing disorder that respects the symmetries of class diii . as such ,",
    "this phase is not robust , at least not in the same sense that the strong topological phase is robust .",
    "it has been argued , however , that if the disorder is respected on average , such boundary states can still survive @xcite .    to be concrete , suppose @xmath142 are sufficiently smaller than the other couplings so that the ground state is adiabatically connected to the @xmath143 limit .",
    "in this case , the system can be viewed as a set of weakly coupled layers that are perpendicular to @xmath144 .",
    "when the layers are completely decoupled , each layer realizes a two - dimensional system in class diii , which means that the ground state is classified by a @xmath145 invariant . because of this , the topology of the ground state of these layers is different from that of the kitaev model , although similar to the square lattice model studied in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath145 invariant in class diii is given by the fu - kane formula @xcite @xmath146 where trim stands for the set of four time - reversal invariant momenta in the first brillouin zone ( fbz ) of the hexagonal lattice , @xmath147 , and @xmath148 $ ] is the pfaffian of the matrix @xmath149 . in [ 2dnu ] , we show the derivation for obtaining the following expression of this topological invariant @xmath150 using this expression , we find that there are parameter regimes for which @xmath151 , indicating the presence of a nontrivial phase for each layer .    if we now consider the case when another coupling , say @xmath152 is sufficiently small , then the system will be adiabatically connected to decoupled wires in class diii .",
    "this class also has a @xmath145 classification .",
    "following @xcite , we again characterize the topological state by the fu - kane formula eq .",
    "the main difference with the previous calculation is that now there are only two time - reversal invariant momenta .",
    "the calculation leads to @xmath153 when @xmath154 is greater than @xmath155 , this expression gives @xmath156 .",
    "this leads to localized boundary modes for each wire . upon coupling the wires to form the 3d bulk system ,",
    "these boundary modes become dispersive and are generically susceptible to being gapped by disorder .",
    "the main difference with the case of weakly - coupled layers is that here there will be no spectral flow between the positive and negative energy bands , whereas in the layer case there is .",
    "this difference will manifest itself in the entanglement spectrum as we will see when we discuss the entanglement of the rkd model .",
    "in order to calculate the entanglement of the rkd model , we first show that the factorization found in two dimensions for the kitaev model also holds for the rkd model .",
    "the derivation we present here is essentially an extension of the derivation by yao and qi , the main difference being that there are more majorana operators per lattice site in the rkd model . in this section",
    "we provide a general description of how the derivation works , and we leave the details for [ proof ] .",
    "we start by writing the explicit form of an eigenstate of the rkd model",
    ". this eigenstate will be a product of the state of the @xmath0 gauge field @xmath157 and the corresponding majorana fermion state @xmath33 . by projecting into the @xmath158 subspace",
    "we obtain the physical state : @xmath159 where the product runs over all of the @xmath37 lattice sites of the system",
    ". the objective will be to calculate @xmath58 $ ] in terms of the reduced density matrix of a pure @xmath145 gauge field @xmath73 and the reduced density matrix of the free majorana fermions @xmath160 $ ] .",
    "the main complication for achieving this is that the state @xmath161 is multiplied by the @xmath162 operators .",
    "thus , it would seem that the @xmath162 operators will inevitably appear in the final expression upon taking the trace of powers of the density matrix .",
    "this can be resolved by explicitly performing the traces of the @xmath0 gauge field over region @xmath52 .",
    "this is achieved by rewriting the link operators that cross the entanglement cut in terms of new link operators that exist exclusively on either the @xmath51 or @xmath52 region . upon taking the trace over region @xmath163 and for each power @xmath164 that is computed",
    ", there will appear matrix elements of the operators @xmath165 which can be simplified explicitly .",
    "after carrying out this procedure , the @xmath165 operators drop out of the expression .",
    "what remains at this stage are the @xmath166 operators which act on the fermion state @xmath33 .",
    "because of the manner in which matrix elements of the @xmath0 gauge field are traced out , it turns out that all of the @xmath166 can be arranged into operators that project into definite sectors of fixed fermion parity . by using the fact that the fermion parity of the fermion ground state is fixed ,",
    "these fermion parity projectors can be simplified appropriately , to the point where there will no longer be any of the @xmath166 operators in the expression .",
    "the resulting expression turns out to be ( see appendix b ) @xmath167=\\frac{1}{2^{(n-1)(l-1 ) } } \\text{tr}_a\\left[\\rho_{a , f}^{n}\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath81 is the number of links crossing the entanglement cut .",
    "by further noting that @xmath168=\\frac{1}{2^{(n-1)(l-1)}},\\ ] ] for a pure @xmath0 gauge field , one then obtains the desired result @xmath169= \\text{tr}_{a , g}\\left[\\rho^n_{a , g}\\right]\\text{tr}_{a , f}\\left[\\rho^n_{a , f}\\right].\\ ] ] using this property of the density matrix of the rkd model , one can then proceed to calculate the entanglement of the system in the same way that it was done for the kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice .",
    "an immediate consequence of the factorization property of @xmath170 $ ] is that there is a contribution to the entanglement entropy which does not scale with system size .",
    "this contribution arises exclusively from the @xmath0 gauge field part and it is given by @xmath171 where @xmath172 is the topological contribution to the entanglement entropy .",
    "in fact , this value of the topological entanglement entropy is the same as that of the two - dimensional @xmath0 gauge field of the kitaev model .",
    "this is consistent with the discussion in @xcite , where it was shown that the entanglement entropy of a discrete gauge theory of symmetry group @xmath173 would have a topological entanglement entropy @xmath174 in both two and three dimensions , where @xmath175 is the number of elements in the group .",
    "let us now evaluate the entanglement of the majorana fermion part of the ground state . throughout , we will consider an entanglement cut that partitions the system along the plane generated by @xmath176 and @xmath177 .",
    "we will maintain periodic boundary conditions along theses two directions .",
    "since the ground state is translationally invariant , we can fourier transform both directions and consider hamiltonians that are dependent on the momenta @xmath178 .",
    "the corresponding fbz is depicted in the inset at the center of fig.[spectra ] .",
    "this figure of the brillouin zone also shows the path along which we will evaluate the energy and entanglement spectrum .",
    "the path includes the time - reversal momenta which are the momenta where the gap closing points occur in this model .",
    "even though the parameter space is significantly large , it will be sufficient to restrict ourselves to a specific set of parameters that will allow us to explore the relevant phases of the model .",
    "we thus fix the parameters @xmath179 , @xmath180 , @xmath181 and vary @xmath154 . in figs .",
    "[ spectra ] a , c , e , g , we show the energy spectrum with open boundary conditions in the @xmath182 direction .",
    "each subfigure corresponds to four values of the parameter @xmath183 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding entanglement spectrum is shown in figs .",
    "[ spectra ] b , d , f , h with periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath182 direction .",
    "the gap of the model closes as we continuously change between these values of @xmath154 .",
    "each time the gap closes , the system undergoes a topological phase transition .",
    "the four cases we show here thus correspond to four topologically distinct phases .",
    "for all four phases there are energy modes in the gap that cross zero energy .",
    "these are the surface states , which signal the nontrivial nature of the ground state .",
    "correspondingly , the entanglement spectrum shows entanglement modes between @xmath66 and @xmath184 that behave in a similar way as the surface states .",
    "this is due to the fact that the correlation matrix is directly related with the spectrally flattened version of the single - particle hamiltonian .",
    "thus , the topological surface states will be manifest in the entanglement spectrum as entanglement modes that cross @xmath1 @xcite .    for @xmath185",

    "further , one does not find any additional closings in the energy spectrum , and furthermore @xmath191 and @xmath195 ( for @xmath196 ) .",

    "[ nu1d ] , we find that @xmath156 when we set @xmath197 .",
    "hence , the system is essentially in a state of weak topological phase of coupled topological wires .",
    "the fact that there is no spectral flow in the energy is because , in the limit of weak coupling , the boundary states of the 1d wires do not have spectral flow anyway .",
    "thus , when coupled the boundary states will not generically disperse sufficiently strong to reach the bulk energy bands , and even if they did they would not spectrally connect the lower band to the upper band .",
    "this behavior of course has its counterpart in the entanglement spectrum where the entanglement modes cross @xmath1 but do not flow between @xmath66 and @xmath184 .",
    "as we mentioned earlier , the abelian and non - abelian phases of the kitaev model can be distinguished in their entanglement properties by additional contributions that appear in the non - abelian phases when the system has edge states . in the present case of the rkd model ,",
    "if we were to compute the entanglement using open boundary conditions in the @xmath182 direction , the degenerate zero modes from the two surfaces will contribute additional entanglement to the system , similar to what happens in the 2d kitaev model .",

    "we have found that the derivation of the factorization of the density matrix continues to hold , regardless of whether the @xmath0 has vortex configurations .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath0 gauge field will continue to contribute the same amount of entanglement entropy as it did for the ground state .",
    "consequently , any change to the entanglement of the system will arise from the majorana modes that are trapped by the @xmath0 vortices .",
    "this allows us to easily study the entanglement in the presence of the @xmath0 flux excitations of the gauge field .    to generate a vortex",

    "the majorana fermions will feel the presence of the vortex lines through the phases of the hopping parameters .",
    "such vortex lines can induce states in the gap of the system when the bulk is topologically nontrivial . even though these states will be localized to either region @xmath51 or @xmath52",
    ", they can contribute to the entanglement of the system .",
    "for simplicity , we consider two of the cases of the previous section , namely the strong topological state at @xmath187 and the weak topological state at @xmath190 . as we now discuss , there is a clear distinction between the entanglement modes of both cases when vortices are introduced .    in figs .",
    "[ vortexweak]a , b we show the energy spectrum with and without the vortex lines when @xmath190 .",

    "it was shown in @xcite that under these circumstances , there is a @xmath0 classification of the state .",
    "the invariant associated with this classification determines the stability of gapless majorana modes that propagate along the vortex line .",
    "we can infer from the number of crossings in the energy and entanglement spectrum that the types of gapless majorana modes we have obtained have a different @xmath0 invariant for the @xmath190 and @xmath187 cases .",
    "the weak topological state presents gapless majorana modes that cross zero energy an even number of times , whereas in the strong topological state the majorana mode crosses zero an odd number of times .",
    "this feature is also present in the entanglement spectrum .",
    "such crossings lead to additional entanglement in the system , with respect to the case of no vortices and with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we further emphasize this point in fig.[vortexweak]e and fig.[vortexstrong]e by showing the difference @xmath208 , where @xmath209 is the entanglement entropy of region @xmath51 when the vortex lines are present ( absent ) .",
    "there is an additional contribution that is approximately @xmath210 for each of the crossings obtained in the entanglement spectrum . in the weak topological state",
    "this contribution comes from the two crossings @xmath211 , whereas in the strong topological state this occurs only at @xmath206 .",
    "in this work , we have explored the entanglement properties of a three dimensional generalization of the kitaev model proposed by ryu .",
    "we have shown that the entanglement entropy separates into a contribution from the @xmath0 gauge field and the majorana degrees of freedom , in the same way that it occurs for the kitaev model .",
    "we took advantage of these properties to explore the behavior of the entanglement spectrum of both weak and strong topological phases of the model proposed by ryu .",
