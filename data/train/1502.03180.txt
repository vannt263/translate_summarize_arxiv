    "the @xmath2 annihilation process is most suitable to study fragmentation functions among all different high energy reactions , as there is no hadron involved in the initial state .",
    "the one dimensional fragmentation functions can be studied via inclusive process , while , the 3d information can only be extracted from semi - inclusive process .",
    "higher twist terms may have very important contributions to azimuthal asymmetries and spin asymmetries@xcite , which are usually measured in experiments to study the properties of fragmentation functions and parton distribution functions .",
    "collinear expansion , first developed in 1980s , seems to be the unique method to calculate leading twist and higher twist contributions in a systemic way .",
    "this method was applied to inclusive dis process@xcite to get the cross section up to twist-4 level at first .",
    "it was summarized as four steps@xcite , and was applied to sidis to get the form of azimuthal asymmetries up to twist-3@xcite and twist-4@xcite .",
    "recently , we applied collinear expansion to inclusive @xmath2 annihilation process@xcite and semi - inclusive process@xcite .",
    "collinear expansion was inspired by the collinear approximation , which is stated as follows .",
    "* we only keep the collinear component of the quark momentum , @xmath3 .",
    "* we only keep the plus component of the gluon field , @xmath4 .",
    "this approximation is reasonable , if we are only care about the leading twist contributions , since other components are power suppressed compared to the plus component .",

    "we see , these soft matrices are automatically gauge invariant .",
    "if we are going to the twist-3 level , these transverse components can not be simply neglected any more .",
    "so , we need the collinear expansion to take them back into account by the following steps@xcite .",
