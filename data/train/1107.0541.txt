    "fractional action cosmology ( fac ) is based on the principles and formalism of the fractional calculus applied to cosmology .",
    "the fractional derivative and fractional integrals are the main tools in fractional calculus , where the order of differentiation or integration is not an integer .",
    "the fractional calculus is immensely useful in various branches of mathematics , physics and engineering @xcite . in doing fac",
    ", one can proceed in two different ways @xcite : the first one is quite easy as one has to replace the partial derivatives in the einstein field equations with the corresponding fractional derivatives ; the second technique involves deriving the field equations and geodesic equations from a more fundamental way , namely starting with the principle of least action and replacing the usual integral with a fractional integral .",
    "this later technique is more useful in giving extra features of the fac @xcite : rami introduced the fac by introducing the fractional time integral , @xmath0 here @xmath1 is the gamma function , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 constant and @xmath5 .",
    "the variation yields an extra term in the field equations which he termed as ` variable gravitational constant @xmath6 ' .",
    "moreover , when the weight function in the fractional time integral is replaced with a sinusoidal function , then the solution of the corresponding field equations yield a variable cosmological constant and an oscillatory scale factor @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 reduces to the standard action . in @xcite",
    ", the authors extended the previous study by working out with a general weight function : @xmath9 several examples were studied and cosmological parameters were calculated in there .",
    "an interesting feature of fac is that it yields an expanding universe whose scale factor goes like power law form or exponential form depending on the choice of the weight function .",
    "hence cosmic acceleration can be modeled in fac .",
    "reconstruction of potentials has been done by several authors in various cases .",
    "capozziello et al @xcite considered scalar - tensor theories and reconstruct their potential and coupling by demanding a background @xmath10cdm cosmology .",
    "in the framework of phantom quintessence cosmology , @xcite used the noether symmetry approach to obtain general exact solutions for the cosmological equations.in this paper , we are going to reconstruct the potentials and scalar fields , namely , quintessence , phantom , tachyonic , k - essence , dbi - essence , hessence , dilaton field and yang - mills field .",
    "such reconstructions have been studied previously in other gravitational setups @xcite . to get more physical insight into the model , we express scale factor in three useful forms @xcite namely emergent , logamediate and intermediate scenarios , under which the universe expands differently .",

    "now consider there is an interaction between normal matter and dark energy .",
    "dark energy interacting with dark matter is a promising model to alleviate the cosmic coincidence problem . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors studied the signature of such interaction on large scale cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature anisotropies . based on the detail analysis in perturbation equations of dark energy and dark matter when they are in interaction , they found that the large scale cmb , especially the late integrated sachs wolfe effect , is a useful tool to measure the coupling between dark sectors .",
    "it was deduced that in the 1@xmath23 range , the constrained coupling between dark sectors can solve the coincidence problem . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a general formalism to study the growth of dark matter perturbations when dark energy perturbations and interactions between dark sectors were presented .",
    "they showed that the dynamical stability on the growth of structure depends on the form of coupling between dark sectors .",
    "moreover due to the influence of the interaction , the growth index can differ from the value without interaction by an amount up to the observational sensibility , which provides an opportunity to probe the interaction between dark sectors through future observations on the growth of structure .    due to this interaction ,",
    "the normal matter and dark energy are not separately conserved .",
    "the energy conservation equations for normal matter and dark energy are @xmath24 and @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the hubble parameter .    from equation ( 5 )",
