    "2 .   @xmath2 is a splitting sphere for @xmath0 , and any positive diagram of @xmath0 is disconnected .    henceforth , we shall prove theorem 2.1 .",
    "let @xmath15 be a 2-sphere in @xmath1 and @xmath18 a projection .",
    "put @xmath0 so that @xmath19 is a positive diagram . as usual way , we express @xmath0 in a bridge presentation .",

    "we assign an orientaion endowed from @xmath49 to @xmath41 and @xmath50 naturally ( see figure 2 ) .     and @xmath50 have the orientaions ]    for any arc @xmath41 of @xmath42 , @xmath51 .",

    "then , since no corner of @xmath60 intersects @xmath19 , and by lemma 2.3 , @xmath62 has non - zero intersection number with @xmath63 on @xmath15 as illustrated in figure 3 .",
    "this is a contradiction .",
    "has non - zero intersection number ]    for each face @xmath59 of @xmath40 and any point in the interior of any edge of @xmath60 , we can find an arc @xmath64 on @xmath59 satisfying the following property .",

    "lemma 2.4 assures the existence of such an arc @xmath64 .    to find a loop @xmath16 on @xmath2 with @xmath17",
    ", we depart a point in the interior of any edge of @xmath40 , trace arcs with the property ( * ) , and will arrive at the face on which we have walked . connecting these arcs , we will obtain an oriented loop @xmath16 in @xmath65 with a suitable orientaion such that @xmath16 has a positive intersection number with edges of @xmath40 on @xmath2 .",
    "thus we got an oriented loop @xmath16 in @xmath2 which has non - zero linking number with @xmath0 .",
    "since any loop in a splitting sphere is contractible in @xmath3 , we have the conclusion ( 1 ) .",
    "this completes the proof of theorem 2.1 .",
    "let @xmath0 be a positive knot or link in @xmath1 and @xmath2 be a decomposing sphere for @xmath0 .",
    "we put @xmath0 and @xmath2 as the proof of theorem 1.1 except that two points @xmath66 and @xmath67 of @xmath68 are in @xmath69 or @xmath70 .",
    "note that @xmath66 and @xmath67 can not be the ends of a single arc of @xmath71 because the tangle @xmath72 is trivial and @xmath2 is a decomposing sphere .",
    "hence , there are two arcs @xmath73 and @xmath74 of @xmath71 whose ends contain @xmath66 and @xmath67 respectively .",
    "we deform @xmath2 by an isotopy relative to @xmath0 so that @xmath75 @xmath76 .",
    "we take the number of bridges @xmath24 minimal .",
    "we take @xmath33 and @xmath78 minimal .",
    "then we obtain a connected graph @xmath40 in @xmath2 by regarding @xmath30 and @xmath79 as vertices and edges respectively .",
    "corners of each face of @xmath40 may contain two points @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "note that @xmath35 , otherwise @xmath2 is not a decomposing sphere since @xmath82 is a trivial tangle .",
    "if @xmath36 and @xmath83 , then @xmath84 gives a desired loop since @xmath75 @xmath76 .",
    "suppose that there is a vertex @xmath85 with valency 1 .",
    "then only one edge @xmath86 incident to @xmath85 , and hence exactly one of @xmath73 and @xmath74 is attached to @xmath85 or contained in @xmath85 .",
    "thus @xmath87 intersects @xmath14 in two points .",
    "since @xmath14 is prime , @xmath87 bounds a disk @xmath88 in @xmath15 which intersects @xmath19 in an unknotted arc . in the former case",
    ", @xmath89 lies under a subarc of @xmath90 by the minimality of the number of bridges @xmath24 .",
    "then by an isotopy of @xmath2 along the 3-ball which is bounded by @xmath91 , we can reduce @xmath33 .",
    "see figure 5 . in the later case , @xmath88 intersects @xmath0 in one point , and @xmath91 bounds a pair of a 3-ball and an unknotted subarc of @xmath92 by the minimality of @xmath24 .",
    "then an isotopy of @xmath2 along the pair can reduce @xmath33 .",
    "see figure 6 .",
    "suppose there exists a face @xmath59 as lemma 3.4 .",
    "then @xmath60 consists of an edge @xmath86 of @xmath40 and a subarc @xmath64 of the boundary of a vertex @xmath85 of @xmath40 . by lemma 3.2 , @xmath93 intersects @xmath94 .",
    "moreover , since the loop @xmath95 bounds a disk @xmath88 in @xmath15 , @xmath96 and @xmath64 meets exactly one of @xmath73 and @xmath74 , say @xmath73 .",
    "thus a loop @xmath97 intersects @xmath14 in two points . since @xmath14 is prime , @xmath98 intersects @xmath19 in an embedded arc .",
    "then , there are two posibilities for @xmath73 , @xmath99 or @xmath100 . in the formar case",
    ", @xmath101 bounds a pair of a 3-ball and an unknotted arc , and an isotopy of @xmath2 along the pair eliminates @xmath86 . in the later case",
    ", @xmath101 bounds a 3-ball , and an isotopy of @xmath2 along the 3-ball eliminates @xmath86 .",
    "these contradict the minimality of @xmath78 .",
    "hence we have a condition that @xmath40 has at least two vertices , every vertex has valency at least two , and all faces of @xmath40 in @xmath2 are disks .",
    "next , we pay attention to a face of @xmath40 in @xmath2 .",
    "if exactly one corner of @xmath59 meets @xmath73 or @xmath74 at one point , then @xmath59 and some @xmath46 have the intersection number @xmath104 , or a vertex which meets @xmath59 along the corner intersects some @xmath105 in one point .",
    "since @xmath62 and @xmath106 must have the intersection number zero , @xmath60 is bounded by a loop of @xmath40 consisting of a vertex and an edge @xmath86 , and @xmath93 intersects @xmath94 in one point . then lemma 3.4 gives the conclusion .    if some corners of @xmath59 meet both @xmath73 and @xmath74 , then the corners of @xmath59 have the intersection number zero with @xmath19 because @xmath2 and @xmath0 have the intersection number zero . in such a situation",
    ", we have a contradiction same as the proof of lemma 2.4 .    by lemma 3.5 , starting a face @xmath59 of @xmath40 in @xmath2 whose closure is a disk , we can get a loop @xmath16 in @xmath107 with @xmath108 .",
    "but this is imposible because any loop in @xmath107 is null - homotopic in @xmath3 or has linking number @xmath104 with @xmath0 .",
    "this finishes the proof of theorem 1.4 ."
