    "since the discovery of superconductivity in lafeas(o , f ) at @xmath4=26k,@xcite considerable attention has been paid to iron - based superconductors ( scs ) with a variety of crystal structures containing stacked iron - pnictide ( or -chalcogenide ) layers.@xcite the maximum values of @xmath4 thus far achieved are 54 - 56k@xcite and 39k@xcite in the  1111 \" ( @xmath5feaso ; @xmath5=rare earth ) and  122 \" ( @xmath6fe@xmath0as@xmath7 ; @xmath6=alkaline earth or eu ) groups , respectively . despite intensive research , the detailed mechanism of the superconductivity ,",
    "for example , the symmetry of the sc order parameter , remains highly controversial.@xcite it has been revealed that iron - based scs have a unique fermi surface ( fs ) structure , typically consisting of two- or three - hole and two - electron sheets.@xcite the 1111 and 122 parent compounds undergo fs reconstruction associated with an antiferromagnetic ( af ) order of fe moments at @xmath8.@xcite with the suppression of @xmath8 via dopings@xcite or the application of pressure ( @xmath9),@xcite the superconducting ( sc ) ground state can be triggered .",
    "hence , magnetic instability may play an important role in iron - based scs .",
    "one of the intriguing issues of iron - based scs is the origin of non - fermi - liquid ( nfl ) behavior in their transport properties , such as @xmath2-linear resistivity,@xcite which emerges as @xmath8 is suppressed .",
    "the existence of a quantum critical point ( qcp ) , where the second - order transition temperature becomes zero , in iron - based scs has theoretically been proposed@xcite and has been demonstrated by the observation of a peak in the penetration depth , which is proportional to @xmath10 , at the optimal doping in the bafe@xmath0(as , p)@xmath0 system,@xcite for example ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the carrier number and quasiparticle effective mass , respectively ) .",
    "however , the existence of a qcp does not appear to be universal in iron - based scs nor is its relevance to the superconductivity clear , as suggested by phase diagrams of la - based 1111 systems,@xcite or the composition @xmath13 dependences of the penetration depth and drude weight of optical conductivity , both of which are related to @xmath14 , in the ba(fe@xmath15co@xmath16)@xmath0as@xmath0 system,@xcite for example .",
    "in addition , it has been argued that the interpretation of the nfl - like behavior may not be straightforward owing to the multiband character of iron - based systems.@xcite    pressure tuning of the electronic structures in stoichiometric compounds is a better means of studying a qcp than tuning by chemical substitution , which might obscure a qcp by the inevitably introduced randomness .",
    "we therefore study eufe@xmath0as@xmath0 under applied pressure ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the transition temperature @xmath17 is about 190k at ambient pressure , and the critical pressure @xmath1 , where indications of the transition at @xmath8 disappear and bulk superconductivity appears , is 2.5 - 2.7gpa.@xcite this sudden disappearance of @xmath17 is incompatible with a qcp .",
    "although the eu@xmath18 moments exhibit an af order at @xmath19@xmath2020k , the ferromagnetic ( fm ) alignment can be achieved at only a few teslas@xcite and the spin disorder scattering can be minimized.@xcite because of the large exchange field from the eu@xmath18 moments to the conduction electron spins , the upper critical field @xmath21 for the @xmath9-induced superconductivity is much smaller@xcite than that for other iron - based scs with similar @xmath4.@xcite these unique characteristics of eufe@xmath0as@xmath0 , thus , provide a significant opportunity to experimentally investigate the iron - based superconductivity with high @xmath4 of 30k .",
    "our measurements of transport properties and upper critical fields up to 3.2gpa reported below show no evidence of diverging quasiparticle effective mass at @xmath1 , indicating that the emergence of @xmath9-induced superconductivity in this clean system does not involve a qcp .",
    "however , it does not curtail the importance of spin fluctuations : we observe @xmath2-linear resistivity at pressures near @xmath1 and find that the fermi liquid @xmath3 dependence can be recovered by the application of a magnetic field .    @xmath22@xmath2 phase diagram in eufe@xmath0as@xmath0 with @xmath23=13 ( circles , bottom axis ) and 7@xcite ( triangles , top axis ) , deduced from the resistivity measurements up to 3.2gpa under zero field .",
