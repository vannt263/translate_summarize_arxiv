    "the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction is normally modelled in terms of several components , such as a central force , a spin - orbit force or a tensor force .",
    "these mathematical terms accommodate our phenomenological knowledge of the strong interaction , which , when used in a nuclear many - body context is subjected to different renormalization procedures . for the nuclear many - body problem , a given renormalization procedure leads to the derivation of an effective interaction , starting from a bare realistic nn interaction .",
    "the so - called bare nn interactions exhibit a strong coupling between low - momentum and high - momentum degrees of freedom generated from short - range details of the interaction . by `` bare '' we mean that the abovementioned strong coupling is left untouched .",
    "this coupling is included only implicitly , via various renormalization procedures , in the effective interactions used in for example shell - model studies .    as an example of bare nn interactions , the argonne interactions ( av ) , which are defined in terms of local operators in coordinate space ,",
    "show a strong short - range repulsion  @xcite .",
    "the resulting strong coupling between low- and high - momentum modes makes the many - body problem highly non - perturbative . on the other hand , in shell - model calculations ,",
    "the employed effective interactions are defined for a specific configuration space ( a strongly reduced hilbert space ) , normally called the model space .",
    "therefore , the effective interactions for the shell model should be renormalized to include the effects of virtual excitations to the configurations not included in the model space .",
    "although the properties and the effects of the full interaction and various renormalized interactions have been investigated extensively over the years , we feel that there are still important features of the nuclear interaction which deserve some special attention .",
    "in particular , we show here via several numerical studies , that the tensor force component of the bare nuclear interaction is left almost unaffected by various renormalization procedures .",
    "the monopole component of the tensor force , a component of great interest in studies of shell evolution ( see discussion below ) in nuclei toward the drip lines , is left almost unchanged under various renormalizations .",
    "this allows us thereby to extract simple physics interpretations from complicated many - body systems . in this work",
    "we label such a lack of renormalization influence as _ renormalization persistency _ , in short just r - persistency .",
    "the r - persistency is a property exhibited by specific terms of the original nuclear hamiltonian that are not affected , or barely affected , by the renormalization procedure .    on the experimental side ,",
    "present and future radioactive ion - beam facilities have made it possible to perform experiments that explore nuclei far from the stability line of the nuclear chart .",
    "many unexpected and new phenomena have been observed in such experiments carried out at radioactive ion - beam facilities worldwide .",
    "one of the most striking results is the breaking of the conventional shell structures in neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "such shell evolution , unexpected in the past , is known by now to occur mainly due to an unbalanced neutron to proton ratio and specific rbital - dependent components of the nuclear forces . in particular",
    ", the nuclear tensor force plays a key role here , as proposed by one of the authors  @xcite .",
    "one of the most useful quantities to probe the effect of tensor force is the so - called monopole matrix element .",
    "the monopole matrix element  @xcite of the two - body interaction between two single - particle states labelled @xmath6 and @xmath7 and total two - particle isospin @xmath8 is defined as @xmath9 for @xmath10   case , the definition is slightly different . ] . here",
    "@xmath11 denotes the anti - symmetrized two - body matrix element coupled to total angular momentum @xmath12 and total isospin @xmath8 .",
    "the monopole matrix element is crucial for shell evolution , because it affects the effective single particle energy linearly .",
    "for instance , if @xmath13 neutrons occupy the single - particle state @xmath7 , they shift the effective single particle energy of protons in the state @xmath6 as follows , @xmath14 where @xmath15 represents the change of the effective single particle energy of protons in the single - particle state @xmath6 .",
    "when we consider the tensor - force contribution , the monopole matrix elements always have different signs between a pair of spin - orbit partners .",
    "for example , the interaction matrix elements @xmath16 and @xmath17 have opposite sign . here",
    "we define @xmath18 and @xmath19 to represent the spin - orbit partners , that is , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , where @xmath22 stands for the orbital momentum of a given single - particle state . in this case , the tensor - force changes the spin - orbit splitting between @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the shell structure is also altered , in particular if we have a sizable number of neutrons in the single - particle state @xmath7 .",
    "in previous studies  @xcite , the tensor - force component in effective interactions for shell - model calculations was , for the sake of simplicity , modelled via the exchange of @xmath23 and @xmath24 mesons only .",
    "to a large extent , this yields results close to the tensor force in realistic nn interactions .",
    "in fact , this model describes rather well the experimental data in several mass regions  @xcite .",
    "however , it is far from trivial that the tensor force in effective interactions for the shell - model can be considered to be given by the exchange of @xmath23 and @xmath24 mesons only .",
    "the aim of this article is thus to investigate the r - persistency of the nuclear tensor force and understand the validity of the above assumption through theoretical studies , based on realistic nn interactions and microscopic theories for deriving effective interactions , focusing on the effective interaction for the shell model  .",
    "this work is organized as follows .",

    "[ sec : vlowk ] and sec .",
    "[ sec : veffsm ] , the r - persistency of the monopole part of the tensor force from various approaches to the effective interactions will be discussed . in sec .",
    "[ sec : multipole ] we present not only the monopole part but also the two - body matrix elements including multipole part of the various effective interactions and discuss their tensor force components . for the sake of completeness , we include analyses using other nn interactions in sec .  [ sec : n3lo ] .",
    "the last section contains our conclusions .",
    "the aim of this section is to give a brief sketch of the theoretical methods we employ in our analyses of the nuclear force . to construct the effective interactions for the nuclear shell model",
    ", we use many - body perturbation theory ( mbpt ) .",
    "however , as inputs to mbpt , we can not use bare realistic nn interactions directly , since their high - momentum components make mbpt non - convergent  @xcite .",
    "we integrate out this high - momentum components employing a renormalized interaction defined only in the low - momentum space below a certain sharp cutoff @xmath25 and designed not to change two - body observables like nn scattering data  @xcite .",
    "this recipe defines a cutoff dependent family of interactions , normally labelled as @xmath26 , which to be more specific , can be written as @xmath27 where @xmath28 indicates a projection operator onto the low - momentum space below @xmath25 .",
    "the term @xmath29 represents the correction term coming from the renormalization procedure . in other words",
    ", @xmath30 is a simple projection to a low - momentum space , while @xmath29 emerges as a result of the chosen renormalization procedure . by construction",
    ", @xmath26 approaches the original nn interaction in the limit @xmath31 .",
    "a complete renormalization scheme would generate higher - body forces as well , such as three - body and four - body forces , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively . in this work we limit ourselves to two - body ( @xmath34 ) interactions only .",
    "thus the cutoff dependence of physical quantities can be used to assess the error made by omitting more complicated many - body forces .",
    "the term @xmath30 should contain the long - range part of one - pion exchange interaction as a major component .",
    "next , we proceed to mbpt .",
    "the low - momentum interaction @xmath35 is a good starting point for mbpt because we can avoid the difficulty caused by the strong short - range repulsion . for a degenerate model space",
    ", the effective interaction @xmath36 can be written as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the so - called @xmath39-box , defined as @xmath40 here , the hamiltonian is divided into an unperturbed part @xmath41 and an interaction part @xmath42 , @xmath43 and the model space is set to be degenerate with respect to the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath41 with energy @xmath44 .",

    "( [ eq : fd_expansion ] ) represent the inclusion to infinite order of so - called folded diagrams , see refs .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "the @xmath39-box is given by diagrams which are valence - linked and irreducible , while @xmath45 indicates that only diagrams which are of second- or higher - order in terms of the interaction @xmath42 , are included , see for example fig .",

    "( [ eq : fd_expansion ] ) by the following iterative formula @xmath46 where @xmath47 . in this work ,",

    "included in the @xmath39-box .",
    "the diagrams are referred to as ( a ) particle - particle ladder , ( b ) hole - hole ladder and ( c ) core - polarization , respectively.,width=188 ]    by using this two - step method , we can start from an arbitrary bare realistic nn interaction .",
    "we calculate effective interactions starting from av8  @xcite and the chiral @xmath1n@xmath2lo interaction  @xcite .",
    "results using the av8 interaction are shown in the following sections while our results obtained with the @xmath1n@xmath2lo interaction are shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : n3lo ] for the sake of completeness .    finally , to extract the tensor component from the obtained effective interactions , we employ the spin - tensor decomposition employed in for example refs .",

    "@xmath51 ( as well as @xmath52 ) is shorthand for the set of quantum numbers @xmath53 , etc .",
    "the operator @xmath54 is defined as the scalar product @xmath55 , where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are irreducible tensors of rank @xmath58 , applying to operators in both spin and coordinate space .",

    "in this work we have presented a detailed analysis of various contributions to the nuclear tensor force as function of different renormalization procedures , starting with state - of - the - art nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interactions and ending up with effective interactions for the nuclear shell model .",
    "the monopole part of the tensor force is weakly or barely affected by various renormalization procedures , which in our case are represented by a renormalization of the bare interaction and many - body perturbation theory in order to obtain an effective shell - model interaction .",
    "this has lead us to introduce the concept of renormalization persistency ( r - persistency ) in the study of effective interactions .",
    "we studied the r - persistency of both renormalization procedures and showed via numerical studies , their intuitive general explanations and a detailed algebraic analysis of core - polarization terms in perturbation theory , that this is a very robust process .",
    "we have also shown that the r - persistency holds for two - body matrix elements including higher multipole components of the tensor force , although the deviation increases somewhat if multipole components are included in the comparison .",
    "we conclude that the two renormalization steps ( one for short - range correlation and the other for in - medium effects ) do not affect much either the monopole nor the multipole components of the tensor force , apart from slight differences between them .",
    "results obtained with two different interactions ( av8 and @xmath1n@xmath2lo ) lead us to the same conclusion , suggesting that the r - persistency of the tensor force for low - momentum states is a robust feature .",
    "this applies also to other interaction models than those studied here .",
    "the short - range part of the tensor force enters the renormalization of the central force , in particular in the @xmath62 channel , producing on average an increased attraction .",
    "since the modification of the tensor force appears to be small , the central force carries most of the renormalization effects beyond first order in perturbation theory .    because the r - persistency of the tensor force in effective interactions is a robust feature",
    ", it may give a simple and concrete starting point for examining and constructing effective interactions , especially phenomenological ones  @xcite .",
    "in particular , since the tensor force plays a significant role in the shell evolution for nuclear systems with either large neutron / proton or proton / neutron ratios , one can extract simple physics messages from complicated many - body systems .",
