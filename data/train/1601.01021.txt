    "superluminous supernovae ( slsne ) have been discovered almost a decade ago @xcite .",
    "they show a factor 10 to 100 times brighter than normal core - collapse supernovae ( sne ) , often well above @xmath4 absolute magnitude .",
    "it is believed that they are the explosion of massive stars which usually are found in low luminosity , star forming dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "but the physical origin of the extreme luminosity emitted remains speculative ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "the high luminosity of slsne makes them ideal to get information from the early universe and to explore the capability to use them as cosmological standard candles at much further distance than normal sne @xcite .    in order to be radioactively powered , as normal sne , slsne would require a too large nickel mass except for pair instability sne and hypernovae ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so competing , so competing alternatives have been proposed .",
    "one possible mechanism invoked to explain slsne is the energy injection by an accreting black hole that launches relativistic jets , or fallback scenario ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the interaction of the sn ejecta with dense circumstellar material ( csm ) is another proposed mechanism ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "another popular explanation is that a magnetar is formed by the collapse of a massive star .",
    "the magnetar is a strongly - magnetized , rapidly - rotating neutron star that loses rotational energy via magnetic dipole radiation .",
    "although some progress in the area were recently reported ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , other important aspects of the scenario are still unclear .    in this work",
    "we study two peculiar slsne of type ic ( lacking hydrogen ) , sn  2011kl and for asassn-15lh .",
    "sn  2011kl has been associated with the ultra - long - duration gamma ray burst  grb 111209a , at a redshift @xmath5 of 0.677 @xcite .",
    "its light curve ( lc ) was significantly over - luminous compared to other grb - associated sne , suggesting for the first time a link between sn - grb and slsne - ultra long grb ( ulgrb ) .",
    "the precise explosion time estimation makes this sn ideal for numerical modeling .",
    "more recently , asassn-15lh  at @xmath5 = 0.2326 was discovered by the all - sky automated survey for supernovae @xcite .",
    "it showed an hydrogen - poor spectrum , and the maximum luminosity was @xmath6 erg s@xmath7 , i.e. more luminous than any previously known sn .",
    "contrary to sn 2011kl , the explosion date of asassn-15lh  is unknown , and data before the luminous peak were less reliable than later .",
    "the optical emission was continuously detected for more than 100 days after the explosion .",
    "the spectrum lacked the broad h@xmath8 emission feature that would have evidenced interaction between the supernova and an h - rich circumstellar environment @xcite .",
    "magnetar models have been proposed for the two slsne of this work @xcite , even for the extremely luminous asassn-15lh .",
    "however , the analysis was based on simplistic assumptions that neglected the dynamic effects on the ejecta . here",
    "we shall study the magnetar scenario using hydrodynamic calculations which incorporate the dynamical effect and considering the limit imposed by the neutron star ( ns ) matter equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "we include an extra source of energy due to a rapidly rotating and strongly magnetized ns ( or `` magnetar '' ) in our one - dimensional lte radiation hydrodynamic code @xcite .",
    "a spherical young magnetar releases its rotational energy at a well known rate described by the radiating magnetic dipole ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we assume that this energy is fully deposited and thermalized in the innermost layers of our pre - supernova model .",
    "this assumption as well as a large inclination @xmath9 is the same used in previous numerical works of magnetar powered sn light curves @xcite .",
    "powerful enough magnetars may force the envelope to expand at velocities comparable to the speed of light ( see below , particularly fig .",
    "[ fig : veloasa ] ) .",
    "therefore , we have modified our code to properly include relativistic velocities .",
    "a detailed description of our treatment of relativistic radiating hydrodynamics will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "our hydrodynamical calculations simulate the explosion of an evolved star , followed consistently until core collapse condition .",
    "the pre - sn he star models of different masses used in this paper were calculated by @xcite .",
    "the explosion itself is simulated as usual by the injection of a certain energy ( a few @xmath10  erg ) at the innermost layers of our pre - sn models .",
    "in addition to the explosion energy , the rotational energy lost by newly born magnetar is included .",
    "once the ns momentum of inertia and radius @xmath11 are fixed , this energy source essentially depends on two parameters , the strength of the dipole magnetic field , @xmath12 , and the initial rotational period , @xmath13 ( see , e.g. , equations 1 and 2 of @xcite ) .",
    "it is equally possible to use the spin - down timescale ( @xmath14 ) and magnetar energy loss rate ( @xmath15 ) as the free parameters to be determined by fitting the observed light curve ( lc ) .",
    "therefore the magnetar luminosity can be written as @xmath16 with @xmath17 and @xmath18    the values of @xmath12 and @xmath13 can be found later from @xmath14 , @xmath15 , assuming an ns mass .",
    "then , the radius and momentum of inertia are found for a given eos . in this way",
    ", one avoids to assume from beforehand explicit values of the nss properties .",
    "this method opens the possibility to accommodate a variety of ns structures , which is relevant because of our poor knowledge of the eos at these extreme conditions .    along the calculation , if the photosphere recedes deep enough so that part of the magnetar energy is directly deposited outside the photosphere , we add this energy to the bolometric luminosity .",
    "the same treatment is used for @xmath0ni deposition @xcite .",
    "we implicitly assume that the magnetar ( or the @xmath0ni decay ) produces hard photons than can be trapped even if the ejecta is optically thin to optical photons . during these epochs , usually after about 60 days ( although this depends on the progenitor mass and energy ) , the emitted luminosity is almost the same as the magnetar luminosity .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter g15 ) , recently analyzed the lc and spectrum of sn  2011kl .",
    "a low ejecta mass @xmath19 2.4 m@xmath20 and high explosion energy @xmath19 5.5 @xmath10 erg were obtained from their analysis .",
    "the radiative output of sn  2011kl locates it in between the grb - sne and slsne .",
    "a large @xmath0ni mass @xmath19 1 m@xmath20 was found necessary in order to reproduce the high observed luminosity .",
    "this large amount of radioactive material seems to be neither compatible with the spectrum properties nor with the low mass ejecta , as pointed by g15 .",
    "a magnetar source was then proposed by the authors to explain the lc .",
    "we used the code describe in   [ sec : numeric_cls ] to study sn  2011kl .",
    "one advantage of the hydrodynamics calculations is that the explosion time ( @xmath21 ) is fully determined from the assumed physical parameters .",
    "the grb detection of sn  2011kl establishes a tight value of @xmath22 then , it is an ideal target of study . motivated by the values proposed by g15 we assumed a pre - sn he star of 4 m@xmath20 with a cut mass ( m@xmath23 ) of 1.5 m@xmath20 corresponding to an ejected mass ( @xmath24 ) of 2.5 m@xmath20 and an explosion energy of 5.5@xmath10 erg . while the lc of sn  2011kl is unlikely to be powered only by @xmath0nisome amount of radioactive material is usually expected to be produced during the explosion .",
    "we assume a @xmath0ni mass of 0.2 m@xmath20 consistent with radioactive yield of energetic sn @xcite .",
    "we extensively explored the magnetar parameter space and found a reasonable agreement with the data for @xmath25 ms and magnetic field @xmath26  g. figure  [ fig : cl11kl ] shows this model with thick solid line .",
    "our values lie out of the ranges given by g15 whose analysis gave @xmath27  ms and @xmath28  g. the thin line of figure  [ fig : cl11kl ] show the result of our hydrodynamical calculations assuming the same parameters as in g15 .",
    "we found a poor match to the data as opposed to g15 ( see their fig .  2 ) .",
    "we note that we have used opal opacity tables with an opacity floor of 0.2 @xmath29 g@xmath7 corresponding to the electron scattering opacity for hydrogen free material .",
    "this value is usually assumed as gray opacity in lc magnetar models in the literature @xcite .",
    "however , with a lower and constant value of @xmath30 0.07 @xmath29 g@xmath7 , presumably used in g15 , we recovered a reasonable fit to the data for the magnetar parameters of g15 ( see dotted line of figure  [ fig : cl11kl ] ) .",
    "in addition , we present our results for a model powered only by @xmath0ni . a model with @xmath31)@xmath32 1 m@xmath20 is shown with a dashed line in figure  [ fig : cl11kl ] .",
    "even with this large amount of @xmath0ni we could not reach the high luminosity needed to explain sn  2011kl using our opacity prescription . while an non - standard source of energy is necessary to explain the peak luminosity , some amount of @xmath0ni ( @xmath33 0.08 m@xmath20 ) is also needed to explain the tail luminosity .",
    "magnetar models without nickel produce a larger contrast between peak and tail and thus a poor fit to the data .",
    "[ h ]    figure  [ fig : velo11kl ] shows the velocity profile at different times since the explosion for our preferred model ( solid thick line of fig .",
    "[ fig : cl11kl ] ) .",
    "initially , the shock wave propagates as in a standard explosion . later the dynamic effect is noticeable although not as extreme as the case of asassn-15lh ( see below ) .",
    "the extra heating source due to the magnetar swell the inner zones and produces larger velocities and a flat profile that raise steeply only at the outermost layers .",
    "the high ejecta velocity is consistent with the analysis by g15 who inferred that a large value of @xmath34 would explain the rather featureless spectrum by doppler line blending .",
    "we remark that here the opacity prescription is probably responsible for the differences found between our calculation and the analytic models presented by g15 .",
    "the hydrodynamic effects of the magnetar on the luminosity are not as important as in the case of asassn-15lh , although as shown in figure  [ fig : velo11kl ] , it is evident in the velocity evolution .",
    "[ hb ]      @xcite reported the discovery of the brightest known sn , asassn-15lh with a peak luminosity of @xmath19 2 @xmath35 erg s@xmath7 , almost two magnitudes brighter than the average observed slsne , and with total radiated energy of @xmath19 @xmath36 erg .",
    "the spectra presented some similarities to slsne - ic .",
    "magnetar models seem to be the most plausible explanation for this class of slsne .",
    "however , @xcite emphasized the difficulty to explain this object in the magnetar context . the short initial period @xmath19 1 ms required to match the lc properties could be in contradiction with the maximum rotational energy ( @xmath37 ) available that in turn is limited by the emission of gravitational waves .",
    "however , @xcite lately suggested that @xmath37 could be up to one order of magnitude larger than previous estimations , depending on the ns properties , but avoiding the problem raised by @xcite .",
    "we calculated a set of magnetar models to analyze the lc of asassn-15lh .",
    "here we use @xmath38 and @xmath14 as free parameters for the fitting ( see   [ sec : numeric_cls ] ) . in this way",
    ", we avoid including explicitly the properties of the ns . once the lc fit is admissible , we derived @xmath12 and @xmath13 as a function of the magnetar mass ( see bellow ) . figure  [ fig : cl15lh ] shows our results for a pre - sn he star of 4 m@xmath20 with m@xmath39= 1.5 m@xmath20 and m@xmath40 2.5 m@xmath20 ( thin red line ) and for a more massive model of he star 8 m@xmath20 with m@xmath23= 2 m@xmath20 and m@xmath41 6 m@xmath20 ( thick blue line ) .",
    "we assumed an initial explosion energy of 5.5@xmath10 erg although this has a minor effect on the results .",
    "also , we assumed that the sn exploded a week before the discovery .",
    "the magnetar parameters are in this case @xmath42 erg s@xmath7 and @xmath43 days . for the less massive model we could not reproduce the overall lc shape . a more massive pre - sn model with 8 @xmath3 or more",
    "is therefore needed to reproduce the temporal width of the lc . at @xmath44 100 days",
    ", there is a slight change on the lc slope in coincidence with the moment that the photosphere reaches the inner regions where the magnetar energy is directly deposited .",
    "the observable effect of this fact should potentially modify the spectral energy distribution , and deserve further investigation .",
    "figure  [ fig : valores ] shows the values of @xmath12 and @xmath13 as a function of the ns mass derived from @xmath45 and @xmath14 .",
    "for the structure of the magnetar we have assumed the data presented in table 12 of @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to the structure of a ns assuming the nuclear matter equation of state of @xcite that gives a mass radius relation similar to those currently favored by recent observations ( see fig .",
    "11b of @xcite ) .",
    "we have neglected rotational and magnetic effects on the ns structure . for comparison",
    ", we included the curve for the case of sn  2011kl which represents the location of other possible solutions ( i.e. the degeneracy of the parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) .",
    "physically possible solutions correspond to rotation periods larger than the critical breakup value . for the complete nss mass range , we found solutions that fulfill this condition . for the pre - sn model",
    "a specific value of m@xmath23 was assumed , but we have corroborated that changing this value in the range shown in figure  [ fig : valores ] produces a minor effect on the lc model .",
    "we conclude that initial periods ranging @xmath46 ms and magnetic fields of @xmath47  g related by the curve of figure  [ fig : valores ] provide a reasonable fit to the lc .",
    "these magnetar values are in good agreement with those proposed by @xcite although they assumed a lower ejecta mass of 3 m@xmath20 .",
    "however , we could not reproduce the data with such low mass progenitor .    here",
    "we should note that the uncertainty regarding @xmath21 could modify the exact value of the parameters . in any case",
    ", the scope of this analysis is to show that the magnetar scenario is plausible for this object and not to provide definitive values of the physical parameters .",
    "figure  [ fig : veloasa ] shows the velocity profiles for our preferred model of 8 m@xmath20 . in this case the magnetar is extremely powerful and the dynamical effect is more noticeable than for the case of sn  2011kl .",
    "the energy permanently supplied by the magnetar impulses all the envelope at high velocities and particularly the outermost layers . as result , a few days after the explosion most of the material moves at constant velocity , which increases with time due to the permanent injection of magnetar energy .",
    "this dynamic behavior should have a clear effect on the spectrum .",
    "broad line features at 4100 and 4400  were observed in the optical spectrum of asassn-15lh between 13 and 20 days after maximum implying very high velocities of @xmath19 20.000 km s@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this timing and velocity are fully consistent with the model shown in figure  [ fig : veloasa ] .",

    "black lines correspond to the parameters for sn  2011kl whereas red lines denote the case of assasn-15lh .",
    "for comparison , the critical spin period is given with a dashed line .",
    "notice that for both cases the ns can rotate at the required rate .",
    "[ fig : valores ] ]",
    "we were able to reproduce the lc of sn  2011kl and asassn-15lh in the context of magnetar - powered models with physically allowed parameters ( the ns rotating below breakup point ) .    by adopting the magnetar luminosity and spin - down timescale as free parameters we could separate the lc fit from any assumption on the ns structure .",
    "the usual parameters ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) could be recovered afterwards by assuming the ns configuration for a given eos .",
    "we have shown that this leads to a degeneracy between @xmath12 and @xmath13 which in turn depend on the properties of the nuclear matter eos which is poorly known .    for sn",
    "2011kl we found @xmath48 erg s@xmath7 and @xmath49 days .",
    "a family of values of @xmath13 and @xmath12 were derived that lie outside the ranges proposed by g15 .",
    "we ascribe the differences to the opacity values adopted and not to the hydrodynamic effects .",
    "we note that in addition to the extra source of energy due to a magnetar , some non - negligible amount of @xmath0ni ( @xmath33 0.08 m@xmath20 ) was also necessary in our calculation to produce the lc peak and tail .    regarding the extreme luminosity of asassn-15lh the overall shape of the lc was reproduced for @xmath50 erg s@xmath7 and @xmath51 days .",

    "translating @xmath24 into a zero - age main - sequence mass , @xmath53 , of the progenitor involves several uncertainties .",
    "it is particularly important whether the he features can be hidden in the early spectra of slsne @xcite . assuming that this is the case",

    "the progenitor mass is close to the boundary mass between bh and ns formation @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that hydrodynamical modeling of the lc can provide better constraints on the highly uncertain progenitor masses of magnetars than the analytic prescription .",
    "our treatment of the sn evolution illustrates the importance of the dynamical effects on the ejecta , especially in cases of powerful magnetars .",
    "the homologous expansion , usually assumed in sn studies , can be broken because of the additional energy source .",
    "this could have an important effect on the line formation and the photospheric velocity evolution .",
    "for asassn-15lh we found a total energy release by the magnetar of @xmath57 erg , which is one order of magnitude larger than the initial explosion energy .",
    "for the more moderate sn  2011kl we obtained @xmath58 erg . in general , the dynamical effects on the expansion of the ejecta become significant when the magnetar energy is comparable with the explosion energy .",
