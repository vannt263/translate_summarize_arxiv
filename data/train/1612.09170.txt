    "recently , a lot of attention has been directed to the subject of excitons in bulk crystals due to experimental observation of the so - called yellow exciton series in cu@xmath0o up to a large principal quantum number of @xmath2 @xcite-@xcite .",
    "such excitons in copper oxide , in analogy to atomic physics , have been named rydberg excitons . by virtue of their special properties",
    "rydberg excitons are of fascination in solid state and optical physics . these objects , whose size scales as the square of the rydberg principal quantum number @xmath3 , are ideally suited for fundamental quantum interrogations , as well as detailed classical analysis .",
    "one could expect that rydberg excitons would have been described , in analogy to rydberg atoms , by rydberg series of hydrogen atoms , but it turned out that this generic method of description should has been revised because diameter of such exciton is much larger then wavelength of light needed to create it  @xcite .",
    "the observation and detailed description of rydberg excitons have opened a new field in condensed matter spectroscopy . in analogy to medium of rydberg atoms , where it has been possible to obtain a large optical nonlinearity at the single photon level and to realize a lot of quantum optics sophisticated experiments such as optical kerr effect or correlated states @xcite , it is expected that the medium of rydberg excitons is also fertile area .",
    "the unique combination of their huge size , long radiative lifetimes , possible strong dipole - dipole interaction and , what is the most important advantage for future technological applications , miniaturization of media / samples they are realized in , can be exploited to perform robust light - exciton quantum interfaces for quantum information processing purposes .",
    "solid bulk media are systems well worth considering for storing quantum information because they have a number advantages over gases , where a lot of experiments have been done [ for recent review see ref.@xcite ] : they are easy to prepare , diffusion processes are not so fast , much higher densities of interacting particles can be achieved @xcite .",
    "a common class of solids used within a quantum information context are rare - earth - metal - doped crystals , where a long time over one minute of storing information has been achieved @xcite , @xcite , and nitrogen - vacancy centres in diamond @xcite which have relatively long spin coherence . however , the size of solid samples used in such experiments is of order of several millimetres .",
    "rydberg excitonic samples are much smaller : observation of dipolar blockade in bulk cu@xmath0o @xcite and quantum coherence @xcite were performed in samples as small as several tens of micrometers .",
    "realization of these experiments have unlocked the plethora of dynamical effect which might be observed in rydberg excitons media ; one of examples is the electromagnetically induced transparency , the performing of which in cu@xmath0o bulk crystal will be the next step toward potential implementation this medium for quantum information processing .",
    "electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite , is one of the important effect in quantum optics as it allows for the coherent control of materials optical properties .",
    "the generic eit bases on extraordinary dispersive properties of an atomic medium with three active states in the @xmath4 configuration .",
    "this phenomenon leads to the significant reduction of absorption of a resonant probe , weak laser field by irradiating the medium with a strong control field making an otherwise opaque medium transparent .",
    "it leads to dramatic changes of dispersion properties of the system : absorption forms a dip called the transparency window and approaches zero while dispersion in the vicinity of this region becomes normal with a slope , which increases for a decreasing control field .",
    "the resonant probe beam is now transmitted almost without losses .",
    "eit has been explained by destructive quantum interference between different excitation pathways of the excited state or alternatively in terms of a dark superposition of states . since at least 20 years",
    "there has been a considered level of activity devoted to eit @xcite , which has been motivated by recognition of a number of its applications among which slowing and storing the light , see i.e. , @xcite-@xcite and references therein , which allows for realization of delay lines and buffers in optical circuits are well - known examples .",
    "a remarkable quenching of absorption due to eit in an undoped bulk of cu@xmath0o in a @xmath4-type configuration involving lower levels was examining in @xcite .",
    "demonstration of eit in rydberg atoms involving the ladder levels scheme by mohapatra _",
    "et al _ @xcite has taken advantage of their unique properties . in rydberg systems",
    "the ladder configuration enables to couple long - living metastable , initially empty upper level with the levels coupled by the probe field .",
    "rydberg excitons in cu@xmath0o offer a great variety of accessible states for creating the ladder configuration what enables such a choice of coupling which could be realized by accessible lasers or eventually to be suitable for desirable coherent interaction implementations .",
    "rydberg eit has also attracted attention with demonstration of interaction - enhanced absorption imaging of rydberg excitations @xcite .",
    "the non - linear response of rydberg medium is proportional to the group index and to the strength of the dipole - dipole interaction and both of them can be extremely large .",
    "eit provides a possibility of dissipation - free sensing and probing of highly excited rydberg states and coherent coupling of rydberg states via eit could be used for cross - phase modulation and photon entanglement .",
    "rydberg excitons offer an unprecedented potential to study above mentioned phenomena in solids .",
    "it seems that , similar to rydberg atoms , strong dipolar interaction between rydberg excitons could appear and leads to so - called photon - blockade , which offers promising means to tailor deterministic single - photon sources @xcite , and to realize photonic phase gates @xcite . up till now the researches involving in rydberg excitons , both theoretical and experimental , have concentrated on their static properties ( excitonic states , electro- and magneto - optical properties ) .",
    "the first step toward study the photon blockade , quantum non - linear optics , and many - body physics with rydberg excitons is the realization of rydberg eit .",
    "here we focuse our interest on dynamical aspects and properties of rydberg excitons in cu@xmath0o and show , that the rydberg excitonic states can be used to perform the eit .",
    "we indicate excitonic states which guarantee of the most efficient realization of the experiment taking into account our previous results concerning excitonic resonaces as well as damping parameters and the matrix elements of momentum operator .    our paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we present the assumptions of the considered model and solve the time evolution equations , obtaining an analytical expression for the susceptibility and the group index .",
    "we use the obtained expression to compute the real and imaginary part of the susceptibility and the group index ( sec .",
    "iii ) , for a cu@xmath0o crystal slab .",
    "we examine in details the changes of both real and imaginary part caused by changes of driving parameters ( for example , the rabi frequencies ) . in sec .",
    "iv we draw conclusions of the model studied in this paper and indicate the optimal choice of rydberg states to realize the eit and light slowing .",
    "the possible practical importance is also indicated .",
    "the phenomenon of eit , described qualitatively above , has been studied theoretically for various configurations of the transitions and probe and control beams .",
    "below we propose a theoretical description for the case when the atomic transitions are replaced by intra excitonic transitions in rydberg excitons media .",
    "condensed matter exhibits quite a variety of three - level systems where induced transparency could be achieved in much the same way as done with atoms . yet",
    "dephasings , which can easily break the coherence of the population trapping state , are typically much faster in solids than in atomic vapors ; it has caused difficulty to observe a large electromagnetic induced transparency effect in solids .",
    "this difficulty can be overcame by using the rydberg exciton states .",
    "higher states have much larger lifetimes and the dephasing can reach the value which enables observation of the eit effect . below we will consider a cu@xmath0o crystal as a medium where the eit phenomenon can be realized .",
    "we use the ladder configuration ( fig .",
    "[ fig_schemat ] ) , consisting of three levels @xmath5 , and @xmath6 . as in previous works on rydberg excitons ,",
    "we focus our attention on the so - called yellow series associated with the lowest inter - band transition between the @xmath7 valence band and the @xmath8 conduction band . because both band - edge states are of even parity ,",
    "the lowest @xmath9 exciton state is dipole - forbidden , whereas all the _ p _ states are dipole - allowed ; the @xmath9 to @xmath10 transition is also allowed .",
    "we have chosen the valence band as the @xmath11 state .",
    "the @xmath12 and @xmath13 excitonic states are the @xmath14 and @xmath6 states , respectively . to obtain the @xmath15 state we assume that a constant electric field @xmath16 is applied to the considered system .",
    "as it was recently shown , the applied field splits the @xmath17 levels into @xmath15 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 states@xcite .",
    "let the probe / signal field of frequency @xmath19 and amplitude @xmath20 couples the ground state @xmath11 of energy @xmath21 with an excited state @xmath14 of energy @xmath22 .",
    "the control field of frequency @xmath23 and amplitude @xmath24 couples a state @xmath6 of energy @xmath25 with the state @xmath14 , as it is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_schemat ] .",
    "the hamiltonian of such three level system interacting with an electromagnetic wave , in the rotating wave approximation reads @xmath26\\vert",

    "we denote by @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively the probe and the control beam detunings .",
    "while propagation effects for the control field are neglected the evolution of the system is described by the following set of bloch equations @xmath39 parameters @xmath40 , @xmath41 , describe damping of exciton states and are determined by exciton - damping mechanisms comprising , temperature - dependent homogeneous broadening due to phonons and broadening due to structural imperfections and eventual impurities .",
    "the relaxation damping rates for the coherence are denoted by @xmath42 , @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that in the above equations only the relaxations inside the three level system are considered , so the total probability for the populations of the three levels is conserved : @xmath43 . in order to study propagation of the signal field inside the medium the bloch equations",
    "are accompanied by the maxwell propagation equation for the rabi frequency @xmath44 of the probe pulse , which reads in the slowly varying envelope approximation @xmath45 where @xmath46 @xmath47 being the density of excitons , @xmath48 is the transition dipole matrix element , @xmath19 is the electromagnetic wave frequency .    in the first order perturbation with respect to the probe field",
    ", the evolution of our system reduces to the set of the following equations for the density matrix    @xmath49    taking into account that for a weak probe pulse polarization of the medium for a given frequency is proportional to the signal field @xmath50 and to the susceptibility @xmath51 it has a form @xmath52 the steady state complex exciton susceptibility exhibited to the probe field has the form @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the vacuum dielectric constant .",
    "the susceptibility is a complex , rapidly varying function of @xmath55 , its real part describe the dispersion and imaginary show the absorption of the medium . due to the dependence of the refractive index @xmath56 on electric susceptibility we define the group index @xmath57 which account on time delay of a pulse propagating in a medium with the group velocity @xmath58",
    "so the slope of dispersion inside the transparency window determines the propagation of the pulse inside the medium .",
    "note that derivative of the real part of the susceptibility may be positive ( normal dispersion ) or negative ( anomalous dispersion ) ; in the latter case the group velocity may even become negative . +",
    "another way of explaining electromagnetically induced transparency applies the notion of dressed states .",
    "consider the subspace spanned by the states a and c ( the energy @xmath25 of the latter being moved by the photon energy @xmath59 ) , coupled by the interaction @xmath60",
    ". the dressed states are eigenvectors of the hamiltonian restricted to this subspace .",
    "the eigenenergies are shifted from their bare values ; if the control field is at resonance the shift is equal to @xmath61 .",
    "if the probe photon is tuned right in the middle between the dressed eigenenergies , the transition amplitudes from the state b interfere destructively .",
    "+ in the case of spectrally not too wide pulses one can approximate the susceptibility to the lowest term of its taylor expansion at the line center and in such a case the probe pulse can has the form @xmath62 this means that the pulse moves with the velocity @xmath63 with its shape essentially unchanged apart from an exponential modification of its height and an overall phase shift .",
    "the group velocity is approximately the velocity of the pulse maximum ( exactly if there is no damping ) .",
    "we have performed numerical calculations for a cu@xmath0o crystal slab with a thickness 30 @xmath64 .",
    "a constant electric field @xmath16 is applied in the @xmath34-direction . using the formulas ( [ chiladder ] ) and ( [ group_index ] ) we have calculated the real and imaginary part of the susceptibility and the group index .",
