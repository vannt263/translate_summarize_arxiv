    "it is important to characterize as completely as possible the properties of observable quantities in a non - gaussian distribution . in this paper , we discuss under what conditions local non - gaussian observables can be inhomogeneous to a measurable level .",
    "consider subdividing the observable sky of size @xmath4 into a large number of small patches of size @xmath5 , and measuring cosmological observables on each of these patches .",
    "the effective values of the cosmological parameters can differ from one patch to the other , since each small part of the sky experiences a different local background .",
    "in particular primordial curvature fluctuations within a small patch are defined with respect to a local background which can be decomposed into a cosmological background solution of the homogeneous field equations , plus the cumulative effect of random modes with wavelengths larger than the size @xmath6 of the patch ( but smaller than the size @xmath4 of the observable sky ) . since different patches of our observable universe",
    "are affected by different contributions from the random long wavelength modes , each patch is defined on a different background configuration . as a consequence , quantities characterizing the properties of @xmath1-point functions of curvature fluctuations can be different in one patch or the other .",
    "indeed the effect of long - wavelength modes on the small - scale gravitational collapse of dark matter halos is described by the peak - background split in astrophysics and is used to explain the biased clustering of dark matter halos @xcite . in a non - gaussian field the long - wavelength modes also modulate the amplitude of the short - wavelength density perturbations which can lead to a distinctive scale - dependent bias which is a powerful probe of primordial non - gaussianity @xcite .",
    "of course there is also a cosmic variance between patches , even if there are no non - zero higher order correlators .",

    "correlators between @xmath1-point functions measured in one patch , and @xmath2-point functions measured in another patch , depend on @xmath3-point functions in the entire sky .",
    "as an example , we will show that the autocorrelation of @xmath0 between different patches depends on a class of parameters controlling 5- and 6-point functions , that in the single - source case reduce to squares of trispectrum parameters .",
    "this implies that inhomogeneities in quantities characterizing non - gaussian observables can be measurable , since at present we have only weak or even no constraints on parameters controlling higher - order point functions in the full sky .",
    "moreover , although the optimal way to constrain higher @xmath1-point functions in the full sky would be through a direct analysis of that correlator , in practice this is exceedingly time consuming and computer intensive .",

    "therefore , our method of relating @xmath1-point functions to inhomogeneities of lower - order functions should also provide a feasible and practical way of constraining higher - point functions in the full sky , even though the method is suboptimal .",

    "the variation of @xmath0 measured on different 3%-of - the - sky patches is therefore of the same order of magnitude as the boomerang @xmath87-@xmath8 accuracy for detecting @xmath0 .    in general , when estimating @xmath1-point functions on a limited part of the sky , observational errors increase ( at least ) proportionally to @xmath88 ( @xmath89 denotes the fraction of the sky which is observed ) , since there is less data available in a small patch .",
    "therefore when dividing the sky into , say , one hundred equal patches , the error bar on every observation will grow by at least a factor of ten compared to the full sky measurement . on the other hand , we then correlate , over the full sky , the measurements of @xmath1 and @xmath2-point functions evaluated in distinct small patches .",
    "this implies that , for the aim of constraining the values of higher - order point functions in the full sky , we are able to regain much of the accuracy we had previously lost .",
    "there is however an important second effect to take into account : when making measurements of @xmath1-point functions in a patch smaller than the entire sky , a smaller number of correlators can be built .",
    "for example , for @xmath90 , when estimating @xmath0 in a patch the range of scales available is reduced , thereby limiting our ability to analyze the squeezed limit of triangles  .",

    "for example , for patches covering one per cents of the sky , @xmath93 , and the patch size , which determines @xmath92 , enters only in the logarithm , reducing the accuracy only by a factor of order three with respect to full sky .",
    "we will not develop this issue further in our work , but to account for these logarithmic effects we simply increase by one order of magnitude the values of our expected constraints on higher order @xmath1-point functions in the full sky .",
    "we will see that , even within this conservative estimate , we can find interesting constraints on these quantities .    to conclude this section ,",
    "let us point out that alternative techniques based on needlets analysis of cmb data are particularly well suited for testing non - gaussianity in selected regions of the sky .",
    "this fact has already been used for investigating inhomogeneity of non - gaussianity in different , large regions of the sky in @xcite , with the main aim of investigating foreground contaminations and directional variations of @xmath0 .",
    "although no significant hints of anisotropies have been reported in those studies , it would be very interesting to apply the same techniques to a collection of smaller regions of the sky , to instead test inhomogeneities of @xmath0 along the lines we suggest here .",
    "we have learned from the previous analysis that a large @xmath63 leads to sizable inhomogeneities of @xmath0 . on the other hand ,",
    "other inflationary observables can be affected by a particularly large @xmath63 .",
    "we discuss in this section this possibility , showing that the conditions allowing to obtain large inhomogeneities for @xmath0 offer new perspectives for distinguishing single from multiple - source scenarios .",
