    "there is hope that the reconstruction of the neutrino mass matrix will shed light on some of the most relevant open questions faced by high energy physics today , including the origin of the neutrino mass , the flavor - puzzle , and the origin of the asymmetry between matter and antimatter , among others .    in order to start tackling these issues , `` precision measurements '' of the neutrino parameters",
    "are required : simply knowing that the neutrino masses are tiny is not enough .",
    "knowing that there are three non degenerate massive neutrinos is also not enough to prove that there is cp violation in the lepton sector , although it would be rather surprising if it turned out otherwise .",
    "forthcoming neutrino experiments , therefore , have to be designed not simply to test the oscillation hypothesis , but also to perform precise measurements of the oscillation parameters .",
    "we currently know that there are ( at least ) three neutrino `` flavors ''  the electron , the muon and the tau neutrinos  and the current neutrino oscillation data strongly suggest that the flavor eigenstates differ from the mass eigenstates and therefore the neutrinos can mix .",
    "furthermore , the atmospheric , solar and reactor data point to two hierarchically different mass - squared differences plus a small `` connecting angle , '' such that , to good approximation , both the atmospheric and solar neutrino puzzles can be solved by assuming @xmath4-oscillations and @xmath5-oscillations , respectively .",
    "forthcoming results from solar , atmospheric , accelerator , and reactor neutrino oscillation experiments will measure the size of the mass - squared difference and mixing angle that drive the solar neutrino oscillations with good precision and the mass - squared difference and the mixing angle involved in the atmospheric oscillation to about 10% @xcite ( and there should be direct confirmation that muon neutrinos oscillate to tau neutrinos by direct observation of a tau appearance @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , we will also definitively open ( or close ) the door to extra new physics in the neutrino sector by confirming ( or not ) the lsnd anomaly @xcite with miniboone data @xcite .    in addition",
    ", some non - oscillation neutrino experiments are aiming at determining the absolute value of the neutrino masses using direct searches  @xcite and the nature of the neutrino mass : are they majorana or dirac particles ?",
    "the knowledge of the neutrino mass is important to decide whether neutrinos contribute significantly to the total energy of the universe .    in view of the above results and the ongoing experimental programs , the ultimate goal for the next generation of neutrino experiments should be to test cp violation in the neutrino sector , if the parameters of the solar neutrino solution allow such a determination .",
    "one way to achieve this goal is to devise experiments that :    * are sensitive to the sub - dominant @xmath6 channel for the atmospheric @xmath7 , and can measure @xmath8 from both and transitions ; * are capable of determining the neutrino mass pattern from matter effects ; * ultimately , can test cp invariance in the leptonic sector .    such experiments require , in general , relatively intense and mono - energetic beams .",
    "as first suggested in @xcite , this could be achieved with off - axis neutrino beams .",
    "the literature contains a significant amount of work @xcite which discusses the potential of generic `` super - beams , '' with neutrino energies ranging from 1 to 50 gev and baselines spanning from 200 to 7000 kilometers .",
    "low energy neutrino beams have also been studied @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we explore which of the questions above can be addressed by using the numi beam line with a new proton driver and the construction of an off - axis detector .",
    "we will concentrate exclusively on what one may hope to learn by looking for @xmath9 appearance in a highly segmented iron - scintillator detector .",
    "we will conclude , in agreement with some of these previous works , that intense beams can significantly improve our knowledge of the neutrino oscillation parameters , including ( depending on the solar solution ) some sensitivity to a cp violating phase .",
    "however , the ultimate sensitivity to some of the neutrino parameters , in particular the cp violating phase , will require the purity and intensity of neutrino factory beams @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we briefly review the neutrino mixing matrix and oscillation probabilities , and describe the current knowledge of neutrino masses and mixing angles . in sec .  3",
    ", we describe the off - axis neutrino beam , and discuss where an off - axis detector should be located in order to maximize its physics capabilities . in sec .  4 , we describe in detail the detector we will be considering , and discuss reconstruction efficiencies and strategies for reducing the number of background events . in sec .  5",
    ", we discuss the physics capabilities of such a setup , for different values of the solar mass - squared difference .",
    "we find that while some information can be obtained from a `` neutrino '' beam , it is imperative to run with an `` antineutrino '' beam as well .",
    "furthermore , in order to extract more `` exciting '' physics ( such as cp - violation ) out of the experiment , a new intense proton source and a large detector are required . in sec .",
    "6 we summarize our results and compare our findings with similar studies at different beamlines .",
    "the presence of non - zero masses for the light neutrinos introduces a leptonic mixing matrix , @xmath10 , analogous to the well known ckm quark mixing matrix , and which in general is not expected to be diagonal . the matrix @xmath10 connects the neutrino flavor eigenstates with the mass eigenstates :    @xmath11    where @xmath12 denotes the active neutrino flavors , @xmath13 or @xmath14 , while @xmath15 runs over the mass eigenstates .",

    "the current data leave us with two alternatives for the spectrum of the three active neutrino species : a `` normal '' neutrino mass hierarchy or an `` inverted '' neutrino mass hierarchy . in the case of a `` normal '' mass hierarchy , the `` solar pair '' of states is lighter than @xmath46 , @xmath47 . in the case of inverted hierarchy ,",
    "the states of the solar pair are heavier than @xmath46 , @xmath48 .",

    "14.2 cm    what is currently known about the oscillation parameters ?",

    "global fits to all data have historically identified the following well - known regions @xcite :    * lma , large mixing angle : @xmath69  ev@xmath62 , @xmath70 = 0.25 ; * sma , small mixing angle : @xmath71  ev@xmath62 , @xmath72 ; * low - qvo , large mixing angle , small @xmath1 : @xmath73  ev@xmath62 , @xmath70 = 0.1  10 ; * vo , large mixing , vacuum oscillations : @xmath74  ev@xmath62 and @xmath75  ev@xmath62 , @xmath76 .    notice that all the solutions satisfy @xmath77 implying that there is indeed a hierarchy between the two distinct mass - squared differences .",
    "current global fits point towards electron neutrino oscillations to active neutrinos ( either muon or tau neutrinos ) in the lma region ( a small region in the low area is also allowed while the sma and vo regions are strongly disfavored ) .",
    "although the lma solution is the most favored , this ambiguity must be removed by identifying the correct solution to the solar neutrino problem .",
    "this issue will be addressed by the kamland @xcite reactor neutrino experiment , which is capable of confirming or excluding , unambiguously , the lma solution , and precisely measuring the solar oscillation parameter if lma is indeed correct .",
    "however , it is important to remember that if the mass - squared difference driving solar neutrino oscillations lies in the `` high - end '' of the lma region , the length of the baseline will be too long and the oscillation peaks will not be resolved experimentally @xcite .",
    "the positron spectrum will be depleted ( proportionally to the solar mixing angle ) but will not be distorted as the oscillatory term will average out . in this case , the mass difference will be confined to a region whose lower limit is given by the kamland sensitivity and whose upper limit is dictated by the chooz bound .",
    "thus , as this mass - squared difference is an essential input in analyzing long baseline experiments , the capabilities of any future determination should take this possibility into account . furthermore , a solar mass difference belonging to the upper part of the lma region will have a strong impact on the oscillation probabilities , as the often neglected sub - dominant oscillations become not that sub - dominant any more .    in order to determine the sensitivity of a given experiment to some parameter ,",
    "it is imperative to distinguish different scenarios regarding the solar mass difference .",
    "we decide to study three different scenarios :    1 .",
    "kamland does not see an oscillation signal , implying that the low solution would be correct @xcite ( or , perhaps one of the disfavored non lma solutions ) .",
    "in this case , solar driven oscillations become negligible and there is no room for measuring cp violation in the neutrino sector .",
    "nonetheless , one can still attempt to determine @xmath2 , and , if a nonzero @xmath2 is observed , determine the neutrino mass hierarchy .",
    "2 .   kamland does provide a precise measurement of the solar mass - squared difference .",
    "the determination of the cp violating phase and @xmath2 from a simultaneous fit to both parameters becomes possible .",
    "kamland sees an overall suppression of the total rate but is not capable of measuring the mass - squared difference . in this case",

    "the neutrinos at the main injector  ( numi )  @xcite tertiary beamline was designed to provide an intense @xmath78 beam to the minos experiment @xcite .",

    "the beam is tuned to make the experiment well aligned with respect to the beam axis .",
    "another way of efficiently using this beamline would be to construct detectors located _ away _ from the beam axis .",
    "the resulting neutrino beam energy spectra at the different locations can be predicted from energy and momentum conservation in the @xmath84 decay process : @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are the rest masses , @xmath89 and @xmath90 are the pion energy and momentum , and @xmath91 is the angle at which the neutrino is emitted with respect to the pion direction .",
    "the maximum angle in the lab frame relative to the pion direction is related to the neutrino energy by : @xmath92 where 30  mev is the neutrino momentum in the rest frame of the pion , while @xmath93 takes into account the nonzero transverse momentum of the decaying @xmath84 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ off_theory](a ) , if @xmath94 the neutrino energy is proportional to the pion energy ( @xmath95 ) , while at an off - axis location ( @xmath96 ) there is a maximum neutrino energy which is independent of the energy of the parent pion .",

''",
    "therefore , it seems logical to start running with the `` neutrino beam '' and decide whether one can observe an excess of @xmath37-like events in the off - axis detector .",

    "the definition of one kton - year is the following : it is the amount of events observed after one year of running of the current numi beam ( see fig .  [ beam_comp ] ) in a one kton detector at 900  km , 11.5  km off - axis .",
    "many features are readily noticeable .",
    "first , in order to be sensitive to values of @xmath2 which are significantly smaller than the current chooz bound ( @xmath117 @xcite ) , one is required to accumulate more than 40  kton - years of data , in the case of a normal hierarchy , or more than 150  kton - years in the case of an inverted hierarchy .",
    "this means , assuming the nominal numi beam , roughly two or eight years of running with a 20  kton detector .",
    "note that the @xmath118 uncertainty on the background determination dictates that , even after accumulating an infinite amount of statistics , the three sigma reach of the off axis experiment plateaus at around @xmath119 ( @xmath120 ) for a normal ( inverted ) hierarchy . as is clear from fig .",
    "[ kton - year ] , in the case of an inverted hierarchy , the sensitivity is significantly worse .",

    "this implies that , for @xmath64 , the wrong hypothesis yields @xmath141 , which is excluded at more than four sigma .",
    "a three sigma confidence level determination of the neutrino mass hierarchy would be obtained at @xmath142 .    in summary , if the lma solution is excluded by kamland @xcite ( or , perhaps , a solar neutrino experiment , like borexino @xcite ) , future long baseline neutrino experiments can only hope to measure the magnitude of the @xmath49 element of the neutrino mixing matrix , and determine the neutrino mass hierarchy . on the other hand , both the estimated sensitivity reach and the measurement of @xmath2",

    "[ measure_lma](top , right ) depicts the one , two , and three sigma measurement contours in the ( @xmath152)-plane obtained after 300  kton - years running with the antineutrino beam ( as mentioned before , the longer running time is required in order to compensate for the `` less efficient '' antineutrino beam ) .",
    "again , @xmath2 can be measured with some precision and nothing can be said about @xmath3 .",
    "a comparison of the two figures hints that a combined analyses may prove more fruitful .",
    "this is the case because while the neutrino beam yields a `` z - shaped '' measurement contour , the antineutrino beam yields an `` s - shaped '' contour .",
    "the reason for this is that the number of @xmath9 induced events is larger for @xmath151 and smaller for @xmath153 .",
    "therefore , the measurement will choose larger values of @xmath2 at around @xmath153 in order to compensate for this small suppression . on the other hand ,",
    "the number of @xmath104 induced events is smaller at @xmath151 and larger at @xmath153 , and the opposite phenomenon is observed .",
    "[ measure_lma](bottom , left ) depicts the result of measuring @xmath2 and @xmath3 using the combined neutrino and antineutrino beam `` data . '' the situation is significantly improved , and now , a three sigma measurement of @xmath154 can be performed .",
    "[ measure_lma](bottom , right ) is similar to fig .",
    "[ measure_lma](bottom , left ) , except that different input values of @xmath155 are chosen . as expected , the quality of the measurement is marginally worse for @xmath153 ( where @xmath3 is consistent with zero at the three sigma level ) , and deteriorates as @xmath2 decreases . for @xmath151 , one can not determine that @xmath154 or @xmath84 ( _ i.e. , _ no cp - violation ) at the two sigma level if @xmath156 .",
    "it should always be kept in mind that the situation deteriorates for smaller values of @xmath51 .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that an alternative ( perhaps more standard ) way to look at cp violation would be to construct an `` asymmetry - like '' parameter ( _ e.g. _ , something proportional to @xmath157 ) .",
    "this approach will not yield a better measurement of the oscillation parameters @xmath3 and @xmath2 ( as we are using all the experimental data and perform a `` global fit '' ) .",
    "furthermore , it is not even an appropriate `` direct detection '' of cp - violation , given that our neutrino and antineutrino beams are not pure ( especially the antineutrino beam ) _ and _ matter effects contribute a significant amount of `` fake '' cp - violation .    in summary ,",
    "if kamland observes a suppressed and distorted reactor antineutrino spectrum , long baseline neutrino experiments can potentially measure both the magnitude of the @xmath49 element of the neutrino mixing matrix and the cp - odd dirac phase . note that attempting to measure the cp - odd phase is not `` optional ''",
    " the fact that it is unknown introduces a substantial uncertainty on determining @xmath2 . in order to disentangle the two unknown parameters ,",
    "it is crucial to take data using both a neutrino and an antineutrino beam .",
    "if @xmath158  ev@xmath62 ( note that this possibility is not currently excluded by solar neutrino data @xcite ) , kamland will not be sensitive to the very rapid oscillatory pattern , and will only be able to observe an overall suppression of the solar neutrino flux @xcite . in this case",
    ", the mixing angle @xmath143 can be measured with some precision by determining the overall suppression factor , but the value of @xmath51 will only be constrained to be larger than some lower limit .",
    "an upper limit will be provided by either future solar data or by the current chooz data @xcite . in order to be conservative",
    ", we will consider the latter case , and assume that @xmath159  ev@xmath62 for large solar angles .",
    "if this scenario turns out to be correct , precise measurements of the atmospheric parameters and the solar mixing angle will probably be available , while @xmath2 , @xmath3 and the precise value of @xmath51 will remain unknown .",
    "what are the consequences of having a very large but poorly measured @xmath51 ?",
    "the biggest consequence , perhaps , is that even for very small values of @xmath2 , a significant amount of @xmath37-like events will be observed .",
    "this implies that the `` sensitivity to @xmath2 , '' as discussed in the two previous sections is not a particularly meaningful quantity to study .",
    "furthermore , as one may fear , this will also lead to a @xmath51 versus @xmath2 `` confusion , '' ( this was already alluded to in @xcite ) similar to the one observed between @xmath2 and @xmath3 in the previous section ( and which continues to exist here , of course ) .",
    "in other words , a moderate @xmath51 and a large @xmath2 will yield as many events as a large @xmath51 and a small @xmath2 .",
    "we already learned from the previous two sections that one will be required to run both the neutrino and the antineutrino beams ( and accumulate enough statistics with both ) in order to try to disentangle the three parameters .",
    "one should keep in mind that , while the situation is rather confusing , the number of observed events is going to be large for very large values of the solar mass - squared difference .    in order to address what kind of measurement one may be able to perform under these conditions , we simulate data for @xmath151 , @xmath160 , @xmath161  ev@xmath62 , @xmath162  ev , @xmath114 , and @xmath116 , assuming 120  kton - years of neutrino beam running and 300  kton - years of antineutrino beam running . as before , we assume during the data analysis that the atmospheric parameters , the neutrino mass hierarchy and the solar angle are known with infinite precision .",
    "the results of the three parameter fit are presented in fig .",
    "[ measure_hlma ] , where we plot the three two - dimensional projections of the three sigma surface in the ( @xmath163)-space .",
    "many comments are in order .",
    "first of all , one should note that the solar mass difference can not be measured with any reasonable precision ",
    "it is only slightly better known than before , namely , it lies somewhere between @xmath164  ev@xmath62 ( the kamland bound ) and @xmath165  ev@xmath62 ( slightly better than the chooz bound ) .",
    "the top left - hand panel depicts the @xmath166 versus @xmath2 confusion alluded to earlier quite well .",
    "it is curious to note however , that the capability to decide whether @xmath2 is nonzero or not is not weak  the loose constraints on @xmath51 are already enough to guarantee that @xmath167 .",
    "most importantly , perhaps , at the three sigma level there is solid evidence that @xmath168 .",
    "the reason for this is that , for @xmath161 and @xmath151 , @xmath169 transitions are very suppressed , and a zero cp - odd phase would yield far too many @xmath135-like events when the antineutrino beam is on .    in summary , for very large values of @xmath51",
    ", kamland will not be able to measure the solar mass - squared difference with reasonable precision . under these circumstances",
    ", long - baseline neutrino experiments are required to measure @xmath51 along with @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "we find that , if @xmath2 is large enough , there is a reasonable chance that cp violation can be observed , while @xmath2 can be measured rather poorly .",
    "the measurement of @xmath51 is even less precise .",
    "as before , accumulating enough statistics with both the neutrino and antineutrino beams is required , and , particularly on this case , one would profit immensely from other measurements with different distances and/or baselines ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the ultimate goal for the next generation of neutrino experiments will be to tie some of the `` loose ends '' of neutrino masses and mixings ,   determine the neutrino mass hierarchy , measure ( or further constraint ) the `` connecting mixing angle '' ( @xmath2 ) , and explore leptonic cp violation ( if the solution to the solar neutrino puzzle lies in the lma region ) .",
    "candidate next generation experiments include shooting an intense conventional muon - type neutrino beam towards a detector which is located conveniently away from the main beam direction .",
    "`` off - axis beams '' have several advantages with respect to their on - axis counterparts .",
    "they are more intense , narrower and lower energy beams , `` void '' of a large high energy tail , and provide clean access to @xmath37-appearance , given the existence of a suitable detector with good electron identification capabilities . in order to fully take advantage of such tools , however , we have argued that two different beams ( a predominantly @xmath78 and a predominantly @xmath127 beam ) are essential . `` antineutrino beams , '' however , provide an extra experimental challenge : the antineutrino cross sections are suppressed with respect to the neutrino ones , such that , in order to obtain a statistically comparable antineutrino and neutrino data set , a sizeable amount of running time is required .",
    "the solution we find to this issue is a more intense proton source , along with a large ( but realistically sized ) detector .",
    "specifically , we studied how well experiments in the numi beamline with a proton driver upgrade plus an off - axis detector can address these issues . in order to properly estimate the experimental response ( _ e.g. ,",
    "_ signal efficiency as well as beam and detector - induced backgrounds ) , we performed a realistic simulation of the numi beam plus the response of a highly segmented iron detector , followed by a detailed `` data '' analysis .",
    "the combination of a new proton driver and the off - axis detector using the numi beamline can , in five years , improve considerably our knowledge of the neutrino sector .    to properly assess the capabilities of such a set up ,",
    "it is crucial to explore all the different physics scenarios , which will be ( hopefully ) distinguished by the current kamland reactor experiment . for different values of the solar mass - squared difference , we obtain different results for a five year program with an upgraded numi beam and a 900  km long baseline off - axis experiment :    1 .",
    "kamland does not observe a suppression of the reactor neutrino flux ",
    "@xmath2 can be measured with very good precision and the neutrino mass pattern can be established , as long as @xmath170 .",
    "we emphasize that even in this `` less fortunate scenario '' key information regarding neutrino physics will be obtained .",
    "2 .   kamland sees a distortion of the reactor neutrino spectrum ",
    "one should be capable of measuring @xmath2 with good precision and obtaining a rather strong hint for cp violation , as long as @xmath170 , @xmath3 close to either @xmath171 or @xmath172 . as a simplifying assumption",
    ", we assumed that the neutrino mass hierarchy would be already determined by other means .",
    "kamland sees an oscillation signal but is not able to measure @xmath1 ",
    "one should be capable of measuring @xmath2 with some precision and obtaining a strong hint for cp violation as long as @xmath173 , @xmath3 close to either @xmath171 or @xmath172 , even if @xmath1 is poorly known .",
    "@xmath1 can not be measured with any reasonable precision . again , as a simplifying assumption , we assumed that the neutrino mass hierarchy would be already determined by other means .",
    "it is also important to stress that , as discussed here in some detail , order 2  gev neutrinos and a 900  km baseline are appropriate to measure fake as well as genuine cp violation ( _ i.e. , _ both the neutrino mass hierarchy and the dirac phase @xmath3 of the neutrino mixing matrix ) .",
    "furthermore , we have argued that similar results should be obtained for different baselines ( as long as the off - axis distance is appropriately modified ) and for different values of the atmospheric mass - squared difference ( see fig .  [ fom ] ) .",
    "in particular , the latter implies that one need not wait until a very precise measurement of @xmath174 is made in order to decide where the off - axis detector is to be located .",
    "we conclude by comparing some of the results obtained here with similar studies performed for a future jhf to kamioka neutrino beam @xcite .",
    "a neutrino beam from the jhf - proton source  @xcite aimed at the super - kamiokande detector  @xcite is a neutrino project with a 295  km baseline aimed to start in 2007 - 2008 .",
    "similar to the numi - off - axis project , the physics goals are to measure with an order of magnitude better precision ( compared to minos and cngs estimates @xcite ) the atmospheric parameters ( @xmath175  ev@xmath62 and @xmath176 ) , confirm @xmath177-oscillations or discover sterile neutrinos by measuring the neutral current event rate , and to improve by a factor of 20 the sensitivity to @xmath178-appearance .",
    "after a five year program , the jhf - kamioka program should be able to exclude , at the 90% confidence level , @xmath178 transitions for @xmath179 , while at numi with a 20  kton off - axis detector we will exclude , at the two sigma confidence level , @xmath180 with  ( without ) an upgrade proton driver ( assuming @xmath181  ev@xmath62 and a normal neutrino mass hierarchy ) . the main difference between the two programs should come from the longer baseline proposed here , which allows the numi off - axis experiment ( but not the jhf - kamioka program ) to cleanly try to address the neutrino mass hierarchy .",
