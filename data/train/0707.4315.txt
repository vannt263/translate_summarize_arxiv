    "the definition is consistent with the pure state scenario , in which the state is entangled if and only if the vector representing it @xmath10 is not a tensor product of vectors describing the subsystems @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "schrdinger @xcite pointed out that the essence of pure entangled state is of the informational kind , i.e. , the total information about the system exceeds the information about its subsystems .",
    "in fact , the total information is maximal ( since the state is pure ) while the local ones are not ( since the subsystems are mixed ) . for mixed states the above schrdinger intuition",
    "was first formalized in terms of the von neumann entropy @xmath14 .",
    "namely , it was observed in ref .",
    "@xcite that any separable state has to obey the converse rule , i.e. , it must have the entropy of the total system greater than entropies of the subsystems @xmath15 where @xmath16 .",
    "thus any violation of the above conditions _ implies _ entanglement ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for an analysis of special examples ) .",
    "recently this fact was shown to play a central role in the quantum version of slepian - wolf theorem @xcite , which solves the long - standing open problem ( analyzed first for pure states in ref .",

    "@xcite .",
    "apart form the scalar criteria discussed above , the so called structural criteria were introduced @xcite and investigated ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) . here",
    "we shall especially need the separability conditions based on positive but not completely positive maps @xcite ( denoted hereafter by @xmath38 ) with the positive partial transposition ( ppt ) criterion @xcite as the most famous example .",
    "positive maps , characterizing separability themselves , allow also for introduction of a dual picture , i.e. , the description in terms of the so - called _ entanglement witnesses _ @xcite . let us recall , that a hermitian operator @xmath39 is called an entanglement witness if its mean value on all separable states is nonnegative and negative for at least one entangled state .",
    "entanglement witnesses lead to a popular method of experimental entanglement detection nowadays ( see ref .",
    "however , some other indirect applications of the positive map criterion were also proposed . in particular , the possible measurement of certain functionals of @xmath40 and @xmath41(\\varrho)$ ] was discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite . here and further by @xmath42",
    "we shall be denoting an identity map .",
    "one of the criteria , based on positive maps and important from the communication point of view is the so - called reduction criterion @xcite .",
    "it arises from the reduction map , which acts on a @xmath43 matrix @xmath44 as @xmath45 .",
    "the criterion states that any separable state @xmath40 acting on @xmath46 , should retain a nonnegative spectrum after the action of the map @xmath47 , leading to the following operator inequality : @xmath48 in ref .",
    "@xcite the above criterion was shown to imply the first entropic inequality ( [ vnentropy ] ) . later in ref .",
    "@xcite the implication was extended to all entropic inequalities . in this way",

    "@xcite ) .    in analogy",
    "@xcite it is natural to ask a general question .",
    "_ is it possible to derive entropic - like inequalities from other positive maps than the reduction one ? _",
    "recently , a new positive map , whose structure is similar to the reduction map , has been introduced in refs .",
    "the map leads to the following operator inequality @xmath49 and unlike the reduction map , was shown to be indecomposable .",
    "as such it can detect ppt entangled states @xcite . here @xmath50 stands for partial transposition with respect to subsystem @xmath51 composed with a local antisymmetric operation @xmath52 such that @xmath53 on the second subsystem . of course , one may write a similar operator inequality for the subsystem @xmath44 . using this map we give a partially positive answer to the posed question . for a large class of states satisfying additional assumptions ( including , in particular , the states that are isomorphic to quantum channels )",
    "we derive a series of entropic - like inequalities which detect entanglement better than their entropic counterparts .",
    "we derive also the operator version of the inequalities .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the detailed construction of the inequalities is given in sec .",
    "[ sec1 ] . at the beginning",
    "we discuss the case of two - particle states consisting of a qubit and qudit ( qubit - qudit states ) to introduce the method and discuss some special cases and examples",
    ". then we present the inequalities for higher - dimensional systems and give some illustrative examples .",
    "in particular , we compare the derived inequalities with the entropic inequalities and entanglement witness arising from the breuer criterion @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ witness ] we present the corresponding multicopy entanglement witness . in sec .",
    "[ iv ] we discuss in more details a special inequality which , similarly to the entropic one for @xmath37 , can be measured as a collective entanglement witness on two copies of a state . finally , using the fact that bipartite systems of even dimensions can be simulated by multiqubit states we show in secs .",
    "[ iv.b ] and [ iv.c ] how to check the inequality experimentally within coalescence - anticoalescence experimental setups known already from the literature @xcite .",
    "the construction of entropic - like inequalities is based on the recently introduced positive but not completely positive indecomposable map @xcite , which acts on a @xmath54 matrix @xmath44 ( here @xmath55 is an even number ) as follows : @xmath56 the symbol @xmath57 denotes the time reversal of @xmath44 , namely @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is an antisymmetric anti - diagonal unitary matrix with anti - diagonal elements @xmath60 , @xmath61 is a @xmath54 identity matrix , and superscript @xmath62 denotes the matrix transposition in the standard basis .",
    "this map belongs to the class of indecomposable positive maps @xmath63 introduced by hall @xcite , where instead of the particular @xmath59 , an arbitrary antisymmetric @xmath64 matrix @xmath52 such that @xmath65 is taken .",
    "the map can be written in the following form @xmath66 note that for even @xmath55 one may take @xmath52 to be unitary since only in this case antisymmetric unitaries exist @xcite .",
    "in further considerations we will concentrate on the special case considered by breuer @xcite , however , throughout the paper we will state the facts for general map",
    "@xmath63 whenever possible",
    ".    let us also introduce a positive map similar to the breuer - hall map that will become useful in further considerations .",
    "the only difference a is a change of the sign before the modified transposition map , i.e. , @xmath67 where a is again a @xmath54 matrix .",
    "the proof of positivity goes along the same lines as the proof for breuer - hall criterion given in refs .",
    "@xcite . notice that @xmath68 $ ] and @xmath69 $ ] .    before we state the main results let us introduce the following notations : @xmath70 @xmath71 , and , respectively , @xmath72 .",
    "as previously stated , in particular case when @xmath73 , the notation @xmath74 shall be used .",
    "finally , we shall denote the standard partial transposition with respect to the subsystem @xmath75 by superscript @xmath76 , i.e. , @xmath77(x)=x^{t_{b}}$ ] and @xmath78(x)=x^{t_{a}}$ ] .      as an introductory example we present the entropic - type inequalities for the qubit - qudit states .",
    "it should be emphasized that the breuer map @xmath79 can not be used as a separability criterion in the case of the qubit - qudit states ( when the map acts on the smaller subsystem ) , since it gives zero on arbitrary projector acting on @xmath80 .",
    "( hall map @xmath63 is equivalent to breuer map in this case , since each unitary antisymmetric matrix @xmath52 acting on the two dimensional subsystem can be written as @xmath81 , which does not change the map ) .",
    "however , it does not mean that it is not useful in detecting entanglement at all . as we will see below",
    "it is a good starting point for derivation of some inequalities .",
    "let us first recall the hilbert - schmidt form of any qubit - qudit state .",
    "if we denote by @xmath40 the density operator acting on the hilbert space @xmath82 and @xmath83 the generators of @xmath84 with @xmath85 , then the density matrix @xmath40 might be written in the product basis @xmath86 as @xmath87 on the first subsystem the basis is chosen to be pauli matrices defined as @xmath88 with @xmath89 .",
    "coefficients @xmath90 are given by @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and thus real .",
    "the convention is such that @xmath95 , for @xmath96 .    in the hilbert - schmidt formalism one",
    "may easily recognize how the map @xmath97 acts on @xmath40 .",
    "when acting on the two - dimensional subsystem the unitary matrix @xmath59 is just @xmath98 .",
    "thus , for arbitrary @xmath99 we have the following relation : @xmath100 which , in turn , implies that @xmath101 has the following hilbert - schmidt representation : @xmath102 comparison of eqs .",
    "( [ hs ] ) and ( [ hstaua ] ) leads immediately to the fact that @xmath103 .",
    "thus the beuer map ( [ bmap ] ) indeed gives zero when acting on the two - dimensional subsystem . on the other hand",
    ", one recognizes in this equality the equivalence between transposition and reduction maps when both act on a @xmath104 matrix @xcite , i.e. , @xmath105 .",
    "following ref . @xcite and using the above relations we may write the following equalities for @xmath106 : @xmath107 equation ( [ i.6 ] ) , though seemingly not to be useful for detecting entanglement , may be used to derive some inequalities which are stronger than the entropic ones .",
    "before we make the general considerations for a natural @xmath108 let us investigate the cases of @xmath109 ( for @xmath37 the procedure presented beneath still holds , however , it leads to the standard entropic inequality ) , since for these values of @xmath18 we do not need to make any assumptions .",
    "we are going to show that omitting certain terms on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ i.6 ] ) one obtains inequalities stronger than the respective entropic inequality . for this purpose",
    "let us assume that @xmath40 is separable , i.e. , of the form ( [ separable ] ) .",
    "then the matrix @xmath110 is obviously positive since @xmath111 for @xmath112 .",
    "moreover , let us recall the fact that even though the product of two positive matrices @xmath113 and @xmath114 need not be a positive matrix , the trace of the product is always nonnegative , i.e. , @xmath115 @xcite .",
    "in further considerations we also apply the fact that , in general , terms such as @xmath116\\ ] ] with @xmath117 and odd @xmath118 are negative for some entangled states .",
    "the negativity of terms such as eq .",
    "( [ terms ] ) may be easily seen in case of a @xmath55-dimensional maximally entangled state @xmath119 first , one sees that @xmath120 and @xmath121 , where @xmath122 is the known swap operator defined as @xmath123 with @xmath124 .",
    "secondly , the hermiticity and unitarity of @xmath122 allow us to write that @xmath125 whenever @xmath126 is even , and @xmath127 for odd @xmath126 .",
    "therefore the expression ( [ terms ] ) reduces to @xmath128 where @xmath129 is an odd number .",
    "moreover , @xmath130 , which makes the expression in eq .",
    "( [ terms2 ] ) negative .",
    "now let us consider the special cases of eq .",
    "( [ i.6 ] ) . for @xmath131",
    "we obtain @xmath132 since for any natural @xmath133 and separable state @xmath40 the matrices @xmath101 and @xmath134 are positive , one concludes that @xmath135 .",
    "thus , under the assumption that @xmath40 is separable one may omit the term @xmath136 , obtaining the following inequality : @xmath137 since @xmath138 even for entangled states , one could see that this inequality is more powerful than its entropic counterpart @xmath139 .    in an analogous way one may derive an inequality for @xmath140 . from eq .",
    "( [ i.6 ] ) one has @xmath141 the term @xmath142 is always positive since @xmath143 . now , omitting the terms with odd number of @xmath101 in the product , which may be negative for some entangled states , one obtains @xmath144 again , this inequality must be stronger than its entropic counterpart since all terms in the above are positive .    finally , for @xmath145 from eq .",
    "( [ i.6 ] ) we obtain @xmath146 for separable @xmath40 terms in which @xmath101 occurs in odd powers may be omitted since they are positive .",
    "the terms @xmath147 and @xmath148 are positive for separable states .",
    "moreover , we have @xmath149 now , omitting the mentioned terms , we have @xmath150 since @xmath151 all the terms appearing in the inequality ( [ nier5 ] ) are positive even for entangled states and thus again the inequality ( [ nier5 ] ) is stronger than the respective entropic one .    it should be clarified that our aim is to leave on the right - hand side of the derived inequalities only the terms that remain positive , even if partial time reversal of a state is not a positive matrix .",
    "then the possibility of violation of the respective inequalities by entangled states is stronger . in general",
    "( i.e. , for natural @xmath152 ) it is not clear which terms of the form ( [ terms ] ) are positive when @xmath153 is positive and which could become negative for npt states .",
    "therefore , in general , we do not know which terms can be removed on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ i.6 ] ) to obtain the strong inequalities for higher @xmath18 . hence to derive the inequalities for arbitrary @xmath154 we make an additional assumption that @xmath155=0 $ ] , which by virtue of the fact that @xmath156^{\\tau_{a}}=[\\mathbbm{1}_{2}{\\otimes}\\varrho_{b},\\varrho^{\\tau_{a}}]$ ] , is equivalent to the condition @xmath156=0 $ ] .",
    "now we state the general criterion for states acting on @xmath82 as the following fact .",
    "_ fact 1.- _ let @xmath40 represent a separable state defined on @xmath157 commuting with @xmath158 .",
    "then for @xmath159 the following inequality holds @xmath160 the proof of the fact is rather straightforward and follows from the commutativity of @xmath40 and @xmath101 and the known newton binomial formula .    for the sake of simplicity the above",
    "may be rewritten as @xmath161.\\ ] ] on the other hand , to show that this inequality is stronger than the entropic one , it may also be rewritten as follows : @xmath162 since the second term in the above is always positive ( even for entangled @xmath40 ) , all the inequalities for arbitrary natural @xmath163 are stronger than their entropic counterparts ( note , that for @xmath37 the above inequality becomes the standard entropic inequality ) .",
    "_ remark 1.1 .",
    "_ one should note that if @xmath164 is non - degenerate and @xmath165 commutes with the state @xmath40 , then immediately @xmath40 must be separable .",
    "this follows form the fact that then the latter has to have all its eigenvectors of the separable form @xmath166 where @xmath167 is an eigenvector of @xmath164 and @xmath168 is some vector from the hilbert space describing the second subsystem .",
    "_ remark 1.2 .",
    "_ one could easily see that in case @xmath169 , i.e. , two - qubit states its is possible to derive a dual inequality of eq .",

    "below we will show how the scalar inequalities considered in the present paper can be reformulated in terms of a single collective witness .",

    "first , let us denote by @xmath370 the @xmath133-copy swap operator @xmath371 which is a straightforward multipartite generalization of @xmath122 introduced in sec .",

    "the equivalence between these two formulas exist only if both traces are real .",
    "one can see that @xmath370 is not a hermitian operator and as such it can not be treated as an observable .",
    "however , instead of @xmath370 one may consider its hermitian counterpart @xmath374 of which the mean value on @xmath133 copies of the state @xmath40 gives exactly @xmath375 . now , to take into account the maps in the formula ( [ scalar - inequality ] ) , we use approach exploited already in case of positive maps method @xcite and define the following collective witness : @xmath376 which is hermitian by the construction . here by @xmath377 we denote a dual map of @xmath378 , i.e. , the map obeying @xmath379={\\mathrm{tr}[}\\theta^{\\dagger}(x)y]$ ] for all matrices @xmath217 and @xmath380 .",

    "we have explicitly put the dependence of the observable on that set of indices .    after a little bit of algebra we get that our quantity ( [ ineq1 ] ) is reproduced as collective mean value of the observable @xmath425 note that this quantity is closely related to entropic inequalities on multipartite qubits considered in ref .",
    "@xcite ( which are natural generalizations of original entropic inequalities @xcite ) as well as to multipartite concurrences @xcite or other state functions based on nonlinear operations @xcite .",

    "consider the generalization of the scheme @xcite in a spirit of ref .",
    "@xcite . in this case on each pair of qubits @xmath427 @xmath428 one performs the measurement projecting onto one of two projectors , i.e. , symmetric or antisymmetric one @xmath429 . for simplicity",
    "we shall denote the symmetric and antysymmetric projector by slightly different notations @xmath430 and @xmath431 , respectively ( note that the index is even or odd when the symmetry is even or odd ) .",

    "let us also introduce the function @xmath437 .",
    "then the mean value of the observable ( [ observable ] ) is @xmath438\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times p(s_{1},\\ldots , s_{n}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the above complicated - looking formula has a very elementary interpretation .",
    "in fact we are summing only over such @xmath439 that have index @xmath440 and only they contribute to the  phase  in the sum . all the indices",
    "@xmath439 with @xmath441 are put to be one all the time .",
    "this can be easily seen in the following examples .",
    "_ example 1 .",
    "_ consider three qubits @xmath442 with the last one reflected @xmath443 .",
    "then the last index in the probability is fixed to be one while the others are counted .",
    "this gives @xmath444 now we introduce further examples that will have important interpretation in the context of bipartite systems .",
    "_ example 2 .",
    "_ consider again three qubits @xmath442 with last two reflected @xmath445 .",
    "this gives the very easy formula @xmath446 _ example 3 .",
    "_ here we shall focus on four qubits @xmath447 and reflect the last two @xmath448 .",
    "the corresponding formula is @xmath449      higher - dimensional bipartite systems , i.e. , @xmath450 with @xmath451 behave in general much different than low - dimensional ones ( @xmath452 ) . in sec .",
    "[ iv.a ] we have seen this from comparison of two scalar inequalities . in the last section we have considered abstract problem of detection of some quantity for multiqubit systems . to see how it can work for bipartite one",
    "let us suppose that we are interested in experimental demonstration of the inequality ( [ ineq1 ] ) for higher dimensional bipartite system @xmath453 . with three - qubit state ,",
    "say , in polarization generated with a single source we can simulate @xmath454 system interpreting the first qubit as a subsystem @xmath44 and the second two as a joint subsystem @xmath51 .",
    "then the example 2 above gives immediately an experimental realization of the inequality ( [ ineq1 ] ) .",
    "the particular importance of the inequality is that it involves only two probabilities and as such should be experimentally more feasible than the other ones .",
    "another important example is the one corresponding to @xmath455 system .",
    "this is because reflection map plays an important role in the indecomposable breuer map .",
    "any four qubit state can be interpreted in this way and then the formula ( [ 44 ] ) serves as an experimental simulation of the bipartite test ( [ ineq1 ] ) .    finally note that for two qubits the left - hand side of the analyzed inequality is @xmath456 which is just the difference of anticoalescence and coalescence terms in experiment @xcite .",
    "in other words the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ ineq1 ] ) can be easily calculated basing on experimental results of ref .",
    "it amounts to @xmath457 which clearly violates the inequality . in this case",
    "we have a kind of ( undirect ) experimental illustration of the presented approach",
    ". it must be stressed , though , that in this case ( as in all @xmath458 cases with reflection performed on the smaller system , which includes example 1 in sec .",
    "[ iv.b ] ) the analyzed inequality is fully equivalent to entropic inequality ( [ entropic0 ] ) taken with @xmath37 .",
    "this is not , however , the case for examples 2 and 3 ( see sec . [ iv.b ] ) .",
    "the so called entropic inequalities are one of the best known scalar separability criteria . however , being a direct consequence of the reduction map , they are not useful in detecting bound entanglement .    in the present paper",
    "we go beyond the reduction map and derive much stronger entropic - like inequalities from the recently introduced extended reduction criterion @xcite .",
    "the commutativity conditions make the inequalities applicable to a particular , however large , class of states including the states isomorphic to quantum channels .",
    "the comparison to known criteria , i.e. , ghne - lewenstein inequalities @xcite for two - qubit states , entropic inequalities @xcite , and breuer witness @xcite for @xmath459 rotationally invariant bipartite states shows the effectiveness of the new inequalities in detection of both distillable and bound entanglement .",
    "it should be emphasized that due to the assumption about positive partial transposition used in derivation of the inequalities they detect some npt entanglement in regions where the breuer witness fails .",
    "this is especially apparent if one takes the limit @xmath269 from the inequalities ( [ symmetric ] ) and ( [ iloczyn ] ) . in case of the discussed @xmath0-invariant states the obtained separability criteria ( [ module ] ) and ( [ symmetric ] )",
    "not only detect bound entangled states equivalently to breuer witness but also almost the whole region of npt states .",
    "however , if one wants to detect ppt entanglement effectively ( i.e. , using fewer copies of a state ) it is better to apply the inequality ( [ 1tr ] ) .    by virtue of the recent results the derived inequalities provide a simple way to construct a many - copy ( collective ) entanglement witnesses .",
    "as discussed the inequalities may also be strengthen due to the fact that for separable states @xmath460 .",
    "therefore when deriving inequalities one may consider @xmath461 instead of @xmath462 .",
    "however , these approach is , to our knowledge , not useful in experimental realizations .    on the other hand the proposed collective entanglement witnesses seem to be experimentally feasible at least for low values of parameter @xmath18 which corresponds to number of copies of a state measured at a time .",
    "it is interesting that as a by - product of the above analysis we have come across a simple inequality which can be naturally implemented using the known experimental schemes on photon polarizations .",
    "in particular the results of the experiment on the usual two - entropy @xcite can be easily reinterpreted in terms of this inequality .    though the effectiveness of the inequalities presented in the paper , to our knowledge , one may derive them only in special cases , namely , assuming some commutation relations .",
    "therefore the presented results leave much place for further investigation .",
    "then it seems interesting to investigate the dependence of efficiency of detecting entanglement or bound entanglement on the matrix @xmath52 used in construction of the map @xmath463 . it would be also desirable to derive an inequality similar to eq .",
    "( [ iloczyn ] ) without the assumption of commutation of @xmath40 and @xmath462 , and stronger than eq .",
    "( [ general ] ) . finally , it seems interesting to pose the general question , which states satisfy the assumed commutation relations and what can we say about entanglement of a given density matrix @xmath40 knowing that it obeys them .",
