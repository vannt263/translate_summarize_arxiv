    "there is relative agreement , however a slight offset ( @xmath6 + 0.16 mag ) exists between the @xmath23 colors of the 1999 october uh 2.2 m observations and the 1993 june kpno observations .",
    "this offset originates from extended red transmission from the uh 2.2 m @xmath29 filter , which is documented by courtois et al .",
    "given the presence of this red leak in the uh 2.2 m @xmath29 filter , the optical photometry presented here is taken primarily from the 1993 kpno observations , unless photometry for a given source were not available . in these circumstances , the photometry from the 1999 uh 2.2 m observations were substituted with a @xmath30 mag correction being applied to the @xmath23 color .",
    "differences in the @xmath27-@xmath29 colors of the 1993 kpno and the 1999 keck lris data evident in figure 5 likely arise from the missing color term in the photometric calibration of the latter data set .",

    "merging the activity - selected sample of 94 sources with 31 infrared selected pre - main sequence candidates from stelzer & scholz ( 2009 ) not detected with x - ray or h@xmath3 emission , and eight infrared excess sources from the spectroscopically classified sample of stars lacking x - ray or h@xmath3 emission , the cluster population of ngc7129 has been increased from @xmath690 members to more than 130 .",
    "high dispersion optical spectroscopy of bd+65@xmath21638 and bd+65@xmath21637 obtained with hires on keck i are presented which clearly demonstrate that bd+65@xmath21637 is the more active of the two , a probable classical be star .",
    "the spectrum of bd+65@xmath21638 is devoid of emission , suggesting the star to be remarkably quiescent if indeed a photodissociating star , just emerging from its primordial envelope of molecular gas .",
    "hires spectroscopy of lkh@xmath3 234 is suggestive of active accretion with numerous metallic and forbidden transitions in emission as well as h@xmath3 and h@xmath34 .",
    "hires spectra obtained in 1999 and 2004 show significantly different h@xmath3 emission profiles including the presence of a deep absorption feature in the p cygni - like structure in the earlier spectrum .",
    "the high dispersion spectrum of svs 13 reveals weak emission reversal in the core of h@xmath3 as well as @xmath404988 , 4994 and [ o i ] @xmath326300 emission .",
    "three of four early - type stars within the cluster core are confirmed as be stars .",
    "adaptive optics imaging of lkh@xmath3 234 using nirc2 on keck ii reveals a number of embedded sources in the region including the class i protostar 2mass j21430696 + 660641.7 .",
    "a bright , well - resolved companion of lkh@xmath3 234 is also detected having a pa of 97@xmath2 and a separation of 188 .",
    "of note several mid - infrared sources that are apparent in _ spitzer _ irac and mips imaging of the region are not detected in the keck ao @xmath81 imaging .",
    "assuming all nirc2 and irac sources to be associated with the cluster , the stellar surface density near lkh@xmath3 234 is several hundred stars pc@xmath83 .",
    "our interpretation of the structure of the remnant molecular clouds and the distribution of young stars in the region is that bd+65@xmath21638 is primarily responsible for evacuating the parsec - scale cavity in l1181 .",
    "lkh@xmath3 234 and a small number of deeply embedded protostars are forming within the ridge of compressed gas , possibly triggered by the collapse of bd+65@xmath21638 and bd+65@xmath21637 .",
    "star formation within the compact cluster has been rapid and coeval given the relatively narrow pre - main sequence evident in the color - magnitude diagram .",
    "the formation of other intermediate - mass stars to the north and south of the cluster core including svs 10 and firs 2 , will likely further disrupt the molecular cloud , effectively ending the era of star formation in the region .",
    "this paper is dedicated to the memory of george h. herbig who passed away on 12 october 2013 at the age of 93 after a career spanning more than 70 years .",
    "he is considered by many to be the father of observational star formation , and as a testament to the impact of his contributions upon the field , classes of pre - main sequence objects now bear his name .",
    "an intellectual giant , his extraordinary physical insight , natural curiosity , and uncanny ability to ask the right questions led to tremendous advances in our understanding of the star formation process .",
    "there are few papers today on the subject of star formation that can not trace their origins back to work initiated by george during his time at lick observatory , the university of california at santa cruz , and at the institute for astronomy , university of hawaii .",

    "<S> about 80 h@xmath3 emission sources brighter than @xmath423 are identified in the region , many of which are presumably t tauri star members of the cluster . </S>",
    "<S> we also present deep ( @xmath5@xmath623 ) , optical ( @xmath7 ) photometry of a field centered on the reflection nebula and spectral types for more than 130 sources determined from low dispersion , optical spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> the narrow pre - main sequence evident in the color - magnitude diagram suggests that star formation was rapid and coeval . </S>",
    "<S> a median age of about 1.8 myr is inferred for the h@xmath3 and literature - identified x - ray emission sources having established spectral types , using pre - main sequence evolutionary models . </S>",
    "<S> our interpretation of the structure of the molecular cloud and the distribution of young stellar objects is that bd+65@xmath21638 is primarily responsible for evacuating the blister - like cavity within the molecular cloud . </S>",
    "<S> lkh@xmath3 234 and several embedded sources evident in near infrared adaptive optics imaging have formed recently within the ridge of compressed molecular gas . the compact cluster of low - mass stars formed concurrently with the early - type members , concentrated within a central radius of @xmath60.7 pc . </S>",
    "<S> star formation is simultaneously occurring in a semi - circular arc some @xmath63 pc in radius that outlines remaining dense regions of molecular gas . </S>",
