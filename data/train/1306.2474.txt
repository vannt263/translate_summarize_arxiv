    "recent years have seen radical developments in the understanding of supernovae ( sne ) , driven by larger samples , higher quality and better - sampled spectroscopy and lightcurves , and better control of selection systematics through dedicated sn searches .",
    "one result of this has been that the traditional empirically - motivated classification system of sne has faced a series of challenges , with the finding of many transients that do not fit into any of the existing classifications . indeed , in the case of the transients that are discussed in the present paper , it is not yet clear whether they lie within the broad class of core - collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) , or should be considered as a subset of the type ia sne class ( sneia ) , with long - lived progenitors and a final explosion mechanism involving a white dwarf ( wd ) primary .",
    "the aims of this paper are to constrain the progenitor systems of two of these putative new classes of supernova ; one termed ` ca - rich ' on the basis of the relative strength of calcium lines in spectra observed during the nebular phase ( also called ",
    "sn2005e - like  after the prototypical event ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and another possibly related class that includes sne 2002cx @xcite and 2008 ha , termed ` sn2002cx - like ' . in their overall spectral properties ,",
    "the ca - rich transients quite closely resemble ccsne of type ib ( i.e. lacking hydrogen , but showing strong helium features ) which led to the claim by @xcite that one of the members of the class , sn2005cz , could indeed be a core - collapse object with a 10  m@xmath0 zero - age progenitor .",
    "this would be a surprising discovery , given that the host galaxy of sn2005cz , ngc  4589 , is an elliptical galaxy with a ` classical e2 morphology ' @xcite , and a corresponding expectation of a predominantly old stellar population .",
    "simultaneously , the even more extreme environment of sn2005e , the prototypical member of the ca - rich class that occurred far from the disc plane of an early type s0/a galaxy , ngc  1032 , led @xcite to conclude that these explosions are likely to arise from the accretion of helium on to an old , low - mass progenitor , probably a wd .",
    "modelling was used to show that such a progenitor can reproduce the observed properties , with ejecta that has high velocities but low masses , and a composition that is dominated by the products of helium burning .",
    "@xcite extended this analysis to sn2005cz in ngc  4589 , again preferring a low - mass , long - lived progenitor , in contradiction to @xcite .",
    "the spectroscopic and environmental properties of the general class of these ca - rich transients have been investigated by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the former identified eight sne in this group ( sn2000ds , sn2001co , sn2003h , sn2003dg , sn2003dr , sn2005cz , sn2005e and sn2007ke ) and the latter identified three additional objects in this class from the palomar transient factory survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* henceforth ptf ) .",
    "@xcite combined these three new objects ( ptf09dav , ptf10iuv ( sn2010et ) and ptf11bij ) with two of the better observed earlier events ( sn2005e and sn2007ke ) which share common properties of low peak luminosities , fast photometric evolution , high ejecta velocities , strong ca emission lines and locations in the extreme outskirts of their host galaxies . they follow @xcite in preferring long - lived , low - mass progenitors , pointing out that the core - collapse objects with the lowest generally - accepted progenitor masses , those of type ii - p , are almost never found at the extreme outlying locations that characterise these five ca - rich events .",
    "@xcite have reported on another possible member of the ca - rich class , sn2012hn , that was discovered by the catalina real - time transient survey .",
    "this was initially classified as a peculiar type ic supernova @xcite , but @xcite conclude from analysis of later spectroscopic and light - curve data that sn2012hn much more closely resembles members of the ca - rich class , with a low peak luminosity and rapid evolution .",
    "this is supported by its location in the outskirts of an early type ( e / s0 ) galaxy ( discussed further in this paper ) .",
    "however , it should be noted that @xcite find some detailed spectral differences between sn2012hn and other members of the ca - rich class .",
    "a very recent study by @xcite has investigated the progenitors of the ca - rich class by comparing their host galaxy locations to results from cosmological simulations . by comparison to the simulated metallicity distribution in hosts , they find the progenitors are likely to be of low metallicity and , tied with their remote locations compared to the bulk of the host stellar mass , consequently of old age ( @xmath110  gyr ) .",
    "they conclude that a massive star origin for such events is disfavoured .",
    "some similarities exist between the ca - rich events and the unusual transient sn2008 ha @xcite , in particular the extremely low luminousity and the inferred low ejecta - mass , and some similaritites in the late spectra .",
    "sn2008 ha , however , does not show evidence for helium ( it is classified as a sn type ia event ) and has extremely low photospheric velocity ( @xmath12000  km  s@xmath2 cf .",
    "6000 - 11000  km  s@xmath2 for the ca - rich transients ) .",
    "@xcite have recently linked sn2008 ha and similar objects , including the prototypical example sn2002cx @xcite , to a proposed new class of stellar explosion , that they term ` iax ' .",
    "these differ from normal type ia sne in having lower maximum - light ejecta velocities ( 2000 - 8000  km  s@xmath2 ) and lower peak luminosities for a given light - curve shape .",
    "sn2008 ha then appears as probably the most extreme object in this class identified to date , with the lowest peak luminosity , and ejecta velocities at the bottom end of the range for this class .",
    "@xcite infer high rates , with @xmath130 for every 100 sneia in the local universe .",
    "given the still debated / unknown origin of these events we will generally use the term ` transients ' rather than ` supernovae ' throughout this paper .",
    "various models were suggested for the origin of these transients including complete thermonuclear deflagration of a wd @xcite , failed detonation of a c / o wd @xcite or possibly a peculiar type of ccsn event @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested the progenitors to be c / o wds that accrete material from a he - star , and therefore consider some possible connections between sn2002cx - like and ca - rich transients , where both type of events arise from a he - shell detonation scenario .",
    "however , one of the major differences between the two types is their environment , as first noted by @xcite .",
    "the ca - rich events occur in all galaxy types ( with a large fraction in early - type galaxies ) , and/or far from the centres of host galaxies @xcite , whereas sn2002cx - like transients preferentially occur in late - type , star - forming galaxies , indicating a possibility for having younger progenitor systems .",
    "@xcite suggest that the difference might originate from a different origin of the accreted he in the two cases , i.e. sn2002cx - like events arise from accretion from a he - rich non - degenerate donor star , whereas the ca - rich events originate from accretion from a degenerate he - wd .",
    "@xcite discuss the class of sn2002cx - like events in general , and sn2008 ha specifically , and conclude that these may be low - luminosity ccsne , with progenitors that are either high - mass ( 25 - 30  m@xmath0 ) wolf - rayet stars , or stars from the low - mass limit of ccsne ( 7 - 9  m@xmath0 ) .",
    "however , @xcite have recently discussed sn2008 ha in the context of a study of the rates of ccsne , and on the balance of evidence decide in favour of a thermonuclear interpretation .",
    "they thus exclude it from their study , although they warn that the evidence is far from conclusive , and that further study of sn2008 ha and other sn2002cx - like transients is clearly required .",
    "it is clear from the above discussion that the association with different types of stellar environment is of key importance in distinguishing between these different types of luminous transients , and in constraining the possible progenitor objects .",
    "however , much of the environmental information , e.g. the association of the ca - rich transients with old populations and sn2002cx - like transients with young , lacks quantification and in many cases is little more than anecdotal .",
    "host galaxy classifications give some useful information , but they are notoriously subjective and , even if free from actual errors , they do not give precise information on the stellar population at the location of the transient event .",
    "for example , even a late - type spiral may have a bulge , or extreme outer disc , that is entirely composed of old stars . in this paper",
    ", we will make use of both host galaxy types and quantified measures of star - formation activity , local to the sites of events within their host galaxies , applied specifically to the known samples of ca - rich and sn2002cx - like transients , to determine whether they appear to rise from the same progenitor populations , and to compare these populations with the same measures for other types of sn ( including ` normal ' sneia , and core collapse types sne ib , ic and ii - p ) .",
    "the methods we employ are explained in detail in @xcite ; these have been previously applied to large samples of supernovae in two subsequent papers @xcite .",
    "the last of these three papers provides the main comparison sample for the current work .    following previous work , each transient",
    "is assigned a normalised cumulative rank ( ncr ) , based on pixel statistics of a continuum - subtracted h@xmath3 image of the host ( taken either prior to , or long after the transient ) , as a measure of the degree of association of the transient with recent star formation within its host .",
    "the continuum subtracted h@xmath3 images are trimmed to contain the host and transient location and then binned @xmath4 such that the pixel location of the transient given by the wcs forms the centre of a @xmath4 ` super - pixel ' .",
    "a pixel in our binned images represents @xmath5 arcsecond across the various instruments used , or @xmath6 pc at the mean galaxy distance .",
    "star residuals and artefacts arising from saturation in the subtracted images are masked using a local median .",
    "pixel values in this binned image are sorted , cumulatively summed and then normalised by the total sum of pixel values . in this way",
    "each pixel now has an associated ncr value between 0 and 1 ( any negative values are set to 0 ) .",
    "any pixel with ncr  @xmath7 is considered a background pixel , i.e. there is no h@xmath3 flux at that position .",
    "positively valued pixels are then ranked within the ncr method such that low values have an association with weak emission , and high values are coincident with the brightest h@xmath3 emitting regions of the host .",
    "specifically , the ncr value is the fraction of host galaxy flux that is below the level of flux at the location of the transient , i.e. ncr  @xmath8 means the transient location is at the site of the most intense star - formation activity within its host galaxy .    using these methods , @xcite",
    "find a clear separation of the ccsn subtypes , with types ii - p , ib and ic forming a clear sequence of increasing strength of association with current sites of star formation , and high mean ncr values .",
    "this is most simply interpreted in terms of a sequence of increasing mean progenitor mass , and hence decreasing progenitor lifetime .",
    "@xcite has looked at the progenitor constraints that can be drawn from association of sne with ongoing star formation , using a smaller sample than @xcite with higher spatial resolution , and employing rather different statistical methods based on distance to the nearest region of h@xmath3 emission . @xcite",
    "finds very similar results to @xcite and @xcite in terms of the difference of strength association between sneii and sneibc , which he interprets in terms of a large fraction of sneii outliving their natal star - formation regions .",
    "@xcite argues that the complications involving lack of resolution of individual sf regions should obscure any differences between the correlation strengths for shorter - lived , higher - mass progenitors than those of the sneii , but this argument seems hard to reconcile with the clear statistical differences found for the populations of sne ib and ic investigated by @xcite .",
    "h@xmath3 was chosen as a star formation tracer since there already exists large samples of ncr values for the more common sn types which can be compared to .",
    "the typical duration of h@xmath3 emission from hii regions is comparable to that of the ages of the middle - to - lower mass end of ccsne . @xcite",
    "show the evolution of the h@xmath3 equivalent width for a single burst in starburst99 , which weakens strongly after 5 myr , falling to very low values after @xmath115 myr ( roughly the lifetime of a 14 m@xmath9 star ) .",
    "this , however , is a lower limit since a typical star formation region will not form stars in a delta - function manner .",
    "h@xmath3 imaging thus allows us , through the ncr method , to distinguish between transients whose progenitor ages fall entirely within , or overlap with , this limit .",
    "since each transient s ncr value is normalised to its own host , we are not sensitive to absolute calibtration issues of h@xmath3 as a star - formation rate tracer @xcite .",
    "the ncr method is particularly reliant on the h@xmath3 filter used for observations .",
    "its transmission profile must allow for detection of h@xmath3 over a reasonable velocity range so as to detect all host galaxy emission , whilst being narrow enough to allow for accurate subtraction of the underlying continuum light .",
    "clearly , if a filter fails to transmit h@xmath3 emission from some regions of the host , this will affect the ncr value of the transient .",
    "as such , transients that are potentially well separated from their hosts in recession velocity ( v@xmath10 ) provide a problem of filter choice , especially when v@xmath10 can not be determined for the transient itself . in the present study , for all cases except ptf09dav , the filter with a central wavelength best matching the host - h@xmath3 wavelength was chosen ; for ptf09dav , the redshift of the transient was used to find the best matched filter as its host is anonymous . given the widths of the filters ( typically @xmath120003000  km  s@xmath2 ) , this meant h@xmath3 over a broad range of host velocities would be detected , giving confidence that we are not missing some regions of h@xmath3 emission in the host or , importantly , at the location of the transient .    [ cols=\"<,<,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : ncr_means ]",
    "though the total rate of ca - rich and sn2002cx - like transients might be significant compared to type ia sne , the actual number of observed events is still small , mostly due to their low luminousity which limits their detection at large distances . for this reason the sample sizes in this study are limited . nevertheless , a clear picture emerges from our results , pointing to significant differences between the host environments of these two transient types , which , in turn , implies different types of progenitor systems . the clear distinction between the two classes is strengthened by the possible contamination from misclassified transients in each sample",
    "such contamination would serve to dilute any distinct behaviour between the two samples .    the first indications for such difference come from the host galaxy populations analysis .",
    "all sn2002cx - like transients have host galaxies that display strong , recent star formation activity .",
    "the progenitor systems are therefore likely associated with a young stellar population , quite similar to that of ccsne . conversely , six of the eleven ca - rich hosts ( diregarding sn2010et , where the host is not certain ) are early - type galaxies with no detected star formation , and therefore point to an old stellar population lacking any young , massive stars .",
    "our host galaxy distributions provide strong support to the suggestion of @xcite of an old progenitor system for ca - rich transients .",
    "their original analysis of a smaller sample of events , showed the host galaxy distribution of various sn types compared with the ca - rich events .",
    "the distribution of ca - rich transient hosts displays similarities with that of regular sneia , a trend strengthened by the addition of similar events identified since then presented here .",
    "furthermore , our ncr analysis allows the locations of the transients _ within _ their respective hosts to be investigated .",
    "more than simply saying the sn2002cx - like transients are found in hosts that display ongoing star formation , we quantitatively find a good match between sn2002cx - like events and sneii - p with respect to association with recent star formation in their host galaxy .",
    "such a match would indicate a similar progenitor age for sn2002cx - like transients and sneii - p ( i.e. a typical delay time of @xmath11 myrs ) . from the ncr analysis we confirm that ca - rich transients do not appear to follow recent star formation in their hosts and",
    "closely resemble the distribution of ` normal ' sneia , whose progenitors are expected to have significant life times ( @xmath1  gyrs ) .",
    "the samples are , as mentioned previously , inherently eclectic and suffer many biases relative a volume - limited sample .",
    "their fainter magnitudes compared to sne in general would suggest that they will be difficult to detect on bright galaxy regions .",
    "we note , however , that sn2003dg ( ca - rich ) and sn2005cc ( sn2002cx - like ) , both typical of the mean brightness of their sample , were discovered on the brightest central regions of their respective hosts .",
    "the preference for discovery in fainter host locations would strengthen the arguement for sn2002cx - like events association with star - formation , given it is plausible to miss some of these events if they are coincident with the brightest hii regions .",
    "the discovery magnitudes quoted in tables [ tab : carich_props ] and [ tab:2008ha_props ] show there is no statistically significant difference between distribution of brightnesses in each sample , suggesting any bias from magnitude - limited searches will affect each sample similarly ( although their faintness will possibly affect the comparison to ` normal ' sn types ) .",
    "our analysis provides new clues regarding the origin of these peculiar transient events , and can help constrain the suggested theoretical models . in the following we discuss these constraints in view of the suggested theoretical models for these transients .    _",
    "ca - rich transients : _ several models were suggested for the origin of the ca - rich events . the model of he - shell detonation on a co wd , following he accretion from a he - wd , was first suggested by @xcite and gained additional support from the theoretical analysis by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "such a model points to a double degenerate origin for these types of transient .",
    "in particular @xcite suggested a low mass co wd progenitor , which requires a long lived stellar origin , and possibly a low metallicity environment .",
    "an alternative model of a cc origin as suggested by @xcite ( see also discussion by @xcite ) would require a young , star - forming environment .",
    "our h@xmath3-based analysis of the hosts of the ca - rich transients makes clear that the majority of these are occurring a very long way from any detectable star formation .",
    "this also strengthens the arguments of @xcite and @xcite that even extremely high - velocity , high - mass runaway stars are implausible candidates as progenitors of the ca - rich transients . we therefore conclude that our analysis consistently points towards old progenitor systems , and a likely thermonuclear origin , for the ca - rich transients ( see additional support through the analysis of @xcite ) .    _",
    "sn2002cx - like transients : _ several models were also suggested for the origin of sn2002cx - like events . @xcite and @xcite suggested they originate from the deflagration of a chandrasekhar mass c / o wd .",
    "this model encounters difficulties explaining the diversity of such events and in particular the extremely low - mass and sub - luminous sn2008 ha event . a more recent and detailed model by ( * ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) discusses a failed detonation model , in which a deflagration scenario fails to explode the wd , and only burns and ejects a fraction of the wd , leaving behind an intact ( but now lower mass and polluted ) wd remnant .",
    "this scenario can similarly explain the low velocities observed for sn2002cx - like events due to deflagration , but in addition provides a robust explanation for the diversity of the sn2002cx - like events and the possible production of extremely low - mass and low luminosity events",
    ". both of these models begin with a chandrasekhar mass wd , similar to the single - degenerate model suggested for type ia sne .",
    "wds initially formed at high masses ( which in turn form from higher mass stellar progenitors with shorter lifetimes ) and require less additional accretion in order to achieve the chandrasekhar mass .",
    "this would generally point to their association with younger environments , where more massive stars and binaries evolve and transfer mass .",
    "however , the evolution towards the chandrasekhar mass is still expected to be generally longer , and sometimes much longer , than the typical lifetimes of ccsn stellar progenitors ( @xmath128 m@xmath9 stars ) .",
    "although some sn2002cx - like transients have been found in old environments @xcite , our finding suggest a very young environment for the progenitors of these transients , comparable with that of type ii - p sne . the environmental constraints we find therefore do not exclude , but are less favorable for a chandrasekhar mass c / o wd explosion .",
    "@xcite suggest neutron star - wd mergers as a possible origin for sn2002cx - like events .",
    "some of the properties of sn2002cx - like transients are qualitatively reproduced by the model , but more detailed studies are needed .",
    "this model would suggest a mixed distribution of old and young environments , due to the distribution of the gravitational wave inspiral time leading to the merger , in contrast with the strong bias to very young environment we find here .",
    "in addition , the total rate of neutron star - wd mergers is about 3 per cent of that of snia  even if all such mergers resulted in an sn2002cx - like event , the expected rates would be an order of magnitude lower than those observed @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested sn2002cx - like transients arise from a variant of ccsne with low ejecta velocity , although currently no detailed theoretical modeling of such events has been done and shown to produce such events .",
    "our findings of similar environments for both these transients and those of ccsne , are therefore consistent with the cc origin of sn2002cx - like transients .",
    "in particular , our detailed ncr statistics indicate that sn2002cx - like events share similar environments to those of sneii - p , i.e. while they are evidently associated with star formation , a substantial fraction appear to outlive their natal hii regions , resulting in lower values of the ncr index than would be expected for the highest mass progenitors . in the context of this scenario , our analysis would therefore point to the lower - mass , 7 - 9  m@xmath0 ( with typical lifetimes of @xmath11 myrs ) progenitors discussed by @xcite , rather than the alternative high - mass wolf - rayet stars also discussed by them .",
    "it is , however , still difficult to explain the complete lack of star - formation / young environment for one of the sn2002cx - like events , sn2008ge @xcite .",
    "two of the sn2002cx - like transients show spectral evidence for helium . taken together with",
    "the young environment found for these events ( beside sn2008ge ) , @xcite suggest this as possible evidence for their origin from a helium star accretion on to a wd .",
    "however , a helium layer may also form following hydrogen accretion and burning into helium on a wd ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that although the existence of helium in even a small fraction of these events is a potentially important clue for their origin , its interpretation is still inconclusive .",
    "our investigations of the environments and host types of ca - rich transients show a lack of association with recent star formation ( similar to that of sneia ) , and thus point to old progenitor systems , consistent with helium - shell detonation on low mass c / o wds , and inconsistent with a ccsn origin .",
    "conversely , we find the sn2002cx - like transients to be well matched by young progenitors ( likely @xmath1350 myrs lifetime ) through an association to star - formation that is similar to that displayed by type ii - p sne .",
    "such young progenitors are less favorable to failed detonations of chandrasekhar mass c / o wds , and more consistent with either the core - collapse of a 7 - 9 m@xmath9 star , or a wd explosion following the accretion of helium star ( note that one event , sn2008ge does not seem to fit with this conclusion ) . while the failed detonation model for these events appears to be consistent with the observable parameters of sn2002cx - like events themselves",
    ", the latter two models currently lack an actual detailed study .",
    "therefore , they can not yet be adequately compared with observations , beyond the generally consistent aspects of their expected environments as studied here .",
