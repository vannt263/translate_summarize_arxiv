    "asymmetry in the proton sea has been well - established by experiment @xcite .",
    "many theoretical models for the asymmetry have been proposed , based on pauli - blocking , a meson cloud , chiral perturbation theory , instantons , or statistical processes . for reviews ,",
    "see kumano @xcite , and peng and garvey . in this paper",
    "we examine both perturbative and non - perturbative contributions to the proton sea , and show that either will lead to an asymmetry . since both contributions are present , we propose a hybrid model , and compare to experiment .",
    "as first suggested by thomas @xcite , and later by henley and miller @xcite , the meson cloud of the proton provides a natural explanation of the asymmetry .",
    "the fluctuation of the proton ( @xmath4 ) into a neutron ( @xmath5 ) and a @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) creates an excess of @xmath0 over @xmath1 .",
    "the meson cloud is represented in a fock state expansion of the proton in terms of mesons and baryons @xmath8 the leading term in the expansion is the ` bare ' proton , taken to consist of valence quarks alone or valence quarks plus a symmetric light sea .",
    "z is a normalization constant , @xmath9 is the probability amplitude for finding a physical nucleon in a state consisting of a baryon @xmath10 with longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath11 and meson @xmath12 of momentum fraction @xmath13 , each with squared transverse relative momentum @xmath14 .",
    "the quark distribution functions @xmath15 are given by @xmath16 with @xmath17 the quark distribution function of the ` bare ' proton , and @xmath18    the splitting functions @xmath19 depend on coupling constants , form factors , and cutoffs .",
    "models differ in the number of meson - baryon states included in the expansion , the parton distributions @xmath20 and @xmath21 , form factors , cutoffs and coupling constants .",
    "the dominant terms in the expansion are @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the first term causes a sea flavor asymmetry .",
    "the second term contributes equal numbers of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , so it will affect the ratio @xmath24 , but not the difference @xmath25 .",
    "we have shown @xcite that the inclusion of the @xmath26 isoscalar contribution improves agreement with experiment , and huang _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite find that an improved description of the data at higher @xmath3 is obtained if the @xmath27 is included as well .",
    "however , the theoretical ratio still remains above 1 for large @xmath3 .",
    "a full meson cloud calculation should include all higher order terms in the expansion , @xmath28 in fig .",
    "[ mcm ] we show our calculation with only 2 cutoff values , determined by a fit to the experimental integrated asymmetry @xcite of @xmath29 .",
    "we can improve agreement with experiment by further adjustment of cutoffs , but the ratio remains above 1 for larger values of @xmath3 .",
    "zhang _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have used a simple statistical model which is based on a fock state expansion of the proton in terms of its quark and gluon states : @xmath30 with @xmath31 the number of @xmath32 pairs , @xmath33 the number of @xmath34 pairs and @xmath35 the number of gluons .",
    "the probability of finding a proton in the state @xmath36 is @xmath37 . taking into account the processes @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , detailed balance between any two states leads to @xmath41 and an integrated asymmetry of 0.123 , in remarkable agreement with experiment .",
    "parton distribution functions are determined by a monte carlo simulation of the distribution of momenta among the @xmath42 partons in each fock state .    in fig .",
    "[ stat ] we show our calculation of the sea asymmetry , using this model at the starting scale and our evolution to the experimental scale .",
    "as for the meson cloud model , the difference is reasonable , but the ratio is relatively constant for larger @xmath3 , in disagreement with experiment .",
    "we have proposed that since both perturbative and non - perturbative processes contribute to the proton sea , a hybrid model should be used to incorporate both mechanisms .",
    "we use the statistical model to represent the the ` bare ' proton parton distribution in the meson cloud model , which introduces an additional sea asymmetry .",
    "our preliminary results are shown in fig  [ hybrid ] .",
    "only 2 cutoffs were used , determined by a fit to the integrated asymmetry .",
    "the difference is well - fit , but the ratio is too flat . calculations with further variation of the meson - baryon cutoff values are in progress @xcite .",
    "meson cloud , statistical and hybrid models describe the ratio @xmath43/@xmath44 for @xmath45 , but fail to agree with the experimental trend to return to symmetry , or even @xmath1 dominance at larger @xmath3 .",
    "higher statistics results from e-906/seaquest @xcite should determine the magnitude of the disagreement between current theory and experiment .",
