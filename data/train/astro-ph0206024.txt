    "observational study of thermal emission from isolated ( non - accreting ) neutron stars ( nss ) became possible after the launch of _ einstein _ ( 1979 ) and _ exosat _ ( 1983 ) , the first x - ray observatories equipped with x - ray telescopes .",
    "contrary to nonthermal radiation of nss , generated in the pulsar magnetospheres and observed from radio to @xmath0-rays , thermal emission originates immediately at the surface , with the bulk of the energy flux in the soft x - ray band .",
    "therefore , comparing the spectra and the light curves with the models for ns thermal radiation ( see the contribution by zavlin & pavlov in these proceedings ; zp02 hereafter ) , one can infer the ns surface temperature , magnetic field , gravitational acceleration , and chemical composition , as well as the ns mass and radius .",
    "the analysis of such observations allows one to trace thermal evolution of nss ( tsuruta 1998 ) and constrain the properties of the superdense matter in the ns interiors ( d.g .",
    "yakovlev et al . , these proceedings ) .",
    "observational manifestations of nss are very diverse , and only some of these exotic objects are suitable for observing the ns thermal emission .",
    "most of the _ detected _ nss are radio pulsars .",
    "very young , active pulsars ( with ages @xmath1 yr  e.g. , the crab pulsar ) are quite hot , with expected surface temperatures @xmath22 mk , but their nonthermal radiation is so bright that the thermal radiation is hardly observable .",
    "the nonthermal component in x - ray emission of middle - aged pulsars ( @xmath3@xmath4 yr  e.g. , b0656 + 14 , b105552 ) is much fainter , and their thermal radiation , with temperatures 0.31 mk , can dominate at soft x - ray and uv energies .",
    "the surfaces of old pulsars ( @xmath5 yr  e.  g. , b0950 + 08 , b1929 + 10 , j04374715 ) are too cold to be seen in x - rays , but their polar caps are expected to be heated up to a few million kelvins , hot enough to emit observable thermal x - ray radiation .",
    "in addition to active pulsars , a number of radio - quiet isolated nss emitting thermal - like x - rays have been detected , with typical temperatures @xmath65 mk .",
    "they are usually subdivided in four classes : anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ; see s.  mereghetti et al . , these proceedings ) , soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ; kouveliotou 1995 ) , `` dim '' or `` truly isolated '' radio - silent nss ( i.e. , not associated with supernova remnants [ snrs ] ; treves et al .",
    "2000 ) , and compact central sources ( ccos ) in snrs ( pavlov et al .",
    "2002a ) which have been identified with neither active pulsars nor axps / sgrs .",
    "their observational manifestations ( particularly , multiwavelength spectra ) are quite different from those of `` active '' pulsars , and their properties have not been investigated as extensively , but the presense of the thermal component in their radiation provides a clue to understand the nature of these objects .",
    "first thermally emitting isolated nss were detected with _ einstein _",

    "s ,  and detected x - rays from more than 30 radio pulsars , including a few thermal emitters ( gelman 1995 ) , and discovered several radio - silent nss ( see becker & pavlov 2002 for a review ) .",
    "thermal emission from a few isolated nss was also detected in the optical - uv range with the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( e.g. , pavlov , stringfellow & crdova 1996 ; walter & matthews 1997 ) .    the new era in observing x - ray emission from nss has started with the launch of two currently operating x - ray observatories of outstanding capabilities , _ chandra _ and _ xmm_-newton . in this review",
    "we present recent results on thermal x - ray emission from isolated nss of various types observed with .",
    "a more general overview of  observations of nss is presented in this volume by m.c .",
    "weisskopf , while the _ xmm_-newton results on nss are reviewed by w.  becker .",
    "x - ray emission of rotation - powered pulsars generally consists of two components  thermal and nonthermal .",
    "the nonthermal component , generated by relativistic particles in the ns magnetosphere , is , as a rule , strongly pulsed and characterized by a power - law ( pl ) spectrum .",
    "studying the magnetospheric component is important to understand the mechanisms of the multiwavelength ( optical through gamma - rays ) pulsar radiation .",
    "the thermal component , emitted from the ns surface , can be observed in x - rays if it is not buried under the nonthermal component , as in very young pulsars , and if the temperature is not too low , as in old pulsars .",
    "weak pulsations of the thermal emission can be caused by temperature nonuniformities along the ns surface and/or anisotropy of the radiation intensities in a strong magnetic field ( see zp02 ) .",
    "stronger pulsations of thermal radiation can be observed in old pulsars which emit thermal x - ray radiation from small , hot polar caps around the magnetic poles . in this section",
    "we present the results of our analysis of  data on pulsars of different ages : the young vela pulsar ( @xmath7 kyr ) , the middle - aged pulsars b0656 + 14 ( @xmath8 kyr ) and b105552 ( @xmath9 kyr ) , and the very old millisecond pulsar j04374715 ( @xmath10 gyr ) .",
    "first  observations of this famous 89-ms radio , optical and @xmath0-ray pulsar in the vela snr ( the distance @xmath11 pc  caraveo et al .",
    "2001 ) were carried out with the imaging array of the high resolution camera ( hrc - i ) in january and february 2000 .",
    "these observations revealed a very complicated structure of the pwn around the pulsar ( see fig .",
    "[ velaimg ] ) studied by helfand , halpern & gotthelf ( 2001 ) and pavlov et al .",
    "( 2000 , 2001a ) . the superb spatial resolution of  made it possible , for the first time , to resolve the pulsar from its surroundings and investigate the pulsar s radiation .",
    "the spectral data on the vela pulsar were obtained in two observations ( pavlov et al .",
    "2001b ) . a 25 ks hrc - s observation with low energy transmission grating ( letg ) of january 2000 provided the high - resolution pulsar spectrum in the energy range @xmath122.0  kev",
    ". the analysis of the letg spectrum ( @xmath13 source counts ) did not reveal statistically significant spectral lines .",
    "the spectrum is best fitted with thermal models ( blackbody , hydrogen ns atmosphere ) , but the observed spectrum somewhat exceeds the model spectra at @xmath14  kev ( see upper panel in fig .  [ velaspec1 ] ) , indicating the presence of a second component with a harder spectrum .",
    "the spectrum at higher photon energies was provided by a 37 ks observation ( october 1999 ) with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) , taken in the continuous clocking ( cc ) mode that allows timing at the expense of imaging capability in one dimension .",
    "the 1-d count distributions of the pulsar and the nebula show that the pulsar is much brighter than the pwn background at @xmath15 kev , and it is discernible up to 8  kev , where the charged particle background takes over ( see fig .  1 in pavlov et al .",
    "the pulsar spectrum in the 0.58 kev band ( @xmath16 source counts ) does not fit one - component models , but it fits fairly well two - component models ( e.g. , a pl plus a thermal component  see the middle panel in fig .  2 ) .",
    "the analysis of the combined ( letg plus acis ) spectra proves that the pulsar s soft x - ray emission , at @xmath17  kev , is indeed dominated by a thermal component ( see bottom panel in fig .",
    "[ velaspec1 ] ) .",
    "the parameters of this component are drastically different for the blackbody fit ( @xmath181.5  mk , @xmath19@xmath20\\,d_{300}$ ] km ) and the ns hydrogen atmosphere fit ( @xmath210.71  mk , @xmath22@xmath23 d_{300}$ ] km ) . such strong difference is explained by the fact that the spectrum of a hydrogen atmosphere decreases with increasing photon energy slower than the ideal wien spectrum because the radiation at higher energies comes from hotter layers . as a result ,",
    "the blackbody fit to a hydrogen atmosphere spectrum yields a temperature higher than the true effective temperature and an area smaller than the true emitting area ( see zp02 for more details ) .",
    "the small blackbody radius might hint that the observed radiation is emitted from hot spots ( e.g. , polar caps heated by relativistic particles produced in the pulsar magnetosphere ) , whereas the radius obtained in the hydrogen atmosphere fit implies radiation emitted from the entire ns surface .",
    "rigorously speaking , the surface ( atmosphere ) of a ns is not a black body , but a blackbody spectrum could mimic the spectrum of a heavy - element ( e.g. , iron ) atmosphere if it is observed with low spectral resolution .",
    "however , the lack of significant spectral lines in the letg spectrum indicates that there are no heavy elements , neither he nor metals , in the radiating atmospheric layers . on the other hand",
    ", even strongly magnetized hydrogen does not have spectral features in the investigated energy band ( all the hydrogen features are below 0.17  kev for the field of @xmath24 g , adopted for the vela pulsar ) .",
    "therefore , the hydrogen atmosphere interpretation looks more plausible . with this interpretation ,",
    "the effective temperature of the vela pulsar is well below the predictions of the `` standard '' models of the ns cooling ( e.g. , tsuruta 1998 ) .",
    "an important result of this analysis is the detection of the hard spectral component which dominates at @xmath25  kev",
    ". the slope ( photon index ) of this pl component is @xmath261.8 if the ns hydrogen atmosphere model is adopted for the soft component . with this interpretation",
    ", the overall x - ray spectrum of the the vela pulsar is quite similar to those of the three middle - aged pulsars , geminga , b105552 and b0656 + 14 ( see below ) , where the thermal component was detected , although the ratio of the nonthermal x - ray luminosity to the spin - down energy loss rate , @xmath27 in the 0.28.0  kev range , is a factor of @xmath28 smaller than observed for typical x - ray detected pulsars ( becker & trmper 1997 ) .",
    "if the @xmath29 ratio were as high as for other pulsars , the thermal radiation would be undetectable in the phase - integrated spectrum .",
    "it is illuminating to compare the nonthermal x - ray spectrum of the pulsar with those in other energy ranges .",
    "figure  [ velaspec2 ] shows the spectral flux of the pulsar from optical to gamma - rays .",
    "remarkably , the extrapolation of the pl spectrum obtained in the atmosphere - plus - pl fit matches fairly well with the optical and hard - x - ray ( soft-@xmath0-ray ) time - averaged fluxes . moreover , under the hypothesis that the pl spectrum has the same slope in the optical through x - ray range , we can constrain the photon index very tightly : @xmath301.45 .    the multicomponent structure of the pulsar radiation",
    "is also seen from its pulse profile .",
    "the hrc - i light curve is shown in figure  [ velalc ] ( see also helfand et al .",
    "2001 ; sanwal et al .",
    "it has at least three peaks  quite unusual for a pulsar , but not so surprising for the vela pulsar which shows up to four peaks in the hard x - ray bands observed with _",
    "rxte _ ( harding et al .  2002 ) .",
    "so far , only the analysis of phase - integrated spectra and energy - integrated light curves has been possible .",
    "phase - resolved spectral analysis and energy - resolved timing would be of crucial importance to elucidate the complicated emission mechanism(s ) of both the nonthermal and thermal components .",
    "in particular , the analysis of the phase - energy dependence of the thermal emission , based on the ns atmosphere models can make it possible to determine the surface distributions of the temperature and the magnetic field .      among about 40 rotation - powered pulsars detected with the previous and currently operating x - ray missions , middle - aged pulsars ( @xmath311 myr )",
    "are of special interest because their thermal emission is expected to dominate in soft x - rays .",
    "the best studied objects of this class are the `` three musketeers '' : psr b0656 + 14 , geminga , and psr b105552 .      psr b0656 + 14 ( @xmath32 kyr ) is the brightest of the three musketeers .",
    "observations with _ einstein _ , , and have shown that its x - ray spectrum consists of at least two components . the thermal component ( @xmath33 kev )",
    "resembles a soft blackbody spectrum with an apparent temperature of about 0.9 mk .",
    "because of the narrow energy band of and poor angular resolution of , the shape of the hard component ( at @xmath34  kev ) could hardly be determined from those data . for instance",
    ", the  spectra above 1  kev can be fitted equally well with a hard blackbody with temperature of about 2.54.0 mk or a pl with photon index @xmath353.0 .",
    "ir - optical - uv observations of the pulsar ( pavlov et al .  1997 ; koptsevich et al .",
    "2001 ) revealed a nonthermal pl component with @xmath361.5 , presumably emitted from the pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "to search for spectral features in the x - ray spectrum of psr b0656 + 14 and investigate the shape of its high - energy tail , the pulsar was observed with hrc - s / letg in november 1999 ( 38 ks exposure ) and acis - s ( in cc mode ) in december 2001 ( 25 ks exposure ) .",
    "the analysis of these data showed no significant features in the source spectrum . to obtain a good fit to the combined x - ray spectrum in the 0.26 kev band ,",
    "a three - component model is required .",
    "the high - energy tail ( @xmath37 kev ) fits best with a pl spectrum with a slope close to that of the optical spectrum . to constrain it more tightly",
    ", we assumed that the slope does not change from optical to x - rays , included the optical data in the fit , and obtained @xmath38 .",
    "the low - energy part of the spectrum ( @xmath39 kev ) fits well with a blackbody spectrum with temperature @xmath40 mk and equivalent radius of emitting sphere @xmath41 km .",
    "this thermal soft ( ts ) component is presumably emitted from the whole visible ns surface .",
    "to fit the spectrum at intermediate energies , one more component is required ( see fig .",
    "[ 0656spec1 ] ) . very likely , this is a thermal hard ( th ) component with temperature @xmath42 mk ( as given by the blackbody model ) emitted from pulsar s polar caps of radius @xmath43 km heated by relativistic particles streaming down from the pulsar acceleration zones .",
    "the bolometric luminosity of the ts component is @xmath44 erg s@xmath45 , vs.  @xmath46 erg s@xmath45 for the th component .",
    "the luminosity of the nonthermal component is @xmath47 erg s@xmath45 in the 0.110.0 kev range .",
    "this three - component model fits the data from ir through x - ray energies ( fig .",
    "[ 0656spec2 ] ) .",
    "using the magnetic hydrogen atmosphere models ( zp02 ) , instead of blackbodies , for the thermal components gives formally acceptable fits , with effective temperatures lower by a factor of about 2 ( e.g. , @xmath480.5 mk for the ts component ) .",
    "however , these fits imply either very small distances , @xmath49130 pc for @xmath50 km , or very large radii , @xmath5170 km for the ts component , at @xmath52 pc .",
    "therefore , applicability of these models to psr 0656 + 14 is questionable .",
    "the multicomponent structure of the pulsar x - ray radiation is also seen from the behavior of the pulse profiles shown in figure [ 0656lc ] .",
    "the shape of the light curves is energy dependent , with a significant phase shift ( @xmath53 of the period ) at 0.50.7  kev .",
    "the source pulsed fraction @xmath54 shows a complex behavior : it decreases with increasing energy from about 20% at @xmath550.3 kev down to about 7% at @xmath56 around 1 kev and increases again to @xmath57 at @xmath34 kev .",
    "the x - ray peak lags the radio peak by 0.20.4 of the period , depending on energy ( fig .",
    "[ 0656lc ] ) .    to establish the origin of the peak and the parameters of the x - ray radiation , one should analyze the spectra and the light curves together , with the aid of realistic models for x - ray emission . however , the spectra of the pulsar observed with the pre-  x - ray observatories , and even the  acis - s spectrum observed in cc mode , potentially have a contaminating component  synchrotron radiation from a pwn of a small angular size around the pulsar , which could not be resolved in those observations .",
    "a hint on extended emission around psr 0656 + 14 is seen in the zero - order letg / hrc - s image ( marshall & schulz 2002 ) , but that image is strongly contaminated by the diffraction spikes . the pulsar was also observed in a 5 ks exposure with acis - s3 in timed exposure mode ( december 2001 ) providing the data for spatial analysis of the x - ray emission in the vicinity of the pulsar .",
    "the analysis reveals a @xmath58@xmath59 extended structure around the piled - up image of the pulsar  first strong indication on pwn around a middle - aged pulsar ( see fig .",
    "[ 0656img ] ) . the pulsar s image , confined within a small , slightly elongated area of about @xmath60 diameter ( at the center of fig .  [ 0656img ] ) is surrounded by a putative pwn of rather complicated morphology .",
    "the estimated luminosity of the pwn is @xmath61  erg  s@xmath45 in the 0.110.0 kev range .",
    "a considerable fraction of the pwn radiation can contaminate the pulsar s radiation observed with the pre-  observatories and even with acis in cc mode .",
    "therefore , to unambiguously separate the pwn contribution , one should observe the pulsar and its surroundings in high - resolution imaging mode for longer time .",
    "the above estimates of the pulsar spectral parameters should be considered with caution until the properties of the putative pwn are studied and its radiation is separated from that of the pulsar .",
    "analysis of the  data on psr b105552 , taken in january 2000 with acis - s in cc mode ( 42 ks exposure ) , yields results very similar to those obtained for psr b0656 + 14 ( see sanwal et al .",
    "2002c for details ) .",
    "first , the acis spectrum , combined with that obtained with the  pspc , requires a three - component model ( fig .",
    "[ 1055xraysp ] ) .",
    "the high - energy tail of the spectrum ( @xmath37 kev ) is best described with a pl with @xmath62 ; such a component smoothly connects optical ( _ hst _ foc ) and gamma - ray ( _ cgro _ egret ) data ( fig .",
    "[ 1055spec ] ) .",
    "the spectrum at lower energies fits well with two thermal ( blackbody ) components , soft and hard .",
    "the best - fit model parameters to the phase - integrated spectrum are @xmath63 mk and @xmath64 km for the soft thermal component , @xmath65 mk and @xmath66 km for the hard thermal component , @xmath67 @xmath68 .",
    "the energy - resolved light curves of the pulsar derived from the acis data reveal energy - dependent variations in the pulsed fraction , the phase of the pulse , and the pulse shape ( fig .  [ 1055lc ] ) .",
    "in particular , the pulsed fraction increases from @xmath69 at about 0.30.4 kev to @xmath70 at @xmath71 kev . for this pulsar ,",
    "the x - ray pulse at @xmath72 kev is in phase with the main radio pulse , contrary to psr b0656 + 14 .",
    "the phase - resolved spectroscopy shows small variations in the parameters of the soft thermal component , whereas the emitting area for the hard thermal component varies significantly with the rotational phase ( @xmath73 changes between about 0.5 and 1.5 km ) , which can be interpreted as changing projection of the hot spot area .",
    "thus , we see remarkable similarity in the x - ray properties of the two middle - aged pulsars , b0656 + 14 and b105552 .",
    "interestingly , the temperature of the soft thermal component is approximately the same for these pulsars , although the characteristic age , @xmath74 , is a factor of 5 larger for b105552 .",
    "a possible explanation of this fact is that these nss have different properties ( e.g. , the mass of b105552 is lower  see d.g .",
    "yakovlev et al . , this volume ) .",
    "an alternative explanation is that the true age of a pulsar can be quite different from its characteristic age ( see below ) , so that one should be very cautious comparing the ns cooling models with the observations of pulsars .",
    "millisecond ( recycled ) radio pulsars are distinguished from ordinary pulsars by their very short and stable periods , @xmath75  ms , @xmath76  s  s@xmath45 .",
    "they are presumably very old objects , with spin - down ages @xmath77@xmath78  yr and low magnetic fields , @xmath79@xmath78  g. similar to ordinary pulsars , a millisecond pulsar can emit nonthermal x - rays from its magnetosphere .",
    "additionally , thermal x - rays can be emitted from pulsars polar caps heated up to x - ray temperatures by relativistic particles generated in the pulsar acceleration zones .    at a distance",
    "@xmath80  pc , psr j04374715 ( @xmath81 ms ) is the nearest and brightest millisecond pulsar known at both radio and x - ray wavelengths .",
    "it is in a 5.74  d binary orbit with a low - mass white dwarf companion .",
    "optical observations in h@xmath82 have revealed a bow - shock pwn , caused by the supersonic motion of the pulsar through the interstellar medium , with the bow - shock apex at about @xmath83 south - east of the pulsar , in the direction of the pulsar s proper motion .",
    "its x - ray radiation was discovered with  ( becker & trmper 1993 ) . the pulsar was also observed with _ euve _ ( halpern , martin , & marshall 1996 ) .",
    "the pre-  data , obtained in a narrow energy range of 0.12.0 kev , can be well fitted with a pl with photon index @xmath842.5 , or with a polar cap model with a nonuniform temperature distribution ( zavlin & pavlov 1998 [ zp98 ] ) . to discriminate between these two competing models ,",
    "the pulsar was observed with  acis ( may 2000 ; 26 ks exposure ; see zavlin et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the source spectrum prevails over background at energies up to 7  kev and reveals no significant spectral features .",
    "no structures which could be associated with the bow shock observed in h@xmath82 are found ( see fig .",
    "[ 0437img ] ) .",
    "the combined analysis of the acis and  pspc data rules out a single pl model ( @xmath85 ) , indicating that more components are needed to get a satisfactory combined fit .",
    "a two - component model , pl plus two polar caps of uniform temperature , provides an acceptable fit to the combined data .",
    "however , comparison with the _ euve _ data shows that this model is only marginally acceptable .",
    "in addition , the inferred values of hydrogen column density exceed the values @xmath86@xmath87 @xmath68 derived from independent measurements of the interstellar absorption towards objects in the vicinity of the pulsar ( see zp98 for more details ) .",
    "zp98 suggested that the temperature distribution in a polar cap should be nonuniform because the heat , released by decelerating magnetospheric particles in subphotospheric layers , propagates along the surface out from the small polar areas , where the energy is deposited , and heats a larger area .",
    "they used a two - zone approximation for the polar cap temperature distribution , a hot `` core '' plus a colder `` rim '' .",
    "when applied to the acis data , this model shows that the observed spectrum significantly exceeds the model at @xmath88  kev , i.e. , one more component is required ( fig .",
    "[ 0437spec1 ] ) .",
    "a natural choice for the additional component is a pl . adding the nonthermal component greatly improves the fit ( fig .",

    "the best fitting parameters are @xmath90 mk , @xmath91 mk , @xmath92 km , @xmath93 km , and @xmath84 .",
    "the bolometric luminosity of two polar caps is @xmath94  erg  s@xmath95 , and the pl luminosity in the 0.110  kev band is @xmath96  erg  s@xmath45 @xmath97 .",
    "this model is in good agreement with the _ euve _ data .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     one can assume that the spectral features are associated with ion cyclotron energies , @xmath98 kev , where @xmath99 and @xmath100 are the ion s charge and mass numbers .",
    "the surface magnetic field needed for this interpretation is @xmath101 g , much larger than the conventional magnetic field inferred for a centered dipole from the @xmath102 , @xmath103 measurements . such a strong _ surface _ magnetic field can be consistent with the magnetic moment",
    "@xmath104 g @xmath105 if the magnetic dipole is off - centered to about 3 km below the surface . however , the ion - cyclotron interpretation of the observed features is not straightforward even in this case ( see sanwal et al .",
    "2002b for more details ) .",
    "thus , the most viable possibility is that the observed lines are atomic lines formed in the ns atmosphere .",
    "the features can not be explained as emerging from a hydrogen atmosphere because , at any magnetic field and any reasonable gravitational redshift , there is not a pair of strong hydrogen spectral lines whose energies would match the observed ones .",

( 2002c ) suggest that these are the strongest lines of once - ionized helium in a superstrong magnetic field , ( 1.41.7)@xmath106 g. in this interpretation , the observed line energies correspond to the gravitational redshift @xmath1070.23 , which corresponds to @xmath10814.2 km  @xmath109 . to confirm this result , deep observations with high spectral resolution",
    "are needed .",
    "discovered seven objects which are often called `` dim '' or `` truly isolated '' nss .",

    "their x - ray fluxes , @xmath111@xmath112 erg s@xmath45 @xmath68 , correspond to rather low ( bolometric ) luminosities , @xmath113 erg s@xmath45 for a fiducial distance of 100 pc .",
    "the fluxes do not show variations on either short ( minutes - hours ) or long ( months - years ) time scales , and they are much higher than the optical fluxes , @xmath114 . such properties strongly suggest that these objects are isolated , nearby nss .",
    "rotational periods in j0720.43125 and j1308.8 + 2127 were discovered with  and , respectively ( see refs .  in table  2 ) .",
    "there are also indications on periodicities in j0420.05022 and j0806.44123 , although those periods are to be confirmed yet .",
    "the source powering the thermal radiation of these nss has been a matter of debate ( e.g. , treves et al .",
    "two main options under consideration are the internal heat of a cooling ns and accretion from the interstellar medium ( ism ) . a standard estimate on the luminosity powered by the bondi - hoyle accretion , @xmath115 erg s@xmath45 ( here @xmath116 is the number density of the ism in @xmath117",
    ", @xmath118 is the relative ns velocity in units of 10 km s@xmath45 ) , requires rather low ns velocities .",
    "recent estimates on the distance to j1856.43754 and its proper motion ( see below ) imply a transverse velocity @xmath119 km s@xmath45 .",

    "below we present results from  observations of the most famous ( and best - investigated ) objects of this class , j1856.53754 and j0720.43125 .      this object ( we will call it j1856 throughout this section ) was first observed with  in march 2000 in a 55 ks exposure with the hrc - s / letg instrument .",
    "a detailed analysis of this observation is given by burwitz et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , who reported no detection of any significant features in the high - resolution spectrum .",
    "they also concluded that the combined x - ray and optical data rule out all the available ns atmosphere models : light - element models overpredict the actual optical fluxes ( as first estimated by pavlov et al .",
    "1996 ) , whereas heavy - element models do not fit the letg spectrum . in october 2001",
    "this source was observed for 450 ks , with the same instrument .",
    "however , even this very deep observation revealed no spectral features .",
    "the spectrum excellently fits a blackbody model of @xmath122 mk and @xmath123 km , pc , has been recently established by kaplan et al .",

    "all attempts to find pulsations from j1856 have been unsuccessful so far ( e.g. , ransom et al .  2002 ) .",
    "however , since time resolution of both the  and  data on j1856 was not sufficient to search for periods shorter than @xmath125 ms , one could assume that the period of j1856 is shorter than that .",
    "such a hypothesis might also explain the featureless spectrum of j1856  spectral lines in radiation of a fast - rotating ns can be smeared out because of the doppler effect ( rotational broadening ; see zp02 for more details ) .",
    "however , atmosphere models for a fast - rotating ns fail to fit the detected spectrum because of strong deviations at energies around most prominent absorption edges ( see fig .",
    "[ 1856spec2 ] and fig .  12 in zp02 ) .",
    "thus , we have to admit that the blackbody spectrum is the best model for the x - ray spectrum of j1856 . in principle",
    ", such a blackbody spectrum could mimic the actual spectrum in the relatively short band of 0.151.0 kev if the ns surface is in a condensed form ( according to lai & salpeter 1997 , this can happen if the magnetic field is very strong at the ns surface , @xmath126 g ) .",
    "however , the radius of the emitting area , @xmath1275 km , is too small to be the ns radius .",
    "moreover , taking into consideration the optical fluxes detected from j1856 ( van kerkwijk & kulkarni 2001a ; pons et al .",
    "2002 ) , one encounters one more problem  the extrapolation of the blackbody model inferred from the x - ray data into the optical band falls well below the actually detected fluxes .",
    "one may assume ( pons et al .",
    "2002 ) that the x - ray radiation is emitted from a hot area on the ns surface , while the optical radiation is emitted from the rest of the surface , with a lower temperature .",
    "the optical spectrum is well described by the rayleigh - jeans law ( van kerkwijk & kulkarni 2001a ) and gives the following relation between the temperature and the radius of the ns surface emitting the soft blackbody radiation : @xmath128 km ( with allowance for the contribution of the `` hard blackbody '' ) . on the other hand",
    ", a 3@xmath129 upper limit on the temperature of the soft component , @xmath130 mk , found from the x - ray data , corresponds to a lower limit for the radius @xmath131 km for @xmath132 pc .",
    "figure  [ 1856spec3 ] shows an example of the two - blackbody fit to the optical and x - ray data on j1856 . in this two - temperature picture",
    ", it is tempting to interpret the hot area as a pulsar polar cap .",
    "this seems to be consistent with the recent discovery of the h@xmath82 nebula surrounding j1856 ( van kerkwijk & kulkarni 2001b ) , presumably a bow shock in the ambient medium created by the supersonic motion of a ns with a relativistic ( pulsar ? ) wind .",
    "however , the hot spot is unusually large and luminous [ @xmath133 erg s@xmath45 ] for a standard pulsar polar cap .",
    "this could be explained by a very strong magnetic field localized in the spot region ( i.e. , essentially different from a centered dipole ) .",
    "such a field can quench the pair cascade in the wind of primary particles pulled out from the ns surface , which explains the lack of x - ray / optical synchrotron radiation . on the other hand",
    ", the strong field can increase the heat flux from the core / crust to the surface .",
    "the large size of the hot spot , together with the gr effects ( zp02 ) , can explain the nondetection of pulsations ( pulsed fraction @xmath135 from the  data ) , particularly if the hot spot is close the rotational pole or the direction of the rotational axis is close to the line of sight . if the new observation of j1856 with _",
    "xmm_-newton ( conducted in april 2002 ) reveals pulsations of this objects , it will support the two - temperature interpretation and provide constraints on the magnetic moment , hot spot position and inclination of the rotational axis .",
    "observed this object in february 2000 for 38 ks with the hrc - s / letg instrument .",
    "fitting various spectral models to these data gives results remarkably similar to those for j1856 .",
    "although the light - element ( hydrogen and helium ) ns atmosphere models provide acceptable fits ( but the models are somewhat harder than the observed spectrum at @xmath136 kev ) , the predicted optical fluxes ( e.g. , @xmath137 and 23.3 for the hydrogen and helium nonmagnetic models , respectively ) are much brighter than observed ( @xmath138  see kulkarni & van kerkwijk 1998 ) .",
    "neither iron nor solar - mixture models fit the data because of numerous features in the model spectra .",
    "the best fit is provided by a blackbody model of @xmath139 mk and a radius of the emitting area of @xmath140 km , absorbed with the hydrogen column density @xmath141 @xmath68 ( fig .",
    "[ 0720spec1 ] ) .",
    "however , similar to j1856 , the best blackbody model inferred from the x - ray data underpredicts the optical fluxes which can be interpreted as emitted by a `` soft blackbody '' with @xmath142 km . to obtain an acceptable fit of the two - blackbody model to the x - ray data",
    ", one should keep @xmath143 mk , that results in @xmath144 km .",
    "figure  [ 0720spec2 ] shows an example of the two - blackbody fit to the optical and x - ray data , with @xmath145 mk and @xmath146 km for the soft component . if future optical observations provide the distance to j0720.43125 , it will be possible to evaluate the ns radius and , based on the x - ray light curves , estimate the mass - to - radius ratio",
    "because of the limited space , we described the observational results on only a handful of observed thermally emitting isolated nss .",
    "we only briefly mentioned axps and sgrs , whose x - ray radiation almost certainly contains a thermal component , with temperatures of 510 mk and equivalent radii of 15 km .",
    "the current status of axps , including their comparison with sgrs , is reviewed by s.  mereghetti et al .",
    "( this volume ) . from the observational perspective",
    ", the nature of these enigmatic objects can hardly be understood without deep multiwavelength observations , particularly in the ir and hard x - ray bands , which would help elucidate the origin of the nonthermal component and separate the thermal component more precisely .",
    "we did not touch `` elderly '' nearby pulsars ( e.g. , b192910 , b0950 + 08 ) , mostly because they have not been observed with .",
    "if future deep observations show that their x - ray radiation is indeed thermal ( emitted from hot , small polar caps ) , as suggested by the  and  observations , the analysis of the spectra and light curves will help establish the strength and geometry of their magnetic fields and the ns mass - to - radius ratio .",
    "we did not mention important non - detections of thermal radiation from very young pulsars , the crab ( tennant et al .",
    "2001 ; m.c .",
    "weisskopf , this volume ) and the recently discovered psr j0205 + 6449 in the snr 3c 58 ( slane et al .",
    "2002 ) , which put upper limits on the ns surface temperature .",
    "finally , very interesting results on thermal radiation from transiently accreting nss in quiescence have been reported recently ( rutledge et al .",
    "2001 , and references therein ) .",
    "although these old nss are not truly isolated , their radiation in quiescence resembles that of young isolated nss because of additional heating due to pycnonuclear reactions in the compressed accreted material .",
    "the  observations described above have shown a few important things .",
    "first of all , they left no doubts that thermal emission indeed dominates in the soft x - ray radiation of quite a few isolated nss , and the analysis of this radiation allows one to measure the ns temperatures and , in some cases , the radii or mass - to - radius ratios . particularly important is the conclusion that the simple picture of a ns with a centered dipole magnetic field and uniform surface temperature is , most likely , an oversimplification .",
    "we see that whenever the data allow a detailed analysis , the temperature is not uniform , in both active pulsars and radio - quiet nss .",
    "moreover , the radius of x - ray emitting area is , as a rule , considerably smaller than the `` canonical '' ns radius .",
    "the example of j12105226 ( sec .",
    "3.1 ) shows that the characteristic age ( @xmath74 ) of a pulsar can differ from its true age by a large factor , and the conventional `` pulsar magnetic field '' can be quite different from the actual magnetic field at the ns surface .",
    "therefore , any inferences on the properties of nss and the superdense matter obtained without taking this into account should be considered with caution .",
    "for example , adopting the x - ray emitting radius to be the ns radius , a number of authors hurried to conclude that nss are strange quark stars .",
    "another example is the numerous comparisons of the ns cooling curves with observations of thermal x - rays from pulsars postulating that the pulsar s characteristic age is the true age and the empirical temperature of one of the `` thermal components '' is a single effective temperature .",
    "if we want to understand the real objects , we should abandon the naive paradigm and answer the basic questions raised by the observations : @xmath147 what is the true explanation of the small , hot areas in many , if not all , nss , such as j2323 + 5848 ( cco of cas a ) , rx j1856.53754 , etc ? if these small heated areas are associated not with ( unseen ) pulsar activity , but with superstrong local magnetic fields , how such fields affect the thermal evolution of nss ?",
    "@xmath147 what is the relation between the various kinds of nss  ccos , axps , sgrs , active pulsars , dim nss ?",
    "for instance , why do ccos , axps and sgrs show similar properties of thermal radiation , being so different in the other observational manifestations ?",
    "can it be that the members of different subclasses are intrinsically similar objects at different stages of their evolution ( e.g. , axps are descendants of ccos ) or viewed from different directions ( e.g. , dim nss are usual middle - aged pulsars whose pulsar radiation is not seen because of unfavorable geometry ) ?",
    "@xmath147 what is the actual temperature distribution over the ns surface ? does the two - component model for thermal radiation we have used ( thermal soft + thermal hard ) describe the distribution adequately ? @xmath147 what is the actual mechanism(s ) of the surface emission ? are there any gaseous atmospheres at all ?",
    "why does the blackbody model describes the observed spectra so well in many cases ?",
    "+ these are the questions to be addressed ( and , hopefully , answered ) by future observations of nss .",
