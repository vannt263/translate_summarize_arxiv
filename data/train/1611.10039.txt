    "it is well known that certain migratory birds can use the earth s magnetic field for orientation and navigation . as one of the main hypotheses to explain the magnetic sensing , the rp mechanism @xcite was first proposed in the pioneering work by schulten _ et al_. @xcite . in the rp mechanism",
    ", the spin relaxation should be slow enough , i.e. , the lifetime should be long enough , generally in the order of @xmath0-@xmath1s @xcite , or even @xmath2s @xcite .",
    "several important experiments support this rp mechanism @xcite .",
    "the underlying mechanism in such a rp compass is clearly of quantum mechanical nature , thus to what extent and under what conditions the quantum coherence or entanglement can play a positive role in rp compass has aroused great interest .    in the rp mechanism , due to the optical excitation the molecular conformation changes and the distance between two electrons increases . as a result",
    ", the electron - nuclear hyperfine interaction plays a dominant role instead of the exchange interaction .",
    "the singlet and triplet states are no longer the eigenstates of the rp hamiltonian .",
    "consequently , the singlet - triplet coherence is created and believed to be required for the rp navigation @xcite .",
    "a quantitative connection between the compass sensitivity and the initial global electron - nuclear quantum coherence has been established , i.e. , initial global coherence makes a more dominant contribution to the compass sensitivity as compared with local electronic coherence @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it has been pointed that the entanglement should last long enough to be used for bird s navigation @xcite . and",
    "the interesting connections between the entanglement and the sensitivity of magnetic field intensity have also been found when the rp lifetime is not too long compared with the entanglement lifetime @xcite .",
    "but for the singlet yield anisotropy ( magnetic field direction sensitivity ) , quantum entanglement seems to have no direct contribution to it .",
    "the separable initial states can lead to more singlet yield anisotropy than the initial singlet state @xcite .",
    "hore and his co - workers investigated the relation between compass properties and initial entanglement in detail , and found that it is somewhat complex @xcite .",
    "for example , under certain conditions the initial entangled state can create the significant singlet yield anisotropy , but on the other condition the non - entangled initial states can lead to appreciable anisotropy @xcite . besides the roles of quantum coherence and entanglement , the effects of decoherence on the rp has also been investigated , and it has been found that some kinds of decoherence , can play positive roles in the rp compass @xcite , for example the performance of rp compass can be enhanced by the presence of correlated dephasing @xcite .",
    "we can see that some conclusions above looks inconclusive , or even contradictive and what really determines the orientation , entanglement , coherence or someone else is still an open question .    in the rp mechanism , the hyperfine coupling which induces the singlet - triplet conversion depending on the magnetic field plays an essential role .",
    "the hyperfine interaction depends on the species of the nucleus and its location with respect to the electron wave function . the electron is usually influenced by the environment , and then the hyperfine coupling strength is not a constant but might fluctuate . besides , there is ubiquitous external magnetic noise around the avian compass .",
    "so it is very important to investigate the effects of these noises on the rp navigation .    in this paper",
    "we investigate who determines the singlet yield , entanglement , coherence or someone else .",
    "we should note that quantifying coherence should be in a specific basis @xcite , and we find that the dark states of teze play a very important role in the rp compass .",
    "we define the quantum coherence in this dark state basis , and investigate its contribution to the singlet yield anisotropy .",
    "we prove that the dynamical process of the rp is an incoherent and local operation which can not create any coherence of the dark state of teze as well as any entanglement .",
    "furthermore , we respectively calculate the singlet yields for two initial states : the coherent state ( in the dark state basis ) and the same state just removing the dark state coherence with the dark state population being preserved . for the later there are neither dark state coherence nor entanglement in the whole dynamical process .",
    "surprisingly we find that in both cases the singlet yields are the same , and based on this result , we believe that the dark state population determines the singlet yield completely , and the dark state coherence and entanglement have little contribution to the singlet yield .    also , we investigate the effects of hyperfine coupling noise and the magnetic noise on the singlet yield anisotropy . although these noises are all inducing decoherence , their effects on the singlet yield anisotropy are significant different .",
    "the dark state population as well as the singlet yield anisotropy , is very fragile to the vertical magnetic noise , but is robust to and is even enhanced by the parallel magnetic noise . as for the hyperfine coupling noise ,",
    "we find that the dark state population is very robust to the hyperfine noise , so that the orientation is very robust to the hyperfine noise .",
    "the rp compass consists of two electronic spins coupled to an external magnetic field , and one of them interacts with the nuclei around it and the other is devoid of the hyperfine interaction .",
    "the hyperfine interaction provides asymmetry and leads to singlet - triplet transition required for the direction sensitivity .",
    "this model is verified by the rps @xmath3 $ ] @xcite and @xmath4 $ ] @xcite .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian is @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the nuclear spin operator , and @xmath7 is the anisotropic hyperfine tensor with a diagonal form @xmath8 . and we consider an axially symmetric molecule , i.e. , @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 are the electronic spin operators ( @xmath11 ) , and @xmath12 is the gyromagnetic ratio , with @xmath13 being the bohr magneton and @xmath14 being the @xmath15-factor of the electron .",
    "@xmath16 is the external magnetic field around the rp : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the intensity of the earth s magnetic field , and @xmath19 and @xmath20 describe its orientation to the basis of the hyperfine interaction tensor . due to the axial symmetry of the hyperfine tensor we set @xmath21 and focus on @xmath22 $ ] without loss of generality",
    "this is supported by the experiment that the avian compass does not depend on the polarity of magnetic field but only on its inclination @xcite .",
    "we consider the same singlet and triplet recombination rates , i.e. , @xmath23 , and in this case , the singlet yield can be calculated as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the radical recombination probability distribution @xcite , and @xmath26 is the population of the singlet state @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28 $ ] is the reduced electronic spin state at time @xmath29 with the partial trace over the nuclear subspace , where @xmath30 $ ] is the evolution operator .",
    "it has been shown in different scenarios that @xmath31 should the order of @xmath32 , @xcite so in this paper we let @xmath33 .",
    "the nuclei are initially in a completely mixed state , i.e. , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 is the total number of the nuclei , and @xmath36 is the basis of the nuclear environment .",
    "generally we suppose that the electronic spins are initially in the singlet state @xmath27 unless otherwise specified .    through our calculation",
    "we find that the dark states ( the corresponding eigenvalues are zero ) of teze ( the first term of eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) ) play an important role in the rp model . defining @xmath37 teze can be expressed as @xmath38 the eigenvectors of @xmath39 are as follows : @xmath40 with the eigenvalues 0 , 0 , 2 , -2 , respectively .",
    "@xmath41 , @xmath42 are the eigenvectors of @xmath43 ( @xmath11 ) with the corresponding eigenvalues @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively . @xmath46 and @xmath47 . obviously , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the dark states of @xmath50 and @xmath39 , and @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the bright states . from eq .",
    "( [ dark state ] ) it can be seen that the dark states and the bright states are all product states , and have no any correlation between the two electrons .",
    "the singlet state @xmath27 is invariant to rotations in the electron spin space , meaning that it is isotropic @xcite . so that the singlet state can be expressed as @xmath53 which only depends on the dark states .",
    "thus the singlet state population can be divided into two parts , i.e. , @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 we define @xmath57 and @xmath58 as the dark state coherence and population at time @xmath29 , respectively , whose contributions to the singlet yield are : @xmath59 @xmath60 obviously , @xmath61 .",
    "the essential of the orientation is the singlet yield anisotropy , i.e. , the singlet yield @xmath62 is different for different @xmath19 .",
    "we firstly consider a simple case that only the vertical hyperfine coupling is considered , i.e. , @xmath63 .",
    "the nuclear spins can then be treated as inducing an effective magnetic field ( depending on their initial states ) for the electron spin .",
    "although this model is very simple , the basic physical process for the magnetoreception holds .",
    "and such a simple model allows us to obtain analytic results which are quite useful for understanding the essential effects of the dark state coherence and population .",
    "now we consider the most basic rp model that there is only one nucleus around the electron , i.e. , @xmath64 ( the multi - nuclei rp model is discussed in appendix a ) .",

    "2 . from fig .",
    "2(a ) we can see that if the vertical magnetic noise is approximately equal to or larger than @xmath158 , the singlet yield profile flattens out and thus the magnetic sensitivity is destroyed completely . because @xmath159 , @xmath160 , @xmath161 and @xmath162 , the noise only decays @xmath163 , @xmath164 , @xmath165 and @xmath166 .",

    "this can be understood as follows .",
    "when @xmath225 , two electrons are only influenced by the geomagnetic field , and there is no hyperfine interaction to induce the transition between the singlet and triplet states .",

    "it is noted that @xmath93 is decreasing with the increasing @xmath35 , and for a sufficiently large @xmath35 the singlet yield which comes from the dark state coherence will disappear .",

    "that is to say , the magnetic sensitivity for even nuclear number is also determined completely by the dark state population .",
    "there are two important experimental results which strongly support the rp model .",
    "one is that the birds are able to  train \" to different field strengths : if the field intensity changes in a suitable regime , for example the field intensity is increased or decreased by about @xmath238 of the local geomagnetic field , the birds will disorient temporarily but rework after a sufficiently long time to adapt themselves @xcite .",
    "the other is that a very weak oscillating field ( generally 150nt or even 15nt ) whose frequency is resonant with the electron spin larmor frequency in the geomagnetic field can disorient the birds completely .",
    "but if the oscillatory frequency is detuning from the larmor frequency , the birds can not be disoriented @xcite .",
    "now we investigate the influences of the field intensities and the weak oscillating field on the singlet yield from the point of view of the dark state population one by one . for simplicity",
    ", we only consider the single - nucleus rp model .",
    "firstly we investigate the effect of the field intensity .",
    "for relatively strong hyperfine coupling , we can expand @xmath239 and @xmath240 by @xmath241 , and @xmath58 ( see eq .",

    "( [ phip3 ] ) ) .",
    "the change of the field intensity , for example increasing or decreasing by about @xmath238 of the local geomagnetic field , will induce the change of the singlet yield , so that it disorients the bird transiently . but from eq .",
    "( [ phip3 ] ) it can be seen that the singlet yield is mainly determined by @xmath244 which decreases monotonously with @xmath19 . and only the second order of @xmath241 influences @xmath94 ( or @xmath58 ) .",
    "although changing the field intensity will change the singlet yield , the monotonicity will be preserved .",
    "this monotonicity preservation ensures that the bird reworks after a sufficiently long time to adapt itself .",
    "when we consider the horizontal hyperfine interaction @xmath97 and @xmath96 , we numerically calculate the singlet yield for different magnetic fields as shown in fig . a2 . from fig .",
    "a2 we can see that for different fields @xmath94 always coincides with @xmath62 along different directions , which means that the dark state population determines the singlet yield completely .",
    "we also find that @xmath94 ( @xmath62 ) for different field intensities decreases monotonously with the direction angle and the @xmath238 weaker ( @xmath245 ) and stronger ( @xmath246 ) fields influence the angular profile evidently .",
    "the changes of the angular profile means that the birds will disorient if the field intensity changes suddenly , but the preservation of the monotonicity ensures that the bird can reorient after a long time to adapt itself .",
    "next we investigate the influence of the weak oscillating field : @xmath247 where @xmath248 is the strength of the additional oscillating field with frequency @xmath249 , and @xmath250 and @xmath251 give the direction of the oscillating field . due to the axial symmetry of the hyperfine interaction tensor we set @xmath252 , and only focus on @xmath253 , i.e. , the radio frequency field is orthogonal to the geomagnetic field .",
    "when we only consider the vertical hyperfine coupling , using the time - dependent perturbation theory @xcite , we can obtain : @xmath254 substituting eq .",

    "( [ fprf ] ) ) , so that destroys the singlet yield anisotropy , and disorients the bird completely . when we consider the horizontal hyperfine coupling @xmath97 and @xmath96 , we numerically calculate the singlet yield under the influence of the oscillating field as shown in fig .",
    "it can be seen that under the influence of the oscillating field , @xmath94 coincides with @xmath62 and flattens out .",
    "@xmath94 coincides with @xmath62 means that the singlet yield is still completely determined by the dark state population , and the angular profile flattens out means that under the influence of the resonant radio frequency field the bird can not distinguish different directions @xmath19 and disorients completely .",
    "recently , hogben et al . has pointed out that the singlet yield anisotropy ( the singlet yield is different for different @xmath19 ) , is essential to the magnetic sensitivity , which not only can come from the anisotropic hyperfine interaction but also can come from the anisotropic initial state @xcite .",
    "more specifically , if the initial state is isotropic ( for example the singlet state @xmath27 ) , the anisotropic hyperfine interaction ( @xmath102 ) can induce the singlet yield anisotropy ; and if the hyperfine interaction is isotropic ( @xmath103 ) , the anisotropic initial state ( for example the triplet state @xmath104 ) can also induce the yield anisotropy .",
    "the singlet yield anisotropy induced by the anisotropic hyperfine interaction has been investigated in the main text and in appendix a. for the case that the singlet yield anisotropy is induced by the anisotropic initial state , whether the singlet yield is still completely determined by the dark state population needs to be discussed .",
    "let two electrons be initially in the triplet state @xmath104 and the hyperfine tensors for single - nucleus and multi - nuclei rps are @xmath256 and @xmath257 for all @xmath192 , respectively .",
    "we numerically calculate the singlet yields for different nuclear number and show the results in fig . a4 . as shown in fig .",
    "a4 for the single - nucleus rp , @xmath94 always coincides with @xmath62 and @xmath93 is always zero for different @xmath19 . for the multi - nuclei rp model ,",
    "if the nuclear number is odd , @xmath94 is also coincident with @xmath62 and @xmath93 is always zero .",
    "if the nuclear number is even , there is a little difference between @xmath94 and @xmath62 . through our numerical calculation",
    "we find that @xmath94 is approaching @xmath62 and @xmath93 is close to zero as @xmath35 is increasing . in one word",
    "the magnetic sensitivity for the anisotropic initial state and isotropic hyperfine interaction is also determined completely by the dark state population .",
    "we also consider other initial states and other hyperfine tensors , and find that the magnetic sensitivity is always determined by the dark state population .",
