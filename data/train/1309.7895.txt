    "unlike helium , bulk molecular para - hydrogen ( p - h@xmath0 ) always solidifies if a sufficiently low temperature is reached  @xcite .",
    "intermolecular h@xmath0-h@xmath0 interactions are attractive and quite intense hence , even though hydrogen molecules are lighter than @xmath2he atoms , p - h@xmath0 crystallization is energetically favoured over melting in the @xmath3 limit frustrating so any possibility to observe superfluidity ( sf ) or bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in bulk . putting this into numbers ,",
    "molecular hydrogen becomes a solid at temperatures below @xmath4  k whereas the critical temperature at which bec and sf are expected to occur is @xmath5  k  @xcite . in spite of that , many experimental attempts have focused on supercooling bulk liquid p - h@xmath0 below @xmath6 , although unfortunately with no apparent success to date  @xcite .    a likely way to induce superfluidity in molecular hydrogen",
    "consists in lowering its melting temperature by reducing its dimensionality and/or confining it to restricted geometries . following this line of thinking",
    "many experimental and theoretical studies have focused on the characterization and analysis of p - h@xmath0 films adsorbed on different substrates  @xcite .",
    "for instance , two - dimensional hydrogen has been observed to freeze at temperatures around @xmath7  k when placed onto an exfoliated graphite plate  @xcite .",
    "also , it has been experimentally shown that small para - hydrogen clusters immersed in @xmath2he droplets exhibit superfluid - like behaviour  @xcite . on the theoretical side , it has been predicted that one - dimensional arrays of p - h@xmath0 molecules remain in the liquid phase down to absolute zero  @xcite and that small two- and three - dimensional clusters of pure p - h@xmath0 are superfluid at temperatures below @xmath8  k  @xcite .",
    "an alternative way to induce superfluidity in molecular para - hydrogen may consist in embedding alkali metal ( am ) atoms on it .",
    "this idea was originally proposed by gordillo and ceperley ( gc )  @xcite and is based on the fact that the interactions between alkali metal atoms and molecular hydrogen are less attractive than between p - h@xmath0 molecules . therefore , a substantial reduction of the equilibrium hydrogen density can be induced which triggers stabilization of the liquid . in particular , gc investigated two - dimensional am - h@xmath0 ( am = k and cs ) systems at low temperatures ( i.e. , @xmath9  k ) employing the path integral monte carlo ( pimc ) technique .",
    "they found that the p - h@xmath0 equilibrium state in am - h@xmath0 films was a liquid of concentration @xmath10  @xmath11 which became superfluid at temperatures below @xmath12  k. nevertheless , few years later boninsegni  @xcite found , using a very similar approach to gc and attempting extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit , that the hydrogen equilibrium state in k - h@xmath0 films was a crystal commensurate with the underlying lattice of alkali atoms .",
    "the superfluid fraction of such a commensurate system was equal to zero as reported by boninsegni . almost simultaneously to the publication of boninsegni s work  @xcite , cazorla and boronat presented a ground - state study ( i.e. , performed at zero temperature ) of a two - dimensional system composed of rb atoms and hydrogen molecules  @xcite . by using the diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) method and somewhat more realistic am - h@xmath0 potentials than adopted by gc and boninsegni",
    ", they found that the p - h@xmath0 ground - state in the rb - h@xmath0 film was a highly structured liquid with a practically suppressed superfluid fraction of @xmath13 .",
    "overall , these theoretical predictions appeared to suggest that the embedding of alkali metal atoms on hydrogen matrices was not an effective strategy to trigger p - h@xmath0 superfluidity .    in this work ,",
    "we report an exhaustive diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) study of the ground - state properties ( i.e. , energetic , structural and superfluid ) of p - h@xmath0 molecules within a two - dimensional solid matrix of sodium ( na ) atoms .",
    "our main finding is that the p - h@xmath0 ground - state is a liquid that possesses a remarkably large superfluid fraction of @xmath1 .",
    "the reason behind such a large superfluid response lies on the details of the na - h@xmath0 interaction , which presents a smaller repulsive core as compared to other am - h@xmath0 pairwise potentials .",
    "the organization of this article is as follows . in the next section",
    "we provide a brief description of the dmc method and the details of our calculations .",

    "the internal structure of p - h@xmath0 molecules has been neglected ( i.e. , vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom are disregarded ) and the hydrogen - hydrogen molecular interactions have been modeled with the standard silvera - goldman potential  @xcite . the interactions between na atoms and h@xmath0 molecules are described with a lennard - jones potential of the form @xmath27 $ ] , with parameters taken from ref .",

    "these large total energy and equilibrium density differences have their origin in the potential energy gain and steric effects deriving from the presence of sodium atoms . also , we observe that the equilibrium density of the liquid h@xmath0 film is appreciably larger than the calculated in the analogous rb - h@xmath0 system , namely @xmath63  @xmath11  @xcite ( e.g. , the ratio among the number of p - h@xmath0 molecules and alkali metal atoms are @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively ) . the cause for the large equilibrium density in the na case , as compared to that of the rb system , is related to the decrease of the core size of the am - h@xmath0 interaction ( i.e. , @xmath78     in the rb - h@xmath0 case ) , which makes the surface available to p - h@xmath0 molecules larger ( we note that the depth of the potential wells , @xmath79 , in both na - h@xmath0 and rb - h@xmath0 interactions are very similar , i.e. , @xmath51 and @xmath80  k respectively  @xcite ) .    regarding the stabilization of possible _",

    "nevertheless , the total energy per particle of the @xmath85 phase is about @xmath87  k larger than the energy of the corresponding fluid at equilibrium and thus , according to our calculations , the ground - state of the na - h@xmath0 system is a liquid . in view of these findings , we will concentrate on the description of the liquid h@xmath0 system in the remainder of this article .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we show a snapshot of the probability density calculated for the ground - state of the na - h@xmath0 system .",
    "there it is observed that hydrogen molecules can access a large portion of the surface left between na atoms by diffusing through honeycomb - like pathways created around the alkali metal centers .",

    "@xcite and fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "in this last case , most of p - h@xmath0 molecules are localized within the interior of the triangles formed by rb atoms and the connectivity between high - density p - h@xmath0 regions is rather low .",

    "these last features are in opposition to what is observed in the rb - h@xmath0 film , where the first and second @xmath90 peaks centered at @xmath93 and @xmath94     can be ascribed to the hexagonal - like pattern that results from filling the triangles formed by rb atoms with one p - h@xmath0 molecule",

    "peaks ascribed to the periodicity of the underlying sodium film are indicated with arrows . ]    in order to better assess the structure of the p - h@xmath0 molecules in the na film , we calculated the corresponding structure factor , @xmath95 , shown in fig .",
    "there , one can observe the presence of two sharp peaks centered at reciprocal lattice vectors that essentially coincide with the periodicity imposed by the triangular na lattice ( i.e. , at @xmath96 and @xmath97  @xmath58 ) .",

    "it is worth recalling that the superfluid fraction computed in the equivalent rb - h@xmath0 system was much smaller , namely @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "this significant @xmath101 difference is a direct consequence of the increase in the p - h@xmath0 concentration at equilibrium , which in turn depends on the form of the am - h@xmath0 interaction .",
    "furthermore , we calculated the superfluid response of the na - h@xmath0 film at a density slightly above the equilibrium point ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) and found that the value of the @xmath102 asymptote decreases ( i.e. , @xmath108 at @xmath109  @xmath11 ) .",
    "this last finding points out to a strong dependence of the superfluid fraction on @xmath110 due to the effect of excluding surface produced by the presence of static na atoms .",
    "we note that the finite size of the simulation box could induce some dependence of the superfluid fraction on the number of particles . in order to reduce this effect , however , we worked out with a rather large simulation box of typical size @xmath52  @xmath53     ( i.e. , as large as the one employed in ref .",

    "superfluid density in na films at different densities . ]    in the light of our energy , structural and superfluid fraction results obtained in alkali - h@xmath0 films ( see work  @xcite ) it may be concluded that ( i )  the softer the repulsive core of the crossed am - h@xmath0 interaction is , the larger the p - h@xmath0 equilibrium density and superfluid fraction result , and ( ii )  the superfluid response of two - dimensional p - h@xmath0 films strongly depends on density .",
    "summarizing , we have performed an exhaustive diffusion monte carlo study of the energetic , structural and superfluid properties of a p - h@xmath0 two - dimensional system in which na atoms have been embedded forming a triangular lattice .",
    "the main motivation of this computational study was to investigate whether hydrogen crystallization could be prevented in two dimensions and , if so , to estimate the superfluid response of the corresponding p - h@xmath0 sub - system at zero - temperature .",
    "we have found , in contrast to previous computational works considering other alkali metal species and am - h@xmath0 potentials , that the p - h@xmath0 ground - state in the na film is a liquid that possesses a remarkably large superfluid fraction ( i.e. , @xmath1 ) .",
    "the principal reason behind the stabilization of this fluid relies on the fact that na - h@xmath0 interactions are less attractive than h@xmath0-h@xmath0 and thus a significant reduction of the hydrogen equilibrium density occurs .",
    "also , we have found that the energetic , structural and superfluid properties of p - h@xmath0 films strongly depend on density .",
    "importantly , we note that small variations of the crossed am - h@xmath0 potential parameters may lead to appreaciable differences on the computed p - h@xmath0 properties . therefore , since there are few potentials in the literature which describe the interactions between alkali metal atoms and p - h@xmath0 molecules accurately , and those which have been reported probably are not too versatile , we must be cautious at our conclusions .",
    "more realistic and transferable alkali - h@xmath0 potentials than currently available are urgently needed to provide decisive hints in the quest for realizing p - h@xmath0 superfluidity .",
    "nevertheless , in view of the great fundamental interest of possible p - h@xmath0 superfluidity we strongly encourage experimental realizations of molecular hydrogen films adsorbed on na substrates .",

    "<S> we theoretically investigate the ground - state properties of a molecular para - hydrogen ( p - h@xmath0 ) film in which crystallization is energetically frustrated by embedding sodium ( na ) atoms periodically distributed in a triangular lattice . in order to fully deal with the quantum nature of p - h@xmath0 molecules , </S>",
    "<S> we employ the diffusion monte carlo method and realistic semi - empirical pairwise potentials describing the interactions between h@xmath0-h@xmath0 and na - h@xmath0 species . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we calculate the energetic , structural and superfluid properties of two - dimensional na - h@xmath0 systems within a narrow density interval around equilibrium at zero temperature . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to previous computational studies considering other alkali metal species such as rubidium and potassium , we find that the p - h@xmath0 ground - state is a liquid with a significantly large superfluid fraction of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the appearance of p - h@xmath0 superfluid response is due to the fact that the interactions between na atoms and h@xmath0 molecules are less attractive than between h@xmath0 molecules . </S>",
    "<S> this induces a considerable reduction of the hydrogen density which favours the stabilization of the liquid phase . </S>"
