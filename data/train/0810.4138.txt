    "the possibility of explaining all fundamental interactions in nature in a unified framework is one of the main motivations for considering physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics . in this respect ,",
    "grand unified theories ( guts ) are one of the most appealing sm extensions , as they may allow one to understand the origin of the sm interactions and predict both the quantization of the electric charge and the weak mixing angle  @xcite . in these theories",
    "the unification of gauge couplings is realized at a scale @xmath3 gev .",
    "the unification of the matter fields implies the decay of the lightest baryon , the proton  @xcite , and the generic existence of scalar and vector leptoquarks ( denoted by lq unless specified otherwise )  @xcite that carry both lepton- and baryon - numbers , since the quarks and leptons live in the same enlarged representation of the gauge group .",
    "because of the important role played by lqs in guts and other sm extensions as well as their unique phenomenological features , the general properties and phenomenology of lqs have been studied extensively@xcite .",
    "recently , a simple gut based on the su(5 ) gauge symmetry that contains light lqs has been proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this theory ,",
    "the higgs sector is composed of @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 ; neutrino masses are generated through the type ii seesaw mechanism  @xcite ; and there exist light scalar leptoquarks consistent with the constraints from the gauge coupling unification and experimental lower bounds on the proton lifetime .",
    "a distinctive feature of this framework is that the lq - matter yukawa interactions are governed by the neutrino mass matrix .",
    "consequently , different scenarios for the light neutrino mass hierarchy lead to broadly distinguishable patterns for lq interactions with matter . in this paper",
    ", we explore this phenomenology in detail , concentrating in particular on its implications for studies at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .    while several phenomenological and cosmological aspects of this proposal were studied in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite , a comprehensive analysis of the corresponding lq collider phenomenology has not appeared previously in the literature .",
    "here , we report the results of such an analysis . in doing so , we consider the constraints on the model implied by the results of neutrino oscillation experiments , searches for charged lepton flavor violation , and studies of sm - suppressed meson decays .",
    "we find that although the constraints from low - energy flavor physics are severe , they do not preclude the possibility of observing a statistically significant lq signal at the lhc if the lq mass is sufficiently heavy .",
    "the constraints from electroweak precision observables ( ewpo ) have a marginal impact at best on the lhc discovery potential of the model .    in searching for the lq at the lhc",
    ", we identify the dominant production mechanisms and the experimentally fully reconstructable clean final states .",
    "we find that the  golden signals \" for lq discovery are the qcd pair production of the charge @xmath7 lq ( denoted @xmath8 ) , with its decays to a charged lepton plus a down - type quark ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) . after applying a series of judicious cuts to suppress sm backgrounds that would produce the same final state",
    ", we find that one could expect on the order of 1000 events with 100 fb@xmath11 integrated luminosity for a 400@xmath12600 gev lq . by examining the lepton flavor structure of the observed events",
    ", one could further test the model prediction for the neutrino mass spectrum . in particular , @xmath1-flavor tagging will be useful in helping to distinguish the neutrino mass pattern and to probe an unknown majorana phase in the  inverted hierarchy \" or the  quasi - degenerate \" scenario . assuming that one will have knowledge of the neutrino mass spectrum in the near future , obtained from either searches for neutrinoless double @xmath13-decay or future long baseline neutrino oscillation studies , the possible collider discovery analyzed here would not only provide a crucial consistency check for the neutrino mass pattern , but",
    "also indicate a neutrino mass generation mechanism at a fundamental level .    our study is organized in the remainder of the paper as follows : in section ii we present the properties of the lqs in the model . in section",
    "iii the constraints on the physical couplings and parameters coming from neutrino oscillation experiments , rare processes and ewpo are investigated .",
    "the predictions for leptoquarks decays are discussed in section iv .",
    "taking into account the effects of neutrino mass and mixing we show the unique predictions for the branching fractions of all leptonic decays @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the impact of the majorana phases is also studied .",
    "the pair and associated production mechanisms , cuts necessary for sm background suppression , and the signal observability at the lhc are investigated in section v. we summarize our results in section vi .",
    "a general classification of the properties of leptoquarks can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", we concentrate on the specific model realization of ref .  @xcite that consists of a simple realistic extension of the georgi - glashow model  @xcite in which the light neutrino masses are generated through the type ii seesaw mechanism . the higgs sector of this model",
    "is composed of @xmath4 , @xmath6 and @xmath5 , and the matter fields live in the @xmath16 and @xmath17 representations , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 . as emphasized in section [ sec : intro ] , one of the main features of this gut is the possibility of having light leptoquarks consistent with all constraints coming from the proton lifetime and the unification of gauge couplings  @xcite . here , we focus on the properties of these light scalar leptoquarks @xmath20 the electric charges of the leptoquarks are @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "the lq @xmath23 lives in the @xmath5 representation together with @xmath24 , the scalar triplet field responsible for implementing the type ii seesaw mechanism . using the interactions in the model  @xcite",

    "it is important to notice that the @xmath0 symmetry of the theory implies that the coupling of the leptoquark to matter is defined by the mass matrix for neutrinos @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the vacuum expectation value of the neutral component of the field @xmath29 . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite the leptoquark @xmath23 has negative ( positive ) contribution to @xmath30 @xmath31 , where @xmath32 stands for the different beta function coefficients for the three sm gauge groups .",
    "therefore , the presence of this field helps to achieve unification without supersymmetry . if the lq mass lies in the range of 100 gev@xmath121 tev , one obtains gauge coupling unification in agreement with experimental observations at the low energies .",
