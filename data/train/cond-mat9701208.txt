    "upon doping of the superconducting cuprates , one distinguishes an under- and overdoped regime .",
    "optimum doping defines the unique point in the phase diagram where the critical temperature , @xmath4 , is at a maximum .",
    "the superconducting phase of @xmath1 exhibits a broad but well defined maximum of @xmath4 in the oxygen concentration range @xmath6 @xcite . from @xmath4 @xmath7 @xmath2 of",
    "homogeneously oxidized powder samples @xcite we read the maximum @xmath8 k is at @xmath9 .",
    "optimum doped @xmath10 contrasts with its under- and overdoped neighbours not only by the relatively highest @xmath4 , but also by the narrowest width in the superconducting transition ( in the electrical resistance , magnetization , specific heat ) , and the largest superconducting volume fraction .",
    "moreover , at @xmath11 the anisotropy ratio of all electrical and magnetic properties is largest and the normal @xmath12-@xmath13 resistivity most linear in temperature .",
    "it is generally believed that the maximum of @xmath4 is related to a critical concentration of charge carriers in the @xmath14 planes , @xmath15 holes / cu , which may be related to an optimum superconducting condensate density @xmath16 at zero temperature .",
    "( @xmath17 is the effective mass of the superconducting carriers in @xmath18 direction . ) at optimum doping @xmath19 .",
    "it is important to note that the oxygen isotope shift is smallest at optimum doping @xcite .",
    "measurements of the electrical resistivity under high pressure on @xmath1 has also established a vanishing pressure dependence of @xmath4 , @xmath20 k / kbar @xcite . from the currently available experimental data , @xmath21 turns out to be the family of cuprate superconductors where optimum doping is most precisely characterized .",
    "the other families of cuprate superconductors have been well defined in their under- and overdoped regimes , but as yet optimum doping could not be determined with the same accuracy as in @xmath1 .",
    "carrier concentration is a key variable influencing @xmath4 , but in the various compound families , control of the carrier concentration in the @xmath14 planes is achieved in a multi parameter space of cation and anion concentrations . at fixed compositions of the dopants ,",
    "ordering of the inherent defects has been established as playing an important role in the variation of @xmath4 . even in the structurally `` simple '' compound @xmath22 optimum",
    "doping is not completely understood .",
    "for instance , @xmath22 exhibits the maximum @xmath4 ( 38 k ) at @xmath2=0.15 , however , application of pressure may enhance @xmath4 at just this concentration up to 49 k. we believe a key for understanding of the narrow range of stoichiometries which allows for optimum doping is in the ordering of the inherent defect structures .",
    "the optimum doped superconducting phases have intermediate carrier concentrations with respect to the insulating ( antiferromagnetic ) parent phases and the overdoped nonsuperconducting metallic phases .",
    "it is an important indication that just these intermediate carrier concentrations are most favourable for the superconductivity .",
    "an exceptionally detailed picture of the role of defects in a high-@xmath4 material emerged from the numerous detailed studies of oxygen vacancies in the chain layer of underdoped @xmath1 , @xmath23 . for a given @xmath2 , the highest @xmath4",
    "is generally found for samples annealed so that the interstitial oxygen o4 in the chain layer is well ordered .",
    "the oxygen ordering is manifested as dramatic increases in @xmath4 with time in samples that have been quenched from high temperature .",
    "alternatively , application of external pressure to underdoped @xmath1 may be used to affect the ordering - disordering of the chain oxygens .",
    "note that ordered defects are not defects at all ; instead they have become part of the regular lattice , @xmath24 the so - called 2@xmath12 ortho - ii superstructure , @xcite .",
    "but many defects remain after the chain oxygen becomes well ordered creating local lattice distortions .",
    "for instance , the copper - oxygen chains are not straight but zigzagged , and the oxygen displacements associated with this distortion are not ordered in three dimensions .",
    "it is important to note that even the @xmath14 planes , generally believed to be structurally most perfect , are locally distorted by the atomically defined dopant sites located in the nearest or next nearest layers .",
    "are there specific configurations of ordered distortions , which are most favourable for the superconductivity , and which stabilize the compound at optimum doping ? to elucidate this problem , experimentally homogeneously oxidized samples and precision measurements of their oxygen concentrations are necessary prerequisites .",
    "the overdoped regime exhibits further intriguing properties .",
    "the jump in the specific heat at @xmath4 , @xmath25 saturates for @xmath26 . compared to underdoped @xmath27 it is enhanced by a factor of three @xcite . at @xmath28 new features show up in the shapes of the specific heat jumps and of the magnetization .",
    "these are interpreted as a double superconducting transition with @xmath29 split by 3 k @xcite .",
    "the splitting can not be explained by macroscopic oxygen inhomogeneities in the grains @xcite .",
    "overdoping tends to supress the superconducting properties , to dramatically reduce the anisotropy ratio of the normal electric transport properties , and to cause the normal resistivity to evolve a power law dependence .",
    "x - ray and neutron diffraction data recorded as a function of oxygen concentration at 5 k exhibit clear structural anomalies at @xmath30 @xcite . further insertion of oxygen was found to invert the @xmath2-dependency of the @xmath5 lattice parameter .",
    "the spacing between the oxygen and copper layers in the @xmath14 plane , @xmath31 , drops at @xmath32 by 0.02 @xmath33 . recently",
    "the in - phase raman mode of the planar oxygens , o2,3 , was found to soften in the overdoped regime @xcite .    in this lecture",
    ", we address the problem of local structural distortions in the @xmath14 planes around optimum doping in @xmath1 , @xmath2=6.801 - 6.984 , by measurements of the extended x - ray absorption - fine - structure ( exafs ) beyond the yttrium @xmath0-edge , both , as a function of oxygen concentration , @xmath2=6.801 - 6.984 , and of temperature @xmath3=20 - 300 k.",
    "the x - ray absorption - fine - structure beyond the x - ray absorption thresholds of atoms in solids arises from the interference between freely propagating photoelectrons and photoelectrons backscattered from the atomic cluster to the absorbing central atom .",
    "x - ray photons are used for generating exafs spectra , but it is interfering photoelectrons which give the oscillating absorption pattern used for the analysis of the local structure . since electrons are strongly scattered by atoms , exafs is a very sensitive structural probe , but exhibits strong contributions from complicated multiple scattering ( ms ) . however , strong ms signals are of great advantage for the detection atomic cluster projected from the unit cell of @xmath34 .",
