    "a 47@xmath4 significant pentaquark with a mass of @xmath51540mev@xmath0 decaying to @xmath1 or @xmath6 has been reported by ten experiments@xmath7.combining the mass measurements of these experiments we find @xmath8mev@xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath9 for this averaging is @xmath10 giving a confidence level of @xmath11 , a 5.2@xmath4 problem .",
    "pentaquarks with two strange quarks@xcite and with a charm quark@xcite have also been reported .",

    "16 silicon strip planes provide vertexing and tracking .",
    "charged particles are tracked and momentum analyzed as they pass through up to two dipole magnets and up to five sets of multiwire proportional chambers .",
    "three erenkov counters , two em calorimeters , and two muon detectors identify particles . a hadronic trigger requiring @xmath525gev of energy passed 7 billion events for reconstruction .",
    "thus , these events are well above threshold for pentaquark production .",
    "charge conjugates are assumed for these analyses and all pentaquarks are assumed to decay strongly .",
    "we search for @xmath13 and measure the production relative to two similar decays , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the data is from events with a reconstructed @xmath16 or @xmath17@xcite . selecting vee candidates within @xmath18 of the nominal mass we obtain @xmath19 @xmath20 ( @xmath21 @xmath22 ) candidates with 92% ( 96% ) purity .",
    "the remaining good quality tracks must form a good vertex ( cl @xmath23 1%).the proton candidate must pass stringent erenkov i d cuts , reducing the misidentification rate to @xmath50 .",

    "we obtain 95% cl limits on the yield by determing how much the fitted yield must be increased to change the log - likelihood by 1.92 ( continually minimizing the background parameters ) .",
    "this procedure is performed with a breit - wigner width of @xmath33 and 15mev@xmath0 , both with gaussian resolution varying from 2.363.07mev@xmath0 .",
    "the maximum limit on the yield over the mass range 1.511.56gev@xmath0 is 754 ( 2252 ) for @xmath34 of 0 ( 15 ) mev@xmath0 . to set cross section limits we generate pentaquarks the same as @xmath30 . using pythia production and focus mc simulation of @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath35 events",
