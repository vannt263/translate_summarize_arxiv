    "the observation of extrasolar planets around stars of all types has increased interest in characterizing planetary atmospheres through climate modeling .",
    "these include general circulation model ( gcm ) simulations of atmospheric circulation on large , jupiter - sized planets in close orbit to their parent star known as  hot jupiters \" @xcite , as well as consideration of smaller , neptune - sized gas giants and earth - sized terrestrial planets @xcite .",

    "( note that radiative and gcm studies also were conducted for the suspected planets gliese 581d @xcite and gliese 581 g @xcite , which have now been determined to be artifacts due to stellar activity @xcite . )",
    "these modeling studies help to identify prominent circulation features in the atmospheres of extrasolar planets and characterize the types of atmospheres that could exist in orbit around distant stars    one way to characterize planetary habitability is the liquid water habitable zone @xcite , which describes the region around a star where a planet could sustain surface liquid water .",
    "this habitable zone defines a region where the negative climate feedback of the carbonate - silicate cycle @xcite can keep a planet above freezing .",
    "it is bounded on the inner edge by the loss of water through initiation of a runaway greenhouse effect @xcite and on the outer edge by the condensation of carbon dioxide @xcite .",
    "although this habitable zone can not be generalized to all extrasolar planets , it can be used to characterize the habitability of any terrestrial planet with water and a carbonate - silicate cycle .",
    "( some authors have extended consideration of habitability to scenarios such as a dry planet with limited water @xcite or a planet rich in atmospheric hydrogen @xcite . ) for low - mass m type stars , this liquid water habitable zone falls within the tidal locking orbital distance of its parent star , so any potentially habitable planets around these stars ( according to this definition of habitability ) are at risk of atmospheric loss and may in fact be uninhabitable .",
    "the problem of atmospheric stability for planets orbiting low - mass stars has been investigated by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite using gcms to assess the degree to which atmospheric circulations can maintain planetary habitability .",
    "these simulations show that a range of planetary atmospheres can remain stable under synchronous rotation , either by a sufficiently dense carbon dioxide atmosphere @xcite or in regimes where atmospheric dynamics provides sufficient heat transport to the night side @xcite .",
    "these gcm studies demonstrate that extrasolar planets orbiting low - mass stars can indeed provide habitable conditions at locations on the surface , even with the problem of synchronous rotation .",
    "in this study we use an idealized gcm to investigate the influence of geothermal heating on atmospheric dynamics .",
    "we present a set of experiments that include fast and slow rotators to show that geothermal heating amplifies asymmetries in atmospheric circulation between the northern and southern hemispheres , which can cause transient regions of warming near the anti - stellar point .",
    "we show that the dynamical structure of the atmosphere changes on either side of the sub - stellar point , and we find that a cross - polar circulation provides transport from the day to night side in all experiments .",
    "these results provide qualitative descriptions of the expected meridional , zonal , and cross - polar circulation patterns that can help to guide further gcm studies of synchronously rotating planets .",
    "a planet can fall into synchronous rotation around its parent star when tidal dissipation slows down the planet s rotation rate .",
    "not all planets orbiting at this tidal locking distance from the parent star will necessarily become synchronous rotators , such as those with eccentric orbits or with close neighbors so that they fall into spin - orbit resonances .",
    "for example , the planet mercury is within the tidal locking distance of our sun , but it has fallen into a 3:2 spin - orbit resonance that remains stable because of its nonzero eccentricity .",
    "planets with more circular orbits , however , may evolve into synchronous rotators so that a single side is fixed at perpetual daylight , while the opposing side experiences perpetual night .",
    "the tidal migration history of any particular planet depends on factors such as the initial rate of rotation , eccentricity , and semi - major axis @xcite , which complicates efforts to determine a particular orbital distance at which a planet should be expected to fall into a synchronously rotating state .",
    "no single analytic equation can describe the tidal locking radius for all planetary systems , and empirical formulae may be limited in their predictive power . in this section",
    "we use such an empirical equation to demonstrate limits on stellar mass and rotation rate for these systems ; however , we admit that this approach is simplistic and neglects many key factors that contribute to the actual tidal history of a planetary system .    the tidal locking distance @xmath0 can be described empirically @xcite according to the formula    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is the mass of the parent star , @xmath3 is the original rotation period of the planet , @xmath4 is the time period since planetary formation , and @xmath5 is a parameter describing the inverse of the specific dissipation function for the entire planet .",
    "we restrict our focus in this study to synchronously rotating earth - like planets , which allows us to specify the parameters in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tidallocking ] ) .",
    "we assume early earth rotated more rapidly than today so that @xmath6 @xcite , and we likewise use the 4.5 billion year formation period of earth as the value of @xmath4 .",
    "the parameter @xmath5 has a relatively low value on earth today ( @xmath713 ) because most tidal dissipation occurs from gravitational interactions with the sun and moon along oceanic shorelines @xcite .",
    "however , this present - day value may be unusually large @xcite , and different continental configurations on early earth  such as a larger ocean @xcite  could have reduced the tidal dissipation rate .",
    "we will therefore use a value of @xmath8 as characteristic of early earth @xcite to describe tidal forces on a synchronously rotating earth - like planet .",
    "the value of the tidal locking distance @xmath0 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tidallocking ] ) is only weakly sensitive to changes in the parameters @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 , so the primary contributor is the mass @xmath2 of stellar types that could induce synchronous rotation for orbiting earth - like planets .",
    "we consider an earth - like planet to be a terrestrial planet that receives the same incident flux of stellar radiation as earth .",
    "the stellar flux @xmath9 reaching a planet at an orbital radius @xmath10 is related to the luminosity of its star @xmath11 according to @xmath12",
    ". we can examine planets in orbit around different stellar types by defining the earth equivalent distance of a planet @xmath13 as the orbital distance at which a planet receives an equal magnitude of radiation from its parent star as earth does from the sun @xcite .",

    "this means that f , g , and k type stars are unlikely to harbor earth - like planets in synchronous rotation , but smaller m type stars are ideal candidates to find such planets .",
    "we use this mass limit to calculate the maximum rotation rate for a synchronously rotating earth - like planet .",
    "kepler s third law gives the relation @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the orbital period at the earth equivalent distance and at earth s present distance , respectively .",

    ", we consider synchronously rotating planets with both 1-day ( `` fast '' ) and 230-day ( `` slow '' ) rotation rates to show the similarities and differences that arise in these two dynamical regimes .",
    "we use a general circulation model ( gcm ) to simulate the atmospheres of synchronously rotating earth - like planets and investigate the influence of geothermal heating .",
    "this gcm uses a hydrostatic spectral dynamical core ( with t42 resolution ) , two - stream gray radiative transfer , a diffusive boundary layer scheme , and a surface slab ocean @xcite .",
    "we set obliquity to zero and adjust the incoming solar radiation profile so the sub - stellar point is fixed on the intersection of the equator ( 0@xmath26 latitude ) and international date line ( 180@xmath26 longitude ) .",
    "we also include a geothermal heat flux in the gcm by adding a constant term to the surface temperature tendency equation .",
    "this model is still highly idealized , as the model atmosphere is transparent to incoming stellar radiation and absorbs only infrared radiation emitted upward from the surface .",
    "water vapor is assumed to be radiatively neutral , so this gcm does not include any water vapor feedback , and the model experiments also do not include any topography or cloud formation .",
    "although some of these processes will likely be significant in determining specific features of climate , these idealizations help to highlight large - scale dynamical patterns and make the model an ideal tool for investigating the prominent circulation patterns that arise on synchronously rotating planets .",
    "we consider both dry and moist regimes for our gcm experiments .",
    "we force dry gcm conditions by setting the saturation vapor pressure equal to zero and using dry adiabatic adjustment .",

    "we initialize dry and moist control states at each rotation rate with a constant temperature at all grid points and run the gcm for a 3000 day spin - up period to reach a statistically steady state .",
    "geothermal heating is then enabled ( or kept disabled ) , and the model is allowed to continue adjusting for another 500 days .",
    "we then use the subsequent 1000 days of model output in the analysis that follows .",

    "asymmetric features are also prominent in the slow dry case , with surface temperature changes of about @xmath295 k or so and slight reductions in the corresponding fast moist case .",
    "these experiments all suggest that geothermal heating acts to create or amplify asymmetric circulation features between the northern and southern hemispheres that cause transient regions of warming and cooling most prominent near the anti - stellar point .",
    "geothermal heating enhances the persistence of asymmetric features by affecting the formation of large - scale dynamical structures responsible for energy transport . even in a dry atmosphere ,",
    "strong thermally - direct circulations ( discussed further in section [ section : dynamics ] ) are sensitive to changes in the surface energy flux , which alters the transport of mass and energy from the sub - stellar to anti - stellar point and generates a slightly different pattern in the general circulation .",
    "the net effect is that the added energy from uniform geothermal heating is distributed unevenly across the surface through dynamical energy transport , which allows some additional cycles of warming and cooling to persist between the northern and southern hemispheres near the anti - stellar point .    even without geothermal heating , asymmetric features between the northern and southern hemispheres",
    "have been observed in other gcm simulations @xcite and appear to be a robust phenomenon of synchronous rotation .",
    "we even attempted to initialize the gcm into a fully symmetric synchronously rotating state without any baroclinic eddies ( following the approach of @xcite for non - synchronous rotation ) , but the model immediately lost its symmetry and reverted to the states presented here .",
    "these asymmetric features seem to persist regardless of the averaging period or sampling variability and do not appear sensitive to other changes in the model configuration .",
    "these results all suggest that the asymmetric features seen in gcms are not artifacts of averaging but are dynamically - induced features of the atmosphere that affect the distribution of surface temperature between the northern and southern hemispheres , particularly near the anti - stellar point .",
    "the atmospheric circulation on synchronously rotating planets is known to exhibit unique three - dimensional behavior that is markedly different from the prominent circulations on earth , such as equatorial superrotation and heat transport from the anti - stellar to sub - stellar point @xcite .",
    "some of this behavior is captured by typical meridional and zonal mass streamfunctions , but we show below that careful consideration of the wind field is required to accurately describe the most prominent means of transport .",
    "we describe the mean meridional circulation ( mmc ) with a mass streamfunction @xmath30 that calculates the northward mass flux above a particular pressure level @xmath31 as @xmath32 this streamfunction traces out the familiar patterns of the mmc when applied to earth models or time - averaged observations , showing direct ( i.e. , hadley ) and indirect ( i.e. , ferrel ) circulation cells . on earth , and other planets not in synchronous rotation ,",
    "the mmc is a primary driver of meridional heat transport from the tropics to poles and results in the formation of a subtropical jet and polar front jet along the edge of the circulation cells @xcite .    for planets in synchronous rotation ,",
    "the mmc still acts as a means of meridional heat transport , but the geometry of the circulation depends strongly upon rotation rate . fig .",
    "[ fig : umeanmmc ] shows the mmc @xmath30 and zonal mean zonal wind @xmath33 for the full set of experiments .",
    "the fast rotators all show similar patterns of a hadley , ferrel , and polar cell similar to earth , but the upper atmosphere features strong superrotation in a single eastward equatorial jet with westward flow only at the very top of the model .",
    "the slow rotators show an entirely different mmc configuration , with direct cells elevated above the surface and indirect cells circulating from equator to pole .",
    "the zonal wind for the slow rotators appears to be zero , which we show below results from a change in circulation across hemispheres .",
    "note that the difference between geothermal and control cases ( fig .",
    "[ fig : umeanmmc ] , bottom row ) results in asymmetric structures that are weak in strength but emphasize the role of geothermal heating in creating small asymmetries in circulation between the northern and southern hemispheres .",
    "the strength of the mmc is also stronger in dry cases compared to their moist counterparts , which occurs because the presence of water vapor increases static stability and decreases the magnitude of overturning circulations @xcite .",
    "the mmc shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : umeanmmc ] can be misleading , however , as the circulation pattern changes depending on position relative to the sub - stellar point .",
    "this observation was made by @xcite in application to a simplified model of the walker circulation , where it was noticed that the direction of the mmc changes on either side of the heating source . on earth ,",
    "the walker circulation is a transient phenomenon , but on synchronously rotating planets the star shines fixed on a single location at all times , so this theoretical prediction may be even more relevant .",
    "we therefore may expect that the patterns of circulation in our gcm experiments should change between the hemispheres east and west of the sub - stellar point .",

    "by contrast , the slow rotators do not show a change in circulation direction , but instead the wind direction changes from eastward in the eastern hemisphere to westward in the western hemisphere .",
    "slight asymmetries are apparent in the mmc between the northern and southern hemispheres , but the slow rotators appear to maintain a relatively consistent geometry across the sub - stellar point .",
    "the contrast between the zonally averaged quantities in fig .",
    "[ fig : umeanmmc ] and the hemispheric separation made in fig .",
    "[ fig : umeanmmchemi ] provides one example of the circulation features that contribute to persistent atmospheric asymmetries .        the zonal circulation , also known as the walker circulation , provides another possible mechanism for transporting energy from the sub - stellar to anti - stellar point . on earth , the walker circulation is characterized by rising motion at the heating source , eastward ( and westward ) flow aloft as air descends , and return flow along the surface back toward the heating source @xcite .",
    "we describe the mean zonal circulation ( mzc ) with a mass streamfunction @xmath34 that calculates the eastward mass flux above a particular pressure level @xmath31 as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the zonal average value minus the time - average component of zonal wind .",
    "the extent of this circulation is limited by the propagation of equatorially trapped rossby waves and equatorial kelvin waves @xcite , which provides an explanation for the regime transition in wind patterns observed between fast and slow rotators in fig .",

    "@xcite describes a change in patterns of winds that occurs when the rossby deformation radius ( which is inversely proportional to rotation rate ) begins to approach the planetary radius at a rotation rate of about 4.2 days .",
    "this regime shift has also been noted by others @xcite and is evident in many different gcms @xcite .",
    "at least for the slow rotators , we expect that the zonal circulation should provide a circulation that reaches from the sub - stellar to the anti - stellar point",

    "the fast rotators show the opposite sense : sinking motion in the vicinity near the sub - stellar point , and rising motion within the anti - stellar hemisphere . because the rossby deformation radius is small compared to the planetary radius ,",

    "the cross - polar circulation appears to be evident as a means of transport from the sub - stellar to anti - stellar point in all these experiments .",
    "the mmc and mzc also provide prominent circulations that maintain transient asymmetries between the northern and southern hemispheres , although only in the slow rotators where the rossby deformation radius is large does the mzc also contribute to this transport .",

    "this polar flow is present in all our experiments , regardless of rotation rate or geothermal heating , and should be a robust circulation feature in the atmospheres of synchronously rotating earth - like planets .",
    "gcm studies have shown that synchronously rotating planets should be stable against atmospheric collapse as long as the atmosphere is sufficiently thick @xcite .",
    "the dry and moist gcm calculations in this study all specify an earth - like value of reference surface pressure ( 1000 hpa ) , which should be resilient to collapse for any value of rotation rate ( or at least until the planet becomes close enough to its host star to trigger a runaway greenhouse @xcite ) .",
    "the interpretation of these results therefore should be robust across any intermediate rotation rates between the fast and slow cases considered here , and similar patterns of large - scale dynamics should be evident in other gcms as well .",
    "the presence of a geothermal heat flux due to tidal heating has the greatest impact on the fast rotators .",
    "the cross - polar circulation provides enhanced warming on the anti - stellar side of the planet , which creates transient regions of warming that can reach or exceed 20 k at times .",
    "this may be sufficient warming to initiate ice melt and provide warmer conditions on a transient basis , and in extreme cases this could even result in the permanent presence of standing liquid water on the anti - stellar side of the planet .",
    "the degree to which this enhanced heat flux could melt ice will depend on the physical properties of each particular planet , and representing this complex ice flow is beyond the scope of this study .",
    "nevertheless , the presence of a geothermal heat flux on fast rotators may contribute to preventing hard glaciation of the anti - stellar hemisphere and increase the available habitable surface area .",
    "slow rotators should have greatest habitability potential along the terminator .",
    "transient effects due to geothermal heating provide only a few degrees of warming or cooling , but this still might be sufficient to cause patterns in ice that forms on the anti - stellar side of such planets . whether or not this will result in permanent ice melt will depend on physical properties of the planet , but the strong superrotation on slow rotators tends to dominate the large - scale dynamical patterns .",
    "the cross - polar circulation on slow rotators complements the zonal circulation so that surface winds everywhere are drawn into the sub - stellar point and carried aloft toward the anti - stellar point .",
    "in general , the presence of the cross - polar circulation provides an additional mechanism for transporting energy and mass from the sub - stellar to anti - stellar point .",
    "linearized theory based on the analysis of the walker circulation on earth suggests analogous structures for the circulation on synchronous rotators @xcite , but these theoretical expectations of a zonal circulation reaching from the sub - stellar to anti - stellar point only seem to apply to slow rotators where the rossby deformation radius is large .",
    "faster rotators , with a smaller rossby deformation radius , do not exhibit significant zonal transport , but the pattern of the cross - polar circulation perhaps is more consistent with theory .",
    "this suggests that any gcm simulations ( and , someday , observations ) of synchronously rotating planets should consider the mass transport by the cross - polar circulation , rather than the meridional or zonal circulations exclusively , as a means of characterizing the dynamics of climate .",
    "the climate of a synchronously rotating planet is sometimes described using the term `` eyeball earth '' to denote open water beneath the sub - stellar point , relatively clement conditions along the surface in a surrounding ring , and ice - covered conditions everywhere else all the way to the anti - stellar hemisphere @xcite .",
    "if geothermal heating can cause regions of transient warming through the enhancement of large - scale circulations , then regions of melting could create cratered pockets of ice , slowly flowing glaciers , or even standing liquid water around the anti - stellar point .",
    "this suggests that `` eyeball earth '' planets might include a soft spot on the side farthest from the heat source .",
    "further investigation with gcm s coupled to ice sheet models will help to constrain the range of climates on which this could occur .",
    "low mass m - type stars provide some of the closest and most numerous targets for current exoplanet surveys , and the discovery of synchronously rotating planets within the habitable zones of these stars will increase interest in the atmospheric characterization of such worlds .",
    "we have considered a set of experiments that include slow rotators ( 1 day ) toward the inner edge of the habitable zone and fast rotators ( 230 days ) toward the outer edge of the habitable zone . between",
    "these fast and slow rotators is a regime transition where superrotation dominates , but the general patterns discussed from this limited set of experiments should extend appropriately to other rotation rates within the habitable zone .",
    "tidal heating can produce a geothermal heat flux that warms the surface of a synchronously rotating planet , which can cause transient regions of warming and cooling of up to @xmath2920 k or more on the anti - stellar hemisphere .",
    "this enhanced warming could contribute to increased ice melt along the anti - stellar point and extend the habitable surface area of the planet .",
    "this effect is stronger on fast rotators , and the presence of moisture also tends to reduce the magnitude of anomalous regions .",
    "the presence of geothermal heating acts to enhance asymmetries between the northern and southern hemispheres that alter the structure of large - scale circulation features such as the mmc , the mzc , and the cross - polar circulation .",

    "<S> earth - like planets within the liquid water habitable zone of m type stars may evolve into synchronous rotators . on these planets , the sub - stellar hemisphere experiences perpetual daylight while the opposing anti - stellar hemisphere experiences perpetual darkness . </S>",
    "<S> because the night - side hemisphere has no direct source of energy , the air over this side of the planet is prone to freeze out and deposit on the surface , which could result in atmospheric collapse . </S>",
    "<S> however , general circulation models ( gcms ) have shown that atmospheric dynamics can counteract this problem and provide sufficient energy transport to the anti - stellar side .    here </S>",
    "<S> we use an idealized gcm to consider the impact of geothermal heating on the habitability of synchronously rotating planets . </S>",
    "<S> geothermal heating may be expected due to tidal interactions with the host star , and the effects of geothermal heating provide additional habitable surface area and may help to induce melting of ice on the anti - stellar hemisphere . </S>",
    "<S> we also explore the persistence of atmospheric asymmetries between the northern and southern hemispheres , and we find that the direction of the meridional circulation ( for rapidly rotating planets ) or the direction of zonal wind ( for slowly rotating planets ) reverses on either side of the sub - stellar point . we show that the zonal circulation approaches a theoretical state similar to a walker circulation only for slowly rotating planets , while rapidly rotating planets show a zonal circulation with the opposite direction . </S>",
    "<S> we find that a cross - polar circulation is present in all cases and provides an additional mechanism of mass and energy transport from the sub - stellar to anti - stellar point . </S>",
    "<S> characterization of the atmospheres of synchronously rotating planets should include consideration of hemispheric differences in meridional circulation and examination of transport due to cross - polar flow .    </S>",
