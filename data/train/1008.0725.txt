    "they contain the uv and rapidity poles simultaneously @xmath24 and are considered to be _",
    "highly problematic_. the reason is that they prevent the removal of _ all _ uv - singularities by the standard @xmath21procedure .",
    "therefore , a special generalized renormalization procedure is needed in order to take care of those terms and enable the construction of well - defined renormalizable tmds .",
    "it is interesting to note that working in the lightcone gauge with the mandelstam - leibbrandt prescription [ ] , one does nt get any overlapping divergences , at least in the leading loop order [ ] .",
    "the renormalization properties of operators and matrix elements containing wilson lines and loops with or without obstructions have been extensively studied in various situations  see , e.g. , refs .. the specifics of the tmd consist in the fact that , though the fermion fields are separated by a spacelike distance , the gauge links lay on pure lightlike rays , or on the @xmath25transverse plane at lightcone infinity .    the analysis of the one - loop anomalous dimension of the tmd , given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : tmd_naive ] ) , shows that the contribution of the overlapping singularity is nothing else , but the _ cusp anomalous dimension _ [ ] .",
    "therefore , in order to renormalize expression ( [ eq : tmd_naive ] ) , one can apply , apart from the standard @xmath21operation , an additional renormalization factor , which depends on the cusp angle and can be written as a vacuum matrix element of the wilson lines evaluated along a special contour with an obstruction ( cusp ) ; viz .",

    "therefore , the generalized renormalization procedure for the tmd can be formulated as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the usual renormalization constant , while @xmath29 can be included in the definition of the tmd itself . in that case",

    "the soft factor , introduced above , naturally enters in the factorization formula ( [ eq : factor_symb ] ) : @xmath35 } = s$ ] . however , its interpretation is twofold .    on the one hand",
    ", it formally looks similar to the `` intrinsic '' coulomb phase found by jakob and stefanis [ ] in qed for mandelstam charged fields involving a gauge contour which is a timelike straight line .",
    "the name `` intrinsic '' derives from the fact that this phase is different from zero even in the absence of external charge distributions .",
    "its origin was ascribed in [ ] to the long - range interaction of the charged particle with its oppositely charged counterpart that was removed `` behind the moon '' after their primordial separation .",
    "note that the existence of a balancing charge `` behind the moon '' was postulated before by several authors  see [ ] for related references  in an attempt to restore the lorentz covariance of the charged sector of qed .",
    "this phase is acquired during the parallel transport of the charged field along a timelike straight line from infinity to the point of interaction with the photon field and is absent in the local approach , i.e. , for local charged fields joined by a connector .",
    "it is different from zero only for a mandelstam field with its own gauge contour attached to it and keeps track of its full history since its primordial creation .",
    "keep in mind that the connector is introduced ad hoc in order to restore gauge invariance and is not part of the qcd lagrangian .",
    "in contrast , when one associates a distinct contour with each quark field , one , actually , implies that these mandelstam field variables should also enter the qcd lagrangian ( see [ ] for more details ) . however , a consistent formulation of such a theory for qcd is still lacking and not without complications of its own .    the analogy to our case is the following .",
    "first , formally adopting a direct contour for the gauge - invariant formulation of the tmd in the light - cone gauge , the connector gauge link does not contribute any anomalous dimension ",
    "except at the endpoints ; this anomalous dimension being , however , irrelevant for the issue at stake .",
    "hence , there is no intrinsic coulomb phase in that case .",
    "second , splitting the contour and associating each branch to a quark field , transforms it into a mandelstam field and , as a result , adding together all gluon radiative corrections at the one - loop order , a @xmath23-dependent term survives that gives rise to an additional anomalous dimension .",
    "we have shown that this extra anomalous dimension can be viewed as originating from a contour with a discontinuity in the four - velocity @xmath36 at light - cone infinity  a cusp obstruction .    classically , it is irrelevant how the two distinct contours are joined , i.e. , smoothly or by a sharp bend .",
    "but switching on gluon quantum corrections , the renormalization effect on the junction point reveals that the contours are not smoothly connected , but go instead through a cusp [ ] .",
    "here , we have a second analogy to the qed case discussed above .",
    "similarly to the `` particle behind the moon '' , this cusp - like junction point is `` hidden '' and manifests itself only through the path - dependent phase after renormalization .    in that case , the soft factor looks like an intrinsic property of the gauge - invariant operators containing the fermion fields and must be taken into account in order to construct consistently the gauge - invariant renormalizable two - particle matrix elements .",
    "on the other hand , the soft factor appears as the result of the separation the `` soft '' contributions from the one - loop graphs [ ] . in this situation",
    "it is needed in order to avoid the double - counting in the factorization formula ( [ eq : factor_symb ] ) . in general",
    ", these two soft factors might be different .",
    "in particular , it has been shown in ref . [ ] that the anomalous dimensions of the tmd within different subtraction schemes of the soft factors are different .",
    "the relationship between these frameworks will be studied elsewhere .",
    "the above mentioned results have been obtained by using the lightcone axial gauge with a proper regularization of the gluon propagator [ ] .",
    "the extra rapidity divergences can be treated by different methods , e.g. , one may shift the gauge links off the lightcone , or use , alternatively , the off - the - lightcone axial gauge [ ] . in these cases ,",
    "the additional rapidity variable parameterizes the deviation of the gauge links from the light rays in terms of the axial - gauge fixing vector .",
    "an advantage of the `` pure lightcone '' frameworks is the more straightforward physical interpretation of the factorization and the role of the collinear wilson lines in the definition of tmds , as well as the direct relationship between the ( unintegrated ) tmds and the ( integrated ) collinear pdfs : one can get the collinear pdf , satisfying the dglap evolution equation , by simple @xmath1-integration .",
    "in contrast , the `` off - the - lightcone '' frameworks do nt allow us to perform such a procedure , so that more sophisticated methods must be invented .",
    "the complete proof of the qcd factorization , within the tmd approach ( in particular within the `` pure lightcone '' scheme ) , as well as the clarification of the role played by the soft factors in different approaches , are still lacking .",
