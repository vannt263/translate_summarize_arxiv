    "<S> a coupled - channel model previously employed to describe the narrow @xmath0(2317 ) and broad @xmath1(2400 ) charmed scalar mesons is generalized so as to include all ground - state pseudoscalar - pseudoscalar and vector - vector two - meson channels . </S>",
    "<S> all parameters are chosen fixed at published values , except for the overall coupling constant , which is fine - tuned to reproduce the @xmath0(2317 ) mass . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the radial excitations @xmath0(2850 ) and @xmath1(2740 ) are predicted , both with a width of about 50 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the former state appears to correspond to the new @xmath2(2860 ) resonance decaying to @xmath3 announced by babar in the course of this work . </S>",
    "<S> also the @xmath1(2400 ) resonance is roughly reproduced , though perhaps with a somewhat too low central resonance peak .    </S>",
    "<S> the discovery of the @xmath4 @xcite and @xmath5 @xcite charm - strange mesons three years ago has triggered a strongly renewed interest in heavy - light mesons , and even meson spectroscopy in general . </S>",
    "<S> especially the @xmath4 has given rise to many different theoretical efforts ( see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for a long though still incomplete list of references ) . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is its surprisingly low mass , some 170 mev below the predictions of standard relativized constituent quark models for the ground - state scalar @xmath6 meson ( see e.g.ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) , an assignment that has in the meantime been confirmed by experiment @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this discrepancy led several model builders to propose alternative explanations for the @xmath4 , such as a tetraquark or a meson molecule . </S>",
    "<S> however , in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we showed how the low mass of the @xmath4 can be quantitatively understood by taking into account its strong coupling to the nearby @xmath7-wave @xmath3 channel . </S>",
    "<S> this explanation was later supported by refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , we explained the @xmath5 in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite via its strong coupling to the @xmath7-wave @xmath8 threshold . the coupled - channel model employed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite had been previously used , with essentially the same parameters , to reproduce the @xmath7-wave @xmath9 phase shifts and predict @xcite the @xmath10 ( alias @xmath11 ) resonance , later confirmed by experiment @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , no consensus has been reached so far on the @xmath4 , in part due to the poor experimental status of the very broad partner charm - nonstrange state , listed as @xmath12 , but first reported at a mass of 2308 mev @xcite and later also at 2407 mev @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , a more detailed coupled - channel analysis of charmed scalar mesons is very opportune , also in view of new and heavier states that are expected to be found at b factories . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , for a reliable description of higher resonances , additional decay channels must be accounted for . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in the present letter , we extend @xcite the model of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite by including all lowest pseudoscalar - pseudoscalar ( pp ) and vector - vector ( vv ) two - meson channels that couple to the scalar @xmath6 and @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) systems , in an approach very similar to ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . in the latter paper , the coupling to all pp channels allowed to fit the properties of the light scalar mesons @xmath15 , @xmath11 , @xmath16(980 ) , and @xmath17(980 ) , such as phase shifts , line - shapes , elasticities , and inelastic amplitudes , obtaining an overall good description of these observables , as well as very reasonable pole positions . in the present investigation , </S>",
    "<S> the inclusion of the vv channels as well is crucial to study possible radial excitations , as in the @xmath13 and @xmath6 sectors the lowest vv channels open at roughly 2.8 gev and 2.9 gev , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> we will first discuss the results and finish this letter with a short description of the mathematics behind the resonance - spectrum expansion ( rse ) , which is the framework of our model @xcite . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ dk ] we show , for the @xmath6 case , the resulting @xmath7-wave @xmath18 cross sections .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     the pseudoscalar @xmath19-@xmath20 mixing angle @xmath21 we choose at the recently found experimental value @xmath22 @xcite ( octet - singlet basis ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , we also verify our results for another frequently used value , i.e. , @xmath23 @xcite , which turns out to change the predictions by only a few mev . </S>",
    "<S> we force the damping of closed scattering channels with subthreshold form factors , which are a standard tool in modern multichannel phase - shift analyses : @xmath24 we choose the value @xmath25 gev@xmath26 , which is the same as used in the analysis of the light scalars @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such a suppression , in addition to the one resulting from our kinematically relativistic schrdinger formalism , can be justified from relativistic covariance , offshellness , self - energies , and other effects not accounted for in the present model . </S>",
    "<S> these contributions are , of course , very difficult to rigorously evaluate in our nonperturbative scheme . </S>",
    "<S> however , even if we were to completely switch off subthreshold damping , our @xmath0(2850 ) pole would only shift to @xmath27 mev , after a readjustment of @xmath28 so as to reproduce again the @xmath0(2317 ) mass .    having now fixed all parameters in formula  ( [ multis ] ) , we can search our amplitudes for resonance poles . </S>",
    "<S> we predict the first radial excitations of the @xmath29(2317 ) and @xmath1(2400 ) to come out as @xmath30(2850)(2850 ) pole was estimated at @xmath31 mev and @xmath32 mev , respectively . here , with a restriction to the three pp channels only , the pole comes out at @xmath33 mev . ] and @xmath34(2740 ) , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we furthermore predict the very broad states @xmath29(2780 ) and @xmath35(2700 ) , which might show up in a more pronounced way in production experiments than in elastic scattering .    </S>",
    "<S> note added in proof : after completion of this work , the babar collaboration posted a preprint @xcite confirming the announcement of the @xmath36 in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , three theoretical papers on this new state have appeared in the meantime , the first one @xcite favoring a @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) assignment , the second @xcite a @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) like we do , and the third @xcite admitting either possibility . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , the non - observation so far of the @xmath8 decay mode , forbidden for a scalar meson , favors the @xmath39 option , although the @xmath41 mode , not observed either , is allowed in both the @xmath39 and @xmath37 scenarios . </S>",
    "<S> it is also interesting that ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , which makes out a case for the @xmath37 assignment , predicts branching ratios @xmath42 for @xmath37 , and @xmath43 for @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> we predict a value of 0.30 for the latter branching ratio , if we include all pp+vv channels . </S>",
    "<S> anyhow , experiment will have the final word on interpreting the @xmath36 beyond any doubt , by observing either @xmath41 or @xmath8 . </S>"
