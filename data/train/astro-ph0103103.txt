    "in the hierarchical scenarios of the structure formation of the universe , cluster of galaxies are formed through subcluster mergers . both observations",
    "( e.g. bliton et al . 1998 ; owen et al . 1999 ; markevitch et al . 2000 ) and simulations ( e.g. roettiger , loken & burns 1997 ; roettiger , stone & burns 1999 ; bekki 1999 ) show that the merging dramatically change the physical characteristics of the intracluster medium ( icm ) and galaxies , like the temperature , density and magnetic field strength of icm , star formation rate and radio emission of galaxies",
    ". however , many processes related to the mergers and their effects are still vague .",
    "hence systematic analyses of merging clusters are very helpful to deepen our understanding on this complex dynamical process . here",
    "we present recent  observations and analysis on the well - known merging cluster a2256 .",
    "a2256 is a rich cluster with strong x - ray emission ( l@xmath8 10@xmath9 ergs s@xmath7 ) at the redshift 0.058",
    ". observations ( briel et al . 1991 ) clearly revealed two peaks near the center , separated by about @xmath10 .",
    "one of them is roughly at the geometric center of the cluster , while the other one is considered to be a merging subcluster .",
    "the previous x - ray observations also showed that the subcluster has a lower temperature than the main cluster ( briel et al .",
    "1991 ; miyaji et al . 1993 ; markevitch 1996 , m96 hereafter ) and temperature generally decreases with the radius ( m96 ; molendi , de grandi & fusco - femiano 2000 , mdf00 hereafter ) .",
    "briel & henry ( 1994 ) reported two hot spots ( @xmath11 12 kev ) in this cluster using data .",
    "however , they were not confirmed by and  observations ( m96 ; mdf00 ) .",
    "the velocity dispersion of the galaxies is very large ( @xmath1 1300 km / s ; fabricant , kent & kurtz 1989 ) and the velocity distribution shows substructure ( roettiger , burns & pinkney 1995 ) .",
    "the radio properties of a2256 are anomalous ( bridle & fomalont 1976 ; bridle et al .",
    "1979 ; r@xmath12ttgering et al .",
    "1994 , r94 hereafter ) .",
    "a remarkable radio relic , with sharp edges and possible filamentary structure , was found northwest of the two x - ray peaks .",
    "at least four head - tail sources were found , including one with an exceptional narrow , straight tail extending to at least about 0.7 mpc .",
    "r94 suggested that the halo was composed of a few head - tail galaxies that were heavily distorted due to the infalling subcluster .",
    "recent  observation ( fusco - femiano et al .",
    "2000 ) also showed the existence of nonthermal x - ray emission from the cluster but only significant above 10 kev .    in this paper , we present the analysis of the recent  observations of a2256 .",
    "observations and data reduction are in @xmath132 .",
    "the analysis is in @xmath133 .",
    "@xmath134 is the discussion and @xmath135 is the summary . throughout this paper , we assume h@xmath14 = 70 km s@xmath7 mpc@xmath7 and q@xmath14 = 0.5 .",
    "these cosmological parameters correspond to the linear scale of 1.08 kpc / arcsec at the cluster redshift .",
    "a2256 was observed by  three times with advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) .",
    "the information of the observations are listed in table 1 . for each observation , we excluded the known bad columns , hot pixels , chip node boundaries and events with  grades 1 , 5 and 7 , as well as bad aspect intervals .",
    "the proper gain map file for that period was used .",
    "particle background flare periods were excluded based on the x - ray light curves from the outer parts of the field .",
    "the back - illuminated ( bi ) chips and front - illuminated ( fi ) chips were filtered separately since they have different background flare levels ( see markevitch et al .",
    "2000 for details ) .",
    "the chips used for data analysis are i0 - i3 chips of the acis - i observation and s2 - s4 chips of the acis - s observation .",
    "the streak events in s4 chip were removed by the `` destreak '' tool in ciao .",
    "the short observation 1521 was dominated by background flares ( over 80% of its exposure time ) and the statistics are quite poor so we do not include that data in our analysis .    to subtract the correct background ,",
    "the blank field background dataset relevant for the period of the observations was used ( markevitch 2001 ) .",
    "since the background may change slightly with time , we also checked the background rate using the data at high energy ( 10 - 12 kev in the front - illuminated - fi chips and 9 - 12 kev in the back - illuminated - bi chips ) .",
    "it was found that the background normalization should be increased by 8% in fi chips , consistent with the expected long - term background trend .",
    "note that although the correction should apply only to the particle component of the total background ( and not the cosmic x - ray background or cxb ) , that component is dominant at energy greater than 2 - 3 kev which is most important for the gas temperature fitting .",
    "small rescaling of the cxb component generally has only tiny effect on the spectral fitting .",
    "thus we apply this correction across the energy range for simplicity . the systematic uncertainty of the background normalization ( @xmath1510% ) that encompasses this correction was also included in all the confidence intervals reported below .",
    "shortly after the launch of , the acis fi chips suffered increasing `` charge transfer inefficiency '' ( cti ) problem .",
    "the effect is seen as a decreasing quantum efficiency ( qe ) with increasing distance from the readout node . here",
    "the results of the calibration observations of g21.5 - 0.9 were adopted to make cti corrections ( vikhlinin 2000 ) .",
    "we also used an additional position - independent correction factor of 0.93 for the acis - i quantum efficiency below 1.8 kev to account for the difference between acis - s3 and acis - i ( vikhlinin 2000 ) .",
    "for hot clusters , ignoring it results in spuriously high temperature and the dependence of fitting results on the adopted low energy cut ( markevitch & vikhlinin 2001 ) .",
    "ciao(1.1.5 ) , ftools(5.0 ) , xspec(10.0 ) and some our own software were used to do the data reduction .",
    "the exposure maps were generated using our own software ( equivalent to the similar one in ciao ) . since vignetting is dependent on the energy ,",
    "narrow bands were used and weighting spectra were also applied in producing the exposure maps ( the weighting spectra differ from chip to chip based on the fitting result of the integrated spectrum of each chip ) . to produce response files of the spectra in the interested regions ( response matrices - rmf and auxiliary response files - arf ) ,",
    "the tools calcrmf and calcarf by vikhlinin were used .",
    "the arf was calculated by weighting the mirror effective area in the region with the observed cluster brightness distribution in 0.5 - 2.0 kev band .",
    "the rmf was calculated by weighting the standard set of matrices within the region by the observed cluster brightness distribution .",
    "all the errors in this paper are 90% confidence interval .",
    "over 30 point sources were detected in two observations using the ciao wavelet detection tool .",
    "a detailed analysis on those point sources is beyond the scope of the paper . in this section",
    ", we will mainly discuss the point sources coincident with the member galaxies .",
    "three member galaxies ( all ellipticals ) were found to have corresponding x - ray sources in both observations .",
    "they are shown in fig . 1 .",
    "one is the elliptical galaxy e ( fig .",
    "2 ) which is also a radio head - tail galaxy ( a in r94 ) .",
    "only about 50 counts from it in total were collected during the two observations .",
    "the statistics of the data do not allow us to constrain the temperature or the photon index well even if its spectrum is that simple .",
    "if we simply assumed a 1 kev thermal plasma with normal solar abundance , the derived luminosity is about 8@xmath210@xmath5 ergs s@xmath7 ( 0.5 - 10 kev ) . if a powerlaw with photon index 1.7 is assumed , the derived luminosity is about 3@xmath210@xmath6 ergs s@xmath7 ( 0.5 - 10 kev ) .",
    "the other two sources correspond to the nw core of the double galaxy ngc 6331 ( c ) and galaxy d respectively ( fig .",
    "only about 20 counts in total were collected from each source in the two observations .",
    "their luminosity are estimated to be around 3@xmath210@xmath5 ergs s@xmath7 for the 1 kev thermal plasma assumption , or 10@xmath6 ergs s@xmath7 for the powerlaw ( photon index 1.7 ) assumption ( 0.5 - 10 kev ) .",
    "the x - ray emission may come from the low luminosity active galactic nuclei ( llagn ) or thermal halos .",
    "we also tried to explore the nature of the brightest two point sources in the field ( fig . 1 ; # 1 : 7.5 c / ks - i3 ; # 2 : 5.4 c / ks - i0 and 8.4 c / ks - s3 ) .",
    "# 1 is also marginally seen in both  pspc and hri images .",
    "# 1 has a very faint optical counterpart in dss ii while # 2 has no counterpart .",
    "we extracted and fitted their spectra with a simple powerlaw model .",
    "if the absorption is fixed at the galactic value , the photon index for # 1 and # 2 are 1.4@xmath16 and 1.3@xmath150.4 respectively .",
    "thus , they might be background agns . based on these best - fit ,",
    "their 0.5 - 10 kev unabsorbed flux are 10@xmath17 ergs s@xmath7 @xmath18 and 7@xmath210@xmath19 ergs s@xmath7 @xmath18 respectively .",
    "we also compared the observed source number with the predicted by the log n - log s relation derived in  deep fields ( e.g. giacconi et al .",
    "2001 ) and found no significant difference .",
    "the 0.5 - 7 kev combined acis - i / s image is shown in fig . 1 overlaid on a dss ii image .",
    "the background was subtracted and the image was divided by the exposure map .",
    "all the point sources were excluded .",
    "the two previously resolved peaks at the center ( p@xmath20 and p@xmath21 hereafter ) by  ( briel et al .",
    "1991 ) are prominent and both show internal structures ( fig .",
    "it is noticed that the central part of the subcluster ( the western peak ) is elongated along the east - west direction , while the central part of the main cluster ( the eastern peak ) is elongated along the north - south direction ( fig . 1 and 2 ) .",
    "these two peaks are separated by about @xmath22 and p@xmath21 is somewhat brighter . in dss",
    "ii image , there is no galaxy concentration around p@xmath21 .",
    "radio head - tail galaxies e , f and g ( fig .",
    "2 ) and double galaxy ngc 6331 ( c ) all have offsets to p@xmath21 from @xmath23 to @xmath24 .",
    "the surface brightness peak of the main cluster is located 0.5@xmath0 north of a big elliptical galaxy ( b ) , while galaxy a , the galaxy with the most extended optical halo in a2256 , is about 50 kpc east of the peak . besides p@xmath20 and p@xmath21 ,",
    "a new structure was found significantly to the east of p@xmath20 in  observations ( fig . 1 and 2 ) .",
    "in this paper we call it p@xmath25 or `` shoulder '' from its morphology .",
    "this structure is shown as a small clump extended from p@xmath20 but with a clear local maximum and seems to be embedded in the main cluster .",
    "the  images were re - checked and this structure was also found in both hri and pspc images though it is not very significant .",
    "it was also detected in the wavelet analysis on pspc data by slezak , durret & gerbal ( 1994 ) .",
    "this structure has interesting spectral characteristics and will be discussed later .",
    "we also zoom - in the central part of a2256 to see any substructures around the center ( fig .",
    "the wavelet decomposition tool ( vikhlinin , forman & jones 1997 ) was applied to the image and the reconstructed image ( the right one in fig .",
    "2 ) is quite similar to the simply smoothed one ( the left one in fig .",
    "both images show complex structures around the center .",
    "p@xmath20 and p@xmath21 also show internal structures , which may also be a support for some kind of ongoing dynamical process in this cluster .",
    "however , the current data do not allow us to constrain the spectral difference on such small scales .",
    "besides the `` shoulder '' and the substructures within p@xmath20 and p@xmath21 , there are still several interesting significant facts .",
    "first , there are no x - ray enhancements around the central biggest ellipticals a , b and c ( the 3 @xmath26 upper limits are all about 2@xmath210@xmath6 ergs s@xmath7 at 0.5 - 10 kev , assuming 1 kev thermal spectrum and 0.5@xmath0 aperture size . ) .",
    "second , the surface brightness gradient at the south of p@xmath21 is sharper than those in other directions ( more prominent in the unsmoothed image ; also pointed out by briel & henry , 1991 ) .",
    "third , there is a protrusion which extends from the center of p@xmath21 to the southwest . as shown in fig .",
    "6 , after removing the main cluster , the southern parts become even sharper . in @xmath133.6 , we will show that it may be something like a cold front .      in view of the complex central structure mentioned in @xmath133.2 and",
    "the fact that a2256 is very likely a cluster in merging , the knowledge of the temperature distribution can reveal us the nature of the structures and the merging .",
    "the resolution of the temperature map one can achieve for a2256 with  is limited by statistics and the psf effect can be ignored completely .",
    "we used the following method to obtain the temperature map .",
    "first , the field was divided into 30 regions ( as shown in fig .",
    "3 ) with similar number of counts , then for each region we fitted the spectrum to get the temperature ( for region # 11 - 30 , we fitted the spectra from two observations simultaneously ) . in view of the uncertainty of the acis low energy response ,",
    "only 0.9 - 9 kev data were used and the absorption was fixed to the galactic value 4.1@xmath210@xmath27 @xmath18 .",
    "the best - fit temperatures are not sensitive to any small excess in absorption .",
    "the redshift was fixed at 0.058 and the abundance was fixed at 0.3 solar ( we used the solar abundance table by anders & grevesse 1989 ) , which is the average value of previous observations ( e.g. m96 ; mdf00 ) .",
    "the mekal code in xspec was used .",
    "second , we shifted the regions half - size along the parallel and perpendicular directions to the orientation of the first set of regions to get two additional similar temperature maps .",
    "the final one was obtained by averaging the above three .",
    "then the final temperature map was adaptively smoothed a little bit for a better presentation ( fig .",
    "3 ) . two checks were performed .",
    "the first is the integrated temperature of the central @xmath28 square ( acis - s3 chip fov , see fig .",
    "the result is 6.7@xmath29 kev , consistent with the central temperature ( @xmath1 7 kev ) reported by previous observations ( e.g. miyaji et al .",
    "1993 ; markevitch & vikhlinin 1997b ; white 2000 ; mdf00 ) .",
    "the second is that we did spectral fits at the same regions as those in  paper ( mdf00 ) .",
    "our results generally agree with theirs within 0.5 kev , except in their region 2nw , where  spectrum may suffer the contamination from the nearby high temperature regions due to the large point spread function ( psf ) of   ( @xmath30 hpd for mecs at 1.5 kev ) .    on the 5 arcmin scale ,",
    "the acis temperature map is in agreement with that of  ( m96 ) .",
    "it shows moderate temperature variations across the cluster but not as strong as expected in a major merger ( e.g. roettiger et al .",
    "1997 and other simulations ) . combining this temperature map with the image ,",
    "no shock was found in the field ( a feature that is likely a `` cold front '' will be discussed in @xmath133.6 ) .",
    "the subcluster has lower temperature ( @xmath1 4 kev at the coolest region ) than the main cluster and the shape of the low temperature regions strongly suggests that the subcluster entered the main cluster from somewhere west .",
    "this temperature map , if we omit the `` shoulder '' , resembles those at the early stages of merging in simulations ( e.g. roettiger et .",
    "al 1997 ; takizawa 1999 ; takizawa 2000 ) .",
    "it is also interesting that the apparent coolest part of the subcluster is about @xmath24 west of its surface brightness peak .",
    "the main cluster appears largely undisturbed , as concluded by markevitch & vikhlinin ( 1997a ) from the  results .",
    "the central region of the main cluster is generally cooler than its outskirts covered by our fov .",
    "this is more likely due to the projection of the cooler subcluster and possibly the `` shoulder '' , rather than the genuine temperature gradient .",
    "there is a hot region ( @xmath1 9 kev ; around regions # 5 and # 16 in fig .",
    "3 ) at the north of the main cluster .",
    "we notice that it is just in positional coincidence with the eastern lobe of the radio relic ( fig .",
    "1 ) . this might imply some kind of physical relation between the merging events and the radio relics .",
    "it is also noticed that there is a hot region near the south edge of the subcluster . in @xmath133.6",
    ", we will show it might be related to a cold front .",
    "the two hot spots reported by briel & henry ( 1994 ) are located in the fov of acis - i ( fig .",
    "3 ) . our measurements ( 7.9@xmath31 kev for",
    "their ne spot and 5.8@xmath32 kev for the sw one ) do not confirm the existence of these hot spots , consistently with the earlier   and  conclusions ( markevitch & vikhlinin 1997a ; mdf00 ) .",
    "we also checked the existence of any nonthermal component in the spectra , especially at the regions of the radio relic .",
    "no clear evidence for such component in acis spectra was found .",
    "a simple cooling flow component was also added to the spectral model but that never changed @xmath33 significantly and the obtained mass accretion rates were always very small .",
    "the integrated abundance for the central @xmath28 square ( acis - s3 chip fov ) was obtained by simultaneously fitting the spectra of two observations .",
    "it is 0.34@xmath34 , which is a little higher than the previous results for the whole cluster , 0.27@xmath150.06 by m96 ( we converted their value for the abundance table used here ) and 0.25@xmath150.03 by mdf00 ( we converted their 68% confidence error into 90% ) .",
    "this is consistent well with the recent finding that the abundance generally falls with radius ( mdf00 ) and their results in the inner radial bins . here",
    "we are more interested in the distribution of iron .",
    "the statistics of the data do not permit a detailed analysis for the whole field .",
    "however , in checking spectra from the regions that we used for the temperature map , at least two with significantly high iron abundance areas were found .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "4 . the four solid line regions , from a to d , represent p@xmath20 , p@xmath21 , p@xmath25 and a southern part of the main cluster ( relatively far from the subcluster ) respectively .",
    "the results from acis - i and acis - s agree well , so we performed simultaneous fits for each region . as shown in the figure 4 , it is clear that p@xmath21 and p@xmath25 have more iron than p@xmath20 and the southern main cluster region . the joint abundance - temperature 90% confidence regions for a - d are shown in fig . 5 , which again reinforces that a and d are different from b and c. markevitch & vikhlinin ( 1997b ) also obtained a higher iron abundance at the subcluster than that of the main cluster using  data but the difference was not significant , which may due to the wide psf of .",
    "if we further consider the possible contamination of emission among the three structures due to projection , even higher abundance contrasts would be expected .",
    "the iron abundance in other regions ( e.g. the outer parts of the subcluster and the north part of the main cluster ) are all around the average ( @xmath1 0.3 ) but poorly constrained .",
    "current data can not allow us to determine whether the high iron abundance is only localized in the `` shoulder '' or also present in its immediate surrounding .",
    "no iron abundance enhancement was found to be around galaxies c and e.    we also measured the redshifts in several regions from the iron k@xmath35 line blend .",
    "the regions we chose among those in fig . 4 are b ( the subcluster ) , c ( the `` shoulder '' ) , and the acis - s3 fov excluding b , c and their @xmath23 surrounding ( the main cluster ) .",
    "the results are 0.056@xmath36 , 0.064@xmath37 , and 0.064@xmath150.010 respectively .",
    "all the values are consistent with a single redshift , suggesting that the main cluster , the subcluster and the `` shoulder '' are possible to be associated . using the log n - log s relation for clusters ( e.g. kitayama , sasaki & suto 1998 ; de grandi et al .",
    "1999 ) , and considering the observed maximal difference of redshifts ( @xmath1 0.03 ) , the possibility that they are a chance superposition is less than 10@xmath38 . therefore we conclude that they are very likely to be associated and interacting as also suggested by the temperature map and the possible cold front ( @xmath133.6 ) .",
    "the current data and calibration status do not allow us to constrain the spatial distribution of other elements , like silicon .",
    "the integrated silicon abundance in the acis - s3 fov is 0.50@xmath150.23 while the  result is 0.97@xmath150.39 for the whole cluster ( fukazawa et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "observations reveal complex structures around the center of a2256",
    ". we should realize that due to the projection the observed spectra , especially those around the center , have at least two components entangled  the main cluster and the subcluster .",
    "it would be very helpful for our understanding if we can separate them .",
    "however , this is actually very hard since the merging clusters are not in hydrostatic equilibrium and we do not yet know their relative geometry . here , we just present a very simple way to isolate the subcluster and decompose the spectral components . briefly speaking",
    ", we tried to use a @xmath39-model to represent the main cluster ( not the whole cluster ) and examine the residuals .",
    "then we can use those information to separate the spectral components in observed spectra . the  image ( background - subtracted and exposure - corrected )",
    "shows that the surface brightness is rather spherical in the outer parts , especially after we exclude the subcluster region using a circle with some radius ( @xmath1 7@xmath0 ) centered at the core of the subcluster .",
    "thus we can simply measure the surface brightness beyond that subcluster region to make a @xmath39-model fit to the main cluster .",
    "the outer contours of the  pspc images were used to find the geometric center of the main cluster , which is about @xmath23 south of the apparent peak of the main cluster .",
    "it is shown in fig .",
    "a @xmath40 radius circle centered at the peak of the subcluster was used to represent the subcluster and a @xmath24 radius circle at p@xmath25 was used to represent the emission from the `` shoulder '' . only radial surface - brightness measurement outside of these circles was made .",
    "all the point sources were excluded .",
    "acis - i / s and pspc data were used .",
    "the derived core radius is 3.8@xmath150.3 arcmin ( or 0.25@xmath150.02 mpc ) , and @xmath39 is 0.58@xmath150.04 . the residual after removing the best - fit @xmath39-model of the main cluster is shown in fig .",
    "the `` shoulder '' is more prominent and the morphology of the subcluster is distorted , which is natural for a falling cluster .",
    "moreover , the southern surface brightness has become sharper and points sse , appearing more edge - like",
    ".    then we can try to disentangle the spectral components in the observed spectra .",
    "from the temperature map and the observed surface density discontinuity ( @xmath133.6 ) , it is known that the subcluster enters the main cluster from the west .",
    "thus we do not expect much projection effect from the subcluster on p@xmath20 .",
    "here we only want to investigate p@xmath21 and p@xmath25 ( the two regions in fig .",
    "2 ) . to do that , we first need to assume the temperature of the contaminating gas from the main cluster at p@xmath21 and p@xmath25 .",
    "three value , 7 , 8 and 9 kev , were assumed .",
    "the abundance of the main cluster gas was fixed at 0.3 .",
    "the normalization of the contaminating gas is obtained from the best - fit @xmath39-model .",
    "the results are shown in table 2 .",
    "as expected , we obtained larger contrasts on temperature and abundance between the main cluster and the others .",
    "the abundance of the `` shoulder '' is still high after the decomposition . from the best - fit emission measure , assuming a constant density sphere ,",
    "its gas mass is around 2@xmath210@xmath3 m@xmath4 if its dimension along the line of sight is not very different from others .",
    "6 shows a clear edge - like structure running along the sse direction .",
    "we measured the surface brightness profile in the linear regions parallel to the edge in the co - added acis image ( not the residual ) .",
    "the temperature at each side of the edge are also obtained in the regions shown in fig .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "7 . at the edge",
    ", there is a break in the surface brightness profile that indicates a density discontinuity and a temperature jump from about 4.5 kev to about 8.5 kev .",
    "this feature is quite similar to the cold fronts found in a2142 by markevitch et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and a3667 by vikhlinin et al .",
    "( 2001a ) . in a2142 and a3667 ,",
    "these features delineate the contact surfaces of the cold dense clouds and the surrounding hotter gas , through which they move . in the case of a2256",
    ", the geometry is more complicated and there is projection of multiple structures .",
    "therefore , it is not possible to derive the real density and pressure contrast across the edge .",
    "the flat shape of the edge may imply that it is only part of the whole moving edge ( the other parts are smoothed out by projection if the moving front is tilted from the plane of sky ) , or the moving front viewed by an angle with the line of sight .",
    "the protrusion mentioned in @xmath133.2 might be related to the striping gas of the subcluster or its wake .",
    "this discovery , adds another candidate to the list of merging clusters which have cold fronts  a2142 , a3667 and rxj1720.1 + 2638 ( mazzotta et al . 2001 ) .",
    "more cold fronts could be expected when more  data are available .",
    "systematic studies of such phenomena will enrich our knowledge on merging of the clusters .",
    "observations reveal a new structure - the `` shoulder '' - near the center , a localized feature with size about @xmath22 and gas mass about 2@xmath210@xmath3 m@xmath4 ( assuming a constant density sphere and its dimension along the line of sight is similar as others ) .",
    "its spectrum implies that iron is enriched in this structure ( @xmath1 1 after the decomposition ) .",
    "two galaxies ( d and h in fig .",
    "2 ) are apparently located in this structure though they are not necessarily associated with it .",
    "bridle & fomalont ( 1976 ) found a @xmath41 low - brightness radio relic roughly centered at galaxy d ( also the radio source d in the same paper ) besides the bright nw halo ( fig .",
    "the `` shoulder '' is within that diffuse radio relic .",
    "although the roughly similar temperature and abundance between this structure and the center of the subcluster may suggest that it is a remaining of the subcluster spread along the path of its infall , its location ( east of p@xmath20 ) is inconsistent with the infalling direction ( somewhere from the west ) of the subcluster suggested by the temperature map , the possible cold front and the general direction of the radio head - tail sources ( e , f and g in fig .",
    "since its x - ray redshift suggests it is a feature inside a2256 ( @xmath133.4 ) , only two choices are left : either a new merging component or an internal structure of the main cluster .",
    "another merging component seems to be a feasible explanation .",
    "in fact , if we ignore the subcluster , the  image resembles simulated images for a merger between a massive cluster and a much less massive one at about 0.3 gyr after core crossing ( e.g. takizawa 1999 ; takizawa 2000 ) .",
    "the fact that there are two big elliptical galaxies rather than one dominant galaxy around the center also supports the idea that the main cluster has not yet relaxed well .",
    "hence , we suggest that a2256 may be a system with three clusters ( or two clusters and one group ) in merging .",
    "about 0.3 gyr before the ongoing merger , there was a merger between the massive cluster and a less massive system .",
    "the less massive system might be a galaxy group that did not disturb the potential well of the massive cluster much .",
    "the `` shoulder '' might be the relic of its core and galaxy b might be once the dominant galaxy of that less massive system since it is 2 times less luminous than a. gonzlez - casado , mamon & salvador - sol ( 1994 ) found such kind of the relic of the core can survive in at least one cluster crossing .",
    "the observed iron abundance difference between the `` shoulder '' and p@xmath20 might suggest it was an off - center merger .",
    "the less massive system may have fallen into the massive cluster somewhere from the west as implied by the simulations and the relatively sharper surface brightness at the east than other directions . under such scenario , the low - brightness radio relic found by bridle & fomalont ( 1976 )",
    "would be related to this earlier merger event and the much brighter nw one may be related to the ongoing merger .",
    "the fading of the radio haloes after the merger was discussed by tribble ( 1993 ) .",
    "the typical aging time - scale is at the order of 10@xmath42 years , consistent with our picture here .",
    "another possibility is that the `` shoulder '' is an internal structure of the main cluster as the two local dips of the potential around the d galaxies in coma ( vikhlinin et al .",
    "the gas mass of the `` shoulder '' is about 2@xmath210@xmath3 m@xmath4 , while cd galaxies in clusters of galaxies often have gas content at the level of 10@xmath3 - 10@xmath43 m@xmath4 ( trimble 2000 ) .",
    "the galaxy a , which resembles the cd most in a2256 , is quite near the `` shoulder '' . before the ongoing merger ,",
    "the galaxy a may be at the center of the `` shoulder '' , which could be the halo of hot gas .",
    "when the ongoing merger began , the gases ( the `` shoulder '' ) might lag behind the galaxy a similar to the case discussed in @xmath134.2 .",
    "the iron mass excess within it is estimated to be about 10@xmath42 m@xmath4 , while the stellar mass of a is estimated to be about 7@xmath210@xmath3 m@xmath4 assuming m / l = 7(m / l)@xmath4 and l@xmath44 = 10@xmath3 m@xmath4 .",
    "thus , an injection of iron about 0.03% of the stellar mass of a is needed to explain the iron excess , which is still possible in the galactic - wind models ( e.g. arimoto & yoshii 1987 ) .",
    "fabian & daines ( 1991 ) suggested that the subcluster had a cooling flow based on  observations .",
    "in @xmath133.5 it is shown that the real temperature of the subcluster is about 4.5 kev around the center .",
    "the estimated gas density at the central 80 kpc of the subcluster is about 3.6@xmath210@xmath45cm@xmath45 from the spectral fitting .",
    "the cooling time scale is 85 gyr ( n/10@xmath45 @xmath47 ( t/8.6 kev)@xmath48 , where n and t are the density and temperature of the gas . our revised cooling time at the center of the subcluster is 14 - 20 gyr .",
    "though the estimated cooling time can not completely rule out the existence of the cooling flow , neither the image nor spectra require any present cooling flow around the center of the subcluster .",
    "@xmath133.5 shows that the central 150 kpc of the subcluster has high iron abundance ( @xmath1 0.6 ) , which decreases to about 0.3 at the outer parts .",
    "briel & henry ( 1991 ) divided the galaxies in a2256 into two groups using a simultaneous fit of two gaussians to the whole velocity data , though the two redshift distribution components are not spatially separated . based on their fit , they suggested that the subcluster was a poor cluster .",
    "indeed , the observed x - ray characteristics of this subcluster resemble those of some poor clusters ( virgo by matsumoto et al .",
    "1996 ; centaurus by fukazawa et al .",
    "1994 ; awm 7 by xu et al .",
    "1997 and ezawa et al .",
    "all of them have comparably low ( or lower ) temperature with the subcluster in a2256 and similar abundance gradients . however , all these poor clusters have central cooling flows while as discussed above , currently there is no cooling flow in the subcluster .",
    "one possibility is that the cooling flow of the subcluster has been destroyed by the early interaction during the merger while the abundance gradient was kept .",
    "it is interesting that there is no galaxy concentration near the surface brightness peak of the subcluster .",
    "a natural explanation would involve the different falling velocity of the galaxies ( here they may be c , e , and f ) and the gas .",
    "the gas may lag behind the galaxies due to the drag by the main cluster gas , which is implied by the highly distorted shape of the subcluster gas and the apparent contact discontinuity .",
    "we investigate whether this picture is applicable to galaxy c , the best candidate of the cd of the subcluster according to its halo size .",
    "though both galaxies and gas may undergo spiral - in , deceleration or acceleration , the time from when they began to separate could be simply expressed as 0.1 mpc sin@xmath49 / ( v@xmath50 - v@xmath51 ) , where @xmath52 is the angle with the line of sight , v@xmath50 and v@xmath51 are the velocity of the galaxy c and gas respectively . for a time scale of 0.5 gyr",
    ", a velocity difference about 200 sin@xmath49 can explain the observed displacement .",
    "since large velocity dispersion ( @xmath1 1300 km s@xmath7 ) was found in this cluster , a velocity difference ( v@xmath50 - v@xmath51 ) around several hundred km s@xmath7 is quite possible .",
    "the temperature map and the observed surface density discontinuity imply that the subcluster entered the main cluster from somewhere west .",
    "however , current data do not allow us to make a definite conclusion to the moving direction of the subcluster .",
    "it has been suggested that mergers may amplify the magnetic field and be responsible for the strong radio haloes and relics ( tribble 1993 ; roettiger et al .",
    "the nw bright radio relic in a2256 appears to be located near the moving path of the subcluster , thus it is likely associated with the ongoing merger event .",
    "finally , the temperature map excludes any significant disturbance of the cluster , indicating that the merger with the subcluster is at very early stage .",
    "observations of the merging cluster a2256 confirm some of our previous understanding on it , but also reveal some new phenomena .",
    "our results are summarized below :    \\1 ) a new structure ( `` shoulder '' ) was found @xmath24 east of the peak of the main cluster . it is shown as an extension from the main cluster peak but with local maximum . several galaxies ( a , d and h in fig .",
    "2 ) are near or apparently within it , but the physical association is hard to be established .",
    "the position is also roughly at the center of a low - brightness radio relic .",
    "this feature is also characterized by a high iron abundance ( @xmath1 1 after decomposition ) .",
    "its temperature is comparable to or somewhat lower than that of the surrounding .",
    "the gas mass within this structure is about 2@xmath210@xmath3 m@xmath4 .",
    "we suggest that it is either a relic of a prior merger or an internal structure of the main cluster .",
    "\\2 ) the subcluster was found to have a higher abundance ( @xmath1 0.6 ) , but a lower temperature ( 4.5 - 5 kev ) than the main cluster ( 0.2 - 0.3 and @xmath1 7 kev respectively ) .",
    "its characteristics resemble some of the poor clusters .",
    "the morphology of the subcluster is distorted , which could be due to the infall .",
    "the central part of the subcluster , as well as the main cluster , show some internal structures .",
    "\\3 ) the brightness profile across the southern edge of the subcluster indicates a density discontinuity and the temperature jump from about 4.5 kev inside the dense gas to about 8.5 kev outside .",
    "this probably indicates a contact the subcluster and the main cluster gases and their relative motion , somewhat similar to a2142 and a3667 ( markevitch et al .",
    "2000 ; vikhlinin et al .",
    "2001a ) , although the geometry is more complex . due to the projection ,",
    "the real moving direction of the whole edge is not easy to be determined and the jumps of density and pressure are hard to be constrained .",
    "\\4 ) the temperature map shows moderate temperature variation across the cluster , but not as strong as expected in a major merger .",
    "the temperature map implies that the subcluster entered the main cluster from somewhere west and the merger is still at the early stage .",
    "the main cluster appears not yet largely disturbed by the merger with the subcluster .",
    "the two hot spots reported by briel & henry ( 1994 ) are not confirmed .",
    "\\5 ) no x - ray enhancement is detected around the two brightest galaxies ( a and b in fig .",
    "2 ; the 3 @xmath26 upper limits are about 2@xmath210@xmath6 ergs s@xmath7 at 0.5 - 10 kev ) around the center of the main cluster .",
    "over 30 point sources were detected in the observations , but only 1/3 of them have optical counterparts ( usually faint ) in the dss ii image .",
    "no significant excess of point sources was found in the field .",
    "three member galaxies near the center , including a radio head - tail source and a dumbbell - like big elliptical , were found to have corresponding x - ray point - like emission .",
