    "the @xmath7 factories have accumulated enough events , which allow precision measurements of exclusive @xmath7 meson decays .",
    "these measurements sharpen the discrepancies between experimental data and theoretical predictions within the standard model , such that some puzzles have appeared . the recently observed direct cp asymmetries and branching ratios of the @xmath0",
    ", @xmath1 decays @xcite , @xmath8 are prominent examples . the expected relations @xmath9 and @xmath10 obviously contradict to the above data . in this work",
    "we shall investigate the indication of eq .",
    "( [ data ] ) , and study whether they can be accommodated in the perturbative qcd approach @xcite .    to explain these puzzles , it is useful to adopt the topological - amplitude parameterization @xcite for these decays .",
    "the most general parameterization of the @xmath11 decay amplitudes is written as @xmath12\\ ; , \\nonumber\\\\ \\sqrt{2}a(b^0\\to \\pi^0\\pi^0)&=&t\\left[\\left ( \\frac{p}{t}-\\frac{p_{ew}}{t}\\right ) e^{i\\phi_2}-\\frac{c}{t}\\right]\\ ; , \\label{mbpi1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 stand for the color - allowed tree , color - suppressed tree , penguin , and electroweak penguin amplitudes , respectively , and @xmath17 is the weak phase defined later . the counting rules in terms of powers of the wolfenstein parameter @xmath18",
    "are then assigned to various decay amplitudes @xcite .",
    "the amplitudes in eq .",
    "( [ mbpi1 ] ) obey the counting rules in the standard model , @xmath19 therefore , the @xmath20 branching ratio is expected to be of @xmath21 of the @xmath22 one .",
    "however , eq .  ( [ data ] ) shows that the former is about of @xmath23 of the latter .",
    "the @xmath0 decay amplitudes are written , up to @xmath21 , as @xmath24\\ ; , \\nonumber\\\\ a(b^0\\to \\pi^- k^+)&=&-p'\\left(1+\\frac{t'}{p'}e^{i\\phi_3}\\right)\\ ; , \\nonumber\\\\ \\sqrt{2}a(b^0\\to \\pi^0k^0)&=&p'\\left(1 -\\frac{p'_{ew}}{p ' } -\\frac{c'}{p'}e^{i\\phi_3}\\right)\\ ; , \\label{mbpp1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the notations @xmath25 @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 bear the meanings the same as for the @xmath11 decays but with primes , and the weak phase @xmath29 is defined via the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix element @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "these amplitudes obey the counting rules , @xmath31 the data @xmath32 implies a sizable relative strong phase between @xmath25 and @xmath27 , which verifies our prediction made years ago using the pqcd approach @xcite .",
    "since both @xmath28 and @xmath26 are subdominant , the approximate equality for the direct cp asymmetries @xmath33 is expected , which is , however , in conflict with the data in eq .",
    "( [ data ] ) dramatically .",
    "it is then natural to conjecture a large @xmath28 @xcite , which signals a new physics effect , a large @xmath26 @xcite , or both @xcite in the @xmath2 decays .",
    "the large @xmath26 proposal seems to be favored by a recent analysis of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 data based on the amplitude parameterization @xcite .",
    "note that the current pqcd predictions for the two - body nonleptonic @xmath7 decays were derived from the leading - order ( lo ) formalism . while lo pqcd implies a negligible @xmath26 , it is possible that this supposedly tiny amplitude may receive a significant subleading correction .",
    "hence , before claiming a new physics signal , one should at least examine whether the next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) effects could enhance @xmath26 sufficiently . in this paper",
    "we shall calculate the important nlo contributions to the @xmath0 , @xmath1 decays from the vertex corrections , the quark loops , and the magnetic penguins .",
    "the higher - power corrections have not yet been under good control , and will not be considered here .",
    "we find that the corrections from the quark loops and from the magnetic penguins , being about 10% of the lo penguin amplitude , decrease only the @xmath2 branching ratios .",
    "the vertex corrections tend to increase @xmath26 by a factor of 3 .",
    "this larger @xmath26 leads to nearly vanishing @xmath34 without changing the branching ratios , which are governed by @xmath27 .",
    "the @xmath0 puzzle is then resolved .",
    "the other nlo corrections , mainly to the @xmath7 meson transition form factors , can be eliminated by choosing an appropriate renormalization scale @xmath35 , @xmath36 being a hadronic scale and @xmath37 the @xmath38 quark mass .",
    "this observation follows the well - known brodsky - lepage - mackenzie ( blm ) procedure @xcite , in which the scale @xmath39 is determined in the way that the vacuum polarization effects are absorbed into the coupling constant @xmath40 .",
    "it has been demonstrated with this procedure that nlo corrections to many exclusive processes are minimized to some extent @xcite .",
    "taking the simple pion form factor as an example , the blm scale has been found to be of the order of the invariant mass of the hard exchanged gluon .",
    "the choice of @xmath39 proposed in the pqcd approach @xcite is basically in agreement with this procedure : the argument @xmath39 of the coupling constant is set to the invariant masses of internal particles , which are of @xmath41 for the @xmath7 meson transition form factors @xcite .",
    "a general feature of the blm scale is that it is always much lower than the external kinematic variable , implying that the smallness of the coupling constant is not the only condition for the applicability of perturbation theory .    as mentioned",
    "before , the observed branching ratio @xmath42 is much larger than the lo pqcd prediction @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "the prediction from qcd - improved factorization ( qcdf ) has the same order of magnitude @xcite . since this mode involves a subdominant color - suppressed tree amplitude as shown in eq .",
    "( [ mbpi1 ] ) , a larger @xmath14 certainly helps to resolve the @xmath11 puzzle .",
    "we also compute the nlo corrections to these decays , and find the similar reduction from the quark loops and the magnetic penguins , which are about 10% of the lo penguin amplitude @xmath15 . since @xmath15 is subdominant ,",
    "the @xmath44 and @xmath45 branching ratios almost remain the same .",
    "the enhancement of @xmath14 from the vertex corrections , leading to @xmath46 , is still not sufficient to account for the data .",
    "we point out that any new mechanism , introduced to resolve this puzzle , must survive the constraint from the tiny observed branching ratios @xcite , @xmath47 the leading pqcd predictions for @xmath48 @xcite and for @xmath49 @xcite have been consistent with the experimental data .",
    "the proposals of final - state interaction @xcite and of the charming penguin in soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) @xcite have not yet been applied to the @xmath50 decay .",
    "we review the lo pqcd predictions for the @xmath0 , @xmath1 decays , including those for the mixing - induced cp asymmetries , in sec .",

    "<S> we calculate the important next - to - leading - order contributions to the @xmath0 , @xmath1 decays from the vertex corrections , the quark loops , and the magnetic penguins in the perturbative qcd approach . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the latter two reduce the leading - order penguin amplitudes by about 10% , and modify only the @xmath2 branching ratios . </S>",
    "<S> the main effect of the vertex corrections is to increase the small color - suppressed tree amplitude by a factor of @xmath3 , which then resolves the large difference between the direct cp asymmetries of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 modes . </S>",
