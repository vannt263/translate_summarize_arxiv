    "an activist tweets a picture and the image spreads through social networks , perhaps going viral ; information enters the brain via sensory neurons and cascades through various kinds of cell before inducing motor neurons to fire ; the plants in an ecosystem are decimated by a drought and the pulse of want travels up through trophic chains until even the top predators are affected . these and many others are examples of spreading processes in complex systems which can be regarded as cascades of activity percolating through directed networks .",

    "a half much work has gone into studying the effect of network topology on dynamical processes of various kinds.@xcite one of the first widely acknowledged consequences of the small - world property famously described by watts and strogatz@xcite was that epidemics could spread rapidly through social networks because of just a few long - range connections.@xcite subsequent work on epidemic models has revealed a rich relationship between network structure and spreading.@xcite for instance , the phenomenon of ` complex contagion ' , which centola showed experimentally to play a part in online social networks,@xcite has recently been investigated mathematically on clustered network models.@xcite network structure is also important in models of opinion formation,@xcite and in this context the ` q - voter model ' captures the idea of complex contagion.@xcite activity on neural networks , while not usually studied as spreading processes , has also been shown , in simple models , to depend fundamentally on topological properties , such as degree heterogeneity,@xcite assortativity,@xcite and clustering.@xcite furthermore , much research has focused on mapping the structure of biological neural networks , and understanding how such topologies arise.@xcite    ` trophic coherence ' , a measure of how neatly food webs or other directed networks fall into well - defined trophic levels , has recently been shown to play a key role in the dynamical stability of ecosystems.@xcite such is the influence of this topological property that sufficiently coherent networks can become more stable with increasing size and complexity , thereby offering a solution to may s paradox.@xcite it has also been suggested that the trophic coherence of ecosystems may have contributed to the devastating effect that human expansion had on pleistocene megafauna.@xcite but it is not only food webs which exhibit a significantly non - random trophic structure : this characteristic has recently been shown to determine properties such as eigenspectra,@xcite feedback,@xcite directionality,@xcite and intervality@xcite in a wide variety of biological and artificial networks , including those of gene transcription , neurons , metabolites , cellular signalling , concatenated words , p2p users and world trade.@xcite    in this paper we show that trophic coherence also affects spreading processes .",
    "we consider two seemingly rather different models , one a version of the susceptible - infected - susceptible ( sis ) epidemic model@xcite extended to account for complex contagion,@xcite and the other an amari - hopfield neural network.@xcite    to generate directed networks with tunable trophic coherence we propose a variation of the ` preferential preying ' model ( ppm ) used by johnson _",
    "et al._@xcite , with the difference that this version limits in random graphs instead of acyclic ` cascade model ' networks , and is therefore less specific to food webs and perhaps more appropriate for investigating generic directed networks .",
    "our numerical study reveals that trophic coherence can determine whether a pulse of activity in either model will propagate through the entire network or remain confined to a small fraction of nodes , or become endemic as opposed to dying out soon after initiation .",
    "we conclude with some open questions and our assessment of the main areas where theoretical research might provide important insights .",
    "let us consider a directed network given by the @xmath0 adjacency matrix @xmath1 , with elements @xmath2 if there is a directed edge from node @xmath3 to node @xmath4 , and @xmath5 if not .",
    "the in- and out - degrees of node @xmath4 are @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "the number of edges is @xmath8 , and the mean degree is @xmath9 .",
    "we shall assume that the network is weakly connected , and that there is a number @xmath10 of nodes with @xmath11 , which we shall refer to as _",
    "basal nodes_. it is standard in ecology to define the _ trophic level _",
    "@xmath12 of nodes as @xmath13 if @xmath14 , or @xmath15 if @xmath16 .",
    "in other words , the trophic level of basal nodes ( autotrophs in the ecological context ) is @xmath17 by convention , while other nodes ( consumer species ) are assigned the mean trophic level of their in - neighbours ( resources ) , plus one .",
    "@xcite thus , for any directed network in which every node is on at least one directed path originating at a basal node , the trophic level of each node is a topological feature easily obtained by solving the linear system of eq .",
    "( [ eq_si ] ) . in a recent paper , johnson _",
    "et al._@xcite characterise each edge in an network with a _ trophic distance _ : @xmath18 ( not a distance in the mathematical sense since it can take negative values ) .",
    "they then consider the distribution of trophic distances over the network , @xmath19 , which will always have mean @xmath20 .",
    "the homogeneity of @xmath19 is called _ trophic coherence _ : the more similar the trophic distances of all the edges , the more coherent the network . as a measure of coherence",
    ", one can simply use the standard deviation of @xmath19 , which is referred to as an _ incoherence parameter _ : @xmath21 .    when applied to food webs",
    " networks of who eats whom in an ecosystem  it turns out that trophic coherence is the best statistical predictor of linear stability.@xcite furthermore , a simple model which generates networks with tunable coherence shows that this property can allow for systems to become more stable with size and edge density  which suggests a solution to may s paradox , or why large , complex ecosystems are observed to be the most stable.@xcite by defining the _ coherence ensemble _ , it has recently been shown@xcite that trophic coherence is a key factor determining the cycle structure and distribution of eigenvalues in directed networks , and that it is possible to compare the empirical value of @xmath22 for a given network to its random expectation , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the number of edges connected to basal nodes .",
    "it turns out that certain kinds of biological networks , such as food webs , some gene regulatory networks , or the _ c. elegans _ neural network , are significantly coherent ( @xmath25 ) ; while others , most notably metabolic networks , are less coherent than the random expectation ( @xmath26).@xcite    figure [ fig_pic1 ] displays two small networks which differ only in their trophic coherence : the one on the left is maximally coherent ( @xmath27 ) , while the one on the right is more incoherent ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "even the one on the right , however , is more coherent than the corresponding random expectation ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "note that the difference between the two networks is apparent thanks to the nodes being plotted on a vertical axis representing trophic level ",
    "when this information is not highlighted in the visualisation , significantly coherent networks can appear no different from incoherent ones to the naked eye . from the network on the left ,",
    "it is clear that a maximally coherent network is also multipartite ( or bipartite in the case of having only two trophic levels ) .",
    "thus , trophic coherence can be regarded as the extent to which a network approaches this state of order , much as modularity is a measure of how close an undirected network is to being disconnex.@xcite    it is not yet known what mechanisms lead to trophic coherence  or incoherence  in directed networks .",
    "one possibility is that edges are formed preferentially between nodes with specific functions , which in turn are correlated with trophic level .",
    "for instance , in an ecosystem the biomass is produced by the plants and flows up the food chain through herbivores , primary carnivores , and secondary carnivores until it reaches the apex predators .",
    "likewise , information enters a neural network via sensory neurons , and is passed on to interneurons and other cells with various processing functions before reaching the motor neurons . on the other hand , since trophic coherence is related to several other structural and dynamical properties , it may be that in certain systems topologies are selected for their stability , robustness or feedback characteristics , and coherence is a secondary effect .",
    "be this as it may , the networks observed to exhibit this feature tend to be involved in the transport of some quantity  such as energy or information  through a system .",
    "in this paper we therefore explore the effects of trophic coherence on spreading processes , and find that it plays an important role , in some circumstances inducing transitions between qualitatively different regimes of dynamical behaviour .",

    "proceed to introduce @xmath38 non - basal nodes sequentially ; each of these has , at this stage , only one in - neighbour , chosen randomly from among the extant nodes ( basal and non - basal ) already in the network when it arrives . at the end of this step , each node @xmath4 has a preliminary trophic level , @xmath39 , as given by eq .",

    "the second step is to introduce the remaining @xmath40 edges needed to make up a total of @xmath41 . for this , each pair of nodes @xmath42 such that @xmath4 is a non - basal node is attributed a tentative trophic distance @xmath43 .",
    "edges between pairs are then placed with a probability proportional to @xmath44 ,   \\label{eq_plink}\\ ] ] until there are @xmath41 edges in the network , and therefore a mean degree of @xmath45 . as in the original ppm , the ` temperature ' parameter @xmath30 tunes the degree of trophic coherence , with @xmath46 yielding maximally coherent networks ( @xmath27 ) , and incoherence increasing monotonically with @xmath30 .",
    "the specific choice for the edge probability is arbitrary , but the form in eq .",
    "( [ eq_plink ] ) is conducive to a gaussian distribution of distances @xmath47 , which we have found to be a good fit to empirical data on several kinds of networks .",
    "the relationship between @xmath30 and @xmath22 in networks thus generated is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_qvt ] . at low @xmath30",
    "we observe that @xmath48 , while the coherence saturates to the randomly expected value at higher @xmath30 .    the main difference between the model described above and the original ppm as implemented by johnson _",
    "et al._@xcite  and also by domnguez - garca _ et al .",
    "_ in this same issue@xcite  is in the networks generated at high @xmath30 .",
    "both models generate maximally coherent networks when @xmath49 . however , when @xmath50 , the original version coincides with both the ` generalised cascade model ' , and with the ` generalised niche model ' when its parameter @xmath51 , a limiting behaviour which makes for useful comparisons in the context of food webs.@xcite ( these food - web models are based on a ` niche axis ' , defined by a random number given at the outset to each node : in the generalised cascade model , the in - neighbours of node @xmath4 are attributed randomly from nodes with lower niche values than @xmath4 ; the ` niche model ' imposes the additional constraint that in - neighbours must be contiguous on the niche axis ; and the generalised niche model interpolates between the two with a parameter @xmath52 . ) the version of the ppm which we now put forward generates networks which approach directed erds - rnyi random graphs at high temperature .",
    "in fact , at @xmath50 , the networks generated are the overlap of two graphs : a `` skeleton '' with @xmath38 edges , which ensures that the network is weakly connected ; and a directed random graph with @xmath40 edges , and the constraint that @xmath37 nodes have @xmath11 .",
    "the spreading of some form of activity through a system has been extensively studied in a wide variety of settings , most notably in percolation theory.@xcite examples include epidemics,@xcite opinions,@xcite forest - fires,@xcite trophic cascades,@xcite and avalanches of neural activity.@xcite with a view to exploring the influence of trophic coherence on how activity of some kind spreads through a system , we consider two different paradigms : a model of complex contagion , and an amari - hopfield neural - network model .",
    "our first model is an adaptation of the standard susceptible - infected - susceptible ( sis ) epidemic model,@xcite in which each node @xmath4 in a network is characterised at time @xmath53 by a binary variable @xmath54 , which can be in either of two states : ` susceptible ' ( @xmath55 ) or ` infected ' ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "our version of this model will take into account the phenomenon of `` complex contagion '' , whereby the probability of an element becoming ` infected ' can be a non - linear function of the proportion of its neighbours who are already ` infected ' .",
    "centola has shown that social reinforcement plays a key role in the adoption of behaviour by participants in an online experiment,@xcite and theoretical research has recently highlighted how network clustering can influence this kind of spreading process.@xcite we consider that , at each time step @xmath53 , each ` susceptible ' node @xmath4 has a probability of becoming ` infected ' given by @xmath57=f_i(t)^\\alpha , \\label{eq_fa}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the fraction of @xmath4 s in - neighbours ( i.e. of those nodes @xmath3 such that @xmath2 ) which are in the ` infected ' state at time @xmath53 ( @xmath59 ) , and @xmath60 is a parameter which determines the kind of complex contagion . a node",
    "which is ` infected ' at time @xmath53 automatically becomes ` susceptible ' again at time @xmath61 : @xmath62=1,\\ ] ] and all nodes are updated in parallel .",
    "the essence of complex contagion is captured also by the ` q - voter model ' of opinion dynamics,@xcite a generalization of the well - known voter model@xcite in which the probability of an agent updating its state depends on there being a consensus among @xmath22 of its neighbours .",
    "the second model we consider is an amari - hopfield neural network , in which nodes are binary variables with states @xmath63 representing the fact that , in a given time window , a neuron can either fire an action potential , or not.@xcite nodes are updated in parallel according to the probability @xmath64=\\frac{1}{2}\\left\\lbrace\\pm\\tanh\\left[\\beta h_i(t ) \\right ]   + 1\\right\\rbrace ,   \\label{eq_pv}\\ ] ] where the field at @xmath4 is @xmath65 and the parameter @xmath66 sets the degree of stochasticity .",
    "( note that the expression for @xmath67 usually takes into account the effects of `` synaptic weights '' which can be used to store information in the network , but for this work we are considering all the weights to be equal . )",
    "although real neurons exhibit far richer behaviour than this simple model would suggest , for many purposes collections of binary neurons are found to yield results qualitatively similar to those of more realistic models.@xcite",
    "in order to investigate numerically the effects of trophic coherence on spreading processes , we generate networks with given number of nodes @xmath68 , basal nodes @xmath37 , and edges @xmath41 as specified above , and carry out monte carlo runs of each of our dynamical models for different values of the parameter @xmath30 ",
    "i.e. for different degrees of trophic coherence . for the complex contagion model , the initial condition is to set all nodes to ` susceptible ' except for the basal nodes , which are all ` infected ' ; that is , @xmath69 if @xmath70 , and @xmath71 if @xmath11 . for each run",
    "we measure the _ duration _ of the infection , that is , the number of time steps until no nodes are ` infected ' ; as well as the _ incidence _ , or proportion of nodes which have at any time been in the ` infected ' state .",
    "figure [ fig_traj](a ) shows the mean incidence against @xmath30 for various values of @xmath60 . on highly coherent networks ( @xmath72 )",
    "the infection spreads to the whole system for any @xmath60 . on less coherent topologies , however , whether contagion is sub- or super - linear has a strong influence on spreading : for @xmath73 the infection only reaches a fraction of the network , while for @xmath74 the effect of coherence on incidence is non - monotonic . in fig .",
    "[ fig_traj](b ) , where the mean incidence is plotted against @xmath60 for different values of @xmath30 , we can see how the effect of @xmath60 on spreading is modulated by topology , becoming less severe the more coherent the networks .",
    "hence , it is the interplay of both the trophic coherence of the underlying network , and the form of the infection probability , which determines whether the infection can spread .",
    "we also perform a similar investigation of the amari - hopfield neural model on networks generated in the same way .",
    "now we set all the basal nodes initially to ` firing ' [ i.e. @xmath75 if @xmath76 , and all other nodes to ` not firing ' [ @xmath77 if @xmath78 . the duration is now the number of time steps to ensue before all the nodes are in the ` not firing ' state , and the incidence is the proportion of nodes which at any moment during this period adopted the ` firing ' state . as with the infection , whether this pulse will propagate throughout the whole network is determined by both the neural dynamics , as parametrised by @xmath66 ; and the trophic coherence of the network .",
    "figure [ fig_traj](c ) shows the mean incidence against @xmath30 for several values of @xmath66 , while fig .",
    "[ fig_traj](d ) has @xmath66 on the x - axis for various values of @xmath30 . despite the different dynamics , the curves bear a resemblance to the cases in panels ( a ) and ( b ) . in both cases , a high trophic coherence ( @xmath79 )",
    "can ensure that the pulse of activity will reach most of the network irrespectively of other parameters , whereas if the network is incoherent ( @xmath80 ) propagation requires low @xmath60 ( for the complex contagion model ) or low @xmath66 ( in the neural network ) .",
    "figure [ fig_heatmaps ] displays heat - maps for the complex contagion case [ panels ( a ) and ( b ) ] and the neural - network model [ panels ( c ) and ( d ) ] . panels ( a ) and ( c ) show the mean incidence against @xmath30 and the relevant model parameter ( @xmath60 for the complex contagion and @xmath66 for the neural network ) , while panels ( b ) and ( d ) show the logarithm of the duration against the same parameters .",
    "we run the simulations for a maximum of @xmath81 monte carlo steps , so duration above this can mean either a long but eventually finite ( transient ) period of activation , or an endemic state in which a degree of activity remains indefinitely .    by comparing incidence and duration",
    ", we can discern that both models exhibit three qualitatively different regimes of behaviour : at high @xmath30 and high @xmath60 or @xmath66 , activity dies out quickly without reaching most of the system ; at high @xmath30 and low @xmath60 or @xmath66 , activity spreads to the whole system and remains indefinitely ; at low @xmath30 , activity spreads to the whole system and then dies out quickly .",
    "we can refer to these regimes as _ inactive _ , _ endemic _ , and _ pulsing _ , respectively .",
    "the main qualitative difference between the behaviour of the two models regards the endemic regime .",
    "in the complex contagion case , this regime is confined to sufficiently incoherent networks , and its range increases monotonically with @xmath30 . in the neural network",
    "it occurs for any @xmath30 if @xmath82 , and the range is non - monotonic with @xmath30 , peaking at intermediate values of @xmath30 .",
    "why does trophic coherence affect spreading processes as described , and in such similar ways for both kinds of dynamics ?",
    "let us consider first the case of complex contagion on a perfectly coherent network ( low @xmath30 ) , like the one in fig .",
    "[ fig_pic1](a ) .",
    "if the basal nodes are all initially infected , then we have from eq .",
    "( [ eq_fa ] ) that in the next time step the probability of infection for nodes at level @xmath83 is @xmath84 , for any @xmath60 , and thus the infection moves up a level . by the same process , one time step later the infection moves to level @xmath85 , and continues to spread in this way until it has reached the whole system  at which point the infection dies out . on an incoherent network ( high @xmath30 ) , like the one in fig .",
    "[ fig_pic1](b ) , as the pulse of activity moves up the trophic levels , the fraction of infected in - neighbours affecting a given node @xmath4 , @xmath86 , becomes lower with increasing @xmath12 .",
    "hence , if the network is insufficiently coherent , the pulse will die out as it progresses up the levels , and only reach a finite fraction of the nodes .",
    "this explains why the pulsing regime occurs at low @xmath30 .",
    "according to eq .",
    "( [ eq_pv ] ) , the above considerations apply also to the neural - network model at low @xmath30 when @xmath66 is sufficiently high that the probability of a node being activated when all its in - neighbours are active is @xmath87 .    for the complex contagion to become endemic ,",
    "given that nodes recover immediately after infection , there must be some degree of feedback .",
    "in other words , the network must have cycles . as",
    "johnson & jones have shown,@xcite the expected number of cycles in a network is a function of its trophic coherence , and for @xmath22 below a particular value ( which depends on other topological properties ) , networks are almost always acyclic .",
    "this accounts for an endemic phase which grows in range with @xmath30 .",
    "however , the extent of node re - infection will depend on both the density of cycles , and the probability that a node becomes infected by a given proportion of infected in - neighbours , as determined by eq .",
    "( [ eq_fa ] ) ; re - infection is therefore more likely at lower @xmath60 . again",
    "this argument can be extended to the neural - network model , with a caveat . in the complex contagion model ,",
    "a node must have at least one infected in - neighbour to become infected , so the endemic regime requires cycles .",
    "in the neural network , however , for any finite @xmath66 there exists a probability of spontaneous node activation . for low enough @xmath66 ,",
    "the system enters the standard paramagnetic ( or memoryless ) phase of the model , with continuous , random activation of nodes .",
    "this explains why the endemic regime of the neural model extends to the full range of @xmath30 for low @xmath66 .",
    "finally , the non - monotonic dependence of the endemic regime with @xmath30 in the neural model seems to be caused by a balance between the two mechanisms we have described for activity propagation : a rapid pulse which can travel on coherent networks , and the reverberation allowed for by the cycles of incoherent ones .",
    "it is perhaps noteworthy that this effect of feedback in the neural model is similar to the mechanism of ` cluster reverberation ' put forward to explain short - term memory.@xcite    to conclude we look into the effects of network size and of the proportion of basal nodes .",
    "figure [ fig_rev_traj ] shows how incidence depends on @xmath30 when we fix @xmath88 for the complex contagion model [ fig .",
    "[ fig_rev_traj](a ) ] , and @xmath89 in the neural network [ fig .",
    "[ fig_rev_traj](b ) ] .",
    "results are presented for three network sizes ( @xmath34 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 ) , and two ratios @xmath92 and @xmath93 . in the complex contagion model the lines for different @xmath68 but fixed basal ratio collapse , and there is only a small effect of the basal ratio on the incidence at high @xmath30 . in the neural network",
    "there is a much more pronounced influence of the proportion of basal nodes : at high @xmath30 , a ratio @xmath92 allows for spreading to reach the whole system when this is not possible if @xmath94 .",
    "this may be a consequence of the dependence of the mean trophic level on this ratio,@xcite which for random graphs has an expected value @xmath95 .",
    "when @xmath94 , the non - monotonicity of incidence with @xmath30 is also exacerbated slightly by @xmath68 .",
    "we have shown that the trophic coherence of directed networks can have an important influence on spreading processes taking place thereon .",
    "in particular , our numerical investigation of two seemingly quite different dynamics  one a model inspired by epidemics , the other a neural - network model originally put forward to explain associative memory ",
    "indicates that this topological feature is relevant for any system in which some kind of signal is transmitted between elements in such as way that these signals interact .",
    "we do not yet have an analytical theory able to describe spreading as a function of trophic coherence , but it is clear that such a theory should take into account two effects : the transmission of pulses of synchronous activity which can occur on highly coherent topologies ; and the maintenance of endemic states enabled by feedback loops on incoherent networks .",
    "trophic coherence has already been shown to play an important role in determining various features of directed networks , such as linear stability,@xcite feedback,@xcite and intervality.@xcite we add here to such work by showing that spreading processes are also strongly influenced by this recently identified topological feature , and submit that more research is required to determine its relationship to other network properties , to build a generalised understanding of its bearing on dynamical processes , and to discover by what mechanisms non - trivial coherence or incoherence comes about in nature .",
