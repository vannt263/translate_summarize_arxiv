    "my connection with george preston extends back to my doctoral student days at caltech .",
    "my doctoral thesis at caltech ( with jeremy mould as advisor ) was on the abundances and kinematics of k giants in the galactic bulge , and i took data on the then newly commissioned 100-inch du pont telescope at las campanas .",
    "the carnegie director was george preston ; i enjoyed substantial allocations of observing time , although much time was lost to the clouds and winds of june and july , typical for the chilean winter . without his support and",
    "that of the outstanding personnel at las campanas , and without steve shectman s shectograph instrument , my career in astronomy would not have been possible .",
    "the most distinct difference between the las campanas of `` then '' and now is that communication with the outside world was by shortwave radio , only .",
    "it was possible to phone to the us only be calling by radio the pasadena headquarters , where a `` phone patch '' connected one to the us mainland .",
    "there was , of course , no internet connection .",
    "cloudy nights were spent either reading the literature , or browsing a two foot deep pile of new yorker magazines in the 100-inch library .",
    "las campanas was truly a world unto itself , with its own generators , no phone lines , and link to the world via carryall and shortwave radio .",
    "my other recollection was the warmth and self - effacing character of george preston , which contrasted so strongly with other senior astronomers of the time .",
    "while maintaining the highest standards of scientific and administrative excellence , he was able to laugh at himself and never took himself too seriously .",
    "george could turn any situation into a good chuckle . as a southern california native ,",
    "i did not know much about driving in snow .",
    "george watched me attempting to back out of a parking space and navigate the ( then ) newly paved roads of las campanas - all this , after one of the winter snows that sometimes hit chile that time of year .",
    "i finally managed to complete the vehicular maneuvers , while george enjoyed a good belly laugh .",
    "there is a serious side to all of this , though .",
    "george s model of scientific achievement and genuine discovery at epochal levels , combined with modest , warmth , and accessibility to young people , is one our field of today could sorely use .",
    "the dominance of m giants in the galactic bulge has been one of the longest established facts regarding that stellar population ; it was first noted in the objective prism surveys of nassau & blanco ( 1958 ) .",
    "when blanco moved to cerro tololo , among the first projects to be undertaken was use of the prime focus grism at the 4 m telescope to obtain low dispersion classification spectra of fields in the magellanic clouds and the galactic bulge ; it was almost immediately discovered that the bulge was completely dominated by m giants and lacked carbon stars , in contrast to the magellanic clouds .",
    "victor and betty blanco made a critical contribution that fueled an important surge in the understanding of the agb phase of evolution , and it is one that continues to have impact today .",
    "blanco , mccarthy , & blanco ( 1984 ) obtained spectral types for m giants in the bulge , _ and _ precise coordinates .",
    "they did the same for the magellanic clouds as well .",
    "it was this work that enabled the landmark paper of frogel & whitford ( 1987 ) on the infrared properties of the m giant population ( and leading to the bolometric magnitudes and effective temperatures of the stars , relative to the globular cluster population ) .",
    "it is noteworthy that the deep understanding of the agb phase , along with important theoretical work ( e.g. iben & renzini 1983 ) began a trajectory of research that has impact on the understanding of high redshift galaxies .",
    "it will also come to the fore when the james webb space telescope undertakes studies of nearby stellar populations .",
    "thanks to the `` low technology '' of the spectral classification from the grism spectra , and hand - measured astrometric positions , the raw material for this surge in knowledge was in place . suddenly , one had in place coordinates for late type stars in globular clusters , the bulge ( metal rich and old ) and the magellanic clouds ( intermediate age ) .",
    "all of this came online just as infrared measurements became widely available , and aaronson , mould , and frogel were able to write their series of important papers .",
    "motivated by the copious numbers of m giants in the bulge , mould ( 1983 ) used the population to measure the first velocity dispersion ( from las campanas , with the du pont telescope ) .",
    "shortly afterward , sharples , walker & cropper ( 1990 ; swc90 ) used the first aat fiber - fed spectrograph to measure 239 radial velocities for blanco m giants in baade s window .",
    "had it not been for the grism spectra and the precise coordinates measured from photographic plates , this project would have been impossible .",
    "in fact , despite the ease with which bulge m giants could be identified and applied as kinematic probes , progress stalled for 15 years ; no attempt was made to do multi - object spectroscopy on k- or m- giants in the galactic bulge , save for the innovative fabry - perot imaging technique using a ca triplet line ( rangwala & williams 2009 ) .",
    "the author conceived the brava project ( rich et al .",
    "2007a ; rich et al . 2009 ) because the 2mass survey provided an unlimited database of bulge m giants with excellent positions , and the stars are surprisingly bright in the i band ( the brightness distribution of the swc90 sample peaks at i=13 , for baade s window ) .",
    "the tio bands and ca infrared triplet are superb for cross correlation at a wide range of spectral resolutions .",
    "our team employed the ctio 4 m hydra echelle spectrograph in its low resolution mode , affording spectroscopy of @xmath9 stars at each pointing . because of concerns about strong night sky lines in the ca triplet region ( with consequent subtraction issues using fibers ) the initial datasets stopped blueward of the ca triplet .",
    "however , from 2007 onward , all data included at least one of the ca infrared triplet lines .",
    "the primary goal of brava is to provide a fundamental dataset of m giant kinematics that extends over as much of the bulge as possible .",
    "easily selected from the red giant branch ( figure 1 ) the m giant sample suffers less potential contamination than the red clump because of the sloping nature of the red giant branch , that permits a well defined selection region .",
    "the final positions of fields with data are shown in figure 2 .",
    "although there have been serious efforts made to compare bulge datasets with dynamical models ( beaulieau et al . 2000 ) , the pne used in that study might suffer from disk population contamination , and are in any case few in number ( 1000 vs the 10,000 star sample of brava ) .    a secondary goal of brava , as mentioned in the title , is a survey of the bulge to characterize the element abundances of the stars .",
    "this part of brava is being led by christian johnson , and will result in new determinations for alpha and heavy element abundances along the bulge minor and major axes , and in the thick disk . at present",
    ", observations of roughly 500 stars in 3 fields along the major axis have been obtained ; the plaut field has been analyzed and is reported in the literature ( johnson et al . 2011 ) .",
    "broadly speaking , we note a bulge as a central concentration that is accompanied by a disk or dust lane",
    ". an elliptical galaxy , or s0 , with no hint of dust and star formation does not properly have a bulge ; it is a spheroid .",
    "m104 has a bulge , because it also has a disk of dust and star formation .",
    "however , the bulge of m104 so dominates that galaxy and extends into the halo , that one might consider it properly to be a bulge / halo with a weak disk , rather than a kind of spiral galaxy .    within spiral galaxies ,",
    "we now distinguish between classical bulges and pseudo - bulges , a class that also includes bars ( kormendy & kennicutt 2004 ) .",
    "our milky way is likely a galaxy that hosts a pseudo - bulge .    the modern theory of bulge formation is basically divided between two broad ideas .",
    "the merger - driven early bulge , driven by the baryonic processes associated with the accretion of major clumps of dark matter and gas ( e.g. abadi et al . 2003 ; elmegreen et al .",
    "this is the a more modern version of the classical eggen , lynden - bell , & sandage ( 1962 ) model that involved violent relaxation .",
    "the merger - driven model is understood within the context of the lcdm galaxy formation picture .",
    "the second broad class of models is those involving secular evolution ( combes & sanders 1981 ; raha et al .",
    "1991 ; norman et al . 1996",
    "; athanassoula 2005 ) .",
    "these models transform a massive disk into a bar via dynamical processes alone .",
    "the evolution can be simulated via n - body models .",
    "one new twist has been added by saha et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , in which the formation of a rapidly rotating bar spins up an existing `` classical '' bulge to the point where cylindrical rotation ( normally only seen in bars ) occur in the classical bulge .",
    "it is noteworthy that the classical bulge formation models invoke mergers and star formation , while the n - body models are purely dynamical , with the exception of the combes ( 2009 ) model in which a bar can be resurrected by the inflow of gas to form a massive disk .",
    "however , one key element missing from those models is `` gastrophysics '' .",
    "for example , while we know that the bulge is a bar , we also know that it has an abundance gradient - a feature that can not occur via dynamical processes alone",
    ". the physical processes that are likely to be responsible for the gradient are supernovae and the outflow of metal enriched winds , along with dissipation of the gas from which these generations of stars are formed .",
    "n - body models do not presently include these baryonic processes .",
    "the bulge region has been long known to have a barred potential ( e.g. blitz & spergel 1991 ; burton & liszt 1993 ) and an asymmetric structure in the infrared , suggestive of a bar with a long axis at an angle of @xmath10 from the line of sight between the sun and the galactic center .",
    "the bulge is dominated by an old ( @xmath1110 gyr ) population ( terndrup 1988 ; ortolani et al .",
    "1995 ; kuijken & rich 2002 ; zoccali et a. 2003 ; clarkson et al . 2008 , 2011 ) with any young population in the bulge being @xmath12 mass , by fraction , and likely less ( figure 3 ) . the small population of stars securely identified as lying brighter than the globular cluster - age turnoff are likely blue stragglers ; clarkson et al .",
    "( 2011 ) shows that least half are true blue stragglers , with examples of clear w uma variability .",
    "the metallicity distribution was first defined at low resolution by rich ( 1988 ) and via high resolution spectroscopy mcwilliam & rich ( 1994 ) .",
    "rich ( 1990 ) fit the abundance distribution to the simple model of chemical evolution ; while this is almost certainly an oversimplification , the presumption of an early almost instantaneous burst of star formation being responsible for the enrichment remains as the guiding principle for the bulge s chemical evolution , to the present day .",
    "recent studies confirm these earlier ones , finding a slightly subsolar mean abundance , and extending to @xmath13 dex at the metal rich end . in the first instance ,",
    "when baade discovered large numbers of rr lyrae stars in the bulge , it was considered to be metal poor and globular cluster - like . the perception then swung to metal rich . in reality",
    ", one may describe its abundance distribution as being like the disk , but more broad , extended both to lower and higher metallicities . as mcwilliam & rich ( 1994 ) first pointed out , and is confirmed by many other studies ( e.g. fulbright , mcwilliam , & rich 2006 , 2007 ) , the bulge stars are generally enhanced in alpha elements ; ballero et al .",
    "( 2007 ) argue that this is consistent with early , rapid , enrichment .",
    "as pointed out for bulge stars in baade s window by mcwilliam , fulbright , & rich ( 2010 ) , the [ la / eu ] ratio is close to the ratio consistent with the r - process , i.e enrichment via sne rather than the envelopes of intermediate - mass stars ( figure 4 )    there is also a vertical abundance gradient outside of 500 pc , although there appears to be no gradient within 500 pc ( rich et al .",
    ". early work by terndrup ( 1988 ) and tyson & rich ( 1991 ) found a vertical abundance gradient , and the abundances of red clump stars ( zoccali et al .",
    "2008 ) definitively show a minor axis vertical abundance gradient from @xmath14 to @xmath15 , with a new field ( @xmath16 ; johnson et al .",
    "2011 ; figure 7 ) consistent with the trend .",
    "abundance gradients are seen in edge - on spirals like ngc 4565 ( proctor et al .",
    "2000 ) , which is considered to be a peanut shaped bulge .",
    "surprisingly , prior to the brava survey , only small samples of kinematic probes had been surveyed at optical wavelengths , with the majority of bulge dynamical probes being the oh / ir and sio masers , very late - type stars observed at radio wavelengths .",
    "the new generation of surveys has dramatically altered that situation .",
    "the overall observational picture carries little evidence for any extended star formation history ( e.g. no known thermally pulsing carbon stars ) and the alpha enhancement , supports a @xmath17 gyr burst of star formation during which most of the chemical enrichment of the bulge is thought to have occurred .",
    "although the secular evolution that is thought to produce a massive bar is considered to be more extended in time , that process could also conceivably have occurred within 1 gyr , or the roughly 10 - 20 dynamical times for the inner galaxy .",
    "one recent development has been observational claims for an `` x - shaped '' bulge .",
    "mcwilliam & zoccali ( 2010 ) found a doubling of the red clump in a number of bulge fields .",
    "de propris et al . ( 2011 ; figure 5 ) find no quantitative differences in metallicity or kinematics , across the two clumps . if the doubled clumps have their origin in a purely dynamical process that caused the bar to buckle and the `` x - structure '' to appear , then one might suspect it took place after the bulge stars had already formed , and consequently one would not expect to see differences in metallicity between the two clumps .",
    "however , given the spatial separation , one rather expects to see measurable kinematic differences .",
    "when larger samples are accumulated , the member population of the x - structure should exhibit measurable differences in dynamics , when proper motion data is combined with radial velocities .",
    "because brava surveyed the bulge in a grid spanning both latitude and longitude ( figure 1 ) it has become possible to investigate the rotation field perpendicular to the plane .",
    "the brava survey shows that the bulge departs from pure `` solid body '' rotation ( howard et al .",
    "2008 ) and has cylindrical rotation ( howard et al . 2009",
    "; rich et al . 2008 , 2009 ) , a characteristic of pseudobulges ( kormendy & kennicutt 2004 ) .",
    "the rotation field for the @xmath14 and @xmath16 slices is the same .",
    "the survey has now covered most of the southern half of the bulge , and none of the fields shows clear evidence for cold streams .",
    "the most significant result ( figure 6 ) indicates that the fraction of the bulge mass in a `` classical '' non - barred configuration must be @xmath18 ( shen et al .",
    "analysis of new data by kunder et al .",
    "( 2011 ) confirms the cylindrical rotation , finding it for the @xmath19 field as well . an additional result from the brava study places the milky way in the binney plot ( figure 7 ) and it falls next to",
    "the well known `` peanut shaped '' bulge galaxy , ngc 4565 , lying slightly above the oblate rotator model line .",
    "it is noteworthy that the posited `` x - shape '' feature in the bulge ( mcwilliam & zoccali 2010 ) emerged early on in n - body simulations ( combes & sanders 1981 ) and is modeled in detail in athanassoula ( 2005 ) .",
    "we find no `` high velocity '' stars in the brava sample .",
    "one field with a promising @xmath20 cold stream was followed up with additional spectroscopy .",
    "the result proved the validity of the central limit theorem , as the possible `` stream '' disappeared when the sample size quadrupled ( howard et al .",
    "2008 ) .    the brava database will be used to constrain a new self - consistent dynamical model along the lines of the one developed by zhao ( 1996 ) . at present , the n - body bar model of shen",
    "et al . ( 2010 ) ; figure 6 is an excellent fit to the radial velocity dataset over the while of the bulge .",
    "the besancon starcount / dynamical model of the milky way is also being adapted to model the brava data ( robin et al .",
    "2012 in prep . ) .",
    "the brava primary kinematic sample is ill - suited for abundance studies because the stars are too red for application of the ca triplet abundance indicator .",
    "the 8430 tio band veils the first two ca infrared triplet lines and renders any ca triplet index measurement useless .",
    "a. koch has been attempting to use the tio bands as a proxy abundance indicator , and has had some modest success in confirming the abundance gradient ( kunder et al .",
    "2011 ) but there is significantly more investigation required before quantitative abundance information can be derived from this feature .    the complete dataset for the brava survey is ultimately going to be maintained on the irsa archive , as well as http://brava.astro.ucla.edu/ ; kunder et al .",
    "( 2011 ) describes the final low resolution brava database .",
    "although not strictly part of the brava survey , we obtained multiobject high resolution echelle spectroscopy of clump giants in the plaut bulge field @xmath21 beginning in 2007 , using the hydra spectrograph at ctio ( johnson et al .",
    "note that these stars are 2 - 3 mag fainter than the brava primary sample , and are being observed at roughly 6 times as high spectral resolution .",
    "typical exposure times were 8 hours for this sample , as opposed to 1 hr for the brava m giant survey .",
    "we have nearly completed a program to gather similar data in other bulge fields along the minor and major axes .",
    "the new study shows that the suspected abundance gradient found in the outer bulge by zoccali et al",
    ". continues smoothly from @xmath19 to @xmath16 .",
    "this is an important finding ( figure 8) because zoccali s outermost field , at @xmath15 , is arguably quite distant from the nucleus and may have a substantial inner halo representation . in demonstrating that both the @xmath19 and @xmath16 fields follow the general rotation field",
    ", brava shows that at 1 kpc from the nucleus , the population remains bulge - dominated .",
    "a further result is that the the the alpha elements remain elevated 1000 pc from the plane , any gradient in iron notwithstanding .",
    "so the conditions giving rise to the high alpha abundances occurred over the full extent of the bulge ; presumably the bulge formed rapidly , and violently , over that whole volume .",
    "still , the existence of the gradient is consistent with dissipation and possibly winds playing a role in the chemical enrichment history .",
    "note that in the simple model of chemical evolution , winds cause a decline in the mean abundance while preserving the shape ( hartwick 1976 ) .",
    "in fact , the shapes of the abundance distributions look remarkably similar .",
    "this is the first clear demonstration that the alpha enhancement occurs over the entire volume of the bulge / bar , out to a 1 kpc radius .    in the course of the study",
    ", we also analyzed a population of red clump stars that appear to be much closer than the bulge , about 2 kpc distant .",
    "surprisingly , these stars also show elevated alpha abundances and have disk - like metallicity ( reaching + 0.4 dex ) and are kinematically disk like as well .",
    "note that this is _ unrelated _ to the doubled red clump populations , as these stars are both brighter and bluer than those , appearing to fall closer and less reddened than any bulge population",
    ". it will be important to study this population more in the future .",
    "our team is just concluding analysis of the heavy elements .",
    "we are confirming the high eu abundance and r - process - like [ la / eu ] ratios found by mcwilliam , fulbright , & rich ( 2010 ) in baade s window .",
    "we are finding hints of new phenomena , including large scatter in the s - process , perhaps indicative of a late population of agb stars in the metal poor halo .",
    "we believe that the heavy elements will offer us the scalpel needed to explore the 1 gyr time frame in which the bulge enrichment took place .",
    "in the course of a routine verification program with a prototype multiconjugate adaptive optics imager at vlt , ferraro et al .",
    "( 2009 ) discovered that the old , metal rich , globular cluster terzan 5 has a horizontal branch that is clearly bimodal in luminosity .",
    "terzan 5 is remarkable , in that it is @xmath22 ( lanzoni et al .",
    "2010 ) and boasts 34 msec pulsars - roughly 25% of the known total .",
    "initial studies shed some light on the bimodal hb , a phenomenon unprecedented in any other globular cluster .",
    "the brighter hb stars were found to be both more centrally concentrated and more metal rich ( the latter , based on spectroscopy using nirspec at keck ) .",
    "the metallicity difference was significant : the metal rich subgroup was found to have [ fe / h ] @xmath23 , 0.5 dex above the metal poor subgroup .",
    "stellar evolution models require that either the metal rich subgroup be 6 gyr or helium enhanced .",
    "when the sample size was increased , an even more remarkable feature emerged ( origlia et al .",
    "overall , the trend of @xmath6 $ ] vs [ fe / h ] appears bulge - like , but there is striking bimodality in both the iron and alpha abundances ( figure 11 )",
    ". neither subgroup displays the classic na - o anti - correlation that is characteristic of globular clusters .",
    "we can not explain this phenomenon .",
    "we can be certain that it is not the merger of two globular clusters .",
    "the velocities of the two subgroups are identical , as are the dispersions .",
    "there is no known globular cluster at [ fe / h]=+0.3 , so it would be unlikely that the only such cluster in the milky way merged with with another metal rich cluster .",
    "a possibly more attractive hypothesis is that terzan 5 is not a normal globular cluster at all , and is rather the remnant of some much larger `` building block '' system .",
    "since multiple populations are present , we can appeal to a proto - system that had significantly greater mass , able to contain the enriched gas produced in sne .",
    "ferraro et al .",
    "propose that such special systems might have been the chemical building blocks of the bulge .",
    "we do not observe any tendency toward bimodality in bulge field population , although one could imagine similar systems with a range of properties . in the case of terzan 5",
    ", it would be important to search for heavy element signatures that might be found in bulge field stars . with improved instrumentation",
    ", one might also search for clues in other more subtle measurements , like isotope ratios of mg .",
    "for the moment , terzan 5 remains a fascinating system , and it is difficult to evaluate fully how important the phenomenon is .",
    "the age difference between these two populations is a critical measurement , yet it is also one that time allocation committees have steadfastly refused to support .",
    "so the mystery remains very much unsolved , and may offer new clues to the bulge s formation .",
    "the observational picture of the `` bulge '' or bar is becoming increasingly complicated , and there are a number of contradictions that are difficult to resolve .",
    "the m giant and pne kinematics appear to be consistent with an n - body bar model .",
    "yet a number of studies argue for a much more complicated picture . beginning with zhao , spergel , & rich ( 1994 ) , and then soto et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , the combination of abundances , proper motions , and radial velocities finds stars with metallicity higher than @xmath24 dex exhibit `` vertex deviation '' while the more metal poor stars do not .",
    "that is , when proper motion data are included with radial velocities , stars supporting the bar have a strong correlation between radial velocity and proper motion parallel to the plane .",
    "babusiaux et al .",
    "( 2010 ) confirm the vertex deviation of soto et al .",
    "( 2007 ) with a similar sample size .",
    "however , they find a very strong trend of velocity dispersion with metallicity in baade s window , with the metal rich population having the highest velocity dispersion - a trend not noted in any other population .",
    "their metallicity - velocity dispersion trend becomes flat in the @xmath19 field and reverses at @xmath25 .",
    "it is interesting that johnson et al .",
    "( 2011 ; figure 9 ) finds that same trend in the @xmath4 field . in a dissipative formation picture",
    ", one would expect that the most metal rich population would show the most ordered kinematics ( lowest sigma ) , having formed from the most evolved gas .",
    "it is difficult to understand their trends in baade s window ; babusiaux et al .",
    "( 2010 ) propose that the metal rich `` hot '' population is more concentrated to the plane .",
    "one might appeal to the long flat bar ( e.g. benjamin et al .",
    "2005 ) but that feature is only significant close to the plane",
    ". it would be important to confirm this trend in other bulge fields and to understand why it is not present in the @xmath19 field .",
    "de propris et al .",
    "( 2011 ) also see a strong abundance - kinematics correlation in the sense that metal poor stars have both higher velocity dispersion and slower rotation than the metal rich stars , although this study was at @xmath4 , in a region where babusiaux et al",
    ". did not see their metallicity - velocity dispersion correlation .",
    "i have alluded to another flavor of complexity , and that is in spatial geometry .",
    "the doubling of the red clump and apparent `` x - shaped '' bulge , which has now been confirmed over the entire bulge ( saito et al .",
    "2011 ) . examining the doubled red clump plots in their paper ,",
    "it is clear that the phenomenon is not merely a `` decoration '' but involves a significant fraction of the mass .",
    "it is entirely possible that the x - shaped ( or perhaps `` dog bone '' ) structure is part of the bar s expressed dynamics , and that we will not see strong composition differences in the different populations .",
    "indeed , athanassoula ( 2005 ) argues that the x - shape is characteristic of an edge - on strong bar , and the simulations show that the x - shaped feature is extensive ; her figures are worthy of inspection , and show how strong the x - shaped structure can be in these simulations . if it turns out that the milky way has an x - shaped bulge , as is likely , then one may conclude that the observed dynamics in the brava survey- especially the cylindrical rotation - is a `` genuine '' reflection of a bar , rather than a spun - up classical bulge ( e.g. saha et a. 2011 ) .",
    "as the photometric data improve , it will be vital to fit both the dynamics and the x - structure .",
    "an important future goal will be to apply astrometry and precision spectroscopy to improve the placement of the red clump stars in space .",
    "the proposed japanese infrared counterpart to gaia , called jasmine , is capable of measuring proper motions for every red clump star in the bulge an exercise that of course is possible only in our galaxy .",
    "given the remarkable developments concerning the structure of the bulge , jasmine should now be considered to be a critical mission ; gaia is an optical mission and will not be capable of studying the faint doubled clump population .",
    "yet another proposed form of complexity is the deconvolution of the metallicity distribution function into multiple populations .",
    "considering the sample of 26 microlensed dwarfs studied by many different groups , bensby et al .",
    "( 2011 ) find a bimodal abundance distribution , with solar metallicity stars lacking .",
    "the metal rich peak also includes stars with age ( derived from a spectroscopic parallax ) of @xmath26 gyr , fortuitously coincidental with the age of the younger population in terzan 5 .",
    "the microlensing results could reflect small number statistics , or we might be observing a population mix if the sources are not exactly at the bar center ( if due to microlensing geometry ) .",
    "however , one might expect such strong metallicity bimodality to be observable in the color - magnitude diagram ( note that brown et al .",
    "2010 does see hints of bimodality in the main sequence turnoff , but attributes it to the color - metallicity relation rather than a physical cause ) .    hill et al .",
    "( 2011 ) present a novel deconvolution of the metallicity distribution of k giants ( the original zoccali ( 2008 ) sample ) that approximately recovers the two peaks of bensby s microlensing sample .",
    "however , the _ same _ sub populations appear to correspond to a metal rich `` bar '' population that has a vertex deviation , and a metal poor `` bulge '' population that does not .",
    "indeed , the vertex deviation suddenly setting in at [ fe / h]@xmath27 appears to be consistent with this deconvolution , which is physically supported by the microlensing sample .",
    "however , the strong rotation curve and cylindrical rotation at @xmath4 would appear to contradict the presence of a significant metal poor classical bulge component at 1 kpc , where one expects it to dominate .",
    "as the bulge structure is traced to low surface brightness , one notes boxy isophotes , not the predominance of an @xmath28 bulge .",
    "this issue remains ripe for investigation , and it is completely possible that there are multiple structures all occupying the same volume .",
    "a kind of `` warning '' comes from the studies of @xmath29 cen , that strong population composition differences are not necessarily accompanied by spatial or kinematic differences . and",
    "in our bulge , there may be multiple bars ( as is seen in extragalactic cases ) , and these may not exhibit age or abundance differences .",
    "there is also the preliminary work of the aaomega bulge survey of ness & freeman ( 2012 in preparation ) , that finds an even greater number of subcomponents in the metallicity distribution function .",
    "the hill et al .",
    "( 2011 ) result is noteworthy because the peaks are accompanied by strong kinematic differences .",
    "i have alluded earlier to the issue of the abundance gradient .",
    "the vertical gradient is well established for @xmath30 but appears to be absent from @xmath31 ( rich et al .",

    "2010 ) argue that the fraction of metal rich stars increases inward of baade s window . due to the high extinction",
    ", one must rely on m giants , which give a result at variance with optical studies ; the mean [ fe / h ] is -0.1 , with @xmath32 . while one may appeal to mass loss as the culprit for the unusual m giant abundance distribution , strong depletion of",
    "the red giant branch would require that there be a large population of extreme hb or uv - bright stars ; no such extraordinarily large population seems to be present ( terndrup et al .",
    "2004 ) though the subject is worthy of additional study .",
    "it is difficult to construct an n - body bar scenario with any abundance gradient , much less two regions with different gradients .",
    "ultimately , in considering ascending levels of complexity in the bulge , we will need large samples with distance and composition information .",
    "although the most recent chemical evolution model favors a single , rapid , chemical evolution / formation event ( cescutti & matteucci 2011 ) , and the brava survey is consistent with a rapidly rotating bar , the fact of the vertical abundance gradient and cylindrical rotation are strong indications that the population character and formation history is incredibly complex . not to mention the x - shaped structure .",
    "thus , the metallicity distribution may well be fit by multiple components , and the `` simple '' model of chemical evolution is probably not going to be in serious consideration , going forward .",
    "the brava survey has shown that the kinematics of 10,000 late m giants are consistent with the bulge being dominated by a bar population , with less than 8% of the mass in a `` classical '' non - barred , bulge .",
    "for the first time , we have seen cylindrical rotation in the bulge .",
    "we note similarities to ngc 4565 , which has a peanut - shaped bulge , cylindrical rotation , and an establish abundance gradient in its bulge , perpendicular to the plane ( proctor et al . 2000 ) . considering the strong signatures that the bulge is in fact a bar",
    ", we suspect that the x - shaped structure will not exhibit strong departures in composition or kinematics because it is an expression of the dynamics of the general population . by the same token",
    ", the x - structure poses difficulties for models involving spun up classical bulges , which likely should not have such a structure .",
    "we also observe the signature of rapid bulge formation , alpha enhancement , over the entirety of the bulge s extent- or at least to @xmath4 or 1 kpc .",
    "one question is whether there is an abundance gradient interior to baade s window .",
    "infrared studies ( rich et al . 2005 ; origlia & rich 2007 ) find no abundance gradient in the inner bulge .",
    "it will be vital to verify these findings , as they may give us important clues as to how the bulge formed .",
    "many significant problems remain , especially how it is possible that one observes a strong abundance gradient in a population that exhibits the dynamical characteristics one expects of an n - body bar that has evolved only through dynamical processes .",
    "the bulge continues to be of interest because it is the only such population where one has hope of measuring proper motions , detailed compositions , and even the spatial distribution of the stars .",
    "our bulge / bar offers the best hope of getting deep insight into the formation process of such systems .",
    "new surveys of the bulge are underway .",
    "apogee will examine the northern bulge , and will study m giants in the infrared ; it has begun in 2011 .",
    "another survey at aao ( ness & freeman 2012 ) targets the fainter clump giants .",
    "these surveys will soon superseded brava , adding yet more to our understanding of the bulge .",
    "how much progress in the understanding of the bulge has been made since the beginning of george preston s career , roughly at mid-20th century ?",
    "it is remarkable to consider that baade s ( 1958 ) discovery of rr lyrae stars in the galactic bulge from mt .",
    "wilson was the discovery that defined the bulge as a stellar population ( old , like the globular clusters ) .",
    "it was also the beginning of george preston s career ( and incidentally , the seminal 1957 vatican symposium on stellar populations was held in the year of the author s birth ) .",
    "the presence of _ both _ rr lyrae stars and m giants in the bulge was noted at the vatican symposium , and the bulge was actually not classified with the oldest population ii ( globular clusters ) , but rather with the old disk .",
    "well , as they say , what is old is new again .",
    "bensby et al .",
    "( 2010 ) have suggested that the bulge s abundance pattern is more consistent with the thick disk , and a goal of the abundance survey of brava is to test this hypothesis out by examining the composition of thick disk stars at the distance of the bulge .",
    "we can point at the present time to far greater detail than was imaginable at the start of george s career : color - magnitude diagrams based on proper - motion separation with the hubble space telescope , and composition measurements using infrared echelle spectrographs .",
    "we should not forget the surveys of variable stars and microlensing in the bulge , carried out at las campanas and thanks in part to his encouragement and sponsorship .",
    "as george has so beautifully demonstrated with his high spectral resolution studies of rr lyrae stars across their light curves , the very best data on even so `` mundane '' a topic as nearby rr lyrae stars offers a level of beauty and complexity that pushes beyond the capability of theory to offer an explanation .",
    "we can hope that the next decades will offer data of that quality , in the galactic bulge .",
