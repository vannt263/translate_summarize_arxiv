    "we address the important issue of reconstructing a multidimensional signal from a collection of samples that are noisy and not uniformly spaced . as a case study , we consider a wireless sensor network for environmental monitoring , where the nodes sensing the physical phenomenon ( hereinafter also called field ) are randomly deployed over the area under observation .",
    "the sensors sample a @xmath0-dimensional spatially finite physical field , where @xmath0 may take into account spatial dimensions as well as the temporal dimension .",
    "examples of such fields are pressure or temperature , on a 4-dimension domain , i.e. , three spatial coordinates plus the time dimension .",
    "a spatially finite physical field is not bandlimited , however it admits an infinite fourier series expansion .",
    "here , we consider a finite approximation of the physical field obtained by truncating such series , assuming that the contribution of the truncated terms is negligible .    in our case study",
    ", we assume that the measured samples are transferred from the sensors to a common data - collecting unit , the so - called sink node , which is in charge of reconstructing the field . distributed systems , where in - network processing , is performed are out of the scope of this work .",
    "we do not deal with issues related to information transport and , thus , we assume that all samples are correctly received at the sink node .",
    "the field samples , however , are corrupted by additive i.i.d .",
    "noise , due to quantization , round - off errors or quality of the sensing device .",
    "furthermore , the sampling points are known at the sink node , because _ ( i ) _ either sensors are located at pre - defined positions or their position can be estimated through a localization technique  @xcite , and _",
    "( ii ) _ the sampling time is either periodic or included in the information sent to the sink .",
    "several efficient and fast algorithms have been proposed to numerically reconstruct or approximate a signal in such setting , which amount to the solution of a linear system ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a widely used technique consists in processing the sensors measures by means of a linear filter , which is a function of the system parameters known at the sink .",
    "we observe that the following two major factors affect the linear reconstruction :    * the given machine precision , which may prevent the reconstruction algorithm from performing correctly and may lead to a non - negligible probability of reconstruction failure @xcite , * the noise level affecting the sensors measurements .    in the latter case , a measure of reconstruction accuracy",
    "is given by the mean square error ( mse ) of the field estimate .",
    "in  @xcite , we have found that these issues could be studied by using the eigenvalue distribution of the reconstruction matrix ; however , obtaining such a distribution is still an open problem . in this work ,",
    "we first extend the system model and the problem formulation presented in @xcite to the case of multidimensional fields ( section [ sec : preliminaries ] ) .",
    "then , we derive a closed - form expression of the moments of the eigenvalue distribution , through asymptotic analysis ( section [ sec : moments ] ) . by using the moments expressions",
    ", we prove that the eigenvalue distribution of the matrix representing the sampling system tends to the marenko - pastur distribution @xcite as the field dimension @xmath1 ( section [ sec : approx - distribution ] ) .",
    "we apply our results to the study of the mse of the field estimate , when the sensors measurements are noisy and the reconstruction at the sink is performed through linear filtering .",
    "we generalize the mse expressions to the multidimensional case ( with finite @xmath0 ) , and we show that , by using the marenko - pastur distribution instead of the actual eigenvalue distribution , we obtain an approximation to the mse of the reconstructed field which is very tight for @xmath2 ( section [ sec : exploitation ] ) .    before providing a detailed description of our analysis , in the next section we discuss some related studies and highlight our main contributions with respect to previous work .",
    "relevant to our work is the literature on spectral analysis , where , however , several studies deal with regularly sampled signals ( e.g. ,  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "an excellent guide to irregular sampling is @xcite , which presents a large number of techniques , algorithms , and applications .",
    "reconstruction techniques for irregularly or randomly sampled signals can be found in @xcite , just to name few . in particular , feichtinger and grchenig in",
    "@xcite provide an error analysis of an iterative reconstruction algorithm taking into account round - off errors , jitters , truncation errors and aliasing . from the theoretical point of view , irregular sampling has been studied in @xcite and references therein .    in the context of sensor networks , efficient techniques for spatial sampling",
    "are proposed in  @xcite . in particular , in  @xcite , an adaptive sampling is described , which allows the central data - collector to vary the number of active sensors , i.e. , samples , according to the desired resolution level .",
    "data acquisition is also studied in  @xcite , where the authors consider a unidimensional field , uniformly sampled at the nyquist frequency by low precision sensors .",
    "the authors show that the number of samples can be traded - off with the precision of sensors .",
    "the problem of the reconstruction of a bandlimited signal from an irregular set of samples at unknown locations is addressed in @xcite .",
    "there , different solution methods are proposed , and the conditions for which there exist multiple solutions or a unique solution are discussed . differently from  @xcite , we assume that the sink can either acquire or estimate the sensor locations and that sensors are randomly deployed .",
    "the field reconstruction at the sink node with spatial and temporal correlation among sensor measures is studied , for instance , in @xcite .",
    "other interesting studies can be found in  @xcite , which address the perturbations of regular sampling in shift - invariant spaces  @xcite and the reconstruction of irregularly sampled images in presence of measurement noise  @xcite .",
    "we point out that our main contribution with respect to previous work on signal sampling and reconstruction is the probabilistic approach we adopt to analyze the quality level of a signal reconstructed from a set of irregular , noisy samples .",
    "our analysis , however , applies to sampling systems where the field reconstruction is performed in a centralized manner .",
    "finally , we highlight that our previous work  @xcite assumes that sensors are uniformly distributed over the spatial observation interval and may be displaced around a known average location .",
    "the effects of noisy measures and jittered positions are analyzed when linear reconstruction techniques are employed .",
    "however , only the unidimensional case is studied and semi - analytical derivations of the mse of the reconstructed field are obtained . in @xcite , instead , sensors are assumed to be fixed , and the objective is to evaluate the performance of a linear reconstruction technique in the presence of quasi - equally spaced sensor layouts .      the goal of this work is to provide an analytical study on the reconstruction quality of a multidimensional physical field , with uncorrelated spectrum .",
    "the field samples are ( i ) irregularly spaced , since they are gathered by a randomly deployed sensor network and ( ii ) affected by i.i.d .",
    "the sink node receives the field samples and runs the reconstruction algorithm in a centralized manner .",
    "our major contributions with respect to previous work are as follows .",

    "we apply our results to the study of the quality of a reconstructed field and derive a tight approximation to the mse of the estimated field .",

    "<S> we focus on a multidimensional field with uncorrelated spectrum , and study the quality of the reconstructed signal when the field samples are irregularly spaced and affected by independent and identically distributed noise . </S>",
    "<S> more specifically , we apply linear reconstruction techniques and take the mean square error ( mse ) of the field estimate as a metric to evaluate the signal reconstruction quality . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the mse analysis could be carried out by using the closed - form expression of the eigenvalue distribution of the matrix representing the sampling system . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , such distribution is still unknown . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we first derive a closed - form expression of the distribution moments , and we find that the eigenvalue distribution tends to the marenko - pastur distribution as the field dimension goes to infinity . finally , by using our approach , we derive a tight approximation to the mse of the reconstructed field . </S>"
