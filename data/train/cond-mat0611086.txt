    "the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) effect in quasi - one - dimensional ( 1d ) rings@xcite and , more generally , the adiabatic@xcite and nonadiabatic@xcite berry holonomies manifest nontrivial quantum topology .",
    "recently , this has attracted much attention in mesoscopic transport , exotic particle statistics , and topological quantum computation .",
    "the interest in spintronics , which aims to inject , manipulate , and detect electron spins in electronic devices , has also led many authors to revisit geometric aspects of transport in semiconductors with spin - orbit ( so ) coupling,@xcite mainly focusing on variants of the aharonov - casher ( ac ) effect.@xcite the ac effect in planar structures with rashba so coupling was recently observed in single rings @xcite and ring arrays.@xcite    existing studies of ac related effects in mesoscopic rings focus on spatially homogeneous so coupling.@xcite however , we will show that quantum - interference effects in mesoscopic rings are stronger for spatially varying so interactions in systems smaller than the so precession length ( typically 1  @xmath0 m or longer in inas - based heterostructures).@xcite an inhomogeneous so interaction can be experimentally realized by electrostatic gates in semiconductor nanostructures , as sketched in fig .",
    "electrostatic gates partially covering a planar ring induce an inhomogeneous macroscopic electric field perpendicular to the ring , influencing the electron motion via the spin - orbit interaction . such an inhomogeneous so coupling gives rise to a fictitious magnetic field with @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "in the weak so limit , the corresponding fictitious flux dominates the geometric ac phase .",
    "spin and charge flow in mesoscopic rings can therefore be manipulated by a combination of spatially varying so interactions , which induces fictitious magnetic fields , and weak external magnetic fields .",
    "quantum - interference effects due to so interactions linear in momentum in quasi-1d structures are most conveniently studied with path integrals , see e.g. , ref .  .",
    "this formulation gives a clear physical picture of geometric aspects of spin transport in mesoscopic rings , allowing one to complement and generalize recent discussions on ac phases in multiterminal rings.@xcite the path - integral approach recasts spin transport with arbitrary scalar disorder and smooth so coupling in terms of conventional ab physics for spinless particles and purely geometric @xmath1 phase factors , and is valid , e.g. , for both diffusive and ballistic transport .",
    "not being limited to two - terminal configurations , we will also see that the spin hall effect in four - terminal rings , such as that shown in fig .",
    "[ ex ] , can be mapped onto the usual spinless hall effect .",
    "we consider a ring in the @xmath2 plane as shown in fig .  [ sc ] .",

    "hats denote @xmath7 matrix structure in spin space for spin-@xmath8 particles . in the following",
    ", we will assume a vacuumlike so coupling ( although the arguments hold for any so interaction linear in momentum , such as the dresselhaus so coupling,@xcite ) which can be described by the effective vector potential @xmath9where @xmath10 is the vector potential related to the applied magnetic field , @xmath11 ( disregarding zeeman splitting ) , @xmath12 is a vector of pauli matrices , and @xmath13 is a phenomenological material - dependent so parameter ( in vacuum , @xmath14 , but it is many orders of magnitude larger in narrow - gap semiconductors such as gaas and , especially , inas ) .",
    "@xmath15 can consist of both the applied electric field and the macroscopic band - structure contribution due to the crystal fields .",
    "note that the @xmath16 term in the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) can be absorbed by a redefinition of @xmath6 , since @xmath17 .",
    "electromagnetic @xmath18 gauge invariance for the magnetic component of the effective vector potential @xmath19 gives rise to the ab effect and the @xmath1 gauge symmetry for the spin - dependent component causes the ac effect.@xcite it is useful to define an effective @xmath7 magnetic field , @xmath20 which includes the fictitious so contribution @xmath21 .",
    "note that the fictitious @xmath7 magnetic field @xmath21 vanishes for a spatially homogeneous so interaction .    for the rashba",
    "so coupling,@xcite @xmath22 is along the @xmath23 direction , and , after including the magnitude of @xmath22 into the coefficient @xmath24 , the fictitious field and the associated flux through the ring are given by @xmath25 diagonalization of this flux in spin space determines the spin quantization axis with corresponding fictitious magnetic fluxes of equal magnitude but opposite sign for spins up and down .",
    "for example , if @xmath13 is induced by a top gate at @xmath26 , with @xmath27 under the gate and vanishing outside of the gate , then @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the length of the top gate edge at @xmath30 overlapping the loop area , see fig .  [ sc ] .",
    "we may now navely conclude that the spin - up ( down ) transport is governed by the transport coefficients @xmath31 , with the spin - quantization axis along the @xmath32 axis .",
    "this will be indeed justified below .",
    "@xmath33 can denote any transport coefficients in two- or multiterminal configurations , e.g. , the current response in one contact to voltages applied at two other contacts , as a function of the magnetic flux @xmath34 through the ring , in the absence of the so coupling .",

    "( [ gc ] ) and ( [ gs ] ) , the magnetic flux @xmath35 through the ring can be used to modulate both spin and charge transport and the spin response is proportional to the so coupling .",
    "even such a simple setup , an electrostatic gate partially covering the ring and inducing inhomogeneous so coupling , can thus exhibit nontrivial spintronic applications .",
    "note that the fictitious magnetic field ( [ bf ] ) and the corresponding flux ( [ ff ] ) are relevant only when we are interested in the linear in so coupling effects .",
    "in particular , a homogeneous so coupling @xmath24 induces no fictitious field ( [ bf ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , the noncommutative @xmath7 so vector potential @xmath41 does not allow a removal of the so field by a gauge transformation altogether . the vanishing field ( [ bf ] ) for homogeneous so interactions suggests that the so effects are manifested in transport properties at higher orders in the so strength , as detailed in the following .",
    "in particular , even in the absence of a fictitious field @xmath42 , there is in general a finite effective flux @xmath43 , which in the leading order is quadratic in the so strength .",
    "consequently , for a weak so strength , inhomogeneous so interactions are more effective than their homogeneous counterpart in generating spin - dependent transport effects .",
    "the relevant small parameter here is the fictitious magnetic flux @xmath43 , in units of @xmath44 . in the above example , @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the spin - precession length expressed in terms of the rashba so parameter @xmath47 .",
    "taking @xmath48  ev  m ( which is at the upper limit of typical values for inas - based heterostructures @xcite ) and @xmath49 , in terms of the free - electron mass @xmath50 , we get @xmath51  @xmath0 m . we thus conclude that linear in so coupling effects will dominate in submicron systems if the so profile is strongly inhomogeneous on the scale of the spin - precession length .",
    "for a more systematic study of topological properties for arbitrary so strength , we express the evolution operator in terms of path integrals . to this end , we are interested in the @xmath7 propagator @xmath52 for the schrdinger equation @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the spinor column:@xcite @xmath55e^{\\frac{i}{\\hbar}s}\\ , .",

    "the contour ordering is necessary for inhomogeneous effective fields @xmath62 , since the pauli matrices do not commute .",

    ", electrons can scatter and undergo arbitrary orbital motion governed by the potential @xmath6 , but we disregard the net spin precession determined by @xmath15 for the transverse motion within the quasi-1d channels , and focus on the phase accumulated during the propagation along the ring .",
    "this requires the characteristic so precession length to be much longer than the wire widths , which is easily realized experimentally . the key observation , according to eq .  ( [ k ] ) ,",
    "is that the so - induced phase is purely geometric and independent of how fast the electrons propagate .    in order to formally separate the geometric contribution to the propagator ( [ k ] ) , we first need to make a convention for labeling quasi-1d paths connecting an arbitrary point @xmath63 in the system ( either in the ring or the connected wires ) to another point @xmath64 . in the following ,",
    "we suppress the transverse degrees of freedom along the connectors and the loop .",
    "the paths along the ring are classified according to the number of clockwise windings , @xmath65 .",

    "the eigenvalue problem ( [ e ] ) can be diagonalized in spin space , after we make several definitions : let @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is a point slightly clockwise offset from @xmath78 , so that @xmath79 corresponds to one full cycle with respect to @xmath68 .",
    "@xmath80 is diagonalized by a unitary transformation : @xmath81 with a unique @xmath43 in the range @xmath82 .",
    "we next introduce a fictitious vector potential @xmath83 corresponding to the magnetic flux @xmath84 ( in units of @xmath85 ) , respectively , through the loop , see fig .",
    "[ sc ] , but in an otherwise arbitrary gauge .",
    "finally , @xmath86 is a line integral along the @xmath66 path from @xmath87 to @xmath64 around the loop , so that @xmath88 and @xmath89 for points @xmath64 inside the ring .",
    "we are now ready to make the transformation : @xmath90note that this is a smooth transformation when the so interaction and the magnetic field are smooth .",

    "the eigenvalues and eigenstates of our original hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) can thus be expressed in terms of the solution of the simpler problem , eq .",
    "( [ d ] ) , describing spinless electron experiencing a magnetic flux , which was discussed extensively in various contexts .",
    "the spin texture corresponding to the so coupling is then added by a purely geometric unitary transformation ( [ t ] ) .",
    "so interactions linear in momentum thus do not add any complexity to the electronic structures of general multiterminal quasi-1d rings .",
    "we thus remark that many of the results discussed in ref .   can be readily obtained after solving the problem of magnetotransport for spinless electrons and then making the transformation ( [ t ] ) ( valid for arbitrarily strong so coupling ) in order to get detailed information about spin as well as charge transport .",

    "the spin transport problem thus reduces to the ab effect for two spin species along the quantization axis determined by @xmath96 , with opposite fictitious fluxes .",
    "since this quantum - interference effect is linear in the so strength , this regime can become useful in practice when a weak so coupling is modulated by external electrostatic gates .",
