    "the photon spectrum in the radiative muon capture in hydrogen ^- + p _ + + n , [ rmcp ] has recently been calculated by several authors @xcite in the search for a process enhancing the high energy part of the photon spectrum , calculated earlier in ref.@xcite .",
    "it was concluded in @xcite , where the study was made both within the small scale expansion scheme @xcite and in the heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory @xcite , that a combination of various small effects could explain the experimental spectrum @xcite .",
    "however , actual size of some of these effects such as of the charge symmetry breaking , are to be considered in a more detail . on the other hand",
    ", this spectrum was calculated in @xcite using amplitudes derived from lagrangians possessing the hidden local @xmath5 symmetry @xcite .",
    "in particular , the vertices containing the @xmath6 isobar field were chosen as _",
    "na_1 = |__(c(z ) ) ( _ + 2 f_g _ _ ) -g_|__(c(y ) ) _ 5__+h.c .",
    "[ lndpra1 ] here @xmath7 is the operator of the isospin @xmath8 transition . the operator @xmath9 is taken in a form @xcite _ ( c(b))&=&_+c(b ) _ _ , [ omnb ] + c(b)&=&-(+b ) .",
    "[ ceb ] the parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 do not influence the on  shell properties of the @xmath2 isobar , hence they are called off - shell parameters . the vertices ( [ lndpra1 ] ) has frequently been used @xcite to study the @xmath12 reactions and the pion photo- and electroproduction on nucleon and the parameters of the model , including @xmath10 and @xmath11 , were extracted from the data .    on the other hand",
    ", one can find also an attempt @xcite to show that the off  shell parameters are redundant within the framework of effective fields theories .",
    "for this purpose , tang and ellis consider the lagrangian of the @xmath0 system with the @xmath13 interaction of the type ( [ lndpra1 ] ) . after integrating out the @xmath2 isobar field ,",
    "they obtain a nonlocal @xmath12 lagrangian where the @xmath11 dependence is contained in couplings .",
    "this leads them to conclude that these couplings can be redefined so that the @xmath11 dependence disappears and therefore , this parameter is physically irrelevant .",
    "however , after finding that it is difficult to manage the nonlocal part of the resulting lagrangian , tang and ellis return to the starting @xmath0 lagrangian containing the @xmath2 field explicitly and recommend to use it with some convenient choice of the parameter @xmath11 , since it is not relevant to the physics . on the other hand , they do not consider any mechanism to compensate the @xmath11 dependence of the observables . indeed ,",
    "if such an independence on a parameter should take place , one should provide a mechanism to compensate it if it appears due to a particular process , that can generally happen .",
    "it can be seen @xcite that the @xmath11 dependence of the amplitudes appears in the form of contact terms .",
    "as it has recently been discussed in refs.@xcite , the contact nature of the @xmath2 excitation amplitudes appears if the interaction vertices contain the projection operators onto the spin 1/2 space , that leads to the contribution of this space .",
    "indeed , the @xmath2 propagator can be written in terms of projection operators as s^_f&=&[_-+p_p_+(p_-p _ ) ] + & = & -(p^3/2)_+ [ ( p^1/2_12 ) _ + ( p^1/2_21 ) _ ] + ( ip - m_)(p^1/2_22)_. [ smn ] in its turn , the operator ( [ omnb ] ) reads _ ( c(z))=-(p^3/2)_-(1 + 3c(z))(p^1/2_11 ) _",
    "-(1+c(z))(p^1/2_22)_-c(z)[(p^1/2_12 ) _ + ( p^1/2_21 ) _ ] .",
    "[ cz ] + explicit form of the projection operators can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "it is seen that if the @xmath2 propagator @xmath14 is sandwiched between the vertices of the type ( [ cz ] ) , the non  pole contribution is present . according to @xcite ,",
    "this feature of the @xmath2 interaction is related to the change of the number of degrees of freedom in comparison with the case allowed by the kinetic energy term of the @xmath2 lagrangian . as a remedy",
    "it is proposed in @xcite that the @xmath15 and @xmath16 lagrangians would possess the same symmetry as the kinetic energy term of the @xmath2 lagrangian that is invariant under a kind of the gauge transformation _ ( x)_(x)+_(x ) , [ gt ] where @xmath17 is the @xmath2 isobar field and @xmath18 is a spinor .    in refs.@xcite , new @xmath0 and @xmath3",
    "lagrangians are proposed .",
    "they possess the property that with the proper choice of couplings , the new and traditional lagrangians provide identical @xmath0 and @xmath3 vertices for the on  shell particles .",
    "further , using the redefinition ( [ gt ] ) , it is shown in @xcite that the new and traditional @xmath0 couplings differ by a contact term quadratic in the coupling constant that can be associated with the contribution of the 1/2 spin space involved due to the traditional @xmath0 coupling .    in sect.[ch1 ] , we show how one can construct such a contact term directly . for this purpose ,",
    "we first use an identity to show that the new and traditional @xmath0 couplings differ by a sum of the @xmath0 terms that vanish for the @xmath2 isobar on  shell .",
    "next we construct , in the tree approximation , the contribution of the @xmath2 excitation to the @xmath12 scattering amplitude and we show that these @xmath0 terms give rise to a contact term quadratic in the @xmath0 coupling constant . in sect.[ch2 ] , we use the new @xmath0 and @xmath3 couplings to calculate the @xmath2 excitation contribution to the photon spectrum for the reaction ( [ rmcp ] ) .",
    "we show for the recently measured spectrum @xcite that it is suppressed in comparison with the one obtained earlier with the use of the traditional couplings . in sect.[ch3 ] , we discuss the obtained results and we present our conclusions .",
    "according to ref.@xcite , the gauge symmetric @xmath0 coupling is ^g.s._n = f _ ( _ |_)5_(_)+h.c .. [ lgs ] with the choice f= , [ fgs ] and for the @xmath2 isobar on  shell ( @xmath19 ) , this coupling is equivalent to the traditional one _",

    "0.4 cm    one can calculate the s - matrix element corresponding to fig.[figg1]a either using the left hand side of eq.([lgsltr ] ) or , equivalently , its right hand side .",

    "it means that the new couplings can not resolve the `` @xmath50 puzzle '' either .",
    "minor difference between the curves of the same sort comes from omitting the form factor @xmath51 of eq.([dg2 g ] ) in the calculations .",
    "it is seen from eqs.([dg3 ] ) and ( [ dg30 ] ) that the form factors @xmath42 and @xmath44 differ by the factor @xmath52 .",
    "such a factor will appear also in the meson exchange current operators with the @xmath2 excitation .",
    "on the other hand , a suppression factor 0.8 has been found to be needed @xcite to reduce the effect of the weak axial meson exchange currents with the @xmath2 excitation in order to explain the experimental value of the gamow  teller matrix element for the triton @xmath53 decay , if the value of the constant @xmath54 is taken from the constituent quark model . in other words it means that effectively the value of the constant @xmath54 turns out to be unrealistically small or one should speculate about other processes effectively suppressing the meson exchange current effect @xcite .",
    "if these weak axial exchange currents are constructed from the new lagrangians , the factor @xmath55 appears naturally and the value of the constant @xmath54 can be taken larger and therefore , more realistic .",
    "simultaneously , such a factor will appear also in the vector meson exchange currents with the @xmath2 excitation .",
    "however , the precise data on the radiative capture of neutrons by protons do not demand any damping of the vector meson exchange currents effect @xcite and the capture rate for the reaction @xmath56 , that has been measured in the precise experiment @xcite , is by the suppressed weak axial exchange currents underestimated @xcite .",
    "precise data , expected from the experiments on the ordinary muon capture in hydrogen and deuterium @xcite , will be for the axial sector of the weak nuclear interaction very helpful .",
    "here we study some aspects of new @xmath0 and @xmath3 couplings that have recently been proposed @xcite by pascalutsa and timmermans . in comparison with the traditional couplings ,",
    "the new ones possess an additional gauge symmetry ( [ gt ] ) that is present in the kinetic energy term of the @xmath2 lagrangian .",
    "this symmetry guarantees that the couplings have the same @xmath2 degrees of freedom as the kinetic energy term . as a consequence",
    ", the amplitudes of the processes with the @xmath2 excitation in the intermediate state do not contain the contact terms coming from the 1/2 spin space .    in sect.[ch1 ]",
    ", we study the difference between the traditional and gauge symmetric @xmath0 couplings . using an algebraic identity between the gamma matrices",
    ", we first express the new coupling as the sum of the traditional coupling and of terms that are zero for the @xmath2 isobar on  shell .",
    "the @xmath12 scattering amplitude , constructed from these terms , is a contact term , quadratic in the coupling constant . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "such a term was obtained by imposing the symmetry condition ( [ gt ] ) on the traditional coupling .",
    "we also show that this contact term can be factorized in an infinite number of forms .    in sect.[ch2 ]",
    ", we employ the gauge symmetric @xmath0 and @xmath3 couplings @xcite to calculate the photon spectra for the radiative muon capture in hydrogen . as a result , the new form factor @xmath57 contains only the @xmath2 isobar pole contribution .",
    "this form factor differs from the old one , calculated for the @xmath2 isobar on  shell , by the damping factor @xmath52 .",
    "consequently , the new photon spectrum , corresponding to the spectrum measured in the triumf experiment , is suppressed in the region @xmath58 mev , in comparison with the photon spectrum , calculated from the traditional couplings .",
    "therefore , the problem of extraction of the induced pseudoscalar form factor @xmath50 from the photon spectrum in the radiative muon capture in hydrogen can not be solved by employing the gauge symmetric @xmath0 and @xmath3 couplings .",
    "let us note that the damping factor @xmath55 will be also present in the meson exchange current operators with the @xmath2 isobar excitation , if for the construction the gauge symmetric couplings are used .",
