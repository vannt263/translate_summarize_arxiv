    "it has become clear over the last decade that purely gas phase schemes can not account for the variety and richness of chemistry occurring in the interstellar medium ( ism ) , particularly in denser regions of molecular clouds where star formation is occurring . in such environments gas - grain interactions * * * * must also play a key role ( williams 1998 ) . within the lifetime of a dense molecular cloud ( on the order of 10@xmath8 yr ) ,",
    "the grains accrete icy mantles as atomic and molecular species freeze - out onto the grains .",
    "the ices are processed further by cosmic ray impacts , uv photolysis , and shocks .",
    "consequently , the chemical composition of these icy mantles is significantly different from that of the local gas phase environment ( rawlings 2000 ) . during cloud collapse and",
    "stellar formation the grains are reheated , and molecules are recycled from the solid state into the gas phase environment . in regions",
    "where the h@xmath0o concentrations are depleted it is assumed that the species is still locked in the icy mantles on the grains , and consequently , that the temperature is below the sublimation temperature of the tracer gas ( van dishoeck & van der tak 2000 ) .",
    "when evaluating these environments it is clearly necessary to understand the sublimation behaviour of the ice , and its thermal stability .",
    "the surface binding energy , _ _",
    "@xmath9__@xmath10 , and sublimation rates of molecular ices may only be obtained empirically . when combined , these data can be used to determine molecular residence times on the ice surface , in terms of a population half - life as a function of temperature .",
    "these data are also applicable in other astronomical environments , such as cometary nuclei and comae , planetary surfaces and satellites .",
    "h@xmath0o is the most abundant molecular ice in dense ism regions ( ehrenfreund & schutte 2000 ) .",
    "the h@xmath0o ice band at 3.07 @xmath11 m is detected on lines of sight towards reddened stars that have a visual extinction above a critical value ( whittet 1993 ) and is typically one of the strongest bands in interstellar ir spectra .",
    "the abundance and morphology of h@xmath0o ice in the ism is generally inferred from the intensity and line profile of the 3.07 @xmath11 m band . at low pressures and temperatures , such as those in the ism",
    ", the h@xmath0o ice can exist in both amorphous and crystalline forms . to further complicate the picture",
    ", the amorphous ice can exist in both high - density ( 1.1 g @xmath12 ) and low - density ( 0.94 g @xmath12 ) forms , reflecting differences in the porosity of the material , with a phase change from former to latter occurring irreversibly between 38  80 k ( jenniskens et al@xmath13 , 1995 ) .",
    "it is generally assumed that the dominant morphology of icy mantles on interstellar grains resembles that of high density amorphous ice , with other ` impurity ' molecules trapped in the h@xmath0o ice matrix ( jenniskens et al@xmath13 1995 ) .",
    "this is evident in comparisons of iso sws and ground based observations with laboratory spectra of mixed ice analogues ( ehrenfreund & schutte 2000 and references therein ) .",
    "however , laboratory spectra of pure h@xmath0o ices show clear differences in the line profile of the 3.07 @xmath11 m feature associated with different ice morphologies and temperatures ( jenniskens et al@xmath13 1997 ) .",
    "it is therefore likely that some h@xmath0o ices have undergone ` mild processing ' and re - cooling , ( such as gentle heating below 80  100 k , or rapid localised heating due to shocks ) , and will therefore also exist in low - density amorphous and crystalline forms ( jenniskens & blake , 1994 , 1996 ) .",
    "the physical properties of the h@xmath14o ice , such as density , conductivity , vapour - pressure , and sublimation rate , are dictated by its structure .",
    "significant differences are expected between the surface chemistry and bulk behaviour of the ice phases .",
    "in addition , the physical and chemical properties of the ice may also be affected by way the ice film is deposited , its lifetime , and processing prior to thermal desorption ( sack & baragiola 1993 ) .",
    "this paper is the first in a series of papers reporting new experimental results on gas - surface interactions occurring under conditions resembling those in the ism and star - forming regions . with the aid of a purpose - built instrument , we are now able , for the first time , to provide the astrochemical community with experimental results addressing not only desorption energies , but also sticking probabilities and desorption mechanisms . here",
    "we present the results of laboratory studies to determine the surface binding energies on , and sublimation rates of h@xmath0o ice under interstellar conditions .",
    "previous studies , where the surface binding energies were determined from spectroscopic data , suggested that the surface binding energy of h@xmath0o on h@xmath0o ice was 4815 @xmath1515 k or 5070 @xmath1550 k , for unannealed and annealed ice samples respectively ( sandford & allamandola 1988 ) .",
    "it was also presumed that the desorption kinetics of the system were first order .",
    "these data have been used extensively in the astronomy literature , where it is now widely reported that under interstellar conditions h@xmath0o can only exist in the solid phase below about 100 k ( hasegawa & herbst 1993 , sandford & allamandola 1993 , ehrenfreund & schutte 2000 ) .",
    "the direct techniques used to determine the surface binding energy in this work are described in  2 .",
    "the results are detailed in  3 . in these experiments",
    "the thermal desorption of thin h@xmath0o ice films is found to occur with zero order kinetics characterised by a surface binding energy , @xmath2 , of 5773 @xmath1560 k , and a pre - exponential factor , a , of 10@xmath16 molecules @xmath6 s@xmath7 . in  4 ,",
    "a comparison is made with previous results , from both thermodynamic and spectroscopic techniques and the astrophysical implications of this work are discussed , focusing on applications associated with dense molecular clouds .",
    "the conclusions are summarised in  5 .",
    "the nottingham surface astrophysics experiment ( nosae ) was designed to measure surface binding energies and sticking probabilities empirically and accurately , recreating the harsh interstellar environment under controlled laboratory conditions .",
    "a much fuller description than can be given here is to be found elsewhere ( fraser , collings & mccoustra 2001 ) . basically , the experiment consists of a stainless steel ultrahigh vacuum ( uhv ) chamber with an operating base pressure of 6@xmath1710@xmath18 torr .",
    "the primary constituent ( > 90% ) of this vacuum is h@xmath0 , providing very similar conditions with the experiment chamber as those found in the ism .",
    "the chamber is equipped with an effusive gas deposition system , quadrupole mass spectrometer ( qms ) , ftir spectrometer and a quartz crystal microbalance ( qcm ) .",
    "the qms is used for temperature programmed desorption ( tpd ) experiments ( see  2.2 ) , the ftir for reflection - absorption infrared spectroscopy ( rairs ) , and the qcm for thin film mass determination .",
    "the grain mimic is an uncharacterised gold film surface , suspended at the end of a cryogenic cold finger , capable of reaching 7 k. the sample is radiatively heated from the reverse side by a halogen bulb .",
    "the sample temperature is measured using two e - type ( ni - cr alloy vs. cu - ni alloy ) and one kp - type ( au including 0.7% fe vs. chromel ) thermocouples , positioned on or near to the sample .",
    "the temperature can be controlled to better than 0.5 k , and measured accurately within 0.25 k. the upper temperature range of the system is 350 k. the whole system is linked via daq , gpib , and rs232 communications to a pair of pc s , which are used to co - ordinate and control data acquisition from various instruments on the experiment .",
    "h@xmath0o was obtained _ in situ _ from a liquid h@xmath0o sample that had been deionized , filtered for organic and inorganic solutes , and subjected to three freeze - thaw cycles under a vacuum of better than 1@xmath1710@xmath19 torr .",
    "ice films were deposited at a rate of _ ca . _ 10@xmath20 molecules s@xmath7 on the gold film substrate held at a temperature of 10 k , from a quasi - effusive molecular beam of h@xmath0o , directed at 5@xmath21 to the surface normal . at such low temperatures and slow deposition rates ballistic deposition results in the formation of high - density amorphous ice .",
    "exposure of the substrate to gaseous h@xmath0o was varied between 1 and 100 langmuir ( l ) , ( 1 langmuir is equivalent to 1@xmath1710@xmath22 torr s ) , and film mass was estimated using the qcm .",
    "an exposure of 20 l corresponded to a film mass of _ ca .",
    "_ 3.8@xmath1710@xmath23 g , which equates to a surface number density of h@xmath0o of 2.44@xmath1710@xmath24 molecules @xmath6 , or a film thickness of _ ca .",
    "0.03 @xmath11 m , when proper account of the qcm sensor area is made .",
    "the sublimation characteristics of the h@xmath0o films were measured by temperature programmed desorption ( tpd ) . in this method a linear temperature ramp is applied to the sample and the rate of desorption is measured by monitoring the amount of adsorbate that desorbs into the gas phase as a function of temperature .",
    "desorption is an activated process which takes place at a rate given by    @xmath25    where @xmath26is the number of adsorbed molecules on the surface in molecules @xmath6",
    ", @xmath27 is the order of the reaction and @xmath28 is the rate constant , given by    @xmath29    where @xmath4 is the pre - exponential factor , @xmath2 is the binding energy of a molecule on the ice surface in j , @xmath30 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath31 is the ice temperature in k. for convenience , in this paper the surface binding energies are expressed as @xmath32 , i.e. in k , and the units of @xmath4 are determined from @xmath28 , i.e. for @xmath27 = 1 , @xmath4 is expressed in s@xmath33 , and where @xmath27 = 0 , @xmath4 is expressed in molecules @xmath6 s@xmath7 .",
    "equation ( [ eq1 ] ) can be rewritten , to reflect the tpd signal that is actually measured during the experiment , i.e.    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is the heating rate , _ dt / dt_. the recorded tpd signal peaks at some temperature maximum , @xmath36 , which corresponds to the point at which the desorption rate from the surface is at a maximum , i.e. ( @xmath37__/dt__@xmath38 = 0 ) . the tpd spectra are collected at increasing initial surface coverages , using the same linear heating ramp in each case .",
    "to a first approximation , the surface binding energy , @xmath2 , can then be calculated directly by substituting for @xmath39 in equation ( [ eq3 ] ) ( using equation ( [ eq2 ] ) ) , differentiating and equating to zero    @xmath40    provided the pre - exponential factor , @xmath4 , is known . in a first order desorption process , where @xmath27 = 1 , @xmath4 is assumed to be around 10@xmath41 to 10@xmath42 s@xmath7 , approximately the vibrational frequency of the weak bond between the adsorbate molecule and the surface .",
    "it is also possible to evaluate the order of the reaction from the tpd peak shape and peak maximum provided that the activation energy for desorption and pre - exponential factor remain constant as a function of surface coverage . in practice",
    "however , desorption may not occur in a single step , the surface binding energy can vary across binding sites on the surface or with surface coverage , and the pre - exponential factor , @xmath4 , may differ by several orders of magnitude .",
    "a more rigorous result can be obtained by modelling the desorption system and using numerical fitting methods with a number of tpd spectra to evaluate the values of @xmath4 and @xmath2 ( see woodruff & delchar 1986 , attard & barnes 1998 for a more complete discussion ) .    in these experiments",
    "the ice layers were warmed at a rate of 0.02 k s@xmath43 and the qms , tuned to mass 18 ( h@xmath0o@xmath44 ) , was used to monitor the gas phase composition during desorption from the substrate .",
    "the qms was operated in a line - of - sight configuration so that only molecules originating from the sample surface produced a signal at the detector ( fisher & jones 1999 ) .",
    "sample coverages of 1 , 2 , 5 , 10 , 20 , and 50 l ( sub - monolayer to multilayer ) were used . in all cases ,",
    "no desorption was observed before 120 k and desorption was complete by 170 k.",
    "to 0.45    fig .",
    "1 shows a sequence of tpd spectra for h@xmath0o films deposited at 10 k , with increasing surface coverage .",
    "the spectra show the change in intensity of the mass 18 ( h@xmath0o@xmath44 ) signal at the qms as the sample is slowly heated .",
    "an intense , asymmetric peak is observed at _ ca . _ 140 k , associated with the desorption of the bulk ice film from the au substrate .",
    "there is little or no change in the shape of the leading edge peak with increasing exposure .",
    "furthermore , the peak temperature , @xmath45 increases monotonically with exposure .",
    "these observations are typical of tpd spectra in which the desorption process follows zero order kinetics , as illustrated by fig .",
    "2 . the figure shows results from a series of ( a ) zeroth and ( b ) first order tpd simulations ( based on equation 3 ) , at coverages of 2 , 5 , 10 , 20 , 50 and 100 monolayers of h@xmath0o , and under conditions similar to those in this experiment . in the zeroth order case ( fig .",
    "2 ( a ) ) , the tpd curves are asymmetric , with coincident rising edges , and the peak temperature , @xmath36 , increases with exposure .",
    "this is typical of multilayer desorption , where the intensity of the tpd spectrum increases as more and more material is condensed onto the surface .",
    "the shift in @xmath36 _ _ _ _ ( the peak position ) occurs because the desorption rate increases exponentially with temperature , so the rate can increase indefinitely until all the layers have been stripped away , and the tpd signal falls rapidly to zero .",
    "the bonding between the layers resembles that in a condensed solid of the adsorbate , so the desorption energy , @xmath2 , and pre - exponential factor , @xmath4 , are the same for every layer . in contrast , the first order desorption curves are symmetric about a single @xmath46value , independent of coverage ( see fig .",
    "2 ( b ) ) . this closely resembles monolayer desorption kinetics , when the nature of the bonding between the adsorbate and the underlying substrate is clearly important . in a multilayer system ( e.g. icy mantles on dust grains , or the ice system studied here )",
    "the monolayer is generally more tightly bound to the underlying substrate than the subsequent adsorbate layers .",
    "consequently , the monolayer desorption peak appears at higher temperatures in the tpd spectrum than the multilayer desorption , reflecting a different @xmath2 value .",
    "its line shape profile will also differ , reflecting both a different @xmath47value , and the different reaction kinetics .",
    "a more complete discussion of this complex relationship between tpd line shape profiles , binding energies , and desorption kinetics can be found in woodruff & delchar ( 1986 ) or attard & barnes ( 1998 ) .",
    "however , from a comparison between the experimental tpd spectra presented in fig . 1 and the simulations in fig",
    ". 2 , it is reasonable to conclude that the results of this experiment are indicative of zeroth order kinetics . furthermore , only a single peak is observed in the tpd spectra : even at low coverage it is not possible to deconvolve a monolayer desorption peak from the multilayer peak . therefore no evidence exists to suggest that the desorption process is coverage dependant , nor that it is possible to distinguish between the multilayer and monolayer desorption processes . these observations are entirely consistent with previous reports on the tpd of ice from other hydrophobic , metal substrates ( kay et al . 1989 ; dohnlek et al@xmath131999 , 2000 ) .    to 0.45    to 0.45    in some cases , and particularly at higher exposure ,",
    "a slight shoulder is observed on the leading edge of the 140 k tpd peak . under these experimental conditions ,",
    "the phase transition between amorphous and crystalline ice is known to occur between 120 and 140 k ( sack & baragiola 1993 ) .",
    "it might be expected therefore that all the desorbing ice should be in the crystalline phase by the time desorption occurs .",
    "however , given the relatively long timescale for this phase change ( dohnlek et al .",
    ", 2000 ) , it is likely that some desorption will occur from residual amorphous phase that has yet to undergo the phase change .",
    "the tpd peak of the amorphous ice will occur at a lower temperature than the main desorption peak since the vapour pressure of the amorphous ice is around three times greater than that of crystalline ice ( kouchi 1987 ) .",
    "this behaviour is clearly illustrated in fig .",
    "traces ( a ) and ( b ) show the tpd spectra from h@xmath0o films of equivalent surface exposure , deposited at two temperatures , 10 and 100 k , producing high - density amorphous ice and low - density amorphous ice respectively .",
    "the films were cooled to 10 k and then treated as described in  2 .",
    "their tpd spectra are essentially equivalent , showing the amorphous ice desorption shoulder on the leading edge , which gradually flattens out as the crystallisation phase change dominates , and finally the major tpd peak , corresponding to desorption of the crystalline phase .",
    "two further films , with double the surface coverage of the amorphous films , were also investigated .",
    "trace ( c ) shows results for an h@xmath0o film that was grown at 130 k then cooled to 10 k and warmed .",
    "the tpd spectrum from this ice film is narrower , with the onset of desorption occurring slightly later than the other spectra , and no evidence of the amorphous shoulder can be seen .",
    "these features are attributed to the purely crystalline nature of this ice film .",
    "finally trace ( d ) in this spectrum , was produced by depositing equal amounts of h@xmath0o at 100 and then 10 k. the total surface coverage in ( d ) is therefore equivalent to ( c ) .",
    "the tpd trace for this sample shows evidence of the amorphous phase desorption , but the phase change appears to be much faster than in ( a ) or ( b ) , and spectrum is dominated by desorption from the crystalline phase .",
    "similar results have been found in previous studies of ice desorption from various substrates , where the rate of crystallisation has also been determined ( speedy et al .",
    "1996 ; smith et al .",
    "1996 ) .",

    "this indicates that h@xmath0o is only weakly bound to hydrophobic substrates , and that the adsorbate - substrate binding energy is comparable to the adsorbate - adsorbate hydrogen bonding . in astrophysical terms",
    ", this indicates that the same desorption mechanism and desorption energy can be used to model h@xmath0o desorption from any hydrophobic surface , ( e.g. silicon , graphite ) .",
    "similar desorption studies on hydrophilic surfaces ( such as metal oxides , quartz , and silicates ) indicate that h@xmath0o bonds chemically to such surfaces . in such cases ,",
    "the h@xmath0o - substrate system exhibits alternative desorption kinetics , with even higher activation barriers ( for example _ _ _ _ stirniman et al .",
    "1996 ; trakhtenberg et al@xmath13 1997 ; hudson et al . 2001 ) .",
    "however , these systems do exhibit identical h@xmath14o - h@xmath0o desorption processes in the regime where the ice surface is substrate independent ( i.e. the ice layer is thick enough that it is no longer influenced by the underlying substrate ) .",
    "consequently , in ism regions where relatively thick ice layers are formed , or the grain surface is hydrophobic , the underlying structure of the cosmic grain is not significant . elsewhere , the grain material may influence the h@xmath0o desorption mechanism .",
    "it will not be possible to say conclusively which h@xmath0o desorption kinetics will dominate until the nature of interstellar grains has been clearly established .",
    "as table 1 shows , the results obtained in this study differ significantly from those obtained by sandford & allamandola 1988 .",
    "firstly , the @xmath2 differs by _ ca .",
    "_ 800 k for both the crystalline and amorphous ice phases , and secondly the desorption kinetics in this study are clearly zero order and not first order .",
    "these two parameters are both significant when modelling interstellar environments , particularly when calculating the residence time of h@xmath0o on interstellar grains , or establishing the ratio of solid to gas phase material .",
    "why do the two methods give such different results ?",
    "the discrepancies must be related to the different assumptions that are made in interpreting the data under each set of experimental conditions .",
    "the most significant difference between the two experiments is that the spectroscopic data are taken under isothermal conditions at base pressures of _ ca . _",
    "2@xmath1710@xmath140 torr , whereas the tpd spectra are recorded in dynamic conditions at base pressures of 6@xmath1710@xmath18 torr . in the spectroscopic measurements , it was assumed that a first order rate law applied , and the value of @xmath57was determined indirectly , by monitoring the relative change in integrated intensity of a surface ir spectroscopic feature during isothermal desorption .",
    "contrary to the assumptions made in sandford & allamandola s method , close to the desorption temperature , the sticking probability of h@xmath0o molecules on the surface is no longer unity , and over the time period of the experiment it is possible for re - adsorption to occur , both from vacuum contaminants and desorbing gas .",
    "the evaluation of isothermal measurements is also complicated by non - equilibrium effects , including both crystallisation and re - adsorption . in the tpd",
    "experiments it is possible to obtain information on the order of the reaction and @xmath2 directly , from the shape and position of the tpd curve . in uhv systems designed for tpd experiments ,",
    "the pumping speed is so high that surface re - adsorption is not relevant . unlike the spectroscopic data , the tpd spectra clearly show that crystallisation and desorption are occurring concurrently in the system .",
    "it is possible however to identify the amorphous , crystalline and ` phase change ' regions of the tpd spectra from each other . with careful film preparation",
    "it is even possible to force the tpd spectrum to exhibit only crystalline behaviour , as was seen in fig .",
    "3 . furthermore ,",
    "kay and co - workers have made a number studies using tpd methods to determine the rates of crystallisation and desorption when they are occurring at the same time , and have found no significant difference between the desorption rates they measure isothermally or dynamically ( speedy et al .",
    "1996 ; smith et al . 1996 ; dohnlek et al . 1999 , 2000 ) .",
    "finally the experimental conditions under which the tpd spectra were obtained most closely resemble those in the interstellar medium .",
    "we therefore believe that these data represent the parameters for h@xmath0o that should be employed in astronomical models .",
    "table 2 shows the effect these new parameters have on the residence times of h@xmath0o molecules on h@xmath0o ices and hydrophobic surfaces .",
    "it is not possible to define a residence time for a zero order process that is directly comparable ( with the same units ) with a first order process .",
    "consequently , the results are presented here in terms of the half - life of the h@xmath0o surface population , rather than the residence time , 1/@xmath28 that is commonly used in the astronomical literature .",
    "the respective half - life values are defined in the table .",
    "it is important to note that the half - life of a zero order process also depends on the surface concentration of h@xmath0o molecules . in these calculations",
    "this value was fixed at 1.15@xmath1710@xmath141 molecules @xmath142 , equivalent to around 100 monolayers of h@xmath0o ice , i.e. the number of h@xmath0o layers expected to accrete on a interstellar grain during the lifetime of a dense cloud ( hasegawa & herbst 1993 ) .",
    "the half - lives calculated using the zero order @xmath47and @xmath2 values obtained in this work are given in column one ( crystalline ice ) and three ( amorphous ice).the results are also compared to half - life calculations using the data from sandford & allamandola ( 1993 ) .",
    "the half - lives calculated using sandford & allamandola s first order @xmath47and @xmath2 values are given in columns six ( crystalline ice ) and eight ( amorphous ice ) . from table 2",
    "it is immediately clear that h@xmath0o can remain on the grain surface at significantly higher temperatures than has previously been assumed , typically around 110 - 120 k rather than 90 - 100 k.",
    "the surface binding energy and desorption kinetics of amorphous and crystalline h@xmath0o ice have been studied under conditions similar to those found in denser regions of interstellar clouds .",
    "these data have been used to calculate the residence times of h@xmath0o on h@xmath0o and hydrophobic surfaces as a function of temperature .",
    "the results imply that , in the dense interstellar medium , thermal desorption of h@xmath0o ice will occur at significantly higher temperatures , and different rates , than previously had been assumed .",
    "these data are of fundamental importance in the chemical modelling of many astrophysical environments .",
    "the effects may be particularly pronounced in so - called hot cores , which are very dense clumps of gas , remnants of a collapsing cloud that formed a massive star .",
    "irradiation of the clumps heats the cores to temperatures in the range 100 - 300 k , when the ices evaporate , populating the gas with water and other trace molecules ( cf .",
    "millar 1993 ) .",
    "the temperature of the evaporation may be crucial to relating the observed chemistry of hot cores to the implied rate of warming of the central star ( viti and williams 1999).the results provide the astronomical community with reliable thermodynamic data pertaining to the desorption of h@xmath0o under interstellar conditions .",
    "the authors thank pparc for their financial support , without which these experiments would not have been possible .",
