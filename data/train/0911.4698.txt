    "our aim is not the detailed description of all data , we would like to demonstrate only a possibility of the considered models to reproduce the main features of the high energy data .",
    "evidently , at lower energy we need to add more regge contributions which increase the number of the fitting parameters . to avoid an extra number of contributions and parameters we deal with the data on @xmath78 at @xmath79 200 , 540 , 630 , 900 , 1800 gev ( 240 points ) @xcite and on @xmath80 @xcite normalized to @xmath81 ( 48 points ) .",

    "one can clearly see that slope is changing with energy . taking into account that @xmath35-dependence in the pomeron contribution is coming only from vertex function @xmath82 , one can expect that the slope effect can be explained in the model only due to subasymptotic contributions .",
    "for example , in the dipole model it can be simple pole contribution with @xmath83 as well as @xmath84-reggeon contributing at not highest energies .",
