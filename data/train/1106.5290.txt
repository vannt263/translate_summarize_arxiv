    "in the past years , experimentalist has made big progress on the search for the charmonium - like states , the so - called xyz states , in the @xmath14 meson decay , the @xmath15 collision , the @xmath16 fusion process , which have aroused extensive interest in revealing the underlying properties of the observed charmonium - like states ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "the study of charmonium - like states is a research field full of challenges and opportunities in hadron physics .",
    "very recently the belle collaboration @xcite reported two charged @xmath17 structures around 10610 mev and 10650 mev by studying the @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) and @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) invariant mass spectra of @xmath22 hidden - bottom decay channels ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for theoretical progress ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we proposed the initial single pion emission ( ispe ) mechanism to explain the observed @xmath17 structures . by emitting a pion , @xmath23 decays into @xmath24 and @xmath25 mesons with low momentum . then",
    ", @xmath24 and @xmath25 mesons interact with each other by exchanging @xmath24 meson and transit into @xmath18 or @xmath20 . here , two structures near the @xmath26 and @xmath27 thresholds appear in the @xmath18 and @xmath20 invariant mass spectra , which could correspond to @xmath28 and @xmath29 @xcite .    just indicated in ref .",
    "@xcite , if the ispe mechanism is an universal mechanism existing in heavy quarkonium decay , we can naturally extend such physical picture to study hidden - charm decays of higher vector charmonia due to the similarity between charmonium and bottomonium families , and predict some novel phenomena similar to the @xmath17 structures .    in particle data book @xcite , six vector charmonia are established well , which are @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 with @xmath33 . among these",
    "charmonia , only @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are higher than the thresholds of @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "thus , we study the hidden - charm decays of @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 via the ispe mechanism . from the analysis of such modes ,",
    "one indicates that enhancement structures similar to the charged @xmath17 also exist in the charm case .",
    "in addition , in this work we will study the hidden - charm decays of @xmath5 , which is an important charmonium - like state observed by the babar collaboration in the @xmath37 process @xcite .",
    "its mass , width and @xmath38 are @xmath39 mev , @xmath40 mev and @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "the study presented in ref .",
    "@xcite indicates that @xmath5 can be related to charmonia @xmath3 and @xmath4 , where the @xmath5 structure can be reproduced by the interference of production amplitudes of the @xmath42 processes via direct @xmath15 annihilation and through intermediate charmonia @xmath3 and @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "we naturally apply the ispe mechanism existing in @xmath3 and @xmath4 decays to discuss the hidden - charm dipion decays of @xmath5 .",
    "thus , studying @xmath5 hidden - charm decays through the ispe mechanism is an intriguing issue , where we will also predict some enhancement structure similar to the charged @xmath17 . as announced by babar @xcite",
    ", @xmath5 was first observed in its @xmath9 decay channel .",
    "searching enhancement structure in the @xmath43 invariant mass spectrum of @xmath44 will be accessible in future experiments , which could provide a direct test to the non - resonant explanation for @xmath5 proposed in @xcite .",
    "this work is organized as follows .",
    "after the introduction , we illustrate the hidden - charm dipion decays of higher charmonia under the ispe mechanisms . in sec .",
    "iii , the numerical results are presented .",
    "the last section is the discussion and conclusion .",
    "with @xmath45 as an example , we first illustrate the possible decay mechanisms in the dipion hidden - charm decay of higher charmonium .",
    "@xmath2 can directly decay into @xmath9 . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the qcd multipole expansion method was proposed and can be applied to calculate such direct decay process .",
    "the second mechanism is that the dipion is from the intermediate scalar ( @xmath46 ) or tensor ( @xmath47 ) meson , where the hadronic loops constructed by the @xmath48 mesons could be as a bridge to connect @xmath2 and @xmath9 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details ) .    the remaining decay mechanism existing in the hidden - charm dipion decays of higher charmonia is the ispe mechanism , which was first proposed in ref . @xcite .",
    "by the quark - level diagram we give an explicit description ( left - side diagram in fig .",
    "[ ipe ] ) of the ispe mechanism in @xmath45 decay .",
    "the physical picture is that with a pion emission @xmath2 first dissolves into @xmath48 and @xmath49 mesons with low momentum , which further turn into @xmath6 .",
    "here , @xmath50 transition occurs via exchanging @xmath48 meson @xcite .",
