    "the annuli of a fixed , short segment of the lightcurve are defined by the intersections of an ellipsoid of constant path length and each scattering layer .",
    "the superposition of the annuli from all dust layers ( clouds ) and the different parts of the flare light curve will create a set of ( partially overlapping ) rings .",
    "this situation is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : cartoon ] .",
    "if the lightcurve of the x - ray flare that created the echo is known , an x - ray image of such a set of light - echo rings with sufficiently high angular resolution and signal - to - noise may be de - composed into contributions from a set of distinct dust layers at different distances .",

    "the soft gamma - ray repeater 1e 1547.0 - 5408 was the first galactic x - ray source to show a clear set of bright x - ray light echo rings @xcite .",

    "the source is known to be at cosmological distances , which makes the scattering geometry particularly simple , since the source is effectively at infinite distance and the scattering angle is equal to the observed ring angle on the sky , which simplifies eq .",

    "the presence of type i x - ray bursts @xcite identifies the compact object in the source as a neutron star with a low magnetic field , supported by the presence of jets and the lack of x - ray or radio pulses @xcite .    the transient nature and the low magnetic field suggested a classification of circinus x-1  as an old , low - mass x - ray binary with an evolved companion star ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this interpretation was in conflict with the observed orbital evolution time of order @xmath28 years @xcite to @xmath29 years @xcite and the possible identification of an a - b type super - giant companion star @xcite , suggesting a much younger system age and a likely massive companion star .",
    "the orbital period of the system is 16.5 days , with a likely eccentricity around 0.45 @xcite    the conflicting identifications were resolved with the discovery of an arcminute scale supernova remnant in both x - ray and radio observations @xcite , placing an upper limit of @xmath30 on the age of the system , where @xmath31 is the distance to the source .",
    "this upper limit makes circinus x-1  the youngest known x - ray binary and an important test case for the study of both neutron star formation and orbital evolution in x - ray binaries .",
    "the distance to circinus x-1  is highly uncertain . as a southern source deeply embedded in the galactic disk , most standard methods of distance determination are not available .",

    "circinus x-1  is a highly variable source , spanning over four orders of magnitude in luminosity from its quiescent flux to its brightest flares .",
    "while the source was consistently bright during the 1990 s , it underwent a secular decline in flux starting in about 2000 and has spent the past 10 years below the detection thresholds of the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ all sky monitor and the maxi all sky monitor aboard the _ international space station _",
    "@xcite , with the exception of sporadic near - eddington flares , sometimes in excess of one crab in flux ( throughout the paper we will refer to the eddington limit of @xmath35 for a @xmath36 neutron star ) .",
    "these flares typically occur within individual binary orbits and are characterized by very rapid rises in flux near periastron of the binary orbit and often rapid flux decays at the end of the orbit .",
    "for example , during the five years it has been monitored by maxi , circinus x-1  exhibited ten binary orbits with peak 2 - 10 kev fluxes in excess of @xmath37 and five orbits with peak flux at or above one crab .",
    "the large dynamic range of the source flux , the well - defined duration of the x - ray flares , and the low mean flux during the quiescent periods over the past decades make circinus x-1  an ideal source for observations of x - ray light echoes .",
    "the source is located in the galactic plane , at galactic coordinates @xmath38 . the large neutral hydrogen column density of @xmath39 , inferred from photo - electric absorption of the x - ray spectra of both the neutron star ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and the supernova remnant @xcite , further increases the likelihood to observe light echoes .    in late 2013 , circinus x-1  underwent an extremely bright flare , preceded and followed by long periods of very low x - ray flux . in this paper , we report the detection of the brightest and largest set of x - ray dust scattering rings observed to date , generated by the light echo from the 2013 flare .",
    "the spatial variation of the rings allows us to identify the interstellar clouds responsible for the different rings , which determines the distance to the x - ray source , circinus x-1 , to roughly 10% accuracy .",
    "we will describe the observations and data analysis in  [ sec : observations ] .",
    "section [ sec : analysis ] describes the analysis of the x - ray , co , and hi data and the procedure for deconvolving the x - ray signal into the line - of - sight dust distribution . in  [ sec : discussion ] , we derive a new distance to circinus x-1 and discuss the consequences for the physics of this unique x - ray binary and for the physics of dust scattering .",
    "section [ sec : conclusions ] briefly summarizes our findings .",
    "circinus x-1 was observed with _ chandra _ , _ xmm - newton _ , and _ swift _ in early 2014 after a bright x - ray flare of the source in late 2013 .",
    "figure [ fig : maxi_lightcurve ] shows the time of the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _",
    "observations overlaid on the maxi lightcurve of the source .",
    "the source exhibited a bright flare during three binary orbits approximately 50 to 100 days before the first _",
    "observation @xcite , with a quiescent binary orbit interspersed during the first half of the flare .",
    "the source flare reached fluxes in excess of one crab , with a total 2 - 4 kev fluence of @xmath40 .",
    "the lightcurve of the flare has three characteristic peaks and a pronounced gap .",
    "this is the most energetic flare circinus x-1  exhibited since it entered its long - term quiescent state in 2006 , and is comparable in peak flux to the brightest flares the source has undergone even during its long - term outburst .    before and during the _ chandra _ campaign ,",
    "_ swift _ observed the source twelve times for a total exposure of 12 ksec in order to safely schedule the _ chandra _ observations .",
    "the history of bright flares by circinus x-1 , which can exceed the acis dose limit even during moderate exposures presents a significant scheduling challenge , and frequent monitoring of the source with swift was used to confirm that the source was safely below the maximum flux allowable under _ chandra _ instrument safety rules .",
    "the short total exposure time and the fact that the exposures were spread over a time window of 11 days make the _ swift _ data unsuitable for the analysis presented in this paper .      in the 3.5 binary orbits preceding the first _",

    "the image also clearly shows at least three bright rings that are concentric on the point source .",
    "the first ring spans from 4.2 to 5.7 arcminutes in radius , the second ring from 6.1 to 8.2 arcminutes , and the third from 8.3 to 11.4 arcminutes in radius , predominantly covered by the eastern chips 2 and 3 .",

    "since the four major rings described in this paper were produced by the molecular clouds associated with the co velocity components 1@xmath138 , 2@xmath138 , and 3@xmath138 , future x - ray observations of circinus x-1  light echoes will show similar sets of rings , with radii for a given time delay determined from eq .",

    "ring [ e ] will be brightest in the southern half of the image .",
    "because circinus x-1  exhibits sporadic flares several times per year , it should be possible to observe this echo with modest exposure times and/or for moderate x - ray fluence of the flare , given the expected large intensity of the echo due to the large column density of cloud 4@xmath138 .",
    "a detection of ring [ e ] would improve the fidelity of the distance estimate primarily because it would test the ring - cloud - associations assumed in our three priors .",
    "however , the statistical improvement on the distance estimate would be marginal because the low relative distance @xmath284 to cloud 4@xmath138 implies a large change in @xmath285 with @xmath7 in such a way that @xmath286 ( and thus also the velocity constraint on cloud 4@xmath138 ) is rather insensitive to @xmath7 .    future observations at smaller delay times will also provide constraints on the scattering cross section at smaller scattering angles .",
    "constraints on @xmath260 from _ single _ rings at _ different _ scattering angles are inherently less error - prone , as the error in the normalization of @xmath16 affects all measurement equally , probing the _ relative _ change of scattering cross section with @xmath56 .",
    "better temporal coverage of the light echo from earlier times will allow detailed maps of each cloud both from the spatial distribution of the scattering signal and from the foreground absorption caused by each of the dust clouds , which can be compared to the scattering depth and the hydrogen column density from co and hi measurements .",
    "should a high - accuracy distance determination to circinus x-1  become possible from other methods , ( such as maser parallax to one of the co clouds , in particular cloud 4@xmath138 , which has the highest column density , or vlbi parallax to the source itself ) , the distance to _ all _ dust components will be determined to within 5% accuracy or better ( set by the relative angular width @xmath287 of the dust cloud from table [ tab : clouds ] ) .",
    "this would allow for extremely accurate tomography of the dust and gas distribution towards circinus x-1  from the existing observations presented here and any future light echo observations , providing a powerful tool to study galactic structure in the fourth quadrant .",

    "<S> we identify a prominent band of foreground photoelectric absorption with a lane of co gas at @xmath2 . from the association of the rings with individual co clouds we determine the kinematic distance to circinus x-1  to be @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this distance rules out earlier claims of a distance around @xmath4 , implies that circinus x-1  is a frequent super - eddington source , and places a lower limit of @xmath5 on the lorentz factor and an upper limit of @xmath6 on the jet viewing angle . </S>"
