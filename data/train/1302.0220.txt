    "the gravitational waves ( gws ) are one of the most promising tools to study astrophysical systems like neutron stars ( ns ) , coalescing binary systems , black holes ( bhs ) , and white dwarfs ( wds ) .",

    "the prediction of general relativity ( gr ) on the first time derivative of the orbital period in binary pulsar systems was studied by @xcite and @xcite , for which the discrepancy on observed data with respect to the prediction is @xmath1 .",

    "5 we give our conclusions and remarks .",
    "the @xmath0-theories are based on corrections and enlargements of the gr theory adding higher - order curvature invariants and minimally or non - minimally coupled scalar fields into dynamics which come out from the effective action of quantum gravity @xcite .",

    "it is worth noticing that the order of derivative is increased of two degrees consistently to the fact that @xmath0-gravity is of fourth - order in the metric approach @xcite .",
    "in order to calculate the radiated energy of a gravitational waves source , @xcite suppose that @xmath28 can be represented by a discrete spectral representation .",

    "an important remark is related to the absence of monopole and dipole terms in our considerations . in our case , all the calculations are performed in the jordan frame so@xmath45-gravity results as a mere extension of gr being @xmath46 , so any dipole terms is null ( as shown in @xcite in table 10.2 ) . in order to put in evidence such contributions , we have to pass in the einstein frame where the additional degrees of freedom of gravitational field can be recast in term of scalar fields . in this case ,",
    "monopole and dipole terms explicitly come out @xcite .",
    "the two approaches are conformally equivalent but in the einstein frame monopole and dipole terms can come out ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "this energy loss , provided by gr , has been confirmed by the timing data analysis on the well known binary pulsar b1913 + 16 @xcite .",
    "we also must note that the systems like b1913 + 16 are optimal tools to constrain theories of gravitation @xcite using the post - keplerian parameters . for sake of convenience",
    "we choose the observed orbital period derivative @xmath70 , because it is one of the best observed post - keplerian parameters .",
    "moreover we know , according to gr theory , that it is related to the foreseen orbital decay due to quadrupole gravitational radiation emitted by the binary systems .    as shown in sec .",
    "[ sect4 ] , it is possible rewrite the first derivative of the orbital period in @xmath0-theories of gravity . in principle , if we know exactly which lagrangian we have to use to describe those type of systems , then we can predict the energy loss through gws radiation . here , we want to make the inverse process , to get an estimation of the second derivative @xmath68 imposing the strong hypothesis that the difference between the observed binary period variation ( @xmath71 ) and the one obtained by the relativistic theory of gravitation , @xmath72 , is fully justified imposing that : @xmath73 @xmath74 and propagating the experimental error , @xmath75 , on the first derivative of the observed orbital period @xmath76 , into an uncertainty on second derivative of gravitational theory , @xmath77 . what we want to emphasize",
    "is that , where gr is not able to fully explain the loss of energy by emission of gws radiation then , the additive contribution of an etgs can provide a way to fill the gap between theory and observations .",
    "we also have substracted the external contributions to the orbital decay as galactic or shklovskii acceleration when those values are available in literature . solving the eqs . and",
    "for @xmath68 and @xmath77 we get an estimation of @xmath68 and its upper and lower limits corresponding respectively to @xmath78 . in this way",
    "@xmath79 is fully explained through the orbital period correction due to the etgs @xmath80 .",
    "so we get : @xmath81 @xmath82 where @xmath83 .",
    "thus , among the various binary stars catalogues available in literature , we choose a sample of observed relativistic binary pulsars ( orbp ) such that the binary period @xmath84 , the observed orbital period variation @xmath76 , the computed orbital period variation from general relativistic theory @xmath85 , the orbital eccentricity @xmath57 , the masses of the components @xmath86 and @xmath87 , are known with a fairly good precision . for each system we have chosen , all previous parameters and their references are reported in tab .",
    "[ table1 ] where we show : the j - name of the binary pulsar system , the observed orbital binary period @xmath84 in days , the orbital projected semi - major axis @xmath88 in light second , the orbital eccentricity @xmath57 , the observed time variation of the orbital period @xmath89 , the predicted one @xmath90 ( according to the gr theory ) , the experimental error @xmath75 on @xmath89 and the masses @xmath91 and @xmath92 of the binary system components in solar mass unit .",

    "now , in fig.[fig1 ] , we report representative results of our numerical analysis on the sample of binary pulsars we choose . in both panels we use the following notation :",
    "the black line shows the behavior of the first derivative of the orbital binary period for the @xmath0-theories of gravity as computed in eq . ; the blue line represents the observed orbital period variation @xmath76 ; the red lines give the error band determined by the experimental errors @xmath100 ; and finally the green line is representative of the @xmath85 orbital period variation computed from the gr . for the binary pulsar system @xmath101 ,",
    "fig.[fig1]a , the orbital period variation @xmath85 , computed from the gr , is included in experimental error band @xmath100 , so as the observed orbital period variation @xmath76 .",
    "moreover , it is possible to see from fig.[fig1]a the gr value of @xmath85 is recovered for @xmath102 ( green square ) , whilst to justify the difference @xmath103 between @xmath76 and @xmath85 we have , from the solution of , the values shown in fig.[fig1 ] for @xmath104(red square ) and for @xmath68 ( blue square ) . in the panel ( b ) of the fig.[fig1 ] there is reported for @xmath105 the same situation . in this case",
    "the @xmath85 is out of the error band determined by the experimental errors @xmath99 .",
    "it is again possible to see for @xmath106 that the gr value of @xmath85 is recovered , but in this case the @xmath68 values are order of magnitude greater than the one of the well behaved case of @xmath107 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] there are shown , for sake of convenience , in logarithmic scale , the absolute values of @xmath68 reported in tab.[table2 ] versus the ratio @xmath108 .",
    "we must note that for the first six binaries in tables , the etgs are not ruled out @xmath109 . for those systems we get @xmath110 ,",
    "the difference between @xmath111 and @xmath89 can be explained adding a new contribution from the theory of gravity .",
    "instead for most of binaries we have @xmath68 values that can surely rule out the theory , since taking account of the weak field assumption we obtain @xmath112 . from this",
    "last values to the first ones , there is a jump of about four up to five order of magnitude on @xmath68 .",
    "the origin of these strong discrepancies , perhaps , is due to the extreme assumption we made , to justify the difference between the observed @xmath76 and the predicted @xmath85 using the etgs .",
    "we want point out in this preliminary work that , where the gr theory is not enough to explain the gap between the data and the theoretical estimation of the orbital decay , there is the possibility to extend the gr theory with a generic @xmath0- theory to cover the gap . here , we simply verify that this possibility exists , but there is need to compute the post - keplerian parameters in the @xmath0-theory to estimate correctly the masses of the binary systems to constraint correctly the analytic parameters the etgs . in post - minkowskian limit of analytic @xmath0-gravity models ,",
    "the quadrupole - radiation depends on the masses of the two bodies , on the orbital parameters and on the analytic parameters of the @xmath0-theory as the coefficients @xmath31 and @xmath68 of the taylor expansion .",
    "a first result we present is the analytical solution of the quadrupole radiation rate in which it is possible separate the gr contribution and the one due to the @xmath0-gravity .",
    "we should note that the correction depends on the eccentricity of the orbit and on the orbital period of the binary system , and specifically , the radiation rate is a function of @xmath31 and @xmath68 . according to eq .",
    ", we have selected a sample of relativistic binary systems for which the first derivative of the orbital period is observed , we have computed the theoretical quadrupole radiation rate , and finally we have compared it to binary system observations . from tab .",
    "[ table2 ] , it is seen that the first five systems have masses determined in a manner quite reliable , while for the remaining sample , masses are estimated by requiring that the mass of the pulsar is @xmath113 and , assuming for the orbital inclination one of the usual statistical values ( @xmath114 or @xmath115 ) , and from here comes then the estimate of the mass of the companion star .",
    "so a primary cause of major discrepancies , not only for the etgs , but also for the gr theory , between the variation of the observed orbital period and the predicted effect of emission of gravitational waves , could be a mistake in the estimation of the masses of the system . in addition , other causes may be attributable to the evolutionary state of the system , which , for instance , if it does not consist of two neutron stars may transfer mass from companion to the neutron star . in our sample",
    ", there are only five double ns that can be used to test gr and etgs .",
    "taking into account of the strong hypothesis we made , the extended theory correction to @xmath116 can also include the galactic acceleration term correction ( @xcite , @xcite ) . here",
    ", we give a preliminary result about the energy loss from binary systems and we show that , when the nature of the binary systems can exclude energy losses due to trade or loss of matter , then , we can explain the gap between the first time derivative of the observed orbital period and the theoretical one predicted by gr , using an analytical @xmath0-theory of gravity . in conclusion ,",
    "to improve the estimation of the @xmath0-coefficients , we need : to consider the hydrodynamic effects due to the transfer of the matter in the binary system , in order to analyze different systems from double ns ; and to improve the estimations of the mass of the stars in the binary systems without prior on pulsar mass and orbital inclination .",
