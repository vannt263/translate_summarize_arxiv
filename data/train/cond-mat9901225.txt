    "a large amount of research suggests that prices are related with information , and in particular it focuses on efficiency in financial markets .",
    "a market is inefficient if a speculator can make a profit out of information present in the market .",
    "since the celebrated work of fama  @xcite a big effort has been done to test empirically and to understand theoretically the efficiency of financial markets .",
    "a market is said to be efficient if prices `` fully reflect '' all available information , i.e. such information is completely exploited in order to determine the price , after having taken into account the costs to use this information and a transient time , due to costs , to reach equilibrium .",
    "the idea is that the investor destroys information while using it and as a consequence he contributes to produce equilibrium .    in the last years",
    "long term correlations have been observed in financial markets .",
    "we shall not review in details the contributions to the field .",
    "we stress that long term return anomalies are usually revealed via test of efficiency in a _ semi - strong _ form , i.e. not only considering the asset prices but also some other publicly known news .",
    "the interest is generally focused on the market reactions to an event occurred a fixed period time before ( three to five typically ) such as divested firms  @xcite , mergers  @xcite or initial public offerings  @xcite .",
    "recent research  @xcite has pointed out the existence of long range correlations also in the _ weak _ form .",
    "however only low frequency data are considered and implications on efficiency are not completely understood .    in this paper",
    "we focus on efficiency in the _ weak _ form , i.e we consider only the information coming from historical prices .",
    "we are interested on a time scale longer than the typical correlation returns time ( few minutes ) but lower than the characteristic time after which we do not have statistical relevance of the results : in this sense we deal with _ long term _ return anomalies .",
    "currency exchange seems to be the natural subject for an efficiency test .",
    "we expect that such markets are very efficient as a consequence of the large liquidity .    for these reasons",
    "we have decided to analyze a one year high frequency dataset of the deutschemark / us dollar exchange , the most liquid market .",
    "our data , made available by olsen and associated , contains all worldwide @xmath4 bid  ask deutschemark / us dollar exchange rate quotes registered by the inter - bank reuters network over the period october 1 , 1992 to september 30 , 1993 .",
    "one of the main problem in tick data analysis , is the irregular spacing of quotes . in this paper",
    "we consider _ business _ time , i.e. the time of the transaction given by its rank in the sequence of quotes .",
    "this seems to be a reasonable way to consider time in a worldwide time series , where time delays and lags of no transaction are often due to geographical reasons .    in this paper",
    "we test the independence hypothesis of returns and define and measure an _ available _ information . in section * 2 * we check the independence with two different techniques .",
    "the first one , called structure functions analysis , shows whether it is possible to rescale properly the distribution functions at different lags  @xcite .",
    "the second one is a direct independence test .",
    "the independence of two random variables @xmath5 , @xmath6 implies that @xmath7 and @xmath8 are uncorrelated for every @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "we check it for @xmath11 .",
    "we interpret these quantities as an estimate of the correlation between returns of given size .",
    "we want to quantify the _ available _ information and discuss its financial relevance . in section * 3 * we consider a speculator with a given resolution , i.e. he is concerned only about fluctuations at least of size @xmath2 .",
    "this reminds the @xmath1 entropy introduced by kolmogorov  @xcite in the context of information theory .",
    "a similar filter has been first introduced by alexander  @xcite . to show the inefficiency of the market he proposed the following trading rule  :",
    "if the return moves up of @xmath2 , buy and hold until it goes down of @xmath2 from a subsequent high , then sell and maintain the short position till the return rises again of @xmath2 above a subsequent low .    here",
    "we divide the problem in two parts .",
    "first we define the _ available _ information for any fixed resolution @xmath2 of the speculator .",
    "second , as suggested by fama  @xcite , we relate the _ available _ information with the profitability by means of a particular trading rule .",
    "we show how this information is related to the optimal growth rate portfolio using a simple approximation in terms of markov process .    in section * 4 * we summarize and discuss the results .",
    "after the seminal work of bachelier  @xcite , it was widely believed that the price variations follow an independent , zero mean , gaussian process .",
    "the main implications of the `` fundamental principle '' of bachelier are that the price variation is a martingale and it is an independent random process .",
    "bachelier considers the market a `` fair game ''  : a speculator can not exploit previous information to make better predictions of forthcoming events .",
    "information can come only from correlations and in absence of them from the shape of the probability distribution of the returns .",
    "for about sixty years this contribution was practically forgotten , and quantitative analysis on financial data started again with advent of computers .",
    "following fama  @xcite , we shall call hereafter `` random walk '' the financial models where the returns    @xmath12    are independent variables . in this paper",
    "we define @xmath13 as the average between bid and ask price . we do not want to enter here in a detailed analysis of the huge literature about `` random walk '' models .",
    "we just mention that , before the contribution of mandelbrot  @xcite , the return @xmath14 was considered well approximated by an independent gaussian process .",
    "mandelbrot proposed that the returns were distributed according a levy - stable , still remaining independent random variables .    at present",
    ", it is commonly accepted that the variables @xmath15 do not behave according a gaussian at small @xmath0 , while the gaussian behavior is recovered for large @xmath0 .",
    "of course a return @xmath14 distributed according to a levy , as suggested by mandelbrot , is stable under composition and then also @xmath16 would follow the same distribution for every @xmath0 .",
    "a recent proposal is the truncated levy distribution model introduced by mantegna and stanley  @xcite which fits well the data and reproduces the transition from small to large @xmath0 .",
    "let us focus our attention on independence tests .",
    "we remark once again that an influence of the return @xmath14 at time @xmath17 on the return @xmath18 at time @xmath19 implies a not fully efficient market in a _",
    "weak _ form .",
    "the relevance of the question is clear in the case of an investor analyzing historical data to a make market forecast and a profit out of it .    as a test of independence",
    "it is generally considered the correlation functions on time intervals @xmath0 @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the temporal average @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the size of the sample .",
    "the presence of correlations in deutschemark / us dollar exchange returns before the nineties is a well known fact .",
    "for example in  @xcite , where it is considered the same dataset we use , it is shown that the returns are negatively correlated for about three minutes .",
    "we remind that in general uncorrelation does not imply independence .",
    "a sort of long term memory can be revealed with appropriate tools , see for example the seminal works in the field of alexander  @xcite and niederhoffer and osborne  @xcite , and the most recent literature @xcite , where it is shown that absolute returns or powers of returns exhibit a long range correlation .",
    "it is a common belief that it is not possible to exploit this kind of information because of transaction costs .",
    "we shall show in next section that dependent ( even if uncorrelated ) returns have a clear financial meaning because they imply the existence of _ available _ information .    in subsection *",
    "2.1 * we show the persistence of a long range memory for the deutschemark / us dollar exchange rate by means of the analysis of structure functions . in subsection * 2.2 * , we test directly the independence of returns with a generalization of the correlation analysis .",
    "there is some evidence that the process @xmath16 can not be described in terms of a unique scaling exponent  @xcite , i.e. it is not possible to find a real number @xmath24 such that the statistical properties of the new random variable @xmath25 do not depend on @xmath0 .",
    "the scaling exponent @xmath24 gives us information on the features of the underlying process . in the case of independent gaussian behavior of @xmath14",
    "the scaling exponent is @xmath26 .    on the contrary ,",
    "the data show that the probability distribution function of @xmath27}$ ] changes with @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "this is an indication that @xmath14 is a dependent stochastic process and it implies the presence of wild fluctuations .    a way to show these features , which is standard for the fully developed turbulence theory  @xcite , is to study the structure functions  :",
    "@xmath28    in the simple case where @xmath14 is an independent random process , one has ( for a certain range of @xmath0 ) @xmath29 where @xmath30 in the levy - stable case while the gaussian behavior is recovered for @xmath31 .",
    "the truncated levy distribution corresponds to @xmath30 for @xmath0 sufficiently small and to @xmath31 at large @xmath0 .",
    "`` random walk '' models present always a unique scaling exponent . if the structure function has the behavior in ( [ eq : selfaffine ] ) we call the process self - affine ( sometimes called uni - fractal )",
    "as previously mentioned a description in terms of a unique scaling exponent @xmath24 , does not work .",
    "therefore instead of ( [ eq : selfaffine ] ) one has @xmath32 where @xmath33 are called scaling exponents of order @xmath34 .",
    "if @xmath33 is not linear , the process is called multi - affine ( sometimes multi - fractal ) . using simple arguments it is possible to see that @xmath33 has to be a convex function of @xmath34  @xcite .",
    "the larger is the difference of @xmath33 from the linear behavior in @xmath34 the wilder are the fluctuations and the correlations of returns . in this sense",
    "the deviation from a linear shape for @xmath35 gives an indication of the relevance of correlations .    in figure",
    "[ fig : fni strutt ] we plot , the @xmath36 for three different values of @xmath34 .",
    "a multi - affine behavior is exhibited by different slopes of @xmath37 _ vs. _ @xmath38 , at least for @xmath0 between @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "for larger _ business _ lags a spurious behavior can arise because of the finite size of the dataset considered . in the insert we plot",
    "the @xmath35 estimated by standard linear regression of @xmath41 _ vs. _ @xmath38 for the values of @xmath0 mentioned before . to give an estimation of errors ,",
    "the most natural way turns out to be a division of the year dataset in two semesters .",
    "this is natural in the financial context , since it is a measure of reliability of the second semester forecast based on the first one .",
    "we observe that the traditional stock market theory ( brownian motion for returns ) , gives a reasonable agreement with @xmath42 only for @xmath43 , while for @xmath44 one as @xmath45 with @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "we stress once again that such a behavior can not be explained by a `` random walk '' model ( or other self - affine models ) and this effect is a clear evidence of correlations present in the signal .",
    "let us consider the absolute returns series @xmath48 , which is often shown to be long range correlated in recent literature @xcite .",
    "absolute values mean that we are interested only in the size of fluctuations .",
    "let us introduce the generalized correlations @xmath49 : @xmath50 we shall see that the above functions will be a powerful tool to study correlations of returns with comparable size : small returns are more relevant at small @xmath34 , while @xmath49 is dominated by large returns at large @xmath34 ( the usual definition of correlation for absolute returns is recovered for @xmath51 ) .",
    "following the definitions in @xcite , let us suppose to have a long memory for the absolute returns series , i.e. the correlations @xmath49 approaches zero very slowly at increasing @xmath0 , i.e. @xmath49 is a power - law : @xmath52    if @xmath53 is an uncorrelated process one has @xmath54 , while @xmath55 less than @xmath56 corresponds to long range memory .    instead of directly computing correlations @xmath49 of single returns we consider rescaled sums of returns .",
    "this is a well established way , if one is interested only in long term analysis , in order to drastically reduce statistical errors that can affect our quantities  @xcite .",
    "let us introduce the _ generalized cumulative absolute returns _ @xcite @xmath57 and their variance @xmath58 after some algebra ( see appendix ) , one can show that if @xmath49 for large @xmath0 is a power - law with exponent @xmath55 , then @xmath59 is a power - law with the same exponent  : @xmath60    in other words the hypothesis of long range memory for absolute returns ( @xmath61 ) , can be checked via the numerical analysis of @xmath59 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : correlations ] we plot the @xmath62 _ vs. _ @xmath0 in log - log scale , for three different values of @xmath34 .",
    "the variance @xmath59 is affected by small statistical errors , and it confirms the persistence of a long range memory for a @xmath0 larger than @xmath39 and up to @xmath40 .    the exponent @xmath55 can be profitably estimated by standard linear regression of @xmath63 _ versus _",
    "@xmath64 , and the errors are estimated in the same way of subsection * 2.1*.    we notice in the insert that the `` random walk '' model behavior is remarkably different from the one observed in the deutschemark / us dollar exchange for @xmath65 .",
    "this implies the presence of strong correlations , while one has @xmath66 for large values of @xmath34 , i.e. big fluctuations are practically independent .",
    "an intuitive meaning of the previous results is the following .",
    "using different @xmath34 one selects different sizes of the fluctuations .",
    "therefore the non trivial shape of @xmath55 is an indication of the existence of long term anomalies .",
    "let us focus our attention on information analysis of the return @xmath14 . we must treat the dataset in such a way that methods of information theory can be applied .",
    "the usual approach is the codification of the original data in a symbolic sequence .",
    "there are several ways to build up such a sequence : one should make sure that this treatment does not change the structure of the process underlying the evolution of the financial data .    in order to construct a symbolic sequence from a time series ,",
    "at least two steps are needed  :    * a _ filtering _ procedure to remove most of the noise in the dataset . * a _ coarse graining _ procedure to partition the range of variability of the filtered data , in order to assign a conventional symbol to each element of the partition .",
    "the codification is then straightforward : a symbol corresponds unambiguously to the data stored in each element of the partition .    from the original signal @xmath14",
    "we obtain a discrete symbolic sequence  : @xmath67 where each @xmath68 takes only a finite number , say @xmath69 , of values .",
    "in such a way we reduce ourself to the study of a discrete stochastic process .",
    "a simple way to obtain a symbolic sequence is to consider only a two - valued symbol and define a discrete random variable without performing any filtering operation  : @xmath70    the financial meaning of this codification is rather evident : the symbol @xmath71 occurs if the stock price decreases , otherwise the symbol is @xmath56 .",
    "let us now remind some basic concepts of information theory .",
    "consider a sequence of @xmath72 symbols @xmath73 and its probability @xmath74 .",
    "the block entropy @xmath75 is defined by @xmath76    the difference @xmath77 represents the average information needed to specify the symbol @xmath78 given the previous knowledge of the sequence @xmath79 .",
    "the series of @xmath80 is monotonically not increasing and for an _ ergodic _ process one has @xmath81 where @xmath24 is the shannon entropy  @xcite .",
    "it is easy to show that if the stochastic process @xmath82 is markovian of order @xmath83 ( _ i.e. _ the probability to have @xmath84 at time @xmath72 depends only on the previous @xmath83 steps @xmath85 ) , then @xmath86 for @xmath87 . in other cases , or",
    "@xmath80 goes to zero for increasing @xmath72 which means that either for @xmath72 sufficiently large the @xmath88th - symbol is predictable knowing the sequence @xmath89 or it tends to a positive finite value .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath24 is @xmath90 .",
    "it occurs if the process has no memory at all and the @xmath69 symbols have the same probability .",
    "the difference between @xmath90 and @xmath24 is intuitively the quantity of information we may use to predict the next result of the phenomenon we observe , i.e. the market behavior .",
    "we define _ available _ information  : @xmath91 where @xmath92 is called the _ redundancy _ of the process  @xcite .",
    "hereafter we limit the discrete process to take only two values , @xmath71 and @xmath56 which have an evident financial meaning .",
    "we expect that the high frequency details are not relevant and can not be easily used by financial analysts .",
    "it seems rather reasonable to study the process @xmath14 with a finite lag @xmath0 ( see subsection * 3.1 * ) or a finite resolution @xmath2 on the values of @xmath14 ( see subsection * 3.2 * ) .    in the following we shall show that different discretization procedures lead to completely different results .",
    "this corresponds to two different kind of investment , one _ systematic _ and the other _",
    "patient_. the _ systematic _ investor modifies his portfolio every @xmath0 steps , where the lag @xmath0 is measured in the usual _ business _ time ( but the same results hold also for the _ calendar _ time ) .",
    "the _ patient _",
    "investor , instead , waits to update his strategy until a certain behavior of the market is achieved , for example , a fluctuation of size @xmath2 .    in the last part of this section",
    "we shall show that this kind of investment seems to be the most suitable for financial aims .      in a recently proposed time series model  @xcite the price variation",
    "is considered as a result of a true underlying process plus an uncorrelated white noise .",
    "if we think the observed return as the sum of these two components , it is natural to try to eliminate the additional noise taking the average of the signal over a given lag .",
    "more precisely we treat the financial data as follows  :    * we group the sequence of the @xmath14 in non overlapping blocks of @xmath0 data and we define the sum of the data in the @xmath93 block @xmath94 notice that @xmath95 is equivalent to @xmath96 where @xmath16 is defined in equation  ( [ eq : r_tau - definition ] ) .",
    "* we decimate the data , i.e. we take from the sequence @xmath95 only one data every @xmath69  : @xmath97 this procedure should eliminate the eventual short time correlation of the noise .",
    "* we build up the symbolic sequence , like in equation  ( [ eq : filtro1 ] )  : @xmath98    let us remark that the first two steps have been performed to reduce the noise .",
    "the total number of the data of the symbolic sequence is @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the number of original data .",
    "this filter is linear , i.e. if the signal is a linear combination of various contributes , at the end of the filtering procedure we have the sum of the filtered contributes . the theory of linear filter is well developed in literature ( see for example @xcite ) , and we use this simple approach to check whether a noise is added to our signal .    at this point",
    "we have a binary sequence from which we compute the shannon entropy .",
    "figure [ fig : entrdecimediate ] reports the results of our analysis for the linear filter .",
    "we plot @xmath80 vs @xmath72 for various @xmath0 and @xmath69 , compared with the entropy of bernoulli trials with probability @xmath101 ( this is nothing that the usual coin tossing ) .",
    "we know that the entropy @xmath80 of a fair binary bernoulli trial must be @xmath102 for every @xmath72 .",
    "the folding of @xmath80 at large @xmath72 depends on the finite number of sequence elements .",
    "it can be proved @xcite that the statistical analysis does not give the proper value of @xmath80 for @xmath72 larger than  : @xmath103 where @xmath24 is the entropy of the signal and @xmath100 is the length of the sequence .",
    "it should be now clear that the entropy of the sequence is given by the value of the _",
    "plateau_.    the entropy does not differ sensibly from @xmath102 , of the coin tossing , and , therefore , we can not make prevision on the market . in conclusion ,",
    "the financial data can not be represented as a white noise added on a true underlying signal .",
    "nevertheless , because of the long term correlations ( see section * 2 * ) , there is a clear indication that the present state of the market depends non trivially on the past .",
    "the failure of the previous analysis lead us to try another approach in order to keep the information present in the financial data , this time we use a non - linear filter with a clear financial meaning .    the procedure to create the symbolic sequence is now  :    * we fix a resolution value @xmath2 and we define @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the initial _ business _ time , and @xmath106 .",
    "we wait until an exit time @xmath107 such as  : @xmath108 in this way we consider only market fluctuations of amplitude @xmath2 . since the distribution of the returns is _ almost _",
    "symmetric , the threshold @xmath2 has been chosen equal for both positive and negative values .",
    "starting from @xmath109 we obtain with the same procedure @xmath110 . *",
    "following the previous prescription we create a sequence of returns @xmath111 from which we obtain the symbolic dynamics  : @xmath112 we define @xmath83 as @xmath2 _ trading _ time , i.e. we enumerate only the transactions at which @xmath2 is reached .",
    "let us notice that the variable @xmath113 has a narrow distribution close to the threshold , and for all practical purposes @xmath113 can be well approximated with @xmath2 . in figure",
    "[ fig : distrtd ] we show an example of evolution of the @xmath114 .",
    "the entropy analysis of the symbolic sequence @xmath115 gives a completely different result from the one in the previous section . in figure",
    "[ fig : hentrdelta ] it is shown that the entropy is clearly different from @xmath102 in a wide range of @xmath2 , i.e. there is a set of @xmath2 for which the _ available _ information ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : avainfo ] ) ) is very large .    in figure",
    "[ fig : entrtrans ] we plot the _ available _ information _ versus _ @xmath2 and the distribution of transaction costs .",
    "because these two quantities do not have similar size they are plotted on different vertical scales but they are superimposed to make easier comparison between them .",
    "we observe that the maximum of the _ available _ information is almost in correspondence to the maximum of the distribution of the transaction cost .",
    "we have estimated the transaction costs @xmath116 as @xmath117 of course this is an upper bound for the true transaction cost .",
    "we notice that the _ available _ information is almost equal zero when we consider very small and very large values of @xmath2 .",
    "these limit values can not be reached for two different reasons ; since @xmath13 can assume only discrete values , it is not possible to take the limit @xmath118 .",
    "in addition , we can not compute @xmath119 for large @xmath2 because in the sequence @xmath114 there are not enough data for an efficient statistical analysis .",
    "we focus our attention on optimal strategies in a financial market with non zero _ available _ information .",
    "we then show the economic relevance of such a quantity in case of _ weak _ efficiency of the market .",
    "consider the optimal growth rate strategy for a _ patient _ speculator .",
    "the returns @xmath115 are almost symmetrically distributed and they can be well approximated by the two threshold values @xmath2 and @xmath120 .",
    "we shall only deal with the markovian case .",
    "in fact as suggested by figure [ fig : hentrdelta ] and shown in  @xcite , one has that the markovian approximation well reproduces the signal filtered with a fixed resolution @xmath2 .",
    "the symmetry of the return distribution and the markovian nature of the process implies that the transition matrix is close to @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the probability to have @xmath123 at @xmath2 _ trading _ time @xmath124 , knowing that @xmath125 was @xmath123 at time @xmath17 .    in this particular case",
    "the _ available _ information is  : @xmath126    we focus our attention on an investor who decides to diversify his portfolio only in a security asset with a given interest rate return @xmath127 , and to invest , every @xmath2 _ trading _ time @xmath17 , a fraction @xmath128 of his capital in the deutschemark / us dollar exchange .",
    "our convention is that the fraction @xmath129 is positive if he exchange dollars into marks , negative vice versa , and we allow the speculator to borrow money from a bank .",
    "we assume a vanishing interest rate return .",
    "this hypothesis is reasonable : in the period we are dealing with , the official discount rate fixed by the federal reserve is of 3 percent per year and fluctuates between 5.75 and 8.75 percent in the german case .",
    "the _ patient _",
    "speculator rehedges his portfolio on average every @xmath130 seconds when @xmath2 is equal to the mean transaction cost .",
    "the largest @xmath2 corresponds to an average time of @xmath131 hours of standby . in the time",
    "scales involved the true interest rate return is about one hundred times smaller than @xmath2 : the approximation of a vanishing interest rate appears to be fair .",
    "we deal with the no transaction costs case : this will allow us to understand easily the meaning of _ available _ information for a _ patient _ investor .",
    "the more general situation with transaction costs is treated in detail in  @xcite .",
    "let us focus on the investment at time @xmath17 : the speculator commits a fraction @xmath128 in dollars .",
    "at the following time step @xmath132 his capital becomes @xmath133    we notice that , a consequence of the symmetry , is that the optimal @xmath128 can assume only two values @xmath134 where @xmath129 is a real number .",
    "we define the _ profitable _ information as the exponential rate of the capital of an investor who follows an optimal growth rate strategy . the strict connection between this quantity and the _ available _ information was first noticed by kelly  @xcite , who , considering an elementary gambling game , first gave an interpretation of shannon entropy in the context of optimal investment .",
    "the computation of capital growth rate is a simple application of  @xcite , and for the investment above described is @xmath135 it reaches its maximum for @xmath136 an intuitive consequence of equation ( [ eq : optimal_l ] ) is that an anti - persistent return ( @xmath137 ) , as in the financial series we have considered , implies that the optimal strategy is to buy marks if the dollar rises , and to do the opposite otherwise . of course a persistent case ( @xmath138 )",
    "would imply an @xmath128 greater than zero every time the positive threshold @xmath2 is reached .",
    "from ( [ eq : lyapunov ] ) and ( [ eq : optimal_l ] ) one has that the optimal growth rate is equal to the _ available _ information : @xmath139    we stress that the equivalence between _ available _ and _ profitable _ information , if we forget the costs involved in this trading rule , means that a speculator , who follows a particular strategy , has the possibility to obtain a growth rate of his capital exactly equal to this information : this makes clear why we have called it _",
    "profitable_.    we underline that we have considered the growth rate measuring the time in @xmath2 _ trading _ time . to obtain the exponential rate of the capital in the usual _ calendar _ time we have to normalize ( [ eq : lyapunov ] ) with the average exit time for the specified @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "for example for @xmath140 corresponding to the maximum _ available _ information is characterized by @xmath141 seconds .",
    "this means that the average optimal growth rate is equal to @xmath142 percent per second .",
    "a naive consequence of previous results could be that an efficient market hypothesis should be rejected .",
    "unfortunately ( for the authors ) this is not obvious .",
    "we have previously noticed that the _ available _ information can be transformed in _ profitable _",
    ", let us now comment the feasibility of the proposed trading rule .",
    "when @xmath2 is near the value of the maximum _ available _ information , the speculator changes his position with high frequency , and @xmath2 is comparable with transaction costs : it is not any more possible to neglect them .",
    "furthermore in equation ( [ eq : optimal_l ] ) @xmath2 appears at the denominator , and then the values of @xmath143 can be enormous .",
    "for example for @xmath2 corresponding to the maximum of the _ available _ information , the speculator who follows the optimal growth rate strategy , should borrow @xmath144 times the capital he has !",
    "even a small fluctuation from the expected average behavior can lead to bankruptcy .    on the other hand",
    "if he wants to use reasonable values of @xmath143 , he has to chose a sufficiently large @xmath2 ; in this situation the filtered series is almost indistinguishable from a `` random walk '' and then there is almost no _ available _ information .",
    "we have now all the ingredients to comment the shape of the _ available _ information shown in figure  [ fig : entrtrans ] .",
    "the speculator can not have a resolution @xmath2 lower than the transaction costs , profits from such an investment would be in fact less than costs . therefore in this range of @xmath2",
    "the _ available _ information increases .",
    "the discretization of the prize changes does not allow for reaching in a continuous way @xmath145 , where the `` random walk '' model is practically recovered as shown in the first part of this section .    for @xmath2 larger than the transaction",
    "costs the information can be exploited by proper strategies",
    ". however , small fluctuations are more difficult to detect and to distinguish from the `` noise '' and the _ profitable _ information is almost useless because of the huge values of @xmath143 involved .",
    "this fact is even more evident when transaction costs are included .    on the other hand for large @xmath2 ,",
    "the investors are able to discover the _",
    "available _ information and to make it profitable with a feasible strategy . as a consequence ,",
    "the efficient equilibrium is than restored for all practical purposes .",
    "let us briefly mention what happens instead to the _ systematic _ investor .",
    "we can repeat exactly the above discussion and the only difference is that now he decides to modify his portfolio every @xmath0 _ business _ time . because there is almost no _ available _ information ( see subsection * 3.1 * ) the optimal growth rate of his capital is vanishing even without considering the costs involved in the transactions .",
    "in this paper we have considered the long term anomalies in the deutschemark / us dollar quotes in the period from october 1 , 1992 to september 30 , 1993 and we have analyzed the consequences on the _ weak _ efficiency of this market .    in section",
    "* 2 * we have shown the presence of long term anomalies with two techniques : the structure functions and a generalization of the usual correlation analysis . in particular we have pointed out that `` random walk '' models ( or other self - affine models ) can not describe these features .",
    "once we have shown the existence of correlations in financial process , we have tested whether they allow for a _",
    "profitable _ strategy .",
    "with such a goal in mind , in section * 3 * we have first introduced a direct measure of the _ available _ information , then we have shown in a particular case that this is equivalent to a _",
    "profitable _ information .",
    "in other words following a suitable trading rule it is possible in absence of transaction costs to have an exponential growth rate of the capital equal to this information .    we have measured the _ available _ information with a technique which reminds the kolmogorov @xmath1 entropy .",
    "two different codifications for financial series ( fixed lag @xmath0 and finite resolution @xmath2 ) lead to completely different results .",
    "the _ available _ information strongly depends on the kind of investment the speculator has in mind .",
    "we show that if he wants to change his position _ systematically _ at fixed lags @xmath0 the _ available _ information is practically zero : for this investor the market is efficient .    instead , a _ patient _",
    "investor , who waits to modify his portfolio till the asset has a fluctuation @xmath2 , observes a finite _ available _ information .",
    "however , the existence of such a trading rule does not imply that the investment is feasible in practice .",
    "namely we show that when reasonable investments are involved almost no _ available _ information survives . on the contrary , it is extremely difficult to use it when it is still present .",
    "the technique described here can be considered as a powerful tool to test _ weak _ efficiency  : the speculator contributes to reach efficient equilibria destroying the _ available _ information that could be exploited in practice .",
    "the efficiency hypothesis is then restored for almost all practical purposes .",
    "in this appendix we show that if the correlations @xmath49 exhibit a long range memory @xmath146 then also the variance @xmath59 of the _ generalized cumulative absolute returns _ @xmath147 behaves at large @xmath0 as @xmath148 .    making explicit expression of @xmath149 ( see equation ( [ eq : defchi ] ) ) one can write equation ( [ eq : defvarchi ] ) as  : @xmath150 taking into account the fact that @xmath14 is a stationary process , and using the definition of @xmath49 , one has : @xmath151 where @xmath152 the expression of @xmath59 can be rewritten as : @xmath153 under the hypothesis @xmath146 , one has for large @xmath0 @xmath154 which leads to  : @xmath155 since @xmath156 , the thesis follows , i.e.  : @xmath157",
