    "global optimization ( go ) is essentially a mathematical task .",
    "namely , for the class of go problems i will be particularly considering here , it is to find the absolute minimum ( or maximum ) of a cost function , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 belongs to a subset @xmath2 of euclidean n - space , @xmath3 @xcite , i.e.@xmath4 although the applications of global optimization span a wide range of fields  from the economics of business in the travelling salesman problem to biophysics in the lowest - energy structure of a protein  this does not take away from the essentially mathematical nature of the optimization problem .",
    "so why do i wish to discuss the _ physical _ aspects of global optimization ? to begin with we should realize that even for go problems that do not correspond to a physical system , physical properties can be associated with the system by thinking of the cost function as a potential energy function , @xmath5 .",
    "this allows the thermodynamics of the system to be defined .",
    "when the system is at equilibrium at a temperature @xmath6 each point @xmath1 in configuration space will be sampled with a probability proportional to its boltzmann weight , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "furthermore , for systems with continuous coordinates the forces , @xmath9 , associated with each coordinate can be obtained from the gradient of the cost function , i.e.  @xmath10 .",
    "once masses are associated with each coordinate , the dynamics are then defined through newton s equations of motion .",
    "if one wishes the system s dynamics can then be simulated by integrating these equations of motion , as in the molecular dynamics method @xcite .",
    "even when the coordinates can only take discrete values , monte carlo ( mc ) simulations can still provide a pseudo - dynamics with the number of steps taking the role of time .",
    "of course , this connection to physics is most transparent , and most natural , when the system being optimized is a physical system , which has a real ( and potentially observable ) thermodynamics and dynamics .",
    "furthermore , in those cases where the cost function does truly correspond to the potential energy of the system , there is another physical dimension to the problem ",
    "how is the structure of the global minimum determined by the physical interactions between the atoms and molecules that make up @xmath11 ?    given that we have established that physical properties can be associated with any system being optimized , what relevance does this physics have to the task of global optimization ?",
    "firstly , many go algorithm have drawn their inspiration from physics .",
    "most famously , simulated annealing is analogous to the slow cooling of a melt to allow the formation of a near perfect crystal , the idea being that if equilibrium is maintained in the simulation as the system is cooled , then at zero temperature it must end up in the global minimum @xcite .",
    "there are many other physically - motivated go approaches .",
    "the extension of statistical thermodynamics to systems with non - extensive thermodynamics through the use of tsallis statistics @xcite has led to a generalized simulated annealing @xcite which is no longer tied to the boltzmann distribution and is often more efficient than standard simulated annealing .",
    "genetic algorithms imitate the biophysical evolution of the genome @xcite .",
    "and i could go on .    however , this is not the link between physics and global optimization that is my focus here .",
    "rather , i wish to show how the ease or difficulty of global optimization is often intimately linked to the physics of the system .",
    "the insights obtained from understanding the physical basis for the success or failure of an algorithm not only provide an understanding of the limitations of the method and a basis for assessing the likelihood of success in future applications , but also aid the development of new algorithms by identifying the main physical challenges that need to be overcome to enable greater efficiency and suggesting the type of physical behaviour that would need to be incorporated into an improved algorithm .",
    "i will attempt to achieve this aim by concentrating on one class of problems , namely the global minimization of the potential energy of an atomic cluster .",
    "furthermore , i will mainly concentrate on model systems where the cost function is computationally cheap to evaluate , enabling the physical properties of these systems to be comprehensively examined and understood . as outlined by hartke elsewhere in this book @xcite",
    ", this class of problems is of great general interest to the chemical physics community , because the identification of a cluster s structure is often a prerequisite for understanding its other physical and chemical properties .",
    "in this chapter i start at the ` end ' , first showing the structures of the putative global minima for a number of cluster systems in order that the reader can understand some of the physical principles that determine the structure and how these relate to the interatomic interactions .",
    "furthermore , the structure provides a basis for understanding a cluster s thermodynamic and dynamic properties , especially when , as in some of our examples , the competition between different structural types plays an important role .",
    "i then consider some of the go algorithms that are most successful for these systems focussing on those that use the basin - hopping transformation of @xmath11 @xcite and on how the performance of these algorithms depend on the system and the cluster size .",
    "i then look at the physical properties of some of the clusters , relating these back to the ease or difficulty of global optimization .",
    "i firstly examine the topography of the multi - dimensional surface defined by @xmath11 ( the so - called potential energy surface ( pes ) or energy landscape ) , then the thermodynamics and dynamics .",
    "finally , i show why basin - hopping is able to locate the global minimum in those clusters where the pes has a multiple - funnel topography , and make some suggestions as to how further gains in efficiency might be secured .",
    "in this section i mainly concentrate on the structures of model clusters , where the interactions have simple idealized forms that are isotropic , thus favouring compact geometries .",
    "the models have been chosen so that they span a wide range of structural behaviour that is likely to be relevant to rare gas , metal and molecular clusters bound by dispersion forces , but not to clusters with directional covalent bonding or molecular clusters with directional intermolecular forces , as with the hydrogen bonding in water clusters .",
    "three examples of the structures clusters can adopt : ( a ) a 38-atom truncated octahedron , ( b ) a 55-atom mackay icosahedron , and ( c ) a 75-atom marks decahedron .",
    "these clusters have the optimal shape for the three main types of regular packing seen in clusters : close - packed , icosahedral and decahedral , respectively .",
    "the mackay icosahedron is a common structure and is observed for rare gas @xcite and many metal @xcite clusters .",
    "the truncated octahedron has been recently observed for nickel @xcite and gold @xcite clusters , and the marks decahedron for gold clusters @xcite.,width=340 ]    -0.85 cm    -0.3 cm    most of the clusters we consider have only pair interactions , i.e.   @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the pair potential and @xmath14 is the distance between atoms @xmath15 and @xmath16 . in this case",
    "we can partition the energy into three terms @xcite : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the pair well depth , @xmath19 is the number of nearest neighbours , @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the equilibrium pair distance .",
    "two atoms are defined as nearest neighbours if @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath23 should lie between the first and second coordianation shells and a typical value would be @xmath24 , although the exact value is somewhat arbitrary .",
    "the first term in equation [ eq : esplit ] is the ideal pair energy if all @xmath19 nearest - neighbour pairs lie exactly at the equilibrium pair distance , the strain energy is the energetic penalty for the deviation of nearest - neighbour distances from the equilibrium pair distance and @xmath25 is the contribution to the energy from non - nearest neighbours .",
    "@xmath25 is usually smaller than the other two terms and is relatively independent of the detailed structure .",
    "therefore , the global minimum usually represents the best balance between maximizing @xmath19 and minimizing @xmath26 . for an atom in the interior of a cluster",
    "this is usually achieved through the atom having a coordination number of twelve .",
    "this can be achieved as in close - packing , but another possibility is an icosahedral coordination shell .",
    "@xmath19 is further increased through the cluster having a compact spherical shape , and through the surface mainly consisting of faces with a high co - ordination number .",
    "for example , an atom on a face - centred - cubic ( fcc ) @xmath27 face has nine nearest neighbours , whereas an atom on a @xmath28 face has eight nearest neighbours .",
    "planes corresponds to the close - packed planes , where the atoms in the planes form a grid of equilateral triangles .",
    "the atoms in the @xmath28 planes form a square grid . ]",
    "examples of the strain involved in packing tetrahedra .",
    "( a ) five regular tetrahedra around a common edge produce a gap of @xmath29 .",
    "( b ) twenty regular tetrahedra about a common vertex produce gaps equivalent to a solid angle of 1.54 steradians.,width=264 ]    -1.0 cm    -0.3 cm    the three main types of cluster structure found for systems with isotropic interactions , namely icosahedral , decahedral and close - packed structures , are depicted in figure [ fig : structure_main ] .",
    "these examples have the optimal shape for each structural type , and all have been identified experimentally .",
    "one of the unusual properties of clusters is that they can exhibit non - crystallographic symmetries , because there is no requirement for translational periodicity .",
    "decahedral clusters have a single five - fold axis and are based on a pentagonal bipyramid that can be thought of as five strained fcc tetrahedra sharing a common edge .",
    "the symmetry axis corresponds to this common edge .",
    "the marks decahedron @xcite , which represents the optimal shape for this structural type , can be formed from a pentagonal bipyramid by exposing @xmath28 faces at the equatorial edges then introducing reentrant @xmath27 faces .",
    "mackay icosahedra @xcite have six five - fold axes of symmetry and can be thought of as twenty strained fcc tetrahedra sharing a common edge .",
    "the fcc cluster represented in figure [ fig : structure_main]a is simply a fragment of the bulk fcc lattice .",
    "icosahedral structures generally have the largest @xmath19 because of their spherical shape and @xmath27 faces , and close - packed clusters the smallest @xmath19 because of their higher proportion of @xmath28 faces .",
    "by contrast , close - packed clusters can be unstrained , whereas , as figure [ fig : gaps ] illustrates , decahedra and icosahedra are increasingly strained .",
    "the strain energy is proportional to the volume of the cluster , but differences in @xmath19 are due to surface effects .",
    "therefore , icosahedra are likely to be found at small sizes , but at sufficiently large size , the cluster must take on the bulk structure . at intermediate sizes decahedra",
    "can be most stable .",
    "the sizes at which the crossovers between structural types occur is system dependent .",
    "the structures illustrated in figure [ fig : structure_main ] involve exactly the right number of atoms to form a cluster of the optimal shape .",
    "for example , complete mackay icosahedra can be formed at @xmath30 at intermediate sizes clusters have an incomplete surface layer .",
    "marks decahedra with square @xmath28 faces occur at @xmath31 .",
    "other complete marks decahedra that are less spherical can be found in between these sizes , e.g.  at @xmath32=101 and 146 .",
    "fcc truncated octahedra with regular hexagonal @xmath27 faces can be found at @xmath33 , and other less spherical truncated octahedra can be found , for example , at @xmath32=79 , 116 , 140 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , because the energy of a twin plane is often small , close - packed structures with other forms can also be particularly stable .",
    "four examples are given in figure [ fig : cp ] for @xmath34 .",
    "the 26-atom structure has a hexagonal close - packed ( hcp ) structure ; the 50-atom structure consists of two fragments of the 38-atom structure joined at a twin plane ; the 59-atom structure consists of a 31-atom fcc truncated tetrahedron with each face covered by a 7-atom hexagonal overlayer that occupies the hcp surface sites ; and the 79-atom structure , which is similar to the 50-atom structure , is formed by the introduction of a twin plane into the 79-atom truncated octahedron @xcite .",
    "four examples of stable close - packed structures for @xmath35 .",
    "the sizes are as labelled .",
    "the 59-atoms structure has @xmath36 point group symmetry , and the rest @xmath37.,width=415 ]    -0.8 cm    -0.3 cm    recently , a new structural type called a leary tetrahedron @xcite has been discovered .",
    "an example with 98 atoms is illustrated in figure [ fig : leary_td ] .",
    "at the centre of this structure is an fcc tetrahedron . to each of the faces of this tetrahedron ,",
    "further fcc tetrahedra ( minus an apical atom ) are added , to form a stellated tetrahedron .",
    "finally , the edges of the original tetrahedron are covered by 7-atom hexagonal overlayers .",
    "the coordination along the edges of the central tetrahedron is the same as along the symmetry axis of the decahedron and so the strain energy of this structure is intermediate between icosahedra and decahedra .",
    "it is not yet clear how general this class of structures is .",
    "the 98-atom example is the global minimum for a model potential @xcite and mass spectroscopic studies of clusters of c@xmath38 molecules suggest that ( c@xmath38)@xmath39 has this structure @xcite .",
    "however , it may be that the stability of this structural class is restricted to @xmath32=98 , because this size results in a particularly spherical shape , and that equivalent structures at larger sizes ( e.g.  @xmath32=159 , 195 ) are never competitive .",
    "in this section i focus on clusters bound by the lennard - jones ( lj ) potential @xcite : @xmath40,\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the pair well depth and @xmath41 is the equilibrium pair separation .",
    "the potential is illustrated in figure [ fig : potentials]a , and provides a reasonable description of the interatomic interactions of rare gases , such as argon .",
    "lj clusters have become probably the most common test system for go algorithms for configurational problems .",
    "the number of papers with applications to this model system is now very large , but unfortunately many are distinctly unimpressive , only reporting results for small sizes or failing for relatively simple cases .",
    "i do not attempt to review this literature , but instead refer the interested reader elsewhere @xcite .",
    "front and back views of the 98-atom leary tetrahedron.,width=226 ]    -0.9 cm    -0.3 cm    at small sizes the lj potential is able to accommodate the strain associated with icosahedral packing relatively easily @xcite .",
    "indeed , only for @xmath42 are the majority of global minimum expected to be decahedral and the crossover to fcc clusters has been estimated to occur at @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "this preference for icosahedral packing is also evident from figure [ fig : lj_evn ] where i compare the energies of icosahedral , decahedral and close - packed clusters .",
    "sizes where complete mackay icosahedra are possible ( @xmath32=13 , 55 ) stand out as particularly stable .",
    "the icosahedra are least stable when the overlayer is roughly half - filled . therefore , when especially stable non - icosahedral clusters coincide with these sizes there is a possibility that the global minimum will be non - icosahedral .",
    "there are eight such cases for @xmath44 . at @xmath32=38",
    "the global minimum is the fcc truncated octahedron @xcite ; at @xmath32=7577 @xcite and 102104 @xcite the global minima are marks decahedra ; and at @xmath32=98 the global minimum is a leary tetrahedron @xcite . at these sizes the lines for the decahedral or close - packed structures in figure [ fig : lj_evn ]",
    "dip just below the line for the icosahedra . for @xmath45",
    "there are a further eight non - icosahedral global minima @xcite , all of which are decahedral and which divide into two sets that are based on the complete marks decahedra possible at n=192 and 238 .",
    "( a ) a comparison of the lennard - jones ( lj ) potential with the dzugutov potential ( dz1 ) and a modified version of it ( dz2 ) .",
    "( b ) the morse potential for several values of the range parameter , @xmath46 . , width=415 ]    -0.5 cm    -0.3 cm    in this section i focus on clusters bound by the the morse potential @xcite : @xmath47 where @xmath18 is the pair well depth and @xmath21 is the equilibrium pair separation . in reduced units there is a single adjustable parameter , @xmath46 , which determines the range of the interparticle forces . figure [ fig : potentials]b shows that decreasing @xmath46 increases the range of the attractive part of the potential and softens the repulsive wall , thus widening the potential well .",
    "values of @xmath46 appropriate to a range of materials have been catalogued elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the lj potential has the same curvature at the bottom of the well as the morse potential when @xmath46=6 .",
    "girifalco has obtained an intermolecular potential for c@xmath38 molecules @xcite that is isotropic and short - ranged relative to the equilibrium pair separation with an effective value of @xmath46=13.62 @xcite .",
    "the alkali metals have longer - ranged interactions , for example @xmath46=3.15 has been suggested for sodium @xcite .    the global minima for this system have been found as a function of @xmath46 for all sizes up to @xmath32=80 @xcite.=30 and @xmath46=14 the energy of the global minimum is -106.835790 . ]",
    "equation ( [ eq : esplit ] ) enables us to understand the effect of @xmath46 on cluster structure . as @xmath46 increases and the potential well narrows , the energetic penalty for distances deviating from the equilibrium pair separation increases .",
    "thus , @xmath26 increases for strained structures , and so icosahedral and decahedral structures become disfavoured as @xmath46 increases .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig : mphased ] , which shows how the structure of the global minimum depends on @xmath32 and @xmath46 .",
    "the global minimum generally change from icosahedral to decahedral to close - packed as @xmath46 is increased .",
    "it can be seen that the value of @xmath46 appropriate for the lj potential lies roughly in the middle of the icosahedral region of figure [ fig : mphased ] .",

    "cm    alternatively , the effect of @xmath46 can be thought of in terms of its effect on the crossover sizes at which a particular structural type becomes dominant . as @xmath46 increases ,",
    "the less strained structures become dominant at smaller sizes .",
    "these effects can also be found in real materials .",
    "for example , sodium clusters have been shown to exhibit icosahedral structures up to at least 22000 atoms @xcite , whereas the thermodynamically stable structure of clusters of c@xmath38 molecules have recently been shown to be non - icosahedral for @xmath50 @xcite .    as well as these trends , figure [ fig : mphased ] , of course ,",
    "also reflects the specifics of the structures that are possible at each size , so the boundaries between structural types are not smooth lines but show a lot of detailed structure .",
    "for example , the range of @xmath46 values for which icosahedral structures are most stable is a local maximum at @xmath32=55 because of the complete mackay icosahedra possible at this size . at sizes where close - packed structures have a greater or equal number of nearest neighbours to the best decahedral structure , the global minimum changes directly from icosahedral to close - packed .",
    "a new class of structures appears in the bottom right - hand corner of figure [ fig : mphased ] .",
    "they are polytetrahedral clusters with disclination lines running through them .",
    "a polytetrahedral structure can be decomposed into tetrahedra without any interstices .",
    "the 13-atom icosahedron is an example , and one of the possible ways of adding atoms to the surface of the icosahedron  the so - called anti - mackay overlayer  continues the polytetrahedral packing .",
    "this overlayer does not lead to the next mackay icosahedron but instead to the 45-atom rhombic tricontahedron ( figure [ fig : ptet]a ) , which can be thought of as an icosahedron of interpenetrating icosahedra .",
    "if one imagines adding regular tetrahedra to the form in figure [ fig : gaps]b one soon realizes that the 45-atom structure must be extremely strained , and for this reason it is the global minimum only at low @xmath46 , where this strain can be accommodated . for @xmath51",
    "similar polytetrahedral clusters can be formed but based not on the 13-atom icosahedron but on polyhedra with a higher coordination number .",
    "the two examples in figure [ fig : ptet]a have a 14- and 16-coordinate central atom .",
    "these structures can be described in terms of disclination lines , where the lines pass along those nearest - neighbour contacts that are the common edge for six tetrahedra @xcite .",
    "these types of structures might be thought to be fairly esoteric , but they form the basis for the crystalline frank - kasper phases @xcite where atoms of different size create a preference for coordination numbers higher than 12 , and so they might be good candidate structures for certain mixed metal clusters .",
    "furthermore , they have recently been observed in a model of clusters of heavy metal atoms @xcite , and recent experimental diffraction and electron microscopy data for small cobalt clusters can best be modelled by a disclinated polytetrahedral structure that is a fragment of a frank - kasper phase @xcite .",
    "however , at the size corresponding to this experiment ( @xmath52 ) the long - ranged morse clusters have disordered polytetrahedral global minima .",
    "zero temperature ` phase diagram ' showing the variation of the lowest - energy structure with @xmath32 and @xmath46 .",
    "the data points are the values of @xmath46 at which the global minimum changes .",
    "the lines joining the data points divide the phase diagram into regions where the global minima have similar structures .",
    "the solid lines denote the boundaries between the four main structural types  icosahedral , decahedral , close - packed and those associated with low @xmath46 ( l)and the dashed lines are internal boundaries within a structural type , e.g.  between icosahedra with different overlayers , or between decahedra with different length decahedral axes.,width=434 ]    -0.6 cm    -0.3 cm      in contrast to the potentials that we have so far examined , the dzugutov potential @xcite has a maximum that penalizes distances near to @xmath53 times the equilibrium pair distance ( figure [ fig : potentials]a ) , the distance across the diagonal of the octahedra in close - packed structures .",
    "this maximum loosely resembles the first of the friedel oscillations @xcite often found in effective metal potentials .",
    "the potential was originally designed to suppress crystallization in bulk simulations so that the properties of supercooled liquids and glasses could more easily be studied in a one - component system @xcite . however , under certain conditions it was found that a dodecagonal quasicrystal could be formed on freezing @xcite .",
    "polytetrahedral structures that are the global minima for the ( a ) long - ranged morse potential and ( b ) dzugutov potential .",
    "sizes as labelled .",
    "the point group symmetries of the structures in ( a ) are @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath36 and in ( b ) are @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the disclination networks associated with the 53- and 61-atom structures are illustrated next to the clusters . , width=377 ]    -0.5 cm    -0.3 cm    for clusters the potential will penalize close - packed , decahedral and mackay icosahedral structures ( the latter two because octahedra are found within the fcc tetrahedral units from which the structures are made ) and will favour polytetrahedral clusters .",
    "therefore , one might think that this potential would provide a good model for small cobalt clusters .",
    "however , as can be seen from figure [ fig : potentials]a the potential is narrower than the lj potential , and matching the second derivative at the equilibrium pair separation to that of the morse potential gives an effective value of @xmath46 of 7.52 .",
    "therefore , the potential can not accommodate the strain in compact polytetrahedral clusters . instead , the global minima are non - compact polytetrahedral structures , such as the needles , disc and torus illustrated in figure [ fig : ptet]b @xcite .",
    "these structures are made up of face - sharing or interpenetrating 13-atom icosahedral units . in terms of equation ( [ eq : esplit ] )",
    "they represent the best balance between maximizing @xmath19 whilst minimizing both @xmath26 and @xmath25 , where the latter now corresponds to the total energetic penalty for distances close to @xmath60 .    in order to generate a model that exhibits ordered compact polytetrahedral clusters",
    "a modified dzugutov potential was constructed with an effective value of @xmath46 of 5.16 , allowing it to accommodate more strain ( figure [ fig : potentials]a ) .",
    "preliminary results indicate that the global minima do have the desired structural type , and so this system should be useful in generating realistic candidate structures to compare with the cobalt experiments @xcite .",
    "one of the remarkable features of these simple model potentials is that the structures they exhibit do provide good candidates for the structures of real clusters .",
    "indeed , frequently the structures first identified for these model systems are subsequently identified in experiments .",
    "for example , the special stability of the structures exhibited by the fcc ni@xmath61 @xcite and au@xmath61 @xcite , the decahedral au@xmath62 @xcite and the tetrahedral ( c@xmath38)@xmath39 @xcite were first identified through calculations on lj and morse clusters @xcite .",
    "furthermore , as experiments can rarely identify a cluster s structure directly , but often have to rely on comparison with properties calculated using candidate structures , it is extremely useful to have databases of plausible structures available .",
    "this is the philosophy behind internet repositories such at the cambridge cluster database ( http://brian.ch.cam.ac.uk/ccd.html ) , which contains the global minima for all the potentials described here , and the birmingham cluster website ( http://www.tc.bham.ac.uk/bcweb/ ) .    in comparisons between experiment and theory the role of temperature and kinetics",
    "should be remembered .",
    "the global minimum is only rigorously the equilibrium structure at zero temperature . at higher temperatures other structures",
    "may become more stable due to entropic effects @xcite as we will see in section [ sect : therm ] .",
    "furthermore , it is not always clear whether equilibrium has been achieved under the experimental conditions , especially for clusters formed at low temperature @xcite .",
    "the type of go algorithms in which i am interested are those that find global minima , not those that are also able to _ prove _ that the best structure found is in fact truly global .",
    "unsurprisingly , the latter is a much more demanding task . for example , for lj clusters good putative global minima",
    "have been found up to @xmath32=309 , but only up to @xmath32=7 have these structures been proven to be global @xcite .",
    "of course , the problem with settling for obtaining putative global minima is that it is difficult to know when to give up looking for a lower - energy solution .",
    "for example , to my surprise , at least , a new putative global minimum was recently found for lj@xmath39 @xcite , even though powerful go algorithms had previously been applied to this cluster @xcite .",
    "the failure of these previous attempts to locate the global minimum was not because the algorithms are unable to locate the leary tetrahedron , but simply because the computations had been terminated too soon .",
    "i also wish to concentrate on go algorithms that are unbiased , i.e.  those that do not artificially bias the system towards those structures that physical insight would suggest are low in energy , for example , by seeding the algorithm with fragments of a certain structural type @xcite or by searching on a lattice for a specified structural type @xcite .",
    "of course , such biased algorithms are usually more efficient .",
    "for example , most of the lj global minima were first found using such methods @xcite .",
    "however , they can not cope with ` surprising ' structures that fall outside the expected categories , and lack transferability to other systems , because they have sacrificed generality for greater efficiency in the specific problem instances .",
    "furthermore , they require a sufficient prior understanding of the structure .",
    "this may be possible for the model potentials we consider here , but it is a much more difficult task with the complex interactions that are often necessary to realistically describe a system .",
    "virtually all the global optimization algorithms that are most successful at locating the global minima of clusters have a common feature .",
    "namely , they make extensive use of local minimization .",
    "all go algorithms require elements of both local and global search .",
    "the algorithm has both to be able to explore all regions of configuration space ( overcoming any energy barriers that might hinder this ) whilst also sufficiently sampling the low - energy configurations within each region .",
    "performing local minimizations from configurations generated by a global search is one way of combining these two elements .",
    "simulated annealing provides a perhaps more traditional way of achieving this goal . in simulated annealing , by varying a parameter , the temperature , the nature of the search is changed from global ( at high temperature ) to local ( as @xmath63 ) .",
    "however , this approach has a number of weaknesses .",
    "there is effectively only one local minimization , so if the configuration does not become confined to the basin of attraction of the global minimum as the temperature is reduced the algorithm will fail , even if the system had passed through that basin of attraction at higher temperature .",
    "this condition for success is unnecessarily restrictive and leads to inefficiency .",
    "there is a further element to the most successful algorithms , namely that the energies of the local minima , not of the configurations prior to minimization , are the basis for comparing and selecting structures .",
    "this approach was first used in 1987 by li and scheraga in the application of their ` monte carlo plus minimization ' to polypeptides @xcite . however , despite this approach being independently adopted a number of times subsequently @xcite , it was only in 1997 that it was realized that in this approach one is effectively searching a transformed pes , @xmath64 , where the energy associated with each point in configuration space is that of the minimum obtained by a local minimization from that point @xcite , i.e.   @xmath65 where ` min ' signifies that an energy minimization is carried out starting from @xmath1 . unlike many pes transformations proposed in the name of global optimization , this ` basin - hopping ' transformation is guaranteed to preserve the identity of the global minimum .",

    "is wasted as the system oscillates back and forth within the well surrounding a minimum , waiting for the kinetic energy to become sufficiently localized along the direction of a transition state valley to enable the system to pass into an adjacent minimum .",
    "a similar dynamical ( albeit as a function of steps rather than time ) picture holds for mc when only local moves are used .",
    "the biased random walk is confined to the well around a minimum , frequently being reflected back off the walls of this well , until by chance the system happens to wander over a transition valley into a new minimum .",
    "however , a completely different picture is appropriate to the dynamics in simulations ( using mc or discontinuous molecular dynamics @xcite ) on the transformed pes .",
    "the transformation removes vibrational motion ( the hessian has no positive eigenvalues ) and transitions out of a basin are possible anywhere along the boundary of the basin .",
    "therefore , steps in any direction can lead directly to a new minimum . furthermore , downhill transitions are now barrierless .",
    "however , as figure [ fig : trans ] illustrates , significant barriers between low - energy minima can remain if they are separated by high - energy intervening minima .",
    "consequently , on @xmath64 the system can hop directly between basins ; hence the name of this transformation .",
    "furthermore , much larger mc steps can be taken on @xmath64 ; such steps would virtually always be rejected on the original pes because atoms would become too close and an extremely high energy would result .",

    "one of the advantages of this method is its simplicity  there are few parameters to adjust .",
    "it is usually satisfactory to dynamically adjust the step size to produce a 50% acceptance ratio .",
    "an appropriate temperature also needs to be chosen , but fortunately the temperature window for which the method is effective is usually large , and can be quickly found after some experimentation .",
    "furthermore , there is a well - defined thermodynamics associated with the method @xcite that makes understanding the physics behind the approach easier , as we shall see in section [ sect : go_sol ] .",
    "typically , a series of basin - hopping runs of a specified length will be performed starting from a random geometry .",
    "this is advantageous over a single longer run because it can provide a loose gauge of success .",
    "if all the runs return the same lowest - energy structure",
    "one would imagine that the true global minimum had been found .",
    "it can also often prove useful to perform runs starting from the best structures at sizes one above and below , with the lowest - energy atom removed or an atom added , respectively .    the local minimization method that we have found to be most efficient for clusters is a limited memory bfgs algorithm @xcite . the basin - hopping approach is also found to be more efficient when the configuration is reset to the configuration of the local minimum after each accepted step @xcite ; this avoids problems with evaporation of atoms from the cluster since the basin - hopping transformation also reduces the barriers to dissociation .",
    "in addition to the usual steps , it is advantageous to have occasional angular steps for low - energy surface atoms .",
    "these have a similar aim to the directed mutations introduced by hartke into his genetic algorithm @xcite ; they both enable the best arrangement of the surface atoms to be found more rapidly . for biopolymers other system - specific step types",
    "have been introduced to increase efficiency @xcite .",
    "one of the main differences between the basin - hopping and genetic algorithms is that only local moves are used in basin - hopping , whereas genetic algorithms employ co - operative crossover moves in which a new structure is formed from fragments of two ` parent ' clusters .",

    "it is the first size at which the overlayer that leads to the next mackay icosahedron is lowest in energy .",

    "steps are accepted ( i.e. @xmath6=0 ) and the run is stopped after there is no further improvement for a certain number of steps . for those sizes with non - icosahedral global minima",

    "the majority of runs end at low - energy icosahedral structures .",
    "those examples at larger sizes are again more than an order of magnitude more difficult than lj@xmath61 , but interestingly the marks decahedra at @xmath32=102104 are somewhat more easy to locate than those at @xmath32=7577 .",
    "these results enable us to comment on the use of lj clusters as a test system for go methods .",

    "he found that it is more efficient to restart a run when it gets stuck in a funnel ( and hope that it enters the funnel of the global minimum next time ) than to wait for the cluster to escape from that funnel @xcite .",
    "we can understand why the pes transformation so dramatically changes the thermodynamics of the system , by examining @xmath96 , the occupation probability of a minimum @xmath15 .",
    "for the untransformed pes within the harmonic approximation @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the potential energy of minimum @xmath15 and @xmath99 is the geometric mean vibrational frequency .",
    "for the transformed pes @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the hyperarea of the basin of attraction of minimum @xmath15 . the differences between these expressions , the vibrational frequency and hyperarea terms , have opposite effects on the thermodynamics .",
    "the higher - energy minima are generally less rigid and so the vibrational term entropically stabilizes the icosahedra and , even more so , the liquid - like state , pushing the transitions down to lower temperature and sharpening them . by contrast",
    "the hyperarea of the minima decreases with increasing potential energy , thus stabilizing the lower - energy states and broadening the thermodynamics .",
    "@xmath67 as a function of the number of steps in basin - hopping runs for lj@xmath61 at ( a ) @xmath6=0.4@xmath102 and ( b ) @xmath6=0.9@xmath102 . ,",

    "in this chapter i hope to have shown how physical insight can play an important role in understanding the behaviour of global optimization algorithms and hope that these insights can help provide a firmer physical ( rather than just empirical or intuitive ) foundation for the design of new improved algorithms .",
    "i also hope that it will encourage some to think about the physical aspects of other types of go problems .",
    "in particular i have highlighted some examples where a multiple - funnel energy landscape strongly hinders global optimization .",
    "such challenging cases are likely to be a common feature for any cluster system where there is not a single strongly dominant structural type . more generally , multiple funnels probably represent the most difficult problem for this class of go problems , in which the lowest - energy configuration of a system is sought . for example , for this reason , the main criterion in the design of polypeptides that fold well is the avoidance of multiple funnels by optimizing the energy gap between the native state and competing low - energy structures @xcite .",
    "i have also shown why the basin - hopping transformation of the energy landscape makes global optimization for these multiple - funnel cases easier .",
    "the method s success results from a broadening of the thermodynamics , so that the occupation probability of the global minimum is significant at temperatures where the interfunnel free energy barriers can be surmounted .",
    "this idea should act as a design principle in the development of any new go algorithms that hope to overcome the challenge of multiple funnels .",
    "although basin - hopping is successful for the lj multiple - funnel examples , further improvements in efficiency are required before one can hope to succeed for similar cases at larger size or for potential energy functions that are significantly more computationally intensive to evaluate .",
    "a number of avenues by which this may be achieved suggest themselves .",
    "firstly , the basin - hopping algorithm searches the transformed potential energy surface using simple mc .",
    "however , there are a whole raft of methods that have been developed in order to speed up the rate of rare events in simulations on the untransformed pes , which could potentially be applied to the transformed pes .",
    "these include parallel tempering @xcite , jump - walking @xcite , and the use of non - boltzmann ensembles , such as tsallis statistics @xcite .",
    "secondly , the basin - hopping transformation can be combined with other pes transformations , of which there have been many suggestions @xcite , to get a double transformation ( and hopefully a greater simplification ) of the pes @xcite .",
    "the potential problem with this type of approach is that as well as smoothing the pes , most transformations also change the relative stabilities of different structures .",
    "this can work in one s favour if the transformation stabilizes the global minimum .",
    "for example , a recent transformation proposed by locatelli and schoen , which favours compact spherical clusters , stabilizes the non - icosahedral lj global minima @xcite ; for the 38-atom cluster the pes , when sufficiently deformed , has a single - funnel topography with the truncated octahedron at its bottom @xcite .",
    "but just as often a transformation will destabilize the global minimum  this is why the performance of many pes - transformation go methods is erratic , perhaps solving some ` hard ' instances while failing for ` easier ' examples .",
    "however , the proposed approach could be run alongside standard basin - hopping runs , and so would perhaps succeed in instances where the standard algorithm struggles .",
    "thirdly , hartke recently proposed a modification to the genetic algorithm approach , in which a diversity of structures is maintained in the population @xcite .",
    "this leads to significant increases in efficiency for the lj clusters with multiple - funnels , because it prevents the whole population being confined ( and trapped ) within the icosahedral funnel .",
    "such an approach could also potentially increase the efficiency of other algorithms .",
    "for example , a diversity of structures could be maintained between a set of parallel basin - hopping runs .",
