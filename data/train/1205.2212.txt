    "the electric dipole moment ( edm ) for neutrons is sensitive to cp violation in physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) around tev scale .",
    "this is because , while the cp phase in the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix is @xmath0 , the ckm contribution to the neutron edm is too much suppressed @xcite to be observed in near future .",
    "( the recent evaluation of the ckm contribution to the neutron edm is given in refs .",
    "the naturalness problem in the higgs - boson mass term in the sm might require new physics at tev scale , and many extensions of the sm generically have cp - violating interactions . the supersymmetric standard model , which is the leading candidate for the tev - scale physics , is severely constrained from the edm measurements @xcite .",
    "the ( flavor - conserving ) cp - violating effective operators at parton level up to the dimension six are the qcd theta term , the edms and the chromoelectric dipole moments ( cedms ) of quarks , the weinberg s three - gluon operator  @xcite and the four - quark operators . in the evaluation of the neutron edm ,",
    "the cp - violating four - quark operators tend to be ignored since the four - light - quark operators suffer from chiral suppression in many models .",
    "however , the four - quark operators including heavier ones , such as bottom / top quarks , may give sizable contributions to the neutron edm .",
    "the edms , cedms , and the three - gluon operator are radiatively generated from the four - quark operators by integrating out heavy quarks .    in the multi - higgs models ,",
    "the barr - zee diagrams are known to give the sizable contribution to the neutron edm @xcite . in the barr - zee diagrams the heavy - quark loops are connected to light - quark external lines by the neutral scalar boson exchange so that the cedms for light quarks are generated at two - loop level at @xmath1 .",
    "however , it is not clear which renormalization scale should be chosen for @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , the contributions from the barr - zee diagrams at two - loop level to the quark edms vanish at @xmath1 .",
    "however , it is still unclear that the higher - order corrections to the quark edms are negligible in the neutron edm evaluation .    in this letter , in order to answer those questions , we derive the renormalization - group equations ( rges ) for the wilson coefficients for the cp - violating effective operators up to the dimension six at one - loop level , including operator mixing .",
    "the rges for the edms and cedms for quarks and the three - gluon operator have been derived in ref .",
    "the next - leading order corrections to them are also partially included @xcite .",
    "we include the four - quark operators in the calculation at the leading order .",
    "using the derived rges , we evaluate the edms and cedms for light quarks and the three - gluon operators induced by the neutral scalar boson exchange including the qcd correction .",
    "we also discuss the four - quark operators induced by the color - octet scalar boson .",

    "another example of the application of the rges is shown , assuming the effective operators induced by a color - octet scalar boson .",
    "section 6 is devoted to conclusion .",
    "first , we review about evaluations of the neutron edm from the low - energy effective lagrangian at parton level . the cp - violating interaction at parton level around the hadron scale ( @xmath3  gev ) is given by @xmath4 here , @xmath5 and @xmath6@xmath7 are the electromagnetic and gluon field strength tensors , @xmath8 is the strong coupling constant ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 with @xmath13 $ ] and @xmath14 .",

    "( [ lagrangian ] ) , we ignore the cp - violating four - quark operators , since their coefficients are often proportional to the light - quark masses in typical models , as mentioned in the introduction .",
    "the neutron edm is evaluated from the low - energy interaction at parton level with the naive dimensional analysis , the chiral perturbation theory , and the qcd sum rules , though they are considered to have large uncertainties .",
    "the evaluation in term of the qcd sum rules is more systematic than the others , at least for the contributions from the qcd theta term , and the quark edms and cedms to the neutron edm @xcite .",
    "the recent evaluation of the neutron edm with the qcd sum rules @xcite is @xmath26 + 0.32d_d -0.08d_u + e(+0.12\\tilde{d}_d-0.12\\tilde{d}_u-0.006\\tilde{d}_s)~. \\label{sumrule } % -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the evaluation , the recent qcd lattice result is used for the low - energy constant @xmath27 , which is defined by @xmath28 with @xmath29 the neutron - interpolating field . if a value of @xmath27 evaluated with the qcd sum rules is used , the neutron edm is enhanced by about five times compared with eq .",

    "the contribution from the three - gluon operator might be comparable to the quark edms and cedms .",
    "the quark edms and cedms are proportional to the quark masses , while the three - gluon operator does not need to suffer from chirality suppression . however , the size of the contribution from the three - gluon operator depends on the methods of the evaluation . in ref .",

    "in multi - higgs models , a color - singlet neutral scalar boson @xmath54 may have the cp - violating yukawa coupling with quarks .",
    "if the yukawa interaction violates the cp invariance , the cp - violating four - quark operators are induced at tree level , after integrating the neutral scalar boson out , as @xmath55 where we assume that @xmath54 is heavier than heavy quarks ( @xmath56 ) . here ,",
    "@xmath57 and @xmath58 are the cp - even and odd yukawa coupling constants , respectively , defined as @xmath59 where @xmath54 is a ( cp - even ) real scalar field , and @xmath60 is the fermi constant .",
    "we parametrize the yukawa coupling constants as they are proportional to the quark masses . in typical new physics models ,",

    "e.g. _ , two - higgs - doublet models , the coefficients @xmath63 may be much larger than unity because of the enhancement factor originated from the ratio of vacuum expectation values .",
    "it is known that , in these models , the edms and cedms for light quarks are generated by the barr - zee diagrams at two - loop level , and the three - gluon operator is also induced by the heavy - quark loops at two - loop level .",
    "let us derive those contributions using the rges for the wilson coefficients .    in the leading - logarithmic approximation ,",
    "since @xmath64 is non - zero , the coefficients for the edm and the cedm operators are generated from the one - loop rges as @xmath65 these contributions are compared with the explicit calculation of one - loop diagrams with the scalar boson exchange as @xmath66 where a limit of @xmath67 is taken .",
    "the second term in the parentheses should be considered as the short - distance contribution in which the loop momentum is around @xmath68 .    the one - loop contributions from @xmath64 to the edms and cedms for light quarks @xmath69 are negligible in the neutron edm since they are suppressed by powers of the light - quark masses .",

    "( [ barr - zee ] ) is consistent with the explicit calculation of the barr - zee diagrams  @xcite in a limit of @xmath77 .",
    "it is known that the contribution to the neutron edm from the barr - zee diagram at two - loop can be competitive with those from the one - loop diagrams  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the four - quark operator for heavy quarks can be important in some cases .",
    "on the other hand , the edms for light quarks are not generated by two - loop level diagrams of @xmath1 , even if @xmath72 and @xmath73 are non - zero .",

    "this is also consistent with the explicit calculation of the barr - zee diagrams .",
    "the edms generated at two - loop level are suppressed by @xmath36 .",
    "however , the running effect of the strong coupling constant may prevent the cancellation so that the edm would be enhanced .",

    "it is found that the running coupling @xmath80 changes the cedm by about 20% while the three - gluon operator is changed by at most 10 % .",

    "in this letter , we have derived the renormalization - group equations for the cp - violating interaction including the quark edms and cedms and the weinberg s three - gluon operator as well as all the flavor - conserving four fermion operators .",
    "the operator mixings between the ( c)edm operators and the four - quark operators are arisen at the order of @xmath110 , which can give large contributions to the edms via the renormalization - group evolution .",
    "assuming the cp - violating yukawa interactions for the neutral scalar bosons , it is known that the cedms for light quarks are generated from the diagrams with heavy - quark loops , called as the barr - zee diagrams .",
    "we show that when the neutral scalar boson is much heavier than heavy quarks , the barr - zee diagrams are systematically evaluated with the rges of the cp - violating interaction .",
    "we also show that the running effect of the strong coupling constant gives corrections to the contribution with more than 20 % compared with assuming the constant coupling .",
    "the uncertainties in the calculation of the neutron edm have been estimated in the literature  @xcite .",
    "it gives about 50 % error for the qcd sum rule , while 40 % error for the low - energy constant evaluated from the lattice qcd calculation .",
    "therefore , hadronic uncertainties would overcome the qcd corrections from the renormalization - group evolution at this moment .",
    "we hope that the lattice qcd simulation will improve and reduce uncertainties significantly  @xcite .",
