    "think of configurations of @xmath2 points on an @xmath18-manifold ( in our case , this space is @xmath11 ) , where points are allowed to move but not to touch .",
    "compactifying allows the points to collide and a _ system _ is introduced to record the _ directions _ points arrive at the collision . in the celebrated work of fulton and macpherson  @xcite , this method is brought to rigor in the algebro - geometric context . as points collide , they land on a _ screen _ , viewed as @xmath19 , which is identified with the point of collision . now these points on the screen are themselves allowed to move and collide , landing on higher level screens .",
    "however , they are free up to an action of @xmath20 , the affine automorphism on each screen .",
    "kontsevich describes the process in terms of a magnifying glass : on a particular level , only a configuration of points is noticeable ; but one can zoom - in on a particular point and peer into its screen , seeing the space of the collided points .",
    "the compactification of @xmath21 comes from deligne - knudsen - mumford , closely related to the fulton - macpherson method .",

    "it naturally follows that @xmath22 appears in @xmath3 , where the _ tessellation _ by copies of associahedra comes from dealing not just with points on bubbles , but _ labeled _ points . in other words , by keeping track of possible labelings , we find @xmath3 to be tiled by exactly @xmath23 copies of @xmath22 : although there are @xmath24 possible ways of labeling the sides of an @xmath2-gon , since the dihedral group @xmath25 ( of order @xmath26 ) is in @xmath27 , each associahedral domain of @xmath3 corresponds , in some sense , to a labeled @xmath2-gon up to rotation and reflection .",

    "the minimal lines become triangular tori , that is , @xmath145 .",
    "the faces of the cube can be seen to form the @xmath146-torus with blow - ups , resulting in @xmath70 tiled by two @xmath42 hexagons .",
    "[ [ section-10 ] ]    we have shown the cyclohedron to be the @xmath108 affine analogue of the associahedron . however , simion thought of it as a type @xmath147 associahedron . , we would still arrive at the associahedron , not the cyclohedron . ]",
    "the reasoning behind this is explained by looking at the combinatorial question that motivated her .",
    "we thank v.  reiner for helpful insights into his work @xcite .",
    "a _ @xmath8-partition _ separates @xmath133 into disjoint sets @xmath148 .",
    "a partition is _ non - crossing _ if for elements @xmath149 and @xmath150 such that @xmath151 , then @xmath152 .",
    "let @xmath153 be the number of non - crossing @xmath8-partitions of @xmath133 .",
    "the @xmath154-vector @xmath155 of a polytope @xmath156 is a combinatorial invariant , where @xmath157 equals the number of @xmath8-dimensional faces .",
    "another method of encapsulating this information is by the @xmath158-vector @xmath159 ( see @xcite for details ) . denoting @xmath160 as the combinatorial dual of the associahedron , the following remarkable equivalence exists : @xmath161    the poset of partitions of @xmath133 is isomorphic to the lattice of intersection subspaces for the type @xmath100 braid arrangement . for example , a partition @xmath162 corresponds to the intersection subspace of @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "similarly , by replacing the set with @xmath165 , we can consider the hyperoctahedral hyperplane arrangement for type @xmath147 .",
    "the barring is an involution denoting the sign change coming from the hyperplanes @xmath166 .",
    "combinatorially , simion was able to construct a space tiled by eight copies of @xmath42 hexagons , using the twist operation defined in @xcite .",
    "we now see that she had arrived at the four - fold cover of @xmath70 ( in figure  [ hextiles ] , choose a region four times that of the shaded one ) . by labeling the antipodal sides of the polygons with @xmath174 and @xmath175 , a @xmath176-fold cover of the moduli space @xmath4 is created .",
    "the cyclohedron made its debut in knot theory implicitly through the work on kontsevich @xcite and explicitly by bott - taubes .",
    "the imbedding @xmath177 defining a knot induces a map onto their compactified @xmath2 point configuration spaces , thereby introducing @xmath40 .",
    "roughly , one then ` carefully ' integrates certain pullbacks of volume forms on @xmath178 using the inclusion @xmath179 ; for a good topological understanding , see the work of d.  thurston  @xcite .",
    "the cyclohedron also appears in the work of bar - natan in a different setting @xcite .",
    "he gives a combinatorial approach of sketching some relations that arise in computing certain kontsevich - kz invariants coming from braids and chord diagrams ( note that chord diagrams come from @xmath26 marked points on @xmath60 with pairwise identification ) .",
    "he introduces a multitude of relations and their corresponding polytopal structures , including kapranov s permutoassociahedron @xmath180 and @xmath40 .",
    "davis , januszkiewicz , and scott show the minimal blow - ups of certain hyperplane arrangements to be @xmath5 spaces @xcite .",
    "in other words , the homotopy properties of these spaces are completely encapsulated in their fundamental groups . the crucial result motivating their work comes from gromov @xcite , where he relates nonpositive curvature of manifolds to flag complexes . for our purposes , we get the following striking fact :",
    "there is a close similarity between the fundamental group of @xmath3 and the braid group , described from a combinatorial viewpoint in @xcite .",
    "recall that the _ artin group _ of @xmath100 is the classic braid group on @xmath181 strings between points on an interval ( figure  [ braids]a ) or on a circle ( figure  [ braids]b ) ; simply cut the circles open and lay the strings flat to obtain an isomorphism .",
    "the affine analog of classical braids is the artin group of @xmath108 ; this can be presented as braids on @xmath181 strands restricted to a cylindrical shell .",
    "the latter diagrams in figure  [ braids ] show two distinct elements of the @xmath182 braid group .",
    "there is a parallel between these cylinder braids and the fundamental group of @xmath4 , with notably deeper relations to knot invariants and the cyclohedron .",
    "it seems quite natural to generalize what we have done .",
    "the motivation for the real moduli space of points @xmath3 comes from its _ complex _ counterpart @xmath0 .",
    "the importance of @xmath0 can be seen , for example , as being a fundamental building block in the theory of gromov - witten invariants , among numerous other appearances in literature . a reasonable candidate for the complex analogue for @xmath4 could be : @xmath183 again",
    ", we would like to know the role this space would play in mathematical physics and algebraic geometry .",
    "similarly , we can generalize by mimicking the construction to other coxeter groups .",
    "much has been done in terms of the minimal blow - ups in @xcite .",
    "however , there have been a wealth of new compactifications that have been studied recently and we discuss the interplay between these ideas in a forth coming work @xcite ."
