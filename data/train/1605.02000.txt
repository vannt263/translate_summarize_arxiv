    "soft biological tissues , such as cartilage , epithelium and muscles , can sustain relatively high levels of strain , while maintaining their integrity , despite the low intrinsic toughness of the polymeric base materials @xcite . since failure to withstand such loads by fracture may lead to loss of functionality and to the development of clinically adverse conditions",
    ", there is a strong biomedical interest in studying the fracture toughness of such tissues .",
    "hydrogels are commonly considered as proxies for soft biological tissues and are thus the subject of intense theoretical and experimental investigations .",
    "moreover , hydrogel - based technological applications in soft electronics @xcite , shape morphing @xcite , microfluidics @xcite , and in tissue engineering @xcite further motivate the interest in fundamental studies on the flaw - tolerance of hydrogels and in seeking toughening mechanisms to improve their mechanical performance .    in synthetic chemical gels",
    ", fracture occurs by scission of covalent cross - linking bonds and , as is typical of brittle materials , it usually proceeds dynamically @xcite .",
    "however , the unstable character of brittle fracture may be radically altered when a brittle , impermeable hydrogel is hydraulically coupled with a tougher , poroelastic solid @xcite .",
    "in such a situation , the hydraulic coupling allows for quasi - static crack propagation in the brittle solid and increases the macroscopic toughness of the composite by promoting multiple cracking @xcite .",
    "more generally , toughening of hydrogels typically relies on energy dissipation in process zones around crack tips @xcite .",
    "much research currently focuses on the development of experimental protocols for the synthesis of high - toughness hydrogels , where dissipation mechanisms , such as fracture of a secondary polymer network @xcite , or unzipping of reversible cross - links @xcite , are introduced at the material scale .",
    "likewise , a theoretical effort is needed in modeling diverse fracture modes and sources of toughening in soft materials , starting with the basic , classical fracture mechanics problems .    in this spirit , here we study the propagation of a semi - infinite , parent crack in an infinite polymer gel that is loaded in mode i conditions and immersed in a solvent .",
    "previous theoretical works on related problems have considered stationary @xcite or steadily - growing @xcite cracks , without discussing either fracture propagation criteria , or the effect of poroelastic processes in the near - tip region on the toughness of the system . moreover ,",
    "previous experimental data @xcite on fracture of gels have been interpreted by invoking several dissipation sources , such as viscoelasticity , which have been quantified through phenomenological models .    in this study , we present a detailed energy analysis that reveals the existence of a velocity - independent toughening , which is innate in the poroelastic nature of polymer gels .",
    "we provide an analytical estimate of such toughening , based on asymptotic solutions of the governing equations for the crack propagation problem . as a further major result",
    ", we establish a poroelastic cohesive zone model that provides a framework to describe the micromechanics of fracture processes in polymer gels .",
    "finally , we perform a numerical study of steady - state crack propagation , for which we explore the influence of the cohesive zone material parameters on the macroscopic toughness of the system .",
    "in this section , we introduce the governing equations for mode i crack propagation in a polymer gel , and study the asymptotic behavior of the solution near and far away from the crack tip . specifically , we consider a gel consisting of an infinite polymer network immersed in a liquid solvent at chemical potential @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the solvent molar volume and its pressure , respectively .",
    "the gel is initially swollen with an amount of solvent that is related to the homogeneous , isotropic swelling stretch @xmath3 from the dry state .",
    "mechanical and chemical equilibrium conditions for the gel in its initial state imply that @xmath3 is uniform and determined by the following equation @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the universal gas constant , @xmath6 is the absolute temperature , @xmath7 is the dry shear modulus of the polymer network and @xmath8 is the dimensionless solvent - polymer mixing parameter .",
    "we take a plane domain @xmath9 encompassing the swollen gel to be the reference configuration for all deformation of the gel network . a point in @xmath10",
    "is identified by the cartesian coordinates @xmath11 .",
    "latin indices denote components of vectors and tensors with respect to the basis @xmath12 .",
    "the problem to be tackled is that of a semi - infinite crack that propagates in the gel subject to applied loads capable of sustaining such crack growth .",
    "the applied loads are such that the crack tends to open with tension on the plane ahead of the crack tip and zero shear stress .",
    "the crack is thus in mode i in the terminology of fracture mechanics .",
    "deformations from the reference state are confined to plane - strain in conjunction with the growth of the crack .",
    "as presented in a previous report @xcite , the plane - strain / plane - diffusion balance equations for the linearized poroelastic model of a polymer gel read @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the in - plane components of the increments of stress and solvent flux , respectively , from the reference configuration , and @xmath16 is the trace of the small - strain tensor @xmath17 .",
    "recall that deformations are measured from the reference state , and thus @xmath18 is the incremental volume strain relative to that state .",
    "it is thus proportional to the solvent concentration @xmath19 , _",
    "@xmath20 , where @xmath19 defines the change of concentration relative to its value in the reference configuration , and is thus measured in moles per unit reference volume .",
    "we note that eq .",
    "@xmath21 provides the balance of forces in the quasi - static limit and in the absence of body forces . as is usual in crack propagation problems , it is convenient to recast the governing equations in a moving frame @xmath22 centered at the crack tip , with ( @xmath23,@xmath24 ) the associated polar coordinates .",
    "spatial derivatives in the fixed and the moving frames are trivially equal and thus we use the same notation for such differential operators in both frames . in contrast , the following relation holds between the time rates of @xmath18 in the moving and fixed frames @xmath25 where a prime denotes the time derivative holding @xmath22 fixed and @xmath26 is the crack tip velocity along @xmath27 .",

    "then , for the stress - strain relationships we prescribe the following plane strain poroelasticity equations , valid for a homogeneous , isotropic polymer gel , @xmath32 with the following definitions of the poroelastic moduli @xcite @xmath33 we observe that @xmath34 is the pressure in the solvent and thus the terms in eq .   other than that is the stress sustained by the polymer network .",
    "we also notice that , apart from the definitions eq .  , the governing equations of the linearized model for swelling polymer gels are the same as those of the biot theory of poroelasticity @xcite in the presence of incompressible solid and fluid constituents .    to complete the set of governing equations , we specify the boundary conditions by assuming that the crack faces are traction - free ( @xmath35 , with @xmath36 the outwards unit normal to the faces ) and in chemical equilibrium with the initial / reference state of the solvent ( @xmath37 ) . at infinity ,",

    "we call this condition the _ small - scale process zone _ hypothesis",

    "@xmath54 in the form of an advection - diffusion equation @xmath55 with @xmath56 the cooperative diffusion coefficient @xcite .",
    "this equation involves two length scales : @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "both lengths characterize , in different regimes and under the small scale process zone hypothesis , the extent of the process zone , where significant volume changes occur . specifically , the length scale @xmath57 is relevant at short times for a stationary crack , whereas @xmath59 becomes relevant during crack propagation .",
    "the formulation of the governing equations as in and enables insights from asymptotic analysis . at the crack",

    "the instantaneous relaxation of pore pressure at the crack tip motivates our assumption @xcite , which is confirmed by numerical results .",

    "@xmath54 , once @xmath18 is known from the stresses through eq .  .",
    "first , the asymptotic solution of the compatibility equation @xmath21 for @xmath60 is the mode i stress field eq .  , with @xmath63 , the stress intensity factor at the crack tip , to be determined by the crack propagation criterion .",

    "by computing the gradient of the solvent chemical potential from eq .  , it may be verified that these terms will induce a circulating flow in which solvent is pumped from the crack surfaces , injected round towards the region ahead of the crack tip and dumped into the crack tip @xcite .",
    "this circulating flow is convected through the gel by the growth of the crack .",
    "we confirm this asymptotic analysis by carrying out numerical simulations for the steady - state case of constant crack tip velocity @xmath26 , as described later in section  [ sec : results ] . as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : adimpress ] , the solvent pressure decreases as @xmath77 according to eq .",
    "ahead of the crack tip , reaches a minimum at @xmath78 , and then increases again , following the scaling law eq .  .",
    "the minimum of @xmath79 approximately marks the boundary between the drained and the undrained regions , both for a propagating and for a stationary @xcite crack .",
    "in the following , we derive and elaborate on the energy release rate for a polymer gel , a fundamental quantity for establishing crack propagation criteria .",
    "although the technical aspects of the derivation are rather standard in fracture mechanics , some special aspects must be considered that stem from the poroelastic nature of gels . in particular",
    ", energy dissipation due to solvent transport gives rise to an area integral in the expression of the energy release rate , in addition to the classical contour integral , which critically contributes to the fracture toughness of the gel .",
    "in general , we find it useful to dwell on some key intermediate steps of the derivation to comment on their physical significance .",
    "let us consider a material domain @xmath80 including the crack tip and enclosed by the contour @xmath81 that joins the crack faces and includes the two segments @xmath82 and @xmath83 along the crack faces , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] . in an isothermal",
    "setting , we consider power balances per unit thickness of the body",
    ".     includes the crack tip and is enclosed by the contour @xmath81 joining the crack faces and including the two segments @xmath82 and @xmath83 along them . ]",
    "the external power consists of @xmath84 , the rate at which the applied tractions do work on @xmath85 , and of @xmath86 , the rate at which solvent transport convects energy across @xmath87 : @xmath88 where @xmath36 is the outward unit normal to @xmath89 and @xmath90 is the velocity of the gel .",
    "these representations are appropriate when the polymer gel is viewed as a homogenized continuum , where no distinction is made between polymer and solvent .",
    "however , we recognize that there is a clear connection with mixture theory , as the solvent flux @xmath15 is proportional to the relative velocity of the solvent with respect to the polymer and the total stress @xmath14 is the sum of the network stress @xmath91 and a hydrostatic contribution @xmath92 equal to the solvent pressure . as can be deduced from eqs .   and",
    ", the network stress comprises an elastic component , which expresses the elasticity of the cross - linked polymers , and an osmotic component , which arises from the mixing of solvent and polymers and is present even without cross - links @xcite . in particular , the network traction @xmath93 is work - conjugate to the network velocity @xmath90 , while the solvent pressure @xmath34 does work on the solvent velocity @xmath94 .",
    "thus , we may alternatively represent the total external power as @xmath95 this result makes it clear that eq .",
    "@xmath54 is the rate at which the tractions do work on the fluid velocity in excess of the network velocity .",
    "the external power contributes to the change of the free energy @xmath96 stored in @xmath97 and to the dissipation @xmath98 due to solvent transport : @xmath99 the remainder , denoted by @xmath100 , is directed into the crack tip and is the driver for crack propagation . here , the free energy density @xmath101 is defined as @xmath102 so that @xmath103 with the aforementioned definitions of the power contributions , we write the balance of energy for @xmath97 as @xmath104 consistent with the hypothesis of quasi - static crack propagation , we have neglected the kinetic energy in the energy balance .    manipulations of the general balance statement eq .",
    "lead to the definition of the energy release rate .",
    "first , we recall the following transport theorem @xcite @xmath105 where @xmath106 . with this",
    ", we can compute the power @xmath100 dissipated at the crack tip from eq .   as @xmath107 where we have taken into account the fact that the boundary conditions on the crack faces imply no exchange of either mechanical or chemical power .",
    "clearly , eq .   shows that only part of the energy flux across @xmath81 is directed towards the tip , since part is dissipated in solvent transport , and part is spent in transient processes that vary the free energy stored in @xmath97 .    on applying the divergence theorem @xcite to the chemical power contribution in eq .",
    "we obtain @xmath108 where the first term at the right hand side is the limit of the integral over a circular contour that is shrunk to the crack tip .",
    "this term vanishes because the asymptotic solution eq .",
    "makes it the integral of a bounded quantity on a vanishingly small contour : @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "furthermore , upon noting that @xmath111 , we see that the last term on the right hand side of eq .   becomes @xmath112 where we have used the divergence theorem and the balance of forces .",
    "note that the tip integral vanishes for the mode i stress field at the crack tip .",
    "then , from eqs .",
    "- and the transformation rule eq .   applied to @xmath90 and @xmath113 , eq .   simplifies to @xmath114 where we have defined the _ energy release rate _ @xmath115 .",
    "this expression is consistent with that obtained in @xcite following a different derivation and in the finite deformation context .",
    "notice that @xmath100 is path - independent since the choice of the path @xmath81 enclosing @xmath97 is arbitrary .",
    "in particular , we may choose a contour that is shrunk to the crack tip , such that the area integral vanishes due to an argument similar to that used in the discussion of the tip integral in eq .  .",
    "thus , we may rewrite eq .   as @xmath116 this representation for the energy release rate shows that an infinitesimal contour surrounding the crack tip is needed to exclude the contribution of the solvent pressure in the computation of @xmath115 .",
    "thus , only the work performed by the network stress and the energy stored by the network are involved in the energy balance at the crack tip . upon using the asymptotic stress field of eq .   for @xmath117 with @xmath63 and the corresponding strain field ,",
    "we compute the energy release rate explicitly from eq .",
    "as @xmath118 with @xmath119 the drained plane strain modulus of the gel , defined as a function of the drained elastic moduli @xmath120    as a simple fracture criterion , we may assume that the energy @xmath115 absorbed into the crack tip is spent in the breaking of polymer chains lying across the crack plane .",
    "this behavior can be characterized by a material - dependent fracture energy @xmath121 per unit area , and thus the fracture criterion is @xmath122 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath123 . here",
    ", @xmath124 is the critical stress intensity factor needed to commence the propagation of a stationary crack in the absence of solvent pressure .",
    "since the area density of the polymer chains is a function of the degree of swelling of the gel , the fracture energy depends on the swelling stretch @xmath3 @xcite .    as we have seen in the previous section , during crack propagation solvent flow",
    "is confined to a small region near the crack tip . outside this region , the incompressible mode i stress field holds , with the solvent pressure given by eq .  .",
    "as a consequence , the first term in eq .  , when evaluated on a contour @xmath125 outside the process zone , gives the usual relation @xmath126 , where @xmath127 is the applied energy release rate and @xmath128 is the undrained plane strain modulus .",
    "then , from the comparison of eq .   and eq .  , we deduce that the energy release rate computed in the far field may be expressed as @xmath129 this is a central result of our work that applies to both a stationary and a propagating crack , as long as the small - scale process zone hypothesis holds true .",
    "the area integral in eq .  , extending over the domain @xmath130 encircled by @xmath125 , effectively involves only the process zone of characteristic size @xmath131 , with @xmath132 a positive constant .",
    "we confirm this observation by plotting the dimensionless power density @xmath133 .",
    "this is reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : processzone ] as computed from numerical simulations , see section  [ sec : results ] for additional details . thus , using the asymptotic fields eqs .  - , we may estimate the area integral in eq .",

    "shows that the stress intensity factor @xmath68 needed to sustain crack growth , that is , the effective fracture toughness of the system , is independent of crack tip velocity and is solely a function of the poisson s ratio @xmath136 . we have confirmed this result by means of numerical simulations that also allowed the estimation of the constant @xmath132 .",
    "physically , this toughening effect may be explained as follows .",
    "the stress concentration ahead of the crack tip causes the material to expand . since expansion requires an increase in solvent volume fraction , a reduction of solvent pressure develops in the process zone to draw solvent towards the crack tip .",
    "this solvent flow implies viscous dissipation .",
    "in fact , energy must be supplied to the system to compensate for the work performed on solvent pressure , which resists volume expansion within the process zone , as quantified by the area integral in eq .  .    .",
    "color code represents the dimensionless power density @xmath133 , as computed from numerical simulations ( see section  [ sec : results ] ) , for @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "the magenta contour @xmath139 , with @xmath140 , is an estimate for the boundary of the process zone , where @xmath132 has been tuned to match the value of @xmath39 computed from eq .   with the corresponding value obtained numerically .",
    "outside the black contour , which is the level set @xmath141 , volume changes are less than 10% , and the material response approaches the undrained one . ]",
    "notice that the degree of toughening @xmath142 is a function of the initial swelling stretch @xmath143 through the poroelastic moduli , see eq .  .",
    "as may be expected , the toughening contribution in eq .",
    "vanishes for an incompressible material , _",
    "i.e. _  a dry polymer gel .",
    "this fact is consistent with the physical interpretation of the toughening as a dilatational effect , since volume changes in the process zone will be hampered by incompressibility .    in passing ,",
    "we observe that a related result was previously obtained by @xcite for the case of a mode i stationary crack in a polymer gel .",
    "consistent with our findings , the enhancement in fracture toughness as predicted by these authors vanishes at @xmath144 .      to accurately compute the energy release rate @xmath115 in numerical simulations",
    ", we adopt the domain integral method @xcite .",
    "we consider a closed path comprising the contours @xmath145 and @xmath81 encircling the crack tip , and the two segments along the crack faces joining them , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "moreover , we define @xmath146 to be a smooth function of position such that @xmath147 on @xmath81 and @xmath148 on @xmath145 .",
    "with these definitions , we rewrite eq .   as @xmath149 where @xmath150 is the eshelby tensor @xcite and",
    "the divergence theorem has been applied in the last equality . using the constitutive equations and the balance of forces",
    "@xmath21 we have @xmath151 , so that @xmath152",
    "in this section , we establish a poroelastic cohesive zone model that takes both deformation of the polymer network and solvent transport into account .",
    "this micromechanical approach allows us to distinguish among several failure mechanisms that otherwise can not be accounted for by a fracture criterion based solely on the crack tip toughness .    in the cohesive zone adjacent to the crack tip the polymer network fails by progressive rupture of its chains",
    "this process is accompanied by two phenomena , one of which is dissipation due to friction and sliding to untangle the ruptured polymer chains ; this phenomenon means that the work to rupture the network of cross - linked polymer is much higher than the energy required to simply break its bonds .",
    "the second phenomenon is the flow of solvent to fill the space created by the rupturing of the cohesive zone , whose opening is zero where rupture begins and rises to a maximum where the polymer network finally fails .",
    "the flow of solvent involves viscous drag and therefore introduces further dissipation that will depend on the rate at which the crack propagates .",
    "is the cohesive traction , @xmath153 is the tangential flux of solvent within the cohesive zone , whereas @xmath154 and @xmath155 are the fluxes exchanged with the surrounding gel . ]    in a precise and complete treatment of the problem , it would be possible to extend the general features of flow in the gel as treated in section  [ sec : governing ] to encompass the phenomenon of flow into the rupturing cohesive zone . instead of doing so , we prefer to treat flow in the cohesive zone as a separate feature that is in equilibrium and compatible with the surrounding gel . by treating flow in this manner , we will be able to obtain additional insights into its contribution to the toughness of the gel . specifically , the work done on the cohesive zone , which is required to rupture the polymer network and to force the solvent into the space created by the failure process , is additional to the elastic deformation of the polymer network and the associated dissipation due to solvent flow .",
    "we now state the governing equations for the cohesive zone .",
    "we notice that , due to the planar nature of the present setting , the cohesive zone coincides with the interval @xmath156 , where @xmath157 is its length , generally depending on @xmath26 .",
    "the balance of forces prescribes that the stresses @xmath158 and @xmath159 exerted by the cohesive zone on the gel along the planes @xmath160 and @xmath161 , respectively , must equal the traction @xmath162 within the cohesive zone .",
    "we have assumed that the tractions exchanged between the gel and the cohesive zone only have the component along @xmath163 , consistent with a mode i crack .    to enable analysis of the solvent pressure in the cohesive zone",
    ", we develop a transport model for the solvent within it .",
    "we assume that the cohesive zone permits solvent flux @xmath153 ( measured in @xmath164 ) along it and stores @xmath165 moles of solvent per unit length per unit thickness .",
    "the solvent flux @xmath153 thus characterizes flow that carries fluid from the crack to fill the newly forming fracture within the cohesive zone .",
    "the solvent flux must satisfy a mass conservation law in the form @xmath166 where @xmath167 and @xmath168 are the fluxes of solvent exchanged with the cohesive zone through the planes @xmath160 and @xmath161 , respectively . given the symmetry of the mode i fracture problem studied here , @xmath169 .",
    "similarly to the swelling constraint for the gel , which prescribes a link between the volume change and the change in solvent concentration , we relate the opening @xmath170 of the cohesive zone to the increment in solvent concentration @xmath165 through the constraint @xmath171 . with this",
    ", we may eliminate @xmath165 from the formulation of the problem and rewrite eq .   as @xmath172    as concerns the constitutive laws , we begin by prescribing the following relation for the cohesive traction @xmath173 where @xmath174 is the cohesive strength of the polymer network , @xmath175 is the crack opening displacement at which the polymer network fails , whereas @xmath176 is the chemical potential of the solvent within the cohesive zone .",
    "we enforce chemical equilibrium between the solvent in the cohesive zone and that in the gel , _ i.e. _ @xmath177 .",
    "moreover , we relate @xmath174 and @xmath175 to the fracture energy @xmath121 of the polymer network by requiring the work performed by @xmath178 until failure to equal @xmath121 , such that @xmath179 the choice of a linear traction - separation law for @xmath178 as in eq .",
    "implies a theoretically infinite cohesive length .",
    "nevertheless , we can give an operational definition of @xmath157 as the length across which crack opening varies from @xmath175 to @xmath180 .",
    "as is clear from this definition , @xmath157 is determined by the solution of the problem .",
    "finally , for the tangential flux @xmath153 we enforce darcy s law such that @xmath181 with @xmath182 the solvent mobility within the cohesive zone . given the absence of experimental evidence of how flow takes place relative to a polymer network that is tearing apart , we choose a linear model as the simplest possibility , such that @xmath183 .",
    "we proceed now with our treatment by exploring the energetic aspects of fracture in the presence of the poroelastic cohesive zone .",
    "first , the flux of energy @xmath100 in eq .   must be replaced by the power exchanged between the bulk gel and the cohesive zone , which may be evaluated as @xmath184 then , to relate this to the energy release rate @xmath185 in the far field , we retrace the steps that led us to eq .   by making use of eqs .  - , where the ( vanishing ) tip integrals must now be replaced by the following terms @xmath186 respectively . by doing so ,",
    "after some calculations we obtain @xmath187 we observe that @xmath188 will be negative in the cohesive zone due to the pressure gradient required to draw solvent into it . therefore ,",

    "in this section , we investigate numerically the problem of steady - state crack propagation to quantify possible sources of toughening . as we have seen in section  [ sec : ass ] , this analysis will also provide leading - order results for transient crack propagation .",
    "in particular , we explore the effect of crack tip velocity and material parameters on the degree of toughening @xmath189 , and compare the results obtained with and without the poroelastic cohesive zone model . to this aim",
    ", we carry out numerical simulations using the finite element method .",
    "given the assumption of steady - state crack growth , we take a time - independent domain centered at the crack tip as the computational domain , with characteristic size @xmath190 for the small - scale process zone hypothesis to hold .",
    "this requirement implies , in general , large values of the local ( mesh - dependent ) peclt numbers , and thus demands a numerical stabilization technique @xcite for the advection - diffusion equation @xmath54 with @xmath191 , to avoid excessively fine meshes . here ,",

    "i.e. _  without the cohesive zone model , we enforce the crack propagation criterion @xmath220 using an optimization procedure .",
    "specifically , for each crack tip velocity @xmath26 , this procedure solves for the applied stress intensity factor @xmath221 by minimizing the squared difference @xmath222 , where @xmath115 is computed from eq .  .",
    "we evaluate numerically the toughness ratio @xmath223 , which , as dictated by dimensional analysis , is a function of two dimensionless groups @xmath224 and @xmath225 : @xmath226 the results from our computation are reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : rcurve ] and confirm the existence of a velocity independent toughening .",
    "these results closely agree with the estimate of @xmath227 given by eq .  , where @xmath140 has been fitted to the numerical simulation for @xmath228 and then kept constant as @xmath224 varies .",
    "we employ now the _ poroelastic cohesive zone model _ as described in section  [ sec : cohzone ] . in this case , @xmath39 is found by a numerical optimization procedure that minimizes the squared difference @xmath229 , where @xmath230 is evaluated at @xmath231 . keeping the ratio of @xmath232 fixed",

    "[ fig : cohlvsv ] .",
    "thus , we have checked that in all computations at least 10 finite elements span the cohesive length . in the same spirit , we have also chosen the size @xmath235 of the computational domain to be large with respect to @xmath157 .     as a function of the dimensionless crack tip velocity @xmath236 for @xmath237 . from top to bottom",

    "[ fig : rcurve ] , now the effective toughness of the gel increases with crack tip velocity .",
    "we have already anticipated that the solvent pressure within the cohesive zone provides a toughening contribution that was not captured by the energy release rate approach , recall eq .  .",
    "the dependence of this contribution on crack tip velocity may be explained by considering the concurrent evolution of solvent pressure profile and cohesive length . as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : adimpresscoh ] , an increase in crack tip velocity results in increased solvent pressure magnitude within the cohesive zone . as a consequence , the second term in eq .   increases with @xmath218 and thus determines the observed trend of @xmath227 .     as a function of the dimensionless crack tip velocity @xmath218 .",
    "numerical results for a steadily propagating crack , obtained using the cohesive zone model described in section  [ sec : cohzone ] with @xmath137 . from top to bottom , lines correspond to increasing value of @xmath238 ( red ) , 200 ( blue ) , 1000 ( green ) . ]     ahead of the crack tip as a function of the dimensionless coordinate @xmath239 , with @xmath237 and @xmath240 . from bottom to top , lines correspond to increasing values of the dimensionless velocity @xmath241 ( red ) , 6 ( blue ) , 60 ( green ) . ]    proceeding to consider the dependence of toughening on the ratio @xmath233 , we observe that , as the size of the cohesive zone vanishes , the solution obtained with the cohesive zone model recovers that obtained with the energy release rate approach ( compare the corresponding lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : cohlvsv ] and in fig .",
    "[ fig : rcurvecoh ] ) .",
    "finally , for a given value of @xmath218 , the toughening increases with cohesive length @xmath157 by virtue of the increased extent of the region where work must be done on solvent pressure .",
    "in this study , the mode i fracture toughness has been explored for a polymer gel specimen containing a semi - infinite , propagating crack . first , by adopting a fracture criterion that relies on crack tip toughness only , we have demonstrated the existence of a crack tip velocity - independent enhancement in the resistance to fracture of the gel .",
    "physically , this toughening arises from the work performed by the solvent pressure against volume expansion within the process zone .",
    "the increase in effective toughness of the system , as quantified by the increase of the remotely applied stress intensity factor , has been evaluated through both asymptotic analyses and refined numerical simulations .",
    "then , we have introduced a poroelastic cohesive zone model , which opens the way to the future study of the micromechanics of diverse fracture processes in polymer gels and to future numerical simulations of transient crack propagation .",
    "in contrast to the first approach , we have shown that , in the presence of a cohesive zone , the applied stress intensity factor needed to sustain crack growth increases with crack tip velocity .",
    "this behaviour is determined by an additional contribution to the fracture toughness that arises from the resistance to crack opening offered by the negative solvent pressure within the cohesive zone .",
    "our results highlight the importance of poroelasticity and , more generally , of the accurate description of the processes occurring in the fracturing region in quantifying possible toughening mechanisms in polymer gels . besides their relevance in fracture of these synthetic materials",
    ", our findings may have a biological reach because many soft biological materials , for example brain tissue @xcite , have been shown to follow poroelasticity .",
    "experiments should be carried out to confirm the outcomes of the present study and to provide further insight to improve the cohesive zone modeling here presented .",
    "future work will also include the extension of our results to finite deformation poroelasticity .",
