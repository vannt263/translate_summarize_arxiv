    "however , in inoue & inutsuka ( 2008 ; henceforth paper i ) , we showed in a two - dimensional two - fluid mhd simulation that , if the converging flows and magnetic field are orthogonal , only the formation of hi clouds ( @xmath0 @xmath1 ) is possible instead of the formation of dense clouds ( precursor of molecular clouds ; @xmath2 @xmath1 ) due to the effect of magnetic pressure .",
    "using three - dimensional mhd simulation , heitsch et al .",
    "( 2009 ) also obtained results similar to ours even in the case with weak magnetic field ( @xmath3 @xmath4 g ) .    in the converging flow scenario , to trigger cooling collapse or thermal instability , supersonic flows are necessary ( hennebelle & prault 1999 ) . since magnetic pressure in the diffuse ism is comparable to thermal pressure , it is natural to assume that the direction of supersonic flows and mean magnetic field has no strong correlation .",
    "therefore it is important to investigate whether the formation of molecular clouds is possible when the converging flows and mean magnetic field have a small angle .",
    "using one - dimensional mhd simulation , hennebelle & prault ( 2000 ) showed that if the initial angle between the magnetic field and the fluid velocity is larger than 20 - 30 degrees with a few microgauss magnetic field strength , magnetic pressure prevents growth of thermal instability . in multi - dimension ,",

    "we use a two - dimensional , rectangular , numerical domain whose side lengths are @xmath5 pc and @xmath6 pc that is divided by @xmath7 uniform square cells ( @xmath8 ) . as an initial condition ,",
    "we set converging flows of warm neutral medium ( wnm ) that collide head - on at the center of @xmath9-axis . density and thermal pressure of the wnm are @xmath10 @xmath1 and @xmath11 k @xmath1 , which are in thermal equilibrium and typical values of wnm in the ism .",
    "our initial condition for the ionized gas is ionization equilibrium to the neutral gas .",
    "interested readers should refer to paper i for details .",
    "the velocity field of the converging flows is given such that @xmath12 where @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) and @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) is the converging component of the velocity , and @xmath17 is the fluctuation component .",

    "such a spectrum and velocity dispersion are naturally expected in the ism , since wnm is turbulent with velocity dispersion being transonic at a scale of a few hundreds pc ( dib et al .",

    "our initial conditions may correspond to the propagation of shock waves in the ism , e.g. , super - shell due to multiple supernovae and galactic spiral shock . in general , spiral shocks are highly oblique",

    "the evolution of the shocked wnm can be understood as follows ( see also paper i ) : at first , the wnm is compressed by the shock by which the wnm kicked out from the thermal equilibrium states and into states dominated by cooling .",
    "then the slab of shocked cooling gas contracts nearly isobarically in order to oppose the ram pressure of the converging flows .",
    "this contraction leads amplification of magnetic field by compressing transverse components of the magnetic field .",
    "once the magnetic pressure of the amplified magnetic field becomes comparable to the ram pressure , the isobaric contraction stops and the gas begins to cool nearly isochorically .",
    "the isobaric phase of the evolution does not last long , because the transverse component of the magnetic field is already amplified by the shock compression and the contraction by only a factor of a few can strengthen the magnetic field enough to oppose the ram pressure . during the isochoric evolution phase ,",
    "the gas becomes thermally unstable and some portion of the gas , whose density is enhanced by the compressions due to the turbulence given initially , grows toward a stable dense equilibrium , i.e. , cold neutral medium ( cnm ) . since thermal instability evolves essentially along the magnetic field , filaments of cnm are formed . on the other hand",

    "note that since the timescale of thermal instability toward the wnm phase is approximately 5 myr ( inoue et al . 2006 ; 2007 ) , which is longer than the timescale of the instability toward the cnm ( @xmath50 myr ) , the diffuse gas component in the shocked slab is still growing toward the wnm phase . in fig .",

    "high density clumps of @xmath61 @xmath1 are formed only at an early stage around the center of the numerical domain ( @xmath62 pc ) , since high density cnms can be generated until the thermal pressure of the slab begins to decrease , i.e. , until the magnetic pressure dominates the thermal pressure . to see this",

    "[ f5 ] ( a ) .",
    "note that only the magnetic field amplification a few times the initial strength makes the opposition of the magnetic pressure and the ram pressure possible .",

    "as in model 1a and 1b , the depicted times are chosen when the thickness of the shocked slab becomes larger than 20 pc .",

    "[ f4 ] ( c ) and ( d ) shows the cross section profiles of the thermal , magnetic , total ( thermal plus magnetic ) , and ram pressures at @xmath55 pc . in model 2a , owing to the slow shocks magnetic pressure does not dominate thermal pressure in the shocked slab . in this case",
    ", the condensation driven by cooling can proceed without decreasing thermal pressure greatly ( nearly isobaric contraction ) that leads formation of dense cnm whose number density is larger than 200 @xmath1 .",
    "this evolution is similar to the evolution of shocked gas in unmagnetized media ( see , paper i ) . in the case of model 2b , on the other hand , the magnetic and thermal pressures are comparable ( see fig .",
    "[ f4 ] [ d ] ) .",
    "the magnetic pressures , in particular those in model 2b , are still increasing to dominate the thermal pressure .",
    "since the shock propagation speed is fast , the shock waves reach computational boundaries within a few myr that makes the timescale short within which we can examine the evolution of the shocked slab .",
    "thus , we have not confirmed the clear domination of the magnetic pressure in the slab .",
    "however , in model 2b , we expect from the absence of the slow shocks that the shocked slab would evolve into a two - phase medium composed of low - density cnm ( @xmath70 @xmath1 ) and wnm as in model 1a and 1b . in order to confirm",
    "the domination of magnetic pressure , simulation with a much larger numerical domain is necessary .",

    "[ f3 ] ( c ) and ( d ) does not clearly differ between the two models .",
    "this is because the slab of model 2b is still in the isobaric contraction phase",
    ". the difference would be clear once the magnetic pressure dominates the thermal pressure in model 2b that leads the evolution of the isochoric cooling in n - p plane .",
    "what controls bifurcation of the number of induced shocks ?",
    "the condition of the bifurcation can be derived from the mhd rankine - hugoniot relations : @xmath73 where the subscripts 0 and 1 respectively denote the upstream and downstream value , @xmath74 is the shock propagation speed , and we have used the fact that @xmath75constant across the shock wave owing to @xmath76 . the equations ( 1)(3 ) represent the conservation laws of mass , tangential component of momentum , and tangential component of electric field , respectively .    immediately after the collision of the converging flows ,",

    "( [ rk1])([rk3 ] ) , eliminating @xmath74 and @xmath79 , we obtain @xmath80 in the case of the fast shock , if @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) , @xmath83 should be less ( greater ) than zero . therefore , collision of the converging flow induces only the fast shock , when @xmath84 where we have introduced the compression ratio of the density @xmath85 , and @xmath22 is the angle between converging flows and upstream magnetic field .",
    "if the velocity of the converging flows is smaller than the critical velocity @xmath86 , additional slow shocks are necessary in order to obtain physical down stream state . in fig .",
    "[ f7 ] , we show the critical velocity as a function of @xmath22 by using the typical parameters @xmath87 g , @xmath88 @xmath1 and @xmath89",
    ". we also plot the conditions corresponding to model 1a , 1b , 2a , and 2b .    in order to form dense cnm ( precursor of molecular clouds )",
    "whose number density is larger than 200 @xmath1 , the shocked gas should condense without decreasing thermal pressure , i.e. , the magnetic pressure should not dominate in the slab .",
    "this requires the slow shocks that lower magnetic field strength in the slab .",
    "thus , if the velocity of converging flows is smaller than the critical velocity a dense cnm sheet is formed as model 2a . on the other hand ,",
    "if the velocity of converging flows is larger than the critical velocity , the magnetic pressure dominate in the slab that leads isochoric cooling and formation of low - density hi clouds ( @xmath90 @xmath1 ) as model 1a , 1b , and as expected in model 2b .",
    "therefore , only the case where @xmath91 ( model 2a ) can generate molecular clouds directly from wnm . however , the column density of dense cnm sheet formed in model 2a ( the precursor of molecular cloud ) is at least an order of magnitude smaller than that of molecular clouds ( @xmath92 @xmath93 ) .",
    "thus , in order to form molecular clouds , the converging flows have to last a long time .",
    "note that , even in such case , the shocks continue to propagate outwards making direct formation of molecular clouds difficult as follows : the shocked gas that accretes to the dense cnm sheet is provided with sub - slow speed far from the dense cnm sheet . in the ism ,",
    "such a slow flow is easily affected by , e.g. , sne and stellar winds by which flow direction would change . as a result",
    ", the accretion to the dense cnm is stopped leading to failure of molecular cloud formation .      in model 3a and 3b , instead of the velocity fluctuations , we impose the highly tangled magnetic field .",
    "[ f2 ] ( e ) and ( f ) respectively show density structures and magnetic field lines of the results of model 3a and 3b at which the thickness of the shocked slab becomes larger than 20 pc$ ] , since the initial transverse component of magnetic field in model 3b is larger than the other models . ] .",
    "we see that the results are close to that of model 1a .",

    "[ f3 ] ( e ) and ( f ) , the cross - section profiles in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] ( e ) and ( f ) , and the average column density evolutions in fig . [ f5 ] ( c ) also show behavior similar to those of model 1a and 1b .",
    "since the condition in model 3b is more turbulent than model 3a due to the larger tangled component of magnetic field , the distribution of the gas in n - p plane in model 3b is more dispersed than model 3a .    from these results ,",
    "we conclude that evolution of the shocked slab is essentially determined by the angle between the mean magnetic field and converging flows , even if the mean magnetic field is weaker than the tangled component . the reason why the mean magnetic field determines the evolution of the shocked slab is that the tangled components of the magnetic field behave as alfvn waves which eventually decay due to the cascade of mhd turbulence within alfvn crossing time ( goldreich & sridar 1995 ; cho & lazarian 2005 ) . therefore ,",
    "if @xmath94 , even when the tangled components dominate the mean field , the fate of the shocked slab is determined by the mean magnetic field .",
    "one may wonder the different conclusion given in heitsch et al .",
    "( 2009 ) in which tangled magnetic field component affect the post shock structure greatly .",
    "in heitsch et al ( 2009 ) , they compared the models in which the mean magnetic field is parallel to the flow direction except their model y05 . in these cases , the shocked gas evolves in different ways depending on the local orientation of magnetic field as follows : if the local magnetic field is parallel to the converging flows , the magnetic field is not enhanced that would leads formation of dense cnm . on the other hand ,",
    "if local magnetic field is perpendicular to the flow , the enhanced magnetic pressure would prevents formation of dense cnm that leads void .",
    "thus , the tangled component of magnetic field can change the morphology of the clouds , if we consider the case of vanishing transverse mean magnetic field . in our calculation",
    ", we consider the models in which the mean magnetic field and the converging flows have finite angles . in these cases , if @xmath95 , the magnetic pressure eventually dominate the thermal pressure in the post shock media that prevents direct formation of dense cnm and leaves two - phase media composed of low - density cnm and wnm .",
    "in this paper , using two - dimensional two - fluid mhd simulations , we studied the formation of interstellar clouds as a consequence of thermal instability in the shocked slab generated by converging wnm flows .",
    "our findings are as follows :    * the evolution of the shocked slab is controlled by the parameters @xmath96 ( the velocity of the converging flows ) and @xmath22 ( the angle between the converging flows and the mean magnetic field ) . * if the velocity of the converging flows is larger than the critical velocity @xmath97 derived in eq .",
    "( [ vc ] ) and @xmath22 is at least larger than 15 deg .",
    ", hi clouds embedded in wnm are formed in the slab , as we speculated in paper i. in general , in the case with a moderate magnetic field strength ( @xmath98 @xmath4 g ) , the critical velocity @xmath97 is comparable to the sound speed of the wnm @xmath99 10 km s@xmath100 ( see , fig . [ f4 ] )",
    "depending on @xmath22 .",
    "it is known that in order to trigger cooling collapse or thermal instability , supersonic flows are necessary ( hennebelle & prault 1999 ) .",
    "therefore , this would be the most probable fate of the converging flows in the ism . *",
    "if the velocity of the converging flows is smaller than the critical velocity or the angle @xmath22 is nearly zero , dense clouds that possibly evolve into molecular clouds can be formed in the slab ( see , hennebelle et al .",
    "2008 ; banerjee et al . 2008",
    "; heitsch et al .",
    "2009 in the case of @xmath101 ) .",
    "* the entanglement of the magnetic field is not an important control parameter for the evolution of the shocked slab .",
    "the important parameter is the angle between _ mean magnetic field _ and the converging flows .",
    "even if strength of the mean magnetic field is weaker than the strength of the entangled component ( dispersion ) , the mean magnetic field determines evolution of the shocked slab .    in summary ,",

    "note that our results are obtained using two - dimensional simulations that may change the configuration of clouds in three dimensions due to the modes of fluid motion that are not appear in planar case , e.g. , the interchange mode .",

    "however , the model y05",
    "( @xmath102 deg . and",
    "@xmath3 @xmath4 g ) of heitsch et al .",
    "( 2009 ) shows that , even when the initial magnetic field strength is an order of magnitude weaker than the equipartition , the magnetic pressure dominate thermal pressure in the shocked slab .",
    "this suggests that there is no mechanism that reduces the enhanced magnetic pressure even in 3d .",
    "thus , we can expect that the enhancement of magnetic pressure makes the direct formation of molecular cloud difficult even in 3d .    in this paper",
    ", we also neglect the effect of self - gravity .",
    "as discussed in koyama & inutsuka ( 2002 ) , the scale of the clumps of cnm generated by thermal instability is much smaller than the jeans length .",
    "thus , we can neglect the effect of self - gravity on each individual cnm clumps .",
    "furthermore , the mean densities in the shocked slabs are smaller than 10 @xmath1 ( see fig . 8 below ) indicating the jeans length of shocked slab larger than 50 pc and the free - fall time larger than 50 myr , even if we underestimate the mean temperature of the shocked slabs as 100 k. thus , we can safely neglect the effect of self - gravity that leads contraction of shocked slab to form molecular cloud . note that this is not the case when theta = 0 deg , since the mean density of the slab would be much larger .",
    "we have shown that the direct formation of molecular clouds from wnm seems difficult unless some mechanisms creates biased supersonic flows of wnm that is parallel to the mean magnetic field orientation .",
    "our results would be also applied to the situations of propagation of single shock wave , e.g. , super - shell due to multiple supernovae ( sne ) and spiral shock wave . in the cases of the super shell ,",
    "one of the ram pressures of converging flows that bound the shell would be substituted by the thermal pressure of the hot gas , and in the case of the spiral shock that would be substituted by enhanced thermal pressure that balances the stellar potential .    however , if we consider some mechanisms that further pile up the gas in the two - phase shell generated by the converging flows , the formation of molecular clouds is possible .",
    "for example , in the case of model 1a , the mean density of the gas in the two - phase shell is @xmath68 @xmath1 that is more than ten times higher than wnm .",
    "thus , molecular cloud with @xmath103 mag . would be formed if the two - phase gas in the shell is piled up again only over tens of parsec along the magnetic field line .",
    "the ism is known to be frequently ( once in a million years ) swept up by sn shocks , which propagate a few hundred parsecs until decay .",
    "thus , it can induce formation of molecular clouds by piling up the massive two - phase shell . as in the case of the converging flows studied in this paper , sn shock can pile up gas only when it propagates along the magnetic field line in the two - phase shell . despite this , it is promising because of the high event rate of sn .",
    "we note the difficulty in propagation of a single sn shock wave piling up enough wnm to generate molecular clouds even if it propagates along magnetic field line because of its short lifetime",
    ". the single sn shock can generate molecular clouds only when the density of preshock gas is enhanced by something just as we consider here .",
    "what is the angle @xmath22 below which the converging flows form the massive shell that can evolve into molecular clouds ?",
    "if we assume an sn shock wave that pile up again the two - phase shell , the mean density in the two - phase shell should be larger than @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the propagation length of sn shock until decay and @xmath106 is the visual extinction of the formed molecular cloud . in ",
    "3.1 , we have shown that the mean density enhancement due to the isobaric contraction of the shocked gas is stopped when the ram pressure of the converging flows and the magnetic pressure in the shell are balanced .",
    "this indicates that the isobaric contraction enhances the post shock gas by a factor of @xmath107 , where subscript 0 stands for preshock state ( wnm ) and subscript 1 stands for postshock state ( immediately behind the shock front ) .",
    "note that @xmath108 depends on @xmath22 ( the angle between upstream magnetic field and shock normal ) .",
    "thus , the mean density of the shocked slab ( two - phase shell ) can be estimated by @xmath109 where subscript @xmath110 stands for preshock state ( wnm ) , subscript @xmath111 stands for postshock state ( immediately behind the shock wave ) , the @xmath9- and @xmath47-axes respectively represent directions normal to and tangential to the shock front , and @xmath22 is the angle between the preshock magnetic field and flow . in fig .",
    "[ f8 ] , we plot the mean density @xmath112 ( eq . [ md ] ) against the angle between the converging flows and mean magnetic field @xmath22 by using preshock conditions of model 1a and 1b .",
    "the postshock condition is calculated by solving the mhd rankine - hugoniot relation .",
    "we also plot the mean density of our model 1a and 1b as crosses , which are evaluated at the times depicted in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] , and plot the estimate of the critical mean density in equation ( [ cd ] ) as a dotted line . if the mean density is larger than the critical density , a sn shock wave can generate molecular cloud by piling up the shell .",
    "the results of simulations agree well with theoretical estimation of equation ( [ md ] ) . from this figure",
    ", we expect that the formation of molecular clouds by piling up the two - phase shell is possible roughly when @xmath113 deg ..    we conclude that the formation scenario of molecular clouds from the two - phase medium ( hi clouds embedded in wnm ) is expected to be a typical scenario . in this scenario , the fundamental building blocks of molecular clouds are not wnm but h i clouds consistent with the suggestions from observations of molecular clouds in local group galaxies ( fukui 2007 ; blitz et al .",
    "recently , we showed that a very strong shock wave that sweeps up two - phase gas cause turbulence and magnetic field amplification in the post shock medium ( inoue et al .",
    "2009 , see also giacalone & jokipii 2007 ) . a similar phenomenon would also affect the physical conditions of molecular clouds formed from hi clouds as a result of shock sweeping that will be examined in a future paper .    note that the above speculation is obtained by assuming that the mean magnetic field strength in wnm is near equipartition to the thermal energy ( @xmath114 @xmath4 g ) .",
    "if the mean magnetic field strength is much larger than the equipartition , the direct formation of molecular clouds becomes easier , since the critical velocity derived in eq .",
    "( 14 ) depends linearly on @xmath115 .",
    "also , the weak magnetic field would lead the direct formation of molecular clouds , if magnetic pressure is too weak to stop the isobaric contraction of the shocked slab .",

    "<S> formation of interstellar clouds as a consequence of thermal instability is studied using two - dimensional two - fluid magnetohydrodynamic simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the situation of converging , supersonic flows of warm neutral medium in the interstellar medium that generate a shocked slab of thermally unstable gas in which clouds form . </S>",
    "<S> we found , as speculated in paper i , that in the shocked slab magnetic pressure dominates thermal pressure and the thermal instability grows in the isochorically cooling , thermally unstable slab that leads formation of hi clouds whose number density is typically @xmath0 @xmath1 , even if the angle between magnetic field and converging flows is small . </S>",
    "<S> we also found that even if there is a large dispersion of magnetic field , evolution of the shocked slab is essentially determined by the angle between the mean magnetic field and converging flows . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the direct formation of molecular clouds by piling up warm neutral medium does not seem a typical molecular cloud formation process , unless the direction of supersonic converging flows is biased to the orientation of mean magnetic field by some mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> however , when the angle is small , the hi shell generated as a result of converging flows is massive and possibly evolves into molecular clouds , provided gas in the massive hi shell is piled up again along the magnetic field line . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that another subsequent shock wave can pile up again the gas of the massive shell and produce a larger cloud . </S>",
    "<S> we thus emphasize the importance of multiple episodes of converging flows , as a typical formation process of molecular clouds . </S>"
