    "galaxies having a gas - phase metallicity smaller than a tenth of the solar metallicity are often known as extremely metal - poor .",
    "they are of astrophysical interest for a number of reasons , among which include determining the primordial he abundance produced during the big bang @xcite , studying star formation in conditions of low metallicity @xcite , understanding the formation of dust in the early universe @xcite , analyzing primitive interstellar media @xcite , constraining the properties of the first stars @xcite , following the assembly of primitive disks @xcite , and studying the intergalactic gas .",
    "unfortunately , the number of known xmps remains small .",
    "the review paper by contained only 31 xmps , @xcite added 8 new targets from the early data release of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , the exploration in sdss - dr6 by yielded 44 sources , and the systematic bibliographic search for all xmps in literature and the sdss - dr7 carried out by @xcite rendered 140 sources .",
    "@xcite included targets found by @xcite , , , and @xcite .",
    "although new local metal - poor objects have been discovered since 2011 , xmps remain uncommon .",
    "the scarcity of known xmps is in sharp contrast with the expectation that most galaxies are actually xmps .",
    "the problem has been put forward by several authors @xcite , with the following argument : there is a well - known relation between absolute luminosity or stellar mass and gas - phase metallicity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; consequently all faint or low - mass galaxies should be xmps . using as the metallicity threshold , , then the limit in eq .",
    "( [ faint4 ] ) roughly corresponds to one tenth of the solar metallicity . ]",
    "@xmath2 the metallicity versus absolute magnitude relationship by @xcite implies that galaxies with absolute @xmath3-band magnitude @xmath4 are xmps .",
    "similarly , the metallicity versus stellar mass relationship in the paper by @xcite entails that galaxies with stellar masses @xmath5 correspond to xmp galaxies .",
    "equation  ( [ faint ] ) can be re - written for the @xmath6band magnitude using the transformation from @xmath3 to @xmath7 in @xcite for typical colors of gas - rich galaxies , leading to @xmath8 since low - mass , low - luminosity galaxies outnumber , by far , high - mass , high - luminosity galaxies , most galaxies are expected to be xmps .",
    "these faint xmps , with magnitudes and/or masses below the thresholds in eqs .",
    "( [ faint ] ) , ( [ faint2 ] ) , and ( [ faint3 ] ) , will be designated here as quiescent xmps , or , qxmps .",
    "the remaining xmps are often denoted as _ active _ xmps .",
    "note that , by definition , active xmps are low - metallicity outliers of the luminosity - metallicity relationship .",
    "hence , why are xmps so unusual among the observed galaxies ? it is argued that most qxmps also have low surface brightness , so low as to be below the detection threshold of the largest surveys ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "so far as we are aware , this qualitative argument has never been quantified . in other words , ( 1 )",
    "what is the number of qxmps to be expected in current surveys ? and , ( 2 ) is this prediction consistent with the number of known qxmps ?",
    "our paper addresses these two questions , finding that observational biases alone can not account for the scarcity of observed xmps .",
    "the luminosity function of xmp galaxies must decline for objects fainter than the limits in eqs .",
    "( [ faint ] ) and ( [ faint2 ] ) .",
    "we show that such a drop is expected from cosmological numerical simulations , provided xmps are central , rather than , satellite galaxies .",
    "the ultraviolet ( uv ) background is then expected to prevent the formation of low - mass galaxies .",
    "several physical processes may suppress gas accretion and star formation in low - mass dark matter halos .",
    "the cosmological uv background heats the intergalactic gas and establishes a minimum mass for halos that can accrete gas .",
    "the gas in low - mass halos may also be photo - evaporated by the uv background after re - ionization .",
    "in addition , the ionizing radiation dissociates molecular hydrogen , which is the main coolant for low - metallicity gas , thus preventing star formation even before the gas is completely stripped from the halos by other quenching processes .",
    "stellar feedback processes , such as supernova explosions and stellar winds , are also able to remove gas from galaxy disks , reducing the star formation efficiency in low mass halos , where the gravitational binding energy is particularly low ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , when the galaxy has a stellar mass smaller than several @xmath9 , most of the gas that could be used to form stars returns unused to the inter - galactic medium .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section  [ obs_constraints ] describes the number of qxmps observed in the spectroscopic sample of the sdss - dr7 , which is chosen because this survey provides most of the known xmps .",
    "section  [ estimate1 ] is devoted to estimating the expected number of qxmps from the galaxy luminosity function , by firstly extrapolating the observed luminosity function to faint objects , and then including the effect of the baryon fraction changing with the dark matter halo mass ( sect .",
    "[ quenching ] ) .",
    "the results are discussed in section  [ discussion ] , including an analysis of the factors that limit the number of observed qxmps , and how they can be overcome in future searches ( sect .",
    "[ exploring_limits ] ) .",
    "the number of observed qxmps to be expected in other existing and forthcoming surveys is determined in section  [ other_surveys ] .",
    "the results are collected and summarized in section  [ conclusions ] . throughout the paper ,",
    "the hubble constant @xmath10 is taken to be 70kms@xmath11mpc@xmath11 .",
    "the search for xmps during the last decade has been very much focused on the spectroscopic sample of the sdss - dr7 @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this section is to evaluate how many qxmps have been found as part of these sdss - dr7-based searches .",
    "a comprehensive list is needed to compare the number of observed and expected qxmps .",
    "we have built the list by searching all recent papers that may have xmps from the sdss - dr7 .",
    "the galaxies in this paper were filtered so as to keep only those from the sdss - dr7 with metallicity and luminosity below the thresholds in eqs .",
    "( [ faint4 ] ) and ( [ faint3 ] ) , respectively .",
    "the samples that were analyzed are :    1 .",
    "the ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ml+11 ) xmp sample , which contains a compilation of all low metallicity ( @xmath12\\lesssim 7.65 $ ] ) sources from the literature until the date of publication , plus several new targets from the sdss - dr7 spectroscopic sample .",

    "only sources with @xmath13  mag are considered here , where both the metallicity and photometry are compiled from literature .",

    "the ( * ? ? ?",
    "* james+15 ) sample , a set of sdss - selected blue diffuse dwarf galaxies , with metallicities from mmt observations and photometry from the sdss .    from these six samples , we selected galaxies fulfilling the following criteria : ( a ) appear in the sdss - dr7 spectroscopic catalog , ( b ) their @xmath3-band absolute magnitudes are larger than -12.5 , and ( c ) have metallicities @xmath14 . for the resulting sources , we checked whether the photometry was reliable , particularly in those cases where only sdss photometry is available .",
    "for the sdss photometry , we first visually inspected the sdss images of the sources and registered the source size .",
    "the visual sizes were then compared with the sdss petrosian g - band radius at 90% of the light , obtained at the position of the sdss spectroscopic target .",
    "if the sizes were well - matched , the sdss photometry was deemed reliable , and the source was retained as a qxmp . if the sizes were not well - matched , we then looked into literature for a value for the photometry .",
    "most of them happen to have alternative photometry , which allowed us to exclude 90%   of them as qxmps .",
    "only three objects had no alternative photometry , and they were discarded by the argument that their chance of being an qxmp is the same as those with photometry .",
    "this chance is only 10% , which amounts to 0.3 sources .",
    "figures [ observation]a and [ observation]b summarize the selection procedure and its outcome .",
    "they show oxygen abundance versus absolute @xmath3 magnitude for the galaxies in the previous references . in order to avoid overcrowding ,",
    "the samples are split into two plots , and only xmps with reliable magnitudes are shown for @xmath15 .",
    "figure  [ observation]a contains the compilation ml+11 , plus the xmps from the sdss - dr7 recently identified in sa+16 .",
    "there are only five targets with @xmath15 that seem to be bona - fide qxmps in the sdss - dr7 spectroscopic database . those are encircled with black outlines in fig .",

    "one of these appears in the two samples with slightly different magnitude and metallicity ; the two corresponding points are encircled together .",

    "@xcite are also included in the figure for reference , even though they do not belong to the sdss - dr7 spectroscopic sample .",
    "after a screening similar to the one carried out with the objects in fig .",
    "[ observation]a , we are left with only four new targets outlined with solid lines in fig .",
    "[ observation]b .",
    "the samples represented in fig .",
    "[ observation]b contain 4 additional qxmps , which are outlined with dashed lines in the figure .",
    "they are already in the samples by ml+11 or sa+16 , and so , they do not contribute to the total number of qxmps .    at the end of our selection process , we are left with nine qxmps ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath16 where the error considers only the poissonian statistical error associated with the process of counting ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is important to realize that eq .",
    "( [ obs_qxmp ] ) probably represents an upper limit .",
    "since qxmps are so uncommon , the chances of having false positives ( non - qxmp galaxies misidentified as qxmp ) are expected to be much greater than the chances of having false negatives ( qxmps excluded by mistake ) .",
    "the coordinates and main properties of the nine qxmps are listed in table  [ coordinates ] , while their sdss images are shown in fig .",
    "[ images ] .",
    "many of them are contained transversally in more than one of the analyzed samples .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : surveys ]    the parameters that define the surveys are given in table  [ tab : surveys ] .",
    "lsst , des and kids do not explicitly give the half - compleness , sb .",
    "in these cases , we infer it from the depth for point sources as described in appendix  [ appb ] .",
    "as is shown in table  [ tab : surveys ] , the number of qxmps expected in the next generation of wide area surveys is very large , reaching up to @xmath17 in the 10-year average lsst .",
    "the actual number changes by one order of magnitude , depending on whether the lf increases towards low luminosity ( the black solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a ) or if it flattens out ( the red solid line in fig .  [ fig2]a ) .",
    "therefore , it should be easy to discriminate both trends using these new surveys .",
    "for example , the ongoing gama survey predicts 10 or 100 qxmps , depending on the lf faint end . in agreement with the conclusion in the previous section ,",
    "the key factor determining @xmath18 is not so much the sb cutoff but the limiting magnitude , @xmath19 .",
    "note , however , that even if the surveys contain all these new qxmps , it will be imposible to confirm the xmp nature of many of the faint objects .",
    "the spectroscopic follow up required to determine abundances will be possible only in those qxmps where star - forming regions are bright enough .",
    "galaxies follow a relationship between luminosity and gas - phase metallicity , so that faint galaxies tend to be metal - poor galaxies as well . since the luminosity function increases steeply towards low luminosity",
    ", one would naively expect that most observed galaxies are metal - poor .",
    "this is not the case .",
    "this apparent inconsistency is usually attributed to the low - luminosity of the metal - poor objects , which are under - represented in galaxy surveys .",
    "firstly , this occurs due to the malmquist bias : surveys are apparent magnitude - limited , so that the sampled volume drops down dramatically for faint sources .",
    "secondly , low - luminosity galaxies are also low - sb galaxies , and the surveys tend to miss extended , low - sb objects .",
    "this dearth of metal - poor galaxies is particularly severe for the so - called extremely metal poor ( xmp ) galaxies , with a gas - phase metallicity smaller than a tenth of the solar metallicity .",
    "they are of astrophysical interest for a number of reasons highlighted in sect .",
    "[ motivation ] , but they represent only a tiny fraction of the galaxies in the most popular surveys ( e.g. , 0.02% in the recent sdss - dr7 search by * ? ? ?",
    ". moreover , most of the observed xmps are outliers of the luminosity - metallicity relationship .",
    "therefore , they are not part of the predicted sea of faint xmps .",
    "( we denote the faint xmps as _ quiescent _ xmps or qxmps . )",
    "the question arises as to whether the actual number of observed xmps is _ quantitatively _ consistent with the expected number .",
    "we address this question in the present paper .",
    "most known xmps come from the sdss - dr7 spectroscopic survey , so we compare the number of observed qxmps in this survey with the expected number .",
    "the main conclusion of our work is that they disagree , unless the luminosity function for qxmps is considerably shallower than the extrapolation to low luminosity of the observed lf .",
    "the number of qxmps in the sdss - dr7 spectroscopic survey turns out to be @xmath20 , with the error bar representing the poissonian fluctuation ( sect .",
    "[ obs_constraints ] , table  [ coordinates ] , and figs .  [ observation ] and [ images ] ) . extrapolating to @xmath21 the lf for faint galaxies observed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) , the expected number is 42 ( sect .",
    "[ estimate1 ] ) .",
    "this estimate takes into account the malmquist bias plus the finite completeness of sdss for low - sb objects .",
    "in addition , it includes the scatter in the sb versus magnitude relationship , that effectively increases the completeness of the survey at low luminosities ( appendix ) . once the various uncertainties involved in the estimate are considered ( sect .",
    "[ error ] ) , the expected number of qxmps is in the range between 12 and 73 , with the low value highly disfavored .    on the other hand ,",
    "if the previous lf is modified to include the decrease of baryon fraction in low - mass dark matter halos , then the upturn at low luminosity disappears ( fig .  [ fig2]a ) , rendering an expectation of only 6 qxmps .",
    "( the number is between 3 and 12 when uncertainties are taken into account ; see sect .  [ quenching ] . )",
    "the tension with observation automatically disappears . including the varying baryon fraction implicitly assumes the qxmps to be central galaxies in their dark matter haloes .",
    "in fact , the lf for centrals determined by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see fig .",
    "[ fig3]a ) does not show the upturn , and it predicts between 3 and 9 qxmps ( sect .",
    "[ cen_or_sat ] and table  [ table1 ] ) .",
    "the agreement with observations has several implications .",
    "firstly , qxmps seem to be centrals , rather than satellite galaxies .",
    "qxmps become tracers of low - mass halos not gravitationally bound to more massive halos , and so they can be used to trace these haloes observationally .",
    "these low - mass dark matter halos are of clear astrophysical interest in the context of characterizing the building blocks in the hierarchical formation of galaxies and , in particular , the effect of the cosmic uv background in their baryonic content .",
    "the fact that qxmps seem to be centrals is consistent with the observation that most xmps appear to be isolated and in low density regions of the universe ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "secondly , the upturn in the faint end of the observed lf appears to be due to satellite galaxies , and this should be taken into account when comparing observations and numerical models .",
    "thirdly , the baryon fraction predicted by the numerical models by @xcite is consistent with observations .",
    "finally , there is no expectation of finding a significant number of new qxmps in the sdss - dr7 spectroscopic survey .    assuming that our modeling of the sdss biases is correct , we have studied which , among the parameters defining the survey , restricts the number of qxmps most ( sect .  [ exploring_limits ] ) .",
    "it turns out to be the apparent magnitude limit , which is more relevant than the incompleteness .",
    "thus , the photometric sdss - dr7 survey , which is 4 magnitudes deeper than the spectroscopic one , should contain as many as 2800 qxmps .",
    "the expected numbers in various other surveys are determined in sect .",
    "[ other_surveys ] , and a summary is presented in table  [ tab : surveys ] .",
    "future surveys are predicted to detect qxmps in large quantities .",
