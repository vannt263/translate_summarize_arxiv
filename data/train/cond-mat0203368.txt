    "a cornerstone of the modern theory of critical phenomena is the arrangement of microscopically different systems in universality classes of equivalent critical behavior.@xcite few basic properties , such as the spatial dimension @xmath4 , the order - parameter symmetry , and gross features of the interactions determine to which universality class for static bulk critical behavior a particular system belongs .",
    "these universality classes can be represented by simple continuum models like the @xmath5 model , which are minimal in the sense that dropping any of the hamiltonian s terms implies a change of the universality class .",
    "an important alternative way of representing the universality classes is through standard lattice ( spin ) models such as the ising model , which lend themselves best for precise monte carlo simulations .",
    "a similar classification scheme exists for _ dynamic _ bulk critical behavior.@xcite the associated universality classes  called dynamic bulk universality classes henceforth  additionally depend on basic properties of the dynamics such as conservation laws , and since distinct dynamics may have the same equilibrium distribution , each _ static _",
    "universality class generally splits up into _ several dynamic _ ones .",
    "the latter are represented by stochastic models called a , b ,  , j.@xcite    research over the past 25 years has revealed the existence of analogous universality classes for _ static surface",
    "_ critical behavior of semi - infinite systems at _ bulk critical points_.@xcite to which static surface universality class a given system belongs is decided by its static bulk universality class and additional relevant surface properties .",
    "hence each static surface universality class as well as each dynamic bulk universality class usually splits up into separate dynamic surface universality classes .",
    "furthermore , systems belonging to the same _ static surface _ universality class and the same _ dynamic bulk _ universality class may be representative of _ distinct dynamic surface _",
    "universality classes as local changes of the dynamics at the surface can be relevant.@xcite    unfortunately , the number of detailed theoretical investigations of dynamic surface critical behavior performed until now is rather limited.@xcite furthermore , they focused more or less exclusively on models with purely",
    "_ relaxational dynamics_. on the experimental side , the situation is worse : stringent experimental checks of the theoretical predictions for dynamic surface critical behavior , though urgently needed , are still lacking .",
    "one obvious reason for this is the difficulty of such experiments .",
    "the impressive progress made during the past two decades in the perfection of surface - sensitive scattering techniques has so far led only to accurate experimental investigations of _ static _ surface critical behavior.@xcite demonstrating that similarly conclusive data can also be obtained for _ dynamic _ surface critical behavior remains a major experimental challenge , albeit such experiments are expected to become feasible in the near future . according to",
    "the recent tesla design report,@xcite the x - ray free electron laser offers a great potential for such experiments .",
    "theoretical progress can play an important role in stimulating such experiments .",
    "we believe that theoretical advances in two directions are essential for achieving this goal . on the one hand ,",
    "models representing other bulk dynamic universality classes must be considered , generalized to systems with boundaries , and carefully investigated to find out what kinds of dynamic surface critical behavior can occur , i.e. , which dynamic surface universality classes exist . on the other hand ,",
    "detailed theoretical predictions should be worked out for _ experimentally accessible quantities _ like structure functions etc .",
    "pursuing these goals , we will investigate the dynamic surface critical behavior of _ isotropic heisenberg ferromagnets _ in this paper .",
    "well - known characteristic features of the dynamics of such magnets are the presence of _ nondissipative ( mode - coupling ) terms _ and the _ conservation of the order parameter_. we shall employ two different lines of approaches : ( i ) analytic work based on the field - theoretic renormalization group ( rg ) and ( ii ) computer - simulation studies of the dynamic surface structure function .",
    "a brief account of parts of our work has been given elsewhere.@xcite    in our rg work we utilize an appropriate semi - infinite extension of the usual stochastic bulk model j,@xcite which represents the dynamic bulk universality class of the isotropic heisenberg ferromagnet , without energy conservation .",
    "a familiar problem one is faced with is the following . whereas the upper critical dimension of this dynamic model is @xmath6 , the one of its steady - state distribution , described by the usual @xmath7 model with an @xmath8 vector field @xmath9 , is @xmath10 .",
    "thus the small parameter in which a dimensionality expansion can be made in the dynamic case is @xmath11 rather than @xmath12 , where @xmath4 is the bulk dimension . for @xmath13 ,",
    "the static critical behavior is given by mean - field theory and associated with the ( then infrared - stable ) gaussian fixed point of the @xmath7 theory , even though the dynamic critical behavior is described by a nontrivial fixed point that is characterized by a non - zero value @xmath14 of the mode - coupling vertex and accessible to the @xmath15 expansion .",
    "unfortunately , this expansion is _ not tailored _ to capture the nontrivial static critical exponents that emerge as @xmath4 drops below @xmath16 .",
    "therefore it is of somewhat limited use in the physically interesting three - dimensional case or , more generally , for @xmath3 . in order to to find out which scaling laws exist relating the critical exponents of dynamic bulk and surface quantities to known bulk and surface critical indices , it is essential to formulate the field - theoretic rg for fixed values of @xmath17",
    ". we do this by _ extending existing massive rg schemes for semi - infinite systems @xcite to dynamics_. this yields rg ( callan - symanzik ) equations whose exploitation in conjunction with known boundary operator expansions@xcite reveals that the dynamic bulk and surface critical exponents can be expressed completely in terms of known static ones , besides giving the scaling forms of quantities like the surface structure function .    in order to check these finding we have performed high - precision computer simulations of a semi - infinite lattice model of classical heisenberg spins whose dynamics is defined via the deterministic nondissipative equations of motion implied by their poisson bracket relations .",
    "the advantage of this simple dynamics without noise is that recently developed extremely efficient spin dynamics algorithms @xcite can be employed to compute the temporal development from given initial spin configurations , which we choose from a thermal equilibrium distribution generated via a monte carlo simulation .",
    "it should be emphasized that this lattice model differs in an important aspect from the continuum model we consider : unlike the latter , it _ conserves the energy_. nevertheless , both models belong to the same universality class , as we intend to show .    the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    ", we can benefit from well - known results for the static theory described by the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hgl1 ] ) , which is equivalent to the @xmath5-hamiltonian ( [ eq : hgl ] ) except for a change @xmath588 of the interaction constant ( see , for example , refs .   and ref .  , and their references ) . as a consequence",

    "likewise , the renormalization factor @xmath593 which relates @xmath594 to its renormalized counterpart @xmath595 can be expressed in terms of known renormalization functions of the @xmath5-theory .",
    "( it is a product of @xmath596 and a factor linear in @xmath597 whose @xmath589-dependent coefficient derives from the additive counterterm that the @xmath5-vertex function @xmath598 requires.@xcite )    the resulting rg flow of @xmath589 and @xmath595 has two nontrivial fixed points at @xmath599 : one at @xmath600 , and another one at @xmath601 .",

    "the results of ref .   imply that the running coupling constant associated with @xmath595 tends to zero as @xmath609 in the limit @xmath420 .",
