    "beginning with the rotational curves of galaxies , the astronomical and astrophysical evidence gathered in recent years supports the hypothesis of dark matter in our universe . moreover",
    ", the models of structure formation favor the so - called cold dark matter which consists of weakly interacting particles with non - relativistic velocities .",
    "based mainly on the cosmic microwave background measurements , one obtains the following limits on the relic density of cold dark matter cross - section @xmath0 where the @xmath1 interval was obtained from the three - year data of the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) , combined with the results of sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , supernovae legacy survey ( snls ) experiment and from baryonic acoustic oscillations data @xcite .",
    "one of the main motivations for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) is the inability of sm to provide candidates for cold dark matter . in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) with r - parity conservation , the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is always stable .",
    "if it is also a colour singlet , electrically neutral and massive , it is a good candidate for cold dark matter . in many scenarios , in particular those where supersymmetry breaking is gravity mediated ,",
    "the lightest neutralino is the lsp and a suitable dark matter candidate .",
    "we can then calculate its number density @xmath2 by solving the boltzmann equation @xmath3 where the first term on the right - hand side corresponds to a dilution due to the expansion of the universe , and the second one to a decrease due to annihilations and co - annihilations . here",
    ", @xmath4 denotes the hubble expansion parameter , @xmath5 the density of the relic particle in thermal equilibrium and @xmath6 is the relative velocity of the annihilating pair .",
    "the boltzmann equation can be integrated numerically and the energy density of the dark matter particle is approximately inversely proportional to the thermally averaged annihilation cross - section @xmath7 , @xmath8 the latter includes all annihilation and co - annihilation processes of the dark matter particle into standard model particles .",
    "these by now standard calculations are incorporated in program packages such as darksusy @xcite and micromegas @xcite which allow different scenarios and different models to be studied . using the experimental limits ( [ cwmap ] ) , we can put constraints on the mssm parameter space .",
    "if one is confined to the mssm with gravity mediated supersymmetry breaking ( msugra ) , the constraints allow for a rather narrow allowed band in the space of the high - scale parameters @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , the constraints are expected to become even more strict in the future when the planck mission will provide additional data . to match and fully exploit the current and expected experimental precision , one has to improve the theoretical prediction of the relic density by including the radiative corrections .",
    "we calculated the qcd and susy - qcd corrections to neutralino annihilation into quarks . in the work presented here ,",
    "we investigate the effects of radiative corrections on the constraints of the mssm parameter space .",
    "neutralino annihilation into fermions is one of the most important annihilation channels .",
    "it is dominant for light neutralinos where all other final states are not kinematically allowed .",
    "the leading order cross - section was discussed in much detail in @xcite .",
    "the cross - section in the non - relativistic limit is conventionally written as ( see @xcite ) @xmath10 where @xmath6 is the relative velocity of the neutralino pair . in the case of annihilation into fermions ,",
    "the coefficient @xmath11 is proportional to the mass of the fermion @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the dominant final states are the third generation fermions , i.e. in our case the top and bottom quarks .",
    "note that the contribution from the coefficient @xmath12 is suppressed with respect to the one coming from @xmath11 .",
    "the annihilation into fermions has to be enhanced by a resonance in order to yield a small enough relic density satisfying the experimental constraints ( [ cwmap ] ) .",
    "it proceeds mainly through a higgs boson resonance ( in particular the cp - odd higgs resonance ) .",
    "this implies that yukawa coupling of fermions to the higgs boson becomes an essential parameter in this calculation along with @xmath13 .",
    "the bottom yukawa coupling receives large susy corrections for large @xmath13 @xcite , which is another reason to incorporate radiative corrections in the predictions .",
    "the approximation used in @xcite is already included in the micromegas package alongside with the qcd corrections for higgs decays into fermions ( see @xcite ) .",
    ".the minimal supergravity ( msugra ) scenarios that lead to a neutralino relic density agreeing with the current limits of eq .",
    "( [ cwmap ] ) , satisfy the current susy - particle mass limits , and present important contributions of neutralino annihilation into bottom or top quark - antiquark pairs .",
    "we indicate the msugra parameters at the high scale , the relic density obtained with micromegas , and the contributions of the different quark final states to the annihilation cross - section @xmath7 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     ( 450,290)(0,0 ) ( 5,150 ) ( 155,152 ) ( 5,0 ) ( 155,2 ) ( 310,2 )",
    "we calculate the complete qcd and susy - qcd corrections not only to the higgs boson exchange but also to the @xmath14-channel z - boson exchange and the @xmath15-channel and @xmath16-channel squark exchange .",
    "we also include parts of the correction for the higgs exchange which are not treated in @xcite .",
    "we find that the additional correction when including the full one - loop radiative result are 10 - 15% relative to the corrections already included in micromegas .",
    "we present numerical results for four typical msugra parameter points shown in tab .",
    "[ tpoints ] .",
    "the high - scale parameters were evolved down to the electroweak scale using spheno @xcite and the neutralino relic density has been calculated with micromegas , where we have included our calculation of the annihilation cross section as discussed above . for each point , the relic density fulfills the limits ( [ cwmap ] ) and additionally , the branching ratio of the decay @xmath17 lies within the experimental limits @xmath18 obtained from combined measurements from babar , belle , and cleo @xcite .",
    "this limit leads to constraints on parameters connected to sfermions and gauginos .",
    "the selected points with a dominant bottom quark final state are either near the bulk region ( point 1 ) with low fermion mass parameter @xmath19 for low @xmath13 ( the scalar mass is rather large in order to avoid the constraint by @xmath20 ) or in the higgs - funnel region for large @xmath13 where our point 2 is positioned exactly on the cp - odd higgs resonance .",
    "both points 3 and 4 for which the top quark final state is important , lie in the focus point region where the scalar mass parameter @xmath21 is large . in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] we show the numerical results for the relevant annihilation cross section and the resulting neutralino relic density for the points presented in tab .  [ tpoints ] .",
    "we show the leading order result ( green dash - dotted ) , the approximation already implemented in micromegas ( red dashed ) , and the result including our full one - loop susy - qcd corrections ( blue solid ) . in the graphs showing the cross section ( left row )",
    "we also indicate the boltzmann distribution function involved in the calculation of the thermal average ( couloured area ) . as already stated above , the one - loop contributions that are not implemented in micromegas lead to an increase of about 10  15 % in the annihilation cross section both for bottom and top quark final states . in consequence ,",
    "the neutralino relic density decreases by about the same amount for the different points , as can be seen in the center and right panels showing the neutralino relic density as a function of the high - scale mass parameters @xmath19 and @xmath21 , respectively . for fixed values of @xmath13 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 ,",
    "the favoured band in the @xmath21-@xmath19 plane is shifted to lower gaugino masses and higher scalar masses ( focus point region ) .",
