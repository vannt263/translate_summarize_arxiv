    "the local density approximation ( lda ) , unlike most of the `` sophisticated '' density functional approximations in widespread use today , is truly a first - principles quantum mechanical method.@xcite it is entirely non - empirical , depending instead on the properties of one of the great paradigms of modern physics : the infinite homogeneous electron gas ( heg).@xcite application of the lda is straightforward , at least in principle .",
    "although the electronic charge density @xmath2 in any real system is non - uniform , the lda proceeds by assuming that the charge in an infinitesimal volume element around the point @xmath3 behaves like a locally homogeneous gas of density @xmath2 , and adds all of the resulting contributions together .",
    "this implicitly assumes that the infinitesimal contributions are independent ( which is undoubtedly not the case ) but then requires only that the properties of the heg be known for all values of @xmath4 .",
    "the density of a heg is commonly given by @xmath4 ( the number of electrons per unit volume ) or the seitz radius @xmath0 and these equivalent parameters are related by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the dimensionality of the space in which the electrons move . in terms of these",
    ", the lda correlation functional is @xmath7 where the correlation kernel @xmath8 is the reduced ( _ i.e. _  per electron ) correlation energy of the heg with seitz radius @xmath0 .    in high - density hegs ( _",
    "i.e. _  @xmath9 ) , the kinetic energy dominates the hamiltonian and the coulomb repulsion between the electrons can be treated via perturbation theory .",
    "this has facilitated investigations of @xmath8 in 3d@xcite and 2d@xcite but , because the coulomb operator is so strong in 1d that two electrons can not touch , the 1d gas has received less attention.@xcite    in low - density hegs ( _ i.e. _  @xmath10 ) , the potential energy dominates , the electrons localize into a wigner crystal and strong - coupling methods can be used to find asymptotic expansions of @xmath8 . here ,",
    "too , the 3d,@xcite 2d@xcite and 1d@xcite hegs have all been studied .    for intermediate densities ,",
    "the best estimates of @xmath8 come from quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) calculations , as pioneered by ceperley and refined by several other groups.@xcite by combining these with the high- and low - density results , various groups@xcite have constructed interpolating functions that allow @xmath8 to be estimated rapidly for any value of @xmath0 .",
    "unfortunately , this approach is flawed , for the correlation energy of a uniform electron gas depends on more than just its @xmath0 value.@xcite we have therefore argued that @xmath8 should be generalized to @xmath11 , where the parameter @xmath1 measures the _ two - electron _ density .",
    "although not mathematically mandated,@xcite we prefer that @xmath1 , like @xmath0 , be a _",
    "local _ quantity . in section [ sec : eta ]",
    ", we propose a definition for @xmath1 inspired by a number of previous researchers.@xcite    to learn more about the two - parameter kernel , we have turned to the finite uniform electron gases ( uegs ) formed when @xmath12 electrons are confined to a @xmath6-sphere.@xcite in section [ sec : ringium ] , we report accurate values of @xmath1 and @xmath11 for electrons on a 1-sphere , systems that we call `` @xmath12-ringium '' . in section [ sec : glda1 ] , we devise three functionals to approximate these results and in section [ sec : valid ] , we test two of these on small 1d systems .",
    "atomic units are used throughout .",
    "suppose that an electron lies at a point @xmath3 .",
    "the probability @xmath13 that a second electron lies at @xmath14 is given@xcite by the conditional intracule @xmath15 / 2}}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the spinless second - order density matrix.@xcite for fixed @xmath3 , we have the normalization @xmath17 because the laplacian @xmath18 measures the tightness of the hole around the electron at @xmath3 and has dimensions of @xmath19 , we can use the dimensionless hole curvature @xmath20 to measure the proximity of other electrons to one at @xmath3 . ( we will fix the coefficient @xmath21 in the next section . ) it is difficult to find this laplacian for the exact wave function but , at the hartree - fock ( hf ) level , it involves simple sums over the occupied orbitals , _ viz . _",
    "@xmath22 and we will therefore employ hf curvatures henceforth.[multiblock footnote omitted ] the interesting connection between the curvature and the kinetic energy density @xcite is worth noting .",
    "the hf orbitals of the ground state of @xmath12 electrons on a ring of radius @xmath23 are complex exponentials@xcite @xmath24 and , because of the symmetry of the system , the density and seitz radius @xmath25 do not depend on @xmath26 .",
    "the hole curvature is also constant and , using and , one finds @xmath27 if we choose @xmath28 so that @xmath29 for the 1d heg ( _ i.e. _  @xmath30-ringium ) , we obtain @xmath31 in general , requiring that @xmath29 in the @xmath6-dimensional heg leads ( via fermi integration ) to @xmath32 and the particular values @xmath33 and @xmath34 .      the hamiltonian for @xmath12 electrons on a ring is @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the distance ( across the ring ) between electrons @xmath37 and @xmath38 . as noted previously,@xcite the energy is independent of the spin - state and so we assume that all electrons are spin - up .",
    "the exact wave function can then be written as @xmath39 , where the correlation factor @xmath40 is a sum of functions @xmath41 which are @xmath42-term symmetric polynomials in the @xmath36 ( see table [ tab : fi ] ) and @xmath43 is the hf wave function@xcite @xmath44    .definitions @xmath41 and number of terms @xmath42 in the correlation factors of degree 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the convergence of the 5-hookium energies is shown in table [ tab : convhook ] . as in 5-boxium ,",
    "the lda1 energies converge most rapidly , followed by the hf and glda1 energies , then the @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 components of the third - order energy , and finally the mp2 energy .",
    "however , each of these energies converges significantly more slowly than its 5-boxium analog .",
    "all of these observations are consistent with the theoretical predictions of table [ tab : convergence ] . because the @xmath12-hookiums are smaller - gap systems , mp2 and mp3 are less successful than for @xmath12-boxium , recovering roughly 85% and 96% of the correlation energy in 5-hookium .    our best estimates of the cbs limit hf and",
    "correlation energies are summarized in the right half of table [ tab : apps ] .",
    "as before , whereas lda1 seriously overestimates the correlation energies , glda1 is within 15% of the true correlation energy in all cases .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xmath48(@xmath12-hookium)@xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath48(@xmath12-boxium)@xmath49 in all cases but that , whereas glda1 correctly predicts this trend , lda1 reverses it .",
    "the traditional local density approximation ( lda ) is exact by construction for an infinite uniform electron gas with seitz radius @xmath0 .",
    "however , it significantly overestimates the magnitudes of correlation energies in finite gases , such as those created when @xmath12 electrons are placed on the surface of a @xmath6-dimensional sphere .",
    "this overestimation , which becomes even more pronounced in non - uniform gases , led us to seek generalizations of the lda which are exact for both infinite and finite gases and , in the present work , we have proposed that the local hole curvature @xmath1 provides the necessary information to achieve this goal . for present purposes ,",
    "we have extracted @xmath1 from the hf wave function : this requires only the occupied hf orbitals .    by fitting accurately calculated correlation energies for systems of @xmath12 electrons on a ring ,",
    "we have constructed the generalized local density approximation for one - dimensional systems and this has yielded a correlation kernel @xmath11 and a corresponding functional which we call glda1 . to this point , we have considered only gases in which @xmath51 and , consequently , the glda1 functional is not yet defined for gases with higher curvature . however , if we assume that the the correlation kernel becomes flat , _",
    "i.e. _  that @xmath52 when @xmath53 , we obtain an approximation to glda1 which we call glda1 .",
    "we have applied the traditional lda1 functional and the curvature - corrected glda1 functional to electrons trapped in 1d boxes or in 1d harmonic wells and , by comparing the predicted correlation energies with those obtained from mp2 , mp3 and full ci calculations , we have discovered that glda1 is much more accurate than lda1 in all cases .",
    "we have also observed that glda1 tends to underestimate the magnitudes of correlation energies .",
    "this suggests that the true glda1 kernel continues to rise , _",
    "i.e. _  that @xmath54 but systematic examination of high - curvature ( @xmath53 ) gases is required to test this .",
    "such exploration is an important topic for future research and will allow the glda1 functional to be completely defined and tested .",
    "although we have presented relatively few calculations here , and much more investigation is warranted , these preliminary results suggest that `` curvature - corrected density functional theory ( cc - dft ) '' may offer an efficient pathway to improvements over existing functionals .",

    "the matrix elements in eq .   are expressed as expectation values of operators over the hf wave function . therefore , because @xmath55 and its reduced density matrices , _",
    "@xmath56 ^ 2 \\right)\\ ] ] have _ finite _ fourier expansions , integrals of their products with fourier expansions of operators reduce to _ finite _ sums .",
    "the fourier expansions of bounded operators on a unit ring are straightforward , _ e.g. _ @xmath57                                          \\left [ \\frac{4i}{\\pi } \\sum_{b=-\\infty}^\\infty \\frac{b e^{i b(\\theta_1-\\theta_3)}}{4b^2 - 1 } \\right ]    \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] the expansions of unbounded operators , _ e.g. _ @xmath58 are delicate ( they converge only in the cesro mean@xcite ) but this is sufficient for our purposes because we require only a few of the low - order fourier coefficients .",
    "the expansions of `` cyclic '' operators ( _ e.g. _  @xmath59 ) are not simple products and must be derived separately .    thus , for example , to find the @xmath60 integral in 3-ringium , the fourier expansion @xmath61 \\ , [ 2 - 2\\cos(\\theta_1-\\theta_3 ) ] \\ , [ 2 - 2\\cos(\\theta_2-\\theta_3 ) ] } { 3!(2\\pi)^3}\\ ] ] is combined with eq .   to yield @xmath62",
    "it is common these days to estimate the cbs limit of post - hf correlation energies by extrapolation.@xcite pioneering work by schwartz,@xcite hill@xcite and kutzelnigg and morgan@xcite showed that , for atoms in 3d , the second - order energy contributions from basis functions with angular momentum @xmath63 converge asymptotically as @xmath64 .    while generating the data in section [ sec : valid ] , we found that the mp2 and mp3 energies converge so slowly ( tables [ tab : convbox ] and [ tab : convhook ] ) that the cbs limit is not reached ( within our 0.1 @xmath65 target accuracy ) , even with our largest ( @xmath66 ) basis set",
    "this is particularly noticeable for @xmath12-hookium .",
    "we therefore needed to develop and apply appropriate extrapolation procedures .    to this end , we analyzed the convergence of the second - order energy @xmath67 obtained from the non - interacting orbitals and orbital energies in 2-boxium and 2-hookium .",
    "in @xmath12-hookium , the double - bar integral is @xmath68 if @xmath69 is odd but it vanishes if @xmath69 is even .",
    "the orbital energies are given by @xmath70 . by substituting these expressions into and making use of stirling s approximation,@xcite",
    "one can show that the error introduced by truncating the basis after @xmath71 functions is @xmath72 the closed - form expression for the @xmath73 integral in @xmath12-boxium is cumbersome but a similar analysis reveals that the analogous truncation error is @xmath74 .",
    "the truncation errors in the third - order energy can be found in the same way and all of our results are summarized in table [ tab : convergence ] .",
    "the mp2 , mp3 and fci energies obtained with our largest basis sets conform to these analytical predictions and allowed us to extrapolate reliably to the cbs energies given in table [ tab : apps ] .",
    "the good agreement between our extrapolated fci energies and qmc energies further increases our confidence in these results .",
