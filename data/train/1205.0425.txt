    "the emergence and antagonism of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic ground states in strongly correlated electron systems has always been considered to be of prime importance for a thorough understanding of the magnetic states in narrow band systems such as the transition metal oxides . in a large number of cases the nature of the magnetic coupling",
    "is successfully predicted by appropriate spin - orbital models .",
    "formally the magnetic coupling results from second order expansion in some hopping amplitude parameter @xmath0 , and therefore applies to systems in the strong coupling regime with strong on - site coulomb interaction @xmath1 ( with respect to the kinetic energy @xmath0 , i.e. , @xmath2 ) . in that case",
    "spin - orbital models provide a framework to analyze a wealth of properties ( for a recent reference see ole _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "nevertheless , many systems are rather tracked down to be in the intermediate coupling regime , where , for example , phase transitions between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases can take place ( see , e.  g. , @xcite ) .",
    "such situations are not covered by the standard spin - orbital models , and higher orders in the expansion in @xmath0 are needed .",
    "unfortunately this often implies to take nearly degenerate states into account .",
    "in fact , the determination of the magnetic coupling of nearly degenerate states beyond second order perturbation theory has been rarely addressed in solid state physics .",
    "our paper aims at filling this gap .    whereas small clusters with few electronic states",
    "can be exactly diagonalized to characterize the electronic state , larger clusters with millions of states require different approaches .",
    "already a cluster of three transition metal ions ( with six @xmath3 electrons per site ) and two oxygen ions provides more than 600 thousand low energy states which are nearly degenerate . to be explicit",
    ", this challenge is encountered in the quasi-1d mott - insulator ca@xmath4co@xmath5o@xmath6 , when effective interaction parameters are calculated from a minimal cluster of three co sites ( only counting the @xmath7 states ) and two o ligand sites ( exclusively considering @xmath8 states ) , and a microscopic analysis of the dominant ferromagnetic coupling between high - spin next - nearest neighbor co@xmath9 sites has not yet included all low - energy states . in such a system",
    "one would have to implement a perturbation theory of at least 5@xmath10 order ( due to the necessity to include ring exchange ) .",
    "moreover , an adequate perturbation theory should be fully qualified to cope with a large number of nearly degenerate states in the low energy sector .",
    "such a situation with several or many nearly degenerate low energy states , which are separated by a large energy scale @xmath1 from the high energy sector , is typical for multi - band transition metal oxides and the question arises if well established perturbation theories are available with which electronic systems with _ almost _ or _",
    "nearly degenerate ground states _ can be reliably handled  @xcite .",
    "schemes for the implementation of a perturbation theory with _ degenerate _ states in the low energy sector have been known for a long time and are well presented in textbooks on quantum mechanics and review articles ( e.g. , see the refs .",
    "the extension to _ almost degenerate _",
    "states seems to be straightforward with either of two alternative procedures : ( i ) one formally assigns a degenerate `` unperturbed '' hamiltonian to those eigenstates which are nearly degenerate  @xcite .",
    "the perturbation expansion is then set up with respect to this artificially constructed , unperturbed degenerate hamiltonian with the perturbation being comprised of the terms which lift the degeneracy and the original perturbation terms which connect to the high energy sector .",
    "this scheme , which introduces an artificial degeneracy , is in general not physically motivated and may produce inferior convergence as we will demonstrate in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] .",
    "( ii ) alternatively , one first diagonalizes the unperturbed hamiltonian jointly with that part of the perturbation which can be projected onto the low energy sector of the hilbert space ( in which the degenerate and almost degenerate states live ) .",
    "the part of the perturbation which connects to the high energy sector can then be treated in standard perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "however this latter scheme is valid only up to third order where intermediate states in this scheme are exclusively states from the high energy sector . in fourth",
    "order , this scheme breaks down because intermediate states are then in turn allowed to be taken from the low energy sector .",
    "we will shortly introduce this procedure in the following section .",
    "the standard argument implicates the expectation that the degeneracy or near degeneracy is lifted in second order of perturbation theory .",
    "however this is extremely implausible for thousands of nearly degenerate states .    a generalization of scheme ( ii )",
    "actually exists which extends its validity to all orders of the perturbation theory .",
    "this generalization , introduced by brandow in a review article  @xcite , is a brillouin - wigner ( bw ) type of perturbation theory , which requires to calculate the system energies self - consistently  @xcite .",
    "this self - consistency implies that bw expansions do not scale properly with the particle number in any finite order which can impede their use in solid state physics .",
    "a considerable number of perturbation techniques for nearly degenerate states were developed for purposes specific to quantum chemistry .",
    "here we focus on a perturbation expansion which was developed by lindgren  @xcite .",
    "it is of rayleigh - schrdinger ( rs ) type and can handle multi - particle problems with nearly degenerate ground states . from the formal structure it is more demanding than a bw expansion but it obeys the linked cluster theorem  @xcite and the correct particle number scaling without adjustments .    to our knowledge , neither the bw - scheme of brandow nor the rs - scheme of lindgren were used extensively in solid state physics in order to solve electronic problems with nearly degenerate states . in this context",
    ", it is of particular interest if these schemes can be employed effectively to investigate magnetic states of strongly correlated electron systems .",
    "especially , can we reliably gain magnetic coupling constants if there is a competition between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic correlations and only higher orders in perturbation theory can settle the sign of the coupling ?    in the following section ( sec .  [ sec:2 ] ) ,",
    "we first introduce the concept of `` nearly degenerate perturbation theory '' and then present the schemes of brandow and lindgren for the generalization of bw and rs perturbation theory , respectively . as already mentioned , these schemes were little used in solid state physics and it is worthwhile to review the basics . in order to reassess their applicability in this context , we employ in sec .",

    "the brandow scheme becomes exact in second order if the subspace of low - energy states @xmath25 is appropriately chosen .",
    "however , this property of the brandow perturbation expansion is particular for the considered model and will generally not persist for larger systems .",
    "as to the formal structure , the lindgren rayleigh - schrdinger expansion is more demanding but it obeys the linked cluster theorem in each order of the expansion which implies the correct particle - number scaling .",
