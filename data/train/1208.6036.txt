    "conventional models of epidemic spread consider a host population of identical individuals , each interacting in the same way with each of the others ( see @xcite and references therein ) . at the same time , in order to develop more realistic mathematical models for the spread of infectious diseases , it is important to obtain the best possible representation of the corresponding transmission mechanism . to achieve this ,",
    "more recent models have included some of the many complexities that have been observed in mixing patterns .",
    "one such approach consists in splitting the population into a set of different subgroups , each with different social behaviours . even more detail",
    "is included within network approaches , which allow to include differences between individuals , not just between sub - populations . in such models ,",
    "each individual is represented as a node , and interactions that could permit the transmission of infection appear as edges linking nodes .",
    "the last decade has seen a substantial increase in the research of how infectious diseases are spread over large networks of connected nodes , where networks themselves can represent either small social contact networks or larger scale travel networks , including global aviation networks @xcite . importantly , the characteristics of the network , such as the average degree and the node degree distribution have a profound effect on the dynamics of the infectious disease spread , and hence significant efforts are made to capture properties of realistic contact networks .",
    "network models provide an intuitively appealing way to consider the social structure of populations , but they bring with them the challenge of collecting sufficient data to parameterise them fully .",
    "ideally , an entire population would be sampled and all relevant interactions measured in order to reconstruct the contact network , but this is , unsurprisingly , seldom possible , and it is generally necessary to make suitable approximations . with the advance of computer - based tracking , statistical properties of many realistic networks ( e.g. mobile phone calls ) have been studied in great detail , and these are often used as proxy for the analysis of epidemic dynamics @xcite .",
    "one of the simplifying assumptions often put into models on networks is that all links are equally likely to transmit infection @xcite .",
    "however , a more detailed consideration leads to an observation that this is often not the case , as some links are likely to be far more capable of transmitting infection than others due to closer contacts ( e.g. within households @xcite ) or long - duration interactions @xcite . to account for this heterogeneity in properties of social interactions ,",
    "network models can be adapted , thus resulting in _ weighted contact networks _ , where connections between different nodes have different weights .",
    "these weights may be associated with the duration , proximity , or social setting of the interaction , and the key point is that they are expected to be correlated with the risk of disease transmission .",
    "the precise relationship between the properties of an interaction and its riskiness is hugely complex ; here , we will consider aweight \" that is exactly proportional to the transmission rate along a link . from a general perspective , one can consider two types of weighted networks : symmetric networks , where the strength only varies between different edges but is the same for a given pair of connected nodes , or go one step further and allow for the strength to be different even for the same pair of connected nodes @xmath7 and @xmath8 , depending on whether @xmath7 infects @xmath8 , or @xmath8 infects @xmath7 .",
    "the first type of networks can be efficiently conceived as undirected graphs represented by symmetric connection matrices , while for the second one it is necessary to consider the contact network as a directed graph , resulting in a connection matrix , which in general is non - symmetric .",
    "although consideration of weighted networks may seem as an additional complication for the analysis of epidemic dynamics , in fact it provides a much more realistic representation of actual contact networks .",
    "early models of weighted networks arose in the context of identifying genetic and metabolic networks @xcite .",
    "later on , they found applications in a number of diverse research areas , such as international trade networks @xcite , scientific collaboration networks @xcite , aviation networks of individual countries @xcite or global aviation networks @xcite and networks of mobile phone communications @xcite .",
    "@xcite started a systematic study of evolving networks with nonbinary connectivities by considering growing weighted and exponential networks .",
    "this approach was later developed into a generic formalism for the analysis of evolving weighted networks @xcite .",

    "substantial amount of work has been done on the analysis of scale - free networks with different types of weight distribution @xcite .",

    "@xcite analysed a model on weighted scale - free networks and found that heterogeneity in weight distribution leads to a slowdown in the spread of epidemics .",
    "furthermore , they have shown that for a given network topology and mean infectivity , epidemics spread fastest in unweighted networks .",
    "@xcite have investigated the dynamics of an @xmath9 model on weighted scale - free networks with community structure and showed that the contribution coming from weights of edges connecting different communities exceeds the impact of weights on edges inside communities .",
    "_ @xcite have studied mean - field and finite - size scaling in weighted networks with small weights on edges connecting high - degree nodes .",
    "_ @xcite have shown that disease prevalence can be maximized when the edge weights are chosen to be inversely proportional to the degrees of receiving nodes but , in this case , the transmissibility was not directly proportional to the weights and weights were also asymmetric",
    ". yang & zhou @xcite have considered @xmath0 epidemics on homogeneous networks with uniform or power - law edge weight distribution and shown how to derive a certain type of mean - field description for such models .",
    "_ @xcite have derived an expression for the basic reproductive ratio in weighted networks with generic distributions of node degree and weights , and deijfen @xcite has performed a similar analysis to study vaccination in such networks . in terms of practical epidemiological applications , weighted networks",
    "have already been effectively used to study control of global pandemics @xcite and the spread of animal disease due to cattle movement between farms @xcite .",
    "eames _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have considered an @xmath1 model on an undirected weighted network , where rather than using some theoretical formalism to generate an idealized network , the authors have relied on social mixing data obtained from questionnaires completed by members of a peer group @xcite to construct a realistic weighted network .",
    "having analysed the dynamics of epidemic spread in a such a network , they showed how information about node - specific infection risk can be used to develop targeted preventative vaccination strategies .",
    "as an alternative approach to modelling heterogeneity in network interactions , eames @xcite has considered a network with two types of contacts : random and regular , where the first type refers to arbitrary connections with any node in the network , while the second type designates multiple repeated contacts with the same nodes .",
    "he showed that in a highly clustered population , random contacts allow infection to reach otherwise inaccessible parts of the network , while in the case of all contacts being regular , clustering leads to a significant reduction in the spread of infection .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the dynamics of an infectious disease spreading on weighted networks with different weight distributions . since we are primarily concerned with the effects of weight distribution on the disease dynamics , the connection matrix will be assumed to be symmetric , representing the situation when the weights can only be different for different network edges , but for a given edge the weight is the same irrespective of the direction of infection . from epidemiological perspective , we consider both the case when the disease confers permanent immunity ( represented by an @xmath1 model ) , and the case when the immunity is short - lived , and upon recovery the individuals return to the class of susceptibles ( @xmath0 model ) . for both of these cases",
    "we derive the corresponding ode - based pairwise models and their closure approximations .",
    "numerical simulation of both the network dynamics and the pairwise approximations are performed .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in the next section , the construction of specific weighted networks to be used for analysis of epidemic dynamics",
    "is discussed .",
    "this is complemented by the derivation of corresponding pairwise models and their closure approximations .",
    "section 3 contains the derivation of the basic reproductive ratio @xmath2 for the @xmath1 model and for different weight distributions as well as numerical simulation of both network models and their pairwise ode counterparts .",
    "the paper concludes in section 4 with discussion of results and possible further extensions of this work .",
    "there are two conceptually different approaches to constructing weighted networks for modelling infectious disease spread . in the first approach",
    ", there is a seed or a primitive motif , and the network is then grown or evolved from this initial seed according to some specific rules . in this method ,",
    "the topology of the network is co - evolving with the distribution of weights on the edges @xcite .",
    "another approach is to consider a weighted network as a superposition of an unweighted network with a distribution of weights across edges which could independent of the original network or it may be correlated with node metrics , such as their degree , @xcite . in this paper",
    "we use the second approach in order to investigate the particular role played by the distribution of weights across edges , rather than network topology , in the dynamics of epidemic spread . besides computational efficiency",
    ", this will allow us to make some analytical headway in deriving and analysing low - dimensional pairwise models which are likely to perform better when weights are attached according to the scenarios described above .",
    "here we consider two different methods of assigning weights to network links : a network in which weights are assigned to links at random , and a network in which each node has the same distribution of weighted links connected to it . in reality",
    ", there is likely to be a great deal more structure to interaction weights , but in the absence of precise data and also for the purposes of developing models that allow one to explore a number of different assumptions , we make these simplifying approximations .",
    "first we consider a simple model of an undirected weighted network with @xmath10 nodes where the weights of the links can take values @xmath11 with probability @xmath12 , where @xmath13 .",
    "the underlying degree distribution of the corresponding unweighted network can be chosen to be of the more basic forms , e.g. homogeneous random or erds - rnyi - type random networks .",
    "the generation of such networks is straightforward , and weights can be assigned during link creation in the unweighted network .",
    "for example , upon using the configuration model for generating unweighted networks , each new link will have a weight assigned to it based on the chosen weight distribution .",
    "this means that in a homogeneous random network with each node having @xmath14 links , the distribution of link weights of different type will be multinomial , and it is given by @xmath15 where , @xmath16 and @xmath17 stands for the probability of a node having @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 links with weights @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath20 , @xmath24 , respectively . while the above expression is applicable in the most general set - up , it is worth considering the case of weights of only two types , where the distribution of link weights for a homogenous random network becomes binomial @xmath25 where , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the average link weight in the model above can be easily found as @xmath28 which for the case of weights of two types @xmath22 and @xmath23 reduces to @xmath29      as a second example we consider a network , in which each node has @xmath30 links with weight @xmath11 ( @xmath31 ) , where @xmath32 . the different weights here could be interpreted as being associated with different types of social interaction : e.g. home , workplace , and leisure contacts , or physical and non - physical interactions . in this model",
    "all individuals are identical in terms of their connections , not only having the same number of links ( as in the model above ) but also having the same set of weights . the average weight in such a model is given by @xmath33 where @xmath12 is the fraction of links of type @xmath34 for each node .",
    "in the case of links of two types with weights @xmath22 and @xmath23 , the average weight becomes @xmath35      in this study , the simple @xmath0 and @xmath1 epidemic models are considered .",
    "the epidemic dynamics is specified in terms of infection and recovery events .",
    "the rate of transmission across an unweighted edge between an infected and susceptible individual is denoted by @xmath36 .",
    "this will then be adjusted by the weight of the link which is assumed to be directly proportional to the strength of the transmission along that link .",
    "infected individuals recover independently of each other at rate @xmath37 .",
    "the simulation is implemented using gillespie algorithm @xcite with inter - event times distributed exponentially with a rate given by the total rate of change in the network , with the single event to be implemented at each step being chosen at random and proportionally to its rate .",
    "all simulations start with most nodes being susceptible and with a few infected nodes chosen at random .      in this section",
    "we extend the classic pairwise model for unweighted networks @xcite to the case of weighted graphs with @xmath38 different link - weight types .",
    "pairwise models successfully interpolate between classic compartmental ode models and full individual - based network simulation with the added advantage of high transparency and a good degree of analytical tractability .",
    "these qualities makes them an ideal tool for studying dynamical processes on networks @xcite , and they can be used on their own and/or in parallel with simulation .",
    "the original versions of the pairwise models have been successfully extended to networks with heterogenous degree distribution @xcite , asymmetric networks @xcite and situations where transmission happens across different / combined routes @xcite as well as when taking into consideration network motifs of higher order than pairs and triangles @xcite .",
    "the extension that we propose is based on the previously established precise counting procedure at the level of individuals , pairs and triples , as well as on a careful and systematic account of all possible transitions needed to derive the full set of evolution equations for singles and pairs .",
    "these obviously involve the precise dependency of lower order moments on higher order ones , e.g. the rate of change of the expected number of susceptible nodes is proportional to the expected number of links between a susceptible and infected node .",
    "we extend the previously well - established notation @xcite to account for the added level of complexity due to different link weights .",
    "in line with this , the number of singles remains unchanged , with @xmath39 $ ] denoting the number of nodes across the whole network in state @xmath7 .",
    "pairs of type @xmath40 , @xmath41 $ ] , are now broken down depending on link weights , i.e. @xmath41_{i}$ ] represents the number of links of type @xmath40 with the link having weight @xmath11 , where as before @xmath31 and @xmath42 if an @xmath1 dynamics is used . as before ,",
    "links are doubly counted ( e.g. in both directions ) and thus the following relations hold : @xmath41_m=[ba]_m$ ] and @xmath43_m$ ] is equal to twice the number of uniquely counted links of weight @xmath44 with nodes at both ends in state @xmath7 . from this extension",
    "it follows that @xmath45_i=[ab]$ ] .",
    "the same convention holds at the level of triples where @xmath46_{mn}$ ] stands for the expected number of triples where a node in state @xmath8 connects a node in state @xmath7 and @xmath47 via links of weight @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "the weight of the link impacts on the rate of transmission across that link , and this is achieved by using a link - specific transmission rate equal to @xmath50 , where @xmath31 . in line with the above , we construct two pairwise models , one for @xmath0 and one for @xmath1 dynamics .    the pairwise model for the @xmath0 dynamics can be written in the form : @xmath51=\\gamma{[i]}-\\tau{\\sum_{n=1}^m { w_{n}}{[si]_{n}}},\\\\\\\\ \\ [ \\dot{i}]=\\tau{\\sum_{n=1}^m { w_{n}}{[si]_{n}}}-\\gamma{[i]},\\\\\\\\ \\ [ \\dot{si}]_{m}= \\gamma{([ii]_{m}-[si]_{m})}+\\tau{\\sum_{n=1}^m { w_{n}}{([ssi]_{mn}-[isi]_{nm})}}-\\tau{w_{m}}{[si]_{m}},\\\\\\\\ \\ [ \\dot{ii}]_{m}= -2{\\gamma{[ii]_{m}}}+2{\\tau}{\\sum_{n=1}^m w_{n}{[isi]_{nm}}}+2{\\tau}{w_{m}}{[si]_{m}},\\\\\\\\ \\ [ \\dot{ss}]_{m}= 2{\\gamma{[si]_{m}}}-2{\\tau{\\sum_{n=1}^m w_{n}{[ssi]_{mn } } } } , \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 and @xmath41_{m}$ ] denotes the expected number of links with weight @xmath48 connecting two nodes of type @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively ( @xmath53 ) .    in the case",

    "the above systems of equations ( [ sis ] ) and ( [ sir ] ) are not closed , as equations for the pairs require knowledge of triples , and thus , equations for triples are needed .",
    "this dependency on higher - order moments can be curtailed by closing the equations via approximating triples in terms of singles and pairs @xcite . for both systems , the agreement with simulation will heavily depend on the precise distribution of weights across the links , the network topology , and the type of closures that will be used to capture essential features of network structure and the weight distribution . as a check and a reference back to previous model , in appendix",
    "a shows how systems ( [ sis ] ) and ( [ sir ] ) reduce to the standard unweighted pairwise @xmath0 and @xmath1 models @xcite when all weights are equal to each other , @xmath55 .",
    "the most natural extension of the classic closure is given by @xmath56_{mn}=\\frac{k-1}{k}\\frac{[ab]_m[bc]_n}{[b]},\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the number of links per node for a homogeneous natwork or the average nodal degree for networks with other than homogenous degree distributions .",
    "even for the simplest case of homogenous random networks with two weights , a different version of the closure can be derived .",
    "the starting point for this different closure is the observation that the average number of links of weight @xmath22 across the whole network is @xmath57 , and similarly , the average number of links of weight @xmath23 is @xmath58 .",

    "the basic reproductive ratio , @xmath2 ( the average number of secondary cases produced by a typical index case in an otherwise susceptible population ) , is one of the most fundamental quantities in epidemiology ( @xcite ) . besides informing us on whether a particular disease will spread in a population , as well as quantifying the severity of an epidemic outbreak",
    ", it can be also used to calculate a number of other important quantities that have good intuitive interpretation . in what follows",
    ", we will compute @xmath2 and @xmath2-like quantities and will discuss their relation to each other , and also issues around these being model - dependent .",

    "using the fact that @xmath67 , the basic reproductive ratio can be found from the leading eigenvalue of the @xmath68 matrix as follows @xmath69 in fact , the expression for @xmath3 can be simply generalised to more than two weights to give @xmath70 , where @xmath44 has frequency given by @xmath71 with the constraint that @xmath72 .",

    "it is worth noting that both @xmath2 values reduce to @xmath84 if one assumes that weights are equal , i.e. @xmath85 . as one would expect , the first good indicator of the impact of weights on the epidemic dynamics will be the average weight .",

    "this , however , does not preclude the possibility of having a network with random weight distribution with smaller average weight exhibiting an @xmath2 value that it is bigger than the @xmath2 value corresponding to a network where weights are fixed and the average weight is higher .",
    "the direct implication is that it is not sufficient to know just the average link weight in order to draw conclusions about possible epidemic outbreaks on weighted networks ; rather one has to know the precise weight distribution that provides a given average weight .",
    "figure  [ rzero ] shows how the basic reproductive ratio changes with the transmission rate @xmath36 for different weight distributions .",
    "when links on a homogeneous network are distributed at random , the increase in the magnitude of one specific link weight ( e.g. @xmath22 ) accompanied by a decrease in its frequency leads to smaller @xmath2 values .",
    "this is to be expected since the contribution of the different link types in this case is kept constant ( @xmath96 ) and this implies that the overall weight of the network links accumulates in a small number of highly weighted links with most links displaying small weights and thus making transmission less likely .",
    "the statement above is more rigorously underpinned by the results of theorem 1 & 2 which clearly show that equal or more homogeneous weights lead to higher values of the basic reproductive ratio . for the case of fixed weight distribution",
    ", the changes in the value of @xmath2 are investigated in terms of varying the weights , so that overall weight in the network remains constant .",
    "this is constrained by fixing values of @xmath92 and @xmath94 and , in this case , the highest values are obtained for higher values of @xmath22 .",
    "the flexibility here is reduced due to @xmath92 and @xmath94 being fixed , and a different link breakdown may lead to different observations . the top continuous line in fig .",
    "[ rzero ] corresponds to the maximum @xmath2 value achievable for both models if the @xmath97 constraint is fulfilled .",
    "to compute the value of @xmath2-like quantity from the pairwise model , we use the approach suggested by keeling @xcite , which utilises the local spatial / network structure and correctly accounts for correlations between susceptible and infectious nodes early on in the epidemics .",

    "it is straightforward to show that for equal weights , say @xmath111 , the expression above reduces to @xmath112 which is in line with @xmath3 value in @xcite for unclustered , homogeneous networks . under the assumption of a fixed total weight @xmath111",
    ", one can show that similarly to the network - based basic reproductive ratio , @xmath102 achieves its maximum when @xmath85 . in a similar way , for the modified closure ( [ clos ] )",
    ", we can use the same methodology to derive the threshold quantity as @xmath113 where @xmath114 for this closure once again , @xmath109 results in an epidemic , while for @xmath110 , the disease dies out .",
    "details of this calculations are shown in appendix d. it is noteworthy that one can derive expressions ( [ rtype1 ] ) and ( [ rtype2 ] ) by considering the leading eigenvalue of linearization of system ( [ sir ] ) near its disease - free steady state with the corresponding pairwise closures given in ( [ clos_cl ] ) and ( [ clos ] ) .    finally , we note that this seemingly @xmath2-lookalike , @xmath112 for the equal weights case @xmath85 is a multiple of @xmath115 as opposed to @xmath116 as is the case for the @xmath2 derived based on the individual - based perspective , where , for equal weights , @xmath117 .",
    "this obviously highlights the strong dependency of @xmath2 on the modelling framework and also the difficulty in trying to reconcile findings based on different models .      to evaluate the efficiency of the pairwise approximation models",

    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , where excellent agreement between simulation and pairwise models is obtained .",
    "the agreement remains valid for both @xmath0 and @xmath1 dynamics , and networks with higher average link weight lead to higher prevalence levels at equilibrium for @xmath0 and higher infectiousness peaks for @xmath1 .",
    "next , we explore the impact of weight distribution under the condition that the average weight remains constant ( i.e. @xmath97 , where without loss of generality the average weight has been chosen to be equal to 1 ) .",
    "first , we keep the proportion of edges of type one ( i.e. with weight @xmath22 ) fixed and change the weight itself by gradually increasing its magnitude . due to the constraint on the average weight and the condition @xmath67 , the other descriptors of the weight distribution follow .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows that concentrating a large portion of the total weight on a few links leads to smaller epidemics , since the majority of links are low - weight and thus have a small potential to transmit the disease .",
    "this effect is exacerbated for the highest value of @xmath22 ; in this case @xmath118 of the links are of weight @xmath119 leading to epidemics of smallest impact ( fig .  [ fig3](a ) ) and smallest size of outbreak ( fig .  [ fig3](b ) ) .",
    "while the previous setup kept the frequency of links constant while changing the weights , one can also investigate the impact of keeping at least one of the weights constant ( e.g. the larger one ) and changing its frequency . to ensure a fair comparison , here we also require that the average link weight over the whole network is kept constant .",
    "when such highly weighted links are rare , the system approaches the non - weighted network limit where the transmission rate is simply scaled by @xmath23 ( the most abundant link type ) . as fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows , in this case , the agreement is excellent , and as the frequency of the highly weighted edges / links increases , disease transmission is less severe",
    ".    regarding the comparison of the pairwise and simulation models , we note that while the agreement is generally good for a large part of the disease and weight parameter space , the more extreme scenarios of weight distribution result in poorer agreement .",
    "this is illustrated in both figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] ( see bottom curves ) , with the worst agreement for the @xmath0 dynamics .",
    "the insets in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] show that increasing the average connectivity improves the agreement . however , the cause of disagreement is due to a more subtle effect driven also by the weight distribution .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , the average degree in the network is @xmath120 , higher then used previously and equal to that in the insets from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , but despite this , the agreement is still poor .",
    "the two different weighted network models are compared in fig .",
    "this is done be using the same link weights and setting @xmath78 and @xmath79 . epidemics on network with random weight distribution grow faster and , given the same time scales of the epidemic , this is line with results derived in theorem 1 & 2 and findings concerning the growth rates .",
    "the difference is less marked for larger values of @xmath36 where a significant proportion of the nodes becomes infected .    in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] the link weight composition is altered by decreasing the proportion of highly - weighted links .",
    "as expected , the reduced average link weight across the network leads to epidemics of smaller size while keeping the excellent agreement between simulation and pairwise model results .",
    "the present study has explored the impact of weight heterogeneity and highlighted that the added heterogeneity of link weights does not manifest itself in the same way as most other heterogeneities in epidemic models on networks .",
    "usually , heterogeneities lead to an increase in @xmath2 but potentially for final size to fall . however , for weighted networks the concentration of infectiousness on fewer target link , and thus target individuals , leads to a fall in @xmath2 for both homogeneous random and fixed weight distribution models . increased heterogeneity in weights accentuates the locality of contact and is taking the model further from the mass - action type models .",
    "infection is concentrated along a smaller number of links , which results in wasted infectivity and lower @xmath2 .",
    "this is in line with similar results @xcite where different modelling approaches have been used to capture epidemics on weighted networks .",
    "the models proposed in this paper are simple mechanistic models with basic weight distributions , but despite this they provide a good basis for analysing disease dynamics on weighted networks in a rigorous and systematic way .",
    "the modified pairwise models have performed well , and provide good approximation to direct simulation . as expected , the agreement with simulations typically breaks down at or close to the threshold , but away from it , pairwise models provide a good counterpart or alternative to simulation .",
    "disagreement only appears for extreme weight distributions , and we hypothesise that this is mainly due to the network becoming more modular with islands of nodes connected by links of low weight being bridged together by highly weighted links . a good analogy to this",
    "is provided by considering the case of a pairwise model on unweighted networks specified in terms of two network metrics , node number @xmath10 and average number of links @xmath14 .",
    "the validity of the pairwise model relies on the network being connected up at random , or according to the configuration model .",
    "this can be easily broken by creating two sub - networks of equal size both exhibiting the same average connectivity .",
    "simulations on such type of networks will not agree with the pairwise model , and highlights that the network generating algorithm can push the network out of the set of ` acceptable ' networks .",
    "we expect that this or similar argument can more precisely explain why the agreement breaks down for significant link - weight heterogeneity .    the usefulness of pairwise models is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ kostia ] , where the @xmath121 values are plotted for a range of @xmath36 values and for different weight distributions . here",
    ", the equilibrium value has been computed by finding the steady state directly from the odes ( [ sis ] ) by finding numerically the steady state solution of a set on nonlinear equations ( i.e. @xmath122}=0 $ ] and @xmath123}=0 $ ] ) . to test the validity ,",
    "the long term solution of the ode is plotted along with results based on simulation .",
    "the agreement away from the threshold is excellent and illustrates clearly the impact of different weight distributions on the magnitude of the endemic threshold .",
    "the models proposed here can be extended in a number of different ways .",
    "one potential avenue for further research is the analysis of correlations between link weight and node degree .",
    "this direction has been explored but in the context of classic compartmental mean - field models based on node degree @xcite . given that pairwise models extend to heterogeneous networks",
    "such avenues can be further explored to include different type of correlations or other network dependent weight distributions .",
    "while this is a viable direction , it is expected that the extra complexity will make the pairwise models more difficult to analyse and disagreement between pairwise and simulation model more likely .",
    "another theoretically interesting and practically important aspect is the consideration of different types of time delays , representing latency or temporary immunity @xcite , and the analysis of their effects on the dynamics of epidemics on weighted networks .",
    "the methodology presented in this paper can be of wider relevance to studies of other natural phenomena where overlay networks provide effective description .",
    "examples of such systems include the simultaneous spread of two different diseases in the same population @xcite , the spread of the same disease but via different routes @xcite or the spread of epidemics concurrently with information about the disease @xcite .",
    "these areas offer other important avenues for further extensions .",
