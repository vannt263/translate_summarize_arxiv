    "cdf collaboration performed various measurements on inclusive diffraction and exclusive production using @xmath0 collision data from the fermilab tevatron collider collected in run i ( 19921996 ) and run ii ( 2001 ) .",
    "one of the important results from the run i studies is the observation of the qcd factorization breakdown in hard single diffractive ( sd ) processes  @xcite ; the rate of hard sd processes , in which one of the incoming proton or antiproton is scattered quasielastically and a hard partonic scattering ( such as dijet production ) occurs , was found to be lower than theoretical predictions by a factor of @xmath1 . in @xcite , the diffractive structure function @xmath2 was measured using sd dijet events and found to be suppressed with respect to the one measured in @xmath3 collisions at hera by @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the fractional momentum loss of the diffracted ( anti)proton and @xmath6 is the four - momentum transfer squared .",
    "this suppression is similar to the one observed in soft diffractive processes with respect to the regge theory predictions , and is generally attributed to additional color exchanges in the same @xmath0 collision which spoil the diffractive rapidity gap  @xcite .",
    "another important result from the run i diffractive studies is from a study on @xmath7 using double pomeron exchange ( dpe ) dijet events  @xcite , @xmath8 .",
    "the diffractive structure function @xmath7 measured in dpe dijet events was found to be approximately equal to expectations from hera .",
    "this observation is consistent with the expectations from , _",
    "e.g. _ , the gap probability renormalization model  @xcite .",
    "the main goal of the run ii diffractive studies is to study the characteristics of diffractive events more in detail with help of the upgraded detectors and larger statistics in order to deepen our understanding of diffractive exchange and the qcd nature of the pomeron .",
    "in addition , there has been an increased interest in studies on _ exclusive _ events , mainly due to a possibility of finding the higgs boson in exclusive events at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) . exclusive events in @xmath9 ( @xmath0 ) collisions contain nothing but the leading proton and ( anti)proton and the object(s ) of interest such as dijet , diphoton , dielectron , and most importantly the higgs boson , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : excl_jj_feynman ] . we do not expect to observe the exclusive higgs production at the tevatron ; however , we can study other exclusive processes that can provide a calibration for theoretical predictions of exclusive higgs production at the lhc .    the recent run ii studies on hard diffraction and exclusive dijet production are presented below .",
    "studies on exclusive dilepton , diphoton , and charmonium states are presented in  @xcite .",
    "the diffractive structure function @xmath7 was studied using run ii sd dijet data using a similar way to that used in run i studies  @xcite , _ i.e. _ , by taking a ratio of sd to non - diffractive ( nd ) dijet rates as a function of @xmath10 , which is in leading - order qcd approximately equal to the ratio of diffractive to nd structure function .",
    "one of the major challenges in run ii diffractive studies is the rejection of multiple @xmath0 interaction events , in which diffractive rapidity gaps are spoiled by overlapping @xmath0 interactions ( overlaps ) and the hard scattering can not be associated with the diffracted leading ( anti)proton accurately .",
    "this rejection was done by reconstructing @xmath5 from the calorimeter towers by @xmath11 ; @xmath12 in sd events without overlaps , while @xmath13 in events with overlaps , where @xmath14 refers to the @xmath5 value reconstructed based on the information from the roman pot ( rp ) detector which detects the diffracted antiproton .",
    "the high statistics run ii data allowed the sd / nd dijet ratio measurement in @xmath15 up to @xmath16 gev@xmath17 , and no appreciable @xmath15 dependence was observed .",
    "also in the run ii study , the @xmath6 distribution in sd dijet events was measured up to @xmath18 gev@xmath17 , and no dependence of the shape of the @xmath6 distribution on @xmath15 was found .",
    "cdf studied diffractive @xmath19 production using the run ii data recently .",
    "the study of diffractive @xmath19 production is important to determine the quark content of the pomeron ; the production by gluons is suppressed by a factor of @xmath20 and it can also be identified by an additional jet .    in run",
    "i , cdf studied diffractive @xmath21 production by identifying diffractive events using rapidity gaps  @xcite , and found the fraction of @xmath21 events which are diffractive to be @xmath22$]% . in addition , the gluon content of the pomeron was determined to be @xmath23$]% in combination with results on diffractive dijet and @xmath24-quark production  @xcite .",
    "d0 made measurements on diffractive @xmath21 production and also @xmath25 production  @xcite , and reported the fractions of @xmath21 and @xmath25 events with a rapidity gap to be @xmath26$]% and @xmath27$]%  @xcite , respectively .",
    "these fractions are not corrected for the gap acceptance correction @xmath28 , _ i.e. _ , the fraction for diffractive events that satisfy the experimental definitions of the rapidity gaps . the estimate on @xmath28 ranges from 0.2 to 1.0 depending on the diffractive models considered .    in the new cdf run",
    "ii measurement , the rp detector is used to detect leading antiproton in diffractive @xmath19 events .",
    "the rp detector provides an accurate @xmath5 measurement , and also eliminates the ambiguity associated with @xmath28 . as in diffractive dijet production",
    ", @xmath5 can be reconstructed from both the energy depositions in the calorimeters ( @xmath29 ) and hits in the rp detector ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the @xmath29 distributions in @xmath19 events with a leading antiproton are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xical_wz ] .",
    "the diffractive @xmath21 and @xmath25 candidate events without overlaps are selected by requiring @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively .    in diffractive @xmath32 events without overlaps ,",
    "the difference between @xmath29 and @xmath14 is related to missing @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) and @xmath35 as @xmath36 , which allows to determine the neutrino kinematics , and consequently the @xmath21 kinematics .",
    "the reconstructed @xmath21 mass is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xical_wz ] .",
    "the fractions of @xmath21 and @xmath25 events which are diffractive are measured to be @xmath37$]% and @xmath38$]% in @xmath39 and @xmath40 gev/@xmath41 .",
    "the measured diffractive @xmath21 fraction is consistent with the run i cdf result when corrected to the @xmath5 and @xmath6 range in this measurement .",
    "the double diffractive ( dd ) dissociation refers to a class events in which two colliding particles dissociate into clusters of particles ( including jets in the case of hard dd events ) with a large rapidity gap between them .",
    "measurements on dd events were made by cdf  @xcite and d0  @xcite in run i in @xmath0 collisions at @xmath42 and @xmath43 gev .",
    "recently , cdf reported new preliminary results on events with a rapidity gap between forward jets from the run ii data . in cdf ii , the miniplug ( mp ) calorimeters covering @xmath44 allow",
    "a study of very forward jets with a larger rapidity gap between them than in run i. figure  [ fig : rgap_deltaeta ] ( left ) shows the kinematic characteristics of the leading two jets in an event both in mps with @xmath45 gev and @xmath46 .",
    "since these jets are in a very forward region , they have high energies despite their relatively low @xmath33 s .",
    "the dependence of the gap fraction @xmath47 was studied as a function of @xmath48 in these mp dijet events in a similar way as in  @xcite .",
    "@xmath49 is the pseudorapidity of the tower closet to @xmath50 in the proton(antiproton ) outgoing direction .",
    "the comparison of @xmath51 as a function of @xmath52 in min - bias events and mp dijet events with @xmath53 gev and @xmath54 gev is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rgap_deltaeta ] . a rapidity gap in @xmath55 ( ccal gap ) is always required .",
    "the event fraction with a central rapidity gap is about 10% in soft events , while it is about 1% in dijet events , which is consistent with the results from run i  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the shape of the @xmath51 distribution is similar between the soft and hard events .",
    "a study on the azimuthal decorrelation between the two leading jets in these forward dijet events is underway in order to investigate the effect of the muller - navelet jets  @xcite .",
    "the exclusive dijet production was first searched for by cdf in run i data , and the limit of @xmath56 nb ( 95% cl ) was placed  @xcite . in the run ii search  @xcite , first a sample of inclusive dpe dijet events is selected .",
    "the exclusive signal is then searched for examining dijet mass fraction @xmath57 which is the ratio of dijet mass @xmath58 to system mass @xmath59 .",
    "this observable should be sensitive to how much the event energy is concentrated in the dijet .",
    "the @xmath57 of exclusive dijet events is expected to be peaked around @xmath60 and have a long tail toward lower values due to hadronization effects causing energy leak from jet cones and also the presence of gluon radiations in the initial and final states .",
    "figure  [ fig : excl_jj ] shows @xmath57 distributions for data , inclusive dpe dijet monte carlo ( mc ) events from pomwig monte carlo with various sets of the pomeron structure functions , and the non - dpe events .",
    "the data clearly show an excess at high @xmath57 over the non - dpe background events and inclusive dpe predictions .",
    "the shape of excess is well described by exclusive dijet mc based on two models ( exhume  @xcite , dpemc  @xcite ) ; however , the measured cross section disfavors dpemc .",
    "predictions by khoze",
    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite are found to be consistent with data within its factor of 3 uncertainty .",
    "the long - standing diffractive program at cdf has substantially improved our understanding of diffractive processes . in run ii , the measurements on diffractive dijets and the diffractive structure function are extended to @xmath61 gev@xmath17 , and the measurement of diffractive @xmath19 production was made using the rp detector .",
    "the study on events with a rapidity - gap between forward jets is underway .",
    "in addition , cdf reported a first observation of exclusive dijet production which provides a valuable calibration for the predictions on exclusive higgs production at the lhc ."
