    "nowadays , a large amount of information is produced and shared in unstructured form , mostly unstructured text  @xcite .",
    "this information can be exploited in decision making processes but , to be useful , it should be transformed and presented in ways that make its intrinsic knowledge more readily intelligible . for that ,",
    "we need efficient methods and tools that quickly extract useful information from unstructured text collections . such demand can be observed , for instance , in biology , where researchers , in order to be abreast of all developments , need to analyse new biomedical literature on a daily basis  @xcite .",
    "another application is on fraud and corruption studies where the network information  the set of actors and their relationships  is implicitly stored in unstructured natural - language documents  @xcite .",
    "hence , text mining and information extraction are required to pre - process the texts in order to extract the entities and the relations between them .",
    "information extraction is a challenging task mainly due to the ambiguous features of natural - language .",
    "moreover , most tools need to be adapted to different human languages and to different domains  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the language of the processed texts is still the decisive factor when choosing among existing information extraction technologies .",
    "this is also true for the task of entity extraction ( named entity recognition - ner ) .    for several reasons ,",
    "text mining tools are typically first developed for english and only afterwards extended to other languages .",
    "thus , there are still relatively few text mining tools for portuguese and even less that are freely accessible . in particular , for the named entities recognition task in portuguese texts ,",
    "we find three extractors available : _ alchemy _ , _ zemanta _ and _ rembrandt _",
    "we also find some studies where the measures ( @xmath0 , @xmath2 and @xmath1 ) for those extractors are computed and compared  @xcite , but their comparative effectiveness remains domain and final purpose dependent .    in this work , we present pampo ( pattern matching and pos tagging based algorithm for ner ) , a new method to automatically extract named entities from unstructured texts , applicable to the portuguese language but potentially adaptable to other languages as well .",
    "the method relies on flexible pattern matching , part - of - speech tagging and lexical - based rules .",
    "all steps are implemented using free software and taking advantage of various existing packages .",
    "the process has been developed using as case - study a specific book written in portuguese , but it has since been used in other applications and successfully tested in different text collections . in this paper , we describe the evaluation procedures on independent textual collections , and produce a comparative study of pampo with other existing tools for ner .",
    "in 1991 , lisa f. rau presented a paper describing an algorithm , based on heuristics and handcrafted rules , to automatically extract company names from financial news  @xcite .",
    "this was one of the first research papers on the ner field  @xcite .",
    "ner was first introduced as an information extraction task but since then its use in natural language text has spread widely through several fields , namely information retrieval , question answering , machine translation , text translation , text clustering and navigation systems  @xcite . in an attempt to suit the needs of each application , nowadays ,",
    "a ner extraction workflow comprises not only analysing some input content and detecting named entities , but also assigning them a type and a list of uris for disambiguation  @xcite .",
    "new approaches have been developed with the application of supervised machine learning ( sl ) techniques  @xcite and ner evolved to nerc  named entity recognition and classification .",
    "the handicap of those techniques is the requirement of a training set , _",
    "i.e. _ , a data set manually labelled .",
    "therefore , the ner task depends also on the data set used to train the ner extraction algorithm .    currently , many existing approaches for ner / nerc are implemented and available as downloadable code , apis or web applications , _",
    "i.e. _ , as tools or services available on the web .",
    "a thorough search produces the following list : aida , alchemyapi , apache stanbol , cicerolite , dbpedia spotlight , evri , extractiv , fox , fred , lupedia , nerd , open calais , poolparty knowledge discoverer , rembrandt , reverb , saplo , semiosearch wikifier , wikimeta , yahohh ! content analysis ( yca ) , zemanta .",
    "more detailed information may be found in  @xcite , where the authors compare the services strengths and weaknesses and compute some measures for their performance .",
    "nadeau _ et al .",
    "_ in _ a survey of named entity recognition and classification _",
    "@xcite point out three factors that distinguish the nerc algorithms : the language , the textual genre or domain , and the entity type . regarding the third one , based on the grishman _",
    "definition  @xcite , named entity refers to the name of a person or an organization , a location , a brand , a product , a numeric expression ( including time , date , money and percentage ) , found in a sentence , but generally , the most studied types consider the _ enamex _ designation  proper names of ` persons ' , ` locations ' and ` organizations '  the ` miscellaneous ' category for the proper names that fall outside the classic _ enamex _ ) . in recent research ,",
    "the possible types to extract are open and include subcategories  @xcite .",
    "the language is an important factor to be taken in consideration in the ner task .",
    "most of the services are devoted to english and few support ner on portuguese texts .",
    "the first reference to work developed in portuguese texts was published in 1997  @xcite ; the authors perform the ner task and compute some measures in a portuguese corpus and other five corpora . until now",
    ", we have only identified the rembrandt tool as a service developed and devoted to extract named entities in portuguese texts .",
    "other tools ( _ alchemyapi , nerd _ and _ zemanta _ ) have been adapted to work and accept portuguese texts but were not specifically developed for that purpose . as recently pointed out by taba and caseli  @xcite",
    ", the portuguese language still lacks high quality linguistic resources and tools .",
    "ner is not only one task of the text mining process but also an initial step in the performance of other tasks , such as relation extraction , classification and/or topic modelling  @xcite .",
    "this makes the quality of the ner process particularly important . in the light of the related works and taking in consideration",
    "that most of the approaches optimize @xmath2 but not @xmath0 , we propose pampo to extract named entities in portuguese texts . in this work",
    "we do not classify neither disambiguate the entity .",
    "our major concern is to increase the @xmath0 without decreasing the @xmath2 of the named entity extractor .",
    "in this work , we consider the _ enamex _ definition of entities plus the miscellaneous named entities where we include events like , for instance , _ ` jogos olmpicos ' _ ( _ ` olympic games ' _ ) . to identify those entities ,",
    "an information extraction procedure was designed using regular expressions and other pattern matching strategies , along with part - of - speech tagging , _",
    "i.e. _ , employing a part - of - speech tagger ( post ) tool .",
    "the extraction of the named entities from portuguese unstructured texts is composed of two phases : candidate generation , where we generate a superset of candidate entities , and entity selection , where only relevant candidates are kept .",
    "the two phases are described in algorithms  [ algo1 ] and [ algo2 ] , respectively .    * pampo - candidate generation * in this phase , we provide a customizable base of regular expressions that gathers common candidate entities .",
    "typical expressions capture capitalized words , personal titles ( president , deputy , etc . ) and other common words ( assembly ) .",
    "this patterns base is extendable and the aim of the process in this phase is to identify all good candidates .",
    "@xmath3 , @xmath4:term pattern base @xmath5 @xmath6    * pampo - entity selection * here , all candidate entities of the previous phase are part - of - speech tagged .",
    "the post process tags tokens with their corresponding word type ( lexical category ) .",
    "based on the tagging of the terms in candidate entities , we can identify some that can be discarded .",
    "this is done by applying a second level of regular expressions . in the entity selection phase ,",
    "the regular expressions are defined on the lexical categories instead of terms themselves .",
    "for example , if the first word type is a ` pron - det ' ( pos tag meaning determiner pronoun ) the word is removed .",
    "another example is the removal of candidate entities that do not have at least one tag ` prop ' or ` n ' ( pos tag meaning a proper noun and a noun ) .",
    "@xmath6 : candidate entities , @xmath7 : category clipping patterns , @xmath8 : category pruning patterns , @xmath9 : term pruning pattern base @xmath10 post of the candidate entity @xmath11 remove matching prefix from @xmath12 remove corresponding prefix from @xmath11 @xmath13 @xmath13 modified @xmath6      the program was developed in r  @xcite and makes use of some specific text mining packages .",
    "we have implemented our method using the following r packages : * tm *  @xcite , * cwhmisc *  @xcite , * memoise *  @xcite , * opennlp *  @xcite , * hmisc *  @xcite . the opennlp pos tagger uses a probability model to predict the correct pos tag and , for portuguese language , it was trained on conll_x bosque data .",
    "the @xmath4 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 bases adopted , for portuguese texts , and used in this application are described in this section . as a first approach , and to test the pampo algorithm , we selected a book about the portuguese freemasonry  @xcite . despite being on a specific topic",
    ", it contains a rich variety of situations to test our extractor . as an example , the piece of text shown in figure  [ fig : livro ] was scanned from the book with current ocr software and will be used here to highlight the contribution of each phase to the final result .",
    "the five named entities manually identified in this piece of text are _ `",
    "irmandade do bairro ut o ' , ` parlamento do g ' , ` jorge silva ' , ` ian ' _ and _ ` ministro miguel relvas'_.        applying algorithm  1 to the paragraph of figure  [ fig : livro ] , the set of ` candidate entities ' found are _ ` irmandade do bairro ut o ' , ` conhecemos ' , ` parlamento do g ' , ` l ' , ` k ' , ` jorge silva ' , ` ian ' _ and _ ` ministro miguel relvas'_. although most of the words in the extracted ` candidate entities ' list start with capital letter , with this algorithm we were able to extract also other important words that are not capitalized like the first word in the last named entity ( _ ministro _ ) .",
    "this is possible because the @xmath4 base includes a set of patterns that captures not only words ( or sequence of words ) starting with capital letters but also words that are associated to some entity s name like the ones in list1 on appendix a.    having collected the ` candidate entities ' in the previous step , we now proceed by removing from that list the ones that do not correspond to named entities . for that purpose , we use list2 ( see appendix a ) as @xmath7 base , all the tags that are not a noun ( @xmath14 ) or a proper noun ( @xmath15 ) are included in the @xmath8 base and , finally , some terms that are not named entities but that were not excluded by previous actions ( see list3 on appendix a ) , are used as @xmath9 base . applying algorithm  2 with those lists to the set of ` candidate entities ' , from figure  [ fig : livro ] , we obtain as named entities _ ` irmandade do bairro ut o ' , ` parlamento do g ' , ` jorge silva ' , ` ian ' _ and _ ` ministro miguel relvas'_. in fact , these five terms are the only named entities in the paragraph .      table  [ cloud ] shows the most frequent ` candidate entities ' from the whole book , as extracted by algorithm 1 and which of those candidate entities were considered as actual ` named entities ' by algorithm 2 .",
    "to give an idea of the improvement introduced by each phase , we represent the ` candidate entities ' set in a word cloud where words with higher frequency have larger font size .",
    "as it can be observed in figure  [ fig : wordcloud ] , after phase  1 some words that do not refer to entities , such as _ ` idem'(`idem ' ) , ` entre ' ( ` between ' ) _ and _ ` nas ' ( ` at the ' ) _ , are present in the cloud , but , as expected , they disappear in phase 2 .    .",
    "some results of the application of pampo to the whole book . in the left column",
    "we have the most frequent ` candidate entities ' ( please note that the column is folded in two ) , in the right column we have a ` @xmath16 ' if the algorithm considers it a ` named entity ' and a ` @xmath17 ' if not . [ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : addlabel3 ]    based on all the values of the differences between pampo and the other extractors , represented in tables  [ tab : addlabel1 ] and  [ tab : addlabel3 ] , we may say that :    * the @xmath0 of the pampo extractor is the highest in almost all the news ; * @xmath2 does not differ much between pampo and the other extractors ; * as a consequence the @xmath1 of pampo is also the highest in almost all the news ; * the mean difference of @xmath0 between pampo and _ alchemyapi _ seams to be at least greater than 0.25 ; * the mean difference of @xmath0 between pampo and _ rembrandt _ seams to be at least greater than 0.35 ; * the mean difference of @xmath0 between pampo and _ zemanta _ seams to be at least greater than 0.40 ; * the mean difference of @xmath2 is positive but near zero for all the three extractors ; * the mean difference of @xmath1 between pampo and _ alchemyapi _ seams to be at least greater than 0.15 ; * the mean difference of @xmath1 between pampo and _ rembrandt _ seams to be at least greater than 0.25 ; * the mean difference of @xmath1 between pampo and _ zemanta _ seams to be at least greater than 0.30 .    to test the null hypothesis that the mean @xmath0 differences between pampo and the other extractors are equal to 0.25 , 0.35 and 0.40 , for _ alchemyapi _ , _ rembrandt _ and _ zemanta _ , respectively , _",
    "ztest _ was performed considering as alternative the mean @xmath0 differences greater than those values .",
    "based on the results of these two corpora the p - values are smaller than 9.5e-05 .",
    "hence , the results obtained so far provide statistical evidence that pampo increases ner @xmath0 by at least 0.25 .",
    "in this work we propose a novel effective method to extract named entities from unstructured text .",
    "the proposed pampo method is implemented using free software , namely r and available packages .",
    "two manually annotated portuguese news corpora were used to empirically evaluate the algorithm using the measures of @xmath0 , @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "these corpora did not influence the definition of the algorithm or the construction of its pattern bases .",
    "we have compared pampo with three other ner extractors : _ alchemyapi _ , _ rembrandt _ and _ zemanta_. experimental results clearly show that pampo obtains significantly higher @xmath0 and @xmath1 than existing tools .",
    "the values of @xmath2 are identical .",
    "we may say also that pampo s performance in the _ harem _ corpus was at least as good as the best one of the systems reported over there when we consider all categories of entities .",
    "however , when we exclude dates and numeric expressions , it presents better results than the ones reported for other tools .    despite its simplicity",
    ", pampo has a very good performance and is highly configurable .",
    "the pampo algorithm is potentially adaptable to be used for other languages by properly defining the pattern bases .",
    "furthermore , it allows for straightforward improvement of the results by adding terms to the lists .",
    "the results take us one step closer to the creation of a text intelligence system to be used in several applications , namely , in the study of the social context of possible economic and financial offenses . as future work the authors are planning to improve the text mining procedure , by including a classification and a disambiguation step , as well as by automatically characterizing the relations between entities .",
