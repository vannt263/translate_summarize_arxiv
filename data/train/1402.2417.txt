    "further @xmath11 denotes the metric of unit sphere .",
    "nut spacetime is a vacuum solution but is not asymptotically euclidean so we ca nt construct a field theory on it .",
    "nut - space was discovered in ehlers thesis @xciteand later rediscovered @xcite .",
    "diffferent aspects of this solutions have been studied in the literature@xcite .",
    "derivation of nut spacetime using ehlers transformation is known . in the present work we study a more complex version of such transformation .",
    "we start by a static seed metric which solves einstein field equations in vacuum .",
    "we present and prove a theorem from buchdahl @xcite , it shows that how we can construct another static vacuum solution of einstein gravity , which is not a formal coordinate transformation of the old one .",
    "the new metric is called reciprocal .",
    "we explain by reciprocal what we mean physically . as a motivated idea",
    "we use the ehlers transformation along with the @xmath12 decomposition of stationary spacetimes ( gravitoelectromagnetic ) for reciprocal metrics .",
    "we obtained reciprocal schwarzschild metric as a reciprocal analogue of the original one .",

    "it should be mentioned that we shall use units in which @xmath13(spatial ) while @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "rest of the paper is organized as follows :  in section ii , starting from a static ( time independent ) vacuum solution of einstein field equations , we perform a reciprocal transformation on it . in section iii ,",
    "we have elaborated the basic idea of ehlers transformation to find a way on how we can generate a certain family of stationary metrics from the given static metrics .",
    "duality in gravitoelectromagnetism and reciprocal transformation has been discussed in section iv . in sections",
    "v , vi , vii and viii we have discussed the reciprocal schwarzschild spacetime , reciprocal nut space from reciprocal schwarzschild through ehlers transformation , reciprocal morgan - morgan disk space and reciprocal morgan - morgan - nut respectively .",
    "we have concluded in section x.",
    "at the beginning of the present section we first state the main proposal of the reciprocal principle .",
    "we follow the terminology of @xcite .",
    "the concept of metric @xmath16 reciprocal to metric @xmath17 was defined by the following @xmath18-dimensional metric : @xmath19 in vacuum , @xmath20 . both metrics @xmath21 must be static . it means a coordinate @xmath22 exists such that the metric @xmath3 satisfies the conditions : @xmath23 the reciprocal algorithm works if @xmath24 satisfy the vacuum einstein equation . under reciprocal transformation",
    "the einstein field equations are invariant .",
    "if we denote by @xmath25 the corresponding tensor - density , then reciprocal algorithm follows by these identities : @xmath26 if we define @xmath27 , then ( [ t ] ) may be written in the form : @xmath28 so we conclude as the following : reciprocal transformation of two static metrics is a transformation which preserves the form of einstein equation and additionaly , under this transformation the components of the quantity @xmath29 decomposed to @xmath30 ( tensor),@xmath31(scalar ) behave like ( [ q ] ) . if we take @xmath32 ( time ) , we can underestand the scalar @xmath31 as energy .    after this introduction to the topic",
    "we follow our search to find the four dimensional examples .",
    "if we choice @xmath33,we start from a static ( time independent ) vacuum solution of einstein field equations in the following representation : @xmath34 it solves vacuum field equations @xmath35 .",
    "we have a theorem about such metrics + * theorem * : starting from ( [ g0 ] ) as seed metric , we perform a reciprocal transformation on it .",
    "the following new metric is also an exact solution of vacuum field equations @xmath36 : @xmath37    * proof * : to prove this theorem it is needed that we pass some intermediate steps by some lemma .    * lemma.a * : let the general @xmath38 dimensional metric be in the following static form : @xmath39 the ricci tensor associated to this spacetime @xmath40 can be written in the following forms : @xmath41 here @xmath42 is the ricci tensor of metric @xmath43 .",
    "* lemma.b * : now if we write @xmath44 and , @xmath45 is metric of @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath47 is conformal to @xmath46,so we have : @xmath48\\label{2.3}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath49 here @xmath50 .    *",
    "lemma.c * : using ( [ 2.3])in ( [ 2.1 ] ) , the ricci tensor of @xmath51 becomes : @xmath52\\label{2.5}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    now we prove our theorem .",
    "suppose that @xmath20 . by algebraic manipulation we arrives to the following equations : @xmath53 here @xmath54 .",
    "using these expressions , we are able to rewrite ( [ 2.5 ] ) in the following equivalent form : @xmath55 the above equation shows that the einstein equations @xmath20 are invariant with respect to the mutual interchange of @xmath56 .",
    "we note that ( [ 3.3 ] ) satisfies by two set of metric functions : @xmath57 this is the seed metric .",
    "the next solutions is : @xmath58 this is the reciprocal metric @xmath16 .",
    "it completes our proof .",
    "transformation between two kinds of metrics given by eqs.([g0 ] ) and ( [ g1 ] ) is called reciprocal transformation .",
    "it was proposed firstly for vacuum solutions @xcite .",
    "however , later it was extended to non - vacuum cases also . in the present work",
    "we shall investigate the vacuum solutions through reciprocal transformation in the simplest form as shown in the above theorem@xcite .",
    "the basic idea behind ehlers transformation is to find a way for generating a certain family of stationary metrics from the given static ( non - stationary ) metrics .",
    "let us assume that we have a static mass distribution density with gravitational dipole moments .",
    "if this mass configuration is rotated physically around an axis then it transits to higher order moments , which are quadrapoles in this case .",
    "we are interested to understand this kind of transition in the language of electro - magnetic gravitational fields .",
    "it means we find a similar formulation of the einstein field equations in vacuum in terms of a set of the vector fields , in a similar manner as electric or magnetic fields in classical maxwell s theory .",
    "indeed , as we shall observe , transition of a dipole moment to quadrapole is well understood in terms of the gravitoelectromagnetic fields .",
    "to start , let us introduce a methodology using the @xmath12-decomposition ( threading ) of a spacetime , proposed generally for any stationary spacetime via a congruence family of time like curves .",
    "for a typical metric we obtain following decomposion for the spacetime line element @xcite : @xmath59 in the terminology of @xcite , here @xmath60 and @xmath61 are defined to be _ the invariant spatial and temporal length elements _ under general coordinate transformation .",
    "it defines the spacetime line element between two causal events .",
    "they are obtained from a set of normalized tangent vector @xmath62 to the time like curves in the following form ; @xmath63 @xmath64 here @xmath65 denotes an induced metric @xmath66 here we define a vector potential using @xmath67 .",
    "we are able to rewrite the metric in the following optional form : @xmath68 we opt for a well posed and _ preferred parameterization of the coordinate time _",
    "@xmath69 ( generally and strictly speaking it does nt have the same interpretation as physical time ) for the comoving observers ; @xmath70 so far , we have the following equations@xcite ; @xmath71 @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 we introduce @xmath75 and @xmath76 as the _ gravitoelectric _ and _ gravitomagnetic _ potential functions respectively .",
    "the corresponding vector fields are@xcite ; @xmath77 where the vector differential operators are computed in the @xmath78 space .",
    "einstein gravitational field equation in vacuum has the following forms : @xmath79 we have the following theorem :    * * ehlers theorem**@xcite : if    @xmath80    with @xmath81 representing the _ conformal _ spatial distance , represents the metric of a static vacuum spacetime , then , @xmath82    ( with @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 ) is the metric of a stationary vacuum spacetime _ if and only if _ @xmath86 satisfies the following equation ; @xmath87}\\label{ehlers'-eq}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath88 , @xmath89 is the conformal spatial metric .",
    "( [ ehlers-eq ] ) is called as the ehlers equation .",
    "integrationg of ehlers equation is equivalent to solve maxwell s equation by a given scalar potential @xmath75 . in this work",
    ", we shall derive the reciprocal nut spaces as the stationary spacetime which is the gravitational dual of reciprocal static space as seed .",
    "throughout this section we used @xmath90 to refer to the reciprocal quantities . by simple replacement of @xmath91 the reciprocal form of ( [ seed ] )",
    "is obtained as : @xmath92 one can write ( [ nut ] ) analogous to ( [ rec - seed ] ) in the form : @xmath93 the reciprocal vector field @xmath94 satisfies the reciprocal ehlers equation : @xmath95}\\label{rec - ehlers'-eq}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that @xmath96,consequently @xmath97 .",
    "comparison of ( [ ehlers-eq],[rec - ehlers-eq ] ) leads to : @xmath98 so , gravitational dual of the reciprocal metric changes the gravito fields to the following forms : @xmath99 the reciprocal forms of the field equations are written in the following : @xmath100 note that @xmath101 . under reciprocal transformations",
    "the system of the field equations remain invariant if and only if @xmath102 . to preserve the same forms of the equations for @xmath103 under reciprocal transformation",
    ", we must have : @xmath104    * theorem * : the full system of the maxwell equations for gravitoelectromagnetism fields is invariant under a reciprocal transformation of the fields and nut parameter as the follows : @xmath105 so the original seed metric and reciprocal one , are physically correspond to two different spacetimes .",
    "reciprocal metric of schwarzschild spacetime is obtained using the reciprocal formalism .",
    "one has : @xmath106 this is verified to be a non flat exact solution to the vacuum einstein field equations using the maple tensor package .. where @xmath107 .",
    "if one adds a constant to @xmath108 to write @xmath109 , then it would no longer be a vacuum solution _ ]",
    "we mention here that the coordinate transformation @xmath110 transforms ( [ schwz - rec ] ) to the common form of the schwarzschild spacetime : @xmath111",
    "we begin with the reciprocal schwarzschild mertic in the form ( [ schwz - rec ] ) ; @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "it is observed that starting by this seed metric , the ehlers equation ( [ ehlers-eq ] ) reduces to , @xmath114 in which we suppose that @xmath115 to keep the terminated stationary spacetime single valued and axially symmetric . + by imposing axial symmetry , gravitomagnetic field",
    "is obtained to be , @xmath116 ( it is compared with the case of non reciprocal nut space with a plus sign @xcite ) .",
    "so the resulted stationary metric is given by ; @xmath117 it coincides with the nut space in its original form if we apply a suitable coordinate transformation @xcite .",
    "indeed , this solution matches to the previously solution was obtained in @xcite .",
    "the case of pure nut is obtained when we set @xmath118 but we kept @xmath119 , it reads as the following form : @xmath120 if we rescale the radial coordinate as @xmath121 and meanwhile @xmath122 we obtain : @xmath123 reciprocal transformation here refers to the change of the sign of potential function @xmath124 .",
    "it means the reciprocal configurations has the same amount of energy but with negative sign of magnetic charge . after applying the dual transformation ,",
    "the same stationary metric is obtained but with a negative charge sign .",
    "both stationary metrics mimic the same form but their seeds are reciprocal .",
    "dual gravitational rotation included a nut charge which has the opposite sign for both seed metrics , reciprocal and non reciprocal .",
    "physically , ehlers transformation induced a reciprocal ( with opposite sign ) of gravitomagnetic monopople charge .",
    "reciprocality in the energy content of the seed metric is related to the charge of the resulted stationary solutions .",
    "the thin metric of a static disk with gravitational quadrapoles was introduced originally in @xcite .",
    "a modern formulation of this metric was presented later by morgan - morgan ( mm ) spacetime @xcite .",
    "the appropriate coordinate system is oblate ellipsoidal coordinates @xmath125 in which the definition of these coordinates is understood through the the weyl @xmath126 axial coordinates are ; @xmath127 .",
    "reciprocal mm spacetime is written in the following form : @xmath128\\label{mm - rec}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in terms of the oblate ellipsoidal coordinates @xmath125 ; @xmath129 ( 3\\eta^2 - 1)\\right),\\eqno(34)\\ ] ] and @xmath130,\\eqno(35)\\ ] ] here auxiliary functions are defined by @xmath131,\\eqno(36)\\ ] ] mm metric is one of the most explicit forms of the disk metrics .",
    "it has an interesting interpretation as a dust disk rotationg clock side and counter clock side in such a way that the metric has zero net angular momentum .",
    "starting with the reciprocal morgan - morgan static disk space given by equation ( [ mm - rec ] ) we firstly rewrite it as follows @xmath132 p_2(\\eta)\\right).\\eqno(40)\\ ] ] now selecting an axially symmetric gravitomagnetic potential @xmath133,via ehlers transformation ( [ ehlers-eq ] ) we obtain ; @xmath134 @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the duality rotation parameter and @xmath137 denotes the radius of the thin disk . by substituting the above potential into the equations we find : @xmath138+\\beta .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the nut factor for reciprocal metric changed the sign from plus to minus in the form @xmath139 ( with the negative sign in comparison to the usual nut space ) . to recover the reciprocal morgan - morgan space as @xmath140",
    ", we adapted @xmath141 , consequently the metric of the reciprocal stationary spacetime of a thin disk with mass @xmath142 and magnetic mass ( nut factor ) @xmath143 is obtained by : @xmath144 ^ 2   \\\\ & &     \\nonumber+ a^2(\\frac{l^2}{4m^2}e^{-2u}+e^{2u})\\big(e^{2k } ( \\xi^2 + \\eta^2)(\\frac{d\\xi^2 } { 1+\\xi^2 } + \\frac{d\\eta^2 } { 1-\\eta^2 } ) + \\\\ & & \\nonumber ( 1+\\xi^2)(1-\\eta^2)d\\phi^2\\big).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in a similar manner as the previous case and using the maple tensor package , it is easy to verify that this metric solves vacuum einstein field equations .",
    "as an illustrative problem , consider the following parametrization of the flat spacetime : @xmath145 the reciprocal metric for this flat space is : @xmath146 this metric is non flat .",
    "so , reciprocal transformation gives us a curved spacetime , by starting from the flat spacetime@xcite .",
    "generating methods to find new exact solutions of einstein equations are few . as a motivated work , we reintroduced and proved a theorem .",
    "this theorem stated that for any given static solution of einstein field equations there exists a unique reciprocal metric which also satisfies field equations .",
    "the physical meaning of reciprocal transformation has been understood via energy tensor . under reciprocal transformation",
    "the spatial components of the seed and the reciprocal metric are invariant .",
    "but the time component or energy density changed the sign .",
    "it can be interpreted as the negative mass parameter of reciprocal metric in comparison to the original one .",
    "another important transformation is ehlers transformation , was called as gravitational dual transformation .",
    "it was proposed as a tool to find a corresponding stationary metric from a given static solution .",
    "the main idea is inspired by the concept of rewriting the einstein equations in stationary spacetimes in terms of a pair of electro - magnetic fields which have gravitational origin . following this formalism",
    "the field equations can be cast in the form of maxwell s equations . in the present paper",
    "we have come up to an work where , by using the ehlers ( dual gravitational ) transformation , by starting from the reciprocal schwarzschild , reciprocal morgan - morgan - nut as seed metrics we find their corresponding stationary space - times .",
    "the stationary space - times obtained in this work is found to endure from a ` nut`-type family of solutions . under reciprocal transformations ,",
    "nut parameter changes the sign due to the fact that reciprocal seed and the original one has reciprocal mass parameters .",
    "it has been shown that the system of field equations for gravitoelectromagnetic fields is invariant under reciprocal transformations .",
    "an additional observation is that the nut charge is changed the sign . starting from any static seed metric , performing the reciprocal transformation and by applying an additional ehlers transforation we have obtained a family of nut spaces with negative nut factor ( reciprocal nut factors ) .",
    "we mention here that finding the reciprocal transformation for a stationary space time in the following form : @xmath147 is an open problem which is under study .",
