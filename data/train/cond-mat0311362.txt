    "this limit is defined as the magnetic field required to cause the energy of the partially spin - polarized normal state to become lower than that of the condensate .    in spite of the simplicity of cdw systems , the large values of the cdw condensation temperatures @xmath9 , typically of order 100  k  @xcite ,",
    "make the pauli limit inaccessible in standard laboratory magnetic fields for the vast majority of cdw materials  @xcite .",
    "our reason for studying the title compounds , @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1hg(scn)@xmath2 , is that they lie at the far lower end of the spectrum of transition temperatures , with @xmath10  k  @xcite for @xmath3  k and @xmath11  k for @xmath3  rb , making them perhaps the most marginal of cdw systems .",
    "consequently , they are the only cdw compounds in which the gap is sufficiently low for the primary cdw phase , cdw@xmath12 , to have been shown to be pauli limited by a relatively modest magnetic field of @xmath13  t for @xmath3  k and @xmath14  t for @xmath3  rb  @xcite",
    ".    it must be stated , however , that the marginal cdw properties of @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1hg(scn)@xmath2 render it somewhat beyond the predictive power of the standard theory  @xcite . for instance , the low transition temperature results in a cdw with a weak charge modulation that is vulnerable to fluctuations and sample - dependent effects  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the presence of large sections of the fermi surface left ungapped by the cdw order  @xcite ( see inset to fig .  [ fermisurface ] ) causes the energy associated with the coupling of the magnetic field to orbital degrees of freedom of the itinerant electrons to rival the condensation energy .",

    "since the conventional cdw phase , cdw@xmath12 , is no longer stable at high magnetic fields , the spin - up and spin - down electrons must instead form independent charge and spin modulations with momentum vectors @xmath15 and @xmath16  @xcite , leading to a different type of cdw phase .    experimental studies of this high - magnetic - field phase , denoted cdw@xmath4 , lead one to question whether it is a cdw at all . while conventional wisdom has it that cdws constitute a class of narrow - gap insulators  @xcite , experimental studies find behavior that is reminiscent either of the quantum hall effect  @xcite or superconductivity  @xcite .",
    "these experimental findings include a sharp drop in the electrical resistivity at low temperatures , persistent currents and unusual hall - voltage phenomena .",

    "the present paper seeks to reconcile the body of experimental evidence  @xcite in exploring the predicted properties of a new type of quantum fluid , consisting of a cdw coexisting with a 2d fermi surface .",
    "a simple model shows that the exchange of quasiparticles between these subsystems results in the sample partially screening time- and spatially - varying electromagnetic fields via two types of current flow ; this result is supported by the experimental data in this work , which show that the screening currents observed in earlier magnetic measurements  @xcite comprise two parts .",
    "the first is weighted mostly towards the sample edges and can be considered a free current @xmath5 , furnishing a hall - potential gradient . the second contribution is analogous to the `` magnetic currents '' @xmath6 used to represent the effects of localised orbital moments  @xcite in producing magnetization .",
    "these currents , which are essentially of infinite duration  @xcite , represent a local , microscopic current flow within the bulk of the sample ; they occur if the surface scrrening mechanism fails , causing the cdw , instead , to be coerced by an external change in magnetic field into a non - equilibrium state . in this case ,",

    "<S> single crystals of the organic charge - transfer salts @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1hg(scn)@xmath2 have been studied using hall - potential measurements ( @xmath3k ) and magnetization experiments ( @xmath3  k , rb ) . </S>",
    "<S> the data show that two types of screening currents occur within the high - field , low - temperature cdw@xmath4 phases of these salts in response to time - dependent magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> the first , which gives rise to the induced hall potential , is a free current ( @xmath5 ) , present at the surface of the sample . </S>",
    "<S> the time constant for the decay of these currents is much longer than that expected from the sample resistivity . </S>",
    "<S> the second component of the current appears to be magnetic ( @xmath6 ) , in that it is a microscopic , quasi - orbital effect ; it is evenly distributed within the bulk of the sample upon saturation . to explain these data , we propose a simple model invoking a new type of quantum fluid comprising a cdw coexisting with a two - dimensional fermi - surface pocket which describes the two types of current . the model and data </S>",
