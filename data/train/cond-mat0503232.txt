    "in a recent experiment @xcite , bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) were loaded in a one - dimensional trapping potential created by superimposing two independent one - dimensional homogeneous optical lattices with commensurate lattice constants @xmath0 and @xmath1 , @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this gives rise to an optical trapping potential characterized by a periodic modulation involving @xmath3 subsequent local minima , i.e. a @xmath4-periodic superlattice .    in this paper",
    "we address the superfluid - insulator quantum phase transition that is expected to characterize this system , due to the competition between the boson repulsive interaction and the kinetic energy @xcite .",
    "we recall that the latter can be tuned experimentally , being directly related to the strength of the optic potential @xcite .",
    "the control of this parameter actually played a key role in recent experiments where the superfluid - insulator quantum phase transition was revealed for two and three dimensional arrays of bose - einstein condensates @xcite .",
    "in particular , we provide the zero - temperature phase diagram for the bose - hubbard ( bh ) model , originally introduced for liquid helium in porous media @xcite and nowadays commonly adopted in the description of bec arrays trapped in optic lattices @xcite and superlattices @xcite .",
    "we recall that in the latter case the phase diagram may exhibit unusual loophole shaped insulator domain corresponding to fractional fillings .",
    "these domains , that can not be described by standard strong coupling perturbative expansions ( scpe ) , have been shown to exist by exploiting the exact mapping between hard core bosons and free spinless fermions on one dimensional systems @xcite , and subsequently investigated by means of a qualitative multiple - site mean field approach @xcite . in the case of @xmath5 superlattices , quantitative results have been provided in terms of ( analytical ) first - order cell scpe and quantum monte carlo simulations @xcite .    here , such phase diagram are obtained in terms of second order _ cell _ scpe for the ground state energy of the system , that  unlike the standard scpe  allow a rather satisfactory quantitative description of all of the critical fractional fillings characterizing superlattices @xcite .",
    "this is possible basically because in cell scpe the unperturbed system is not a collection of individual lattice sites @xcite , but rather the collection of the individual unit cells inherent in the richer periodic nature of superlattices .",
    "for all of the fractional fillings determining the key features of the zero - temperature phase diagram , this choice allows the analytic description of the unperturbed ground state that lies at the basis of a perturbative expansion .",
    "the price for the improved description granted by cell scpe is the loss of the completely analytical treatment allowed by standard scpe .",
    "indeed , completely analytical results based on cell scpe are approachable only at first perturbative order , for small cell sizes and fillings @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", cell scpe provides quite satisfactory results with a relatively small numeric effort , consisting basically in the exact diagonalization of the bh hamiltonian relevant to the isolated unit cell of the superlattice .",
    "this allows a reliable quantitative description of situations beyond the reach of standard scpe and/or quite demanding for more refined numeric approaches , such as quantum monte carlo simulations ( relatively large fractional fillings for superlattices whose unit cell comprises several sites ) .",
    "the most noteworthy result evidenced by our cell scpe concerns the critical kinetic to repulsive energy ratio characterizing the loophole insulating domains . indeed , according to previous estimates based on a mean - field approach @xcite , the loophole insulating domains are entered at critical values of the above ratio much smaller than that relevant to the usual lobe - shaped domains .",
    "our second - order cell scpe , which provide a more quantitative estimate than mean - field approximations , show that the critical values for the loophole domains are of the same order , and sometimes even larger , than those of the usual lobe domains with comparable critical fillings .",
    "this suggests that the insulating phase corresponding to fractional filling loophole domains does not require extreme experimental conditions .",
    "furthermore , second - order cell scpe confirm the reentrant character of the insulating domains predicted for superlattice by a mean - field approach and first - order cell scpe @xcite .",
    "the plan of this paper is the following . in sec . [",
    "s : bh ] we recall the _",
    "superlattice bose - hubbard model _",
    "@xcite for the description of ultracold atoms in optic superlattices and introduce the key ideas of cell scpe , the details of this approach being confined in the appendix for the sake of readability . in sec .",
    "[ s : results ] we illustrate the capabilities of the technique by comparing cell scpe and quantum monte carlo results for a @xmath5 superlattice .",
    "we confirm that cell scpe is satisfactory also when the perturbative parameter is not very small .",
    "in particular quite satisfactory results are obtained even in the the homogeneous case .",
    "furthermore we provide the zero - temperature phase diagrams for some realistic one dimensional superlattices @xcite .",
    "section [ s : concl ] contains our conclusions .",
    "following the tight - binding - like approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , ultracold atoms in optical superlattices are commonly described by means of a _",
    "superlattice bose - hubbard model _",
    "@xcite characterized by a periodic modulation of hamiltonian parameters such as the local energy offsets and the hopping amplitudes between neighbouring lattice sites . in the particular case of one dimensional @xmath4-periodic superlattices , a unit cell consists of @xmath4 subsequent sites , so that a site can be conveniently labeled by two indices , denoting the cell it belongs to and its position within such cell , respectively .",
    "hence , the bose - hubbard ( bh ) hamiltonian for a superlattice comprising @xmath6 cells each containing @xmath4 sites can be written in the form @xmath7 where @xmath8   - \\sum_{k=1}^{\\ell-1 }   t_k ( a_{k , c } a_{k+1,c}^+ + a_{k , c}^+ a_{k+1,c})\\ ] ] refer to the @xmath9th cell , whereas @xmath10 joins subsequent cells .",
    "operators @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 create , annihilate and count bosons at site labeled @xmath14 . as to the hamiltonian parameters , @xmath15 is the boson ( repulsive ) interaction",
    ", @xmath16 is the chemical potential , @xmath17 is the energy offset of the @xmath18th site within the cell , the @xmath19 s with @xmath20 are the intra - cell hopping amplitudes and @xmath21 accounts for the hopping of bosons across neighbouring cells . of course on an infinite @xmath4-periodic structure the @xmath4 possible choices for the boundaries of the cells are in principle equivalent . however , in view of our strong coupling perturbative expansion , the most reasonable choice is such that the inter - cell hopping amplitudes are the smallest .",
    "as we recalled above , the one - dimensional @xmath4-periodic superlattice bose - hubbard ( bh ) exhibits an insulator - superfluid quantum phase transition at any rational filling of the form @xmath22 , @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "these phase transitions are commonly put into evidence in the zero - temperature @xmath24-@xmath25 phase diagram , where @xmath26 is a scaling factor for the superlattice hopping amplitude related to the strength of the optic potential ( that is @xmath27 ) .",
    "more to the point , the boundaries of the insulating domain relevant to the critical filling @xmath28 are obtained comparing the ground state energies of the systems containing @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 bosons , where @xmath32 is the number of sites in the lattice , which should be large enough to provide a satisfactory approximation of the thermodynamic limit .",
    "since the size of the hilbert space for @xmath33 bosons on @xmath32 sites is @xmath34 , exact diagonalization is beyond the reach of common computational capabilities already for relatively small systems at low fillings , and a numeric estimate of the ground state energies under concern requires complex algorithms such as quantum monte carlo @xcite or density matrix renormalization group simulations @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , satisfactory approximations of the ground state energies required for the description of the insulator domains are obtained for homogeneous lattices in terms of analytic third order expansions in the ratio of the hopping amplitude and the boson interaction .",
    "this approach can be extended to structures featuring inhomogeneous hopping amplitudes , including superlattices @xcite , but in general for integer critical fillings only .",
    "indeed , in the case of fractional critical fillings , an explicit form for the structure of the unperturbed ground state is might not be available for the boson populations involved in the determination of the insulator domain boundaries .",
    "this typically happens when some of the local potentials @xmath17 within the unit cell are equal , and loophole insulator domains appear in the phase diagram @xcite .",
    "consider for instance the extreme case where there is no modulation in the local potentials ( i.e. , without loss of generality , @xmath35 ) and the periodic pattern of the superlattice is due to the hopping terms alone , which do not appear in the unperturbed hamiltonian of standard scpe .",
    "the only fractional fillings for which the form of the unperturbed ground state can be easily provided are those differing by a single boson from an integer filling , i.e. those involved in the determination of the integer - filling insulator domains @xcite .",
    "this is basically due to the fact that the degeneracy of the lower eigenspace of the unperturbed hamiltonian equals the lattice size , so that finding the unperturbed ground state reduces to a trivial single - particle problem . for any other fractional",
    "filling , the degeneracy of the lower unperturbed eigenspace is much larger than the lattice size , and the ground state can not be found analytically .",
    "this problem can be circumvented adopting a perturbative approach that takes advantage of the periodic modulation of the hamiltonian parameters characterizing a superlattice bh model , i.e. whose perturbative parameter is the inter - cell hopping amplitude @xcite .",
    "that is to say , in the _ cell _ scpe the unperturbed hamiltonian is the sum of the independent cell hamiltonians @xmath36 while the perturbative term is that defined by eq .",
    "( [ e : pert ] ) .",
    "we mention that a similar approach was adopted in the study of the hubbard @xcite and heisenberg @xcite models in the special case of a dimerized chain ( i.e. a @xmath5 superlattice ) . in some sense ,",
    "cell scpe is standard scpe applied to the homogeneous lattice made up by unit cells instead of individual lattice sites .",
    "this choice makes it easy the determination of the analytic form of the unperturbed ground state for the total populations @xmath37 , @xmath38 relevant to the fractional critical filling @xmath39 .",
    "indeed , a generic eigenstate and the corresponding eigenvalue of the unperturbed hamiltonian ( [ e : h0 ] ) have the form @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 denotes the @xmath18th eigenstate of the cell hamiltonian ( [ e : cbhh ] ) for a population of @xmath33 bosons , and @xmath43 is the relevant eigenvalue . in the following",
    "we assume that these states are sorted according to their energy , so that the label @xmath44 refers to the ground state .",
    "thus , in particular , the ground state of @xmath45 relevant to the critical fractional filling @xmath39 ( i.e. to the total population @xmath46 ) and the relevant energy have the form latexmath:[\\[\\label{e : gs0 m }    taking into account the translational symmetry of cell lattice , the _ defect _ ground states @xcite of @xmath45 , corresponding to _ particle _ and _ hole _ total populations @xmath48 , have the form @xcite",
    "@xmath49 @xmath50 are @xmath51 and @xmath52 where the prime signals that states with the same energy as the ground state must be excluded ( recall that in the `` defect '' cases , @xmath53 , the ground state of @xmath45 is @xmath6-fold degenerate @xcite ) .",
    "as it is discussed in some detail in the appendix , the perturbative corrections @xmath54 are given in terms of matrix elements ( on the unperturbed eigenbasis ) of the single boson operators at the cell boundaries : @xmath55 generally , such matrix elements must be evaluated numerically .",
    "however , the necessary computational effort is easily affordable even for cells comprising several sites , and not only at the lowest critical fillings .",
    "indeed the second order cell scpe result for the domain boundary relevant to the critical filling @xmath56 of a @xmath4-periodic superlattice requires the complete diagonalization of a @xmath4-site cell bh hamiltonian ( [ e : cbhh ] ) for the five total populations ranging from @xmath57 to @xmath58 .",
    "for instance , the most demanding operation to be faced when investigating the critical filling @xmath59 for a period 5 superlattice is the complete diagonalization of a matrix whose size is @xmath60 , which requires a negligible amount of time on a reasonably up - to - date personal computer .",
    "note that , in order to obtain more refined results for the same system , one can resort to more complex numerical methods , such as quantum monte carlo simulations .",
    "however , the necessarily finite realization of the superlattice addressed by the simulation must comprise a sufficiently large number of cells to provide a good approximation of the thermodynamic limit . since one expects that such number is of the order of the number of sites in a reasonably good finite - size realization of the one - dimensional homogeneous lattice , it is clear that even superlattices with a small periodicity are computationally quite demanding .",

    "( [ e : matel ] ) and the details of their derivation is given in the appendix .",
    "comparison with finite size exact results confirmed the correctness of our perturbative expansions .",
    "in this section the cell scpe technique is adopted in the study of the insulator domain borders for several one dimensional superlattices .",
    "these borders are standardly obtained as @xmath61 $ ] and plotted in the @xmath24-@xmath25 plane , where we recall that @xmath26 is a scaling factor for the superlattice hopping amplitudes ( i.e. @xmath62 ) . for a given value of @xmath26",

    "this can be appreciated in fig .",
    "[ f : qmc ] , where the domain borders of the half - filling insulating domain as obtained from cell scpe and quantum monte carlo simulations are compared .",

    "actually , cell scpe can be used to address the homogeneous lattice , setting @xmath74 . in this situation ,",

[ f:1d ] . of course , the cell scpe description of the homogeneous lattice can be performed considering larger `` unit cells '' . in general",
    ", the thermodynamic convergence of the result does not seem to be very fast with increasing cell size .",
    "however , we notice that cells as small as four sites provide results exhibiting the expected reentrant character of the insulating domain ( see inset of fig .",

    "furthermore , the comparison between the @xmath5 first and second order cell scpe results for the homogeneous lattice suggests that an improvement is more likely produced by an increase in the perturbative order rather than in the cell size . in this respect",

    "we mention that , in this particular case , cell scpe would provide results for much larger fillings at a negligible computational cost .",
