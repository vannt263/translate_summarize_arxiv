    "there is nothing wrong with this . in",
    "so doing we simply follow the opportunists motto `` _ ai nt broken  do nt fix it _ '' .",
    "it becomes mandatory , however , that we start _ exploring _ the lphd gift rather than simply _ exploiting _ it . to set up the quest",
    ", we have to turn now to the problematics of the _ non - perturbative _ domain : what is it , _ what do we know _ about it , and , more important still , _ what we dont_.",
    "there is a specific ( though not too narrow a ) class of qcd observables that taught us a thing or two about genuine non - perturbative effects in multiple production of hadrons in hard processes . among them",
    " the so - called _ event shapes _ which measure global properties of final states ( jet profiles ) in an inclusive manner .    in @xmath2 , for example , one defines    @xmath14    @xmath15    ( the two hemispheres in the jet - mass and transverse momentum component in broadening are defined with respect to the thrust axis . ) these and similar event shape observables are formally calculable in pqcd ( being collinear and infrared safe , cis ) but possess large non - perturbative @xmath16suppressed corrections .",
    "being perturbatively calculable does not imply , however , being insensitive to non - perturbative physics  @xcite .",
    "+     +    indeed to reconcile with the data the two - loop pqcd predictions for the means of two exemplary jet shapes ( shown by dotted lines ) one has to introduce , on the phenomenology side , @xmath17      the pqcd motivated `` theory '' of genuine non - perturbative effects in jet shapes ( about 8 years old and running ) predicts the above _ ratio _ to be @xmath18    the origin of power - suppressed corrections to cis observables can be linked with the mathematical property of badly convergent perturbative series , typical for field theories , known under the name of `` renormalons '' .",
    "the renormalon - based analysis is perfectly capable of controlling the _ ratios _ of power terms , mentioned above , but can say next to nothing about the",
    "_ absolute magnitude _ of such a correction . to address the latter issue , an additional hypothesis had to be invoked namely , that of the existence of an infrared - finite qcd coupling ( whatever this might mean ; a detailed discussion of the issue can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "the `` industry - standard '' way of fitting event - shape power corrections  @xcite exploits the idea that the power correction is driven by the np modification of the qcd coupling in the infrared .",
    "the leading np contribution to a given observable @xmath20 can be parametrized as [ eq : nppar ] = ^_i_0 ( _ ( m^2 ) - ( m^2 ) ) .",
    "the key features of this expression are as follows .",
    "* it contains a pt controlled observable dependent coefficient @xmath21 ; * the ( integer ) exponent @xmath22 determines sensitivity of a given observable to the ir momentum scales ; for the vast majority of event shapes one has _ linear _ damping , @xmath23 ; * one subtracts off @xmath24 , the fixed - order perturbative expansion of the coupling in order to avoid double counting .    the full answer for the case under interest , @xmath25 , takes the form [ eq : fullnp ] = a _ + b _ ^2 + c _ ( _ 0 - _ _ i ) with @xmath26 the _ first moment _ of the coupling in the infrared : @xmath27      to the best of my knowledge , the first semi - rigorous attempt to put ir finite @xmath28 at work in the pqcd context has been made in the pre - renormalon epoch , in the late 80s ",
    "early 90s , in the context of fragmentation of heavy quarks @xmath29 .",
    "thanks to @xmath30 , the inclusive fragmentation function @xmath31 becomes collinear finite and is formally pt - calculable .",
    "but only _ formally _ , since for large @xmath32-feynman , @xmath33 one hits the np domain  @xcite .",
    "however , it is this ",
    "the most interesting  region where the fragmentation function is sitting ! ( the `` leading heavy quark effect '' ) .",
    "fragmentation functions ( ffs ) , as well as space - like parton distributions ( sfs ) , are     + known to be ir safe : for soft gluons virtual corrections cancel against real radiation contributions .",
    "this cancellation , however , breaks down at the edge of the phase space , and the distributions acquire typical dl sudakov suppression factors . here",
    "the observable becomes sensitive to soft gluons  those very beasts that are the first to enter the np domain . as a result",
    ", the ff gets a np power suppressed @xmath34 correction , _ quantifiable in terms of the ir coupling_.      thus , one has to compare next - to - leading pt + np predictions to data , fitting for @xmath35 and @xmath26 ( ir - average coupling ) in , in a hope to see that both @xmath19 and @xmath26 will turn out to be _ independent of the observable_.    the _ power - corrections - to - event - shapes _ business underwent quite an evolution .",
    "its dramatic element was largely due to impatience of experimenters who were too fast to feast on theoretical predictions before those could possibly reach a `` _ well - done _ ''",
    "cooking status .",
    "the new ( pt - obtainable ) coefficients @xmath36 in evolved with time as shown by the following charts and figures elaborated by g.p .",
    "salam @xcite .    [ 9596 ] : +    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ 01 ] : + finite hadron mass effects were recently taken care of by salam and wicke @xcite .",
    "their analysis called for special attention to be paid to the definition of observables at the hadron level , so as to ensure that hadron masses do not lead to trivial kinematic contributions that break universality .",
    "the same technology turned out to be applicable to event shape _ distributions _ , @xmath37 . here",
    "the genuine np physics manifests itself , basically , in _ shifting _ the corresponding pt spectra , in @xmath38 variable , by an amount proportional to @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "distributions turned out to be an important addition to the menu .",
    "firstly , to study functions is more informative and revealing than numbers .",
    "secondly , _",
    "distributions _ are two - parameter objects and they do nt allow essential np contributions to be hidden under the carpet by rg - improving pt series , as the _ means _ apparently do  @xcite .",
    "last but not least , it was the studies of _ event shape distributions _ that allowed theorists to better understand what they have been doing , thanks to pedagogical lessons theorists were taught by those impatient colleagues experimenters .",
    "in particular , theoretical understanding of the physics of np effects in jet broadening distributions which revealed a delicate np ",
    "pt interplay was triggered by the deep study of the problem pioneered by the jade group  @xcite .",
    "np effects aside , a purely perturbative part of the event shape distributions analysis is not peanuts either .",
    "all order resummation of logarithmically enhanced contributions was gradually carried out , at the next to leading order , for a vast number of observables  multi - jet cross sections , thrust , @xmath39 parameter , jet broadenings , various aplanarity characteristics of three - jet events ( like @xmath40 parameter , @xmath41 ) etc .",
    " first in @xmath2 annihilation and then also in dis , drell  yan processes and ( partially ) in the hadron  hadron collisions environment .",
    "this laborious business ( with an average of @xmath42 1 observable per paper ) turned out to be a very _ error - prone _ one as well .",
    "curiously , among `` professional resummers '' , only about @xmath43 can say that _ all _ their final results were correct to the accuracy claimed .",
    "it should be noted that such a large yield of `` wrong papers '' ( or rather of `` authors who erred '' ) is mostly due to one singular reason : a new previously overlooked class of nllo corrections that hit specifically the so - called _ non - global observables _ recently uncovered and baptized by mrinal dasgupta and gavin salam  @xcite .",
    "the good news is , one does not need theorists anymore anyway .",
    "the * c*omputer * a*utomated * e*xpert * s*emi-*a*nalytical * r*esummation package has been developed by andrea banfi , gavin salam and giulia zanderighi that will analyse for you any observable you might fancy to invent , find out whether this observable is legitimate ( collinear and infrared safe and global ) and spit out the nllo resummed prediction  @xcite . implementing the matching with exact low order matrix element calculations is underway  @xcite and incorporating leading power suppressed np effects is planned .",
    "theory &  phenomenology of @xmath16 suppressed effects in event shape observables , both in @xmath2 annihilation and dis , pointed at the _ average _ value of the infrared coupling @xmath44 as the recent analysis by dasgupta and salam shows  @xcite , the expected universality holds within a reasonable @xmath45 margin .",
    "the universality hypothesis is the key ingredient of the game : the new np parameter @xmath46 must inherit the _ universal nature _ of the qcd coupling itself .",
    "let us remark that the characteristic value of the typical pt expansion parameter @xmath47 turns out to be numerically small , @xmath48 ( which may open intriguing possibilities ) .",
    "moreover , it is comfortably above the so - called critical value of the ir coupling that is necessary to trigger the _ super - critical light quark confinement _ mechanism suggested by v.  gribov  @xcite ( for a recent review of , and around , the gribov programme of attacking colour confinement see  @xcite ) .",
    "it should be said that some recent analyses present a less positive picture of universality .",
    "caution is needed in making strong claims . in @xmath2 ,",
    "the majority of the analyses did not take finite hadron - mass effects into proper consideration ; some fits look contradictory between different experiments ( notably for @xmath49 ) ; two specific observables ( those that select a wide / heavy hemisphere , @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) seem to misbehave , and probably require further theoretical insight ; the potentially powerful technique of examining events with a hard final - state photon , so as to reduce the effective hadron cms energy and provide a lever arm in @xmath52 , is marred by the use of an incorrect assumption of factorisation of the qcd and qed matrix elements ( this is especially of concern for mean values , since they are dominated by hard , non - factorising , emissions ) . in dis ,",
    "most mean values seem to lead to a highish value for @xmath19 , especially for @xmath53 ( which also has an uncomfortably low @xmath26 value ) , for reasons that are not yet understood ; at the same time the usually very tricky broadening measure seems to behave properly , even in the distribution .    from the above it",
    "is clear that the universality hypothesis still remains to be definitively ( dis)proved , with open issues both experimentally and theoretically . to better understand the physics of non - perturbative effects in jets , it is mandatory to extend the studies to multi - jet final - states , not only in @xmath2 and dis , but also , just as importantly , in hadron - hadron scattering .",
    "ours are the times of _ a new hope_. on the practice side , it is due to the full swing operation of the rhic heavy ion facility at brookhaven .",
    "it took off / over the cern sps programme which had already supplied us with a number of puzzles .",
    "lead or gold , a bunch of intriguing phenomena have been observed in @xmath54 and @xmath55 high energy collisions . to name but a few ,",
    "* large-@xmath56 pion yield gets strongly _ suppressed _ in central collisions of heavy nuclei ; * back flowing ( recoiling ) jets disappear  get _ washed away _ ;",
    "* relative yields of strange mesons and baryons steadily increases with the number of collisions tending to `` equilibrate '' three quark flavours ; * leading baryons disappear from the fragmentation region ( `` stopping '' ) ; * central production of secondary baryons catches up with ( if not takes over ) that of mesons at @xmath57 .      on the theory side it is becoming more and more clear that _ small distances _ emerge naturally in the multiple scattering environment . treating physics that looks a priori _ soft _ , such as inelastic diffraction off nuclei  @xcite , medium induced gluon radiation  @xcite , various phenomena that one gathers under the banner of the colour glass condensate ( cgc ) picture  @xcite",
    ", one observes that the hardness scale that characterizes these ( and similar ) process grows invariably as [ eq : nucl ] q^2a^1/3 .",
    "a short sketch is due to illustrate this important point .",
    "consider for example a non - destructive high energy hadron ",
    "nucleus interaction known as _",
    "diffraction_. to muddle through a thick target without causing much damage ( inelastic breakup of the target ) , our projectile should interact weakly , be rather _",
    "transparent_. since the incident hadron is a composite object , this can be achieved by selecting _",
    "compact _ configurations with relatively small separation between valence quarks in the impact parameter space , ( * b * ) _ s^2|*b*|^2 .",
    "the `` transparency '' condition , @xmath58 then gives [ eq : lpt ] q^2",
    "1/ |*b*|^2 _ ^2l ( with @xmath59 the target thickness and @xmath60 the nuclear density ) .",
    "a pion in such a squeezed configuration will fragment in the final state into two quark jets with _",
    "large _ transverse momenta @xmath61 thus _ illuminating colour transparency _  @xcite .",
    "pion dissociation into two jets has been recently observed by the fermilab e-791 experiment  @xcite which verified jet energy , transverse momentum and @xmath62 dependences predicted by qcd .",
    "a very similar structure of the characteristic scale emerges in the problem of medium induced _ transverse momentum broadening _ and a closely related induced _",
    "gluon radiation _",
    "( the lpm effect , see below ) .",
    "here the relation mirroring is expressed in terms of the so - called _ transport coefficient _ [ eq : lpmscale ] q^2 = l ; = = q_^2 d(q_^2 ) _ . finally , within the cgc approach to high energy phenomena in heavy ion interactions _ the same _ characteristic parameter appears  @xcite under the name of `` saturation scale '' @xmath63 .    to conclude",
    ", the gift seems to be putting things under tighter pqcd control , shifting the emphasis towards underlying ( perturbative ) quark  gluon physics .",
    "a paradoxical situation emerges : on the other hand , the number of puzzles is steadily increasing in scattering of / off nuclei ; on the other hand , these phenomena have a good reason to be under the jurisdiction of pqcd .",
    "abundant puzzles and paradoxes constitute the best imaginable setup for the theory as they provide potential ( or rather potential gradient  the field strength ) for a revolutionary breakthrough .",
    "jets  the subject of this talk  are to play a key rle in this quest .",
    "one of the difficult questions of the physics of heavy ion collisions is the question of _ scaling_. to be able to state that `` _ new _ '' physics manifests itself we better know what is to be expected if the physics were `` _ old _ '' ? how to compare the quantity one measures in @xmath55 ( or @xmath54 ) collisions with the one _ simply rescaled _ from an elementary @xmath10 interaction ?",
    "it is in this harmlessly looking `` simply rescaled '' that the devil resides .",
    "should a given observable in @xmath55 interactions scale with the number of _ participating nucleons _",
    "( which may be as large as @xmath64 ) or instead as the number of elementary nucleon  nucleon collisions ( @xmath65 ) ?",
    "it is common wisdom to expect _ hard _ interactions to scale as @xmath66 and _ soft _ phenomena  as @xmath67 .",
    "nothing would be easier than to drown , without trace , in the discussion of what is soft and what is hard , how hard is hard etc .",
    "since the purpose of this talk is to build up tension rather than help to release it , let me introduce more confusion into this ( nuclear ) matter .",
    "this is easy to do by recalling the qcd pattern of gluon radiation induced by multiple scattering of a coloured projectile in the qcd medium . the structure of the inclusive spectrum of medium - induced gluon radiation looks as follows : [ eq : lpm ] , ^2 let us remark that we should have expected this weird `` 1.5 pomeron '' yield from the naive chain consideration already , since it is _ three _ quark chains that develop in course of independent fragmentation of the valence quarks of the broken proton ( while one would need _ four _ to picture two cut pomerons ) .",
    "qcd scenario of hadroproduction being due to coherent gluon accompaniment seems to _ invalidate _ the multi - pomeron exchange picture .",
    "this striking statement is , however , as true as it is not new .",
    "recall the good old amati - fubini - stanghellini puzzle .",
    "successive scatterings of a single parton    in the complex angular momentum plane ( reggeon loops ) . instead",
    ", it is the _",
    "mandelstam construction _ that generates `` reggeon cuts '' , with pomerons attached not to one but to separate  _ coexisting _  partons .",
    "thus , to have @xmath66-gluon exchange produce ( up to ) @xmath66 times enhanced density of the hadron plateau ( @xmath66 cut pomerons ) , one must be able to find @xmath66 _ independent _ ( incoherent ) _ partons _ inside the projectile .    the answer to whether the final hadron yield follows the collision or participant scaling depends on the question ( as it does so often in quantum mechanics ) .",
    "it depends on what are we looking at and becomes the question of _",
    "resolution_.    to be able to absorb @xmath66 gluons _ incoherently _ in order to give rise to @xmath66 pomeron chains ( collision scaling ) , our projectile has to have sufficient `` colour capacity ''",
    ". we must compare the number of collisions @xmath66 with the number of _ resolved partons _ inside the projectile , @xmath68 \\>+\\ > \\mbox{[valence stuff]}.\\ ] ] by increasing @xmath69 ( transverse momentum of the registered hadrons @xmath70 ) and/or by moving further away from the projectile in rapidity ( increasing @xmath71 ) we will gradually get rid of colour coherence ( @xmath67 scaling ) and approach the @xmath66 scaling",
    ".      in the framework of the standard multi - pomeron picture one includes _",
    "final state interactions _ to explain spectacular heavy ion phenomena like @xmath72 suppression , enhancement of strangeness production and alike .",
    "`` final state interaction '' is a synonym to `` non - independent fragmentation '' ( one hears about cross - talking pomerons , overlapping strings , `` string ropes '' ,  , you name it ) .    from the point of view of the _ colour dynamics _ , in @xmath54 and @xmath55 environments we face an intrinsically new , unexplored , question : after the pancakes separate , at each impact parameter we have the colour field strength corresponding to @xmath73 `` strings '' .",
    "how does the vacuum break up in such a  _ stronger than usual _  colour field ?",
    "imagine we stretch a high density field ( pull apart over - charged capacitor plates ) .",
    "will it go like     + * boooom *    or rather     + * ta - ta  ta  ta * ?",
    "the first scenario corresponds to four cut pomerons ( quadruple multiplicity but standard particle abundances ) . in the second one vacuum break - up",
    "occurs at _ smaller distances _ and therefore will provide , in particular , a free _ strangeness _ lunch ( together with other sweet cookies ) .",
    "jets as a pt instrument did the job they ve been asked to perform : to verify the nature of the fundamental fields of the underlying qft by measuring quark and gluon spins , to establish @xmath74 as the true qcd gauge group .",
    "jets did more than that : studying inclusive energy spectra of ( relatively soft ) hadrons _ inside _ jets , and soft hadron multiplicity flows _ in - between _ jets taught us an important lesson , or rather have sent us a hint , about the non - violent nature of hadronization ( `` _ soft confinement _ '' ) .",
    "on the nuclear side , jets stemming from diffractive hadron dissociation on nuclei reveal the internal small - distance structure of hadron projectiles ; jets that are produced in , and muddle through , the colour soup left behind head - on collisions of heavy nuclei bear information about new peculiar qcd media ( `` _ jet quenching _ '' ) .",
    "jets  their appearance , disappearance , internal structure ( particle abundances , shape observables , angular profiles , etc . )  are steadily becoming a non - perturbative tool for elucidating the physics of hadronization .",
