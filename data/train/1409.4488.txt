    "soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) and anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) are widely recognized to be magnetars @xmath0 highly magnetized isolated neutron stars @xcite .",
    "compared to radio pulsars , the magnetic fields of magnetars are at least @xmath1 times stronger , i.e. , up to @xmath2 g . persistent and bursting emissions from these sources are well explained by the dissipation of their ultra - strong magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "in addition to persistent emissions and short duration bursts , the most spectacular and perplexing phenomenon associated with magnetars is the giant flare .",
    "the peak luminosity during this event is over @xmath3 times higher than the eddington luminosity of a typical neutron star , releasing total energy of @xmath4erg @xcite . how the magnetic energy of giant flare is stored and released",
    "still remains a puzzling question and is now under extensive debate @xcite .",
    "two discrepant physical models are put forward to explain the giant flare .",
    "the main distinction lies in the location of the magnetic energy build - up prior to the eruptive outbursts : in the crust @xcite or in the magnetosphere @xcite . in the crust model , the giant flare",
    "is considered to be initiated by a sudden untwisting of the neutron star s internal magnetic field .",
    "the resulting magnetic stress variations lead to fracture of the crust and trigger violent outbursts @xcite .",
    "however , recent calculation shows that crust model has certain difficulties in explaining giant flares @xcite .",
    "alternative models , i.e. , magnetospheric models have been established to explain the magnetic energy storage and eruptive outbursts related to magnetar giant flares @xcite . in such models ,",
    "the magnetic energy is thought to accumulate quasi - statically in the magnetosphere with the neutron star surface gradual variations .",
    "once the system evolves to a critical state , the flux rope would erupt suddenly on a rapid dynamical timescale , which is consistent with the short rise timescale of giant flare , @xmath5ms @xcite .",
    "note that the energy release timescale of the giant flare is much shorter than the energy accumulation timescale .",
    "such a distinctive timescale contrast brings about an interesting question .",
    "how could the long timescale energy buildup process lead to an abrupt energy release on a dynamical timescale ? to answer this question ,",
    "we have attempted to construct a catastrophic flux rope eruption model to explain the initiation of the giant flare @xcite .",
    "the authors showed that , with the quasi - static variations at the magnetar surface , either crust motions or flux injections , the flux rope would experience a quasi - static evolution . once approaching a critical height , the flux rope would erupt due to the loss of equilibrium .",
    "the catastrophic feature gives a natural solution to the above question .",
    "the magnetic energy is built up gradually in magnetosphere before reaching the critical point . upon the critical point where the flux rope is ready to erupt , the magnetic energy accumulated in previous evolution",
    "is expected to be released on a dynamical timescale . in these flux rope eruption models",
    ", what we do know is that there indeed exists a critical point along the equilibrium curve and the flux rope would lose its equilibrium and erupts when it reaches this critical point .",
    "however , we are still not sure about the flux rope s subsequent behavior after the catastrophic eruption , which could be either quasi - static or dynamic responses .",
    "it is well known that magnetic reconnection plays a crucial role in the magnetic energy dissipations @xcite , which is important for both magnetars and rotation - driven pulsars , especially for the crab nebula flares in recent observation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the secondary plasmoid instability is also expected to take place in the cs @xcite .",
    "the plasmoid ejection induced reconnection process could probably lead to fast variabilities .",
    "it has been hypothesized that a current sheet , where magnetic reconnection could naturally take place , can be generated in the magnetosphere @xcite . in our flux rope eruption model ,",
    "detailed calculations show that * when * the flux rope becomes unstable , the cs is indeed created in the magnetosphere @xcite .",
    "the formation of current sheet and subsequent magnetic reconnection would lead to rapid magnetic field dissipation and powerful release of magnetic energy .",
    "the formation of current sheet results in a considerable topological change in the magnetic field configuration .",
    "when a current sheet is present , the global structure of magnetosphere becomes a rather complex mixed boundary value problem .",
    "we have figured out a numerical scheme to construct the magnetospheric field with a current sheet .",
    "details will be further discussed in the following sections .",
    "the pulse profile of the 1998 aug 27 event observed from sgr 1900 + 14 indicates that in the vicinity of star , the magnetic geometry was far more complicated compared to a dipole and higher multi - poles may be involved @xcite . during the birth of magnetars , electric currents are formed within the magnetar interior .",
    "these currents slowly push out and generate magnetic active regions , shown as multipolar regions , on the magnetar surface .",
    "these multipolar magnetic fields may also well affect the radiative emission properties of the magnetars @xcite .",
    "in @xcite , hereafter paper i , we study the flux rope eruption model in the multipolar background field .",
    "the energetics of this model is carefully investigated .",
    "it is found that the accumulated free magnetic energy in this model could be sufficient to drive a giant flare , which releases energy about @xmath6 of the total magnetic energy of neutron star in observations @xcite .",
    "however , we did not consider effects of the current sheet in paper i. in this paper , we extends our previous calculation by including the effects of current sheet .",
    "new features introduced by the current sheet are further investigated and their astrophysical implications are discussed in this paper .    the magnetic energy release associated with catastrophic state transitions may account for the giant flare itself .",
    "but observations showed that , large scale radio afterglow ( @xmath7pc ) were also detected following the giant flares on 1998 aug 27 from sgr 1900 + 14 and on 2004 dec 27 from sgr 1806 - 20 .",
    "the radio afterglow indicates that there are relativistic plasma escaping from the central magnetar after the violent outbursts @xcite .",
    "the radio afterglow remains a puzzle for the flux rope eruption model @xcite .",
    "this is because , after the catastrophic loss of equilibrium , the flux rope would reach another stable equilibrium state and evolve quasi - statically later on .",
    "however , the observed radio afterglow implies dynamically escaping plasma , which is hard to be explained by our previous model .",
    "fortunately , we find an interesting behavior of the flux rope - catastrophic escape .",
    "if the flux distribution on the surface involves higher order multipoles , upon the loss of equilibrium point , the flux rope can not obtain a new equilibrium state , but escape dynamically to infinity .",
    "catastrophic escape of the flux rope may naturally explain both the giant flare and the radio afterglow of sgr1806 - 20 @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we introduce the model of multipolar magnetosphere containing a flux rope as well as a current sheet accompanied . the numerical method to handle both the flux rope and the current sheet in a global solution of magnetosphere",
    "is described in details in section 3 .",
    "examples of the equilibrium curve of the system and two types of catastrophic behavior after loss of equilibrium are presented in section 4 . in section 5 , the energetics of our model and the effects of the flux rope s minor radius on flux rope eruptions are discussed .",
    "conclusions and discussions are provided in section 6 .",
    "the magnetosphere is magnetically dominated and the pressure and inertia of the plasma can be neglected @xcite .",
    "this provides a rather neat and clean description of the magnetosphere , in which the highly magnetized plasma can be assumed in a force - free state , i.e. , @xmath8 .",
    "the model here distinguishes itself from that in paper i in that an additional component , the current sheet , is included .      as in paper",
    "i , we consider a toroidal and helically twisted flux rope embedded in magnetosphere .",
    "the magnetic fields inside flux rope and those outside it should be treated separately . inside flux rope , the magnetic fields are considered to be generated by a net current @xmath9 carried by the flux rope .",
    "we adopt the force - free solution @xcite to represent the magnetic field and current density distribution inside flux rope .",
    "the height of the toroidal flux rope is denoted as a major radius @xmath10 , and the size of it is denoted as a minor radius @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "note that the magnetic twist is well - confined inside the flux rope .",
    "our model is different from the global magnetic twist model considered in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the axisymmetric magnetic field @xmath12 outside the flux rope can be expressed in spherical coordinates @xmath13 as follows , @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the magnetic stream function .",
    "note that @xmath17 and @xmath18 are unit vectors respectively in radial and latitudinal direction .",
    "we express the force - free condition as the inhomogeneous grad - shafranov ( gs ) equation .",
    "explicitly , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the speed of light . on the right hand side , @xmath21 represents the current density induced by the toroidal flux rope , which is treated as a circular ring current of , @xmath22 , where , @xmath9 , as mentioned above , designates the electric current carried by the flux rope @xcite .    according to paper i ,",
    "when the helically twisted flux rope evolves to a critical state , it would lead to a catastrophic eruption .",
    "a current sheet would naturally form during the eruption @xcite .",
    "this current sheet is thought to connect the magnetar surface and the flux rope .",
    "obviously , the appearance of the current sheet would change the topology of the magnetospheric field .",
    "we will focus on new solutions with current sheet to the gs equation in this paper .",
    "the numerical method to handle the current sheet will be further discussed in the following sections .",
    "three physical boundary conditions needs to be satisfied to get the self - consistent global magnetospheric field with a current sheet .",
    "the first boundary condition , i.e. , @xmath23 for @xmath24 , can be satisfied trivially ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the second boundary is located at the magnetar surface @xmath25 .",
    "following paper i , multipolar boundary conditions are adopted at magnetar surface , i.e. , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a constant parameter which has dimension of magnetic flux and the dimensionless variable @xmath28 represents the magnitude of surface magnetic flux . here",
    "@xmath29 depicts the angular dependence of the stream function at the magnetar surface , which must be chosen properly according to the observations of magnetars .",
    "although it is widely believed that magnetic field configuration of magnetar is basically a dipole , observations showed that the geometry of magnetic field involves multipoles in the vicinity of surface @xcite . to model the multipolar field",
    ", we assume that the angular dependence of the stream function is contributed by a dipolar component plus a high order multipolar component . specifically , @xmath30 where first term @xmath31 denotes the dipolar component and the latter term with strength coefficient @xmath32 represents the contribution of high - order multipoles .",
    "properties of this boundary condition has been discussed in paper i. we do not repeat them here .",
    "the third boundary is introduced by the current sheet .",
    "the current sheet is represented by a horizontal thick solid line in fig .",
    "1 . the current sheet lies at @xmath33 , the equatorial plane , and covers the radial range between @xmath34 and @xmath35 , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 stand for the magnetar radius and the tip of the current sheet , respectively .",
    "the existence of the equatorial current sheet requires a third boundary condition to be fulfilled , which requires @xmath36 where @xmath37 denotes the constant value of stream function @xmath38 along the current sheet . the value of @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the value of @xmath29 at @xmath41 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath42 according to the surface boundary condition we adopt above . due to this additional boundary condition at the current sheet , the gs equation ( [ gs ] )",
    "must be solved in a non - trivial way numerically .",
    "we have figured out an appropriate numerical scheme to get the global configuration of the magnetospheric field , which will be further discussed in the following section .",
    "the most distinctive feature of our model is that , in addition to the flux rope with internal helically twisted magnetic field inside , a current sheet is incorporated . in this case",
    ", the solution to the gs equation constitutes a problem with mixed boundary value .",
    "the current sheet provides another boundary to be considered apart from the magnetar surface .",
    "our numerical strategy is the domain decomposition .    in fig.[diag ]",
    ", we give a schematic illustration of the magnetosphere .",
    "the inner thick solid semi - circle in radius of @xmath34 represents the magnetar surface and the thick dashed circle denotes the flux rope . the thin dashed semi - circle with radius , @xmath10 , which goes through the center of flux rope , represents its height measured from the magnetar center . the current sheet , lying on the equatorial plane , is shown as thick horizontal solid line .",
    "note that the lower tip of the current sheet is connected to the magnetar surface .",
    "the upper tip is located at @xmath35 .",
    "it is obvious that the current sheet divides the global force - free magnetosphere into three regions , labelled as region i , ii , and iii , respectively .",
    "the flux rope lies in region iii and the current sheet separates region i and region ii . to be more specific , region",
    "i covers the region @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "region ii is symmetric to region i and covers the region @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "region iii indicates the area @xmath47 and @xmath48",
    ". we can readily construct separate local solutions in these different regions .",
    "however , we have to meld all the local solutions in different regions together to establish a self - consistent global magnetosphere .      the general solution for the stream function in region i can be written as @xcite @xmath49 \\ ,   \\ 0 \\leqslant\\mu \\leqslant 1 \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath37 is already defined in equation ( [ boundarycs ] ) , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are legendre polynomials , and the constant coefficients @xmath52 and @xmath53 will be specified following the numerical strategy in appendix a. it is worthwhile to note that in the above equation , only legendre polynomials with odd orders are involved .",
    "based on the above explicit solution , it is readily to know that current sheet boundary condition , equation ( [ boundarycs ] ) , can be trivially satisfied . when it comes to the magnetar surface boundary condition equation ( [ bcsurf ] ) , since the magnetosphere is symmetric to the equatorial plane , we only need to consider half of the magnetar s surface , i.e. , the northern hemisphere . in other words ,",

    "because the solution in region ii is symmetric to that in region i , we do not reiterate on the explicit form of @xmath61 . in the computational domain of region iii where the flux rope is embedded ,",
    "the general solution of the magnetic stream function is of the following form ( yu 2012 ) @xmath62\\ \\left[\\frac{p_{2i}(\\mu)-p_{2i+2}(\\mu)}{4i+3}\\right]\\ , \\ ] ] where the piecewise continuous function @xmath63 is defined as in paper i , the coefficients @xmath64 s can be determined in terms of the current carried by the flux rope , and @xmath65 s are coefficients to be fixed in terms of the matching condition discussed in the following section .",
    "it is interesting to note that only legendre polynomials with even orders , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , are involved in the above equation .",
    "this is different from the fact that only legendre polynomials with odd orders appear in equation ( [ psii ] ) .",
    "a global solution of magnetosphere can be constructed once local solutions , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 , in three different computational regions , i , ii , iii , are obtained . in other words , once the coefficients @xmath52 s , @xmath53 s , @xmath64 s , and @xmath65 s are self - consistently determined , a global magnetosphere with both flux rope and current sheet can be naturally established . in the following section , we will discuss the numerical scheme to self - consistently determine these coefficients in greater details .      up to now",
    ", we have explicitly obtained the local solutions , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 , in region i , ii , and iii , respectively . these local solutions",
    "have distinctive forms in these regions .",
    "to meld them into a consistent global solution , we need to seamlessly match these local solutions . physically speaking",
    ", the global magnetic field should be continuous throughout the entire magnetosphere , which is trivially satisfied within each regions .",

    "the global solution must satisfy the following constraints to smoothly connect the magnetic field between region i ( ii ) and region iii , viz .",

    "there are two requirements for the external equilibrium constraint .",
    "the first requirement is the condition of force - balance .",
    "it is satisfied when the magnetic field induced by the current carried by the flux rope , @xmath93 @xcite , which provides an outward force , is balanced by the external magnetic field @xmath94 , which provides an inward force .",

    ". the surface magnetic flux would gradually decrease if new magnetic fluxes with opposite polarity are injected from the magnetar interior .",
    "the flux rope would quasi - statically evolves in stable equilibrium states .",
    "we show an example of the equilibrium curve of the system in fig.[m3 ] , which describes the variation of the height of flux rope @xmath10 with the surface magnetic flux of the central neutron star @xmath28 .",
    "estimation of @xcite suggests that the typical radius of a flux rope is around @xmath99 @xmath100 . for a magnetar with radius @xmath101 @xmath100",
