    "the properties of positronium , the bound state made of an electron and a positron , provide some of the most precise tests of qed @xcite .",
    "both the experimental @xcite and theoretical considerations have reach a very high level of precision , requiring for the latter the computations of many - loop diagrams ( @xcite-@xcite , and references cited there ) .    in the present note",
    ", we will address one particular aspect of the current qed bound state models , namely the factorization between the bound state dynamics and the decay processes @xcite .",
    "as explained in @xcite , the present study is motivated by the recurrent contradiction between standard positronium models and low s theorem @xcite .",
    "our goal is to show that binding energy effects can not be treated perturbatively if sensible theoretical results are sought at the present level of precision .",
    "the central result of the present note is a simple method that allows such an exact non - perturbative treatment of binding energy effects .",
    "the lowest order results we shall obtain sum infinite class of diagrams , usually expanded perturbatively .",
    "also , our method is formally relativistic and has a correct analytical behavior .    in section @xmath1 ,",
    "our simple method is introduced by a computation of the rate for parapositronium to two photons , and then demonstrated in general . in the next sections ,",
    "we apply our result to various decay modes chosen to illustrate some specific aspects .",
    "first , to show explicitly the contradiction between low s theorem and binding energy perturbative expansions , we consider the paradimuonium ( @xmath2-@xmath3 , a bound @xmath4 @xcite ) decay to @xmath5 .",
    "then , interesting connections between bound state decay amplitudes and the photon vacuum polarization are exemplified by the orthodimuonium decay @xmath6-@xmath7 .",
    "the fourth section is devoted to the interesting decay mode orthopositronium to three photons .",
    "we obtain the differential spectrum and decay rate for any value of the binding energy , from the amplitude for light - by - light scattering .",
    "we discover that both the spectrum and rate are highly sensitive to the binding energy when it is approaching zero .",
    "the implication of this result is the well - known slow convergence of the orthopositronium radiative correction perturbative series .    in the fifth section",
    ", we present two extensions of our method .",
    "the application to orthopositronium @xmath8th radial excitations @xmath6-@xmath9 is introduced by recomputing the decay rate @xmath10-@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "finally , it is shown how the positronium hyperfine splitting , i.e. the mass difference of the ortho- and parapositronium , can be obtained from vacuum polarization graphs through finite mass renormalizations .",
    "positronium amplitudes are built as loop amplitudes : the positronium couples to a virtual @xmath0 loop , to which a given number of photons are attached .",
    "the coupling of the positronium to its constituents is essentially determined by the positronium wavefunction . in the following , we will take a form factor inspired from the schrdinger wavefunction , i.e. a form factor containing the effects of the exchange of coulomb photons among the constituents ( in the ladder approximation ) @xcite .",
    "a very simple method can be used to compute such loop amplitudes : _ any lowest order loop amplitude with a coulomb form factor is the derivative with respect to the positronium mass of the corresponding point - like amplitude_. by point - like amplitude is meant the loop amplitude obtained by replacing the complicated coulomb form factor for the bound state by a constant from factor . symbolically , for parapositronium ( orthopositronium ) decay to an even ( odd ) number of real or virtual photons ,",

    "this means that one could , at least in principle , express the decay rate as non - perturbative binding energy corrections times a rapidly converging perturbation series of radiative corrections .",
    "this is exactly what we have achieved to order @xmath35 .",
    "the proof of ( [ derivative ] ) is straightforward using the language of dispersion relations .",
    "indeed , the point - like loop amplitude can be computed from its imaginary part @xmath43 using an unsubstracted dispersion relation with @xmath44 : @xmath45 ( @xmath46 because @xmath47 ) .",
    "the schrdinger form factor accounting for the non - trivial coupling of the bound state to its constituent is of the form @xmath48 where one can recognize @xmath49 as the fundamental @xmath50 @xmath26-wave schrdinger momentum space wavefunction .",

    "the initial energy:@xmath52 the core of the derivative approach emerges from the observation that inserting @xmath53 in ( [ dispint ] ) is equivalent to taking the derivative with respect to @xmath54 @xmath55 which is the desired result .",
    "the case of other parapositronium decay channels , or orthopositronium decay modes is similarly treated ( simply replace @xmath56 by @xmath57 with @xmath58 the orthopositronium polarization vector ) .    as a first remark , we repeat here the conclusion of @xcite , which is that standard positronium result are recovered from the above dispersion integral ( [ dispint ] ) provided only the vertical cuts are taken into account in the imaginary part .",
    "this proves that some contributions are missed in those computations .",
    "for instance , in the case of @xmath2-@xmath59 , there is only the vertical cut , but this is not the case in general : if one of the photon is virtual , or if there is three or more photons in the final state , oblique cuts contribute ( see next sections ) .",
    "the second remark concerns the insertion of the form factor , not in feynman amplitudes , but directly into the dispersion integral .",
    "these two approaches are equivalent only in the punctual case ( consider the momentum flow through the form factor in each case ) .",
    "working at the level of dispersion relations is much more in the spirit of the bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "indeed , the wavefunction is extracted from the four - point green s function , i.e. in configurations with an off - shell bound state ( above threshold ) , and on - shell constituents:@xmath60% { bethsalp.eps}% } % % endexpansion\\ ] ] the picture shows that both bethe - salpeter and the dispersion integral ( [ dispint ] ) make use of the form factor @xmath53 with the same kinematical configuration ( diagrams with bremsstrahlung radiation off the electron lines are treated similarly ) .",

    "explicitly , the incompatibility of the two limits is obvious if @xmath72 is taken first @xmath83 mathematically , what these considerations show is that the limit @xmath79 does not exist at @xmath84 .",
    "consequences of this result were discussed in @xcite , but it should be clear that one of the main virtue of our approach is its non - perturbative treatment of @xmath42 , leading to correct photon spectra .    to close this section , we just mention that the second term of @xmath85 can be traced to the presence of oblique cuts in the imaginary part ( i.e. processes like @xmath2-@xmath86 times @xmath87 , see @xcite , @xcite ) .",

    "it is not surprising that our method does not reproduce exactly the above result , because we have neglected many diagrams ( like electron self - energy insertions for example ) , and because we used the lowest order non - relativistic binding energy @xmath206 and wavefunction @xmath207 as a basis . taken individually , the corrections of @xmath208 to the para- and orthopositronium masses are off by more than @xmath209 .",
    "on the other hand , the difference between both corrections , giving the hyperfine splitting , is surprisingly good .",
    "again , it seems that all the effects contained in the lowest order loop ( i.e. all the ladder coulomb photon exchanges ) suffice to account for most of the radiative corrections . in conclusion ,",
    "further studies of the application of our method to hyperfine splitting appear as necessary .",
    "we can characterize our method as a change of basis for perturbation theory : some binding effects are treated at all orders in @xmath42 , at each order in @xmath35 . with such non - perturbative results",
    ", the behavior of the usual expansion in the binding energy can be analyzed .",
    "_ _ we find that such expansions are problematic when soft - photons are present ( _ _ i.e .",
    "when a photon s energy is of the order of @xmath42 ) . in other words , expansions in the binding energy are incompatible with analyticity . in all cases ,",
    "unphysical contributions violating analyticity are subleading , being of the order of @xmath210 .",
    "however small , such effects become important in view of the precision achieved in both experimental and theoretical descriptions . in addition , standard positronium models neglect some contributions ( corresponding , in the context of dispersion relations , to oblique cuts contributions to the imaginary part of the loop diagrams ) .",
    "therefore , they can not be correct at order @xmath211 for decay processes @xcite .    in our view",
    ", obtaining qed bound state amplitudes from relativistic point - like amplitudes has many advantages .",
    "this may lead to simplifications in the computation of higher order corrections , especially concerning issues of gauge invariance and infrared divergence .",
    "for instance , two - loop graphs will introduce some @xmath212 and @xmath213 corrections ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "we should point - out , however , that the technique of taking the derivative will not work as it stands for higher order diagrams , because of binding graphs , and some refinements will be necessary .    as a final comment , the present method can lead to interesting advances in quarkonium physics .",
    "of course , some knowledge of the quarkonium wavefunctions will be necessary .",
    "no matter the form of these wavefunctions , it should be possible to expand them in the basis made of the coulomb wavefunction and its derivatives , to which the present method apply .",
    "this is left to further studies . for now , as a first result , it appear quite obvious that the ore - powell spectrum used as a lowest order approximation for the photon spectrum in the quarkonium inclusive decays into hadrons + photon is incorrect . if quarkonia were coulomb bound state , the spectrum would be the curve of ( [ figore ] ) with @xmath214 ( since @xmath215 and @xmath216 ) , i.e. a spectrum which is suppressed at high energy compared to the ore - powell one .",
    "qcd effects should not change much our conclusion .",
    "we think that the suppression at high energy observed by cleo @xcite is , at least in part , a manifestation of binding energy effects , giving us confidence in our results .",
