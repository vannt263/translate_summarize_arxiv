    "the observation nearly four decades ago that mesons are grouped in nonets , each characterized by unique values of @xmath20  spin ( @xmath21 ) , parity ( @xmath10 ) and charge conjugation ( @xmath22 ) quantum numbers  led to the development of the quark model . within this picture , mesons are bound states of a quark ( @xmath23 ) and antiquark ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the three light - quark flavors ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) suffice to explain the spectroscopy of most  but not all  of the lighter - mass mesons ( i.e. below 3  gev@xmath19 ) that do not explicitly carry heavy flavors ( charm or beauty ) .",
    "early observations yielded only those @xmath20 quantum numbers consistent with a fermion - antifermion bound state .",
    "the @xmath20 quantum numbers of a @xmath28 system with total quark spin , @xmath29 , and relative angular momentum , @xmath30 , are determined as follows : @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 . thus @xmath20 quantum numbers such as @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are not allowed and are called _",
    "exotic _ in this context .",
    "our understanding of how quarks form mesons has evolved within quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) and we now expect a richer spectrum of mesons that takes into account not only the quark degrees of freedom but also the gluonic degrees of freedom . gluonic mesons with no quarks ( _ glueballs _ ) are expected .",
    "these are bound states of gluons and since the quantum numbers of low - lying glueballs are not necessarily exotic , they should manifest themselves as extraneous states that can not be accommodated within @xmath38 nonets .",
    "indeed there is evidence for a glueball state @xcite based on overpopulation of the scalar nonet but identification is complicated since the observed states can be a mixture of a glueball and @xmath38 .",
    "excitations of the gluonic field binding the quarks can also give rise to so - called _ hybrid _ mesons that can be viewed as bound states of a quark , anti - quark and valence gluon ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "an alternative picture of hybrid mesons , one supported by lattice qcd , is one in which a gluonic flux tube forms between the quark and anti - quark and the excitations of this flux tube lead to so - called _ hybrid _ mesons @xcite .",
    "conventional @xmath38 mesons arise when the flux tube is in its ground state .",
    "some hybrid mesons can have a unique signature , exotic @xmath20 , and therefore the spectroscopy of exotic hybrid mesons is not complicated by possible mixing with conventional @xmath38 states . according to the flux - tube model @xcite and lattice gauge calculations @xcite ,",
    "one expects the lightest @xmath17 exotic hybrid to have a mass of about 1.9  gev@xmath19 .",
    "in contrast , calculations based on the mit bag model @xcite place the mass of the lightest @xmath15 hybrid meson at about 1.4  gev@xmath19 .",
    "the spectroscopy of exotic mesons provides an attractive starting point for the study of gluonic excitations .",
    "since flux tubes are thought to be responsible for the confinement mechanism in qcd , experimental information on this spectroscopy is of fundamental importance .",
    "after about two decades of experimental searches there have been reports of experimental observations of states with @xmath17 by the brookhaven e852 collaboration in @xmath40 interactions at 18  gev@xmath3 . one of these has a mass of ( @xmath41 )  mev@xmath19   and width of ( @xmath42 )  mev@xmath19  and decays into @xmath43 @xcite and another has a similar mass , ( @xmath44 )  mev@xmath19 , but a larger width,(@xmath45 )  mev@xmath19 , and decays into @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "the e852 collaboration also reported observation of another @xmath17 state with mass ( @xmath47 )  mev@xmath19and a width of ( @xmath48 )  mev@xmath19  decaying into @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "if an @xmath16 system is in a @xmath10 wave , the resulting @xmath20 quantum number combination is exotic ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "critical to the identification of this state is not only showing the presence of a @xmath10 wave , but also that the resulting line shape is consistent with a breit - wigner and that the phase motion of the @xmath10 , as determined by its interference with the dominant @xmath11 wave can not be due solely to the @xmath50 resonance . soon after the e852 report , the crystal barrel collaboration reported an exotic @xmath17 state produced in @xmath51 obtained by stopping antiprotons in liquid deuterium @xcite .",
    "they reported a mass of ( @xmath52 )  mev@xmath19   and a width of ( @xmath53 )  mev@xmath19 .",
    "a later analysis of @xmath54 supported this evidence for an exotic state @xcite .",
    "the first claim of an exotic meson decaying into @xmath18 with a mass of 1400  mev@xmath19  was made by the gams collaboration in the reaction @xmath55 @xcite but a later analysis by the group @xcite led to ambiguous results .",
    "the ves collaboration also presented evidence for a p - wave contribution in @xmath16 @xcite and at kek a claim was made for an exotic @xmath16 state @xcite as well but with a mass and width close to that of the @xmath13 and leakage from the dominant @xmath11 wave could not be excluded .",
    "indeed , in all the observations , the @xmath16 @xmath10 wave enhancements have cross sections that are substantially smaller than the dominant @xmath13 so this leakage , usually due to an imperfect understanding of experimental acceptance , is a source of concern . for example , an observed enhancement in the @xmath10 wave in the @xmath56 system at low mass was reported in references @xcite as being due to leakage . apart from these experimental issues , the interpretation of the nature of low - mass @xmath16 @xmath10 wave amplitude and phase motion should be guided by the principle of parsimony ",
    "less exotic interpretations must also be considered .",
    "this work presents a partial wave analysis ( pwa ) of the @xmath57 system produced in @xmath40 interactions at an incident momentum of 18  gev@xmath3  using the e852 apparatus . in this analysis both the @xmath58 and @xmath59",
    "are detected through their @xmath60 decays .",
    "the starting point uses data corresponding to the reaction @xmath61 .",
    "a subset of these data correspond to @xmath62 and the partial wave analysis of the @xmath63 system has been reported on in an earlier publication @xcite . here",
    "we present the pwa of data from @xmath64 .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath49 system , charge - conjugation @xmath22 is a good quantum number for the neutral @xmath57 system . in the e852 experiment",
    "the @xmath49 and @xmath57 systems have different systematics .",
    "the latter relies on measurements from an electromagnetic detector alone while the former also requires information from charged particle tracking in the forward direction .",
    "moreover , as will be discussed below , two resonances dominate the @xmath65 reaction ; the scalar ( @xmath9 wave ) @xmath12 and the tensor ( @xmath11 wave ) @xmath13 providing benchmarks for the pwa . in constrast ,",
    "only the @xmath13 is dominant in the @xmath66 reaction .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the experimental overview is presented in section 2 .",
    "event reconstruction and data selection are described in section 3 .",
    "the details of the pwa formalism and results are given in section 4 along with the criteria used to select the physical solution from the set of ambiguous solutions .",
    "in section 5 the results of leakage studies are presented . in section 6 the distributions in moments ( averages of spherical harmonics )",
    "are compared with moments calculated from the pwa solutions .",
    "fits to the moment distributions are also presented . in section 7 the mass and @xmath14 dependence of the pwa solutions are presented and discussed .",
    "in particular the @xmath14 distributions for the @xmath11 waves are described within the context of regge phenomenology .",
    "the conclusions are summarized in section 8 .",
    "the e852 apparatus @xcite was built around and included the multi - particle spectrometer ( mps ) at bnl .",
    "the data used for the analysis reported in this paper were collected in 1994 and 1995 using a nearly pure ( @xmath67 95% ) beam of negative pions of momentum 18.3  gev@xmath3 .",
    "a 30-cm - long liquid hydrogen target was surrounded by a cylindrical drift chamber @xcite and an array of thallium - doped csi crystals @xcite arranged in a barrel , all located inside the mps dipole magnet .",
    "drift chambers were used to track charged particles downstream of the target .",
    "two proportional wire chambers ( pwc s ) , downstream of the target , were used in requiring specific charged particle multiplicities in the event trigger . a 3000-element lead glass detector ( lgd ) @xcite measured the energies and positions of photons in the forward direction . the dimensions of the lgd matched the downstream aperture of the mps magnet .",
    "photons missing the lgd were detected by the csi array or by a lead / scintillator sandwich array ( dea ) downstream of the target and arranged around an aperture to allow for the passage of charged particles .",
    "the first level trigger required that the unscattered or elastically scattered beam not enter an arrangement of two small beam - veto scintillation counters located in front of the lgd .",
    "the next level of trigger required that there be no signal in the dea and no charged particles recorded in the cylindrical drift chamber surrounding the target or in the pwc s ( an all - neutral trigger ) . in the 1994 run all layers of the cylindrical drift chamber were used in the trigger requirement whereas in the 1995 run , only the outer layer was used .",
    "a common off - line analysis criterion required no hits in the cylindrical drift chamber .",
    "the final trigger requirement was a minimum deposition of electromagnetic energy in the lgd @xcite corresponding to 12  gev .",
    "the lgd is central to this analysis .",
    "the lgd was initially calibrated by moving each module into a monoenergetic electron beam .",
    "further calibration was performed by adjusting the calibration constant for each module until the width of the @xmath68 and @xmath69 peaks in the @xmath70 effective mass distribution was minimized .",
    "the calibration constants were also used for a trigger processor that did a digital calculation of energy deposited in the lgd and the effective mass of photons striking the lgd @xcite . a laser - based monitoring system allowed for tracking the gains of individual modules .",
    "studies were made of various algorithms for finding clusters of energies deposited by photons , including issues of photon - to - photon separation and position finding resolution .",
    "these are also described in reference @xcite .",
    "experiment e852 took data in 1994 and 1995 with an approximate seven - fold increase in statistics collected in 1995 compared to 1994 .",
    "the combined data sets taken in 1994 and 1995 contain approximately 70 million all - neutral triggered events . of these events ,",
    "approximately 13 million were found to have four photons in the lgd .",
    "figure [ scatter ] shows a scatterplot of one di - photon effective mass against the other di - photon combination in the event .",
    "there are clear indications of the presence of @xmath71 and @xmath18 events in the sample .",
    "the single clustering at @xmath72 = @xmath72 = 0.135  gev@xmath19is dominated by @xmath71 events and the two clusterings at @xmath72 = 0.135  gev@xmath19 , @xmath72 = 0.540  gev@xmath19  are dominated by @xmath18 events .",
    "studies were carried out comparing the 1994 and 1995 data sets for both @xmath71 and @xmath18 events . in each case distributions in the decay angles of the @xmath71 ( or @xmath18 ) system",
    "were studied in mass bins of 40  mev@xmath19  and in four bins of @xmath14 , where @xmath14 is the square of the momentum transferred from the beam @xmath7 to the outgoing @xmath73 system .",
    "a kolmogorov test measured the probability that the two distributions ( 1994 and 1995 data ) in each case were consistent with having been drawn from the same parent distribution .",
    "the conclusion of this study is that the 1994 and 1995 data sets are statistically indistinguishable .",
    "events consistent with the production of two @xmath68 s dominate the sample .",
    "the partial wave analysis of the @xmath71 events is presented in an unpublished thesis of j. gunter @xcite and in a previous paper @xcite .",
    "the identification of events from the reaction @xmath74 is described in the unpublished thesis of r. lindenbusch @xcite .",
    "the sample of 45,000 @xmath75 events was selected from the 13 million four photon events by imposing various analysis criteria .",
    "it was required that no charged particles were registered in the mps drift chambers or the cylindrical drift chamber surrounding the liquid hydrogen target .",
    "this cut was performed at the pre - reconstruction level and was based on total hit multiplicity .",
    "any event with a photon within 8 cm of the center of the beam hole or the outer edge of the lgd was removed .",
    "monte carlo studies were carried out to determine the @xmath76 criteria needed to select @xmath18 events and eliminate backgrounds from other processes , especially from @xmath71 events .",
    "events corresponding to @xmath71 , @xmath18 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 were generated and passed through detector simulation , reconstruction , kinematic fitting and other event selection software .",
    "the @xmath76 returned from kinematic fitting to the @xmath79 reaction hypothesis was required to be less than 7.8 ( 95% c.l . for a three - constraint fit ) .",
    "the two - constraint @xmath76 for the @xmath80 hypothesis ( no requirement that the missing mass be consistent with the neutron mass ) was required to be greater than 100 .",
    "it was found that this latter cut eliminated true @xmath81 events that have a poor fit to the @xmath82 hypothesis .",
    "a further demand was that none of the other final state hypotheses considered ( @xmath83 , @xmath84 ) had a better @xmath76 than that used to select the @xmath85 hypothesis .",
    "the final criterion was that the csi detector registered less than 20 mev , a cut which eliminated events with low - energy @xmath68 s .",
    "background studies @xcite estimated the non-@xmath58 background in the @xmath79 .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio varies from about @xmath86 in the @xmath87 mass region 1.2 to 1.5  gev@xmath19  to @xmath88 in the @xmath87 mass regions below this range and above this range up to 1.8  gev@xmath19 .",
    "the @xmath87 effective mass distribution is shown in figure [ m_and_t](a ) .",
    "the @xmath12 and @xmath13 states , one a scalar and the other a tensor , are clearly observed .",
    "the presence of both states is important for this analysis since it provides a basis , as will be discussed below , for selecting the physical solutions from among mathematically ambiguous solutions in doing the partial wave analysis .",
    "this distribution in @xmath87 effective mass is not corrected for the acceptance of the apparatus but the pwa procedure does take into account the effects of experimental acceptance .    the distribution in @xmath6 is shown in figure [ m_and_t](b ) .",
    "figure [ sidebands ] shows the four - photon effective mass distribution for events with a di - photon mass combination consistent with a @xmath89 and the other di - photon mass either below or above the @xmath58 mass region for a portion of the total four - photon sample .",
    "the resulting @xmath90 spectra do not show the enhancements at the @xmath12 and @xmath13 observed in the @xmath18 spectrum .",
    "a possible source of background in the @xmath18 in the @xmath12 mass region are events corresponding to production of the final state @xmath91 and in particular that subset corresponding to @xmath92 where the @xmath93 decays to @xmath94 .",
    "there events can enter the sample under study if one of the @xmath89 s escapes detection . from a monte carlo study of this sample @xcite based on a measurement of @xmath95 production in this experiment @xcite it",
    "is estimated that at most 10% of the events in the @xmath12 region are due to this background process .",
    "the acceptance in @xmath87 effective mass and @xmath6 was estimated by generating monte carlo events corresponding to the reaction @xmath75 .",
    "the acceptance functions as a function of @xmath18 effective mass are shown in figure [ accep_m_and_t ] .",
    "the acceptance in @xmath6 increases for @xmath96 near zero .",
    "this comes about because of the all - neutral requirement in the trigger .",
    "the recoil neutron produced in the reaction can interact and cause a signal in the csi detector thereby vetoing true @xmath97 events but for small values of @xmath98 the neutron can not escape the lh@xmath99 target and the event will not be vetoed .",
    "partial wave analysis is used to extract production amplitudes ( partial waves ) from the observed decay angular distributions of the @xmath18 system .",
    "a process such as @xmath100 , dominated by @xmath14-channel meson exchange , is conveniently analyzed in the gottfried - jackson reference frame .",
    "the gottfried - jackson frame is defined as a right - handed coordinate system in the center of mass of the produced @xmath18 system with the @xmath101 defined by the beam particle momentum and the @xmath102 perpendicular to the plane defined by the beam and recoil neutron momenta . the decay angles ( @xmath103 )",
    "are determined by the @xmath104 four - momentum vector . at a fixed beam momentum , an event is fully specified by @xmath105 .",
    "the acceptances of the e852 apparatus for the gottfried - jackson angles were studied using monte carlo simulations .",
    "results for the @xmath18 effective mass region from 1.3  gev@xmath19  to 1.4  gev@xmath19  are shown in figure [ accep_thet_and_phi ] .",
    "the production amplitudes and their relative phases are extracted from the accumulated angular distributions , for bins in @xmath106 and @xmath107 , using an extended maximum likelihood fit to the distributions in ( @xmath108,@xmath109 ) @xcite .",
    "fits were performed for three bins in @xmath6 ( or simply @xmath14 ) which we label as low-@xmath98 for @xmath110 0.14  ( gev@xmath3)@xmath111 , medium-@xmath98 for 0.14 @xmath112 0.31  ( gev@xmath3)@xmath111 , and high-@xmath98 for @xmath113 0.31  ( gev@xmath3)@xmath111 . for each @xmath14 bin the pwa fits were performed in 0.04  gev@xmath19-wide @xmath18 mass bins .",
    "events corresponding to the reaction @xmath75 were processed through pwa software that extracts partial wave amplitudes and phase differences between various partial waves .",
    "this procedure takes into account information about the acceptance of the apparatus .",
    "the pwa formalism used in this analysis is model independent since the three - body final state follows from a quasi - two body interaction .",
    "this is in contrast to the _ isobar _ model needed for more complex final states , for example , in which one makes specific assumptions about a series of sequential decays leading to the final state under consideration .",
    "the decay angular distributions are described by an expansion in partial waves that are products of a production amplitude for a state of angular momentum @xmath114 and associated magnetic quantum number @xmath115 and a decay amplitude , also for a given @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "the angular momentum @xmath114 is between the @xmath58 and the @xmath89 .",
    "the production amplitude takes into account the spin degrees of freedom of the initial and final nucleons and the naturality of the exchange particle .",
    "that is , the assumption is made that in this peripheral process the produced @xmath18 state results from a @xmath14-channel exchange from the nucleon vertex to the meson production vertex .",
    "alternatively one can view the production vertex as a time - reversed decay of the produced @xmath18 state into the beam particle ( @xmath116 ) and the exchanged particle .",
    "parity conservation in the strong interactions implies a relationship between the magnetic quantum number @xmath115 and naturality .",
    "following @xcite we choose a basis characterized by the naturality of the exchanged particle .",
    "_ natural _ parity exchange obtains if parity and spin are related as @xmath117 ( e.g. @xmath118 meson exchange ) and the exchange is _ unnatural _ if @xmath119 ( e.g. @xmath116 meson exchange ) .",
    "this basis , the _ reflectivity _ basis , is one that does not possess the mixed symmetries of the d - functions or spherical harmonics under rotations about the @xmath120 axis .",

    "in this analysis we considered @xmath136 ( the nomenclature is @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively ) .",
    "waves are further characterized by a subscript @xmath137 if @xmath124 and @xmath138 or @xmath139 if @xmath140 . as noted in @xcite ,",
    "amplitudes with @xmath141 are not expected to be important for the production of mesons in @xmath142 quasi - two - body processes .",
    "this assumption is borne out by pwa fits to these data indicating little contribution from @xmath141 .",
    "we present these results after the discussion of fitting the moments distributions .",
    "the amplitudes considered in this analysis , @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 , and @xmath147 are produced via _",
    "unnatural _ exchange and @xmath148 and @xmath149 are produced via _",
    "natural _ exchange .",
    "waves of different naturality do not interfere .",
    "since the nucleon polarization is not being measured , in equation  ( [ intensity ] ) the dependence on the nucleon helicity is implicit in the production amplitude , e.g. @xmath150 with the upper labels referring to the target and recoil nucleon helicities and the two amplitudes representing nucleon helicity flip and non - flip .",
    "there are multiple discrete sets of partial wave amplitudes that can give rise to exactly the same angular distribution @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that for the production of two pseudoscalars with only @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 waves there are up to eight ambiguous solutions . for a given bin in @xmath151",
    "these multiple solutions can be found by randomly seeding the fit ( using sets of different initial values for the amplitudes ) and doing multiple fits .",
    "it is also possible to find the ambiguous solutions analytically , starting with one of the solutions found from the fitting procedure using the method of barrelet zeroes @xcite . in this analysis",
    "the ambiguous solutions found from multiple randomly seeded fits were found to be consistent with the ambiguous solutions found analytically .    as an example",
    ", all ambiguous solutions are shown for the @xmath143 and @xmath149 waves for the full range in @xmath14 in figure [ s0_d+_amb ] .",
    "the presence of the dominant @xmath13 in the @xmath11 wave leads to a clustering of solutions about the expected breit - wigner lineshape .",
    "the solutions for the @xmath9 wave are more widely distributed .    when possible , mass - bin to mass - bin continuity along with other independent criteria must be used to select the physical solutions among the ambiguous solutions . in this analysis",
    "the presence of the well - established @xmath12 and @xmath13 states , as observed in the @xmath16 mass distribution , provides a means by which to select the physical solution . for each @xmath106 mass bin the solution selected as _",
    "physical _ is one where the @xmath143 and @xmath149 amplitudes and the phase difference , @xmath152 , all as a function of @xmath16 mass , are simultaneously most consistent with two interfering breit - wigner amplitudes with masses and widths for the @xmath12 and @xmath13 as listed in the review of particle properties @xcite .",
    "for example , referring to figure [ s0_d+_amb ] , the @xmath143 amplitude of the physical solution in the 1.0  gev@xmath19  region should be large and its corresponding @xmath149 amplitude small and in the 1.3  gev@xmath19  mass region the @xmath149 amplitude should be large and the @xmath143 amplitude should be small .",
    "it was found that the requirement that the @xmath143 and @xmath149 solutions simultaneously lie close to the expected line shapes leaves a few ambiguities that are removed when the criterion of proximity to the expected value of @xmath152 is imposed .",
    "we note that although the @xmath13 is dominant in the @xmath149 wave , the criterion for selection involved the phase difference between the @xmath146 and @xmath143 waves  the @xmath149 and @xmath143 waves do not interfere . in summary , these criteria were sufficient to uniquely select the physical solution .    in the discussion below that follows the description of fits to experimentally observed moments distributions ,",
    "we discuss additional quantitative measures for discarding other ambiguous solutions as well as the effect of their inclusion on the stability of the final results .",
    "in addition , as discussed below , the @xmath14-dependences of the selected @xmath11-wave solutions are well - described by regge phenomenology as is the ratio @xmath153 , giving us confidence in the selection procedure .    in figure [ criteria ] the selected physical solution in each of the low-@xmath98 , medium-@xmath98 and high-@xmath98 regions",
    "is shown as a function of @xmath18 mass for the @xmath143-wave , the @xmath149 wave and the @xmath154 phase difference .",
    "also shown are the corresponding line shapes and phase differences assuming two interfering breit - wigner forms for the @xmath12 and @xmath13  the basis for the criteria used to select the physical solutions .",
    "we note that the intensity and phase motion of the @xmath143-wave is also consistent with the presence of both the @xmath12 and the @xmath155 .",
    "the @xmath155 resonance parameters have been extracted from a coupled channel analysis of final states producted in @xmath156 annihilations @xcite .",
    "this may account for the excess of events in the 1.4  gev@xmath19  mass region for the @xmath143-wave intensity .",
    "however because of the large statistical errors in this region we have not been able to unambigously extract the @xmath155 resonance parameters .",
    "we will return to this issue in sections vi and vii .",
    "incomplete or incorrect understanding of the experimental acceptance can lead to serious systematic effects in this type of analysis . in particular , it is possible that part of a large , dominant partial wave ( for example @xmath157 ) could appear as a spurious signal in a different partial wave .",
    "we refer to this phenomenon as _ leakage _ and study it by intentionally using an incorrect model of the acceptance .",
    "a monte carlo sample of pure @xmath158 events was generated including both @xmath159 and @xmath160 waves .",
    "this monte carlo sample included the effects of experimental acceptance .",
    "this sample was analyzed in two ways , in one case our best estimate of the acceptance was used , in the second no correction for the acceptance was made .    the analysis using the acceptance correction should produce as output only @xmath159 and @xmath160 waves with all others consistent with zero .",
    "this was found to be the case and the resulting @xmath143 and @xmath161 solutions are compared to the @xmath160 intensity in figure [ leakage](a ) .",
    "a similar result was obtained for all other waves .",
    "we conclude that there are no pathological defects in our method since we were able to reproduce correct output from known input .",
    "the second analysis provides an upper limit as to the contribution of leakage in this analysis .",
    "the acceptance is known to be significantly different than 100% and a function of the kinematic variables , see , for example , figure [ accep_m_and_t ] . approximating the acceptance as equal to 100% independent of the kinematic variables simulates a situation where our understanding of the acceptance is as incorrect as possible , thus providing a limit on the effect of leakage .",
    "it was found that ignoring the acceptance does generate spurious signals in other partial waves .",
