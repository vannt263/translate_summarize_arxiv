    "awaiting the forthcoming results from the large hadronic collider ( lhc ) , we are trying to imagine ways to probe the conceivable new degrees of freedom belonging to the physics at the tev scale . in case",
    "the mass of a new degree of freedom lies out of the reach of direct lhc production , one could still hope to infer on it from its virtual loop effects .",
    "the well - known examples from the past are charm- and top - quark loop effects in the box diagrams contributing to @xmath11 and @xmath12 mixing , respectively .",
    "there has been a recent revival of the latter box diagrams by vysotsky @xcite , in the context of a simple extension of the standard model ( sm ) with an additional up - quark state .",
    "the essential reason for examining such an additional degree of freedom has been the so - called _ nondecoupling _ of a heavy quark in the box diagrams . when the loop diagrams with exchanged goldstone boson and heavy quark are evaluated in the renormalizable gauge , this nondecoupling is known to originate in the yukawa coupling proportional to the heavy quark mass .",
    "generally , in rare processes the box diagrams combine with the z - penguin diagrams that exhibit similar nondecoupling .",
    "therefore , we extend vysotsky s investigation of the box diagrams to the z - penguin diagrams , and explore their impact on some phenomenologically interesting rare decay processes .    our present dwelling on the up - quark sector is motivated in part by a recent study by alwall et al.@xcite which showed that the tevatron measurements leave ample space for an extra top state above 256 gev @xcite .",
    "an extra top state is expected to be part of some beyond the standard model ( bsm ) , but the results of the present paper are quite general and do not rely on any specific bsm .",
    "note that there is even a possibility that such an extra state originates on account of the nonperturbative effects within the sm itself .",
    "there has been a proposal of such a bound state of 6 top and 5 antitop quarks @xcite that could be probed at the lhc .",
    "extra vectorlike quark states of both up- and down - type were already subjected to detailed previous studies @xcite .",
    "the more recent study that focused on the down - quark sector @xcite is complementary to what we are exploring here in the up - quark sector .",
    "moreover , being in favor of a rather heavy spectrum of isosinglet down states , the results by these authors indicate that an isosinglet up - quark could be well beyond the direct lhc production .",
    "our starting point is the model advocated by vysotsky @xcite , where the new up - type quark is just above the lhc reach .",
    "this model has an appeal of repeating in the up - quark sector a sort of seesaw mechanism , that is known to be operative in the up - lepton ( neutrino ) sector . by imposing the quark - lepton symmetric generalization of the sm , the existing modification of the sm in the leptonic upper - hypercharge ( neutrino ) sector opts for the corresponding extra up - type isosinglet quark sector , rather than a full sequential fourth family .",
    "then , a new heavy quark mass scale @xmath13 ensures a smallness of the mixing of an additional top quark with the sm top and may explain why the sm top is much heavier than other sm fermions @xcite .    in the next section",
    "we first describe the predictive two - parameter model based on such an isosinglet extension .",
    "we first check the allowed parameter space against the flavor - conserving electroweak precision observables ( ewpo ) .",
    "the obtained constraints are drawn on account of the nondecoupling , both in the flavor specific parameter @xmath14 and in the oblique @xmath0 parameter . in the third section we focus on the flavor - nondiagonal z - penguin and box diagram transitions that exhibit a subtle cancellation of the leading nondecoupling terms .",
    "finally , we analyze the sensitivity of the golden @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath15 decays to such an extension of the sm and compare it to the results of the littlest higgs model ( lhm ) that provides a monitoring case .",
    "it is conceivable that possible new quark states can be out of the direct production reach also in the era of the lhc .",
    "therefore , we take a closer look at the model proposed recently by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite and check that the ewpo constraints allow for a wider parameter span than considered in @xcite .",
    "this motivates us to further extend the approach by vysotsky @xcite toward a still unexplored region of the parameter space and to focus on rare decays which may be sensitive to this extended parameter region .",
    "the model at hand represents an extension of the sm by the heavy isosinglet , which in the case of ref .",
    "@xcite is a new up - type @xmath0-quark with a mass just above the tevatron bound of 256 gev @xcite .",
    "vysotsky considers , instead , a state with the mass just above @xmath16 5 tev , the limit of the direct production at the lhc , and in the present paper we further extend the considered mass region .",
    "this allows us to look at the loop effects for the whole allowed parameter space , irrespective of whether or not the new state can be produced directly . in the present paper",
    "we show that at @xmath17 tev the extended mass region splits into two regimes that are dominated by two different types of nondecoupling . however , the new results of the present paper refer to the regime of the relatively heavy @xmath0 state .",
    "the adopted model , expressed in terms of the weak ( primed ) eigenstates , reads in the form of the lagrangian that in addition to the usual sm piece has an additional bsm part consisting of two dirac mass terms and one yukawa term : @xmath18 + h.c . \\;\\ ; . \\label{1}\\ ] ] two new heavy @xmath19 singlet states , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , have the dirac mass term @xmath13 that is nondiagonal because @xmath22 mixes with the @xmath23 state .",
    "this mixing is given by two terms in the square brackets : the @xmath24 term describes the mixing of two @xmath19 singlets , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , while the @xmath27 term describes mixing of the sm weak isodoublet with the isosinglet state @xmath22 .",
    "obviously , by switching off these @xmath28 terms , the @xmath23 field would become the ordinary @xmath29 quark , the mass eigenstate of the sm .",
    "the presence of the @xmath30 mixing @xcite has several effects .",
    "first , the mass matrix should be diagonalized , and for the charged current couplings , the sm unitary ckm matrix @xmath31 has to be enlarged to @xmath32 , a generalized @xmath33 ckm matrix that is not unitary .",
    "the adopted assumption that @xmath22 mixes only with the @xmath23 implies that the unitary transformation to mass eigenstates is a simple rotation parametrized by the single ( real ) angle @xmath34 .",
    "accordingly , the generalized cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix entries in the charged current couplings are @xmath35 second , the @xmath30 mixing modifies the neutral current couplings of @xmath36 states @xmath37 this induces the flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) part , given by the nondiagonal terms in @xmath38 however , the built - in restriction that the heavy isosinglet @xmath22 state mixes only with the sm @xmath23 quark , leads to the very predictive 2-parameter model expressed in terms of the @xmath30 mixing angle @xmath34 , and the mass @xmath39 of the new isosinglet quark .    let us turn to the constraints on these new parameters that can be drawn from ewpo tests . both type of loop effects ,",
    "the universal ( oblique ) @xmath0 parameter , and nonuniversal ( flavor specific ) @xmath14 parameter , are sensitive to nondecoupling of heavy quarks .",
    "the effects of the heavy isosinglets in the oblique @xmath0 parameter have been computed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the model at hand , where a single isosinglet quark mixes only with the sm top quark , new contributions to the @xmath0 parameter",

    "[ prostor ] .    a similar constraint can also be drawn from the flavor specific parameter @xmath45 .",
    "namely , the sm loop diagrams involving the @xmath29 quark ( with the corresponding parameter @xmath46 ) modify the @xmath47 coupling @xcite .",
    "in particular its left - handed part @xmath48 is changed by @xmath49 in the bsm at hand , the presence of the @xmath30 mixing modifies this loop correction further , leading to @xcite @xmath50 the functions @xmath51 and @xmath52 in eq.([ttmodif ] ) appear also in the flavor changing rare decays , and they will be presented in more detail in this context in eqs .",

    "thereby we will show how these effects originate in a nondecoupling of the heavy isosinglet quark in the loop diagrams for selected rare decays .",
