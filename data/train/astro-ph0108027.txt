    "in recent years , several dozens of gamma - ray burst ( grb ) afterglows have been observed , and data is accumulating rapidly . the quality of these observations is constantly improving .",
    "the study of afterglow emission has helped shed light on many important aspects of the grb phenomenon .",
    "the spectrum during the afterglow phase is well described by synchrotron emission from a relativistic blast wave , and consists of several power law segments ( plss ) , that join at several break frequencies ( e.g. sari , piran & narayan 1998 ) .",
    "these break frequencies are the self absorption frequency , @xmath1 , below which the optical depth to synchrotron self absorption is larger than unity , @xmath2 , the typical synchrotron frequency of the minimal electron in the power - law , and @xmath3 , the synchrotron frequency of an electron whose cooling time equals the dynamical time of the system .",
    "granot , piran & sari ( 2000 ) have then found that if @xmath4 , the self absorption frequency actually splits into two : @xmath5 and @xmath6 , where an optical depth of unity is produced by non - cooled electrons and all electrons respectively .",
    "different possible orderings of these break frequencies result in five possible spectral regimes , as shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the physical parameters of a burst may be deduced from fitting the observed broad band spectrum to the theoretical spectrum .",
    "this has been done by wijers & galama ( 1999 ) for grb 970508 by fitting a broken power law theoretical spectrum .",
    "a detailed description of the shape of the spectrum allowed a more accurate determination of the self absorption frequency @xmath6 and the peak frequency @xmath2 ( granot , piran & sari 1999b , hereafter gps99b ) .",
    "a more accurate theoretical calculation of the break frequencies leads to a more accurate conversion from the observed spectrum to the burst parameters .",
    "the combined effect was that the inferred value of the density , for example , was different than that of wijers and galama by two orders of magnitude .",
    "this illustrates the sensitivity of this method to the shape of the theoretical spectrum around the break points , and stresses the need for a more accurate determination of the theoretical break frequencies , for all various spectral breaks .",
    "so far only the shape of the spectrum around @xmath2 ( granot , piran & sari 1999a , hereafter gps99a ; gruzinov & waxman 1999 ) and @xmath7 ( gps99b ) was calculate in detail , and even that was only done for the canonical case where @xmath8 ( see the upper panel of figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this paper , is intended to extend these works for _ all _ spectral breaks , and therefore provide a comprehensive , self consistent calculation of the broad band spectrum .",
    "we provide analytic formulas which approximate the shape of each of the spectral breaks and their positions , in a form which is easy to use for afterglow fitting .",
    "we also suggest a prescription for combining these breaks to a single analytic broad band spectrum .    the physical model is outlined in  [ pm ] , while a more detailed and formal description of the model and of the calculation of the observed flux density is given in  [ aa ]",
    "( appendix a ) .",
    "our main results are presented in ",
    "[ anap ] . in  [ bbs ]",
    "we give prescriptions for combining the shapes of the spectrum near the different spectral breaks into a single analytic broad band spectrum .",
    "we discuss our results in  [ dis ] .",
    "an exact calculation of the spectrum requires the knowledge of ( i ) the hydrodynamic quantities ( bulk lorentz factor and number density ) ( ii ) the magnetic field strength ( iii ) the electron energy distribution .",
    "these should be given for any location behind the shock , and at any time .",
    "below we describe our approach to all three .",
    "\\(i ) the hydrodynamics is described by the blandford mckee ( 1976 , bm hereafter ) self similar solution .",
    "this solution describes a spherical relativistic blast wave expanding into a cold medium , and assumes an adiabatic flow , i.e. that radiation losses are small and do not effect the hydrodynamics .",
    "radiative effects can be taken into account to modify the hydrodynamic evolution as described by ( sari 1997 , cohen , piran & sari 1998 ) and to modify the structure of the cooling layer behind the shock as described by granot & knigl ( 2001 ) .",
    "if the radiative losses are not too large , our formalism would give the correct break frequencies and break shapes , provided that one uses the time dependent energy , as discussed in the first two of these references .",
    "the bm solution we use is for an impulsive explosion in an ambient density described by a power law with radius , @xmath9 .",
    "we consider two different values of @xmath10 which are of particular physical interest : @xmath11 , corresponding to an interstellar medium ( ism ) , and @xmath12 , corresponding to a massive star progenitor , surrounded by its pre - explosion wind .",
    "the assumption of a spherical flow is also adequate for a jetted flow at sufficiently early times , when the lorentz factor of the flow is still larger than the inverse opening angle of the jet .",
    "we therefore have the complete hydrodynamic description in term of the total energy @xmath13 , and the external number density @xmath14 ( or @xmath15 in the case of wind ) .",
    "the hydrodynamic profile that is used , is given in equations [ bm_e ] through [ bm_n ] .",
    "\\(ii ) we assume the magnetic field gets a fixed fraction , @xmath16 , of the internal energy everywhere behind the shock , as given by equation [ b ]",
    ". this would be the case if the shock amplified , randomly oriented , magnetic field decreases due to adiabatic expansion .",
    "different assumptions on the evolution and orientation of the magnetic field were shown to have only a small effect on the resulting spectrum ( gps99a , b ) .",
    "\\(iii ) the electrons are assumed to acquire a power law distribution of energies , @xmath17 for @xmath18 , immediately behind the shock .",
    "their total energy immediately behind the shock is a fraction @xmath19 of the internal energy . after being accelerated by the shock , the electrons cool due to radiative losses and adiabatic cooling .",
    "the former can be calculated from synchrotron theory and the latter from the density profile given in by the bm solution .",
    "the resulting distribution is given in equation [ dist ] .",
    "given the above , the observed flux density may be calculated as described in  [ aa ] ( appendix a ) .",
    "the spectrum for the optically thin breaks may be calculated using equation [ optically_thin ] , while equation [ f_nu_tau>1 ] applies more generally .",
    "* power law segments . * all five possible different spectra , which are shown in figure [ fig1 ] , consist of between three and five different power law segments ( plss ) . at each asymptotic pls",
    "( sufficiently far from the break frequencies ) we have @xmath20 .",
    "altogether there are eight different plss , labeled a through h , from high to low values of @xmath21 .",
    "note that there are two different plss with a slope of @xmath22 .",
    "both are produced by the low energy tail of synchrotron radiation , but in region @xmath23 it is the non - cooled electrons that are responsible for the radiation while in region @xmath13 it is the cooled electrons .",
    "most plss appear in more than one of the five possible spectra ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "if one is only interested in the spectrum far enough from the break frequencies , then the normalizations of the different plss is all that is needed to accurately describe the spectrum .",
    "this is given in table [ pls ] .",
    "the coefficients for plss a , g and h , slightly depend on @xmath24 in a non analytic way .",
    "these were calculated for @xmath25 , and a linear function ( or a linear function multiplied by an exponent ) was used to describe the results .    for pls e , we find that the emission becomes dominated by the contribution from small radii ( i.e. early times when the radius of the shock was small ) for @xmath26 .",
    "the electrons responsible for the emission in this regime have suffered considerable adiabatic cooling ( as well as radiative losses ) . in this regime ( @xmath27 )",
    "pls e splits into two different plss , whose spectral slope @xmath21 depends on @xmath10 .",
    "furthermore , the effective size of the afterglow image , at a given observed time , in this regime depends on the observed frequency .",
    "however , since this new regime is somewhat out of the main stream of this paper , and in order to avoid confusion , we leave the detailed description of this new regime to a future work ( granot & sari , in preparation ) . the normalization of pls e , and",
    "the expressions for the spectral breaks @xmath28 ( that involve pls e ) , are therefor left out of tables [ pls ] and [ t1 ] , respectively , for @xmath12 .    * break frequencies . *",
    "the different possible combinations of the eight plss , result in 11 different break frequencies , labeled @xmath29 ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "again , the same break frequency may appear in more than one spectrum .",
    "the values of the break frequencies , @xmath30 , and the corresponding extrapolated flux densities , @xmath31 , are defined at the point where the asymptotic plss meet .",
    "these can be directly calculated from the normalization of the plss that are given in table [ pls ] , but for completeness they are given explicitly in table [ t1 ] .",
    "the fit for the @xmath24 dependence was redone in this table ( with either a linear fit , an exponent or a combination of the two ) using the accurate results for @xmath25 , therefore resulting in slight ( a few percent ) inconsistencies with the previous table .",
    "* shape of breaks . *",
    "the flux density near a spectral break , @xmath30 , may be approximated by @xmath32^{-1/s}\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the asymptotic spectral slopes below and above the break , respectively , and @xmath35 is a parameter which describes the sharpness of each break .",
    "the sign of @xmath35 is equal to that of @xmath36 ( i.e. positive if the spectral slope decreases across the break ) , while @xmath37 represents the sharpness of the break ( the sharper the break , the larger @xmath37 ) .",
    "the shape of most spectral breaks ( except for @xmath38 ) , depends on the value of @xmath24 , and so does the corresponding value of @xmath39 , which is given in table 2 .",
    "all quantities which depend on the value of @xmath24 were calculated for @xmath25 , and are given in a form which is as exact as the functional parameterization permits at these values of @xmath24 , and interpolates ( or extrapolates ) for other values of @xmath24 , and should therefore be reasonably accurate for @xmath40 ( see discussion below equation [ electron_dis ] for @xmath41 ) .    the break @xmath42 has been investigated in detail by gps99a , for @xmath11 , and they found that the physically motivated formula @xmath43 \\tau_{1}^{-6/5 } \\quad , \\quad \\tau_{1}=(\\nu/\\nu_{1})^{-5/3 } \\ , \\ ] ] provides an even better description of @xmath44 near the break ( with an mrd of @xmath45 , compared to @xmath46 with equation [ anapp ] ) . however , for @xmath12 , equation [ anapp ] provides a better fit ( with an mrd of @xmath47 compared to @xmath48 with equation [ b1 ] ) , which shows that the previous success of equation [ b1 ] was accidental .",
    "equations [ anapp ] and [ b1 ] both give a poor fit for @xmath49 .",
    "this is because the spectral slope across this break does not change monotonically .",
    "we therefore provide an alternative formula for this break , @xmath50\\quad , \\quad \\phi_4=\\nu/\\nu_4\\quad \\ , \\ ] ] where the values of @xmath35 for @xmath49 which appear in table 2 , are for this equation , rather than for equation [ anapp ] , as for the other breaks .",
    "the values and the shape of the break frequencies , as given in the previous section , are strictly valid only when the break frequencies are far away from each other . though , in principle , our formalism is adequate to describe the general spectrum , for arbitrary values of the break frequencies , such a description , would require a new calculation for any ratio of the break frequencies , and is therefore not practical . instead",
    ", we choose to give a heuristic prescription , that uses the shapes from the previous section to construct a broad band spectrum , which includes all the breaks , for an arbitrary ratio of the break frequencies .",
    "once again we stress that this is not a rigorous derivation of such a spectrum , but simply an analytic equation , that gives a smooth spectrum when the break frequencies are close to each other , and approaches the rigorous shape of each break , in the asymptotic situation where the break frequencies are far apart .",
    "such an equation is useful for fitting afterglow data .",
    "one can readily construct such a formula for any one of the five different possible spectra shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "let us label these spectra 1 through 5 , from top to bottom , and denote the corresponding flux densities by @xmath51 where @xmath52 .",
    "we also label the flux density near the 11 spectral breaks by @xmath53 , where @xmath29 .",
    "the fluxes , @xmath53 , are given by equation [ anapp ] ( for break @xmath49 equation [ b4 ] gives a more accurate description ) .",
    "now , let us define a quantity @xmath54 , by @xmath55^{-1/s}\\ .\\ ] ] the formulas for the rounded shape of the spectrum for the five spectra which are shown in figure [ fig1 ] , from top to bottom , are given by @xmath56 the first term , @xmath57 , provides the normalization and the shape of the spectrum near the lowest break frequency , while each consecutive term , @xmath58 , represents the next break frequency , from low to high frequencies , and provides the shape of the spectrum near that break frequency , and the appropriate change in the spectral slope across the break .",
    "the number of free parameters in each spectrum generally equals the number of break frequencies plus two , since besides the values of the break frequencies , one has to specify the value of @xmath24 and of the flux normalization .",
    "the bottom panel of figure [ fig1 ] is an exception , and @xmath59 has only 5 free parameters , since there is a closure relation between the four break frequencies ( granot , piran & sari 2000 ) : @xmath60    our prescription for constructing the broad band spectrum uses @xmath31 from only one of the break frequencies in each spectrum , and thus avoids the problem of the slight inconsistencies within table [ t1 ] ( that arise due to the independent fits for the @xmath24 dependence , e.g.  [ anap ] ) .",
    "we have used the bm solution , to obtain more accurate expressions for the flux density . under the assumptions that the initial electron distribution is a strict power - law with a low energy cutoff , and that the magnetic field is amplified immediately behind the shock , we derived exact expressions for the values of the break frequencies , as well as the shape of the spectrum around each break .",
    "we have given a complete general description of the broad band spectrum .",
    "as our analysis is general , it also includes exotic spectra , that may only be relevant in very early phases or for extreme parameters .",
    "our main results are summarized in figure [ fig1 ] and tables 1 and 2 .",
    "in general , the spectrum of grb afterglows evolves from fast to slow cooling , which includes the cases relevant for the afterglow , @xmath61 . ] .",
    "for example , for an ism with standard parameters , ( e.g. @xmath62,@xmath63 , @xmath64 ) the initial spectrum is 5 , then @xmath2 crosses @xmath3 and the spectrum turns into spectrum 1 , and finally , when @xmath2 crosses @xmath6 the spectrum turns into spectrum 2 . the transition times between the various spectra of figure [ fig1 ]",
    "can be worked out by equating the various frequencies , as given in table [ transitions ] .",
    "it follows that there are two types of evolution depending on the parameters , as given in the chart below .",
    "@xmath65 @xmath66    the weakest link in our formalism , is the assumption of a sharp lower cutoff in the electron distribution .",
    "this would affect breaks @xmath67 ( though for @xmath42 , the shape of the break will not be effected , while @xmath68 and @xmath69 may change ) .",
    "nevertheless , our calculation provides the first self consistent description of all these breaks .",
    "the values and shape of the rest of the breaks , depends only on the assumption of a power - law distribution , well above the low energy cutoff , and on the electron cooling .",
    "our description of these breaks ( @xmath70 ) is therefore more robust .",
    "these breaks may still be somewhat affected by the assumption of the magnetic field evolution . however , in previous papers ( gps99a , b ) , we have shown that this dependence is relatively week ( @xmath71 and @xmath72 change by up to @xmath73 , while @xmath69 and @xmath68 change only by up to a few percent , where in both cases the shape of the break does not change considerably ) .",
    "we give a complete description of all possible power - law segments ( plss ) , and provide exact expressions for the flux density away from the break frequencies .",
    "these expression are useful when partial information for the afterglow exists . in general a spectral slope and a flux at some frequency are sufficient to give some constraint on the afterglow parameters ( in plss g and h , @xmath24 would also be needed ) .",
    "for example , if only x - ray data exists , pls h can be used to extract some information on the underlying parameters , and if only radio data exists , pls b can be used , even if the self absorption frequency is not observed , ( i.e. is above the observed radio frequency ) .",
    "expressions for some of the break frequencies and corresponding flux densities already exist in the literature ( waxman 1997 ; sari , piran & narayan 1998 ; wijers & galama 1999 ; gps99a , b ; granot , piran & sari 2000 ; chevalier & li 2000 ; panaitescu & kumar 2000 ) .",
    "most of these works address the spectrum shown in the upper panel of figure 1 ( spectrum 1 ) .",

    "this missing term caused an overestimation of the of the absorption coefficient by a factor of @xmath81 , and a corresponding overestimation of @xmath68 and @xmath69 , by factors of @xmath82 and @xmath83 , respectively .",
    "however , this missing term does not effect the shape of the break , which is given in equations [ anapp ] or [ b1 ] ( i.e. equation 24 of gps99b ) . ] . for @xmath12 ( and @xmath74 ) , our values of @xmath68 , @xmath72 and @xmath80 are smaller by factors of 2.5 , 1.4 and 1.4 , respectively , compared to chevalier & li ( 2000 ) , while our value for @xmath71 is larger by a factor of 3.2 ; compared to panaitescu & kumar , or value for @xmath68 ( @xmath72 ) is larger ( smaller ) by a factor of 4.9 ( 7.4 ) , while our value for @xmath80 is larger by only @xmath84 .",

    "our equations do not include the effects of inverse compton scattering on the cooling of the electrons .",
    "this effect is known to be important , when @xmath86 ( sari , narayan & piran 1996 , panaitescu & kumar 2000 , sari & esin 2001 ) .",
    "following the prescription of sari & esin , we can include the effects of inverse compton by inserting appropriate powers of @xmath87 into the values of the break frequencies , or the plss ( where @xmath88 is the compton y - parameter ) .",
