    "<S> the corresponding classification of locally deformable cn2 euclidean submanifolds in codimension two is considerably more involved , and was obtained only recently in @xcite and @xcite ; * a compact immersed submanifold @xmath14 with nonnegative sectional curvature not diffeomorphic to the 3-sphere @xmath15 is necessarily cn2 , and either isometric to @xmath16 for some metric of nonnegative curvature on @xmath17 , or diffeomorphic to a lens space @xmath18 ; see @xcite . in the case of lens spaces , </S>",
    "<S> the set of points with vanishing curvature has to be nonempty with hausdorff dimension at least two . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is not known yet if they can be isometrically immersed into @xmath19 ; * i. m. singer asked in @xcite whether a riemannian manifold is homogeneous if the curvature tensor at any two points is orthogonally equivalent . </S>",
    "<S> the first counterexamples to this question were cn2 manifolds with constant scalar curvature , which clearly have this property , and are typically not homogeneous ; see @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the most trivial class of cn2 manifolds is given by cylinders @xmath20 with their natural product metrics , where @xmath21 is any ( not necessarily complete ) connected surface . </S>",
    "<S> more generally , we call a _ twisted cylinder _ </S>",
    "<S> any quotient @xmath22 where @xmath23 acts properly discontinuously and freely . </S>",
    "<S> the natural quotient metric is clearly cn2 , and we call @xmath21 the _ generating surface _ of @xmath24 , and the images of the euclidean factor its _ </S>",
    "<S> nullity leaves_. observe that @xmath24 fails to be complete only because @xmath21 does not need to be . </S>",
    "<S> yet , what is important for us is that @xmath24 is foliated by complete , flat , totally geodesic , and locally parallel leaves of codimension  @xmath25 .    </S>",
    "<S> our first goal is to show that these are the basic building blocks of complete cn2 manifolds with finite volume :    [ m1 ] let @xmath0 be a complete cn2 manifold . </S>",
    "<S> then each finite volume connected component of the set of nonflat points of @xmath0 is globally isometric to a twisted cylinder .    </S>",
    "<S> the hypothesis on the volume of @xmath0 is essential , since complete locally irreducible riemannian manifolds with constant conullity two abound in any dimension ; see @xcite , @xcite and references therein . </S>",
    "<S> these examples serve also as counterexamples to the nomizu conjecture in @xcite , which states that a complete locally irreducible semi - symmetric space of dimension at least three must be locally symmetric . however , theorem a together with theorem 4.4 in @xcite yield :    nomizu s conjecture is true for manifolds with finite volume .    for the 3-dimensional case , the fact that the set of nonflat points of a finite volume cn2 manifold is locally reducible was proved in @xcite with a longer and more delicate proof . </S>",
    "<S> notice also that in dimension 3 the cn2 condition is equivalent to the assumption , called cvc(0 ) in @xcite , that every tangent vector is contained in a flat plane , or to the condition that the ricci endomorphism has eigenvalues @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , in @xcite it was shown that a complete 3-manifold with ( geometric ) rank one is a twisted cylinder .    </S>",
    "<S> observe that we are free to change the metric in the interior of the generating surfaces of the twisted cylinders in theorem  [ m1 ] , still obtaining a complete cn2 manifold . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , they are nowhere flat with gaussian curvature vanishing at their boundaries </S>",
    "<S> . of course , these boundaries can be quite complicated and irregular .    in general it </S>",
    "<S> is very difficult to fully understand how the twisted cylinders in theorem  [ m1 ] can be glued together through the set of flat points in order to build a complete riemannian manifold . </S>",
    "<S> an obvious way of gluing them is through compact totally geodesic flat hypersurfaces . indeed , </S>",
    "<S> when the boundary of each generating surface @xmath21 in the twisted cylinder @xmath27 is a disjoint union of complete geodesics @xmath28 along which the gaussian curvature of @xmath21 vanishes to infinity order , the boundary of @xmath29 is a disjoint union of complete totally geodesic flat hypersurfaces @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the subgroup of  @xmath32 preserving @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> we can now use each @xmath33 to attach another finite volume twisted cylinder @xmath34 to @xmath29 along @xmath33 , as long as @xmath34 has a boundary component isometric to  @xmath33 . repeating and iterating this procedure with each boundary component we construct a complete cn2 manifold @xmath0 . as we will see , the hypersurfaces @xmath33 have to be compact if @xmath0 has finite volume . </S>",
    "<S> this motivates the following concept of geometric graph manifold  of dimension @xmath35 , which by definition is endowed with a cn2 riemannian metric :    _ definition . _ a connected riemannian manifold @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> is called a _ geometric graph manifold  _ if @xmath0 is a locally finite disjoint union of twisted cylinders @xmath36 glued together through disjoint compact totally geodesic flat hypersurfaces @xmath37 of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> that is , @xmath38        with three cylinders and two ( finite volume ) ends    here we allow the possibility that a hypersurface @xmath37 is one - sided , even when @xmath0 is orientable . we also assume , without loss of generality , that the nullity leaves of two cylinders @xmath29 and @xmath34 , glued along  @xmath37 , have distinct limits in @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> this implies in particular that for each cylinder @xmath29 , the gauss curvature vanishes along @xmath39 to infinite order .    </S>",
    "<S> observe that the complement of @xmath40 is contained in the set of flat points of @xmath0 , but we do not require that the generating surfaces of @xmath36 have nonvanishing gaussian curvature . </S>",
    "<S> in particular the sectional curvature of @xmath36 , or equivalently its scalar curvature , can change sign . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , @xmath40 carries a well defined complete flat totally geodesic parallel distribution of constant rank @xmath1 contained in the nullity of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , @xmath40 is dense and locally finite in the sense that it has a locally finite number of connected components ( see section  [ mainsec ] for a precise definition ) . </S>",
    "<S> these two topological properties will be crucial in what follows , so for convenience we say that a dense locally finite set is _ </S>",
    "<S> full_.    a natural way to try to see if a riemannian manifold @xmath0 as in theorem  [ m1 ] is indeed a geometric graph manifold  is the following . </S>",
    "<S> theorem  [ m1 ] implies that on the open set of nonflat points @xmath41 we have the well defined parallel nullity distribution @xmath2 of rank @xmath1 , as in  @xmath40 above . </S>",
    "<S> now , consider any open set @xmath42 carrying a complete flat totally geodesic distribution @xmath43 with @xmath44 , which we call an _ extension _ of @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> we will show that each connected component of @xmath45 is still a twisted cylinder , and call @xmath45 _ maximal _ if it has no larger extension . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , by definition @xmath41 always has a maximal extension , but it may not be unique . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , all extensions of @xmath41 may fail to be either dense , or locally finite , or both ; see examples 2 and 3 in section 1 .    </S>",
    "<S> our second main goal is to prove that all we need to ask in order for @xmath0 as in theorem  [ m1 ] to be a geometric graph manifold  is that some extension of @xmath41 is full :    [ m2 ] let @xmath0 be a complete cn2 manifold with finite volume . </S>",
    "<S> then @xmath0 is a geometric graph manifold  if and only if its set of nonflat points @xmath41 admits a full extension . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath41 itself is full , then @xmath0 is a geometric graph manifold  .    </S>",
    "<S> we point out that here we do not require a full extension @xmath45 of @xmath41 to be maximal , but clearly any maximal extension of @xmath45 is also full . </S>",
    "<S> we can for example introduce complicated sets of flat points in the twisted cylinders , even as cantor sets in the generating surfaces , but these flat sets will be absorbed by a maximal full extension . </S>",
    "<S> as we will show , any maximal full extension will satisfy the properties of @xmath40 in the definition of , see theorem  [ mainfinite ] . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that the methods developed to prove this can be extended for distributions of arbitrary rank .    </S>",
    "<S> although complete 3-dimensional geometric graph manifolds  are well studied in the context of nonpositive curvature ( see e.g. @xcite ) , they are also interesting for manifolds with nonnegative curvature , as e.g. in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> notice that in this case the assumption of finite volume is equivalent to compactness . </S>",
    "<S> we first show that their study can be reduced to the 3-dimensional case :    [ nonneg ] let @xmath0 be a compact geometric graph manifold  with nonnegative scalar curvature . </S>",
    "<S> then , the universal cover @xmath46 of @xmath0 splits off an @xmath47-dimensional euclidean factor isometrically , i.e. , @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , either @xmath49 splits isometrically with a metric on @xmath17 with nonnegative gauss curvature , or @xmath50 with a geometric graph manifold  metric .    </S>",
    "<S> we will see that the first part follows , without any curvature conditions , already under the assumption that @xmath51 is connected .    in dimension 3 , </S>",
    "<S> the simplest nontrivial example with nonnegative scalar curvature is the usual description of @xmath15 as the union of two solid tori endowed with a product metric , see . </S>",
    "<S> if this product metric is invariant under @xmath52 , we can also take a quotient by the cyclic group generated by @xmath53 to obtain a cn2 metrics on any lens space @xmath54 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath55 denotes the rotation of angle @xmath56 .     as a nonnegatively curved cn2 manifold , scaledwidth=30.0% ]    </S>",
    "<S> there is a further family whose members also admit cn2 metrics with nonnegative scalar curvature : the so called _ prism manifolds _ @xmath57 , which depend on two relatively prime positive integers @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> a geometric graph manifold  metric on @xmath59 can be constructed as a quotient of a geometric graph manifold  metric on @xmath15 as above , with the two solid tori being in addition isometric , by the group generated by @xmath60 and @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is a fixed point free isometry switching the two solid tori . </S>",
    "<S> topologically @xmath59 is thus a single solid torus whose boundary is identified to be a klein bottle . </S>",
    "<S> its fundamental group @xmath63 is abelian if and only if @xmath64 , and in fact @xmath65 is diffeomorphic to @xmath66 ; see section  [ lenss ] . </S>",
    "<S> unlike in the case of lens spaces , the diffeomorphism type of a prism manifold is determined by its fundamental group .    </S>",
    "<S> our last main result shows that these are the only nontrivial geometric graph manifolds  with nonnegative scalar curvature . </S>",
    "<S> we will see that all twisted cylinders in this case are of the form @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is a 2-disk of nonnegative gaussian curvature whose boundary @xmath69 is a closed geodesic along which the curvature vanishes to infinite order . </S>",
    "<S> we fix once and for all such a metric @xmath70 on a 2-disc @xmath71 whose boundary has length @xmath72 and which is rotationally symmetric . </S>",
    "<S> we call a geometric graph manifold  metric on a if the generating disk @xmath68 of each twisted cylinder @xmath29 as above is isometric to @xmath71 with metric @xmath73 for some @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> observe that the projection of @xmath75 for @xmath76 is a parallel foliation by closed geodesics of the flat totally geodesic 2-torus @xmath77 of  @xmath29 .    </S>",
    "<S> we provide the following classification :    [ ls ] let @xmath78 be a compact geometric graph manifold  with nonnegative scalar curvature and irreducible universal cover </S>",
    "<S> . then @xmath78 is diffeomorphic to a lens space or a prism manifold . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we have either :    * @xmath78 is a lens space and @xmath79 , </S>",
    "<S> i.e. , @xmath78 is isometrically the union of two nonflat twisted cylinders over disks @xmath80 glued together along their common totally geodesic flat torus boundary @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , any flat torus endowed with two parallel foliations by closed geodesics defines a standard geometric graph manifold  metric on a lens space , which is unique up to isometry ; * @xmath78 is a prism manifold and @xmath82 , i.e. , @xmath78 is isometrically the closure of a single twisted cylinder over a disk @xmath67 whose totally geodesic flat interior boundary is isometric to a rectangular torus @xmath81 , and @xmath83 is a klein bottle . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , any rectangular flat torus endowed with a parallel foliation by closed geodesics defines a standard geometric graph manifold  metric on a prism manifold , which is unique up to isometry .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition , any geometric graph manifold  metric with nonnegative scalar curvature on @xmath78 is isotopic , through geometric graph manifold  metrics with nonnegative scalar curvature , to a standard one .    </S>",
    "<S> the diffeomorphism type of @xmath78 in theorem  [ ls ] is determined by the relative ( algebraic ) slope between the parallel foliations by closed geodesics ; see section  [ lenss ] for the precise definition . in case @xmath84 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath78 is diffeomorphic to a lens space @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the relative slope between the foliations @xmath87 $ ] , @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> analogously , the manifolds in case @xmath89 are prism manifolds @xmath59 , where @xmath90 is the relative slope between the foliation @xmath91 $ ] on the rectangular interior boundary torus @xmath92 and the foliation @xmath93 .    </S>",
    "<S> we can deform any geometric graph manifold  metric in theorem  [ ls ] to first be standard preserving the torus @xmath81 , and then deform @xmath81 to be the unit square @xmath94 , while preserving also the sign of the scalar curvature along the process . in case @xmath84 , we can also make one of the foliations equal to @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> the metric is then determined by the remaining parallel foliation of the unit square by closed geodesics whose usual slope is equal to the relative slope . since the diffeomorphism type of a lens space @xmath85 is determined by @xmath96 , we conclude :    the moduli space of geometric graph manifold  metrics with nonnegative scalar curvature on a lens space @xmath85 has infinitely many connected components , whereas on a prism manifold @xmath59 with @xmath97 it is connected .    the assumption of local finiteness in theorem  [ m2 ] can be regarded as a mild regularity condition . </S>",
    "<S> but we believe that even without regularity conditions it should be possible to understand the gluing between the twisted cylinders . </S>",
    "<S> we state :    if the set of nonflat points of a complete cn2 manifold with finite volume admits a dense ( not necessarily locally finite ) extension , then the complement of any maximal one is a disjoint union of compact totally geodesic flat hypersurfaces , possibly accumulating ( see example  3 in section  [ examples ] ) .    certainly more difficult </S>",
    "<S> , we can ask what happens if we remove all hypothesis on @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we do not know if the following is true :    does the set @xmath41 of nonflat points of a complete cn2 manifold with finite volume admit a maximal ( not necessarily dense or locally finite ) extension @xmath45 such that @xmath98 is a union of flat totally geodesic hypersurfaces , each of which has complete totally geodesic boundary ( if nonempty ) ? </S>",
    "<S> ( see example 2 in section  [ examples ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , in the case of nonnegative or nonpositive curvature we believe one has a stronger statement :    every compact 3-dimensional cn2 manifold with nonnegative or nonpositive scalar curvature and finite volume is a geometric graph manifold  .    </S>",
    "<S> another interesting question is to what extent complete cn2 manifolds with finite volume differ from geometric graph manifolds  from a differentiable point of view :    if @xmath0 admits a complete cn2 metric with finite volume , does it also admit a geometric graph manifold  metric ?    we caution that our definition of a graph manifold in dimension 3 is more special than the usual topological one , where the pieces are allowed to be nontrivial seifert fibered circle bundles ( @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> ours is similar , although more general , to the kind of graph manifolds one studies in nonpositive curvature .    </S>",
    "<S> the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ examples ] </S>",
    "<S> we provide some examples in order to show that the two hypothesis in theorem  [ m2 ] are necessary . </S>",
    "<S> section  [ sts ] is devoted to give some general facts about twisted cylinders and the action of their deck groups . </S>",
    "<S> a general semi - global version of the de rham theorem is provided in section  [ dr ] and will be used in section  [ ptha ] to prove theorem  [ m1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the proof of theorem  [ m2 ] is carried out in section  [ mainsec ] . </S>",
    "<S> the last two sections are devoted to the classification of geometric graph manifolds  of nonnegative scalar curvature , and therefore are independent from the rest of the paper . in section  [ nonnegn ] </S>",
    "<S> we prove theorem  [ nonneg ] by showing that the manifold is a union of one or two twisted cylinders , while in section  [ lenss ] we classify their metrics . </S>"
