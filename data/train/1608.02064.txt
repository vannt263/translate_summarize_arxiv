    "in the past years a great deal of work has been devoted to the study which aims at clarifying the role of the frustration in low - dimensional quantum spin systems with competing interactions . as regards the two - leg ladder systems , the general cases where additional leg next - nearest - neighbor and/or diagonal interactions are competing with the leg nearest - neighbor and rung interactions",
    "have been extensively investigated  @xcite .",
    "very recently , we  @xcite have discussed the ground - state phase diagram of the frustrated two - leg ladder , in which rung interactions are ferromagnetically - antiferromagnetically alternating and have a common ising - type anisotropy , while leg interactions are antiferromagnetically uniform and isotropic .",
    "the phase diagram which we have numerically determined in the case where the leg interactions are relatively weak compared with the rung interactions shows that the incommensurate haldane state as well as the commensurate one appears as the ground state in the whole range of the ising - type anisotropy parameter .",
    "this appearance of the haldane state in the case where the ising character of rung interactions is strong is contrary to the ordinary situation , and is called the inversion phenomenon concerning the interaction anisotropy  @xcite .",
    "the ground - state phase diagram of the frustrated rung - alternating two - leg ladder in which all interactions are isotropic has also been studied by combining analytical approaches with numerical simulations  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown that the introduction of the rung alternation gives rise to the half - magnetization plateau in the ground - sate magnetization curve  @xcite .",
    "this result is consistent with the necessary condition for the appearance of the magnetization plateau by oshikawa , yamanaka and affleck  @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we explore the ground - state phase diagram of another frustrated two - leg ladder with different leg interactions .",
    "we express the hamiltonian which describes this system as @xmath5 here , @xmath6 is the operator acting at the ( @xmath7,@xmath8 ) site assigned by rung @xmath7 and leg @xmath9 ; @xmath10 and @xmath3 denote , respectively , the magnitudes of the isotropic leg @xmath11 and leg @xmath12 interactions ; @xmath1 denotes that of the anisotropic rung interaction , the @xmath13-type anisotropy being controlled by the parameter @xmath2 ; @xmath14 is the total number of rungs , which is assumed to be even .",
    "it should be noted that this system has a frustration when irrespective of the sign of @xmath1 .",
    "the most characteristic feature of the present system is the fact that , when the condition , which belongs to the frustration region , is satisfied , the following three states are the _ exact eigenstates _ of the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] )  @xcite .",
    "* the direct - product singlet - dimer ( sd ) state in which all rungs form the sd @xmath15 pair . *",
    "the direct - product triplet - dimer ( td ) state in which all rungs form the td @xmath16 pair . * the nematic state with an arbitrary phase @xmath17 in which all rungs are in the state given by a linear combination of two ferromagnetic states , .    here , @xmath18 denotes the state and @xmath19 the state .",
    "furthermore , it can be analytically shown that , when , , and the @xmath4-type anisotropy of rung interactions is sufficiently strong @xmath20@xmath21 , the direct - product td state is the _ exact ground state _ of the system , and that , when and is sufficiently large , the direct - product sd state is the _ exact ground state _ of the system .",
    "it is noted that the above result concerning with the direct - product sd state has already been shown by tsukano and takahshi  @xcite .",
    "we also note that all of the above results including the nematic state with @xmath17 as well as the direct - product td and sd states are applicable to systems in higher dimensions , in which units of two spins form lattices  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , materials corresponding to the present model have been neither yet found nor synthesized so far .",
    "we believe , however , that it is a physically realistic model .",
    "in fact , for example , yamaguchi _ et _ _ al . _",
    "@xcite have recently demonstrated the modulation of magnetic interactions in spin ladder systems by using verdazyl - radical crystals .",
    "it is highly expected that the flexibility of molecular arrangements in such organic - radical materials realizes two - leg ladder systems with different leg interactions .    in the following discussions ,",
    "we confine ourselves to the case where @xmath1 is ferromagnetic , and we put , choosing @xmath22 as the unit of energy .",
    "then , when , the present ladder system can be mapped onto the chain by using the degenerate perturbation theory .",
    "we discuss this mapping in the next section ( section  2 ) .",
    "section  3 is devoted to the discussions on the ground - state phase diagram .",
    "assuming , for simplicity , that or @xmath23 and ( the @xmath4-type anisotropy of rung interactions ) , we determine the ground - state phase diagrams on the @xmath2 versus @xmath3 plane .",
    "we mainly use the numerical methods such as the exact - diagonalization ( ed ) method and the density - matrix renormalization - group ( dmrg ) method  @xcite with the help of physical considerations . finally , we give concluding remarks in section  4 .",
    "we discuss the case where , assuming that .",
    "the four eigenstates for rung @xmath7 are given by , , and , and the corresponding energies are , respectively , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , for all @xmath7 s .",
    "thus , the state @xmath28 can be neglected .",
    "we introduce the pseudo operator @xmath29 for rung @xmath7 , and make the @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 states correspond to the @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 states , respectively . the relation @xmath36 holds , as is readily shown by comparing the matrix elements of both operators @xmath29 and @xmath37 in the subspace of @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "thus , the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) for the operator @xmath37 can be mapped onto the effective hamiltonian @xmath41 for the operator @xmath29 , which is given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the @xmath44-component of @xmath29 .",
    "it is noted that the on - site anisotropy ( @xmath45- ) term comes from the difference between @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the above @xmath41 is the result of the degenerate perturbation calculation in the lowest - order of @xmath48 .",
    "it is apparent that this is not applicable to discussing the frustrated region of the original hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) , which includes the case of . in order to improve this point ,",
    "higher - order perturbation calculations are indispensable ; these calculations are left for a future study .",
    "chen _ et _ _ al . _",
    "@xcite have determined the ground - state phase diagram of the chain . according to their results , as the value of @xmath45 increases from zero , the phase transition from the @xmath4 ( or haldane ) phase to the large-@xmath49 phase takes place at when ( or when ) .",
    "thus , we may expect that in our ladder with , the phase transition between the @xmath4 and td phases occurs at when ( or , equivalently , when ) , and also that the phase transition between the haldane and td phases occurs at when ( or , when , again ) .",
    "it is noted that the large-@xmath49 state in the spin-1 chain is equivalent to the td state in the present ladder , since in the valence bond picture of the former state , each spin consists of two spins forming the td pair , as is well known .",
    "throughout this section we assume that , as mentioned before . figure  [ fig : phase - diagram ] shows the ground - state phase diagrams on the @xmath2 versus @xmath3 plane determined for and .",
    "the former phase diagram consists of the td , @xmath4 and non - collinear ferrimagnetic ( ncfr ) phases  @xcite , and in the latter one , the haldane ( h ) phase appears in addition to the above three phases .",
    "there are three kinds of the phase transition lines , which we have numerically estimated as discussed below in detail .",
    "the magenta lines with open circles are the phase transition lines between the td or h phase and the @xmath4 phase which are of the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) type  @xcite , the red line with closed circles is the phase transition line between the td and h phases which are of the gaussian - type , and finally the blue lines with open squares are the phase transition lines between the ncfr phase and the td or @xmath4 phase . in the latter phase diagram , there are two tricritical points at and @xmath50 associated with td , @xmath4 and h phases .",
    "the green straight lines show the results of the comparison of the degenerate perturbation calculations with chen _ et _ _ al . _ s numerical results  @xcite ( see section  2 ) ; in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase - diagram](a ) it is for the td-@xmath4 transition and given by , while in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase - diagram](b ) it is for the td - h transition and given by .",
    "in both cases they are in excellent agreement with the numerical results at least when @xmath51 is not too large . it is noted that on the special lines where , which are shown by the black broken lines , the direct - product td state is the _ exact ground state_.        in the following explanations for the estimation of the above phase boundary lines , we denote , respectively , by @xmath52 and @xmath53 the lowest and second - lowest energy eigenvalues of the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) within the subspace determined by @xmath14 and @xmath54 under periodic boundary conditions , .",
    "the quantity @xmath54 is the total magnetization given by , which is a good quantum number with the eigenvalues of , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 .",
    "similarly , we also denote by @xmath58 the lowest energy eigenvalue of the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) within the subspace determined by @xmath14 , @xmath54 and @xmath59 under twisted boundary conditions , , and , where or @xmath60 is the eigenvalue of the space inversion operator with respect to the twisted bond , .",
    "we further denote by @xmath61 the lowest energy eigenvalue of the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) within the subspace determined by @xmath14 and @xmath54 under open boundary conditions , where the sums over @xmath7 for leg interactions are taken from to .    the most powerful method to estimate numerically the phase boundary lines between two of the td ,",
    "@xmath4 and h phases is the level spectroscopy ( ls ) method developed by okamoto , nomura and kitazawa  @xcite . in this method , the following three excitation energies  @xcite , , and should be compared in the thermodynamic ( limit .",
    "more strictly speaking , the critical value @xmath62 of the bkt @xmath4-td transition , the critical value @xmath63 of the bkt @xmath4-h transition and the critical value @xmath64 of the gaussian td - h transition , which are all for given values of @xmath10 and @xmath2 , are estimated as follows .",
    "first , the corresponding finite - size critical values @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 are estimated , respectively , by solving numerically the equations , @xmath68 then , these finite - size results are extrapolated to the limit to obtain , respectively , the critical values , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 .            practically , we have made the ed calculations to estimate @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 for finite-@xmath14 systems with , @xmath69 , @xmath56 , @xmath70 spins . the procedures for these estimations",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : excitation - energy ] , for example , for , and or @xmath71 .",
    "performing the extrapolations of the above finite - size critical values , we have fitted them to quadratic functions of @xmath72 by use of the least - square method , as explained in fig .",
    "[ fig : extrapolation ] , for example , for and or @xmath71 , again .",

    "let us denote by @xmath73 the ground - state magnetization for the system with @xmath74 spins under open boundary conditions , which is the value of @xmath54 giving the lowest value of @xmath61 s . in the ncfr phase ,",
    "@xmath73 is finite @xmath75@xmath76 , while in other phases ,  @xcite .",

    "[ fig : gs - magnetization - etc](a ) .",
    "we see from this figure that the phase transition from the td phase to the ncfr phase and that from the ncfr phase to the @xmath4 phase successively occur with increasing @xmath3 @xmath75see fig .",

    "figure  [ fig : gs - magnetization - etc](a ) suggests that the phase transition between the td and ncfr phases is of the second order , while that between the ncfr and @xmath4 phases is of the first order .",
    "however , it is fairly difficult to clarify the order of the phase transition by using only the results of dmrg calculations .",
