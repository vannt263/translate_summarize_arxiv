    "it is believed that in the early universe a series of vacuum phase transitions led to several types of topological defects  @xcite .",
    "topological defects are relics of the early universe and are expected to convey some information on physics of very high energy scales beyond our reach with ground - based accelerators . on the other hand , topological defects are candidates for the seed of the observed large scale structure of the universe such as sheet - like or filamentary structures or voids .",
    "thus topological defects are attractive examples which connect the high energy physics and cosmology and we might be able to have some information on high energy physics through cosmological observations such as gravitational wave detection in future .",
    "topological defects , if they existed , would interact with other strong gravitational sources such as black holes , and then they might have experienced large deformation and emitted some information on themselves as gravitational waves . if we succeed in detecting such gravitational waves and identifying them , we will be able to confirm the existence of topological defects and hence the occurrence of a vacuum phase transition .",
    "the topological defects with finite extent such as the cosmic string or the domain wall are known to produce an unusual gravitational field  @xcite and their dynamics are slightly complicated .",
    "there are some studies on the interaction between a cosmic string and a black hole with the hope of detecting gravitational waves from cosmic strings .",
    "de villier and frolov studied  @xcite the dynamics of the scattering and capturing process of an infinitely thin test string by a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "however less is known on the interaction between a domain wall and a black hole ; only the static configurations have been studied so far .",
    "morisawa et al .",
    "@xcite showed the existence of static configurations of a thick domain wall intersecting a schwarzschild black hole in its equatorial plane .",
    "christensen et al .",
    "@xcite numerically found a series of static configurations of a domain wall as a nambu - goto membrane in the schwarzschild spacetime , some of which represent an intersecting pair of a domain wall and a black hole . when arranged in sequence , these configurations seem to represent a scattering and capturing process of a domain wall by a black hole . in most situations of cosmological interest",
    ", the thickness of a domain wall will be much smaller than the horizon radius of a solar - mass or primordial black hole , so that the infinitely thin wall ( membrane ) approximation will be valid in such cases .",
    "when we further neglect the gravitational effect of a domain wall , its spacetime history , i.e. , the world sheet is governed by the nambu - goto action and it is called the nambu - goto membrane .    a membrane lying in the equatorial plane of the black hole spacetime has the highest symmetry among the configurations which represent an intersecting pair of a membrane and a black hole .",
    "this simple configuration is a possible candidate for a final state of the scattering and capturing process provided such a state stably exists . having this in mind",
    ", we study the stability of a nambu - goto membrane at the equatorial plane of the reissner - nordstrm - de sitter ( rnds ) spacetime .",
    "the charge of the black hole and the positive cosmological constant are included to see their effect on the stability .",
    "this mimics the situation where a domain wall resulting from a vacuum phase transition is intersecting a charged primordial black hole in the early universe .",
    "we consider the linear perturbation of the membrane by means of the covariant perturbation formalism  @xcite .",
    "the perturbation equation reduces to a wave equation on the world sheet with the mass term , which is negative in the presence of the charge of the black hole or the positive cosmological constant .",
    "accordingly instability is naively expected .",
    "solving the perturbation equation reduces to solving a two point boundary value problem .",
    "we numerically solve it by the shooting and the relaxation methods .",
    "we find that a membrane intersecting a rnds black hole is unstable .",
    "we find the instability at least in the range of @xmath2 for @xmath3 , and @xmath4 for @xmath5 , whereas the membrane in the schwarzschild background is stable .",
    "while our treatment of a domain wall is simple with both its thickness and gravitational effect neglected , our model of the membrane - black hole system is all the more elementary and relevant in other contexts .",
    "the interaction between black holes and extended objects is important as an elementary physical process .",
    "indeed much attention has recently been paid to the interaction between black holes and extended objects such as membranes or strings in the string / m - theory  @xcite , the brane world scenario  @xcite etc .. for instance in the context of the brane world models , our universe is described as a four - dimensional domain wall in the five dimensional bulk spacetime .",
    "some people argue that a black hole on the gravitating membrane is realized as a `` black cigar '' in the bulk spacetime which intersects the membrane  @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[eqs ] we review the covariant perturbation formalism and specify the perturbation equation and the boundary conditions .",
    "the numerical algorithm is also explained there . in sec.[results ] we present the results of numerical and analytical considerations .",

    "becomes @xmath46 the mass term becomes negative when the charge of the black hole or the positive cosmological constant is present , which implies instability .",
    "this is why we consider the equatorial plane of the reissner - nordstrm - de sitter spacetime .",

    "@xmath110 is a monotonously decreasing function of @xmath111 and has the only one root for @xmath112 .",

    "next we consider @xmath119 case . for @xmath112 , @xmath120 either stays negative , or becomes positive for an interval @xmath121 but otherwise negative .",
    "then the sufficient condition for the stability of perturbation is @xmath122 which excludes the possibility that @xmath120 stays negative , and ensures @xmath123 .",
    "when @xmath124 increases , @xmath125 and @xmath126 decrease and @xmath127 and @xmath114 increase .",

    "therefore eq .  ( [ stcond2ene0 ] ) shows that at least for @xmath134 there exists no unstable mode .",
    "the condition that the reissner - nordstrm - de sitter spacetime has a static region is @xmath135 , where @xmath136 this is a monotonously increasing function of @xmath137 and has the minimum value @xmath138 .",
    "so we numerically investigate the cases @xmath139 .",
    "we found unstable modes for various parameter sets @xmath140 .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath96 modes are shown in fig .",
    "[ plots ] .",
    "the results of the shooting method and the relaxation method agree very well , the error being within 5% .",
    "[ plots ] shows that when @xmath141 becomes larger , we have a larger @xmath142 and hence a higher growth rate of the perturbations .",
    "therefore the charge of the black hole indeed destabilizes the membrane at the equatorial plane .",
    "since the membrane is electrically neutral , this instability should be understood as the curvature effect of the charge of the black hole .    as to the effect of the cosmological constant @xmath143 , we find no simple tendency : for a given @xmath141 , a larger @xmath143 does not necessarily lead to a larger @xmath142 .",
    "however with a non - vanishing cosmological constant the magnitude of the eigenvalue is typically @xmath144 for @xmath145 in contrast to the rn cases , in which the magnitude of the eigenvalue almost exponentially decreases with decreasing specific charge and is far below @xmath144 for @xmath146 .",
    "therefore we can at least say that the cosmological constant also destabilizes the membranes .",
    "this expectation is supported by the consideration of the de sitter background case ( see appendix [ desitter ] ) .",
    "we plotted some of the eigenfunctions for @xmath5 cases in fig .",
    "[ profiles ] . some features of the profiles are listed in table [ features ] .",
    "when we decrease the value of the specific charge of the black hole , the peak of the corresponding profile gets higher and approaches the event horizon .",
    "as noted above we found that the charge of the black hole destabilizes the membrane in general .",
    "however , in the present analysis , we could not show the existence of unstable modes for small @xmath141 ( @xmath147 ) when @xmath5 due to the difficulty in the numerical calculation as follows . as @xmath141 becomes smaller",

    "[ loglog ] ) .",
    "judging by the extrapolation of this relation to the regime @xmath149 , @xmath142 will be infinitesimal when @xmath150 . in order for the asymptotic forms @xmath151 of @xmath152 to be justified",
    ", @xmath153 must be much smaller than @xmath154 at the boundaries .",
    "then the coefficients in the evolution equations ( [ numevol ] ) get extremely small and we suffer from underflows of numerical calculations . by the same numerical difficulty , we leave open the possibility that unstable modes with @xmath92 exist in the presence of the positive cosmological constant .",
    "in this paper we numerically studied the stability of a nambu - goto membrane at the equatorial plane of the reissner - nordstrm - de sitter spacetime and found that in general such a membrane is unstable when the black hole is charged .",
    "a membrane is a two - dimensional extended object in the three - space .",
    "so when it moves towards a black hole , it is expected to be inevitably captured by the black hole .",
    "a series of configurations found by christensen et al . seem to represent such situations . among these configurations",
    "a membrane lying in the equatorial plane of the black hole spacetime has the highest symmetry and is most likely to be the final state of the scattering and capturing process . on seeing our result , however",
    ", we expect that it is not the case .",
    "in particular , fig . [ profiles ]",
    "allows us to imagine that the membrane moves away from the equatorial plane",
    ". then what eventually happens to that membrane ?",
    "causality prohibits the membrane from escaping from the event horizon . by analogy with the scattering process of a cosmic string off a black hole  @xcite",
    "the membrane might experience large deformation and the topology of the membrane might change . here",
    "are some speculations on the fate of the membrane ; it may settle down to some other configuration than the equatorial plane , or it may break up into two parts with one swallowed by the black hole and the other escaping to infinity .",
    "we need to perform a full dynamical computation to resolve this issue .",
    "however that is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we ignored the gravitational effect of a domain wall whereas a gravitating domain wall is known to make a repulsive gravitational field  @xcite , which is opposite to the strong attractive gravity of a black hole .",
    "it is quite intriguing to find out the consequences of the competition of these opposite forces .",
