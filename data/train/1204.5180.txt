    "there has been a recent resurgence of interest in alternative explanations for the annual modulation signal detected by dama / libra , the dark matter direct detection experiment located at the gran sasso national laboratory ( lngs ) , italy .",
    "the dama / libra data  @xcite , together with those of its previous incarnation , dama / nai  @xcite , show a clear modulation ( at 8.9@xmath0 ) that is consistent with the dark matter hypothesis both in period and phase .",
    "however , there has been widespread skepticism for the interpretation of this signal as evidence for dark matter direct detection .",
    "alternative interpretations have been proposed : one of these is background induced by cosmic muons , the flux of which also modulates annually with a peak in the summer , in the northern hemisphere , due to temperature fluctuations in the stratosphere . a ( convoluted ) mechanism by which the modulating cosmic muons might give rise to a signal in the dama detector , involving intermediate spallation neutrons , was proposed in  @xcite",
    ". this hypothesis has not been independently tested , and recently several arguments against it were put forward by dama  @xcite . here we will examine more closely one of these arguments , namely the compatibility between the period and phase of the dama and muon annual modulations .",
    "independent assessments of the compatibility of the dama signal with the cosmic muon flux , the latter taken from the lvd experiment  @xcite at lngs , whose period of data taking coincided with the first 5 runs of dama / libra , were carried out in  @xcite and  @xcite , with contradictory conclusions . however , lvd is not the only experiment measuring the cosmic muon flux at the lngs site ; including the data from macro  @xcite and borexino  @xcite gives a 20-year span of muon modulation data , fully encompassing the time - span of both dama / nai and dama / libra .",
    "we analyse for the first time the combined data set and find an annual modulation whose phase is rather incompatible with dama s .",
    "intriguingly for such high energy muons , we also see significant power at a period of just over 10 years , with a phase that represents a close anticorrelation with the solar cycle .",
    "we present our results in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] and discuss their implications in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we begin by subtracting , from the data of lvd and borexino , the average muon flux reported over the course of the experiment , in order to normalize them to the same baseline ( macro already presented its data in this form ) .",
    "we then carry out a simple chi - squared fit of the combined data to a cosine of unknown amplitude , period and phase , marginalising over an added constant for each individual experiment , to allow for the effect of systematic flux mis - measurements , as well as their different sensitivities for through - going muons .",
    "the best - fit cosine has a period of 365.9@xmath10.2 ( solar ) days and a phase of 177.4@xmath12.2 days ( with respect to january 1st 1991 ) . while these numbers are generally in good agreement with the fits carried out by the individual experiments , the goodness of fit , quantified by a value of chi - squared per degree of freedom of 7587/4244 , is rather poor",
    "this is unsurprising : while we expect the annual modulation of muons , which is directly related to temperature fluctuations in the stratosphere , to be periodic , this periodicity is unlikely to be sinusoidal .",
    "similarly we carry out a chi - squared fit to dama / nai and dama / libra data and find a period and phase in good agreement with those quoted by the collaboration themselves .",
    "we plot confidence limit contours for the muon and dama data sets in the 2d period - phase plane in fig.[fig : contours ] below . as pointed out in  @xcite ,",
    "because the periodicity is allowed to vary , the size and shape of the contours are affected by the choice of time origin .",
    "we have verified , however , that the relative ( dis-)agreement between the two sets of data in chi - squared units is independent of the choice of the origin , as it should be , and is also relatively stable over the entire timespan of the experiments .",
    "we use the parameter goodness of fit  @xcite , to quantify the level of compatibility between dama and the muon data when measuring the period and phase .",
    "the p - value for the two data sets measuring the same parameters is @xmath2 , which corresponds to a 5.2@xmath0 tension between them .",
    "this supports the conclusion in chang et .",
    "@xcite of no strong correlation between the annual oscillation of cosmic muons and the dama signal , with two caveats .",
    "the first is that the mechanism by which the muons generate a signal in the dama detector does not significantly smear the phase of the modulation .",
    "the second is that we test for a correlation with the assumption of sinusoidal behaviour for the cosmic muon modulation , which is a rather poor one , as can be seen from the value of the chi - squared per degree of freedom .",
    "indeed , when fixing the period to one year and extracting the phase for each independent year of the two datasets to test for the stability over time of the results , we found that the yearly dama results are always compatible within their uncertainties with the average value over the length of the experiment . on the other hand ,",
    "the cosmic muon data shows a larger yearly dispersion evidencing again the poorness of the sinusoidal approximation for the muon data .",
    "however , we expect that a more sophisticated statistical analysis of the data sets , that does not rely on this assumption , will yield a similar conclusion .",
    "tension . ]    ]      even more interesting perhaps are the results from our systematic tests for the existence of a subleading , longer - term variation in the muon flux , such as that noticed by blum  @xcite in the lvd data .",
    "we fit the combined muon data to a sum of two cosines , with unrelated and unknown amplitudes , periods and phases , marginalising over a constant shift parameter for each experiment as before ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : annual ] for best - fit curve ) .",
    "we find the leading annual modulation almost unchanged , but the chi - squared for the fit improves by over 250 units on addition of the second cosine , with an amplitude of 0.40@xmath10.03% ; a period of 10.7@xmath10.3 years and a phase of 1880@xmath150 days ( corresponding to a first maximum in march 1996 ) .    as a quantitative measure of the significance of the subleading periodicity in muon data",
    ", we plot a lomb - scargle periodogram  @xcite , for the full cosmic muon data set . like an inverse fourier transform",
    ", this prescription separates a periodic signal into its harmonic constituents , but is tailored to work even for unevenly - spaced data .",
    "it has well - understood statistical properties , for example it is known to yield an exponentially - falling power when the input is random gaussian noise .",
    "given the large disparity between the size of the error bars in the data from the different experiments , however , we find it necessary to weight the data points by their individual error bars , as proposed in  @xcite , thus making the information in the periodogram more analogous to that obtainable using a chi - squared fit  @xcite .",
    "we use an oversampled set of frequencies based on the natural frequencies of the data set in order to obtain a good resolution on the resulting periodogram , and estimate the threshold power at which noise can be excluded at the 99.9% c.l . using the prescription provided in  @xcite .",
    "we generate 10,000 samples of random gaussian noise , with identical spacing to the muon data , and with the same variance and error bars .",
    "we then compute the weighted lomb - scargle periodogram for each sample , for our standard set of oversampled natural frequencies , and use the distribution of the power of the highest peak in each plot as a measure of the `` false - alarm '' probability .",
    "our results can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : lspower](a ) .",
    "the dominant feature is a peak at 1 year ( truncated due to the range of the plot ) .",
    "there seem to be many subdominant peaks , including one around 10 years , although it is unclear how to interpret them , since it is only possible to come to a statistically rigorous conclusion about the dominant peak in a given l - s periodogram .",
    "we therefore repeat the above procedure after filtering out the annual modulation , by subtracting from the data a cosine with the best - fit annual parameters .",
    "the resulting periodogram can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : lspower](b ) , with the limit for exclusion of noise at the 99.9@xmath3 confidence level ( now given the presence of an annual modulation with the pre - defined properties ) shown as a dotted line .",
    "in the subtracted periodogram one can clearly see in the cosmic muon flux a harmonic component with a period of 10.4@xmath10.3 years .",
    "many of the small - period spikes present in the periodogram for the full data set have vanished after harmonic filtering of the annual modulation , leading us to conclude that they were aliasing peaks , or some other artifact of the irregular data spacing or sampling frequencies used .",
    "the subleading periodicity in the muon data , as seen in both the chi - squared fit and the l - s periodogram , displays a strong correlation with the solar cycle .",
    "we also plot for comparison the weighted lomb - scargle periodogram for the monthly - averaged sunspot data in the same period , taken from  @xcite , and originally derived from data by the solar influences data analysis center in belgium in fig .",
    "[ fig : lspower](c ) .",
    "we see a dominant peak corresponding to a period of 12.6@xmath10.1 years , and what looks like higher harmonics of this fundamental frequency .",
    "caution must be exercised in interpreting the fitted periods and uncertainties presented in this subsection : the solar cycle is known to have a rather variable period , making the cosine fit an inadequate description of the data , as reflected in the large chi - squared values .",
    "this does not , however , preclude the use of these fit values to compare two data sets under the hypothesis of a correlation between them .    in order to test for a possible correlation between the secondary modulation in the gran sasso cosmic muon data and the sunspot data , we again make use of the parameter goodness of fit , with parameters extracted from a chi - squared fit of both the muon and sunspot data to cosine functions with a relative phase of @xmath4 .",
    "while the fitted phases are in agreement , we find there is a 4.7@xmath0 tension between the fitted periods , which is not very encouraging .",
    "notice , however , that in the fits , the sunspot data are weighted by their variance , which in the limit of low statistics is strongly dependent on their absolute values , making data taken during minimums of solar activity dominate the fit .",
    "because of this , the fitted period is driven to large values by the unusually long and deep solar minimum around 2008 .",
    "by contrast , the corresponding muon data was taken mostly by borexino , which has comparatively large error bars .",
    "thus , muon data give more weight to earlier parts of the solar cycle , which fit better with smaller periods .",
    "indeed , redoing the fit after rescaling the sunspot error bars such that the relative size of the error bars ( and hence their weights ) are the same as in the muon data reduces the tension between the two data sets to 2.1@xmath0 . furthermore , as mentioned above , a sinusoid with a constant period is a particularly bad model for sunspot activity ( 522/242 for the chi - squared per dof ) , which is cyclical rather than periodic . performing a fit to the sunspot data using a cosine with a period that varies linearly in time instead",
    "results in a very accurate description of solar data over the two cycles in question , with an improvement in the chi - squared per dof ( to 249/241 ) , and a fitted `` period '' which varies from 8 to 13 years . with this phenomenologically - motivated fitting function",
    ", we find that the discrepancy between both data sets reduces to less than 1@xmath0 , seemingly implying a close correlation between them .",
    "this correlation is rather puzzling given that the cosmic muon flux is being measured at 3800 m.w.e . below the earth s surface , which corresponds to a threshold muon energy of 1.3 tev at sea level .",
    "the variation of the cosmic ray flux with the solar cycle is a known phenomenon , one that is now understood to be due to larger magnetic fields , and increased turbulence from the solar wind at a solar maximum , deflecting low energy cosmics , thus preventing them from reaching the earth . according to the common lore  @xcite",
    ", however , one should not expect to see this effect persist at energies larger than tens of gev for the primary cosmic , and hence also for its decay products .",
    "the persistence of this effect to muons of energies larger than @xmath5(tev ) is likely not due to long - term changes in the stratospheric temperature , since we do not see the corresponding period in the effective temperature periodogram ( computed as detailed in  @xcite , using atmospheric temperature records taken at the nearby pratica di mare station , from the integrated global radiosonde archive  @xcite ) .",
    "there is possibly a more subtle mechanism at work ; coming up with a suitable candidate , however , will require a detailed analysis of the interplay between cosmic ray propagation and atmospheric effects , and is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we combined the measurements of the cosmic muon flux from three gran sasso - based experiments , macro , lvd , and borexino , and analysed the resulting 20 years of data in the light of claims that cosmic muons might somehow be responsible for the 8.9@xmath0 annual modulation measured at dama . in fitting the muon and dama data to a sinusoidal variation of unknown amplitude , period and phase , we find the two data sets have periods that are compatible , but their phases are in conflict at 5.2@xmath0 .    without a working model by which muons might fake a signal in the dama detector , a possible role for cosmic muons in dama s annual modulation can not be ruled out by these arguments alone .",
    "however , it seems challenging to find a mechanism that can bridge a phase discrepancy of 5.2@xmath0 between the two datasets .",
    "alternatively , dama might be measuring the resultant effect of two annual modulations with slightly different phases , one of which results from contamination by cosmic muons .",
    "we subsequently separated the muon data into its harmonic components using a lomb - scargle periodogram .",
    "we found in addition to the annual modulation , a subdominant modulation of period just over 10 years with a power well above the 99.9% c.l . for noise , and a phase that is anticorrelated with the solar cycle .",
    "this result was confirmed using a chi - squared fit .    a correlation between such high energy muons and the solar cycle goes against the common lore : one might expect energetic cosmics that produce these muons to be unaffected by the presence of the larger solar magnetic fields and stronger solar winds of a solar maximum .",
    "this puzzling observation is unlikely to be due to contamination by cosmic neutrinos , whose flux at the depth of the gran sasso lab ( 3800 m.w.e . )",
    "would be subdominant to the muon flux , and too small to account for this effect  @xcite .",
    "moreover , we found no evidence for such long - term modulation in the effective stratospheric temperature close to gran sasso .",
    "the reason for the persistence of this effect to high - energy muons possibly stems from some complex interplay of atmospheric effects and secondary cosmic production , but the detailed modelling of these effects is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "independent tests of a potential correlation between high energy cosmic rays and the solar cycle should already be possible at a number of long - running experiments , including underground detectors such as super - kamiokande , and terrestrial experiments such as agasa or hires .",
    "additional facilities exist that are currently taking cosmic ray data , like icecube and minos for muons , or extensive air shower experiments such as the tibet air shower array and argo - ybj . in a number of years ,",
    "these will have collected enough data to probe the relevant time scales , allowing us to explore the dependence of any modulation with the depth , latitude and longitude at which the observations were recorded , as well as its energy and flavour - dependence .",
    "finally , satellite experiments can directly probe the primary cosmic rays , yielding crucial information for our ultimate understanding of this effect .",
