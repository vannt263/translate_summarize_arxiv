    "it has occurred that only for @xmath1 there is a continuous order - disorder phase transition , whereas for @xmath2 discontinuous phase transition appears . moreover , for @xmath2 the hysteresis exhibits oscillatory behavior , i.e. , expands for the even values of @xmath0 and shrinks for the odd values of @xmath0 . despite the fact that most of the results presented in @xcite were derived from the master equation and not only from the computer simulations , the intuitive understanding of the non - monotonicity of hysteresis is still missing .",
    "above results are even more confusing if we realize that the @xmath0-neighbor ising model on the complete graph seems to be identical with the classical ising model with the nearest - neighbors ( nn ) interactions on the annealed random @xmath0-regular graph ( @xmath0-rrg ) @xcite .",
    "the confusion comes from the fact that the ising model with ferromagnetic nn interactions without an external field has been already examined on a number of different quenched and annealed networks , and it always manifests continuous phase transitions @xcite . discontinuous or mixed - order phase transitions have been observed only if the range of interactions were infinite @xcite or on the coupled networks @xcite .",
    "extensive studies have shown not only that phase transition in the ising model is continuous but also characterized with the same set of bulk critical exponents on quenched and annealed networks @xcite . only very recently it has been shown that the @xmath0-neighbor ising model is a limiting case of a non - equilibrium system with two heat baths : the ising spins are in thermal contact with the heat bath @xmath3 with temperature @xmath4 , whereas links are in thermal contact with another bath @xmath5 with temperature @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "for @xmath7 such a generalized model reduces to the @xmath0-neighbor ising model investigated in @xcite .",
    "it has been also shown that for @xmath7 there is nonzero positive heat flux , which confirms that the @xmath0-neighbor ising model is indeed out of equilibrium .",
    "paper @xcite explains the puzzle of seemingly contradictory results  continuous phase transition in the equilibrium ising model on the annealed network @xcite vs. discontinuous phase transition in the @xmath0-neighbor ising model @xcite",
    ". however , many interesting questions are still open .",
    "in particular it is still unclear if we can fully explain the switch from continuous to discontinuous phase transition on the basis of non - equilibrium regime .",
    "is it possible that other dynamics , even for @xmath7 ( out - of - equilibrium ) , would lead to the same results as the equilibrium model ?",
    "it seems quite probable , because results presented in @xcite suggest that for the heat - bath dynamics the transition would be continuous , at least on the annealed directed graph .",
    "summarizing , in this paper we ask the question about the role of dynamics in the non - equilibrium kinetic ising model . referring to this question",
    "we examine the kinetic ising model with several dynamics ( including metropolis and heat - bath ) on quenched and annealed @xmath0-rrgs .",
    "precisely , we study several different algorithms ( dynamics ) that belong to a broad class of a single - spin - flip dynamics ( i.e. , glauber dynamics , in a broad sense ) @xcite . within such dynamics",
    "each spin is flipped ( @xmath8 ) with a rate @xmath9 per unit time , and this rate is assumed to depend only on the energy difference implied in the flip : @xmath10 we investigate only such transition probabilities that on the quenched graphs fulfill detailed balance and lead to the boltzmann distribution in a stationary state , which means that they satisfy the following general condition : @xmath11 this is quite obvious that on the quenched graph they should all lead to the same result , which will be checked in the next section . however , on the annealed graph the situation is far from being obvious , and we will show that the results strongly depend on the dynamics",

    "( [ det_bal ] ) , and several examples will be investigated later in this paper .",
    "in the previous paper @xcite we have investigated the @xmath0-neighbor ising model , which was basically the ising model with the metropolis dynamics @xcite with seemingly small modification that was inspired by the @xmath0-voter model @xcite . within the @xmath0-neighbor ising model",
    "we consider a graph that consists of @xmath14 nodes , and each node is occupied by exactly one spin , described by a dynamical binary variable @xmath15 . in each elementary update",
    "a single , picked at random , spin @xmath16 interacts with its @xmath0 neighbors , also randomly chosen from its entire neighborhood .",
    "generally , two methods of selecting neighbors are possible  with or without repetitions .",
    "for example , in the original @xmath0-voter model repetitions were possible , i.e. , a given neighbor could be selected more than once @xcite .",
    "however , later also the @xmath0-voter model without repetitions has been investigated @xcite .",
    "the version without repetitions is of course suitable only for the selected topologies in which the minimal degree of a node @xmath17 . for the complete graph",
    "both methods are applicable for arbitrary value of @xmath18 and give roughly the same results . here",
    ", we continue the study on the @xmath0-neighbor ising model started in @xcite ; therefore , we use the same method as previously , i.e. , without repetitions .",
    "it is worth to notice that for the version without repetitions , that we use here , instead of defining the @xmath0-neighbor ising model on the complete graph , one could think about the ising model on the annealed random @xmath0-regular graph ( @xmath0-rrg ) @xcite .",
    "degree distribution for such a graph is fixed and equals @xmath19 , but the arrangement of links between nodes is random and changes in each update .",

    "we will use several different dynamics including heat - bath given by eq .",
    "( [ rate_hb ] ) . beyond this generalization of @xmath9 ,",
    "formally exactly the same algorithm was used in @xcite .",
    "however , it should be noted that previously we could not speak about the energy or the temperature because only @xmath0 out of all neighbors were considered .",
    "we investigate the model by monte carlo simulations and estimate the magnetization of the system as an ensemble average over @xmath22 samples : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the stationary magnetization in @xmath25-th sample , defined as : @xmath26 here @xmath27 denotes a value of an @xmath20-th spin in the @xmath25-th sample in the stationary state . in the case of the quenched approach for each @xmath25-th sample",
    "we build a new random regular graph of size @xmath14 , in which degrees of all nodes are equal @xmath0 , but the network does not change in time . in the case of the annealed approach",
    "we change the network after each single update defined by the algorithm in the previous section .    for the quenched approach",
    ", we expect that metropolis and heat - bath algorithms will give exactly the same results .",
    "moreover , results should be consistent with the general analytical formula for the critical temperature @xmath28 for the ising model with coupling constant @xmath29 on an `` equilibrium '' random network with the degree distribution @xmath30 , derived by dorogovtsev _",
    "@xcite : @xmath31 for @xmath0-rrg degrees of all nodes are equal to @xmath0 .",

    "[ fig_quenched ] we see that results for hb and m dynamics are the same , and the critical temperature is properly described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : crit_quenched ] ) , which is also clearly visible in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : tc ] .",
    "on one hand , theoretical description simplifies significantly if we replace the quenched network by the annealed one because in such a case we can easily derive the transition probabilities for the system and write down the rate and/or the master equation , as it was done in the previous paper @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the behavior on the annealed graph , at least for the ising model with metropolis dynamics , is much more complex including : ( 1 ) a switch from a continuous to a discontinuous phase transition at @xmath34 and ( 2 ) an unexpected oscillatory behavior of the hysteresis , expanding for even values of @xmath0 and shrinking for odd values of @xmath0 .    here ,",
    "following the reasoning presented in @xcite , we derive transition probabilities for the ising model with hb dynamics on the annealed @xmath0-rrg .",
    "this allows us to calculate stationary magnetization as well as the critical temperature . in a single update ,",

    "let us define a quantity which can be thought of as a net force acting on our system in the following way @xcite : @xmath51 in such a case , the lines of equilibrium are determined by the condition @xmath52 differentiating the above equation with respect to the concentration gives @xmath53 note that the critical point corresponds to the extremum of @xmath54 .",
    "hence , the first derivative of the temperature over @xmath47 vanishes at @xmath55 , that is to say , @xmath56 therefore , evaluating eq .",

    "furthermore , it is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : criticalt ] that metropolis algorithm , considered already in @xcite , gives different value of @xmath28 for the annealed graph .",
    "figure  [ fig_quenched ] illustrates differences of the out - comes from two popular dynamics : metropolis and heat - bath .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown that the heat - bath algorithm reproduces almost the same results for annealed and quenched graphs .",
    "the difference is only quantitative and decreases with the growing average degree @xmath0 ; see also fig .",
    "[ fig : criticalt ] ( left panel ) . on the other hand ,",
    "metropolis dynamics causes much more profound changes in the behavior of the system . on quenched networks only continuous phase transitions are observed whereas on annealed graphs both continuous and discontinuous transitions are present depending on the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , the hysteresis exhibits oscillatory characteristics shrinking for odd values of @xmath0 and expanding for even ones @xcite .    in order to comprehend why annealing for some dynamics causes once only quantitative and other qualitative differences , we introduce and investigate several new dynamics which fulfill the detailed balance condition and reproduce the boltzmann distribution in equilibrium for the model placed on quenched @xmath0-rrg .",
    "in other words , the transition probabilities satisfy eq .",
    "( [ det_bal ] ) .",
    "the most natural choice for such a dynamics comes from the modification of the metropolis algorithm : @xmath60 the above modification is identical with the original metropolis dynamics , except of the case @xmath61 . for m algorithm @xmath62 , on the other hand for the hb dynamics @xmath63 .",
    "here we propose a   generalized version in which @xmath64 , where @xmath65 $ ] is a parameter ; see the right panel of fig .",

    "such a modification reminds of the generalized zero - temperature glauber dynamics introduced in @xcite , which occurred to be particularly interesting from theoretical point of view @xcite . as we will see , the above dynamics , although artificial and not motivated by any physical processes , will also turn out to be particularly intriguing",
    "nevertheless , other transition rates that fulfill eq .  ( [ det_bal ] ) are also possible , and we will briefly present results for two of them : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a normalizing constant and @xmath68 ,      \\label{eq : wtan}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 is a parameter .",
    "transition probabilities generated by the proposed dynamics are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : differentdyn ] for several temperatures .",
    "note that for growing @xmath69 the above transition rate approaches @xmath70 with @xmath71 .",
    "although all dynamics satisfy detailed balance and therefore give the same results on quenched random @xmath0-regular graphs , the outcomes differ when we anneal the network .",
    "for @xmath72 phase transition is continuous for all values of parameters , like in the case of quenching , but diagrams are shifted towards higher temperatures .",
    "consequently , it results in the larger values of the critical points .",
    "more thought provoking behavior of the model is induced by the modified metropolis algorithm @xmath70 with @xmath71 .",
    "then the system exhibits two types of phase transitions . for odd values of @xmath0 both metropolis dynamics , modified and original",
    "one , are consistent and produce qualitatively the same results , in a sense that all transitions for @xmath73 are discontinuous .",
    "however , for even values of @xmath0 all transitions become continuous ; see the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : modifiedm ] .",
    "it should be recalled here that for @xmath74 , which corresponds to original metropolis results were almost opposite  though phase transitions were discontinuous for all @xmath73 , yet just for even values of @xmath0 discontinuity was stronger ( larger jump of the order parameter and hysteresis ) .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : modifiedm ] presents how the phase diagram changes under the influence of @xmath75 for the model with @xmath59 .",
    "it is seen that there is a critical value of @xmath75 for which the transition type for even values of @xmath0 switches from discontinuous to continuous one .",
    "we can derive this critical point @xmath76 as well as categorize phase transitions based on the classical landau theory @xcite by introducing an effective potential @xmath77 and studying its behavior for small values of the order parameter @xmath78 , i.e. , near zero . having the net force @xmath79 , from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : netforce ] ) and ( [ eq : rel_cm ] ) , we can construct the potential in the following way : @xmath80 in the vicinity of zero , we can expand it into a taylor series , and neglect terms of the higher - order than @xmath81 .",
    "this procedure leads to the potential in the form : @xmath82 where coefficients @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85",

    "when @xmath83 is negative , a disordered phase is unstable .",
    "therefore , a condition @xmath89 allows us to derive the boundary of a region where a paramagnetic phase is present ; note that this is equivalent to eq.([eq : condtc ] ) .",
    "the order of a transition is determined by the coefficient @xmath84 . if it is positive , the system undergoes continuous phase transition .",
    "when it is negative , a discontinuous transition appears , and there is an area , bounded by the spinodal lines ( dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasereal ] ) , where two phases may coexist . within the modified metropolis dynamics , defined by eq.([eq : modifiedm ] ) , there is a ferromagnetic - paramagnetic continuous phase transition for small values of @xmath75 and above a certain tricritical point ( tcp ) the continuous transition line splits up into two spinodal lines , where the transition becomes first order ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : phasereal ] ) .",
    "similar behavior has been observed recently for the non - equilibrium ising model with two heat - baths , but in that case the temperature of the heat - bath for links @xmath6 has driven the tricritical behavior @xcite .",
    "because tcp is a place where all three sections : the coexistence area and regions with purely ordered and disordered phases meet , it might be determined by fulfilling simultaneously two conditions @xmath89 and @xmath90 . moreover , note that tcp settles the value of @xmath91 .",
    "the entire phase diagram for the model with the modified metropolis dynamics for q=4 is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasereal ] .",
    "the analogical behavior is observed for grater even values of interacting neighbors .    in this particular case ( @xmath59 ) ,",

    "the boundary between these two transition types for a given @xmath0 corresponds to the tricritical point .",
    "based on the above result , we can draw a conclusion that by altering transition probabilities at @xmath61 one can control the nature of the phase transition .",
    "moreover , lower flipping rates are connected with continuous transitions . in order to check whether indeed only the central point ( i.e. @xmath61 ) of the dynamics has this profound impact on the model behavior we investigate the system with @xmath94 rates , defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : wtan ] ) . in this case",
    ", parameter @xmath69 does not affect @xmath95 , and for all conditions @xmath96 . nonetheless , its higher value increases in general the flipping probabilities , which is clearly seen in fig .  [ fig : differentdyn ] .",

    "[ fig : phasespacemodm ] and compare the vertical section along @xmath71 in the top panel with the section along @xmath97 in the bottom one .",

    "ising model , although already 100 years old still inspires many researchers and raises new questions @xcite .",
    "recently we have introduced , under the name the @xmath0-neighbor ising model , a seemingly small modification of the kinetic ising model with metropolis dynamics allowing each spin to interact only with @xmath0 neighbors @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , this modification leads to a switch from a continuous to a discontinuous phase transition at @xmath34 , and it causes an unexpected oscillating behavior of the hysteresis for @xmath2  it expands for even values of @xmath0 and shrinks for odd values of @xmath0 .",
    "this was very puzzling phenomenon because extensive studies have shown not only that a phase transition in the equilibrium ising model is continuous but also is characterized with the same set of bulk critical exponents on quenched and annealed networks @xcite .",
    "however , recently it has been shown that the @xmath0-neighbor ising model is a limiting case of a non - equilibrium system with two heat baths ",
    "one for the ising spins at temperature @xmath4 and second for links of the graph at temperature @xmath6 @xcite . for @xmath7",
    "such a generalized model reduces to the @xmath0-neighbor ising model investigated in @xcite .",
    "this means that the @xmath0-neighbor ising model is out of equilibrium on contrary to the ising model on the annealed graph considered in @xcite .",
    "however , the question arises whether just being out of equilibrium causes tricritical behavior , i.e. , switch from continuous to discontinuous phase transition .",
    "maybe such an exotic behavior is observed exclusively for metropolis algorithm ?",
    "furthermore , what is the role of dynamics for non - equilibrium systems ?    referring above questions , we have reformulated the @xmath0-neighbor ising model in terms of the classical ising model on the @xmath0-rrg and investigated it under several different dynamics belonging to the broad class of the generalized single - spin flip glauber dynamics @xcite . on the quenched graph , which within the generalized model proposed in @xcite corresponds to the zero temperature of links ( @xmath99 ) ,",
    "all dynamics fulfill the detailed balance condition and lead to the equilibrium boltzmann distribution .",

    "for example , the model with heat - bath algorithm on the annealed network displays always a continuous phase transition , and the critical temperature only slightly deviates from the equilibrium one . on the other hand ,",
    "the generalized metropolis algorithm gives qualitatively different behavior , which depends on the model s",
    "parameter @xmath75 . for @xmath74",
    ", we obtain the original metropolis dynamics , which means that the transition switches to discontinuous at @xmath59 , and hysteresis exhibits oscillatory behavior  expanding for even values of @xmath0 and shrinking for odd values of @xmath0 . yet , for @xmath100 , the behavior is even more exotic  phase transition switches alternately from continuous to discontinuous phase transition and back .",
    "additionally , we have investigated two other types of dynamics , and it occurred that @xmath72 displays always a continuous phase transition while @xmath94 switches between two types of the phase transitions . we have observed that generally higher flipping probabilities lead to discontinuous phase transitions .",
    "we could of course propose many other dynamics which fulfill the detailed balance condition on the quenched graph , but it was not our aim .",
    "we asked the question about the role of dynamics for non - equilibrium models . on one hand",
    ", there is no excuse of referring to different dynamics or algorithms if the model is out of equilibrium , because in such a case there is no condition , such as detailed balance , which guarantees the unique steady state . on the other hand , referring to the particular dynamics within non - equilibrium models still happens @xcite .",
    "such practices are not so much surprising , because it is quite common that methods of equilibrium statistical physics are transferred to the field of non - equilibrium systems and they give often reasonable results @xcite .",
    "thus , one could have an intuition that the choice of a particular dynamics for non - equilibrium system will not influence significantly the outcome of the model .",
    "because results obtained in @xcite have shown that such an intuition may be very wrong , we have decided to examine several different dynamics and check how they would influence results in two limiting cases : quenched ( @xmath99 ) and annealed ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "we have shown that indeed some dynamics ( including heat - bath ) are more resistant to the rewriring a network and display always continuous phase transition , whereas other ( including metropolis ) are much more fragile and rewriring a network changes the type of the phase transition .",
    "furthermore , our results suggest that we can generally expect discontinuous phase transitions for higher flipping rates @xmath75 , i.e. , in fact for larger noise , which is generally interesting result and coincides with observations made in @xcite , where discontinuity has been driven by higher temperature of a network . of course there are more possibilities to to incorporate noise to the system .",
    "for example one could investigate the model on temporal network and introduce rewriring time @xmath101 , as a parameter . because @xmath102 corresponds to @xmath99 ( i.e. ,",
    "quenched network ) and @xmath103 to @xmath7 ( i.e. , annealed network ) , one could expect that there is a critical time scale @xmath104 that separates these two regimes .",
    "indeed preliminary studies confirm these predictions @xcite .",
    "it is known that switch from continuous to discontinuous phase transition can be caused by many factors . in",
    "the equilibrium statistical physics one of the best known examples is the regime - switch in the potts model ( for review see @xcite ) : for @xmath105 the model undergoes a first - order phase transition , whereas a second - order phase transition for smaller values of @xmath0 , with @xmath0 being the number of states of the spin .",
    "moreover , it is common that systems exhibiting a discontinuous phase transition in high space dimensions may display a continuous transition below a certain critical dimension @xcite .",
    "for non - equilibrium systems it has been shown that by increasing the number of interacting neighbors , the fluctuations are diminished and the transitions become sharper or even change their type to discontinuous @xcite .",
    "yet , recent research has shown that for non - equilibrium systems switch from continuous to discontinuous phase transition and related tricriticality may be also caused by a high temperature of a network @xcite or larger flipping probabilities .",
    "these results suggest that incorporating certain type of noise to the non - equilibrium system can be responsible for tricriticality . yet",
    ", this hypothesis requires further research .    however , the main outcome of this paper is the answer to the question posed in the introduction .",
    "our aim was to check if being out of equilibrium , one can still speak about the ising model with certain dynamics .",
    "as we have shown , each out of equilibrium dynamics leads to completely different behavior ",
    "some dynamics are more fragile for the non - equilibrium driving than others .",
    "in fact , it is even hard to speak about the dynamics or algorithm in case of such a non - equilibrium system because dynamics is an immanent feature of the model ."
