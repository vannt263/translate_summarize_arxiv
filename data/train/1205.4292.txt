    "recently there is growing interest to apply both mfm and ssm to magnetic superconductors , where magnetic ordering coexists with superconductivity@xcite . when a magnetic field induced by a source is applied to the magnetic superconductors , it polarizes the magnetic moments near the surface of the superconductors , which gives additional contribution to the magnetic field outside the superconductors .",
    "the polarization is characterized by the magnetic susceptibility @xmath1 in the linear response approximation .",
