    "<S> the problem of low reynolds number turbulence in active nematic fluids is theoretically addressed . using numerical simulations </S>",

    "<S> because of the profound connection between the flow geometry and the topological properties of the nematic director , the theory sheds light on the mechanisms leading to the proliferation of topological defects in active nematics and provides a number of testable predictions . a hypothesis , inspired by onsager s statistical hydrodynamics , is finally introduced to account for the equilibrium probability distribution of the vortex sizes .    the paradigm of `` active matter '' @xcite has had notable successes over the past decade in describing self - organization in a surprisingly broad class of biological and bio - inspired systems : from flocks of starlings @xcite to robots @xcite , down to bacterial colonies @xcite , motile colloids @xcite and the cell cytoskeleton @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> active systems are generic non - equilibrium assemblies of anisotropic components that are able to convert stored or ambient energy into motion . because of the interplay between internal activity and the interactions between the constituents , these systems exhibit a spectacular variety of collective behaviors that are entirely self - driven and do not require a central control mechanism .    </S>",
    "<S> a particularly interesting manifestation of collective behavior in active systems is the emergence of spatio - temporal chaos . in active bio - fluids , such as bacterial suspensions or cytoskeletal mixtures , </S>",
    "<S> the chaotic dynamics takes place through the formation of structures , such as jets or swirls , reminiscent of turbulence in newtonian fluids , in spite of the undisputed predominance of dissipation over inertia at the microscopic scale . </S>",
    "<S> examples of low reynolds number turbulence in active fluids were first reported for the case of bacterial suspensions @xcite , where this is believed to have an important impact on nutrient mixing and molecular transport at the microbiological scale .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , a series of remarkable experiments on actomyosin motility assays @xcite and suspensions of microtubles bundles and kinesin @xcite ( see fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : snapshots]a ) , have unveiled a profound link between the topological structure of the orientationally ordered constituents and the flow dynamics , suggesting that active turbulence could be mediated by unbound pairs of topological defects . according to this picture , </S>",
    "<S> the strong distortion associated with a defect , fueled by the active stresses , determines a local shear flow which in turn drives the unbinding of more defect pairs . </S>",
    "<S> similar patterns have been observed in `` living liquid crystals '' obtained from the combination of swimming bacteria and lyotropic liquid crystals @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> whether these examples of _ active turbulence _ are different realizations of the same universal mechanism or substantially different forms of spatio - temporal chaos , represents a profound and yet unsolved problem .    </S>",

    "<S> both of these approaches have been shown to be able to account for the occurrence of self - sustained low reynolds number turbulence such as that observed in the experiments on bacteria and cytoskeletal fluids , although a systematic comparison between theory and experiments is still in its infancy . </S>",

    "<S> the overlap between these `` dry '' systems and active liquid crystals remains , however , unclear .    </S>",
    "<S> in this article i report an exhaustive numerical study of turbulence in active nematics . as a starting point , </S>",
    "<S> i demonstrate that , as for inertial turbulence , low reynolds number turbulence in active nematics is , in fact , a multiscale phenomenon characterized by the formation of vortices spanning a range of length scales . within this _ active range _ , </S>",
