    "event shape variables in @xmath0 annihilation provide an ideal testing ground to study quantum chromo - dynamics ( qcd ) and have been measured and studied extensively in the last three decades .",
    "in particular , event shape variables are interesting for studying the interplay between perturbative and non - perturbative dynamics @xcite .",
    "one of the most common and successful ways of testing qcd has been by investigating the distribution of event shapes in @xmath1 , which have been measured accurately over a range of centre - of - mass energies , and provide a useful way of evaluating the strong coupling constant @xmath2 .",
    "the main obstruction to obtaining an accurate value of @xmath2 from distributions is not due to a lack of precise data but to dominant errors in the theoretical calculation of the distributions . in particular , there are non - perturbative effects that can not yet be calculated from first principles but cause power - suppressed corrections that can be signicant at experimentally accessible energy scales @xcite .    in this article , we show the cross section for c- parameter as an event shape observable .",
    "also we peruse both perturbative and non - perturbative theory for calculating coupling constants using different models .it",
    "is mentioned that we have already done some analyses on some event shape observables in our previous publications @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as the following : in sect.2 we define and review the c - parameter and show the cross section distribution for different energies . in sect.3 , we present the calculations of the perturbative theory as well as the non - perturbative theory up to the next to next to leading order ( nnlo ) .",
    "we also achieve similar calculations for both the dispersive and the shape function models . and",
    "finally we extract the coupling constant from our analysis .",
    "the last section summarizes our conclusions .",
    "the c parameter @xcite for electron@xmath3positron annihilation events is derived from the eigenvalues @xmath4 of the linearized momentum tensor @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath6 where @xmath7 are the spatial components @xmath8 of the _ i - th _ particle momentum in the centre of mass frame .",
    "the sum on _ i _ runs over all the final state particles . if @xmath4 are the eigenvalues of the matrix , we have : @xmath9    the real symmetric matrix @xmath5 has eigenvalues @xmath4 with @xmath10 .",
    "it describes an ellipsoid with orthogonal axes named minor , semi - major and major corresponding to the three eigenvalues .",
    "the major axis is similar but not identical to @xmath11 .",
    "the c parameter varies in the range @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath13 corresponds to a perfect two jet event ( with massless jets ) , while @xmath14 characterizes a spherical event .",
    "planar events including in particular the @xmath15 perturbative result , are distributed in the range @xmath16 .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the distribution for c - parameter @xmath17 by using the monte carlo data ( pythia program ) in different center of mass energies .",
    "we see that the values are between 0 and 1 for all energies .",
    "we observe a decreasing trend for all distributions by increasing the c parameter .",
    "the figure also indicates that there is not a significant difference on the distributions between different energies .",
    "we conclude that this parameter is insensitive to the data of different energies .",
    " qcd calculations based on nlo perturbation theory as well as nnlo theory are available for many observables in high energy particle reactions , like the total hadronic cross section in @xmath18 and moments in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) processes and also in hadronic decay .",
    "the complicated nature of qcd , due to the process of gluon self coupling and the resulting large number of feynman diagrams in higher orders of perturbation theory , so far limited the number of qcd calculations in complete nnlo @xcite .",
    "we shall explain the methods of calculation for nlo and nnlo theories .",
    "we also give an explanation of other ways for calculating the coupling constant such as the dispersive model and also the shape function model .",
    "these models include perturbative and non - perturbative regions .",
    "one of the aspects where the study of event shapes has taught us general lessons about qcd is the interplay between perturbative and non  perturbative corrections .",
    "the phenomenological success of renormalization based on models for power corrections has important consequences .    in event - shape moments _ ( y )",
    "_ , one expects the hadronization corrections to be additive , such that they can be divided into a perturbative and a non - perturbative contribution @xcite ,    @xmath19    now we explicate these theories and models in the following :      the perturbative expansion of a differential distribution weighted of the observable y can be written for any infrared - safe observable for the process @xmath18 .",
    "the main theoretical feature of jet observables is that they can be computed in qcd perturbation theory . as a result ,",
    "jets observables are finite ( calculable ) at the partonic level order by order in perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "if we assume the nlo theory only , we can compute its corresponding perturbative expansion in the form @xmath20 @xmath21 gives the lo result and @xmath22 the nlo correction .",
    "@xmath23 denotes the total hadronic cross section calculated up to the relevant order .",
    "the arbitrary renormalization scale is denoted by @xmath24 .",
    "all observables are chosen such that they take values between 0 and 1 .",
    "now if we add the third sentence to above expansion , we will have the nnlo theory .",
    "@xmath25 @xmath26 gives the nnlo correction .",
    "the perturbative contribution to @xmath27 is given up to nnlo in terms of the dimensionless coefficients @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 as @xcite : @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are straightforwardly related to @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 : @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 that @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are given in table [tab1] also the constant @xmath40 is given by @xcite : @xmath41 @xmath42.\\ ] ]    .[tab1 ] contributions to c - parameter at lo , nlo and nnlo @xcite .

    "fitting variance by using the shape function model . ]",
    "both tables indicate that our values for the coupling constant in perturbative and in the non - perturbative regions are in good agreement with the qcd predictions .",
    "they are also consistent with those obtained from other experiments @xcite .",
