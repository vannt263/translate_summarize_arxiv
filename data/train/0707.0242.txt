    "confinement of electrons at the nanoscale leads naturally to energy level quantization and charging effects .",
    "in small quantum dots coulomb blockade becomes a dominant effect as shown in conductance experiments.@xcite this effect , together with the enhancement of the low - temperature conductance in the valley between coulomb blockade peaks  a signature of the well known kondo effect@xcite  makes evident that electron - electron correlations play a central role in these systems . since the early experiments in quantum dots,@xcite the kondo effect has also been observed in a variety of molecules .",
    "the conductance of molecular systems like c@xmath3 molecules , co and cu complexes connected to metallic leads or carbon nanotubes , shows the signature of kondo - like behavior.@xcite in these molecular junctions , the molecule is coupled to the source and drain leads providing a path for charge transport . in some cases a third gate electrode",
    "is used to create an external potential that modifies the energy of the molecular orbitals .",
    "the use of normal , ferromagnetic and superconducting electrodes gives rise to a rich behavior and opens new alternatives for the study of the interplay between kondo screening and electronic correlations in the leads .",
    "in addition , transport through highly structured molecules like the mn@xmath4 , a single molecular magnet , has been reported@xcite and the kondo effect has been predicted to occur in this type of systems for both half - integer@xcite and integer values of the molecular spin.@xcite    despite of the substantial theoretical and experimental activity devoted to the study of molecular transistors there are still many open questions . while the theoretical frame for the study of the kondo effect in semiconducting quantum dots and molecular systems is basically the same , there are some fundamental differences between them .",
    "namely , vibrational modes can play a central role in the single electron transfer through molecules .",
    "in fact , molecules distort upon the addition or the removal of electrons leading to a large electron - phonon interaction . as the coulomb charging energies in these systems can be considerably reduced by screening due to the electrodes,@xcite electronic and vibrational energies can become of the same order of magnitude generating scenarios where novel effects may emerge.@xcite    the effect of the coupling between electronic excitations and vibronic states in molecular transistors depends on the symmetry and frequency of the vibrating mode and on the strength of the coupling .",
    "symmetric modes with a holstein coupling between quantized vibrations and electronic levels may strongly renormalize the molecular parameters reducing charging energies @xcite and producing anomalous behavior of the kondo temperature versus applied gate voltages.@xcite asymmetric modes coupled to the tunnel - barriers parameters , like the center of mass motion mode , can dynamically open new channels for electron transport.@xcite due to the large variety of magnetic molecules that could be incorporated in molecular circuits with different chemical environments , it is important to characterize and understand the behavior of molecular transistors with different vibronic and electronic structures .    in this work",
    "we discuss the electronic transport through a magnetic molecule with spin @xmath5 and @xmath2 in the kondo limit .",
    "we use slave boson techniques and include the electron - phonon interaction with different coupling constants .",
    "we show that in the presence of vibrational modes , the low temperature behavior in the case of @xmath2 corresponds to a two channel kondo problem .",

    "below we present a slave boson mean - field approach to describe this situation .    before finishing this section",
    "we would like to emphasize that in our model there is only one hybridized orbital so that the two channels character arises only from the coupling to the phonons .",
