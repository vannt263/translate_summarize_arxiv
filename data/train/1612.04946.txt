    "over the two past decades agb and post - agb supergiants and several luminous stars with unclear evolutionary status have been spectroscopically monitored with the 6-m telescope of the special astrophysical observatory ( author of the program ",
    "klochkova ) .",
    "main results of this long - term study are presented by @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we consider some details of the optical spectra of one of the objects of this program  far evolved star v534lyr = hd172324 .",
    "v534lyr is a pulsating variable post - agb star with the galactic coordinates : l=66.2@xmath4 , b=18.6@xmath4 .",
    "its spectral class a0iab was determined by @xcite , physical properties and chemical composition of the atmosphere are studied by @xcite .",
    "this work is based on five high resolution spectra ( r=60000 ) obtained with the nes echelle spectrograph @xcite of the 6-m russian telescope ( bta ) in 2010 and 2013 .",
    "extraction of one - dimensional spectra from two - dimensional echelle images was conducted with the modified variant by @xcite of the echelle context of the midas package .",
    "wavelength calibration was carried out from the spectra of a th  ar hollow - cathode lamp .",
    "one - dimensional spectra were reduced in the dech20 t code @xcite .",
    "radial velocities were measured through fitting of the direct and mirror images of line profiles .",
    "the fitting of spectra of the star and the lamp was checked using the [ oi ] , o@xmath5 , and h@xmath5o telluric lines .",
    "the root - mean - square error of the radial velocity vr for narrow absorptions is 1.0km / s at most .",
    "the table shows the data on the spectra and average heliocentric velocities vr for several groups of lines .",
    "columns 36 contain the averaged vr for :    * feii  6318 , 6384 , and 6385 emissions , * hei and sii absorption core , * components core of the feii absorptions of high excitation ( potentials of lower levels are equal to about 10 ev ) , * components core of the feii absorptions of low excitation ( potentials of lower levels are equal to @xmath61ev ) respectively .",

    "each line corresponds to one or two signs ( in cases of bifuricated absorptions ) .",
    "as distinct from other super and hypergiants , for this star they are not stationary and show velocities close to those for unsplit absorptions .",
    "the table and figure obviously show the position variations of all the lines and shapes of profiles of some of them with time .",
    "this primarily refers to the splitting of feii absorptions of low excitation forming in the upper atmospheric layers ; the absorptions of high excitation forming deeper stay single .",
    "the radial velocity gradient in the v534lyr atmosphere is minimum , 30.07.10 and 24.09.10 : differential shifts of lines are close to measurement errors . on that basis , one can suppose that center - of - mass velocity of the star , vsys , is close to @xmath17km / s ( v@xmath25km / s ) .",
    "the spectral class a0iab corresponds to the distance to v534lyr , d@xmath26kpc .",
    "interstellar line profiles of nai  ( 1 ) and caii  ( 1 ) are also indicative of great distance : the presence of the components with vr=@xmath27km / s in them indicates d@xmath28kpc as in @xcite . notable proper motion ( 3.6@xmath290.8mas ) at d@xmath26kpc",
    "is corresponding to 103km / s ; the star is near to the galactic plane . in combination with v@xmath25km / s",
    ", it yields a spatial velocity of about 140km / s .    using the model atmospheres method and the models set by @xcite",
    ", we obtained the effective temperature t@xmath0=10500k , surface gravity logg=2.5 , and microturbulent velocity @xmath1=4.0km / s .",
    "the underabundance of the iron group elements @xmath2_{\\odot } = -0.50}$ ] was also calculated with this atmospheric model .",
    "this fact as well as high spatial velocity indicates that v534lyr does not belong to the disk population .    among stars we studied earlier , the anomalous supergiant uuher",
    ", the prototype of the class of variable supergiants located at high galactic latitudes may be considered as a nearest analogy of v534lyr . based on several high - resolution spectroscopy of the star over 5 years with the 6m telescope , @xcite found a low metallcity @xmath30_{\\odot } = -1.32}$ ] and the large radial velocity @xmath31km / s . in whole obtained results led these authors to conclude that uuher is a low - mass star beyond galactic disk .",
