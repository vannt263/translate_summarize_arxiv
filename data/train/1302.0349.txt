    "a natural question regarding a pair of unitary matrices that almost commute is : how close is this to a pair that actually commutes ?",
    "the answer to this question necessarily involves the @xmath0-theory of the two - torus . before we get to new results ,",
    "let us review how this connection arose .",
    "there is a particularly practical formula for the projection @xmath1 in @xmath2 that has rank one and first chern class one .",
    "the formula is similar to that of the rieffel projections @xcite in the irrational rotation algebras , specifically @xmath3\\ ] ] where @xmath4 @xmath5 and @xmath6 are certain real functions defined on the unit circle .",
    "the straight - forward plan in @xcite was to compute the @xmath0-theory of a @xmath7-homomorphism @xmath8 by examining the associated commuting unitary elements @xmath9 and @xmath10 of the af algebra @xmath11 and the projection @xmath12\\ ] ] where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the canonical generating unitaries in @xmath15 .",
    "this formula applies also to a pair of almost commuting unitary matrices , @xmath16 and @xmath17 that approximate @xmath18 and @xmath19 , leading not to a projection , but a hermitian matrix with a large gap at zero in its spectrum .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath20 then determines the @xmath0-theory of @xmath21 , but it was also used in @xcite to define the bott index of the pair @xmath22 .",
    "this index can distinguish pairs of commuting matrices close to commuting pairs from those that are far from commuting pairs .",
    "this fact turned out to be more interesting than the @xmath0-theory of the specific @xmath21 being studied at the time .",
    "there is ambiguity in the choice of @xmath23 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "there are other ambiguities , discussed in @xcite , such that the fact that @xmath24 could just as well been interpreted as @xmath25 to get good quantitative results about the distance to the closest commuting pair of unitary matrices , we will select our functions and formulas very carefully .    in 1986 the only numerical computation of the bott index that was practical involved relatively small matrices where @xmath17 was diagonal .",
    "today we have from physics @xcite large matrices where neither is diagonal .",
    "the cost of computing @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 depends heavily on the choices in the scalar functions on the circle .",
    "we end up with choices for @xmath23 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 that are very similar to the smooth functions illustrated in @xcite , although we do nt select them to have rapidly decreasing fourier coefficients .",
    "we select functions that are well approximated by degree - five trigonometric polynomials and where the fourier series are relatively easy to calculate .    soon after the bott index was introduced , we found in joint work with exel @xcite that a simpler formula based on winding numbers can be used .",
    "we only proved that this formula worked for sufficiently small commutator norms . here",
    "we will find a concrete @xmath29 so that @xmath30\\right\\vert \\leq\\delta_{0}$ ] implies the two invariants are equal .",
    "we begin with a survey , and some improved theorems , of the winding number index of @xcite .",
    "our expectation is that quantitative results regarding almost commuting matrices will be useful in applications , especially in relation to topological insulators @xcite .",
    "we follow mathematical conventions , so @xmath31 refers to the conjugate - transpose when @xmath16 is a matrix . to accommodate time reversal invariance in physics , we need to consider what in physics is called the dual operation , @xmath32^{\\sharp}=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc } d^{\\mathrm{t } } & -b^{\\mathrm{t}}\\\\ -c^{\\mathrm{t } } & a^{\\mathrm{t } } \\end{array}\\right].\\ ] ]    our main result , from the standpoint of physics , is theorem  [ thm : logtheorem ] .",
    "it relates the spin chern number of a finite system in 2d as follows .",
    "as discussed in length in @xcite , the position operators , assume the geometry of the model is the torus , are two commuting unitary matrices , but the band - compressed position operators are almost commuting matrices acting on low - energy space that are almost unitary .",
    "if the signalization of the hamiltonian is done preserving symmetry , if we start in class ai we end up with matrices @xmath11 and @xmath33 so that @xmath34 and @xmath35 and only have approximate relation @xmath36 if we compute any approximate self - dual logarithm @xmath37 of @xmath33 , meaning @xmath38 and @xmath39 and @xmath40 , then the spin chern number of the system will be even or odd depending on the sign of @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a specific matrix discussed below that creates anti - symmetry in the formula so that that pfaffian makes sense .",
    "of course the logarithm , as a matrix function , will be discontinuous as we can not assume anything about the spectrum of @xmath11 and @xmath33 beyond kramers doubling .",
    "put another way , the various self - dual approximate logarithms of @xmath33 are far apart , so it is not even clear that the sign of the pfaffian is well defined .",
    "there is a separate issue of how to compute approximate logarithms of almost unitary matrices , and how to be sure to get a self - dual output given a self - dual input .",
    "that is discussed in a separate paper @xcite .    in practice , it is feasible to simply compute the unitary parts of @xmath11 and * @xmath33 * before computing further , so @xmath43 which is unitary and self - dual , as is @xmath44 the comparison of@xmath30\\right\\vert $ ] with @xmath45\\right\\vert $ ] is not hard . for the rest of the paper",
    "we discuss self - dual matrices .",
    "we discuss the pfaffian - bott index , which depends only on @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( or @xmath11 and @xmath33 ) but was shown ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 5.8 ) to equal the spin chern index , at least for large systems and other mild assumptions .",
    "our results on the pfaffian - bott index are quantitative , but the correspondence with spin chern numbers is not quantitative",
    ". this will be possible once certain new quantitative results concerning localization of wannier functions or concerning approximation by commuting matrices are developed .",
    "our results are principally stated in terms of unitary matrices .",
    "however , the study of almost commuting unitary element of @xmath46-algebras is not that different .",
    "we know this because we know that the soft - torus is rfd @xcite .",
    "we are not prepared to make such a statement about unitary elements in real @xmath47-algebras , in part because the theory of generators and relations for real @xmath46-algebras @xcite is still rather new and unfamiliar .",
    "given two unitary matrices @xmath16 and @xmath17 with @xmath48\\right\\vert $ ] , we find @xmath49\\right\\vert\\ ] ] and so by the spectral theorem @xmath50 thus when @xmath51 we can define @xmath52 for @xmath53 between @xmath54 and @xmath55 , using a branch of @xmath56 with discontinuity on the negative @xmath57-axis .",
    "this is a continuous path of unitary matrices from @xmath58 to @xmath59 and @xmath60 so @xmath61 is a loop on the unit circle .",
    "we define @xmath62 to be the winding number of this path .",
    "this winding number invariant is very computable .",
    "there are a few alternate formulas , including @xmath63 which we easily prove : since in some basis @xmath59 is diagonal and unitary , @xmath64 for some @xmath65 and @xmath66 and @xmath67 and this path has winding number @xmath68    when @xmath16 and @xmath17 are commuting unitary matrices , @xmath69 .    in this case the path of determinants is the constant path .",
    "[ lem : cyclicshift ] for @xmath70 we have @xmath71 .",
    "we find @xmath72 and so @xmath73    it is easy to modify the example in lemma  [ lem : cyclicshift ] to get a pair of unitary matrices with @xmath30\\right\\vert = \\delta$ ] and @xmath74 for any @xmath75 and any @xmath76 .",

    "if @xmath77 then the distance to a commuting pair of unitary matrices exceeds @xmath55 , meaning @xmath78 whenever @xmath79 and @xmath80 are unitary matrices with @xmath81 .",
    "indeed , @xmath82    the proof of this will be broken into lemmas and propositions .",

    "if no such @xmath88 existed then @xmath90 is a homotopy between the path that determines @xmath91 and the path that determines @xmath92 .",

    "it is important here that we stick with the operator norm in defining `` close approximation '' as the answers to these sort of questions can change dramatically if considering the frobenius norm @xcite .",
    "( in particular , see the discussion in section iii in @xcite . )",
    "results such as this also change dramatically when the matrices come from different symmetry classes , as seen in @xcite .",
    "there is an answer , but it is only a non - quantitative , nonconstructive result for small @xmath102 .",
    "this is theorem  6.15 in @xcite and we repeat it here .",
    "also it matters that we are only interested in results for unitaries in @xmath103 that are _ independent of @xmath104 _ @xcite .",
