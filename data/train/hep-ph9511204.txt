    "@xmath5 colliders have made important contributions to our understanding of the electroweak interactions@xcite and it is expected that this tradition will continue with the advent of higher luminosity and higher energy machines . in the near future the cern lep-200 @xmath5 collider@xcite will begin operation and beyond that there is a growing effort directed towards the design and construction of future high energy @xmath5 linear colliders with @xmath22  gev which we will refer to generically as the next linear collider ( nlc)@xcite .",
    "one of the primary physics goals of lep-200 and an important goal of the nlc is to make precision measurements of @xmath3 boson properties including @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath3-boson interactions with fermions and the photon and @xmath25 .    the latter measurements , that of the trilinear gauge boson vertices ( tgv s ) provides a stringent test of the gauge structure of the standard model@xcite .",
    "the current measurement of these couplings are rather weak . using a popular parametrization of the cp conserving gauge boson couplings , indirect measurements of tgv s via radiative corrections to precision electroweak measurements@xcite give the following limits@xcite : @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 . however , there are ambiguities in these calculations associated with running the couplings down from the scale of new physics to low energy so that these limits are not particularly rigorous and it is necessary to use direct measurements for more reliable bounds",
    ". the cdf and d0 collaborations at the tevatron @xmath31 collider at fermilab , using the processes @xmath32 , have obtained the direct 95% c.l .",
    "limits of @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "these measurements are quite weak but it is expected that they will improve as the luminosity of the tevatron increases . in the longer term measurements at the large hadron collider at cern will improve these limits considerably@xcite .",
    "it is expected that measurements at high energy @xmath5 colliders will surpass those at the hadron colliders . as a result",
    ", many processes have been studied to determine their usefulness for measuring the tgv s ; @xmath37 @xcite , @xmath38 @xcite , @xmath39@xcite , @xmath40 @xcite , @xmath41@xcite , @xmath42 @xcite and more detailed studies of various four fermion final states in the process @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "probably the most useful of the @xmath42 channels for these studies is @xmath44 . with only one unobserved neutrino",
    "this channel has several advantages : it can be fully reconstructed using the constraint of the initial beam energies , the @xmath45 and @xmath46 can be discriminated using lepton charge identification , it does not have the qcd backgrounds that plague the fully hadronic decay modes , and it offers much higher statistics than the fully leptonic modes . as a result of the importance of this channel there have been numerous studies of this process . in particular , there is a growing list of analysis of @xmath47 , @xmath5 to four fermion final state processes @xcite , single @xmath3 production@xcite , electroweak radiative corrections to these reactions including the important contribution from initial state radiation @xcite , and the sensitivity of these processes to anomalous @xmath1 and @xmath48 gauge boson couplings ( tgv s ) .    in this paper",
    "we examine in detail the four fermion final state @xmath49 where @xmath50 is either @xmath51 or @xmath52 and @xmath53 can be either @xmath54 or @xmath55 .",
    "we study this process for the centre of mass energies @xmath4  gev appropriate to lep200 , and @xmath6 and 1000  gev appropriate to the nlc . to obtain results we included all tree level diagrams to the four fermion final states using helicity amplitude techniques . for the @xmath56 final state",
    "10 diagrams contribute and for the @xmath57 final state 20 diagrams contribute .",
    "our primary interest is to study the sensitivity of these processes to anomalous gauge boson couplings .",
    "to do so we examined numerous distributions . for the purpose of comparing theory to experiment",
    "we also examined the question of whether the approximation of only including the resonant diagrams is adequate or whether the full four - fermion final state calculation is needed . using helicity amplitudes we are able to study the usefulness of initial state polarization in extracting the tgv s . in the @xmath58 final state single @xmath3 production",
    "can also be studied@xcite where the @xmath1 vertex can be isolated from the @xmath2 vertex by imposing an appropriate cut on the outgoing electron . in this case , when only hadronic jets are observed and not the outgoing lepton , there are ambiguities in identifying the charge of the @xmath3 besides problems with hadronic backgrounds which we do not deal with here .",
    "a detailed analysis of single @xmath3 production will be presented elsewhere @xcite .    in the next section",
    "we discuss effective lagrangians and the various parametrizations used to describe gauge boson self interactions which have appeared in the literature . in section iii we describe our calculation .",
    "section iv comprises the bulk of the paper which is used to present and discuss our results .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in section v.",
    "the formalism of effective lagrangians provides a well - defined framework for investigating the physics of anomalous couplings and electroweak symmetry breaking @xcite . in this approach an infinite set of non - renormalizable operators , consistent with the unbroken symmetries and whose coefficients parametrize the low - energy effects of electroweak symmetry breaking or",
    "new physics are organized in an energy expansion . at low energy",
    "only a finite number of terms contribute to a given process . at higher energies more and more terms",
    "become important until the whole process breaks down at the scale of new physics .",
    "one focuses on the leading operators in the expansion .",
    "there are three main parametrizations of gauge boson couplings that appear in the literature .",
    "the characteristic distinguishing the approaches is the degree to which constraints are imposed in terms of the symmetry and particle content of the low energy theory .",
    "we summarize the most commonly used parametrizations below@xcite .",
    "the first approach is to describe the @xmath59 verticies using the most general parametrization possible that respects lorentz invariance , electromagnetic gauge invariance and @xmath60 invariance @xcite .",
    "this approach has become the standard parametrization used in phenomenology making the comparison of the sensitivity of different measurements to the tgv s straightforward .",
    "we do not consider cp violating operators in this paper as they are tightly constrained by measurement of the neutron electric dipole moment which constrains the two cp violating parameters to @xmath61 @xcite . with these constraints",
    "the @xmath1 and @xmath2 vertices have five free independent parameters , @xmath7 , @xmath10 , @xmath9 , @xmath13 and @xmath12 and is given by @xcite : @xmath62 where the subscript @xmath63 denotes either a photon or a @xmath25 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 represents the photon or @xmath25 and @xmath46 fields respectively , @xmath66 and @xmath67 and @xmath23 is the @xmath3 boson mass .",
    "( @xmath68 is constrained by electromagnetic gauge invariance to be equal to 1 . )",
    "the first two terms correspond to dimension 4 operators and the third term corresponds to a dimension 6 operator .",
    "the mass in the denominator of the dimension 6 term would correspond to the scale of new physics , typically of order 1  tev .",
    "however , it has become the convention to use @xmath23 so that the @xmath3 magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole can be written in a form similar to that of the muon .",
    "nevertheless , one expects the dimension 6 operator to be suppressed with respect to the dimension 4 operators by a factor of @xmath69 .",
    "higher dimension operators correspond to momentum dependence@xcite in the form factors which are not so important in the process we are considering so are not included .",
    "at tree level the standard model ( sm ) requires @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "typically , radiative corrections from heavy particles will change @xmath18 by about @xmath72 and @xmath19 by about @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "in particular , the contributions from a 200  gev top quark and a 150  gev higgs boson to @xmath18 and @xmath19 are of order @xmath74 .",
    "the nearness of the @xmath75 parameter to 1 implies an @xmath76 invariance of the weak interaction .",
    "imposing this from the outset implies a relationship between the parameters reducing the number of parameters from 5 to 3 @xcite .",
    "@xmath76 invariance is the basis of the other two parametrizations we mention .",
    "the difference between the two is that in the first , the higgs boson is heavy so that goldstone bosons are nonlinearly realized while in the second , the higgs bosons are light , leading to linearly realized goldstone bosons .",
    "the second commonly used parametrization is the chiral lagrangian approach@xcite .",
    "a custodial @xmath76 is assumed which is supported to high accuracy by the nearness of the @xmath75 parameter to 1 .",
    "this approach assumes that the theory has no light higgs particles and the electroweak gauge bosons interact strongly with each other above approximately 1  tev .",
    "this can be described by a non - linear realization of the @xmath77 symmetry in a chiral lagrangian formalism leading to the effective lagrangian : @xmath78 -i g ' { { l_{9r}}\\over{16\\pi^2 } } tr [ b^{\\mu\\nu } d_\\mu \\sigma^\\dagger d_\\nu \\sigma ] + g g'{{l_{10}}\\over{16\\pi^2 } } tr [ \\sigma b^{\\mu\\nu } \\sigma^\\dagger w_{\\mu\\nu}]\\ ] ] where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the @xmath76 and @xmath81 field strength tensors given in terms of @xmath82 by @xmath83 ) \\nonumber\\\\ b_{\\mu\\nu } & = & { 1\\over 2 } ( \\partial _ \\mu b_\\nu -\\partial_\\nu",

    "@xmath93 contributes to the gauge boson self energies where it is tightly constrained to @xmath94 @xcite so we will not consider it further .",
    "new physics contributions are expected to result in values of @xmath95 of order 1@xcite .      in the linear realization",
    "scenario@xcite the higgs doublet field @xmath96 is included in the low energy particle content .",
    "this approach assumes that any deviations from the standard model due to new physics manifests themselves in @xmath97 gauge invariant singlet operators .",
    "there are 7 relevant operators of which four are stringently constrained by the high precision low energy and @xmath87 boson data @xcite .",
    "the remaining three can give rise to non - standard couplings @xmath98\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it seems most likely that anomalous couplings in the light higgs linear scenario would best be studied by measuring the properties and couplings of the higgs boson directly . in any case the parameters from this approach can be rewritten in terms of the parameters of the first two lagrangians discussed .",
    "the parameters from the three lagrangians can be mapped onto each other : @xmath99 dropping the @xmath93 term , the linear and non - linear realizations are obtained from each other by identifying @xmath100 and @xmath101 . in the non - linear realization ,",
    "the counterpart of @xmath102 is higher dimension .",
    "to study the process @xmath103 we included all tree level diagrams to the four fermion final states .",
    "there are 10 diagrams contributing to the @xmath104 final state which are shown in fig .",
    "the gauge boson coupling we are studying is present in diagram ( 1a ) .",
    "this , along with diagram ( 1b ) are the diagrams responsible for real @xmath3 production . for the @xmath57 final state the 10 diagrams shown in fig .",
    "2 must also be included with those of fig . 1 for a total of 20 diagrams .",
    "diagram ( 2a ) includes a tgv .",
    "the diagrams with t - channel photon exchange make large contributions to single @xmath3 production due to the pole in the photon propagator which can be used to isolate the @xmath1 vertex from the @xmath2 vertex @xcite .",
    "we include final width effects by using vector boson propagators of the form @xmath105 which yields a gauge invariant result .",
    "strictly speaking we should have included a momentum dependent vector boson width but this leads to problems with gauge invariance@xcite .",
    "although a number of solutions to this problem have been discussed @xcite the difference between our treatment and more rigorous ones have a totally negligible effect on the tgv sensitivities we obtain from our analysis .",
    "a more rigorous treatment must of course be included in monte carlo simulations that will be used to analyze real experimental data .",
    "we will find that the non - resonant diagrams make non - negligible contributions to cross sections and are dependent on the kinematic cuts used in the analysis .",
    "these contributions are at least as important as electroweak radiative corrections .",
    "to evaluate the cross - sections and different distributions , we used the calkul helicity amplitude technique @xcite to obtain expressions for the matrix elements and performed the phase space integration using monte carlo techniques @xcite .",
    "the expressions for the helicity amplitudes are lengthy and unilluminating so we do not include them here . to obtain numerical results we used the values @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 gev , @xmath109 gev , @xmath110 gev , and @xmath111 gev . in our results we included two generations of quarks and took them to be massless . in order to take into account finite detector acceptance",
    "we require that the lepton and quarks are at least 10 degrees away from the beam and have at least 10  gev energy unless otherwise noted . in principle",
    "we should include qed radiative corrections from soft photon emission and the backgrounds due to a photon that is lost down the beam pipe @xcite .",
    "these backgrounds are well understood and detector dependent .",
    "we assume the approach taken at lep , that these effects can best be taken into account by the experimental collaborations . in any case , although initial state radiation must be taken into account their inclusion does not substantially effect the bounds we obtain and therefore our conclusions .    in figure 3 and table i",
    "we show the cross sections for the processes @xmath112 for different applications of cuts on the invariant mass of the lepton - neutrino pair and the @xmath53 pair ; @xmath113  gev where @xmath114 is the invariant mass of the @xmath115 and @xmath53 pair respectively .",
    "imposing the cut on one fermion pair gives the single @xmath3 cross section and imposing the cut on both fermion pairs gives the @xmath3-pair production cross section . in both cases the single @xmath3 and @xmath3 pair thresholds",
    "are clearly seen . although the single @xmath3 production cross section is nonzero below the @xmath3-pair production threshold , it is still too small to obtain adequate statistics to perform studies of @xmath3 boson properties . in general",
    "the electron mode has a larger cross - section than the muon mode .",
    "the difference is small at 175  gev but becomes increasingly larger at higher energy as the t - channel photon exchange becomes increasingly important , reaching a factor of 5 at 1  tev . for the muon mode the invariant mass cuts reduce the cross - section by 10% to 20% depending on @xmath116 irrespective of whether the cut is on @xmath117 or @xmath118 .",
    "the relatively small effect of these cuts verifies the dominance of the resonant diagrams on the total cross section .",
    "for the electron mode the results are similar when the @xmath119  gev cut is imposed which constrains the @xmath120 pair to be on the @xmath3 mass - shell .",
    "however when @xmath121  gev ( ie .",
    "@xmath122 ) the cross section is significantly larger than the previous case due to the enhancement arising from the non - resonant t - channel photon exchange diagrams of fig .",
    "2 . with appropriate kinematic cuts",
    "this can be used to study single-@xmath3 production @xcite .",
    "despite the relative smallness of the off - resonance contributions to the muon mode they still contribute up to 30% of the cross section at 1  tev .",
    "clearly , they must be properly included when making high precision tests of standard model processes .",
    "for the electron mode they are even more important and are interesting in the context of single @xmath3 production .",
    "the above points can be amplified by examining kinematic distributions .",
    "in addition , since our goal is to extract measurements of the tgv s , we must explore which distributions are most sensitive to anomalous couplings .",
    "for descriptive purposes we will show various distributions for @xmath6  gev .",
    "we begin by showing in fig .",
    "4 the invariant mass distributions for the @xmath120 ( @xmath123 ) and @xmath124 ( @xmath125 ) pairs for left and right handed initial electron polarization . as the unpolarized cross sections are dominated by the left handed electrons they are quite similar to them , so we do not include them separately .",
    "in addition , the @xmath126 invariant mass distributions for left handed initial electrons are similar to the @xmath125 distributions .",
    "since there are differences for the right handed initial electron distributions , these distributions are also included .",
    "the differences in these cross sections reflects the differences and relative importance in the feynman diagrams that contribute to a process .",
    "although the cross sections and the sensitivities to the tgv s are dominated by the production of real @xmath3 s one can see that off - resonance production of the @xmath127 final state can be quite sensitive to anomalous couplings .",
    "we will explore this in a later section .",
    "the effects are especially pronounced for the @xmath128 final state where there is the possibility of single @xmath3 production which is discussed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we examined numerous distributions with the purpose of finding the distributions and isolating the regions of phase space most sensitive to anomalous couplings ; @xmath129 there is , of course , overlap among the regions of interest in these distributions . to gauge the sensitivity of these distributions to the tgv s we typically divided them into 4-bins and performed a @xmath130 analysis . for @xmath6  gev and integrated luminosity of 50  fb@xmath14 we found , for example , that the @xmath131 s could be measured to a couple of percent at 95% confidence level .",
    "it turns out that this is not competitive with a more sophisticated analysis of angular distributions we will describe below .",
    "generally , this is because the phase space regions with the highest statistics are least sensitive to anomalous couplings and tend to overwhelm deviations while the regions most sensitive to tgv s have poor statistics .    for the purpose of understanding @xmath3-boson properties the most interesting distributions are the various angular distributions .",
    "to understand this better it is useful to first consider the @xmath3 pair production cross section without decays to fermions@xcite . to leading order the amplitude for @xmath3 pair - production",
    "is given by three diagrams ; via an s - channel photon , an s - channel @xmath25 and a t - channel neutrino exchange .",
    "the cross sections at different @xmath132 , 500 , and 1000  gev , for @xmath133 , @xmath134 , and @xmath135 , different initial state polarizations , and as a function of the @xmath3 scattering angle are shown in fig .",
    "5 @xcite . for the initial state",
    "@xmath136 only the first two diagrams contribute which at high energy is dominated by longitudinal @xmath3 ( @xmath137 ) production .",
    "due to the delicate cancellations between the diagrams it is @xmath137 production which is most sensitive to anomalous couplings . in contrast , the cross section for the @xmath138 initial state produces both transverse and longitudinal @xmath3 bosons with comparable rates .",
    "the @xmath139 cross section is dominated by a peak in the forward direction with respect to the incoming @xmath140 associated with the t - channel neutrino exchange which is made up entirely of transverse @xmath3 production .",
    "this contribution is relatively insensitive to new physics .",
    "the cross sections in the backward direction includes sizable longitudinal @xmath3 production accounting for about 25% of the total cross section in the backward hemisphere .",
    "however , in the backward direction where the s - channel diagrams contribute substantially , the cross section for @xmath141 is always quite small . for @xmath141",
    "there is a large change in the magnitude of the cross - section but only a small change in its shape .",
    "any disruption of the delicate gauge theory cancellations leads to large changes to the standard model results . for @xmath137 production",
    "amplitudes the enhancements can be a factor of @xmath142 .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "6 where the angular distribution of the outgoing @xmath3 is plotted for several values of anomalous couplings at @xmath6  gev .",
    "because it is the longitudinal @xmath3 production which is most sensitive to anomalous couplings , and because the cross section is dominated by transverse @xmath3 production it is crucial to disentangle the @xmath137 from the @xmath143 _ background_. the most convenient means of doing so makes use of the angular distribution of the @xmath3 decay products . defining @xmath144 and @xmath145 as the angle between the @xmath50 or @xmath146 and the @xmath3 momentum measured in the @xmath3 rest frame , the angular distribution in @xmath147 peaks about @xmath148 for longitudinally polarized @xmath3 bosons and at forward or backward angles for transversely polarized bosons . in addition the parity violation of the @xmath3 couplings distinguishes the two polarization states adding to the effectiveness of the decay as a polarimeter .",
    "thus the angular distributions can be used to extract information about the @xmath3 boson polarizations . in fig .",
    "7 we show the angular distributions for the outgoing quark with respect to the @xmath3 direction ( @xmath145 ) for the three bins in the @xmath3 scattering angle , @xmath149 , @xmath150 and @xmath151 , ( where we take @xmath152 to be the @xmath46 angle with respect to the incoming @xmath140 ) for the process @xmath153 at @xmath6  gev with the initial electron unpolarized .",
    "several values of @xmath18 and @xmath19 are included to demonstrate the sensitivity of the distributions to anomalous couplings .",
    "the figure shows the dominance of the transverse @xmath3 polarization at forward angles and the increasing importance of the @xmath3 longitudinal polarization at @xmath154 .",
    "note also the relative lack of sensitivity to anomalous couplings for the forward , dominantly transverse @xmath3 s and how the sensitivity increases as the scattering angle increases and longitudinal @xmath3 s contribute a larger fraction of the cross section .",
    "we have shown the @xmath155 distribution as it displays the most dramatic change in the shape of the distributions .",
    "however , interference between the transverse and longitudinal @xmath3 s also depends on the azimuthal angle so that the azimuthal angular distribution also shows changes in its shape , albeit smaller .",
    "one finds similar effects in the angular distributions for the decay @xmath156 .",
    "the approach which makes the most complete use of information in an event is the maximum likelihood method .",
    "based on the observations of the previous section we perform a maximum likelihood fit based on the 5 angles@xcite ; @xmath157 , the @xmath46 scattering angle with respect to the initial @xmath158 direction , @xmath159 , the polar decay angle of the @xmath146 in the @xmath46 rest frame using the @xmath46 direction as the quantization axis , @xmath160 , the azimuthal decay angle of the @xmath146 in the @xmath46 rest frame , and @xmath161 and @xmath162 are the analogous angles for the lepton in the @xmath45 rest frame .",
    "the azimuthal angles are defined as the angle between the normal to the reaction plane , @xmath163 and the plane defined by the @xmath3 decay products , @xmath164 .",
    "the angles are shown in fig .",
    "8 . for the @xmath126 case",
    "there is an ambiguity since we can not tell which hadronic jet corresponds to the quark and which to the antiquark .",
    "we therefore include both possibilities in our analysis .    to implement the maximum likelihood analysis we divided each of @xmath157 , @xmath159 , @xmath160 , @xmath161 , and @xmath162 into four bins so that the entire phase space was divided into @xmath165 bins .",
    "with this many bins some will not be very populated with events so that it is more appropriate to use poisson statistics rather than gaussian statistics .",
    "this leads naturally to the maximum likelihood method .",
    "the change in the log of the likelihood function is given by @xmath166\\ ] ] where the sum extends over all the bins and @xmath167 and @xmath168 are the predicted number of non - standard model and standard model events in bin @xmath169 respectively , given by @xmath170 where @xmath171 is the expected integrated luminosity .",
    "the 68% and 95% confidence level bounds are given by the values of anomalous couplings which give a change in @xmath172 of 0.5 and 2.0 respectively .",
    "ideally , one would perform the analysis on an event by event basis but to simplify our calculations we used a five dimensional angular distribution . to check the sensitivity to binning we varied the number of dimensions and bins used in our fits . for this binning approach we found that the results converged to the tightest bounds using the five dimensional distribution and 4 bins per dimension . in",
    "a few test runs for special cases of kinematic cuts we calculated the likelihood function on an event by event basis and found that the sensitivities improved a small amount over the 5 dimensional distribution case described above .",
    "the results we obtained are based solely on the statistical errors based on the integrated lumininosity we assume for the various cases . to include the effects of systematic errors using the maximum likelihood approach",
    "requires an unweighted monte carlo simulation through a realistic detector . since we did not have the facilities to do this we attempted a simplified estimate of systematic errors using @xmath130 analysis to make our estimates .",
    "we assumed a systematic error of 5% of a measurement which we combined in quadrature with the statistical error .",
    "in general the systematic errors are negligible compared to the statistical errors .",
    "the only times they made a measurable difference was for the high luminosity cases of the 500  gev and 1  tev nlc , and even there the effect was quite small .",
    "it is straightforward to see why this is so ; with so many bins the number of events per bin is quite small resulting in a large statistical error .",
    "thus , it appears that the total errors will be dominated by the statistical errors but clearly , a full detector monte carlo must be performed to properly understand the situation .",
    "a thorough analysis of gauge boson couplings would allow all five parameters in the lagrangian to vary simultaneously to take into account cancellations ( and correlations ) among the various contributions .",
    "this approach is impractical , however , due to the large amount of computer time that would be required to search the parameter space .",
    "instead we show 2-dimensional contours for a selection of parameter pairs to give a sense of the correlations . for the case of the chiral lagrangian where the global su(2 ) symmetry imposes relations between the parameters and where we restrict ourselves to dimension four operators the parameter space reduces to 2 dimensions .      for the lep200 collider we study the sensitivity to the gauge boson couplings using the expected machine parameters of @xmath4  gev and an integrated luminosity of 500  pb@xmath14 .",
    "these results do not have a cut on @xmath117 or @xmath118 since for these energies the cuts have virtually no effect on the sensitivities except for the electron mode involving the @xmath1 vertex where the effect is still quite small .",
    "the 95% confidence limits for the @xmath173 , @xmath174 , @xmath175 , and @xmath176 planes are shown in fig .",
    "9 and for the @xmath177 plane is shown in fig .",
    "the sensitivities of the couplings , varying one parameter at a time , are summarized in table ii . in each of these figures ,",
    "contours are shown for the muon mode alone and then for the combined results of the @xmath178 and @xmath179 modes with both charge possibilities .",
    "we also show contours for a reduced integrated luminosity of 300  fb@xmath14 . for the @xmath180 vs @xmath181 plot",
    "we show contours for both the electron and muon modes since there is a visible difference for the two modes . by combining the four lepton modes",
    "the couplings can be measured to @xmath182 , @xmath183 , @xmath184 , @xmath185 , @xmath186 , @xmath187 , and @xmath188 .",
    "if the results of the four lep experiments could be combined these results could be reduced further . nevertheless , these limits are at the very least an order of magnitude less sensitive than would be required to see the effects of new physics through radiative corrections and are comparable to the sensitivities that could be achieved at a high luminosity tevatron upgrade .",
    "it is therefore unlikely , that new physics will reveal itself at lep200 through precision measurements of the tgv s .      for the @xmath6  gev nlc option",
    "we assume an integrated luminosity of 50  fb@xmath14 . at 500  gev",
    "the results are most sensitive when we impose that the @xmath3 s are on mass - shell ; ie .",
    "gev and @xmath190  gev .",
    "this is slightly more pronounced for the electron mode .",
    "after these cuts are imposed the electron and muon modes are essentially identical .",
    "the 95% confidence limits for the @xmath173 , @xmath174 , @xmath175 , and @xmath176 planes are shown in fig .",

    "we find that @xmath10 , @xmath9 , @xmath13 and @xmath12 can be measured to better than @xmath16 and @xmath192 to roughly @xmath193 at 95 % c.l .",
    "including the invariant mass cut and assuming 50  fb@xmath14 integrated luminosity .",
    "if the integrated luminosity were reduced to 10  fb@xmath14 the bounds become weaker by roughly a factor of two while combining all four modes improves the single mode bounds by roughly a factor of two . these measurements of @xmath192 , @xmath10 , and",
    "@xmath9 should be precise enough to probe loop radiative corrections to the couplings .",
    "on the other hand the measurements of @xmath13 and @xmath12 are still an order of magnitude too large to see expected deviations from tree level values due to radiative corrections .",
    "the @xmath177 contours are shown in fig .",
    "@xmath180 can be measured to @xmath194 and @xmath181 to @xmath195 using a single mode and to @xmath196 and @xmath197 respectively combining all four @xmath198 final states .",

    "sensitivity contours for the @xmath173 and @xmath174 are shown in fig . 13 .",
    "these results were obtained by imposing that the @xmath3 s be on mass shell ; @xmath189  gev and @xmath190  gev .",
    "we do not bother showing the @xmath200 contours since they are uncorrelated ( one parameter is least sensitive when the other is taken to be equal to zero ) so it is sufficient to give the sensitivity when all other parameters are set to zero .",
    "the @xmath177 contours are shown in fig 14 . with these collider parameters",
    "@xmath201 can be measured to about @xmath16 while @xmath9 and @xmath10 can be measured to about @xmath74 .",
    "these measurements will be sensitive enough to test the standard model at the level of radiative corrections .      in the earlier discussion of angular distributions we pointed out that reactions with different initial electron polarizations have different dependences on anomalous couplings @xcite . in this section",
    "we explore the consequences of this behavior .",
    "we restrict our results to the dimension 4 operators where deviations are most likely to show up .",
    "for the 500  gev @xmath5 collider we took 25  fb@xmath14 of integrated luminosity per polarization .",
    "we only include results for the four combined lepton modes .",
    "the 95% c.l .",

    "are contours for @xmath203 , @xmath204 , and unpolarized initial states . for the @xmath205 plane",
    "there is not much difference in the shape of the contour for the different polarizations although the bounds improve slightly . on the other hand",
    "the different polarizations give much different dependences for the @xmath174 and @xmath177 contours . in the @xmath174 plane",
    "the right - handed electron polarizations give constraints orthogonal to the left - handed polarizations and unpolarized results .",
    "the unpolarized contours are aligned along the @xmath206 contours which is not too surprising considering that @xmath207 dominates the right - handed contribution in the unpolarized cross - section . for the @xmath177 plane",
    "the left and right handed polarizations also give different dependences which would further constrain @xmath180 .",
    "for the 1  tev @xmath5 collider we took 100  fb@xmath14 of integrated luminosity per polarization .",
    "the sensitivities are shown in fig . 16 .",
    "they are similar to , but more constraining , than the 500  gev case so we do not comment further .",
    "more important than the improvement in sensitivity is the usefulness of polarization for disentangling the nature of anomalous tgv s if deviations are observed .      in this section",
    "we explore the information potential available from @xmath208 final states off the @xmath3 resonance . referring to the invariant mass distributions shown in fig . 4",
    "one sees that there is considerable sensitivity to anomalous gauge boson couplings when the fermion pairs do not originate from real @xmath3 production .",
    "we do not perform a rigorous analysis here but demonstrate that there is considerable information in the non - resonant production .",
    "in particular we do not consider possible backgrounds to non - resonant events and do not make any effort to optimize our cuts to enhance deviations from sm results .",
    "we consider @xmath132  gev , 500  gev , and 1  tev for both the @xmath209 and @xmath210 final states and include initial state polarization when appropriate .",
    "we based our results on the total cross - section upon imposing the cuts @xmath211  gev and @xmath212  gev where @xmath213 is the invariant mass of the final state fermion pairs and @xmath214 stands for either @xmath215 or @xmath126 .",
    "these give rise to a large number of possibilities so we only present the `` best '' case when the four possible final states are combined for each energy .      for @xmath132",
    "gev we only considered unpolarized initial state electrons and positrons .",
    "the results here should be taken with a grain of salt due to the low number of events expected in these kinematic regions .",
    "for example , the standard model predicts , for an integrated luminosity of 500  fb@xmath14 and combining all 4 final states , only 40 events when either @xmath216  gev or @xmath217  gev . with this warning ,",
    "the optimum results occur for @xmath216  gev and are given in table iii .",
    "the results are slightly weaker for the case @xmath218  gev .",
    "although for a specific case , sensitivities may differ between the @xmath179 and @xmath178 final states , they are generally quite similar . the case @xmath212  gev is not nearly as sensitive to anomalous couplings except for @xmath181 and @xmath10 . these results , along with the previous ones which concentrated on the real @xmath3 production , indicate that the results are dominated by real @xmath3 production .",
    "the off - resonance results are roughly a factor of two to three weaker than those given previously for real @xmath3 production and are not likely to contribute much to bounds on tgv s at lep200 .      for @xmath6  gev and combining the four final states , the sensitivity is greatest when @xmath217  gev except for a few cases .",
    "the results for @xmath118 cuts are slightly less sensitive .",
    "considering either the @xmath51 or @xmath52 final states separately we find that for the @xmath51 final states the @xmath217  gev case is more sensitive than the @xmath219  gev case while for the @xmath52 final states they are comparable . with @xmath217  gev the @xmath51 final states are more sensitive to couplings involving photons than the @xmath52 final states . in both cases",
    "when we take @xmath217  gev the cross - section is dominated by the @xmath126 pair originating from an on - shell @xmath3 .",
    "this gives us the case of single-@xmath3 production which receives large contributions from t - channel photon exchange and hence it is more sensitive to the @xmath1 coupling .",
    "the nlc offers the possibility of initial electron polarization .",
    "we have included some representative results .",
    "an important difference between the two polarizations , which can be seen in fig .",
    "4 , is that the cross - section with left handed electrons is about an order of magnitude larger than for right handed electrons . at the same time",
    "the right - handed cross - section is significantly more sensitive to anomalous couplings than the left - handed cross - section .",
    "there is therefore a tradeoff between sensitivity and statistics so that in some cases the bounds obtainable for the two polarizations are comparable . the unpolarized results offer no improvement over the polarized results since the right - handed cross - section is overwhelmed by the left - handed contribution .",
    "one exception to these comments is when we consider @xmath180 where the left - handed electrons are more constraining for @xmath180 .",
    "the results at 1  tev are qualitatively similar to those at 500  gev so we do not repeat the discussion of the previous section but only point out the few points that differ . again , the highest sensitivity is for the constraint @xmath217  gev . the achievable bounds for this case are included in table iii .",
    "they are typically 4 to 5 times more constraining than those obtainable at 500  gev ; less than 1% for @xmath10 and @xmath9 which is at the level of loop contributions from new physics .",
    "one interesting difference is that the muon mode for right - handed initial electrons provides the most stringent constraints for many of the tgv couplings .",
    "as before , the electron final state offers the best measurements of @xmath10 .      from the above results it is clear that , although the constraints that could be obtained from off - resonance production are not as tight as those obtained from on - shell @xmath3 production , there is nevertheless considerable information contained in these events",
    "it appears to us that the method that makes optimal use of each event is to calculate the probability of each event , irrespective of where it appears in phase space , and compute a likelihood function for the combined probabilities .",
    "the only experimental cuts that should be included are those that represent detector acceptance and that are introduced to eliminate backgrounds .",
    "we performed a detailed analysis of the measurement of tri - linear gauge boson couplings in the process @xmath220 .",
    "we included all tree level contributions to this final state and included finite gauge boson width effects .",
    "the off - shell @xmath3 contributions contribute from 20% for the @xmath179 mode at lep200 to 30% and 100% for the electron mode at a 500  gev and 1  tev nlc respectively ( with the kinematic cuts we used ) .",
    "clearly , the non - resonant contributions must be included to properly account for the experimental situation .    to gauge the sensitivity of this process to anomalous gauge boson couplings we used the @xmath3 decay distributions as a polarimeter to distinguish the longitudinal @xmath3 modes , which are more sensitive to anomalous coupings , from the transverse modes .",
    "we implemented this through the use of a quintic differential cross section , with each angular variable divided into 4 bins , and then calculating the likelihood function of non - standard model couplings as compared to the standard model . using this approach we found that at lep200 operating at 175  gev and assuming integrated luminosity of 500  pb@xmath14 , @xmath7 @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 could be measured to roughly @xmath8 and @xmath180 and @xmath181 to @xmath221 and @xmath222 respectively .",
    "it is extremely unlikely that measurements of this precision would reveal anomalous couplings . at a 500  gev nlc with an integrated luminosity of 50  fb@xmath14 , @xmath7 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 ,",
    "could be measured to roughly @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath223 respectively and @xmath180 and @xmath181 to @xmath224 and @xmath197 respectively . at the 1  tev nlc with 200  fb@xmath14",
    "the corresponding numbers are @xmath225 , @xmath226 , @xmath227 and @xmath228 .",
    "the 500  gev nlc measurements are sensitive enough that they should be sensitive to loop contributions to the tgv s while the 1  tev will be able to measure such effects .",
    "we studied the sensitivity of the off - mass shell cross sections to anomalous couplings by imposing kinematic cuts on the invariant mass distributions of the outgoing fermion pairs .",
    "a cursory analysis found that the off - resonance cross section is relatively sensitive to anomalous couplings and that useful information could be extracted from this region of phase space .",
    "although the inclusion of @xmath3 decays to fermions and the non - resonant diagrams does not alter the precision to which the tgv s can be measured they do change the cross sections and kinematic distributions at the same level as radiative corrections and must be taken into account for an accurate comparison between experiment and theory .    the optimal strategy to maximize the information contained in each event is to construct a likelihood function based on the four vector of each of the outgoing fermions on an event by event basis , putting them through a realistic detector simulation .",
    "this would make the best use of the information whether it be on the @xmath3 resonance or not .",
    "kinematic cuts should only be introduced to reduce backgrounds .",
    "since the precision of these measurements is beyond the level of loop induced radiative corrections it is crucial that radiative corrections are well understood and included in event generators used in the study of these processes .",
    "progress is being made along these lines as exemplified by the monte carlo event generators ; excalibur @xcite , whopper , @xcite eeww @xcite , wwf @xcite , and wwgenp @xcite .",
    "the authors benefited greatly from many helpful conversations , communications , and suggestions during the course of this work with tim barklow , genevieve blanger , pat kalyniak , dean karlen , and paul madsen .",
