    "dilute gas bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) display not only interesting classical nonlinear field physics , but also quantum field physics , such as the mott insulator transition @xcite .",
    "these becs are especially interesting because the weak atomic interactions make the physics sufficiently simple that we expect to get quantitative agreement between experiments and theory . in this paper",
    "we analyse one of the more straightforward aspects of the jila bosenova experiment @xcite : the time to collapse .",
    "it has previously been shown that the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) theory substantially overestimates these collapse times @xcite .",
    "we show that adding the lowest order quantum field corrections does not improve the situation .",
    "thus an open question remains : what explains the discrepancy between theory and experiment ?",
    "the collapse experiments at jila @xcite represent the first completely controlled studies of unstable becs .",
    "earlier experiments on unstable @xmath1li condensates @xcite could not provide such a well defined initial state for the collapse since the condensate was continuously fed by a thermal cloud and collapse was therefore triggered in a random fashion .",
    "nonetheless these were the first experiments to verify theoretical predictions about the critical atom number in attractive becs . in the experiment described in ref .",
    "@xcite , a stable @xmath0rb condensate was prepared with vanishing interactions , and then the scattering length was switched to a negative ( attractive ) value using a feshbach resonance .",
    "the experiment demonstrated a number of complicated and interesting features of the condensate collapse , which was controlled via the use of a feshbach resonance .",
    "we have extended existing theoretical studies @xcite by applying the dynamical hartree - fock bogoliubov ( hfb ) equations with realistic experimental parameters .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in the first part we will give an overview of the jila experiment and the associated theoretical literature .",
    "we then introduce our quantum field models , and finally present the results of our simulations .",
    "the collapsing condensate was observed to lose atoms until the atom number reduced to about the critical value below which a stable condensate can exist @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the number of remaining atoms on time since initiation of the collapse @xmath2 was measured for the case of an initial state with @xmath3 atoms and repulsive interaction corresponding to @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the hydrogen bohr radius .",
    "the onset of number loss is quite sudden , with milliseconds of very little loss followed by a rapid decay of condensate population ( within  0.5 ms ) after which the condensate stabilizes again .",
    "this behavior results from the scaling of the loss rate with the cube of the density , the peak value of which rises as @xmath6 near the collapse point @xcite .",
    "this allows a precise definition of the collapse time @xmath7 , the time after initiation of the collapse up to which only negligible numbers of atoms are lost from the condensate .",
    "another quantitative result of the experiment is the dependence of @xmath7 on the magnitude of the attractive interaction that causes the collapse , parametrised by the ( negative ) scattering length @xmath8 .",
    "these measurements are performed from an initial state with @xmath9 atoms in an ideal gas state ( with interaction between them tuned to zero ) .",
    "the @xmath7 datapoints presented in the original paper have undergone one revision of their @xmath8 values by a factor of 1.166(8 ) due to a more precisely determined background scattering length @xcite .",
    "although the main focus of this paper shall be on the collapse time , we mention two other striking features of the experiment : the appearance of bursts and jets. one fraction of the atoms that are lost during the collapse is expelled from the condensate at quite high energies ( @xmath10100 nk to @xmath10400  nk , while the condensate temperature is 3 nk ) ; this phenomenon was referred to as bursts. finally , when the collapse was interrupted during the period of number loss by a sudden jump in the scattering length , another atom ejection mechanism was observed : jets of atoms emerge , almost purely in the radial direction and with temperatures a lot lower than that of the bursts ( a few nk ) .",
    "in addition to the two initial scenarios described above there have been unpublished measurements on a third initial state with @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xcite . to simplify reference to the three different initial states for the collapse , we label them as in tab .",
    "[ inistateslist ] .    0.5 cm     case ( i ) & @xmath13 & @xmath14 + case ( ii ) & @xmath15 & @xmath16 + case ( iii ) & @xmath17 & @xmath18 +        the unstable attractive bec and its loss of atoms during collapse can be modeled numerically with the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) if a phenomenological three body loss term is included .",
    "numerical solutions to this equation for exact experimental parameters and geometry have been reported by adhikari @xcite , saito and ueda @xcite , santos and shlyapnikov @xcite , savage , robins and hope @xcite as well as bao , jaksch and markovich @xcite . where they consider the initial situation of case ( ii ) , these solutions agree on collapse times which qualitatively describe the experiment but systematically exceed the experimental values .",
    "note that while the remnant atom number after collapse depends strongly on the three - body recombination rate @xmath19 , which is not well determined near the feshbach resonance , and for which different values were employed in the references above , the collapse time in case ( ii ) does not vary much for experimentally reasonable values of @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "[ fig : collapsetime ] shows a comparison between gp theory ( @xmath20 ) and the revised experimental data ( @xmath21 ) for case ( ii ) .",
    "also shown are the gp results for spherical symmetry , for comparison with our quantum field theory calculations . the change in @xmath8 by a factor of 1.166(8 ) due to the revision",
    "has been included and moved the experimental and theoretical points closer together but they still do not agree .    in @xcite",
    "this situation is accepted as agreement between theory and experiment .",
    "but if the gp equation indeed contains all the essential physics to describe @xmath7 , one should expect better agreement since all crucial parameters of the model are experimentally fixed .",
    "in addition there exists another case where the gpe can apparently not account for @xmath7 accurately , and that is the above mentioned case ( iii ) @xcite .",
    "one reason for the controversy in the literature might be the fact that the gpe describes collapse times and remnant numbers well for case ( i ) @xcite . the condensates for cases ( i ) and",
    "( ii ) are similar in peak density , ruling out a simple qualitative difference of the densities involved as an explanation for this distinct behaviour .",
    "complementary to the numerical approach to the problem , one can attempt to find an analytic approximation that describes the essential features of the bec collapse",
    "@xcite employ a variational approach assuming a gaussian condensate shape . for values @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the critical scattering length above which the bec does not collapse , they obtain @xmath24 , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "but this parameter regime does not apply to the experiment , and it turns out that the scaling law becomes modified to @xmath25 for scattering lengths away from the critical value @xcite .",
    "@xcite derive a scaling law for the collapse time from the growth of unstable perturbations of the atom field .",
    "their result agrees with the one cited above , which seems to capture the shape of the function correctly .",
    "however both methods are unable to account for the proportionality constant , as both groups fit this parameter or the initial state to obtain agreement with experimental data .    in summary",
    ", mean field theory can describe the shape of the dependence of @xmath7 on @xmath8 correctly , but for case ( ii ) the real collapse seems significantly accelerated compared to these predictions .",
    "naturally , one would suspect deviations from gp theory to be the cause of this phenomenon @xcite .",
    "yurovsky @xcite investigates quantum effects in homogeneous becs with attractive interaction analytically , using an approximate solution to the operator equation for the condensate fluctuations .",
    "results from @xcite regarding the growth of an initially seeded unstable momentum - mode have been experimentally verified @xcite .",
    "yurovsky also derives an expression for the time evolution of condensate depletion .",
    "another prominent feature of the jila experiment was the appearance of radial atomic jets when the collapse was suddenly interrupted .",
    "numerical simulations were able to reproduce them using the gpe @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon can be explained as interference of atom emission from highly localized density spikes that are formed during collapse @xcite .",
    "the simulations seem to reproduce jet - shapes , anisotropy and dependence on @xmath26 ( fig . 5 of @xcite ) .",
    "by contrast calzetta _",
    "@xcite present a mechanism for jet production that is essentially a quantum effect .",
    "their model reproduces the features of the experimental data for atom numbers in jets ( fig .",
    "6 of @xcite ) for the range of validity of the approximations involved . regarding this ,",
    "the numerical simulations in @xcite yield a similar ( partial ) agreement with experiment , but do not agree with each other .",
    "another feature of the jets in the collapse experiment is the existence of large fluctuations in the atom number in jets .",
    "_ @xcite attribute this to a large number uncertainty in squeezed quantum states , while bao _",
    "_ @xcite reproduce these fluctuations by slight variations in the position of the initial state condensate wavefunction .",
    "the existence of jets can thus be predicted by gp theory alone , but it is not yet clear what role quantum effects play .      finally , one has to explain the bursts .",
    "these are atoms that remain in a detectable , trapped state during collapse but are found performing large amplitude oscillations in the trap .",
    "numerical solutions of the gpe generally show atoms being ejected from the condensate at the time of collapse . in order to be candidates for the burst atoms in the jila experiment",
    ", they need to have rather high energies @xmath10 100 nk ( compare fig .",
    "4 of @xcite ) .",
    "the ejected atoms within the condensate gain their energy due to a loss in ( negative ) mean field energy by three body recombination , which is sensitive to the three body loss rate @xmath19 .",
    "since @xmath19 is experimentally not very well constrained in the parameter regime in question @xcite , it is possible to reproduce the atom burst by matching @xmath19 on the energy spectrum @xcite .",
    "but in ref .",
    "@xcite it is shown , that even if @xmath19 is fitted to the energy spectrum for _ each _ value of @xmath8 , one can not obtain simultaneous agreement for cases ( i ) and ( ii ) described in ref .",
    "furthermore , the remnant atom number after collapse @xmath27 also depends on @xmath28 and the values for @xmath28 that are necessary to obtain high energy bursts in agreement with the experiment yield @xmath27 that disagree with the experiment .",
    "_ @xcite also suggest a quantum treatment of the bursts but do not put forward any quantitative predictions .",
    "milstein , menotti and holland @xcite present a model calculation that shows that atom - molecule coupling can yield sufficiently energetic atoms , however they do not examine the experimental parameter regime . in this paper , we will follow the formalism developed by milstein _",
    "_ but place a lower emphasis on the molecular field .    an alternate model that describes physics beyond the gpe has been proposed by duine and stoof @xcite and applied to the collapse case ( iii ) .",
    "they suggest elastic collisions between condensate atoms as the origin of the burst , and an additional channel by which the condensate can eject atoms .",
    "one of the collision partners gets ejected into the noncondensate in the process , while the other one is stimulated back into the condensate .",
    "the model yields results that describe well the experimental data for the case ( iii ) collapse . but case ( ii ) can not be treated with a gaussian variational ansatz @xcite , and it is not clear how to incorporate these elastic collisions into a treatment that is focussed on the backreaction of uncondensed atoms on the condensate .",
    "we will comment further on the relation to our model in the last section . a numerical study that accurately reproduces the bursts _ and _ all other results of the experiment therefore",
    "does not yet exist .",
