    "the investigation of quantum correlations in mixed states is presently attracting strong attention @xcite . while in bipartite pure states",
    "such correlations can be identified with entanglement , it was recently recognized that separable ( non - entangled ) bipartite mixed states , defined as states which can be created by local operations and classical communication , and which are therefore convex mixtures of product states @xcite , may still exhibit useful quantum correlations , stemming from the non - commutativity of the different products .",
    "the mixed state based quantum algorithm introduced by knill and laflamme ( kl ) @xcite has shown that an exponential speed - up over classical algorithms can in fact be achieved without entanglement @xcite , in contrast with the case of pure states @xcite .",
    "this has turned the attention to alternative measures of quantum correlations for mixed states , such as the quantum discord @xcite , which are able to capture the quantumness of such mixed states , vanishing just for states diagonal in a product basis and coinciding with entanglement in the pure state limit .",
    "a finite discord between the control qubit and the remaining maximally mixed qubits was in fact found in the kl algorithm @xcite , renewing the interest on this measure @xcite .",
    "other measures with similar properties include the closely related one - way information deficit @xcite , the geometric discord @xcite , which allows an easier evaluation , and the generalized entropic measures of ref .",
    "@xcite , which include the previous ones as particular cases .",
    "various applications and operational interpretations of the quantum discord and related measures were recently provided @xcite .",
    "we remark that all these measures require a minimization over local measurements in one of the constituents ( which can be viewed as the determination of the least disturbing local measurement @xcite ) , which makes their evaluation difficult in systems with high dimensionality .",
    "spin chains provide an interesting scenario for studying these measures and their relation with criticality @xcite . in particular",
    ", the state of a spin pair in an entangled ground state ( gs ) is in general a mixed state , entailing that differences between the entanglement and the quantum discord of a spin pair will arise already at zero temperature @xcite .",
    "these differences become significant in the exact ground states of finite xy chains for transverse fields lower than the critical field @xmath2 @xcite , with the quantum discord reaching full range in this region .",
    "the aim of the present work is to analyze in detail the behavior of the quantum discord , the geometric discord and the one - way information deficit of spin pairs in chains with @xmath0-type first neighbor couplings in a transverse field , at both zero and finite temperature .",
    "such model is particularly interesting for both quantum information and condensed matter physics , exhibiting distinct features such as eigenstates with definite magnetization along the field axis and a special critical behavior @xcite .",
    "it is first shown that in contrast with entanglement @xcite , discord - type measures exhibit common features such as a non - zero value for all separations @xmath3 at all temperatures @xmath4 .",
    "exact asymptotic expressions for the decay with @xmath3 and @xmath5 will be provided , on the basis of the exact treatment based on the jordan - wigner fermionization @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , we will also show that important differences between the quantum discord on the one side , and the geometric discord and information deficit on the other side , do arise in the minimizing local spin measurement . while in the quantum discord the latter is always orthogonal to the transverse field ( even at strong fields",
    "if @xmath4 ) , in the geometric discord and information deficit it exhibits a perpendicular to parallel transition as the field increases , at a field lower than the @xmath6 critical field @xmath2 . such transition in the minimizing measurement is present at all temperatures and separations , and as will be shown , is a signature of the transition from a bell state to a separable aligned state of the dominant eigenstate of the reduced density matrix of the pair .",
    "this difference indicates a distinct response of the minimizing measurement in these quantities to the onset of quantum correlations .    in section",
    "ii we summarize the main features of the previous measures , including the equations that determine the stationary local measurements . the application to the spin @xmath1 @xmath0 chain is made in section iii , where we first discuss some general properties of these measures in this model and show that spin measurements parallel and perpendicular to the field are always stationary .",
    "we then consider in detail the thermodynamic limit and the finite case .",

    "these differences will have important consequences for the results of the next section , leading to a quite different response of the minimizing measurement to the onset of quantum correlations .",

    "the agreement is not exact for low @xmath5 , but they become again coincident for high temperatures @xmath26 @xmath3 , where deviations from the thermodynamic limit results become small .",
    "we have examined the behavior of discord - type measures of quantum correlations for the case of spin pairs in the cyclic xx chain .",
    "their behavior is substantially different from that of the pair entanglement , acquiring at @xmath6 non - zero values for all pair separations @xmath3 if @xmath356 and decaying only as @xmath255 for large @xmath3 .",
    "moreover , they remain non - zero for all temperatures , decaying as @xmath357 for sufficiently high @xmath5 .",
    "thus , they all exhibit the same `` universal '' asymptotics , independently of the particular choice of entropic function in @xmath133 .",
    "it can then be most easily accessed through the geometric discord , which offers the simplest evaluation .",
    "the ensuing picture is , consequently , quite different from that exhibited by the pair entanglement @xcite , which , although reaching full range in the immediate vicinity of @xmath2 , is appreciable just for the first few neighbors , as seen in fig.[f5 ] , and strictly vanishes beyond a low limit temperature .",
    "hence , critical systems like the xx chain seem to offer vast possibilities for discord - type quantum correlations between close or distant pairs .",
    "the second important result is that in spite of the similar behavior , these measures exhibit substantial differences in the minimizing local spin measurement that defines them .",
    "the quantum discord , which minimizes a conditional entropy , always prefers here measurements along a direction orthogonal to the transverse field , even if correlations are weak ( i.e. , large @xmath3 , high @xmath5 or strong fields @xmath10 if @xmath4 ) . the information deficit - type measures , which evaluate the minimum global information loss due to such measurement and include the geometric discord and the one - way information deficit , exhibit instead a transition in the optimum measurement , from perpendicular to parallel to the field as the latter increases , present for all pair separations and at all temperatures .",
    "such difference was previously observed in certain two - qubit and two - qutrit states @xcite .    in the present model such behavior",
    "is a signature of the transition exhibited by the dominant eigenstate of the reduced state of the pair , which changes from a maximally entangled state to a separable state in the immediate vicinity of the measurement transition .",
    "hence , the latter reveals an actual relevant change in the structure of the reduced state .",
    "moreover , for contiguous pairs and in the case of the geometric discord , both transitions occur _ exactly _ at the same field , at all temperatures . for general separations",
    "there is also exact agreement between both fields at high @xmath5 , for _ all measures @xmath133_. in the finite chain the @xmath6 measurement transition coincides of course with one of the ground state magnetization transitions @xmath317 .",
    "these results indicate that the `` least disturbing '' local measurement optimizing these quantities can be significantly different from that minimizing the quantum discord , even though they coincide exactly in some regimes , being essentially affected by the main component of the reduced state .",
    "its changes can then be used to characterize different quantum regimes , even when entanglement is absent .",
