    "the past five years brought remarkable improvements in both accuracy and stability of atomic clocks  @xcite .",
    "development of ultra - precise clocks is important for a wide range of applications , including design of absolute gravimeters and gravity gradiometers for geophysical monitoring and research , gravity aided navigation , improved timekeeping and synchronization capabilities , tests of fundamental physics such as einstein s theory of relativity , search for variation of fundamental constants through time , space , or coupling to gravitational fields , and exploration of strongly correlated quantum many - body systems  @xcite .",
    "performing fundamental tests with the atomic clocks and other precision atomic , molecular and optical ( amo ) technologies leads to ever increasing requirements for the understanding and control of the systematic errors .",
    "moreover , a number of novel fundamental physics amo experiments including searches for ultralight ( sub - ev ) axions , axion - like pseudoscalar and scalar dark matter  @xcite and topological defect dark matter  @xcite have been carried out or proposed , requiring improved understanding of systematic effects in amo systems .",
    "one of the major experimental and theoretical problems in improving the atomic clock accuracy is a precision determination of atomic clock frequency shift due to blackbody radiation ( bbr ) . in recent experimental works  @xcite with @xmath1sr optical lattice clocks ,",
    "the blackbody radiation was identified as the primary source of clock s uncertainties .",
    "a number of measurements and thorough analysis of all systematic effects led to reduction of the sr clock total uncertainty to the level of @xmath2 in fractional frequency units . however , 65% of the clock uncertainty budget was still due to the bbr shift @xcite .",
    "a number of other experiments with trapped ions and atoms are sensitive to the bbr effects , including recent tests of local lorentz invariance ( lli ) violation in the electron - photon sector with trapped ca@xmath0  @xcite ions .",
    "theories aimed at unifying gravity with quantum physics suggest that nature violates lorentz symmetry at the planck scale while suppressing its violation at experimentally achievable energy scales @xcite .",
    "the minimal o(1 ) suppression may lead to lorentz - violating effects appearing beyond @xmath3 sensitivity level , determined by the ratio of electroweak and planck scales .",
    "thus , high - precision experiments with atomic systems @xcite provide an important route to search for lorentz violation at low energies . the lli experiments with trapped ions may be particulary sensitive to anisotropic bbr shift since they are based on monitoring the energy difference between different zeeman substates as described below . in these experiments ,",
    "anisotropic bbr shift may become a limiting factor for the ultimate accuracy of the lorentz violation tests in the electron - photon sector @xcite and this work is strongly motivated by these fundamental studies .",
    "bbr effects may also become a source of decoherence in larger - scale quantum information experiments with trapped ions due to a change in the environmental temperature or temperature gradients during the computation .",
    "calculations of blackbody radiation shifts are usually done assuming that the bbr radiation is isotropic .",
    "a detailed consideration of the isotropic bbr effect in conventional electric dipole approximation was carried out in  @xcite .",
    "multipolar theory of isotropic bbr shift of atomic energy levels ( as well as its implications for optical lattice clocks ) was developed in  @xcite .",
    "however , in practice the source of bbr can be highly anisotropic and even may have a small angular size . as a result",
    ", a lot of experimental efforts is required to make the bbr field uniform and with a known temperature  @xcite .",
    "for this reason a proper calculation of the anisotropic bbr shift is necessary . also , this effect can be of interest by itself as a physical phenomenon .",
    "we note that the problem of anisotropic bbr effect , discussed in the present work , does not arise in experiments with alkaline - earth atoms aiming to create an atomic clock in the @xmath4 transition because the states with total angular momenta @xmath5 are involved .",
    "the isotropic bbr shift of an energy level is proportional to scalar static polarizability of this level @xcite . in the case of anisotropic blackbody radiation , an additional contribution that depends on",
    "the projection of a thermal photon wave vector @xmath6 to the @xmath7 axis arises .",
    "we show below that it is determined by the tensor polarizability of the level .",
    "this contribution is particularly important when we consider bbr frequency shift of a @xmath8 - @xmath9 transition , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the projections of the total angular momentum @xmath12 to the @xmath7 axis , and we assume @xmath13 and @xmath10 to be good quantum numbers for the atomic states .",
    "the scalar polarizabilities of the zeeman substates @xmath8 and @xmath9 are practically identical differing only due to a very small difference in the energy denominators . as a result , the isotropic bbr frequency shift is completely negligible in this case .",
    "in contrast , the anisotropic bbr shift of the energy level depends on @xmath14 and can be noticeably different for the different @xmath10 substates .",
    "the same issue arises for the hyperfine states with different @xmath15 .",
    "such a systematic effect arose in a recent record - high precision experiment aimed at the search for local lorentz invariance violation in the electron - photon sectors using a superposition of two ca@xmath0 ions @xcite . in the experiment ,",
    "the energy difference between the @xmath16 and 5/2 substates of the @xmath17 multiplet , monitored over 23 h served as a probe of lorentz - violating effects .",
    "the anisotropic bbr shift produces a differential shift between @xmath16 and 5/2 states mimicking the lorentz - violating effects .",
    "thus , anisotropic bbr is an important systematic effect .",
    "it was demonstrated in @xcite that a factor of @xmath18 higher sensitivity to lorentz violation may be achieved with a similar experimental scheme with yb@xmath0 by monitoring the ( @xmath19 ) @xmath20 frequency difference . since this experiment will probe lli at much higher sensitivity , study of anisotropic bbr is needed as it can be a major systematic effect for such an experiment .",
    "we note that singly ionized ytterbium @xmath21yb@xmath0 with ultranarrow optical @xmath22 - @xmath23 and @xmath22 - @xmath24 transitions is also being pursued for a realization of an optical atomic clock and search for the temporal variation of the fine - structure constant @xmath25 and the proton - to - electron mass ratio @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "the problem of anisotropic bbr shift of energy levels is practically unexplored so far , but may cause systematic effects in a variety of experiments . in this work",
    ", we derived a general formula for the bbr shift of an energy level produced by a point - like source . a generalization to a finite source",
    "is obtained by integration over angles of emitted thermal photons .",
    "the result is expressed in terms of the scalar and tensor polarizabilities of the atomic level .",
    "we also performed numeric calculation of the bbr frequency shifts for the ca@xmath0 @xmath27 - @xmath28 transition and yb@xmath0 @xmath29 - @xmath30 transitions due to their relevance to searches for lorentz violation .",
    "an interaction of an atom in the state @xmath31 with the electric field of a thermal photon emitted to a solid angle @xmath32 leads to a blackbody radiation shift of an energy level .",
    "after integration over photon frequency , the bbr shift of the energy level @xmath31 can be written as@xmath33here , we use a three - dimensional transverse gauge for photon polarization @xmath34 with polarization @xmath35 normalized to the unit . since photons are transverse , in this gauge @xmath36 .",
    "the elements of the symmetric tensor @xmath37 are defined as @xmath38where @xmath39 is the electric dipole moment operator and @xmath40 is the difference between energy levels of the intermediate and @xmath31 states .",
    "we use atomic units , i.e. , @xmath41 .",
    "an explicit form of the factor @xmath42 is not important for the following derivation and we will restore it later .    in the following we discuss only bbr effect caused by the electric field .",
