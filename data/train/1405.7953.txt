    "analyses of these results have shown that the galactic normal pulsar population is made up of 30,000@xmath151,100 sources beaming toward earth with luminosities above ; their radial density profile is best described by a gamma function and their distance from the galactic plane , by an exponential function with a scale height of @xcite .",
    "a more physically realistic treatment of pulsar luminosities involves using a log - normal luminosity function , which is demonstrated from pulsar population syntheses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the advantage of this approach is that it allows predictions of the _ total _ normal pulsar population size  not just the number above a certain luminosity cutoff ; @xcite predict that there are 120,000@xmath1520,000 detectable , normal pulsars in the galaxy .",
    "since there are only @xmath16 as many known msps as normal pulsars @xcite , we do not have the same level of knowledge about recycled pulsars population parameters . the high time resolution universe ( htru )",
    "survey @xcite has added more normal pulsar discoveries to the pmps haul and many msps as well ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "recent analysis of the intermediate latitude portion of htru msp detections by @xcite uses a scale factor method @xcite and 50 detected msps to place a lower limit of 30,000@xmath157,000 on the galactic msp population size ( considering sources whose luminosities exceed ) .",
    "the scale height of the msp population is fairly well established to be 500  pc @xcite , but the spatial , period and luminosity functions are currently less well understood .",
    "although many models can be ruled out , plausible msp populations with a variety of underlying distributions are consistent with the observed sample @xcite .    despite the fact that arecibo s latitude does not permit observations close to galactic center like those at parkes , the unique combination of arecibo s sensitivity , paired with the high spectral resolution of its back - ends , provides a much deeper view through the galaxy s dispersive medium , which often smears out signals from distant sources .",
    "although the pmps and htru surveys have sampled much of the sky surrounding the galactic center  an area of the sky with high pulsar density  and have discovered over 1,000 pulsars , palfa provides a glimpse of the population density at larger galactic radii ( @xmath17{kpc}$ ] ) , which will help improve the spatial features of future pulsar population models .",
    "arecibo s ability to reach competitive sensitivity limits with short integration times ( 15 minutes ) makes acceleration searches for binaries unnecessary for all but the most exotic systems . finally , arecibo s unrivaled sensitivity allows palfa to probe the low - luminosity end of the galactic pulsar population , leading to a better understanding of the underlying luminosity distribution .    with arecibo s unique capabilities ,",
    "palfa has great potential to discover many normal pulsars as well as msps , thus improving our statistical picture of each population s characteristics .",
    "given the number of discoveries by pmps , it has historically been used to refine pulsar population modeling assumptions for normal pulsars .",
    "recent efforts have been made to discover additional msps in archival pmps data @xcite with motivation to improve msp population models . with higher sensitivity to dispersed sources and msps , the palfa survey s influence on normal and millisecond pulsar population studies will complement those of the pmps and htru surveys .",
    "msps are essential for the direct detection of gravitational waves by pulsar timing array projects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the best way to increase our sensitivity to the stochastic background is to add new msps to the array @xcite .    in this paper , we present the detections and discoveries from the initial phase of the palfa survey , hereafter referred to as the `` precursor survey '' . in ",
    "[ sec : scnda ] , we describe the palfa precursor survey parameters and sky coverage and introduce two pipelines used to process the raw data .",
    "we present the 45 detections made by the precursor survey in  [ sec : surv ] and include an evaluation of the survey s efficacy based on measured and theoretically calculated signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratios . in  [ sec : overlap ] we discuss the portion of sky in the precursor survey that overlapped with the pmps and show preliminary evidence that palfa will indeed be probing more distant , fainter sources . comparing population simulations to precursor survey detection statistics , we generate probability density functions ( pdfs ) for normal and millisecond pulsar populations in  [ sec : pop ] .",
    "these pdfs inform the predictions we make about the total number of pulsars ( normal and msp ) we expect to have detected when the full palfa survey is complete .",
    "we conclude in  [ sec : rnd ] , stating the most probable normal and millisecond pulsar population sizes according to the precursor survey results .",
    "the palfa precursor survey covered portions of two galactic sectors  an inner galaxy region , @xmath18 , tiled with 865 pointings , and an outer galaxy region , @xmath19 , covered by 919 pointings . all pointings were within one degree of the galactic plane ( @xmath20 ) and had dwell times of 134 and 67 seconds for inner- and outer - galaxy regions respectively .",
    "the precursor survey used the arecibo l - band feed array ( alfa ) 7-beam receiver in conjunction with the wideband arecibo pulsar processor ( wapp ) back - end @xcite , which was set up to record 256 channels covering a bandwidth , centered at , every .",
    "each alfa pointing includes seven distinct beam positions in a hexagonal pattern .",
    "as palfa continues , the sky coverage will increase slightly in galactic longitude ( @xmath0 and @xmath21 ) and will extend to galactic latitude @xmath22 .",
    "for the remainder of the paper , we will refer to this extended spatial coverage ( accompanied by a three - fold increase in bandwidth ) as the _ full palfa survey_. the precursor survey , optimized for maximum efficiency and sensitivity , used a `` sparse sampling '' technique described in detail in @xcite ; gaps left by the precursor survey will be covered in multiple passes by the full palfa survey .",
    "pmps overlaps with the southernmost regions covered by arecibo in the palfa precursor survey , corresponding to @xmath5 . in ",
    "[ sec : surv ] , we will compare the performance of the two surveys in this overlap region to make a statement about the efficacy of the palfa precursor survey .",
    "data from the palfa precursor were previously analyzed in @xcite . that analysis used a quasi - real - time quicklook pulsar search pipeline in which the data were decimated in time and frequency by factors of 8 and 16 , respectively , yielding 32 spectral channels and 1024 @xmath23s time resolution . using the decimated data , 11 pulsars were discovered and 29 previously known pulsars were detected .",
    "timing and spectral characteristics from follow - up observations of the newly discovered pulsars are given in @xcite .",
    "we have analyzed these same data files at native full time- and frequency - resolution using the palfa survey s presto 1 pipeline .",
    "the full resolution search of the precursor survey data did not yield any pulsar discoveries ( and in fact missed some sources flagged by the quicklook pipeline ) , but revealed two more previously known normal pulsars ( j1946 + 2611 , b1924 + 16 ) and the bright msp  b1937 + 21 .",
    "the presto 1 zaplist , a list of frequencies and their harmonics related to known sources of rfi , may be responsible for this scant improvement over quicklook results since it was fairly restrictive , `` zapping '' @xmath24 of the spectral region between ( @xmath25 of known pulsars have spin frequencies in this range ) .",
    "at least one previously known source , b1925 + 188 , fell inside a zapped portion of the spectrum , but its fourth harmonic was still detectable in presto 1 results .",
    "four other sources that were detected by quicklook ( j1913 + 1000 , b1919 + 14 , j2002 + 30 and j2009 + 3326 ) were not detectable in presto 1 results . of the 12,488 palfa precursor beams ,",
    "183 ( @xmath26 ) were not processed by the presto 1 pipeline , including beams where j1913 + 1000 and b1919 + 14 should have been detected .",
    "psrs j2002 + 30 and j2009 + 3326 were processed by presto 1 and their spin frequencies were outside zapped portions of the spectrum ; why these two sources were not detectable remains unknown , although it is plausible that harmonics of their true spin frequencies could have been `` zapped , '' causing these sources to fall below a detectable threshold .    after the precursor survey was complete , raw data products",
    "were decimated to 4-bit resolution and saved in that form . in the process , some files were lost or corrupted ( i.e. detection data files for j1913 + 1000 , b1919 + 14 and b1924 + 16 ) , so results from @xcite were used when necessary .",
    "we used a complete list of precursor beam positions to determine minimum offset angles from each known source in the survey region , then refolded corresponding 4-bit data files , yielding two additional detections ( j1906 + 0649 and j1924 + 1631 ) .",
    "table [ tab : full ] outlines the means by which all sources in the palfa precursor survey were detected .      the palfa presto 1 pipeline used to analyze precursor survey data first converted wapp - format data to sigproc filterbank - format @xcite .",
    "each filterbank file , one per beam , was then processed independently using various programs from the presto suite of pulsar analysis software @xcite .",
    "strong narrow - band impulsive and periodic signals were identified as interference by rfifind .",
    "the filterbank files were then cleaned and reduced - frequency - resolution sub - band files were created at various dispersion measures ( dms ) .",
    "each group of sub - band files was then used to create time series with dms close to the dm of the sub - band file . in total 1056 trial dm values",
    "were used between @xmath27pc  @xmath28 .",
    "the upper limit was chosen to reflect the maximum expected dm in the sky region surveyed @xcite .",
    "each dedispersed time series was searched for single pulses using single_pulse_search.py .",
    "significant pulses ( @xmath29 ) with widths up to 0.1 s were identified and a diagnostic plot was generated for human inspection .",
    "the time series were also fourier transformed and searched for periodic signals using accelsearch .",
    "the periodicity search was done in two parts , one for unaccelerated pulsars using up to 16 summed harmonics and the other for accelerated pulsars using up to 8 summed harmonics .",
    "the high - acceleration search used a fourier - domain algorithm @xcite with a maximum drift of 50 fft bins .",
    "non - pulsar - like signals were removed from the candidate lists generated from the low and high - acceleration searches .",
    "the manicured low and high - acceleration candidate lists were then combined .",
    "candidates harmonically related to a stronger candidate were discarded , while the top 50 candidates with @xmath29 were `` folded '' modulo the best fourier - detected period using prepfold , which effectively provides a fully - coherent harmonic sum of the signal power .",
    "the resulting plots , along with basic metadata about the observations were loaded into a database hosted at cornell university , where volunteers selected and inspected candidate plots .",
    "for all sources detected by the quicklook and presto 1 processing pipelines , we refolded data files from beam positions nearest those sources using known pulsar parameters and calculated measured signal - to - noise @xmath30 values . for each pulse profile , we used a simple algorithm to determine on- and off - pulse bins , then summed on - pulse intensities and divided by the maximum profile intensity to get an equivalent top - hat pulse width @xmath31 ( in bins ) .",
    "finally , @xmath30 is computed with @xmath32 as in @xcite , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the mean and standard deviation of off - pulse intensities respectively , @xmath35 is the intensity of an individual profile bin and each profile had @xmath36 .",
    "we divided @xmath31 by the number of bins in a profile @xmath37 to convert to duty cycle @xmath38 for each detection .",
    "computed @xmath38 and @xmath30 values are listed in table [ tab : full ] .",
    "to measure the effectiveness of a pulsar survey , we look at the known sources that fall inside the survey region and compare the number of detections to the number of expected detections .",
    "effectiveness will then be evaluated by whether the survey meets / exceeds expectations for detecting individual sources .    lccccccccccc[ht ! ] j0540 + 3207 & 0.524 & 61 & 176.7 & 0.8 & 1.43 & 2.1 & 0.34 & 62.6 & 32.8 & ql , p1 , refold & yes + j0628 + 0909 & 1.241 & 88 & 202.2 & 0.9 & 2.30 & 1.4 & 0.06 & 4.6 & 21.0 & ql , p1 , refold & yes + j0631 + 1036 & 0.288 & 125 & 201.2 & 0.5 & 1.51 & 3.3 & 0.80 & 85.1 & 104.1 & ql , p1 , refold & + j1855 + 0307 & 0.845 & 402 & 36.2 & 0.5 & 3.24 & 1.7 & 0.97 & 12.4 & 48.4 & ql , p1 , refold & + j1901 + 0621 & 0.832 & 94 & 39.7 & 0.8 & 1.76 & 5.6 & 0.47 & 35.2 & 21.3 & ql , p1 , refold & yes + b1859 + 07 & 0.644 & 252 & 40.6 & 1.1 & 2.29 & 3.0 & 0.90 & 55.1 & 38.8 & ql , p1 , refold & + j1904 + 0738 & 0.209 & 278 & 41.2 & 0.7 & 0.90 & 1.9 & 0.23 & 54.2 & 20.1 & ql , p1 , refold & yes + j1904 + 0800 & 0.263 & 438 & 41.5 & 0.9 & 1.99 & 2.8 & 0.36 & 41.0 & 21.2 & ql , p1 , refold & + j1905 + 0616 & 0.990 & 256 & 40.1 & 0.2 & 1.80 & 1.5 & 0.51 & 69.7 & 47.4 & ql , p1 , refold & + b1903 + 07 & 0.648 & 245 & 40.9 & 0.1 & 0.52 & 5.6 & 1.80 & 266.2 & 171.3 & ql , p1 , refold & + & & & & & & & & & & & + j1905 + 0902 & 0.218 & 433 & 42.6 & 1.1 & 0.50 & 1.9 & 0.10 & 21.1 & 22.2 & ql , p1 , refold & yes + b1904 + 06 & 0.267 & 472 & 40.6 & 0.3 & 2.43 & 5.6 & 1.70 & 61.8 & 104.1 & ql , p1 , refold & + j1906 + 0649 & 1.287 & 249 & 40.7 & 0.2 & 2.53 & 6.3 & 0.30 & 9.2 & 20.2 & refold & + j1906 + 0746 & 0.144 & 217 & 41.6 & 0.1 & 2.60 & 1.6 & 0.55 & 28.8 & 15.0 & ql , p1 , refold & yes + j1906 + 0912 & 0.775 & 265 & 42.8 & 0.9 & 2.37 & 2.5 & 0.32 & 19.4 & 14.4 & ql , p1 , refold & + j1907 + 0740 & 0.575 & 332 & 41.6 & 0.1 & 2.24 & 2.2 & 0.41 & 30.5 & 25.3 & ql , p1 , refold & + j1907 + 0918 & 0.226 & 357 & 43.0 & 0.7 & 3.00 & 1.6 & 0.29 & 7.5 & 21.8 & ql , p1 , refold & + j1908 + 0734 & 0.212 & 11 & 41.6 & 0.3 & 1.05 & 3.1 & 0.54 & 90.1 & 23.1 & ql , p1 , refold & + j1908 + 0909 & 0.337 & 467 & 43.0 & 0.5 & 1.70 & 2.2 & 0.22 & 28.5 & 60.9 & ql , p1 , refold & + b1907 + 10 & 0.284 & 149 & 44.8 & 1.0 & 1.92 & 2.3 & 1.90 & 206.9 & 83.8 & ql , p1 , refold & + & & & & & & & & & & + j1910 + 0714 & 2.712 & 124 & 41.5 & 0.9 & 1.72 & 1.4 & 0.36 & 59.8 & 15.8 & ql , p1 , refold & + b1910 + 10 & 0.409 & 147 & 44.8 & 0.2 & 2.32 & 3.7 & 0.22 & 11.0 &  &  & + j1913 + 1000 & 0.837 & 422 & 44.3 & 0.2 & 1.69 & 3.8 & 0.53 & 66.5 & 26.0 & ql & + j1913 + 1011 & 0.036 & 178 & 44.5 & 0.2 & 2.69 & 4.1 & 0.50 & 14.1 & 19.9 & ql , p1 , refold & + j1913 + 1145 & 0.306 & 637 & 45.9 & 0.5 & 2.06 & 4.7 & 0.43 & 23.4 &  &  & + b1911 + 11 & 0.601 & 100 & 45.6 & 0.2 & 1.90 & 4.2 & 0.55 & 43.9 &  &  & + b1913 + 10 & 0.405 & 241 & 44.7 & 0.7 & 1.51 & 1.6 & 1.30 & 238.2 & 34.6 & ql , p1 , refold & + b1914 + 13 & 0.282 & 237 & 47.6 & 0.5 & 1.78 & 2.4 & 1.20 & 152.8 & 230.4 & ql , p1 , refold & + b1915 + 13 & 0.195 & 94 & 48.3 & 0.6 & 2.29 & 2.5 & 1.90 & 131.6 & 239.9 & ql , p1 , refold & + b1916 + 14 & 1.181 & 27 & 49.1 & 0.9 & 3.04 & 1.4 & 1.00 & 26.9 & 21.7 & ql , p1 , refold & + & & & & & & & & & & & + b1919 + 14 & 0.618 & 91 & 49.1 & 0.0 & 0.45 & 3.6 & 0.68 & 140.2 & 41.0 & ql & + b1921 + 17 & 0.547 & 143 & 51.7 & 1.0 & 3.01 & 3.6 &  &  & 46.8 & ql , p1 , refold & + j1924 + 1631 & 2.935 & 518 & 51.4 & 0.3 & 0.65 & 1.0 & 0.09 & 35.4 & 10.5 & refold & + b1924 + 16 & 0.580 & 176 & 51.9 & 0.1 & 0.83 & 2.5 & 1.30 & 363.5 & 90.9 & p1 & + b1925 + 188 & 0.298 & 99 & 53.8 & 0.9 & 1.92 & 5.9 &  &  & 27.8 & ql , p1 , refold & + j1928 + 1746 & 0.069 & 176 & 52.9 & 0.1 & 0.70 & 5.2 & 0.28 & 46.9 & 29.6 & ql , p1 , refold & yes + b1929 + 20 & 0.268 & 211 & 55.6 & 0.6 & 3.78 & 2.0 & 1.20 & 1.7 & 24.0 & ql , p1 , refold & + b1937 + 21 & 0.00156 & 71 & 57.5 & 0.3 & 2.41 & 14.9 & 13.20 & 327.0 & 180.5 & p1 , refold & + j1946 + 2611 & 0.435 & 165 & 62.3 & 0.6 & 2.61 & 2.4 &  &  & 18.5 & p1 , refold & + b1952 + 29 & 0.427 & 7 & 66 & 0.8 & 2.53 & 4.5 & 8.00 & 325.8 & 117.3 & ql , p1 , refold & + & & & & & & & & & & & + j1957 + 2831 & 0.308 & 138 & 65.5 & 0.2 & 1.57 & 3.6 & 1.00 & 131.2 & 30.0 & ql , p1 , refold & + j2002 + 30 & 0.422 & 196.0 & 67.9 & 0.2 & 1.21 & 3.7 &  &  & 60.7 & ql , refold & + b2000 + 32 & 0.697 & 142 & 69.3 & 0.9 & 2.16 & 1.8 & 1.20 & 121.7 & 49.1 & ql , p1 , refold & + b2002 + 31 & 2.111 & 234 & 69.0 & 0.0 & 3.30 & 1.3 & 1.80 & 26.3 & 94.4 & ql , p1 , refold & + j2009 + 3326 & 1.438 & 263 & 71.1 & 0.1 & 0.82 & 3.0 & 0.15 & 32.4 & 23.9 & ql , refold & yes + j2010 + 3230 & 1.442 & 371 & 70.4 & 0.5 & 0.60 & 2.2 & 0.12 & 32.6 & 23.4 & ql , p1 , refold & yes + j2011 + 3331 & 0.932 & 298 & 71.3 & 0.0 & 2.50 & 2.6 & 0.38 & 21.2 & 39.4 & ql , p1 , refold & yes + j2018 + 3431 & 0.388 & 222 & 73.0 & 0.8 & 1.70 & 2.0 & 0.24 & 47.4 & 31.7 & ql , p1 , refold & yes +      the palfa multibeam receiver is composed of seven beams , each with an average full width half maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath39 ; adjacent beams are separated by @xmath40 , or @xmath41 half - power beamwidths .",

    "a full list of pulsars detected by the precursor survey as well as those considered detectable due to their @xmath42 values can be found in table [ tab : full ] . before palfa began ,",
    "there were 84 known pulsars positioned inside the target precursor survey region , although this sky area was not covered uniformly ; 31 of 84 were deemed detectable , while 33 were actually detected , and seven had no previous flux measurements .",
    "of the 51 non - detections , most can be attributed simply to the sources not being close to a palfa precursor survey beam pointing , as the survey had only limited coverage in this region .",
    "figure [ fig : overlap ] shows the portion of the precursor survey that overlaps with the pmps ) , an example of this limited coverage .",
    "three of the 51 non - detections ( b1910 + 10 , j1913 + 1145 , and b1911 + 11 ) were unexpected , since @xmath69 for these sources ; one of the 33 detections ( b1929 + 20 ) was also unexpected , given its low @xmath42 value .",
    "the non - detections could be due to a variety of factors  most likely rfi .",
    "scintillation could have also suppressed the expected signal during precursor survey observations or boosted the signal during initial flux measurements .",
    "it is unlikely scintillation affected the detectability of j1913 + 1145 , however , because of this source s high dm ( ) . given the short integration time near each of these sources ( ) , the pulse - to - pulse variability may have strongly affected @xmath30 since relatively few pulses were recorded . also ,",
    "because of the large error bars on @xmath42 ( @xmath70 fractional error ) due to uncertainties in flux measurements , the sources may simply be weaker than expected .    although most sources with high @xmath42 values were detected by the precursor survey s processing pipelines ,",
    "five such sources were not .",
    "for each of these cases , we employed the same procedure as introduced in section [ sec : snmeas ] , using known periods and dispersion measures to dedisperse and fold the data from the closest pointing to each source .",
    "for the three sources mentioned earlier ( b1910 + 10 , b1911 + 11 , and j1913 + 1145 ) , no pulsations were detected ; for the other two , j1906 + 0649 and j1924 + 1631 , pulsations are evident , but relatively weak .",
    "psr j1906 + 0649 was likely missed because of the rfi environment at arecibo .",
    "in addition to the 33 re - detected pulsars in the region , psr j1924 + 1631 was discovered shortly after the precursor survey was completed , when the palfa survey underwent an upgrade to a new backend with three times more bandwidth .",
    "this source was then retroactively found in precursor survey data with @xmath30 just above the detection threshold and has therefore been included in analysis that follows .",
    "strong rfi present in the refolded precursor data explains why this source was not discovered earlier .",

    "we justify this criterion based on the fact that , due to patchy coverage , only @xmath7710% of the overlap region lies within an angular offset @xmath78 of a precursor beam center .",
    "we choose @xmath79 since this is the average angular offset @xmath80 for the precursor survey .",
    "half of all sources that fall within a radius @xmath81 of the nearest beam center will also be within the average angular offset @xmath82 .",
    "the pmps discovered or detected all 24 of the previously known pulsars in this region considered detectable by the palfa precursor survey .",
    "the precursor survey detected 21 of these , and discovered an additional four sources in this region .",
    "the pmps retroactively detected two of these four precursor discoveries in archival data ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "one of the three detectable known pulsars that the precursor survey missed , b1910 + 10 , had a @xmath42 value of @xmath83 ( see table [ tab : full ] ) , just above the detectability threshold of @xmath84 ; the other two , j1913 + 1145 and b1911 + 11 , were expected to be detected with @xmath85 and 36 respectively .",
    "error in @xmath42 is @xmath70 , which reflects the error in flux measurements and can easily explain the first non - detection .",
    "it is much harder to explain why j1913 + 1145 and b1911 + 11 were not detected , given their high @xmath42 values , but other systematics such as rfi and scintillation may explain these discrepancies .    ] pc  @xmath28 sources , while upper and lower limits of the shaded regions give minimum flux density sensitivity to pulsars with @xmath86 or respectively .",

    "precursor survey discoveries are superimposed as @xmath88_s _ , while expected detections b1910 + 10 , b1911 + 11 and j1913 + 1145 that were missed by the palfa precursor survey , but detected by pmps are shows with @xmath89_s_. ]    the four precursor survey discoveries  j1901 + 0621 , j1904 + 0738 , j1905 + 0902 and j1906 + 0746  have relatively high dispersion measures and were all detected near the signal - to - noise threshold with @xmath90 , so it is not surprising that they were not detected by previous surveys .",
    "psr j1906 + 0746 is a pulsar in a relativistic , orbit and was initially missed during manual inspection of pmps candidate plots due to rfi with a period similar to that of the pulsar @xcite .",

    "the other two discoveries , j1904 + 0738 and j1905 + 0902 , are much fainter  0.23 and respectively @xcite .",
    "these discoveries show preliminary evidence that with arecibo s high sensitivity , the palfa precursor survey probed a deeper and lower - luminosity pulsar population than previous surveys .",
    "however , the three unexpected non - detections suggest that the palfa precursor survey did not realize its full sensitivity and more work is required to better understand arecibo s rfi environment and develop mitigation techniques .",
    "the relative sensitivity limits as a function of period and dm for the pmps and precursor surveys are compared in figure [ fig : sens ] . to generate these curves",
    ", we used an average @xmath66 value for each survey region , assumed a constant pulse duty cycle of @xmath91 , and applied the empirical pulse broadening function from @xcite to account for multipath scattering in the interstellar medium .",
    "for the three objects that were detected at parkes , but not in the palfa precursor survey ( b1910 + 10 , j1913 + 1145 and b1911 + 11 ) , all have periods between 300 and , a regime where the pmps nominal sensitivity limit in figure [ fig : sens ] is about twice as high as the precursor survey s .",
    "however , the angular offsets to these sources ( @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 respectively for pmps and precursor values can be found in table [ tab : full ] ) imply that both surveys were equally sensitive to them since the palfa precursor beam ( fwhm@xmath39 ) is much narrower than that of the pmps ( fwhm@xmath95 ) and its sensitivity therefore drops off more quickly as a function of @xmath96 .",
    "taking angular offsets into account , b1910 + 10 ( @xmath97  mjy ) falls below the adjusted minimum sensitivity limit ( for both surveys ) , but b1911 + 11 and j1913 + 1145 do not ,",
    "so angular offsets alone do not explain why these sources went undetected .",
    "since other sources with lower flux densities and similar angular offsets _ were _ detected ( i.e. j0628 + 0909 , j1906 + 0649 , j1906 + 0912 , j1907 + 0740 , j1907 + 0918 , j2011 + 3331 ) , we conclude that transient effects such as rfi decreased the signal - to - noise ratios of b1910 + 10 , b1911 + 11 and j1913 + 1145 and possibly scintillation for the former two .",
    "the analysis presented here uses psrpoppy  a package that models the galactic population and evolution of pulsars . with this software",
    ", we populated a synthetic galaxy with pulsars whose attributes like cylindrical spatial coordinates , period , dm , luminosity , etc . were chosen from pre - determined pdfs @xcite .",
    "psrpoppy is a python implementation of psrpop , which was written in fortran @xcite ; it shares much of the same functionality , but the object - oriented nature of python and improved modularity of the code make it more readable and easier to write plug - ins for specific modeling purposes .",
    "further details on the psrpoppy software package are forthcoming @xcite .      in order to deduce the sizes of the underlying galactic normal and millisecond pulsar populations , we compared the results of psrpoppy simulations to the palfa precursor survey s detection statistics for each of these two classes of pulsar . in each case",
    ", we made a set of assumptions about the underlying population ( see table [ tab : popparams ] ) and drew spatial and intrinsic pulsar parameters from assumed distributions to form a synthetic galactic population .",
    "we simulated a survey of this synthetic population by computing @xmath42 as was discussed in ",
    "[ sec : surv ] .",
    "again , detections were then defined as sources with @xmath69 .",
    "the assumptions that went into our simulations , outlined in table [ tab : popparams ] , were largely drawn from the work by @xcite for the normal pulsar population . in that paper , however , the luminosity distribution for normal pulsars was assumed to behave as a power law with a low - luminosity cutoff of .",
    "since the palfa precursor survey s sensitivity dips below this cutoff value in some cases , we instead adopt a log - normal luminosity distribution , introduced by @xcite .",
    "since far fewer msps are known , we have very little information about the population s spatial and intrinsic parameter distributions , so some assumptions are simply adopted from the normal pulsar population ( luminosity and radial distributions ) , while others are grounded in some preliminary experimental results ( scale height , period and duty cycle distributions ) . in this case",
    ", we used a gaussian radial distribution with a standard deviation of and an exponential scale height larger than that of normal pulsars to reflect the fact that msps are distributed more uniformly across the sky .",
    "the gaussian radial model for msps in the galaxy is similar to that of normal pulsars , but makes no assumption about a deficiency of sources toward the galactic center , an effect observed from full _ normal _ pulsar population synthesis and modeled with a gamma function @xcite .",
    "we adopted the period distribution shown in figure [ fig : pdist ] from @xcite , where it was initially realized by adjusting the weights of various bins from a flat distribution ( in @xmath98 ) until preliminary simulations matched the sample of observed msps from pmps . unlike normal pulsar duty cycles , which show inverse proportionality to the square root of spin period ( i.e. shorter - period pulsars have wider pulses )",
    ", msps tend to exhibit relatively constant duty cycle across period , with larger scatter about some mean value than the normal pulsar population @xcite .",
    "therefore , our simulations assumed msp duty cycles to be independent of period .        to make the simulated detections as realistic as possible",
    ", we used precursor survey parameters in signal - to - noise ratio calculations , and modified psrpoppy to accept the survey s true pointing positions , as well as corresponding integration times and specific beam gain values . for each population class",
    ", we performed simulated precursor surveys across a range of trial population sizes ( 85,000130,000 for normal pulsars and 5,00050,000 for msps ) . for each trial , we performed 2,000 simulated realizations of independent galactic populations for msps and normal pulsars respectively . to form a likelihood function describing pulsar population size , we compared the results of these simulations to the true number of detections for each population class in the precursor survey .",
    "the precursor survey only detected a single msp ( b1937 + 21 ) , so the likelihood was computed by dividing the number of simulations that resulted in a single detection by the total number of simulations at that population size .",
    "of the 45 detections listed in table [ tab : full ] , we exclude b1937 + 21 ( msp ) from our normal pulsar analysis . although j1906 + 0746 is in a binary system , it is a young pulsar with a characteristic age of 112 kyr and has likely not undergone recycling from its companion , so we include it in our analysis .",
    "the likelihood function was formed by dividing the number of simulations that detected 44 pulsars by the total number of simulations at a given trial population size .",
    "we fit binomial distributions to simulated likelihood functions for normal and msp populations ( shown in figure [ fig : pdfs ] ) in order to smooth simulation results and provide integrable functions to determine confidence intervals . for an underlying population of size @xmath99 ,",
    "a given simulation has @xmath100 successes ( detections ) and @xmath101 failures ( non - detections ) ; these kinds of binary outcomes are nicely modeled by binomial distributions .",
    "the binomial distributions provide the functional form @xmath102 which describes the probability of drawing @xmath100 pulsars from a total population of @xmath99 given some detection probability @xmath64 . to select the @xmath64 value that produces posterior pdfs that best match the simulated data , we chose the one that minimized @xmath103 , computed by comparing simulated to expected population distributions . finally , the posterior population size pdfs are normalized so that they could be used to quote confidence intervals . with some number @xmath104 of successful realizations ( simulations in which the target number of detections is reached ) ,",
    "the poissonian error is given by @xmath105 .",
    "data points that reflect the probability of detecting exactly the target number of pulsars at a trial population size and their error bars are multiplied by the same constant required to normalize the best fit pdf . after looking at multiple realizations of the simulated data presented in figure [ fig : pdfs ] and comparing the standard deviation of data points at each population size to assumed poissonian error bar magnitudes",
    ", we determined that the poisson model accurately reflects the uncertainties in population sizes .    by integrating the pdfs shown in figure [ fig : pdfs ]",
    ", we find the mode and 95% confidence interval for the normal pulsar population size to be @xmath106 .",
    "we find a lower mode for the msp population size , @xmath107 and the high uncertainty in the corresponding 95% confidence interval reflects the fact that our prediction depends on a single msp detection in the precursor survey .",
    "these results describe the respective galactic pulsar populations that are beaming towards earth and errors on most likely population sizes account only for statistical uncertainties due to the limited number of detections in the palfa precursor survey , not for other sources ( e.g. uncertainties in scale height , luminosity distribution , electron density model , etc . ) .",
    "the confidence interval that the precursor survey places on the normal pulsar population is consistent with earlier results ; @xcite predict @xmath108 detectable normal pulsars , also using a log - normal distribution to model the pulsar luminosity function .",
    "the predicted msp population size is also consistent with previous estimates ; the upper limit we find easily encompasses the population size prediction made by @xcite , although the lower limit quoted in that paper , @xmath109 , is more constraining .",
    "neither of these 95% confidence intervals is tight enough to put strict constraints on normal or millisecond pulsar population sizes , but the consistency is encouraging and we expect the full palfa survey to place much more stringent constraints on these populations when complete .",
    "using input parameters from table [ tab : popparams ] to generate a synthetic , galactic normal pulsar population , we found that the palfa precursor survey should be expected to detect @xmath110 sources . through periodicity searches ,",
    "43 were found , which indicates that current population parameters , initially determined using pmps results , are already quite accurate and applicable to a variety of situations . as we mentioned in ",
    "[ sec : defdet ] , three sources that we expected to detect were not detected , but it is common for @xmath42 and @xmath30 values to not match perfectly .",
    "due to uncertainties in initial flux measurements , there can be as much as @xmath70 fractional error in @xmath42 . referring again to figure [ fig : snr ] ,",
    "we show a general trend towards a slope of unity when plotting theoretical versus measured s / n for the detections made by the precursor survey , but there is significant scatter in these comparisons",
    ". scatter like this can be caused by scintillation , rfi , poor prior flux measurements or some combination of all of these .",
    "the precursor survey discovered 11 pulsars , four of which fell inside the region overlapping pmps , allowing us to directly compare their respective sensitivities . while pmps detected almost three times as many sources in this region , this discrepancy was largely due to the differences in sky coverage  pmps covered this area uniformly , while the precursor survey had large blocks of coverage missing and slight gaps between pointings due to a `` sparse sampling '' technique .",
    "in fact , only @xmath111 of the overlap region was covered by the precursor survey to a sensitivity greater than or equal to that of pmps .",
    "even so , the palfa precursor survey discovered four pulsars that pmps missed ; two of these four were retroactively found by reanalyzing archival data but the others ( j1904 + 0738 and j1905 + 0902 ) have high dispersion measures and very low fluxes  an encouraging , albeit small , piece of evidence that arecibo s sensitivity gives palfa a glimpse at fainter and more distant pulsars .",
    "figure 3 in @xcite uses more recent palfa discoveries to show further evidence of palfa probing deeper than previous surveys as do recent discoveries mentioned in @xcite .",
    "we simulated a range of galactic pulsar populations  both non - recycled and recycled  of various sizes and used the palfa precursor survey s detection statistics to place limits on normal and millisecond pulsar population sizes respectively . by comparing experimental results to simulations , we formed pdfs for normal and msp population sizes , then integrated these pdfs to define confidence intervals .    assuming the most probable normal and millisecond population sizes according to the simulations described in  [ sec : genpdf ] are correct , we ran 1,000 trials with the same distribution parameter assumptions for each population to determine the most likely number of detections by the beginning of 2014 and after palfa is complete . averaging the results of these 1,000 trials in each case , we determine a predicted number of detections , then quote errors that are directly proportional to the 95% confidence limits from normal and millisecond pulsar population pdfs . following this procedure , we expect the full palfa survey to detect @xmath6 normal pulsars ( this includes previously known sources that are re - detected ) and @xmath7 msps .",
    "identical estimation techniques predict that @xmath8 normal pulsars and @xmath9 msps should have been detected by the beginning of 2014 , but at the time , palfa had detected 283 normal pulsars and 31 msps , respectivelypalfa / newpulsars for discoveries ; re - detected sources are as yet unpublished . ] .",
    "the discrepancy between observed and predicted detection rates is notable for the normal pulsar population . given the numbers quoted here , palfa has currently detected just over 50% of the expected number of normal pulsars , according to simulations .",
    "these simulations do not yet take into account the local rfi environment of the palfa survey , which certainly plays a role in the perceived dearth of pulsar detections as of early 2014 .",
    "two pulsars that went undetected by both quicklook and presto 1 pipelines in the precursor survey , j1906 + 0649 and j1924 + 1631 , provide evidence that initial processing techniques were not optimal and improvements are necessary . in repeated simulations of precursor detections in the inner galaxy region , we find @xmath112 of simulated , detectable sources had s / n values between 9 and 15 ( just above the detection threshold ) . in the precursor survey , only about 10% of detections had @xmath30 values in this regime . although the precursor survey discovered mostly low flux density sources , the fact that only a small fraction of detections were near the s / n threshold suggests that some sources were missed or assumptions that determine our sensitivity curves are not entirely correct .    a potential factor of two lower sensitivity to normal pulsars because of",
    "rfi would bring the survey yield and simulated population into agreement .",
    "the most recent palfa survey pipeline will be described in depth by p. lazarus ( 2014 , in preparation ) and that paper will also construct palfa s `` true '' sensitivity curve , taking into account the rfi environment by injecting artificial signals of varying strength into real data . in future work",
    ", we will reprocess precursor survey data with the current pipeline to see if it improves the shortcomings of earlier versions ( e.g. inconsistent detection statistics , noted in table [ tab : full ] ) .",
    "the assumed radial distribution of pulsars in the galaxy ( see table [ tab : popparams ] ) could also contribute to the discrepancy between expected ( simulated ) and true pulsar yields .",
    "since the distribution is based on extrapolated results from the pmps , which surveyed higher - populated regions of the sky , population density estimates for longitudes farther from galactic center may be inaccurate .",
    "over - estimated pulsar population densities in the galactic longitude range surveyed by the palfa precursor survey could be a factor in the discrepancies we find between expected and actual pulsar detections there .",
    "future refinement of pulsar population models using palfa results will provide consistency checks for existing population model parameters .",
    "we note that the current number of msps detected by palfa is consistent with predictions , but this is not surprising , given the high uncertainties in our model due to the precursor survey only detecting one msp . as the number of detections increases , future predictions will be far more constraining so that we can re - examine initial assumptions about the msp population characteristics .",
    "future population studies with the complete palfa survey will contribute substantially to current population models because of the galactic longitude ranges covered and arecibo s unrivaled sensitivity ( especially in the millisecond pulse period regime ) .",
