    "progress in fundamental physics is dependent on the identification of underlying symmetries such as general coordinate invariance or gauge invariance .",
    "the gauge symmetries appearing in the highly successful standard model ( sm ) of particles and interactions is based on cartan - lie algebras and their direct products .",
    "there have been valiant efforts to extend the sm within the framework of cartan - lie algebras and with the objective of , for example , reducing the number of free parameters appearing in the theory .",
    "however , attempts to formulate grand unified theories ( gut ) in which the direct product of the symmetries of the sm is embedded in some larger simple cartan - lie group have not had the same degree of success as the sm .",
    "the alternative possibility of unifying the gauge interactions with gravity in some ` theory of everything ' based on string theory is very enticing , in particular because this offers novel algebraic structures .    at a very basic level , and without any obvious direct interest for the content of the sm , cartan - lie symmetries are closely connected to the geometry of symmetric homogeneous spaces , which were classified by cartan himself .",
    "subsequently , an alternative geometry of non - symmetric spaces appeared , and their classification was suggested in 1955 by berger using holonomy theory  @xcite .",
    "there are several infinite series of spaces with holonomy groups @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and additionally some exceptional spaces with holonomy groups @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 .    beyond the sm , new theories as superstrings offer new clues how to attack the problem of the nature of symmetries at a very basic geometric level .",
    "for example , the compactification of the heterotic string leads to the classification of states in a representation of the kac - moody algebra of the gauge group @xmath9 or @xmath10 .",
    "these structures arose in compactifications of the heterotic superstring on 6-dimensional calabi - yau spaces , non - symmetric spaces with an @xmath11 holonomy group  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that group theory and algebraic structures play basic roles in the generic two - dimensional conformal field theories ( cfts ) that underlie string theory .",
    "the basic ingredients here are the central extensions of infinite - dimensional kac - moody algebras .",
    "there is a clear connection between these algebraic and geometric generalizations .",
    "affine kac - moody algebras are realized as the central extensions of loop algebras , namely the sets of mappings on a compact manifold such as @xmath12 that take values on a finite - dimensional lie algebra .",
    "superstring theory contains a number of other infinite - dimensional algebraic symmetries such as the virasoro algebra associated with conformal invariance and generalizations of kac - moody algebras themselves , such as hyperbolic and borcherd algebras .    in connection with calabi - yau spaces , ( coxeter-)dynkin",
    "diagrams which are in one - to - one correspondence with both cartan - lie and kac - moody algebras have been revealed through the technique of the crepant resolution of specific quotient singular structures such as the kleinian - du - val singularities @xmath13  @xcite , where @xmath14 is a discrete subgroup of @xmath15 .",
    "thus , the rich singularity structure of some examples of non - symmetrical calabi - yau spaces provides another opportunity to uncover infinite - dimensional affine kac - moody symmetries .",
    "the cartan matrices of affine kac - moody groups are identified with the intersection matrices of the unions of the complex projective lines resulting from the blow - ups of the singularities . for example , the crepant resolution of the @xmath16 singularity gives for rational , i.e. , genus - zero , ( -2 ) curves an intersection matrix that coincides with the a@xmath17 cartan matrix .",
    "this is also the case of @xmath18 spaces , where the classification of the degenerations of their elliptic fibers ( which can be written in weierstrass form ) and their associated singularities leads to a link between @xmath19 spaces and the infinite and exceptional series of affine kac - moody algebras , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( ade )  @xcite .    in the search for new symmetries and from calabi - yau geometry as inspirational basis",
    ", it has been defined the so called berger matrices @xcite which generalize cartan and cartan - kac - moody matrices . in purely algebraic terms , a berger matrix @xmath25 is a finite integral matrix characterized by the following data : @xmath26 the last condition means positivity of all principal proper minors of the matrix , this , together with the determinant equal zero corresponds to the _ affine condition_. a condition shared by kac - moody cartan matrices .",
    "the concept of berger matrices is obtained by weakening the conditions on the generalized cartan matrix @xmath27 appearing in affine kac - moody algebras .",
    "in fact , the only difference with respect to them is that the usual restriction on the diagonal elements ( @xmath28 for ckm matrices ) is relaxed .",
    "note that , more than one type of diagonal entry is allowed now : positive integer @xmath29 diagonal entries can coexist in a given matrix .    _",
    "`` non - affine '' _ berger matrices are also defined : the condition of zero determinant is eliminated .",
    "these matrices could play in some way the same role of basic simple blocks as finite lie algebras play for the case of affine kac - moody algebras .",
    "the study of properties and the systematic enumeration of the various possibilities concerning the large family of possible berger matrices can be facilitated by the introduction for each matrix of its generalized dynkin diagram @xmath30 .",
    "a schematic prescription for the most simple cases could be : a ) for a matrix of dimension @xmath31 , define @xmath31 vertexes and draw them as small circles . in case of appearance of vertexes with different diagonal entries",
    ", some graphical distinction will be performed .",
    "consider all the element @xmath32 of the matrix in turn .",
    "b ) draw one line from vertex @xmath33 to vertex @xmath34 if the corresponding element @xmath35 is non zero .",
    "some essential properties of cartan and berger matrices are easily deduced from the two well known frobenius - perron lemmas which we repeat here for convenience @xcite : first lemma . for a real symmetric matrix @xmath36 with elements",
    "@xmath37 , if the matrix is positive semi - definite , then the smallest eigenvalue of the matrix , eventually a zero eigenvalue , has multiplicity one and the corresponding eigenvector has all positive coordinates .",
    "second lemma , in the same case , let @xmath38 be the @xmath39 matrix obtained by deleting the @xmath33 row and column from @xmath36 . then @xmath38 is positive definite .    according to these lemma ,",
    "if the berger matrix @xmath25 is affine ( has determinant equal to zero ) then it has one and only one zero eigenvalue and corresponding to it , there is an eigenvector @xmath40 with all positive entries .",
    "the entries of this vector @xmath40 are by definition the coxeter labels . for a berger matrix @xmath41 of dimension @xmath31 ,",
    "the rank is @xmath42 . since @xmath25 is of rank @xmath42 , we can find one , and only one , non zero vector @xmath43 such that @xmath44 the numbers , @xmath45 , components of the vector @xmath43 , are called coxeter labels .",
    "the sums of the coxeter labels @xmath46 is the coxeter number . for a symmetric",
    "generalized cartan matrix only this type of coxeter number appear .",
    "the general objective of this work is to study , enumerate and classify all possible matrices of berger type beyond those already known ( cartan and kac - moody matrices ) and which are particular cases of the first ones . in concrete",
    "we study the most basic , yet non trivial , cases , the generalization of the exceptional kac - moody affine matrices @xmath0 .",
    "we choose as a guide the following remark : the matrices of these exceptional algebras basically consist of blocks containing standard @xmath47 cartan matrices on them .",
    "the corresponding graphs consist of a central node from which three legs depart .",
    "the number of nodes in each leg is strongly restricted .",
    "in fact only three possibilities , the three exceptional cases , exist .",
    "as a starting example ( other examples generalizing @xmath48 series will be the object of some other work ) we are interested in berger matrices which generalize the structure @xmath0 matrices .",
    "let us consider berger matrices with the following block structure : @xmath49 where @xmath50 are cartan matrices of undefined dimension @xmath51 and the @xmath52 are column vectors filled with zeroes except for one negative entry , @xmath53 .",
    "the number @xmath54 is an arbitrary positive integer .",
    "obviously these matrices are similar in structure to those matrices of the exceptional kac - moody affine algebras .",
    "the only difference is the number of blocks ( four instead of three ) and the value of @xmath54 .",
    "a general matrix can be obtained considering any number of blocks @xmath47 .",
    "the dimension of the original matrix @xmath25 is given by @xmath55 .",
    "for further reference , let us also define another important quantity in algebraic geometry applications is the `` squared canonical class '' @xmath56 of the matrix @xmath25 .",
    "this quantity is defined as the sum of all the elements of the matrix @xmath57 for the type of matrices , [ matrixbsl ] , of interest in this work , is important to remark that for cartan matrices @xmath47 , @xmath58 then @xmath59 finally , let us remark that the trace of the matrix @xmath60 is given by @xmath61    from this assumed structure it is obviously clear that this family of matrices fulfill nearly all the conditions for a berger matrix .",
    "the objective is to find all the sets of values of @xmath62 which make vanish the determinant of the matrix and then check for its positive - semidefitiness .      as a first way , the determinant of a general matrix of the type @xmath60 can easily be computed by induction following the laplace rule along the entries of the column of the @xmath63 .",
    "we have the result ( for the @xmath64 case for keeping notation simple ) @xmath65 where the @xmath66 are matrices of dimension one less than the original matrix , obtained from them by eliminating the last column and row .",
    "we have @xmath67 the formula is in this case : @xmath68 this is the final formula .",
    "from here we can obtain the finite number of combinations of integers @xmath51 which make vanish the determinant .      * if @xmath69 then @xmath70 is always positive . * if @xmath71 , th @xmath70 can be positive , negative or zero .",
    "+ the determinant equals zero if and only if @xmath72 + if the right side of the expression is less ( greater ) than one then the determinant is negative ( positive ) * if @xmath73 the determinant is positive or zero . the only possibility for the determinant to equal",
    "zero is that all @xmath74 . for @xmath75",
    "the determinant is negative . * finally , if @xmath76 the determinant is always negative .",
    "we can easily obtain the behavior in the general case for a matrix @xmath60 of similar structure as eq.([matrixbsl ] ) but with an arbitrary number @xmath77 of matrices @xmath78 in the diagonal .",
    "it is interesting the particular case @xmath79 . in this case",
    "the condition for the vanishing of the determinant is : @xmath80 for all the other values of @xmath81 the determinant is always positive .      for example , for m=5 , we have non trivial zero conditions for k=4,3 . for non",
    "trivial , we mean that in that case both expressions @xmath83 have solutions with no all the @xmath51 simultaneously equal one .",
    "it is obvious that the combination m=5,k=2 has however no zero solutions .",
    "we will see below that eq.([e1001 ] ) does not give essentially new solutions . solutions to this equation for fixed @xmath85 can be built from the solutions to equations of the same parameter @xmath54 and different @xmath86 in an iterative way .",
    "for example , below we will obtain the rule @xmath87 .",
    "the integer solutions to equations [ e1001 ] , e.g. partitions of unity in terms of `` egyptian fractions '' are well known in arithmetic .",
    "these equations can be casted in some other way : as partitions of an integer in terms of a fixed number of other integers which divide the original number .",
    "this can be seen as follows .",
    "first , let us define @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "then the previous equation [ e1001 ] is obviously written as @xmath90 clearly any of the summands divides the total : @xmath91 . in this formulation , in the most simple case @xmath92 , we are interested in numbers @xmath93 which can written as sum of their divisors @xmath94 .",
    "the number of divisors is fixed , @xmath77 , but they can appear repeated .",
    "this divisors does not need to be prime or relative prime .",
    "the different solutions will be presented as @xmath95 $ ] in the tables which follows .        according to the frobenius - perron lemma ,",
    "if the berger - cartan matrix @xmath25 is affine ( has determinant equal to zero ) then it has one and only one zero eigenvalue and corresponding to it , there is an eigenvector @xmath40 with all positive entries .",
    "the entries of this vector @xmath40 are by definition the coxeter labels .",
    "let us take the previous matrix @xmath25 and write the vector @xmath40 in block form corresponding to each of the submatrices @xmath78 : @xmath96 where the subvectors @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath93 is a , a priori unknown , constant .",
    "we assume that @xmath99 , this is equivalent to the set of equations : @xmath100 due to the special form of the vectors @xmath52 , the second equation becomes @xmath101      we arrive then to an important conclusion , for the coxeter labels to be integers , the constant @xmath93 is multiple of all the numbers @xmath104 , where the @xmath51 are the dimensions of the matrices @xmath78 .",
    "now , we insert this solution in the last equation of the system [ setcoxeter ] .",
    "we obtain @xmath105 and then @xmath106      an important parameter is the coxeter number @xmath109 which is defined as the sum of all the coxeter labels .",
    "this number is given by @xmath110 the value of @xmath109 is minimal for the choice of @xmath93 above .",
    "we can write the previous formula in the simple form including the dimension @xmath111 of the matrix @xmath112      it is convenient to re - obtain the same results with yet another method . as a byproduct of this",
    ", the matrix @xmath25 will be diagonalized .",
    "a simple algorithm for this purpose is described in ref.@xcite ( see also ref.@xcite for a description of the method ) to diagonalize matrices of the form @xmath113 where @xmath114 is a certain graph ( a plumbing tree - like graph ) the diagonalized matrix has the form @xmath115 with @xmath116 . thus @xmath117 .",
    "the diagonalization of the matrix can be translated into a new idea : the diagonalization of the corresponding graph .",
    "a diagonal graph is one with isolated nodes , not linked by edges . clearly",
    "the determinant of the matrix corresponding to the diagonalized graph , where the weights has been recalculated in some way , should be the same as the determinant of the initial matrix and graph .",
    "let us suppose generic trees weighted by arbitrary rational numbers @xmath118 . to diagonalize a given such tree @xmath114 , pick some vertex ( the central node for example ) and direct all edges toward this vertex .",
    "now simplify the graph @xmath114 by recursively deleting edges according to the procedures presented in table 12.3 of ref.@xcite .",
    "eventually we end up with a collection of isolated points with new weights @xmath119 , this is the diagonalized graph @xmath120 . then @xmath121 is the desired diagonalization of @xmath122 .",
    "thus @xmath123 . in particular , all the weights but the last one are guaranteed to be strictly positive numbers .",
    "the last one is given by : @xmath124 for the case of purely linear subgraphs with nodes weighted by @xmath125 , each of the @xmath126 are continued fractions of the type @xmath127 in the case of interest to us here , obviously we put @xmath128 and the quantities @xmath126 are the values of a continued fraction corresponding to a linear graph of weight-2 nodes ( any of our @xmath47 sub - graph ) .",
    "they are easily obtained @xmath129 obviously we reobtain the formula given by eq.[eqdet ] .",
    "in addition we obtain the rest of eigenvalues of the matrix and the explicit confirmation that is positive - semidefinite .",
    "note that the continued fraction @xmath126 correspond to the ratio of two determinants of matrices .",
    "the quantity @xmath130 is a generalized fraction .",
    "it can be interpreted as a ( generalized ) determinant of a set of matrices .",
    "case m=2 , k = m-1=1 . in this case",
    "the condition for vanishing determinant is @xmath133 the only possibility is the trivial one @xmath134 .",
    "this case correspond to the generalized cartan matrix : @xmath135    case @xmath136 . in this case",
    "the condition for vanishing determinant contains three `` egyptian fractions '' @xmath137 there are exactly three integer solutions to this equation .",
    "they are @xmath138 they obviously correspond to the graphs and cartan matrices of the three exceptional affine kac - moody algebras @xmath139 . in our notation @xmath140        in the cases @xmath144 and",
    "@xmath145 with @xmath79 the formulas for vanishing determinant contain summatories of five or six egyptian fractions respectively . for @xmath144",
    "there are exactly @xmath146 solutions to this equation while for @xmath145 there are exactly @xmath147 solutions to this equation , in both case , part of the solutions are tabulated in tables ( [ td5 ] ) and ( [ td6 ] ) where we present those solutions with @xmath148 .",
    "some of them ( those with @xmath148 ) . for a full list consult ref.@xcite .    for @xmath149 ,",
    "the condition of vanishing is similar , however in these cases the total number of solutions is not known in general . however one can easily obtain a large number of solutions by numerical methods .",
    "it is also obvious that solutions for a given @xmath77 can be obtained from those solutions of an smaller @xmath77 .",
    "the only non - trivial cases are obtained for @xmath152 and @xmath153 . for @xmath152",
    "there are exactly 3 solutions which are presented in table[t1sds ] . for @xmath153",
    "there are exactly 17 solutions which are presented in table[t1wew ] .            in conclusion , the interest to look for new algebras beyond lie algebras started from the @xmath15- conformal theories ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "one can think that geometrical concepts , in particular algebraic geometry , could be a natural and more promising way to do this .",
    "this marriage of algebra and geometry has been useful in both ways .",
    "it is very well known , by the serre theorem , that dynkin diagrams defines one - to - one cartan matrices and these ones lie or kac - moody algebras . in this work ,",
    "we have generalized some of the properties of cartan matrices for cartan - lie and kac - moody algebras into a new class of affine , and non - affine berger matrices .",
    "we arrive then to the obvious conclusion that any algebraic structure emerging from this can not be a cla or kma algebra .",
    "the main difference of these matrices with respect previous definitions being in the values that diagonal elements of the matrices can take .    in this work we have enumerated in a systematic way all the possibilities of a special class of berger matrices which includes as a subclass the ordinary matrices of kac - moody affine exceptional algebras .    .",
