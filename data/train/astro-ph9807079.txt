    "the chamaeleon molecular cloud is one of the most interesting target to investigate the formation of low mass stars and the low mass end of the initial mass function ( imf ) , because of its nearby location and its position far away of the galactic plane ( @xmath7 ) where the density of background stars is relatively small .",
    "a complete census of young objects requires to survey deeply wide areas in a spectral range that is not much hampered by dust extinction , namely the near and mid  infrared .",
    "this has been made possible only recently thanks to the release of data provided by large scale sky surveys in the near  infrared such as denis @xcite .",
    "low mass young stellar objects ( ysos ) are characterised by @xmath8 line emission @xcite and an infrared excess that reveals the presence of circumstellar material in the near - infrared @xcite , or in the mid and far - infrared as shown by the iras @xcite and iso @xcite data .",
    "x - ray emission surveys provided by the einstein and rosat missions , have also contributed to identifying young objects @xcite .",
    "finally , millimetre observations @xcite , mostly in co lines , allow the identification through the measurement of the gas emission and outflows that often characterise ysos .",
    "known pre - main - sequence stars in the chamaeleon cloud consist essentially of t tauri stars ( tts ) @xcite of spectral type ranging from k5 to m5 @xcite .",
    "their mass ranges from 0.2 to @xmath9 with a distribution peaking at @xmath10 , and their current age estimate is greater than @xmath11 years , according to lawson et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the chamaeleon i ( cha i ) cloud has been surveyed in various spectral ranges from millimetre to x - ray , but investigation are yet limited to small areas or low sensitivity .    during its first year of operations ,",
    "denis has covered the whole surface of the cha i cloud in the @xmath4 bands with a good sensitivity ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "thanks to its wide surface coverage , stars far away from the known cores of the cloud can be detected .",
    "an extinction map of the cloud was recently drawn out using @xmath3 star counts @xcite , and the aim of the present work is to pursue the exploitation of these data in order to pick up already catalogued tts and to provide an homogeneous set of data and to try to single out new yso candidates , especially toward the low luminosity end .    up to now , 126 pre - main - sequence stars have been recognised in the cha i cloud by various authors .",
    "section [ obs_res ] presents the denis photometric data of these 126 stars and of 54 new candidates that have been selected using the method described in section [ selection ] .",

    "the observations presented here have been collected as part of the denis survey between january and may 1996 at la silla ( chile ) using the eso 1 metre telescope equipped with the specially designed 3-channel camera @xcite .",
    "they cover an area of @xmath13 centred at @xmath14 ( j2000 ) in three bands , namely @xmath15 ( 0.8@xmath16 ) , @xmath3 ( 1.25@xmath16 ) and @xmath17 ( 2.15@xmath16 ) .",
    "they consist of 13 strips each involving 180 images of @xmath18 taken at constant ra along an arc of @xmath19 in declination .",

    "our selection method of new yso candidates is essentially based on the ir colours and magnitudes of the objects after de  reddening .",
    "however , before attempting to select new yso candidates , we have first estimated the contamination by background and foreground stars and the influence of the luminosity classes on the star magnitudes . to derive this information",
    ", we have run the so called _ besanon _ model @xcite in the direction of the cha i cloud .",
    "the model has been parametrised to take into account the denis limiting magnitudes and photometric errors .",
    "it neglects the cloud itself ( extinction , star formation ) .",
    "figure [ besancon ] displays synthetic colour - magnitude diagrams obtained for the different classes of luminosity using this model .",
    "the brightest stars ( @xmath27 ) correspond to highly red giants ( @xmath28 ) , and the colour dispersion of the faintest stars results of the photometric errors .",
    "we must keep in mind these two points before using an infrared excess criterion to identify the ysos .",
    "it is clear that we can identify only the objects exhibiting a strong infrared excess , i.e @xmath28 .",
    "the number of objects detected both in @xmath3 and @xmath17 band within the covered area is @xmath29 10000 , while the model yields only some 150 foreground stars , i.e. less than @xmath30 , assuming a distance of the cloud of 140 pc .",
    "a previous investigation based on denis star counts in the @xmath3 band on the cha i cloud enabled us to draw an accurate extinction map @xcite with a spatial resolution of @xmath31 .",
    "the peak of visual absorption that was measured is about 10 magnitudes .",
    "this map is used to deredden all the stars detected within the area that it encompasses . for those stars located inside the cloud , this reddening is , of course , an upper limit .",
    "the yso candidates are selected according to their colour and magnitude properties after this dereddening has been applied .",
    "consequently , we introduce a bias in the selection of the reddest objects that is discussed below .    in practice ,",
    "we have plotted the dereddened magnitudes in a colour - magnitude diagram together with the main sequence ( fig .",
    "[ know_new ] ) and selected the stars which are separated from the main sequence by a distance corresponding to 8 magnitudes of visual extinction , at least .",
    "this provides 90 stars .",
    "part of them can not be shifted towards the main sequence just assuming an even larger extinction , and are likely to be intrinsically very red .",
    "this sample , still contains some unreliable sources because of photometric errors and , also , some red giant background stars . after eliminating these objects which are , basically , the bright and the faint ends of the sample , we are left with the 54 good candidates listed in table [ newyso ] .",
    "all of them have been carefully checked afterwards by visual inspection of the denis images to avoid possible misleading cross - identifications between the 3 denis channels , or optical artifacts such as ghosts produced by nearby bright star or bad pixels .",
    "since the exact value of the extinction suffered by each star can not be accurately determined , we have assumed that it is the total extinction measured on the line of sight and taken it as an upper limit .",
    "consequently , the constraints on the star colours depend on the location of the star with respect to the cloud .",
    "the criterion is more strict for stars in the front edge of the cloud than for stars just behind the cloud . in other words ,",
    "the infrared excess can be hidden by an overestimate of the reddening actually suffered by the stars .",
    "the stars that we possibly missed should be , in average , brighter than the selected stars because they are less obscured .",
    "fortunately , the near  infrared range is less sensitive to extinction than optical bands .",
    "the average visual extinction in the cha i cloud is about 4 magnitudes , i.e. @xmath32 magnitudes of @xmath17 extinction .",
    "so , this effect does not introduce a significant bias in the luminosity function .",
    "we can crudely evaluate the maximum number of missed stars . assuming that the extinction would be reduced by a factor 2",
    ", the total number of selected star with our infrared excess method would increase by a factor 1.7 , i.e. @xmath33 additional stars .",
    "most of them would probably be background stars because the extinction is now underestimated for these stars and thus , a residual infrared excess remains .",
    "nevertheless , this provides an indication of the maximum number of stars that we can miss .",
    "in the final sample of 54 candidates , 34 are detected in the 3 channels , 16 only in @xmath3 and @xmath17 , and 4 only in @xmath17 band ( see table [ newyso ] ) .",
    "figure [ know_new ] displays a colour - magnitude and a colour - colour diagram for the known t tauri stars @xcite and the denis candidates .",
    "the magnitudes given for the known t tauri stars ( tts ) come from the denis observations .",
    "the known tts consists of classical and weak - line tts @xcite .",
    "the weak - line or naked @xcite tts show only little infrared excess and they are characterised by a @xmath34  .",
    "it corresponds to a later stage of evolution when a large fraction of the circumstellar material has been accreted .",
    "hence , our candidates are likely to be classical tts with strong emission lines and massive circumstellar accretion disks .",
    "we stress the point that our estimation of reddening is an upper limit .",
    "this explains that already known tts are represented on the left of the main sequence in the colour - magnitude diagram and in the lower left corner of the colour - colour diagram .",
    "these objects probably lie on the front side of the cloud and thus do not suffer the total extinction that we have derived on the line of sight .",
    "the brightest candidates are represented in an area of the diagram where already known tts are found .",
    "most of the known tts have a smaller value of @xmath35 , but if we try to extend our sample toward bluer colours , we would enter an area corresponding to the giant and sub - giant stars , where no separation can reliably be made on the basis of near - ir colours .    moreover , very few known tts are as red as the denis candidates",
    ". an explanation could be an underestimation of the dereddening , but the colour - colour diagram indicates that at least 13 objects ( detected in the 3 colours ) can not be shifted toward the main sequence simply by removing an additional reddening component .",
    "these candidates are among the reddest objects detected by denis .",
    "they were not previously detected because they are too faint and/or too far away of the cores .",
    "the cross - identification of denis and rosat pointed observations in the cha i @xcite shows that all x - ray sources detected by rosat are brighter than @xmath36 and they do not exhibit strong infrared excess .    the spatial distribution of the candidates ( fig .",
    "[ flag ] ) is also very remarkable .",
    "these sources have a trend to be concentrated near the cores of the cloud which strongly argue in favour of their young nature , since background giant stars would be uniformly spread over the whole field .",
    "another interpretation remains : we could be in presence of small dark clumps that were not resolved in our extinction map . then , an additional reddening would have to be taken into account , but , again",
    ", only a fraction of the candidate locations in colour  colour diagrams can be explained by normal reddening . in such case",
    ", the clumps should be smaller than @xmath31 and would produce a visual extinction greater than 15 magnitudes .",
    "although this interpretation can not be definitely ruled out , we assume that these objects are more likely to be true young tts , since the high infrared excess probably reveals the presence of a large amount of circumstellar material .",
    "finally , we have examined the interpretation that some of these stars could be brown dwarfs . on the theoretical evolutionary tracks for low  mass stars , young brown dwarfs are actually about 3 magnitudes brighter in @xmath37 than old ones ,",
    "hence , they could be detected at the distance of cha i at our sensitivity limit .",
    "comern et al .",
    "@xcite have , indeed , reported the possible discovery of brown dwarfs in the @xmath38 oph molecular cloud at a comparable distance of 160 pc .",
    "however , the @xmath39 excess of young brown dwarfs is generally smaller than 1.5 and the @xmath25 is greater than 3.5 .",
    "since our faintest candidates have all @xmath40 and @xmath41 , we conclude that they are unlikely to be brown dwarfs .      in order to evaluate the stage of evolution of these new objects , we have attempted to compare their position in a hr diagram with the evolutionary tracks modelled by dantona & mazzitelli @xcite .",
    "since this model does not take into account the circumstellar contribution , it is necessary to evaluate the respective contributions of the stellar and circumstellar components to the emergent flux .",
    "the tts , especially the classical ones are surrounded by massive circumstellar accretion disks which produces both extinction and emission .",
    "the extinction is caused by the dust grains , but the emission process is more intricate .",
    "rydgren & zak @xcite have shown that the infrared excess can not be explained only in terms of thermal emission of grains in the circumstellar disk .",
    "an intrinsic disk luminosity contribution is required to account for the observations .",
    "they have shown that the intensity of the intrinsic component is directly related to the accretion rate and has the same order of magnitude as the thermal emission . according to calvet et al .",
    "@xcite the near - infrared emission of protostars is largely dominated by an infalling dusty envelope emission .",
    "protostars correspond to class i objects @xcite with massive envelopes .",
    "tts are class ii or class iii objects , the essential of their circumstellar matter is in the accretion disk .",
    "meyer et al .",
    "@xcite suggest that the infrared excess of tts is essentially due to the disk emission , without any envelope effect .",
    "they found accretion rates in the range from @xmath42 to @xmath43yr@xmath44 and inner disk radii from 2 to 6 @xmath45 .",
    "fortunately , the contribution of the disk to the emission is likely to be negligible at wavelengths shorter than @xmath46 .",
    "then , the @xmath15 , and , with probably less confidence , the @xmath3 fluxes can be considered as mainly of photospheric origin , although assuming no @xmath15 excess , meyer et al .",
    "@xcite have estimated the @xmath3 excess to be only @xmath47 of the photospheric flux for the classical tts and to 0 for weak  line tts .",
    "thus , the colour excess is a good estimator of the extinction suffered by the star .",
    "the use of the @xmath25 colour excess may lead to underestimating the extinction because of the intrinsic luminosity of the accretion disc , but probably not more than 50% .    in order to convert the evolutionary tracks in the hr diagram of dantona & mazzitelli @xcite into similar tracks in colour  magnitude diagram we use the flower s table @xcite which gives the bolometric correction for the @xmath48 band versus the effective temperature . assuming that the star photosphere emits like a black body at the effective temperature",
    ", we derive @xmath49 .",
    "the comparison of the main  sequence that we have constructed in this way with main  sequences based upon observations by bessel & brett @xcite and johnson @xcite indicates that the assumption that the photosphere radiates like a black body is basically correct for these colours .",
    "we remark that it is not the case for the g4-m6 spectral range in the @xmath17 band .",
    "previous studies have shown that the associated members of the cha i cloud are essentially in the k7-m5 spectral range @xcite .",
    "assuming that all stars are of spectral type m0 we can estimate the extinction they suffer .",
    "figure [ tracki_ij ] shows a @xmath25 versus @xmath15 diagram where all the tts ( known and candidates ) are represented .",
    "the representation of the stars is clearly distributed along the reddening vector .",
    "their position is compatible with a m0 spectral type ( @xmath50 ) except for a part of the faintest sources for which @xmath51 seems to be more appropriate .",
    "note that 22 stars are missing because they are not detected in @xmath15 .",
    "the extinction values that we have taken for each individual source are given in tables [ knownyso ] and [ newyso ] .",
    "the restriction to the m0 spectral type implies uncertainties smaller than 1 magnitude of visual extinction because the tracks for different masses remain very close to each other .    without a circumstellar component , we should have @xmath52  the equality standing for a star just located behind the cloud . in fig .",
    "[ avav ] we remark that less than @xmath53 of the stars are in that case .",
    "the dispersion of @xmath54 increases with @xmath55 .",
    "a first explanation could be simply the fact that the location of each star within the cloud is not known precisely .",
    "moreover , the separation between circumstellar and cloud extinction is not possible .",
    "another explanation could be the evolutionary stage of the star , the closer a star is to its forming area ( i.e. the most obscured regions ) the younger it is likely to be .",
    "so , this dispersion may result from the effect of the circumstellar disk properties : mass , inclination .",
    "figure [ avav ] shows that visual extinction for stars is smaller than 10 magnitudes which confirms they are likely to be tts rather than protostars @xcite .",
    "protostars have massive envelopes which cause greater extinction of up to tens of magnitudes .",
    "nevertheless , only stars detected in @xmath15 are represented and , among the 6 stars detected only in @xmath17 , 4 are also detected by iso ( irs4 and irs5 in table [ knownyso ] ; @xmath56 23 and 41 in table [ newyso ] ) in the lw2 and lw3 filters centred at @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively ( p. persi , private communication ) .",
    "these sources are thus likely to be protostars of class i. according to prusti et al @xcite ced110 irs4 and irs6 are confirmed class i objects",
    ".      based on a study of the solar neighbourhood stellar population , miller & scalo @xcite have derived the imf from the @xmath48 luminosity function of main - sequence stars , and concluded that the imf can be well approximated by a half - gaussian distribution . in star - forming regions",
    "the population consists of ysos often too faint in @xmath48 or too highly reddened to be seen on schmidt plates .",
    "the @xmath37 band is the most appropriate to investigate the luminosity function in these areas @xcite .",
    "figure [ histok ] displays the @xmath17 luminosity function ( klf ) for the tts of the cloud including known sources and our candidates .",
    "the sample of known stars merge various observations that may be neither homogeneous , nor complete , since stars have been selected according to various criteria : @xmath8 emission , near - infrared excess or x - ray emission .",
    "examination of the klf ( fig .",
    "[ histok.cand ] ) for all the denis selected objects shows 2 turnovers , the first one at @xmath59 in the klf is probably real while the second one at @xmath60 corresponds to the denis completeness limit .",
    "the interpretation of the luminosity function requires a model for the star formation .",
    "theoretical evolutionary tracks @xcite are used to derive a mass - luminosity relation .",
    "stellar @xmath17 magnitudes are computed assuming that they radiate like a black - body at their effective temperature and are calibrated using the standard solar parameters .",
    "we compute the mass - luminosity relation for 44 ages ranging from @xmath61 to @xmath62 years .",
    "we obtain similar results as zinnecker & mccaughrean @xcite who have derived the relation for the ages @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath11 , @xmath65 years .",
    "to estimate when the star formation occurs in the cloud , we use the half - gaussian imf given by miller & scalo @xcite .",
    "a monte - carlo simulation gives the 44 luminosity functions @xmath66 for each age corresponding to a mass - luminosity relation .",
    "since each theoretical klf , @xmath66 , corresponds to a given age , the observed denis klf can be fitted by a sum of @xmath66 with different weight coefficients @xmath67 .",
    "the solution consists in the resolution of the linear system of equations : @xmath68 the singular value decomposition is used to invert the matrix and then , derive the @xmath67 coefficients .",
    "when a coefficient is found to be negative , the corresponding luminosity function is removed and the process is iterated with the remaining luminosity functions .",
    "figure [ klf_fit ] shows the simulated klf and the denis klf . because of",
    "the small number of stars , the birth rate function can not be derived accurately .",
    "the poissonian errors do not allow the determination of its shape ( increasing , constant or decreasing with time ) .",
    "nevertheless , the presence of two peaks in the klf allows the estimate of the age of the sample . at first glance",
    ", one could invoke another period of star formation to explain the second peak at @xmath69 .",
    "this interpretation would , however , require stars older than @xmath70 years which is in contradiction with our criterion that selects only stars with massive circumstellar accretion disks .",
    "since the accretion rate is known to be about @xmath71yr@xmath44 @xcite our selected stars can not be older than a few million years and this interpretation should be ruled out .",
    "to explain this peak , several factors should be taken into account .",
    "the intrinsic dispersion of the magnitudes and the completeness limit imply a malmquist bias which causes an overestimation of the number of faintest stars .",
    "this bias is about @xmath72 magnitude and so , can be ignored .",
    "examination of the position of the 9 stars fainter than @xmath73 and detected in the three colours ( 9 objects ) in a colour - colour diagram shows that their extreme colour can not be interpreted in terms of reddening , hence high extinction clumps on their line of sight can not be invoked .    among the 11 stars which are not detected in @xmath15 , 3 ( @xmath56 36 , 43 and 44 )",
    "lie in the direction of the molecular outflow observed in co lines by mattila et al .",
    "@xcite in a 22   beam size . in this direction , they estimate a visual extinction of 17 magnitudes . since our estimate of the extinction in this area is only 6 magnitudes with a 2  resolution map , these stars can be background objects .",
    "the 6 stars detected only in @xmath17 also contribute to the second peak .",
    "some of them are known protostars ( irs4 and irs6 in table [ knownyso ] ) and others are likely to be so ( see above ) .",
    "their faintness results from the effect of a massive circumstellar envelope .",
    "we remark that the star responsible for the outflow cited above could be the star @xmath56 41 , detected only in @xmath17 , rather than the known source t42 = sz32 ( persi p. , private communication ) .",
    "finally , possible unresolved binaries would lead to misleading colours that can not be corrected .",
    "so , this peak is not fully understood and further deeper observations in @xmath37 are requested to reach a better completeness limit .",
    "+ the first peak at @xmath74 requires a period of star formation that would extend from @xmath75 to @xmath76 years .",
    "besides , the @xmath17 excess modifies the luminosity function with a mean of 1.5 magnitude with respect to the spectral energy distribution of a main  sequence star .",
    "the mean extinction suffered by stars is about 5 magnitudes of visual extinction ( fig .",
    "[ avav ] ) , i.e. 0.5 magnitude of @xmath17 extinction .",
    "the combination of these two effects shifts the klf of 1 magnitude toward the fainter magnitudes . that led us to change our age estimation from @xmath75@xmath76 to @xmath5@xmath6 years .",
    "we stress the point that it just means that we do not detect older stars with our infrared excess criterion .",
    "older stars have lost their disk , or , the accretion rate has become smaller and then , they no longer exhibit an infrared excess .",
    "the apparent drop of the klf down to @xmath77 probably results from a vanishing of the circumstellar disk rather than from a real decrease of the star formation rate .",
    "the maximum life time of a circumstellar disk is then estimated to @xmath6 years for low - mass stars which corresponds to the oldest classical tts .",
    "the investigation of the denis data obtained in the cha i cloud allowed the identification of 54 new faint ysos candidates . they are selected on the basis of a large infrared excess and their concentration near to the cores of the cloud . because of their ir excess they are likely to be surrounded by a massive circumstellar disk for which the visual extinction can reach 10 magnitudes ( fig .",
    "[ avav ] ) and thus are probably classical tts .",
    "comparison of the different magnitudes in the three denis channels shows that the @xmath17 excess is @xmath78 magnitudes , in agreement with meyer et al .",
    "@xcite who estimate from spectroscopic observations a @xmath37 excess smaller than 1.6 magnitudes .",
    "investigations on the @xmath17 luminosity function down to @xmath79 shows important results concerning the age of our sample .",
    "first of all , youngest stars in the cha i cloud are about @xmath5 years , except for few protostars .",
    "moreover , the decrease of the klf for @xmath80 indicates that stars older than @xmath6 years have lost their circumstellar disk .",
    "the maximum life time of active disk is estimated to @xmath6 years , after this period , the accretion becomes too small ( @xmath81.yr@xmath44 ) to produce an infrared excess .",
