    ", we have discussed the crossover from a nonlinear creep current in a static electric field to the linear ac response in 1d disordered interacting electron systems . while the linear ac conductivity is described by a generalized mott - halperin law , for stronger fields one finds a reduction of this linear conductivity as both states of a tls are occupied with comparable probability .",
    "the crossover between nonlinear ac conductivity and dc creep current occurs when the spatial extension of tlss matches the length scale for tunneling of kinks ."
