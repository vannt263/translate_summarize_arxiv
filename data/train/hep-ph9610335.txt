    "in the standard model of electroweak interactions all masses are generated by the higgs mechanism . as a consequence , at high temperatures a transition occurs from a massive low - temperature phase to a ` massless ' high - temperature phase , where the higgs vacuum expectation value ` evaporates ' and the electroweak symmetry is ` restored ' @xcite .    due to the chiral nature of the weak interactions baryon number ( @xmath7 ) and lepton number ( @xmath8 ) are not conserved in the standard model @xcite . at zero temperature",
