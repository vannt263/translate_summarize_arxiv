    "new scenarios of reentry annihilation were identified , different from the classical unidirectional block @xcite , which is still considered to be the most important mode of termination .",

    "the transient or persistent coexistence of two antegrade fronts is a new type of dynamics in which the effects of the stimuli can not be represent as perturbations of a limit - cycle , as it has been done for models in which the steep slope criteria was not fulfill @xcite .    in clinical and experimental investigations ,",
    "stimulations are currently used to either study the characteristics of reentry circuits through resetting or to stop the tachycardias @xcite .",

    "we may consider the dynamics that will be observed  with this setting for each of the three scenarios of annihilation by alternans amplification .",

    "each front is seen thrice , with similar oscillation in the time series of  the difference .",
    "however , the structure of oscillation of the cycle as well as the last value before annihilation depend on the position of the electrode in the circuit . in a protocol for annihilation by unidirectional block , the detection of @xmath175and @xmath104 would indicate that the stimuli were beyond the vulnerable window and would trigger the application of a new stimulus at shorter coupling interval . however , this could rather reinitiate a reentry bound to stop by alternans amplification .    to allow the unidirectional block of @xmath105",
    ", @xmath72 must be applied early beyond the vulnerable window , in the portion of the excitable gap referred as partially refractory by electrophysiologists @xcite .",
    "the prematurity of  @xmath72 , in conjunction with the high slope of the apd restitution curve and of the @xmath176 dispersion curve , create a concave asymmetrical profile of @xmath17 around @xmath114 . for a given @xmath72 , the @xmath73 intervals for which @xmath105 is blocked depends on the local dynamics around @xmath114 that is again determined by the apd restitution and the dispersion of @xmath176 . in fact , when the parameters @xmath100 is used to describe the timing of the first stimulus , the [ @xmath177 range to get a block of @xmath105 becomes independent of @xmath77 .",
    "the pivotal role of the @xmath26 and @xmath178functions is further confirmed by the capacity of the i d model to reproduce the dynamics of the ionic model .",
    "however , in order to avoid discontinuity in @xmath17 in the region where @xmath105 is blocked and get a correct representation of the dynamics , spatial averaging must be included in the computation of the spatial profile of @xmath17 .",
    "originally , spatial averaging was added to the i d model to reproduce the modulation of the repolarization by resistive coupling in order to correct the shortcomings of the model regarding the details of the bifurcation from periodic to qp propagation @xcite .  including spatial averaging becomes even more essential when stimulations and blocks produce steep gradients in  @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "while the wide range of [ @xmath177  for which @xmath105 is blocked does not depends on @xmath77 , this is not the case for the subset of this interval leading to reentry annihilation by alternans amplification . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_map_single ] , the interval of block is very large for @xmath179 and decreases gradually until it disappears at @xmath180 . for the mbr model used herein , annihilation by alternans amplification exists for @xmath181 cm , and it occurs on a range of [ @xmath177 that remains much wider than the @xmath124 ms standard vulnerable window for most of this range of @xmath77 .",
    "this is consistent with the result of a clinical study in which dual pulses stimulation was found to be four times more effective than single stimulus to stop monomorphic ventricular tachycardia in man @xcite .",
    "as @xmath77  is increased , the [ @xmath177 area of @xmath105 block also encloses a growing number of tongues with increasingly prolong coexistence of @xmath95 and @xmath104 , a process that culminates in the appearance of zones of transition to dw reentry .",
    "then the zones with transition to dw reentry extend until they cover completely the area in which @xmath105 is blocked . from @xmath182 blocking @xmath105 yields automatically to sustained dw  reentry .",
    "hence , transition to dw reentry does not necessarily imply a heterogeneous substrate as it is been proposed elsewhere @xcite , but can also be achieved in a homogeneous medium through the creation of a functional heterogeneity by a limited number of electrical stimulations . annihilation and transition to dw occur on separated ranges of loop lengths .",
    "on shorter loop , reentry annihilation is produced when alternans amplification reaches an amplitude high enough to block @xmath95and @xmath104 .",
    "on longer loop , the distributed alternans saturate at an amplitude that still permits sustained propagation . in our version of the br model ,",
    "the transition from sw qp to period-1 reentry at @xmath183 is supercritical .",
    "however , we have shown that , for other sets of parameters , the bifurcation is subcritical , with bistability between qp and period-1 reentry near @xmath183 @xcite . in these cases",
    ", it is possible that the two - stimulations protocol applied to the sw period-1 reentry near @xmath183 could induced a transition to sw qp propagation , a phenomenon that was not possible with the instance of the mbr model used in this paper .",
    "our results are consistent with different clinical and experimental observations , and open the possibility to design more effective anti - arrhythmic pacing strategies .",
    "however , the modeling studies must be extended to more realistic representations to evaluate properly  potential applications .",
    "preliminary results from an ongoing work on a two - dimensional annulus show that block by alternans amplification can still be obtained on this setting , but that additional scenarios are possible , including termination through transient fibrillation that has also been observed in real cardiac tissue .",
    "tissue heterogeneity , either at the level of the ionic properties or of the cells coupling , could also be important since termination of reentry has been obtained in a one - dimensional loop model embedding a small area of slower conduction but using an ionic model with minimal apd restitution properties @xcite .",
    "it remains to be seen if annihilation based on alternans amplification would be amplified or reduced by the inclusion of spatial inhomogeneity .",
    "investigation will also have to be extended to bidomain model in order to get a more proper representation of the stimulus .",
    "the simplified representation used herein can be an acceptable approximation for low amplitude stimuli or to mimic the effect spontaneous firing of a group of cells .",
    "however it is known that current spread of the stimulus depend on the properties of the external and internal medium @xcite .",
    "the mbr representation of the ionic properties is also oversimplified . however , since most phenomena described in this paper occurs in the few first beat after the stimulations and can be explained from the apd restitution and speed dispersion , it is unlikely that slow memory effects appearing in the dynamics of more complex model would change the behaviour .",
    "characterizing the apd restitution and speed dispersion of the more complex model in the range of frequency of repetitive activity associated to reentry should allow a prediction of the possible dynamics .",
    "this work is a further illustration of the richness and diversity of the dynamics that can results from the restitution of apd and dispersion of the speed even in a simplified model of the tissue .",
    "it has revealed some unexpected behaviours , like block by alternans amplification , which can be much more prevalent than the mechanism of unidirectional block that are usually assumed to be dominant .",
