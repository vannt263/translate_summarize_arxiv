    "according to paper i the filaments are formed from clouds of disk gas that have been accelerated into the outflow by the ram - pressure of the wind .",
    "an important question that arises is : can the clouds survive being immersed in a hot supersonic wind long enough to form a filament and remain sufficiently cool to emit at optical temperatures ? or will they be heated and destroyed by hydrodynamical instabilities ? here we set out to answer this question .    another significant result to arise from paper",
    "i is our proposal of four different mechanisms that would give rise to soft x - ray emission that is spatially correlated with the filamentary optical emission ; a major finding of recent _ chandra _ observations @xcite .",

    "clouds of disk gas inside and surrounding the central injection zone are broken - up by the freely expanding wind ; fragments of disk gas are accelerated into the outflow by the ram - pressure of the wind .    since it is the interaction of the clouds with the freely expanding wind that results in their fragmentation , we select the temperature , density and velocity of our supersonic wind to be that of the inner free - wind region , namely @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 respectively .",

    "the density scale of the simulations is inversely proportional to the spatial scale , so that within reason , these simulations can be adapted to problems on both larger and small scales .",
    "the interaction of a supersonic wind with a cloud of dense gas is a problem of some complexity .",
    "whilst there are many factors that could affect a clouds evolution and survival , such as thermal conduction @xcite , magnetic fields @xcite and photoevaporation @xcite ( see   [ missing ] ) , here we focus on the importance of radiative cooling and the effect on the clouds initial structure . we have also performed a comprehensive resolution study in order to ascertain the degree as to which the assumed resolution effected our global simulations in paper i.    we adopt the following naming convention for our simulations : an @xmath36 or an @xmath37 indicates whether the simulation includes radiative cooling or is adiabatic , while an @xmath38 or an @xmath39 indicates if the geometry of the cloud is fractal or spherical respectively .",

    ". however , the initial density increase observed in the cloud is not as extreme ( e.g. @xmath66 ) .",
    "the cloud material is heated to temperatures of the order of @xmath67 and the cloud expands .",
    "the shock travels though the cloud , reflecting off the back surface at approximately 0.27 myr , somewhat faster than in the radiative cloud .",
    "the adiabatic cloud expands transversely as it is accelerated downstream .",
    "however , this transverse expansion is suppressed in the radiative cloud as a result of the lower degree of heating of the cloud gas ( fig . [",

    "the internal cloud shock reflects again off the front the cloud at approximately 0.35 myr . at this time , the transverse expansion of the cloud persists and the kelvin - helmholtz instability continues to strip material from the clouds exterior into the downstream tail of gas .",

    "[ fig : var_as ] ; middle panels ) results in a higher rate of acceleration in the adiabatic model . as a consequence ,",
    "the cloud has a lower relative mach number relative to the stream ( fig .",

    "[ fig : var_sph ] ; lower left panel ) . the growth rate of the kelvin - helmholtz instability is lower for higher mach numbers and its effect",
    "is strongly diminished for the radiative cloud .",
    "the adiabatic cloud is more easily disrupted and destroyed .",
    "this can be dramatically seen in the middle left panel of figure [ fig : dens_adi ] where the kelvin - helmholtz instability has stripped the entire outer layer of the adiabatic spherical cloud ( see also fig . 3 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    since a radiative cloud is broken - up via the kelvin - helmholtz instability into a filamentary structure of small @xmath64 1 pc sized clouds , the survival of these small clouds is of interest .",
    "we now compare the cloud crushing time ( @xmath71 ) and the kelvin - helmholtz timescale ( @xmath72 ) to the cooling time ( @xmath73 ) of a cloud with radius @xmath74 , density @xmath75 , temperature @xmath76 , and velocity @xmath77 .",

    "the kelvin - helmholtz timescale is @xmath81 .",
    "the cooling time for a 1 pc cloud in our simulations is of the order of @xmath82 seconds , somewhat shorter than the cloud crushing time and the kelvin - helmholtz timescale , suggesting that the cloudlets may remain sufficiently stable to ablation and survive to later times .",
    "in addition , we note that the self - gravity of the clouds may cause them to collapse , becoming more difficult to disrupt @xcite .",
    "in order to test the dependence of our results on the numerical resolution of the code , we have performed seven simulations of the radiative fractal cloud interacting with a supersonic wind at increasing resolutions from 0.78 - 0.10 pc per cell width ( see table [ sim_param ] ) .",

    "the mass flux over the first 0.4 myr of the evolution is similar at all resolutions .",
    "this is a result of the well resolved hot stream of gas passing through the flux surface .",
    "after this point , the cloud material begins to pass though the surface and the mass flux starts to vary with resolution .",
    "the initial drop in the mass flux seen in the left hand panel of figure [ fig : mass_flux ] is due to the rarefaction that passes though the flux surface ( see fig . [",
    "fig : dens_sph ] ; top left panel ) . from approximately 0.2 to 0.4 myr",
    ", the density of the stream increases as mass is ablated from the rear of the cloud resulting in a similar flux at all resolutions . during this time",
    ", the mass flux gradually increases as the @xmath84 mass loaded stream of gas passes through the flux surface . at approximately 0.4 myr , the mass flux begins to vary rapidly , dramatically increasing in each simulation .",
    "the large variation in the mass flux is due to the turbulent nature of the gas passing though the flux surface and the dense cloudlets immersed within this gas .",
    "the cloudlets pass through the surface at different times resulting in fluctuations in the mass flux .",
    "there is a general trend of increasing mass flux with the resolution of the simulation .",
    "this trend can be explained by the increase in fragmentation of the cloud with increasing numerical resolution .",

    "the increase in the fragmentation of the cloud with resolution can clearly be seen , and will be discussed in more detail in   [ fragment ] .",
    "at the highest resolution attempted in this study ( 0.1 pc ) , the filaments resemble a `` foam '' of cloudlets , while at low resolution the cloud has been broken - up into only a few large fragments . as a consequence , the cross - section of dense material that passes through the flux surface at any given time after 0.4 myr is larger in the higher resolution simulations .    the total integrated mass flux passing through the surface at @xmath85 over the first 0.7 myr also increases with numerical resolution ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mass_flux ] ; right panel ) .",
    "again this is caused by the larger degree of fragmentation at high resolution , resulting in more ablation of cloud material from the back of the cloud . between our highest and lowest resolution simulations",
    "the difference in mass flux is approximately 10% .",
    "this discrepancy is likely to increase at higher resolutions , although it is possible that convergence may occur at extremely high resolution simulations ( @xmath86 ) that utilize an adaptive mesh .",
    "for the 2 pc per cell width resolution of our global simulations in paper i , this error is increased to approximately 20% .",
    "we will discuss the impact of the numerical resolution on the results of paper i in   [ sb_winds ] .",
    "the most significant effect of increasing the numerical resolution of the simulation is the increase in fragmentation of the cloud .",
    "the increase in cloud fragmentation can clearly be seen in figure [ fig : res_dens ] , with the the cloud broken into only a few large fragments in the lowest resolution simulations , but 100 s of fragments at higher resolution .",
    "nevertheless , filamentary structure , where the concentration of cloudlets is higher , can still be made out at high resolution .",
    "these `` filaments '' are located in similar positions to the filaments in the low resolution simulations .",
    "we are able to calculate the properties of each cloudlet by using an algorithm which allows us to pick out and select fragments .",

    "the massive fragments ( @xmath88 ) present at all resolutions are the remnants of the cloud core . since the number of cloudlets increases with resolution , the highest resolution simulations are comprised of numerous low mass cloudlets . in general , there is a trend towards increasing smaller mass fragments at all resolutions .",
    "however , in all cases , the majority of mass of the cloudlet system is found in the massive fragments ( @xmath89 40  % ) rather than the smaller fragments .",
    "the velocity of the cloudlets does not vary significantly with resolution . despite the large number of lower mass fragments present in the high resolution simulations , they still fall within the velocity range of @xmath90 .",
    "the bulk of the cloudlets at all resolutions have a velocity in the range of @xmath91 .",
    "this is likely to increase as the evolution progresses and the cloudlets are further accelerated by the wind .    unfortunately , we are unable to fully resolve the interaction of a radiative cloud with a supersonic wind at this time .",
    "this limits our ability to draw any reliable conclusions regarding the small scale evolution of the wind / cloud interaction . a significant increase in numerical resolution and/or the use of an adaptive mesh",
    "would be required in order for convergence to possibly occur .",
    "nevertheless , there is a clear trend in the large - scale evolution of the wind / cloud interaction at all resolutions considered in this study , allowing us to draw some physical conclusions .",
    "for example , the soft x - ray luminosity is sufficiently resolved and is almost constant with numerical resolution ( see   [ xray ] ) .",
    "the effect of radiation in keeping the cloud cool , suppressing the transverse expansion and minimizing the effect of the kelvin - helmholtz instability , is also not effected by the resolution of the simulation . in all cases ,",
    "the cloud is not immediately destroyed and mixed into the hot wind as seen in adiabatic models , but is instead broken - up into numerous small cloudlets .",
    "the major effect of increasing the resolution is the increased fragmentation of the cloud .",
    "however , we still see the same qualitative structure at high resolution , with the cloud breaking - up to form a filamentary structure that becomes finer and finer as more detail is resolved .",
    "at optical wavelengths ( such as h@xmath0 ) , starburst - driven winds appear as spectacular filamentary systems extending several kpc along the minor axis of the host galaxy , e.g. m82 @xcite , ngc 3079 @xcite , ngc 1569 @xcite . while it has long been proposed that this filamentary material was expelled from the central region of the galaxy @xcite , until now the mechanism behind the formation of the filaments has not been completely understood . in paper",
    "i , we proposed that the filaments were formed via clouds of disk gas that are broken - up and accelerated into the outflow by the ram - pressure of the wind . in order for this mechanism to be viable ,",

    "we note that as photoionization is not included in our model , the h@xmath0 emission discussed in this paper arises solely from shock ionization .",
    "however , photoionization is known to play a role in the ionization of the filaments in many winds .",
    "for example , the filaments in m82 s wind are known to be photoionized at low distances above and below the galactic plane , with shock ionization becoming dominant at large distances .",

    "it can be immediately seen in figure [ fig : halpha ] that the h@xmath0 emitting material corresponds to the dense cloud material .",
    "thus , the survival mechanism for a cloud proposed in   [ survival ] can be invoked to explain the filaments observed in starburst - driven winds .    as discussed in ",

    "the majority of the h@xmath0 emission has velocities in the range of @xmath93 , with the velocity increasing with distance along the z - axis .",
    "this is consistent with the h@xmath0 gas reaching higher velocities at larger distances above the galaxy plane , which was observed in the global simulations in paper i. note that this result represents only the velocity dispersion at the base of a _ single _ filament early in its evolution , with the velocity likely to increase as the cloudlets , which form the filament , are further accelerated in the direction of the flow .    as in our global simulations",
    ", we again find that it is the ram - pressure of the wind that accelerates the clouds .",

    "[ fig : mass_flux ] , the difference in the mass flux at each resolution is a result of the increasing fragmentation of the h@xmath0 emitting clouds at high resolution .",
    "the right hand panel of figure [ fig : ha_mass_flux ] shows the total integrated mass flux , over the first 0.7 myr , of the h@xmath0 emitting gas as a function of resolution .",
    "we see an increase in the total mass passing through the flux surface , again caused by the increase in fragmentation as the kelvin - helmholtz instability is further resolved . even at the high resolution of these simulations",
    "the h@xmath0 mass flux is yet to converge .    in   [ survival ]",
    "we discussed how a cloud could survive the interaction with a hot supersonic wind .",
    "the ability of a cloud to radiate heat is crucial for the clouds survival , allowing it to remain stable to ablation and emit at h@xmath0 temperatures . without this ability , the cloud quickly heats above @xmath94 , expands and becomes susceptible to the kelvin - helmholtz instability .",
    "while a radiative cloud is still disrupted , the small sized fragments that are broken off the main cloud have cooling times faster than the cloud crushing time and the kelvin - helmholtz growth rate , and thus , may possibly survive . in the adiabatic case ,",
    "the fragments get heated and destroyed , with the cloud material quickly becoming mixed into the hot wind . if the fragments survive , they are drawn - out into strands and form a filament downstream of the original cloud position , reminiscent of the filaments seen in starburst - driven winds .      in paper",
    "i we proposed four mechanisms that could give rise to the soft x - ray emission that is observed to be spatially correlated to the h@xmath0 emitting filaments .",
    "this correlation has been observed by _",
    "chandra _ in many starburst - driven winds ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "here we summarize the proposed mechanisms :    1 .",
    "the mass - loaded wind .",
    "this is the largest contributor to the soft x - ray emission in the global simulations . as mass",
    "is ablated from the clouds it is mixed into the surrounding turbulent gas , creating a region of hot ( @xmath95 ) rapidly cooling gas that emits strongly at soft x - ray energies .",
    "2 .   the intermediate temperature interface between the hot wind and cool filaments .",
    "gas at the boundary between the hot and cool gas mixes to produce a thin region of intermediate density and temperature . like the mass - loaded wind",
    ", this mixed gas is a strong emitter of soft x - rays .",
    "3 .   bow shocks .",
    "gas is heated to x - ray temperatures as a bow shock is formed upstream of dense clouds accelerated into the flow .",
    "4 .   colliding bow shocks .",
    "when two bow shocks interact , the gas is further shock heated to x - ray temperatures .",
    "the first two processes involve the mixing of hot and cold gas and could be the result of numerical diffusion in the simulations and therefore not physical .",
    "our resolution study allows has to examine the effect of increasing resolution on the soft x - ray emission and determine the realism of the above possible emission processes .    as in paper",
    "i , we infer the x - ray luminosity in the soft ( 0.5 - 2.0 kev ) energy band using broadband cooling fractions obtained from the mappings iiir code @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : xray ] shows the soft x - ray emissivity in models rf128 ( left ) and rf512 ( right ) at 0.3 , 0.5 , and 0.7 myr epochs . the strongest x - ray emitter in both models is the bow shock that immediately forms upstream of the cloud as it interacts with the wind .",
    "regions where bow shocks are interacting result in the highest x - ray emissivities .",
    "apart from a few marginally bright tails coming off some of the cloudlets , particularly in model rf128 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : xray ] ; bottom left panels ) , we see no evidence that mass - loading of the wind by ablation from the cloud is a significant contributor to the soft x - ray luminosity .",
    "we also see very little evidence that the intermediate temperature interface plays a significant role .",
    "there are a few bright regions upstream of cloudlets that have been exposed to the wind .",
    "however , it is likely that this enhanced emission is related to the x - ray emitting bow shocks that have formed around each cloudlet .    the main difference between the simulations shown in figure [ fig : xray ] at high ( right panel ) and low ( left panel ) resolution is in the structure of the main bow shock and the emission from the cloudlets .",
    "while we observe some structure in the low resolution simulations , as the resolution is increased we see clear regions where colliding bow shocks lead to a significant increase in the x - ray emissivity .",
    "this is more evident at later times when the main cloud has fragmented and there are many x - ray emitting bow shocks upstream of the resulting cloudlets ( fig .",
    "[ fig : xray ] ; bottom right panels ) .",
    "it might be expected than that the increase in fragmentation at higher resolutions would lead to an increase in the x - ray luminosity as more bow shocks are formed . however , the majority of the cloudlets formed are sheltered from the impacting wind by the main cloud and do not form a bow shock .",
    "thus , they are not seen at soft x - ray energies and do not contribute to the x - ray luminosity ( fig .",
    "[ fig : xray ] ; right panels ) .    indeed",
    ", the soft x - ray luminosity hardly varies with resolution .",
    "figure [ fig : xray_lum ] shows the soft x - ray luminosity as a function of resolution for our radiative fractal cloud at 0.7 myr . at all resolutions , the luminosity is of the order of @xmath96 .",
    "this amount varies only negligibly from low to high resolution .",
    "this is a result of the strongest x - ray source being the main bow shock upstream of the original gas cloud , which is present at all resolutions .",
    "as discussed above , we see little evidence that the mass - loaded component of the wind , nor the intermediate temperature interface between the hot and cold gas plays a large role in the soft x - ray emission .",
    "while high resolution ( @xmath97 ) global simulations are needed in order to confirm this result , we conclude that bow shocks and their interaction are the main source of the soft x - ray emission in starburst - driven winds .",
    "the importance of radiative cooling in the formation and survival of the filaments was discussed in   [ survival ] .",
    "for our proposal of the formation of a filament , via the break - up and acceleration of cool disk gas into the wind , to be a viable mechanism , cooling must be present in the outflow .",
    "observations of the ovi emission line could be used to detect this cooling in the filaments .",
    "@xcite report the detection of o vi emission in the dwarf starburst galaxy ngc 1705 , which they associate with cooling in the outflow from gas at temperatures of @xmath98 .",
    "they propose turbulent mixing layers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as a possible origin for this emission .",
    "in order to determine were the ovi emission may arise in our simulations , we have produced a `` map '' of the predicted ovi emission in models rf384 , rs384 , af384 , and as384 at 0.7 myr ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ovi ] ) .",
    "we assume that the ovi emission in our simulations falls within the temperature range of @xmath99 .",
    "when cooling is neglected ( bottom two panels ) , ovi emission is only observed around the surviving cloud core .",
    "this emission is the result of the high degree of mixing of the hot and cold gas seen in the adiabatic simulations . in the radiative models ( top two panels ) ,",
    "ovi emission is observed throughout the flow and is closely aligned to the filamentary gas .",
    "this emission is caused by the mixing of hot and cold gas in the vicinity of each cool cloudlet that comprises the filament .",
    "the distribution of the ovi emission is most significant in the radiative fractal model ( rf384 ; top panel ) , where the structure of the filament can still be clearly seen .",
    "the emission weighted histogram of the z - velocity for this model at 0.7 myr is shown in the right hand panel of figure [ fig : vel ] .",
    "the velocity dispersion of the ovi gas is similar to that of the h@xmath0 emitting filaments , falling in the range of @xmath100 .",
    "while our investigation of the ovi emission is only preliminary , further detection of ovi kinematics similar to those proposed in this work would lend support the premise of cooling in the filaments of starburst winds .",
    "as discussed in   [ method ] , the simulations performed in this study and paper i do not include thermal conduction or magnetic fields . while an investigation into the role these phenomena play in the wind / cloud interaction is beyond the scope of this work , they may influence the evolution and survival of the filaments in starburst winds .",

    "the key difference to the evolution of a cloud in a simulation that neglects thermal conduction is that the cloud does not suffer hydrodynamical instabilities and fragment .",
    "this is because thermal conduction smooths the density and velocity gradients across the surface of the cloud , inhibiting the growth of instabilities ( also see * ? ? ?",

    "similar to @xcite , they found that thermal conduction inhibited the growth of hydrodynamical instabilities . in their simulations ,",
    "the structure of a cloud consists of a cool dense core surrounded by a `` corona '' of gas , dominated by thermal conduction , that gradually evaporates as the cloud evolves .",
    "the cloud does not fragment and there is significant mass loss through evaporation . in the case of the slower mach 30 shock , the dense core is unaffected by heat conduction and still fragments into multiple cloudlets .",
    "they also investigated the x - ray emission that would arise from their simulations @xcite .",
    "they found that for the slower shock , the soft x - ray emission arose in the thermally conducting corona , while the cold core would likely emit at optical wavelengths . in the case of the faster mach 50 shock , they suggest that there would be no optical component .    in this paper , we find that the soft x - ray emission arises primarily from the main bow shock upstream of the original cloud .",
    "the optically emitting filamentary gas originates from the cool cloudlets that are the remnants of this cloud .",
    "as the simulations of @xcite are the closest in initial conditions to our study , we use them as a basis for our supposition on the effect of thermal conduction on our results . most significantly , thermal conduction would likely act to inhibit the growth of the kelvin - helmholtz instability , which is responsible for the high degree of cloud fragmentation seen in our simulations . while the initial evolution of the cloud would be similar to that discussed in ",
    "[ evolution ] , the break - up of the cloud would likely be totally or partially suppressed .",

    "it is likely that our simulations would show a similar result .",

    "we conclude that thermal conduction may help the survival time of a radiative cloud overrun by a supersonic wind by stabilizing it against the destructive effect of the kelvin - helmholtz instability .",
    "while there will be less mixing of cloud material into the wind by hydrodynamical effects , there will still be significant mass loss from the cloud via evaporation .",

    "these studies have shown that the orientation of the magnetic field ( i.e. parallel , perpendicular , or oblique to the flow ) has a significant effect on the evolution of the cloud .",
    "for example , @xcite found that in the case of a strong oblique magnetic field , the cloud was actually pushed out of the central y=0 plane as it evolved .",
    "it has also been suggested that magnetic fields can help suppress the hydrodynamical instabilities that shred the cloud in a non - magnetized simulation @xcite , with less fragmentation occurring with increasing field strength .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite show that in a three - dimensional model , the growth of hydrodynamical instabilities can actually be accelerated by the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "it is widely thought that the presence of a magnetic field will act to suppress thermal conduction ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite suggest that the coefficient of thermal conductivity @xmath103 may be significantly reduced below the spitzer level in the presence of a magnetic field . to investigate how a reduced degree of conductivity may effect their results",
    ", they performed a number of simulations where @xmath103 was below the standard spitzer level @xmath104 .",
    "they found that at sub - spitzer levels , thermal conduction is not as efficient at suppressing the hydrodynamical instabilities that fragment the cloud .",
    "more recently , @xcite ran a series of two - dimensional axisymmetric simulations that included radiative cooling , thermal conduction , and magnetic fields .",
    "they showed that while thermal conduction was not completely suppressed in the presence of a magnetic field , regardless of the orientation of the field , the cloud would be broken up and destroyed by hydrodynamical instabilities .",
    "however , they also found that this effect was lessened in the case of a strong magnetic field .",
    "while clearly the interplay between thermal conduction and magnetic fields will influence the evolution and survival of the filaments in starburst winds , without detailed three - dimensional simulations ( with initial conditions appropriate to the problem ) that consider radiative cooling , thermal conduction and the complex nature of magnetic fields , it is difficult to hypothesize what effect the magnetic field would have on a filament s formation and survival . nevertheless , a filamentary structure is still likely to be formed by the wind / cloud interaction , with the most significant difference being in the number of cloudlets that comprise the filament .",
    "we do not anticipate that there would be a large effect to the h@xmath0 , soft x - ray , and ovi emission processes discussed in ",

    "we have performed a series of three - dimensional simulations of the interaction of a supersonic wind with a radiative cloud .",
    "we consider two different cloud geometries ( i.e. fractal and spherical ) , which enable us to investigate the impact of the initial shape and structure of the cloud on its subsequent evolution .",
    "this work was motivated by the simulations of the formation of a starburst - driven galactic wind in a inhomogeneous interstellar medium , reported in paper i. the aim of this work is to investigate the possible survival mechanism of a cloud accelerated by a hot freely expanding wind .",
    "we also set out to determine the effect of the numerical resolution of the evolution of the cloud and the implied soft x - ray emission associated with the interaction .",
    "the results of this study are as follows :    1 .",
    "both the initial geometry and the density distribution of the cloud significantly affect its evolution . a cloud which has a more inhomogeneous distribution of density fragments more than a cloud with a more uniform structure ( e.g. a sphere ) .",
    "the wind more rapidly breaks the cloud apart in regions where it encounters the least density .",
    "2 .   a radiative cloud survives longer than an identical adiabatic cloud .",
    "this is a result of the lower degree of heating in the radiative cloud , which suppresses the transverse expansion seen in the adiabatic case .",
    "the radiative cloud experiences a lower degree of acceleration and has a higher relative mach number to the flow , diminishing the destructive effect of the kelvin - helmholtz instability .",
    "3 .   the number of fragments formed by the break - up of the cloud increases as a power law with increasing numerical resolution .",
    "this is a direct result of further resolving the kelvin - helmholtz instability , which grows more quickly at shorter wavelengths .",
    "the number of fragments formed increases down to the resolution of the simulation and will not converge .",
    "4 .   the calculated mass flux increases with numerical resolution .",
    "this is due to the turbulent nature of the stream and the increasing fragmentation of the cloud .",
    "high ( @xmath105 ) resolution and an adaptive mesh would be required for convergence to possibly occur .",
    "5 .   a radiative cloud fragments into numerous cool , small dense cloudlets .",
    "these cloudlets are entrained into the turbulent flow , forming an overall filamentary structure , with regions where the concentration of cloudlets is higher .",
    "the velocity of the cloudlets at 0.7 myr falls in the range of @xmath90 irrespective of resolution .",
    "the filamentary structure that is formed and the range of velocities found are in good agreement with optical observations of starburst - driven winds .",
    "thus , we confirm our conclusion from paper i , that h@xmath0 emitting filaments can be formed from clouds accelerated into a supersonic wind by the ram - pressure of the wind .",
    "there is little variation in the estimated soft x - ray luminosity of the radiative fractal cloud at all numerical resolutions considered , indicating that the x - ray emission is well resolved .",
    "soft x - ray emission arises primarily from the main bow shock , produced in the initial interaction , and from bow shocks produced upstream of fragments that are directly exposed to the wind .",
    "regions where these bow shock interact are strong x - ray emitters .",
    "we see little evidence that the mixing of hot and cold gas ( e.g. mass - loading and the boundary between the cool cloud material and the hot wind ) , contribute significantly to the x - ray emission . 9 .",
    "the ovi emission arises is the same vicinity as the h@xmath0 emission and has comparable emission weighted velocities , suggesting that the detection of ovi in an outflow may be indicative of cooling in the filaments .",
    "the ability for a cloud to radiate heat is crucial for it to survive immersed inside a hot , turbulent , supersonic wind . while effects such as thermal conduction and magnetic fields will have an effect on the clouds survival , without radiative cooling the cloud",
    "is quickly destroyed by the kelvin - helmholtz instability , with the cloud s material completely mixed into the surrounding stream .",
    "thus , for a model of the wind / cloud interaction to be realistic , radiative cooling certainly can not be neglected .    through the results of this work and paper i",
    ", we have shown that an optically emitting filament is easily formed via the interaction of a cool , dense cloud and a hot , tenuous supersonic wind under the conditions typically found in a starburst wind .",
    "we also find soft x - ray emission that has a natural spatial relationship to the filamentary gas .",
    "a relationship also seen in chandra observations of these winds .",
    "clearly , the multiphase nature of the interstellar medium is crucial for the formation of the filaments in starburst winds and can help explain much of the optical and soft x - ray emission detected in these complex objects ."
