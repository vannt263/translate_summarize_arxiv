    "gliding assays , also known as motility assays , represent the oldest in vitro technique to study motor proteins @xcite .",
    "they consist of attaching motors ( like myosins or kinesins ) with their tails to a glass surface and adding the filaments ( actin or microtubules ) .",
    "the motors will then pull the filaments and make them glide over the surface ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1]a ) .",
    "gliding assays are the most convenient way of testing motors for their functionality , measuring their speed in the absence of load and for testing their processivity .",
    "several experimental and theoretical studies were dealing with the pathways of such filaments in the two - dimensional plane @xcite .",
    "interestingly , one group observed that gliding actin filaments move in a helical fashion @xcite . in a subsequent experiment the pitch of rotation was determined as about @xmath0 , although the applied optical detection method did not allow discrimination between left- and right - handed rotation @xcite .",
    "helical motion of myosin motors has been very important in a somewhat different context .",
    "the processive motor myosin v has an average step size that is close , but not precisely equal to the actin periodicity .",
    "the helical motion of a motor around the actin filament therefore presents a very accurate way of measuring the difference between its step size and the filament pitch .",
    "ali and coworkers have observed that myosin v walks on an actin filament along a left - handed helix with a pitch of @xmath1 @xcite and thus has a step size slightly shorter than the actin half - pitch ( for a discussion of the myosin v step size see @xcite ) .",
    "myosin vi , despite having a shorter lever arm than myosin v , showed either straight walking , or , in @xmath2 of cases , a helical path with a pitch of @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "sun et al .",
    "@xcite confirmed this result , but also showed that the relatively straight motion contains a large amount of random wiggling .",
    "new experiments on myosin x also show a left - handed helical motion with a pitch that is somewhat shorter than that of myosin v and vi @xcite .    in a recent experimental study beausang and coworkers",
    "@xcite used polarized total internal reflection microscopy to study the twirling motion of actin filaments in gliding assays with processive myosin v and non - processive muscle myosin ( myosin ii ) . while the twirling of filaments driven by myosin v agreed with the helical movement of single molecules mentioned above , myosin ii interestingly showed a left - handed twirling motion as well .",
    "this result came as a surprise and the left - handed rotation is opposite from the observations by nishizaka et al .",
    "but they are not in direct contradiction , as they were obtained with quite different atp concentrations .",
    "while the pitch of the twirling motion is a direct measure for the step size of processive motors , its interpretation is more complicated with non - processive ones .",
    "they could clearly generate twirling motion if there was a lateral component of the power stroke .",
    "in fact , there exists indirect evidence for such an asymmetry in myosin v @xcite .",
    "however , we will show in this paper that there is another , more subtle , effect that can cause twirling motion of actin filaments in a gliding assay , even if the myosin heads exhibit no lateral motion .",
    "this effect stems from the fact that myosin heads can only bind to an actin filament in so called target zones , where the actin binding sites have approximately the right orientation ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1]d ) @xcite .",
    "when a target zone is approaching a myosin head , the latter is more likely to bind at the beginning of the target zone than at its end , because it is more likely that it is already bound by that time . in this paper",
    "we will show simulation results and develop an approximative theory to estimate the pitch of helical motion resulting from this effect . of course",
    ", we can not exclude that there are other contributions towards the helicity .",
    "but , because the rotation is relatively weak as compared with the longitudinal motion , these effects can easily be treated separately and the total rotation is simply their superposition .     and",

    "in order to concentrate on the effect of filament rotation , we define a model with simplified myosin kinetics , essentially containing a detached state , a bound pre - powerstroke state , a bound post - powerstroke state with adp and a bound rigor state . at the same time , we take into account the full helical structure of the actin filament .",
    "we propose an actin filament which can move in one direction and rotate around its axis .",
    "the position of the actin filament at a given time is therefore described with the coordinates @xmath13 . as follows from the helical structure of the actin filament , the @xmath14-coordinate of each bindings site is @xmath15 and its azimuth angle @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the rotation and @xmath18 the axial rise per subunit .",
    "the definition of the model is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "we assume that the myosin motors are distributed randomly directly under the gliding actin filament ( a discussion how this simplified , one - dimensional model follows from the full , 2-d model is given in the appendix ) .",
    "the motor numbered @xmath19 is anchored at position @xmath5 .",
    "the elastic energy cost of binding a head to the site @xmath6 consists of a longitudinal component with stiffness @xmath20 and and an angular component with stiffness @xmath21 and can be written as @xmath22 with @xmath23 chosen such that the angle @xmath24 falls into the interval @xmath25 $ ] .",

    "@xcite to fit binding rates of a single myosin head to the actin filament .",
    "they determined the value of the angular stiffness expressed with the dimensionless coefficient @xmath27 as @xmath28 .",
    "however , this value needs to be regarded as a lower estimate , as it might partially result from torsional compliance of the actin filament , rather than myosin heads .",
    "we therefore use three different values of @xmath29 and @xmath30 in the simulation . the angular contribution to the boltzmann factor for a set of binding sites",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] . for the longitudinal compliance",
    ", we use the value @xmath31 , somewhat below the stiffness of myosin heads in muscle , which is about @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "the lower stiffness reflects the additional compliance due to myosin tails and roughly corresponds to the value obtained with optical tweezers , @xmath33 @xcite .    .",
    "]    the force and the torque that a myosin head numbered @xmath19 , bound to site @xmath6 , exerts on the filament are @xmath34 here we introduced the displacement @xmath35 that has the value @xmath36 in the pre - powerstroke and @xmath11 in the post - powerstroke and rigor state .    the simplified model for the duty cycle of the myosin head is defined as follows . a head binds to an actin site with the rate @xmath37 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) .",
    "the power stroke ( a transition from @xmath38 do @xmath39 ) takes place with the rate @xmath8 .",
    "it is followed by the release of adp with the rate @xmath9 .",
    "detachment follows after binding a new atp molecule , therefore its rate depends on the atp concentration , @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "we neglect the strain dependence of those rates , as well as the existence of the reverse transitions .",
    "it should be noted that in this formulation the model is not thermodynamically consistent .",
    "however , as we are only interested in dynamics at low loads , this does not significantly affect the results .",
    "we assume that the filament position is quickly equilibrated after each step , therefore it always fulfills @xmath41",
    "given the known structure of the actin helix and the power stroke size of myosin , our model essentially has two important parameters : the angular stiffness of myosin heads , @xmath21 , and the ratio between the detachment- and the attachment rate , @xmath42 .",
    "the latter is a function of the atp concentration and is closely related to the duty ratio of motors . for other parameters we use the values given in table  [ tab:1 ] .",
    "the power stroke , connected with the phosphate ( pi ) release , is assigned a very fast rate , @xmath43 , and can be considered as taking place immediately after binding . the maximum attachment rate @xmath44 , i.e.",
    ", the attachment rate to sites that do not require any elastic distortion , can be estimated as @xmath45 .",
    "this reflects the estimated average attachment rate of @xmath46 , or a maximum atp turnover rate of @xmath47 in muscle @xcite .",
    "the adp release takes place with the rate @xmath48 , characteristic for the fast myosin isoform @xcite . for the detachment rate , which is determined by the atp binding rate , we use @xmath49 @xcite .    .simulation parameters [ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]     in the stationary state , the filament moves with velocity @xmath50 and rotates with angular velocity @xmath51 . from eq .",

    "this is the apparent velocity with which the helix moves along the surface .",
    "we can now set up a master equation for the probability that a motor positioned at @xmath14 is in the attached state @xmath53 and set @xmath54 to obtain the stationary solution .",
    "@xmath55 also has to fulfill the periodic boundary condition @xmath56 the expectation value of the attachment position can be calculated as @xmath57 and the average strain at the time of attachment follows from ( [ eq:11 ] ) : @xmath58 because the strain on a motor changes with time as @xmath59 , the average strain of all bound motors is @xmath60 .",
    "the force per motor is then @xmath61 . as the total force produced by all motors has to be zero ,",
    "we obtain an expression for the velocity @xmath62 the same type of calculation as for the velocity can be made for the angular velocity .",
    "motors attach with an average angle @xmath63 . as the filament rotates , their angle changes as @xmath64 .",
    "the average angle of all motors is @xmath65 and needs to be zero because of torque balance , therefore @xmath66 these equations , together with the master equation ( [ eq:13 ] ) , the periodic boundary condition ( [ eq:14 ] ) , the expression for @xmath67 ( [ eq:16 ] ) and for @xmath68 ( [ eq:7 ] ) allow us to numerically determine the velocity @xmath69 and the distribution of attached heads @xmath70 in a self - consistent manner .",

    "( circles ) .",
    "the top panel shows data for the angular stiffness @xmath76 , the middle @xmath82 and the bottom @xmath83 .",
    "the minor deviation is mainly due to the extrapolations we made in regions between target zones .",
    "the agreement is better for large @xmath84 values , where target zones become more localized . ]",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] and compared with simulation data from fig .  [ fig:3 ] .",
    "the simulation results are well reproduced , although there is a certain discrepancy which is more pronounced for low values of the angular stiffness @xmath84 .",
    "the main reason for this discrepancy is the extrapolation beyond the boundaries of one period , which was used in the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ eq:10 ] ) .",
    "other ( minor ) sources of deviation are the neglected discrete nature of binding sites and of the fact that each binding site can only be occupied by one head at a time .",
    "in this study we have demonstrated that the helical actin structure , along with the fact that myosin heads preferentially bind to those sites oriented towards them , is sufficient to explain left - handed rotation in a gliding assay .",
    "the maximum twirling motion is achieved at relatively low speeds ( below @xmath85 ) .",
    "twirling is reduced with higher speeds , achieved at higher atp concentrations .",
    "interestingly , it is also reduced under extremely low atp concentrations , when the velocity drops under @xmath86 . however , in this regime the results depend strongly on the choice of the angular stiffness @xmath84 , which is less well known .",
    "the minimum pitch resulting from this effect lies in the order of @xmath87@xmath88 , which is in good agreement with recent experimental results @xcite .",
    "the model also makes a testable prediction that the pitch should increase with a higher atp concentration . because pitch only depends on the ratio between the attachment and detachment rate , addition of adp should have the same effect on the pitch as a reduced atp concentration that yields the same filament speed .",
    "if this turns out not to be the case , it will be a strong indication of a lateral conformational change in the myosin head connected with the release of adp .    although the qualitative aspects of our theory are generic and practically independent of any assumptions other than the helical actin structure , there are alternative effects that could well contribute to the twirling motion .",
    "one such possibility is that the power - stroke of the myosin head contains a lateral ( azimuthal , off - axis ) component .",
    "a similar effect could also result from an asymmetric attachment rate , which could cause the attached motors to exert a certain torque on the filament immediately after binding .",
    "such a torque does not contradict the laws of thermodynamics because the first bound state is not in equilibrium with the detached state .",
    "a related idea is described by beausang et al .",
    "@xcite as the `` rigor drag model '' in which heads in the rigor state exert a torque in the opposite direction from that immediately after binding .",
    "this results in a pitch that depends on the fraction of time spent in the rigor state .",
    "the important difference between the two concepts is that in our model the torque generated by newly attached myosin heads depends on the atp concentration , whereas in the rigor drag model this torque is constant and the variable pitch is caused by different dwell times in different states .    in any case both the effect described here and the explicit lateral component of the power stroke will be superimposed .",
    "so it is theoretically possible , even though the proposition is purely speculative at the moment , that the power stroke might have the opposite helicity , i.e. , it would lead to a right - handed filament rotation .",
    "in such a case , there could be a cross - over form right handed motion under high atp concentrations , to left - handed under low .",
    "this is could be one possibility to reconcile the recent results @xcite with those by nishizaka et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "recent experiments also revealed rotation of microtubules moved by monomeric kinesin-1 @xcite and eg5 @xcite .",
    "the theory we presented in this paper is not applicable to microtubules , because they have no distinct target zones .",
    "any rotation resulting from an effect of the kind we describe here would be negligible .",
    "therefore , as suggested in @xcite , the rotation caused by kinesins has to result from a lateral ( off - axis ) component of a power stroke , or from an asymmetry in the binding rate .",
    "in the following we will discuss how the simplified model , which assumes that motors are distributed one - dimensionally underneath the actin filament , and which we use throughout the main text , relates to the full two - dimensional model . in the 2-d model , which describes the actual situation in a gliding assay , myosin heads are distributed all over the glass surface and their positions are described with two coordinates , @xmath89 .",
    "the position of the actin filament is described with the coordinates @xmath90 and the angle @xmath4 .",
    "we assume that the filament keeps its direction parallel to the @xmath91-axis .",
    "the elastic distortion of the head @xmath19 binding to the site @xmath6 can then be written as @xmath92 where @xmath93 is an unknown function of the azimuth angle of binding site @xmath6 and of the lateral position of the filament relative to the motor .    the total binding rate to site @xmath6 of all motors located at longitudinal position",
    "@xmath94 is then @xmath95 \\\\",
    "\\times \\rho d(x_m , y_m ) dy_m\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath96 is the 2-d surface density of myosin motors and @xmath97 the probability that a motor at that position is in the detached state . if we assume that @xmath98 , i.e. , that the distribution of unbound heads is symmetric with respect to the filament , the resulting function @xmath99 has to be symmetric in @xmath100 .",
    "we can therefore approximate it with the expression used in eqs .",
    "( [ eq:1],[eq:2 ] ) .    the average torque generated by a head that binds to site @xmath6 can be calculated as @xmath101 this second expression is equivalent to that in the 1-d model .",
    "the average force generated by a head that binds to site @xmath6 is determined the same way : @xmath102 if @xmath97 is independent of @xmath103 , or , more generally , if it has a dependence that can be written as a function of @xmath104 , the integral in the numerator is 0 and there is no lateral force .",
    "however , with different distributions @xmath97 , a small lateral force is possible , so that the filament could show some sideways motion in the 2-d model . while the torque results from a @xmath97 which is asymmetric in @xmath94 , a lateral force needs asymmetry in both coordinates and is therefore a higher - order effect .",
