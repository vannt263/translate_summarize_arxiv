    "@xcite have argued from schwinger - dyson equations and on general grounds that the decay constants of the excited light @xmath2 mesons should be suppressed relative to the pion decay constant .",
    "the decay constant of the first excited pion has also been found to be small in  @xcite . in table  [ tab : excitedpionresults ] we summarise the values for the decay constant of the first excited pion from various models .",
    "the predictions from these models for @xmath3 are indeed remarkably small . when we first heard about the result that the decay constant of the excited light pseudo - scalar could be as small a tenth of the pion decay constant , our first reaction was a combination of `` that is remarkable '' and `` unbelievable '' . in this letter",
    "we check these predictions using lattice qcd .    experimentally , the second lightest meson with @xmath2 quantum numbers , made out of light quarks , is the @xmath4 . in our lattice calculation",
    "we use the notation @xmath0 for the first excited light pseudo - scalar meson .    from a ( naive )",
    "quark model perspective it is surprising for the @xmath0 to have a highly suppressed decay constant .",
    "we define highly suppressed to be that the decay constant is less than 10 % of the pion decay constant . in the naive quark model",
    "the leptonic decay constant for s - wave states is proportional to the wave - function at the origin .",
    "the wave function of the excited @xmath2 state would be smaller than the ground state , because the wave - function is more spread out than for the ground state .",
    "however , there is no obvious reason for a dramatic suppression of the decay constant .",
    "it is instructive to consider the decay constants of mesons with heavy quarks .",
    "lakhina and swanson  @xcite have recently computed the leptonic decay constant of mesons in the charmonium and bottonium systems and compared their values against experiment and lattice gauge theory .",
    "for example , lakhina and swanson  @xcite get good agreement from their model and the experimental results for the leptonic decay constants of the @xmath5 ( @xmath6 mev ) and @xmath7 ( @xmath8 mev ) mesons .",
    "the same decay constants have also been computed by dudek et al .",
    "@xcite from quenched lattice qcd .",
    "this type of modest suppression of the value for the decay constant of the excited meson relative to the decay constant of the ground state agrees with our ( perhaps simple minded ) intuition    below is `` simplistic '' theoretical argument for the suppression of the decay constant of excited light pseudo - scalars consider the axial current applied to the meson @xmath9 ( here applied to mesons with @xmath10 ) .",
    "the decay constant ( @xmath11 ) of the state @xmath9 is defined by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the axial current .",
    "the partial conservation of the axial current  @xcite is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the interpolating operator for pion states ( pseudo - scalar density ) and @xmath16 is the quark mass",
    ". equation  [ eq : partialaa ] is an operator relation , hence is true between any states .",
    "this allows us to write : @xmath17 for the lightest pseudo - scalar @xmath18 so @xmath19 is non - zero in the chiral limit . for a meson that is not a goldstone state",
    ", @xmath20 is non - zero in the chiral limit , hence @xmath11 will vanish in the chiral limit .    in the past ,",
    "corrections to equation  [ eq : partialaa ] from excited pion states  @xcite have been considered for corrections to the goldberger - trieman relation .",
    "for example  @xcite introduced extended pcac @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the interpolating operator for the n - th excited light @xmath2 meson .    the pdg  @xcite quotes the mass of the @xmath4 as @xmath23 mev with a decay width of between 200 to 600 mev .",
    "the predominant decay mode is to @xmath24 ( this includes @xmath25 ) .",
    "there is readable discussion about the experimental issues with the @xmath4 state in  @xcite .",
    "diehl and hiller  @xcite estimate the leptonic decay constant of the @xmath4 to be less than 8.4 mev from the experimental bounds on the decay of the @xmath26 to @xmath27 from cleo  @xcite .",
    "the mass of the @xmath4 meson has been studied before using lattice qcd .",
    "some quenched studies show reasonable agreement with experiment  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath4 decays via the strong interaction , so quenched calculations would not be expected to be so accurate for this state . using the maximum entropy method the cp - pacs collaboration obtained the mass of the first excited pion to be 660(590 )  mev in the continuum limit of quenched qcd  @xcite .",
    "the cp - pacs collaboration  @xcite also computed the leptonic decay constant for the first excited @xmath28 meson .",
    "the ratio of the leptonic decay constant of the excited to ground rho meson , obtained by cp - pacs  @xcite was 0.41 .",
    "this is modest in accord with our quark model intuition .",
    "the unquenched lattice qcd calculation by the milc collaboration , using improved staggered quarks , obtained the first excited pseudo - scalar to be at the mass 1362(41)(205 ) mev  @xcite .    .",
    "summary of the values of the @xmath0 decay constant determined from models and sum rules .",
    "our normalisation convention is @xmath19 = 131 mev . [",
    "cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : excitedpionourresults ]    in figure  [ fig : ratio ] we plot the ratio of the ratio of the decay constants of the @xmath15 and @xmath29 meson , using the unimproved and improved decay constants from the alpha formulation . on the x - axis we use the square of the pion mass in units of @xmath30 .",
    "the value of @xmath30 is not needed for our final result , but a value of @xmath30 around 0.5 fm with 10% errors can be used if required  @xcite .",
    "the unimproved decay constant has only a modest suppression of @xmath3 relative to @xmath31 .",
    "the value of @xmath3 obtained from the improved alpha formulation is very much suppressed relative to @xmath31 . in the continuum limit",
    "the improved and un - improved decay constants should agree .",
    "however , at the fixed lattice spacing that we use here , the improved decay constant should be close to the continuum limit value of the decay constant because the @xmath32 errors have been removed .",
    "a simple linear fit to the ratio of decay constants with improvement gives @xmath1 = 0.078(93 ) in the chiral limit .",
    "the data at @xmath33 is important to in producing a smaller extrapolated ratio of decay constants .",
    "a simple linear extrapolation of the two heavier points gives @xmath1 = 0.16 .",
    "for the unimproved decay constants , we obtain @xmath1 = 0.38(11 ) in the chiral limit . the modest suppression of the @xmath3 decay constant when",
    "no improvement factors are used is consistent with the effective plots of the axial to pseudo - scalar channel looking similar to the pseudo - scalar to pseudo - scalar channel in figure  [ fig : meff ] .",
    "although figure  [ fig : ratio ] could be viewed as a triumph of alpha s program of non - perturbative renormalisation , a controlled continuum extrapolation is required for a definitive result .",
    "perhaps it is not so surprising that the full alpha formulation is required to see the suppression of the decay constant , because the pcac relation is at the heart of the conditions imposed for improvement ( determining coefficients of irrelevant operators )  @xcite .",
    "the increased suppression of the excited pion decay constant , from the improved current , is caused by the relatively large non - perturbative value of the coefficient of @xmath34 and the size of @xmath35 . in quenched qcd at @xmath36 , with a similar lattice spacing to the one used here , the value of @xmath34 was controversial with different methods giving different results  @xcite .",
    "the alpha collaboration recommends that their formulation is used in a consistent continuum extrapolation ( `` working at constant physics '' )  @xcite .",
    "also , there could be excited state contamination in the coupling @xmath35 , that increases its value . to check the excited state contamination",
    "requires a larger variational basis .    in the original paper",
    "the ukqcd collaboration noted that the excited state masses were very close to the mass of three pions  @xcite .",
    "it is not clear to us what we would expect for an axial current insertion into a three pion state . if we do a linear extrapolation of the masses of the @xmath0 meson versus the square of the pion mass in units of @xmath30 we obtain in the chiral limit : @xmath37 = @xmath38 mev ( using a nominal value of @xmath30 = 0.5 fm ) .",
    "although the consistency of the extrapolated mass ( within the large errors ) with the mass of the @xmath4 state is good , it will be more interesting in future studies to monitor the effect of the three pion decay on the state .",
    "we have investigated the leptonic decay constant of the first excited pseudo - scalar meson .",
    "although our results are consistent with @xmath3 , being much smaller than @xmath31 , a definitive lattice qcd calculation requires a continuum extrapolation .",
    "recent algorithmic improvements have rescued wilson / clover lattice calculations from being too computationally expensive with light quark masses , hence it is now possible to repeat this calculation with more than one lattice spacing and lighter quarks  @xcite .",
    "the suppression of the excited light pseudo - scalars may have implications for the proposed restoration of chiral symmetry for highly excited hadrons , suggested by glozman  @xcite .",
    "if the leptonic decay constant of the excited pseudo - scalar mesons are suppressed , then the leptonic decay constant of the parity partners of the pseudo - scalar mesons should also be suppressed .",
    "although , unfortunately , lattice qcd is not ideally suited to studying highly excited mesons , the study of the suppression of the decay constant of the first excited light pseudo - scalar is an interesting first step .",
    "note that even if lattice qcd can not be used to study the proposed restoration of chiral symmetry in the excited hadron spectrum , it may be able to study the proposed `` restoration of chiral symmetry '' via the eigenvalue spectrum  @xcite .",
    "following narison  @xcite , in  @xcite we argued that for the light @xmath39 state a small value for the leptonic decay constant would be a signal for a molecular state .",
    "this seems an unlikely interpretation for the smallness of the decay constant of the @xmath0 meson  @xcite .",
    "the suppression of @xmath3 is a useful `` benchmark '' that can be used to tune and validate lattice qcd techniques that try to determine the properties of excited states mesons .",
    "it is particularly interesting , because it is a consequence of chiral symmetry .",
    "holl et al .",
    "@xcite also have predictions for the sign of the decay constant of the @xmath0 meson that may also be studied using lattice qcd .",
