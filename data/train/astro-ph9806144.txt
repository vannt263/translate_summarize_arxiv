    "extra - solar planets ( mayor & queloz 1995 , marcy & butler 1996 ) can , in principle , be seen in ground - based images using the light cancellation in dark speckles to remove the halo of star light ( labeyrie 1995 ) .",
    "long - exposures with high - performance adaptive optics and a correction of the seeing - induced shadow pattern on the telescope s pupil are also proposed by angel ( 1994 ) .",
    "a less extreme atmospheric correction is needed with the dark - speckle method .",
    "both methods are expected to reach the @xmath1 relative intensity needed to detect a jupiter - like planet near its parent star . related space - based techniques are also considered ( @xcite , @xcite ) . in the longer term ,",
    "resolved images of detected exo - planets will in principle be obtainable even from the ground with long - baseline interferometric arrays ( @xcite ) .",
    "+ the `` dark - speckle '' method exploits the light cancellation effect occuring in random coherent fields according to the bose - einstein statistics .",
    "although adaptive optics can reconstruct the airy peak , and possibly the first few rings , in the focal image of a bright star , the degree of `` seeing '' correction which it provides can not be good enough to remove the fluctuating speckles in the surrounding zone of the airy pattern .",
    "coronagraphic devices ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , gay & rabbia 1996 , roddier & roddier 1997 ) can remove the steady and organized part of the straylight , i.e. the first few airy rings if they emerge from the boiling speckled halo , and even if they are burried but remain detectable with the dark speckle analysis .",
    "+ one is therefore left with the problem of extracting as much information as possible from this speckled halo .",
    "destructive interference in the star light occasionally causes a dark speckle to appear here and there .",
    "when this happens at the position of the planet s own faint airy peak , the darkening can not be as deep as elsewhere .",
    "the planet s airy peak , also restored by the adaptive optics , indeed has a rather stable intensity , which adds to the star s local intensity .",
    "the intensity histogram is therefore locally distorted , and suitable algorithms can display the local distorsions in the form of a cleaned image .",
    "the exposures must be shorter than the turbulence life time . with a large telescope and hours of integration , a planet ,",
    "typically @xmath2 times fainter than the parent star , is expected to become visible .",
    "to calculate the method s sensitivity in a more general way than done by labeyrie ( 1995 ) , we first follow his derivation to the point where he calculates the signal - to - noise ratio . + the different photon distribution from the star and the planet defines the signal - to - noise ratio @xmath3 , and according to the central limit theorem :    @xmath4=snr\\sqrt{np_*(0)}\\ ] ]    where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the probabilities to detect @xmath7 and @xmath8 photons originating respectively from the star and from the planet , per pixel in a short exposure , and where @xmath9 is the total number of short exposures . replacing the values of @xmath10 and @xmath11 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , we obtain : @xmath12 the calculation of signal to noise ratio given in labeyrie 1995 assumed @xmath13 , which is unnecessarily restrictive , and unrealistic in some of the cases of interest .",
    "as suggested by one of us ( rr ) , a more general analysis can be made under the assumption that @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "equation ( 2 ) then becomes : @xmath16 if @xmath17 is the number of pixels per speckles , thus : @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the number of photons per speckle in a short exposure , respectively for the planet and the star .",
    "+ the variables used in @xcite were : + @xmath21@xmath22 , @xmath23@xmath24@xmath25 and @xmath26 + where @xmath27 is the total integration time , @xmath28 the short exposure time , @xmath29 the star / planet brightness ratio , @xmath30 the gain of the adaptive optics or the ratio between the airy peak and the halo of speckles , @xmath31 the total number of photons per second detected from the star .",
    "+ it provides a new expression for the @xmath3 : @xmath32 the sampling @xmath17 should be fine enough to exploit the darkest parts of the dark speckles , for a given threshold of detection @xmath33 , linking the performance of the adaptive optics ( @xmath30 ) and the brightness ratio ( @xmath29 )",
    ". the intensity across a dark speckle may be coarsely modelled as a cosine function of the position @xmath34 by : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the mean intensity and @xmath37 the speckle size . the intersection between @xmath38 and the line @xmath39 gives @xmath40 , the size of the pixel over which the light is integrated .",
    "it limits the minimal measurable intensity @xmath41 ( with @xmath42 ) .",
    "a detailed calculation gives @xmath43@xmath44 .",
    "+ we can assume that @xmath45 .",
    "indeed , if @xmath46 is the intensity of the airy peak , @xmath47@xmath48@xmath24@xmath49@xmath24@xmath50 + we also assume in the following that a planet can be seen if its own intensity is higher than @xmath41 .",
    "+ now we are able to calculate a value of @xmath17 : @xmath51    recent numerical simulations ( @xcite ) have shown that @xmath52 should not exceed @xmath53 to retain a reasonable value of the sampling parameter @xmath17 .",
    "+ the recorded level is @xmath36 , but with dark speckles this residual level decreases to @xmath41 , where @xmath33 depends mainly on the adaptive optics performance .",
    "+ with the value of @xmath17 obtained , the @xmath3 expression becomes : @xmath54 solving for @xmath29 , leads to a third - degree equation : @xmath55 the cardan method gives a single positive solution from which we derive a final expression for the integration time .",
    "@xmath56 with the following values : @xmath57 ; @xmath58 ; @xmath59 ; @xmath60 ; @xmath61 ; @xmath62 ; @xmath63 and @xmath64 , we find @xmath65 hours of integration , i.e. @xmath66 more than the result given by labeyrie .",
    "+ angel s discussion ( 1994 ) of the long - exposure method leads him to the following expression : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the optimum short exposure time .",
    "using again the same values , eq.(11 ) gives a limiting brightness ratio of @xmath69 and the typical brightness ratio of @xmath2 would be reached in @xmath70 hours .",
    "the long - exposure approach would in principle be more sensitive if the adaptive optics and shadow pattern compensation could be made extremely good .",
    "it is however less sensitive with current levels of adaptive performance .",
    "+ in fact , the difference between the dark - speckle and direct - long - exposure methods is more subtle , and both work in different regimes .",
    "a critical value of the photon stellar flux ( @xmath71 ) can be easily calculated by equalizing eq.(10 ) and eq.(11 ) for the same value of the total integration time ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "it leads to a second degree equation in @xmath31 , with a single positive root : + @xmath72 therefore , if the photon flux is above @xmath71 , the dark - speckle method is more efficient than the long exposure and , below this limit the direct imaging is better .",
    "@xmath71 strongly depends on the adaptive optics .",
    "let us take a numerical exemple",
    ". if the goal is to reach a @xmath2 brightness ratio with a gain of @xmath73 and @xmath74 exposures , the photon flux must be higher than @xmath75 , which can be achieved with a large aperture and wide bandwidth ( @xmath76ph / s for @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath63 and 20% efficiency ) .",
    "however , for a space telescope with adaptive optics , the speckle lifetime is under control with values of the order of @xmath79 for exemple .",
    "thus , @xmath71 is decreased to @xmath80 , which is less restrictive .",
    "however , the telescope should not be so large as to provide a partially resolved image of the star , since it would fill - in the dark speckles .",
    "because the number of photon - events detected per pixel in each exposure is critical , these exposures should be as long as possible without degrading too much the darkness of the dark speckles .",
    "the optimal value is obviously shorter than the usual speckle lifetime considered by roddier , gilli & lund ( 1982 ) .",
    "a tentative lower limit can be estimated by linearly scaling the speckle lifetime in proportion to the dark speckle size defined by eq.(7 ) .",
    "it leads to impossibly short exposures for large @xmath29 values .",
    "however , since the adaptive optics decreases the wave disturbance , it increases markedly the speckle lifetime at positions close to the airy peak , depending upon the factor @xmath81 , where @xmath9 is the number of actuators across the pupil containing @xmath82 of them ( @xcite ) .",
    "the optimal exposure time is therefore dependant upon the adaptive optics performance .",
    ".brightness ratio and @xmath3 obtained with a photon - counting avalanche photodiode , for two values of the sampling parameter @xmath17 .",
    "the number of zero - photon events was counted on 250000 short exposures of @xmath83 , totalling @xmath84 of integration .",
    "the @xmath3 was calculated from eq.(1 ) . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     to assess the dark - speckle method we did a laboratory simulation using a single - pixel photon - counting detector , in the form of an avalanche photodiode .",
    "the star and planet were simulated by two he - ne lasers , with adjustable attenuators .",
    "a lyot - type coronagraph permitted to remove the star s airy peak and rings , thus decreasing the local halo intensity 10 to 15 times .",
    "artificial `` seeing '' was generated with a moving scatterer , selected to provide a strehl ratio approaching that typical of current adaptive optical systems .",
    "the equivalent peak / halo gain was @xmath85 .",
    "the flux of the central star was @xmath86 photons / s . calculating an histogram of the detected photon events",
    ", we determined the @xmath3 by comparing the number of zero - photon events with the planet turned on and off .",
    "as listed in table 1 , the results strongly depend on the sampling parameter @xmath17 .",
    "they are consistent with eq.(7 ) which gives the maximum brightness ratio ( @xmath87 ) theoretically reachable . in these laboratory tests ,",
    "the dark - speckle analysis outperforms the long exposure when the sampling exceeds @xmath88",
    "@xmath89 @xmath90 .    in this experiment",
    "the short exposure time ( @xmath83 ) is about 100 times shorter than the speckle lifetime ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "available photon counting camera do not yet allow quite as short exposure .",
    "+    we also used the cp40 photon - counting camera developed by foy and blazit ( @xcite ) .",
    "it has pixels of @xmath92 and a rather low saturation level of @xmath93 .",
    "each pixel has a lower dark noise than an avalanche photodiode , but a much slower response .",
    "we used the algorithm described in labeyrie ( 1995 ) , generating a `` dark map '' by counting , in each pixel , the number of @xmath74 exposures which contribute zero photon .",
    "as contributions from successive @xmath74 exposures are accumulated in the dark map , a planet s airy peak is expected to emerge as a black dot among background noise . to obtain the cleaned image ,",
    "results are displayed in positive form using , for example , an inverse square law . +",
    "the cp40 discriminates between events featuring zero photoelectron and those featuring one or more photoelectron / pixel / exposure .",
    "adding all exposures generates an image which brings out faint companions better than would a similarly long exposure on a ccd detector .",
    "+ the flux of the central star was @xmath94 photons / s , and the gain of the adaptive optics was about @xmath95 .",
    "the optical system operated at @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and the mask diameter was @xmath98 , i.e. it covered the central 2 rings of the airy pattern .",
    "the planet was located near the fifth ring of the diffraction pattern .",
    "+ figure 2 shows that a companion @xmath99 times fainter is well detected in 116 seconds .",
    "the @xmath3 measured on a speckle size region ( @xmath100 pixels ) is @xmath101 , while the dark - speckle model predict an @xmath3 of @xmath102 .",
    "this model does not take into account the halo shape which can explain the @xmath103 discrepancy .",
    "these initial results , where the companion is brighter than the halo , are very modest with respect to the performance expected at a later stage , but have provided useful insight for improving the instrument .",
    "+ currently , as seen in figs 2 and 3 , the detection sensitivity is limited by the presence of spurious blobs in the cleaned image .",
    "these are caused by static aberrations and coronagraphic mask effects .",
    "these residual blobs may be substracted from data obtained on a reference star .",
    "+ finally , dark - speckle data have been recorded at the 152 cm telescope of haute - provence , using , during a single night , the boa adaptive optics system ( @xcite ) developped by the office national detudes et de recherches arospatiales ( onera ) .",
    "this system , optimized for visible light , reaches a strehl ratio of about 0.4 at @xmath104 in long exposures and higher in short exposures .",
    "30 minutes of observation , with an interference filter centered at @xmath105 ( @xmath106 ) , evidenced the faint component of the spectroscopic binary hd144217 ( @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 ) . on the detector ,",
    "the flux from the primary was only @xmath110 photons / s .",
    "the angular separation is about @xmath111 with an uncertainty due to the mask offset .",
    "owing to the low elevation of the star , the adaptive optics gain was only @xmath112 .",
    "the @xmath3 measured on @xmath113 pixels is @xmath114 and allows to derive from eq.(10 ) a brightness ratio of @xmath115 , corresponding to a @xmath116 magnitude difference . on the long exposure synthesized from the same data ( 1 photon - events analysis ) the @xmath3 is very similar , but a direct imaging should give a @xmath3 of @xmath117 according to eq.(11 ) .",
    "however , a recent measurement of lunar - occultation ( @xcite ) gives @xmath118 .",
    "in this case , dark - speckle analysis should provide a very good detection with a @xmath3 of @xmath119 instead of @xmath114 .",
    "unfortunately , the hipparcos mission failed to detect the companion , probably because the hipparcos satellite is unable to achieve @xmath120 with small angular separation , which is consistent with our data .",
    "more observations are needed to verify the companion magnitude . + a continuing observing program is initiated .",
    "the simulations and tentative observations lead to the following remarks :    \\1 .",
    "one would like to sample as densely as possible to reach the bottom of the dark speckles , but there should be enough photons per pixel .",
    "the optimal sampling is therefore critical and we guess that it should be about 500 pixels per speckle area .",
    "the observations required a narrow - band filter since the diffraction and speckle pattern are color - dependant .",
    "the speckles are themselves dispersed radially . to increase the bandwidth usable in speckle interferometry ,",
    "wynne designed a chromatic lens with magnification inversely proportional to wavelength ( @xcite ) .",
    "d. kohler built a wynne corrector and we found it efficiently applicable to the present situation , where the speckle s wavelength dependance is more nearly a linear scaling .",
    "the resulting smearing of the planet s peak is acceptable if the spectral band remains less than 100 nm .",
    "different types of apodisation can be achieved , using a classical lyot coronagraph , the interference coronagraph of gay & rabbia ( 1996 ) , or the phase - mask coronagraph of roddier & roddier ( 1997 ) .",
    "both recent systems favor the detection of planets closer to the central star s airy peak .",
    "laboratory simulations with these varied devices are considered to compare their respective efficiencies . +",
    "our simulations verify the theoretical expressions given for the signal to noise ratio .",
    "the @xmath3 measured from the photon - number variance ( eq.(1 ) ) , is consistent with the @xmath3 expected from the model ( eq.(10 ) ) . in these preliminary tests",
    ", we had to use an interference filter and low saturation level camera which provides a weak signal .",
    "we were consequently unable to reach enough sensitivity for detecting extrasolar - planets or even brown - dwarf companions .",
    "+ the dark - speckle method is also applicable to space telescopes . even without turbulence ,",
    "optical defects create static speckles which can be made to fluctuate with a few actuators , arranged in the form of an active optics system , or a fast random scatterer .",
    "we proposed a `` dark - speckle camera '' , the faint source coronagraphic camera for the hubble space telescope ( @xcite ) .",
    "the project is reconsidered for the new generation space telescope .",
    "+ ir wavelengths are of interest for the detection of extrasolar planets , for two reasons : the planet s contrast is improved and , turbulence is easier to correct at these wavelengths .",
