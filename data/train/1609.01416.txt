    "lattice qcd calculations indicate that at baryon chemical potential @xmath0 , the transition from the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) to a hadron gas is a smooth crossover , while at large @xmath1 , the phase transition is of first order .",
    "the end point of the first order phase transition boundary is so called the critical point ( cp ) .",
    "the fluctuations of net - proton number measured by the star experiment at rhic suggest that the possible cp is unlikely below @xmath2 mev @xcite . since the moments of the conserved quantities distributions , for example net - baryon number , in the relativistic heavy ion collisions are sensitive to the correlation length @xmath3 of the system @xcite , and are believed to be good signatures of qcd phase transition and cp .",

    "the products of the moments , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , are constructed as the experimental observables .",
    "the results in rhic of these observables show a centrality and energy dependence @xcite , which are not reproduced by a non - cp transport and hadron resonance gas model calculations .",

    "the energy dependence of the @xmath11 of net - proton distributions in au+au collisons show non - monotonic behavior , which is consistent with close to the cp @xcite .",
    "in this paper we apply the quasi - particle model ( qqgp ) of quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) to calculate the moments of net - baryon distributions .",
    "the qqgp model was first proposed by peshier et.al .",
    "@xcite to study the non - ideal equation of state ( eos ) by lattice qcd results . instead of real quarks and gluons with qcd interactions ,",
    "the system is considered to be made up of non - interacting quasi - quarks and quasi - gluons with thermal masses .",
    "quasi - particles are thought to be quanta of plasma collective modes excited by quarks and gluons through qcd interactions .",
    "gorenstein and yang pointed out that initial quasi - particle model was thermodynamically inconsistent and then reformulated the statistical mechanics ( sm ) to solve the inconsistency @xcite .",
    "but then the expressions of pressure and energy density are end up with an extra undetermined , temperature dependent terms , which need to be phenomenologically chosen .",
    "it should be paid attention that this reformulation in fact is based on mathematical identities involving derivatives with respect to temperature and chemical potentials , used to redefine average energy density and number density respectively .",
    "the qqgp model with reformulated sm by gorenstein and yang has been studied by various groups @xcite . on the other hand bannur",
    "put forward another method which skip the thermodynamic inconsistency by avoiding derivatives and instead use the original definition of all thermodynamic quantities @xcite . by doing this ,",

    "as we have mentioned above , mathematical identities , which involve derivatives with respect to temperature and chemical potentials , destroy the thermodynamic consistence in the qqgp model .",
    "and then we have to redefine average energy density and number density respectively by introducing an extra undetermined , temperature dependent terms .",
    "since the susceptibilities of baryon number involve derivatives with respect to baryon chemical potentials , then an extra term must be introduced in the calculation . to avoid it ,",
    "we adopt the same way as bannur . in ref .",
    "@xcite , bannur gets the expectation of quark number by @xmath14 similarly , in this paper we directly calculate the various order of quark number expectations @xmath15 to avoid the possibility of destroying the thermodynamic consistency .    for the simplicity of calculation , we adopt the quasi - particle model of qgp here . in this model ,",
