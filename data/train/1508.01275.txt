    ", we shall study the bhm in eq.([bh ] ) by the numerical mc simulations . to this end",
    ", we have to derive an effective model for the bhm with _ a positive definite action_. although it is difficult to perform the direct quantum simulations because of the complex hopping in eq.([bh ] ) , we can derive a useful effective model including relevant quantum effects by integrating out certain degrees of freedom in the path - integral formalism .    in previous work@xcite",

    "in fact this mode has been observed in optical lattice experiments@xcite .",
    "in this section , we numerically study the qxym by means of the eqmc explained in the previous section .",
    "in particular , we are interested in vortex dynamics induced by the strong artificial magnetic field with the vector potential @xmath38 , and obtain a global phase diagram of vortex states . for the study on phase diagram of the present system with the complex hopping amplitudes ,",
    "the qxym is quite useful as the phase degrees of freedom of the boson field plays an essentially important role .    for the eqmc , we put the lattice spacing of the ol , @xmath39 , to the unit of length and also introduce a discretized lattice for the imaginary - time @xmath29 with the lattice spacing @xmath40 .",

    "however in the present study using the eqmc , we found more general solid patterns @xmath0 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the spatial density modulations are included as the variational parameter @xmath43 in the eqmc .",

    "when @xmath7 is small , the vortex solid states does not change along imaginary time direction.,width=302 ]    as we explained above , the density fluctuation influences the dynamics of the phase degrees of freedom @xmath28 .",

    "numerical simulation for the @xmath0 vortex solid state shows that as the value of @xmath7 increases , the vortex - lines in the imaginary - time direction starts to fluctuate . in fig.[vortex_line ] , we show the typical vortex - lines in the @xmath96 and @xmath5 cases .",
    "when @xmath7 is small , @xmath97 , the vortex - lines are straight in the imaginary time direction , whereas for large @xmath7 , @xmath69 , the vortex - lines are entangled with each other , i.e. , the regular vortex lattices shown in fig.[vortex_solid ] at some spatial layer tend to distort in adjacent layers and then the parallel - translated regular lattices reappear in some other layers .",
    "this different behavior of the vortex line stems from the quantum fluctuation , i.e. , whether the degenerate vortex solid states in 2d are superposed or not through _ quantum tunneling _ processes . when the degenerate states in 2d are superposed , the state may be regard as a _",
    "vortex quantum - liquid _ state . as shown in the phase diagram in fig.[pd ] ,",
    "the phase boundary between the vortex solid phase and the vortex quantum - liquid phase exists .",
    "however the phase boundary is not clear because the @xmath7-dependent term in @xmath46 in eq.([lattice_qxy ] ) generates only one - dimensional effect .",
    "here we conclude that _ the on - site interaction @xmath7 melts the rigid vortex - line states into the fluctuating vortex line states_. in following section , the observed phenomenon in the above is studied by using a duality transformation of the qxym .",

    "pining of vortex by the lattice is less effective , and the topological vortex number is spread rather wide spatial regions .",
    "these findings are in agreement with the intuitive picture such that for the low - density limit , the lattice works simply as a mesh employed for numerical study . in fact , the low - density limit means small hopping parameter @xmath169 and its relatively large local fluctuations , and then the interaction term in eq.([vortex_interaction ] ) becomes less effective .",

    "a numerical diagonalization of a small system showed that the ground - state of the hard - core bhm has a good overlap with the wave function in eq.([bls ] ) for a weak magnetic field @xmath177 and low density @xmath178 case .",
    "it is interesting to ask if a state that has similar properties to the laughlin state forms in the boson gas system on the ol for relatively large @xmath6 s and particle density .",

    "this mf state corresponds to the bosonic laughlin state and therefore in the bosonic laughlin state , the grand - state has the homogeneous particle density @xmath62 and also the homogeneous vortex density @xmath193 per site and per plaquette , respectively .",
    "however for sufficiently large @xmath62 and @xmath6 , the above condition is not satisfied by the configuration of @xmath179 because the duality transformation shows that vortex density at each plaquette @xmath194 takes an integer value .",
