    "the combined geometric acceptance and reconstruction efficiency is 5.2% with s / b=10 @xcite , and the trigger efficiency is 67% . in the @xmath115 mode",
    "the geometric and reconstruction efficiency is 5.9% and the trigger efficiencies and signal to background are same as in the @xmath114 mode . using the branching fractions predicted by aleksan @xcite and assuming a tagging efficiency @xmath116 we expect 8900 events in 2@xmath117 s.    the decay time resolution and the detachment of the decay vertex from the primary production vertex",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ phipi_p ] for the @xmath90 decay mode .",
    "the distributions for the @xmath118 mode are similar .",
    "using the measured values of s / b and time resolution , a mistag rate of 25% , and @xmath26=20 , a mini - monte carlo was used to generate the extracted value of @xmath28 for an ensemble of experiments each with 8900 signal events , for various sets of input parameters @xmath20 , @xmath119 . a maximum likelihood fit",

    "another method for extracting @xmath28 has been proposed by atwood , dunietz and soni @xcite , who refined a suggestion by gronau and wyler @xcite .",
    "a large cp asymmetry can result from the interference of the decays @xmath124 and @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is a doubly cabibbo suppressed decay of the @xmath127 ( for example @xmath128 , etc . )",
    "since @xmath129 is color - suppressed and @xmath130 is color - allowed , the overall amplitudes for the two decays are expected to be approximately equal in magnitude . the weak phase difference between them is @xmath28 . to observe a cp asymmetry",
    "there must also be a non - zero strong phase between the two amplitudes .",
    "it is necessary to measure the branching ratio @xmath131 for at least 2 different states @xmath126 in order to determine @xmath28 up to discrete ambiguities .",
    "we have examined the decay modes @xmath132 $ ] and @xmath133 $ ] .",
    "the combined geometric acceptance and reconstruction efficiency was found to be 6.6% for the @xmath134 mode and 5.5% for @xmath135 with a signal to background of about 1:1 .",
    "the trigger efficiency is approximately 70% for both modes .",
    "the expected number of @xmath136 events in @xmath3  s is 2400 in the @xmath134 mode and 4200 in the @xmath137 mode . with this number of events we expect to be able to measure @xmath28 ( up to discrete ambiguities ) with a statistical error of about @xmath138 in one year of running at @xmath139 .",
    "the overall sensitivity depends on the actual values of @xmath28 and the strong phases .",
    "the next method , described by gronau and rosner @xcite and fleischer and mannel @xcite , uses @xmath140 and @xmath141 decays .",
    "it is particularly promising as it may complement other methods by excluding some of the region around @xmath142 .",
    "we expect to reconstruct 3600 @xmath143 with s / b=0.5 and 29000 @xmath144 with s / b=3 .",
    "gronau and rosner estimate a measurement of @xmath28 to @xmath145 with 2400 events in each channel @xcite , however there has been much theoretical discussion about the effects of isospin conservation and rescattering which casts doubt on this method @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "there have been several suggestions , however , on how to measure these effects @xcite , and this method may turn out to be useful .",
    "in all of these studies we have assumed that we would have 9 @xmath146 m spatial resolution in each track hit in the pixel plane .",
    "we now address the question of whether or not this is reasonable .",
    "the parameters affecting the pixel resolution include the size of the pixel , the use of binary ( one bit ) versus analog ( 4 bits ) information , threshold and gain variations , and the use of electrons or holes as charge carriers , since the drift velocity for electrons is three times that for holes . for different incident angles of tracks on the pixels",

    "note that the poorer resolution peak near zero degrees in the non - bend plane does exist in the bend plane , but it is shifted toward negative incident angles .",
    "similar results are obtained with holes as charge carriers .",
    "the resolution in proper time is affected by several factors .",
    "one is the inherent pixel resolution , as discussed above .",
    "others include the amount of material in the pixel system , and the distance the pixel detector is placed from the beam line .",

    "the 132 ns bunch spacing at the tevatron makes first level detached vertex triggering easier .",
    "it is difficult for the vertex detector electronics in lhc - b to settle in 25 ns .",
    "the seven times larger energy at the lhc results in a larger track multiplicity per collision which causes trigger and tracking problems and a larger range of track momenta that need to be analyzed .",
    "the interaction region at the lhc is relatively short , @xmath156=5 cm , compared with the 30 cm long region at fermilab .",
    "this somewhat compensates for the larger number of interactions per crossing , since the interactions are well separated .",
    "there are detector specific advantages for btev as well .",
    "btev is a two - arm spectrometer , resulting a factor of two advantage .",
    "btev has the vertex detector in the magnetic field which allows the rejection of high multiple scattering ( low momentum ) tracks in the trigger .",
    "furthermore , btev is designed around a pixel vertex detector while lhc - b has a silicon strip detector .",
    "btev can put the detector closer to the beam ( 6 mm versus 1 cm ) , and has a much more robust tracking system which can trigger on detached verticies in the first trigger level , while lhc - b triggers on tracks of moderate transverse momentum in their first trigger level .",
    "we feel that we have more than compensated for lhc - b s initial advantages .",
    "hadron colliders have large @xmath0 and @xmath1 cross sections allowing the opportunity for precision measurements of cp violation and @xmath18 mixing . in our view this requires high density tracking and triggering information that can be provided by a state of the art pixel system .",
