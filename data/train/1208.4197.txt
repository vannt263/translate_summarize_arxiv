    "repeated measurement of an observable that is appropriately changed according to the pre - measurement outcomes , i.e. , the _ adaptive measurement _ , has great potential for various purposes in quantum information sciences .",
    "the first demonstration has come out in the application to quantum phase estimation @xcite .",
    "another application of adaptive measurement is for state preparation @xcite .",
    "a striking feature of this scheme is that a desired time evolution of the state is brought only by measurement back - action , and there is no need to introduce any external force for controlling the state .",
    "let us especially focus on the method developed by jacobs @xcite .",
    "this employs the schematic of a continuous - time measurement ; in this case the probabilistic change of a qubit state @xmath0 is described by the following _ stochastic master equation _ ( sme )",
    "@xcite : @xmath1\\bigr]dt                      \\notag \\\\       & + \\sqrt{2 k_t }         \\big ( \\hat{\\sigma}_t \\hat{\\rho}_t + \\hat{\\rho}_t \\hat{\\sigma}_t                  - 2 { { \\rm",

    "represent the measured observable and the measurement strength , respectively .",
    "adaptive measurement means that we can change @xmath4 and @xmath5 continuously in time , as functions of the state @xmath6 , so that @xmath6 will converge to a target state . in jacobs scheme",
    ", the state is assumed to be pure ( this actually holds if the initial state is pure ) and is thus of the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the target state and the initial state , respectively .",
    "then the observable and the measurement strength are updated according to the following laws : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a positive constant and @xmath12 is the pauli matrix .",
    "( the index `` @xmath13 '' indicates that it is the scheme proposed by jacobs . )",
    "this means that the measured observable @xmath14 is changed so that its eigenstates are always perpendicular to the current state @xmath15 in the bloch sphere representation , as shown in fig .  1  ( a ) .",
    "the measurement strength @xmath16 is also adaptively changed , and it decreases proportionally to the distance between the current and target states ; note that the measurement becomes very weak when the state approaches to the target .",
    "in fact , with this adaptive measurement law , the time evolution of @xmath17 $ ] is given by @xmath18 and it was numerically shown in @xcite that @xmath19 converges to zero as @xmath20 almost surely .        here we come up with the question about how much the above adaptive measurement scheme is robust against certain disturbance acting on the system .",
    "actually such robustness against a specific decohering effect was evaluated in @xcite .",
    "another specific but important disturbance is an _",
    "unknown _ unitary evolution of the qubit state , in which case the driving term @xmath21dt$ ] is added to the right hand side of eq .  .",
    "for example , if we take a two - level atom continuously observed using the faraday rotation technique @xcite to realize the qubit system subjected to eq .",
    ", such a disturbing hamiltonian may appear and take the form @xmath22 with @xmath23 unknown detuning between the atomic transition frequency and the laser frequency .",
    "note that in @xcite this kind of unknown disturbance was not discussed .    in this paper",
    ", we reconsider the same control problem discussed above , yet with additional care about the influence of an unknown unitary evolution , and then propose a new adaptive measurement scheme that has clear robustness property against that disturbance .",
    "a novel difference between our scheme and jacobs one is that we take the measurement axis between the currenet and the target states in the sense shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : axises ]  ( b ) , rather than the orthogonal one ; then that measurement axis converges to the target , so that the state may be probabilistically moved toward the target as well .",
    "the main feature of this scheme is that we can keep the measurement strength constant during all the time - evolution , while in jacobs case it must be weakened when the state approaches to the target .",
    "this mechanism brings the following two merits : ( i ) the first is that the experimental implementation becomes simpler ; in fact we need to adaptively change only the measurement axis .",
    "( ii ) secondly , because the measurement strength is not weakened , the system preserves capability moving the state via measurement back action even near the target .",
    "the latter is more important in the present context , because it is then expected that the adaptive measurement can deal with the unknown force along all the time evolution , while in jacobs case the unknown force has to become dominant and thus can not be suppressed when the state approaches to the target .",
    "this fact will be actually demonstrated in numerical simulations .",
    "in general , if we continuously measure an observable in a qnd manner , the state moves probabilistically toward one of the eigenstates of that observable @xcite . hence ,",
    "if this measured observable is changed adaptively so that the eigenstate attracting the current state approaches to a desired target state , it is expected that the state will finally be stabilized at that target state .",
    "based on this idea , we take the following observable as a measured observable in eq .  : @xmath24 where @xmath25 $ ] is the tuning parameter whose meaning is explained below .",
    "the index `` @xmath26 '' indicates that it is the  robust \" adaptive measurement scheme to discern it from jacobs one .",
    "the eigenstates of the observable @xmath27 are given by @xmath28 which satisfy @xmath29 .",
    "in the bloch sphere representation , @xmath30 divides the angle between the target state @xmath31 and the current state @xmath32 into @xmath33 ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : axises ]  ( b ) .",
    "the transition probabilities of the state jumping to these eigenstates are @xmath34 and @xmath35 , where @xmath36 , and they satisfy @xmath37 if @xmath38 .",
    "this means that the state tends to move towards the direction of @xmath39 with probability @xmath40 . at the same time , since in this case @xmath19 decreases , the eigenstate @xmath30 moves towards the target @xmath31 . in particular , when the state reaches the target @xmath31 , or equivalently @xmath41 , the eigenstate @xmath39 becomes identical to the target and the transition probability @xmath40 takes the value @xmath42 ; that is , the state is stabilized at the target as expected .",
    "next , the measurement strength is simply set to a constant value @xmath43 , unlike the case of jacobs scheme . the reason will be explained in remark ( i ) given in the end of this section , but we here point out that this setting has a clear merit from a practical viewpoint .",
    "in fact , changing the measurement strength in addition to changing the measured observable definitely costs more expensive compared to the case where only the latter is required . in this sense , our scheme is suited to experimental implementation .    regarding the disturbing hamiltonian , as discussed in sec .",
    "i , we choose @xmath44 , where @xmath23 is an unknown constant .",
    "note that with this hamiltonian the state rotates around the @xmath45 axis in the bloch sphere .",
    "consequently , the dynamical evolution of the state under the adaptive measurement setup and the disturbing hamiltonian introduced above is given by @xmath46dt              - k^{\\rm r } [ \\hat{\\sigma}_t^{\\rm r } ,                      [ \\hat{\\sigma}_t^{\\rm r } , \\hat{\\rho}_t ] ] dt   \\notag \\\\",

    "when @xmath50 , is @xmath51 on the other hand , the dynamics of the same @xmath19 but with jacobs scheme is given by @xmath52    a striking difference of the above two dynamics and is that the former contains an additional drift term @xmath53 while in the latter equation there is no such state - dependent term .",
    "note that this additional drift term apparently works for driving @xmath19 toward zero .",
    "this fine property of our scheme is brought from the mechanism that , around @xmath54 , the target state itself is continuously measured and thus the state is attracted to the target with very high probability .",
    "in contrast , as mentioned before , in jacobs case the measurement has to be weakened and finally turned off when the state reaches the target , thus there is no such attracting effect changing @xmath19 to zero .",
    "we further expect that the additional drift term in eq .   implies no more than the enhancement of stability of the dynamics of @xmath19 , which consequently makes the system robust against the disturbing noise . note that this observation makes sense only when the state is around the target . therefore , in the later sections we will examine some numerical simulations to actually verify the above - mentioned driving effect and resulting robustness property .    before closing this section ,",
    "we provide two remarks .",
    "( i ) : jacobs scheme requires the adaptive tuning of the measurement strength ( i.e. , @xmath55 in eq .  ) for the dynamics of @xmath19 to have the state - dependent diffusion term .",
    "such state - dependence is indeed necessary to generate dynamical stability of @xmath19 .",
    "hence , it should be maintained that , with our measurement scheme , the diffusion term of eq .",
    "depends on the state even with the fixed measurement strength ( i.e. , @xmath43 ) .",
    "_ remark _ ( ii ) : the time evolution of the fidelity between the current state @xmath56 and the target state @xmath31 is given by @xmath57dt   \\notag \\\\       - \\sqrt{2 k^{\\rm r } } \\big [              \\frac{3 + \\cos\\delta_t } { 2 } \\cos(\\alpha\\delta_t -\\delta_t )               + \\cos(\\alpha \\delta_t ) \\big ] dw_t .",
    "\\label{eq_cost}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence , the optimum value of @xmath58 that maximizes the deterministic change per unit time of the fidelity is given by @xmath59 .",
    "this value is actually taken in the simulations shown later .",
    "when @xmath60 .",
    "the solid blue line corresponds to our adaptive measurement scheme while the dashed red line does jacobs scheme . ]",
    "subjected to our scheme , for several values of @xmath23 .",
    "the green , red , water blue , purple , and blue lines correspond to @xmath61 , and @xmath60 , respectively . ]    in this section , to verify that our adaptive measurement scheme actually works for driving the state towards the target , we examine some numerical simulations , under the assumption that @xmath23 is _ known _ ; this is a crucial assumption because we are then able to update @xmath19 and as a result the adaptive measurement law ( or eq .  ) exactly by recursively solving eq .",
    "( or eq .   for jacobs case ) . for reference",
    ", we show the trajectories in jacobs case as well ; in particular , we set the same diffusion coefficients in eqs .   and ;",
    "i.e. , @xmath62 , which leads to @xmath63 .",
    "hence let us here take the parameters as @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 ( see remark ( ii ) in sec .",
    "the disturbance strength @xmath23 takes several values .",
    "the initial condition is @xmath67 , as defined below eq .  .",
    "figure [ delta0 ] shows the time evolutions of the mean and the standard deviation of @xmath19 , when @xmath60 .",
    "the plots are obtained by averaging @xmath68 sample paths .",
    "the solid blue and the dashed red lines correspond to the cases of our adaptive measurement scheme and jacobs one , respectively .",
    "we find from the figures that , in both cases , the state certainly converges to the target with almost probability one .",
    "note that the plots do not imply that our scheme offers faster and stable convergence of the state compared to jacobs case ; this is because the measurement strength of jacobs scheme has to be weakened , implying slower change of the state around the target .",
    "next , fig .",
    "[ deltachanged ] shows the means and the standard deviations of @xmath19 , with several values of @xmath23 .",
    "as expected , the disturbance prevents the state from converging to the target .",
    "notably , in the long time limit , the error is approximately proportional to @xmath23 .",
    "similar plots are obtained in jacobs case as well .",
    "_ remark _ : although we mentioned above that the figures do not imply the superiority of our scheme over jacobs one , a trivial fair comparison can be performed as follows .",
    "in fact , if we take a constant measurement strength @xmath69 in jacobs scheme , the dynamics is given by @xmath70 ; clearly , then , @xmath19 does not converge to zero even under the boundary condition .",
    "that is , if we run the two schemes with the same constant measurement strength , clearly our scheme offers better performance over jacobs one .",
    "here we study the case where the disturbance magnitude @xmath23 is _ unknown_. to make the situation clear , let us again consider the general sme that is additionally driven by an unknown hamiltonian @xmath71 : @xmath72dt        - k_t \\big[\\hat{\\sigma}_t , [ \\hat{\\sigma}_t , \\hat{\\rho}_t ] \\big]dt    \\notag \\\\       & + \\sqrt{2 k_t }         \\big [ \\hat{\\sigma}_t \\hat{\\rho}_t + \\hat{\\rho}_t \\hat{\\sigma}_t             - 2 { { \\rm tr}\\hspace{0.07cm}}(\\hat{\\sigma}_t \\hat\\rho_t)\\hat{\\rho}_t \\big ] dw_t . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this _ true state _",
    "@xmath6 can not be precisely updated , due to the uncertainty of @xmath71 .",
    "therefore , we need to devise an updating law of a _ nominal state _ , say @xmath73 , only using the measurement result @xmath74 that is subjected to the output equation @xmath75 note this is driven by the same @xmath2 as that in eq .",
    "; @xmath2 is called the _ innovation _ in the framework of quantum filtering theory @xcite . to update @xmath73",

    "hence we can recursively calculate the nominal state @xmath73 , although it should differ from the true state @xmath6 . in the adaptive measurement setup , therefore , the observable @xmath4 and the strength @xmath5 are changed in time as functions of @xmath73 .    for the specific problem under consideration ,",

    "we here address the mechanism that brings about the above drastic difference .",
    "first , since the nominal state is now governed by the dynamics without uncertainty , @xmath87 converges to zero , as seen in sec .",
    "when @xmath95 , the measured observable becomes @xmath96 for both the adaptive measurement schemes , but the measurement strength becomes @xmath97 for jacobs case while @xmath98 in our case ; that is , jacobs scheme stops to measure the system once @xmath99 is reached , and consequently the true variable @xmath19 turns out to follow the deterministic dynamics @xmath100 .",

    "the above statement holds only for the case of @xmath92 ; hence we take some non - zero values of @xmath80 and show in fig .",
    "[ robustnessdelta ] the trajectories of @xmath19 and @xmath87 . if @xmath80 is not zero but smaller than the true value @xmath23 ( figs .

    "we further expect that the issue found in jacobs case may be avoided by taking a large value of @xmath11 ; actually , the major drawback of jacobs scheme is that the measurement strength has to be weakened around the target , which brings less stability of the state . hence let us try some larger values of @xmath11 to see if a similar issue can still happen . figures  [ robustness kappa ]  ( b , d ) demonstrate the nominal and true valus of @xmath19 in jacobs case , with the parameters @xmath91 and @xmath102 ; in particular , here a relatively large values of @xmath11 are taken , i.e. , @xmath105 for the case ( b ) and @xmath106 for the case ( d ) . clearly , the stability are enhanced compared to the previous cases shown in fig .",
    "[ robustnessdelta ] in the sense that the convergence speed becomes faster .",
    "however , the issue is not resolved ; that is , in both cases the nominal state fails to track the true one once it approaches to the target , and then the true one obeys the deterministic unitary time evolution and flows away from the target . on the other hand , as shown in figs .",
    "[ robustness kappa ]  ( a , c ) , our measurement scheme does not bring such flow of the state , because of the intrinsic stability given to both @xmath19 and @xmath87 .",
    "note that , when @xmath107 , the issue observed in fig .",
    "[ robustnessdelta ]  ( f ) still happens , while in our case the fluctuation is well suppressed .",
    "summarizing , our adaptive measurement scheme offers better estimation of @xmath19 , compared to jacobs case , in the sense that it is fairly robust against the uncertainty of the additional unitary time evolution .",
    "it should be maintained again that this nice stability property is brought from the mechanism of continuous monitoring of the system with constant measurement strength .",
    "the main features of the presented adaptive measurement scheme are twofold ; the first is that the measured observable contains an eigenstate that eventually converges to the target state , and the other is that the measurement strength can be taken constant even when the state is close to the target , which is the crucial property bringing the robustness property .",
    "as long as the above two conditions are satisfied , it is expected that our measurement scheme can be generalized to the multi - dimensional case . however , in many situations any physically available observable does not contain an eigenvector that is identical to a desired target state , and then our measurement scheme can not be used for preparing that target state .",
    "rather , as discussed in @xcite , in such a case , a certain weak measurement may work for generating a target state .",
    "but a critical requirement for this measurement is that the measurement strength should be weakened when the state approaches to the target ; then , the system can become fragile against unknown disturbance , as seen in sec .",
