    "voids are an omnipresent feature of the galaxy distribution ( @xcite ; see @xcite for a historical review ) .",
    "galaxy redshift surveys reveal that underdense regions 30  in diameter are common , and that they can be as large as 50 . a fundamental question regarding the nature of voids is whether they are as empty of matter as they are of light , or whether the breadth and depth of observed voids is a consequence of a lower efficiency of galaxy formation in underdense regions . for the matter distribution ,",
    "the frequency of large voids is sensitive to departures from gaussianity in the primordial density fluctuations ( @xcite ) . in gaussian models ,",
    "the frequency of voids depends on the rms amplitude of matter clustering and on the bias between galaxies and mass ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite show that void statistics are sensitive not only to the amplitude of galaxy bias , but also to the detailed form of the relation between the underlying matter distribution and galaxy formation efficiency . in this paper",
    ", we revisit the connection between voids and galaxy bias in the framework of the halo occupation distribution ( hod ) , which has emerged in the last few years as a powerful method for characterizing the relationship between galaxies and mass ( @xcite , hereafter bw ) .",
    "many different methods have been proposed for identifying voids and quantifying their importance ( @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we will use two of the simplest statistical measures of cosmic voids : the void probability function ( vpf , denoted @xmath10 ) and the underdensity probability function ( upf , denoted @xmath11 ) .",
    "the vpf is defined as the probability that a randomly placed sphere of radius @xmath12 contains no galaxies of a given class .",
    "the upf is similar but quantifies the probability that the galaxy density within a randomly placed sphere is less than a defined threshold , usually 0.2 times the mean density for galaxies of that type .",
    "the vpf depends on the full hierarchy of @xmath13-point correlation functions ( @xcite ) , so in principle it contains complementary information to the two - point correlation function .",
    "the first significant measurement of the vpf and upf was the analysis of the cfa redshift survey by @xcite .",
    "the current state of the art is the analysis of the two - degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs , @xcite ) by @xcite , which covered 1500 deg@xmath14 to a median redshift of @xmath15 .",
    "forthcoming results for the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , @xcite ) should yield even more precise measurements of the void distribution owing to its larger survey volume , which will ultimately extend over nearly a quarter of the sky .",
    "the galaxies that define the voids are , in general , a biased tracer of the underlying mass distribution . a fully non - linear model of galaxy bias is required to compare theory to observations for any clustering measure .",
    "the hod formalism describes bias at the level of dark matter `` halos , '' where a halo is a structure of overdensity @xmath16 , in approximate dynamical equilibrium ( identified in this paper by the friends - of - friends algorithm , see  [ sec : sims ] ) . with this definition ,",
    "the mass function , spatial clustering , and velocity statistics of dark matter halos are essentially independent of gas physics , and they can be determined accurately for a given cosmology using high - resolution n - body simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) or analytic approximations calibrated on these simulations . in the hod framework , one specifies the bias of any particular class of galaxies by specifying @xmath17 , the probability that a halo of mass @xmath18 houses @xmath19 such galaxies , together with any spatial or velocity biases between galaxies and dark matter _ within _ individual halos . to the extent that the hod is independent of a halo s larger scale environment ( a point that we return to below ) , this description of bias is complete , for all clustering statistics on all scales .",
    "the hod framework has been used to model measurements of the projected galaxy correlation function , , from the sdss ( @xcite ) .",
    "the conditional luminosity function , which combines the hod with luminosity information , has been used to analyze the correlation function and luminosity function of the two - degree field galaxy redshift survey ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "approaches to modeling void statistics with the hod have been discussed by @xcite and bw . here",
    "we follow the approach of bw and calculate the vpf and upf by populating dark matter halos identified in collisionless n - body simulations .",
    "it is well known that the halo mass function correlates with large - scale environment ( @xcite ) .",
    "massive halos form from high - sigma fluctuations in the primordial density field , which reside preferentially in regions that are overdense on larger scales @xcite . in low - density regions ,",
    "high - sigma fluctuations are rare , so these environments are dominated by low - mass halos .",
    "we therefore expect void statistics to be sensitive to halo occupation at low halo masses , where the occupation number is zero or one .",
    "bw adopted a power - law mean occupation function for galaxies above a luminosity threshold , i.e. , @xmath20 , with a cutoff at @xmath21 below which halos could not house galaxies above the threshold .",
    "their results showed a strong correlation between @xmath21 and the sizes of voids . here",
    "we adopt a more physically motivated occupation function that divides halo occupation into central and satellite galaxies ( @xcite ) . in this parameterization , the behavior of @xmath22 at low masses",
    "is essentially determined by the relation between halo mass and the properties of the central galaxy .",
    "for each galaxy population that we model , we only consider hod models that are constrained to match the mean space density @xmath1 and the projected correlation function  of sdss galaxies measured by @xcite . in this respect",
    ", we are investigating what _ additional _ information can be obtained from void statistics once these constraints have been imposed . in this context , we want to answer several questions :    \\1 .",
    "do void statistics provide additional information on the minimum halo mass for a galaxy sample , within the range allowed by the constraints of matching the observed @xmath1 and ?",
    "are void statistics sensitive to the scatter in the relation between halo mass and central galaxy luminosity , which alters the _ form _ of the cutoff in @xmath22 ?",
    "\\3 . can void statistics discriminate among values of @xmath23 , the rms linear theory amplitude of _ mass _ fluctuations in 8  spheres , if _ galaxy _",
    "hods are chosen to reproduce the observed correlation function ?",
    "( here @xmath24 . )",
    "we will show that the answer to all three questions is , for practical purposes , no . once one has matched @xmath1 and , variations in the vpf and upf that result from varying @xmath21 within the allowed range , from changing the form of the low - mass cutoff , or from altering @xmath23 , are all at the level of error expected from the full sdss sample .",
    "we will demonstrate that the aspect of the hod that has the greatest influence on void statistics is the fraction of galaxies that are satellites , because once this is determined the cutoff mass @xmath21 is essentially fixed by @xmath1 .",
    "the satellite fraction is well constrained by matching .",
    "therefore , within the standard cosmological and hod framework , the predicted void statistics are remarkably robust . the imposition of the observed correlation function as a constraint is the crucial difference between our work and the analysis of bw , and it accounts for our differing conclusions about the information content of void statistics .    in the standard implementation of hod models , including those that lead to the conclusions mentioned above , the statistics of galaxy occupation are assumed to depend on a halo s mass , independent of its larger scale environment .",
    "semi - analytical models of galaxy formation that incorporate this assumption reproduce the observed correlations of galaxy luminosity , color , and morphology with environment ( @xcite ) ; these arise because the halo mass function itself varies with large scale overdensity .",
    "direct observational support for this assumption comes from the work of @xcite , who show that the variation of blue galaxy fraction with overdensity measured on a 6  scale is fully explained by the variation on the 1  scale characteristic of individual large halos . on the theoretical side , @xcite s ( @xcite )",
    "excursion set derivation of the extended press - schechter ( 1974 ) formalism predicts that halo formation histories at fixed mass are independent of large scale overdensity ( @xcite ) , while @xcite show that the hod for a baryon - mass selected sample from weinberg et al.s ( 2004 ) smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulation has no detectable dependence on environment .",
    "however , while early n - body investigations ( @xcite ) showed little or no correlation between halo formation histories and environment for masses above @xmath25 , several recent studies ( @xcite ) show much stronger correlations at lower masses .",
    "the correlation of halo formation time with large scale overdensity , which is especially prominent in the mass range @xmath26  of individual dwarf galaxy halos , raises the possibility that the galaxy hod itself varies with halo environment , at least in the single - galaxy regime .",
    "void statistics should be a sensitive probe of any such environmental variations , since they characterize extreme environments and are not washed out by the strong signals from multiple galaxy halos . in  4 , we investigate a simple class of extended hod models in which the minimum host mass @xmath21 changes by a fixed factor in low density environments .",
    "the vpf and upf prove quite sensitive to such changes , and the two statistics provide somewhat complementary information about the density dependence of @xmath21 . by tightly constraining this dependence",
    ", void statistics can test fundamental ideas about galaxy formation and provide essential input to cosmological applications of hod methods ( @xcite ) .",
    "the simulation used in this paper was performed using the hashed oct - tree code of @xcite , and is similar to those presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this simulation is substantially larger in terms of particle number , with @xmath4 particles .",
    "the simulation box is 400  per side , giving a mass resolution of @xmath27 .",
    "halos are identified in the simulation by the friends - of - friends technique ( @xcite ) with a linking length 0.2 times the mean interparticle separation . for low - luminosity , @xmath28 galaxies",
    ", the minimum mass halo roughly corresponds to a 100-particle halo . the linear power spectrum used to create the initial conditions was calculated with  ( @xcite ) , with the parameter set @xmath29 and a scale - invariant inflationary power spectrum .",
    "we use the output at @xmath30 , where the linear growthfactor is @xmath31 , to represent a universe with @xmath32 , scaling the peculiar velocities and internal dispersions of halos to values appropriate for @xmath33 ( see tinker et .",
    "al . [ 2005b ] and zheng et .",
    "al [ 2002 ] for a discussion of this technique ) .",
    "this simulation is ideal for our purposes because of its high mass resolution and large box size .",
    "high mass resolution is required to model low - luminosity galaxy populations .",
    "the lowest luminosity sdss sample that we can model is @xmath2 . throughout the paper . for other values",
    ", one should add @xmath34 . ]",
    "the statistical errors in measuring void statistics are dominated by the finite number of independent volumes in the simulation ( or survey ) , once the voids become large .",
    "the @xmath35 @xmath36 simulation volume is comparable to that of the volume - limited sample of bright @xmath3 galaxies expected for the full sdss .",
    "therefore , the statistical errors in our calculations are comparable to those expected from the sdss analysis",
    ". the volume of the full sdss @xmath37 sample will be approximately the same as one octant of our simulation , and our errors are therefore smaller by @xmath38 . in practice",
    ", the observational errors will be somewhat larger than the error in periodic cubes of the same volume because edges and `` holes '' in the survey region mean that one can not use the full volume for void measurements .    to determine hod parameters",
    ", we use the measurements of  from @xcite for galaxies brighter than @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "we choose these two samples because they probe different regimes of the halo mass function ; bright galaxies preferentially occupy high - mass halos , while the majority of lower luminosity galaxies occupy lower mass halos ( @xcite ) .",
    "we use the five - parameter hod model of @xcite , which is flexible enough to precisely describe the halo occupation functions predicted from semi - analytic galaxy formation models and hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "the full mean occupation function is the sum of the average number of central galaxies and satellite galaxies in halos of mass @xmath18 , i.e. @xmath41 . for satellite galaxies , the mean occupation is    @xmath42    where @xmath18 is the halo mass , @xmath43 is a cutoff mass below which a halo can not host a satellite galaxy , @xmath44 is the mass at which a halo hosts one satellite on average , and @xmath45 is the power - law exponent of the relation , a number usually near one .",
    "the distribution of satellite galaxies about the mean is assumed to be poisson , i.e. @xmath46 .",
    "this assumption is well - motivated by both collisionless and hydrodynamic studies of halo substructure ( @xcite ) , and by observational studies of galaxies within clusters ( @xcite ) .    for central galaxies ,",

    "unfortunately , as presented in this appendix it can not be used for full analytic modeling of the effect of density dependence without the use of n - body simulations , which were used here to obtain @xmath265 .",
    "the need for n - body simulations could be circumvented with analytic approximations of the conditional mass function ( @xcite ) , but it is unclear whether these approximations have the necessary accuracy for use as a tool for constraining density dependence with  measurements .",
    "further investigation may prove fruitful .",

    "<S> we investigate the power of void statistics to constrain galaxy bias and the amplitude of dark matter fluctuations . we adopt a @xmath0cdm cosmological scenario ( inflationary cold dark matter with a cosmological constant ) and use the halo occupation distribution ( hod ) framework to describe the relation between galaxies and dark matter . after choosing hod parameters that reproduce the mean space density @xmath1 and projected correlation function  measuremed for galaxy samples with @xmath2 and @xmath3 from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , we predict the void probability function ( vpf ) and underdensity probability function ( upf ) of these samples by populating the halos of a large , high - resolution n - body simulation ( 400 , @xmath4 particles ) . if we make the conventional simplifying assumption that the hod is independent of large scale environment at fixed halo mass , then models constrained to match @xmath1 and  predict nearly identical void statistics , independent of the scatter between halo mass and central galaxy luminosity or statistical uncertainties in hod parameters . </S>",
    "<S> models with power spectrum normalizations @xmath5 and @xmath6 also predict very similar void statistics , with stronger galaxy bias compensating for weaker dark matter fluctuations in the low-@xmath7 model . </S>",
    "<S> however , the vpf and upf are sensitive to environmental variations of the hod in a regime where these variations have little impact on . for example , doubling the minimum host halo mass in regions with large scale ( 5 ) density contrast @xmath8 has a readily detectable impact on void probabilities of @xmath2 galaxies , and a similar change for @xmath9 alters the void probabilities of @xmath3 galaxies at a detectable level . </S>",
    "<S> the vpf and upf provide complementary information about the onset and magnitude of density - dependence in the hod . by detecting or ruling out hod changes in low density regions , </S>",
    "<S> void statistics can reduce systematic uncertainties in the cosmological constraints derived from hod modeling , and , more importantly , reveal connections between halo formation history and galaxy properties . </S>"
