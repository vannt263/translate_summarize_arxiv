    "in the recent years a huge theoretical effort has been devoted aiming to establish a unified description of all interactions including gravity . out of this sustained endeavor , along the the superstring theory framework @xcite , the non - commutative geometry one has emerged @xcite .",
    "an interesting development worth noting was the observation that a natural realization of non - commutativity of space appears in the string theory context of d - branes in the presence of a constant antisymmetric field @xcite , which brought together the two approaches .",
    "however these very interesting approaches do not address as yet the usual problem of the standard model of elementary particle physics , i.e. the presence of a plethora of free parameters to the ad - hoc introduction of the higgs and yukawa sectors in the theory .",
    "these sectors might have their origin in a higher - dimensional theory according to various schemes among whose the first one was the coset space dimensional reduction ( csdr ) @xcite .",
    "the csdr scheme has been used to reduce in four dimensions a ten - dimensional , @xmath0 gauge theory @xciteand might be an appropriate reduction scheme of strings over nearly kaehler manifolds @xcite .",
    "more recently the dimensional reduction of gauge theories defined in higher dimensions where the extra dimensions form a fuzzy coset ( a finite matrix manifold ) has been examined @xcite .",
    "this might lead to interesting constructions for particle physics models . in the present paper we would like to present the main points and results of the dimensional reduction over fuzzy coset spaces and emphasize in particular the issue of the renormalizability of gauge theories defined with such a non - commutative setup .    in the csdr",
    "one assumes that the form of space - time is @xmath1 with @xmath2 a homogeneous space ( obtained as the quotient of the lie group @xmath3 via the lie subgroup @xmath4 ) .",
    "then a gauge theory with gauge group @xmath5 defined on @xmath6 can be dimensionally reduced to @xmath7 in an elegant way using the symmetries of @xmath2 , in particular the resulting four - dimensional gauge group is a subgroup of @xmath5 .",
    "although the reduced theory in four dimensions is power counting renormalizable the full higher - dimensional theory is non - renormalizable with dimensionful coupling .",
    "the csdr scheme reduces dimensionally a gauge theory with gauge group @xmath5 defined on @xmath8 to a gauge theory on @xmath9 imposing the principle that fields should be invariant under the @xmath3 action up to a @xmath5 gauge transformation .",
    "the csdr scheme constitutes an elegant and consistent truncation of the full theory in four dimensions , keeping only the first terms of the field expansion in higher harmonics of the compact coset spaces .",
    "when keeping all the higher harmonics , i.e. the kaluza - klein modes in four dimensions , then the theory in general becomes non - renormalizable as expected , since the theory was originally defined in higher than four dimensions .",
    "still it is very interesting the fact that one can discuss the dependence of the couplings of the theory on the cutoff , or the beta - function of the couplings in the wilson renormalization scheme @xcite . in the fuzzy - csdr",
    "we apply the csdr principle in the case that the extra dimensions are a finite approximation of the homogeneous spaces @xmath2 , i.e. a fuzzy coset .",
    "fuzzy spaces are obtained by deforming the algebra of functions on their commutative parent spaces .",
    "the algebra of functions ( from the fuzzy space to complex numbers ) becomes finite dimensional and non - commutative , indeed it becomes a matrix algebra .",
    "therefore , instead of considering the algebra of functions @xmath10 we consider the algebra @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the usual commutative algebra of functions on minkowski space @xmath7 and @xmath13 is the finite dimensional non - commutative algebra of @xmath14 matrices that approximates the functions on the coset @xmath15 . on this finite dimensional algebra",
    "we still have the action of the symmetry group @xmath3 ; this very property allows us to apply the csdr scheme to fuzzy cosets .",
    "the reduction of a gauge theory defined on @xmath16 to a gauge theory on @xmath17 is a two step process .",
    "one first rewrites the higher - dimensional fields , that initially depends on the commutative coordinates @xmath18 and the noncommutative ones @xmath19 , in terms of only the commutative coordinates @xmath18 , with the fields now being also @xmath14 matrix valued .",
    "one then imposes the fuzzy - csdr constraints on this four - dimensional theory .",
    "we can say that the theory is a higher - dimensional theory because the fuzzy space @xmath20 is a noncommutative approximation of the coset space @xmath2 ; in particular the spatial symmetry group @xmath3 of the space @xmath20 is the same as that of the commutative space @xmath2 .",
    "however the noncommutative theory has the advantage of being power counting renormalizable because @xmath21 is a finite dimensional space ; it follows that also after applying the fuzzy - csdr scheme we obtain a power counting renormalizable theory .",
    "the fuzzy sphere @xcite is a matrix approximation of the usual sphere @xmath22 .",
    "the algebra of functions on @xmath22 ( for example spanned by the spherical harmonics ) is truncated at a given frequency and thus becomes finite dimensional .",
    "the truncation has to be consistent with the associativity of the algebra and this can be nicely achieved relaxing the commutativity property of the algebra .",
    "the fuzzy sphere is the `` space '' described by this non - commutative algebra .",
    "the algebra itself is that of @xmath14 matrices .",
    "more precisely , the algebra of functions on the ordinary sphere can be generated by the coordinates of * r*@xmath23 modulo the relation @xmath24 .",
    "the fuzzy sphere @xmath25 at fuzziness level @xmath26 is the non - commutative manifold whose coordinate functions @xmath27 are @xmath28 hermitian matrices proportional to the generators of the @xmath29-dimensional representation of @xmath30 .",

    "indeed it can be proven that for @xmath36 one obtains the usual commutative sphere .    on the fuzzy sphere",
    "there is a natural @xmath30 covariant differential calculus .",
    "this calculus is three - dimensional and the derivations @xmath37 along @xmath38 of a function @xmath39 are given by @xmath40\\,.\\label{derivations}$ ] accordingly the action of the lie derivatives on functions is given by @xmath41~;\\ ] ] these lie derivatives satisfy the leibniz rule and the @xmath30 lie algebra relation @xmath42 = c_{\\hat{a } \\hat{b } \\hat{c } } { \\cal l}_{\\hat{c}}.\\ ] ] in the @xmath43 limit the derivations @xmath37 become @xmath44 and only in this commutative limit the tangent space becomes two - dimensional .",
    "the exterior derivative is given by @xmath45\\theta^{\\hat{a}}\\ ] ] with @xmath46 the one - forms dual to the vector fields @xmath37 , @xmath47 .",
    "the space of one - forms is generated by the @xmath46 s in the sense that for any one - form @xmath48 we can always write @xmath49 with given functions @xmath50 depending on the functions @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 . the action of the lie derivatives @xmath54 on the one - forms @xmath55 explicitly reads @xmath56 on a general one - form @xmath57 we have @xmath58\\theta^{\\hat{a}}-\\omega_{\\hat{a}}c^{\\hat{a}}_{\\ \\hat{b } \\hat{c}}\\theta^{\\hat{c } } $ ] and therefore @xmath59- \\omega_{\\hat{c}}c^{\\hat{c}}_{\\ \\hat{b }   \\hat{a}}~;\\label{fund}\\ ] ] this formula will be fundamental for formulating the csdr principle on fuzzy cosets .",
    "the differential geometry on the product space minkowski times fuzzy sphere , @xmath60 , is easily obtained from that on @xmath17 and on @xmath61 . for example a one - form @xmath62 defined on @xmath60 is written as @xmath63 with @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "one can also introduce spinors on the fuzzy sphere and study the lie derivative on these spinors .",
    "although here we have sketched the differential geometry on the fuzzy sphere , one can study other ( higher - dimensional ) fuzzy spaces ( e.g. fuzzy @xmath66 ) and with similar techniques their differential geometry .",
    "first we consider on @xmath67 a non - commutative gauge theory with gauge group @xmath68 and examine its four - dimensional interpretation .",
    "@xmath69 is a fuzzy coset , for example the fuzzy sphere @xmath70 .",
    "the action is @xmath71 where @xmath72 denotes integration over the fuzzy coset @xmath73 described by @xmath14 matrices ; here the parameter @xmath74 is related to the size of the fuzzy coset space .",
    "for example for the fuzzy sphere we have @xmath75 @xcite . in the @xmath36 limit @xmath72",
    "becomes the usual integral on the coset space . for finite @xmath29",
    ", @xmath76 is a good integral because it has the cyclic property @xmath77 .",
    "it is also invariant under the action of the group @xmath3 , that is infinitesimally given by the lie derivative . in the action ( [ formula8 ] )",
    "@xmath78 is the gauge group @xmath5 trace .",

    "the fields @xmath109 , with @xmath110 , are the kaluza - klein modes of @xmath111 .",

    "this lie algebra is indeed @xmath114 ( the @xmath115 generators @xmath116 being @xmath117 antihermitian matrices that are linear independent ) . similarly we rewrite the gauge field @xmath118 as @xmath119 and interpret it as a @xmath114 valued gauge field on @xmath17 , and similarly for @xmath120 . finally @xmath121 is the trace over @xmath122 matrices in the fundamental representation .    up to now",
    "we have just performed a ordinary fuzzy dimensional reduction . indeed in the commutative case the expression ( [ theymaction ] ) corresponds to rewriting the initial lagrangian on @xmath123 using spherical harmonics on @xmath22 . here",

    "since @xmath30 acts on the fuzzy sphere @xmath124 , and more in general the group @xmath3 acts on the fuzzy coset @xmath20 , we can state the csdr principle in the same way as in the continuum case , i.e. the fields in the theory must be invariant under the infinitesimal @xmath30 , respectively @xmath3 , action up to an infinitesimal gauge transformation @xmath125 @xmath126 where @xmath62 is the one - form gauge potential @xmath127 , and @xmath128 depends only on the coset coordinates @xmath92 and ( like @xmath129 ) is antihermitian . we thus write @xmath130 where @xmath131 are hermitian generators of @xmath89 and @xmath132 , here @xmath133 is hermitian conjugation on the @xmath92 s .    in terms of the covariant coordinate @xmath134 and of @xmath135 the csdr constraints assume a particularly simple form , namely @xmath136 = 0,\\ ] ] @xmath137.\\ ] ] in addition we have a consistency condition following from the relation @xmath138= c_{\\hat{a}\\hat{b}}^{~~\\hat{c}}{\\cal{l}}_{\\hat{c}}$ ] : @xmath139 = c_{\\hat{a } \\hat{b}}^{\\ \\ \\hat{c } } \\omega_{c},\\ ] ] where @xmath50 transforms as @xmath140 one proceeds in a similar way for the spinor fields @xcite .",

    "the functions @xmath160 are arbitrary functions of @xmath18 but the @xmath19 dependence is such that @xmath160 is @xmath161 valued instead of @xmath145 , i.e. eventually we have a four - dimensional gauge potential @xmath162 with values in @xmath161 . concerning the constraint ( [ eq7 ] ) , it is satisfied by choosing @xmath163 i.e. the unconstrained degrees of freedom correspond to the scalar field @xmath164 which is a singlet under the four - dimensional gauge group @xmath156 .",
    "the choice ( [ embedding ] ) defines one of the possible embedding of @xmath146 in @xmath145 .",
    "for example we could also embed @xmath146 in @xmath145 using the irreducible @xmath29-dimensional rep .",
    "of @xmath30 , i.e. we could identify @xmath165 .",
    "the constraint ( [ 3.19 ] ) in this case implies that the four - dimensional gauge group is @xmath86 so that @xmath162 is @xmath86 valued . the constraint ( [ eq7 ] )",
    "leads again to the scalar singlet @xmath164 .",
    "in general , we start with a @xmath86 gauge theory on @xmath166 .",
    "we solve the csdr constraint ( [ 3.17 ] ) by embedding @xmath30 in @xmath157 .",
    "there exist @xmath167 embeddings , where @xmath168 is the number of ways one can partition the integer @xmath29 into a set of non - increasing positive integers @xcite .",
    "then the constraint ( [ 3.19 ] ) gives the surviving four - dimensional gauge group .",
    "the constraint ( [ eq7 ] ) gives the surviving four - dimensional scalars and eq .",
    "( [ soleasy ] ) is always a solution but in general not the only one . by setting @xmath169",
    "we obtain always a minimum of the potential .",
    "this minimum is given by the chosen embedding of @xmath30 in @xmath157 .",
    "non - commutative geometry has been regarded as a promising framework for obtaining finite quantum field theories and for regularizing quantum field theories . in general quantization of field theories on non - commutative spaces",
    "has turned out to be much more difficult and with less attractive ultraviolet features than expected @xcite , see however ref .",
    "@xcite , and ref .",
    "recall also that non - commutativity is not the only suggested tool for constructing finite field theories . indeed",
    "four - dimensional finite gauge theories have been constructed in ordinary space - time and not only those which are @xmath170 and @xmath171 supersymmetric , and most probably phenomenologically uninteresting , but also chiral @xmath172 gauge theories @xcite which already have been successful in predicting the top quark mass and have rich phenomenology that could be tested in future colliders @xcite . in the present work we have not adressed the finiteness of non - commutative quantum field theories ,",
    "rather we have used non - commutativity to produce , via fuzzy - csdr , new particle models from particle models on @xmath173 .",
    "the fuzzy - csdr has different features from the ordinary csdr leading therefore to new four - dimensional particle models .",
    "it may well be that fuzzy - csdr provides more realistic four - dimensional theories .",
    "having in mind the construction of realistic models one can also combine the fuzzy and the ordinary csdr scheme , for example considering @xmath174 .",
    "a major difference between fuzzy and ordinary scdr is that in the fuzzy case one always embeds @xmath3 in the gauge group @xmath5 instead of embedding just @xmath4 in @xmath5 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the differential calculus on the fuzzy coset space is based on @xmath175 derivations instead of the restricted @xmath176 used in the ordinary one . as a result the four - dimensional gauge group @xmath177 appearing in the ordinary csdr after the geometrical breaking and before the spontaneous symmetry breaking due to the four - dimensional higgs fields does not appear in the fuzzy - csdr . in fuzzy - csdr",
    "the spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism takes already place by solving the fuzzy - csdr constraints .",
    "the four - dimensional potential has the typical `` maxican hat '' shape , but it appears already spontaneously broken",
    ". therefore in four dimensions appears only the physical higgs field that survives after a spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "correspondingly in the yukawa sector of the theory we have the results of the spontaneous symmetry breaking , i.e. massive fermions and yukawa interactions among fermions and the physical higgs field .",
    "having massive fermions in the final theory is a generic feature of csdr when @xmath3 is embedded in @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "we see that if one would like to describe the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the sm in the present framework , then one would be naturally led to large extra dimensions .",
    "a fundamental difference between the ordinary csdr and its fuzzy version is the fact that a non - abelian gauge group @xmath5 is not really required in high dimensions .",
    "indeed the presence of a @xmath86 in the higher - dimensional theory is enough to obtain non - abelian gauge theories in four dimensions .",
    "the final point that we would like to stress here is the question of the renormalizability of the gauge theory defined on @xmath178 .",
    "first we notice that the theory exhibits certain features so similar to a higher - dimensional gauge theory defined on @xmath8 that naturally it could be considered as a higher - dimensional theory too .",
    "for instance the isometries of the spaces @xmath8 and @xmath179 are the same",
    ". it does not matter if the compact space is fuzzy or not .",
    "for example in the case of the fuzzy sphere , i.e. @xmath180 , the isometries are @xmath181 as in the case of the continuous space , @xmath182 .",
    "similarly the coupling of a gauge theory defined on @xmath8 and on @xmath183 are both dimensionful and have exactly the same dimensionality . on the other hand",
    "the first theory is clearly non - renormalizable , while the latter is renormalizable ( in the sense that divergencies can be removed by a finite number of counterterms ) .",
    "so from this point of view one finds a partial justification of the old hopes for considering quantum field theories on non - commutative structures .",
    "if this observation can lead to finite theories too , it remains as an open question .",
    "we would like to thank l. castellani and h. steinacker for useful discussions .",
    "two of us , ( j.m . ) and ( g.z . ) , would like to thank the organizers of the iii summer school in modern mathematical physics , zlatibor , serbia , 20 - 31.08.2004 , for the very warm hospitality .",

    "<S> we then perform a generalized  la forgacs - manton dimensional reduction . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize some striking features emerging such as ( i ) the appearance of non - abelian gauge theories in four dimensions starting from an abelian gauge theory in higher dimensions , ( ii ) the fact that the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the theory takes place entirely in the extra dimensions and ( iii ) the renormalizability of the theory both in higher as well as in four dimensions . </S>"
