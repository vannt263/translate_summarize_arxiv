    "i have been asked to describe quantum fluctuations in cosmology , which i find a fascinating topic .",
    "it is a dramatic demonstration that the quantum theory that was developed by studying the hydrogen atom can be applied on larger and larger scales .",
    "here we are applying quantum theory to the universe in its entirety , at time scales of order @xmath0 second , and it all sounds incredibly fantastic .",
    "but the shocking thing is that it works , at least in the sense that it gives answers for important questions that agree to very good precision with what is actually measured .",
    "in addition to discussing the density perturbations that we can detect , however , i want to also discuss another important aspect of quantum fluctuations : specifically , quantum fluctuations in cosmology appear , in almost all our models , to lead to eternal inflation and an infinite multiverse .",
    "this is a rather mind - boggling concept , but given our success in calculating the fluctuations observed in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , it should make good sense to consider the other consequences of quantum fluctuations in the early universe .",
    "thus , i think it is time to take the multiverse idea seriously , as a real possibility .",
    "the inhomogeneities that lead to eternal inflation are nothing more than the long - wavelength tail of the density perturbations that we see directly in the cmb .",
    "the idea that quantum fluctuations might be the origin of structure in the universe goes back at least as far as a 1965 paper by sakharov  @xcite . in the context of inflationary models , the detailed predictions are model - dependent , but a wide range of simple models give generic predictions which are in excellent agreement with observations . in this section",
    "i will give a pedagogical explanation of how these predictions arise , based on the time - delay formalism that was used in the paper i wrote with s .- y .",
    "pi  @xcite .",
    "this formalism , which we learned from stephen hawking , is the simplest to understand , and it is completely adequate for the dominant perturbations in single - field , slow - roll inflation .",
    ", has not ( to my knowledge ) been confirmed in any modern paper .",
    "however , the fact that @xmath1 is proportional to @xmath2 has been confirmed , showing that the 1981 paper by mukhanov and chibisov did correctly calculate what we now call @xmath3 ( as was pointed out in ref .  ) . ]",
    "more sophisticated approaches are needed , however , to study multifield models or models that violate the slow - roll approximation , or to study extremely subdominant effects in single - field , slow - roll models . even for multifield inflation , however , some of the simplicity of the time - delay formalism can be maintained by the use of the so - called @xmath4 formalism  @xcite .",
    "there are a number of reviews  @xcite and textbooks  @xcite that give a much more thorough discussion of density perturbations in inflationary models than is appropriate here .",
    "inflation  @xcite takes place when a scalar field has a large potential energy density . a straightforward application of noether s theorem  @xcite gives the energy - momentum tensor of a canonically normalized scalar field as @xmath5 where @xmath6 where @xmath7 .",
    "so , as long as the energy of the state is dominated by @xmath8 , guarantees that the pressure is large and negative .",
    "einstein s equations imply that negative pressure creates repulsive gravity , so any state whose energy is dominated by the potential energy of a scalar field will drive inflation .",
    "there are two basic scenarios  one where @xmath9 starts at the top of a hill ( new inflation  @xcite ) , and one where it starts high on a hill and rolls down ( chaotic inflation  @xcite ) ; see .",
    "either scenario is successful , and for the density perturbation calculation we can treat them at the same time .",
    "we use comoving coordinates , with a background metric describing a flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the scale factor .",
    "objects moving with the expansion of the universe are at rest in this coordinate system , with the expansion described solely by @xmath11 : when @xmath11 doubles , all the distances in the universe double . in this metric the klein - gordon equation for a scalar field is given by @xmath12 where an overdot indicates differentiation with respect to time @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the laplacian , @xmath15 , with respect to the coordinates @xmath16 .",
    "the equation is identical to the klein - gordon equation in minkowski space , except that there is a drag term , @xmath17 , which can be expected , since the energy density must fall if the universe is expanding .",
    "in addition , each spatial gradient is modified by @xmath18 , which converts the derivative to the current scale of spatial distance .",
    "the hubble expansion rate @xmath19 is given by the friedmann equation for a flat universe , @xmath20 in this language , the repulsive effect of the negative pressure that was mentioned above can be seen in the equation for the acceleration of the expansion , @xmath21 if @xmath22 , as one finds when @xmath8 dominates , this equation gives @xmath23 .",
    "using an assumption called the slow - roll approximation , which is valid for a large range of inflationary models , we can ignore the @xmath24 term of and the @xmath25 term in .",
    "in addition , at sufficiently late times the laplacian term can be neglected , since it is suppressed by @xmath26 .",
    "we are then left with a very simple differential equation , @xmath27 which has a one - parameter class of solutions . that one parameter is itself trivial",
    " it is a time offset .",
    "given one solution @xmath28 , the general solution can be written as @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is independent of @xmath13 . since the differential equation ( [ ahg : eq9 ] ) has no spatial derivatives , @xmath30 can depend on position , so the most general solution can be written as @xmath31 since we are interested in developing a first order perturbation theory , we can expand about @xmath28 , @xmath32 so @xmath33 even though the numerator and denominator of the above expression both depend on time , the quotient does not . thus at late times ( within the inflationary era )",
    " times late enough for to be accurate  the nonuniformities of the rolling scalar field are completely characterized by a time - independent time delay.the description of the perturbations at late times by a time - independent time delay @xmath34 is in fact much more robust than the approximation that @xmath24 can be neglected .",
    "it is a consequence of the hubble drag term , and will hold at sufficiently late times in any single - field model for which the slow - roll approximation is valid for more than a few @xmath35-folds . to see this , consider , with @xmath36 taken to be an arbitrary function of @xmath9 and @xmath37 .",
    "we will neglect the laplacian term , since it is suppressed by @xmath26 , and we are interested in late times .",
    "then , for each value of @xmath38 there is a two - parameter class of solutions to this second order ordinary differential equation . to see the effect of the damping , suppose that we know the unperturbed solution , @xmath28 , and a nearby solution , @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is to be treated to first order",
    "@xmath41 can depend on @xmath38 , but we suppress the argument because we consider one value of @xmath38 at a time .",
    "we then find that @xmath40 and @xmath42 obey the same differential equation .",
    "if we construct the wronskian @xmath43 , we find that @xmath44 the solution to which is @xmath45 thus @xmath46 falls off roughly as @xmath47 or faster ( @xmath48 ) , and so can be neglected after just a few @xmath35-folds of expansion . then note that @xmath49 while in the slow - roll regime @xmath50 is approximately constant  from one can show that the fractional change in @xmath50 during one hubble time ( @xmath51 ) is approximately @xmath52 , as defined in eqs .",
    "( [ ahg : eq14 ] ) and ( [ ahg : eq15 ] ) . thus the time derivative of the ratio @xmath53 falls off as @xmath54 or faster , implying that the time delay rapidly approaches a fixed value .",
    "the time - delay description remains accurate throughout the reheating process , even though the slow - roll conditions will generally fail badly at the end of inflation , when the scalar field starts to oscillate about the bottom of the potential well .",
    "the time delay is maintained because @xmath41 and @xmath55 continue to obey the same linear differential equation .",
    "thus if @xmath56 at the end of the slow roll period , then @xmath41 will remain proportional to @xmath55 for all later times . this argument , which generalizes an argument in ref .",
    ", is in contradiction with ref .",
    ", where it is argued that the time delay persists to the end of inflation only under very stringent assumptions about the potential . the argument of ref .  , however , is really a discussion of the validity of , but we have seen that the time delay is preserved even when fails . ]",
    "it is useful to define a dimensionless measure of the time delay , @xmath57 which can be interpreted as the number of @xmath35-folds of inflation by which the field is advanced or retarded .    to justify the slow - roll approximation , we must adopt restrictions on the form of the potential energy function @xmath8 .",
    "the slow - roll approximation is equivalent to saying that the field @xmath9 evolves approximately at the drag - force limited velocity , where the drag force equals the applied force , with inertia playing only a negligible role .",
    "( this would be called the terminal velocity , except that it can change slowly with time . ) from the first two terms of one can see that the velocity approaches the drag - limited value with a time constant of order @xmath51 .",
    "thus , for the field to evolve at the drag - limited velocity , it is essential that neither the drag coefficient nor the applied force changes significantly during a time of order @xmath51 .",
    "thus we want to insist that @xmath58 , and that @xmath59 . using to approximate @xmath60 ,",
    "these two conditions can be expressed in terms of the two slow - roll parameters  @xcite @xmath61 where a prime denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath9 .",
    "note that these slow - roll conditions do not by themselves guarantee that @xmath9 will evolve at drag - limited velocity , because a large initial velocity will take time before it approaches the drag - limited value .",
    "but the slow - roll conditions do guarantee that for times long compared to @xmath51 , @xmath9 will evolve at very nearly the drag - limited velocity .",
    "[ ahg : fig2 ]    to proceed , i will make two approximations that will simplify the problem enormously , but which are nonetheless extremely accurate for single - field slow - roll inflation .",
    "first , we will neglect all perturbations of the metric until the time when inflation ends .",
    "that is , until inflation ends we treat the scalar field as a quantum field in a fixed de sitter space background .",
    "thus , we will be ignoring the fluctuations in the energy - momentum tensor of the scalar field , since we are not allowing them to perturb the metric .",
    "however , we will calculate the fluctuations in the scalar field itself , as described by the time delay @xmath62 . since the scalar field is driving the inflation , the time delay @xmath34 measures the variation in the time at which inflation ends at different places in space .",
    "the amount of energy that is released at the end of inflation is much larger than the energy - momentum tensor fluctuations during inflation , so the spatial variation of the timing of this energy release becomes the dominant source of the density perturbations that persist at later times . to describe this release of energy ,",
    "we make our second approximation .",
    "we will treat the ending of inflation as instantaneous .",
    "we will assume that the potential energy of the inflaton field is converted instantaneously into the thermal radiation of effectively massless particles , beginning the radiation - dominated era of cosmological history .",
    "i will give heuristic justifications for these approximations , but i am not aware of a more rigorous justification that can be explained without developing an understanding of what happens when these approximations are avoided , and then the problem requires a much more detailed analysis .",
    "such analyses have of course been done and are even described in textbooks .",
    "the answer that we will obtain agrees with the textbooks  @xcite , for the single - field slow - roll case , down to the last factor of @xmath63 . while the textbooks corroborate the answer that we will obtain , the methods are sufficiently different so that very little light is shed on the approximations described here . in a future publication@xcite ,",
    "i will attempt a more detailed justification .    for a given theory we can calculate @xmath28 by solving an ordinary differential equation ,",
    "so reduces the problem of calculating @xmath34 to that of calculating the fluctuations of the scalar field , @xmath64 .",
    "this is a problem in quantum field theory , albeit quantum field theory in curved spacetime .",
    "the calculations closely resemble the familiar quantum field theory calculations for minkowski space , but there is one point in the calculation where cosmology rears its head .",
    "while minkowski space has a well - defined vacuum state , which is the starting point for most calculations , it is less clear what quantum state should be used to describe the fields evolving in de sitter space , where the time dependence prevents the existence of a conserved total energy . in principle the quantum state is determined by the initial conditions for the universe , about which we know very little . however , while we do not know the quantum state of the early universe , there is a very natural choice , corresponding at least locally to the concept of a vacuum state . to understand this choice , recall that we are interested in an exponentially expanding space , the de sitter spacetime of inflation , so to a good approximation @xmath65 , where @xmath36 is constant .",
    "if we now treat the inflaton field @xmath66 as a quantum operator , we can as usual consider its fourier transform : @xmath67 for a free quantum field theory in minkowski spacetime , @xmath68 would be the sum of an annihilation operator term for particles of momentum @xmath69 and a creation operator term for particles of momentum @xmath70 , each corresponding to a de broglie wavelength @xmath71 . for an frw spacetime ,",
    "since the fourier transform is defined in terms of the _ comoving _ coordinates @xmath38 , the physical wavelength for a mode @xmath69 is not constant , but is given by @xmath72 in other words , each mode is stretched as the universe expands .",
    "thus , if we follow any mode backwards in time , it will have a shorter and shorter wavelength and a higher and higher frequency .",
    "the hubble expansion rate @xmath36 is approximately constant during inflation , so at very early times @xmath36 is very small compared to the frequency , and hence is negligible .",
    "thus , any given mode behaves at asymptotically early times exactly like a mode in minkowski space , so the `` natural '' initial state is to simply start each mode in its minkowski vacuum state in the asymptotic past .",
    "this is called the bunch ",
    "davies vacuum  @xcite , and it is identical to what is also called the gibbons  hawking vacuum  @xcite .",
    "gibbons and hawking developed their description of the vacuum in a completely different formalism , based on the symmetries of the de sitter spacetime ( with @xmath73 ) , but the two vacuum states are identical , as one would hope . the bunch ",
    "davies / gibbons  hawking vacuum is taken as the starting point for all standard calculations of density perturbations .    to discuss the spectrum of fluctuations of a spatially varying quantity such as @xmath64 , which is assumed to be statistically homogeneous and isotropic , cosmologists define a power spectrum @xmath74 by defined in ref .",

    "the distinction between @xmath102 and a few hubble times later is important only at higher order in the slow - roll approximation , since the change in @xmath103 over a hubble time is of order @xmath104 .",

    "we are now in a position to test the consistency of the first of our approximations ( see ) , the approximation of neglecting the fluctuations in the scalar field energy - momentum tensor .",

    "is finished  it determined the power spectrum of the time delay .",
    "the rest of the calculation is general relativity and astrophysics . here",
    "i will continue the derivation through the end of inflation , which carries it far enough to compare with the literature and to at least qualitatively understand the observational consequences .    to understand the implications of @xmath34 in the cosmic evolution as described by",
    ", it is convenient to switch to a new coordinate system in which the end of inflation happens at @xmath109 everywhere .",
    "just define @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "clearly @xmath112 , so the transformation of the metric of becomes @xmath113 , where @xmath114 with an inverse metric , to first order in @xmath30 , given by @xmath115 in the primed coordinates the phase transition happens sharply at @xmath116 , with a sudden change from @xmath117 in the inflationary phase to @xmath118 in the radiation phase . during the inflationary phase",
    "the energy - momentum tensor is simply @xmath119 , while after the transition it is given by .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor must be covariantly conserved , which means that @xmath120 where @xmath121 denotes a covariant derivative .",
    "the affine connection coefficients @xmath122 will not contain any @xmath123-functions , so @xmath124 can not contain any @xmath123-functions either ; thus @xmath125 must be continuous at @xmath116 .",
    "this implies that @xmath126 the second of these equations can only be satisfied if @xmath127 , because @xmath128 can not vanish , as @xmath129 is timelike , and @xmath130 can not vanish without violating the first equation .",
    "thus , the radiation fluid is necessarily at rest in the frame of reference in which the phase transition occurs simultaneously . requiring @xmath131",
    ", one finds that @xmath132 given the above equation , leads immediately to @xmath133 ; the energy density is conserved across the transition . since the einstein equations are partial differential equations that are second order in time derivatives , the metric and its first time derivative will be continuous across @xmath116 .",
    "so we have now found all the information needed to give a well - defined cauchy problem for the evolution of the model universe , starting at the beginning of the radiation - dominated era . at this point",
    "the perturbations of interest have wavelengths vastly larger than the hubble length , but during the subsequent evolution the hubble length will grow faster than the perturbation wavelength , so later the perturbations will come back inside the hubble length . the description of the perturbations through the time of hubble reentry was given in refs .",
    " , and in many later sources , but for present purposes we will stop here .",
    "at this point we can discuss the validity of the second of our key approximations , the approximation of an instantaneous phase transition .",
    "the actual transition , during which the scalar field rolls down the hill in the potential energy diagram and then oscillates about the minimum and reheats , very likely takes many hubble times to complete .",
    "however , we need to keep in mind that the modes of interest exited the hubble horizon some 50 or 60 hubble times before the end of inflation , which means that at the end of inflation their physical wavelength is of order @xmath134 to @xmath135 , or @xmath136 to @xmath137 , times the hubble length .",
    "thus , even if the phase transition takes @xmath138 hubble times , during this time light would be able to travel less than @xmath139 wavelengths .",
    "thus the phase transition is effectively instantaneous , on the time scale that is relevant for influencing a wave with the wavelengths under consideration .",
    "( of course the reheat energy density that we calculated , @xmath140 , was an artificiality of the instantaneous approximation .",
    "but the calculation can easily be adjusted to account for a lower reheat energy density , which can be found by doing a more accurate , homogeneous calculation . at the end of inflation",
    "we would still obtain , in the primed coordinate system , a radiation fluid that is at rest , with a uniform energy density . )",
    "note that the method used here depended crucially on the assumption that all parts of the universe would undergo the same sequence of events , so that the only difference from one place to another is an overall time offset .",
    "if there were more than one field for which the quantum fluctuations were relevant , then this would not be true , since a fluctuation of one field relative to the other could not be described as an overall time offset .",
    "thus , multifield inflation requires a more sophisticated formalism .",
    "the description we have given so far , specifying the metric and the matter content , is sufficient to calculate the rest of the history , but it is rather complicated .",
    "furthermore , it is equivalent to many other complicated descriptions , related by coordinate transformations .",
    "it is therefore very useful to find a coordinate - invariant way of quantifying the density perturbations .",
    "one convenient approach is motivated by considering the friedmann equation for a universe with spatial curvature , a universe which might be closed , open , or in the borderline case , flat : @xmath141 here @xmath142 is a constant , where positive values describe a closed universe , and negative values describe an open one .",
    "we are interested in describing a perturbation of a homogeneous background universe that is flat , @xmath143 .",

    "( [ ahg : eq14 ] ) and ( [ ahg : eq15 ] ) is replaced by a factor of @xmath195 , one sees that the slow roll parameters are plausibly of order 1/60 .    the case @xmath196 is called scale - invariant , because it means that @xmath197 is independent of @xmath142 ; that is , each mode has the same strength , at the time of hubble exit , as any other mode .",
    "since @xmath197 is constant while the wavelength is long compared to the hubble length , all modes also have the same strength at the time of hubble reentry .",
    "single - field inflation produces density fluctuations that are approximately scale - invariant , because all the modes that are visible today passed through hubble exit during a small interval of time during inflation , so the conditions under which they were generated were very similar .",
    "in addition to the nearly scale - invariant spectrum that we just calculated , there are two other key features of the density fluctuations that follow as a consequence of slow - roll single - field inflation .",
    "the first is that the fluctuations are adiabatic , which means that every component of the matter in the universe  the photons , the baryons , and the dark matter  fluctuate together .",
    "the temperature can be related to the density of photons , so it also fluctuates with the density baryons or dark matter .",
    "the reason for this feature is clear , because the time delay affects all properties of the matter in the universe the same way .",
    "until the perturbations reenter the hubble length ( after which complicated things can happen ) , every region of space behaves just like any other region of space , except for a time offset .",
    "thus the matter content of any one region can differ from that of some other region by at most an adiabatic compression or expansion .",
    "the wmap team  @xcite has tested this relation for the possibility of non - adiabatic fluctuations between photons and cold dark matter . by combining wmap data with other data , they find at the 95% confidence level that the non - adiabatic component is at most 6% of the total in the case of `` axion - type '' perturbations , or 0.4% in the case of `` curvaton - type '' perturbations .",
    "the other key predication of slow - roll single - field inflation is that the perturbations should be gaussian . why are they gaussian ?",
    "they are gaussian because @xmath198 is calculated in a quantum field theory .",
    "the perturbations are small so we expect accurate results at lowest order , which means that we are only calculating free - field - theory expectation values , and they are gaussian .",
    "there are of course higher order corrections , which in a given model can also be calculated , but they are generically very small .",
    "so , to first approximation , we expect the answers to be gaussian , which means in particular that the three - point correlation function should vanish .",
    "there has been a lot of effort to look for non - gaussianity , but so far no convincing evidence for non - gaussianity has been found .",
    "the calculations shown here stop just after the end of inflation , but with a lot of work by many astrophysicists the calculations have been extended to make detailed predictions for the fluctuations that can be detected today in the cosmic microwave background .",
    "the success is beautiful . to process the data , the temperature pattern observed in the cmb",
    "is expanded in spherical harmonics , which is the spherical equivalent of fourier transforming , providing information about how the intensity of the fluctuations varies with angular wavelength .",
    "figure  [ ahg : fig3 ]  @xcite shows the observed temperature fluctuations as a function of the multipole number @xmath199 , using the 7-year wmap data  @xcite for @xmath200 , and acbar data  @xcite for higher @xmath199 .",
    "the red line is the theoretical curve that comes about by extending the inflationary predictions to the present day in a model with dark energy ( @xmath201 ) and cold dark matter , using the best - fit parameters found by the wmap team  @xcite : @xmath202 , @xmath203 , @xmath204 , @xmath205 , @xmath206 , and @xmath207 , where @xmath208 is the optical depth experienced by the photons since the `` recombination '' of the primordial plasma at about 380,000 years after the big bang .",
    "while there are 6 free parameters , 4 of them have values that are expected on the basis of theory ( @xmath209 ) or other observations ( @xmath210 , @xmath211 , and @xmath212 ) , and they agree well .",
    "one of the free parameters determines the overall height , so one should not be impressed that the height of the primary peak matches so well .",
    "but the location , shape , and relative heights of the peaks are really being predicted by the theory , so i consider it a spectacular success .    for comparison , the graph also shows predictions for several alternative theories , all of which are now ruled out by this data .",
    "the yellow line shows the expected curve for an open universe , with @xmath213 .",
    "the green line shows an inflationary model with @xmath214 , but with @xmath215 and no dark energy .",
    "the magenta line shows the expectations for fluctuations generated by the formation of cosmic strings in the early universe , taken from ref .  .",
    "structure formation caused by cosmic strings or other `` defects '' was considered a viable possibility before this data existed , but now cosmic strings are completely ruled out as a major source of density fluctuations .",
    "( there are possibly alternative ways to generate density perturbations with the same properties as those of inflation , but there is not yet a consensus about how easy it is to construct a plausible model .",
    "the cyclic ekpyrotic model  @xcite was claimed to naturally produce such fluctuations , but these claims were disputed by a number of authors  @xcite .",
    "now at least some of the founders of ekpyrosis  @xcite agree that the original models do not give a nearly - scale invariant spectrum , as had been claimed .",
    "but these papers and others have proposed newer , more sophisticated versions of bouncing universes , generally involving either multiple fields , or settling for scale invariance for only a limited range of scales .",
    "baumann , senatore , and zaldarriaga  @xcite have argued that any single - field model with attractor behavior has to be very close to de sitter space to remain weakly coupled for at least the required @xmath21610 @xmath35-folds needed to account for observations . )",
    "there are still a number of important , outstanding questions concerning density perturbations :    will @xmath217-modes be found ?",
    "experiments are starting to measure the polarization of the cmb , for which the spherical harmonic expansion for the temperature pattern is replaced by an expansion in @xmath218-modes and @xmath217-modes  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath218-modes are those that can be expressed as gradients of scalar harmonic functions , and they are produced as a by - product of the density perturbations that we have been discussing .",
    "the @xmath217-modes are orthogonal to the @xmath218-modes ; they can not be expressed as gradients of scalar modes , and they can not be produced by density perturbations .",
    "there can be foreground contamination , but the only known primordial source of @xmath217-modes is a background of gravitational waves .",
    "thus , gravity waves might be discovered in the cmb before they can be seen directly .",
    "the discovery of a primordial gravity wave background would be very exciting , because it is the only thing that will give us a clue about the energy scale at which inflation happened .",
    "as far as we know now inflation might have happened anywhere from the electroweak scale up to the grand unified theory ( gut ) scale , or a little beyond .",
    "the discovery of gravity waves would end the uncertainty , and would also give strong evidence for the inflationary picture .",
    "there are , however , many inflationary models for which the energy scale would be too low for the gravitational waves to be visible .    can sub - planckian physics influence the calculation of inflationary density perturbations ?",
    "a typical gut - scale inflationary model would include about 60 @xmath35-folds of inflation , expanding by a factor of @xmath219 . from the end of inflation to today the universe would expand by another factor of @xmath220 .",
    "this means that a distance scale of 1 m today corresponds to a length of only about @xmath221 m at the start of inflation , 18 orders of magnitude smaller than the planck length ( @xmath222 m ) . with a little more than the minimal amount of inflation",
    " which would be a certainty in the eternal inflation picture to be discussed below  even the largest scales of the visible universe would have been sub - planckian at the start of inflation .",
    "so , it is relevant to ask whether inflation can possibly offer us a glimpse of sub - planckian physics .",
    "there is of course no solid answer to this question , since there is no real understanding of how this process should be described .",
    "kaloper , kleban , lawrence , and shenker  @xcite have argued that the perturbations are determined primarily by local effective field theory on the scale of order @xmath36 , so that sub - planckian effects would be invisible except possibly in unconventional models for which the fundamental string scale is many orders of magnitude below the four - dimensional planck mass , @xmath223 gev .",
    "some authors  @xcite have reached similar conclusions , but other authors  @xcite have concluded that the effects might be much easier to see .",
    "the conclusions of ref .   seem plausible to me , but certainly the role of sub - planckian physics is not yet fully understood .",
    "will effects beyond the single - field slow - roll approximation be found ? with multiple fields , or with unusual features in the potential for a single field , models can be constructed that predict significant non - gaussianity , non - adiabaticity , or spectral distortions .",
    "there is an active industry engaged in studying models of this sort , and in looking for these nonstandard features in the data .",
    "the wmap seven - year analysis  @xcite reports `` no convincing deviations from the minimal model , '' but we all await the data from the planck mission , expected in less than a year , and the data from a variety of ground - based experiments .",
    "since the density perturbation calculations have been incredibly successful , it seems to make sense to take seriously the assumptions behind these calculations , and follow them where they lead .",
    "i have to admit that there is no clear consensus among cosmologists , but to many of us the assumptions seem to be pointing to eternal inflation , and the multiverse .    the mechanism for eternal inflation is described most efficiently by separating the cases of the two types of potential functions shown in fig .",
    "[ ahg : fig1 ] . for the new inflation case ,",
    "that state for which the scalar field is poised on the top of the potential hill is a metastable state , often called a `` false vacuum , '' which decays by the scalar field rolling down the hill .",
    "this state decays exponentially , but in any working model of inflation the half - life of the decay is much longer than the doubling time associated with the exponential expansion .",
    "thus , if we follow a region for a period of one half - life , at the end of the period only half of the original region would be still be inflating .",
    "however , the half that is still inflating will have a volume vastly larger than the volume of the entire region at the start , so the process will go on forever .",
    "each decay will lead to the production of a `` pocket '' universe , and the creation of pocket universes will go on forever , as pieces of the ever - growing false vacuum region undergo decays .",
    "once inflation starts , it never stops .    for the case of a chaotic - type potential , as in fig .",
    "[ ahg : fig1](b ) , naively one would think that the field would inexorably roll down the hill in some finite amount of time .",
    "however , linde  @xcite discovered that when quantum fluctuations are taken into account , this need not be the case . to understand this , consider an inflating region of space of size @xmath51 , with the inflaton field @xmath9 approximately uniform over this region , at some value @xmath103 .",
    "after one hubble time ( @xmath51 ) the region will have expanded by @xmath224 , and can be viewed as 20 hubble - sized regions which will start to evolve independently .",
    "the average field @xmath9 in any one of these regions will usually be lower than @xmath103 , due to the classical rolling down the hill , but the classical evolution will be modified by random quantum jumps , which can be estimated as @xmath225 .",
    "it is therefore possible that in one or more of these 20 regions , @xmath9 can equal or exceed @xmath103 .",
    "a back - of - the - envelope calculation shows that if @xmath226 then the expectation value for the number of regions with @xmath227 is greater than one .",
    "that implies that the number of hubble - sized regions with @xmath227 will grow exponentially with time , and the inflation becomes eternal .",
    "note that @xmath228 , so the eternally inflating behavior is really the large-@xmath9 , long - wavelength , tail of the density perturbation spectrum . since @xmath229 grows without bound as @xmath230 for most potentials under consideration ,",
    "almost all models allow for eternal inflation .",
    "there is certainly no proof that we live in a multiverse , but i will argue that there are three winds  that is , three independent scientific developments , arising from three different branches of science  which seem to be leading to the multiverse picture .      _",
    "string theory : the landscape .",
    "_ string theory predicts that there is not just one kind of vacuum , but instead there are a colossal number of them : @xmath231 or maybe more  @xcite .",
    "the underlying laws of physics would be the same everywhere , but nonetheless each type of vacuum would create an environment in which the low - energy laws of physics would be different . thus ,",
    "if there is a multiverse , it would be a varied multiverse , in which the different pocket universes would each appear to have their own laws of physics .",
    "_ observational astronomy : the cosmological constant . _",
    "the third `` wind '' has its roots in the fine - tuning that our universe appears to exhibit . in the past",
    "a minority of physicists argued that things such as the properties of ice or the energy levels of carbon-12 appeared to be fine - tuned for the existence of life , but not very many scientists found this convincing .",
    "if these properties were different , then maybe life would form some other way .",
    "however , a form of fine - tuning that many of us find much more convincing became evident starting in 1998 , when two groups of astronomers  @xcite announced that the expansion of the universe is not slowing down due to gravity , but is in fact accelerating .",
    "the simplest explanation is that the acceleration is caused by a nonzero energy density of the vacuum , also known as a cosmological constant .",
    "but that would mean that the vacuum energy density is nonzero , yet a full 120 orders of magnitude smaller than the planck scale ( @xmath232 , where @xmath233 ) , the scale that most theoretical physicists would consider natural .",
    "physicists have struggled to find a physical explanation for this small vacuum energy density , but no generally accepted solution has been found .",
    "but if the multiverse is real , the problem could go away .",
    "with @xmath231 different types of vacuum , a small fraction , but nonetheless a large number of them , would be expected to have an energy density as small as what we observe .",
    "the smallness of the vacuum energy density would be explained , therefore , if we could explain why we should find ourselves in such an unusual part of the multiverse .",
    "but as pointed out by weinberg and collaborators  @xcite some time ago , there is a selection effect .",
    "if we assume that life requires the formation of galaxies , then one can argue that life in the multiverse would be concentrated in those pocket universes with vacuum energy densities in a narrow band about zero .",
    "thus , while a typical vacuum energy density in the multiverse would be on the order of the planck scale , almost all life in the multiverse would find a small value , comparable to what we see .    while the multiverse picture looks very plausible in the context of inflationary cosmology  at least to me  it raises a thorny and unsolved problem , known as the `` measure problem . ''",
    "specifically , we do not know how to define probabilities in the multiverse . if the multiverse picture is right , then anything that can happen will happen an infinite number of times , so any distinction between common and rare events requires the comparison of infinities .",
    "such comparisons are not mathematically well - defined , so we must adopt a recipe , or `` measure , '' to define them . since the advent of quantum theory essentially all physical predictions have been probabilistic , so probability is not a concept that we can dispense with . to date",
    "we do not understand the underlying physical basis for such a measure , but much progress has been made in examining proposals and ruling out many of them .",
    "one might guess that this problem is easily handled by choosing a finite sample spacetime region in the multiverse , calculating the relative frequencies of different types of occurrences in the sample region , and then taking the limit as the region becomes infinite .",
    "this seems like a very reasonable approach , and in fact most of the measure proposals that have been discussed are formulated in this way .",
    "the problem is that the answers one obtains are found to depend sensitively on the method that is used to choose the sample region and to allow it to grow .",
    "the dependence on the method of sampling seems surprising , but it sounds plausible if we remember that the volume of the multiverse grows exponentially with time .",
    "a sample spacetime region will generally have some final time cutoff , and the spacetime volume will generally grow exponentially with the cutoff .",
    "but then , no matter how large the cutoff is taken , the volume will always be dominated by a region that is within a few time constants of the final time cutoff hypersurface .",
    "no matter how large the final time cutoff is taken , the statistics will never be dominated by the interior of the sample region , but instead instead will be dominated by the final time cutoff surface . for that reason , it is not surprising that the method of choosing this surface will always affect the answers .",
    "there are a number of important questions , in the multiverse picture , that depend very crucially on the choice of measure .",
    "how likely is it that we observe a vacuum energy density as low as what we see ?",
    "how likely is it that our universe has a mass density parameter @xmath234 sufficiently different from 1 that we can hope to measure the difference ?",
    "how likely is it that we might find evidence that our pocket universe collided with another sometime in its history ? and , if there are many vacua in the landscape of string theory with low energy physics consistent with what we have measured so far , how likely is it that we will find ourselves in any particular one of them ?",
    "if we live in a multiverse , then in principle all probabilities would have to be understood in the context of the multiverse , but it seems reasonable to expect that any acceptable measure would have to agree to good accuracy with calculations that we already know to be successful .    as discussed in ref .",
    ", we can identify a class of measures that give reasonable answers .",
    "it seems plausible that the ultimate solution to this problem will give similar answers , but the underlying principles that might determine the right answer to this question remain very mysterious .",
    "nonetheless , the success of inflation in explaining the observed properties of the universe , including the density perturbation predictions discussed here , provides strong motivation to expect that some solution to the measure problem will be found .",
