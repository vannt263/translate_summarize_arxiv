    "in the field of turbulence , a significant effort has been devoted to the analysis of the scaling behavior of structure functions @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the longitudinal velocity increment between two points separated by a variable distance @xmath4 @xcite . however",
    ", a better strategy may be to concentrate on the probability density functions ( pdfs ) of @xmath3 , rather than on a set of moments @xcite .",
    "accordingly , this work deals with the description of the pdfs of @xmath3 , where the scale @xmath4 spans the entire range of excited scales of motion ( from the integral far down to the dissipative scales ) .",
    "experimental and numerical observations have provided the evidence that the pdfs of @xmath3 are increasingly stretched as @xmath4 decreases , while they are almost gaussian at the large scales where the turbulence is stired @xcite .",
    "this feature is known as intermittency .",
    "moreover , chevillard _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have recently argued that this stretching is largely enhanced in the near - dissipation range , leading to extremely high fluctuation level for the velocity gradients .",
    "another essential feature lies in the significant asymmetry , or skewness , of the pdfs .",
    "this skewness to be non - zero is heuristically connected to the vortex folding and stretching ( irreversible ) process , which drains energy from the large to the small scales , and hence , plays a central role in turbulence . from a theoretical viewpoint ,",
    "a quantitative description of the skewness is still missing . in this context ,",
    "our motivation is to present a synthetic description of the pdfs of @xmath3 , which encompasses the combined effects of intermittency and skewness .",
    "to do so , the pdf of @xmath3 is split into a symmetric @xmath5 and an asymmetric @xmath6 part .",
    "first , the focus is on @xmath5 , which also represents the pdf of the magnitude of @xmath3 .",
    "we show that @xmath7 is suitably described by a multifractal picture of turbulence dynamics @xcite , which incorporates finite - reynolds - number effects .",
    "the analysis is then extended to @xmath6 with the specific goal to describe the skewness phenomenon via a quantitative estimate of the skewness factor @xmath8 as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "from a general point of view , the pdf of the longitudinal velocity increments @xmath9 can be split into a symmetric @xmath10 ( i.e. even ) function and an asymmetric @xmath11 ( i.e. odd ) function in the following way : @xmath12 the pdf of the longitudinal velocity increment magnitude @xmath13 shows that the symmetric part of the pdf of @xmath3 describes the magnitude statistics .",
    "notice that neither @xmath7 nor @xmath6 can be interpreted as a pdf of a random variable .",
    "let us first focus on the symmetric part of the pdfs of the longitudinal velocity increments @xmath14 . in the inertial range ,",
    "the multifractal formalism @xcite , which a priori pertains in the limit of infinite reynolds number , states that velocity is everywhere singular , the longitudinal velocity increments at scale @xmath4 behaving locally as @xmath15 , where the h@xmath16lder exponent @xmath17 takes value in a finite interval @xmath18 $ ] .",
    "when the reynolds number @xmath19 is finite ( @xmath20 is the correlation length scale , @xmath21 and @xmath22 the kinematic viscosity ) , paladin and vulpiani @xcite have argued that the dissipative scale , that is supposed to separate the inertial and the dissipation scaling ranges , is not unique in the presence of intermittency and is likely to depend on @xmath17 . using these arguments ,",
    "nelkin @xcite predicted the moments of velocity gradients , i.e. @xmath23 . the phenomenological consequences on the energy power spectrum were studied by frisch and vergassola @xcite who proved the existence of an intermediate dissipative range .",
    "meneveau @xcite further investigated the behavior of the structure functions in that transitory range .",
    "recently , chevillard _ et al . _",
    "@xcite revisited the behavior of longitudinal velocity increments in the intermediate dissipative range and showed , among other new predictions , that the width @xmath24 $ ] of this range of scales behaves non trivially with the reynolds number , i.e. @xmath25 .    to provide a complete statistical description of longitudinal velocity increments statistics , one needs to model the probability law of the stochastic variable @xmath26 . as originally proposed by castaing _",
    "@xcite , within the propagator approach , velocity increments magnitude can be considered as the product of two independent random variables , @xmath27 ( in law ) , where @xmath28 is a zero - mean gaussian random variable of variance @xmath29 and @xmath30 a positive random variable ( see @xcite for details ) . in the inertial range ,",
    "i.e. @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the fluctuating dissipative scale , @xmath33 can be expressed as a function of the singularity strength @xmath17 that fluctuates from point to point according to the probability law @xmath34 .",
    "note that the exponent @xmath17 and the parameter function @xmath0 gain the mathematical status of h@xmath16lder exponent and singularity spectrum in the inviscid limit ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the dissipative scale @xmath32 fluctuates according to : @xmath36 , where the constant @xmath1 is necessary to be consistent with experimental and numerical data @xcite .",
    "more precisely , in a monofractal description of velocity fluctuations ( kolmogorov k41 theory @xcite ) , one can show @xcite that the kolmogorov constant @xmath37 . actually in this simplified monofractal framework",
    ", the average local dissipation @xmath38 can be related to the ratio @xmath39 ( where @xmath40 is the taylor based reynolds number ) .",
    "we will see in the following that the data are compatible with the universal value @xmath41 ( in the presence of intermittency ) .    for scales",
    "@xmath42 , the velocity is smooth and taylor s development applies , i.e. @xmath43 . in the multifractal description , using a simple continuity argument with the inertial range behavior @xcite yields @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "then , we impose that the function @xmath30 be continuous and differentiable at the transition , following a strategy already used in a slightly different form in ref .",
    "@xcite , and which is inspired from an elegant interpolation formula originally proposed by batchelor @xcite , independently derived in a field theoretic approach @xcite . in this framework",

    "( [ eq : betah ] ) and ( [ eq : phmeneeul ] ) , one can derive analytical predictions for the moments of the longitudinal velocity increment modulus , i.e. @xmath51 , the energy power spectrum ( which is linked to the fourier transform of the second order moment @xcite ) and the symmetric part of the longitudinal velocity increments pdf .",
    "this approach has also been successfully applied in the lagrangian framework in which the pdfs are symmetric @xcite .    as advocated in ref .",

    "when both the cumulants and @xmath56 are renormalized by @xmath57 , all the curves collapse on a universal linear function in the inertial range ( when @xmath58 , see @xcite ) of slope @xmath59",

    "@xmath69 crosses over towards trivial scaling ; the straight line of slope unity observed at smaller scales means that velocity increments become proportional to the scale ( taylor development ) .",
    "the behavior of the second - order cumulant is much more interesting and has been widely studied in ref .",
    "@xcite : a non trivial reynolds dependent rapid increase occurs in the intermediate dissipative range , the larger the reynolds number , the more  rapid \" the increase .",
    "finally , @xmath70 tends toward a universal value in the far - dissipative range .",

    "the different curves so - obtained superimpose remarkably well with the corresponding data for the first two cumulants which demonstrates that our multifractal description accounts quantitatively well for the departure from scaling in the intermediate dissipative range .",
    "finite reynolds number effects @xcite , statistical convergence and lognormal approximation can explain some discrepancies between our theoretical prediction and the behavior of the third - order cumulant .",
    "let us now investigate the statistics of signed longitudinal velocity increments through the two estimators : ( i ) the skewness @xmath84 and ( ii ) the asymmetry factor @xmath85 and @xmath86 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : asym ] in a semi - logarithmic representation .",
    "interestingly , @xmath87 displays a plateau at about 0.14 in the inertial range , whereas the skewness behaves approximatively as a power law . in the intermediate dissipative range ,",

    "[ fig : cumul](b ) . from a theoretical point of view",

    "@xcite without taking into account the intermittency corrections .",

    "( [ eq : karhow ] ) , we get @xmath101 and @xmath102 , in perfect agreement with experimental findings .",
    "some discrepancies occur for @xmath103 , especially for modane s longitudinal velocity profile , because ( i ) of the lack of statistics and ( ii ) at these scales , one has to take into account in eq .",

    "we derive in the appendix [ appeskew ] the multifractal prediction for the third order moment of the velocity gradient @xmath104 . experimentally speaking , measuring gradients",

    "we hope that further experimental studies will provide definite test of the validity of our predictions .",
    "these preliminary tests are nevertheless very satisfactory .",
    "let us finally elaborate a formalism to describe the pdf of the signed longitudinal velocity increments .",
    "to do so , we suggest to model the ( signed ) longitudinal velocity increments in the following way : @xmath105 ( in law ) , where the positive random variable @xmath30 is unchanged but @xmath106 is now an independent zero mean random variable of variance @xmath29 , whose probability @xmath107 a priori depends on the scale @xmath4 .",
    "it follows that @xmath108 according to the edgeworth s development @xcite , any pdf can be decomposed over a  basis \" of the successive derivatives of a gaussian function : @xmath109     pdfs of signed longitudinal velocity increments of air jet @xcite ( a - c ) and modane @xcite ( d - f ) velocity signals for various scales .",

    "all curves are arbitrarily vertically shifted for the sake of clarity .",
    "the solid curves correspond to our theoretical predictions ( see text).,width=340 ]    the symmetric part ( even terms ) of the pdf of @xmath106 , i.e. @xmath115 , is well described by a gaussian @xmath28 noise ( as previously stated ) , which means that @xmath116 and @xmath117 for @xmath118 and every scale @xmath4 .",
    "furthermore , it can be demonstrated that whatever @xmath29 is , @xmath119 .",
    "hence , @xmath120 is fully determined by the krmn - howarth - kolmogorov equation ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : karhow ] ) ) . as eq .",
    "( [ eq : karhow ] ) is the only available constraint on @xmath121 , it is quite natural ( as a first approximation ) to restrict the expansion to @xmath122 : @xmath123 for @xmath124 and every scale @xmath4 .",
    "additional statistical equations involving odd moments of @xmath3 would be needed to give the next @xmath125 .",
    "this would require further modeling ( primarily to get ride of pressure terms ) , which is out of the scope of the present work .",
    "unfortunately , the previous crude approximation for the odd terms of ( [ eq : edge ] ) leads to severe pathologies , such as negative probability for rare large @xmath106 events and is not consistent with higher - order statistics as hyperskewness @xmath126 ( data not shown ) .",
    "nevertheless , since the third - order structure function does not depend on the precise variance @xmath29 entering in the third order derivative of the gaussian pdf , we propose to renormalize the variance @xmath29 of the retained odd term ( @xmath127 ) : @xmath128 .",

    "to conclude , we have shown that the evolution across scales of the signed longitudinal velocity increments statistics , from the inertial far down the dissipative ranges , depends only on a universal parameter function @xmath0 and a universal constant @xmath1 that must be seen as a multifractal version of the kolmogorov constant .",
    "in particular , neglecting the intermittency corrections , we provide an enhanced phenomenology of turbulence in deriving the value of the skewness @xmath133 in the inertial range .",
    "we have further shown that choosing a quadratic form for @xmath0 ( i.e. the hallmark of an underlying lognormal cascading process ) provides a very good quantitative description of the longitudinal velocity increments pdfs measured in several flows , in different geometries and for different reynolds numbers .",
