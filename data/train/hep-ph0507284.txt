    "supersymmetry ( susy ) and extra dimensions offer two different paths to a theory of new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "they both address the hierarchy problem , play a role in a more fundamental theory aimed at unifying the sm with gravity , and offer a candidate particle for dark matter , compatible with present cosmology data .",
    "if either supersymmetry or extra dimensions exist at the tev scale , signals of new physics should be found by the atlas and cms experiments at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern .",
    "however , as we discuss below in section  [ sec : hadron ] , the proper interpretation of such discoveries may not be straightforward at the lhc and may require the complementary data from an @xmath0 collider such as clic  @xcite .    a particularly interesting scenario of tev - size extra dimensions is offered by the so called universal extra dimensions ( ued ) model , originally proposed in  @xcite , where all sm particles are allowed to freely propagate into the bulk .",
    "the case of ued bears interesting analogies to supersymmetry and sometimes has been referred to as `` bosonic supersymmetry '' @xcite . in principle , disentangling ued and supersymmetry appears highly non - trivial at hadron colliders  @xcite . for each sm particle ,",
    "both models predict the existence of a partner ( or partners ) with identical interactions .",
    "unfortunately , the masses of these new particles are model - dependent and can not be used to unambiguously discriminate between the two theories - parity @xcite are reminiscent of ued , and they may also be confused with supersymmetry . ] .",
    "both theories have a good dark matter candidate  @xcite and the typical collider signatures contain missing energy .",
    "one would therefore like to have experimental discriminators which relies on the fundamental distinctions between the two models . in what follows",
    "we shall discuss methods for experimental discrimination between susy and ued . in section  [ sec : hadron ]",
    "we discuss the case of hadron colliders  @xcite , while in section  [ sec : clic ] we consider a future high energy @xmath0 collider  @xcite .",
    "one of the characteristic features of ued is the presence of a whole tower of kaluza - klein ( kk ) partners , labelled by their kk level @xmath1 .",
    "in contrast , @xmath2 supersymmetry predicts a single superpartner for each sm particle .",
    "one might therefore hope to discover the higher kk modes of ued and thus prove the existence of extra dimensions . however , there are two significant challenges along this route .",
    "first , the masses of the higher kk modes are ( roughly ) integer multiples of the masses of the @xmath3 kk partners , and as a result their production cross - sections are kinematically suppressed .",
    "second , the @xmath4 kk particles predominantly decay to @xmath3 kk modes , which amounts to a small correction to the inclusive production of @xmath3 kk particles . just as in the case of susy , because of the unknown momentum carried away by the dark matter candidate at the end of the decay chain , one is unable to reconstruct individual kk resonances .",
    "the only exceptions are the level @xmath5 kk gauge bosons , which may appear as high mass dijet or dilepton resonances , when they decay directly to sm fermions through loop suppressed couplings  @xcite .",
    "we studied the prospects for observing the inclusive production of level 2 gauge bosons in ued at the tevatron and the lhc  @xcite .",
    "we concentrate on the case of @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( the level 2 kk partners of the @xmath8-boson and the photon , correspondingly ) , which give clean dilepton signatures .",
    "( in contrast , the discovery of the level 2 kk gluon @xmath9 in a dijet channel appears very challenging . ) in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : reach_b2 ] we show the @xmath10 discovery reach of the tevatron and the lhc for @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "( the reach for @xmath6 is very similar . )",
    "we studied both dielectron and dimuon final states , and we plot the required total integrated luminosity in @xmath11 as a function of the inverse size of the extra dimension @xmath12 .",
    "we see that already with 10 @xmath11 of data ( one year of low - luminosity running ) the lhc will be able to cover all of the cosmologically preferred parameter space of the ued model  @xcite .",
    "we also see that , just like in supersymmetry , there is a significant improvement of the reach once one considers indirect production of the @xmath7 kk particle , due to @xmath4 kk quark decays .",
    "unfortunately , even if the @xmath7 and @xmath6 are discovered , they may still be misinterpreted as ordinary @xmath13 gauge bosons in extended supersymmetric models .",
    "it is therefore necessary to get an independent confirmation of the discovery of an extra dimension by other means .",
    "the second fundamental distinction between ued and supersymmetry is reflected in the properties of the individual particles : the kk partners have identical spin quantum numbers as their sm counterparts , while the spins of the superpartners differ by @xmath14 unit .",
    "however , spin determinations appear to be difficult at the lhc ( or at hadron colliders in general ) , where the center of mass energy in each event is unknown . in addition , the momenta of the two dark matter candidates in the event are also unknown .",
    "recently it has been suggested that a charge asymmetry in the lepton - jet invariant mass distributions from a particular cascade , can be used to discriminate susy from the case of pure phase space decays  @xcite and is an indirect indication of the superparticle spins .",
    "it is therefore natural to ask whether this method can be extended to the case of susy versus ued discrimination .    to answer this question",
    ", we first choose a study point in ued with @xmath15 gev .",
    "then we adjust the relevant mssm parameters until we get a matching spectrum .",
    "following  @xcite , we concentrate on the cascade decay @xmath16 in susy and the analogous decay chain @xmath17 in ued  @xcite . both of these processes",
    "are illustrated in fig .",

    "the comparison between the case of ued and susy  @xcite is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : reach_b2 ] .",
    "we see that although there is some minor difference in the shape of the asymmetry curves , overall the two cases appear to be very difficult to discriminate unambiguously , especially since the regions near the two ends of the plot , where the deviation is the largest , also happen to suffer from poorest statistics .",
    "these results have been recently confirmed in  @xcite .",
    "in order to contrast susy and ued at lepton colliders , we consider an identical final state in each case : @xmath20 and missing energy .",
    "this signature may arise either from kk muon production in ued @xmath21 or from smuon pair production in supersymmetry : @xmath22 again , we choose a ued study point with @xmath15 gev , and adjust the susy parameters until the two spectra match . for definiteness",
    "we fix the collider center - of - mass energy at @xmath23 tev as is the case of clic .",
    "distributions ( [ ang_ued ] ) and ( [ ang_susy ] ) are sufficiently distinct to discern the two cases . however , the polar angles @xmath26 of the original kk - muons and smuons are not directly observable and the production polar angles @xmath27 of the final state muons are measured instead . but as long as the mass differences @xmath28 and @xmath29 respectively remain small , the muon directions are well correlated with those of their parents ( see figure  [ fig : ang]a ) . in fig .  [",
    "fig : ang]b we show the same comparison after detector simulation and including the sm background .",
    "the angular distributions are well distinguishable also when accounting for these effects .",
    "it is also clear that the total cross - section in each case is very different and provides an alternative discriminator between the models .",
    "the characteristic end - points of the muon energy spectrum are completely determined by the kinematics of the two - body decay and do not depend on the underlying framework ( susy or ued ) as long as the spectra are tuned to be identical .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : emu ] ( we use the same parameters as in fig .  [",
    "fig : ang ] ) , where we show the isr - corrected distributions for the muon energy spectra at the generator level ( left ) and after detector simulation ( right ) .",
    "the lower , @xmath30 , and upper , @xmath31 , endpoints of the muon energy spectrum are related to the masses of the particles involved in the decay according to the relation : @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the smuon and lsp masses and @xmath35 with @xmath36 is the @xmath37 boost . in the case of the ued the formula is completely analogous with @xmath38 replacing @xmath39 and @xmath40 replacing @xmath34 .    due to the splitting between the @xmath41 and @xmath42 masses in mssm and that between the @xmath43 and @xmath44 masses in ued , in fig .",
    "[ fig : emu ] we see the superposition of two box distributions .",
    "the left , narrower distribution is due to @xmath45 pair production in ued ( @xmath46 pair production in supersymmetry ) .",
    "the underlying , much wider box distribution is due to @xmath47 pair production in ued ( @xmath48 pair production in supersymmetry ) .",
    "the upper edges are well defined , with smearing due to beamstrahlung and , but less importantly , to momentum resolution .",
    "nevertheless , there is sufficient information in this distribution to extract the mass of the @xmath49 particle , given the values of the @xmath43 and @xmath44 masses , which in turn can be obtained by a threshold scan .      with the @xmath0 colliding at a fixed center - of - mass energy above the pair production threshold , a significant fraction of the kk muon production will proceed through radiative return .",
    "since this is mediated by @xmath50-channel narrow resonances , a sharp peak in the photon energy spectrum appears whenever one of the mediating @xmath50-channel particles is on - shell . in case of supersymmetry , only @xmath8 and @xmath51 particles can mediate smuon pair production and neither of them can be close to being on - shell . on the contrary ,",
    "an interesting feature of the ued scenario is that @xmath52 production can be mediated by @xmath6 and @xmath7 exchange .",
    "since the decay @xmath53 is allowed by phase space , there will be a sharp peak in the photon spectrum , due to a radiative return to the @xmath6 .",
    "the photon peak is at @xmath54 on the other hand , @xmath55 , so that the decay @xmath56 is closed , and there is no radiative return to @xmath7 .      the photon energy spectrum in @xmath57 for @xmath58 gev , @xmath59 and @xmath60 tev is shown in fig .  [ fig : egamma ] .",
    "on the left we show the isr - corrected theoretical prediction from comphep  @xcite while the result on the right in addition includes detector and beam effects .",
    "it is clear that the peak can not be missed .",
