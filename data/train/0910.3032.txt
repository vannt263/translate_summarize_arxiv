    "<S> the channeling of the recoiling nucleus in crystalline detectors after a wimp collision would produce a larger scintillation or ionization signal in direct detection experiments than otherwise expected . </S>",
    "<S> i present estimates of the importance of this effect for the total direct detection rate and the daily modulation of the signal using analytic models produced in the 1960 s and 70 s to describe the effects of channeling and blocking in crystals .    channeling and blocking effects in crystals refer to the orientation dependence of positively charged ion penetration in crystals  @xcite . in the  channelling effect \" ions incident upon a crystal along symmetry axis and planes </S>",
    "<S> suffer a series of small - angle scattering that maintain them in the openchannels \" in between the rows or planes of lattice atoms and thus penetrate much further into the crystal than in other directions . </S>",
    "<S> channeled incident ions do not get close to lattice sites , where they would experience large - angle scatterings . the  blocking effect \" consists in a reduction of the flux of ions originating in lattice sites along symmetry axis and planes , creating what is called a  blocking dip \" in the ions exiting from a thin enough crystal as function of the angle with respect to the symmetry axis or plane . </S>",
    "<S> these effects were first observed in the 1960 s and are currently extensively used in crystallography , in the study of lattice disorder , ion implantation , surfaces , interfaces and epitaxial layers , short nuclear lifetimes etc .    </S>",
    "<S> the channeling effect in nai ( tl ) was first observed in 1973 by altman _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite who proved that channeled ions produce more scintillation light . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is that they loose most of their energy via electronic stopping rather than nuclear stopping . in 2007 </S>",
    "<S> drobyshevski  @xcite and the dama collaboration  @xcite pointed out the relevance of this effect for direct detection experiments using nai ( tl ) crystals : when na or i ions recoiling after a collision with a wimp move along crystal axes and planes , their quenching factor is approximately @xmath0 instead of @xmath1 and @xmath2 . in 2008 </S>",
    "<S> avignone , creswick and nussinov  @xcite raised the prospect of a daily modulation of the dm signal in direct detection due to channeling . </S>",
    "<S> in fact earth s daily rotation makes the wimp wind change direction with respect to the crystal , which produces a daily modulation in the measured recoil energy ( equivalent to a modulation of the factor @xmath3 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> my collaborators , nassim bozorgnia and paolo gondolo , and i  @xcite are using classical analytic models of channeling developed in the 1960 s and 70 s , in particular lindhard s model  @xcite to calculate the fraction of channeled ions as function of their energy and the expected daily modulation amplitudes due to channelling in nai , si and ge . </S>",
    "<S> the results presented here are preliminary .    </S>",
    "<S> we use the continuum string and plane model , in which the screened thomas - fermi potential is averaged over a direction parallel to a row or a plane . </S>",
    "<S> this averaged potential @xmath4 is considered to be uniformly smeared out along the row or plane of atoms , what is a good approximation if the propagating ion interacts with many lattice atoms in the row or plane by a correlated series of many consecutive glancing collisions with lattice atoms . </S>",
    "<S> just one row , or one plane , is considered . </S>",
    "<S> we use the  radon transform \" of the wimp velocity distribution ( a truncated maxwellian ) to write the ion recoil momentum spectrum in terms of the average velocity of the wimp s with respect to the laboratory , the velocity dispersion and escape speed  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we orient the crystal with respect to the galaxy and use the hierarchical equal area isolatitude pixelization ( healpix ) method  @xcite to compute the integrals over the recoil direction . </S>",
    "<S> the healpix method uses an algorithm to deal with the pixelization of data on a sphere ( used e.g. by cosmic microwave background experiments ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is useful to compute integrals over direction by dividing the surface of a sphere into many pixels , computing the integrand at each pixel ( i.e. each direction , see fig .  1 ) and finally summing up the value of all pixels over the sphere .    </S>",
    "<S> our temperature dependent analytic results reproduce the channeled fraction of incoming na ions as function of their energy given by the dama collaboration  @xcite ( which does not include temperature effects ) , even with dechanneling effects included ( shown in fig .  2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we included only the dechanneling due to the first interaction with tl doping atoms . </S>",
    "<S> a naive geometrical blocking brings our fractions to zero at very small energies in fig .  2 . </S>",
    "<S> in these calculations , however , the fact that the recoiling nuclei originate in lattice sites ( and are not incident upon the crystal ) thus blocking effects are important , was not properly taken into account .     </S>",
    "<S> preliminary results for the fraction of channeled na and i ions incident upon a nai crystal , including dechanneling , compared with the dama estimate ( in black ) . ]     preliminary results for the fraction of channeled na and i ions incident upon a nai crystal , including dechanneling , compared with the dama estimate ( in black ) . ]     </S>",
    "<S> an example of the dependence of the daily modulation amplitude due to channeling as function of the wimp velocity dispersion in the standard halo ( changed to arbitrary unphysical values ) . ]     an example of the dependence of the daily modulation amplitude due to channeling as function of the wimp velocity dispersion in the standard halo ( changed to arbitrary unphysical values ) . ]    </S>",
    "<S> as argued originally by lindhard  @xcite , in a perfect lattice and in the absence of energy - loss processes the probability of a particle starting from a lattice site to be channeled would be zero . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known in statistical mechanics that the probability of particle paths related by time reversal is the same . in optics , </S>",
    "<S> if a source of radiation and a point of observation are interchanged , the intensity of the light measured at the new place of observation is the same as the old . in the same way , </S>",
    "<S> if the probability of an incoming channeled ion to get very close to a lattice site ( where it would suffer a large angle scattering ) is zero ( channeled ions only undergo small angle correlated scatterings ) , the probability of the same ion moving in the time - reversal path , i.e. starting at a nuclear site and ending going out of the crystal in a path parallel to a channel , is zero too ( this is lindhard s _  rule of reversibility \" _ ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , any departure of the actual lattice from a perfect lattice , e.g. due to vibrations of the atoms in the lattice , violates the conditions of this argument and allow for some of the recoiling lattice nuclei to be channeled .    </S>",
    "<S> the channeling of particles emitted at lattice sites , such as protons scattered at large angles , due to lattice vibrations was measured and already understood in the 70 s  @xcite . due to lattice vibrations </S>",
    "<S> the recoiling nucleus has a probability ( which we take to be gaussian ) of being at a certain distance of the row of plane of atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the higher the temperature the higher the probability that the recoil starts outside a lattice site . </S>",
    "<S> we use the method of komaki and fujimoto  @xcite to compute the fraction of channeled recoils . </S>",
    "<S> they use the conservation of transverse energy of the recoiling ion with initial energy @xmath5 , @xmath6 , valid in the continuum approximation . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath7 is the angle between the tangent of the trajectory and the crystal axis and @xmath8 is the recoil momentum after the collision . </S>",
    "<S> they distinguish two types of trajectories : those which can pass over the potential barrier @xmath9 separating two parallel channels in the crystal ( thus particles would not be trapped within one channel ) and those which can not pass over the barrier and are , thus , channeled . using this approach , and taking @xmath9 to be the value of the potential at the thomas - fermi screening distance </S>",
    "<S> , we preliminary find the fractions of channeled ions shown in fig .  3 , which clearly increase with increasing temperature .    finally , we find that the amplitude of the daily modulation of the signal depends strongly on the velocity dispersion of wimps ( see fig .  4 ) and for the standard halo model is smaller than 0.1% </S>",
    "<S> . however it may be much larger for possible halo components with a smaller velocity dispersion , such as a thick disk .    </S>",
