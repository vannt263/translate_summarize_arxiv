    "the algebraic classification of symmetric second - order tensors locally defined on a 4-dimensional lorentzian manifold , such as the ricci tensor @xmath1 , the einstein tensor @xmath2 and the energy - momentum tensor @xmath3 , is known as segre classification  @xcite . the major idea underlying most of classifications in science is the concept of equivalence .",
    "clearly the objects may be classified in different ways according to the criteria one chooses to group them into equivalence classes .",
    "there are , however , criteria that prove to be more important than others .",
    "the great appeal of segre classification in general relativity is that it incorporates , ab initio , the lorentzian character of spacetime .",
    "it is of interest in several contexts such as , for example , in understanding purely geometrical features of space - times @xcite , in classifying and interpreting matter fields in general relativity @xcite and in higher dimensional theories  @xcite ( e.g. , 5-d brane - worlds  @xcite ) or still as part of the procedure for checking whether apparently different space - times are in fact locally the same up to coordinate transformations ( equivalence problem  @xcite ) . because of einstein s equations @xmath4 the einsten tensor ( and so @xmath1 ) has the same algebraic classification as the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "this can be used to decide , on base of generic features such as the segre class , which energy - momentum tensors do couple to a given geometry .",
    "a great deal of difficulty in segre classifying second order tensors in the context of general relativity is that while @xmath2 and @xmath1 are universal functions of the space - time geometry , @xmath3 depends on the symmetries of the model as well as on the particular type or combination of matter fields present in the cosmological scenario . in this regard ,",
    "a powerful way of imposing physical constraints and searching realistic forms for the energy - momentum tensor is through cosmological observations .",
    "the high degree of isotropy observed in the cosmic microwave background radiation @xcite , for instance , restricts the general form of @xmath3 while results from distance measurements using type ia supernovae ( which constitute the most direct evidence for the current cosmic acceleration ) @xcite impose important constraints on the physical quantities of the cosmic fluid .    in light of an impressive convergence of observational results ,",
    "several groups have recently tested the viability of different matter fields ( or , equivalently , different forms of @xmath3 ) as a realistic description for the matter content of our universe .",
    "the two favorite candidates are the energy density stored on the true vacuum state of all existing fields in the universe , i.e. , the cosmological constant ( @xmath5 ) and the potential energy density @xmath0 associated with a dynamical scalar field @xmath6 , usually called dynamical dark energy ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a recent review on this topic ) .",
    "physically , the role of such a dynamical dark energy can be played by any scalar field violating the so - called strong energy condition ( see sec .",
    "iii for a discussion ) .",
    "two possibilities , however , have been exhaustively explored in the current literature , namely , quintessence scalar fields with positive kinetic term and an equation - of - state parameter @xmath7 @xcite , and phantom fields with negative kinetic term and @xmath8 @xcite . in terms of the parameter @xmath9 , the former case can be seen as a very general scenario , which includes cold dark matter models with a cosmological constant ( @xmath10cdm ) , @xmath11 , and cosmologies dominated by topological defects ( e.g. , domain walls , strings and textures ) for which @xmath12 , @xmath13 being the dimension of the defect . the latter case in turn",
    "is characterized by strange properties such as , for instance , the fact that its energy density increases with the expansion of the universe ( in contrast with quintessence fields ) ; the possibility of a rip - off of large and small scale structures of matter ; a possible occurrence of future curvature singularity , etc . @xcite .",
    "although having these unusual characteristics , a phantom type behavior is predicted by several scenarios , e.g. , kinetically driven models @xcite and some versions of brane world cosmologies @xcite . from the observational point of view , phantom dark energy is found to be compatible with most of the classical cosmological tests and provide a better fit to type ia supernovae observations than do @xmath10cdm or quintessence scenarios ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "therefore this means that , although exotic , phantom fields may be the dominant form of energy in our universe .    in this paper",
    "we examine the invariant characterization for the energy - momentum tensor of phantom fields through the segre algebraic classification in the framework of general relativity . in sec .",
    "ii , by using real null tetrad technique , we show that phantom fields can be classified in two different subclasses of equivalence which are represented by segre types @xmath15 $ ] and @xmath16 $ ] . in sec .",
    "iii we present the so - called energy conditions of general relativity for the whole segre class @xmath17 $ ] and also examine the further restrictions they impose on the values of the phantom field potential @xmath0 .",
    "we end this paper by summarizing the main results in the conclusion section .",
    "a classification of a generic symmetric second order tensor @xmath3 can be cast in terms of the eigenvalue problem @xmath18 where @xmath19 are eigenvalues , @xmath20 are eigenvectors , and the mixed tensor @xmath21 may be thought of as a linear map @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath23 is a real 4-dimensional space - time manifold locally endowed with a lorentzian metric of signature @xmath24 , @xmath25 denotes the tangent space to @xmath23 at a point @xmath26 and latin indices range from 0 to 3 .",
    "because of the lorentzian character of the metric the mixed form of the energy - momentum tensor is no more symmetric and @xmath27 may not have a diagonal matrix representation , i.e. , it need not have four linearly independent eigenvectors .",
    "however , using the _ jordan canonical forms _ of the matrix of an operator , and imposing the lorentzian character of the metric on @xmath23 , it has been shown  @xcite ( for detailed calculations in @xmath28 dimensional space - times and a review on this topic see  @xcite ) that any energy - momentum tensor defined on @xmath25 reduces to one of the four canonical forms : @xmath29   & t_{ab } = & 2\\,\\sigma_1\\,l_{(a}m_{b ) } + \\sigma_2\\,(l_{a}l_{b } + m_{a}m_{b } ) \\\\ &   & + \\sigma_3\\,x_{a}x_{b }   +   \\sigma_4\\,y_{a}y_{b }    \\\\ \\\\ { [ } 211 ]   & t_{ab } = & 2\\,\\sigma_1\\,l_{(a}m_{b ) } \\pm l_{a}l_{b } + \\sigma_2\\,x_{a}x_{b } \\\\ &   & + \\sigma_3\\,y_{a}y_{b }    \\\\ \\\\ { [ } 31 ]    & t_{ab } = & 2\\,\\sigma_1\\,l_{(a}m_{b ) } + 2\\,l_{(a}x_{b ) } + \\sigma_1\\,x_{a}x_{b } \\\\ &   & + \\sigma_2\\,y_{a}y_{b }   \\\\ \\\\ { [ } z\\,\\bar{z}\\,11 ] & t_{ab } = & 2\\,\\sigma_1\\,l_{(a}m_{b ) } + \\sigma_2\\,(l_{a}l_{b } - m_{a}m_{b } ) \\\\ &   & + \\sigma_3\\,x_{a}x_{b } + \\sigma_4\\,y_{a}y_{b}\\ ; , \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 , having different values for different formulae , and in the segre class @xmath31 $ ] @xmath32 .",
    "in the above `` catalog '' the first column is the notation commonly used for indicating the segre class , which is a list @xmath33 $ ] of the dimensions of the jordan blocks of the corresponding jordan canonical matrix .",
    "the basis vectors @xmath34 form a real null tetrad basis such that the only nonvanishing inner products are @xmath35 this basis is constructed from the preferred directions intrinsically defined by the tensor , i.e. , from the jordan basis .",
    "the segre class @xmath17 $ ] distinguishes tensors that have diagonal matrix representation and is the unique that admit a timelike eigenvector .",
    "the comma in this case is used to separate timelike from spacelike eigenvectors .",
    "regardless of the dimension of a jordan block , there is only one eigenvector associated to each block , and the eigenvector associated to a block of dimension @xmath36 is a null vector  @xcite .",
    "energy - momentum tensors which belong to segre class @xmath37 $ ] , for example , have only three linearly independent eigenvectors ( one of which is a null vector ) , and its characteristic polynomial obtained from ( [ eigenprob ] ) has three roots : one of multiplicity 2 and the others of multiplicity 1 .",
    "so , the digits inside the brackets give also the multiplicity of the real eigenvalues , the complex one being taken into account by segre class @xmath31 $ ] , where the @xmath38 refers to a pair of complex eigenvalues .",
    "degeneracy amongst eigenvalues in different jordan blocks will be indicated by enclosing the corresponding digits inside round brackets , as in @xmath15 $ ] , which indicate that three out of the four eigenvalues are degenerate .",
    "so , to each segre class there may be several subclasses depending on the degeneracies of the eigenvalues .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor for the phantom field has the form  @xcite @xmath39\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath0 is the phantom potential , @xmath40 and the semicolon denotes covariant derivative .",
    "here we assume that @xmath41 is a function of time alone evolving in an isotropic and homogeneous space - time , so @xmath42 , that is , @xmath43 is a time - like vector ( indeed an eigenvector of @xmath3 ) . in this case",
    "it is always possible to find out two null vectors @xmath44 and @xmath45 such that @xmath46 , and @xmath47 can be written as @xmath48 besides , we choose two spacelike vectors @xmath49 and @xmath50 , belonging to the 2-space orthogonal to the 2-space generated by @xmath44 and @xmath45 , so as to form the real null tetrad basis @xmath34 defined by ( [ inerp ] ) . in terms of this basis the metric tensor is written as @xmath51 where the round brackets indicates symmetrization .",
    "taking into account equations ( [ timelike ] ) and ( [ metric ] ) , the canonical form for the energy - momentum tensor ( [ phantom - stress ] ) is then written as @xmath52 where @xmath53 indicating that phantom fields belong to segre class @xmath17 $ ] ( see eq .",
    "( [ segre - classes ] ) ) for @xmath54 . in order to find the subclasses we now determine its eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors . for the sake of brevity we present our results without going into details of calculations , which can be easily verified from equation ( [ phantom - segre ] ) and the expressions below .",
    "we find that the set of linearly independent eigenvectors and associated eigenvalues of @xmath21 is given by @xmath55\\\\ l^{a } + m^{a } \\ ; \\longrightarrow & - [ \\frac{1}{2}\\dot{\\phi}^2 + v(\\phi ) ]   \\\\          x^{a } \\ ; \\longrightarrow & - [ \\frac{1}{2}\\dot{\\phi}^2 + v(\\phi ) ] \\\\",
    "y^{a } \\ ; \\longrightarrow & - [ \\frac{1}{2}\\dot{\\phi}^2 + v(\\phi ) ] \\ , . \\end{array}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that three out of the four eigenvalues are degenerate , making it apparent that the corresponding segre subclass is @xmath15 $ ] .",
    "this is the same segre type as that for a perfect fluid  @xcite ( we shall comment this latter ) .",
    "we emphasize that this classification is independent of the functional form of the potential @xmath0 as well as the time derivative @xmath56 except for @xmath57cte . in this latter case",
    "the segre subclass for the phantom field is @xmath16 $ ] with @xmath58 a four - time - degenerate eigenvalue .",
    "this is the same segre subclass of energy - momentum tensors of @xmath59term type ( cosmological constant )  @xcite .",
    "since a @xmath59term can always be incorporated into an energy - momentum tensor of the perfect fluid , we shall banish this subclass from further consideration .",
    "in this section we investigate possible constraints that the classical energy conditions may impose on the values of the potential @xmath0 as well as on @xmath56 for phantom fields .",
    "restrictions imposed by energy conditions on energy - momentum tensors of general relativity theory for matter fields like those represented by segre classes @xmath37 $ ] , @xmath60 $ ] and @xmath61 $ ] in eq .",
    "( [ segre - classes ] ) , have been presented in the literature  @xcite .",
    "as we have found the segre specializations @xmath15 $ ] and @xmath16 $ ] for phantom fields , we focus our attention here only on the segre class @xmath17 $ ] of eq .",
    "( [ segre - classes ] ) .",
    "the most common energy conditions are @xcite ( see also @xcite for a recent discussion on this topic ) :    * the null energy condition ( nec ) .",
    "nec states that @xmath62 for null vectors @xmath63 which , for segre class @xmath17 $ ] , is equivalent to require that @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) . *",
    "the weak energy condition ( wec ) .",
    "wec states that @xmath66 for timelike vectors @xmath67",
    ". this will also imply , by continuity , the nec .",
    "the wec for segre class @xmath17 $ ] means that @xmath68 .",
    "* the strong energy condition ( sec ) .",
    "sec is the assertion that for any timelike vector @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the trace of @xmath3 .",
    "if @xmath3 belongs to the segre class @xmath17 $ ] then we must have @xmath71 .",
    "* the dominant energy condition ( dec ) .",
    "dec requires that @xmath66 for timelike vectors @xmath67 and the additional requirement that @xmath72 be a non - spacelike vector . by continuity",
    "this will also hold for null vectors @xmath63 . for energy - momentum tensors of segre class @xmath17 $ ]",
    "this requires that @xmath73 , and @xmath74 ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "when imposed on the energy - momentum tensor of the phantom field these energy conditions require : @xmath75 from the above conditions , it should be noticed that although the segre subclass @xmath15 $ ] for the phantom field is consistent with the lorentzian signature of the metric tensor @xmath76 , imposition of nec , as well as dec , generates at least one contradiction in the sense that the timelike character ( @xmath77 ) of the vector @xmath43 is violated . maintaining the lorentzian timelike character of @xmath43 wec can be preserved only for positive potentials since that @xmath78 .",
    "sec , on the other hand , can not be satisfied unless @xmath0 is negative and @xmath79 .",
    "there is however an interval ( @xmath80 ) in the values of potential for which neither sec nor wec are preserved .",
    "figure 1 shows such intervals . in interval i phantom fields",
    "do not violate sec but do violate wec . in region",
    "ii both sec and wec are violate while in region iii phantom fields do not violate wec but do violate sec .",
    "it is worth mentioning that evolving quintessence and phantom fields with linear - negative potentials have been recently proposed and studied in light of recent cosmological observations . as shown in ref . @xcite",
    ", such models provide a good fit for the current supernovae data being , therefore , a potential candidate for dark energy .    at this point",
    ", it is important to observe that in our approach the energy conditions refer to quantities like potentials and/or time derivatives of the fields as well as invariantly defined vectors .",
    "it is also possible to present the same results in terms of pressures and density associated to the phantom field .",
    "as we have noted , the segre subclass @xmath15 $ ] obtained for the phantom field is the same as that for a perfect fluid .",
    "this means that the energy - momentum tensor for an ideal fluid can also be written in the form ( [ phantom - segre ] ) by identifying @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , where @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the pressure and the density of the fluid .",
    "motivated by a number of observational results , the idea of phantom fields as candidate for the dark energy has been largely explored in the current literature . in this paper",
    "we have examined the algebraic classification of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath3 of such fields for generic potential terms .",
    "we have shown that the phantom @xmath3 belongs to segre subclasses @xmath15 $ ] or @xmath16 $ ] .",
    "as is well known , all energy - momentum tensors belonging to these segre subclasses ( e.g. , perfect fluid and @xmath59term type energy - momentum tensors ) couple to friedmann - robertson - walker geometries . we also have found some constraints which are imposed on the values of @xmath0 from the classical energy conditions .",
    "although the sec is being violated right now , according recent observational data regarding the accelerating universe , we see from our analysis that an evolving potential function @xmath0 can , in principle , be constructed such that this condition is not violated in the past ( interval i of fig",
    ". 1 ) , while in that epoch wec must be violated .",
    "although negative potential for phantom fields have already been proposed , the transitions from interval i to interval ii and to iii demand some studies .",
    "our approach makes also clear that imposition of nec , as well as dec , on phantom fields generates a strong contradiction about the timelike character of the vector @xmath43 composing the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "as discussed earlier , the segre classification technique can also be applied to the geometric part of einstein s equations . in this case",
    ", the results could be used to impose the energy conditions directly , via segre classes , on the coefficients of a given metric such as , for example , the frw metric . from such an analysis ,",
    "the production of future singularities in an expanding universe without violating the classical energy conditions could be studied ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this possibility will be explored in a forthcoming communication .",
