    "plasmonic nano - antennas ( na ) have emerged as a powerful tool for sensing and monitoring variations of their local environment such as the binding of molecules at the nano - antenna surface@xcite , hydrogen gas absorption@xcite , chemical reactions @xcite , phase - changing processes@xcite . such sensing properties are due to the frequency shift capability of localized surface plasmon resonances under tiny changes in the effective dielectric constant of the surrounding medium . in all the above - cited examples , nano - antennas have monitored chemical and physical processes in contact to the nano - antennas , by taking advantage of the highly localized plasmon fields that are resonantly generated within of the nanostructures . the sensing ability of nano - antennas to changes happening at a distance from the nanostructures has been hardly discussed .",
    "a hybrid structure combining a plasmonic nano - antenna and a dielectric fabry perot cavity have been demonstrated to remotely sense with nanometer spatial accuracy important film parameters in thin - film nanometrology @xcite but , to our knowledge , no investigation of remote sensing with single plasmonic nano - antennas have been reported so far .",
    "moreover , applications of na - based refractive index sensing are restricted to the extraction of weak nanoscale plasmonic information from a strong background signal .",
    "direct background - free optical detection of plasmonic nanosensors is highly desirable because it would avoid the use of complex detection mechanisms such as absorption / extinction or dark - field scattering spectroscopies @xcite ..",
    "this letter addresses the concept of fiber - integrated bowtie aperture nano - antenna ( bna)@xcite as a metallic nanoresonator for remote sensing applications .",
    "this aperture - type nano - antenna @xcite opened at the end of an opaque metal coated snom fiber tip offers the unique ability of a direct in - fiber and background - free detection of the far - field optical signal emitted by the bna under resonance .",
    "this moveable nano - antenna is demonstrated in the remote ( i.e. , non - contact ) sensing of a silicon surface with direct in - fiber detection , bringing innovative solution to nanopositioning .",
    "given the extremely high sensitivity of bnas to changes of their environment , the tip - to - surface distance can be monitored and controlled over a range at least one order of magnitude larger than that of mechanical force detection devices used in shear - force and atomic force microscopy ( afm ) , with sub - nanometer positionning accuracy and subwavelength lateral sensing area .",
    "in order to produce the bna - on - tip , polymer tips are first grown by photopolymerization at the cleaved end facet of a monomode ( @xmath1 wavelength ) glass fiber @xcite .",
    "next , the probes are metal - coated with @xmath2 thick aluminum layer .",
    "finally , the bna is fabricated at the apex of the tip by fib milling ( dual beam fei helios 600i with a raith elphy multibeam attachment ) .",

    "the first one ( bna1 ) is @xmath4 wide with a square gap about @xmath5 large and @xmath6 flare angles ( see fig.[fig : bna](a ) ) . with this geometry ,",
    "the bna s optical resonance is centered to a wavelength of @xmath7 when it is located at a distance of @xmath8 away from a silicon substrate @xmath9 .",
    "the second one ( bna2 ) has a smaller gap of about @xmath10 and is @xmath11 large so that its resonance is redshifted with respected to the first bna , centered to @xmath12 at @xmath8 far from the si surface .",
    "the design process is performed using three - dimensional finite difference time domain method ( 3d fdtd ) @xcite .",
    "details on the polarization - dependent resonance process of the bna can be found in refs .",
    "we just note that the resonant mode of the bna is strongly bound to its nanometer - scale feed gap which strongly enhances the optical electric field by optical capacitive effect ( see fig . [",

    "is directly projected onto the nano - antenna and the signal collected by the tip ( which is due exclusively to the bna resonance ) is measured at the fiber end as a function of the incident polarization direction .",
    "we see that this diagram shows a two - lobes structure which fits the polarization diagram of an ideal oriented dipole detector described by a cosine function ( blue curve ) .",
    "this proves that the bna can be described optically by an electric dipole moment .",
    "the first bna shows a polarization ratio of about 1:20 .",
    "the polarization ratio of the second bna is measured to a value of 1:8 .",
    "these two nano - antennas are approached to a si surface and studied optically with the experimental set - up shown in fig . [",

    "figure [ fig : scheme ] ( b ) and ( c ) show the optical signal collected by the two bna - on - tips considered in this study , as a function of the spacing ( @xmath16 ) between the nanostructures and the surface . to this end , the tip is set in close proximity of the sample with shear force distance control facility . then , the sample is moved away from the surface by steps of a few nanometers with the piezo stage and at each step the signal is recorded .",

[",
    "fig : scheme](b ) ) , the collected signal increases continuously when the spacing @xmath16 decreases , whereas for the second bna ( fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme](c ) ) , the collected signal is increased for decreasing spacings down to 45 nm and is then strongly decreased for smaller distances .",
    "the origin of this discrepancy is evidenced in the spectral analysis of the two bnas shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectre ] .",
    "figures [ fig : spectre](a ) and ( b ) show the theoretical resonance spectra of the bnas at proximity of a si substrate , for various values of bna - to - surface spacings @xmath16 smaller than @xmath0 . the bnas are excited with a pulsed incoming plane wave in the si substrate at normal incidence .",
    "the spectra are obtained by fourier transforming the electric field recorded during the simulation at a single grid cell , located at the center of the bnas .",
    "they are normalized by the spectra calculated at the same point without the tip to provide information about intensity enhancement .",
    "the experimental wavelength @xmath19=1550 nm is emphasized with dashed lines into the figures .",
    "we see in figs .",
    "[ fig : spectre](a ) and ( b ) that the presence of a silicon surface close to the bnas leads to a dramatic redshift of the nano - antenna resonance that exceeds @xmath20 . for a spacing varying from @xmath0 down to @xmath8 , the resonance wavelength shifts from @xmath21 to @xmath22 with the first bna ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spectre](a ) ) and from @xmath23 to @xmath24 with the second bna ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spectre](b ) )",
    ". therefore , with the first bna , the resonance peak stays centered to wavelengths smaller than @xmath1 over the experimental values of @xmath16 comprised between @xmath0 and @xmath17 .",
    "this results , at a wavelength of @xmath1 , in an intensity enhancement at the bna s gap that continuously increases while the tip approaches the si surface .",

    "[ fig : spectre](c ) which displays the value of the spectra of the two bnas at @xmath25 , for various value of @xmath16",
    ". given the electric dipolar properties of the bna , optical emission into the tip should be continuously increased during the tip approach , which is consistent with fig .",

    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme](b ) show far - field images of the first bna - on - tip used in emission mode , for two tip - to - surface spacings of @xmath17 ( right inset ) and @xmath11 ( left inset ) . to this end",
    ", laser light @xmath26w@xmath27 is injected into the fiber so that the bna is resonantly excited and the magnified far - field images of the bna through the si wafer are realized with a long working distance objective ( @xmath2860 , 0.7 ) coupled to an infrared camera .",
    "we see that the light spot intensity right at the bna is increased close to the surface , which means that the overall bna emission is modified by the sample , not only the bna emission into the tip .",
    "this property avoids changes in the collected signal due to modifications of the dipolar emission pattern of the bna close to a high index dielectric substrate @xcite .",
    "note that this study stays qualitative since ir cameras undergo noticeable non - linearity in their optical response . from fig .",
    "[ fig : spectre](b ) , we see that the resonance peak of the second bna is centered to @xmath25 when it is positioned @xmath29 away from the si surface . as a result ,",
    "the electric field enhanced by the nano - antenna at @xmath25 during tip approach towards the sample surface is maximum at @xmath30 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectre](c ) , which is fully consistent with experimental results given the electric dipole emission properties of the bna .",
    "when the bna is excited off - resonance , by rotating the incident polarization by @xmath14 , the approach curve does not show maximum anymore and the collected signal is 6 times weaker ( see inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme](c ) ) .",
    "the approached curve is described by an exponential like function typical to that near field microscopy .",
    "therefore , variations of the collected signal during tip approach are mainly governed by the resonance redshift of the bna , rather than other optical processes that could be in play such as tip - to - surface interferences . these variations ,",
    "strongly dependent on bna geometry , are thus the signature that the bna is capable of sensing the presence of a flat sample even when it is located at distances from the sample surface well beyond its resonant optical confinement ( @xmath31 field amplitude ) .",
    "nano - positioning techniques used in scanning probe microscopies are generally based on processing low voltage variations that results from the detection of mechanical or optical signals . in our case ,",
    "the detection voltage range has been set to a few volts together with low noise with the synchronous detection scheme ( @xmath32 integration time ) . in that case , the tangential slope of the experimental curves of fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme](b ) is measured to values about @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 at tip - to - sample spacings of @xmath17 , @xmath37 , @xmath2 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "the second experimental curves of fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme](c ) show local tangential slopes about @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 at tip - to - surface spacings of @xmath17 , @xmath43 , @xmath2 and @xmath38 , respectively . since the millivolt range is beyond the noise level of the current highly sensitive optical detection devices , one can expect with bna - on - tips distance control schemes of sub - nanometer accuracy along the longitudinal direction perpendicular to the sample surface .",
    "the on - tip aperture type nature of the bna leads to surface sensing in subwavelength areas , in compact , fiber and plug - and - play optical architectures that require modest power consumption .",
    "surface sensing is usually achieved on the nanometer scale by using mechanical probes aimed at detecting locally surface forces ( shear force and atomic force microscopy ) .",
    "if transverse spatial resolution can be of the order of the angstrom , the spatial sensing depth is limited to a few nanometers . in our case",
    ", one can expect distance regulation over distances at least two orders of magnitude higher and with subwavelength sensing lateral area .",
    "in our paper we have demonstrated the remote sensing capability of using a bna engineered at the end of a snom fiber probe .",
    "the bna has been shown to sense the presence of a si surface up to distance of @xmath0 .",
    "we thus prove that na s have the ability of detecting variation in their large scale environment .",
    "such sensing is due to the high sensitivity of the bna to a small variation in the effective dielectric constant of the medium surrounding it .",
    "in addition , our experimental result have presented a high agreement with the theoretical one , and showed good voltage variation relative to the variation of the distance .",
    "consequently , a single bna engraved at the apex of a snom tip may represent an alternative solution for nano - positioning and distance control instead of nano - mechanical and optical interference - based techniques used nowadays",
