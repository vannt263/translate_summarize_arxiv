    "a _ geometrically finite _ action of a group @xmath8 on a gromov hyperbolic space @xmath9 is one which satisfies the following conditions :    1 .",

    "( typically the list of peripheral subgroups is given by choosing one such stabilizer from each conjugacy class . )    in @xcite and @xcite , group - theoretic analogues of the @xmath4 theorem were proved .",
    "these theorems roughly state that if one begins with a relatively hyperbolic group , and kills off normal subgroups of the peripheral subgroups which contain no `` short '' elements , then the resulting group is also relatively hyperbolic , and `` close '' to the original group in various ways . from this one recovers a weaker group - theoretic version of the @xmath4 theorem , as the fundamental group of a hyperbolic @xmath5manifold is relatively hyperbolic , relative to the cusp groups ; the operation of dehn filling acts on fundamental groups by killing the cyclic subgroups generated by the filling slopes .    in the context of the original @xmath4 theorem , we begin with a group which has such an action on @xmath13 , which is not only @xmath6hyperbolic , but which is actually cat@xmath3 .",

    "these questions form a part of the motivation for this paper ; we answer them positively in some special cases .",
