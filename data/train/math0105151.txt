    "it is well known that the determinant of a skew - symmetric matrix of odd order is zero whereas the determinant of a skew - symmetric matrix of even order is the square of a polynomial in its entries , known as the _ pfaffian_. combinatorially , a pfaffian may be described as the signed weight generating function of a complete graph .",

    "the singular locus of pfaffian rings is known ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) and the arithmetical rank of pfaffian ideals , i.e. , the minimal number of equations needed to define the corresponding variety , is known as well ( cf . @xcite ) .",
    "pfaffian rings arise in invariant theory as the ring of invariants of the symplectic group ( see , for example , ( * ? ? ?",
    "6 ) ) . in this connection",
    ", it is shown in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) that there is a natural partial order on the set of pfaffians of a skew - symmetric matrix and the corresponding polynomial ring is an asl ( algebra with straightening law ) on the poset of pfaffians .",
    "the poset structure suggests the study of more general pfaffian ideals ( namely , those cogenerated by a pfaffian ) , and algebraic properties of the corresponding residue class rings have also been investigated ( cf .",
    "grbner bases for pfaffian rings have been constructed by herzog and trung @xcite , who also derived combinatorial formulae , in terms of the face numbers of an associated simplicial complex , for the hilbert function , and a determinantal formula for the multiplicity .",
    "an explicit expression for the hilbert series of a pfaffian ring has been found by de negri ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  3.5.1 ) , by establishing a link between pfaffian rings and ladder determinantal rings .",
    "the purpose of our article is to record a few facts in this area that have been overlooked previously .",
    "first , we show that one can derive an expression for the hilbert series directly from the above mentioned results of herzog and trung , if we combine them with results from @xcite and @xcite on the enumeration of nonintersecting lattice paths with respect to turns .",
    "the key in the derivation is to express the hilbert series in terms of a generating function for nonintersecting lattice paths , in which the lattice paths are weighted by their number of turns ( see proposition  [ prop1 ] ) .",
    "second , in the process we not only recover de negri s result , but also obtain two alternative expressions ( see theorem  [ mainthm1 ] ) .",
    "third , we show that herzog and trung s determinantal formula for the multiplicity actually simplifies to a nice closed product formula ( see theorem  [ mainthm2 ] ) , thus answering a question raised in @xcite .",
    "this gives , for example , a formula for the multiplicity of a generic gorenstein ideal of codimension @xmath0 as a trivial consequence .    towards the completion of this work",
    ", we learned that formulae for the multiplicity of pfaffian rings can also be obtained by geometric methods as a special case of the formulae for the fundamental classes of degeneracy loci of certain maps of vector bundles .",

    ". moreover , the resulting formulae are also somewhat distinct .",
    "nevertheless , it seems worthwhile to know the various formulae and the methods used to obtain them .",
    "accordingly , for the convenience of the reader , we have included a fairly self - contained appendix at the end of this paper in which the basic ideas related to degeneracy loci and the resulting multiplicity formulae are described .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section we review the definition of a pfaffian ring , and we introduce the lattice path notation that we are going to use throughout the paper . the central part of the paper is section  [ sec : hilbseries ] , in which we establish the connection between the hilbert series of a pfaffian ring and the enumeration of nonintersecting lattice paths with a given number of turns .",
