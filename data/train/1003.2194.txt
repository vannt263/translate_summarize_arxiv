    "in most superconductors , the cooper pairing is suppressed by the coupling of the orbital motion of electrons with a magnetic field.@xcite in some cases , however , the orbital suppression is ineffective and the dominant mechanism of the magnetic pair breaking is spin - related , caused by either the zeeman coupling with the external field , or the exchange interaction with the localized spins in a magnetic crystal .",
    "the superconductivity is then said to be paramagnetically limited .",
    "it was shown by larkin and ovchinnikov@xcite ( lo ) and fulde and ferrell@xcite ( ff ) that the competition between the paramagnetic pair breaking and the condensation energy results in the formation of a peculiar nonuniform superconducting state  the loff state  in which the cooper pairs have nonzero center - of - mass momenta . in the simplest cases ,",

    "the experimental detection of the loff state requires both the orbital effects and disorder to be sufficiently weak .",
    "this can be achieved in the superconductors with a short coherence length and heavy effective mass of quasiparticles , which increases the orbital upper critical field @xmath2 , and can be particularly favored in the systems with low - dimensional geometry , either in real space ( superconductivity in films or at interfaces , in a parallel field ) or in momentum space ( quasi - one - dimensional and quasi - two - dimensional band structures ) . for a review of the loff state in superconductors ,",
    "see ref . . a different route to the experimental realization of the loff state is offered by cold atomic fermi gases . in these systems",
    "the role of the zeeman field is played by the mismatch between the fermi surfaces , which is controlled by the difference between the numbers of atoms in two different hyperfine states , see ref . for a review .",
    "further afield , states similar to the loff state have been discussed recently in high - energy physics , in the context of `` color superconducting '' quark matter.@xcite while most theoretical studies have focused on the equilibrium properties of the loff systems , in particular , the phase diagram and the most stable order parameter , a number of recent works have looked at deviations from a perfectly periodic order , including thermal and quantum fluctuations@xcite and topological defects , such as vortices and dislocations.@xcite    in addition to the @xmath3 phase rotation symmetry , the loff state can break the continuous translational symmetry , which leads to a richer spectrum of low - energy bosonic excitations , or goldstone modes . since neither global phase rotations nor uniform translations of the order parameter cost any energy , the goldstone modes in the loff state",
    "are associated with slow gradients of the order parameter phase , as well as with weakly nonuniform displacements of the order parameter amplitude modulation . in the lowest order ,",
