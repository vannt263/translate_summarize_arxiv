    "turbulent flows are complex and multiscale and are characterized by eddy motions of different spatial sizes with different time scales @xcite .",
    "this has been described by kolmogorovs scaling theory of turbulence in 1941 .",
    "the scaling behavior of the eulerian velocity field has been studied in details to quantify the intermittent nature of turbulence for large reynolds numbers and homogeneous turbulence @xcite .",
    "here we consider the lagrangian frame , in which the fluid particle is tracked experimentally or numerically @xcite .",
    "fluid particles are fluctuating over different time scales with a power - law behavior in the inertial range , e.g. , @xmath14 , in which @xmath15 is the kolmogorov time scale , and @xmath16 is the lagrangian integral time scale .",
    "conventionally , multiscale statistics are characterized by using the lagrangian structure - functions ( lsfs ) , i.e. , @xmath17 in which @xmath18 is the lagrangian velocity increment , and @xmath19 is the separation time scale and is lying in the inertial range .",
    "recently , @xcite showed a clear lagrangian inertial range on the frequency range @xmath20 ( resp .",
    "@xmath10 ) and retrieved the scaling exponent @xmath21 by using a hilbert - based methodology .",
    "the measured scaling exponents @xmath22 are nonlinear and concave , showing that intermittency corrections are indeed relevant for lagrangian turbulence @xcite . using a high - resolution lagrangian turbulence database",
    ", we can now verify the scaling relations associated with the kolmogorov refined similarity hypothesis ( rsh ) .",
    "let us recall some main ingredients of the lagrangian version of the kolmogorovs refined similarity hypothesis ( lrsh ) , in which the energy dissipation rate @xmath23 is involved . here",
    "@xmath24 is the velocity strain rate tensor along a lagrangian trajectory . a local time averaged of the energy dissipation rate along a lagrangian trajectory",
    "is defined as , i.e. , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the logarithm of the dissipation .",
    "kolmogorovs rsh ( 1962 ) has been written in the eulerian frame .",
    "the lagrangian analogy assumes that , in the inertial range , the variance of @xmath26 has a logarithmic decrease , i.e. , @xmath27 in which @xmath28 stands for the variance of @xmath29 , @xmath30 is a universal constant and @xmath31 might depend on the flow @xcite . a @xmath9th - order moment of @xmath2",
    "is expected to have a power - law behavior in the inertial range , i.e. , @xmath32 this relation can be completed by a logarithmic decrease of the autocorrelation function of @xmath33 associated to multifractal cascades @xcite , i.e. , @xmath34 in which @xmath35 . for a lognormal cascade ,",
    "we expect @xmath36 , in which @xmath37 is the intermittency parameter @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "one expects also a power - law behavior for the @xmath9th - order lsf , @xmath38 .",
    "the lrsh assumes a relationship between these two quantities , i.e. , @xmath39 leading to a relation between scaling exponents , i.e. , @xmath40 let us note that this scaling relation ( eq .",
    "[ eq : lk62 ] ) can be found for non - lognormal cascades so that the original kolmogorov assumption of lognormality is not included in the rsh .",
    "the original rsh in the eulerian frame has been very well verified @xcite .",
    "however , only few works have tested the rsh in lagrangian frame @xcite .",
    "for example , @xcite proposed a multifractal formula to describe the lagrangian velocity increments .",
    "it is found that the left part of the measured singularity spectrum @xmath41 agrees well with both the lognormal model and the log - poisson model .",
    "@xcite investigated the lagrangian time correlation function @xmath3 for both lagrangian strain- and rotation - rate tensors .",
    "they found that the correlation function @xmath3 depends on the spatial location of particles released .",
    "@xcite tested the lrsh along lagrangian trajectories .",
    "they showed that the lrsh is well verified by making extended self - similarity plots .",
    "@xcite studied a conditional lagrangian increment statistics .",
    "they found that the intermittency is significantly reduced when the lsf is conditioned on the energy dissipation rate or similar quantities ( e.g. , square of vorticity ) .",
    "a similar result has been shown for the eulerian velocity structure - function : it is found that if one removes strong dissipation events , the corresponding scaling exponent is then approaching the kolmogorovs 1941 ones without intermittent correction @xcite . note that in all these studies , the relation [ eq : lk62 ] was not directly tested .",
    "we would like to provide a comment on the lsf .",
    "it has been shown that due to the influence of large scale motions , known as infrared effect , and to the contamination of small scales , known as ultraviolet effect , the classical lsf mixes the large and small scales information @xcite .",
    "therefore , without the help of ess , the lsf can not identify the correct scaling behavior of the lagrangian velocity @xcite . with the help of a fully adaptive method , namely hilbert - huang transform ,",
    "a clear inertial range can be found @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "the lrsh is verified by considering eqs.[eq : sigma ] , [ eq : moments ] , [ eq : covariance ] and [ eq : lk62 ] , where the scaling exponents for the lagrangian velocity are extracted by using a hilbert - based method .",
