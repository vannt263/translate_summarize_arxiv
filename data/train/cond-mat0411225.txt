    "the real- or imaginary - time dynamics of systems described by a finite hamiltonian matrix , representing bosonic or fermionic degrees of freedom , admits an exact probabilistic representation in terms of a proper collection of independent poisson processes @xcite . for a lattice system",
    ", the poisson processes are associated to the links of the lattice and the probabilistic representation leads to an optimal algorithm @xcite which coincides with the green function quantum monte carlo method in the limit when the latter becomes exact @xcite .    in the recent ref .",
    "we have exploited the above probabilistic representation to derive analytical expressions for the matrix elements of the evolution operator in the long time limit . in this way ,",
    "the ground - state energy as well as the expectation of a generic operator in the ground state of a lattice system without sign problem are obtained as the solution of a simple scalar equation .",
    "the result is based on the application of a central limit theorem to the rescaled multiplicities of the values assumed by the potential and hopping energies in the configurations dynamically visited by the system . as a consequence",
    ", the probabilistic expectations can be calculated by using a gaussian - like probability density . in this paper",
    ", we briefly review the approach developed in ref .   and discuss in detail the choice of the asymptotic probability density used in the calculation .",
    "we illustrate our approach in the case of imaginary - time dynamics for a system of hard - core bosons described by the hamiltonian @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a finite @xmath2-dimensional lattice with @xmath3 sites and @xmath4 the commuting destruction operators at site @xmath5 and spin index @xmath6 with the property @xmath7 .",
    "the potential operator @xmath8 is arbitrary , _",
    "e.g. _ for the hubbard model @xmath9 . for simplicity , we assume @xmath10 if @xmath5 and @xmath11 are first neighbors and @xmath12 otherwise .    in order to study the ground - state properties of the hamiltonian @xmath13 it is sufficient to evaluate the long time behavior of @xmath14 , where @xmath15 are the lattice occupation numbers taking the values 0 or 1 . in fact , the ground - state energy is given by @xmath16 while the quantum expectation of a generic operator @xmath17 in the ground state of @xmath13 can be obtained via the hellman - feynman theorem @xcite by evaluating the ground - state energy @xmath18 of the modified hamiltonian @xmath19 .    at any finite time @xmath20 ,",
    "the matrix elements of the evolution operator considered above admit the exact probabilistic representation @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a stochastic functional defined in terms of independent poisson processes associated to the links of the lattice , see ref .   for a detailed description .",
    "at each jump of a poisson process relating sites @xmath5 and @xmath11 with spin @xmath6 and taking place at a given configuration @xmath23 , a particle of spin @xmath6 moves from site @xmath5 to site @xmath11 or vice versa if the mod 2 sum of the occupations of these two sites is @xmath24 , while the lattice configuration @xmath23 remains unchanged if @xmath25 .",
    "hereafter , links with @xmath26 will be called active . by ordering the jumps according to the times @xmath27 , @xmath28 , at which they take place in the interval @xmath29",
    ", we define a trajectory as the markov chain @xmath30 generated from the initial configuration @xmath31 .",
    "the number of jumps @xmath32 is , of course , a random integer associated to each trajectory .",

    "( [ eq1 ] ) actually depends on the jump times @xmath41 and on the corresponding sequences @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "evaluating the expectation @xmath42 over the detailed sequences above specified can be done numerically by a monte carlo method @xcite . in ref .   we have demonstrated that an analytical expression of @xmath42 can be obtained in the limit of long times . this result",
    "is reached in four steps described in the next subsections .",
    "the crucial point is that , if one integrates over all the possible jumps times , what matter are not the detailed sequences @xmath33 and @xmath43 but the multiplicities @xmath44 and @xmath45 of the possibles values which the variables @xmath46 and @xmath47 may assume .",
    "we call @xmath48 and @xmath49 the sets of these values and @xmath50 and @xmath51 their cardinalities .",
    "it is clear that the nature of these sets depends only on the structure of the system hamiltonian , not on the values of the hamiltonian parameters .",
    "the expectation @xmath42 is reduced to an average over @xmath44 and @xmath45 . for @xmath52",
    ", this average can be evaluated analytically by using saddle - point techniques and a central limit theorem .      referring to ref .   for the details ,",
    "we decompose the expectation as a series of conditional expectations with a fixed number of jumps ( canonical averages ) @xmath53 integrating over the @xmath54 jumps times , each term of the series ( [ expansion ] ) can be written as @xmath55 where @xmath56 means average over the trajectories with @xmath54 jumps generated by extracting with uniform probability one of the active links available at the configurations @xmath57 , and @xmath58 , named weight , is defined as @xmath59      according to their definition , the weights satisfy a recursive differential equation which is easily solved in terms of the laplace transform @xmath60 @xcite , _ i.e. _ @xmath61 while this expression shows that @xmath58 depends on the multiplicities @xmath45 for any value of @xmath54 , the explicit inversion of the laplace transform can be done analytically only for @xmath54 large .",

    "we rewrite the multiplicities as @xmath88 and @xmath89 , where @xmath90 if @xmath91 and @xmath92 otherwise , and similarly for @xmath93 .",
    "since the configurations @xmath94 form a markov chain with finite state space , a central limit theorem applies to each rescaled sum @xmath95 or @xmath96 @xcite .",
    "therefore , these rescaled variables are completely described in terms of the mean values @xmath97 and of the covariance matrix @xmath98 , which are easily measured by sampling over trajectories with a large number of jumps .",
    "due to the constraints ( [ constraints ] ) , it is easy to see that @xmath99 @xmath100    in the next two subsections we will describe two different choices for the density @xmath85 .",
