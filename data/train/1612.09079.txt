    "in recent years , the study of integrable systems out of equilibrium has become one of the main focuses of theoretical and mathematical physics @xcite . in particular , understanding the local and also quasilocal conservation laws and their impact on the nonequilibrium dynamics of integrable systems has become an important problem of quantum statistical physics ( see e.g. recent review @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "apart from the problem of local equilibration of isolated systems towards the generalized gibbs ensemble , linear response transport also proves to be an important polygon for implementation of integrals of motion .",
    "notably , conservation laws varying linearly in system size , as measured by the hilbert - schmidt norm , can be used in the mazur - suzuki bound to rigorously establish the ballistic transport at high temperatures @xcite .",
    "these ideas have so far been implemented mainly on the paradigmatic example of integrable systems , the spin @xmath2 @xmath3 model .",
    "the notion of quasilocal conservation laws has so far only been studied in the lattice models with finite dimensional local hilbert spaces , such as spin chains .",
    "there has been an alternative proposal of quasilocal charges in continuous field theories @xcite , but it seems this approach can only be worked out explicitly for free theories .    our proposition here is to study quasilocality in integrable lattice regularization of an interacting field theory in @xmath0 dimensions , namely the quantum sine - gordon ( sg ) model .",
    "we shall consider in particular the so - called quantum hirota model , put forward by faddeev and volkov @xcite ( see also @xcite ) which is in our opinion the most elegant and clean lattice regularization of the sg model .",
    "in contrast to fermionic light - cone lattice approach of destri and de vega @xcite , the hirota model uses ( multiplicative ) bosonic variables . if one interprets the two - dimensional ( 2d ) lattice of discretized spectral and spin parameters as a space - time lattice , then quantum hirota model becomes equivalent to the t - system describing a fusion hierarchy of transfer matrices ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .    in this paper",
    "the quasilocal conservation laws of the quantum hirota model are identified for generic root - of - unity deformation parameter @xmath1 where the local hilbert space is finite dimensional .",
    "we build on the seminal results of faddeev and volkov @xcite , where integrability of this lattice model has been established and the transfer matrix has been constructed . the quantum hirota model , a version of which is also known under the name quantum volterra model @xcite can be interpreted in multiple ways . as already discussed , one can think of it as of a light - like lattice regularization of the sg quantum field theory @xcite , describing for example the low energy physics of the anisotropic heisenberg model , or as a quantized volterra model , the classical counterpart of which is used in the study of population dynamics @xcite .",
    "it is also closely related to the chiral potts model @xcite , i.e. a classical statistical model with discrete cyclic @xmath4 variables on a 2d lattice .",
    "however , our favorite interpretation of this model is in terms of a floquet ( periodically ) driven system with discrete cyclic ( weyl ) variables  a quantum protocol interchangeably propagating dynamical variables at even and odd lattice sites which is completely determined by a local recursive dynamical rule  la quantum cellular automaton .    for lattice systems it is convenient to speak of linear extensivity in a sense of the hilbert - schmidt ( hs ) inner product .",
    "let @xmath5 and @xmath6 be two operators on the hilbert space considered and @xmath7 the identity on the same space . then one defines the hs product and the corresponding norm ( also , up to normalization , equivalent to frobenius norm ) as @xmath8 linear extensivity of an observable @xmath9 is just @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the number of lattice sites , i.e. a system size .",
    "the most commonly known linearly extensive operators are local operators , that is translational sums @xmath12}$ ] of local operator valued densities @xmath13}$ ] acting on clusters of @xmath14 lattice sites , starting at site @xmath15 . here",
    "@xmath14 is fixed while the sum goes over all the lattice sites @xmath15 .",
    "for an example we can take the heisenberg hamiltonian , where @xmath16 . a non - local operator can still be linearly extensive if it satisfies the condition of quasilocality , that is , if it is a double sum of local densities @xmath17}$ ] , where also @xmath14 is allowed to change , and these densities obey @xmath18}\\|^2_{\\rm hs } \\le c e^{-\\gamma r},\\ ] ] for some @xmath19 .",
    "our aim is to construct linearly extensive conservation laws for the hirota model , starting from the integrals of motion constructed by faddeev and volkov @xcite , using the procedure developped in ref .",
    "we should stress that conserved quantities of faddeev and volkov , by themselves , are not linearly extensive in the sense of the hs norm .",
    "our conservation laws can be interpreted as traceless parts ( in the following denoted by @xmath20 ) of logarithmic derivatives of faddeev - volkov integrals of motion .",
    "for the analogous construction in the isotropic heisenberg model , see ref .",
    "@xcite .    the main result presented in sections [ ql ] and [ kernel ] of this paper can be summarized as follows .",
    "let @xmath21 , @xmath22 odd ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 even ) and let @xmath25 be the commuting transfer matrix of the hirota model as proposed by faddeev and volkov in @xcite .",
    "the traceless part of the conserved charge @xmath26 where @xmath27 obeys @xmath28 is a quasilocal operator for @xmath29 with @xmath30 with @xmath31 .",
    "moreover linear extensivity holds for this conservation law in the thermodynamic limit , since @xmath32 where the hilbert - schmidt kernel @xmath33 is explicitly computed .",
    "the statement is proven analytically for general @xmath22 , except for the precise conditions on the domain of the spectral parameter @xmath34 .",
    "the latter is deduced from the results of exact numerical diagonalization .    in section [ dynamics ] the definition of the hirota model",
    "will be revisited along with its dynamics .",
    "section [ integrals ] will describe faddeev - volkov @xcite conservation laws , constructed with algebraic bethe ansatz , while in section [ floq ] we will discuss a floquet interpretation of the model on a simple example .",
    "the last two sections , [ ql ] and [ kernel ] , constitute the explanation of the results  in section [ ql ] linear extensivity of logarithmic derivatives is established , following the procedure proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , while in section [ kernel ] the hilbert - schmidt kernel is explicitly computed and explicit matrix product form of the conserved charges is written out .",
    "consider a periodic chain of @xmath35 sites , where each site is characterized by a pair of weyl variables @xmath36 , satisfying the @xmath1-deformed canonical commutation relation , @xmath37 with @xmath1 being the root of unity , @xmath38 , and @xmath22 assumed to be _",

    "non - neighbouring variables @xmath52 commute , since they have no physical operators in common .",
    "note , in particular , that odd - numbered and even - numbered variables commute among themselves , respectively .",
    "suppose time propagation can be factorized as @xmath53 @xmath14 being some analytic function of the dynamical variable @xmath54 and the square of the _ scaling _",
    "parameter @xmath55 .",
    "we have denoted our time slice by @xmath56 .",
    "a time interval is discretized , one time step being equal to @xmath57 ( by definition ) .",
    "let us propagate @xmath58 according to @xmath59 , which amounts to @xmath60   w_{2n}(t)\\,\\left[r(\\kappa^2,q^2w_{2n-1}(t))^{-1}r(\\kappa^2,w_{2n-1}(t))\\right].\\ ] ] propagation for odd dynamical variables is a bit different since the even placed variables are already time shifted .",
    "it corresponds to @xmath61   w_{2n+1}(t)\\,\\left[r(\\kappa^2,q^2w_{2n}(t+1))^{-1}r(\\kappa^2,w_{2n}(t+1))\\right].\\ ] ] schematically , local propagation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : propagation ] .     and then using them to kick the odd degrees of freedom for the same time step with @xmath62 . since we are propagating the dynamical variables @xmath52 and not the physical ones @xmath63 , we either need an additional @xmath35 constraints , to reconstruct the information stored in @xmath64 physical variables , or need to restrict the physics to be discussed to observables that are formed solely from dynamical variables .",
    "empty circles represent variables propagated for the full time step . to reconstruct empty red circles ( physical variables ) ,",
    "additional constraints are needed ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we thus consider the quantum protocol which transforms blue ( green ) filled circles into blue ( green ) empty circles , while using physical variables ( red circles ) only as a convenient static operator basis . ]    if we demand that the function @xmath14 solves @xmath65 we can rewrite the dynamical map as & w_2n(t+1)=f(qw_2n+1(t))w_2n(t)f(q w_2n-1(t))^-1 , + & w_2n+1(t+1)=f(qw_2n+2(t+1))w_2n+1(t)f(q w_2n(t+1))^-1 , which in certain continuous limit defines the dynamics of the sine - gordon model @xcite .",
    "there @xmath55 plays the role of a scaling parameter related to the mass .",
    "note that for complete physical description one needs a set of additional @xmath35 constraints , to recover @xmath64 physical variables from @xmath35 dynamical ones at later times @xcite .",
    "instead of dealing with additional constraints , we can restrict ourselves to operators that can be written solely as sums of products of the dynamical variables .",
    "in other words , we have explicit dynamics of variables @xmath52 , but not the dynamics of @xmath66 and @xmath67 which can be determined only after we additionally specify the set of constraints . for us",
    "the latter ( namely @xmath63 ) only constitute a convenient time independent operator basis .",
    "as was shown by faddeev and volkov @xcite , the hirota model described above is integrable .",
    "let us restrict ourselves to odd roots of unity , that is @xmath38 , @xmath22 odd .",
    "the solution of eqs .",
    "r_-matrix , defined as @xmath68 the term with index @xmath69 should be thought of as an identity operator acting on a tensor square of a physical space .",
    "it can easily be checked , that @xmath70 is proportional to an identity if @xmath71 , hence the time propagation can , in this case , be made unitary .",
    "the time propagation , in case of periodic boundary conditions allows for two trivial conserved charges , namely @xcite @xmath72 at this point we are obliged to mention that in order to reproduce true periodicity of the lattice , we need to restrict ourselves to the subspace , on which these two charges act as identities @xcite . we will not go into further subtleties of this issue .",
    "instead , let us review the algebraic bethe ansatz construction of nontrivial conserved charges .",

    "( see e.g. refs .",

    "denotes the partial trace with respect to the auxiliary space .",
    "] moreover , using trigonometric @xmath80-matrix of the @xmath3 model , one can show commutativity of these conserved charges , @xmath81=0 $ ] .",
    "it can easily be proven , that these conserved charges , as well as their derivatives are either trivial or highly nonlocal and in particular are not linearly extensive in the system size in the sense of hilbert - schmidt norm . using the tools which will be described in section [ ql ] one can compute the auxiliary transfer matrix ( atm ) of faddeev s charges to see , for even @xmath82 @xmath83_{\\lambda=0 } \\right\\|^2_{\\rm hs } \\sim n^n.\\ ] ] more precisely , the dependence on @xmath11 is polynomial with terms up to the order of the derivative of the transfer operator .",
    "charges which are odd derivatives are all zero .",
    "moreover we have @xmath84",
    "since the propagator consists of two factorized parts and the factors of each part commute among themselves , because they depend either on only odd - numbered or only even - numbered physical variables , we can define two effective hamiltonians in the following way : & u_even=(-i h_even ) , h_even = i_n=1^n r(^2,w_2n ) , + & u_odd=(-i h_odd ) , h_odd = i_n=1^n r(^2,w_2n-1 ) , so that the whole time - propagation is generated by a periodic time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath85 , defined as @xmath86 , @xmath87 . if @xmath55 is real we can normalize @xmath14-matrices to become unitary .",
    "then the effective hamiltonians get an additive complex constant and become hermitian . without going into the details let us , just to make an example , construct these hamiltonians explicitly for the case @xmath88 .",
    "the @xmath14-matrix takes simple form @xmath89 and the local hamiltonian density can be expanded into logarithmic series . since @xmath90 the following holds for the powers of @xmath91 : w^n = a(n)+b(n ) w , where @xmath92 and @xmath93 satisfy recursive relations of the form a(n+1)=2b(n ) , + b(n+1)=a(n)+b(n ) , with the initial conditions @xmath94 .",
    "these relations can be solved to get the final result @xmath95\\one\\otimes\\one+\\frac{1}{3}\\log\\big[\\frac{1 + 2\\alpha(\\kappa^2)}{1-\\alpha(\\kappa^2)}\\big](w+w^{-1}),\\ ] ] which can be checked to hold for any real parameter @xmath55 . with this illustrative example",
    "we conclude the floquet interpretation of the time propagation .",
    "quasilocal integrals of motion will be constructed as logarithmic derivatives of faddeev s conservation laws , according to the procedure described in ref .",
