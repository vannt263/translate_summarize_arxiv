    "according to the currently accepted formulation , the energy flux density of radiation is @xmath0 the energy flux density of radiation at time @xmath1 and at any position @xmath2 on a sphere , eq .",
    "( [ eqs ] ) , is due to the radiation emanating by an accelerated charge at an earlier time @xmath3 and at the center of the sphere . the velocity @xmath4 and the acceleration @xmath5 of the charge in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eqs ] ) are defined at the retarded time @xmath3 .",
    "the energy radiated into a solid angle @xmath6 in the direction @xmath7 , and then measured at the position @xmath8 and the time @xmath1 is @xmath9 , for an infinitesimal time interval @xmath10 .",
    "hence , @xmath11 is the energy per unit area per unit time measured at the position @xmath2 on the sphere .",
    "consequently , the radiated power passing through the surface of a surrounding sphere per unit solid angle @xmath6 in the direction @xmath7 is @xmath12 eq .  ( [ eqjak3 ] ) is the angular distribution of radiated power per unit solid angle , as measured by observers on a surrounding sphere @xcite .",
    "in contrast , according to the new formulation , the energy flux density of radiation is @xmath13 thus , the angular distribution of radiated power per unit solid angle , relative to the position of the charge at the retarded time @xmath3 , is @xmath14 by integrating eq .",
    "( [ huangeqjak3 ] ) over a surrounding sphere , the total radiated power crossing any surrounding sphere is @xmath15 the total radiated power of radiation crossing any surrounding sphere is equal to the total power emitted by the charge at the retarded time @xmath16 , the so - called linard s result , @xmath17 as it should be to fulfill the principle of conservation of energy . yet , according to the currently accepted formulation , by integrating eq .",
    "( [ eqjak3 ] ) over a surrounding sphere , the total power of radiation crossing any surrounding sphere is not equal to the linard s result @xcite .",
    "the currently accepted formulation violates the principle of conservation of energy .",
    "in the comment , singal first claimed that our reasoning above is fallacious , because we equate the evaluated result of the total radiated power of radiation crossing a sphere to the total power emitted by the charge .",
    "then , he presented a resolution to the problem . referring to fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , at time @xmath1 the radiation in the region enclosed by spheres @xmath18 and @xmath19 is due to the radiation emitted by the charge during the time interval from @xmath20 to @xmath21 .",
    "the radiation region is not spherically symmetric around @xmath22 , since the charge moves a distance @xmath23 from @xmath22 to @xmath24 .",
    "thus , the radiation emitted by the charge during the time interval @xmath21 does not cross the sphere @xmath19 at all points in the time interval @xmath21 , rather it takes @xmath25 .    therefore , from eq .",
    "( [ eqjak3 ] ) , the total energy of radiation @xmath26 enclosed by spheres @xmath18 and @xmath19 is evaluated as @xmath27 the total energy of radiation @xmath26 is due to the total energy emitted by the charge during the time interval @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath28 is equal to the total power emitted by the charge at the retarded time @xmath16 , that is , @xmath29 therefore , the currently accepted formulation does not violate the principle of conservation of energy . in that case , the new formulation violates the principle of conservation of energy .",
    "yet , it should be noted that @xmath30 is not the total radiated power crossing the sphere @xmath19 at time @xmath1 . according to singal s reasoning , what is the total radiated power crossing the sphere @xmath19 ?",
    "in our reasoning @xcite , we do not derive the linard s result , and not equate the evaluated result of the total radiated power crossing a sphere to the linard s result .",
    "instead , we compare the evaluated result with the linard s result to see which formulation satisfies the principle of conservation of energy .",
    "it turns out that currently accepted formulation , instead of the new formulation , violates the principle of conservation of energy .",
    "there are problems in the currently accepted formulation .",
    "since the charge is accelerated , it does not move uniformly during the time interval @xmath21 .",
    "thus , the angular distribution of radiated power in the time interval is not exactly in accordance with eq .",
    "( [ eqjak3 ] ) as evaluated at merely one retarded time @xmath16 , because the time - retarded positions and velocities @xmath4 of the charge change during the time interval .",
    "the total power emitted by the charge as evaluated in accordance with singal s reasoning should be only approximately valid , as noticed by panofsky and jackson @xcite . therefore , it is very unlikely that the _ exact _ linard s result is obtained simply by an approximation approach , unless eq .",
    "( [ eqjak3 ] ) is only approximately correct .",
    "according to singal , the factor @xmath31 in the time interval @xmath32 is interpreted as just a matter of simple geometry . yet",
    "this interpretation negates the existent interpretations : a lorentz transformation of time between the charge s frame and the observer s frame @xcite , or something similar to the doppler effect @xcite .",
    "which interpretation is correct ?",
    "foremost , singal does not resolve the problem that the currently accepted formulation violates the principle of conservation of energy .",
    "the total radiated power crossing a surrounding sphere at time @xmath1 is not equal to @xmath30 .",
    "suppose that one wants to evaluate the total radiated _ power _",
    "@xmath33 crossing a sphere .",
    "one first measures the total radiated _ energy _ @xmath34 crossing the sphere in a time interval @xmath35 .",
    "then , the total radiated power crossing the sphere is given as @xmath36 .",
    "it should be emphasized that the time interval @xmath37 must be the same , as the measurement of the total radiated energy is carried out _ at all points _ on the sphere .",
    "however , according to singal s reasoning , the measurement of the total radiated energy @xmath38 crossing the sphere @xmath19 is carried out with different time intervals @xmath32 at different points on the sphere .",
    "@xmath39 is meaningless , and @xmath40 is not the total radiated power crossing the sphere . if singal thinks that the total radiated power crossing a surrounding sphere is @xmath30 , and it is equal to the total power emitted by the charge at the retarded time , then he might make a mistake in the meaning of the total radiated power crossing a sphere .",
    "hence , the problem that the currently accepted formulation violates the principle of conservation of energy remains unsolved .",
    "another issue in the comment is `` while deriving expressions for the electric and magnetic fields , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , huang and lu @xcite in their eqs .",
    "( 20)-(25 ) simply replaced @xmath43 with @xmath44 which is not correct as these two quantities are actually related by @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the doppler factor [ 3 ] .",
    "thus their transformed electric and magnetic fields are wrong . ''",
    "the newly derived expressions for the electromagnetic fields become the currently accepted expressions , if @xmath47 , instead of @xmath48 , is employed in the transformation of electric and magnetic fields between inertial frames .",
    "first , that the new formulation , rather than the currently accepted formulation , fulfills the principle of conservation of energy reinforces the validity of the replacement @xmath49 in the transformation .",
    "furthermore , maxwell s equations of electrodynamics are shown form - invariant via a novel perspective on relativistic transformation  transformation of physical quantities , instead of space - time coordinates @xcite .",
    "an extra transformation of spacial coordinate such as @xmath47 is not necessary in the transformation of electric and magnetic fields to render maxwell s equations form - invariant among inertial frames .    according to singal , the expression @xmath47 is considered as due to the doppler effect .",
    "yet , the doppler effect is the transformation of physical quantities of waves such as frequency @xmath50 and wave vector @xmath51 relative to inertial frames , instead of space - time coordinates @xmath52 .",
    "the expression @xmath47 has nothing to do with the doppler effect , since it involves spatial coordinates only , without frequency and wave vector of waves . a systematic method to derive the doppler effect , without involving transformation of space - time coordinates , was presented in the literature @xcite .",
    "even more , in a certain case an anomaly  the problem of negative frequency of waves , was found by applying the invariance of the phase of waves which is equivalent to relativistic transformation of both physical quantities @xmath53 and space - time coordinates @xmath52 simultaneously @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the invariance of the phase of waves is invalid .",
    "therefore , the doppler effect should be related to the transformation of physical quantities @xmath53 of waves only . in singal s interpretation ,",
    "the factor @xmath31 in @xmath32 is a matter of simple geometry , whereas the factor @xmath54 in @xmath47 is due to the doppler effect .",
    "the two interpretations seem incompatible .",
    "ambiguities on the meaning of @xmath25 and @xmath47 still exist in the currently accepted formulation of electromagnetic radiation of an accelerated charge . owing to a misunderstanding in the meaning of",
    "the total radiated power crossing a sphere , the serious problem that currently accepted formulation violates the principle of conservation of energy remains unsolved .",
    "such controversies as paradoxes in special relativity are hardly resolved just by theoretical reasoning . in order to convincingly determine the validity of the currently accepted formulation , an experimental test on the angular distribution of radiated power was proposed @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , it is necessary to clarify which the angular distribution of radiated power is : eq .",
