    "there are now well - established correlations between the mass of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) and properties of their host galaxies , such as bulge luminosity , mass , light concentration , and velocity dispersion @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the physical mechanism driving growth of the smbh also plays a key role in forming the bulge ( for spiral galaxies ) or galaxy ( for ellipticals ) .",
    "analytical estimates @xcite , as well as numerical simulations @xcite with simple prescriptions for smbh accretion have demonstrated the plausibility of this inference by matching the expected slopes of these correlations .",
    "regardless of the detailed feedback prescription , these models predict that smbhs grow until reaching some critical mass , where the energy and/or momentum released by feedback expels material from the nucleus . as such",
    ", they robustly predict that the `` true '' correlation should be between smbh mass and a quantity such as the binding energy or potential well depth of material in the bulge .",
    "@xcite show that the observed correlations with different variables , and importantly their scatter and systematic deviations from the relations , can be understood as the projections of a single fundamental dependence .",
    "this relation is approximated closely by a multi - variable correlation , a black hole fundamental plane ( bhfp ) .",
    "@xcite confirmed this in a sample of ellipticals and spiral bulges using dynamical models of bulge potentials , and @xcite did so with simple proxies such as @xmath2 .",
    "additional correlations have been found between smbh mass and dark matter halo mass , as well as the number @xmath1  of globular clusters ( gc ) in the host galaxy @xcite . in particular , ( * ? ? ? * hereafter bt10 ) argued that @xmath1  is a better predictor of @xmath0  than the velocity dispersion @xmath3 , citing a smaller intrinsic scatter and a residual correlation between @xmath1  and @xmath0  in elliptical galaxies even after accounting for the median @xmath4 correlation , suggesting a fundamental link between the accretion of gas by the smbh and the formation of a galaxy s globular cluster system .",
    "* hereafter hh10 ) extended the sample by making reasonable estimates of @xmath1  from the literature in galaxies with @xmath0  measurements .    in this letter , we illustrate that the above link can be understood as a consequence of the bhfp relation combined with a residual correlation between @xmath1  and the bulge s stellar mass @xmath5 at fixed @xmath3 . rather than suggesting a single `` best '' correlation between @xmath0  and a single galaxy parameter",
    ", the bhfp implies that the best predictor of smbh mass is some combination thereof .",
    "for example , @xmath0  has a positive correlation with the bulge s stellar mass even at fixed @xmath3 .",
    "although the number of globular clusters in a particular galaxy , like @xmath0 , is a complex function of the galaxy s formation history , there exists a similar positive residual correlation between @xmath1  and @xmath5 , so that the resulting @xmath1@xmath0  residuals ( fixing @xmath3 ) will be positively correlated .",
    "in  [ s : data ] we describe a sample of 32 elliptical galaxies from @xcite with auxiliary data compiled in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and subsequent papers ) . in  [",
    "s : correlations ] we fit separately the relations @xmath5@xmath3 and @xmath1@xmath3 in these galaxies to establish the residual correlation between @xmath1  and @xmath5 .",
    "then we combine this residual slope with knowledge of the @xmath0@xmath5 correlation at fixed @xmath3 from the bhfp , and calculate the residual correlation and scatter expected between @xmath1  and @xmath0 .",
    "we summarize and conclude in  [ s : conclusions ] .",
    "to determine the dependence of @xmath1  on @xmath5 at fixed @xmath3 , we cross - match objects compiled in @xcite and subsequent works with the acs virgo cluster survey ( vcc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , from which @xcite determined globular cluster counts ( @xmath1 ) and uncertainties . following bt10 , we obtained @xmath1  for several additional galaxies from @xcite .",
    "we obtained stellar masses and uncertainties from @xcite and @xcite , who compiled photometric data from several authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "we use velocity dispersions as compiled by @xcite .",
    "the latter quantity is the one best - determined for nearby massive galaxies , so we assume a log - uniform uncertainty in @xmath3 of 0.02 dex , consistent with literature values . this approach yields 33 galaxies for which we will determine the residual correlation between @xmath1  and @xmath5 . we discard the known recent merger remnant ngc1316 because its nuclear velocity dispersion is unrelaxed and the globular cluster system is actively evolving @xcite .",
    "the galaxy properties used to analyze this 32-galaxy sample are provided in table  [ table:1 ] .",
    "in addition , we will utilize the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath3 data directly from table 1 of bt10 ( compiled mostly from @xcite ) , and the @xmath0 , @xmath1  data from table 1 of hh10 .",
    "for the latter , we use the mean recorded @xmath3 values from the hyperleda database @xcite .",
    "these two sources yield 21 galaxies that serve as a combined comparison sample ( table  [ table:2 ] ) for our derived @xmath0@xmath1  residual correlation .",
    "we note that bt10 and hh10 use slightly different , but statistically consistent , values for @xmath1  where the samples overlap .",
    "the differing values of @xmath0  may make a larger difference in cases where multiple measurements exist ; here , we follow bt10 and give half weight to each in our fits .",
    "furthermore , different studies provide different values for the velocity dispersion of a given galaxy ; for example , hyperleda returns @xmath3 values @xmath610 - 20 km / s smaller than the ones from bt10 , and the papers by hopkins et al .",
    "provide values that differ by @xmath710 - 20 km / s .",
    "we computed the observed residual @xmath1@xmath0  correlation using these alternate sources of @xmath3 , and find that the small changes this introduces leave our conclusions completely unchanged .",
    "both the bhfp and @xmath0@xmath1  relation appear to perform better than the @xmath0@xmath3 relation because they explain its residuals and hence have a smaller intrinsic dispersion .",
    "rigorously , this can be restated as follows : at fixed @xmath3 , the residuals in @xmath0  correlate tightly with the residuals in @xmath1  and in @xmath8 for the bhfp .",
    "the question then arises : does @xmath1  directly explain the residuals in @xmath0 , or could the latter be attributed to other variables already proposed ? specifically , we examine whether the observed @xmath1@xmath0  relation is predicted as an indirect consequence of the bhfp relation .",
    "this is motivated by the bhfp prediction that at fixed @xmath3 , good tracers of the bulge binding energy correlate tightly with the residuals in @xmath0 .",
    "( interestingly , a similar relation was shown for the binding energies of individual milky way globulars by @xcite . )",
    "an approximation to the bulge binding energy in ellipticals is a quantity like @xmath9 , so that at fixed @xmath3 , galaxies with larger @xmath5 will have a greater binding energy .",
    "thus , if @xmath1  adequately traces @xmath5 at fixed @xmath3 , as might be natural given the observed @xmath1galaxy correlations , then the tightness of the @xmath1-@xmath0  relation is expected .    in this work ,",
    "we focus on a particular projection of the bhfp that uses the bulge binding energy as the driving parameter",
    ". however , we note that the general bhfp , and also the corresponding salient relation for gcs ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * and subsequent works ) depends on galaxy formation history in a more complicated way @xcite .",
    "thus while the bulge binding energy serves adequately for our purposes , a more detailed accounting of , for example , the total baryon mass may lead to an even tighter expected correspondence .",
    "as follows , we calculate the expected residuals in @xmath1@xmath0  assuming that this relation is a consequence of the bhfp and no other physics . as an expression of the bhfp correlation",
    ", we use the relation between the mass of the smbh and bulge binding energy from @xcite , @xmath10 where @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "we will denote this quantity as predicted from the other observed variables as @xmath13@xmath0@xmath14bhfp@xmath15 .",
    "then we subtract from this the logarithm of @xmath0  as predicted solely from @xmath0@xmath3 , denoted by @xmath13@xmath0@xmath16 , to obtain the bhfp - predicted residual correlation between @xmath0  and @xmath5 .",
    "we will signify this difference in logarithmic quantities as @xmath17 ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) : @xmath20 this is just the statement that at fixed @xmath3 , @xmath0  @xmath21 .    if there exists a relation between @xmath19 and @xmath18 : @xmath22 this will therefore result in a correlation between @xmath23@xmath1  and @xmath23@xmath0 : @xmath24    to test this , we first calculate @xmath25 from the existing data to establish a correlation between @xmath1  and @xmath5 at fixed velocity dispersion @xmath3 ( figure  [ fig:1 ] ) , and then combine it with the bhfp to create a prediction for the @xmath1@xmath0  residuals . then , in figure  [ fig:2 ] , we compare this prediction to the observed residual correlation between @xmath1  and @xmath0  from bt10 and hh10 .    specifically , we begin by determining the observed best - fit linear correlations between @xmath26 and @xmath27 , and @xmath28 and @xmath27 .",
    "the resulting fits are shown in the top two panels of figure  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "we undertake all fits using two methods : the @xmath29-minimization methods of @xcite ( hereafter , t02 ) , and the bivariate correlated errors and intrinsic scatter ( bces ) estimators of @xcite . for the former ,",
    "we account for intrinsic scatter in the y axis by adding a uniform scatter in quadrature with the measurement errors such that the reduced-@xmath29 value of the fit is 1 . for the latter ,",
    "we choose the regression line that bisects the bces(y@xmath14x ) and bces(x@xmath14y ) curves . altering these choices",
    "leads to small changes in the residual values , but does not change the residual slope in a statistically significant way .",
    "one - sigma uncertainties in the fitted slopes are calculated using paired nonparametric bootstrap simulations @xcite .    for each object",
    ", we then use the fitted relation to compute the expected value of @xmath26 ( @xmath28 ) given its observed value of @xmath3 , and subtract it from the observed value of @xmath26 ( @xmath28 ) to obtain @xmath19 ( @xmath18 ) . in the lower left panel of figure  [ fig:1 ] ,",
    "as expected we see a clear positive correlation between @xmath23@xmath1  and @xmath18 , indicating that at a fixed @xmath3 , elliptical galaxies with more globular clusters also have a larger total stellar mass .",
    "we note that the values of @xmath23@xmath1  and @xmath23@xmath0  calculated using bces or @xmath29-minimization on the direct correlations are the same to within 0.1 dex .",
    "subsequent estimates of the residual slope are unaffected by this choice .",
    "however , the two fitting methods obtain somewhat different estimates for the slope of the resulting residual correlation , @xmath25 , which we will use to estimate the expected @xmath1@xmath0  residual slope @xmath30 .",
    "as plotted in figure  [ fig:1 ] , we find @xmath31 and correspondingly , @xmath32    in figure  [ fig:2 ] , we compare this predicted slope with the one observed in the comparison sample of bt10 and hh10 .",
    "again , we compute the residuals against @xmath3 in both @xmath1  and @xmath0 ; note that for consistency , this is slightly different than the quantities plotted in bt10 s figure 3 where the @xmath1  residual was computed against the bulge luminosity , not velocity dispersion .",
    "we plot a region in light gray to highlight the extremes of the predicted slopes , corresponding to the range bounded by the 1-sigma uncertainties in the slope given by our two regression methods . in darker gray",
    "we simply plot the range bounded by our two slope estimates .    as in figure",
    "[ fig:1 ] , we fit the data directly and find that the observed residual slope between @xmath1  and @xmath0  is @xmath33 in good agreement with the bhfp predictions above .",
    "the detection of this residual correlation by bt10 quantitatively demonstrates that @xmath1  is a better predictor of @xmath0  than is @xmath3 .",
    "such a comparison can be alternatively phrased as a reduction in the intrinsic scatter of the correlation . in bt10 ,",
    "the intrinsic scatter of @xmath0@xmath3 was found to be @xmath34 dex , while the intrinsic scatter in @xmath1@xmath0  is @xmath35 dex .",
    "the magnitude of this dispersion can be predicted by combining the bhfp relation with the observed correlations with @xmath1 . from @xcite",
    ", we see that the @xmath0@xmath36 correlation has an intrinsic scatter @xmath37-@xmath38 dex , and from the present data , we find the scatter of @xmath36@xmath1  is @xmath39 dex . by propagating these as measurement uncertainties to the @xmath0@xmath1  relation , we predict that the measured @xmath1@xmath0  intrinsic scatter should be @xmath40 dex , consistent with the measurement by bt10 .",
    "it is also consistent with the combined dataset of bt10 and hh10 , for which we find @xmath41 dex .",
    "we have shown that the number of globular clusters in elliptical galaxies exhibits a residual dependence on @xmath5 at fixed @xmath3 , implying that the bulge binding energy ( @xmath42 ) is a better indicator of @xmath1  than @xmath3 or @xmath5 alone .",
    "the same was shown to be true for @xmath0  by @xcite , as these parameters constitute a formulation of the bhfp .",
    "thus the apparent power of @xmath0@xmath1  versus @xmath0@xmath3 owes to the fact that @xmath1  and @xmath0  are both tracers of the same fundamental property such as the bulge binding energy .",
    "this resolves several puzzling aspects of the previous interpretation of the data . as bt10 themselves point out",
    ", there can not be a direct causal correlation between @xmath1  and @xmath0 , since most of the gc mass is at very large radii and has never had any interaction with the galaxy nucleus .",
    "moreover , while most gcs likely formed at very high redshift , the final mass of the smbh is sensitive to its growth via gas accretion at @xmath43 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , this naturally predicts that @xmath1  should serve reasonably well as a mass tracer , so that the dependence of @xmath0  on @xmath5 and formation time leads to a surprisingly tight but expected @xmath1@xmath0  correlation .",
    "the same arguments explain the result in @xcite , who show that the observed @xmath0  is sensitive to the entire galaxy baryonic mass  i.e. perhaps the mass traced by @xmath1  is the same as the mass that actually sets the escape velocity and potential well depth at @xmath44 , rather than just the stellar mass enclosed in a small radius around the bh , which can vary widely in systems of similar @xmath0 .",
    "such a relation between @xmath1  and global galaxy mass or luminosity has been demonstrated ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and this trait supports the idea that @xmath1  and @xmath0  are connected indirectly by a more fundamental galaxy property .",
    "this also naturally explains why hh10 find that the relation breaks down for s0 galaxies .",
    "these galaxies are structurally different than ellipticals and may have different formation histories @xcite , so @xmath1  and the total stellar mass may not faithfully trace the bulge binding energy . since s0 s are not particularly discrepant in @xmath0@xmath3 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and previous works ) , this suggests that the @xmath1bulge relation is the connection that weakens for these systems .",
    "hh10 also find no statistically significant correlation in spirals : although three out of the four spirals from hh10 lie on the @xmath1@xmath0  relation , there simply is nt yet enough data to know for sure if this relation persists for spiral bulges .",
    "however , the underlying bhfp relation ties @xmath0  to the binding energy and explains its residual correlations with bulge parameters , even for these disky galaxies where @xmath1  possibly deviates .",
    "this alone suggests that the bhfp , not @xmath0@xmath1  or @xmath0@xmath3 , is the ` more fundamental ' correlation .",
    "@xcite showed that the existence of a black hole fundamental plane is a robust prediction of numerical simulations of gas - rich mergers that include the effects of gas dissipation , cooling , star formation , and black hole accretion and feedback .",
    "the present work shows that this local and widely expected correlation between supermassive black hole mass and bulge binding energy in feedback - regulated scenarios , combined with a similar correlation for @xmath1 , can account for the observed @xmath1@xmath0  relation and its scatter .",
    "the interesting question raised by such a correlation is _ not _ why @xmath1  correlates tightly with @xmath0 , since this is indirect , but why @xmath1  correlates tightly with galaxy binding energy / potential well depth .",
    "some such correlation is expected and observed @xcite : an example is that systems at fixed velocity dispersion with higher stellar mass have accreted or formed more stars , likely including globular clusters . but that the @xmath1bulge relation should be so tight , and include both metal - rich and metal - poor populations , may support the inferences by bt10 and hh10 ( and references therein ) that the formation of globular cluster systems and growth of supermassive black holes in elliptical galaxies are driven by a common galaxy property .",
