    "the evidence for the existence of massive objects that are compact enough to be black holes is strong , although there is as yet no direct evidence of any mass that is contained within its schwarzschild radius .",
    "supermassive compact objects have been found in the nuclei of most galaxies , while objects of stellar mass are abundant within our own and other galaxies .",
    "they are commonly called black holes nowadays , though no compelling evidence of an event horizon , the quintessential feature of a black hole , has yet been found .",
    "it is true that in quiescent states of galactic black hole candidates ( gbhc ) there are no thermal soft x - ray emission peaks , such as those possibly seen in some neutron star ( ns ) systems .",
    "these less luminous x - ray emissions of quiescent gbhc compared to quiescent ns have been attributed to the presence of an event horizon [ narayan , garcia & mcclintock 1997 ] , but not compellingly so [ abramowicz , kluzniak & lasota 2002 ] . although no thermal peak has been discerned for quiescent gbhc , both gbhc and ns systems produce power - law soft x - ray spectra of photon index @xmath0 or softer for lower luminosities .",
    "we show that these emissions from quiescent ns systems are clearly magnetospheric in origin . in the magnetic ,",
    "eternally collapsing object ( meco ) model of bhc which we explore here , the similar quiescent spectra of gbhc originate in the same way , but at lower luminosity due , primarily , to slower rates of spin for the gbhc . for a given magnetic moment",
    ", the radiation rate depends on the fourth power of the spin frequency .",
    "the meco model is fully compatible with general relativity .",
    "the great strength of the meco model is that it allows a unified description of all of the various spectral , luminosity , and rapid variability states of x - ray novae , whether ns or gbhc .",
    "we show that it can be extended also to the realm of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . in following sections and appendixes",
    "we provide the general relativistic theoretical basis for the existence of meco , describe their physical characteristics , their interactions with accretion disks , their abilities to power jets and describe how the various spectral states are related to the meco - magnetosphere - disk interactions . to avoid interrupting the presentation of ideas that are closely tied to observational issues",
    ", we have placed several separate topics in the appendixes and have referred to them as needed .",
    "the details in appendix d are central to our understanding of the physics that dictates the large redshifts of the meco model .",
    "the radiating meco model is necessarily described by the vaidya metric , for which there is no transformation to the kerr - schild coordinates used in many black hole models .",
    "the similarities of ns and gbhc properties , particularly in low and quiescent states , have been previously noted , [ e.g. van der klis 1994 , tanaka & shibazaki 1996 ] .",
    "jets and their synchrotron emissions in ns , gbhc and agn also have obvious magnetic signatures .",
    "it is axiomatic that astrophysical objects of stellar mass and beyond have magnetic moments if they are not black holes , but an intrinsic magnetic moment is not a permissible attribute of a black hole . yet in earlier work , [ robertson & leiter 2002 ] we presented evidence for the existence of intrinsic magnetic moments of @xmath1 gauss @xmath2 in the gbhc of lmxb .",
    "these findings are recapitulated and extended in table 1 and appendix c. calculated values in table 1 ( see also section 8) have been corrected using a more recent correlation of spin - down energy loss rate and soft x - ray luminosity [ possenti et al .",
    "2002 ] , but results are scarcely changed from the previous work [ robertson & leiter 2002 ] except for new additions listed in bold font .",
    "observational luminosity and spectral data were analyzed to obtain magnetic moments and spins of the objects in the table .",
    "these magnetic moments and spin rates were then used to predict quiescent luminosities @xmath3 times less luminous than those analyzed .",
    "the accurate predictions of quiescent luminosities and predicted spin rates comparable to those observed in ns burst oscillations [ strohmayer & markwart 2002 , chakrabarty et al .",
    "2003 ] are very powerful confirmation of the magnetospheric origin of quiescent power - law luminosity .",
    "the magnetic moments are reassuringly similar in magnitude to those determined from the spin - down rates of similarly rotating millisecond pulsars . combined with rotation rates in the range 1 - 40 hz ,",
    "the gbhc magnetic moments provide a robust unified mechanism for the x - ray spectral state switches observed in gbhc and ns , a common origin of quiescent power - law emissions as spin - down luminosity , and a unified driving mechanism for the ubiquitous low - state jets and synchrotron emissions of both .",
    "we have shown [ robertson & leiter 2004 and section 10 ] that the jet mechanism scales up to the agn without difficulty .",
    "magnetosphere topology also serves to stabilize the inner accretion disk in lmxb [ arons et al .",

    "for example , comptonizing coronae near event horizons , bulk flow comptonization and magnetic flares on accretion disks have all been invoked to explain the hard spectral tail of low state gbhc . but the observed ingress / egress times for dipping sources imply large radiating regions [ church 2001 ] that are inconsistent with the compact corona models and can be consistent with bulk comptonization models only for large scale outflows .",
    "similarly , radiatively inefficient advective accretion flows ( adaf ) at high accretion rates have been proposed to explain the quiescent power - law emissions of gbhc , [ narayan et al .",
    "1997 , garcia et al . 2001 ] , while ignoring the fact that we have explained the similar emissions of accreting millisecond pulsars and the ns of lmxb via magnetospheric spin - down .",
    "it is also very disconcerting that adaf models are clearly excluded for ns systems .",
    "the adaf accretion rates are so high that the only way to accommodate them would be to have a very efficient magnetic propeller mechanism to prevent the flow from reaching the ns surface and producing very non - quiescent levels ( @xmath11 ) of emission .",
    "but if a magnetic propeller expels a low - state adaf flow , then quiescent ns would necessarily be extremely strong radio sources , contrary to observations .",
    "stating the similarities of gbhc and ns systems more bluntly , cir x-1 , a burster and a ` z track ' source with a magnetic moment similar to those we have found for gbhc [ table 1 and iaria et al . 2001 ] , exhibits all of the x - ray spectral and timing characteristics that have been proposed at various times as distinguishing features of black holes . both cir x-1 and cygnus x-3 , a pulsar microquasar , [ brazier et al .",
    "1990 , mitra 1998 ] are strong jet and radio sources similar to gbhc cygnus x-1 and gx 339 - 4",
    ". a unified model of gbhc and ns is clearly needed .",
    "it is difficult to understand how such common behaviors of obviously magnetic origin could be produced both with and without event horizons .",
    "others have reported evidence for strong magnetic fields in gbhc .",
    "a field in excess of @xmath12 g has been found at the base of the jets of grs 1915 + 105 [ gliozzi , bodo & ghisellini 1999 , vadawale , rao & chakrabarti 2001 ] .",
    "a recent study of optical polarization of cygnus x-1 in its low state [ gnedin et al .",
    "2003 ] has found a slow gbhc spin and a magnetic field of @xmath13 gauss at the location of its optical emission .",
    "these field strengths exceed disk plasma equipartition levels , but given the @xmath14 dependence of field strength on magnetic moment , the implied magnetic moments are in very good agreement with those we report in table 1 . a recent correlation [ mauche et al .",
    "2002 , warner & woudt 2003 ] of quasi - periodic oscillation ( qpo ) frequencies extending over six orders of magnitude in frequency , from dwarf novae to neutron stars shows points for gbhc squarely in the middle of the correlation line .",
    "if the higher of the correlated frequencies is generated where the inner radius of an accretion disk interacts with a magnetosphere [ goodson , bohm & winglee 1999 , titarchuk & wood 2002 ] , this would be additional evidence of intrinsic magnetic moments for gbhc .",
    "a relativistic frame - dragging explanation of these qpo is surely not applicable .",
    "although there are widely studied models for generating magnetic fields in accretion disks , they can produce equipartition fields at best [ livio , ogilvie & pringle 1999 ] , and perhaps at the expense of being too luminous [ bisnovatyi - kogan & lovelace 2000 ] in quiescence and in any case , too weak and comoving in accretion disks to drive jets .",
    "while tangled magnetic fields in accretion disks are very likely responsible for their large viscosity , [ e.g. hawley , balbus & winters 1999 ] the highly variable mass accretion rates in lmxb make it unlikely that disk dynamos could produce the stability of fields needed to account for either spectral state switches or quiescent spin - down luminosities .",
    "both require magnetic fields co - rotating with the central object .",
    "further , if disk dynamos produced the much larger apparent magnetic moments of gbhc , they should produce them also for the ns systems and cause profound qualitative spectral and timing differences from gbhc due to interactions with the intrinsic ns magnetic moments .",
    "such qualitative differences as have been observed , e.g. , the hard spectral tail of the steep power law ( intermediate ) state , lack of surface bursts for gbhc and stronger gbhc jets , ( excepting ns cir x-1 and cygnus x-3 ) are easily explained by differences in masses , magnetic field strengths and surface redshift .",
    "not only are there are no observed differences that require explanation in terms of event horizons [ abramowicz , kluzniak & lasota 2002 ] , there appear to be none that would be consistent with having two different magnetic structures for ns and only one gbhc .",
    "it has been suggested that stable magnetic fields could be produced by electrically charged , rotating black holes [ punsly 1998 , gnedin et al .",
    "2003 ] , however the charge necessary to endow cygnus x-1 with a @xmath12 g magnetic field , well out in the accretion disk , was found to be @xmath15 esu [ gnedin et al .",
    "due to the large charge / mass ratios of accreting protons or electrons , this quantity of charge on a black hole would produce electric forces at least @xmath16 larger than the gravitational attraction of a @xmath17 gbhc , thus causing charges of one sign to be swallowed and the other to be blown away . at accretion rates needed to account for the x - ray luminosity of cygnus x-1 , the original charge",
    "would be neutralized in a fraction of one second .",
    "thus it appears that current black hole models are unable to offer unified explanations of such obviously magnetic phenomena as jets , spectral state switches and quiescent synchrotron emissions and if they could , it seems unusually generous for nature to have provided different mechanisms by which ns and gbhc could produce such strikingly similar phenomena . in table 1 , we have provided solid evidence for the applicability of a spinning magnetic moment model of lmxb and we have presented reasons for considering these magnetic moments to be intrinsic to the central object rather than being generated within an accretion disks . while accommodating intrinsic magnetic moments in models of gbhc will require abandoning the currently popular black hole theory of gbhc",
    ", it will also greatly simplify the problem of understanding the spectral , timing and jet ejection mechanisms of compact objects . as noted by abramowicz , kluzniak & lasota [ 2002 ] ,",
    "it is unlikely that we will ever find direct observational proof of an event horizon , however , we may be able to definitively determine whether or not gbhc have intrinsic magnetic moments .",
    "we regard table 1 as strongly suggestive , if not yet definitive .",
    "if gbhc are not black holes , they would almost certainly be magnetized , and likely to at least a degree similar to their compact ns cousins . in our meco model",
    ", we have found that it is possible to virtually stop and maintain a slow , ( many hubble times ! ) steady collapse of a compact physical plasma object outside of its schwarzschild radius with photon pressure generated by synchrotron radiation from an equipartition surface magnetic field . to control the rate of collapse",
    ", the object must radiate at the local eddington limit , but from a highly redshifted surface .",
    "( see appendices d and e. ) there is recent evidence for the presence of such extreme magnetic fields in gravitational collapse .",
    "equipartition magnetic fields have been implicated as the driver of grb 021206 [ coburn & boggs 2003 ] and fields much in excess of those expected from mere flux compression during stellar collapse have been found in magnetars [ ibrahim , swank & parke 2003 ] .",
    "kluzniak and ruderman [ 1998 ] have described the generation of @xmath18 g magnetic fields via differential rotation in neutron stars . in appendix d , we show that surface drift currents within a pair plasma at the meco surface generate its required fields .",
    "drift currents proportional to @xmath19 occur for plasmas at rest in gravitational and magnetic fields .",
    "the equatorial poloidal magnetic field needed for a stable rate of collapse of the exterior surface is @xmath20 .",
    "fields of this magnitude are strong enough to create bound electron - positron pairs out of the quantum electrodynamic vacuum .",
    "this assures sufficient photon pressure from annihilation radiation to stabilize the collapse rate .",
    "the magnetic field of the interior is approximately what one would expect from flux compression during collapse , @xmath21 gauss and its radial component is continuous across the surface boundary .",
    "the poloidal field is discontinuous across the surface and much stronger externally due to the surface drift currents .",
    "as shown in appendix d , at the meco surface radius @xmath22 , the ratio of poloidal field on the surface to the poloidal field just under the meco surface is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the surface redshift .",
    "this has the solution @xmath25 the distantly observed field is reduced by a surface redshift of by a factor of @xmath26 to a level which agrees well with the observed magnetic moments shown in table 1 .",
    "the surface luminosity is reduced below the conventional newtonian eddington limit by @xmath27 when distantly observed , and the decay lifetime is extended by the same factor .",
    "astrophysicists nowadays generally accept the inevitability of the curvature singularities of black holes , nevertheless , hilbert s solution is analytically extendible through the horizon to a central singularity , hence the modern black hole .",
    "the fact that the radius of the event horizon , which is directly proportional to the gravitational mass , can be changed arbitrarily by ( generally singular ) coordinate transformation strongly suggests that the horizon is unphysical .",
    "] however , if the gbhc are confirmed as intrinsically magnetized , this will be nature s way of telling us that such singularities are not really permitted to exist .",
    "for black holes to exist , gravity must be able to do what no other force of nature can do ; namely , to accelerate the physical three - speed of a finite mass to exactly the speed of light .",
    "but this means that horizon crossing geodesics , in realistic coordinates , would become null rather than timelike . in general relativity ( gr )",
    "the strong principle of equivalence ( spoe ) requires that special relativity ( sr ) must hold locally for all time - like observers in all of spacetime .",
    "this spoe requirement is a tensor relationship that implies that ( i ) the spacetime manifold for observers located in field - free regions , distant from gravitating masses , must approach the flat spacetime of sr and ( ii ) the spacetime world lines of massive matter must always be timelike .",
    ", at the schwarzschild radius is sufficient to cause the timelike physical three - speed of particles in radial free fall to approach the speed of light there . in obvious notation , [ landau & lifshitz 1975 ] .",
    "@xmath28 where @xmath29 . in non - singular finkelstein or kerr - schild coordinates ,",
    "for which @xmath30 , we find @xmath31 as @xmath32 .",
    "it has been shown [ leiter & robertson 2003 ] that @xmath33 at surfaces of infinite redshift . in kruskal - szekeres",
    "coordinates , in which @xmath34 does not vanish , there is no surface of infinite redshift at the schwarzschild radius , @xmath35 , and timelike test particle geodesics can traverse it _ in either direction _",
    ", so long as the initial conditions are chosen in a manner that permits the ` time ' coordinate to change in a positive sense .",
    "however , a central singularity still exists in these coordinates and they have a surface of infinite redshift as @xmath36 , at which @xmath37 .",
    "this is an extreme example of a coordinate transformation changing the size of the event horizon radius . ]",
    "such spacetime manifolds are known as ` bundle complete ' [ wheeler & ciuofolini 1995 ] . as a guiding principle , we look for solutions of the einstein equations @xmath38 that satisfy the spoe requirement for timelike world line completeness . since there is nothing in the einstein tensor @xmath39 that enforces this condition , we must rely on non - gravitational forces in @xmath40 to dynamically enforce it .",
    "since the energy - momentum tensor @xmath41 serves as both a source of curvature in the einstein equations and a generator of the equations of motion of matter , constraints on @xmath41 that enforce timelike world line completeness can also eliminate the occurrence of event horizons .",
    "thus the spoe requires that the right hand side of the gr field equation must contain non - gravitational elements capable of stopping the collapse of physical matter before the formation of a ` trapped surface ' .",
    "this dynamically escapes the hawking and penrose theorem which states that once a trapped surface is formed , an event horizon and curvature singularities are unavoidable",
    ". we can show how the spoe constrains the solutions of the einstein field equations .",
    "consider a comoving interior metric given by @xmath42 and an exterior vaidya metric with outgoing radiation @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the areal radius and @xmath45 is the retarded observer time .",
    "following lindquist , schwarz & misner [ 1965 ] , we define @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48 @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a proper length element in a zero angular momentum comoving frame , @xmath51 an increment of proper time , @xmath52 is the proper time rate of change of the radius associated with the invariant circumference of the collapsing mass , and @xmath53 is the mass enclosed within this radius .",

    "( 10 ) we see that in order to avoid a violation of the requirement of timelike world line completenes for @xmath56 , it is necessary to dynamically enforce the ` no trapped surface condition . ' and later corroborated by leiter & robertson [ 2003 ] that eq.s ( 7 - 9 ) and the @xmath54 field equation in a zero angular momentum comoving frame produces the ` no trapped surface condition ' for any interior r(r , t ) . for the meco , timelike world line completeness is maintained by photon pressure generated by the equipartition magnetic field everywhere in the comoving frame .",
    "we can consider any interior location and the radiation flux there without requiring a joined vaidya metric .",
    "but there will ultimately be an outer radiating boundary and the required match to the non - singular outgoing exterior vaidya",
    "metric guarantees that there will be no metric singularity there . ]",
    "the simplest form of the energy - momentum tensor that can satisfy the spoe requirement of timelike world line completeness , is one that describes a collapsing , radiating plasma with an equipartition magnetic field that emits outgoing radiation . between the extremes of pure magnetic energy [ thorne 1965 ] and",
    "weakly magnetic , radiation dominated polytropic gases or pressureless dust [ baumgarte & shapiro 2003 ] there are cases where the rate of collapse can be stable .",
    "to first order , in an eddington limited radiation dominated context , these can be described by the energy momentum tensor : @xmath58 where @xmath59 , @xmath60 describes outgoing radiation in a geometric optics approximation , @xmath61 is energy density of matter and @xmath62 the pressure . )",

    "among the various equations associated with the collapse process there are three proper time differential equations applicable to a compact collapsing and radiating physical surface . when evaluated on the physical surface [ hernandez jr .",
    "& misner , 1966 , lindquist , schwartz & misner 1965 , misner 1965 , lindquist , 1966 ] these equations are : @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70 in eddington limited steady collapse , the conditions @xmath71 and @xmath72 hold after some time , @xmath73 , that has elaspsed in reaching the eddington limited state .",
    "then @xmath74 where @xmath75 includes the magnetic field energy in the pressure term and radiant energy in q. eq . ( 19 ) when integrated over a closed surface can be solved for the net outward flow of eddington limited luminosity through the surface .",
    "taking the escape cone factor of @xmath76 into account , where @xmath77 , ( see appendix a ) the outflowing ( but not all escaping ) surface luminosity , l , would be @xmath78 where @xmath79 @xmath80 is the plasma opacity .",
    "( for simplicity , we have assumed here that the luminosity actually escapes from the meco surface rather than after conveyance through a meco atmosphere and photosphere .",
    "the end result is the same for distant observers . )",
    "however the luminosity @xmath81 which appears in eq.s ( 16 - 20 ) is actually the net luminosity , which escapes through the photon sphere , and is given by @xmath82 thus in eq.s ( 17 ) and ( 18 ) , the @xmath81 appearing there is given by @xmath83 in this context from eq.s ( 9 ) , ( 10 ) , ( 17 ) and ( 22 ) we have @xmath84 which can be integrated to give @xmath85 this yield a distantly observed meco lifetime of @xmath86 yr for @xmath87 .",
    "finally , equation ( 18 ) becomes @xmath88 which , in view of ( 13 ) has the solution @xmath89 which is consistent with eq.s ( 9 ) and ( 11 ) .",
    "if one naively attributes eddington limit luminosity to purely thermal processes , one quickly finds that the required meco surface temperatures would be so high that photon energies would be far beyond the pair production threshhold and the compactness would assure that photon - photon collisions would produce numerous electron - positron pairs .",
    "thus the meco surface region must be dominated by a pair plasma .",
    "pelletier & marcowith [ 1998 ] have shown that the energy density of magnetic perturbations in equipartition pair plasmas is preferentially converted to photon pressure , rather than causing particle acceleration .",
    "the radiative power of an equipartition pair plasma is proportional to @xmath90 , ( pair density @xmath91 and synchrotron energy production @xmath91 . )",
    "lacking the equipartition pair plasma , magnetic stress , @xmath92 , and gravitational stress , @xmath93 , on mass density @xmath61 , would both increase as @xmath94 during gravitational collapse .",
    "magnetic fields much below equipartition levels would be incapable of stopping the collapse",
    ". however , since photon pressure generated by the pairs at equipartition increases more rapidly than gravitational stresses , it is possible to stabilize the rate of collapse at an eddington limit rate . with this extremely efficient photon - photon pair production mechanism ,",
    "the radiation temperature and pressure is buffered near the pair production threshold by two types of highly redshifted quantum electrodynamic phase transitions which convert photons into pairs on the meco surface .",
    "the first one involves optically thick photon - photon pair production while the second one occurs for meco surface magnetic fields strong enough to create bound pairs out of the quantum electrodynamic vacuum . in the context of an eddington limited balance generated by the former process",
    ", the latter process can lead to excess production of pairs , followed by excess photon pressure and an expansion of the meco surface . in this manner",
    "the meco eddington limited collapse rate is inherently stable ( see appendix d and e ) .",
    "stability is maintained by increased ( decreased ) photon pressure ( @xmath95 ) if the field is increased ( decreased ) by compression or expansion .",
    "for equipartition conditions , the field also exceeds that required to confine the pair plasma .",
    "since the photon luminosity is not confined to the core it will not be trapped , as occurs with neutrinos , however , the radiation should be thermalized as it diffuses through an optically thick environment . _ to reduce the field to the distantly observed levels implied by our analysis of gbhc observations would require the existence of a red shift of @xmath96 ( see appendixes d and e)_. the residual , distantly observable magnetic moment and extremely faint , redshifted radiations would be the only things that would distinguish such an object from a black hole .",
    "erg / s [ shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ] were capable of very briefly sustaining a neutrino eddington limit rate of collapse , then the subsequent reduction of neutrino luminosity as neutrino emissions are depleted and trapped in the core would lead to an adiabatic collapse , magnetic flux compression , and photon emissions reaching an eddington limit . at this point",
    "the photon luminosity would need to support a smaller diameter and more tightly gravitationally bound mass .",
    "a new photon eddington balance would thus require an escaping luminosity reduced by at least the @xmath97 opacity ratio @xmath98 , where @xmath99 @xmath100 is the thompson cross section and @xmath101 @xmath100 is the neutrino scattering cross - section .",

    "the adiabatic relaxation of neutrino support and formation of a pair plasma is an important step in gravitational collapse that is not encompassed by polytropic equation of state models of collapse .",
    "it is of some interest that if neutrinos have non - zero rest mass they might be trapped inside the photon sphere anyway . ]",
    "an electron - positron pair atmosphere of a meco is an extremely significant structure that conveys radiation from the meco surface to a zone with a much lower red shift and larger escape cone from which it escapes . in order to describe this process computationally within a numerical grid , a radial grid interval no larger than @xmath104",
    "would be needed , where @xmath105 is the gravitational radius .",
    "although there have been many numerical studies of the behavior of collapsing compact objects in gr , to our knowledge none have sufficient numerical resolution to examine the extreme red shift regime associated with meco nor have they considered the emergent properties of equipartition magnetic fields and pair plasmas at high red shift . until computer models of gravitational collapse",
    "encompass these crucial physical and computational elements , simulations that apparently produce black hole states must be regarded as mere speculations .",
    "the quiescent luminosity of a meco originates deep within its photon sphere . when distantly observed it is diminished by both gravitational red shift and a narrow exit cone .",

    "recapitulating , we expect the high state flow into the meco to produce a distantly observed soft thermal component , part of which is strongly bulk comptonized .",
    "* quasi - periodic oscillations * + although many mechanisms have been proposed for the high frequency quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpo ) of x - ray luminosity , they often require conditions that are incompatible with thin , viscous keplerian disks .",
    "several models have requirements for lumpy flows , elliptical inner disk boundaries , orbits out of the disk plane or conditions that should produce little radiated power . in a conventional thin disk , the vertical oscillation frequency , which is approximately the same as the keplerian frequency of the inner viscous disk radius should generate ample power .",
    "accreting plasma should periodically wind the poloidal meco magnetic field into toroidal configurations until the field lines break and reconnect across the disk .",
    "field reconnection across the disk should produce high frequency oscillations that couple to the vertical oscillations .",
    "if so , there would be an automatic association of high frequency qpo with the harder power - law spectra of magnetospherically driven emissions , as is observed .",
    "mass ejection in low state jets might be related to the heating of plasma via the field breakage mechanism , in addition to natural buoyancy of a plasma magnetic torus in a poloidal external field .",
    "it seems possible that toroidal winding and reconnection of field lines at the magnetopause , might continue in high states inside @xmath144 .",
    "if so , there might be qpo that could be identified as signatures of the meco magnetosphere .",
    "if they occur deep within the magnetosphere , they might be at locally very high frequencies , and be observed distantly as very redshifted low frequencies . as shown in appendix a , the spiral orbit infall frequencies in the plunging region inside @xmath144 are given by @xmath307 hz .",
    "a maximum frequency of 437 hz would occur for m=10 at the photon orbit . of more interest",
    ", however are frequencies for @xmath308 , for which @xmath309 hz . for @xmath310 ; conditions that might apply to the photosphere region , @xmath311 hz could be produced . in this regard , one could expect significant time lags between inner disk accretion and luminosity fluctuations and their echoes from the central highly redshifted meco .",
    "even if qpo are not produced inside @xmath144 or inside the photon sphere for gbhc , there is an interesting scaling mismatch that might allow them to occur for agn .",
    "although the magnetic fields of agn scale as @xmath312 , the velocity of plasma at and inside @xmath144 does not .",
    "thus the energy density of disk plasma inside @xmath144 will be relatively larger than magnetic field energy densities for agn accretion disks . when field energy density is larger than kinetic energy density of matter , the field pushes matter around .",
    "when the reverse is true , the matter drags the field along .",
    "thus toroidal winding of the field at the magnetopause could fail to occur for gbhc , but might easily occur in agn .",
    "if the process is related to mass ejection , then very energetic jets with lorentz factors @xmath313 might arise from within @xmath144 for agn . a field line breakage model of ` smoke ring ' like mass",
    "ejection from deep within @xmath144 has been developed by chou & tajima [ 1999 ] . in their calculations ,",
    "a pressure of unspecified origin was needed to stop the flow outside @xmath314 and a poloidal magnetic field , also of unspecified origin was required .",
    "meco provide the necessary ingredients in the form of the intrinsic meco magnetic field .",
    "the chou & tajima mechanism , aided by intense radiation pressure , may be active inside @xmath144 for gbhc and produce extremely large episodic mass ejections such as those shown by grs 1915 + 105 . although not developed for conditions with large inner disk radius , the same magnetic reconnection mechanism probably produces the jet emissions [ goodson , bohm & winglee 1999 ] associated with the low / hard state [ gallo , fender & pooley 2003 ] .",
    "finally , some of the rich oscillatory behavior of grs 1915 + 105 may be readily explained by the interaction of the inner disk and the central meco .",
    "the objects in table 1 have co - rotation radii of order @xmath315 , which brings the low state inner disk radius in close to the central object .",
    "a low state meco , balanced near co - rotation would need only a small increase of mass flow rate to permit mass to flow on to the central meco .",
    "this would produce more than 20x additional luminosity and enough radiation pressure to blow the inner disk back beyond @xmath215 and load its mass onto the magnetic field lines where it is ejected .",
    "this also explains the association of jet outflows with the oscillatory states .",
    "belloni et al .",
    "[ 1997 ] have shown that after ejection of the inner disk of grs 1915 + 105 , it then refills on a viscous time scale until the process repeats .",
    "thus one of the most enigmatic gbhc might be understood as a relaxation oscillator , for which the frequency is set by a critical mass accretion rate .",
    "it may be possible to detect meco in several ways .",
    "firstly , as we have shown , for a red shift of @xmath316 , the quiescent luminosity of a gbhc meco would be @xmath317 erg / s with @xmath318 kev .",
    "this thermal peak might be observable for nearby gbhc , however it has not been found for the high galactic latitude gbhc , xte j1118 + 480 .",
    "secondly , at moderate luminosities @xmath319 erg / s but in a high state at least slightly above @xmath191 , a central meco would be a bright , small central object that might be sharply eclipsed in deep dipping sources .",
    "a high state meco should stand out as a small bright source .",
    "this is consistent with analyses of absorption dips in gbhc gro j1655 - 40 [ church 2001 ] which have shown the soft source of the high state to be smaller than the region that produces the hard spectral component of its low states .",
    "a conclusive demonstration that most of the soft x - ray luminosity of a high state gbhc is distributed over a large accretion disk would be inconsistent with meco or any other gbhc model entailing a central bright source .",
    "if the meco model is correct , the usual identification of the bright , high state soft component as disk emissions is wrong .",
    "fitting high state spectra to multicolor disk ( mcd ) blackbody models produces temperatures , @xmath320 , that are consistent with meco , but due to the normalization of mcd , the inner disk radii obtained are exactly @xmath321 times the radius of a meco .",
    "the apparent constant mcd radii over a large range of high state luminosity may merely misrepresent a constant meco radius that is @xmath321 times smaller .",
    "thirdly , a pair plasma atmosphere in an equipartition magnetic field should be virtually transparent to photon polarizations perpendicular to the magnetic field lines .",
    "the x - rays from the central meco should exhibit some polarization that might be detectable , though this is far from certain since the distantly observed emissions could originate from nearly any point on the photosphere and then appear to originate from the photon sphere .",
    "meco presumably would not be found only in binary systems .",
    "if they are the offspring of massive star supernovae , then they should be found all over the galaxy .",
    "if we have correctly estimated their quiescent temperatures , isolated meco - gbhc would be weak , possibly polarized , euv sources with a power - law tail in soft x - rays . in subsequent work",
    "we may find additional signatures of meco among the agn .",
    "it is now becoming apparent that many of the spectral properties of lmxb , including the gbhc , are consistent with the existence of intrinsically magnetized central objects .",
    "we have shown that the existence of intrinsically magnetic gbhc is consistent with a new class of magnetospheric eternally collapsing object ( meco ) solutions of the einstein field equations of general relativity .",
    "these solutions are based on a strict adherence to the spoe requirement for timelike world line completeness ; i.e. , that the world lines of physical matter under the influence of gravitational and non - gravitational forces must remain timelike in all regions of spacetime .",
    "since there is nothing in the structure of the einstein tensor , @xmath322 , on the left hand side of the einstein field equation that dynamically enforces ` time like world line completeness ' , we have argued that the spoe constrains the physically acceptable choices of the energy momentum tensor , @xmath40 to contain non - gravitational forces that can dynamically enforce it . in this context",
    "we have found the long - lived meco solutions .",
    "as these are necessarily based on a radiating vaidya metric , there is no transformation to the kerr - schild coordinates used in black hole models .",
    "an enormous body of physics scholarship developed primarily over the last half century has been built on the assumption that trapped surfaces leading to event horizons and curvature singularities exist .",
    "misner , thorne & wheeler [ 1973 ] , for example in sec .",
    "34.6 clearly state that this is an assumption and that it underlies the well - known singularity theorems of hawking and penrose .",
    "in contrast , we have found that strict adherence to the spoe demand for timelike world line completeness requires a _ ` no trapped surface condition'_. this has led to the quasi - stable , high red shift meco solutions of the einstein field equations .",
    "the physical mechanism of their stable rate collapse is an eddington balance maintained by the distributed photon generation of a a highly compact and redshifted equipartition magnetic field .",
    "this field also serves to confine the pair plasma dominated outer layers of the meco and the thin meco pair atmosphere .",
    "red shifts of @xmath323 have been found to be necessary for compatibility with our previously found magnetic moments for gbhc . in this chapter",
    "we have given detailed descriptions of meco properties and shown that standard gas pressure dominated ` alpha ' accretion disks would be compatible with them .",
    "we have shown that the magnetosphere / disk interaction affects nearly all of the spectral characteristics of ns and gbhc in lmxb systems and accounts for them in a unified and complete way , including jet formation and radio emissions .",
    "this model is solidly consistent with accreting ns systems , for which intrinsic magnetic moments obtained from spin - down measurements allow little choice .",
    "even their relatively weak magnetic fields are too strong to ignore .",
    "since the similar characteristics of gbhc are cleanly explained by the same model , the meco offers a unified theory of lmxb phenomenology as well as extensions to agn . since meco lifetimes are orders of magnitude greater than a hubble time , they provide an elegant and unified framework for understanding the broad range of observations associated with gbhc and agn .",
    "lastly we have indicated some ways in which the existence of meco in gbhc and agn might be detected and confirmed .",
    "a number of standard , but useful results for relativistic mechanics are recapitulated here . all",
    "are based upon the energy - momentum four - vector for a free particle in the singularity - free finkelstein or kerr - schild coordinates for a constant central mass .",
    "though not strictly compatible with radiating objects with variable mass , outgoing finkelstein coordinates are a useful first order approximation to the outgoing vaidya coordinates for low radiation rates exterior to a meco . @xmath324 the plus sign corresponds to outgoing finkelstein coordinates and the negative sign to ingoing finkelstein or kerr - schild coordinates . here",
    "for a particle in an equatorial trajectory ( @xmath326 = @xmath327 , @xmath328 ) about an object of gravitational mass m , one obtains the same equation as for schwarzschild coordinates : @xmath329 where @xmath330 is the conserved energy per unit rest mass , @xmath331 is a dimensionless , conserved angular momentum , @xmath168 is the proper time in the particle frame and the negative sign indicates movement toward @xmath332 . the metric eq .",

    "finally , it should be mentioned that the vanishing of @xmath348 for @xmath349 is actually a result of a failure to apply appropriate boundary conditions for the solutions of the einstein equations for a point mass [ abrams 1979 , 1989 ] . for suitably small energy ,",

    "this is because surface magnetic fields much larger than @xmath97 gauss would create a spontaneous quantum electrodynamic phase transition associated with the vacuum production of bound pairs on the meco surface [ zaumen 1976 ] .",
    "this would cause more pairs to be produced than those required by the eddington balance of the meco - gbhc surface .",
    "this would then cause the meco - gbhc surface to expand .",
    "however the resultant expansion due to this process would reduce the redshift and the surface poloidal magnetic field thus quenching the vacuum production of bound pairs and allowing the meco - gbhc surface to contract .",
    "this stability mechanism on the meco surface implies that its surface redshift @xmath27 can be dynamically determined from the preceding pair of equations . neglecting the trigonometric functions common to both sides of the equations , the ratio of these external field components in eq.s ( 88 ) and ( 86 ) , yields @xmath491 \\sim 10^{20}/[10^{13.4}/(m/ 7)^{1/2}]\\ ] ] for which the solution is @xmath492 in addition we obtain @xmath493 _ which implies that the average distantly observed intrinsic magnetic moment of the meco is @xmath494 this is in good agreement with our analysis of observations .",

    ", the process generates a net outward non - polytropic radiation pressure ( see appendix d ) @xmath531 on the meco surface .",
    "the increase of pressure with redshift is a key feature of the eddington limited secular balance at @xmath532 .",
    "thus trapped surfaces , which lead to event horizons , can be prevented from forming . as discussed in appendix d. ,",
    "the balance is mass scale invariantly stabilized at the threshold of magnetically produced pair breakdown of the vacuum .",
    "in discussions with experts in general relativity the validity of our motivation to look for physical alternatives to black holes has been questioned .",
    "our work has been based on the assumption that the preservation of the strong principle of equivalence ( spoe ) in nature implies that metrics with event horizons are non - physical .",
    "the objection to this has been based on the well known fact that for massive particles under the action of both gravitational and non - gravitational forces , the timelike nature of the world line of massive particles is preserved .",
    "the generally covariant equation of motion for their timelike world lines in spacetime is given by @xmath533 here @xmath534 is the four velocity of the massive particle and @xmath535 is the generally covariant non - gravitational four - vector force which in general relativity is required to obey the dynamic condition @xmath536 then from the above two equations it follows that @xmath537 which guarantees that [ where we have chosen units where c=1 and use the spacetime metric signature ( 1,-1,-1,-1 ) ] @xmath538 from this it follows that in general relativity the timelike invariance of the world line of a massive particle is dynamically preserved for all metric solutions , @xmath539 , to the einstein equations , including the case of the  event horizon penetrating \" kerr - schild metric used by most black hole theoreticians in computer simulations of the black hole collapse of a radially infalling massive particle or fluid .",
    "on the basis of the above facts it is then argued that there is no reason to look for physical alternatives to black holes and that the assumption that the preservation of the strong principle of equivalence ( spoe ) in nature implies that metrics with event horizons are non - physical , is in error .",
    "however we will now show that above arguments , which are based on the four velocity @xmath534 alone , are not valid .",
    "this is because relativists who come to this conclusion in this manner are making the mistake of ignoring the fact that in addition to the four velocity @xmath534 there exists another important quantity called the",
    " physical 3-velocity \" which must also be considered as well . physically speaking ,",
    "the magnitude of the physical 3-velocity is seen by an observer at rest as being equal to the speed of the co - moving observer who is moving along with the collapsing massive particle or fluid .",
    "if we consider the case of a radially infalling massive particle or fluid undergoing gravitational collapse it can be shown that the radial component of the physical 3-velocity is given by @xmath540^{1/2}}{|(g_{00}+ g_{0r}v^r)|}\\ ] ] where @xmath541 is the radial coordinate velocity of the massive particle of fluid ( see landau and lifshitz .",
    ", 1975  classical theory of fields \" , 4th ed , pergamon press pg 248 - 252 ) .    from the above formula for the radial component of the physical 3-velocity of the co - moving observer @xmath542",
    "we see that for metrics which have the property that @xmath347 in some region of spacetime ( i.e. the property associated with the existence of an event horizon for the non - rotating metrics associated with the radial infall of matter ) the physical radial velocity @xmath542 of the co - moving frame of the massive particle or fluid becomes equal to the speed of light as the massive particle or fluid crosses the event horizon .",
    "hence even though the timelike property @xmath543 is preserved for a massive particle or fluid crossing the event horizon of the kerr - schild metric where @xmath347 occurs , a local special relativistic connection between the co - moving frame of the radially infalling massive particle or fluid and a stationary observer can no longer be made .",
    "since the strong principle of equivalence ( spoe ) requires that special relativity must hold locally at all points in spacetime , the breakdown at the event horizon , of the local special relativistic connection between the co - moving observer frame and a stationary observer frame for a particle crossing the event horizon , represents a violation of the spoe .",
    "hence we have shown that by considering both the four velocity and the  physical 3-velocity of the co - moving observer \" there is motivation to look for physical alternatives to black holes .",
    "in fact in this context logical arguments can be consistently made which show that black holes with non - zero mass can not exist in nature ( mitra , a. , 2000 , 2002 , 2005 , 2006 ) .",
    "based on the above arguments , the spoe preserving requirement that the co - moving observer frame for a massive collapsing fluid must always be able to be connected to a stationary observer by special relativistic transformations with a physical 3-speed which is less than the speed of light , was taken seriously in our work . in the literature",
    "the requirement that the spoe must be preserved everywhere in spacetime for the timelike worldlines of massive particles or fluids under the influence of both gravitational and non - gravitational forces goes under the technical name of  timelike worldline completeness \" .",
    "based on this idea we have found that preservation of the spoe in nature can be accomplished only if there exist non - gravitational components in the energy - momentum tensor on the right hand side of the einstein equation that physically guarantee the preservation of the spoe .",
    "it was in this alternative context that the general relativistic meco solutions to the einstein - maxwell equations emerged , as was shown in the three previously published papers of robertson and leiter and developed in more detail in appendix 1 - 10 in this paper .",
    "there it was shown that for a collapsing body , the structure and radiation transfer properties of the energy - momentum tensor on the right hand side of the einstein field equations , could describe a collapsing radiating object which contained equipartition magnetic fields that generated a highly redshifted eddington limited secular collapse process .",
    "this collapse process was shown to satisfy the spoe requirement of timelike worldline completeness by dynamically preventing trapped surfaces , that lead to event horizons , from forming .",
    "more specifically in appendix a - e it was shown that , by using the einstein - maxwell equations and quantum electrodynamics in the context of general relativistic plasma astrophysics , it was possible to virtually stop and maintain a slow , ( many hubble times ! ) steady collapse of a compact physical plasma object outside of its schwarzschild radius .",
    "the non - gravitational force was compton photon pressure generated by synchrotron radiation from an intrinsic equipartition magnetic dipole field contained within the compact object .",
    "the rate of collapse is controlled by radiation at the local eddington limit , but from a highly redshifted surface . in appendix d",
    "it was shown that general relativistic surface drift currents within a pair plasma at the meco surface can generate the required magnetic fields . in appendix",
    "d the equatorial poloidal magnetic field associated with a locally eddington limited secular rate of collapse of the exterior surface was shown to be strong enough to spontaneously create bound electron - positron pairs in the surface plasma of the meco . in the context of the meco",
    "highly redshifted eddington limited balance , the action of this qed process was shown to be sufficient to stabilize the collapse rate of the meco surface .",
    "for the case of hot collapsing radiating matter associated with the meco , the corresponding exterior solution to the einstein equation was shown to be described by the time dependent vaidya metric .",
    "no coordinate transformation between meco vaidya metric and the black hole kerr - schild metric exists .",
    "since the highly redshifted meco vaidya metric solutions preserve the spoe and they do not have event horizons , they can also contain a slowly rotating intrinsic magnetic dipole moment .",
    "these magnetic moments have observable effects if such meco exist at the centers of galactic black hole candidates and agn .",
    "in recent work ( schild , robertson & leiter 2005 ) we have found observational evidence of the physical effects of such intrinsic magnetic dipole fields in the central compact object in the quasar q0957 + 561 .",
    "it is important to note that these physical effects can not be explained in terms of standard black hole models using kerr - schild metric driven grmhd calculations , since these calculations generate unphysical  split magnetic monopole fields \" that can not explain the details of the intrinsic structure in q0957 + 561 that our observations have found .",
    "we reiterate that the kerr - schild metric used by most relativists is not relevant to the work done in this paper , because the collapsing radiating meco solution to the einstein equation is described by the time dependent radiating vaidya metric , and there is no coordinate transformation between them .",
    "therefore we found that we had to turn to alternate meco vaidya metric solutions to the einstein - maxwell equations which feature the intrinsic magnetic dipole fields implied by the observations .",
