    "after 30 years of x - ray observations , the crab nebula remains unique or , more accurately , peculiar when compared with other supernova remnants .",
    "the central crab pulsar accounts for @xmath6 of the 1 - 10 kev x - ray emission .",
    "the bulk of the emission comes from the surrounding pulsar - wind nebula ( pwn or synchrotron nebula ) which is @xmath7 in diameter ( bowyer et al .",
    "1964 , palmieri et al . 1975 ,",
    "harnden & seward 1984 , hester et al . 1995 ) and has rich , time - variable interior structure ( weisskopf et al .",
    "2000 , hester et al .",
    "the pwn is surrounded by a @xmath8 optical nebula comprising an array of he - rich filaments moving outwards with velocities of 1000 - 1500 km s@xmath4 ( trimble , 1968 , lawrence et al , 1995 ) .",
    "the mass contained in these filaments has been estimated as @xmath9 ( trimble and woltjer 1971 , fesen et al 1997 ) the kinetic energy of this material is @xmath10 ergs , less than the @xmath11 ergs typical of other galactic and magellanic - cloud remnants .",
    "snr 0540 - 69.3 , in the lmc , has a similar luminous central pulsar and pwn but , in addition , an outer shell with l@xmath12 ergs s@xmath4 and containing @xmath13 ( seward & harnden 1994 , hwang et al .",
    "this emission is largely from shock - heated material energized as the sn ejecta push through circumstellar gas .",
    "this shell , which is irregular , if placed at the distance of the crab ( 2 kpc ) , would be @xmath14 from the central pulsar .",
    "searches for emission beyond the optical filaments of the crab have not yet found a convincing outer shell . during a lunar occultation in 1972",
    "a rocket flight detected soft x - ray emission coming from outside the pwn area ( toor et al 1976 ) .",
    "this was attributed to thermal emission but later shown to probably be a dust - scattering halo . both einstein and",
    "rosat observations detected a faint x - ray halo extending out to @xmath15 from the pulsar and concluded that @xmath16 of the x - rays are in this halo ( mauche & gorenstein 1989 , predehl & schmitt 1995 ) .",
    "because of the exceptional quality of the chandra mirror , we thought it worthwhile to again search for outer - shell emission .    at other wavelengths ,",
    "the crab outer shell is also elusive .",
    "searches by murdin and clark ( 1981 ) and by murdin ( 1994 ) detected surrounding h@xmath17 emission which was thought to be the stellar wind of the progenitor .",
    "fesen et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , however , showed that this emission was widely distributed and probably not associated with the crab .",
    "sankrit and hester ( 1997 ) give evidence for a shock at the optical boundary of the crab due to the pressure of the pwn pushing into freely - expanding ejecta located outside of the optical nebula .",
    "although the depencence of density on radius is unknown , they estimate that several @xmath18 of ejecta are possible .",
    "sollerman et al ( 2000 ) have detected absorption in high - velocity c iv @xmath19 and have interpreted this as absorption in fast circumstellar material .",
    "parameters depend on falloff of density with radius and the fraction of c in the c iv state . a shell with 4 @xmath18 and ke of @xmath11 ergs is possible with lower limits of 0.6 @xmath18 and @xmath20 ergs using the best - fit model with density falling off as @xmath21 . in section 6",
    ", we will consider this putative envelope further .    in the radio band , frail et al ( 1995 ) specifically searched for an snr shell and found no emission out to a radius of @xmath22 . the upper limit for 333 mhz emission from any shell was 1% of that observed from the shell around sn 1006  about the same age as the crab and with a well - defined shell of @xmath23 radius ( @xmath24 if at 2 kpc ) .",
    "a later h@xmath25 ( 1410 mhz ) radio map shows a 3@xmath26 diameter bubble around the crab ( wallace et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "they estimate the undisturbed ism density as 1.6 - 3.5 @xmath27 .",
    "fesen et al ( 1987 ) summarize optical studies of the crab s environment and review reasons for believing that there should be more material than just the well - studied optical filaments and the pulsar .",
    "current ideas of stellar evolution and collapse require that the zams precursor star have @xmath28 .",
    "fesen et al estimate the amount of material in the optical filaments to be @xmath29 . adding a @xmath30 neutron star leaves @xmath31 expected to be shed in presupernova wind and high - velocity ejected material .",
    "the interaction of ejecta with circumstellar material will produce a shell of shock - heated gas which is readily detectable in x - rays from most other remnants .",
    "the expected crab configuration is in a shell containing @xmath32 @xmath33 from the center of the crab ( chevalier , 1977,1985 ) .",
    "the present paper describes a search for x - rays from this outer shell .",
    "because of the bright central region , scattering from the chandra mirror , and the bright dust halo , the search is difficult .",
    "hester et al . ( 2002 ) observed the crab nebula 8 times from november 2000 to april 2001 .",
    "they used an acis - s subarray to minimize pileup in the detector .",
    "the field of view was @xmath34 , enough to include the brighter parts of the pwn and to study time - variation of this structure .",
    "because of limited telemetry response , the effective exposure of these 25 ks observations was only 4 ks , a factor of 6 dead time . to avoid this problem , we excluded the bright central region from our observations .",
    "our first observation was a 20 ks exposure using the 4 acis - i chips and pointed @xmath35 n of the pulsar .",
    "the x - ray nebula was not in the field of view .",
    "the second observation was a 40 ks exposure using 3 acis - s and 2 acis - i chips with the x - ray nebula centered on the s3 chip , but with the center region of the chip excluded from the telemetry .",
    "thus , with dead time only a few percent , 20 and 40 ks exposures were obtained of the halo and of the faint outer part of the pwn .",
    "table 1 gives detail for these 2 observations and includes one of the shorter subarray observations .",
    "figure 1 shows the sum of these 3 observations in the energy range 0.42.1 kev . to show the inner nebula , one of the 4 ks observations of the bright crab has been normalized and added to fill the hole left by telemetry exclusion .",
    "cosmic - ray background has been subtracted and time variation of chip sensitivity has been included .",
    "the acis charge - transfer streak has been subtracted from chip s3 , on which the crab is imaged , and from the 2 i chips north of and overlapping the field of s3 . in order to show detail at the center ,",
    "some chips are only partially shown in this figure .",
    "since calibration of some chips is more extensive than for others , chip ids are listed .",
    "there is appreciable structure at the outer boundary of the pwn .",
    "the faintest features visible are @xmath36 from the center of the nebula and these have surface brightness a factor of 200 less than that where the pwn is brightest .",
    "the halo data extend from this radius , which is inside the optical nebula , to a radial distance of @xmath0 . in this span",
    ", the halo brightness decreases a factor of 100 .",
    "coverage of the halo is 100% at radial distances from @xmath36 to @xmath1 , is greater than 60% out to @xmath35 , and falls to 25% at @xmath0 .",
    "figure 2 shows measured surface brightness extending from the center of the crab to the outermost chip boundaries .",
    "data from the central , northern , and western chips indicate a halo with intensity independent of azimuth .",
    "the 2 southern chips , s2 , and s1 , show greater surface brightness .",
    "this is , at least partially , a calibration problem . excluding these 2 chips , the halo is symmetric about the point : ra = 05 34 31.3 , dec = 22 01 03 , located @xmath37 northwest of the pulsar and within the bright x - ray torus .",
    "figure 3 shows the chandra - measured surface brightness compared to that measured by rosat ( predehl and schmitt 1995 ) .",
    "the energy range of both observations is @xmath38 0.4 - 2.1 kev but the rosat sensitivity from 1.5 - 2.1 kev is considerably less than that of chandra . to obtain the strength of the chandra dust halo , the chandra mirror scattering ( dashed line )",
    "must be subtracted from the observed brightness ( solid line ) .",
    "note that the chandra measurement , even before this correction , falls below the rosat observation .",
    "the mirror scattering was taken from an observation of her x-1 combined with ground calibration as summarized by gaetz ( 2004 ) .",
    "the strength of the chandra dust halo integrated from @xmath36 to @xmath0 and interpolated from @xmath39 to @xmath36 , is 0.047 that of the crab nebula .",
    "( the interpolation from @xmath39 to @xmath36 accounts for .010 of this . )",
    "the rosat - measured scattered fraction from @xmath39 to @xmath15 is 0.080 ( predehl & schmitt 1995 ) .",
    "an extension of our figure 3 curve to @xmath15 would increase the chandra - measured fraction to @xmath40 .",
    "uncertainties comprise measure of surface brightness , measure of total crab count rate , extrapolation to small radii , background subtraction , and an assumed 20% error in the mirror scattering .",
    "we note that we have used data taken n and e of the crab and we have assumed that this is valid for all azimuths .",
    "we have not included data from the 2 southern acis chips because the discontinuity at the chip boundary indicates a normalization problem .",
    "if we assume that the higher surface brightness indicated by these chips ( s1,s2 ) is real , and that this higher brightness applies to a sector extending @xmath41 in azimuth , the chandra - observed scattered fraction to @xmath15 would increase to 0.051 , which is within our margin of error . since the rosat and chandra detectors have different spectral sensitivities , even though the energy range covered here is about the same as that of rosat , the fraction of counts in the halo is not expected to be the same . using the known spectrum of the crab and the halo spectra given here at the end of section 4 , we expect the relative strength of the dust halo measured with chandra to be 82% of that measured with rosat ( because the rosat detector is relatively more sensitive at low energies ) .",
    "we observe a halo strength @xmath42 that of rosat so conclude that the rosat result is too high .",
    "figure 4 was made to illustrate fluctuations in halo surface brightness .",
    "the 0.2 - 2.1 kev data shown in figure 1 was first smoothed to make map @xmath43 .",
    "then a function @xmath44 , with about the same radial dependence of surface brightness was subtracted .",
    "@xmath45^{1.05}$ ] , where @xmath46 is distance from the scattering center in acis pixels .",
    "the figure shows the quantity @xmath47 and one can see regions n and s of the crab which are @xmath48 brighter than average .",
    "note that since the average decrease of brightness with radial distance has been removed from figure 4 , any extended above - average component also is decreasing with radial distance , contrary to appearance in figure 4 .",
    "we interpret the significant features in figure 4 as possible structure in the dust distribution and/or variations in column density of absorbing gas in the line - of - sight .",
    "the @xmath49 feature @xmath50 sse of the crab center is discussed further in section 4 .",
    "note that any gradual radial variation in brightness implied by figure 4 may be an artifact due to the form assumed for the subtracted function , f(r ) .",
    "apparent azimuthal variation should be real . because we are seeing variations of a few percent ,",
    "chip - to - chip calibration uncertainties show .",
    "a variable contamination layer on the instrument window is also a cause for concern .",
    "this layer , however , is thicker at the edges of the window and , if present , should produce a recognizable effect .",
    "this is not seen .",
    "the halo spectrum contains no strong sharp features which might indicate thermal emission from a shock .",
    "reasonable fits are obtained using the sum of power law and thermal bremsstrahlung ( used as an arbitrary continuum ) components .",
    "the signal is comprised of dust - scattered halo , mirror scattering , and background , which is negligible except for high energies at large angles .",
    "to be detectable , x - rays from any shock - heated material must be visible over the dust - scattered halo . since diffuse uniform emission is more difficult to detect than bright knots , we consider a hypothetical diffuse shell which represents the most massive allowed shell possible .",
    "the limiting surface brightness is taken as 0.1 of the observed dust halo .",
    "upper limits depend on radius , @xmath51 , of the assumed shell and were calculated assuming a spherical shell of thickness @xmath52 centered on the pulsar and filled with material of uniform density , @xmath53 @xmath27 . using the dashed curve of figure 5 ( 0.1 of the observed halo ) as the surface brightness of the unseen shell , limits on several quantities are calculated and shown in figure 6 .",
    "the upper limit to @xmath53 is 4 just inside the optical nebula and drops to 0.15 at @xmath54 .",
    "if the surrounding ism is uniform , since @xmath53 is swept - up material , the ism density , @xmath55 would be 0.4 of these values .",
    "the limit on the x - ray luminosity , @xmath56 , of any shell is @xmath57 ergs s@xmath4 and almost independent of @xmath51 .",
    "uncertainty of the gas temperature leads to an uncertainty of @xmath58 in @xmath53 and @xmath59 in @xmath56 .",
    "the calculation of @xmath53 and @xmath56 is straightforward .",
    "a model is necessary to derive paremeters of the explosion .",
    "it is customary to estimate the energy of the shock , @xmath60 , using a simple blast - wave model ( cox , 1972 ) . for a uniform ism , @xmath61 , where the units of @xmath60 are @xmath11 ergs",
    ", @xmath51 is in parsecs and the age , @xmath62 is in @xmath63 years or , in this case , @xmath64 .",
    "upper limits for @xmath60 are shown in figure 6 .",
    "the crosses in figure 5 show measured surface brightness of selected `` bright spots '' .",
    "these illustrate that the limit of bright knot detectability is about 0.1 the brightness of the dust halo .",
    "all are consistent with statistical fluctuations except for the point at @xmath65 which is a small cloud of emission within the n boundary of the optical nebula . at @xmath66",
    "the bright lumps represents a knot size of @xmath67 pc and a lump luminosity of @xmath68 ergs . assuming we would notice 10 such lumps in a @xmath69 arc",
    ", this would imply 300 lumps in the shell , a total @xmath70 ergs and total mass of @xmath71 m@xmath72 . as expected , these limits are far below the limits calculated for a diffuse uniform shell .    the circles in figure 5 show surface brightness of shells observed by chandra in other remnants ( seward et al 2004 ) .",
    "most remnants have an irregular outer shell which defines the boundary and brighter patches at a lesser radius . in this figure",
    ", we have shown brightness and radial position for both the brightest part of the shell and the emission observed over most of the outer boundary .",
    "radii have been corrected to show the size at 2 kpc distance .",
    "although surface brightness does not depend on distance , corrections have been made for differing absorption measured in the ism .",
    "the remnants kes 75 and snr 0540 - 69.3 have bright central pwn very similar to that of the crab and , in this respect , are the most crab - like remnants known .",
    "we searched , without success , for thermal emission inside the optical nebula .",
    "there are many faint features at the edge of the pwn .",
    "all have soft power - law spectra and are best interpreted as part of the pwn .",
    "the density of any unseen thermal x - ray - emitting diffuse material must be @xmath73 and the mass @xmath74 .",
    "the limits on lumpy material are appreciably less .",
    "although no emission from an outer shell has been recognized , there is substantial extended emission observed due to scattering from dust in the interstellar medium ( ism ) and mirror scattering in the chandra hrma .",
    "as we will show , below @xmath38 2.5 kev scattering by dust grains dominates the extended emission ; above @xmath38 3 kev mirror scattering becomes the primary contribution .",
    "x - ray scattering by ism grains , first described by overbeck ( 1965 ) , has been observed by instruments on einstein ( mauche & gorenstein , 1986 ) , rosat ( predehl & schmitt , 1995 ) , chandra ( clark , 2004 , smith , edgar , & shafer , 2002 ) , and xmm ( vaughan et al .",
    "theoretical studies have been done by mathis & lee ( 1991 ) , predehl & klose ( 1996 ) , and smith & dwek ( 1998 ) .",
    "the total scattering cross section in the rayleigh - gans ( rg ) approximation illustrates the dependence on x - ray energy and grain characteristics .",
    "it is applicable when @xmath75kev and is @xmath76 where @xmath77  is the grain radius , @xmath78  is the mean atomic charge , @xmath43the mean atomic weight ( in amu ) , @xmath79  the mass density , and @xmath80the x - ray energy in kev ( mathis & lee 1991 ) .",
    "[ eq : intrg ]  implies that the overall scattering halo will tend to be brighter at lower energies , from the @xmath81  term [ note error in mathis & lee ( 1991 ) showing this as @xmath82 .",
    "figure  [ fig : totscatfrac]plots the total scattering fraction between @xmath83 , the range observed here , assuming a column density of n@xmath84@xmath85 .",
    "three different dust models , mathis , rumpl , & nordsieck ( 1977 ) ( mrn ) , weingartner & draine ( 2001 ) ( wd01 ; using @xmath86  and @xmath87 ) , and zubko , dwek & arendt ( 2004 ) ( zda04 ; using the bare - gr - b parameters ) are shown using both the exact mie solution for scattering from a sphere and the approximate rg solution . in all cases",
    "the rg approximation clearly begins to break down below 1.5 kev , although the scattering is generally larger at lower energies .",
    "the zda04 model , which has relatively fewer large grains than the mrn and wd1 models , gives the best fits of the three to our data ( see figure 8) .",
    "the analysis to be described used only data from the 4 i chips of the 14 april 2002 observation ( obsid 2798 ) . there was a charge - transfer streak in chip i0 due to part of the crab pwn at the edge of the chip",
    "the charge transfer streak was therefore subtracted from the 2 chips closest to the crab . for each energy interval ,",
    "the counts were projected along the transfer axis and summed .",
    "0.013 of this sum was then subtracted from each element of the image .    at almost any energy , extracting an x - ray scattering halo from the observations first requires that the chandra psf be subtracted . as described by smith et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , ray - trace models of the chandra psf ( such as chart ) significantly underestimate the scattering at angles beyond @xmath88 .",
    "therefore we followed smith et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and used an on - axis her x-1 observation ( obsid 3662 ) as our psf calibrator .",
    "this has the obvious limitation that this observation was done on - axis , while our crab observation was done with the crab @xmath89  off - axis .",
    "we believe that this is reasonable because at 4 kev , where dust scattering is minimal , the observed crab profile matches the her x-1 profile .",
    "we note , however , that while this match is suggestive it does not guarantee that there are no differences in the psf at lower energies .    unlike most halo studies , the crab nebula is not a point source but rather an extended nebula @xmath90  in radius .",
    "we calculated the radial profile assuming it was centered at 05:34:31.3 , 22:01:03 ( j2000 ) , which is both roughly central and near the peak of the nebular emission .",
    "this is not the location of the crab pulsar , however , which itself emits only 5% of the x - ray emission .",
    "the effect of source extent is relatively minor except at scattering angles comparable to the size of the source . with the assumption that the source is circular with uniform surface brightness , the effect can easily be calculated by integrating the point - source scattering intensity over the surface : @xmath91 where @xmath92  is the source radius on the sky and",
    "@xmath93  is the scattered halo at angle @xmath94 .",
    "this equation holds for @xmath95 ; in most cases , when @xmath96  the source brightness itself will swamp the scattered halo .",
    "we extracted the radial profile of the crab nebula in energy slices between 0.5 - 4 kev . between 0.5 - 1.0 kev , we used an energy width of 0.1 kev ( approximately equivalent to the energy resolution of the acis ccds ) , and between 1.0 - 4.0 kev we used a width of 0.2 kev .",
    "we modeled the crab as a uniform circle of radius @xmath97 , and fit it using various dust models using eq .",
    "[ eq : finitesize ]  and either the mie solution ( for energies below 1.5 kev ) or the rg approximation ( above 1.5 kev ) . sample results at 1 and 2 kev , assuming the dust has an mrn - type size distribution and is smoothly distributed between the crab and the sun are shown in figure  [ fig : samplehalo ] .",
    "as figure  [ fig : samplehalo ]  shows , by 2 kev the observed radial profile is strongly influenced by the power - law shape of the psf ; at 1 kev , the shape of the observed profile shows dust scattering is dominant . the 1 kev x - ray surface brightness is poorly fit by the mrn model .",
    "changing the assumed dust model to a wd01 or zda04 model does not significantly improve the fits .",
    "if the dust is assumed to be smoothly distributed along the line of sight , the choice of a dust grain model leaves only the total dust column density as a free parameter ; this can easily be converted to a gas column density using the dust model parameters . in figure 9",
    "we show the best - fit hydrogen column density for the three different dust grain models as a function of energy .",
    "since the energy dependence of the halo emission has already been taken into account in the model fits , any variation with energy indicates the model does not completely describe the data .",
    "figure 9 shows that the best - fit column density from the halo data is significantly lower than the best - fit column density derived from fitting the x - ray spectrum , @xmath98  atoms @xmath85 .",
    "this result disagrees with that of predehl & schmitt ( 1995 ) but is consistent with our observation of less halo emission than they saw with rosat .    regarding the variations seen in figure 9 , an examination of the individual halo fits showed that this simple `` smoothly distributed dust '' model fit best at energies between 1.5 - 2.5 kev .",
    "at higher energies , we believe that errors in the mirror scattering model dominate the fits . at lower energies",
    ", it seems likely that the one - component model is too simple , as described below .",
    "we also note that the error bars in figure 9 are purely statistical , and do not include the known but difficult - to - estimate systematic errors such as the energy dependence of the chandra mirror point - spread function .",
    "to improve the fits , we experimented with more complex models , with two halo components : a `` smooth '' component plus a single cloud of dust between the sun and the crab . in this case , we find reasonable fits , although the column density varies a bit with energy .",
    "we find that the planar dust to be very near , with a column density of @xmath99@xmath85 , while the smooth dust has a column density of @xmath100@xmath85  for mrn - type dust .",
    "if instead we use a zda04 dust model ( specifically their bare - gr - b model ) , as shown in figures 10 and 11 , we get significantly improved fits over a mrn - type distribution .",
    "again , this column density is lower than normally used for the crab , and is affected by the dust size distribution chosen .",
    "interestingly , the local bubble ( lb ) radius is , on average , @xmath101pc distant ( cox & reynolds , 1987 ) . assuming an `` average '' is density of 1 @xmath27  existed before the lb was swept out implies the edge would have a column density @xmath102@xmath85 .",
    "observations of the lb edge by lallement et al .",
    "( 2003 ) show that the edge in the direction of the crab is at @xmath103pc , with a column density greater than @xmath104@xmath85 .",
    "although plausible , we can not conclude that this excess at large angles is due to the lb edge .",
    "it could also be caused by additional small dust particles that are not in the model , or even due to a missing mirror scattering term .",
    "in addition , at these large angles the data is from the outer two ccds .",
    "therefore there is no blurring correction from the bright edge of the nebula , although calibration differences between the various chips could contribute to the excess as well .    in sum ,",
    "our primary results concerning dust are :    * the zda04 model seems to best fit the radial dependence of surface brightness .",
    "* there appears to be less dust along the line of sight to the crab than would be predicted from the best - fit n@xmath105 value for the crab spectrum , although this may depend on the dust model used .",
    "* there is evidence for a nearby plane or cloud of dust with a moderate column density .",
    "figure 12 shows the spectrum of the halo @xmath106 sse of the scattering center .",
    "the mirror scattering is approximated by a broken power law with indices 1.1 and 2.8 and a break at 4.6 kev .",
    "all events with energies above 2.5 kev are assumed to be from the mirror .",
    "the dust contribution below 2.5 kev was approximated and characterized by a continuum .",
    "of the several simple models readily available , a bremsstrahlung spectrum gave the best fit with about the right value for @xmath107 .",
    "no emission mechanism is implied .",
    "the residuals to halo spectra typically show a multiple peaked structure between 0.8 and 2 kev .",
    "this structure , which varies from place to place and is about 5% of the signal at most locations , is not understood .",
    "adding models with line emission does not produce reasonable fits .",
    "some of the structure may be an artifact of the detector .",
    "for example , some spectra contain a line feature at 1.5 kev which probably comes from an al coating on the detector window . in any case , the `` temperature '' of the bremsstrahlung continuum characterizes the dust - scattered spectrum .",
    "some results at varying distances are : @xmath108 , 0.48 kev ; @xmath106 , 0.37 kev ; @xmath109 , 0.32 kev ; @xmath23 , 0.23 kev . as expected ,",
    "the scattered spectrum is softer as scattering angle increases .",
    "the chandra mirror is well suited for the detection of point sources embedded in diffuse emission .",
    "there are 19 serendipitous sources visible to the eye in the field shown in figure 1 .",
    "because of smoothing , compression , and color map , only one is visible ( barely ) at the western edge of figure 1 but shows clearly in figure 4 .",
    "the closest source to the crab nebula is at ra = 05 34 45.91 , dec = 22 00 11.6 ( 2000 ) .",
    "this is @xmath110 from the pulsar and on the eastern boundary of the optical nebula .",
    "strengths range from 1 to 12 counts ks@xmath4 and none fall clearly within the projection of the optical nebula .",
    "there is no indication in our observation of x - ray emission from an outer shell .",
    "the shell predicted assuming the expected type ii sn progenitor has @xmath111 and is moving at @xmath112 km s@xmath4 .",
    "if the `` usual '' blast wave analysis of section 3 is done , we conclude that this shell does not exist . at a radius of @xmath113 a uniform shell containing @xmath114 and indicating an explosion energy of @xmath115 ergs is possible but highly unlikely .",
    "all other remnants which have prominent outer shells are irregular . if the crab outer shell were similarly clumpy , limits on emission , would be considerably lower than the limits used here .",
    "our upper limits for emission are already a factor of 100 - 1000 below that observed from shells around snr 0540 - 69.3 and kes 75 which have small bright pwne similar to the crab .",
    "even the weak plerionic remnant g21.5 - 0.9 , with central pulsar and surrounding pwn ( @xmath116 less luminous than the crab ) has 2 shell - like features which , as shown in figure 5 , are still @xmath117 10 times brighter than our limit .    at radii @xmath118 , a larger mass and energy are possible and",
    "our coverage becomes sparse .",
    "rosat and einstein observed out to @xmath15 with 100% coverage and found no shell - like emission : so we know there is no bright shell just outside the chandra field of view .",
    "a faint shell is possible .",
    "the freely - expanding ejecta proposed by sankrit and hester ( 1997 ) and by sollerman et al ( 2000 ) consists of photoionized @xmath119 k material and is too cool to be detected by chandra .",
    "shock - heated material , however , will be present where this fast moving ejecta plows into the pre - supernova environment",
    ". this would be detectable by chandra if the density of the shocked material were high enough .",
    "the sollerman et al shell density varies as @xmath21 ; our upper limit varies as @xmath120 . assuming a shock structure similar to that given by chevalier ( 1982 , figure 2 ) ,",
    "the reverse shock in the ejecta should have a density 4 @xmath121 that in the unshocked material .",
    "for the sollerman et al minimum - mass model , this is above our limit at @xmath122 .",
    "the shock in the presupernova ism , assuming a similar density jump , would be below our limit at all @xmath123 if @xmath124 .    in conclusion , with reasonable assumptions about non - uniform distribution and density",
    ", we find no evidence for the shell expected from an @xmath125 sn in the region @xmath126 , where the velocity of freely - expanding material ranges from @xmath127 to @xmath128 km s@xmath4 .",
    "we can not exclude models postulating several @xmath18 of ejecta with temperature @xmath129 k if the circumstellar density is very low ( @xmath130 ) and rather uniform .",
    "we note that quantitave comparison with these models is very uncertain    although our x - ray upper limit is an order of magnitude lower than past work , we can not firmly exclude a @xmath11 erg explosion of a @xmath131 progenitor .",
    "certainly the range of possible circumstances is narrowing .",
    "any hidden mass is almost invisible .",
    "we note that 3c 58 ( slane et al 2004 ) and g054.1 - 0.3 ( lu et al 2002 ) have central pulsars and pwn but have weak ( or absent ) x - ray emitting shells .",
    "although both only @xmath132 as luminous as the crab , these , together with the crab , may form a class of gravitational - collapse sne with unusual progenitors .",
    "this work was supported by chandra grants go2 - 3087x and go4 - 5059x .",
    "we thank rob fesen for a critical reading of the manuscript , for several important references , and for showing enthusiasm over a non - detection observation .",
