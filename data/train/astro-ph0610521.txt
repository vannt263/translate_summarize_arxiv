    "+ finally , there are strong physical arguments indicating that viable dark matter candidate annihilation can produce copious amounts of secondary electrons with a spatial distribution which , in massive clusters like coma , is strictly related to that of the original dm ( see colafrancesco et al . 2006a ) .",
    "it is interesting to note , in this context , that the spectral distribution of dm - produced secondary electrons carries information on the mass and the physical composition of the original dm particles .",

    "2003 , colafrancesco 2004a ) .",
    "the problem of detecting the non - thermal sze in radio - halo clusters is likely to be severe because of the associated synchrotron radio emission , which could contaminate at low radio frequencies the small negative signal produced by the sze . at higher frequencies",
    "there is in principle more chance to detect the non - thermal sze , but even here there are likely to be difficulties in separating the sze from the flat - spectrum component of the synchrotron emission ( see birkinshaw 1999 ) . in addition , colafrancesco ( 2004a ) noticed that dust obscuration does not allow any detection of the sz signal from clusters at frequencies @xmath42 ghz .",
    "+ from the theoretical point of view , preliminary calculations ( birkinshaw 1999 , ensslin & kaiser 2000 ) of the non - thermal sze have been carried out in the diffusion approximation ( @xmath43 ) , in the limit of single scattering and for a single non - thermal population of electrons .",
    "matters are significantly more complicated if the full relativistic formalism is used .",
    "however , this is necessary , since many galaxy clusters show extended radio halos and the electrons which produce the diffuse synchrotron radio emission are certainly highly relativistic so that the use of the kompaneets approximation is invalid .",
    "moreover , the co - spatial presence of thermal and non - thermal electrons renders the single scattering approximation and the single population approach unreasonable , so that the treatment of multiple scattering among different electronic populations coexisting in the same cluster atmosphere is necessary to describe correctly the overall sze . in this context , a complete and general derivation of the sze produced by a general distribution of non - thermal electrons in the full - relativistic desciption , with multiple scatterings and also with different families of electrons co - spatially distributed has been provided by colafrancesco et al .",

    "this confirms that the distorted spectrum obtained from the kompaneets equation is the non - relativistic limit of the exact spectrum .",
    "it is worth to notice that while in the non - relativistic case it is possible to separate the spectral dependence of the effect [ which is contained in the function @xmath5 ] from the dependence on the cluster parameters [ which are contained in compton parameter @xmath45 ] , this is no longer valid in the relativistic case in which the function @xmath72 depends itself also on the cluster parameters .",

    "the acceleration history of cosmic rays*. one of the most favourite scenarios is that high - energy particles ( cosmic rays ) are energized by stochastic acceleration due to e.g. , cluster turbulence , merging shocks or other injection / acceleration mechanisms acting coherently on the large ( @xmath87 mpc ) scale of the cluster atmospheres .",

    "hence , the sze from a cluster containing cavities ( like the case of ms0735.6 + 7421 ) shows up uncontaminated at frequencies @xmath98 ghz : it is less extended than the overall cluster sze because it is only emerging from the cavity regions and it is also well separable because the cavities are well defined in both x - rays and sz images .",
    "we also emphasize , in addition , that the observation of the zero of the non - thermal sze in the cavities ( which is found at high frequencies , depending on the value of @xmath81 or equivalently on the value of the pressure in the cavity ) provides a definite way to determine uniquely the total pressure and hence the nature of the electron population within the cavity , an evidence which adds crucial , complementary information to the x - ray and radio analysis .",

    "the sz@xmath106 signal does not strongly depend on the assumed dm density profile at intermediate angular distances from the cluster center and on the dm clumpiness since @xmath107 is the integral of the total dm - produced secondary electron pressure , @xmath108 , along the line of sight .",
    "the presence of a substantial sz@xmath106 effect is likely to dominate the overall sz signal at frequencies @xmath109 providing a negative total sze ( see fig.[fig.sz_dm ] ) .",
    "it is , however , necessary to stress that in such frequency range there are other possible contributions to the sze , like the kinematic effect and the non - thermal sze which could provide additional biases ( see , e.g. , colafrancesco et al .",
    "nonetheless , the peculiar spectral shape of the @xmath110 effect is quite different from that of the kinematic sze and of the thermal sze and this allows to disentangle it from the overall sz signal .",
    "an appropriate multifrequency analysis of the overall sze based on observations performed on a wide spectral range ( from the radio to the sub - mm region ) is required , in principle , to separate the various sz contributions and to provide an estimate of the dm induced sze .",
    "in fact , simultaneous sz observations at @xmath111 ghz ( where the sz@xmath106 deepens the minimum with respect to the dominant thermal sze ) , at @xmath98 ghz ( where the sz@xmath106 dominates the overall sze and produces a negative signal instead of the expected @xmath112 null signal ) and at @xmath113 ghz ( where the still negative sz@xmath106 decreases the overall sze with respect to the dominant thermal sze ) coupled with x - ray observations which determine the gas distribution within the cluster ( and hence the associated dominant thermal sze ) and lensing data ( which determine the shape of the dm - dominated potential wells ) can separate the sz@xmath106 from the overall sz signal , and consequently , set constraints on the neutralino mass . observations of the radio - halo emission in the cluster can provide an estimate of the cosmic - ray electron population and consequently an estimate of the associated non - thermal sze ( which is usually quite small and with a different spectral shape at high frequencies , see e.g. , colafrancesco et al .",
    "a particularly good case in which the sz@xmath114 could be revealed is that of the cluster 1e0657 - 556 ( see fig.[fig.clusters ] ) where the sz@xmath114 signal is peaked on the dm clumps , and is well separated ( by several arcmin ) from the thermal sze concentrated on the x - ray emitting ic gas location and from the non - thermal sze associated with the shock .",
    "we stress here that the sz@xmath114 signal is the only one remaining at frequencies @xmath115 at the dm clump locations ( see colafrancesco et al .",
    "2006c ) . because the amplitude of the sz@xmath106 effect increases with decreasing values of @xmath101 , the high - sensitivity sz experiments have , hence , the possibility to set reliable constraints to the nature , amount and spatial distribution of dm in galaxy clusters .",
    "while the sz@xmath106 effect in galaxy clusters could be contaminated by other possible sources of sze ( thermal from both hot and warm gas , non - thermal from cosmic rays , relativistic electrons injected by radio - galaxies and agns , kinematic due to the cluster peculiar motion ) , the comptonization of the cmb photons by secondary electrons produced by dm annihilation in a `` pure '' dm halo ( i.e. , a dark galaxy ) produce a sz@xmath106 which is un - contaminated and therefore carries secure information on the dm nature .",
    "colafrancesco ( 2004b , 2005b ) proposed that this is the case to be expected in a dwarf galaxy like draco where no material other than dm and stars are present . in this respect ,",
    "the possible detection of the sz@xmath106 from nearby dwarf galaxies could either provide extremely clear and strong constraints on the dm nature or even detect their indirect signals .",
    "detailed analysis on the sze expected from draco ( culverhouse , evans & colafrancesco 2006 , colafrancesco , profumo & ullio 2006b ) revealed that the sz@xmath106 signal is however quite tiny , and typically requires long duration observations with the future sensitive sz experiments like alma .",
    "however , future sz experiment with sub-@xmath90k sensitivity ( and even moderate angular resolution ) could be able to detect direct signals from dm annihilation in the most favourable supersymmetric scenarios .",
    "there are also non - standard aspects of the widely - used thermal sze that need to be carefully and specifically addressed . in particular , the presence of an intra - cluster magnetic field can produce relevant changes to the thermal sze in galaxy clusters ( see , e.g. , colafrancesco & giordano 2006a for details ) . we know",
    ", in fact , that magnetic fields exist in clusters of galaxies for several reasons : first , in many galaxy clusters we observe the synchrotron radio - halo emission produced by relativistic electrons spiraling along magnetic field lines ; second , the faraday rotation of linearly polarized radio emission traversing the icm proves directly and independently the existence of intracluster magnetic fields ( see , e.g. , carilli & taylor 2002 , govoni & feretti 2004 for reviews ) .",
    "other estimates of the magnetic field strength on the cluster wide scale come from the combination of synchrotron radio and inverse compton detections in the hard x - rays ( e.g. , colafrancesco , marchegiani & perola 2005 ) , from the study of cold fronts and from numerical simulations ( see , e.g. , govoni & feretti 2004 ) .",
    "this evidence provides indication on the wide - scale b - field which is at the level of a few tens up to several @xmath90 g ( and in some cases up to @xmath116 @xmath90 g , as in coma ) with the larger values being attained by the most massive systems .",
    "the presence of a wide - scale magnetic field implies modification on the thermal and density structure of the ic gas by acting on both the magnetic virial theorem ( mvt , from which the overall ic gas temperature is derived , see colafrancesco & giordano 2006b ) 2u + u_b + w = 0 , [ eq.mvt ] ( here @xmath117 is the kinetic energy , @xmath118 is the potential energy and @xmath119 is the magnetic energy of the system ) , and the hydrostatic equilibrium condition ( he , from which the radial profile of the ic gas density is derived , see colafrancesco & giordano 2006c ) + = -_g , [ eq.he ] where @xmath120 is the density of the thermal ic gas and @xmath121 is its pressure , with both quantities depending in general on the magnetic field @xmath122 . as a consequence , the cluster thermal sze ( see eqs",
    ". 1 - 4 and 7 - 11 ) is certainly influenced by the presence of an intracluster magnetic field , as shown in fig.[fig.sz_b ] .",
    "for idealized isothermal clusters , the magnetic sze is reduced w.r.t .",
    "the unmagnetized case by two separate effects : i ) the decrease in the cluster temperature as derived by the mvt ( see eq.[eq.mvt ] ) for increasing values of @xmath122 ; and ii ) the decrease of the central ic gas density profile according to the he condition ( see eq.[eq.he ] ) for increasing values of @xmath122 .",
    "the variations of the thermal sze for magnetized clusters is larger for lower - mass systems because in these structures the pressure provided by the magnetic field is of larger relative importance w.r.t . to the thermal pressure of the ic gas settling in the potential wells provided by dark matter .",
    "the increasing observational evidence , the refinements of numerical simulations and the theoretical expectations for the presence of magnetic fields in galaxy clusters render a revision of the standard description of the thermal sze necessary to describe both single sz observations and sz scaling - law analyses in a self - consistent astrophysical and cosmological framework ( see discussion in colafrancesco & giordano , 2006a ) .",
    "the most recent achievements in multi - frequency ( radio thru x - rays ) precision observations of galaxies and galaxy clusters provided a wealth of detailed and , in some cases , unexpected physical information on the structure , physical state and composition of the atmospheres of these cosmic structures .",
    "radio - halo non - thermal emission , hard  x - ray quasi - thermal excess emission , cluster cavities and radio bubbles , absence of strong radiative cooling in cool - cores , agn s feedback , dark matter distribution and dynamics , appear to be relevant ingredients for a detailed description of cluster structure and evolution : these processes put the standard description of the cluster atmosphere ( as a single , thermal ic gas ) to the ropes .",
    "therefore , the theoretical modelling of galaxy cluster atmospheres evolved in the last decade up to a level of high - detail , complex physical description that requires to take consistently into account several electronic components ( of thermal , non - thermal and relativistic nature ) , the effects of magnetic field , the feedback ( heating , particle injection , magnetic field compression , etc . ) produced by agns , radio - galaxies and blazars , the evolution and the interaction of relativistic plasma bubbles , the complex interplay of cooling and ( non - thermal ) heating processes in cool cores , the effects of a possible dark matter annihilation , the non - trivial physical conditions of the ic gas at cluster boundaries and its transition into the cosmic - web igm distribution on larger scales .",
    "+ as a consequence , the standard lore of the sze is no longer viable in cosmic structures on large scales , like galaxy clusters .",
    "the simple sz physics is no longer representative of the actual observational status ; in this sense , it can not provide neither reliable cluster physics nor an adequate cosmological use .",
    "+ it is therefore inevitable to go beyond the standard lore of the sze .",
    "this provides , nonetheless , a way to use sze as a single technique to efficiently study the leptonic structure of clusters / galaxy atmospheres and thus obtain information on the density , entropy , pressure and energetics of the electrons , the presence and the spectra of different electron populations , their ( possible ) equilibrium conditions .",
    "+ the sz signals expected from the non - thermal plasma , from dm annihilation and from cluster cavities and radio bubbles in addition to the thermal sze and its modifications due to the inclusion of the intra - cluster magnetic field physics are usually in the range from a few @xmath90k to a few tens of @xmath90k .",
    "this is the reason why they have not yet clearly discovered in the past and ongoing sz experiments .",
    "these additional sz components are however present in the overall sz signal observable from many galaxy clusters , and therefore they enrich the available physical information contained in the sze data .",
    "such signals could be disentangled from the thermal sze by the future experiments with @xmath123 sensitivity and sub - arcmin resolution .",
    "nonetheless , they constitute a bias of complex spatial and spectral nature for those experiments with @xmath124 sensitivity ( like wmap and planck ) . in each case , their theoretical study and simulation analysis is mandatory for any astrophysical and cosmological use to be reliably carried on .",
    "+ such a program requires a definite technological effort which is directed towards high sensitivity ( sub or @xmath40k level ) and high spatial resolution ( @xmath87 arcsec  arcmin level ) together with a wide - band continuum spectral coverage obtainable from space experiments ( see masi et al . 2006 ) .",
    "this goal is definitely at the frontier of the present technology and is therefore a challenge for the future sze experiments but it will be , nonetheless , able to open the door to the exploration of fundamental ( astro - particle ) issues like the nature of dark matter , the origin and the distribution of cosmic rays and magnetic fields in large - scale structures and other relevant questions which are on the discussion table of modern astrophysics and cosmology .",
