    "because of the masses of heavy quarks relative to the qcd energy scale @xmath0 , heavy - heavy bound states are systems which can be described to some accuracy with first quantization techniques @xcite",
    ". at zero temperature , lattice calculations of a heavy - heavy system give a potential term which can describe quarkonium spectroscopy .",
    "the potential has a non - trivial temperature dependence .",
    "for this reason , it has been the hope of both theorists and experimentalists for over twenty years that changes in the yields of quarkonium in heavy - ion collisions would be a signal for changes in the temperature and phase of the medium @xcite .",
    "since then , analysis of heavy - ion experiments have shown that some suppression of yields at the rhic is anomalous @xcite . however , there is little agreement among theorists over the cause of this suppression .",
    "it is clear that the dynamics of quarkonium above the deconfinement phase transition should be considered carefully .",
    "one step in this direction was made by shuryak and one of us , who modeled charmonium in heavy - ion collisions as undergoing brownian motion , with the heavy quark diffusion coefficient @xmath1 taken to be quite small , as expected from phenomenology of single heavy quarks @xcite and by gauge - gravity duality @xcite .",
    "this work @xcite demonstrated that the survival of states in plasma can not be determined just by examining whether or not the temperature - dependent potentials allow bound states ; instead , the dynamics of charm and charmonium are determined by multiple interactions with the medium , and the time scales of the collision are very important .",
    "another important step in understanding the dynamics of charmonium is provided by newer lattice calculations @xcite . in these calculations ,",
    "the euclidean correlators for local operators related to quarkonium spectroscopy are calculated , namely , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is a local composite operator related to a given mesonic channel .",
    "taking the results of these lattice simulations , mocsy and petreczky compared these correlators , at various temperatures and in different channels , with the results of two different potential models @xcite . in this work",
    ", there is a low - frequency contribution to the spectral densities used to determine the euclidean correlator , which is due to the diffusion of heavy quarks @xcite , however , for @xmath4 , the diffusion of heavy quarks is assumed not to have any effect on the dynamics of quarkonium .    in this paper",
    ", we will outline how the imaginary - time propagator with periodicity @xmath5 can be determined for quarkonium systems interacting with a heat bath . in section [ tpif ] , we review the reduced density matrix , apply the model of caldeira and leggett for quantum brownian motion to imaginary time , and then describe briefly path - integral monte carlo techniques for calculating this reduced density matrix . in section [ qaao ] ,",
    "we show how the imaginary - time propagator for charmonium may be calculated to high accuracy with these techniques , for any potential or drag coefficient , and we show the results for @xmath6 for the vector channel at temperatures just above the deconfinement transition .    not many before have considered the effect of the medium on heavy quark and quarkonium euclidean correlators calculated on the lattice .",

    "we would like to use numerical simulation to obtain reliable estimates of reduced density matrices and euclidean correlators .",
    "the most natural numerical approach for the formalism we adopted is path - integral monte carlo ( pimc ) .",

    "paths are either sampled according to a metropolis algorithm determined by the action of interest , or sampled from some convenient distribution which samples the entire space of paths with some weight . for our work with a single degree of freedom , we found that sampling a convenient distribution ( in our case , the distribution of paths determined by @xmath41)$ ] ) to be sufficient , which is easily sampled for any discretization of the path with a bisection method .",

    "the two - point euclidean correlator for a composite mesonic operator is given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 determine the mesonic channel to be scalar , pseudo - scalar , vector , or pseudo - vector , respectively .",
    "for now , consider only the vector channel ( the following arguments must be modified for the scalar and pseudo - vector channels ) . in order to switch to a first - quantization approach for the energy range where a potential model would be appropriate",
    ", think of this correlator as being the sum of the expectation values of an operator over all of the states in the fock space of @xmath44-particle mesonic systems , with each expectation value entering the sum weighted by the state s boltzmann factor .",
    "one term in this sum , of course , is the  vacuum \" expectation value @xmath45 where the subscript represents that the trace is still taken over all of the light degrees of freedom in qcd .",
    "the right - hand side of equation [ vev ] represents an important step : by decomposing the mesonic operators into products of creation and annihilation operators , the vacuum expectation value can be related to the overlap of two one - particle states .",
    "also , note here that since expectation values of the higher states enter into the thermal average multiplied by factors which are roughly powers of @xmath46 , the vacuum expectation value dominates the thermal average in the limit @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , we have identified the leading contribution to the correlator in the vector channel .",
    "the trace over the light degrees of freedom is of course the central problem of qcd , and no analytic result exists .",
    "however , in the infinite mass limit , this has been computed on the lattice as the expectation value of two polyakov loops @xcite .",

    "this spectral function should be used to calculate @xmath55 . however , let us note here that this work can be put to greater use in examining quarkonium in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "let us argue one last time for treating quarkonium above deconfinement as an open quantum system : typically in particle physics , the rate for the scattering of an @xmath44-particle state into another is determined from the square of the matrix element whose indices are the initial and final states , where these states are in the momentum basis .",
    "this makes perfect sense in high - energy experiments , where the incoming and outgoing states are basically each 2-particle momentum eigenstates and the matrix element can be expanded in terms of a small coupling .",
    "such an approach , however , seems entirely inappropriate for quarkonium formed in a heavy - ion collision , whose constituent quarks are localized in position relative to the surrounding medium and are strongly coupled both to the medium and each other . non - perturbative techniques and experiment both suggest that quarkonium rapidly thermalizes and interacts strongly with the medium .",
    "the most reasonable approach for explaining the observables is to describe quarkonium with a reduced density matrix , whose evolution is determined by a potential @xmath65 a drag coefficient which are both determined non - perturbatively .",
