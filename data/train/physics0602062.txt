    "direct and obvious method of light driven structuring is the using of a special light field configuration .",
    "generation of the light intensity grating and corresponding grating of excitations are widely discussed .",
    "more interesting and physically rich is structuring due to light driven self - organization .",
    "this ordering belongs to the class of self - organization phenomena in open dissipative systems and it is presented here .",
    "the typical examples of this class are benard convection @xcite , belousov - zhabotinsky reactions @xcite and turing instability @xcite .",
    "all self - organization phenomena are driven by some external flow through the system : heat in benard convection , chemical reagents in belousov - zhabotinsky reactions , etc .",
    "optical analogue of turing instability was presented in @xcite . in the latter case light amplitude",
    "has been modulated in time and space , which was crucial for the organization to occur .",
    "our investigations(see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) have shown that steady light flow through a system can provide ordering either .",
    "this light is a driving force which bunches the electrons in the case in hand .",
    "an electron in disordered media ( we shall call them `` glasses '' ) moves in random potential forming its energy spectrum .",
    "it consists of the extended electron and hole bands separated by the `` gap '' filled by the local states .",
    "we shall discuss here the case when photon energy is less than the gap in glass and light generates transitions between local states only .",
    "transitions between different traps are of a spacial interest .",
    "they are responsible for the light induced current and the structuring of the matter discussed . the electron transfer from an initial trap @xmath1 to the final trap @xmath2",
    "may be treated as generation of electron and hole at sites @xmath2 and @xmath1 respectively .",
    "strong coulomb electron - hole interaction is changed considerably with the shift of the distance between traps @xmath2 and @xmath1 therefore strong electron - phonon coupling takes place .",
    "light absorption in the case of strong electron - phonon interaction is well studied .",
    "the rate @xmath3 of the electron transition between sites @xmath1 and @xmath2 is given by the formula @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is photon flux , @xmath6 is photon energy , @xmath7 is the energy of the electron excitation ( difference between electron energies @xmath8 in trap @xmath2 and @xmath9 in trap @xmath1 ) ; @xmath10 ; @xmath11 , where vectors @xmath12 and @xmath13 points positions of the traps ; @xmath14 is the angle between @xmath15 and the light polarization vector , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the stokes shift .",
    "the light driven electron transitions in hand are accompanied by phonon generation .",
    "phonons are excluded from the formula ( [ w1 ] ) therefore exact energy conservation law @xmath19 ( @xmath20 is phonon energy ) looks like conservation with the accuracy @xmath21 : according to ( [ w1 ] ) an electron may be transfered to different levels in the range of the band width @xmath22 . absorption band ( [ w1 ] ) as a function of @xmath23 gains maximum ( resonance ) at the energy @xmath24 .",
    "we shall call the excited states with the @xmath25 as low energy excitations ( deep levels ) and excited states with the @xmath26 as high energy ones .",
    "as a first step we shall examine light driven kinetics of a single electron in external electric field @xmath27 .",
    "it is nontrivial : as we shall see electron is shifted by light predominantly in opposite to the electric force @xmath28 direction .",
    "the idea of such behavior is following .",
    "if vector of electron transfer is @xmath29 then dipole moment generated is @xmath30 ( @xmath31 is electron charge ) .",
    "field contribution to the energy of the excitation is @xmath32 .",
    "if the electron is transported in opposite to the electric force direction ( @xmath33 ) the energy of the electron excitation @xmath34 becomes larger ; low energy excitation becomes closer to resonance @xmath35 and therefore probability of its generation increases .",
    "this means that electron transfer to the deep levels goes predominantly in opposite to the electric force direction .",
    "electron transitions to high levels go mainly in the direction of the force but these levels have less life time in comparison with deep levels therefore contribution of the deep levels prevails . in the case of two electrons according to the above idea light would push each electron in the direction of the other electron . let the second electron is embedded at positions @xmath36 then coulomb interaction shifts all energy levels for the first electron and , hence , shifting the excitation energies by @xmath37 for the transition @xmath38 of the first electron .",
    "transitions which reduces electron - electron distance give positive contribution to the coulomb energy and shift deep excitations towards the resonance @xmath35 .",
    "that is why low energy transitions of an electron are directed preferably towards the other electron and effective electron - electron interaction becomes attractive under strong pumping . due to shorter",
    "life time high energy excitations play minor role in comparison with deep levels and therefore contribution of low energy excitations dominates . at high",
    "pumping these transitions dominate also over ordinary mobility which is quite low and independent on laser power .",
    "effective attraction between electrons makes their homogeneous distribution unstable and electron bunches are formed .",
    "phonon assistance designates two peculiar features of our system : first , it is dissipative ( not hamiltonian ) ; secondly , phonons brake phase relations for the electron wave functions therefore nondiagonal elements of the density matrix vanish and only probabilities of the site populations appear in consideration and they give full and correct description of the system . if the energy difference @xmath39 ( electron loses energy ) , there are two channels to transit : first , it can undergo light - induced transition with the rate being described in a way analogous to ( [ w1 ] ) with the only change @xmath40 to @xmath41 ( @xcite ) ; second , it may relax to a lower energy state with the rate @xmath42 .",
    "so , for the electron transition process with the energy loss we have : @xmath43 the factor @xmath44 is of the order of the inverse lifetime for excited electron states in an atom , so that @xmath45 .",
    "light driven kinetics is governed by dimensionless pumping constant @xmath46 .",
    "wave function of trapped electron outside the trap @xmath1 is @xmath47 , where @xmath48 , @xmath49 is the electron mass , @xmath50 is spacing of bottom of trapped levels from the bottom of the extended states .",
    "normal scale for this parameter is @xmath51 .",
    "wave function of deep levels vanishes rapidly outside the trap while shallow levels have long tails of wave functions .",
    "their overlap is determined by the slowest function , therefore @xmath52 ( @xcite ) .    in the frame of the ( [ w1 ] ) , ( [ w2 ] ) master rules we studied light driven motion of two electrons and calculated their density - density correlation function @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the occupation numbers of the corresponding traps , @xmath56 is time .",
    "we normalize the correlation function by the factor @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is dimensionality of the system .",
    "this normalization avails to see the interaction effect : if the electrons were not interacting , one would have @xmath59 for the noncorrelated case . the typical @xmath60 for three dimensions",
    "is shown in fig .",

    "electron traps were randomly distributed in space and single electron level @xmath64 in each trap @xmath1 is also random according to some density of states .",
    "one electron in position @xmath36 shifts each initial level @xmath1 of the second electron to the energy of coulomb interaction ( and vice versa ) @xmath65 the parameters used for calculation are : average trap distance @xmath66 _  _ , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , impurity band width @xmath62 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 .",
    "the bound state of two electrons is formed at pumping constant @xmath71 .",
    "pumping constant @xmath72 corresponds to laser power @xmath73 .",
    "we found that at high pumping in wide region of parameters the correlation function has such a maximum . despite the coulomb repulsion two",
    "electrons prefer to stay at some finite distance .",
    "analogous behavior has been observed for @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "increase of average distance @xmath76 between the traps ( decrease of coulomb interaction ) results in narrowing and vanishing of the peak in @xmath60 . at",
    "lower @xmath77 the peak in @xmath60 vanishes also ( see for the details @xcite ) .",
    "electron motion reveals competition between ordinary mobility in the direction of the electric force @xmath78 given by relaxation term @xmath79 in ( [ w2 ] ) and light driven electron transfer in opposite direction . at long distance between the electrons",
    "the light induced transitions dominate and an electron is pushed to the other electron : light overcomes coulomb repulsion ( ! ) .",
    "this motion is stopped at short distances where coulomb repulsion dominates : electrons do not penetrate to short distance where correlation function tends to zero ( fig . [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "electric field at this distance is @xmath80 and this is an estimation for the effective electric field caused by light induced electron transfer .",
    "this field is close to the damage field @xmath81 . as the result of",
    "the competition bound state of two electrons is formed with some preferable distance between particles .",
    "effective attraction between electrons results in light driven electron bunching .",
    "we examined behavior of few electrons or even @xmath82 electrons and found quite similar peculiarities .",
    "energy shift of the initial levels for hopping electron is analogous to ( [ epsilon ] ) but is given by all other electrons : @xmath83     is decreased under light pumping ( parameters are @xmath84 , @xmath85 _  _ , @xmath86 _  _ , @xmath87 , number of electrons @xmath88.).,width=604,height=529 ]    , @xmath85 _  _ , @xmath86 _  _ , @xmath87 , @xmath89).,width=604,height=529 ]    we studied temporal change of the average size of the electron cloud @xmath90 and coulomb energy @xmath91 .",
    "the result is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig7 ] , [ fig8 ] : electron cloud is pressed by light into compact bunch .",
    "we see again electron motion which is impossible in thermodynamic case : the system tends to the state with higher energy ( fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) .",
    "bunch formation is accompanied by strong increase of the electric field at the boundary of the bunch .",
    "the formation is stopped by this field when it gains the value @xmath92 .",
    "it is convenient to introduce ground state and electron - hole presentation for the investigation of many body system in glass .",
    "glass never attain full thermodynamic equilibrium but partial equilibrium is possible and one may consider that at ground state all electron levels bellow some energy @xmath93 are occupied and states above this level are empty . energy shift of a level is determined in this case by the contribution of all electrons and holes available .",
    "@xmath94    contribution to the energy of the first excited electron is given by its `` own '' hole only @xmath95    where @xmath36 is position of the hole .",
    "calculation of light induced polarization have shown that it is directed in opposite to an external field direction ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) and therefore amplifies this field .",

    "we examined behavior of many body system of different size for one- , two- and three - dimensional samples . in main features",
    "it is the same for all dimensions .",
    "the corresponding model is presented in details in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "computer simulation of the electron kinetics in the finite sample under external electric field shows that in agreement with the above idea electrons are transported by light predominantly in the direction opposite to the electric force ( electric current flows contra the voltage drop ) .",
    "this transfer is in contrast to the electron motion in a thermodynamic case when electrons move in the direction of the external force reducing in accordance with the le chatelet principle the external field ( negative feedback ) . in our case glass",
    "reveals positive feedback in response to the electric field . as a result strong static polarization directed in opposite to the external electric field is established .",
    "this polarization amplifies the initial field considerably . at the field of saturation",
    "light induced electron transitions are in the dynamical equilibrium with the ordinary electron mobility in opposite direction .",
    "computer simulation of the light driven electron - hole kinetics have shown positive feedback in response to static electric field in wide region of parameters independently on the dimension of the system .",
    "this unusual response makes homogeneous electron distribution unstable : an electron moves towards another electron or towards a cluster of electrons and macroscopic bunches are formed .",
    "we performed special experiment in order to observe directly the discussed bunching .",
    "strong laser wave with photon energy @xmath103 was used .",
    "band gap in our glass @xmath104 and therefore direct generation of free electrons and holes is impossible .",
    "however in the region of strong electric field due to franz - keldysh effect @xcite , @xcite this process becomes effective .",
    "energy discrepancy @xmath105 between the glass gap and photon energy is gained from the static electric field in process of electron tunneling ( the corresponding estimation see in @xcite ) .",
    "so , domain boundaries due to strong electric field become a weak chain in glass bonds and light driven bond breaking ( local fusion ) reveals bunch structure of the self - organized state .",
    "high quality uv - grade fused silica samples ( ku-1 ) with thicknesses of @xmath106 have been used in the experiment . before the experiment",
    "the samples have been subjected to ultrasonic cleaning in acetone and ethanol followed by washing in de - ionized water .",
    "two beams from the unstable resonator of the @xmath107 excimer laser ( @xmath108 , cl-7000 , pic gpi ) were focused on the rear side of a sample by the lens made of @xmath109 .",
    "we changed the angle between beams and therefore produced grating with different periods at the output surface of the glass .",

    "the material sputtering ( ablation ) occurs on the rear side of a fused silica plate with no stimulation of the process ( such as plasma generation in the vicinity of a sample or specific uv absorbing medium @xcite ) .",
    "analogous behavior was observed in @xcite where surface structuring took place at the @xmath119 interface and was explained in another way as interface property .",
