    "the _ fermi _ large area telescope source 1fgl j1018.65856 @xcite was recently discovered to have modulation of its 100 mev200 gev emission with a @xmath4 d period @xcite .",
    "_ swift _ observations identified a variable x - ray source with a position consistent with the location of the @xmath0-ray source , and radio flux variations were also found using the australia telescope compact array @xcite .",
    "@xcite observed the source using _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ , finding absorbed power law spectra that are variable in both flux and hardness .",
    "the observed variability from radio to gev energies implies that 1fgl j1018.65856 is a member of the elite group of `` @xmath0-ray binaries '' , which are high mass x - ray binaries that also exhibit rare @xmath0-ray emission .",
    "the proposed optical and near - infrared ( oir ) counterpart of the high energy source is 2mass 101855605856459 .",
    "@xcite find a spectral type of o6 v((f ) ) for the star , similar to the @xmath0-ray binary ls 5039 @xcite . otherwise ,",
    "knowledge of the optical star in this system is quite limited . in this letter",
    ", we present strmgren photometry of 2mass 101855605856459 to investigate the optical variability of the source , the interstellar reddening @xmath3 , and the distance .",
    "we observed 2mass 101855605856459 using the cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) 0.9 m telescope , operated by the smarts consortium .",
    "we used the site 2048 ccd in unbinned , quad readout mode with a plate scale of 0.401/pixel .",
    "observations were taken between ut dates 2011 may 20 - 26 and 2011 june 17 - 23 using the strmgren @xmath5 and @xmath6 filters .",
    "bias images and sky flats were taken at the start of every night .",
    "we observed four standard stars @xcite at a minimum of three different air masses each night .",
    "hd 79039 , hd 80484 , hd 128726 , hd 157795 were used on the may run , and hd 104664 , hd 105498 , hd 156623 , and hd 157795 were used during june .",
    "the target was observed once each night in both filters with exposure times of 400700 s and 200500 s in @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "the data were reduced using standard _",
    "quadproc _ and _ cosmicray _ routines in iraf .",
    "we used an aperture of 7  to determine the instrumental magnitudes of the target and standards , and we calibrated the apparent magnitudes using the method of @xcite . due to poor photometric conditions on most nights , we found that only data from ut dates 2011 may 21 , may 26 , and june 23 were well calibrated .",
    "our quoted errors include both the instrumental and transformation coefficient errors as described by @xcite .",
    "the resulting apparent magnitudes of 2mass 101855605856459 are listed in table [ mags ] .",
    "we find that the optical magnitudes of the star are constant within errors , but we recommend more extensive observations to investigate the variability over the complete orbital period .",
    "we used the mean @xmath7 magnitudes , with errors added in quadrature to be conservative , to determine the strmgren @xmath7 fluxes according to @xcite .",
    "we converted the @xmath8 magnitudes of 2mass 101855605856459 @xcite to fluxes using the calibration of @xcite .",
    "these oir fluxes constitute the observed spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the optical star in the @xmath0-ray binary .",
    "@xcite present an optical spectrum of the star , which they classify as o6 v((f ) ) .",
    "the lack of emission in the h@xmath9 or @xmath10 are indicative of an unevolved , main sequence star with relatively weak stellar winds .",
    "they do observe weak emission in @xmath11 , which is normal in main sequence o - type stars .",
    "we used the calibration of @xcite to estimate the physical properties of the star , listed in table [ params ] .",
    "we used an effective temperature @xmath12 k and surface gravity @xmath13 and interpolated within the grid of tlusty ostar2002 model fluxes @xcite to produce a model sed for 2mass 101855605856459 .",
    "we binned the model sed to 50   bins to remove small scale line features .    using a grid of values for the reddening , @xmath3 , and a ratio of total - to - selective extinction @xmath14",
    ", we applied the galactic reddening model of @xcite to compare reddened model seds to the observed stellar fluxes .",
    "the ratio of the observed stellar flux to the reddened model provides the stellar angular size , @xmath15 @xcite . using the estimated stellar radius @xmath16 @xcite ,",
    "the distance @xmath17 can thus be determined .",
    "we determined the best fit , @xmath18 and @xmath19 kpc by minimizing the mean square of the deviations , rms@xmath20 .",
    "the formal error in @xmath3 is the offset from the best - fit value that increases the rms@xmath20 by @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the number of wavelength points within the fit region .",
    "our formal error in @xmath17 is determined by the range of allowable @xmath3 values .",
    "this reddened model sed is shown with the observed fluxes in figure [ sed ] .",
    "another potential source of error is the lack of precisely measured @xmath23 and @xmath24 for 2mass 101855605856459 .",
    "based on the absence of strong emission lines , the main sequence nature of the hot star is well constrained and we allow a range of @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath23 is less well constrained , so we allow a 10% error in this quantity to provide a more generous range in the allowed @xmath3 and @xmath17 . for each @xmath23 and @xmath24 model",
    ", we determined @xmath26 by interpolating between the evolutionary tracks for non - rotating stars from @xcite .",
    "we repeated our distance and reddening measurements for the possible extrema of @xmath23 and @xmath24 which results in the more realistic error bars @xmath1 and @xmath2 kpc .",
    "the observed neutral hydrogen column density , from _ chandra _ observations , is @xmath27 atoms  @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "their _ xmm - newton _ observation was best fit using somewhat smaller errors for @xmath29 , @xmath30 atoms  @xmath28 . using the relation @xmath31 atoms @xmath28 mag@xmath32 @xcite ,",
    "the _ chandra _ detections predict a possible range for the optical reddening of @xmath33 .",
    "thus our measurement of @xmath3 is consistent with their results for @xmath29 from _",
    "our distance measurement also agrees well with the value from @xcite , who estimate @xmath34 kpc . on the other hand ,",
    "our measurement is somewhat smaller than the estimate of @xmath35 kpc by @xcite .",
    "we attribute this difference to the refined value of @xmath3 available due to our strmgren photometry of the source . with our improved distance , the unabsorbed luminosities of the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _",
    "observations should be revised downward to 36% of the values provided by @xcite .",
