    "today , the _ de facto _ standard approach in _ ab initio _ quantum - mechanical many - particle propagation is the multiconfigurational time - dependent hartree method ( mctdh ) and its variations @xcite .",
    "already for @xmath0 electrons in three dimensions , the full six - dimensional time - dependent schrdinger equation is very hard to solve and can only be handled on supercomputers .",
    "with mctdh for identical particles the exponential scaling of the hilbert space dimension with respect to @xmath1 is `` postponed '' to higher number of particles , and the @xmath0 propagation can be done on a single desktop computer .",
    "current implementations can handle @xmath2 electrons in cylindrical geometries reliably @xcite . for bosons ,",
    "the pauli exclusion principle is absent , and mctdh can treat hundreds @xcite and even thousands of particles @xcite in one - dimensional geometries , and recent multi - layer mctdh techniques allow _ distinguishable _ dimensions in the _ thousands _ with relative ease @xcite , showing great promise of extending the domain of application of mctdh methods .",
    "mctdh is derived using the time - dependent variational principle @xcite . as such , it is energy conserving , unitary and quasi - optimal in the sense that the growth of the error in the 2-norm is locally minimized .    _",
    "ab initio _ dynamical problems in quantum mechanics are formulated on an infinite domain which must be truncated for numerical calculations .",
    "the numerical reflections implied by the truncations are usually dealt with using absorbing boundary conditions of some sort .",
    "the most common approach is to introduce a complex absorbing potential ( cap ) in a region around the truncated domain @xcite .",
    "that is , the hamiltonian @xmath3 is mapped to @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is a local one - body potential vanishing on the domain of interest , and only taking nonzero values outside the domain .",
    "this approach is also used in order to calculate properties like reaction and ionization probabilities , and caps are routinely implemented in mctdh codes  @xcite .",
    "other absorbing operators are also common , such as the so - called transformative cap ( tcap ) @xcite , which is more or less equivalent with the non - local cap obtained using smooth exterior scaling @xcite or perfectly matched layers @xcite . while _ exact _ and space - local absorbing boundary conditions may be formulated @xcite , they are in general non - local in time , and therefore impractical . in this work ,",
    "we focus solely on a local cap for simplicity , but any absorbing operator can be used .",

    ", @xmath6 evolves according to the non - hermitian schrdinger equation @xmath7 an elementary calculation gives @xmath8 for the probability derivative .",
    "consequently , if the wave - function overlaps the cap , the whole wave - function decays and eventually vanishes ; it does _ not _ approach a wave - function with a different number of particles .",

    "it was argued that the solution is a density operator approach @xcite because the loss of particles is an irreversible process ; @xmath11 is a non - hermitian operator implying a preferred direction of time .",
    "the necessity of the quantum dynamical semigroup describing the evolution to be trace - preserving , markovian and completely positive implies the applicability of the famous theorems due to lindblad and gorini and coworkers @xcite , giving a master equation on lindblad form .",

    "the original formulation of the @xmath1-particle problem is not changed , but extended to yield @xmath16 particle systems as a by - product .",

    "the evolution of @xmath6 under the non - hermitian schrdinger equation  ( [ eq : nh - se ] ) is irreversible .",
    "it introduces a preferred direction in time , which is easily seen from the fact that the evolution can not be reversed : eventually @xmath20 , and the backward propagation may be non - existent , even mathematically .",
    "we now give an interpretation of the square norm @xmath19 in terms of measurements performed continuously in time , thereby exposing the irreversibility . to this end , consider first a closed single - particle system , described by the hamiltonian @xmath3without a cap  in the hilbert space @xmath21 .",
    "quantum mechanically , the squared norm @xmath22 of the wave - function is the probability of finding the particle _ somewhere _ in configuration space .",
    "equivalently , it is the probability of obtaining the value @xmath23 upon measurement of trivial observable @xmath24 ( the identity operator ) .    adding a cap @xmath25 to the hamiltonian and keeping the probability interpretation of @xmath22 has non - trivial implications .",
    "the description is obviously no longer in accordance with the basic postulates of quantum mechanics , since @xmath26 that is to say , total probability is _ not conserved_.    suppose we perform a single measurement on the observable @xmath27 given by @xmath28 i.e. , of the projection operator @xmath27 onto @xmath29 , the truncated computational domain .",
    "it has two eigenvalues , @xmath30 and @xmath23 , corresponding to finding the particle outside or inside @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "we will obtain the answer @xmath30 with probability @xmath31 and the answer @xmath23 with probability @xmath32 .",
    "after measurement , the wave - function collapses onto @xmath33 in the former case , and @xmath34 in the latter .",
    "note that the wave - function collapse is irreversible , as the original wave - function can not be reconstructed after the event .",
    "suppose we perform many experiments at short time intervals @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "each experiment yields certain information about the system after the measurement : we know with certainty if the particle is in @xmath29 or not .",

    "this probability is classical in the sense that it is a probability description of the history of our macroscopic measurement device , or of its print - out on a sheet of paper if one prefers .",
    "if we allow the approximation @xmath40 which dampens @xmath41 strongly outside @xmath29 , we get @xmath42 in the limit of small @xmath37 , we see that the solution to the schrdinger equation with a cap is obtained .",
    "@xmath43 is then the probability of finding the measurement apparatus in the state `` the particle has not yet been found outside @xmath29 '' at time @xmath44 .",
    "our discussion is immediately suggestive of interpreting the cap as an actual model for some external detecting device , which was already pointed out in the first paper on caps in quantum mechanics @xcite . although it is likely that eq .",
    "( [ eq : fundamental - master ] ) can be derived in such a way , it is not relevant here , as the schrdinger equation with a cap is our starting point .",
    "the above discussion is only intended as a means for understanding the irreversibility of the non - hermitian dynamics .",

    "this equation was discussed at length , and a multiconfigurational time - dependent hartree method was presented that is a strict generalization of standard pure - state mctdh evolution for identical particles or mixtures . a numerical experiment on a simple system of @xmath285 spin - polarized fermions was reported .",
