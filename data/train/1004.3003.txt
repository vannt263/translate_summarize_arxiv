    "electric response of a high temperature superconductor ( htsc ) under magnetic field has been a subject of extensive experimental and theoretical investigation for years .",

    "the dynamic properties of fluxons appearing in the bulk of a sample are strongly affected by the combined effect of thermal fluctuations , anisotropy ( dimensionality ) and the flux pinning @xcite .",
    "thermal fluctuations in these materials are far from negligible and in particular are responsible for existence of the first - order vortex lattice melting transition separating two thermodynamically distinct phases , the vortex solid and the vortex liquid . magnetic field and reduced dimensionality due to pronounced layered structure ( especially in materials like bi@xmath1sr@xmath4cacuo@xmath5 ) further enhance the effect of thermal fluctuations on the mesoscopic scale",
    ". on the other hand the role of pinning in high-@xmath0 materials is reduced significantly compared to the low temperature one , leading to smaller critical currents . at elevated temperatures the thermal depinning @xcite",
    "further diminishes effects of disorder .",
    "linear response to electric field in the mixed state of these superconductors has been thoroughly explored experimentally and theoretically over the last three decades .",
    "these experiments were performed at very small voltages in order to avoid effects of nonlinearity .",
    "deviation from linearity however are interesting in their own right .",
    "these effects have also been studied in low-@xmath0 superconductors experimentallykajimura71,grenoble and theoretically @xcite  and recently experiments were extended to htsc compounds @xcite .    since thermal fluctuations in the low-@xmath0 materials are negligible compared to the inter - vortex interactions , the moving vortex matter is expected to preserve a regular lattice structure ( for weak enough disorder ) . on the other hand ,",
    "as mentioned above , the vortex lattice melts in htsc over large portions of their phase diagram , so the moving vortex matter in the region of vortex liquid can be better described as an irregular flowing vortex liquid . in particular",
    "the nonlinear effects will also be strongly influenced by the thermal fluctuations .",
    "a simpler case of a zero or very small magnetic field in the case of strong thermal fluctuations was in fact comprehensively studied theoretically varlamov albeit in linear response only",
    ". in any superconductor there exists a critical region around the critical temperature @xmath6 , in which the fluctuations are strong ( the ginzburg number characterizing the strength of thermal fluctuations is just @xmath7 for low @xmath0 , while @xmath8 for htsc materials ) . outside the critical region and for small electric fields ,",
    "the fluctuation conductivity was calculated by aslamazov and larkin @xcite by considering ( noninteracting ) gaussian fluctuations within bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) and within a more phenomenological ginzburg - landau ( gl ) approach . in the framework of the gl approach ( restricted to the lowest landau level approximation ) , ullah and",
    "dorsey @xcite computed the ettingshausen coefficient by using the hartree approximation .",
    "this approach was extended to other transport phenomena like the hall conductivity @xcite and the nernst effect @xcite .",
    "the fluctuation conductivity within linear response can be applied to describe sufficiently weak electric fields , which do not perturb the fluctuations spectrum @xcite . physically at electric field , which is able to accelerate the paired electrons on a distance of the order of the coherence length @xmath9 so that they change their energy by a value corresponding to the cooper pair binding energy , the linear response is already inapplicable @xcite .",
    "the resulting additional field dependent depairing leads to deviation of the current - voltage characteristics from the ohm s law .",
    "the non - ohmic fluctuation conductivity was calculated for a layered superconductor in an arbitrary electric field considering the fluctuations as noninteracting gaussian ones varlamov92,mishonov02 .",
    "the fluctuations suppression effect of high electric fields in htsc was investigated experimentally for the in - plane paraconductivity in zero magnetic field @xcite , and a good agreement with the theoretical models @xcite was found .    in this paper",
    "the nonlinear electric response of the moving vortex liquid in a layered superconductor under magnetic field perpendicular to the layers is studied using the time dependent gl ( tdgl ) approach .",
    "the layered structure is modeled via the lawrence - doniach discretization in the magnetic field direction . in the moving vortex liquid",
    "the long range crystalline order is lost due to thermal fluctuations and the vortex matter becomes homogeneous on a scale above the average inter - vortex distances .",
    "although sometimes motion tends to suppress the fluctuations , they are still a dominant factor in flux dynamics .",
    "the tdgl approach is an ideal tool to study a combined effect of the dissipative ( overdamped ) flux motion and thermal fluctuations conveniently modeled by the langevin white noise .",
    "the interaction term in dynamics is treated in gaussian approximation which is similar in structure to the hartree - fock one .",
    "theoretically the nonlinear effects in htsc have been addressed @xcite .",
    "however the results of ref .",
    "are different from our in this paper and we will sketch the difference below .",
    "firstly the model of ref . , is physically different from ours .",
    "the authors in ref .",
    "believe that the two quantities , layer distance and thickness in the lawrence - doniach for htsc are equal ( apparently not the case in htsc ) , while we consider them as two independent parameters .",
    "another difference is we use so called self - consistent gaussian approximation to treat the model while ref . used the hartree - fock approximation .",
    "a main contribution of our paper is an explicit form of the green function incorporating all landau levels .",
    "this allows to obtain explicit formulas without need to cutoff higher landau levels . in ref .",
    ", a nontrivial matrix inversion ( of infinite matrices ) or cutting off the number of landau levels is required .",
    "note that the exact analytical expression of green function of the linearized tdgl equation in dc field can be even generalized also to ac field .",
    "the method is very general , and it allow us to study transport phenomena beyond linear response of type - ii superconductor like the nernst effect , hall effect .",
    "the renormalization of the models is also different from ref . .",
    "one of the main result of our work is that the conductivity formula is independent of uv cutoff ( unlike in ref . ) as it should be as the standard @xmath10 theory is renormalizable .",
    "furthermore gaussian approximation used in this paper is consistent to leading order with perturbation theory , see ref . in which it is shown that this procedure preserved a correct the ultraviolet ( uv ) renormalization ( is rg invariant ) . without electric field the issue was comprehensively discussed in a textbook kleinert @xcite .",
    "one can use hartree - fock procedure only when uv issues are unimportant .",
    "we can also show , if there is no electric field , the result obtained using tdgl model and gaussian approximation will lead the same thermodynamic equation using gaussian approximation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
