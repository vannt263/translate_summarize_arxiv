    "entanglement of quantum systems is a potentially powerful resource for quantum information processing  @xcite .",
    "however , in the presence of noise , it is currently not known precisely _ which _ entangled states are useful , and a vast theory of mixed - state entanglement has developed to classify states according to their entanglement properties  @xcite .    in this paper , we show that the theory of pure - state entanglement when quantum operations are restricted  described formally by a superselection rule ",
    "precisely replicates the structure of mixed - state entanglement , including such exotic properties as bound entanglement and activation .",
    "this analogy is useful both for the theory of mixed - state entanglement , and for that of pure - state entanglement under restricted operations .",
    "after over a decade of debate on issues such as the non - locality of a single photon  @xcite and the role of a phase reference in quantum teleportation  @xcite , we resolve these conceptual issues by demonstrating that entanglement under restricted operations can be viewed as _ bound _ by the restriction .",
    "in addition , we demonstrate that the surprising results for entanglement under constraints  @xcite arise from the coexistence of two distinct operational notions of entanglement , and that distinguishing these notions realizes the entire structure of the pre - existing mixed - state entanglement theory .",
    "thus , we demonstrate that the specialized concepts of the field of mixed - state entanglement ( such as activation and multi - copy distillation ) can be applied to a wide variety of practical situations .",
    "moreover , unsolved questions for mixed - state entanglement have analogous questions in the context of pure - state entanglement under restrictions , and these can be answered in some cases .",
    "it is hoped that this formal analogue of the complex and surprising structure of mixed - state entanglement in another situation  one that is conceptually straightforward to understand and interpret  will ultimately lead to new results in mixed - state entanglement theory .",
    "in this section , we present some known results for the classification of mixed - state entanglement , with our own bias and some new terminology . for an extensive review of mixed - state entanglement , see  @xcite .",
    "central to the theory of entanglement is the classification of the states of a quantum system shared between two parties ( alice and bob ) who can perform only local quantum operations and classical communication ( locc ) .",
    "this limitation on their operations means on the one hand that certain states can not be prepared by the two parties starting from some uncorrelated fiducial state , and on the other hand that certain states shared by the two parties may serve as resources allowing them to perform tasks not possible with locc alone . in this paper",
    ", it will be important to distinguish between various sets of states characterized by either _",
    "( i ) _ the operations required to prepare them , or _",
    "( ii ) _ the resource they provide for quantum information processing tasks . to emphasise the distinctions between these sets ,",
    "we adopt a slightly unconventional terminology for mixed - state entanglement .",
    "first , we identify the class of bi - partite states that are _ locally preparable _ , that is , preparable by locc ( starting with some uncorrelated fiducial state ) .",
    "we denote this class lp .",
    "second , we identify the class of states that are _ distillable _",
    "@xcite , denoted d. states are distillable if @xmath0 copies can be converted into @xmath1 pure maximally entangled states via locc for some @xmath2 in the limit @xmath3 .",
    "a _ pure _ state is either locally preparable or distillable ( either in lp or in d ) , depending on whether it is a product state or not ( i.e. , a state of the form @xmath4-dimensional space , wherein all separable states are in lp , and all non - separable states are distillable  @xcite . on an arbitrary bi - partite space ,",
    "we define a state @xmath5 to be 1-distillable if there exists an operation implementable with locc , represented by a completely positive map @xmath6  @xcite , that maps @xmath5 onto a @xmath7-dimensional subspace of the bi - partite system such that @xmath8 is non - separable ( and thus distillable ) .",
    "if a state is 1-distillable then it is distillable . for pure states ,",
    "1-distillability is equivalent to distillability , and thus every pure state is either locally preparable or 1-distillable .",
    "this is not the case for mixed states . due to the existence of bound entangled states ( i.e. , states that are neither locally preparable nor distillable ) , and the fact that 1-d @xmath9 d , there exist mixed states that are neither locally preparable _ nor _ 1-distillable .",
    "we shall refer to all such states as _",
    "1-bound_.        remarkably , by appropriately extending the set of operations that alice and bob can perform beyond locc , all states become either locally preparable or 1-distillable .",
    "we describe this extension of operations as supplementing locc with an additional _ resource_. clearly , additional power will affect the boundaries of what alice and bob can prepare or distill ; we are interested in a resource that precisely removes the proper gap between lp and 1-d .",
    "consider extending locc to allow all operations that preserve the positivity of the partial transpose of states  @xcite .",
    "with this additional resource , all states with positive partial transpose ( ppt ) can be prepared locally .",
    "all states that are not ppt are 1-distillable with this additional power in the sense that they can be mapped by a ppt - preserving operation @xmath6 onto a @xmath7-dimensional space such that @xmath8 is non - separable  @xcite .",
    "states that are not locally preparable with locc , but locally preparable given locc plus the additional resource , can be said to _ become _ locally preparable given the resource , denoted blp .",
    "similarly , the class of states that are not 1-distillable but become 1-distillable given the resource we denote as b1-d . for mixed bi - partite states under ppt - preserving operations",
    ", the class blp contains all ppt bound entangled states and the class b1-d contains all non - ppt states that are not 1-distillable ; both classes are non - empty  @xcite .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "the categories blp and b1-d are related in an interesting way . through an isomorphism between bi - partite quantum states and quantum operations , any ppt - preserving operation can be implemented probabilistically using locc and a specific state in blp ( i.e. , a specific ppt bound entangled state )  @xcite .",
    "recall that any b1-d state becomes 1-distillable if alice and bob are given the additional resource of all ppt - preserving operations .",
    "thus , for every @xmath10 there exists a state @xmath11 such that @xmath12 is 1-distillable .",
    "we say that the state @xmath13 _ activates _ the entanglement of the state @xmath10 using only locc operations  @xcite ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] .     can be used to `` activate '' the entanglement of a b1-d state @xmath5 , i.e. , the combined state @xmath14 is 1-distillable.,width=312 ]    another remarkable feature of mixed - state entanglement is that , although states in b1-d are not 1-distillable , they may nevertheless be distillable  @xcite .",
    "we define a state @xmath5 to be @xmath0-distillable ( in @xmath0-d ) if there exists an locc operation @xmath15 onto a @xmath16-dimensional space such that @xmath17 is non - separable . in other words ,",
    "the joint state @xmath18 is 1-distillable .",
    "if a state is @xmath0-distillable for some @xmath0 then it is distillable .",
    "( in fact , it has been shown  @xcite that @xmath0-d is a proper subset of d for all finite @xmath0 . )",
    "thus , mixed - state entanglement exhibits multi - copy distillability , meaning that there exist states in b1-d that are not 1-distillable but that are @xmath0-distillable for some @xmath19 .",
    "there remain , however , many open questions regarding the general structure of mixed - state entanglement .",
    "perhaps the most important question from the point of view of quantum information processing is : are _ all _ states in b1-d distillable ?",
    "to introduce the concepts and results developed later in this paper , we first begin by providing a simple example of how the phenomena arising in the context of mixed - state entanglement have precise analogues in the structure of pure - state entanglement under a restriction on operations . specifically , we consider some well - studied states from quantum optics and the restriction of a _ local photon - number superselection rule_.      the restriction of a local photon - number superselection rule implies that a party can not prepare coherent superpositions of states of different local photon number ( starting with states without coherence ) , nor measure such coherences , nor implement a transformation that creates such coherence .",
    "for instance , if alice is restricted by a local photon - number superselection rule , she can not prepare a state of the form latexmath:[$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle_a +    @xmath0-photon eigenstate of a mode in alice s possession .",
    "however , she can prepare the state @xmath21 on a pair of modes in her possession ( where @xmath22 relative to her phase reference .",
    "if the relative phase between alice and charlie s phase references was known to be @xmath23 , then this same state would be represented by the density operator @xmath24 relative to charlie s phase reference , where @xmath25 is alice s local photon number operator .",
    "given that @xmath23 is completely unknown , one must average over its possible values to obtain the state relative to charlie .",
    "this state is @xmath26 \\equiv \\int_0^{2\\pi } \\frac{d\\phi}{2\\pi}\\ ,    e^{-i\\phi \\hat{n}_a } \\rho_a e^{i\\phi \\hat{n}_a } \\,,\\ ] ] which is equivalent to @xmath27 = \\sum_n \\pi^a_n \\rho_a \\pi^a_n \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the projector onto the @xmath0th eigenspace of @xmath25 .",
    "the map @xmath29 removes all coherence between states of differing total photon number on alice s systems .",
    "similarly , any operations alice implements relative to her phase reference are redescribed relative to charlie s phase reference as operations that commute with @xmath29 .",
    "thus , relative to charlie , alice experiences a restriction on operations that is described by a superselection rule for local photon number @xmath25 as defined in  @xcite .",
    "a similar argument applies to states and operations of bob relative to charlie , characterised by a map @xmath30 .",
    "thus , the situation where alice and bob lack charlie s phase reference is a restriction formally equivalent to a superselection rule for local photon number .",
    "we note that although the term `` superselection rule '' was initially introduced to describe an _ in principle _",
    "restriction on quantum states and operations  @xcite , it has been emphasized by aharonov and susskind  @xcite that whether or not coherent superpositions of a particular observable are possible is a practical matter , depending on the availability of a suitable reference system .",
    "modern arguments in favour of this view may be found in refs .",
    "@xcite , and we follow the practice of using the term `` superselection rule '' to describe both in principle and practical restrictions on operations .      in such situations , there has been considerable debate over the entanglement properties of certain types of states , such as the two - mode single - photon state  @xcite @xmath31 there is a temptation to say that this state is entangled simply because of its nonproduct form .",
    "however , it is far more useful to consider whether or not this state satisfies certain _ operational _ notions of entanglement .",
    "one such notion is whether a state can be used to violate a bell inequality .",
    "another is whether it is useful as a resource for quantum information processing , for instance , to teleport qubits or implement a dense coding protocol . in the context of a local photon - number superselection rule",
    ", this two - mode single - photon state fails to satisfy either of these notions of entanglement , because all such tasks would require alice and bob to violate the local photon - number superselection rule .",
    "a different but equally common notion of entanglement is that a state is entangled if it can not be prepared by locc .",
    "the two - mode single - photon state certainly _ does _ fit _ this _ notion because the pure nonproduct states can not be prepared by locc .",
    "thus we see that operational notions of entanglement that coincided for pure states under unrestricted locc , namely being not locally preparable and being useful as a resource for tasks such as teleportation or violating a bell inequality , do not coincide under a local photon - number superselection rule , and the state in question is judged entangled by one notion and not the other .. ]    this already has the flavour of the phenomenon of bound entanglement .",
    "however , strictly speaking , the two notions of entanglement that were explored in sec .",
    "[ sec : mse ] were local preparability and _ 1-distillability_. as one might expect from the above comments , these two notions do not coincide either , as we now show .",
    "consider a state of the form @xmath32 this state is certainly not locally preparable .",
    "in addition , it _ can _ be used to violate a bell inequality , implement dense coding , and so on , despite the superselection rule .",
    "this is because alice and bob can still implement any measurements they please in the 2-dimensional subspaces spanned by @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "thus , a useful notion of distillability for a bi - partite pure state in the context of a local photon number superselection rule is whether @xmath0 copies of the state can be converted into @xmath1 copies of latexmath:[$\\tfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2 } } ( |01\\rangle_a    a useful notion of _ 1-distillability _ for a bi - partite pure state in the context of a local photon number superselection rule is whether it can be projected to a nonproduct state in some @xmath16 subspace , where the 2-dimensional local spaces are _ eigenspaces of local photon number_.    by this definition , the state @xmath36 can not be mapped to the subspace spanned by @xmath37 under the restricted operations .",
    "this establishes the existence of pure states that are neither locally preparable nor 1-distillable under the local photon number superselection rule .",
    "thus , they are analogous to the _ 1-bound _ states introduced for mixed - state entanglement",
    ".    another class of states whose entanglement properties have been discussed recently in the quantum optics literature are those that are separable but not locally preparable under a local photon - number superselection rule  @xcite .",
    "examples of such states and @xmath38 . for simplicity ,",
    "we restrict our attention to pure states . ]",
    "are @xmath39 where @xmath40 .",
    "because of the superselection rule , these states can not be prepared locally .",
    "but they are not 1-distillable either because they are product states .",
    "thus , they also lie in the gap between what is locally preparable and what is 1-distillable .",
    "verstraete and cirac  @xcite identified such states as a `` new type of nonlocal resource '' , and van enk  @xcite identified states of the form of eq .",
    "( [ refbits ] ) as a standard unit of this nonlocal resource , which he called a `` refbit '' .",
    "we can identify these states also as analogues of the 1-bound states of mixed - state entanglement .      in the context of a superselection rule",
    ", there is also a resource that precisely removes the gap between what is locally preparable and 1-distillable ( as occurred in mixed - state entanglement by extending locc to all ppt - preserving operations ) .",
    "recall , as described above , that a local photon - number superselection rule applies if alice and bob are uncorrelated with the phase reference of charlie , who is preparing the bi - partite quantum states .",
    "clearly , if alice and bob are given phase references that are precisely correlated with charlie s , then they no longer face any restrictions beyond that of locc .",
    "thus , for alice and bob to possess a shared phase reference is for them to possess a resource that `` lifts '' the superselection rule . given this resource , states such as @xmath41 _ become _ locally preparable .      finally , we demonstrate that there exist analogous processes of activation and multi - copy distillation in this scenario .",
    "both of these processes have been discussed ( albeit using different terminology ) by van enk  @xcite for the specific quantum optical state examples we present here .",
    "combining @xmath42 one obtains a state that _ is _",
    "1-distillable . the state @xmath43",
    "we note that the controversy over the use of the state @xmath44 , a correlated pair of coherent states @xmath45 , are assumed to be shared between alice and bob .",
    "these modes are used as the local oscillators in the homodyne detections at each wing . noting that neither @xmath46 ( like the state @xmath47 ) _ activates _ the entanglement of the two - mode single photon state . to see this",
    ", we note that the same measurement of local photon number as described above projects the state onto a non - product state of random but definite local photon number , allowing for a demonstration of nonlocality within the constraints of the superselection rule .",
    "( such a measurement is , in fact , implemented using an ideal homodyne detection .",
    "loosely speaking , each observer s homodyne detection apparatus couples the two local modes at a beam splitter and then measures the number of photons in each of the two output ports .",
    "this incorporates a measurement of the total local photon number because the latter quantity can be obtained as the sum of the number in each output port .",
    "the difference of these two photocounts , which is typically the quantity of interest in homodyne detection , yields the information necessary to demonstrate the bell inequality violation . )",
    "an experimental demonstration of nonlocality using the two - mode single photon state can also be described as follows  @xcite . rather than treating the local oscillators as coherent states ,",
    "they are treated as correlated classical phase references . in this case",
    ", they constitute an additional resource that `` lifts '' the restriction of the local photon - number superselection rule , and the state @xmath48 where @xmath49 .",
    "in addition , they share two other modes prepared in a product of coherent states @xmath50 the former is the purported entanglement resource in the teleportation protocol , while the latter is a quantum version of a shared phase reference .",
    "these states are analogous to @xmath51 respectively  neither is 1-distillable when considered on its own .",
    "so the question arises as to how teleportation could possibly have been achieved when neither the purported entanglement resource nor the quantum shared phase reference are 1-distillable .",
    "the resolution to this puzzle is that although individually , neither is 1-distillable , together they are : the quantum shared phase reference _ activates _ the entanglement in the two - mode squeezed state .",
    "the second perspective is one wherein the shared phase reference is treated classically  @xcite .",
    "as described above , this acts as a resource which lifts the superselection rule , and causes the two - mode squeezed state to become 1-distillable .",
    "an analogue of multi - copy distillation can also be demonstrated in our quantum optical example .",
    "for instance , the state @xmath52^{\\otimes 2 } \\\\      \\propto \\tfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2 } } ( |01\\rangle_{a } |10\\rangle_b +      |10\\rangle_a |01\\rangle_b ) \\,,\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 . a process very similar to this 2-copy distillation has been demonstrated in quantum optics experiments ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) , where correlated but unentangled photon pairs from parametric downconversion were made incident on the two input modes of a beamsplitter , so each photon transforms to a state of the form @xmath54 pure - state entanglement under general restrictions --------------------------------------------------",
    "we now develop the analogy between mixed - state entanglement and pure - state entanglement when the allowed local quantum operations are restricted by a _",
    "( not necessarily abelian ) superselection rule .",
    "we continue to consider only pure states , because , although one could characterise mixed - state entanglement under such restrictions , the classification of such states would be at least as difficult as unrestricted mixed - state entanglement .",
    "we formulate a restriction on operations generally in the form of a superselection rule ( ssr ) associated with a finite or compact lie group @xmath55  @xcite .",
    "( a different concept of entanglement under restrictions on operations is discussed in  @xcite . )",
    "the superselection rule we describe can be defined operationally as follows .",
    "suppose alice and bob share a pair of systems , described by a hilbert space @xmath56 , the states on which were prepared and described by a third party , charlie .",
    "suppose further that the local reference frames of alice , bob and charlie , which transform via a group @xmath55 , are uncorrelated : that is , the element @xmath57 relating alice s and charlie s local frames is completely unknown , as is the element @xmath58 relating bob and charlie s local frames .",

    "a similar result holds for the operations that bob can implement .",

    "these are said to be locally @xmath55-invariant  @xcite .",
    "this restriction on operations is referred to as a local superselection rule for @xmath55 .",
    "a local superselection rule for @xmath55 induces the following structure in the local hilbert spaces ( we consider @xmath59 ) : @xmath69 i.e. , each local hilbert space is split into `` charge sectors '' labeled by @xmath0 and each carrying inequivalent representations @xmath70 of @xmath55 .",

    "[ sec : optics ] , this state can be considered to be bound entangled when local operations are constrained by a photon - number superselection rule . in addition , it is shown in  @xcite that this resource can be asymptotically converted to non - product locally @xmath89-invariant states . our result is stronger in that we show it is possible to prepare ( with some probability ) an effective two - qubit entangled state that is _ locally @xmath89-invariant _ using only operations obeying the superselection rule and at most three copies of any entangled pure state .",
    "this effective two - qubit state may then be distilled by standard techniques to prepare locally @xmath89-invariant maximally entangled pure states at some asymptotic rate .",
    "finally , we note that we can completely characterize the distillability properties of any pure state constrained by a local abelian superselection rule .",
    "we show that the class b1-d can be divided into three non - empty regions by establishing that 1-d@xmath103 is a _ proper _ subset of 2-d@xmath103 and 2-d@xmath103 is a _ proper _ subset of 3-d@xmath103 ( i.e. protocol a sometimes fails while protocol b succeeds ) .",
    "states such as @xmath154 expressed in the fock basis , are in 2-d@xmath103 ( using protocol b ) .",
    "none of them are locally @xmath89-invariant and therefore are not in 1-d@xmath103 .",
    "the state @xmath155 is in 3-d@xmath103 ( as is any state in b1-d ) .",
    "however , because two copies of this state become separable when averaged ( uniformly ) over @xmath89 locally , it is not in 2-d@xmath103 .",
    "in summary , we have shown how to reproduce the rich classification scheme of mixed - state entanglement by restricting local operations on the set of pure states so as to create a proper gap between what is locally preparable and what is 1-distillable .",
    "debates over the entanglement properties of pure states under restricted operations , such as have appeared in the quantum optics literature , are resolved by recognizing novel categories of entanglement in this context .",
    "our results suggest that the exotic structure of mixed - state entanglement is generic , and that developing entanglement theory under other sorts of restrictions is a promising direction for further research .",
    "for example , recent interest in creating bi - partite entangled states in condensed matter systems requires careful articulation of the operational meaning of entanglement , due to the various practical restrictions on operations on these systems .",
    "local particle - number superselection rules often apply in practice , and as noted in  @xcite , for example , the single - electron two - mode fock state latexmath:[$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle_a|1\\rangle_b +    this restriction . wiseman and vaccaro  @xcite",
    "have introduced an operational measure , called _ entanglement of particles _ to quantify the distillable entanglement under a local particle - number superselection rule , and this two - mode single - electron fock state has no entanglement of particles by this measure . for this reason , most proposals for creating bi - partite entangled states make use of spin or orbital angular momentum degrees of freedom of multiple particles  @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that the two - mode single - electron fock state is an entanglement resource akin to the two - mode single - photon state , which we have shown to be useful through activation or multi - copy distillation ; also , a suitable shared u(1 ) reference frame could `` lift '' the restriction of the superselection rule , and the two - mode single - electron fock state would be unambiguously entangled with such a resource . moreover",
    ", entangled states between angular momentum degrees of freedom of different particles will yield no real advantage over the two - mode single - electron fock state in situations wherein there is a local su(2 ) superselection rule .",
    "such a superselection rule will be in force , for instance , if the parties fail to share a cartesian frame for spatial orientations  @xcite . as with quantum optical systems",
    ", we emphasise the need to be operational when classifying or quantifying entanglement .",
    "the theory of entanglement for indistinguishable particles is another situation where our results may shed some light .",
    "recent research has investigated the `` quantum correlation between particles ''  @xcite , which relates to the correlations between indistinguishable particles inherent in the symmetry ( or antisymmetry ) of a many - particle wavefunction .",
    "@xcite argues that these quantum correlations are merely `` fluffy bunny entanglement ''  @xcite , that is , operationally useless .",
    "our work here supports this conclusion ; we would say that the entanglement is bound by the restriction of the indistinguishability of particles . nonetheless , in analogy with restrictions arising from superselection rules",
    ", it may be worthwhile to consider the possibility of `` lifting '' this restriction through an appropriate shared resource .",
    "the analogy we present here also suggests that it may be fruitful to think of standard locc as a restriction relative to the `` more natural '' ppt - preserving operations , and to consider whether a resource that lifts this restriction might be established with the same ease as a shared reference frame .",
    "this work was supported by the australian research council and the state of queensland .",
