    "thermal dilepton production in the low - mass region is largely mediated by the light vector mesons @xmath1 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 . among these ,",
    "the @xmath1(770 mev / c@xmath5 ) is the most important , due to its strong coupling to the @xmath6 channel and its short lifetime of only 1.3 fm / c , much shorter than the lifetime of the fireball .",
    "theoretical predictions exist for changes both of the mass and the width which are tied directly  @xcite or indirectly  @xcite to chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "while broadening of the @xmath1 is generally expected , changes of the mass are controversial . for masses @xmath70.9 gev / c@xmath5 , other hadronic processes set in , and partonic processes start to play a larger role as well . the first na60 results focused on the space - time averaged spectral function of the @xmath1 @xcite ; more details were added recently  @xcite .",
    "the present paper therefore concentrates on new developments : an analysis of the shape of the excess mass spectra  @xcite , and in particular first results on acceptance - corrected @xmath2 and @xmath8 spectra for different mass windows .",
    "mass and @xmath2 spectra are also compared to the latest theoretical developments  @xcite .",
    "details of the na60 apparatus are contained in  @xcite , while the different analysis steps ( including the critical assessment of the combinatorial background from @xmath9 and @xmath10 decays through event mixing ) are described in  @xcite .",
    "the results reported here were obtained from the analysis of data taken in 2003 for in - in at 158 agev . the left part of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the opposite - sign , background and signal dimuon mass spectra , integrated over all collision centralities . after subtracting the combinatorial background and the signal fake matches ,",
    "the resulting net spectrum contains about 360000 muon pairs in the mass range 0 - 2 gev / c@xmath11 , roughly 50% of the total available statistics .",
    "the associated average charged - particle multiplicity density measured by the vertex tracker is @xmath12 = 120 .",
    "the vector mesons @xmath3 and @xmath4 are completely resolved ; the mass resolution at the @xmath3 is 20 mev / c@xmath5 .",
    "a major part of the subsequent analysis is done in four classes of collision centrality ( defined through the charged - particle multiplicity density ) : peripheral ( 4@xmath1330 ) , semiperipheral ( 30@xmath13110 ) , semicentral ( 110@xmath13170 ) and central ( 170@xmath13240 ) .",
    "the peripheral data can essentially be described by the expected electromagnetic decays of the neutral mesons , i.e. the 2-body decays of the @xmath14 , @xmath1 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 resonances and the dalitz decays of the @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "this is not true in the more central bins , due to the existence of a strong excess . to isolate this excess with _ a priori unknown _ characteristics without any fits ,",
    "we have used a novel procedure as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( right ) , made possible by the high data quality . for each centrality bin ,",
    "the cocktail of the decay sources is subtracted from the data by using solely _ local _ criteria  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath16 on the contrary , is not subtracted .",
    "examples for the resulting difference spectra are contained in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( right ) for all centralities and in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] for the semicentral bin .",
    "the qualitative features of the spectra are striking : a peaked structure is always seen , residing on a broad continuum with a yield strongly increasing with centrality , but remaining essentially centered around the position of the nominal @xmath1 pole .",
    "further details on the subtraction procedure and the results , including a discussion of the systematic errors ( which reach up to 25% in the continuum region ) , can be found in  @xcite .",
    "a more quantitative analysis of the shape of the excess mass spectra vs. centrality has recently been performed , using a finer subdivision of the data into 12 centrality bins .",
    "the data ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , right ) were subdivided into 3 windows , one central ( c ) in the mass range 0.64@xmath17@xmath18@xmath170.84 gev / c@xmath5 , and two adjacent ones on the left ( l ) and the right ( r ) with equal widths .",
    "the spectral shape can then roughly be characterized by two yields : c-(l+r)/2 for the @xmath1-like peak , and 3(l+r)/2 for the underlying continuum .",
    "the ratios peak/@xmath1 , continuum/@xmath1 and peak / continuum ( where @xmath1 stands for the cocktail @xmath1 ) are plotted in the left part of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , compared to the rms of the total mass interval 0.44@xmath17@xmath18@xmath171.04    gev / c@xmath5 on the right .",
    "three essential features should be noted .",
    "first , the ratio peak/@xmath1 decreases from the most peripheral to the most central bin by nearly a factor of 2 , ruling out the naive view that the shape can simply be explained by the cocktail @xmath1 residing on a broad continuum , independent of centrality .",
    "second , the sum of the ratios ( peak+continuum)/@xmath1 is the total enhancement factor relative to the cocktail @xmath1 ; it reaches about 5.5 in the most central bin .",
    "third , the centrality dependences are largely consistent in the two plots .",
    "in particular , the flat part up to dn@xmath19/dy=100 is followed by more rapid changes in all variables , statistically highly significant for the ratio continuum/@xmath1 and the rms .     for different mass windows .",
    "right : rapidity distribution of the excess data for the mass window 0.6@xmath17@xmath18@xmath170.9 gev/@xmath20 and for three selected @xmath2 bins . the measured data ( full markers ) are reflected around midrapidity ( open markers).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]   for different mass windows .",
    "right : rapidity distribution of the excess data for the mass window 0.6@xmath17@xmath18@xmath170.9 gev/@xmath20 and for three selected @xmath2 bins .",
    "the measured data ( full markers ) are reflected around midrapidity ( open markers).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    dependences on @xmath21 were so far shown only as mass spectra associated with three different @xmath21 windows , without acceptance correction  @xcite .",
    "we have now obtained acceptance - corrected @xmath21 spectra associated with three different mass windows .",
    "the na60 acceptance relative to @xmath22 as a function of @xmath21 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( left ) . in principle",
    ", the acceptance correction requires a 3-dimensional grid in @xmath23 space .",
    "however , the low populated bins in the phase space corners can introduce large errors once the correction is applied . to overcome this problem ,",
    "the correction is performed in 2-dimensional @xmath24 space , using the measured rapidity distribution as an input .",
    "the latter was determined with an acceptance correction found , in an iterative way , from monte carlo simulations matched to the data in mass and @xmath21 . on the basis of this rapidity distribution ,",
    "0.1 gev/@xmath25 bins in mass and 0.2 gev/@xmath26 bins in @xmath21 were used to determine the remaining 2-dimensional correction .",
    "once corrected , the results were integrated over the three extended mass windows 0.4@xmath17@xmath18@xmath170.6 , 0.6@xmath17@xmath18@xmath170.9 and 1.0@xmath17@xmath18@xmath171.4 .",

    "the rapidity distribution of the central mass window is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( right ) for three different @xmath21 windows .",
    "it is interesting to note that it resembles closely the distribution of inclusive pion production , as measured by na49 for pb - pb .",
    "the results for the acceptance - corrected @xmath2 spectra are summarized in fig .",
    "the errors shown are purely statistical .",
    "systematic errors arise from the acceptance corrections including the rapidity distribution used , the subtraction of the cocktail , and the subtraction of the combinatorial background plus fake matches . for @xmath2@xmath170.5 gev / c ,",
    "the combinatorial background contributes most , ranging from 10 to 25% for semiperipheral up to central . for @xmath2@xmath71 gev / c ,",
    "the statistical errors dominate .",
    "the data show a significant dependence on mass , but hardly on centrality . to bear out the differences in mass more clearly",
    ", the data were summed over the three more central bins and plotted vs. transverse mass @xmath27 in place of @xmath21 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ( left ) .",
    "the inverse slope parameter @xmath28 as determined from differential fits of the @xmath8 spectra with @xmath29 , using a sliding window in @xmath2 , is plotted on the right .",
    "the main features of the results are remarkable and somewhat unexpected . at very low @xmath8 ,",
    "all spectra steepen rather than flatten , as expected from radial flow , equivalent to very small values of @xmath28 ( the @xmath4 resonance , placed just in between the upper two mass windows , _ does flatten _ as expected ) .",
    "moreover , depending on the fit region , @xmath28 covers an unusually large dynamic range .",
    "finally , the largest masses have the steepest @xmath8 spectrum , i.e. the smallest value of @xmath28 everywhere , again contrary to radial flow and to what is usually observed for hadrons .",
    "all this suggests that different mass regions are coupled to basically different emission sources .",
    "the qualitative features of the excess mass spectra shown above are consistent with an interpretation as direct thermal radiation from the fireball , dominated by @xmath0 annihilation .",
    "as explained in detail in @xcite , the excess mass spectra , with _ no _ acceptance correction and no @xmath21 selection , can be approximately interpreted as the spectral function of the intermediate @xmath1 , averaged over momenta and the complete space - time history of the fireball .             as already discussed in the first na60 publications ( see @xcite and earlier ref .",
    "cited ibd . ) , the moving - mass scenario  la brown / rho scaling  @xcite was found to be incompatible with the experimental excess mass spectra . even considering fireball variations within extremes ,",
    "this has basically remained unchanged .",
    "other scenarios , characterized essentially by a broadening of the @xmath1 , have in the meantime been refined  @xcite or newly developed  @xcite .",
    "a summary of the comparison of these latest theoretical results to the excess mass spectrum for the semicentral bin is contained in fig .  [ fig6 ] .",
    "hees / rapp  @xcite have modified the fireball part of the original predictions for in - in in the 2@xmath9 region ( based on  @xcite ) and have now also added 4@xmath9 processes , reflecting vector - axialvector mixing ; the latter makes a strong contribution for @xmath18@xmath71 gev / c@xmath5 .",
    "renk / ruppert  @xcite use the spectral function of eletsky et al . including baryonic effects in the 2@xmath9 region , coupled to a strong partonic contribution which dominates the yield for @xmath18@xmath71 gev / c@xmath5 .",
    "dusling / zahed  @xcite use a chiral virial approach including baryonic interactions , coupled again to some partonic contribution which is on a similar level as the hadronic yield for @xmath18@xmath71 gev / c@xmath5 .",
    "all models achieve a reasonable description of the mass spectrum over the whole mass range , even in absolute terms . for @xmath18@xmath170.5",
    "gev / c@xmath5 , the decisive role played by baryonic interactions in  @xcite is seen in the upper right of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] by switching them off . for @xmath18@xmath71 gev / c@xmath5",
    ", the agreement of all predictions with the data implies a low ( if any ) sensitivity to the dynamics here , equivalent to hadron - parton duality .",
    "the @xmath27 spectra predicted by the models above are compared to the data in fig .",
    "in contrast to the mass spectra , none of the predictions is presently able to provide a satisfactory description of the @xmath8 spectra over their full range .",
    "it seems that the @xmath8 spectra are , in some sense , more sensitive to the dynamics than the mass spectra .",
    "a quantitative understanding of the @xmath8 spectra may thus help to discriminate between the different sources and provide further insight beyond hadron - parton duality ( e.g. different radial flow effects for hadrons and partons ) .",
    "summarizing , the previously measured excess mass spectra and the new acceptance - corrected @xmath2 and @xmath8 spectra present rather strict boundary conditions to theoretical modeling . beyond the @xmath1 spectral",
    "function itself , this may also lead to a better understanding of the continuum part of the spectra .    00",
