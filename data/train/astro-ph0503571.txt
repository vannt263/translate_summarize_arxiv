    "ultrasmall grains spend most of their time at their vibrational ground state during the interval of two photon absorption events (  3 and fig.[fig : temp_spikes ] ; draine & li 2001 ) . in the 1996 south african `` _ cold dust _ ''",
    "symposium , it was heatedly argued that these grains could obtain a vibrational temperature less than the 2.7@xmath2 temperature of the cmb so that they could be detected in absorption against the cmb ( duley & poole 1998 ) .",
    "however , based on detailed modeling of the excitation and de - excitation of these grains , we found that even though these grains do have a large population in the vibrational ground state , nevertheless the vibrational levels are sufficiently excited that the grains would appear in emission against the cmb with brightness temperature @xmath339@xmath2 ( see draine & li 2004b for details ) . + * acknowledgments *   i thank g.j .",

    "<S> we are living in a dusty universe : dust is ubiquitously seen in a wide variety of astrophysical environments , ranging from circumstellar envelopes around cool red giants to supernova ejecta , from diffuse and dense interstellar clouds and star - forming regions to debris disks around main - sequence stars , from comets to interplanetary space to distant galaxies and quasars .    these grains , spanning a wide range of sizes from a few angstroms to a few micrometers , </S>",
    "<S> play a vital role in the evolution of galaxies as an absorber , scatterer , and emitter of electromagnetic radiation , as a driver for the mass loss of evolved stars , as an essential participant in the star and planet formation process , as an efficient catalyst for the formation of h@xmath0 and other simple molecules as well as complex organic molecules which may lead to the origins of life , as a photoelectric heating agent for the interstellar gas , and as an agent shaping the spectral appearance of dusty systems such as protostars , young stellar objects , evolved stars and galaxies .    in this review </S>",
    "<S> i focus on the dust grains in the space between stars ( interstellar dust ) , with particular emphasis on the extinction ( absorption plus scattering ) and emission properties of _ cold _ submicron - sized `` classical '' grains which , in thermal equilibrium with the ambient interstellar radiation field , obtain a steady - state temperature of @xmath11525@xmath2 , _ warm _ nano - sized ( or smaller ) `` ultrasmall '' grains which are , upon absorption of an energetic photon , transiently heated to temperatures as high as a few hundred to over 1000@xmath2 , and the possible existence of a population of _ very cold _ ( @xmath310k ) dust . whether dust grains can really get down to `` temperature '' less than the 2.7@xmath2 cosmic microwave background radiation temperature will also be discussed . </S>",
    "<S> the robustness of the silicate - graphite - pahs interstellar dust model is demonstrated by showing that the infrared emission predicted from this model closely matches that observed for the milky way , the small magellanic cloud , and the ringed sb galaxy ngc7331 .    </S>",
