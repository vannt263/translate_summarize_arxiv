    "the emission from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is typically variable , with faster variability seen at shorter wavelengths .",
    "this variability can be used as a tool to probe the surrounding structures , with reverberation mapping of the broad line region being an established technique .",
    "however , the same techniques can be used to probe the structure of the accretion flow itself .",
    "hard x - ray illumination of the disc should produce a lagged and smeared thermal reprocessing signal .",
    "larger radii in the disc produce lower temperature emission , so this disc reprocessing picture predicts longer lags at longer wavelengths .",
    "such differential lags are now starting to be seen ( sergeev et al .",
    "2005 ; mchardy et al .",
    "2014 ; edelson et al . 2015 ; fausnaugh et al .",
    "2015 ; mchardy et al .",
    "2016 ) confirming qualitatively that we are indeed seeing reprocessing from radially extended , optically thick material , as expected from a disc .    however ,",
    "quantitatively , the picture runs into difficulties .",
    "it has long been known that the implied size - scales are larger by a factor of a few compared to the expected sizes from a shakura - sunyaev disc ( e.g. cackett , horne & winkler 2007 ) .",
    "independent size - scale estimates from microlensing also imply that the optical / uv emission region is larger than expected by a similar factor ( e.g. morgan et al .",
    "yet the optical / uv spectrum shows a strong rise to the blue , and can be fairly well fit by the emission expected from the outer disc regions in a shakura - sunyaev model ( e.g. jin et al . 2012 ; capellupo et al .",
    "2015 ) , though there are discrepancies in detail ( e.g. davis , woo & blaes 2007 ) .    thus qualitatively the disc reprocessing picture appears sound , yet quantitatively it fails to match the data .",
    "this is perhaps not surprising for several reasons .",
    "irradiation can change the structure of the disc e.g. by flaring it , as well as by changing the local heating ( cunningham 1976 ) .",
    "secondly , the spectra of agn are clearly not simply a disc .",
    "the hard x - ray corona itself must be powered by accretion , pointing to a change from a pure shakura - sunyaev disc structure in the inner regions ( e.g. done et al .",
    "there is also the generic additional component seen in agn , the soft x - ray excess , which again points to some change in disc structure which is not captured by the simple shakura - sunyaev equations ( e.g. gierlinski & done 2004 ; porquet et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "here we use the unprecedented swift and hst lightcurves collected by the 2014 campaign on ngc 5548 , which spans 120 days with sampling of 0.5 days , across 9 continuum bands from v to hard x - rays ( edelson et al .",
    "we use these to quantitatively test disc reprocessing models using a full model of illumination and reprocessing , with the aim to reproduce both the spectrum and variability of the source .",
    "we first examine traditional disc reprocessing models and confirm that these can not explain the lag timescales of the optical / uv lightcurves of ngc 5548 .",
    "however , these quantitative models reveal another more fundamental conflict , which is that the uv and optical lightcurves can not be produced by reprocessing of the observed hard x - ray flux . disc reprocessing smears the variability by a similar timescale to the lag .",
    "the uv and optical are lagged by 1 - 2 days , but are much smoother than the hard x - ray lightcurve , with no sign of the rapid 1 - 2 day variability seen in the x - rays ( see also arevalo et al .",
    "the fast hard x - ray variability is not seen by the outer disc , so we conclude that the hard x - rays are not the driver for reprocessing .    instead",
    ", we demonstrate that illumination by the fuv ( represented by the hst lightcurve ) , rather than direct illumination by the hard x - rays , produces a much better match to the observed smoothness of the optical / uv lightcurves of ngc 5548 .",
    "this points to a geometry where the outer disc is shielded from the hard x - rays , so we investigate models where the soft x - ray excess is produced from a moderately thickened disc .",
    "the observed difference between the fuv and soft x - ray lightcurves clearly shows that this is not a single component , so we assume that smaller radii of the thickened disc produce the soft x - ray part of the soft x - ray excess , which is also shielded from the outer disc , while the outer regions produce the fuv which can illuminate the outer thin disc .",
    "however , this still predicts lags which are shorter than observed . increased flaring of the outer disc does not help because these large radii regions with the required long lag times are too cool to contribute significant optical flux due to their large area .",
    "we explore the suggestion that the longer than expected lags come from the contribution of the classic blr ( h@xmath0 line ) to the optical and uv emission ( korista & goad 2001 ) , but this does not work either . since all known components fail , we reverse engineer a geometry which can fit both spectral and variability constraints .",
    "we use the observed optical lags in the different wavelength bands to constrain the flux contributions of reprocessors at different distances and temperatures and hence constrain the area of the reprocessors .",
    "these areas are far too small to be the outer disc , and are more consistent with optically thick clumps lifted above the outer disc .",
    "these clouds are located inside the smallest inferred blr radii ( heii ) , so we propose that these are the extension of the blr clouds to smaller radii / higher densities .",
    "they are too dense to emit substantial line emission and they instead reprocess the illuminating fuv continuum as mostly black body emission .",
    "fundamentally , the time lags give us the wrong answers because the reverberation signal is not from a thin disc illuminated by hard x - rays , but from small clouds on the very inner edge of the blr / outer edge of the disc , illuminated by the fuv emission .",
    "thus we are not probing the size - scale of the thin disc , but the size - scale of the innermost , densest clouds of the blr .",
    "this picture would similarly explain the microlensing results , as the emission from the small dense clumps weights the emissivity to larger size - scales .",
    "for all models we fix @xmath1 ( as used by edelson et al .",
    "2015 , from pancoast et al . 2014 : see also their erratum 2015 ) .",
    "this is similar to the denny et al .",
    "( 2010 ) estimate of @xmath2 , though a factor of @xmath3 smaller than the bentz et al .",
    "( 2010 ) estimate of @xmath4 .",
    "we also fix distance @xmath5mpc , and spin @xmath6 , and assume an inclination angle of @xmath7 .",
    "the unabsorbed , dereddened broadband spectrum of ngc 5548 from summer 2013 is shown in mehdipour et al .",
    "the x - ray flux is very hard , with photon index @xmath8 , and the x - rays dominate the energy output of the source , peaking in @xmath9 at @xmath10  ergs  @xmath11  s@xmath12 at 100  kev .",
    "the simultaneous optical / uv spectrum looks similar to that expected from an outer thin disc ( though is shape is subtly different : mehdipour et al .",
    "the flux in uvw1 ( at around 5  ev ) has @xmath13  ergs  @xmath11  s@xmath12 .",
    "we use the optxagnf model in xspec to find reasonable physical parameters for the accretion flow .",
    "this assumes that the mass accretion rate is constant with radius , with fully relativistic novikov - thorne emissivity per unit area , @xmath14 , with dimensionless radius @xmath15 for @xmath16 , but that this energy is dissipated in a ( colour temperature corrected ) disc only down to some radius @xmath17 , with the remainder split between powering a soft x - ray excess component and the hard x - ray coronal emission .",
    "this code calculates the angle averaged spectrum , so we boost the normalisation by a factor @xmath18 to roughly account for our assumed inclination angle .",
    "we find that we can match the uvw1 and x - ray flux for @xmath19 with @xmath20 .",
    "we assume that all the power within @xmath20 goes to make the hard x - ray corona ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "this does not necessarily mean that the optically thick , geometrically thin disk itself is not present , only that the accretion power is not dissipated within this structure ( svensson & zdziarski 1994 ; petrucci et al 2010 ) .",
    "however , there is additional information in the hard x - ray spectrum which does point to this conclusion .",
    "an optically thick disc can not be present underneath an isotropically emitting corona in this object , as such a disc will intercept around half of the hard x - ray flux , giving a strong compton hump which is not present in the nustar data ( see spectrum in mehdipour et al.2015 and ursini et al .",
    "thermalisation of the non - reflected emission also produces too many seed photons for the x - ray source to remain hard ( haardt & maraschi 1991 ; 1993 ; stern et al .",
    "1995 ; malzac et al . 2005 ; petrucci et al .",
    "together , these imply that either the x - ray source is very anisotropic , or the disc truly truncates for sources with hard x - ray spectra .",
    "black hole binaries similarly show hard x - ray spectra and small compton hump in their low / hard state , but here there are clear limits on the possible anisotropy from comparing sources with different binary inclination angles ( heil , uttley & klein - wolt 2015 ) .",
    "this argues strongly for true truncation of the accretion disc , as does the currently popular lense - thirring precession model for the origin of the low frequency qpo s seen in high inclination binary systems ( ingram , done & fragile 2009 ) .",
    "hence we assume the disc is truly truncated in these low luminosity agn ( see also petrucci et al .",
    "2013 ; noda 2016 ) .",
    "the irradiation pattern strongly depends on the relative geometry of the hard x - ray source and disc . in the black hole binaries",
    ", there is evidence from the complex pattern of energy dependent lags that the hard x - ray source is somewhat radially extended ( kotov , churazov & gilfanov 2001 ; ingram & done 2012 ) , as is also expected if it is some form of hot , radiatively inefficient accretion flow such as an advection dominated accretion flow ( narayan & yi 1995 ) .",
    "we assume that the extended hard x - ray source has volume emissivity @xmath22 and neglect light - bending and red / blueshifts to work out the irradiating flux as in the appendix of zycki et al ( 1999 ) , i.e. @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the distance from the hard x - ray source to the disc surface element , @xmath25 is the angle between the source and normal to the disc , and @xmath26 is the fraction of coronal hard x - ray luminosity , @xmath27 which thermalises .",
    "we set @xmath28 in this section in order to see the maximum irradiation flux .",
    "we then assume that @xmath29 and model the resulting optically thick disc emission at this radius as a ( colour temperature corrected ) blackbody .",
    "however , the colour temperature correction makes very little difference for the black hole mass , mass accretion rate and @xmath17 used here , as the disc peaks at 5.5  ev ( @xmath30 ) so is too cool for the colour temperature correction to be significant .",
    "[ cols= \" < \" , ]     separating the variability of the source into its different components and constraining the contribution of these components to different bands , has allowed us to constrain the spectra of the reprocessors . assuming these reprocessors are black body emitters , allows us to constrain their temperature and covering fraction .",
    "the temperature of the reprocessors increases as their radial distance decreases , as expected .",
    "the covering fraction of the reprocessors is tiny  just @xmath31 for the reprocessor at @xmath32ld .",
    "this further underlines why these reprocessors can not be the disc , which has a huge area at these radii .",
    "this covering fraction can be interpreted as a scale - height ( @xmath33 ) above the disc , assuming @xmath34 for material launched from the plane of the disc . in which case , the scale - heights for the reprocessors located between @xmath32 and @xmath35ld range from @xmath31  @xmath36 , i.e. @xmath37ld .",
    "kollatschny & zetzl ( 2013 ) find that the blr of ngc 5548 has a wedge - shaped disc - wind - like structure , with wind height increasing with increasing radius .",
    "they find that the inner edge of the blr , where the he line is emitted , is located at a radius of @xmath38ld with a height above the midplain of @xmath39ld .",
    "these black body reprocessors are therefore consistent with small - area material located just inside the inner edge of the broad line emitting region .",
    "potentially they are clumps originating in a dust - driven disc wind just like the broad line emitting clouds ( czerny et al .",
    "2015 ) , except that at these very small radii the clouds are too dense to emit broad lines so instead reprocess the illuminating flux as thermal emission .",
    "fig.[fig9 ] summarises our proposed geometry for ngc 5548 .",
    "we have built a full disc reprocessing model in an attempt to simulate the simultaneous multi - wavelength lightcurve data presented by edelson et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , assuming the uv / optical variability seen in ngc 5548 is due to reprocessing of higher energy radiation by the accretion disc .",
    "this higher energy radiation is traditionally assumed to be the hard x - ray power law , produced at small accretion flow radii .",
    "we find that reprocessing of the hard x - rays by a standard accretion disc can not replicate the observed uv / optical lightcurves or their lags with respect to the illuminating x - rays .",
    "specifically the simulated lightcurves reproduce too much of the hard x - ray high frequency power and the light travel lag times are too short .    one obvious answer to increase the amount of smoothing and increase the light travel lag times would appear to be to make the accretion disc larger .",
    "the first reason this is not an option is a constraint from the spectral energy distribution of ngc 5548 . we have limited the size of our model accretion disc to the self - gravity radius .",
    "we could relax this condition and allow the disc to extend to larger radii , but this would cause the disc spectrum to extend to lower energies .",
    "by contrast , the observed spectrum of ngc 5548 , as shown by mehdipour et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , clearly does not show such emission .",
    "the peak uv / optical emission occurs in the uvw1 bandpass and the emission below this energy rapidly drops off . with an outer disc radius at the self - gravity radius , we already slightly overpredict the lowest energy fluxes . however , we modelled this directly , and find that the radii required to smooth the reprocessed hard x - ray lightcurve to a level matching the data is so large that the resulting lag times are too long to be compatible with the observations .",
    "we are then driven to a scenario where the reprocessor can not directly see the hard x - rays .",
    "this requires some source of material with sufficient scale - height that it can block the optical emitting regions view of the hard x - rays .",
    "the obvious candidate for this is the soft excess component .",
    "there is much debate over the physical origin of the soft excess emission .",
    "we envisage a scenario where it is produced in an optically thick comptonising region at larger radii than the central hard x - rays .",
    "uv / fuv emission produced in this region lifts material out of the plane of the accretion flow , where it is illuminated by the hard x - ray flux , which overionises the material .",
    "the resultant loss of uv opacity means it falls back down , resulting in a region with scale - height sufficient to prevent the hard x - rays illuminating the outer parts of the accretion flow .",
    "the soft x - ray emission could come from the inner radii of this region , while the lowest energy fuv emission could come from its largest radii .",
    "one problem with complete shielding is that the observed fuv and hard x - ray lightcurves _ are _ significantly correlated , though the correlation is quite poor .",
    "one possibility to incorporate some feedback between the two regions is if hard x - rays illuminate the inner edge of the soft excess region and these fluctuations then dissipate outwards through the soft excess until they reach the outer fuv emitting regions , which then illuminate the disc .",
    "it is then dissipation of the hard x - ray fluctuations through the soft excess component that causes the loss of high frequency power , not light travel time smoothing .",
    "however , this dissipation process has to be extremely fast , though the viscous timescale in the soft x - ray excess section of the disc will be faster than in a standard shakura - sunyaev disc .",
    "we show that a model where the fuv emission ( represented by the hubble band lightcurve ) provides the illumination gives a much better match to the shape of the observed optical lightcurves .",
    "however , our model response is still too fast at the longest wavelengths .",
    "the observed v band lag in ngc 5548 is @xmath38d behind the fuv emission , which requires the reprocessed v band flux to be emitted at radii @xmath40 for this source .",
    "however disc annuli at these large radii are too cool to contribute significant flux to the v band , which is instead dominated by hotter emission from smaller disc radii with shorter lag times .",
    "the heating effect of the illuminating flux makes very little difference , as large disc annuli have enormous area .",
    "the illuminating flux is simply spread over too large an area , so barely changes the temperature of the annulus and certainly can not heat the annulus enough for it to contribute significant v band flux . in order for the illuminating flux to heat a reprocessor at these large radii enough to contribute to the v band",
    "requires the reprocessor to have a small area .",
    "we use the uv / optical lightcurves and cross correlation functions to constrain the amount of reprocessed flux with different lag times in the uvw1 and v bands and , assuming this reprocessed flux is black body emission , we then estimated the temperatures and covering factors of the black body reprocessors at different radii . for black body reprocessors located between @xmath41ld from the illuminating fuv",
    ", we derive covering factors from @xmath42 , corresponding to a scale - height of @xmath43ld .",
    "these tiny covering factors rule out the disc as the source of the reprocessed emission and are instead consistent with clumps of material just inside the blr .",
    "we suggest they may be optically thick blr clouds at very small radii that are too dense to emit via line emission so instead reprocess the fuv flux as thermal blackbody emission .",
    "we conclude that the uv / optical lightcurves of ngc 5548 are not consistent with reprocessing of the hard x - rays by an accretion disc , but can instead be explained by reprocessing of the fuv emission by optically thick broad line region clouds .",
    "this provides an additional source of ( mostly ) continuum emission , though it may not completely thermalise ( h. netzer & m. mehdipour , private communication ) .",
    "the model still requires the presence of a standard outer shakura - sunyaev accretion disc , but this is a mostly constant component .",
    "the additional variable optical / uv emission component adds to this disc emission , and starts to dominate over the disc emission in the v band .",
    "this could explain why the spectra of quasars are in general slightly redder than expected from standard disc models ( davis , woo & blaes 2007 ) , as well as explaining the microlensing size - scale results ( morgan et al .",
    "2010 ) and perhaps also the additional red component required in decomposition of the spectral variability of other individual well studied objects such as 3c273 ( the @xmath44 component in fig.5 of soldi et al . 2008 ) .    ultimately , whatever the origin of the lags in ngc 5548 , the datasets now available contain much more information than is encapsulated in a single lag time measurement .",
    "we urge full spectral  timing modelling of these data in order to extract all the new physical information on the structure and geometry of the accretion flow which is now within reach .",
