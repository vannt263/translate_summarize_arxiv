    "it is derived directly from qcd and the basic assumptions ( convergence of the expansion in @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) can be simply tested by comparing experiment and theory for different quantities ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the lifetime ratio of two heavy mesons reads @xmath16 if one neglects small isospin or su(3 ) violating effects one has no @xmath10 corrections these effects are expected to be of the order of @xmath17 . ] and a deviation of the lifetime ratio from one starts at order @xmath11 . for the ratio @xmath18 the leading term",
