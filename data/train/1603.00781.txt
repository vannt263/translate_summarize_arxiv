    "recently , a complex short pulse ( csp ) equation  @xcite @xmath2was proposed as an improvement for the short pulse ( sp ) equation @xmath3proposed by schfer and wayne  @xcite to describe the propagation of ultra - short optical pulses in nonlinear media .",
    "in contrast with a real - valued function for @xmath4 in eq.([spe ] ) , @xmath5 in eq.([csp ] ) is a complex - valued function . since the complex - valued function can contain the information of both amplitude and phase , it is more appropriate for the description of the optical waves  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the csp equation ( [ csp ] ) is integrable in the sense that it admits a lax pair and multi - soliton solutions  @xcite in contrast with no physical interpretation for one - soliton solution ( loop soliton ) to the sp equation  @xcite , the one - soliton solution for the csp equation is an envelope soliton with a few optical cycles  @xcite . besides the envelop soliton solution",
    ", the csp equation possesses rogue wave solution of any order in analogue to the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation  @xcite .",
    "the csp equation can be viewed as an analogue of the nls equation in the ultra - short regime when the width of optical pulse is of the order @xmath6 .",
    "it is well known that the nls equation describes the evolution of slowly varying wave packets waves in weakly nonlinear dispersive media under quasi - monochromatic assumption , which has been very successful in many applications such as nonlinear optics and water waves  @xcite . however , as the width of optical pulse is in the order of femtosecond ( @xmath7 s ) , then the width of spectrum of this ultra - short pulses is approximately of the order @xmath8 , the monochromatic assumption to derive the nls equation is not valid  @xcite .",
    "description of ultra - short pulses requires a modification of standard slow varying envelope models based on the nls equation . that is the motivation for the study of the short pulse equation , the csp equation and their coupled models .",
    "the csp equation is mathematically related to a two - component short pulse ( 2-sp ) equation proposed by dimakis and mller - hoissen  @xcite and matsuno  @xcite independently .",
    "if we take @xmath9 and @xmath10 , then the 2-sp equation in @xcite becomes the csp equation .",
    "we showed that the csp equation can be derived from the motion of space curves and provide an alternative multi - soliton solution in terms of determinant based on the kp hierarchy reduction technique  @xcite .",
    "the multi - breather and higher order rogue wave solutions to the csp equation were constructed by the darboux transformation method in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we have constructed integrable semi - discrete csp equation and apply it as a self - adaptive moving mesh method for the numerical simulations of the csp equation  @xcite . since the nls equation has the focusing and defocusing cases , which admits the bright and dark type soliton solutions , respectively .",
    "it is natural that the csp equation can also have the focusing and defocusing type , which may be proposed as @xmath11 where @xmath12 represents the focusing case , and @xmath13 stands for the defocusing case .",
    "it turns out that this is indeed the case .",
    "same as the focusing csp equation discussed in @xcite , the defocusing csp equation can also occur in nonlinear optics when ultra - short pulses propagate in a nonlinear media of defocusing type  @xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we will study the defocusing csp equation @xmath14 both geometrically and algebraically .",
    "the goal of the present paper is twofold .",
    "the one is to investigate the geometric meaning of the defocusing csp equation , especially , its connection with the motion of space curves .",
    "the other is to find out how these equations are reduced from the extended kp hierarchy and to construct their @xmath1-soliton solutions .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we firstly establish the connection between the motions of space curves in minkowski space @xmath0 and the defocusing csp equation via a hodograph ( reciprocal ) transformation .",
    "the lax pair is constructed geometrically to assure the integrability of the defocusing csp equation .",
    "then , starting from the fundamental forms of the surfaces embedded in @xmath15 and @xmath0 , the focusing and defocusing complex coupled dispersionless ( ccd ) system are derived , respectively .",
    "the curve flows are also made clear . in section 3 , starting from a set of bilinear equations for the single - component extended kp hierarchy , as well as their tau functions , we deduce the defocusing csp equation by the kp hierarchy reduction method . meanwhile , as a by - product , the @xmath1-dark soliton solution is obtained .",
    "section 4 is devoted to concluding remarks .",
    "it has been known for several decades that there are deep connections between the differential geometry and the theory of integrable systems , and various integrable differential or difference equations arise from either curve dynamics or surfaces .",
    "for example , the sine - gordon ( sg ) equation , the modified kdv ( mkdv ) equation and the nls equation from the compatibility conditions of the motion of either plane or space curves , as shown by many researchers including lamb and hasimoto  @xcite . on the other hand , a more broad class of soliton equations including the ones mentioned above",
    "can also be derived from the theory of surfaces ( see the pioneer work in @xcite and also the book by roger and schief  @xcite ) . in this section , a link between the csp equation and the motion of curves , as well as surfaces , in three - dimensional space is established .      in the study of curve flows of soliton equations , it has shown in the past that , very often , we have to turn from the euclidean space to minkowski space when we attempt to find the links between some soliton equations such as the defocusing nls equation  @xcite .",
    "this is also the case when we attempt to establish a link of the defocusing csp equation ( [ dcsp ] ) to the motion of space curves , as will be shown in this subsection .",
    "firstly , noting that the csp equation ( [ gcsp ] ) admits the following conservative law @xmath16 which allows us to define a hodograph ( reciprocal ) transformation @xmath17 where @xmath18 . by doing so",
    ", one can obtain the differential conversion formula between @xmath19 and @xmath20 @xmath21 or @xmath22 therefore , the csp equation ( [ gcsp ] ) is converted into @xmath23 while the conservative form of the csp ( [ gcsp_conv ] ) @xmath24    we remark here that equations ( [ ccda ] ) and ( [ ccdb ] ) constitute a coupled nonlinear system . when @xmath25 is viewed as a spatial variable , and @xmath26 as a temporal variable , the system for @xmath12 is called the focusing complex coupled dispersionless ( ccd ) system , which has been studied in @xcite and related references .",
    "for some reason , the system ( [ ccda ] ) and ( [ ccdb ] ) for @xmath13 has been overlooked in the past and its soliton solution has not been studied yet . in what follows",
    ", we reformulate the system ( [ ccda ] ) and ( [ ccdb ] ) with @xmath13 geometrically in order to make clear the geometric interpretation of the defocusing csp equation ( [ dcsp ] ) .",
    "it can be easily checked that the quantity @xmath27 is independent of @xmath26 , thus , we can assume @xmath28 without loss of generality . under this case ,",
    "if we assume @xmath29 , the system can be simplified into a single equation @xmath30 which is called the complex sine - gordon equation for @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "( [ csg_general ] ) is also a reduction of a so - called vector sine - gordon equation  @xcite .",
    "if @xmath29 is a real - valued function , the complex sine - gordon equation ( [ csg_general ] ) with @xmath12 leads to the sine - gordon equation @xmath31 by setting @xmath32 and @xmath33 . in the case of @xmath13 ,",
    "if @xmath29 is a real - valued function , we obtain the sinh - gordon equation @xmath34 from ( [ csg_general ] ) by setting @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "thus we can call ( [ csg_general ] ) the complex sine - gordon equation for @xmath12 and complex sinh - gordon equation for @xmath13 .",
    "it was pointed out in @xcite that the focusing ccd system is linked to the focusing csp equation by a hodograph ( reciprocal ) transformation , by which the lax pair of the focusing csp equation was established .",
    "both the generalized cd equation and the focusing csp equation were interpreted as the motion of space curve in euclidean space  @xcite . in what follows",
    ", we proceed to the study for the relationship between the defocusing csp equation ( [ dcsp ] ) and the motion of space curves . to this end",
    ", we need to turn to consider the motion of curves which lies in a surface @xmath37 embedded in a minkowski space @xmath0 equipped with a lorentz metric @xmath38 . for any @xmath39 , @xmath40 in @xmath0 ,",
    "the scalar product is defined as @xmath41 and the vector product is defined as @xmath42 . moreover",
    ", we use the darboux frame @xmath43 attached to a curve @xmath44 parameterized by the arc - length : @xmath45where @xmath26 stands for the arc length and @xmath25 represents the time . the general equation ( the darboux equation ) for the orthogonal triad @xmath43 along the curve takes the form @xmath46 _ { y}=\\left [ \\begin{array}{ccc } 0 & \\kappa _ { g } & \\kappa _ { n } \\\\",

    "thus the link of the defocusing ccd system to the motion of space curves in minkowski space @xmath0 is established .",
    "recall the lie group @xmath60where @xmath61 , and the lie algebra @xmath62we choose the basis of @xmath63 as @xmath64 which satisfies the communication relation @xmath65=\\mathrm{\\tilde{e}}_{3}\\ , , \\quad [ \\mathrm{\\tilde{e}}_{2},\\mathrm{\\tilde{e}}_{3}]=-\\mathrm{\\tilde{e}}_{1}\\ , , \\quad [ \\mathrm{\\tilde{e}}_{3 } , \\mathrm{\\tilde{e}}_{1}]=\\mathrm{\\tilde{e}}_{2}\\,.\\ ] ] we identify @xmath0 as @xmath63 by @xmath66 , then @xmath67 on the other hand , recall the lie group @xmath68where @xmath69 , and the lie algebra @xmath70we choose the basis of @xmath71 as @xmath72 which satisfies the communication relation @xmath73=\\mathrm{\\tilde{l}}_{3}\\ , , \\quad [ \\mathrm{\\tilde{l}}_{2},\\mathrm{\\tilde{l}}_{3}]=-\\mathrm{\\tilde{l}}_{2}\\ , , \\quad [ \\mathrm{\\tilde{l}}_{3 } , \\mathrm{\\tilde{l}}_{1}]=\\mathrm{\\tilde{l}}_{2}\\,.\\ ] ] we identify @xmath0 as @xmath71 by @xmath74 .",
    "obviously , there is an isomorphism between the lie algebras @xmath63 and @xmath71 which is reflected by the correspondence @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) . based on this fact , we can easily construct the lax pair for the defocusing ccd system geometrically as follows @xmath77where @xmath78@xmath79 by setting @xmath80 .",
    "the above lax pair is consistent with the one used for constructing the darboux transformation of the defocusing ccd system  @xcite .",
    "the lax pair found geometrically here shows that the ccd system is simply the negative order of the akns hierarchy  @xcite .",
    "it is known that there exists a relationship between the frenet - serret frame and the darboux frame in 3-dimensional euclidean space @xmath15 : @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the rotation angle in the tangent plane from the frenet - serret frame to the darboux frame .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath83 the above formula can be viewed as hasimoto transformation for the case of the ccd system .",
    "the reciprocal link between the ccd system and the csp equation can be defined geometrically .",

    "<S> in the present paper , we study the defocusing complex short pulse ( csp ) equations both geometrically and algebraically . from the geometric point of view </S>",
    "<S> , we establish a link of the complex coupled dispersionless ( ccd ) system with the motion of space curves in minkowski space @xmath0 , then with the defocusing csp equation via a hodograph ( reciprocal ) transformation , the lax pair is constructed naturally for the defocusing csp equation . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the ccd system of both the focusing and defocusing types can be derived from the fundamental forms of surfaces such that their curve flows are formulated . </S>",
    "<S> in the second part of the paper , we derive the the defocusing csp equation from the single - component extended kp hierarchy by the reduction method . as a by - product , the @xmath1-dark soliton solution for the defocusing csp equation in the form of determinants for these equations is provided . </S>"
