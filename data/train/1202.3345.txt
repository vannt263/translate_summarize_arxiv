    ", convective interior is required @xcite .",
    "thus , even temperature - pressure profiles which dissipate most of the heat superficially ( @xmath84 ) will still act to keep the exoplanet inflated because the deep isotherm corresponds to a non - negligible amount of electrical conductivity .",
    "we conclude that the variations in the absorption opacities ( @xmath52 ) and albedo ( @xmath31 ) , as well as the cloud / haze properties , naturally account for a range of values of the ohmic power dissipated at depth ( @xmath73 bar ) .",
    "if ohmic dissipation is the dominant mechanism for inflating hot jupiters , then this implies a scatter in the measured radii at a given strength of stellar irradiation .",
    "we have developed models which elucidate the link between atmospheric scattering , absorption and ohmic dissipation in hot jupiters at a given strength of stellar irradiation .",
    "our study is complimentary to that of @xcite , who developed analytical scaling laws for the variation of magnetic drag and ohmic dissipation with the strength of stellar irradiation , while we have explored the effects of stellar irradiation on heat redistribution and energy dissipation ( including ohmic dissipation ) , via numerical simulations , in a companion paper @xcite .",
    "our simplifying assumption for the atmospheric dynamics is corroborated by the results of these simulations .",
    "furthermore , our work is also complimentary to that of @xcite , who adopted a two - zone model consisting of an isothermal envelope ( i.e. , a constant temperature - pressure profile ) surrounding an isentropic core .",
    "the variety of temperature - pressure profiles used in the present study highlights the importance of atmospheric effects on the evolution of a hot jupiter , as the atmosphere provides a boundary condition for the evolution of the interior ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we have not examined effects stemming from the evolution of a hot jupiter , which we will now discuss .",
    "firstly , an increased atmospheric opacity slows down the gravitational contraction and internal cooling of the exoplanet , as the flux emanated scales inversely with the opacity @xcite .",
    "such a retardation or suspension of the cooling has been studied by @xcite , who showed that ohmic dissipation can not effectively re - inflate a hot jupiter after it has cooled .",
    "secondly , an enhanced metallicity  whether in the form of a core or distributed throughout the envelope  implies an enhanced surface gravity and a smaller radius of the exoplanet @xcite . in turn , these effects imply that the amount of dissipation required to explain an observed radius may be orders of magnitude larger compared to a situation with lower metallicity @xcite . in other words ,",
    "a hot jupiter possessing a core or a metal - enriched atmosphere tends to be less inflated , all else being equal .",
    "thirdly , the presence of a temperature inversion itself will lead to smaller radii purely as an evolutionary effect @xcite .",
    "all of these evolutionary effects will contribute to the scatter in the measured radii of hot jupiters at a given strength of stellar irradiation .",
    "the variations in atmospheric opacity are manifested in other observable ways . at a basic level ,",
    "hot jovian atmospheres are characterized by two time scales , namely the radiative ( @xmath85 ) and advective ( @xmath18 ) time scales @xcite .",
    "it is a generic statement that the radiative time scale @xcite , @xmath86 increases with depth or pressure , such that the atmosphere is dominated by advection at large pressures .",
    "( the specific heat capacity at constant pressure is denoted by @xmath87 ; its value is 14550.4 j k@xmath1 kg@xmath1 for @xmath60 and @xmath88 . ) at the top of the atmosphere ( @xmath89 mbar ) , we have @xmath90 such that the atmosphere is predominantly radiative .",
    "if starlight is mostly deposited at the top of the atmosphere , then heat redistribution from the day- to the night - side hemisphere is inefficient ; if it is deposited mostly at depth , then heat redistribution becomes efficient .     and",
    "for three values of the bond albedo @xmath71 and 0.9 .",
    "the broadband , infrared absorption opacity is fixed at @xmath49 @xmath50 g@xmath1 . the atmosphere becomes more radiative ( or less advective ) as @xmath91 increases . ]    in the presence of scattering , starlight is predominantly absorbed at the photon deposition depth @xcite , @xmath92 it is thus plausible to evaluate @xmath91 at @xmath93 .",
    "figure [ fig : ratio ] shows that @xmath91 is in general an increasing function of @xmath52 . for a fixed broadband , infrared absorption opacity @xmath47 , an increasing value of @xmath52 corresponds to an increasing value of the broadband , optical absorption opacity @xmath46 and thus a decreasing value of @xmath94 . at a given value of @xmath52 ,",
    "increasing the bond albedo @xmath31 also decreases @xmath94 , since the overall penetration depth of an optical stellar photon , in the vertical direction , decreases when scattering is present .",
    "as the photon deposition depth shifts to higher altitudes , it samples an increasingly radiative part of the atmosphere  advection becomes more sluggish and heat redistribution becomes less efficient . the angular shift of the peak , from the substellar point , of the photospheric infrared flux emanating from the hot jupiter  known as the  hotspot offset \"  is a proxy for the efficiency of heat redistribution , with smaller shifts corresponding to less efficient redistribution .",
    "it is thus natural to expect that  all other things being equal ( e.g. , @xmath95 , @xmath47 )  hot jovian atmospheres possessing temperature inversions , at a given strength of stellar irradiation , will have less efficient heat redistribution and a higher day- to night - side flux contrast , an expectation which has been corroborated by the atmospheric circulation simulations of @xcite . while these simulations do not include scattering in the optical , we expect atmospheres with non - zero albedos to produce a similar effect .",
    "ultimately , stellar irradiation remains the main driver of heat redistribution and energy dissipation with opacity effects playing a secondary role @xcite .",
    "collectively , the opacity effects ( absorption and scattering ) we have discussed , which may be attributed to variations in the metallicity and/or cloud / haze properties , as well as expected variations in the magnetic field strength , naturally introduce a scatter to the measured radii of hot jupiters at a given strength of stellar irradiation _ if _ ohmic dissipation is the dominant mechanism for maintaining radius inflation .",
    "furthermore , the evolutionary effects we discussed in  [ subsect : evo ] will also contribute a scatter to the measured radii and it remains to be determined which set of effects provides the dominant source of scatter .",
    "future multi - wavelength measurements of thermal phase curves , from a larger sample of hot jupiters , will disentangle these effects .",
