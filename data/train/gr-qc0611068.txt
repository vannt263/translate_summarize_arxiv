    "recently theories of higher - order gravity have become a matter of intensive investigations . some of them are motivated by string theory @xcite , other proposals have been put forward in order to explain present accelerated expansion of the universe ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "one of the main features of these theories is the fact that they generally lead to equations of motion which contain higher - order derivatives . in @xmath0 dimensions",
    "all higher - curvature terms in lagrangian which keep the equations of motion to be the same order differential equations as in general relativity vanish @xcite . in string gravity",
    "the second order correction contains dilaton scalar field in addition to the gravity sector .",
    "these corrections has a particular structure ( a product of gauss  bonnet term and a function of a dilaton field ) which prevents the resulting equations of motion from being of higher - order equation .",
    "however , these equations become higher - derivative starting from the 3-d order corrections ( see , for example , @xcite . )    as the number of time derivatives in the equations of motions increases in comparison with the situation in classical general relativity , the dimensionality of the phase space of the corresponding dynamical system increases as well .",
    "this may result in a dynamical behavior qualitatively different from that known in gr : some important gr solutions can loose their stability ( this effect from a general point of view have been described in @xcite ) .",
    "though higher - derivative terms may be small on classical solution , perturbations from higher - order corrections can grow in direction of `` additional '' dimensions of the phase space , and a point which is stable in gr may become unstable in higher - order theory .",
    "this situation has already been described in 4-th order string gravity for schwarzschild @xcite and de sitter solutions @xcite , as well as in cosmological scenarios with vacuum polarization @xcite .",
    "the other proposal of this type is so called modified gravity with corrections in the form of function of the curvature @xmath3 @xcite which is also not free from instabilities @xcite ( see , however , @xcite and recent rewiews @xcite ) .    recent understanding that modern string theories may admit many ( actually , _ very _ many ) solutions in which 4-d part is the ( metastable ) de sitter space - time with a positive effective cosmological constant ( @xcite and many following papers ) renew interest in the investigation of the stability of de sitter solutions in gravity theories containing higher order powers of the riemann tensor in their effective lagrangian .",
    "these terms were long known to arise from quantum - gravitational corrections to the einstein gravity ( either the vacuum one , or interacting with matter quantum fields ) .",
    "presumably , some of them may remain in the string theory in spite of many cancellations due to its numerous symmetries .",
    "many particular forms of second order curvature terms have been studied in connection to possible instabilities induced by them @xcite .",
    "this work have been also extended to @xmath4 gravity @xcite . in the present paper we study stability of de sitter solution with respect to second order curvature corrections in their general form .",
    "a general form of second order curvature corrections is    @xmath5    however , in @xmath0 dimensions the gauss - bonnet term @xmath6 does not contribute to equations of motion , and , then , we can rewrite ( 1 ) in the form    @xmath7    introducing @xmath8 , @xmath9 we get the following action for the theory with a cosmological constant term @xmath10    for the friedmann - robertson - walker metrics @xmath11 we have @xmath12,\\ ] ] @xmath13.\\ ] ]    varying the action ( 3 ) with respect to @xmath14 and setting @xmath15 we obtain the following analog of friedmann equation ( we denote @xmath16 ) : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the hubble parameter .    note that the friedmann equations , being algebraic in gr , becomes a differential one in the theory with second order curvature corrections when @xmath19 . in the @xmath20 case",
    "the friedmann equation does not change at all , and we exclude this case from the further analysis .    for stability studies this equation should be written in the form of a system of two first order equations :    @xmath21    the form of de sitter solution ( @xmath22,@xmath23 ) give us the equations for corresponding stable points : @xmath24 its solution is @xmath25 .",
    "it is remarkable , that this de sitter solution is exactly the same as in the pure gr , so higher - order corrections in the theory under investigation do not shift the location of the fixed point .",
    "however , its stability can be affected by the higher - order terms .",
    "linearizing ( [ 6 ] ) we obtain    @xmath26    where @xmath27 @xmath28    two eigenvalues of this system are @xmath29.\\ ] ]    for stability of the solution it is necessary that both eigenvalues have negative real parts . substituting the de sitter solution",
    "we get that in a stable point @xmath30 .    as @xmath31 in an expanding universe , negativity of eigenvalues requires @xmath32 .",
    "on the other hand , we have from ( 7 ) that in the de sitter point @xmath33 which means that the condition for stability of the de sitter solution is @xmath34 .    in is possible to consider this result from a different point of view . instead of riemann tensor",
    ", we can express second order corrections through weil tensor @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the dimensionality of space - time and the curvature scalar :    @xmath37    where @xmath38 and    @xmath39 .",
    "the weil tensor vanishes on the friedmann metrics , and the general quadratic corrections reduce to the @xmath40-term with the known result : the de sitter solution is stable if the coefficient before @xmath40-term in ( 8) is positive .",
    "it is instructive to compare this result with the situation in higher dimensional theory , where the gauss - bonnet term does contribute to dynamical equations . to illustrate importance of this property",
    ", we consider the theory with second order curvature corrections , which we write down in the form    @xmath41    as usual , @xmath42 on the friedmann metrics , and we have two independent parameters of the theory @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",

    "the de sitter fixed points can be found from the equation @xmath52    and have the form @xmath53    comparing these results with those obtained in sec.2 we can see two important differences from the previously studied case of @xmath0 dimensions :    * the de sitter points are shifted in comparison with classical point @xmath54 .",
    "it happens due to the first term in eq.([24 ] ) which vanishes in @xmath55 dimensions .",
    "* there are _ two _ different de sitter solutions , corresponding to two positive roots of ( [ 25 ] ) .",
    "each of them has its own zone of existence , so depending on @xmath43 and @xmath44 we can have two or one de sitter solutions , or the situation when de sitter solutions are absent .",
    "the point with @xmath56 sign in ( [ 25 ] ) has a regular behavior for @xmath57 , @xmath58 ( it tends to unperturbed de sitter solution ) , the behavior of the point with @xmath59 sign is singular .",
    "the latter point can not be an analog of any de sitter point , existing in the pure gr , and exists even in the case of @xmath60 .    for stability analysis we should rewrite ( [ 23 ] ) in the form of dynamical system ( 7 ) .",
    "using the same notations as in the previous section , we get @xmath61 and , for the same reason , the condition for de sitter stability is equivalent to negativity of @xmath62 .",
    "the eq.([23 ] ) gives @xmath63}[2(n-1)(n-2)h + b\\{4(n-1)^2(n-4)h^3\\\\ \\\\+4n(n-1)^2\\dot h h\\}+c\\{4n(n-1)^2(n-4)h^3 + 16(n-1)^3\\dot hh\\ } ] .",
    "\\end{array}\\ ] ]    in the de sitter point we get @xmath64    we get that stability conditions depend on the sign of the combination @xmath65 .",
    "if it is positive , the regular de sitter point ( if exists ) is always stable , while the singular de sitter point is always unstable , independently of @xmath66 . if it is negative , the regular point is unstable , and the singular point is stable .",
    "the conditions for existence of these de sitter points can be easily derived from ( 15 ) .",
    "two conditions which should be satisfied are : @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",

    "we restrict ourself by this special form for simplicity . we show that even in this less general case we have additional restrictions for stability conditions of de sitter solution .",
