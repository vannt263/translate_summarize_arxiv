    "the hadron transverse momentum spectrum measured by the rhic experiments @xcite is one of the most accessible distributions carrying information about the high density nuclear environment . at forward rapidities , the transverse momentum distribution for hadrons presents results compatible with the color glass condensate ( cgc ) description of the saturated regime at high energies @xcite .",
    "these results are investigated through a nuclear modification ratio , which relates @xmath6 and @xmath1 collisions .",
    "it is well known that the transverse momentum dependence of this ratio shows a pronounced cronin peak at central rapidity , which is suppressed at forward ones . for central rapidities",
    "the cronin peak is due to the multiple scatterings of the projectile constituents with the dense target . at large rapidities the cronin peak suppression",
    "is understood as a signal of the saturation phenomena intrinsic of the color glass condensate ( cgc ) . however , at backward rapidities , the recently measured hadron nuclear modification ratio shows a pronounced peak @xcite , which should be due to final states interactions .    in this work the dilepton production at high energies in the backward rapidity region",
    "is investigated in the proton - nucleus and proton - proton collisions .",
    "the analysis at forward rapidities was already done @xcite and the results show that the dilepton is also a suitable observable to investigate the color glass condensate . here",
    ", the interest to explore the backward region in the dilepton sector relies on the study of the nuclear effects at large and small @xmath3 and on the comparison with the cronin effect in this region . in this kinematical region ,",
    "the nucleus interacts by means of large bjorken @xmath3 partons , and no saturation effects are expected consequently . in this regime",
    ", the proton interacts through the small @xmath3 partons .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the dilepton production at forward rapidities , analyzed in the context of the color glass condensate in @xmath0 collisions , presents the same features of the cronin effect at forward rapidities , implying that this should be considered as an initial state effect . however , at backward rapidities , the cronin peak present in the hadrons rhic data @xcite is still not understood , and could be related to final state effects .",
    "the dileptons analyzed in this kinematical region , since they do not interact strongly with the final environment , may not present the same behavior of the hadron spectra .",
    "although it could imply the dilepton production to be symmetric when forward - backward regions are compared , in contrast to the different behavior of the hadron spectra in both regions , we verify that the dilepton production at backward rapidities is strongly modified due to large @xmath3 nuclear effects .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "the dipole approach is presented for the dilepton production at backward rapidities . in the sec .",
    "3 the nuclear partonic parametrizations employed in this work as well as a comparison between then are presented . in the sec .",
    "4 the results are discussed .",
    "our conclusions are left to the last section of this work .",
    "to evaluate the dilepton production at backward rapidities , an adequate treatment of the approach employed for the forward ones needs to be considered .",
    "the investigation at forward rapidities in @xmath7 collisions requires to describe the nucleus as a high density saturated system ( cgc ) , and the dileptons are produced by the decay of a virtual photon emitted by the quark from the proton , which interacts with the nuclear dense medium ( basically a dipole approach in the momentum space with a specific configuration of the nucleus ) . in this case",
    "the dilepton cross section can be factorized considering the wave function of the fluctuation @xmath8 and the interaction cross section of a quark with the nucleus , which takes into account the high density effects .",
    "however , at backward rapidities the nucleus interacts by means of large bjorken @xmath3 partons , being no more described by a high density qcd system .",
    "the proton interacts through very small @xmath3 partons implying that the dipole picture could be applied in this kinematical regime .    in the dipole approach at backward rapidities",
    ", the quark of the incident hadron ( nucleus ) fluctuates into a state containing a quark and a massive photon .",
    "the interaction with the target ( proton ) provides that the virtual photon is freed , decaying into a lepton pair @xcite ( one of the diagrams is shown in the fig.[dybrem ] ) .",
    "we are interested in the study of the dilepton production in a region where the interaction time of the projectile quark with the proton target is much shorter than the @xmath8 fluctuation time , meaning large coherence length . in order to apply the dipole picture at backward rapidities , we need to exchange the nucleus with the proton when comparing with the dipole picture at forward rapidities . in doing such procedure",
    ", the @xmath8 fluctuation time will be larger than the interaction time , since the coherence length @xmath9 has the dependence @xmath10 in the case studied here .",
    "indeed , the coherence length is important in the study of nuclear targets , where it is a fundamental quantity controlling nuclear effects @xcite .",
    "for the nuclear targets large coherence length needs to be reached if shadowing effect are under investigation , which implies that the approach should be applied only to smaller bjorken @xmath3 @xcite . another interesting point that arises here",
    "is that the @xmath5 broadening due to the nuclear multiple scattering verified at forward rapidities @xcite should not be present at backward rapidities , since the nuclear projectile will interact with a proton target and will not probe a large and very dense system .",
    "the advantage of this formalism is that the dilepton cross section can be written in terms of the same color dipole cross section as small-@xmath3 deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) .",
    "although diagrammatically no dipole is present in bremsstrahlung , the dipole cross section arises from the interference of the two bremsstrahlung diagrams , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite in a detailed derivation .",
    "the cross section for the radiation of a virtual photon from a quark ( with momentum fraction @xmath11 ) of the nucleus scattering off a proton at high density at backward region can be written in a factorized form as @xcite , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the dilepton transverse momentum , @xmath14 is the dilepton mass , @xmath15 the rapidity , @xmath16 is the dipole transverse separation .",
    "the variables @xmath17 and @xmath11 are defined in the usual way @xmath18 , with @xmath19 being the squared center of mass energy . as can be seen from the definition of @xmath17 and @xmath11",
    ", backward rapidities will provide large @xmath11 and small @xmath17 .",
    "we are investigating dilepton production in @xmath1 and @xmath7 collisions . in a symmetric collision ,",
    "the lab frame is equivalent to the center of mass frame considering colliders . in the case of asymmetric collisions , e.g. @xmath7 , the center of mass moves longitudinally in the lab frame .",
    "it provides that a largest interval in bjorken @xmath3 could be explored in the asymmetric collisions @xcite if the lab frame is under consideration . in this work",

    "two distinct parametrizations for the nuclear structure function will be used , which will be properly discussed in the next section . in this section eks nuclear parametrization @xcite",
    "was employed together with the grv98 parton distribution function @xcite in order to obtain the @xmath5 distribution for the @xmath7 collision and the @xmath43 is obtained from the grv98 parametrization for the @xmath1 collision . in the fig.[cap : result - for - pp ] the @xmath1 and @xmath7 transverse momentum distributions for rhic energies are shown and significative visible differences between both distributions are not found .",
    "for this reason , the ratio between @xmath7 and @xmath1 cross section should be useful to investigate modifications in the nuclear cross section in comparison with the @xmath1 distribution .",
    "the ratio is defined in the following way @xmath44 the ratio @xmath2 is normalized by @xmath45 , since the nuclear parton distributions are normalized by this factor .",
    "the difference between @xmath7 and @xmath1 calculations are due to the nuclear structure function @xmath46 , then any effect in the @xmath13 or rapidity spectra should be related to the nuclear effects contained in this function .",
    "the next - to - leading order calculation ( nlo ) in the collinear factorization could be evaluated and compared with the results in the dipole approach .",
    "however , the evaluation of the transverse momentum distribution in the collinear factorization is not a straightforward calculation and does not describe the normalization of the @xmath5 drell - yan dileptons @xcite .",
    "a resummation of large logarithms in @xmath47 @xcite or the introduction of an intrinsic transverse momentum @xcite should be necessary to avoid the divergence of the differential cross section at @xmath48 .",
    "new approaches have been suggested in order to describe the @xmath5 spectra of the dilepton ( for a good discussion see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , however , there is a strong dependence on phenomenological parameters .",
    "considering , for instance , the intrinsic transverse momentum , the @xmath5 distribution is dependent on a phenomenological parameter ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a comparison between the nlo calculations and the dipole approach , and ref .",
    "@xcite for a new approach ) . of course",
    ", the ratio @xmath2 should be finite since the @xmath5 divergence will be canceled , however , a more reliable result needs to consider finite spectra .",
    "this indicates that the dipole approach should be more adequated to investigate the low @xmath5 dileptons at high energies , since there are no free parameters and the cross section is finite at low @xmath5 .    for sake of completeness",
    ", it should be stressed that some limitations of the dipole approach at backward rapidities are in order .",
    "here , the nucleus is considered by means of an integrated gluon distribution , however , at lhc energies and more central rapidities , the bjorken @xmath11 ( nucleus ) reaches values around 0.002 , where the consideration of an integrated parton distribution could be questionable . at this high energy limit ,",
    "the effects of finite transverse momentum of the incoming partons become important .",
    "a more robust treatment would need to include the transverse momentum of the partons from the nucleus in the initial state of the interaction .",
    "this should be done considering the @xmath49 factorization approach @xcite , where the off - shell partonic cross sections are convoluted with @xmath49 unintegrated parton densities @xmath50 .",
    "considering dilepton production , the @xmath49 factorization is investigated in the ref .",
    "@xcite and compared with a phenomenological intrinsic @xmath49 approach ( @xmath49 factorization with on - shell partons ) , in order to describe the transverse momentum distribution of the drell - yan dilepton production . in spite of a reasonable data description ,",
    "the @xmath49 factorization overestimates the data and the intrinsic @xmath49 approach depends on phenomenological parameters ( two parameters ) .    for the reasons presented above",
    ", we have focoused our analysis at backward rapidities , and not at more central ones .",
    "the use of the dipole approach together with the collinear factorization is justified as the goal of this work is to investigate the nuclear effects in the nuclear modification ratio @xmath2 for dileptons , using nuclear parametrizations to describe the @xmath51 . in the next section",
    "the parametrizations for the nuclear structure function will be discussed and compared .",
    "in this work the parametrizations for the nuclear parton distribution function ( npdf ) proposed by eskola , kolhinen and salgado ( eks parametrization ) @xcite and by d. de florian and r. sassot ( nds parametrization ) @xcite are considered in order to describe the nuclear effects in the @xmath46 . in this section",
    "the main features of each parametrization will be discussed .",
    "both nuclear parton distribution functions provide a global fitting to fixed target experimental results , and consider the dglap equations for the @xmath52 evolution .",
    "the initial conditions are adjusted to describe the dis in lepton - nucleus collisions and the dilepton production in proton - nucleus collisions .",

    "the parametrization for the parton distributions are constrained by charge , baryon number , and momentum conservation .",
    "however , the method used by eks and nds differs with respect to their approaches to parametrize the npdfs . in the eks approach ,",
