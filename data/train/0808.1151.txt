    "very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) is a powerful technique for obtaining positions of celestial objects with milliarcsecond  ( mas ) level accuracy .",
    "the vlbi exploration of radio astrometry ( vera ) telescopes are a japanese vlbi array dedicated to phase referencing vlbi  @xcite .",
    "vera consists of four 20 m diameter antennas at mizusawa , ogasawara , iriki and ishigaki - jima ( see figure  1 of @xcite ) . to overcome phase fluctuations and the limited integration time in conventional fast - switching vlbi",
    ", vera has a dual beam system that allows simultaneous observations of the target and reference sources separated by 0.3 to 2.2 degrees .",
    "this advanced capability of vera can be used to measure annual parallaxes and proper motions of masers with a 10 micro arcsecond ( @xmath5as ) level accuracy .",
    "an annual parallax gives a simple geometrical measure of the distance , free from the complex assumptions required in other distance estimators .",
    "studies of asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite are based on the annual parallax derived from vlbi observations , and demonstrated the the ability of vlbi astrometry .",
    "more recently , successful measurements of distances and proper motions with vera have been reported  @xcite . in the present paper ,",
    "we report the observations of s  crt , concentrating on the distance measurement .",
    "s  crt ( iras11501@xmath00719 , irc@xmath010259 , afgl4830s ) is an agb star , with a pulsation period of 155days@xcite .",
    "s  crt has a variability type of srb in the general catalog of variable stars  @xcite .",
    "the apparent magnitude at @xmath6 band is 0.786@xmath30.314mag @xcite .",
    "the optical light curve in @xmath7 band is presented in figure  [ lightcurves](a ) exhibiting @xmath80.8mag variation .",
    "the distance to s  crt has been measured in various ways . @xcite and @xcite determined the distance to be 420pc and 285pc , respectively , using the period - luminosity(pl ) relation of mira variables . @xcite used hipparcos data to measure a parallax of 2.04@xmath31.31mas , corresponding to a distance of 490pc , but with an large uncertainty .",
    "recently , the new hipparcos catalog  @xcite gives the parallax of 1.27@xmath30.92mas , corresponding to a distance of 787pc .",
    "vera offers the potential to determine the parallax with a better accuracy so that the inconsistencies in these distance measurements can be resolved .",
    "the observations and data reduction are described in section  2 . in section  3 , we present absolute positions and internal motions of maser spots .",
    "the annual parallax of s  crt is presented and converted to the absolute distance in this section . finally ,",
    "in section  4 , we examine the properties of s  crt in the context of the new distance measurement .",
    "we have conducted a series of monthly vlbi observations from october 2005 to may 2007 with vera .",
    "the duration of each observation was typically 8.5hours , yielding a net integration time of 5 to 6 hours . the typical synthesized beam size ( fwhm )",
    "was 1.5mas @xmath9 0.8mas with a position angle ( p.a . ) of @xmath10 . to obtain the positions of maser spots in s  crt ,",

    "november was not used because the ishigaki - jima antenna did not participate .",
    "bad weather conditions in four observations held between august and october in 2006 resulted in much higher system noise temperatures ( @xmath15500k ) at some of the stations .",
    "the shorter integration times and unsolved phase fluctuations in these four observations degraded the image qualities of s  crt in both self - calibration and phase reference analyses .",
    "the observation status is summarized in table  [ observations ] , which is organized as follows : column  ( 1)the i d number of epoch . the numbers with an asterisk `` * ''",

    "we did not use these three observations for the parallax estimation . in parallel with the vlbi program ,",
    "we have monitored s  crt with single - dish observations at iriki station since 2003 september with the typical interval of one month ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "a data recording rate of 1024mbps was adopted with the vera dir2000 recording system , which yields the total receivable bandwidth of 256mhz with 2-bit digitization .",
    "the 256mhz bandwidth data of left - hand circular polarization were divided into 16 if channels of 16mhz band width , one of which was used to receive the maser emission and the others were used to receive the continuum emission from j1147@xmath00724 .",
    "cross - correlation was carried out with the mitaka fx correlator  @xcite at the national astronomical observatory of japan ( naoj ) . in most observations ,",

    "for the data of j1147@xmath00724 , the if channels were divided into 64 spectral channels in all observations .",
    "we used the astronomical imaging package software ( aips ) developed in the national radio astronomical observatory in the data reduction .",
    "amplitude calibration was achieved using the system noise temperatures and gains logged during the observations at each station . in the fringe search process of the reference source j1147@xmath00724 , we used the task fring with a typical integration time of 2minutes , with solutions of fringe phases , group delays , and delay rates obtained every 30seconds . using the task tacop ,",

    "phase and amplitude solutions obtained from self - calibration of the j1147@xmath00724 were also transferred to the s  crt data .    since the delay - tracking models used to estimate _ a priori _ delays in the mitaka fx correlator were not accurate enough for astrometry with vera , we have applied better estimates calculated with the calc3/msolv software package  @xcite .",
    "@xcite gave a brief description of this package in the report to the international earth rotation service ( iers ) .",
    "calc3 has slight differences in the physical models than those adopted in calc which was developed by the research group at nasa goddard space flight center ( gsfc ) .",
    "comparing the two _ a priori _ values from mitaka fx correlator and the calc3/msolv package , we obtained the difference between the two estimates , then applied them to the visibility data using the tasks tbin and clcal in aips .",
    "we note that the zenith excess path lengths due to the wet atmosphere measured by the global positioning system ( gps ) at each station are considered in the calc3/msolv package .",
    "we estimated the residual atmospheric zenith delay offset using the method described in @xcite .",
    "this correction was applied to one of the four stations of vera where the coherence of the phase - referenced image was maximized .",
    "typically , the offsets were found within @xmath33 cm .    the instrumental delay caused by the difference between two signal paths",
    "was estimated using an artificial noise source  @xcite .",
    "these delays were then loaded into aips and applied in the same manner as the delay tracking model correction . for each observation , we fitted a two dimensional gaussian model to the brightness distribution to find the position of the maser spot",
    ". then we used these to derive the annual parallax and linear proper motions ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) .    in the single - beam vlbi imaging of s  crt ,",
    "group delays solved with 3c279 were applied , then fringe - fitting was done using the brightest emission showing the lsr velocity of 34.7kms@xmath2 .",
    "thus relative positions of all maser spots in self - calibrated images were determined with respect to this reference spot .",
    "for each velocity channel , position of the spot is defined as the brightness peak of the image . to estimate the relative motion of each spot ,",
    "a linear least - squares analysis was applied to the spot seen at the same velocity channel during at least two continuous observations .",
    "the signal to noise ratio of 10 was adopted as the detection criterion in the self - calibrated images .",
    "the rms noise of the self - calibrated images was typically 90mjybeam@xmath2 .",
    "on the other hand , the rms noise of the phase - referenced images was typically 700mjybeam@xmath2 , about one order of magnitude larger than that of self - calibrated images . due to limited phase coherence",

    "the cross - power spectrum at the same time showed significantly weaker ( @xmath1830% ) flux density than that of the total power spectrum , indicating that some of the flared emission is resolved on the vera baselines .    in figure  [ fig - sky ] , we present the positions of maser spot at the lsr velocity of 34.7kms@xmath2 relative to the phase tracking center . throughout the present vlbi observations , this maser spot was bright enough to be detected on all baselines in the phase referencing analyses .",

    "the corresponding eigenvector @xmath67 presented in figure  [ fig - map ] indicate the spatial elongation of the maser distribution .",
    "the position angle of this axis is found to be @xmath68 .",
    "although maser velocity and position axes show a discrepancy of @xmath69 , the directions of these model - independent axes indicate the bipolar outflow with the major axis along northeast - southwest .",
    "this dynamical property is not revealed by previous observation @xcite .",
    "we estimate the stellar position from the present result by using the kinematic information .",
    "since the motion of each maser spot are powered by the forming star , its position can be estimated as an origin of these motions .",
    "here , we take one of the simplest kinematic models , which assumes a linear motion with a constant velocities from a single origin .",
    "this technique is essentially same as that used in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "based on this modeling , we obtained the origin of the maser motions which most effectively explain the observed positions and velocities . the stellar position from this kinematic analysis ,",
    "the kinematic center was obtained to be ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) @xmath13 ( @xmath07.9@xmath31.8mas , @xmath014.9@xmath313.3mas ) , which is indicated with the cross with error bars in figure  [ fig - map ] .",
    "we used the first order moment with respect to the determined stellar position in order to find a typical distance of maser spots .",
    "the obtained distance was 14.2@xmath33.5mas , and presented with dashed line in figure  [ fig - map ] .",
    "at the distance of 430pc , the corresponding linear length is 6.11au .",
    "since we estimated the inclination angle of the outflow axis , this projected length can be converted to the linear radius of 8.96au .",
    "nineteen years ago , the angular distribution of the masers was firstly observed with the nrao very large array in its a configuration @xcite .",
    "the masers were uniformly distributed over a 40mas@xmath7040mas region with the lsr velocities ranging evenly from 33.4 to 44.2kms@xmath2 ( figure  13 of @xcite ) . in their study , the blue-(red-)shifted spots were found in the northeast(southwest ) of the maser region . in addition , masers with intermediate velocities were found in the central region .",
    "although the extent of the distribution is consistent with our result , we did not detect the masers in central region . in figure",
    "[ fig - map ] , the maser spots are mainly found at the peripheral region of the distribution . during the period of 2006.3",
    " 2007.0 , we could not find the emission with intermediate velocities(see figure  [ fig - spectr](b ) ) , and it can explain the the absence of intermediate velocity maser spots . on the other hand , at the beginning and end of our vlbi observations , the masers with intermediate velocities are found in total power spectrum , and they distributed in the peripheral region . as @xcite did not precisely mention the flux densities and sizes of each spot , it is difficult to specify the reason for our non - detection of the masers in central region .",
    "however , we can speculate as to the reason ; ( 1)our image sensitivities were not high enough to detect them .",
    "the rms noise 38mjybeam@xmath2 of @xcite was lower than that of the present vlbi observations , 90mjybeam@xmath2 .",
    "( 2)the masers in central region have faded before the present vlbi observations .",
    "( 3)the masers were extended and diffuse , therefore they were resolved out with the synthesized beam of vera .",
    "for example , we find the effect of resolve - out ( e.g. @xmath7130% in 2006 march ) from the comparison between cross - power spectrum ( figure  [ fig - spectr ] ) and total - power spectrum ( figure  [ lightcurves](b ) ) .",
    "we extract the stellar properties of s  crt using the distance .",
    "@xcite determined the temperature of photosphere ( @xmath72 ) in s  crt to be 3097@xmath3100k by fitting two blackbodies to its infrared spectrum .",
    "using this temperature , we estimated an acceptable temperature range of 2600  3500k . here",
    "we assume that the light variation of 0.8mag ( figure  [ lightcurves](a ) ) is same in the infrared and caused only by the temperature variation .",
    "@xcite reported that mira variables show @xmath73 2418  2902k and srvs shows @xmath73 3005  3500k .",
    "the estimated temperature range of s  crt is consistent with their finding .",
    "it is worthwhile estimating the stellar radius of s  crt , since there is no direct measurement . using the apparent magnitudes in infrared(j , h , and k ) , @xmath72(3097k ) and the distance(430pc )",
    ", we estimated the radius of s  crt photosphere ( @xmath74 ) to be @xmath75cm(260@xmath320@xmath76 ) .",
    "this is presented with a shaded - circle in figure  [ fig - map ] , and the center of circle is placed on the kinematic center . using this radius , we estimated an acceptable radius range of 213  309@xmath76 , under the assumption that the light variation is caused , now , only by the radius variation .",
    "in the studies of @xcite and @xcite , @xmath74s of dozen of mira variables are presented , and most @xmath74/@xmath76 is larger than 300 . the photospheric radius of s  crt is close to the lower limits to those of mira variables in the literature .",
    "since the estimates of @xmath74 and @xmath72 are now available , the luminosity ( @xmath77 ) of s  crt is estimated to be 2.29@xmath910@xmath78[w ] , resulting in the ratio @xmath79/@xmath80 of 5970 .    a similar analysis of data for",
    "a larger number of mira and srvs would be very useful for a better understanding of the difference and similarities between mira variables and srvs .",
    "we have used vlbi monitoring observations with vera to measure the absolute proper motions of a maser spot in s  crt with respect to the quasar j1147@xmath00724 .",
    "we obtained an annual parallax of 2.33@xmath30.13mas corresponding to a distance of 430@xmath4pc .",
    "nearly two years astrometric observations revealed the internal motions of 26 maser spots for the first time .",
    "taking into account the internal motions of the reference maser spot , the absolute proper motion of s  crt system was obtained to be ( @xmath32masyr@xmath2 , @xmath33masyr@xmath2 ) , which is consistent with the result in the new hipparcos catalog .",
    "the three - dimensional velocity field of the maser spots in s  crt was also detected , clearly outlining a bipolar outflow with the major axis along northeast - southwest .",
    "the inclination of the axis with respect to the sky plane was @xmath66 .",
    "the angular size of the maser distribution can be converted to the linear maser distribution radius of 8.96au .    using the photospheric temperature of 3097k  @xcite",
    ", the @xmath6 band apparent magnitude @xmath810.79 , and the distance of 430pc , the linear radius of s  crt photosphere ( @xmath74 ) was estimated to be @xmath75cm(260@xmath320@xmath76 ) .",
    "this radius is comparable with the lower limits to those of mira variables in literatures .",
