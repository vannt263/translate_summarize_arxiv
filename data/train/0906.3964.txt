    "in the zoo of variable stars su uma stars arguably belong to the most intriguing exhibits .",
    "they are cataclysmic binaries , consisting of a non - magnetic white dwarf and a late main sequence secondary filling its roche lobe and loosing mass through the inner lagrangian point .",
    "their orbital periods usually are less than the period gap at 2.5 hours .",
    "the transferred matter forms an accretion disc around the primary ( warner 1995 , hellier 2001 ) . in many cataclysmic variables",
    "accretion rate varies considerably resulting in brightness increase by several magnitudes recurring in a semi - regular fashion after weeks or months intervals .",
    "the bright phases are called _ outbursts _ and faint ones _ quiescence_.    the su uma stars are unique in that they simultaneously exhibit two patterns of re - brightening : the _ ordinary outbursts _ , with amplitudes typically 2 - 6 magnitudes , and _ superoutbursts _ brighter by about one magnitude than the ordinary ones . in most cases the superoutbursts recur more regularly at intervals several times longer than the ordinary outbursts . all superoutbursts studied sufficiently well reveal characteristic periodic tooth - shaped modulation called superhumps .",
    "their periods are couple hours and amplitudes are of order 0.1 magnitude",
    ".    the peculiar behavior of su uma stars can be understood within the frame of the thermal and tidal instability model ( see osaki 1996 for review ) .",
    "the superhumps period is slightly longer than the orbital period of the binary star .",
    "most likely they are caused by prograde rotation of the line of the apsides of a disk elongated by tidal perturbation from the secondary .",
    "the perturbation is most effective when disk particles moving in eccentric orbits enter the 3:1 resonance with the binary orbit .",
    "then the superhump period is simply the beat period between orbital and precession rate periods ( whitehurst 1988 ) .",
    "apart from the ordinary- and super - outbursts with the superhumps su uma stars exhibit often additional types of periodic modulation . an orbital wave and/or eclipses may occur for inclination @xmath6 . in the late stages of superoutbursts and during the early quiescence may appear late superhumps , shifted by 0.5 in phase in respect to the ordinary superhumps . in some systems",
    "negative superhumps occur with a period slightly shorter than the orbital period .",
    "they are explained by invoking the classical retrograde precession of the disc tilted with respect to the orbital plane ( wood & burke 2007 ) .    on one hand the positive and negative superhumps were discovered together in just two su uma stars , namely v503 cyg ( harvey et al . 1995 ) and bf ara ( kato et al .",
    "2003b , olech et al .",
    "2007 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "such phenomena were already observed in am cvn variables ( am cvn itself - skillman et al .",
    "1999 ) , classical novae ( v1974 cyg - retter et al .",
    "1997 and v603 aql - patterson et al .",
    "1997 ) , vy scl stars ( tt ari - skillman et al .",
    "1998 ) , sw sex stars ( v795 her and dw uma - patterson et al . 2002 ) , nova - like variables ( tv col - retter et al . 2003 ) and even in the low mass x - ray binaries ( v1405 aql - retter et al . 2002 )",
    "after examining objects from sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) szkody et al .",
    "( 2004 ) listed sdss j2100 as a candidate dwarf nova because of its spectrum characteristic for dwarf novae in outburst .",
    "the follow - up photometric and spectroscopic observations of sdss j2100 were obtained by tramposch et al .",
    "their photometry was obtained on 3 nights spanning 3 months and on each occasion extended over 3 cycles . on two nights",
    "the star was bright and clearly revealed the tooth - shaped modulation with period of 2.099(2 ) hours ( 0.08746 days ) and amplitude of 0.3 mag . on third night",
    "it was in quiescence and pulsating sinusoidally with period 1.96(2 ) hours ( 0.0817 days ) and amplitude reaching 0.5 mag .",
    "tramposch et al .",
    "( 2005 ) argued that because of overall similarity of sdss j2100 to v503 cyg ( harvey et al .",
    "1995 ) the modulation in quiescence corresponds to the negative superhumps .",
    "however , light curves of cataclysmic variables are known to suffer from red noise due to flickering .",
    "because of that any derived periods have errors underestimated , with no regard wheather they come from the least squares or the white noise simulations ( schwarzenberg - czerny , 1991 ) .",
    "this combined with scant evidence at hand prompted us to look closer at this star .",
    "curious variables experiment ( curve ) is a long - term project of photometric observations of interesting variable stars in the galaxy and its clusters ( olech et al .",
    "2008 , pietrukowicz et al .",
    "2008 ) . in order to study southern objects we applied for time on the 1 m telescope of the south african astronomical observatory ( saao ) .",
    "the time allocated to our project lasted from august 15 till september 11 , 2007 .",
    ".journal of saao observations of sdss j210014.12 + 004446.0 [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ , > \" , ]     the moments of maxima and minima can be fitted with their respective linear ephemerides of the form :    @xmath7    the @xmath8 values computed according to the above - mentioned formulae are presented in table 2 and also plotted in fig .",
    "5 . they are consistent with the 0.0811-day period remaining constant during our run .    to calculate the final value of the principal negative hump period of sdss j2100 we fitted the light curve with a sinusoid , yielding @xmath9 days ( @xmath1 min ) .",
    "this period differs only by 0.000006 days from the weighted mean of the values from eqs . 1 and 2 , suggesting that its error is not underestimated by more than a factor of 2 ( schwarzenberg - czerny , 1991 ) .",
    "in classical su uma stars , the superhumps are observed during supermaxima , their shape resembles shark teeth and their period is few percent longer than the orbital one while typical amplitudes are in the range 0.1 - 0.3 mag .",
    "curiously , this was exactly what tramposch et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have observed in sdss j2100 during the july 2003 outburst .",
    "namely , during two nights the star was bright ( @xmath10 mag ) and revealed teeth - shaped oscillations with the period of @xmath11 hours i.e. 0.08746(8 ) days and the amplitude of 0.2 - 0.3 mag .",
    "this and their lack during our outbursts confirms they were common ( positive ) superhumps arising from the apsidal precession of the eccentric accretion disc .",
    "some cataclysmic variables reveal the so - called negative superhumps .",
    "they are thought to occur due to the nodal precession of a tilted accretion disc .",
    "according to wood & burke ( 2007 ) for the tilted accretion disk the stream often misses its rim , penetrating deeper inwards on most orbital phases . when the stream eventually collides with the disk , it releases more energy in the ensuing hot spot .",
    "early collision occurs only when the stream sweeps across the disk rim ( the nodal line ) .",
    "depending whether the stream hits or misses the rim , as the hot spot migrates in and out , and its brightness is modulated accordingly , roughly twice per each binary revolution .",
    "however , the observer sees only one event per cycle , from the hot spot occurring on the visible side of the disk . to complete the scenario ,",
    "the tilted disc is subject to a slow retrograde precession , resulting in the modulation period slightly shorter than the orbital one .",
    "the negative superhumps were detected so far just in two classical su uma stars namely in v503 cyg ( harvey et al .",
    "1995 ) and bf ara ( olech et al . 2007 ) . in both stars",
    "the modulation persists over long period of time covering several cycles and supercycles and its amplitude in quiescence is large , reaching up to 0.5 - 1 mag . unlike in ordinary superhumps , their decline branches are often steeper than the rise .",
    "th 0.0811 day oscillation of sdss j2100 described in sect .",
    "4 has all properties of the negative superhump .",
    "this is best appreciated by inspection of the light curve of sdss j2100 phased and binned with this period ( fig .",
    "each bin contains about 20 measurements and small scatter indicates excellent phasing . to make this picture clear , we subtracted from the light curve the high frequency modulation , to be discussed in the next section .",
    "note , that as pointed by tramposch et al .",
    "( 2005 ) if the 0.08746 day period corresponds to the positive superhump it would be wrong to attribute the 0.0811 day period to the orbital motion",
    ". the corresponding period excess @xmath12 , defined as @xmath13 , of 8% would exceed by a factor of two the values observed in other su uma stars of the similar period . as discussed in sect .",
    "7 , among su uma stars the period excess is strongly correlated with the orbital period . in the next section",
    "we confirm this argument by detection of the separate orbital modulation .      in quiescence",
    "dwarf novae of intermediate inclination often reveal orbital modulation of their light curve .",
    "the modulation is caused by changing aspect of the non - transparent hot spot .",
    "depending on the transparency of the spot , the resulting light curve is complex , often double humped .",
    "the double humped light curve reveals more power in its @xmath14 harmonics than in the fundamental period . in this regard note",
    "that our light curve of sdss j2100 after prewhitening of the negative superhump yields another modulation of frequency @xmath15 c / d , about right for the orbital harmonics .",
    "thus @xmath16 c / d would correspond to the orbital period of @xmath17 days . recalling large power in 1",
    "c / d alias @xmath18 it seems justified to consider it as an alternative orbital harmonics .",
    "the hitch is that the orbital frequency @xmath19 c / d corresponding to @xmath20 days would yield a period excess of only 0.6% i.e. much , much smaller than observed in the typical su uma stars of the orbital period close to @xmath21 .    for comparison in fig .",
    "7 we plot the light curve of sdss j2100 prewhitened with the negative superhump modulation , phased and binned with the periods of 0.08330 and 0.08692 days .",
    "note that the former period yields the largest peak - to - peak modulation , while the latter one yields a smoothed - out light curve with similar maxima .",
    "this suggests that for the period 0.08692 alternate maxima of differing shapes were averaged out and it lends further support to our orbital period of 0.08330 days .",
    "the asymmetry in the heights of the maxima of the orbital light curve is consistent with the orbital wave hypothesis for a semi - transparent hot spot .",
    "the higher maximum arises from the hot spot visible face - on .",
    "the secondary maximum is produced half orbital cycle later while only a fraction of radiation penetrates through the back of the hot spot moved to the opposite side of the disc .",
    "summarizing conclusions from previous sections , sdss j2100 reveals typical characteristic of an active su uma stars .",
    "tramposch et al .",
    "( 2005 ) likely caught it during superoutburst and demonstrated presence of superhumps with the period of @xmath22 days ( @xmath23 min ) .",
    "we observed frequent normal outbursts lasting 2 - 3 days and with amplitudes of @xmath01.7 mag .    except for the superoutbursts ,",
    "the light curve is dominated by the combination of two oscillations with periods @xmath24 days ( @xmath1 min ) and @xmath25 days ( @xmath26 min ) , interpreted as the negative superhumps and the orbital period of the binary , respectively .",
    "already tramposch et al .",
    "( 2005 ) speculated that the three humps seen by them on one night in quiescence were negative superhumps .",
    "we refined their period and discovered the orbital modulation , thus securing interpretation of all three periods .",
    "their presence allow us to determine both the period excess and the period deficit , respectively for the positive and negative humps , as equal to @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the most recent compilation of the properties of stars showing superhumps were made by patterson ( 1998 ) , patterson et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and pearson ( 2006 ) .",
    "however , the last two papers contain only tables of values without particular references for each object .",
    "this compelled us to redo the literature survey again and to update it till the end of 2008 .",
    "the survey returned 112 cataclysmic variables with known orbital and any superhump period ( no matter positive , negative or both ) .",
    "the complete material will be discussed elsewhere ( olech 2009 , in preparation ) .",
    "its subset for the systems revealing simultaneously positive and negative superhumps is discussed in sect .",
    "7.2 . here in fig .",
    "8 we present only an updated graph of the period excesses / deficits , for all surveyed stars with @xmath29 , plotted against their orbital period .",
    "the big solid triangles in fig . 8 correspond to the values of period excess and deficit for sdss j2100 , @xmath12 and @xmath30 , calculated for the orbital period determined in sect .",
    "their excellent match with other points renders strong support to our choice of the true orbital period among its aliases . for alias periods",
    ", the triangles would be located far away from the general trend .",
    "pearson ( 2006 ) fitted a simple formula to the empirical relation between period excess and mass ratio :    @xmath31    by employing it we estimated the mass ratio for sdss j2100 as equal to @xmath32 .",
    "next , assuming that the secondary size is consistent with the main sequence value we could employ the empirical mass - period relation ( warner 1995 ) :    @xmath33}\\ ] ]    to derive masses .",
    "this yields tentative mass estimates @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "this values are consistent with those for other dwarf novae just below of the orbital period gap between 2 and 3 hours .",
    "retter et al .",
    "( 2002 ) listed seven cataclysmic variables exhibiting both positive and negative superhumps .",

    "these are often artefacts resulting from improper treatment of intrinsic random flickering of a typical time scale @xmath84 of several minutes . in the time and",
    "frequency domains the flickering manifests respectively as correlation of consecutive observations and red noise . thus any measurements repeated on a time scale @xmath85 short compared to @xmath84 yield no additional information on period ( schwarzenberg - czerny , 1991 ) .",
    "after correction for the correlation / red noise effects the lsq errors increase by @xmath86 and they became comparable to those of eq .",
    "( [ ea.1 ] ) .",
    "similar problems may arise if two different modulations in the light curve are difficult to separate causing mutual interference in the period estimation .",
    "the only difference is that now @xmath87 plays role of @xmath84 .",
    "we quote lsq errors only when roughly consistent with ( e ) .",
    "they are coded with ( l ) .        in cvs",
    "systematic period modulations result from evolution of accretion disc and/or from solar cycle of the secondary star .",
    "sparse observations of these effects often yield apparently semi - random scatter of the derived periods . to prevent over - interpretation",
    "we must caution here that neither the underlying physics nor telescope time allocation are random processes so that strictly speaking the resulting period estimates are not random variables .",
    "this said , we handled them as if they were random .",
    "thus our prefered procedure was to derive periods by averaging the results from different observing runs and quoting half of their spread interval as their error .",
    "occasionally period derivative was used to estimate the spread interval .",
    "the errors derived from the spread interval are coded ( s ) .",
    "studies of eclipses revealed that orbital periods of cvs fluctuate over time scales from several years to several decades .",
    "possible explanations involve solar - type cycle of the secondary star ( warner , 1995 ) . however , these period changes @xmath88 for reasonable coverage should not affect orbital cycle count and they may be neglected in our analysis . in spectroscopic observations",
    "large random errors combine with large systematic orbital phase shifts , e.g. manifested by rv and eclipse phase differences .",
    "the shifts reach @xmath89 .",
    "they are likely caused by non - axsymmetric disk sources of the emission lines and they seem to depend on the luminosity / accretion status of a cv binary ( thorstensen et al . 1985 , hereafter tsh ) .",
    "on one hand such shifts may prevent reliable orbital cycle count over gaps factor 3 larger ( gf3l ) than the base time interval . on the other hand consistent appearance of alias envelopes in the periodograms from different data sets",
    "suggests that likely cycle count errors do not exceed several over the whole data interval .",
    "such errors are of negligible astrophysical consequence in the present context .",
    "our point is well illustrated for tt ari , a bright and well observed novalike cv .",
    "tsh derived its spectroscopic ephemeris by carefully attempting to elliminate any systematic effects and using datasets of good quality spanning over 6 years .",
    "however , their stated period error was consistent with @xmath78 as small as @xmath90 .",
    "after 21 years wu et al .",
    "( 2002 ) obtained another good sample of rv observations .",
    "they found tsh ephemeris shifted in phase by 0.35 , indicating period error underestimated and insecure cycle count .",
    "the updated period shift is consistent with @xmath91 for tsh data .",
    "the new ephemeris by wu et el .",
    "( 2002 ) also does suffer from gf3l hence a @xmath92 cycle count error over 21 years may not be entirely excluded .",
    "we stress again that such problems arise for a well observed star and carefull analysis .",
    "the true culprit are systematic effect in the accretion disc light sources .",
    "insecure cycle count due to gf3l determinations are coded with ( c ) .",
    "negative and/or positive humps display periods close to the orbital one .",
    "they are observed as permanent features in some novalike stars or occasionally in dwarf novae , mainly during superoutbursts .",
    "they periods are known to vary in time .",
    "the variations may be systematic during superoutbursts or they manifest as period fluctuations between different superoutbursts and in permanent humps .",
    "the humps are thought to arise solely in an accretion disc .",
    "their clocks are tied to the dynamical effects while any period changes reflect varying residual pressure effects . for sufficent data we estimated periods using ( s ) procedure and otherwise we had to rely on ( e ) values .",
    "while our prewhitening technique is rather simple and efficient , it seems to be rarely used hence we devote space to its brief description .",
    "we assume that the exact value of frequency @xmath93 is known , e.g. from a constant amplitude sine fit .",
    "we adopt time zero so that it corresponds the to maximum of the fitted sinusoid .",
    "let @xmath94 denotes a fixed cosine function and @xmath95 is its period .",
    "for each data point @xmath96 obtained at time @xmath97 we select a running window extending over @xmath98 . within that window",
    "the data are fitted with the function @xmath99 by least squares adjustement of the shift and scale parameters , @xmath100 and @xmath101 respectively .",
    "for the value of the modulated oscillation at time @xmath97 we adopt @xmath102 .",
    "for the next moment of time @xmath103 we select a new window and obtain new values of @xmath100 and @xmath101 and so on .",
    "the above procedure may be efficiently implemented by noting that @xmath104-[f][x]\\right)f(t_i)+[x][f^2]-[xf][f]}{n[f^2]-[f]^2}\\ ] ] where @xmath105 $ ] denote sums of the corresponding values over the running window and @xmath106 is number of points in the window .",
    "these sums are easily adjusted after moving of the window by adding contributions from the new points and subtracting those from the omitted ones .",
    "our particular selection of the window width of @xmath77 or its integer multiple is optimal for roughly uniform distribution of observations .",
    "namely , it may be demonstrated that then the parameters @xmath100 and @xmath101 are uncorrelated , hence they suffer less from statistical errors ."
