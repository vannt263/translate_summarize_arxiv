    "d - branes are very important non - perturbative objects in string theory .",
    "their existence is essential since they are needed , among other things , for various string theory dualities to work .",
    "the most primitive definition of a d - brane is as a hyper surface on which open strings end .    in this work",
    "we are interested only in d0-branes .",
    "they play a particularly important role since they are the basic constituents of matrix theory @xcite , which , being a suggestion for a non - perturbative definition of string theory ( or m - theory @xcite ) , deserves particular attention .",
    "it is also possible to think about them as bound states of higher dimensional unstable d - branes @xcite .",
    "furthermore , as was shown by myers @xcite , they can also form bound states with all the properties of higher dimensional branes .",
    "it is therefore clear that d0-branes have many interesting properties that make them worth studying in detail .",
    "concretely this means studying supersymmetric quantum mechanics which is an interesting topic in itself .",
    "although this topic has been studied before @xcite-@xcite we feel that there are still unresolved issues .",
    "in particular one could use a computer to compute properties of d0-branes which are not possible to address analytically because of the complexity of the theory .",
    "this is the goal of this work , to develop a `` 0-brane quantum chemistry '' .",
    "it should be mentioned that similar issues have been addressed in @xcite .",
    "however , we use a different method which we compare to the method developed in @xcite ( to which we also suggest certain improvements ) .    more concretely ,",
    "in this work we try to find the bound state of two d0-branes in three dimensional minkowski space ( which is really a toy - model for the real situation , d0-branes in ten dimensional minkowski space ) .",
    "it should also be noticed that the really interesting cases where the d0-brane theory is thought to describe macroscopic supergravity states is achieved by taking the number of zero branes to infinity .",
    "the low energy physics of @xmath0 parallel d@xmath1-branes is governed by the dimensional reduction of @xmath2 dimensional @xmath3 supersymmetric yang - mills theory with @xmath4 gauge group to @xmath5 dimension @xcite .",
    "the center of mass motion is governed by the overall @xmath6 factor so if we are interested in relative motion only , we can choose the gauge group to be @xmath7 .",
    "in the case we are interested in , the relative motion of two 0-branes , we thus choose the gauge group to be @xmath8 . the action is @xcite @xmath9 \\label{full}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the hamiltonian derived from this is @xcite @xmath10 together with the constraint one gets from varying ( [ full ] ) with respect to @xmath11 @xmath12 on quantum level , we restcrict our hilbert space to vectors which satisfy @xmath13 that is , our physical space is gauge invariant because @xmath14 are gauge generators .    we will only study motion of two @xmath15-branes in three dimensional minkowski space . we hope that this gives us the basic behavior of @xmath15-branes and also an understanding of the full problem .",
    "this problem of two branes is also described in @xcite but we study it in a different way . in the three dimensional case",
    "the action is given by dimensional reduction of @xmath3 supersymmetric yang - mills theory with @xmath8 gauge group in @xmath16 dimension to @xmath17 dimension .",
    "the hamiltonian takes the slightly simpler form @xmath18 where @xmath19 are fields in the @xmath8 adjoint representation and @xmath20 is a complex fermion also in the adjoint representation .",
    "of course we still have to impose gauge invariance ( [ phys ] ) .",
    "in fact , the gauge invariance complicates things somewhat since we would like to separate out gauge invariant degrees of freedom from pure gauge degrees of freedom in our basic quantum mechanical operators @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "let us focus on physical content of the @xmath23 .",
    "it contains six components ( the gauge index runs over three values and the space index @xmath24 runs from 1 to 2 ) .",
    "we know that we can remove three of these variables using gauge transformations so only three variables are observable .",
    "these three variables should describe the relative position of two pointlike objects in two space dimensions .",
    "we draw the conclusion that one of the physical variables do not have the interpretation of a coordinate but rather as some internal auxilliary degree of freedom .",
    "to get some further insight into this problem it is neccesery to investigate the bosonic vacuum of the theory .",
    "it is possible to explicitly separate the gauge degrees of freedom from @xmath25 by decomposition it in matrix form @xcite @xmath26 here the matrix @xmath27 is an group element in the adjoint representation of @xmath8 .",
    "thus when the gauge group acts on @xmath21 , @xmath27 just changes by ordinary gauge group multiplication ( from the left ) .",
    "we will parametrise the group element @xmath27 by the `` angles '' @xmath28 ( [ psi ] ) .",
    "this decomposition has the advantage that all the gauge dependence sits in @xmath27 and all the other matrices are gauge invariant .    in an analogous way we have separated out the dependence on rotations in space .",
    "namely , performing an @xmath29 rotation in space we have an element of @xmath29 acting from the right on the matrix @xmath30 .",
    "thus we can separate out the dependence on the angle in space ( we will call it @xmath31 ) by saying that @xmath32 is a group element of @xmath29 .",
    "we are left with the matrix @xmath33 ( [ rt ] ) which by construction is both gauge and space rotation invariant @xmath34 the bosonic potential in ( [ toy ] ) is gauge and rotation invariant and in the new decomposition coordinates depends only on two @xmath35 which have length dimension ( fig .",
    "[ picpot ] ) .",
    "the parametrisation @xmath36 is the only way how to obtain exactly one variable , @xmath37 , with the dimension length , which could represent relative distance of two branes .",
    "the dimensionless @xmath38 is the auxilliary coordinate .",
    "the potential in this coordinate reads @xmath39    looking at the picture we can draw some interesting conclusions . if we fix a point on the bosonic vacuum ( a classical static configuration with minimum energy ) , that is on the axes , we can study the behavior of the potential for small fluctuations of the auxilliary variable @xmath38 .",
    "we see that for large @xmath37 the @xmath38 fluctuation are very much suppressed but at small @xmath37 , @xmath38 will be allowed to fluctuate .",
    "this can be interpreted to mean that when the branes get close to each other , they can start to move also in the @xmath38 direction .",
    "thus , @xmath38 is an auxilliary coordinate which is visible only when the branes come close together .",
    "the above discussion included only the bosonic degrees of freedom , we should keep in mind that the fermionic degrees of freedom can ( and will ) change this behavior somewhat .",
    "in essence , the pauli repulsion will try to spread out the wavefunction as much as possible .",
    "when we use the standard operator representation of @xmath40 and @xmath21 the first term in the hamiltonian ( [ toy ] ) is proportional to the laplacian which we have to rewrite in the decomposition coordinates above to separate out gauge using formula @xmath41 where the @xmath42 is the metric which is trivial in @xmath21 coordinates .",
    "it is also good idea to rewrite the laplacian in terms of gauge angular momenta @xmath43 : @xmath44 and physical angular momentum @xmath45 since their action on states with given gauge and rotational properties is simple .",
    "in particular , the ( bosonic ) ground state should have total spin equal to zero and be gauge invariant .",
    "all angular momenta are killing vectors of the metric .    in appendix [ applaplace ]",
    "we derive the lagrangian expressed in terms of gauge invariant variables and angular momenta @xmath46 here @xmath47 @xmath48 is a compact notation for the ( physical and gauge ) angular momenta defined above .",
    "furthermore , we have defined @xmath49 and @xmath50 @xmath51    to find the ( bosonic ) ground state we will find all gauge invariant states with spin zero .",
    "the first state is the vacuum state @xmath52 .",
    "then we may act with the fermionic creation operators @xmath53 on the vacuum to find new states .",
    "the following states has total spin zero and they are gauge invariant @xmath54 that is , they satisfy @xmath55 the most general gauge invariant wavefunction with total spin zero can then be written @xmath56 it would also possible to construct the superpartner ground state with the help of @xmath57    now we study what happens when we act with the laplacian ( [ laplacian ] ) on this wavefunction and using the result we write the hamiltonian matrix in this base . let us start with second part of the laplacian which is the relevant bosonic piece @xmath58 where @xmath59 is only on the gauge indexes .",
    "finally the fermionic interaction in the hamiltonian gives us @xmath60 so the full hamiltonian matrix elements are @xmath61 where @xmath62 notice that the hamiltonian we have obtained is the same as in @xcite but differs from the one used in @xcite .",
    "this section gives an overview of solving the hamiltonian eigenvalue problem ( [ toy ] ) using the numerical renormalized numerov method @xcite . with it",
    "one can solve for the discrete spectra of a one dimensional operator of the form @xmath63 which acts on @xmath64\\otimes{\\bf c}^n$ ] with dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "however , our hamiltonian depends on the _ two _ coordinates @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( the other coordinates , the angles , are fixed by the requirement that we are studying only gauge invariant states with spin zero ) .",
    "the `` kinetic '' term in our hamiltonian ( i.e. the term which contains the derivatives ) is @xmath65 and we see that it is naively not of the form required above . let us sketch briefly how to modify our problem to be able to apply the method .",
    "an arbitrary wavefunction can be written in the form @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a complete basis of functions ( with apropriate boundary conditions ) in @xmath38 ( the explicit choice of basis does not have to be the same for different values of the index @xmath24 but can be chosen to optimize the numerics ) .",
    "the functions @xmath68 ( which we will compute by the numerov method ) one can think of as being `` combination coefficients '' depending continuously on @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath69 is the standard base spanning @xmath70 , in our case it is the four dimensional complex vector space on which the hamiltonian matrix acts . choosing a concrete basis depends only on the hamiltonian domain which depends on one of the selfconjugated extensions of the hilbert space ( an extension of the hilbert space such that the hamiltonian operator is hermitian ) but we will rather apply a physical principle which will be described later .",
    "the expectation values of the hamiltonian in the base @xmath71 gives the same number of coupled equations for the radial part as the number of @xmath72 in ( [ state ] ) .",
    "thus the problem is now correctly defined and the matrix representation of the expectation value of the hamiltonian in the basis above forms the potential which is used in the one dimensional hamiltonian ( [ op ] ) . to get @xmath73 in the kinetic term we have to orthonormalize the base .",
    "furthermore , to be able to use the numerov method on a computer we need a finite basis which means that we need to `` cut off '' or restrict the base to be finite .",
    "the rescaling of the wavefunction @xmath74 by the factor @xmath75 transforms the radial part of ( [ kinetic ] ) to the operator @xmath76 and changes boundary condition to dirichlet .",
    "let us now describe the physical principle we use to choose the basis functions @xmath77 for our hamiltonian ( [ toy ] ) .",
    "we define the wavefunction on the interval @xmath78 $ ] ( [ domain ] ) .",
    "it is not necessary to choose this particular interval , one could , for instance , select the interval @xmath79 $ ] instead of the above mentioned .",
    "using the identification @xmath80 the hamiltonian defined on the interval @xmath81 $ ] acting on states with total spin zero is connected to our original hamiltonian on the interval @xmath78 $ ] by the unitary transformation @xmath82 where @xmath83 it is also possible to consider other interval @xmath84 $ ] . using the identification @xmath85 the corresponding hamiltonian can be also obtained by a unitary transformation with the matrix @xmath86 the wavefunctions of course also transform under the unitary transformation @xmath87 if we require that the wavefunctions be everywhere smooth , the above condition severely restricts the possible wavefunctions and in particular the basis wavefunctions that we can use .",
    "we note that this principle was not used in @xcite and hence the @xmath38 derivative of their groundstate wavefunction at @xmath88 is not well defined .    for the bosonic part of the wavefunction we will use the basis states @xmath89 and for the fermionic part we will use @xmath90 they nicely cancel the divergences in the hamiltonian coming from the laplacian .",
    "of course these basis functions satisfy the boundary condition above and they also form a complete basis for the functions with the given boundary conditions . however , the basis is not orthonormal due to the non trivial @xmath38 part in the measure ( [ measure ] ) .",
    "so we need to orthonormalize these basis functions to get @xmath73 in ( [ op ] ) .",
    "doing so , using the gramm - schmidt procedure , we diagonalize the @xmath38 part of the laplacian .",
    "notice that these two sets of basis functions also correspond to the bases which are implicitly used in the wosiek method @xcite when one are doing calculations with states with total spin zero ( the basis functions above depend on the total spin ) .",
    "this will be shown in section [ comparison ] .",
    "thus we will be able to compare our results and our method very directly with the results obtained by the wosiek method @xcite .",
    "it is not obvious how much our results for a fixed number of basis functions fit the exact solutions which one would get using the complete basis .",
    "to get some intuition for how the general solution would look like we will repeat the calculations increasing the number of basis functions each time and hopefully one can extrapolate the result to the exact case .",
    "at least we should be able to make an intelligent guess at the properties of the exact solution .    to study the groundstate of our hamiltonian ( which ,",
    "because of supersymmetry , should have energy zero @xcite ) is a good test for the method described above .",
    "there are some results for coupling constant @xmath91 in the table [ tab ] ( p. ) where @xmath0 is the number of the test functions ( [ boson],[fermion ] ) and @xmath92 is their corresponding groundstate energy .",
    "the dependence of the energy on the number of functions we include in the basis given in the last two columns of the table is as follows @xmath93 as was claimed in @xcite , one can therefore predict the groundstate energy as a function of the number of basis functions with very high accuracy .",
    "we therefore see that in any concrete numerical calculation ( using a finite basis ) we do not expect to get zero energy .",
    "only in the ( numerically unobtainable ) case of infinite basis do we get zero energy .",
    "the picture ( fig . [ picden ] ) is the probability density for the case with the highest number of basis functions in the table .",
    "the following two pictures show the bosonic contribution coming from ( [ boson ] ) and the fermionic one coming from ( [ fermion ] ) .",
    "the domain of these plots is @xmath94\\times[-\\pi/4,\\pi/4]$ ] .",
    "the hill of the probability density is located at the boson potential valley ( [ potential ] ) and isolines represents sections for fixed @xmath37 , @xmath38 and one for fixed density on each picture .",
    "the maximum of the probability density of any constant @xmath37 section is in the potential valley ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "notice that the global maximum is not at @xmath96 .",
    "this is probably an effect of the fermion pauli repulsion which can be seen from the purely fermionic contribution to the probability density which is zero at @xmath96 .    increasing the number of basis functions",
    ", the only thing that happens is that the global maximum moves slowly to larger and larger @xmath37 at the same time as the whole wavefunction becomes more spread out in @xmath37 but more peaked in @xmath38 .",
    "one can expect that considering the complete base ( [ base ] ) the ground state density will be the same near the origin as in the picture and also will have the hills on the valleys of the potential which will be sharper and sharper when we follow the potential valley to large @xmath37 .",
    "one can not conjecture in this case the behavior of the hills by this numerical method .",
    "rather one has to use other methods @xcite for the asymptotic behavior of the wavefunction at large @xmath37 .",
    "here we briefly review the body of paper @xcite where a different approach to solving the eigenvalue problem of a hamiltonian is given .",
    "the main idea is to choose a finite subset of a complete basis of the hamiltonian hilbert space and then find the combination which minimizes the lowest lying energy for instance .",
    "a lot of hamiltonians have the form ( [ op ] ) which can be easily rewritten in terms of the harmonic oscillator @xmath97 creation and annihilation operators @xmath98 . this is true even in the case where the potential @xmath99 is not quadratic .",
    "the complete base above is formed by eigenvectors of this linear harmonic oscillator which are constructed by creation operators acting on the vacuum .",
    "if we choose a finite subset of this basis , calculating hamiltonian matrix elements is very easy .    in the harmonic oscillator hamiltonian ( [ hamosc ] ) which we used to define the basic creation and annihilation operators",
    "there is an arbitrary parameter @xmath100 in the potential which we may use to optimize the numerics .",
    "the option to use @xmath100 to optimize the calculations was invented by us and should be regarded as suggestion for an improvement of the method presented in @xcite .",
    "concretely we will do it like this : first we choose a subset of the basis functions , we then compute the energy ( or whatever else we would like to calculate ) for different values of @xmath100 .",
    "we then find the value of @xmath100 which gives the minimum value for the energy .",
    "it turns out that it is much more effective to minimize the energy in terms of @xmath100 than to try to use a larger basis since the computer time used for a calculation increases exponentially with the number of basis functions included .",
    "there is one extra complication in our problem . because of the gauge symmetry one should also restrict the basis to include only gauge invariant states .",
    "the generalization to the fermionic part and to the higher dimensional problem is straightforward .",
    "let us illustrate the method above on our hamiltonian .",
    "first of all we have to form all gauge invariant states which can be obtained by acting with a combination of creation operators on the vacuum .",
    "the @xmath8 algebra has only two tensors which can form scalars from vectors @xmath101 these vectors are formed by creation operators @xmath102 and a combination of them has to be contracted in gauge indexes with the special tensors above to get a gauge scalar .",
    "let us write all non zero fundamental possibilities @xmath103 where any combination of them acting on a gauge invariant state gives also a gauge invariant state .",
    "one has to start with the vacuum to generate all gauge invariant state .",
    "however , if we are looking for the groundstate we are interested only in states which can form a state with total spin zero . that is only states which consist of the fermion vacuum or two creation fermion operators acting on it because these are the only cases where the fermionic contribution to the total angular momentum can be canceled by the bosonic angular momentum .",
    "so using the operators @xmath104 acting on @xmath52 and on the fermion states @xmath105 gives the appropriate complete basis for our hamiltonian .",
    "choosing a finite subset of the basis states allows us to calculate matrix elements of any operator on the computer .",
    "it is a good idea to orthonormalize the states in the basis to avoid problems in the eigenvalue calculation when the metric is non trivial .",
    "see the next section for the explicit form of first few states in the basis .",
    "we are able to illustrate the effect of the optimized @xmath100 now .",
    "let us show what happens with the ground state energy when we calculate with fixed @xmath100 but with different coupling constants @xmath106 $ ] in our hamiltonian ( [ toy ] ) . in this calculation",
    "we have chosen the restriction of the basis to include up to six creation operators in the bosonic basis and up to five creation operators in the fermion part .",
    "the result is given by the dotted line in the figure [ zeta ] .",
    "it seems that the energy of the ground state _ diverges _ when the coupling constant goes to zero which is clearly wrong !",
    "the way out of this dilemma is to remember that we also have the parameter @xmath100 at our disposal .",
    "if we for each @xmath107 use the @xmath100 which gives the minimal energy , we get the dependence of the ground state energy on the coupling constant as drawn in bold line .",
    "this is clearly consistent with the @xmath108 dependence one expects from dimensional arguments .",
    "this is a very nice illustration of the power of our suggestion for improving the wosiek method @xcite by including the @xmath100 parameter .",
    "one can guess that there has to exist a coupling constant such that the optimalization is not needed .",
    "this is also viewable from the picture .",
    "there are also some results for coupling constant @xmath91 in the ( tab .",
    "[ tab ] , p. ) where the meaning of the columns is described above the table .",
    "the energy of the bold line for @xmath91 corresponds to the first two columns in the table for the highest order obtained by the wosiek method .",
    "we draw the density plot ( fig .",
    "[ figw ] . ) for this calculation on which we can see the bump which for a larger number of basis functions develops into the long and thin hill in the picture on page .    its domain is @xmath109\\times[-\\pi/4,\\pi/4]$ ] .",
    "to compare our method with the wosiek method it is important to know the correspondence between the base ( [ boson],[fermion ] ) and the base formed by creation operators .",
    "since we have written our hamiltonian in terms of angular momentum operators it is useful to classify all states in terms of angular momenta .",
    "in fact , this is even more useful since when we are discussing the ground state with total spin zero .",
    "we may rewrite the angular momentum operator ( [ momentum ] ) as @xmath110 using the correspondence between creation / annihilation and @xmath111 operators @xmath112 let us write down how the lowest lying angular momentum states look like .",
    "first we do the purely bosonic sector .",
    "the ( zero angular momentum ) ground state @xmath113 in the coordinate representation looks like @xmath114 next we can write down all gauge invariant states created by two bosonic oscillators .",
    "@xmath115 the following linear combinations @xmath116 are orthonormal eigenvectors of the angular momentum operator with eigenvalues @xmath117 . using formulas for the creation / annihilation operators in the @xmath118 representation we may write the coordinate representation of these states as @xmath119",
    "the angular momenta spectrum of the next six states all formed by four creation operators is @xmath120 where the two orthonormal states with zero angular momenta are given by @xmath121 they give the first non trivial wave function dependence on @xmath38 in the zero angular momentum sector .",
    "the @xmath38 part in higher order states with zero angular momenta reproduce the basis ( [ boson ] ) which we guessed as the fourier basis for the functions with the correct boundary conditions .",
    "we see that a new @xmath122 appears when there appears a new @xmath123 in the angular momenta spectrum .    for reference",
    "we also give the spectra for the states created by six and eight creation operators @xmath124 and @xmath125 . with this",
    "we close the discussion about the purely bosonic part .    in the same way we can study the fermionic part .",
    "the wave function that interest us most are the ones with angular momentum one since they are the ones which contribute to the ground state with total angular momentum zero . on the lowest level in the creation / annihilation operator basis",
    "we have two gauge invariant orthonormal states @xmath126 they can be combined into the orthonormal states @xmath127 which are eigenstates of angular momenta with eigenvalues @xmath128 .",
    "it is again possible to rewrite these states in the coordinate basis with help of the orthonormal and gauge invariant purely fermionic states ( [ states ] ) as @xmath129 the @xmath38 part of the second state gives the first function in the basis ( [ fermion ] ) .",
    "the states in the next level consisting of the six states we get by acting with all gauge invariant combinations of two bosonic creation operators on the previous two states have angular momentum spectrum @xmath130 where the two orthonormal states with angular momentum one are given by @xmath131 this agrees with the second function in our fermionic basis .",
    "continuing we find that the @xmath38 part of the angular momentum one states at higher levels reproduce the basis ( [ fermion ] ) which we have used .",
    "writing the angular momentum spectrum for the next level ( states obtained by acting with all gauge invariant combinations of four bosonic oscillators on the original fermionic states ) we have @xmath132 .",
    "this closes the discussion about the fermionic part and again gives a hint how the general spectrum looks like .",
    "we have now achieved our main goal to rewrite the states in the wosiek method in terms of angular momentum eigenstates in order to be able to compare the two methods . since we now know at what level a particular basis function appears in the wosiek method , we know where we should `` cut off '' the set of basis functions used in our method in order to get an equivalent calculation .",
    "furthermore , doing the calculation using the two different methods at the same level we should still expect that our method should give better results since in our method the radial part of the wave function is not a priori fixed while in the wosiek method the radial part comes together with the angular part , see for instance ( [ fixed ] ) .",
    "also , our method should be more effective for fixed spin calculation on the computer since we have the possibility to use only the angular momentum eigenstates we need while in the wosiek method one is using all possible states which leads to a huge number of states not contributing to the wavefunction but absorbing space and time in the computer .    to illustrate this we compose the following table .",
    ".results [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we compare the ( improved ) wosiek method with @xmath133 boson and fermion creation / annihilation states of the type ( [ first],[second ] ) with our method using only the test functions ( [ boson],[fermion ] ) to the corresponding level for @xmath91 .",
    "the @xmath100 given in the table is the optimized value for the ( improved ) wosiek method , the @xmath0 counts the number of the test functions corresponding to the level used in the wosiek method and the groundstate energies obtained by both methods are also given .",
    "we see that indeed the energy calculated using our method is lower than in the wosiek method .",
    "furthermore it is clear that the number of states used in the wosiek method increases uncontrollably as compared to the increase of basis functions used in our method .",
    "finally we also compare probability density sections for @xmath95 in the case of the third line in the table ( the last case where both methods have been used ) on the domain @xmath134 $ ] .",
    "the states which generate these sections have the same norm to compare them correctly .",
    "we have also included higher order wave functions calculated using our method .",
    "the labels indicate which order they correspond to .",
    "these wave functions are not equally normalized but have rather been chosen to have the same value at @xmath96 in order to illustrate the behavior of the wavefunction when the order is increased .",
    "we see that the maximum moves outwards at the same time as the wavefunction becomes wider .",
    "the aim of the present work was to find an approach how to calculate the boundstate of two 0-branes .",
    "this we have achieved with good results .",
    "in the course of our work we also found a way to improve the wosiek method but our method still gives better results .",
    "as this work was being completed the closely related paper @xcite by wosiek ( which improve his original method ) appeared .",
    "we have also calculated the groundstate probability density near the origin with high accuracy which gives a basic intuition about the physics of branes on the string scale .",
    "in particular about the meaning of the auxilliary coordinates which become important at small distances between the branes .",
    "it is for example interesting to observe that the most probable position of the branes is not on top of each other but rather at some small distance away from each other .",
    "this we understand as an effect of the pauli fermionic repulsion .",
    "it is possible to apply the method described here for branes in higher dimensional minkowski space .",
    "however there are a lot of complications which do not allow numerical results of high precision .",
    "namely , there are many more auxilliary coordinates in the higher dimensional case ( or in the case where there are more than two branes ) .",
    "since our basis functions are functions of the auxilliary coordinates , this implies that our basis functions will be multi dimensional functions and thus the number of components that the computer has to handle increases . naively speaking",
    "the number of effective radial wavefunction in the state computed by the numerov method for a given dimension is the number in our toy model raised to the power of the number of auxilliary coordinates .",
    "this fact of course taxes the computer very heavily .",
    "another important point that we wanted to study was how the branes behave in external ( generalized electric - magnetic ) fields .",
    "the potential coming from these background fields represents this interaction . however , our two dimensional toy model is too simple to display any interesting effects .",
    "again one would have to go to higher dimensional minkowski space to do be able to do some interesting calculations .    as a first attempt to go further it would therefore be nice to consider three dimensional minkowski space which would allow more general background fields which coming from other types of branes .",
    "however , we do feel that doing _ realistic _",

    "it is possible to decompose @xmath25 @xcite in matrix form as ( [ decomposition ] ) @xmath135 where @xmath27 is a group element in the adjoint representation of the gauge group and @xmath32 is a group element of the rotation group @xmath29 .",
    "the matrix @xmath33 is then gauge and rotation invariant .",
    "we may now choose our physical coordinates as @xmath136 together with @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the generator of spatial rotation @xmath139 the matrix @xmath27 which describes the gauge degrees of freedom is parametrized by euler angles @xmath28 @xmath140 where the matrices are generators of @xmath8 in the adjoint representation .",
    "@xmath141    the flat metric in the original @xmath142 coordinates is trivial and can be written in matrix notation as @xmath143 the decomposition ( [ decomposition ] ) leads to the expression @xmath144 and then the metric is @xmath145 we see here that the differentials in @xmath146 are not mixed with the other ones and thus the metric will be block diagonal @xmath147 where the @xmath148 block is associated with the @xmath146 differential and @xmath149 is associated with the differentials @xmath150 .",
    "now we compute the metric term by term .",
    "the @xmath33 part in the case of two branes is @xmath151 or explicitly in variables @xmath152 from ( [ rt ] ) @xmath153 next we take care of the terms which contribute to the @xmath149 part of the metric .",
    "using the fact that @xmath154 the purely gauge part @xmath155 can be written with help of the left - invariant one forms defined by the @xmath27 being a group element in the adjoint representation of @xmath8 @xmath156 where @xmath157 are the generators . in our coordinates",
    "we explicitly have the expressions @xmath158 introducing the matrix @xmath159 of the coefficient of the @xmath160 1-forms @xmath161 the gauge part ( [ gaugepart ] ) is @xmath162 where @xmath163 and the diagonal matrix @xmath164 has elements @xmath165 the calculation of the contribution from terms which contain @xmath166 is very similar . introducing the right - invariant one form defined by @xmath167 and using our parametrisation ( [ eta ] ) we have @xmath168 and @xmath169 in this expression it is necessary to write the @xmath170 ( [ leftforms ] ) explicitly . since we know that the metric is block diagonal ( [ diag ] ) we will write the @xmath149 part of the metric compactly",

    "so @xmath175 and the full metric is @xmath176    it is now easy to find the square root of the metric determinant @xmath177 which also gives us the integration measure . on the domain of @xmath178 @xmath179\\times(0,2\\pi ]",

    "the metric in the new coordinates is ( [ metric ] ) @xmath180 where @xmath174 , @xmath181 is defined by ( [ omega ] ) and @xmath182 by ( [ boldpi ] ) . from the metric or",
    "directly from ( [ expanded ] ) one can see that the metric has the block diagonal structure ( [ diag ] ) @xmath183 where @xmath148 is a diagonal matrix being the metric in the @xmath152 variables and @xmath149 is the metric in the other variables .",
    "thus we are able to calculate the inverse of the full metric in terms of the inverses of @xmath148 and @xmath149 separately .",
    "since @xmath148 does not depend on the gauge variables , the laplacian also splits into two pieces @xmath184 where the latin index runs over the @xmath185 variables and the greek indexes over the angular variables .",
    "using the square root of the metric determinant ( [ measure ] ) the first part of the laplacian generated by @xmath148 is @xmath186 at this point we would like to rewrite the second part of the laplacian in terms of the angular momenta ( [ momentum],[gaugemomenta ] ) @xmath187 we notice that the angular momenta are equal to the vector field @xmath188 being dual to the _ right _ invariant one form @xmath189 @xmath190 since the right invariant one forms induce left translations , they are killing fields of the metric . also , since we know the relation between the left and right invariant one forms @xmath191 we may transform the expression for the metric , which is expressed in terms of @xmath192 into an expression in terms of @xmath188 which is then equivalent to an expression in terms of the angular momenta .",
    "explicitly we write the vector field @xmath193 in terms of coefficient matrices @xmath194 inverse to the matrices @xmath195 introduced in ( [ omegadef ] ) . the relation ( [ lrrel ] ) then implies @xmath196 to treat all the angles on equal footing , we incorporate also the physical angle @xmath31 into this formalism by extending the three by three matrices @xmath197 to four by four matrices by putting @xmath198 in the `` zeroth '' row and column .",
    "these new matrices we denote by bold letters , for instance @xmath199 now all vector fields obtained from @xmath200 are equal to @xmath201 times the physical and the gauge angular momenta and they are all killing vectors of the metric",
    ". we can now write @xmath202 ; @xmath203 .",
    "we may now rewrite the angular part of the laplacian in terms of the angular momenta which are given by @xmath204 .",
    "the appropriate part in the laplacian is @xmath205 first we expand the formula for the laplacian @xmath206 the first term is reduced to @xmath207 where we have used the killing equation for @xmath208 . in the same way the second term becomes @xmath209 and",
    "finally the third part is @xmath210 so the sum of these three contributions gives @xmath211= -({\\bf\\psi\\pi}^{-1}{\\bf\\psi}^{-1})_{\\mu\\nu}l^\\mu l^\\nu\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used that the angular momenta are defined in terms of the matrix @xmath200 .",
