    "despite more than 20 years of study , the majority of bright , high energy @xmath5ray sources along the galactic plane have yet to be identified with lower energy counterparts . with the life of the egret instrument on cgro now over , nearly 300 sources have been detected and catalogued above 100 mev . at high galactic latitudes ( @xmath6 ) ,",
    "approximately 70 - 90 of these sources have been identified with a sub - class of radio - loud active galactic nuclei ( agn ) called blazars @xcite . at low latitudes ( @xmath7 ) ,",
    "7 - 8 sources have been identified as young , rapidly spinning pulsars .",
    "in addition , there is a source associated with the lmc , and a detection of a solar flare .",
    "the rest of the sources have no firm identifications , but can be split into at least three components .",
    "first , there is an isotropic component which is likely to consist largely of blazars with slightly lower radio fluxes than the ones already identified ( since most of the brightest sources have already been identified ) .",
    "there is an excess of sources at mid - latitudes ( @xmath8 ) , making up a second component , which has been suggested to be associated with the gould belt @xcite , with some indication of an additional component associated with the galactic halo .",
    "finally , there is a population which is highly concentrated along the galactic plane , and is our main concern here .",
    "spectral studies @xcite suggest a need for additional source classes .",
    "in particular , there are many sources with steeper spectra ( photon index @xmath9 ) between 100 mev and 1gev than is expected for either a pulsar or a blazar .",
    "in addition , variability studies @xcite indicate an excess of variable sources at low galactic latitudes .",
    "since pulsars are not thought to be variable , this would suggest an additional class of galactic sources .",
    "however , for any individual source to represent a new source class , it would first have to be demonstrated that it is not a blazar , which are highly variable .",
    "the main obstacle to identification has been the large positional uncertainties of the sources .",
    "low counting rates combined with a broad , energy - dependent point - spread function ( psf ) produce typical 95% error contour sizes of @xmath10 .",
    "additional problems are encountered in the galactic plane , where sources are often confused and the diffuse background is strong .",
    "background models are based on radio maps which are not sensitive to small scale structure , causing additional uncertainty . however , the galactic background spectrum steepens at energies above 1gev and the egret psf narrows with increasing energy .",
    "therefore , sources with significant counts above 1 gev are less prone to the systematic positional errors associated with sources in the galactic plane _ if _ the improved resolution of the high energy photons is included in the analysis .",
    "unfortunately , the standard analysis of egret data uses a binned likelihood approach , where all the photons are assumed to have the same psf derived by averaging over the energy range using an assumed spectrum , so the additional information to be gained from the photon energy is lost . in the third egret catalog @xcite , this issue was partially addressed by the generation of liklihood test statistic maps for positional determination in three energy ranges : @xmath11 mev , @xmath12 mev , and @xmath13 mev , and the map that gave the best positional determination was used ( in the case of some of the stronger sources , the @xmath12 mev and @xmath13 mev maps were combined ) .",
    "however , the source candidate list used was generated only from the @xmath11 mev maps .",
    "the purpose of this work is to begin the process of systematically identifying potential low energy counterparts of the unidentified @xmath5ray sources ( for a more thorough treatment of one source , gev j1417 - 6100 , see roberts and romani 1998 ; roberts et al .",
    "1999 ; roberts 2000 ) . to start",
    ", we note a few observational facts about the known source classes .",
    "first , they all emit non - thermal x - rays .",
    "the blazars are moderately bright ( @xmath14 ergs @xmath15 in the 2 - 10 kev band ) x - ray point sources with power law spectra .",
    "they are also bright ( @xmath16 jy at 5 ghz ) , compact , radio sources .",
    "their emission is highly variable at most wavelengths .",
    "pulsars can be faint(@xmath17 ergs @xmath18 ) or bright ( @xmath19 ergs @xmath18 in the case of the crab ) sources of non - thermal x - rays .",
    "the magnetospheric component of this flux is strongly pulsed .",
    "additional x - ray and/or radio emission may come from a surrounding wind nebula .",
    "there may also be a thermal x - ray component from the pulsar surface or a surrounding snr .",
    "pulsars tend to have very steady emission at most wavelengths ( save for the pulsations ) .",
    "there are several other proposed sources of gev emission , most notably supernova remnants accelerating particles through shocks with either the interstellar medium or a nearby molecuar cloud ( cf .",
    "pohl and esposito 1998 ) .",
    "the particle spectrum predicted by these models could produce significant synchrotron emission in the x - ray region , depending on the age of the snr and on the magnetic field and density of the snr and surrounding region .",
    "non - thermal x - ray emission has been observed in the snr ic443 @xcite , suggesting it as a potential source of this class . however",
    ", this class of objects would not be expected to produce variable emission unless the site of the shock was highly localized , and the ability to separate this emission from potential emission from an embedded pulsar is generally not possible without better @xmath5 ray resolution . other suggested sources of particle acceleration through shocks , such as interacting winds of massive binary stars @xcite , or the wind off of a supermassive star @xcite ,",
    "would also be likely to produce hard x - ray emission at some level .",
    "the more localized nature of the emission would make variable emission feasible .    another proposed source class of @xmath20-ray emission is isolated rotating black holes accreting from the interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "this class is attractive since it is expected to be variable on all time scales .",
    "however , the emission mechanisms are not well developed , and predictions of the ratio of x - ray to @xmath20-ray emission are hard to make .",
    "several studies @xcite have shown the galactic unidentified egret sources to be associated with regions of star formation .",
    "in particular , the distribution of low latitude egret sources is strongly correlated with snr and ob associations , which supports the above proposals for new source classes . however",
    ", young pulsars are also found near snr and ob associations , so the statistical studies in and of themselves do not require the existence of a new source class . from an observational viewpoint , since the sources are near regions of star formation , they are likely to be even more heavily obscured by gas than is typical for sources in the galactic plane .",
    "this reinforces the need for x - ray observations above 2 kev .    in order to search for ( or rule out ) potential counterparts , we have obtained observations of the brightest gev sources with the asca satellite @xcite .",
    "we will primarily focus on the gas imaging spectrometer instruments ( gis2 and gis3)@xcite , whose good sensitivity out to 10 kev and large field of view ( 44 ) are well suited for finding potential counterparts .",
    "we base our source selection on the gev source catalog of lamb and macomb ( 1997 , hereafter lm ) . through a combination of archival and new pointings",
    ", we have obtained asca gis images of every field containing a source with a @xmath5ray flux above 1 gev greater than @xmath21 , and all but 1 of the unidentified sources ( gev j1814 - 1228 ) and 1 blazar ( pks 1622 - 297 ) with fluxes above @xmath22 .",
    "this flux limit corresponds to the  bright \" sources of lm . while most of these sources are also listed in the third egret ( 3eg ) catalog @xcite , several are not , even though they are quite significant at gev energies .",
    "the 3eg catalog is based on sources found to be significant in a binned likelihood analysis of all photons above 100 mev detected by the egret telescope , while lm used only those photons above 1gev . of the unidentified sources in this study , the gis fields cover @xmath23 of the @xmath24 error contours , and virtually all of the @xmath25 contours .",
    "the coverage of each individual source is listed in table  [ obstab ] .",
    "this focus on sources with significant gev emission will tend to select out pulsar candidates , which are expected to have relatively flat @xmath5ray emission out to several gev ( cf .",
    "romani 1996 ) .",
    "it also limits the number of potential unidentified blazars in the survey .",
    "of the 30 sources in lm that make our flux cut , only 6 are at galactic latitudes @xmath26 , 5 of which are known blazars .",
    "our expectation of the number of additional blazars in the survey is @xmath27 .",
    "the lm catalog was derived solely from the @xmath28 gev count maps .",
    "however , nearby sources which are significant in @xmath29 mev maps but not in the gev maps can still produce enough gev photons to bias a position towards the softer source if it is not included in the fit .",
    "in addition , the elliptical fit to the @xmath24 error contour is often not a good approximation .",
    "therefore , we feel the lm localizations are not adequate in many cases .",
    "most of the gev sources are in the 3rd egret catalog , and for many of these , we have used the likelihood test statistic ( ts ) maps available from the on - line catalog to generate the positional contours on our images .",
    "most of the maps used are based on 1gev and above photons . in four cases ( gev j0008 + 7304 , gev j0241 + 6102 , gev j1837",
    "- 0610 , and gev j1856 + 0115 ) we used the @xmath30mev positional contours which were fully consistent with the gev contours , but better constrained .",
    "several sources are not in the 3eg catalog , mis - identified , have only low - energy maps , or are near sources not in the 3eg catalog ( such as in the cygnus region ) . for these we generated new ts maps , using the _ like _ program of john mattox and joe esposito ( jaelike5.49 , mattox et al .",
    "1996 ) , on maps of 1gev and above photons .",
    "we included in the fits all nearby sources in the 3@xmath31 list ( courtesy r. hartman ) which was used to create the 3rd egret source catalog .",
    "the fluxes derived from these fits are systematically lower than in lm , since a portion of the gev photons may be assigned to the softer sources which were not included in the lm fits . where we have refit the data , we use the fluxes derived from those fits .",
    "otherwise , we use the lm values .",
    "these are listed in table  [ multab ] . as a consistency check ,",
    "we have also examined the ts maps of @xcite , which only included sources which had a @xmath32 significance in the gev maps for the positional fits . in general , the fits were similar except for noticable changes in contour shape of some of the sources with soft sources nearby , as expected .",
    "the 3eg catalog lists photon spectral indices , and for those sources with firm 3eg ids ( see table  [ obstab ] ) , we have included those values in table  [ multab ] .",
    "all of the 3eg sources were searched for variability by tompkins ( 1999 ) , using the @xmath33 statistic , which is the standard deviation of the flux divided by the average flux , and hence a measure of how variable a source is ( as opposed to the more usual @xmath34 test , which measures how inconsistent a source s flux is with being constant ) .",
    "the individual flux measurements used to determine @xmath33 were derived from 3 parameter fits to the entire unbinned likelihood distribution of the flux above 100 mev .",
    "a flux was derived for each viewing period ( @xmath35 two weeks ) where the source was within @xmath36 of the pointing center .",
    "therefore , the timescale of the variability probed is @xmath37 month  @xmath38 years .",
    "the pulsars all tend to have @xmath39 , consistent within systematic uncertainty with 0 , while blazars tend to @xmath40 .",
    "extreme caution should be used when interpreting the variability of sources in crowded regions , since the likelihood analysis may occasionally misassign photons , resulting in time bins with anomolously high or low fluxes . in addition ,",
    "variability in a nearby source may result in an apparent variability of the source of interest . with these warnings ,",
    "the @xmath33 values , where available , are also listed in table  [ multab ] .",
    "table  [ obstab ] gives the observing parameters of all the fields in our survey .",
    "the observations were taken over several years , with differing exposure times .",
    "some of the archival observations had the gis in modes with limited spectral or spatial resolution and the imaging and spectral analysis was adapted accordingly . in a few cases ,",
    "the sis data were also used .",
    "ten of the images were obtained specifically for this campaign . in these cases ,",
    "the pointings were based solely on the gev positions .",
    "positional and spectral information on x - ray sources found in these fields are given in table  [ newfit ] .",
    "some of the pointings were based on lm97 values , and subsequent positional fits have resulted in a significantly shifted error contour .",
    "stellar sources with soft spectra are common in the plane , and can be quite bright below 2 kev , but are generally undetectable above 2 kev .",
    "in addition , the sources we are searching for are likely to be behind fairly high hydrogen column depths , and are expected to have hard , synchrotron spectra . to make these sources more apparent , we produce 2 - 10 kev images .    for this work , we used the standard rev 2 processed data .",
    "this only aspects the inner @xmath41 of the image , and region filters are applied to remove the calibration source and the outer edges where there is poor aspecting .",
    "processing was mainly done using the @xmath42 and @xmath43 packages available from the heasarc , while image compositing and display were done using the @xmath44 and @xmath45 packages available from the atnf @xcite .      as mentioned above ,",
    "our primary instruments for this work are the two gas imaging spectrometers on board the asca satellite .",
    "the effective area of these instruments is strongly dependent on both energy and position on the detector .",
    "if an exposure correction is not applied , broad diffuse artifacts will occur in the image from the general radial dependence of the instrument , with sharp features due to the grid support structure .",
    "the specific pattern is energy dependent and the artifacts tend to be stronger at higher energies .",
    "it is therefore necessary to create an exposure map based on the spectrum of the x - ray field . in principle , this could , and would , vary across the field from different sources at different positions . however , our primary purpose is the detection of sources above the relatively smooth galactic background .",
    "we therefore chose a relatively blank field at a typical galactic position to derive our field spectrum ( an observation of @xmath46 , which is at @xmath47 and has virtually no emission above 2kev , worked well for this purpose ) .",
    "note that this is not ideal for fields dominated by a large , extended source with a spectrum significantly different from the background , such as is the case of fields with a bright , thermal , snr .",
    "the ftool ascaeffmap was initially used to derive an efficiency map from this spectra based on ground calibrations of the detectors .",
    "this was then used in the ascaexpo tool created by eric gotthelf to build up an exposure map in sky coordinates by using the individual observations attitude file to calculate how much time each detector pixel would contribute to each sky pixel .",
    "when the resulting exposure map was divided into the image map , it was found to overcorrect the image in the center .",
    "there are two reasons for this .",
    "the first is that the gis detectors are sensitive to the particle background , which tends to be brightest towards the edges of the detector , in opposition to the exposure effects .",
    "we therefore used the night earth calibration observations with identical screening as our images , normalized their exposure , and ran it through ascaexpo to create sky particle maps with exposures identicle to the images .",
    "we used these to subtract off the particle contribution of the images , before applying exposure corrections .",
    "the second cause is the scattering of x - rays onto the detector from regions outside the field of view , which causes an apparent enhancement in the background towards the edges of the detectors .",
    "since we are interested in having as flat of a background as possible in order to be confident that any structure we see is real , we created an efficiency fudge map by subtracting the particle background from the deep blank sky images provided by the asca gof , dividing by our model efficiency map derived from the ascaeffmap tool , and then highly smoothing it to show only the broad effects of the scattered light .",
    "this fudge map was then multiplied by the original efficiency map which gave us a final detector efficiency map whose fine structure was based on the galactic plane spectrum , but which has broad structure to suppress scattered light from an assumed flat background .    one effect of the exposure correction on low count rate fields is the enhancement of noise at the edges of the fields where the exposure drops off suddenly .",
    "pixels containing photons will have apparent fluxes greatly exaggerated when divided by a relatively low exposure .",
    "this is especially noticeable if there is a source just outside the field of view , increasing the amount of light scattered onto the field edge . to minimize these edge effects",
    ", we trim the exposure maps so as to blank the image once the exposure drops below a threshold .",
    "even so , edge artifacts are still apparent in many of the images , so apparent emission near a field edge , even in composited images , should be viewed with skepticism .    the steps used to make an image are then as follows : 1 .",
    "create photon , particle background , and exposure maps ; 2 .",
    "subtract the background from the photon map ; 3 . sum the gis2 and gis3 photon and exposure maps , and , if there is more than 1 field , composite the photon maps and exposure maps separately ; 4 .",
    "trim the exposure maps ; 5 .",
    "divide the summed photon maps by the summed exposure maps to create intensity maps ; 6 . smooth the intensity maps with a @xmath48 pixel gaussian , which roughly corresponds to the @xmath49 core width of the psf .",
    "in addition , the coordinate offsets derived by @xcite to correct for the temperature dependent deviation in the attitude solution were applied .",
    "source positions for point - like sources were derived from centroiding .",
    "positional errors are dominated by systematic uncertainties , estimated to be about @xmath50 for sources within the central @xmath51 of the detector .",
    "sources toward the edges of the detector have additional uncertainties of @xmath52 as they approach the detector edge .",
    "we note these in table  [ newfit ] .",
    "the faintest sources may also have additional systematic errors due to source confusion .",
    "positions of extended sources are the center of the extraction regions used for spectral fitting , or of the peak emission if there is a significant peak .",
    "the images are shown in figure  [ image ] .",
    "a few sources are dominated by thermal emission from a bright supernova remnant , in which cases we also show 4 - 10 kev images .",
    "scattered light from very bright sources can contaminate fields over 1 degree away from the source , appearing as diffuse emission with linear features .",
    "two ( possibly three ) of the images are affected by this .",
    "( 2000 ) and dec .",
    "the contours are the    some of the archival data of fields containing pulsars were obtained in modes with low spatial resolution . in these cases ,",
    "sis images are shown .",
    "the fits images and efficiency maps are available on the web at http://astro.stanford.edu/@xmath35mallory/survey.html .",
    "many of the sources discovered are faint , and we want to ensure that detector artifacts are not mistaken for real sources . therefore , extra care has to be taken in spectral measurements .",
    "spectra were extracted from the brightest sources discovered in the images as indicated in the figures . since most of the sources are in the galactic plane , background regions were chosen , where possible , from within the same field .",
    "the 1999 version of the night earth observation files were used to subtract the particle background from both the source and background spectra .",
    "since the sensitivity is not constant over the field of view , a correction needs to be made in the background spectra . to do this",
    ", we determined the average 2 - 10 kev detector efficiency in the source and background extraction regions using the efficiency map used in the exposure corrections described above .",
    "we then scaled the background spectra ( after the night earth spectra was subtracted ) by the ratio of the background to source efficiency . to test",
    "how well this corrected for the dependence on detector region of the background spectra , we took four spectra from different regions of the detectors in the field of gev j1025 - 5809 and applied our corrections .",
    "we then fit both the faint ( @xmath53 ) and moderately bright ( @xmath54 ) sources in the field using each of the backgrounds in turn .",
    "all of the fits measured fluxes within @xmath55 of each other , and the derived spectra were all consistent .",
    "thus , we believe our method is adequate for deriving consistent flux measurements for the new sources in this survey independent of where on the detector the background was extracted .",
    "the spectra from the two gis detectors were then combined and fit with an absorbed power law model using the xspec package .",
    "the results are listed in table  [ newfit ] . the best fit parameters with @xmath56 multi - parameter error intervals are listed in the table .",
    "the flux measurements @xmath57 are of the absorbed 2 - 10 kev flux and have @xmath55 errors derived from single parameter fits of the normalization .",
    "if the source was too faint for a meaningful fit , an absorption column of @xmath58 and a spectral index of 2.0 was assumed in measuring the flux .",
    "table  [ multab ] lists all of the  bright \" sources from @xcite ( @xmath59 ph @xmath3 ) , with the names and x - ray fluxes of some of the more interesting counterpart candidates , and the @xmath5ray fluxes , spectral indices , and the @xmath33 variability statistic where available . in the cases where there is a bright , thermal snr in the field",
    ", we first fit the spectrum using a thermal plasma model , and then added a power law component with a spectral index of 2.0 to see if the fit improved and to provide upper limits on any non - thermal component .",
    "only the non - thermal flux limit is listed in table  [ multab ] . in cases where there was no obvious source ,",
    "the same fitting process was used to provide @xmath55 upper limits on the flux . in some cases of previously known objects , we quote values from the literature .    in order to compare the different sources , we calculated an x - ray to @xmath5ray energy  spectral index \" @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the photon flux above 1gev , which corresponds to the flux density at 1gev if a photon index of 2.0 is assumed , and @xmath62 is the x - ray power law normalization in photons @xmath63 , corresponding to the unabsorbed flux density at 1kev .",
    "this value is also listed in table  [ multab ] .",
    "we have split the sources into three categories .",
    "the first , the focus of this study , consists of sources which had previously not been associated with known sources of high energy emission ( such as supernova remnants , pulsars , or x - ray binaries ) .",
    "these fields were selected based upon @xmath5 ray source positions . in order to estimate the significance of the x - ray sources found in these fields , we use the log n - log s relationship of sugizaki ( 1999 ) derived from the asca galactic plane survey ( gps ) covering the area of @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "for each listed source found within or near the @xmath24 positional contour , we list in table  [ newfit ] the number of sources of that flux or greater expected to be found within the @xmath24 contour .",
    "note that many of the sources are at larger galactic latitudes and longitudes than the gps , and so this should be a fairly conservative estimate of the chance of random association .",
    "the second category consists of fields which were pointed at some previously known lower energy source , whose position is coincident with a gev error ellipse .",
    "the third category consists of gev sources which have positive identifications with a low energy counterpart ( i.e. a pulsar or a blazar ) .",

    "three other sources are in the low - variability , x - ray faint category : gev j1835 + 5921 , gev j1837 - 0610 , and gev j2020 + 4023 .",
    "gev j1025 - 5809 is in this category if the wolf - rayet star 1e1024.0 - 5732 , outside the @xmath24 positional contour , is not the gev source .",
    "in addition , if psr b1758 - 23 is the counterpart for gev j1800 - 2338 , it would also fall within this region .",
    "all of these sources in this category are good candidates for isolated pulsars , about half of which are coincident with radio pulsars .    in the x - ray moderate category , we have four snr .",

    "therefore , we do not see any indication of gev emission generated by snr shocking with the interstellar medium or molecular clouds , although we can not rule out this scenario .",
    "however , it should be noted that in some cases error contours produced from @xmath67 mev maps are consistent with regions of apparently shocked emission , and that several of the softer sources in the 3rd egret catalog are coincident with young snr .",
    "it therefore seems likely that snr produce high - energy @xmath5rays , but with a steeper spectrum than pulsars and blazars .",
    "three of the x - ray moderate candidates are binary systems .",
    "two , 1e1024.0 - 5732 and wr 141 , are wn5 - 6+o star systems whose hard x - ray emission is almost certainly due to shocks from colliding winds . with only @xmath89 known wn+o systems , and a viable emission mechanism , the coincidence of these two similar systems with gev sources is suggestive . neither source is strongly variable at @xmath5ray energies , although in the case of wr 141 the natural time scale of the binary period is shorter than the variability analysis is sensitive to .",
    "however , both of these sources can not be considered strong candidates since one is outside the 95% confidence contour and the other has another equally bright , and hence equally viable , x - ray point source consistent with the gev position .",
    "lsi+61 303 is another candidate , but in this case the particle acceleration mechanism is less clear .",
    "if the companion to the b star is a neutron star , the @xmath5rays could be produced through an accretion process , colliding winds , or even standard pulsation mechanisms .",

    "the vela pulsar is in the x - ray moderate , low - variability group .",

    "two sources are weak upper - limits on non - thermal flux hidden in thermal snr , and are therefore , if pulsars , likely to be x - ray faint . the best candidates for vela - like radio - quiet pulsars",
    "are therefore rxj0007.0 + 7302 in cta 1 , and src2 in gev j2020 + 3658 .",
    "src2 in gev j2035 + 4214 and the double source in gev j1907 + 097 are reasonable candidates among the sources with unknown variability .",
    "predictions of the majority of unidentified gev sources being radio - quiet , vela - type pulsars by some outer - gap models of pulsar emission ( eg . yadigaroglu and romani 1997 ) are therefore not well supported by the x - ray data .",
    "the most intriguing sources are the x - ray moderate , high variability unidentified sources .",
    "although consistent with the blazars in the survey , none have bright , compact radio sources coincident with the x - ray source .",
    "what is most remarkable is that all four sources in this category seem to contain extended , synchrotron nebulae .",
    "two of these , gev j1856 + 0115 and gev j1417 - 6100 , have nebulae associated with the high @xmath66 pulsars psr b1853 + 01 and the kookaburra pulsar psr j1420 - 6048 . the other two , gev j1809 - 2327 and gev j1825 - 1310 , are in star forming regions providing potential pulsar birth - sites , with the latter having as a secondary source candidate psr b1823 - 13 .",
    "gev j0008 + 7304 , the source associated with cta 1 which also has a synchrotron x - ray spectrum , shows indications of @xmath5ray variability and could also be included in this group .",
    "the most likely explanation for these sources are wind nebulae around young pulsars .",
    "the variability would indicate that a substantial fraction of the @xmath5ray flux is synchrotron / compton emission generated by particles in the pulsar wind . depending on the local magnetic field strength , the synchrotron cooling timescale could be on the order of a few months , similar to the variability time scale .",
    "de jager et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have suggested a similar explanation for a possible variation seen in the crab at 70 - 150 mev . if this is the case , the synchrotron spectrum would mostly dominate the lower energies , and the @xmath5ray pulse fraction should increase with energy until the pulsar emission cuts off at several gev .",
    "oka et al . ( 1999 ) propose that in the case of gev j1809 - 2327 , the @xmath5ray emission is bremsstrahlung photons from a pulsar wind colliding with target baryons in the molecular cloud lynds 227 . in this case",
