    "the problem of determining all possible periodic arrangements of molecules within a give space group frequently arises in the study of structure using x - ray diffraction and elastic neutron scattering .",
    "the resolution of this issue needs a thorough understanding of space groups .    a new method of deriving and listing the crystallographic space groups , introduced by rabson _ et .",
    "al .  _ and mermin ( rmrw )",
    "@xcite has simplified the derivation of space groups and made compact presentation possible .",
    "this has also unified the subjects of crystallography and quasicrystallography but , unfortunately , their techniques have not yet found widespread acceptance with researchers studying periodic structures in condensed matter physics .",
    "one reason for this may be that rmrw work in fourier space while the arrangement of molecules is easier to visualize in real space .",
    "we will restate the algebraic relations used by rmrw in real space language and use their technique to list the crystallographic space groups compactly in real space .",
    "we will then demonstrate our technique of using these algebraic relations to find molecular arrangements from these listings .",
    "typically , the orientation of molecules at low temperature in a molecular crystal is determined by elastic diffraction , either of x - rays or of neutrons .",
    "if a large amount of high quality data is available , there may not be a problem in determining the crystal structure using standard computer programs to carry out the refinement .",
    "however , a more delicate approach , one that we used with reference to c@xmath2@xcite and which also has been used for other fullerene systems@xcite is the following .",
    "for these systems , the orientationally disordered phase has been determined to be face - centered cubic ( fcc ) . at the ordering temperature , new superlattice reflections appear,@xcite indicating that the molecules develop long  range orientational order . from the outset,@xcite it was clear that the low temperature diffraction pattern had to be indexed with a simple cubic ( sc ) unit cell containing four orientationally inequivalent molecules .",
    "there was no suggestion that the centers of mass were no longer on an fcc lattice . to narrow down the possible structures , it was therefore sensible to ask the question : how can one arrange icosahedra on an fcc lattice such that the sc unit cell contains four molecules whose orientations are fixed?@xcite the determination of the allowed structures , led to an easy identification@xcite of the space group of c@xmath2 .",
    "this structure has been identified by several groups.@xcite more recently , with the suggestion@xcite of a complicated ( `` 2@xmath3 '' ) structure for @xmath4 ( based on a still larger unit cell ) , a variant of the question arose,@xcite namely , how to arrange icosahedra on fcc lattice sites such that there are eight molecules per fcc unit cell .",
    "( in this case , the fcc unit cell would have a lattice constant twice as large as that of the orientationally disordered lattice . )",
    "however , it is now generally agreed@xcite that such a structure is not an equilibrium phase of c@xmath2 .",
    "the method we used@xcite in this work was , inelegant , however .",
    "it involved an explicit search through the listings of the crystallographic space groups in the international tables of crystallography ( itc).@xcite the symmetries of all points in the unit cell are listed there , and , in principle , this information suffices to identify all allowed structures .",
    "a ) such a direct consideration of all possibilities is tedious , b ) in such an enumeration it is easy to overlook possible allowed space groups,@xcite and c ) the tables themselves are not very easy to use without some background in crystallography .",
    "one advantage of the technique given here is that it is completely algebraic and the algorithm is a constructive one , rather than one of exhaustive enumeration . also the method requires only an understanding of the symmetries of simple objects like the square , the cube , etc . in the course of this work , we have also become aware of some confusion concerning the proper formulation of this problem , associated with the question of what molecular distortions should or should not be considered in determining the allowed structures of molecular crystals .",

    "[ 3d ] we apply the technique to problem concerning @xmath1-dimensions molecular crystal , in particular those of h@xmath5 and c@xmath2 .",
    "a brief summary of our work is given in sec .",
    "[ summary ] . in the course of this work",
    "it is helpful to relist all the cubic space groups in the rmrw language .",
    "( the similar list extended to all noncubic space groups is also available.@xcite )",
    "in this and the next two sections we briefly review some of the basic facts concerning space groups and their characterization . in this",
    "we adapt the ideas of rmrw .",
    "the set of symmetries of a periodic array is the space group of that array .",
    "there are only a finite number of distinct space groups ( @xmath6 in @xmath0-dimensions , @xmath7 in @xmath1-dimensions ) .",
    "we will see that to specify a space group it is necessary to specify the lattice , the point group , and the translations associated with the generators of the point group .",
    "the meaning of these terms will be clarified in the following paragraph .    in @xmath0-dimensions ,",
    "a * bravais lattice * ( henceforth just a lattice ) is the set of points @xmath8 defined by , @xmath9 where @xmath10 comprise a linearly independent set of basis vectors and the @xmath11 are integers .",
    "such a vector @xmath12 is called a lattice vector . in @xmath13-dimensions",
    "there is a linearly independent set of @xmath13 basis vectors . from the definition",
    "it is obvious that all lattices have inversion symmetry ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the choice of basis vectors is not unique since any linearly independent set constructed from the @xmath15 can equally well be chosen as basis vectors .",
    "the obvious symmetries of any lattice are the translations by lattice vectors .",
    "the * nontranslational * symmetries , consisting of rotations , mirror planes , and combinations thereof , are the ones that specify a lattice uniquely .",
    "there are only a finite number of lattices with distinct symmetry , five in @xmath0-dimensions and fourteen in @xmath1 dimensions .",
    "for example , the square lattice of fig .",
    "[ sq ] is one of the five lattices in @xmath0-d .",
    "each of its points has the following symmetry elements in which the points itself remains fixed : @xmath16 , a mirror plane parallel to a crystallographic @xmath17 direction , @xmath18 , a mirror plane parallel to a diagonal , and @xmath19 , a @xmath20-fold rotation about an axis perpendicular to the plane .",
    "there are a total of eight elements in the symmetry group of the point , @xmath21 , @xmath16 , @xmath19 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , where @xmath21 is the identity and @xmath27 means a @xmath20-fold rotation is applied @xmath28 times .",
    "any symmetry group can be completely specified by a few elements of the group called the * generators*. for example , the symmetry group of the square , denoted @xmath29 , is completely specified by specifying the existence of the generators @xmath30 and the generating relations @xmath31 .",
    "in this paper we use the following conventions .",
    "vectors are always specified by their components along the lattice vectors . with the symbols for vectors ,",
    "a * superscript * represents the component of the vector and a * subscript * identifies a particular vector .",
    "for example , @xmath32 is the component of vector @xmath33 along the basis vector @xmath34 .",
    "a * superscript * on the symbol for a symmetry element represents the number of times the operation is carried out . for example , applying the mirror @xmath35 twice to any structure brings it back to its original state , or @xmath36 . the symbol @xmath37 is used to signify that the vectors on both sides of the symbol differ from each other only by a lattice vector , for example @xmath38 . finally , to avoid confusion with the operations in three dimensions",
    ", we will denote point group operations in two dimensions by capital letters and those in three dimensions by small letters .",
    "any periodic structure can be considered to be a decoration of a lattice and the obvious symmetries of such a structure are the translations of the structure by a lattice vector .",
    "the decorations preserve some of the non - translational symmetries of the lattice unchanged , while a few of these symmetries , of which say @xmath39 is an example , require an additional * non  lattice translation * , say @xmath33 , to remain as symmetries . some of the symmetries of the lattice may be completely lost . specifying the unbroken symmetries of the lattice along with the required accompanying non ",
    "lattice translation completely specifies the symmetry of the space group .",
    "all the nontranslational symmetries of the lattice that are * not * lost form the * point group * of the space group . obviously , if any @xmath33 is nonzero , the point group is not actually a subgroup of the space group . in the literature",
    "such space groups are called nonsymmorphic .",
    "consider the square lattice shown in fig .",
    "[ sq ] . decorating it as shown in fig .",
    "[ sqspace ] ( a ) leads to all the symmetry elements of the lattice being preserved .",
    "decorating the same square lattice with the pattern shown in fig .",
    "[ sqspace ] ( b ) leads to the mirror @xmath35 requiring the translation @xmath40 to follow it to get back the original structure .",
    "since none of the symmetries are lost completely , the point group of both structures is @xmath29 , the symmetry of the square .",
    "decorating the lattice as shown in fig .",
    "[ sqspacec ] leads to the loss of mirror symmetries .",
    "the point group of this structure is now the point group with only the @xmath20-fold rotations , @xmath41 or @xmath20 .",
    "these are the only distinct space groups with a square lattice .",
    "table [ t2dimage ] lists the effect of the symmetry elements of a square on the point @xmath42 .",
    "table [ tsqsg ] lists all the space groups with a square lattice and point group @xmath29 .",
    "these data will be used later .",
    "we now show that specifying the translations associated with the generators of the point group is enough to specify the translations associated with all the other elements of the point group . if the symmetry of a periodic structure is of the form @xmath43 , @xmath44 etc . , where @xmath43 means the action of the element @xmath39 is followed by a nonlattice translation @xmath33 and @xmath39 , @xmath45 etc .",
    "are the elements of the point group , then it is easy to show ( see appendix a ) that @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the translation associated with the element @xmath48 .",
    "( the operation @xmath48 is the operation @xmath45 followed by the operation @xmath39 . )",
    "this is called the * compatibility relation * or the * frobenius relation*@xcite in view of eq.[comp ] knowledge of the translations associated with the generators is enough to find the translations associated with all the elements of the point group .",
    "for example in fig .",
    "[ sqspace ] ( b ) we have @xmath49 . since @xmath50 we get from eq .",
    "[ comp ] @xmath51 .",
    "the symmetry axes of rotations and the mirror planes of a point group contain a point designated as the origin , which they leave invariant . in the space group operation , @xmath52 , the translation , @xmath33 , associated with the element @xmath39 of the point group is dependent on the choice , which is arbitrary , of the origin .",
    "for example , consider the structure shown in fig .  [ origin ] .",
    "its point group is @xmath53 , the point group of a rectangle .",
    "let us consider the translational part of the space group operations involving @xmath54 , a two  fold rotation about an axis perpendicular to the page and which passes through the origin and that involving @xmath16 , a horizontal mirror plane perpendicular to the plane of the paper passing through the origin .",
    "when the origin is at point o , then @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "in contrast , when @xmath57 is chosen as the origin then @xmath58 and @xmath59 . there exists a relationship between the translations associated with the elements with respect to the two origins .",
    "we use @xmath60 to denote the coordinates of the new origin with respect to the old one .",
    "the components of the vector are along the basis vectors of the lattice .",
    "when the origin is shifted by @xmath61 then the translations associated with the element @xmath39 change by @xmath62 which is obtained from the * origin shift * relation stated as , @xmath63 a proof of this relation is given in appendix [ aoshift ] .",
    "using the two relations of this section it is easy to derive all the space groups , as shown by rmrw @xcite .",
    "if , for the origin chosen , the translations associated with the elements @xmath64 are zero , that is , @xmath65 @xmath37 @xmath66 @xmath67 @xmath68 then the origin is said to have a * local * or * site * symmetry given by the group made up of @xmath64 .",
    "thus , the local symmetry of any site in the unit cell can be found by translating the origin to that site and then finding which symmetry elements have zero translations associated with them .",
    "this idea will be used frequently in this chapter .",
    "we go back to the structures in fig .",
    "[ sqspace ] ( a ) and fig .   [ sqspace ] ( b ) . in the structure ( a ) with the origin at a @xmath69 for all @xmath39 and",
    "thus this point has @xmath29 symmetry . in fig .",
    "[ sqspace ] ( b ) the sites , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , have @xmath41 as their site symmetry and the mirror , @xmath16 , acting on the object at , say @xmath70 , takes it to the object at @xmath71 .",
    "@xmath70 and @xmath71 are at @xmath72 with respect to each other .",
    "so , at @xmath70 and @xmath71 the element @xmath16 needs a translation @xmath73 associated with it to make it a symmetry of the structure .",
    "the point group @xmath29 has eight elements . in fig .",
    "[ sqspace ] ( b ) , @xmath70 has a site symmetry with four elements and there are two ( @xmath74 ) sites in the unit cell with the same symmetry and connected to each other by the mirror operation , @xmath35 .",
    "this suggests a general rule that is fairly easy to prove .",
    "let the point group be @xmath75 with @xmath76 elements .",
    "if we find a site with a local symmetry group @xmath77 of @xmath78 elements which is a subgroup of @xmath75 , then there must be @xmath79 such sites in the unit cell , where @xmath80 these sites are * equivalent * to each other , which means that any of these sites can be chosen as the origin for an equivalent description of the space group .",
    "the reason for the existence of these @xmath79 equivalent sites is that there are @xmath79 elements in @xmath75 such that @xmath81 if we want to construct a structure using objects with symmetry group @xmath77 so that it has the symmetry of the space group with point group @xmath75 , then each of the @xmath82 equivalent sites must be occupied by one of the objects oriented such that the symmetry group @xmath77 is preserved at the sites .",
    "obviously , the objects that can be placed at these sites must have the site symmetry , but they are allowed extra symmetry . in general , this extra symmetry will not be preserved in the actual structure .",
    "the simplest example of this is illustrated by placing spheres on an sc lattice .",
    "the surface of the undistorted sphere is defined , of course , by @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the radius of the sphere and @xmath85 is the distance from the center of the lattice point . when placed in the lattice",
    "the sphere will distort and its surface will have an expansion in terms of cubic harmonics : @xmath86 , where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are the usual spherical angular coordinates .",
    "the size and sign of the amplitude @xmath79 is determined by the elastic response of the sphere .",
    "we will refer back to this concept of molecular distortion frequently .",
    "in contrast , if one tries to put on a site an object which does not possess all the symmetry elements of the site , then the lattice must distort .",
    "for example , if the square lattice were to be decorated with , say , a rectangle ( with principal axes along the crystal axes ) , then the crystal would spontaneously distort into a rectangular lattice .",
    "consider the following situation in which it is assumed known that benzene ( or hexagonal ) molecules are situated on a square lattice .",
    "we will demonstrate our technique by answering the following question : is it possible to arrange molecules with fixed orientations so that the unit cell contains two molecules,@xcite and that the point group of this structure is @xmath29 ?",
    "for concreteness , one may think of this molecule as having extremely strong intramolecular bonds , so that it suffers at most an infinitesimal distortion when placed in the crystal .",
    "our construction of allowed structures relies on eq .",
    "( [ eps ] ) .",
    "if we want to have @xmath89 molecules per unit cell , we look for a site having a site symmetry group which is a subgroup of the symmetry of the molecule and which has @xmath90 elements , where we can then place the oriented molecule . in this case",
    "all molecules occupy sites which are equivalent in the sense mentioned after eq .",
    "( [ eps ] ) .",
    "it is also possible to occupy more than one set of equivalent sites , providing the total number of sites in all sets of equivalents sites is @xmath89 .",
    "having carried out a construction to obtain all such sites , it will be necessary to check a few constraints .",
    "first of all , since we imposed a condition on the locations of the centers of mass of the molecules , ( i. e. that the centers form a square lattice ) , we must check that the proposed structures satisfy this condition .",
    "less trivially , we must also check that the proposed structure does not have a higher symmetry than presupposed .",
    "having higher symmetry can mean that the unit cell is smaller than desired .",
    "( we will see this when we later deal with octagonal molecules . ) alternatively , when we consider the three dimensional case , we will find structures in which the value of a structural parameter is not fixed by symmetry . in that case",
    ", it often happens that for a special value of that parameter additional symmetry elements appear , in which case the point group has higher symmetry than in the generic case .",
    "we now determine the allowed arrangements of benzene molecules .",
    "the symmetry of benzene molecule belongs to the point group @xmath91 .",
    "( in this notation , which is discussed in appendix c , @xmath91 means that the molecule has a six  fold axis of symmetry perpendicular to its plane and it has two inequivalent mirror planes , the normals to which lie in the plane of the molecule .",
    "we treat the molecule as perfectly flat and thin , so that the additional mirror plane in the plane of the molecule is omitted as being irrelevant to the present discussion . )",
    "we have already discussed the @xmath0-d space groups with square lattice and point group @xmath29 in the preceding discussion and the space groups are listed in table [ tsqsg ] .",
    "@xmath29 has eight elements , so if we can find a site in the unit cell with a site symmetry group containing four elements , there must be two of them .",
    "this site symmetry group of four elements must also be a subgroup of the symmetry of the benzene molecule ( @xmath91 ) so that a molecule can be placed at each site without distorting the lattice .",
    "accordingly , we can only place hexagonal molecules on sites whose symmetry group is simultaneously a subgroup of that ( @xmath91 ) of the molecule and also a subgroup of the point group of the lattice . the symmetry group @xmath53 , ( the symmetry of a rectangle , generators @xmath92 , discussed in section [ rel ] ) satisfies the requirement of being a group with four elements which is a subgroup of both @xmath29 and @xmath91 . thus the problem has been transformed to that of finding sites in the unit cell of the two space groups with @xmath53 symmetry .",
    "there are two distinct ways of getting the subgroup @xmath53 from @xmath29 .",
    "we choose the @xmath0-fold rotation , @xmath54 , as one of the generators . for the other generator",
    ", we can choose either the mirror @xmath16 or the mirror @xmath18 .",
    "( choosing @xmath16 and @xmath18 as generators gives the full group @xmath29 . )",
    "we have two space groups with a square lattice and point group @xmath29 which we consider separately in the following subsections .      from the compatibility relation , eq .",
    "[ comp ] we can find the translations associated with all the elements , given the translations for the generators . with the origin at point",
    "[ sq ] , @xmath95 and @xmath96",
    ". then the translations associated with all the elements are zero .",
    "thus , @xmath55 . and @xmath97 .",
    "the origin has @xmath29 symmetry .",
    "if the origin is shifted by @xmath60 , then the new values ( indicated by primes ) of the translations associated with the elements are obtained from eq .",
    "( [ oshift ] ) as @xmath98 we consider the two choices for @xmath53 separately .",
    "the problem for this case boils down to this , is it possible to choose @xmath100 such that @xmath101 but @xmath102 ? if the answer is yes , then we have found sites whose symmetry group is @xmath53 , with generators @xmath54 , @xmath16 .    clearly , we may restrict @xmath103 and @xmath104 to satisfy @xmath105 . then to get @xmath106 , we must have @xmath107 or @xmath108 and @xmath109 or @xmath110 . to get @xmath111",
    "restricts us to the two possibilities : @xmath112 or @xmath113 .",
    "first consider the choice @xmath114 .",
    "this site has the desired symmetry , therefore we may place a benzene molecule here . since @xmath115 , the molecule has symmetry with respect to a mirror along the @xmath116axis .",
    "there are two choices ( which lead to equivalent structures ) , one of which is shown in fig . 5a .",
    "[ the other choice is obtained by applying a 90@xmath117 rotation to the hexagon at @xmath118 . ]",
    "having made the selection as in fig .",
    "5 for the molecule at @xmath118 the orientation of the other molecule may be determined by applying the space group operation @xmath119 .",
    "thereby we see that the orientation of the second molecule in the unit cell is as shown in fig .",
    "one can check that an equivalent structure is obtained by the choice @xmath120 .      in this case",
    "we try to make @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "it is easy to see in this case , @xmath122 implies that @xmath124 .",
    "thus it is impossible to find a structure satisfying our requirements .",
    "this means that the structure in fig .",
    "[ hex ] ( a ) is the only one allowed in this space group with 2 benzenes per unit cell .",
    "we follow the same procedures used for the previous space group , except here we have to do a little more work to find the translations associated with the elements of @xmath29 .    from eq .",
    "( [ comp ] ) and the fact that @xmath127 we have @xmath128 . using eq .",
    "( [ comp ] ) and the fact that @xmath50 , we find that @xmath129 .",

    "we try to make @xmath133 . but from eq .",
    "( [ tmp ] ) it is obvious that it is impossible to make @xmath134 . thus it is not possible to have a structure with two hexagons per unit cell that preserves @xmath16 as a local site symmetry .",
    "we now try to find sites with @xmath53 symmetry using @xmath135 as the generators . using the relations eq .",
    "[ d1 ] , [ d3 ] , and [ tpmp ] one may verify that choosing either @xmath136 or @xmath137 makes @xmath138 and makes @xmath139 .",
    "the structure , shown in fig .   [ hex ] ( b ) , is constructed for the case @xmath140 following the procedure outlined in the previous case .",
    "the other choice , @xmath141 , gives the same structure rotated by @xmath142 degrees about the @xmath0-fold axis through the origin ` @xmath143 ' .",
    "the procedures detailed above considered only the case when the molecules are placed in equivalent sites , defined in sec .",
    "in fact , in the above example it was not possible to place two hexagons on a square lattice on inequivalent sites . from an algebraic point of view , that would have required finding a group of 8 elements which was simultaneously a subgroup of the point group of the molecule and of the point group of the crystal .",
    "one may also see by inspection that the above solutions do not work . to visualize inequivalent sites , imagine painting the hexagons",
    "different colors , say , red and blue . in the above solutions ,",
    "such a difference causes the @xmath116 and @xmath144 axes in fig .",
    "[ hex]a to differ and the @xmath145 and @xmath146 directions in fig .",
    "[ hex]b to differ .",
    "( in the first case , one axis is parallel to a mirror line passing through the vertices of a blue hexagon , and the other axis is parallel to a mirror line passing through the vertices of a red hexagon . ) so in this case , the lattice will distort into a rectangular lattice .",
    "which axis becomes elongated depends on which color hexagon is easier to squash .    to illustrate an arrangement involving _ inequivalent _ sites ,",
    "consider putting two octagonal molecules per unit cell on a square lattice . in the most general case , which we will discuss later",
    ", we will allow the molecules to distort in response to their environment in the crystal .",
    "however , at first , we first consider the molecules to be perfectly rigid .",
    "we start by looking for arrangements of rigid octagons on equivalent sites on a square lattice . for this purpose",
    "we follow the procedure we used to place oriented hexagons : we look for sites which have a symmetry group having four elements and which is a subgroup of both @xmath29 ( the point group of the lattice ) and @xmath147 ( the point group of the molecule ) .",
    "following exactly the analysis for benzene , we have to determine the orientations of octagons which have mirror planes along the @xmath116 and @xmath144directions .",
    "there are two such orientations : one , used in panel ( a ) , in which the mirror planes cut the faces at their midpoints and ( b ) another in which the mirrors pass through a vertex .",
    "using this information we obtain the structures shown in panels ( a ) and ( b ) of fig .",
    "but since these structures index to a smaller unit cell , we reject them.@xcite note that , as in fig .",
    "[ hex ] , the orientations of the two molecules were assumed to be related by a symmetry operation .",
    "now we consider the possibility of occupying two inequivalent sites in the unit cell with oriented octagons . in this case",
    "we look for sites which have a symmetry group which is a subgroup of both @xmath29 and @xmath147 which contains eight elements .",
    "we will need two such sites , because according to eq .",
    "( [ eps ] ) each site in this case has only a single representative . in this case the two sites are not related to each other via symmetry .",
    "for the site symmetry group to be the full @xmath148 point group , we need to have that @xmath69 for all @xmath39 .",
    "this is only possible for the space group @xmath93 .",
    "inspection of eqs .",
    "( [ d1 ] )  ( [ d4 ] ) shows that the sites having this high symmetry are @xmath149 and @xmath150 , as one could have intuited . on each of these sites",
    "we may independently choose orientations of the octagon which are invariant under the operations of @xmath29 .",
    "that fixes the octagon to be oriented so that a line from its center to either a vertex or to the center of a face is parallel to a nearest neighbor direction .",
    "we thereby arrive at the structures shown in fig .",
    "however , the choices where the two sites are actually equivalent was found previously .",
    "they correspond to a unit cell with only one octagon and were therefore rejected . the choice ( c ) of fig .",
    "[ oct1 ] does correspond to two inequivalent octagons in the unit cell and is therefore is the desired structure .",
    "we wish to emphasize that there is no physical requirement that identical molecules should occupy crystallographically equivalent sites .",
    "so we now turn to a brief discussion of orientational potentials which give rise to a structure such as ( c ) of fig .",

    "is thus only one way to arrange octagons on a square lattice ( see panel c of fig . [ oct1 ] ) so that they belong to a space group having ( @xmath29 ) point group symmetry and have two molecules per unit cell .",

    "now let us see what happens when we relax the assumption that the molecules are perfectly rigid .",
    "we therefore consider the limit when all the intramolecular force constants are arbitrarily large , but are not actually infinite .",
    "it is clear that in this limit the @xmath152th molecule will distort in response to the crystal field , @xmath177 , of the square lattice . to see this analytically , we look at terms in the multipole expansion of eq .",

    "the second choice is @xmath280 and its cyclic permutations , which lead to icosahedra placed at the face centers .",
    "this choice , which yields a structure of space group pm@xmath281 , does satisfy our requirements .",
    "the other cubic point groups , @xmath143 , @xmath221 , and @xmath282 , lack inversion symmetry . since we have required the molecules to be placed on an fcc lattice , allowed structures must have inversion symmetry .",
    "( in a moment , we will discuss the extent to which this restriction can be relaxed . )",
    "so , unless we allow a molecular distortion which removes inversion symmetry , there are no allowable structures of these cubic point groups .",
    "now we address the question as to whether inversion symmetry should actually be required .",
    "we argue that removal of inversion symmetry requires a breaking of symmetry analogous to that we discussed in conjunction with eq .",
    "( [ break ] ) .",
    "if we place molecules on an fcc lattice , there is no generic loss of inversion symmetry . for",
    "nearly infinitely rigid molecules , a loss of inversion symmetry is not expected .",
    "when one considers the related problem of alkali metal doped c@xmath2 , the situation is different .",
    "there one has a reason why generically inversion symmetry could be broken , and consideration of space groups without inversion symmetry is reasonable.@xcite    we now discuss briefly , without derivation , structures which can occur if we relax the condition that the molecule has inversion symmetry .",
    "first we consider the case when all four sites are equivalent .",
    "each of the structures found requiring inversion symmetry has a counterpart without inversion symmetry , as one would expect , since one can easily envision a small perturbation which breaks inversion symmetry .",
    "thus the pn@xmath281 m structure of the @xmath218 point group becomes the p@xmath283 structure of @xmath143 point group symmetry . in this case",
    ", a loss of inversion symmetry does not cause any displacement of the molecules from their fcc lattice sites . in the case of the pn@xmath281 and pa@xmath281 structures ,",
    "loss of inversion symmetry implies a displacement of the molecules away from their positions when there is inversion symmetry .",
    "( of course , this is the generic case .",
    "one can imagine the accidental case when this displacement is zero . ) in both cases , this displacement is such that the center of mass of the molecule is translated along the three - fold axis .",
    "thus the analog of pn@xmath281 is p23 and that of pa@xmath281 is p@xmath284 .",
    "presumably , if this displacement is small enough , it could be consistent with the experimental determination that the centers of mass of the molecules form an fcc lattice . in any event , the loss of inversion symmetry is not generic and requires either noninfinitesimal distortion of the molecule or an external perturbation , like doping .",
    "when we consider inequivalent sites , we find that the only possibility occurs within @xmath221 point group symmetry .",
    "starting from pm@xmath281 , one can remove inversion symmetry . in this case , the molecules are not displaced from their position in the presence of inversion symmetry .",
    "but , as in the case of equivalent sites , this removal of inversion symmetry does require either a noninfinitesimal distortion of the molecule , or a perturbation to break inversion symmetry , and thus is not generic .",
    "we have demonstrated a constructive algorithm for finding orientations of molecules whose centers of mass are at or infinitesimally near specified locations . in this algorithm one",
    "obtains candidate structures from which one eliminates structures which are unacceptable because they do not have molecules at the specified locations . also , in classifying structures one has to take care to identify additional symmetries that may be introduced in the construction , especially when structural parameters whose values are not fixed by symmetry , are assigned special values .",
    "in addition , we have given an extensive discussion of the role of symmetry breaking in which the molecule spontaneously distorts or its center of mass spontaneously is displaced from the assigned position . unless there is some external perturbation ( like doping ) such spontaneous symmetry breaking is not the generic case which applies when the ratio of force constants associated with intramolecular bonds to those associated with intermolecular interactions is arbitrarily large .",
    "if such spontaneous symmetry breaking is allowed , the problem becomes poorly formulated in that molecular and atomic positions arbitrarily far from those desired become permissible .    * acknowledgements * r.s .",
