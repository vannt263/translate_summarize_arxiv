    "it appears that flight times of these the young stars from their birthplace in the galactic disk ( or the gc ) to their current location is longer than their main sequence ( ms ) lifetimes .    in the following",
    "we suggest that such discrepancy could be solved if these stars were ejected as runaway or hypervelocity binaries .",
    "a combination of dynamical and evolutionary processes could then explain the existence of these `` too young '' halo stars .",
    "following their ejection and propagation in the galaxy , the ejected runaway / hypervelocity binaries could evolve and rejuvenate through mass between ( or merger of ) the binary stellar components .",

    "two mechanisms are thought to contribute to the ejection of runaway stars , both involve binarity ( or higher multiplicity ) . in the binary supernova scenario ( @xcite ) a runaway star receives its velocity when the primary component of a massive binary system explodes as a supernova ( sn ) . when the sn shell passes the secondary , the gravitational attraction of the primary reduces considerably , and the secondary starts to move through space with a velocity comparable to its original orbital velocity . in the dynamical ejection scenario ( @xcite )",

    "extreme velocities as found for hvss most likely suggest a different dynamical origin than that of runaway stars .",
    "several scenarios have been suggested for ejection of hvss , all of them require an interaction with the mbh .",
    "these include a disruption of a stellar binary by a mbh ( @xcite ) , an interaction of a single star with an intermediate mass black hole ( imbh ) which inspirals to the gc ( @xcite ) , or interaction with stellar black holes ( sbhs ) in the gc ( @xcite ) .",
    "in such scenarios stars could be ejected from the gc with velocities of hundreds and even a few thousands @xmath62 possibly extending much beyond the escape velocity from the galaxy .",
    "recently it was suggested that binary stars could also be ejected as hypervelocity binaries during the inspiral of an imbh @xcite , and could serve as evidence for the binary mbh ejection scenario .",
    "it was noted that the other scenarios for hypervelocity ejection are not likely to eject hypervelocity binaries .",
    "specifically the probability for a binary ejection in a triple disruption by a mbh is negligibly small .",
    "the later claim may well be correct for the low mass hypervelocity stars discussed in lu et al .",
    "paper , however , as we show in the following , a non - negligible number of massive hypervelocity binaries could be ejected through a triple disruption by the mbh in the gc .",
    "young massive binaries may also be ejected by an inspiraling imbh as suggested by lu et al . for low mass binaries .",
    "however , the fraction of surviving binaries close to the mbh , where they could be ejected as hvss by an inspiraling imbh is small , since most would be disrupted through dynamical interactions with other stars in this hostile environment ; see @xcite for detailed discussion .",
    "moreover , it is likely that the most if not all of the observed young hvss in the galactic halo were not ejected in such a scenario , given the observational constrains on the number of young stars observed close to the mbh in the gc @xcite . in the following",
    "we discuss the triple disruption scenario .      a close pass of a binary star near a massive black hole results in an exchange interaction , in which one star is ejected at high velocity , while its companion is captured by the mbh and is left bound to it .",
    "such interaction occurs because of the tidal forces exerted by the mbh on the binary components .",
    "typically , a binary ( with mass , @xmath63 and semi - major axis , @xmath64 ) , is disrupted when it crosses the tidal radius of the mbh ( with mass @xmath65 ) , given by    @xmath66    and one of the stars ( with mass @xmath67 ) is captured close to the mbh and the other ( with mass @xmath68 ) is ejected at high velocity of about @xcite    @xmath69    the same scenario could be extended to a triple disruption by a mbh .",

    "@xmath72 ) . in such hierarchical triples ,",
    "the outer binary could be disrupted by the mbh while the inner closer binary is kept bound . in this case",
    "a triple disruption could produce a hypervelocity binary , or alternatively a captured binary star near the mbh . the ejection velocity in eq .",
    "[ eq : v_eject ] is strongly dependent on the semi major axis of the binary ( the outer binary in the triple case ) and on the mass of the stellar binary ( triple in this case ) .",

    "such as studied by @xcite , one requires @xmath74 for ejection of a hypervelocity binary at @xmath75 .",
    "such close binaries are infrequent ( only a few percents of the binary population ; @xcite ) , and the fraction of low mass triples with such close outer binaries is negligibly small @xcite .    for higher mass stars such as the observed young b - type hypervelocity stars in the galactic halo , @xmath76 corresponding to a triple mass of @xmath77 ( assuming equal mass stars ) . in this case",
    "even a semi major axis of @xmath78 is sufficient for the ejection of a hypervelocity binary .",

    "the triple fraction and distribution of massive stars is still uncertain , but it is strongly suggestive of a high triple fraction among binaries .",

    "some @xmath82 of the wide visual binaries in stellar associations are in fact hierarchical triple systems , where typically the more massive of the binary components is itself a spectroscopic or even eclipsing binary pair @xcite .",

    "the fraction of close triples ( such as those in @xcite ) out of the total triple population is unknown . in the lack of better estimate",
    "we assume this fraction to follow the the fraction of close binaries , i.e. we take the fraction of close triples out of the full triple population to be @xmath86 ( note that the fraction of close triples might in fact be higher , since @xmath87 is taken for binaries with @xmath81 where as fekel s sample also contain triples with wider outer binaries ) . taken together",
    "we can estimate the triple fraction of hypervelocity binary potential progenitors to be @xmath88 ( taking a binary fraction of @xmath89 of which @xmath89 are triples , and @xmath90 of those have outer binaries with period @xmath91 yr ) .",
    "we note that there is some weak trend for more massive stars to have higher multiplicity , however , more observational data is required for a better resolution of the mass dependence of the multiplicity , and the quoted values are assumed to represent all main sequence b - stars .",
    "note that very few studies on observed massive triples have been done , and therefore we also try to estimate the appropriate triple fraction differently , based only on the better known characteristics of massive binaries , where we follow the method used by @xcite .",
    "again , we assume that the orbital and stellar characteristics of the third component in a given triple could be chosen from the same distributions of the binaries@xmath92 .",
    "we pick a sample of randomly chosen triple systems taken from the appropriate binary distributions . for our sample",
    "we choose many triples with initial orbital distributions such that both their inner and outer binaries are taken from the best fit observed distributions of @xcite .",
    "each given triple has an inner binary with semi major axis @xmath71 and masses @xmath93 and @xmath94 ; and an outer companion with mass @xmath95 in an orbit with semi major axis @xmath70 . the period is chosen from a distribution of orbital separations which is flat in log space , @xmath96 , corresponding to @xmath97 ( i.e. , @xmath98piks law ) . the minimum value for the for the appropriate semi - major axis is taken to be twice the radii of the binary stars , i.e. separation of a contact binary which does not immediately merge .",
    "the maximal value is taken to be 1000 au , following the best fit distribution found by @xcite .",
    "the mass ratio , @xmath99 , is chosen from a power law distribution ( @xmath100 ) ; we also tried other distributions suggested in the literature and found only minor effects on the final calculated fraction .",
    "the mass of the tertiary companion , @xmath95 , was determined by choosing @xmath101 from the same mass ratio distribution .",
    "this approach implies that the mass of the third star was correlated with the mass of the inner binary , but we do not believe that this correlation has any significant effect on our results .",
    "two periods and eccentricities were picked in the same manner discussed in @xcite .",
    "the smaller ( larger ) period was assigned to the inner ( outer ) orbit .",
    "the semi major axes were computed from these masses and periods assuming non interacting keplerian orbits .",
    "the mutual inclination distribution of the tertiary is assumed to be isotropic with respect to the inner binary .",
    "after these parameters were selected , we used the empirical stability criterion used in @xcite ( 2007 ; see their eq .",
    "( 37 ) originally formulated in @xcite ) to determine whether the system is hierarchical or if it will disrupt in a small number of dynamical times .",
    "if the semi major axes obeyed this criterion then we accepted the triple as stable , otherwise , we assumed it disrupted .",
    "we then found the fraction of stable triples , such that their disruption by the mbh in the gc could eject a hypervelocity binary , i.e. have outer semi - major axis small enough for the ejection velocity to be high .    from a large sample of triples ( @xmath102",
    "we find that about @xmath103 of potentially formed triples are stable triples that could serve as hypervelocity binaries progenitors , where this results is not very sensitive to the prime mass @xmath93 of the inner binary component .",
    "this is generally consistent with the observation based estimates given before .",
    "we conclude that @xmath104 of all massive hypervelocity stars could have been ejected with a binary companion or have left a close binary captured in an orbit very close to the mbh .",
    "binaries ejected at high velocities are relatively close binaries . for both runaway and hypervelocity binaries the closer the binary is , the higher is its probability to be ejected at high velocity ( see e.g. eq . [ eq : v_eject ] ) . in the case of binaries evolving in triples ( e.g. hypervelocity binaries from triple disruptions ) ,",
    "dynamical evolution could be very efficient in producing very close inner binaries .",
    "a large fraction of such triples evolve through kozai oscillations @xcite , in which the inner binary is periodically driven into high eccentricities .",
    "when the eccentricity of the inner binaries are high enough the binary components tidally interact , and dissipate the orbital energy .",
    "this mechanism of kozai cycles and tidal friction ( kctf ) was shown to drive the inner binary into close configuration and circularization at periods of a few days @xcite , at relatively short times ( @xmath105myr ) , much shorter than the ms lifetime of the stars ( fabrycky , private communication ; 2007 ) .",
    "in fact it is quite plausible that most of the observed contact binaries are produced through evolution in triple stars @xcite .",
    "we conclude that most if not all runaway and hypervelocity binaries should be ejected as close ( period of up to a few tens of days ) or even contact binaries .            during the evolution of close binaries in the triples",
    "they can closely interact through mass transfer and even mergers ( citeper+09 ) .",
    "such interaction could lead to rejuvenation of one the binary components ( see e.g @xcite ) , and even to its `` reincarnation '' as higher mass star .",
    "such rejuvenated stars , also known as blue stragglers ( although this term usually refers to low mass rejuvenated stars ) could appear much younger than their real age @xcite . for high velocity stars such extended lifetimes",
    "could potentially be translated into much larger propagation distances from their birth place .",
    "consequently , such high velocity massive blue stragglers could be observed to have flight times longer than their apparent lifetime ( see table 1 ) .",
    "we used the population synthesis program seba , as described in detail in @xcite and @xcite , to study the possible outcomes from the evolution of close runaway and hypervelocity binaries . in this",
    "module stars are evolved via the time dependent mass - radius relations for solar metallicities given by @xcite with corrections by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these equations give the radius of a star as a function of time and the initial mass of the star ( on the zero - age main - sequence ) .",
    "the mass of the stellar core and the rate of mass loss via a stellar wind ( not specified in this prescription ) were included using the prescriptions of @xcite .",
    "we have focused on the evolution of the possible binary progenitors of the rejuvenated ob stars , such as currently observed in the galactic halo ( table 1 ) . for this purpose",
    "we generated a grid of initial conditions for the periods ( in the range @xmath106 days ) and eccentricities ( @xmath107 ) of the binaries .",
    "observations of massive binaries show that the components mass ratios are usually large @xcite .",
    "we have studied binaries with different masses and/or mass ratios . for each possibility",
    "we followed the binaries evolution for any initial condition in our grids , until both the binary components ( or single component in case of a merger ) have finished their evolution on the ms .",
    "we then recorded the total evolution time and the binary characteristics ( component masses , period , and eccentricity ) . here",
    "we show the results of two representative masses for the prime binary component ( @xmath108 and @xmath109 ) and two possible mass ratios ( @xmath110 ) .",
    "similar results have been found for other masses and mass ratios .",
    "the binary evolution scenarios in our grid which produce rejuvenated stars correspond to different types of mass transfer scenarios , namely type a and type b mass transfer ( @xcite ) .",
    "we find three main outcomes for the evolution of such close binaries ; merger , strong mass transfer and weak mass transfer ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : evolutionary - time - scale ] ) .",
    "when the two components are very close ( i.e. small periods of a few days for circular orbits , or longer period binaries with higher eccentricities ) , the binary components merge to form a single star containing almost all of the total initial binary mass .",
    "these mass transfer scenarios are all basically subtypes of type a mass transfer ( see @xcite for detailed description ) .",
    "the time until merger varies between almost immediate merger up to the ms lifetime of the more massive component .",
    "a mass transfer and/or merger evolution may lead to some observational signatures , such as possibly high rotational velocity ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references there in ) ) ; or chemical anomalies , such as cno abundances anomalies citepsar+96,che+04,fer+06 . for our rejuvenated stars candidate sample we find that high rotational velocities are possibly observed in pg 1209 + 263 , hs 1914 + 7139 ; pg 0914 + 001 @xcite.large chemical anomalies are observed in hs 1914 + 7139 ; @xcite ) . however , such peculiarities are not likely to be strong signatures , since they do not necessarily arise only due to mass transfer processes , and may not even be produced in the majority of rejuvenated stars to begin with .",
    "we conclude that given the weak observational signature of the rejuvenation process on the appearance of the rejuvenated stars , observations of the chemical or rotational properties can not serve to directly trace their binary origin .    in longer period binaries ( and/or smaller eccentricities )",
    "strong mass transfer occurs when the more massive binary components leave the ms .",
    "the massive component then shed most of its mass to its companion .",
    "this scenario usually produces a massive ms star containing @xmath111 of the initial total binary mass with a low mass companion .",
    "such scenario corresponds to type b mass transfer ( see e.g. @xcite for details ) .",
    "these binaries have typical periods of @xmath112 days .",
    "the timescale for the production of the accreting massive components is typically the ms lifetime of the initial prime component of the binary . in a smaller part of the phase space explored in our grids ,",
    "a weak mass transfer occurs where only a small fraction of the mass from the prime component is accreted by its companion . in these cases ,",
    "the rejuvenation of the companion is negligible .",
    "young stars have been observed in the galactic halo since the 1970 s ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "such stars are found well away from any star - forming region and are remote from any high density interstellar gas pockets where they could have potentially formed .",
    "the origin of these young stars in the galactic halo have been extensively studied ( see @xcite for a review ) , and many of them could be understood in terms of ejection mechanisms .",
    "they could have formed in the galactic disk and then be ejected at high velocities due to dynamical interactions , and travel to their current position in the halo .",
    "however , some of these young halo stars have apparent evolutionary age shorter than the flight time from any star forming region in the galactic disk or the gc ( cf .",

    "these scenarios dealt either with a specific observed runway @xcite , or with more rare cases than the scenario discussed here .",
    "they also discussed interaction of a compact object with its companion rather than the rejuvenation due to mass transfer in the post - main sequence evolution stages of binaries .    in the following we discuss the status of the candidate runaway and hypervelocity stars in the galactic halo and the implications of the binary rejuvenation and the triple disruption scenarios for the young stellar population in the gc .",
    "we suggest that all of the currently observed young halo stars could have been ejected from the galactic disk or the gc , when the binary rejuvenation scenario is taken into account .",
    "we also expand our discussion on the origin of the hypervelocity star he 0437 - 5439 , which was recently discussed in the literature .",

    "we have listed young stars observed in the galactic halo that have estimated propagation times which could potentially be larger than their evolutionary time , given the uncertainties . as we have shown in section [ sec : rej ] , the rejuvenation in binaries can extend the travel time of the runaway stars as main sequence stars . following the rejuvenation , in both the full merger and",

    "such rejuvenation scenarios provide a maximal flight time for a given star of @xmath117 . since the mass of the prime component in the binary progenitor is at least half the mass of the rejuvenated star we find the maximal propagation time to be @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is the ms lifetime of a star with half the mass of the observed halo star .",
    "we find that all of the candidate stars in table 1 have @xmath120 , and could be rejuvenated stars .",
    "currently ~20 hvss have been observed in the galactic halo @xcite .",
    "the kinematics and ages of most of these stars are consistent with their possible origin from the gc .",
    "a discrepancy between the kinematics and the ages of a few of the bound hvss might exist @xcite , making them possible candidate rejuvenated stars . however , more observations are required to confirm that these stars are truly early b - type stars , and not halo extreme horizontal branch stars .",
    "the hypervelocity star he 0437 - 5439 was spectroscopically identified to be a genuinely young b2 iii - iv halo star with mass of @xmath121 @xcite .",
    "its apparently short lifetime and the large distances from the gc and the galactic disk make it too young to have traveled from these regions during its lifetime , even with it very high velocity ( @xmath122;@xcite ) .",
    "it was therefore suggested to be either ejected from the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) or rejuvenated in a binary ejected by an imbh inspiral to the gc @xcite . in the following we discuss the possible evidence for the origin of this star ( metallicity ) , and its dynamical history .",
    "we show that the suggested dynamical origins of this star from the lmc require improbable dynamical scenarios , and as an alternative we suggest it is a rejuvenated star ejected as a hypervelocity binary in a triple disruption by the mbh in the gc .",
    "we also show that the chemical abundances of he 0437 - 5439 suggested as evidence for an lmc origin of the hvs , do not rule out its possible galactic center origin , and could be consistent with such a scenario .",
    "in addition we shortly discuss the possible rejuvenation origin of the low mass old hvs us 708 .      given the observed high velocity of he 0437 - 5439 , a dynamical scenario for this star would most likely require an interaction with a mbh .",
    "@xcite have suggested that a tidal disruption of a binary by an imbh in a young stellar cluster in the lmc could produce hypervelocity star such as he 0437 - 5439 at a rate of @xmath123 .",
    "we note that such imbh have not yet been observed in the lmc ( or elsewhere ) .",
    "moreover , @xcite have not taken into account a few important considerations .",
    "( 1 ) the travel time from the lmc to our galaxy for such a hvs is about 20 myrs , very close to the ages of the clusters they suggested as possible hosts of an imbh . for these clusters",
    "the hvs should have been ejected immediately after the formation of the imbh ( assuming the imbh have formed quickly enough in the cluster to begin with ) , probably during less than 1 myrs , in order to achieve its current position . given the calculated ejection rates ,",
    "only @xmath124 hvss could have been ejected , on average , in the relevant time .",
    "( 2 ) the stellar mass function has not been taken into account by @xcite .",
    "the fraction of stars as massive as @xmath125 or more ( the estimated mass of he 0437 - 5439 ) is very small , only a fraction of @xmath126 of the stellar population is in such massive stars ( and likely even smaller , as most of these more massive stars were likely to fuel the growth of the imbh ) . ( 3 ) the ejection of hvss is isotropic , and therefore only a fraction of them @xmath127 would be directed to the milky way galaxy . taking together the average number of observable massive ( @xmath128 ) hvss from the lmc ( similar to he 0437 - 5439 ) should be about @xmath129 , making this possibility highly unlikely .",
    "recently it was suggested that hvss might be produced through binary - binary dynamical interactions of massive binaries in a dense cluster @xcite . @xcite",
    "have studied such encounters .",
    "he found that the lowest mass star participating in the interaction could attain the highest velocity .",
    "such velocity would be comparable to the escape velocity from the the most massive star participating in the encounter .",
    "if he 0437 - 5439 was ejected from the lmc , it would require an ejection velocity of @xmath130 in order to acquire its current position during its lifetime @xcite .",
    "for this to happen he 0437 - 5439 would need to encounter stars more massive than itself .",
    "even then the fraction of encounters where such velocity could be attained by this star is @xmath131 ; see @xcite ) for encounters where the masses of the other stars are larger than @xmath132 ; respectively ) .",
    "since binary - binary encounters usually lead to the disruption of one of the binaries , one would require @xmath133 such binaries to exist in order for one of them to potentially be ejected at such high velocity .",
    "such conditions , i.e. the existence of hundreds ( thousands ) of @xmath134 stars in a super dense cluster core are not known to exist in any young cluster in the galaxy or in the lmc .",
    "we conclude that the scenario for ejection of he 0437 - 5439 through a dynamical interaction with massive stars in a cluster is highly unlikely .",
    "recently @xcite and @xcite have found the metallicity of the hvs he 0437 - 5439 to be low relative to solar metallicity .",
    "they suggested this as a possible evidence for an lmc origin of this star rather than a galactic origin .",
    "however , an lmc origin would be difficult to explain dynamically , as discussed above .",
    "moreover , in the following we show that the current metallicity measurements do not rule out a galactic ( and galactic center ) origin for he 0437 - 5439 .",
    "it is known that the observed abundances of some elements in galactic b stars are depressed relative to the established solar values ( see e.g. @xcite and the appendix ) .",
    "therefore , one should compare the metallicity of b type stars such as he 0437 - 5439 with large surveys of similar b type stars .",
    "@xcite made a comparison with a single galactic b star and a single lmc b star that may not representative of the large scatter in the abundances shown in larger samples .",
    "@xcite made a comparison with a large b stars survey in the lmc , but for the comparison with the galactic abundances they took the solar abundances rather that galactic b stars surveys .",
    "2 show the spread in the measured chemical abundances for different samples of stars ( lmc , milky way and the galactic center stars ) found in the literature ( see caption of fig .",
    "2 ) . for small samples ( with 10 stars or less )",
    "the data for each of the stars is shown rather than the mean abundance , since given the very small samples the mean may not be a good representative of the underlying distribution of abundances .",
    "for the larger samples the 1 @xmath135 spread around the mean ( i.e. where  68 percents of the measured values are found ) is shown we can use these data samples and compare them with the chemical abundances of he 0437 - 5439 .",
    "the results by @xcite have systematically smaller error bars , and also contain the abundances for more elements ( @xmath136 and @xmath137 ) compared with the results obtained by @xcite ( which do not show the fe abundance ) , and ere therefore used in the comparison . nevertheless , given the large differences that exist between the chemical abundances obtained by @xcite and those found by @xcite , the latter results are also shown in fig .",
    "2 for completeness .",
    "comparison of the chemical abundances of he 0437 - 5439 as found by @xcite to those found in surveys of b type stars throughout the galaxy ( @xcite show that its metallicity is highly consistent with their metallicities .",
    "most ( > 50 percents ) of the stars in the sample have more extreme elemental abundances than that of he 0437 - 5439 ( for each of the elemental abundances observed ; see fig .",
    "2 , bottom panel ) , showing that the elemental abundances of he 0437 - 5439 are quite typical of the milky way chemical abundances .",
    "although a galactic origin is most consistent with the metallicities of he 0437 - 5439 , its high velocity would require an interaction with a mbh , currently known to exist only in the gc .",
    "therefore , its metallicities should be compared to the metallicities of similar unevolved b stars in the gc .",
    "unfortunately , metallicity measurements of stars in the gc region exist only for a small number of stars , none of which are similar to he 0437 - 5439 ( although some of these gc stars have similar masses , they are at a very different evolutionary stage ; @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , given the current data , drawing conclusions on the origin of he 0437 - 5439 based on metallicity comparisons with gc stars is premature .",
    "nevertheless , we shortly discuss such metallicity comparison , but caution that this should not be taken as evidence for the origin of he 0437 - 5439 , but at most as a possible clue until further measurements of the metallicity of gc stars are available .",
    "the chemical abundances of stars in the gc are known mostly for cool evolved stars @xcite .",
    "data on two additional highly massive ( @xmath138 ) lbv stars exists @xcite , but given their very different stellar type and evolution , comparing their abundances with that of he 0437 - 5439 is not justified , and we do not use their data .",
    "the number of data points ( stars ) for each element are 10 , 7 , 6 and 5 for the elements @xmath139 and @xmath140 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath141 and @xmath137 abundances of he 0437 - 5439 are found to be consistent with gc values ( see fig .",
    "2 . ) , but the @xmath140 abundance is not ( with * all * 5 stars in the gc sample have higher abundances than those found for he 0437 - 5439 ) .",
    "we note that better agreement is observed for those elements for which more data exist .",
    "the @xmath140 abundance of he 0437 - 5439 is lower than those of the gc stars .",
    "however , since cno cycle mixing can convert these elements in the gc stars ( see e.g. @xcite ) and in he 0437 - 5439 , one should be careful and also check the sum of these elements and not only compare each of these elements by itself .",
    "we find that the sum of these elements is consistent with that of the gc sample stars , i.e. not even the @xmath140 abundance of he 0437 - 5439 could be interpreted as an evidence against a gc origin .",
    "moreover , given the low statistics of the gc sample , the lower n abundance is not statistically significant , even by itself . given the wide range of abundances found in different galactic b - type stars surveys ( see appendix ) , it is possible that this specific hvs b star may have lower abundances of these specific element .",
    "the middle panel of fig .",
    "2 shows the comparison of the elements abundances of he 0437 - 5439 to those found in the lmc .",
    "the metallicities of b stars in the lmc were found by several groups ( the largest samples by @xcite ) , where we show the values obtained by @xcite , for which a large sample exists ( 30 ) , whereas the sample by @xcite contain only 4 stars ) .",
    "the comparison shows much poorer agreement with lmc abundances than with the milky way abundances .",
    "the n , fe and the si abundances of he 0437 - 5439 are found to be consistent with lmc values , but the @xmath141 and @xmath142 abundances are not ( * all * 30 stars in the lmc samples have higher abundances than those found for he 0437 - 5439 for these elements ) .",
    "we do note , however , that the metallicities of he 0437 - 5439 obtained by @xcite are consistent with those of the lmc for all elements .",
    "in addition the results of @xcite are better consistent with lmc values found by @xcite which are systematically higher ) .",
    "these comparisons show that the metallicities obtained by @xcite are more consistent with the gc abundances than the lmc abundances shown here ( and best consistent with a galactic origin ) . however , we caution again that the small statistics and the different type of stars included in the gc sample of stars , the large differences inferred for the metallicities of he 0437 - 5439 by different authors @xcite ; and the different analysis methods used by different groups , suggest that it is still to early to draw conclusions from such metallicity comparisons .",
    "it is clear from the above discussion , however , that none of the suggested origins for he 0437 - 5439 , including the galactic disk , the lmc and the gc can be ruled out based upon current metallicity data .",
    "comparison of the metal abundances of the hypervelocity star he 0437 - 5439 ( @xcite middle red bars and @xcite right cyan bars ) to those of the galactic center ( top panel , left blue bars ) , lmc b stars ( middle panel , left green bars ) and galactic b stars ( bottom panel , left magenta bars ) .",

    "galactic center metallicities are taken from @xcite .",
    "all values are given relative to solar abundances ( dashed lines ; * ? ? ?",
    "note that the gc metallicity values are shown for each of the stars in those smaples containing ten or less stars ( see text ) , whereas for larger sample sizes the median metallicity values and the 1 @xmath135 spread around the median are shown .",
    "the number of stars from which the range of abundance values were obtained is denoted beside the bars ( the lmc samples includes 30 values for all the elements beside @xmath137 , see text . ]      as discussed in the previous sections , young halo stars such as he 0437 - 5439 could have evolved from two lower mass members of ejected hypervelocity binaries .",
    "the binary components either merge completely , or may evolve through a strong mass transfer from the more massive binary component to its initially lower mass companion , which becomes a rejuvenated massive star .",
    "the later possibility would give a strong observable signature in the form of a high mass ratio binary with a period of tens of days .",
    "the observations of @xcite and @xcite rule out the possibility of such a binary , and therefore if this hvs is a rejuvenated star its binary progenitor fully merged . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : evolutionary - time - scale ] , a binary progenitor with @xmath108 and @xmath143 components , for example , could have propagated for more than @xmath144 myrs and then merge to form a @xmath145 star , consistent with the required travel time from the gc @xcite .",
    "we note that binaries with other high mass ratio components ( not shown here ) , but with a total binary mass of @xmath146 could also produce such a merged star with the appropriate evolutionary time scales . given the tendency of massive binaries to have high mass ratios , it is likely that most ejected binaries should have mass ratios in the relevant parameter space as to produce a merged star similar to he 0437 - 5439 .",
    "all the hypervelocity binaries have initial semi - major axis smaller than @xmath147 ( @xmath148 ) , since they were originally part of the inner binaries in close stable triples .",
    "in addition , the kctf mechanism in triples ( see section 4 ) can evolve such inner binaries into even closer contact configuration at a very short timescale ( myr ) .",
    "it is therefore expected that most hypervelocity binaries would be at very tight orbits or a few @xmath149 separations , such as those required to eventually form a merged star like he 0437 - 5439 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . in other words",
    "the rejuvenation scenario is a likely scenario for the formation and ejection of he 0437 - 5439 .",
    "the estimate in section 3.2.1 suggests @xmath150 of the hvss could be ejected as close hypervelocity binaries or leave a binary star close to the mbh .",
    "the fraction of rejuvenated hvss is therefore @xmath151 where @xmath152 is the fraction of disrupted triples that eject the inner binary , @xmath153 is the probability the binary merges , @xmath154 is the fractional lifetime of the merger remnant to the original stars lifetime . simulations of binary disruptions by a mbh @xcite suggest that there is no preference for the primary or the secondary in the binary to be ejected , i.e. they have equal ejection probability , i therefore take @xmath155 . estimating the probability of binary merger is very uncertain . taking the observed triples sample of @xcite , i find that the inner binaries in the hvss binaries possible progenitors have periods of a few days , which together with the binary stellar evolution simulations ( see fig . [",
    "fig : evolutionary - time - scale ] ) suggest that @xmath156 of them would merge due to stellar evolution .",
    "i therefore take @xmath157 .",
    "the question of @xmath154 is more complicated .",
    "the merger remnant has a lifetime of @xmath115 as discussed in section 5.1 , and the maximal lifetime of its progenitor is at most @xmath119 .",
    "a rejuvenated star therefore has a fractional life time to the original stars of @xmath158 .",
    "taking the stellar evolution main sequence lifetimes from the geneva stellar evolution tracks @xcite , i find this to be approximately @xmath159 .",
    "however , on average , the hvss are ejected after half their lifetime . in addition , the ejected stars are observed only after their propagation for @xmath160 yrs ( the flight time to distances of @xmath161 kpc from the gc where they are currently observed ) , the fraction of the merger remnant lifetime to the time spent by the progenitor at observable regions is @xmath162 .",
    "a reasonable estimate is therefore @xmath163 .",
    "taken together , we find @xmath164 .",
    "given the current estimate of @xmath165 @xmath166 b type hvss in the galactic halo @xcite , we may expect to find @xmath167 rejuvenated ( more ) massive hvss in a full sky survey ( compare with the value of @xmath168 massive stars expected to originate from the lmc in the imbh scenario , if such imbh indeed exist there in a young massive cluster ) .",
    "we summarize this section by concluding that current suggestions for the hypervelocity ejection of he 0437 - 5439 from the lmc ( either by an imbh or through interactions with other massive stars ) are highly unlikely , and suggest that he 0437 - 5439 was ejected from our gc ( where we stress that this scenario is not ruled out by current metallicity comparisons ) in a hypervelocity binary following a triple disruption by the mbh .",
    "we note that the hypervelocity star us 708 , which is not a young star but an evolved sdo star , was suggested to evolve from a merger of a close binary @xcite . in that respect we find that when the evolution of close binaries such as studied here is followed to later times ( not shown here ) such white dwarfs are indeed formed in some cases .",
    "it is therefore possible that us 708 was also ejected as a binary star from a triple disruption that later on evolved and merged to form an sdo star , in a similar way to the rejuvenated young halo star studied here ( as suggested by w. brown , private communication ) .",
    "however , the unique evolution and the a merger of two white dwarfs is only poorly followed in the evolutionary code used here , and further studies should be made to check this possibility .      in recent years",
    "high resolution observations have revealed the existence of many young ob stars in the gc near the mbh .",
    "most of the young stars are observed in the central 0.5 pc around the mbh .",
    "the young stars population in the inner 0.04 pc ( the s - stars ) contain only young b - stars , in apparently isotropic distribution around the mbh @xcite .",
    "the young stars outside this region contain many o - stars in a disk like structure and were probably formed from the fragmentation of a gaseous disk @xcite .",
    "however , the origin of the s - stars is difficult to explain by this process .",
    "it was suggested that the s - stars with their very different properties migrated from the stellar disk through a planetary migration like process @xcite .",
    "this interesting possibility has not yet been studied quantitatively .",
    "another possibility is that these stars have a different origin , possibly from the disruption of young binaries and the following capture of one of their components @xcite .",
    "it was recently shown that such a scenario could be consistent with the current knowledge regarding the number of the observed s - stars and their orbital properties @xcite . in case of a triple disruption",
    ", a binary could be captured at a close orbit near the mbh .",
    "we therefore suggest that some of the observed s - stars may be binaries .",
    "such binaries may not survive for long in this environment due to interactions with other stars ( see * ? ? ? * for a detailed discussion on binaries survival in the gc ) .",
    "such interactions could also change the orbits of the disrupted binary components near the mbh .",
    "still , the closest binaries could survive for longer times @xcite and may be observed .",
    "interestingly , observations of wider s - stars binaries would suggest more recent capture , i.e. the binary period may serve to estimate the time a binary spent in the close by regions of the mbh .",
    "in addition such s - star binaries could rejuvenate to form more massive s - stars , possibly explaining the occurrence of the most massive s - stars such as s-2 .",
    "in this paper we have studied a possible explanation for the existence of young stars far in the galactic halo .",
    "such stars are usually thought to have formed elsewhere , either in the galactic disk or the galactic center , and later on ejected at high velocities into their current position .",
    "however , some of these stars have apparent lifetimes shorter the required flight time from the galactic disk / center . here",
    "we suggested that such stars have evolved in close runaway or hypervelocity binaries .",
    "we found that stellar evolution of such binaries can drive them into mass transfer configurations and even mergers .",
    "such evolution could then rejuvenate them ( similar to the cases of lower mass blue stragglers ) and extend their lifetimes after ejection .",
    "the extended lifetimes of such stars could then be reconciled with their flight times to the galactic halo , and the travel times could be extended up to 3 - 4 times relative to their apparent lifetimes .",
    "three typical scenarios were found for the binaries evolution .",
    "( 1 ) in case of a full merger of the binary progenitor components , a single halo star would be observed . unless the binary merger lead to peculiar characteristics of the merged star , such as possibly high rotational velocity , or chemical peculiarities , observation of such stars",
    "could not directly trace their binary origin .",
    "nevertheless , we predict that in such cases the calculated propagation time of the star from its birthplace would be limited to approximately the main sequence lifetime of its binary progenitor components ( at most the main sequence lifetime of a star with half the mass of the observed halo star ) .",
    "( 2 ) in the case of a strong mass transfer , one of the binary progenitor component have accreted most of the mass of its companion . in such a case",
    "the evolved binary could be observable as a high mass ratio binary , with typical periods of @xmath169days .",
    "( 3 ) in the case of a weak mass transfer , only a small fraction of the mass of the binary progenitor component is accreted by its companion , leading to negligible or mild rejuvenation .",
    "this third evolutionary route would not produce `` too young '' halo stars , albeit they could produce marginal cases .",
    "however , such halo young binaries ( that have already been observed ) can confirm the scenario of runaway binaries that , for different orbital parameters of the binary , could have produced rejuvenated high velocity stars .",
    "we studied the possibilities of binary runaway and hypervelocity stars and showed that such binaries could have been ejected in triple disruptions and other dynamical interactions with stars or with massive black holes .",
    "consequently , currently observed `` too young '' star in the halo could have been ejected from the galactic disk or the galactic center and be observable in their current position if they were ejected as binaries ( whereas other suggestions such as ejection from the lmc are shown to be highly unlikely ) .",
    "the calculated propagation times of these stars are indeed consistent with the evolutionary lifetimes in rejuvenated binaries .",
    "we suggest to look for binary companions that may exist for some of these stars , thus directly confirming the binary rejuvenation scenario ( hd 188618 in table 1 has already been suggested as binary candidate ; @xcite ) .",
    "we also specifically discuss the hypervelocity star he 0437 - 5439 in that respect , and show that it could be a rejuvenated hvs from the gc ( where we also discuss its recently observed metallicity , showing that a galactic center origin can not be currently ruled out , contrary to recent suggestions ) .",
    "finally , we also suggest that triple disruptions by the massive black hole in the galactic center could capture binaries in close orbits near the mbh , some of which may later evolve to become more massive rejuvenated stars .",
    "future observations might be able to study these binaries .",
    "following section 5.2.2 we supplement in this appendix a table in which the detailed chemical abundances of b stars found in galactic and lmc surveys are shown , in order to give better and broader perspective on their scatter and uncertainties .",
    "these show the typically lower measured metallicities characterizing b stars , in comparison with the solar abundances .",
    "also shown are the chemical abundances found for he 0437 - 5439 by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in addition we detail the metallicities of other candidate rejuvenated halo stars from table 1 ( for which measurements are available ) , showing that the metallicities of he 0437 - 5439 are not unusual .",
    "the quoted mean abundances in the surveys have typical @xmath170 dex uncertainties in the mesurements .",
    "the specific uncertainties for single stars is given specifically for each star ."
