    "the impurity and conduction electrons could form an entangled many - body state below the kondo temperature ( @xmath8 ) in the presence of the hybridizations between them .",
    "the magnetic moment of the impurity would then be screened by the formation of the many - body singlet , known as the kondo effect@xcite . however , in systems with a pseudogap like graphene , the kondo effect could be significantly different.@xcite .",
    "for example , with vanishing density of state at the fermi level , the tendency toward the screened impurity in graphene would get reduced .",
    "therefore , the kondo effect would only take place when the strength of the coupling of the impurity state to the conduction electrons ( @xmath11 ) exceeds a critical value ( @xmath12 ) , resulting in a unusual phase diagram for the system . up to now",

    "although the thermodynamical properties of the system might become similar to that of normal metals , the impurity spectral function could have unusual characteristics@xcite .",
    "these unusual characteristics would make the behaviors of the transport properties such as resistivity and dephasing rate become different from that of the conventional kondo effect .",

    "we use the accurate nrg method.@xcite we find that although the asymmetric anderson impurity model considered here is a mixed valence system , it can be drived into either the kondo or mixed valency or empty orbital regime by a gate voltage , giving rise to characteristic features in resistivity and dephasing rate in each regime . the results not only explain the kondo resistivity observed in recent experiments@xcite but also suggest directions for further transport experiments to identify the exotic features of the kondo effect in graphene .",

    "+    before presenting the calculated transport properties , let us first examine the phase diagram of the kondo effect in graphene . in the pure graphene",

    "therefore , we only investigate the cases with @xmath11 being larger than the critical value ( @xmath94 ev ) .    note that in the recent literature@xcite , the fi and sc fixed points are generally refered to as the asymmetric sc point .",
    "we believe that this is at least not precise since , as we demonstrate below , the spectral function and transport properties are quite different in the fi and sc regimes .",
    "therefore , here we consider the fi and sc fixed points ( regimes ) as two different fixed points ( regimes ) .",
    "nevertheless , in this paper , we loosely use the kondo temperature @xmath8 to denote the temperature where the system would enter either the sc or fi regime from either the lm or vf regime for simplicity . strictly speaking",
    ", one should use another symbol ( e.g. , @xmath95 ) to denote the transition from the vf to fi regime since there is no kondo effect in this crossover .",

    ", @xmath8 is defined by equation @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the impurity entropy and @xmath99 is the boltzmann constant , respectively .",
    "it is clear that there is a pronounced particle - hole asymmetry in the graphene kondo systems@xcite . as mentioned in sec .",
    "ii.a , the graphene kondo systems with the types of impurities we consider here , are a mixed valence system .",
    "therefore , as one might expect from the conventional anderson impurity model , there is no lm fixed point and only one crossover , namely , the crossover from the valence - fluctuation ( vf ) to fi regime@xcite for the negative @xmath0 values , as shown in fig .",

    ". we could attribute this interesting behavior to the occurrence of the lm fixed point when @xmath101 ev , which is also evident from the sharp increase of the occupation number of the impurity state around @xmath102 ev [ see the inset in fig . [",

    "therefore , the system would enter the sc regime at lower temperatures from the lm regime ( i.e. , the kondo effect ) rather than the vf regime [ fig . [ tk](b ) ] .",
    "figure [ resistivity ] shows the @xmath7-dependence of the resistivity and also the spectral function at @xmath103 under different chemical potentials . in the present calculations",

    "[ resistivity](a ) ] .",
    "the first case includes the systems with negative @xmath0 and also very small @xmath100 ( e.g. , @xmath108 0 and @xmath1090.001 ev ) values . the resistivity curves in this case",

    "when the temperature is lowered from about 100@xmath8 , the resistivity first rises rapidly to that above @xmath110 , but then drops quickly to @xmath110 as temperature further decreases .",
    "this interesting feature is caused by the fact that the resonance of the impurity state is located at about 10 mev above the fermi level [ see the inset in fig . [ resistivity](b ) ] .",
    "therefore , as temperature decreases , the resonance peak becomes narrower and thus moves away from the fermi level [ see the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) ] .",
    "furthermore , as @xmath0 becomes more negative , the peak would move further above the fermi level [ see , e.g. , the curve for @xmath111 ev in fig . [ resistivity](b ) ] and consequently , the pronounced peak near @xmath8 would be reduced .",
    "interestingly , there is no kondo resonance at the fermi level in the impurity spectral function at low temperatures in this case [ see , e.g. , fig . [ fig3](a ) ] .",
    "therefore , the systems are driven from the high-@xmath7 vf regime to the low-@xmath7 fi regime rather than the sc regime .",
    "nevertheless , fig .",
    "[ resistivity](a ) shows that , in the crossover from the vf to the fi regime , the resistivity curves in this case approach their saturation value in the same manner .",
    "however , the increase of the resistivity as temperature decreases , is much more rapid [ as @xmath112 , as determined by a fitting to the resistivity curves ] than that in the conventional kondo effect [ figure [ resistivity](a ) ] .",
    "+    the case of large positive @xmath0 values ( @xmath101 ev ) belongs to the second one .",
    "a common feature in this case is that apart from the resonance peak due to the impurity state , the sharp kondo resonance appears at the fermi level in the spectral function [ see , e.g. , the curves for @xmath113 and 0.10 ev in fig .",
    "[ resistivity](b ) ] . as a result",
    ", the resistivity curve can be divided into two parts . the first part with @xmath114 ,",
    "is mainly caused by the scattering of the local moment .",
    "the other part with @xmath115 , is due to the strong coupling between the impurity spin and conduction electrons .",
    "figure [ fig3](b ) shows that in the spectral function for @xmath113 ev , a wide peak centered at the effective impurity level @xmath116 = -0.021 ev ( also the dirac point ) and extended across the fermi level , forms at high temperatures .",
    "the sharp kondo resonance at the fermi level shows up as temperature further decreases .",
    "the scattering of the local moment gives rise to the broad resistivity shoulder above 10@xmath8 [ fig .",
    "[ resistivity](a ) ] .",
    "the kondo resonance then causes the resistivity to rises rapidly , like the usual kondo effect , as the system enters the sc regime .",
    "this interesting shoulder - peak feature can be attributed to the occurrence of the additional lm fixed point [ fig . [ tk](b ) ] , as discussed already in the beginning of this section .",
    "the third case includes the systems with a positive @xmath0 being close to @xmath0 = 0.0126 ev . in this case , the impurity state peak is located at the fermi level [ fig .",
    "[ resistivity](b ) ] and hence is merged with the kondo resonance .",

    "this is caused by the occurrence of the lm fixed point in this case [ fig .",
    "[ tk ] ] . in the lm regime ,",
    "the dephasing rate first rises well above @xmath147 due to the inelastic scattering of the local moment , which gives rise to a broad peak covering the fermi level [ fig .",
    "[ dephasingrate](b ) ] .",
    "this results in a wide shoulder above 100@xmath8 . in the crossover from the lm to the sc regime , the dephasing rate then rises more quickly to the maximum since the impurity now becomes entangled with the conduction electrons .",
    "this is illustrated for @xmath148 ev in the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig6](b ) where it is seen that the kondo resonance grows rapidly as @xmath8 is approached from above .",
    "as temperature further decreases , however , the dephasing rate drops sharply and eventially vanishes because the kondo resonance starts to decrease and eventually drops to zero [ see the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig6](b ) ] since the impurity magnetic moment is now totally screened .    in the third case ( i.e. , @xmath102 ev )",

    "the two dephasing rate curves are nearly identical in the low temperature side of the peak [ fig .",

    "[ rvs.vg ] .",
    "first of all , fig .",
    "[ rvs.vg ] shows that the @xmath110 values for the negative @xmath0 values are more than 10 times smaller than that for the positive @xmath0 values , further indicating a strong particle - hole asymmetry in the graphene kondo systems .",
    "this can be explained as follows . for the positive @xmath0 values ( @xmath101 ev ) , as discussed in sec .",
    "iiib , @xmath152 and thus the bound impurity state with the local moment is present .",
    "consequently , the system would flow to the sc regime and the kondo resonance would occur at the fermi level as temperature goes to zero .",
    "this kondo effect results in a very strong scattering and hence a very large resistivity at @xmath103 k. for the negative @xmath0 values , on the other hand , @xmath153 and thus the impurity state is unbound . as a result",
    ", the system would flow to the fi regime and no kondo resonance would develop at the fermi level .",
    "therefore , the scattering would be much suppressed at low temperatures , compared with the case of @xmath101 ev , resulting in a much smaller @xmath103 resistivity .",
    "secondly , fig .",
    "[ rvs.vg ] also indicates that for large positive @xmath0 values ( @xmath101 ev ) , all the calculated resistivities at @xmath103 k collapse onto the solid line determined by eq . .",
    "in this case , as mentioned before , the system would flow to the sc regime and @xmath154 at low temperatures .",
    "therefore , @xmath155 can be approximated as @xmath156 . plugging this into eq .",
    ", the resistivity at @xmath103 k can be written as @xmath157 where @xmath158 and @xmath159 = 1 ev . clearly , this saturation value is independent of @xmath11 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , the zero temperature resistivities collapse onto the solid line determined by eq . .",
    "this is also a manifestation of the occurrence of the kondo resonance in the graphene systems with a positive @xmath0 ( @xmath143 ev ) .      finally , we consider the first higher order term .",
    "figure [ rvs.vg ] shows that the results for the cases of @xmath160 and @xmath161 qualitatively agree with the case of the pure power - law of @xmath162 , albeit with a larger @xmath11 .",
    "this is because for the case of carbon vacancies , total hybridization becomes larger when the higher order terms are considered , resulting in a larger effective @xmath11 .",
    "for the case of magnetic adatoms , in the presence of the hybridization between the impurity and the conduction electrons on the next nearest neighbors , @xmath32 becomes asymmetric , giving rise to a larger re@xmath163 .",
    "therefore , the effective impurity level would rise . as a result",
    ", the system needs a larger chemical potential to bring the effective impurity level back to below the fermi level , which has the same effect of a larger @xmath11 .",
    "recent experiments showed that the kondo effect could be observed in graphene with point defects and vacancies@xcite .",
    "two prominent features about the transport properties from the experiments were reported@xcite .",
    "firstly , the kondo effect was observed in graphene under a wide range of applied gate voltages ( up to @xmath164 v , which is equivalent to @xmath165 ev ) .",
    "secondly , the normalized kondo part of the resistivity appeared to be an universal function of @xmath166 , which could fit well to that for the conventional kondo effect obtained from much earlier nrg calculations@xcite . in principle , this could be explained as follows . with a large applied gate voltage ,",
    "the dirac point would lie well below the fermi level .",
    "the two important properties of graphene , namely , zero density of states at the dirac point and linear energy - dependence of the density of states , would hardly affect the transport properties of the system .",
    "therefore , the system would behave like the conventional kondo system .",
    "indeed , as discussed before in sec .",
    "iiia , the shape of the resistivity - vs-@xmath7 curve for @xmath102 ev calculated here looks very similar to that of the conventional kondo effect [ fig .",
    "[ resistivity](a ) ] .",
    "however , as reported in sec .",
    "iiia , our calculated resistivity curves for other chemical potentials show several unusual features which were not observed in the experiments@xcite .",
    "very recently , the difficulties in uncovering the kondo effect in graphene by resistivity measurements because of a possible similar contribution from the electron - electron interaction to the low temperature resistivity , were reported@xcite . on the other hand , fig .",
    "[ dephasingrate](a ) shows that all the dephasing rates in the graphene kondo systems exhibit characteristic features that are distinctly different from that of the conventional kondo effect .",
    "therefore , we would suggest further measurements on the dephasing rate in graphene . with the distinct characteristics we have shown in sec .",
    "iii , the novel features of the resistivity and dephasing rate in graphene could be identified .",
    "we have investigated the resistivity and dephasing rate in the kondo regime due to magnetic impurities in graphene under different gate voltages by nrg calculations .",
    "we find that although the anderson impurity model considered here is a mixed valence system , it can be drived into either the kondo [ @xmath1 ] or mixed valency ( @xmath3 ) or empty orbital ( @xmath4 ) regime by a gate voltage , thereby resulting in characteristic features in resistivity and dephasing rate in each regime",
    ". in particular , in the case of @xmath4 , the shapes of the resistivity ( dephasing rate ) curves are nearly identical . however , as temperature decreases , they start to increase to their maxima at a lower @xmath5 but more rapidly [ as @xmath6 than in normal metals . as @xmath7 further decreases ,",
    "after reaching the maximum , the dephasing rate drops more quickly than in normal metals , behaving as @xmath9 instead of @xmath10 .",
    "furthermore , the resistivity has a pronounced peak above the saturation value near @xmath8 . in the case of @xmath1 , in contrast , the resistivity curve has an additional broad shoulder above 10@xmath8 and the dephasing rate exhibits an interesting shoulder - peak shape . in the narrow boundary region ( @xmath3 ) , both the resistivity and dephasing rate curves are similar to the corresponding ones in normal metals .",
    "the interesting results of the resistivity and dephasing rate are analysized in terms of the calculated spectral function , self - energy due to coulomb correlation and also effective impurity level .",
    "the calculated resistivity in the vicinity of @xmath3 is in good agreement with the conventional kondo like resistivity observed in the recent experiments , although the interesting features in the resistivity in the other cases ( @xmath4 or @xmath1 ) predicted here were not seen in the experiments .",
    "we hope that the unusual features of the kondo resistivity and dephasing rate in graphene reported here would stimulate further transport experiments on the kondo effect in graphene .",
