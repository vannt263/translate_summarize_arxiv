    "hydrodynamics is an efficient tool to describe the expansion of the fireballs generated in relativistic heavy - ion collisions . as a macroscopic description that provides the 4-dimensional space - time evolution of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath3 it is much less demanding than microscopic descriptions based on kinetic theory that evolve the ( on - shell ) distribution function @xmath4 in 7-dimensional phase - space .",
    "ideal fluid dynamics is even more efficient since it reduces the number of independent fields needed to describe the symmetric energy - momentum tensor from 10 to 5 : the local energy density @xmath5 , pressure @xmath6 and the normalized flow 4-velocity @xmath7 ( which has 3 independent components ) .",
    "the equation of state ( eos ) @xmath8 provides a further constraint which closes the set of four equations @xmath9 .",
    "ideal fluid dynamics is based on the strong assumption that the fluid is in local thermal equilibrium and evolves isentropically . while local momentum isotropy in the comoving frame is sufficient for a unique decomposition of the energy - momentum tensor in terms of @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , it does not in general guarantee a unique relationship @xmath8 .",
    "generically , the equation of state @xmath8 ( a key ingredient for closing the set of hydrodynamic equations ) becomes unique only after entropy maximization , _",
    "i.e. _ after a locally thermalized state , with maxwellian ( or bose - einstein and fermi - dirac ) momentum distributions in the comoving frame , has been reached . for this assumption to be valid",
    ", the miscroscopic collision time scale must be much shorter than the macroscopic evolution time scale .",
    "since the fireballs created in relativistic heavy - ion collisions are small and expand very rapidly , applicability of the hydrodynamic approach has long been doubted .",
    "it came therefore as a surprise to many that the bulk of the matter produced in au+au collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) was found to behave like an almost ideal fluid .",
    "specifically , ideal fluid dynamic models correctly reproduce the hadron transverse momentum spectra in central and semi - peripheral collisions , including their anisotropy in non - central collisions given by the elliptic flow coefficient @xmath13 and its dependence on the hadron rest mass , for transverse momenta up to about 1.52gev/@xmath14 @xcite which covers more than 99% of the emitted particles .",
    "this observation has led to the conclusion that the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) created in rhic collisions thermalizes very fast and must therefore be strongly ( non - perturbatively ) interacting @xcite , giving rise to the notion that the qgp is a strongly coupled plasma @xcite that behaves like an almost perfect fluid @xcite .    at rhic energies ,",
    "the almost perfect ideal fluid dynamical description of experimental data gradually breaks down in more peripheral collisions , at high transverse momenta , and at forward and backward rapidities ; at lower energies it lacks quantitative accuracy even in the most central collisions at midrapidity @xcite .",
    "most of these deviations from ideal fluid dynamical predictions can be understood as the result of strong viscous effects during the late hadronic stage of the fireball expansion @xcite after the qgp has hadronized . as the initial energy density of the fireball decreases , the dissipative dynamics of the hadronic stage takes on increasing importance , concealing the perfect fluidity of any quark - gluon plasma possibly created at the beginning of the collision . however , as also pointed out in @xcite , persisting uncertainties about the initial conditions in heavy - ion collisions leave room for a small amount of viscosity even during the early qgp stage .",
    "furthermore , the observed deviations of the elliptic flow parameter @xmath13 at large @xmath15 even in the largest collision systems at the highest available collision energies are consistent with viscous effects during the early epoch of the fireball @xcite . during this epoch ,",
    "the matter is so dense and strongly interacting that a microscopic description based on classical kinetic theory of on - shell partons @xcite may be questionable .",
    "we therefore develop here a dissipative generalization of the macroscopic hydrodynamic approach , viscous relativistic fluid dynamics .",
    "the need for such a framework is further highlighted by the recent insight that , due to quantum mechanical uncertainty @xcite , no classical fluid can have exactly vanishing viscosity ( as is assumed in the ideal hydrodynamic approach ) . even in the limit of infinitely strong coupling , the qgp must hence maintain a nonzero viscosity .",
    "recent calculations of the shear viscosity to entropy ratio ( the `` specific shear viscosity '' @xmath2 ) in a variety of conformal gauge field theories which share some properties with qcd , using the ads / cft correspondence , suggest a lower limit of @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "this is much smaller than the value obtained from weak coupling calculations in qcd @xcite ( although close to a recent first numerical result from lattice qcd @xcite ) and more than an order of magnitude below the lowest measured values in standard fluids @xcite .",
    "some alternative ideas how small effective viscosities could be generated by anomalous effects ( chaoticity ) in anisotropically expanding plasmas @xcite or by negative eddy viscosity in 2-dimensional turbulent flows @xcite have also been proposed .",
    "initial attempts to formulate relativistic dissipative fluid dynamics as a relativistic generalization of the navier - stokes equation @xcite ran into difficulties because the resulting equations allowed for acausal signal propagation , and their solutions developed instabilities .",
    "these difficulties are avoided in the `` 2nd order formalism '' developed 30 years ago by israel and stewart @xcite which expands the entropy current to 2nd order in the dissipative flows and replaces the instantaneous identification of the dissipative flows with their driving forces multiplied by some transport coefficient ( as is done in navier - stokes theory ) by a kinetic equation that evolves the dissipative flows rapidly but smoothly towards their navier - stokes limit .",
    "this procedure eliminates causality and stability problems at the expense of numerical complexity : the dissipative flows become independent dynamical variables whose kinetic equations of motion are coupled and must be solved simultaneously with the hydrodynamic evolution equations .",
    "this leads effectively to more than a doubling of the number of coupled partial differential equations to be solved @xcite .",
    "only recently computers have become powerful enough to allow efficient solution of the israel - stewart equations .",
    "the last 5 years have seen the development of numerical codes which solve these equations ( or slight variations thereof @xcite ) numerically , for systems with boost - invariant longitudinal expansion and transverse expansion in zero @xcite , one @xcite and two dimensions @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a numerical study of the relativistic navier - stokes equation in 2 + 1 dimensions ) .",
    "the process of verification and validation of these numerical codes is still ongoing : while different initial conditions and evolution parameters used by the different groups of authors render a direct comparison of their results difficult , it seems unlikely that accounting for these differences will bring all the presently available numerical results in line with each other .",
    "we here present results obtained with an independently developed ( 2 + 1)-dimensional causal viscous hydrodynamic code , vish2 + 1 @xcite .",
    "while a short account of some of our main findings has already been published @xcite , we here report many more details , including extensive tests of the numerical accuracy of the code : we checked that ( i ) in the limit of vanishing viscosity , it accurately reproduces results obtained with the ( 2 + 1)-d ideal fluid code azhydro @xcite ; ( ii ) for homogeneous transverse density distributions ( _ i.e. _ in the absence of transverse density gradients and transverse flow ) and vanishing relaxation time it accurately reproduces the known analytic solution of the relativistic navier - stokes equation for boost - invariant 1-dimensional longitudinal expansion @xcite ; ( iii ) for very short kinetic relaxation times our israel - stewart code accurately reproduces results from a separately coded ( 2 + 1)-d relativistic navier - stokes code , under restrictive conditions where the latter produces numerically stable solutions ; and ( iv ) for simple analytically parametrized anisotropic velocity profiles the numerical code correctly computes the velocity shear tensor that drives the viscous hydrodynamic effects .    in its present early state , and given the existing open questions about the mutual compatibility of various numerical results reported in the recent literature , we believe that it is premature to attempt a detailed comparison of vish2 + 1 with experimental data , in order to empirically constrain the specific shear viscosity of the qgp . instead , we concentrate in this paper on describing and trying to understand the robustness of a variety of fluid dynamical effects generated by shear viscosity in a relativistic qgp fluid .",
    "we report here only results for cu+cu collisions , with initial entropy densities exceeding significantly those that can be reached in such collisions at rhic .",
    "the reasons for doing so are purely technical : initially our numerical grid was not large enough to accomodate au+au collision fireballs with sufficient resolution , and while this restriction has been lifted in the meantime , a large body of instructive numerical results had already been accumulated which would have been quite expensive to recreate for the au+au system .",
    "the unrealistic choice of initial conditions was driven by the wish to allow for a sufficiently long lifetime of the qgp phase even in peripheral cu+cu collisions such that shear viscous effects on elliptic flow are still dominated by the quark - gluon plasma stage .",
    "the main goals of the present paper are : ( i ) to quantitatively establish shear viscous effects on the evolution of the energy and entropy density , of the flow profile , source eccentricity , and total momentum anisotropy , on the final hadron spectra , and on the elliptic flow in central and non - central heavy - ion collisions , under the influence of different equations of state ; and ( ii ) to explore in detail and explain physically how these effects arise , trying to extract general rules and generic features which should also apply for other collision systems and collision energies .",
    "we note that recent calculations for au+au collisions @xcite have shown that viscous effects are somewhat bigger in the smaller cu+cu studied here than in the larger au+au system for which the largest body of experimental data exists .",
    "the reader must therefore apply caution when trying to compare ( in his or her mind s eye ) our results with the well - known rhic au+au data .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section [ sec2 ] gives a brief review of the israel - stewart formalism for causal relativistic hydrodynamics for dissipative fluids , lists the specific form of these equations for the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional evolution of non - central collision fireballs with boost - invariant longitudinal expansion which are solved by vish2 + 1 , and details the initial consditions and the equation of state ( eos ) employed in our calculations . in section [ sec3 ] we report results for central ( @xmath17 ) cu+cu collisions . section [ sec4 ] gives results for non - central collisions , including a detailed analysis of the driving forces behind the strong shear viscous effects on elliptic flow observed by us . in section [ sec5 ] we explore the influence of different initializations and different relaxation times for the viscous shear pressure tensor on the hydrodynamic evolution and establish the limits of applicability for viscous hydrodynamics in the calculation of hadron spectra .",
    "some technical details and the numerical tests performed to verify the accuracy of the computer code are discussed in appendices [ appa]-[appd ] , and in appendix  [ appe ] we compare our hydrodynamic results with analytical estimates of shear viscous effects by teaney @xcite that were based on navier - stokes theory and a blast - wave model parametrization of the fireball .",
    "in this section , we review briefly the 2nd order israel - stewart formalism for viscous relativistic hydrodynamics and the specific set of equations solved by vish2 + 1 for anisotropic transverse expansion in longitudinally boost - invariant fireballs .",
    "details of the derivation can be found in @xcite , with a small correction pointed out by baier _",

    "the instantantaneous identification ( [ pimunu ] ) leads to causality problems through instantaneous signal propagation , so that this straightforward relativistic generalization of the navier - stokes formalism turns out not to be a viable relativistic theory .",
    "the israel - stewart approach @xcite avoids these problems by replacing the instantaneous identifications ( [ pimunu ] ) with the kinetic evolution equations @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the time derivative in the local fluid rest frame , and the last term in the bottom equation ensures that the kinetic evolution preserves the tracelessness and transversality of @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "@xmath36 and @xmath37 are relaxation times and related to the 2nd order expansion coefficients in the entropy current @xcite . the fact that in the israel - stewart approach the dissipative flows @xmath22 and @xmath25 no longer respond to the corresponding thermodynamic forces @xmath38 and @xmath39 instantaneously , but on finite albeit short kinetic time scales , restores causality of the theory @xcite .",

    "bulk viscosity vanishes classically for a system of massless partons , and quantum corrections arising from the trace anomaly of the energy - momentum tensor are expected to be small , rendering bulk viscous effects much less important than those from shear viscosity .",
