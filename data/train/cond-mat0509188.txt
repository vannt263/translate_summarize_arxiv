    "high - temperature superconductors ( htsc ) have attracted an unprecedented interest in the solid - state community , yet the number of open issues largely exceeds the number of generally accepted points . among the latter , we can count the crucial role of strong electron - electron repulsion .",
    "this immediately raises the question of the competition and coexistence between this repulsion and the attraction between quasiparticles responsible of the superconducting phenomenon .    in this work",
    ", we make a step back , and we consider a simpler and more `` phenomenological '' question , that is the possibility to explain some features of the htsc physics simply in term of a crossover between a conventional ( bcs ) superconductivity ( characterizing the overdoped compounds ) and a sort of strong - coupling bose - einstein ( be ) superconductivity ( in the underdoped region).@xcite a number of properties of the cuprates can in fact be qualitatively described in this framework .",
    "notable examples are the intermediate values ( @xmath4  ) of the superconducting coherence length @xmath5 in optimally doped compounds@xcite , and the pseudogap phenomenology in the underdoped compounds@xcite , which can be ascribed to a `` preformed pairs '' phase , in which the superconducting order parameter has a finite amplitude , but it lacks phase coherence . the strongest connection with the physics of a bcs - be crossover is perhaps the evolution with doping of the relevant energy scales controlling the stability of the superconducting condensate , namely the gap @xmath0 , which is proportional to the binding energy of the cooper pairs , and the superfluid stiffness @xmath1 , which represents the energy cost for phase fluctuations . in the underdoped compound",
    "there is a clear experimental evidence@xcite that @xmath6 and @xmath2 is proportional to the `` weak link of the chain '' @xmath1 according to the so - called uemura plot@xcite , whereas for higher doping a more conventional direct proportionality of @xmath2 on @xmath0 is recovered .",
    "however some obstacles arise trying to push further this line of thought .",
    "for instance , the unconventional @xmath7wave symmetry of the order parameter , with the related presence of quasiparticle excitations down to zero energy , is known to strongly affect the low - temperature thermodynamic properties .",
    "in particular the nodal quasiparticles can dominate the low - temperature charge@xcite and thermal transport even in the strong - coupling regime , invalidating a purely bosonic description .",
    "it is also intuitively hard to reconcile the bcs - be crossover scenario with the relevance of strong correlation effects , which are naturally larger and larger when the doping is reduced and the mott insulator is approached .",
    "then , in the bcs - be scenario , the attraction should be stronger in the same region where the repulsion is maximum .",
    "this puzzling fact can be understood by interpreting the bcs - be physics as relevant only for _ low - energy _",
    "quasiparticles , while the high - energy physics has to be dominated by coulomb repulsion .",
    "an explicit realization of a similar scenario has been obtained in models with orbital degeneracy and specific kind of interactions@xcite , where the superconducting properties of the strongly renormalized quasiparticles share similarity with those of an effective attractive hubbard model@xcite .    keeping in mind those limitations",
    ", we find it important to understand if , and to what extent , a simple attractive picture for quasiparticles , modelized by an attractive hubbard model , is able to reproduce some of the properties of the cuprates .",
    "we will find that while some of the properties of the superconducting phase can be put in this framework , the normal state behavior necessarily requires the inclusion of strong repulsive correlations .",
    "the hamiltonian of the attractive hubbard model reads @xmath8 where @xmath9 indicates that the first sum is restricted to nearest neighbors sites only , @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) creates ( destroys ) an electron with spin @xmath12 on the site @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the number operator ; @xmath15 is the hopping amplitude and @xmath16 is the hubbard on - site attraction .",
    "as it can easily seen , this model reproduces in the extreme weak- and strong - coupling limit the bcs and be regime respectively , and allows to move in the whole crossover region , simply by adjusting a single parameter , the ratio @xmath17 .    from the theoretical point of view , a stringent test of the relevance of the crossover in the attractive hubbard model for the cuprates has been mainly limited by the lack of reliable non perturbative approaches able to follow the evolution from weak to strong coupling without a bias in some direction . in this work we use for this purpose the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft)@xcite , a non perturbative approach which neglects the spatial correlations beyond the mean field level , but",
    "fully retains the local quantum dynamics , and becomes exact in the infinite coordination limit .",
    "the local nature of the attraction and the non - perturbative nature of dmft are expected to lead to reliable results and allow for a democratic treatment of the different regimes and of the whole bcs - be crossover .",
    "the attractive hubbard model has been already investigated with dmft in the past , but the attention was focused mainly on the normal phase or on the determination of the critical temperature for the superconducting transition , with the recent exception of ref . , where the bcs - be crossover at @xmath18 is analyzed using iterated perturbation theory as an impurity solver , but the focus is mainly on spectral properties .",
    "more precisely , by explicitly avoiding superconducting solutions , a phase transition has been found both at finite@xcite and at zero temperature@xcite between a metal and a `` paired '' phase , i.e. , a collection of independent pairs without the superconducting phase coherence .",
    "this paired phase represent the negative-@xmath16 counterpart of the paramagnetic mott insulator found for the repulsive hubbard model@xcite .    with",
    "the present work we complete the dmft analysis of this model reported in the refs . with a careful investigation of the properties of the superconducting phase ,",
    "certainly stable at low temperatures .",
    "although the onset of the superconductivity smoothes the abrupt changes observed in the low - temperature metastable normal phase , and the evolution of the superconducting phase as the coupling is increased is a smooth crossover , the way in which the energetics changes in this process is extremely interesting .",
    "we fully characterize the crossover from bcs to be superconductivity , and we establish that the intermediate regime , where the maximum @xmath2 is obtained , shares the behavior of the strong - coupling , be superconductivity .",
    "in particular , this means that the `` optimal '' superconductor is stabilized by a kinetic energy gain , as it is expected in the bosonic regime , as opposed to the standard potential energy stabilization characteristic of weak - coupling superconductivity .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : sec .",
    "ii briefly describes the dmft for an s - wave superconductor , sec .",
    "iii is devoted to the evolution of the superfluid stiffness and the gap as a function of the interaction , sec .",
    "iv presents the energetic balance at the superconducting transition , and the relation with optical measurements .",
    "v is dedicated to concluding remarks .",
    "in this section we will briefly introduce dmft and some aspects related to the study of superconducting solutions .",
    "dmft maps a quantum lattice model onto an impurity model whose hybridization function ( usually called weiss field in analogy with classical mean - field theories ) is determined by means a self - consistent equation .",
    "the latter equation contains the information about the original lattice only through the non - interacting density of states . in our case ( [ hubbard ] )",
    "is mapped onto an anderson model with attractive coupling . in order to describe the superconducting phase ,",
    "the bath presents superconducting terms leading to an anomalous weiss field @xmath19   + { \\cal{h}}_{loc } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the on - site term , and the chemical potential @xmath21 is adjusted to fix the particle density on the impurity site ( in our calculations we always fix @xmath22 as a generic density out of half - filling , as done in refs . ) .    from the impurity model",
    "we compute the normal and anomalous green s functions , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , which are used to build the matrix @xmath25 in nambu - gorkov formalism .",
    "analogously one can define a matrix of weiss fields whose diagonal @xmath26 and off - diagonal @xmath27 elements are related to the parameters appearing in ( [ aim ] ) by @xmath28 the two above quantity also define the local self - energy matrix @xmath29    the self - consistency condition relates the weiss field to the green s function .",
    "we work with an infinite - coordination bethe lattice with semicircular density of states of half - bandwidth @xmath30 , ( i.e. , @xmath31 ) , for which the self - consistency reads @xmath32 @xmath33 being the pauli matrices .",
    "it is straightforward to check that eqs .",
    "( [ aim])-([selfbethe ] ) reduce automatically to their normal - state counterparts as soon @xmath34 for each @xmath35 .",
    "the inclusion of local quantum fluctuations rules out the possibility to analytically solve eqs .",
    "( [ aim])-([selfbethe ] ) , and requires numerical ( or approximate ) solutions of the anderson impurity model ( [ aim ] ) . here",
    "we adopt exact diagonalization ( ed ) as the impurity solver .",
    "thus , we discretize the anderson model , by truncating the sums in eqs .",
    "( [ aim ] ) and ( [ gf0 ] ) to a small finite number of levels @xmath36 .",
    "it has been shown that extremely small values of @xmath36 provide really good results for thermodynamic properties and reliable results for spectral functions.@xcite here we use both the lanczos algorithm ( at zero temperature ) and the finite temperature algorithm in its simplest version , which requires the full spectrum of the hamiltonian matrix . to obtain the full spectrum of the hamiltonian , needed to compute the finite temperature properties ,",
    "we are forced to a rather small value of @xmath37 , namely @xmath38 , whereas in the zero temperature case the lanczos algorithm allow us to deal with larger systems , up to @xmath39 also in the superconducting phase , where the number of particles is not conserved , making the size of the hilbert space larger .",
    "as we anticipated in the introduction , a landmark of the htsc phase - diagram is the crossing of the energy scales relevant for superconductivity : the superconducting gap @xmath0 and the superfluid stiffness @xmath1 , which represent respectively the energetic cost to form a cooper pair and to break the phase coherence of the superconducting phase .",
    "dmft allows for a straightforward calculation of the order parameter @xmath0 at zero temperature , defined through the local anomalous green s function @xmath40 we note that the values for @xmath41 obtained with this standard `` mean - field '' definition coincides almost exactly with the anomalous part of the self - energy @xmath42 at large @xmath43 . in our approach @xmath44",
    "is frequency dependent , with a small reduction at small matsubara frequencies with respect to the large @xmath43 value . in most cases",
    "we find that the above reduction is quite small and @xmath45 .",

    "the evaluation of @xmath52 would require the calculation of the corresponding four - field correlation function , but a remarkable simplification occurs in the infinite coordination limit where the dmft is exact , since all the vertex corrections to the e.m .",

[",

    "this means that it is possible to identify @xmath65 with @xmath66 in a wide range of couplings .",
    "it is clear that this results depends on the neglect of small - momentum collective modes , which can deplete the condensate@xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the presence of a frequency - dependent self - energy and of an incoherent part of the green s function does not lead to a reduction to a depletion of @xmath1 , differently from what happens , for instance , for impurity scattering .",
    "we now come to the evolution of the energy scales inherent to the superconducting phase as a function of the interaction .",
    "our results are summarized by fig .",

    ". @xmath0 is smallest in the weak - coupling regime , and the superfluid stiffness becomes the lowest scale in strong - coupling .",
    "it is natural that the system becomes superconductor only when the pairs are formed and they have phase coherence , namely when the temperature is lower than both the gap scale and the superfluid stiffness scale .",
    "therefore the critical temperature is substantially determined by the smaller scale at each interaction .",
    "thus the critical temperature is proportional to @xmath0 in the weak - coupling regime , as predicted by bcs mean - field , while in the strong - coupling limit we recover @xmath68 , as predicted by the mean - field solution in the limit of an hard core boson system with heisenberg coupling @xmath69@xcite     ( color online ) superconducting energy scales ( in unit of @xmath30 ) ( @xmath41 and @xmath1 have been normalized to be directly comparable with @xmath2 in the asymptotic regimes ) .",

    "therefore only in the proximity of the weak coupling regime the smallest energy scale , which ultimately determines @xmath2 , is the binding energy of the cooper pairs , whereas already at the optimal @xmath16 ( and of course in all the strong coupling regime ) the weak link for the stability of the superconducting phase is the superfluid stiffness @xmath1 ( hence , the onset of the superconductivity is controlled by the phase - coherence ) .",
    "in other words , the optimal superconductivity is achieved in a regime where the physics is already that of strong - coupling , with pair formation occurring at a temperature higher than @xmath2 .",

    "there is however a more basic reason for the inadequacy of the attractive hubbard model to capture the temperature behavior of the normal phase of the cuprates , which is the inability to properly describe the approach to the mott insulator as the doping is reduced .",
    "the underdoped region is indeed almost universally believed to be dominated by the physics of a doped mott insulator , with strongly renormalized quasiparticles . on the other hand ,",
    "the strong - coupling region of our bcs - be framework is certainly a `` correlated '' regime , with renormalized quasiparticles , but the interaction is simply the attractive one , which does not lead to the mott insulating state . indeed in a recent work@xcite it has been explicitly shown that the physics of a doped mott insulating system , with its associated band - narrowing , may represent the natural explanation for the strong temperature dependence of the spectral observed in the normal phase of the cuprates .",
    "in this paper we have performed a detailed investigation of the physics of superconducting phase in the attractive hubbard model both at zero and at finite temperature .",
    "the approach used here , namely the dynamical mean field theory , is completely non - perturbative allowing for a treatment of the superconducting phase properties , which is not tied in principle either to the weak - coupling ( bcs ) or to the strong - coupling ( be ) regime .",
    "in particular we have investigated the behavior of the energy scales relevant for the superconductivity as a function of the pairing interaction @xmath16 .",
    "we have found that the evolution of the superfluid density @xmath1 and the superconducting gap @xmath0 displays a clear crossing in the intermediate coupling regime , which is reminiscent of what is found experimentally in the phase - diagram of htsc for different doping levels . in the weak - coupling region",
    "the bcs picture works well and the superconductivity is controlled by the binding energy of the cooper pairs @xmath0 ; on the contrary when the pairing interaction is high the superconductivity becomes essentially a phenomenon of superfluidity of preformed local pairs .",
    "this is clearly witnessed by the direct proportionality found in this regime between @xmath2 and @xmath1 , and showed in a sort of `` uemura - plot '' for the attractive hubbard model .",
    "we also consider explicitly the problem of superconductivity suppression due to phase fluctuations in the hydrodynamic regime , which is usually neglected in a dmft framework .",
    "our dmft calculation of the compressibility indicates that , contrary to the claim of ref .",
    "@xcite , the phase - fluctuation effects do not destroy superconductivity , even for extremely large values of @xmath16 .",
    "the analysis of the superconducting phase properties in the attractive hubbard model has been then further enriched by considering the energetic stabilization of the superconductivity and the f sum - rule of the model .",
    "our results clearly show a remarkable difference in the energetic balance responsible for the stabilization of superconducting order when moving along the bcs - be crossover . while in the weak - coupling regime the onset of superconductivity is associated to a gain of potential energy and a slight loss in kinetic energy as it is expected in a bcs picture , already in the intermediate coupling at @xmath135 and specifically in proximity of the maximum of the @xmath2 dome , the situation is completely reversed . here , and for higher values of @xmath16 , the stabilization of the superconductivity is due to a marked reduction of @xmath83 , while a smaller ( but sizable ) loss of potential energy is observed .",
    "therefore the onset of superconductivity is clearly distinct from cooper pair formation already for moderate values of the pairing interaction .",
    "the energetic balance at the superconducting transition finds a direct experimental counterpart in the optical measurements , since the integral of the optical conductivity is proportional to the kinetic energy itself .",
    "our results can be rephrased in this terms , so that in weak - coupling a slight reduction of the optical sumrule is found in our calculation at the superconducting transition , while a relevant enhancement of the sumrule is observed for @xmath136 in the whole intermediate - to - strong coupling region .",
    "this scenario is actually realized in optical measurements in the htsc cuprates as a function of doping , with overdoped samples behaving more or less as standard bcs superconductors , and underdoped one , characterized by a gain in kinetic energy@xcite .",
    "a more quantitative comparison with the experiments reveals that the variations of both kinetic energy and condensation energy between @xmath18 and @xmath2 are reasonably well reproduced by our model , which also correctly predicts that a sizable fraction of the kinetic energy gain is canceled by the potential energy loss , leading to a condensation energy significantly smaller than the kinetic energy gain , as it indeed happens@xcite in the htsc .",
    "it must be noticed that our calculation tends to overestimate both kinetic energy gain and condensation energy .",
    "however , the main limitation of the attractive hubbard model in this context is the inability to capture the @xmath131 enhancement of the spectral weight in the normal phase above @xmath2 .",
    "the main reason for this disagreement is likely the complete neglect of the strong repulsive interactions characterizing the underdoped cuprates close to the mott state .",
    "( color online ) same quantities of fig .",
    "2 plotted as a function of @xmath137 . both @xmath1 and @xmath0 are normalized by @xmath16 .",
    "now the crossing between the superconducting gap @xmath0 and the superfluid stiffness at @xmath138 , occurs in the proximity of the maximum value of @xmath2.,width=302 ]    an important outcome of our analysis is that the optimal critical temperature is obtained for an interaction strength well inside the be region .",
    "this finding is in good agreement with previous calculations of the pseudogap temperature @xmath139 extracted from the spin susceptibility and specific heat , where the @xmath139 is significantly larger than @xmath2 at optimal interaction@xcite , but it is in contrast with experiments in bismuth and yttrium based cuprates , where @xmath139 tends to vanish close to optimal doping . it is interesting to notice that this discrepancy seems to disappear if we fix the attraction strength @xmath16 and follow the bcs - be crossover by varying the half - bandwidth @xmath30 , and measuring energies in units of @xmath16 . such a rescaling is meant to roughly describe a situation in which the crossover from bcs to be is due to a shrinking of the coherent band due to strong repulsive correlation effects which are stronger and stronger as the mott insulator is approached , while the attraction , which we might think to arise from antiferromagnetic superexchange for the sake of definiteness , is basically unrenormalized in the same process .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cross_vsd ] , the maximum critical temperature now occurs for @xmath140 , at the boundary of the bcs region , where the pseudogap is small .",
    "however this different perspective , in which the optimal @xmath2 moves closer to the bcs region is in contradiction with the experimental evidence of a kinetic - energy driven superconductivity around optimal doping , which is qualitatively obtained in the be regime .    as a summary of our results , we can draw some final considerations on the the connection of the bcs - be crossover scenario and the physics of the htsc : several qualitative feature of the htsc properties ( as the crossing of the hierarchy of @xmath1 and @xmath41 , the uemura plot ,  ) can be actually captured within a purely attractive description . however , as a general trend , it provides too high estimation of the values of many thermodynamic quantities as the kinetic energy variation below @xmath2 and the condensation energy . at the same time",
    "the purely attractive description fails in reproducing the magnitude of the temperature dependence of the optical spectral weight above @xmath2 , calling for the inclusion of strong correlation effect and suggesting that a closer agreements with the physics of the cuprates may be obtained by applying the attractive hubbard description , or more generally the bcs - be crossover picture , only to the narrow quasiparticle excitations characteristic of a doped mott insulator .",
    "models in which explicit attractive and repulsive interaction are present@xcite are natural candidates to explore this scenario .",
    "after completion of this work , we became aware of recent cellular dmft@xcite results by kyung , georges and tremblay ( cond - mat/0508645 ) , where it is proposed that the inclusion of short range correlations beyond single - site dmft makes the evolution on the normal state continuous , and the zero - temperature energetic balance of the superconducting transition is studied .",
