    "the process of bremsstrahlung from high - energy electron occurs over a rather long distance , known as the formation length .",
    "if anything happens to an electron or a photon while traveling this distance , the emission can be disrupted .",
    "landau and pomeranchuk showed that if the formation length of bremsstrahlung becomes comparable to the distance over which a mean angle of multiple scattering becomes comparable with a characteristic angle of radiation , the bremsstrahlung will be suppressed @xcite .",
    "migdal @xcite , @xcite developed a quantitative theory of this phenomenon .",
    "an influence of polarization of a medium on radiation process leads also to suppression of the soft photon emission ( ter - mikaelian effect , see in @xcite ) .",
    "a very successful series of experiments @xcite - @xcite was performed at slac during last years . in these experiments",
    "the cross section of bremsstrahlung of soft photons with energy from 200  kev to 500  mev from electrons with energy 8  gev and 25  gev is measured with an accuracy of the order of a few percent .",
    "both lpm and dielectric suppression is observed and investigated .",
    "these experiments were the challenge for the theory since in all the previous papers calculations ( cited in @xcite ) are performed to logarithmic accuracy which is not enough for description of the new experiment .",
    "the contribution of the coulomb corrections ( at least for heavy elements ) is larger then experimental errors and these corrections should be taken into account .",
    "very recently authors developed the new approach to the theory of lpm effect @xcite where the cross section of bremsstrahlung process in the photon energies region where the influence of the lpn is very strong was calculated with term @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is characteristic logarithm of the problem , and with the coulomb corrections taken into account . in the photon energy region , where the lpm effect is `` turned off ''",
    ", the obtained cross section gives the exact bethe - heitler cross section ( within power accuracy ) with coulomb corrections .",
    "this important feature was absent in the previous calculations .",
    "the contribution of an inelastic scattering of a projectile on atomic electrons is also included .",
    "the polarization of a medium is incorporated into this approach . the considerable contribution into the soft part of the measured spectrum of radiation",
    "gives a photon emission on the boundaries of a target .",
    "we calculated this contribution taking into account the multiple scattering and polarization of a medium for the case when a target is much thicker than the formation length of the radiation .",
    "we considered also a case when a target is much thinner than the formation length .",
    "a case of an intermediate thickness of a target ( between cases of a thick and a thin target ) is analyzed but polarization of a medium is not included .",
    "in the present paper we calculated the cross section of bremsstrahlung process in a target of intermediate thickness . in section 2",
    "we derived general expression for the spectral probability of radiation in a thin target and in a target with intermediate thickness where the multiple scattering , the polarization of a medium and radiation on boundaries of a target are taken into account . the representations suitable for numerical calculations are derived .",
    "useful asymptotic formulae are found . in section 3 qualitative picture of the phenomenon",
    "is discussed in detail . in section 4",
    "we compare the calculated spectral curves with recent experimental data @xcite where electrons with energy @xmath2 and @xmath3 radiated in a gold target with thickness @xmath4 .",
    "agreement between theory and data is perfect for @xmath5 at electron energy @xmath2 , for the same target and @xmath3 agreement is satisfactory .",
    "proceeding from the formulation of @xcite ( see section 4 ) we can obtain general expression which takes into account boundary effects for a target of arbitrary thickness . with allowance for multiple scattering and polarization of a medium we have for the spectral distribution of the probability of radiation @xmath6 where @xmath7 here @xmath8 is the energy of the initial electron , @xmath9 is the energy of radiated photon , @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the density of the atoms in a medium , @xmath12 is the thickness of a target .",

    "a target remains thick for all photon energies and radiation is described in details by formulae of sections 2 and 3 of @xcite where comparison with experimental data was carried out as well .",
    "for very high energies when the lpm effect becomes significant at @xmath206 eq.([36 ] ) should be substituted by @xmath207 so that @xmath208 it is evident that for @xmath209 the radiation losses diminish ( for very rough estimation one can use as reduction factor @xmath210 ) and due to this the radiation length enlarges .",
    "of course , for the electron energy @xmath2 this effect is very weak ( order of @xmath211 ) .",
    "however , for very high energy it becomes quite sizable .",
    "for example , for the electron energy @xmath212 this effect is of the order of @xmath213 .",
    "there is , in principle , an opportunity to measure the electron energy ( in region of high energies ) using the lpm effect . for this one can measure the spectral curve on a target with thickness a few percent of @xmath214 and compare the result with the theory prediction @xcite .",
    "existence of the plateau of the spectral curve in a region of photon energies where a target is thin was found in @xcite within migdal approach ( quantum theory ) .",
    "recently this item was discussed in @xcite ( in classical theory ) , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in @xcite the qualitative analysis of the data @xcite-@xcite was performed .",
    "it was noted that for targets with thickness @xmath215 the formation length of radiation @xmath216 for any photon energy @xmath9 .",
    "so , these targets can be considered as thick targets .",
    "the gold targets with thickness @xmath217 and @xmath218 are an exception .",
    "we calculated energy losses spectra in these targets for the initial electron energy @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the characteristic parameters of radiation for these cases are given in table .",
    "in fig.1(a ) results of calculations are given for target with a thickness @xmath219 at @xmath2 .",
    "the curves 1,2,3,4 present correspondingly the functions @xmath220 ( [ 12 ] ) . at @xmath221",
    "the value @xmath222 , the interference terms are exponentially small and one can use formulae for a thick target . in this case the parameter @xmath223 and contribution of boundary photons ( @xmath224 ) is small ( @xmath225 , see @xcite , eq.(4.16 ) ) and distinction bethe - heitler formula ( @xmath226 ) from @xmath227 is of the order 10% according with asymptotic damping factor @xmath228 .    at @xmath229 for the case @xmath230 and @xmath231 the spectral curve turns into plateau according with discussion in previous section . in this photon energy region the parameter @xmath232 and eq.([24 ] ) for a target with intermediate thickness describes the spectral probability of radiation with a good accuracy . with the further photon energy decrease",
    "one can use limiting formula ( [ 26 ] ) where @xmath233 .",
    "note , that in formulae for @xmath234 the potential @xmath34 ( [ 5 ] ) is used which does nt include corrections @xmath235 .",
    "these corrections were calculated in @xcite both thin and thick targets . in our case ( @xmath236 ) the expressions with corrections @xmath139 are given in ( [ 25a ] ) and ( [ 31 ] ) for a thick target and a thin target respectively .",
    "taking into account behaviors of correction in the region @xmath237 ( curve 2 in fig.2(a ) of @xcite ) we construct an interpolation factor for term @xmath139 with accuracy of order 1% . the summary curve ( @xmath57 ) in fig.1(a ) contains this factor .",
    "the transition radiation contributes in the region @xmath238 ( function @xmath239 , curve 5 in fig.1(a ) ) .",
    "when @xmath133 this curve is described by asymptotic of @xmath239 ( [ 24 ] ) . the contribution of the transition radiation increases with @xmath9 decrease and for @xmath240 it describes by eq.([34 ] ) . the contribution of the multiple scattering diminishes due to interference factor @xmath241 in ( [ 35 ] ) ( at @xmath242 ) .",
    "the curve @xmath57 in fig.1(a ) gives the summary contribution of the multiple scattering ( the curve @xmath243 , where factor @xmath244 is included ) and the transition radiation ( the curve 5 ) .    in fig.1(b )",
    "results of calculations are given for target with a thickness @xmath219 at @xmath3 .",
    "the notations are the same as in fig.1(a ) . in this case",
    "the characteristic photon energy @xmath245 is one order of magnitude lower than for @xmath2 , so that at @xmath221 the parameter @xmath108 is small ( @xmath246 ) .",
    "because of this the right part of the curve @xmath243 coincides with a good accuracy with bethe - heitler formula ( the coulomb corrections are included ) .",
    "note , that for this electron energy the effect of recoil ( factor @xmath244 ) is more essential .",
    "strictly speaking , a target with a thickness @xmath247 at @xmath3 is not thin target for any photon energy ( @xmath248 ) .",
    "however , for bremsstrahlung this target can be considered as a thin one for @xmath249 .",
    "since the polarization of a medium becomes essential in the same region ( @xmath250 ) , the interference factor @xmath241 in ( [ 35 ] ) causes an inflection of the spectral curve @xmath243 at @xmath251 .",
    "the transition radiation grows from the same photon energy @xmath9 and because of this the total spectral curve @xmath57 has a minimum at @xmath252 .",
    "as far as there is some interval of energies between @xmath96 and @xmath253 ( @xmath254 ) , this minimum is enough wide .",
    "moreover , the value of its ordinate coincide with a good accuracy with ordinate of the plateau of the spectral curve @xmath243 in fig.1(a ) because bremsstrahlung on a thin target is independent of electron energy ( [ 31 ] ) .    in fig.2(a ) results of calculations are given for target with a thickness @xmath255 at @xmath2 .",
    "the notations are the same as in fig.1(a ) . for this thickness @xmath256 and one",
    "has a thin target starting from @xmath193 .",
    "so , we have here very wide plateau .",
    "the left edge of the plateau is defined by the contribution of transition radiation ( @xmath257 ) . since in this case",
    "@xmath258 ( see ( [ 30])@xmath259([33 ] ) ) , one has to calculate the ordinate of the plateau using the exact formula for a thin target ( [ 30 ] ) .",
    "the same ordinate has the plateau for electron energy @xmath3 ( fig.2(b ) ) .",
    "however , a width of the plateau for this electron energy is more narrow ( @xmath260 ) due to diminishing of the interval between @xmath96 and @xmath245 .",
    "for @xmath261 the formation length of radiation becomes shorter than target thickness ( @xmath262 ) and the parameter @xmath108 decreases .",
    "the value @xmath263 increases with @xmath9 growth .",
    "a target becomes thick and the spectral curves is described by the bethe - heitler formula in fig.2(b ) starting from photon energy @xmath264 . in fig.2(b ) the contributions of separate terms into @xmath120 are shown as well .",
    "their behavior at @xmath261 is described quite satisfactory by formulae ( [ 22e])-([22f ] ) ( see also discussion at their derivation ) .",
    "we compared our calculations with experimental data @xcite .",
    "the curves @xmath57 in fig.1,2 give theory prediction ( no fitting parameters ! ) in units @xmath265 .",
    "we recalculated data according with given in @xcite procedure @xmath266 it is seen that in fig.1(a ) there is a perfect agreement of the theory and data . in fig.1(b ) there a overall difference : data is order of @xmath267 are higher than theory curve .",
    "for photon energy @xmath221 the theory coincide with bethe - heitler formula ( with the coulomb corrections ) applicable for this energy .",
    "note that just for this case it was similar problem with normalization of data matching with the migdal monte carlo simulation ( @xmath268 , see table ii in @xcite ) .    for thickness",
    "@xmath269 there is a qualitative difference between our theory prediction and monte carlo simulation in @xcite .",
    "there was a number of experimental uncertainties associated with this target .",
    "nevertheless , we show data for @xmath2 which are lying higher than theory curve .    for target with a thickness @xmath219 at @xmath2 data",
    "was compared with calculation in @xcite ( the coulomb corrections were discarded ) . after arbitrary diminishing of calculated value by @xmath270 it was found excellent agreement .",
    "it is seen from the above analysis that this subtraction can be considered as taking account of the coulomb corrections contribution .",
