    "a seminal idea of parity - time ( @xmath0)-symmetric quantum mechanics  [ , ] , that has stated that the condition of hermiticity in standard quantum mechanics required for physical observables and energy spectrum to be real can be replaced by a less restrictive requirement of invariance under combined parity and time - reversal symmetry , triggered an explosive development of a new branch of science .",

    "we propose a general complex spin hamiltonian , in which slonczewski stt emerges from an imaginary magnetic field . the @xmath0-symmetric version of the hamiltonian is shown to exhibit a phase transition associated with inability of the system to sustain the balance between loss and gain above a certain threshold of external nonconservative field .",
    "in the classical limit of a large spin , our formalism reproduces the standard landau - lifshitz - gilbert - slonczewski  [ ] ( llgs ) equation of spin dynamics and predicts the @xmath0 symmetry - breaking phase transition between stationary ( conservative ) and dissipative ( nonconservative ) spin dynamics . in this letter",
    "we focus on a single spin , yet our theory can be extended to coupled spin systems in higher dimensions . moreover , as spin physics maps onto a wealth of strongly correlated systems and phenomena ranging from superconductivity to cold - atom and two - level systems , our results provide quantitative perspectives on the nature of phase transitions associated with @xmath0 symmetry breaking in a broad class of far - from - equilibrium systems .",
