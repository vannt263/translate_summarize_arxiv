    "vibro - impacting systems belong to a very interesting and important class of nonsmooth and nonlinear dynamical systems dibernardo2008,luo2006,awrejcewicz2003,filippov1988  with important technological applications stronge2000,mehta1994,knudsen1992,wiercigroch2008 .",
    "dynamics of such systems can be extremely complicated due to velocity discontinuity arising upon impacts .",
    "a very characteristic feature of such systems is the presence of nonstandard bifurcations such as border - collisions and grazing impacts which often lead to complex chaotic motions .",
    "the poincar map , describing evolution from an impact to the next impact , is a natural tool to study vibro - impacting systems .",
    "the main difficulty with investigating impacting systems is in finding instant of the next impact what typically involves solving a nonlinear equation .",
    "however , the problem can be simplified in the case of a bouncing ball dynamics assuming a special motion of the limiter .",
    "bouncing ball models have been extensively studied , see @xcite  and references therein . as a motivation that inspired this work ,",
    "we mention study of physics and transport of granular matter @xcite .",
    "a similar model has been also used to describe the motion of railway bogies @xcite .",
    "recently , we have considered several models of motion of a material point in a gravitational field colliding with a limiter moving with piecewise constant velocity @xcite . in the present paper",
    "more realistic yet still simple models are considered .",
    "the purpose of this work is to approximate sinusoidal motion as exactly as possible but still preserving possibility of analytical computations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 a one dimensional dynamics of a ball moving in a gravitational field and colliding with a table is considered and poincar map is constructed .",
    "dependence of displacement of the table on time is assumed as quadratic and cubic functions of time , respectively . in section 3",
    "bifurcation diagrams for such models of table motion are computed and compared with the case of sinusoidal motion .",
    "we consider a motion of a small ball moving vertically in a gravitational field and colliding with a moving table , representing unilateral constraints .",
    "the ball is treated as a material point while the limiter s mass is assumed so large that its motion is not affected at impacts .",
    "a motion of the ball between impacts is described by the newton s law of motion:@xmath0where @xmath1 and motion of the limiter is:@xmath2with a known function @xmath3 .",
    "we shall also assume that @xmath3 is a continuous function of time .",
    "impacts are modeled as follows : @xmath4where duration of an impact is neglected with respect to time of motion between impacts . in eqs .",
    "( [ position ] ) , ( [ velocity ] ) @xmath5 stands for time of the @xmath6-th impact while @xmath7 , @xmath8are left - sided and right - sided limits of @xmath9 for @xmath10 , respectively , and @xmath11 is the coefficient of restitution , @xmath12 @xcite .    solving eq .",
    "( [ point motion ] ) and applying impact conditions ( position ) , ( [ velocity ] ) we derive the poincar map @xcite :    [ tv ] @xmath13where @xmath14 .",
    "the limiter s motion has been typically assumed in form @xmath15 , cf . @xcite and references therein .",
    "this choice leads to serious difficulties in solving the first of eqs.([tv ] ) for @xmath16 , thus making analytical investigations of dynamics hardly possible .",
    "accordingly , we have decided to simplify the limiter s periodic motion to make ( [ t ] ) solvable .    in our previous papers",
    "we have assumed displacement of the table as the following periodic function of time :    @xmath17    with @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the floor function  the largest integer less than or equal to @xmath21 . in this work",
    "the function @xmath22 is assumed as quadratic @xmath23 and two cubic functions of time , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "more exactly , these functions read:@xmath26@xmath27@xmath28see figs . 1 , 2 , 3 .    @xmath29{fig1a.eps}\\ ] ]    the function @xmath23 , consisting of two parabolas , and",
    "its first derivative are continuous , however its second derivative is discontinuous at @xmath30 .",
    "the function @xmath24 is smooth but provides a poorer approximation to @xmath31 then @xmath32 .",
    "we have included this function because it is smooth and is the lowest - order polynomial approximating @xmath33 on the unit interval @xmath34 $ ] .",
    "@xmath29{fig1b.eps}\\ ] ]    the smooth function @xmath35 consists of four cubic functions and provides the best approximation to @xmath33 .",
    "let us note that for all these functions , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath35 , equation for @xmath16 , cf .",
    "( [ t ] ) , is solvable .",
    "@xmath29{fig1c.eps}\\ ] ]    our model consists thus of equation ( [ tv ] ) and one of eqs.([q ] ) , ( [ c1 ] ) , ( [ c2 ] ) with control parameters @xmath11 , @xmath36 . since the period of motion of the limiter is equal to one , the map ( [ tv ] ) is invariant under the translation @xmath37 .",
    "accordingly , all impact times @xmath38 can be reduced to the unit interval @xmath39 $ ] .",
    "we have computed bifurcation diagrams to study dependence of dynamics on the model of motion of the table .",
    "let us recall that in the case of displacement of the table described by piecewise linear function @xmath40 defined in eq.(l ) the bifurcation diagram differs significantly from that computed for sinusoidal displacement @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath41{fig2anew.eps}\\ ] ]    @xmath41{fig2bnew.eps}\\ ] ]    in the @xmath42 case only manifolds of periodic solutions were found to exist and there is no chaotic dynamics @xcite while for @xmath43 , classical attractors exist as well , but only one period doubling on route to chaos via corner bifurcation was reported @xcite in contradistinction to the case of sinusoidal displacement of the table where full period doubling scenario is generic @xcite .    the bifurcation diagram for the displacement function @xmath23 is shown in fig .",
    "4 . there are one 2-cycle ( ending after one period doubling ) and six fixed points ( first three are shown ) which become unstable at some @xmath44 where chaotic bands appear .",
    "there are no manifolds of periodic solutions .",
    "the bifurcation diagrams for functions @xmath24 and @xmath35 are presented in figs .",
    "5 and 6 , respectively .",
    "it can be seen that full cascades of period doubling with transition to chaos are present in fig .",
    "5 but it seems that some bifurcation paths end abruptly . moreover , periodic states loose stability in different order than for @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath41{fig2cnew.eps}\\ ] ]    @xmath41{fig2dnew.eps}\\ ] ]    we note finally that the bifurcation diagram computed for the displacement function @xmath35 , cf .",
    "6 , is very similar to the bifurcation diagram for the sine function @xmath33 , see fig .",
    "we have constructed several simple models of table motion in bouncing ball dynamics in order to approximate sinusoidal motion as exactly as possible . in conclusion",
    "we can state that dynamics of the model based on eqs .",
    "( [ tv ] ) , ( [ c2 ] ) corresponds well to dynamics with table displacement given by @xmath45 .",
    "moreover , equation for time of the next impact ( [ t ] ) is a third - order algebraic equation in @xmath46 for @xmath47 and thus analytical computations are possible .",
