    "as it stood at the turn of the 20th century , m. planck s quantum theory suggested that energy ( @xmath7 ) is associated with a certain periodic process of frequency ( @xmath8 ) , @xmath9 ; and a. einstein s mass - energy relation suggested the total energy of a particle ( @xmath7 ) is connected to its mass ( @xmath10 ) , @xmath11 .",
    "planck and einstein together implied that mass was associated with a periodic process @xmath12 , and accordingly a larger @xmath8 with a moving mass .",
    "incited by such a connection but also a clash with this from einstein s relativity theory which suggested a moving mass is associated with a slowing - down clock and thus a smaller @xmath8 , l. de broglie put forward in 1923 @xcite a hypothesis that a matter particle ( moving at velocity @xmath0 ) consists of an internal periodic process describable as a packet of phase waves of frequencies dispersed about @xmath8 , having a phase velocity @xmath13 , with @xmath1 the speed of light , and a group velocity of the phase - wave packet equal to @xmath0 . despite",
    "the hypothetic phase wave appeared supernatural and is today not held a standard physics notion , the de broglie wave has proven in modern physics to depict accurately the matter particles , and the de broglie relations proven their fundamental relations .",
    "so inevitably the puzzles with the de broglie wave persist , involving the hypothetic phase waves or not , and are unanswered prior to our recent unification work@xcite : what is waving with a de broglie wave and more generally schrdinger s wave function ? if de broglie s phase wave is indeed a reality , what is then transmitted at a speed ( @xmath14 ) being @xmath15 times the speed of light @xmath1 ?",
    "how is the de broglie ( phase ) wave related to the particle s charge , which if accelerated generates according to maxwell s theory electromagnetic ( em ) waves of speed @xmath1 , and how is it in turn related to the em waves , which are commonplace emitted or absorbed by a particle which changes its internal state ? in @xcite we showed that a physical model able to yield all of the essential properties of a de broglie particle , in terms of solutions in a unified framework of the three basic mechanics , is provided by a single harmonic oscillating , massless charge @xmath16 or @xmath17 ( termed a _ vaculeon _ ) and the resulting electromagnetic waves .",
    "the solutions for a basic material particle generally in motion , with the charge quantity ( accompanied with a spin ) and energy of the charge as the sole inputs , predict accurately the inertial mass , total wave function , total energy equal to the mass times @xmath18 , total momentum , kinetic energy and linear momentum of the particle , and that the particle is a de broglie wave , it obeys newton s laws of motion , the de broglie relations , the schrdinger equation in small geometries , newton s law of gravitation , and the galileo - lorentz - einstein transformation at high velocities . in this paper",
    "we give a self - contained illustration of the process by which the electromagnetic component waves of such a particle in motion superpose into a de broglie ( phase ) wave .",
