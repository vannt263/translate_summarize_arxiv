    "in recent years investigation of the unusual behaviour of random heteropolymers with a random sequence of different kinds of monomers has attracted considerable attention ( see @xcite-@xcite and references therein ) . with temperature decreasing such systems experience two types of phase transitions at which polymer either goes to freezing state or has a microphase separation that is inherent in protein biomolecules type .    at folding process heteropolymer chooses out of infinite set of possible states the unique frozen non - equilibrium but stationary state with fixed spatial conformation and monomer sequence ( type of dna ) .",
    "the problem in considering of such transitions is to build up more simple method of averaging thermodynamic values over the quenched disorder . here",
    ", the methods of statistical physics first used in spin glass investigation are taken as basic ones @xcite .",
    "certain of polymers type of block copolymers , undergo the so - called microphase separation at which blocks of different chemical composition segregate to microdomain structures to gain a spatially inhomogeneous composition throughout the pattern .",
    "the chemical bonds between the blocks prevent the usual macroscopic phase separation observed in homopolymer blends .",
    "a variety of microphases , such as one - dimensional lamellar structures , hexagonal arrays of cylinders , body - centered - cubic arrays of spheres and so on have been observed for simple diblock copolymer melts .    at first",
    ", microphase separation had been studied within mean - field approximation @xcite in the case of a - b block copolymers with arbitrary composition @xmath0 .",
    "it turns out that at @xmath1 with temperature decrease the system undergoes a sequence of the microphase separations of the first order , where period @xmath2 of space structure is of order of block length and does not depend on temperature .",
    "in @xcite it was shown a principal role of the fluctuations in phase transition . by virtue of condition",
    "@xmath3 the order parameter fluctuations give divergent contribution to thermodynamic values , so that continuous phase transition transforms to the first order weak transition @xcite .    at passage to random heteropolymers both the microphase separation and the freezing remain , but",
    "here the space period acquires strong dependence on temperature @xcite . according to field considerations @xcite",
    "the fluctuations suppress both mentioned transitions in random copolymers , but copolymer melts in disordered media can suffer these transformations .    similar to spin glass @xcite , the main approach of statistical mechanics of random heteropolymers is the replica method @xcite that is not only pragmatic , but very non - descriptive and artificial . apart from the replica trick , the transfer matrix method @xcite , kinetic approach @xcite and others ( see @xcite ) are used in random heteropolymers theory as well .",
    "however , it is a well known in theory of spin glass that within the framework of sherrington - kirkpatrick model @xcite both replica method and supersymmetry ( susy ) field approach give identical results @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the advantage of the susy field usage is that its components have explicit physical meaning @xcite .    by recent moment ,",
    "susy method in polymer theory had been proposed by vilgis @xcite , but did not obtain further development . in this work",
    "we intend to complete this problem .",
    "our article is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we build up an effective motion equation of disorder heteropolymer to describe the different monomer alternation along the heteropolymer chain @xcite .",
    "the form of effective hamiltonian of the problem under consideration is obtained in section 3 to avoid discrepancies of different methods .",
    "section 4 is devoted to consideration of a susy scheme @xcite that is optimal for study of the disorder heteropolymer in weak segregation limit @xcite . in section 5 a susy correlator",
    "is considered to examine memory and non - ergodicity effects ( section 6 ) .",
    "finally , section 7 is devoted to discussion of obtained results .",
    "usually , the susy method is based on the dynamic langevin - type motion equation @xcite .",
    "but covalent bonds in the polymer chain make such way inefficient because dynamic theory in polymers is much more complicated , than statistical mechanics of usual many - body systems @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is essential to obtain the effective motion equation instead of dynamic one .    let us initiate with directed polymer that is represented by the gaussian chain with probability @xmath4 to find the end - point @xmath5 at coordinate @xmath6 . as is known the function @xmath4 obeys the schrodinger - type equation with imagine time @xmath7",

    "apart from usual terms type of that in eq.([10 ] ) , effective motion equation for the field ( [ 17 ] ) must contain the inhomogeneity contribution @xmath53 ( as the first term in r.h.s . of eq.([4 ] ) ) that takes fourier transform @xmath54 . as a result , the motion equation for the fourier transformation    @xmath55    of the field ( [ 17 ] ) takes the langevin form :    @xmath56    here , as above , the continuum approximation for effective time @xmath57 is used , the characteristic distance @xmath58 is determined by the kuhn segment length @xmath11 , and determination of effective force @xmath59 ( cf .",

    "to obtain the effective hamiltonian @xmath62 @xcite in eq.([19 ] ) the thermodynamic potential @xmath63 , being the average with respect to both the conformation and the sequence scattering , should be determined as a function of the averaged order parameter    @xmath64    with this aim , let us write the partition function in the form of the functional integral @xcite    @xmath65    here @xmath66 is the composition flory parameter , the first @xmath48-function takes into account incompressibility condition , the second one reduces to determination ( [ 21 ] ) of order parameter @xmath67 .",
    "further , one follows to represent the @xmath48-functions as functional laplace expansions over auxiliary fields @xmath68 , @xmath69 .",

    "it is worth mentioning that expression ( [ 23 ] ) agrees with refs.@xcite , whereas in refs.@xcite , where replica approach was used , the second summand of hamiltonian ( [ 23 ] ) with the opposite sign was obtained . to correspond the self - action effects the integrand in last term has the usual expansion form @xcite    @xmath83     + as mentioned above ,",
    "this method is based on the eqs.([12 ] ) that allows to express quenched disorder correlator within the transfer matrix approach . if one uses the more popular replica method , then the field @xmath69 and the order parameter @xmath84 must take a replica index @xmath85 under which in the hamiltonian ( [ 23 ] ) the summation from @xmath86 to @xmath87 should be made @xcite",
    ". then the quadratic contribution takes the form    @xmath88     + where in the limit @xmath87 for coincided replica indices is @xmath89 .",
    "as it was found out in spin glasses , the peculiarity of the systems with quenched disorder is governed by the hierarchy of the phase space that is characterized by random overlapping of the different replicas @xcite .",
    "therefore overlapping parameter @xmath90 in the second term ( [ 3.36 ] ) is the stochastic variable under which the average should be made .",
    "let us take the corresponding distribution in the simplest gauss form    @xmath91     + where dispersion @xmath92 is given by parameter @xmath93 ( see @xcite ) .",

    "the distinction of mentioned terms makes itself evident in the fact that the former leads to renormalization of the value @xmath97 , whereas the latter corresponds to the memory and non - ergodic effects .    in order to carry out such renormalization ( see @xcite ) using of the mean - field approximation it needs to replace one of the multiplier @xmath98 in the second term of eq.([3.39 ] ) by the bare green function @xmath99 that corresponds to @xmath100 , @xmath101 and",

    "it means that without self - action effect , random heteropolymer is stable with respect to the microphase separation @xcite .",
    "the second equation ( [ 27 ] ) means that space period @xmath114 depends on renormalized thermodynamic parameter @xmath103 , as it is inherent in random copolymers @xcite .",
    "according to fig.1b with increasing of @xmath108 the value @xmath115 grows monotonously from @xmath116 to @xmath117 .",

    "the final form of the effective hamiltonian of random heteropolymer follows from the thermodynamic potential ( [ 3.39 ] ) renormalized under acting of the fluctuations    @xmath119    here the kernel @xmath120 is determined by eqs.([24 ] ) , where @xmath84 is replaced by @xmath121 .",

    "is removed by grassmann variable @xmath141 that is the formal reason of the replica and supersymmetry methods identity .",
    "the advantage of the latter method is in the grassmann conditions ( [ 34 ] ) that correspond to the limit @xmath87 in the replica method .",
    "according to consideration @xcite , the physical meaning of the components of the susy field ( [ 38 ] ) is as follow : @xmath142 is the most probable value of fluctuations of the field conjugated to the order parameter @xmath143 , and combination @xmath144 determines density of sharp interphases .",

    "the influence of the thermodynamic parameter @xmath221 on the microscopic memory parameter @xmath207 is depicted in fig.5 .",
    "the absence of memory below @xmath238 is the characteristic feature of the freezing region .",
    "non - zeroth value of @xmath207 appears in the freezing point @xmath238 and with further growth of the parameter @xmath221 , the memory parameter monotonously increases .",
    "the step - like behaviour of the parameter @xmath207 is inherent in the first order transition . evidently , the physical reason of the mentioned behaviour is the fluctuation contribution into the thermodynamic potential of the heteropolymer . according to fig.5a , with moving away from the composition @xmath228 ,",
    "the dependence @xmath244 becomes more slight . on the contrary ,",
    "the growing of the correlation length @xmath43 results in more abrupt growth of the memory parameter ( see fig.5b ) .",

    "the deflection from the composition @xmath228 , the decrease of the correlation length @xmath43 and the growth of the interreplica overlapping @xmath93 result in weakening of the non - ergodicity effects ( see fig.6 ) .    in the search for a new polymers with predetermined features",
    ", the phase diagram plays the basic role that defines possible thermodynamic states at different values of the flory parameter @xmath221 and composition @xmath0 . according to fig.7",
    ", such diagram has a concave form for both the freezing point @xmath246 and the point of ergodicity breaking @xmath247 .",
    "a region of the large @xmath221 adjacent to the composition @xmath228 corresponds to the non - ergodic unfreezing state . with decreasing of the values @xmath221 and @xmath248 ,",
    "at first the system goes to the ergodic state and then it freezes .",
    "the comparison of the fig.7a and fig.7b shows that the increasing of the correlation length @xmath43 results in expansion of the unfreezing and non - ergodic phases . on the contrary , from fig.7a and fig.7c",
    "one can see that interreplica overlapping leads to its contraction .",
