    "the past century witnessed the quantum leap of the semiconductor industries which gave birth to the computer science and information technology .",
    "we are now in an era in which information keeps being generated at a skyrocketing pace such that the net volume of information produced per day might be comparable to that accumulated after years one century ago . as an important participant ,",
    "magnetic data recording now has assumed the major task of information documentation , through video tapes , hard disks , etc . in order to cope with the exponentially growing information volume ,",
    "the need to develop data storage devices with higher capacity and faster read / write operation speed is demanded .",
    "this intrigue the development of spintronics - the pursuit to employ , in addition to the charge of electrons , their spin properties into applications .",
    "as one major branch , magnetic domain wall ( dw ) propagation along nanowires has attracted considerable attention in recent years due to its potential in achieving , for instance , high - intensity information storage , nonvolatile random access memory and dw logic circuit @xcite .    it has already been known for almost 40 years that the 1 + 1 ( spatial and time ) dimensional landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation @xcite , which universally governs magnetization dynamics , admits a well - known exact walker propagating dw solution for a biaxial nanowire .",
    "it predicts that , in the presence of an external magnetic field , the dw subjects to a rigid - body translational motion which is valid when the magnetic field is in a proper regime . despite its attractive simplicity and elegance , and",
    "the fact that this walker solution has played a pivotal role in our current understanding of both current - driven and field - driven dw propagation in magnetic nanowires @xcite , whether or not this solution is genuine , i.e. , describing a realistic physical system , is still an open question .",
    "as one necessary touchstone , genuine solution of a physical system must be stable against small perturbations . by now there is no proof of the stability of the walker solution and the validity of it for a 1d wire is always taken as self - evident .",
    "any deviation in experiments or numerical simulations are assumed to be attributed to the quasi-1d nature or other effects @xcite .",
    "however , there are signs @xcite that this solution may be unstable . for instance , in reference @xcite , it is shown that under a huge hard - axis anisotropy , a dw motion damped by spin - wave emission occurs after the field exceeds a critical value .",
    "in addition , only stern waves were observed therein . in reference",
    "@xcite , a propagating dw dressed with spin - waves was also captured both in the absence and presence of the gilbert damping , and unlike @xcite , the spin - waves observed emit both stern and bow waves .",
    "moreover , apparent deviation of dw velocity and deformation of dw profile from walker predicted values were also observed . unlike the microscopic dw profile which is sensitive to any errors incurred in simulations , the speed of dw manifests collective behavior of spins composing the dw ; thus it is capable of reflecting the macroscopic physics that are invulnerable to the self - averaging microscopic perturbations when a large number of spins are involved .",
    "therefore , this velocity deviation , as a more conspicuous fingerprint of the dws destabilization , shall also be addressed in regards to its origin in order for a deep understanding of dw propagation in nanowires . on the other hand ,",
    "applications of spintronics devices require accurate description of dw motion @xcite .",
    "thus , the stability of the walker propagating dw solution becomes vital in our understanding of dw propagation along a magnetic wire .     in a nanowire , with easy axis along @xmath0 and hard axis along @xmath1 . in the absence of external magnetic field ( upper ) ,",

    "it is shown that a propagating dw is always dressed with spin waves so that the walker solution is not stable against spin - wave emission . in the low field region ,",
    "only stern spin waves are emitted while both stern and bow waves emerge under high field .",
    "when the transverse magnetic anisotropy is larger than a critical value and the external field is sufficiently high , the solution is convective or absolute unstable , corresponding to severe distortion of the propagating dw profile .",
    "this shall lead to noticeable deviation of dw speed from the walker formula besides that the dw is dressed with spin waves .",

    "the model and theoretical formulation are explained in the next section .",

    "it can be classified into three categories .",
    "absolute instability [ ai , fig .",
    "[ fig2](c)iii ] occurs when at each fixed point on the @xmath6-axis , the disturbance grows exponentially with time .",
    "it is associated with the emergence of nontraveling unstable modes in the absolute frame ( the moving frame that we adopted ) ; thus coins its name .",
    "this point - wise growth feature of ai is in sharp contrast with the other two types of instability , which albeit grows in the total norm , decays locally at each fixed point on the @xmath6-axis .",
    "they happens when all unstable modes are transported to infinities at fast enough velocities .",
    "it is called a transient instability ( ti , fig . [ fig2](c)i ) if the disturbance generated locally in the dw region transports to infinity in one direction ( either towards @xmath187 or @xmath188 ) , while it is called convective ( ci , fig . [ fig2](c)ii ) if it can transport in both directions .",
    "intuitively , transient instability shall have the least influence on the dw property since once generated , it will leave the dw region quickly and will not interact with the dw hereafter .",
    "convective instability is stronger than the transient one since although transported outside the dw region , it could influence the dw through second order effect in which new bidirectional unstable modes excited by the convecting wave packets can collide and interact with the dw again .",
    "absolute instability is the most severe one in the sense that once a nontraveling disturbance is generated , it can stay within and keep interacting with the dw , leading to dramatic modification on the dw profile .",
    "for this reason , physical quantities depending on dw profile , such as the dw velocity , are expected to be strongly affected .",
    "the three types of transportation behavior , either unidirectional , bidirectional or non - travelling , are determined by the so - called absolute spectrum and the branching points @xcite . to introduce the absolute spectrum and the branching points",
    ", we recall that , for each @xmath71 in the complex plane , there are four @xmath189 ( @xmath190 ) for @xmath191 , ordered by their real parts as @xmath192 .",

    "the branching points are special points in the absolute spectrum , denoted as @xmath196 , satisfying @xmath197 .",
    "to have a better feeling about the absolute spectrum and differences in unidirectional / bidirectional transportation and nontraveling modes of a wave @xmath198 , we introduce the concept of pointwise decay and growth .",

    "mathematically , this corresponds to a proper choice of the origin of the @xmath71 plane in some sense .",

    "thus , by using the exponential weight of @xmath241 , it is equivalent to shift the eigenvalues of @xmath94 @xcite by @xmath242 and accordingly the indices of the @xmath71 are transformed as @xmath243 now suppose @xmath71 with @xmath202 belongs to the essential spectrum but not on the fredholm border , which means @xmath156 . for the llg equation and independent of the norm we use , @xmath71 in the right hand side of the rightmost fredholm border",
    "has the indices of @xmath244 , then all possible combinations of @xmath245 in the regions right after passing through the rightmost fredholm border can only be one of the four cases : @xmath246 , @xmath247 , @xmath248 , @xmath249 .",
    "consider for instance @xmath250 , then obviously @xmath251 and @xmath252 .",
    "if we also have @xmath253 , i.e. @xmath254 , we could always find the aforementioned proper weight as , for instance : @xmath255 which means that , for essential spectrum calculated under this norm , @xmath71 is well to the right of the essential spectrum .",
    "we can thus remove all unstable @xmath71 ( i.e. , @xmath202 ) in this way if there is no @xmath193 on the right half of the @xmath71 plane .",
    "however , if @xmath71 belongs to @xmath193 such that @xmath256 , it is easy to verify that no such pair of @xmath241 exist .",
    "this absolute spectrum is exactly the set of @xmath71 which could not be stabilized by the aforementioned proper weights @xmath241 .",
    "therefore we conclude that the absence of @xmath193 in the right half of the @xmath71 plane indicate transient instability in which all eigenmodes are unidirectional while the presence of the absolute spectrum means emergence of bidirectional eigenmodes .",
    "finally , the presence of unstable non - traveling modes is associated with the branching points s presence on the right half plane .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that the eigenmodes associated with these branching points have zero group velocity , as follows .",
    "denote the secular polynomial of @xmath101 as : @xmath257.$ ] then for @xmath196 satisfying @xmath258 , it must hold that : @xmath259 where @xmath260 .",
    "then the group velocity @xmath4 of modes associated with @xmath196 is @xmath261 thus , branching points @xmath196 are non - travelling eigenmode @xcite . for @xmath170 ,",
    "the absolute spectrum in the right half of the @xmath71 plane is generated by @xmath161 .",
    "[ fig3](a ) shows two branches @xmath262 .",
    "they are well separated by the real axis for @xmath218 and no absolute spectrum could be found in the right half plane .",
    "as the field increases , the two branches get closer with each other and at an onset field @xmath263 , depending on @xmath15 , two branches tangent at the real axis and then separate again in horizontal direction as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) for @xmath264 .",
    "at this moment , unstable absolute spectrum begins to emerge on the real axis ( enclosed by the dashed circle ) .",
    "[ fig3](c ) is the enlarged vision showing the absolute spectrum ( the segment between two branching points @xmath225 ( green solid dots ) ) .",
    "the dependence of @xmath265 or @xmath266 on @xmath267 between these two points is shown in fig . [ fig3](d ) .    according to refs .",
    "@xcite , wavepackets would be emitted if the essential spectrum encroaches the right half @xmath71-plane .",
    "there are three types of instability @xcite .",
    "the instability is called transient ( ti ) if the essential spectrum encroaches the right half plane and absolute spectrum are either in the left half plane or does not exist .",
    "the propagating dw emits stern waves shown in fig .",
    ". the instability is called convective if both essential and absolute spectrum encroaches the right half @xmath71-plane . in this case",
    ", the emitted waves can propagate in both direction as shown by fig .",
    "[ fig2](c)ii . for an convective instability ,",
    "if any branching point is also in the right half @xmath71-plane , the instability is called absolute .",
    "an absolute instability can then emit non - traveling ( zero group velocity ) waves as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2](c)iii . for llg equation , since the absolute spectrum is the segment connecting two branching points @xmath268 and @xmath269 [ fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( c ) , ( d ) ] , the absolute instability ( ai ) and convective instability ( ci ) co - exist .",
    "it is known that transient instability is very weak that can be removed under proper mathematical treatment @xcite .",
    "thus , we should not expect to have great physical consequences . on the other hand ,",
    "the absolute instability move with the dw , and cause the change of dw profile @xcite .",
    "it is known @xcite that field - induced dw propagating speed is proportional to the energy damping rate that is sensitive to dw profile . therefore absolute instability , which deform propagating dw profile , shall substantially alter dw speed .",
    "this may explain why the field - induced dw speed start to deviate from the walker result only when the field is large enough to emit both stern and bow waves in simulations @xcite .",
    "[ fig3](e ) is the calculated phase diagram in @xmath15 and @xmath227 plane .",
    "a transition from transient instability ( denoted as ti in the figure ) to absolute / convective instability ( ai / ci ) occur at a critical field @xmath263 as lng as @xmath270 at which @xmath230 .",
    "it means no absolute / convective instability exist for @xmath271 , and one shall not see noticeable change in famous walker propagation speed mentioned early .",
    "this may explain why many previous numerical simulations on permalloy , which have small transverse magnetic anisotropy , are consistent with walker formula .",
    "a snapshot of the convecting wavepackets could be identified in fig . 2 in reference @xcite where wavepackets can be seen in the vicinity of the traveling dw and travel to both directions .",
    "it should be noticed that the effects of point spectrum have not been analyzed . in principle",
    ", it can also affect the stability of the walker solution , and should be a very interesting subject too .",
    "unfortunately , there are not many theorems on the point spectrum yet .",
    "thus , one can only rely on a numerical method to find a point spectrum of operator @xmath72 and to find out whether it can also induce any instability on a propagating dw .",
    "in conclusion , we present a powerful recipe for analyzing the stability of a front of partial differential equation . for the walker propagating dw solution of the llf equation in 1 + 1 dimension , it is found that dw will always emit stern waves in a low field , and both stern and bow waves in a higher field .",
    "thus the exact walker solution of llg equation is not stable .",
    "the true propagating dw is always dressed with spin waves . in a real experiment .",
    "the emitted spin waves shall be damped away during their propagation , and make them hard to be detected in realistic wires . for a realistic wire with its transverse magnetic anisotropy larger than a critical value and when the applied external field is larger than certain value , a propagating dw may undergo simultaneous convective and absolute instabilities . as a consequence ,",
    "the propagating dw will not only emit both spin waves and spin wavepackets , but also change significantly its profile .",
    "thus , the corresponding walker dw propagating speed will deviate from its predicted value , agreeing very well with recent simulations .",
