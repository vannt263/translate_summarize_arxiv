    "in order to extend results on the `` first - step '' probability of intersection and apply the law of large numbers we would need the following assumptions :    * the positions of the two agents are uniformly distributed _ at every time step _ ( which is the case on the sphere but not on the plane because of reflection problems at the boundary of @xmath0 ) , * the crossing - path events are independent over time ( which is the case in neither setting because of the strong spatial dependence at consecutive time - steps ) .",
