    "in recent years , extensive efforts have been devoted to the control of complex dynamical networks .",
    "one major issue is that real world networks usually consist of a very large number of nodes and links which makes it impossible to apply control actions to all nodes .",
    "pinning control is a new way to address this problem by placing local feedback injections on a small fraction of the nodes .",
    "controllability of such systems has been addressed in @xcite , where it was reformulated as a global asymptotic stability problem .",
    "the goal of this short note is to refine the analysis proposed in @xcite using recent results in singular value perturbation theory .",
    "one considers a set of @xmath0 @xmath1-dimensional oscillators governed by a system of nonlinear differential equations .",
    "moreover , we assume that each oscillator is coupled with a restricted set of other oscillators .",
    "this coupling relationship can be efficiently described using a graph where the vertices are indexed by the oscillators and there is an edge between two oscillators if they are coupled .",

    "our goal is to control the system using a limited number of nodes .",
    "the selected nodes are called the `` pinned nodes '' . for this purpose",

    "let @xmath15 denote the diagonal matrix with diagonal @xmath16 .      in @xcite ,",
    "the authors propose a definition for ( global pinning- ) controllability ( based on lyapunov stability criteria ) :    we say that the system ( [ syst ] ) is controllable if the error dynamical system @xmath17 is lyapunov stable around the origin , i.e. there exists a positive definite function @xmath18 such that @xmath19 when @xmath20 .    the following result , ( * ? ?",

    ".    many systems of interest satisfy the constraint specified by ( [ fxi ] ) ; see @xcite .",
    "this proposition is very useful for node selection via the matrix @xmath15 .",
    "indeed , assume that @xmath26 is selected , then one may try to maximise @xmath27 as a function of @xmath15 , under the constraint that no more than @xmath28 nodes can be pinned .",
    "this is a combinatorial problem that can be relaxed using semi - definite programming or various heuristics @xcite .",
    "our goal in the present note is to propose an easy controllability condition refining ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 7 ) , based on the algebraic connectivity of the graph , the number of pinned nodes , the coupling strengh and the feedback gain .",
