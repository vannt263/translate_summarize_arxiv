    "in previous papers some cases of non - rotating n - body models of elliptical galaxies have been investigated as regards their mass components in ordered and in chaotic motion ( voglis , kalapotharakos & stavropoulos 2002 ; kalapotharakos , voglis & contopoulos 2004 ; kalapotharakos & voglis 2005 ) . in these studies",
    "the fraction of mass in chaotic motion and its consequences were found to be important .    in particular , in voglis et al .",
    "( 2002 ) two non - rotating triaxial equilibrium models , called c and q , resulting respectively from clumpy ( c ) and quiet ( q ) cosmological initial conditions after dissipationless collapse and relaxation , are examined .",
    "both models have smooth centers , i.e. the density near the center flattens inside a radius of about 10% of the half mass radius .",
    "the c model is more close to spherical than the q model having a maximum ellipticity e4 .",
    "the mass in chaotic motion in c is found to be about @xmath6 of the total mass .",
    "the lyapunov numbers of the orbits are found in general small , so that only @xmath7 of the total mass is able to develop chaotic diffusion in a hubble time .",
    "the q model has a high maximum ellipticity e7 .",
    "the fraction of mass in chaotic motion in q is found to be about @xmath8 of the total mass and the values of the lyapunov numbers are found higher than in c , so that a fraction of mass about @xmath9 is able to develop chaotic diffusion in a hubble time",
    ".    we have also found that the spatial distribution of the mass in chaotic motion is different than the spatial distribution of the mass in ordered motion , so that this difference can form an observable hump in the profile of the surface density .",
    "the fact that chaos in models of non - rotating galaxies with smooth centers is not negligible was also found in muzzio , carpintero & wachlin ( 2005 ) .",
    "these authors found a fraction of mass in chaotic motion of about @xmath10 in their non - rotating smooth center model , i.e. even larger than the fraction found in our models .",
    "one reason that explains this difference is the fact that their model is more cuspy , i.e. the density near the center flattens in a smaller radius than in our models .",
    "another reason is that they have used a lower threshold of the lyapunov numbers for distinguishing between regular and chaotic orbits .",
    "the two results are in agreement , in the sense that the fraction of mass in chaotic motion can not be negligible ( it is of the order of some tens percent ) even in models with smooth centers that are expected to be mostly in favor of ordered motion .",
    "another agreement with our results is that the mass in chaotic motion has a different spatial distribution than the mass in regular motion .",
    "however , the lyapunov times of the vast majority of chaotic orbits are large compared with the mean dynamical times of galaxies ( e.g. more than 10 dynamical times ) .    models of non - rotating galaxies are the simplest possible models of galaxies , especially those with smooth centers .",
    "rotation of galaxies introduces new parameters and nonlinear interactions that lead to more complicated dynamics . in rotating models",
    "density waves , able to form rotating bars or spiral arms , can grow .",
    "the mechanism that is responsible for the formation and the stability of spiral arms in galaxies is a complicated problem that has not been very well understood yet .",
    "all researchers agree that the main driving force leading to this effect is gravity .",
    "dissipative effects can also play a non - negligible role in the stability of the spiral arms , but gravity remains the main driving mechanism .",
    "the frequent appearance of spiral arms in galaxies is in favor of the assumption that this is probably a quasi - stationary effect , i.e. spiral arms are long living features in galaxies .",
    "this assumption is known as the lin - shu hypothesis ( lin & shu 1964,1966 ; binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "the dynamical evolution of galaxies can be studied by combining theoretical analysis with the results obtained by n - body simulations .",
    "n - body simulations show that spiral arms appear as a transient effect , in the sense that they grow as density waves , but they are temporarily dissolved or fade and recreated again .",
    "this process may be repeated several times until they finally disappear .",
    "a necessary ingredient for spiral structure to appear is the amount of angular momentum a galaxy possesses , as well as the way this angular momentum is distributed along the mass of the galaxy .",
    "it is well known that resonances between the frequencies of stellar orbits and the angular velocity of the pattern @xmath11 play a significant role on the stability and the dynamical evolution of rotating discs . in particular",
    "the inner lindblad resonance ( ilr ) , corotation ( cr ) and the outer lindblad resonance ( olr ) are the most important resonances .",
    "lynden - bell & kalnajs ( 1972 ) have shown that in a rotating disc angular momentum is transferred outwards .",
    "this transference is due to the interaction of a bar - like perturbation of the gravitational field with stars moving in resonant orbits particularly near ilr and cr .",
    "tremaine & weinberg ( 1984 ) and weinberg ( 1985 ) , extended this analysis showing that angular momentum transference can be interpreted as an effect caused by a particular type of dynamical friction .",
    "n - body simulations indicate that angular momentum transference outwards is always present in rotating galactic models .",
    "this effect takes place not only between the bar and the disc , but it is extended to the halo particles ( e.g. debattista & sellwood 1998 , 2000 ; athanassoula 2002 , 2003 ) .    in particular , it has been found that the material in the bar and in the inner disc emits angular momentum to resonant material in the outer disc , or in the halo and in the bulge .",
    "the evolution of bars in isolated disc galaxies is driven by the redistribution of angular momentum .",
    "transference of angular momentum outwards in rotating galaxies produces secular dynamical evolution in which the bar grows and slows down .",
    "several questions arise regarding the role of regular motion and the role of chaotic motion in rotating galaxies and their evolution , examples are as follows .",
    "\\i ) what is the effect of rotation on the degree of chaos in such systems , in comparison to the degree of chaos in non - rotating systems ?",
    "\\ii ) what is the typical level of the lyapunov characteristic numbers and what is the amount of mass that can develop efficient chaotic diffusion in a hubble time ?",
    "\\iii ) what is the role of chaos on the secular evolution and how secular evolution affects chaos ?",
    "\\iv ) how the two components of mass in chaotic or in regular motion are distributed in space ?",
    "v)how the pattern is affected by chaos ? can such systems develop spiral arms ?",
    "for how long ?    in order to investigate these questions , we use one of the non - rotating n - body models mentioned above , namely the q - model , and we construct from it a series of iso - energetic rotating models .",
    "iso - energetic means that they have the same total mass @xmath12 , the same total binding energy @xmath13 and they are close to the same scalar virial equilibrium , but they carry different total amounts of angular momentum . in this way",
    ", a direct comparison can be made as regards the effect of their angular momentum on the behavior of the models .",
    "the total amount of angular momentum in these models is large , so that their values of the spin parameter @xmath0 are comparable to the value of @xmath0 of our galaxy .",
    "in this investigation we use the same code and the same number of particles as in voglis et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , i.e. an improved version of the conservative technique code by allen palmer & papaloizou ( 1990 ) with @xmath14 particles .",
    "we use as a scaling unit of length the half mass radius @xmath15 in every model .",
    "the half mass crossing time @xmath16 is defined as the unit of time .",
    "an important time scale is the radial period @xmath17 of an orbit with binding energy @xmath18 equal to the mean value of the potential at the half mass radius .",
    "if we assume that in a typical galaxy a star with binding energy @xmath18 describes about 50 circular periods @xmath19 in a hubble time , then it describes about 100 radial periods in this time ( since the 2:1 resonance at this energy is typical ) .",
    "therefore , a hubble time is @xmath20 .    in section 2",
    "the method of derivation of the initial conditions of our models is described . in section 3 various features of the models along their self - consistent run",
    "are examined , regarding their morphology , the radial profiles of the surface density , the rotation curves , the evolution of the pattern speed and the corotation radius , the longevity of the spiral structure and the secular evolution of the systems . in section 4 the components of mass in regular and in chaotic motion for every model are estimated by the method introduced in voglis et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . in section 5 the spatial distribution of these two components is demonstrated .",
    "our conclusions are summarized and a discussion is given in section 6 .",
    "the q model is a non - rotating triaxial equilibrium configuration .",
    "the three components of the total angular momentum , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 along the principal axes of the system are very close to zero .",
    "the ratio of the direct to the retrograde orbits with respect to any axis is very close to @xmath24 .",
    "as described below , rotation is inserted by re - orienting the velocities of particles , so that all the orbits rotate initially around the same axis and along the same direction .",
    "( of course , one can create models by only a partial initial re - orientation of the velocities ) .",
    "this is a kind of  conspiracy \" between orbits , introduced artificially , that increases the total amount of angular momentum in the system , but preserves the kinetic energy .",
    "a measure of the angular momentum @xmath25 , for a gravitational system of total mass @xmath12 and total binding energy @xmath13 , can be given in terms of the spin parameter @xmath0 introduced by peebles ( 1969 ) .",
    "this parameter is defined by the equation @xmath26 notice that the value of @xmath0 of the disc of our galaxy is @xmath27 , as has been evaluated by efstathiou & jones ( 1979 ) from the value of the angular momentum of our galaxy given by innanen ( 1966 ) .",
    "the conspiracy of the directions of rotation of the orbits mentioned above is important for the formation of fast rotating patterns and gives to the spin parameter @xmath0 values comparable to the value of our galaxy .",
    "it should be stressed here that in a system with random directions of rotation of the orbits the total angular momentum of the system is very small , or zero . even if the orbits rotate around the same axis , but those in direct rotation are comparable and mixed with the orbits in retrograde rotation , the total angular momentum of the system is again small , or zero .",
    "pattern rotation in such models is negligible , or zero .",
    "if galaxies are formed from small initial density perturbations in a hierarchical clustering cosmological scenario and they have acquired their angular momentum from tidal interactions with other density perturbations of their environment in the early universe , a conspiracy between the directions of rotation of the orbits can not be obtained in a dissipationless scenario either in monolithic collapses , or in mergers between sub - clumps formed hierarchically .",
    "tidal interactions between density perturbations can only give structures with a mean value of the spin parameter of about @xmath28 ( e.g. efstathiou & jones 1979 ; barnes & efstathiou 1987 ; zurek , quinn & salmon 1988 ; voglis & hiotelis 1989 ; voglis , hiotelis & hflich 1991 ) .",
    "the main reason for such a small value of @xmath0 is the mixing between direct and retrograde orbits .",
    "various estimations show that in a galaxy formation process a value of @xmath0 near 0.2 can be achieved , if the collapse factors are remarkably larger than the value of 2 , that results from the virial theorem , when it is applied to a dissipationless collapse process .",
    "such a large value of the collapse factor can be obtained by dissipative processes .",
    "furthermore , dissipative processes absorb the retrograde motion ( by collisions between gas clouds ) and lead to systems where direct motion dominates .",
    "therefore , according to this scenario , only the dissipative mass , i.e. the baryonic component , of a galaxy can be characterized by large values of @xmath0 .",
    "this component is mostly related to the disc of galaxies . in principle",
    ", a dark matter halo should be characterized by small values of @xmath0 , compatible with those produced by cosmological tidal fields , as mentioned above .    in the present paper",
    "we compare iso - energetic fast rotating models of various angular momenta with a non - rotating model , in order to reveal the consequence of rotation as regards the level of chaos .",
    "for this reason , in this paper , we use a simple model where no halo component with low values of @xmath0 is considered . as we will see in the next section in our rotating systems a bar and a thin disc embedded in a thick disc",
    "are formed .",
    "an extension of this work combining a discy component of large @xmath0 with a halo component of small @xmath0 will be presented elsewhere .    in order to create initial conditions for an iso - energetic rotating model based on the q model , we apply the following velocity re - orientation process :    at a given snapshot , at @xmath29 , of the self - consistent evolution of the q model , the component @xmath30 ( parallel to the plane of intermediate - longest axes ) of the velocity of every particle is re - oriented , so that it becomes perpendicular to the current radius @xmath31 of the particle on this plane , pointing along the same ( clockwise ) direction .",
    "this velocity re - orientation process does not affects the total kinetic energy @xmath32 and respects the scalar viral equation of the system @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the rotational and the radial kinetic energies parallel to the @xmath36 plane .",
    "@xmath37 is the kinetic energy along the ( shortest ) @xmath38 axis .",
    "the initial conditions created in this way form a rotating new model called qr1 . at the time @xmath39 ,",
    "when the running of this model starts , the radial components of the velocities parallel to the y - z plane are zero .",
    "all the kinetic energy parallel to this plane is rotational kinetic energy around the shortest axis ( x ) , of the same direction . as a consequence ,",
    "the total angular momentum of the system is equal to a non - zero component @xmath40 . during the ( self - consistent ) evolution of this model",
    ", radial motion grows rapidly , but the total angular momentum @xmath21 of the system remains constant .    in order to create initial conditions for the next model , qr2 , we choose a snapshot of the self - consistent run of the qr1 model at @xmath41 .",
    "this period of time is long enough for some very fast transient effects of the qr1 model , due to the redistribution of the types of orbits , to decay . during this period considerable amount of radial motion",
    "has been grown .",
    "the initial conditions of the new model qr2 are created by applying again the velocity re - orientation process at this snapshot of the qr1 model .",
    "the time is reset to @xmath42 , when the running of qr2 starts . the total angular momentum @xmath21 becomes larger in qr2 than in qr1 .",
    "initial conditions of the model qr3 are created in a similar way by using a snapshot of the self - consistent run of the qr2 model at @xmath43 on which the same velocity re - orientation process is applied .",
    "the time of qr3 is reset to @xmath44 , when its running starts .",
    "angular momentum @xmath21 is larger in qr3 than in qr2 .",
    "the initial conditions of the model qr4 , with angular momentum @xmath21 larger that in qr3 , are created from the model qr3 in a similar way .",
    "again the time is reset to @xmath45 , at the start of its running .",
    "the values of @xmath0 of the above systems corresponding to the mass inside a cylinder with radius @xmath46 on the equatorial plane , for the four models respectively , are @xmath47 .",
    "thus , we have a sequence of five iso - energetic models , q , qr1 , qr2 , qr3 , qr4 , with different amounts of their angular momentum @xmath21 .    before the final runs a number of testing runs",
    "were performed with various time steps @xmath48 at which the self - consistent potential is re - evaluated . in all the runs a pronounced rotating bar is formed by density waves , as it is described in the next section .",
    "we found that the rotation of the bar is sensitive in the choice of @xmath48 .",
    "namely , if @xmath48 is not small enough the bar suffers from a systematic numerical deceleration . in particular as the orbits are integrated during @xmath48 in a constant potential they form a new bar at a small phase @xmath49 ahead with respect to the bar of the potential .",
    "this lack of self - consistency for the time @xmath48 introduces a numerical retarding torque that causes an unrealistic slowing down of the bar .",
    "the cumulative effect of this torque for a hubble time can be serious , unless @xmath48 is small enough .",
    "we found that @xmath50 is a good choice in order to minimize the hysteresis between the bar of the potential and the bar of the real density of particles during @xmath48 , so that the cumulative effect in a hubble time remains small .",
    "every model is run self - consistently for a hubble time , i.e. a time @xmath51 in our time units . during this run",
    "the coefficients of the self - consistent potential are re - evaluated at every @xmath50 .",
    "the cumulative variation of the total energy during the whole run is less than @xmath52 . in the rotating models a number of particles about @xmath53 acquire positive energies and escape the system .",
    "the center of mass , being initially at @xmath54 is translated by a distance less than 0.03 .",
    "during the self - consistent evolution , in the rotating models , density waves grow to form a strong bar surrounded by an inner disc , an outer disc and a thick disc .",
    "( the density of the disc decreases with increasing @xmath55 , so that a thin disc can be defined near the equatorial plane y - z ) .",
    "the bar is triaxial and rotates around its shortest axis x.    in the first row of fig .",
    "1 the edge - on projections ( y - x plane ) of the four models ( qr1 , qr2 , qr3 , qr4 ) are shown , respectively , at their snapshots at time @xmath56 of their run time .",
    "( more precisely , @xmath57 is @xmath58 for the four models , respectively .",
    "hereafter , these times are referred simply as @xmath59 ) .    in the second row of fig .",
    "1 the face - on projections ( on the equatorial plane , y - z ) of these models are shown at the same snapshots as in the first row . in these figures",
    "we can see that the size of the bar decreases with increasing angular momentum along the sequence of the models .",
    "we can also see that density waves form two symmetric spiral arms emanating from the ends of the bar , that become more prominent along the sequence qr1 , qr2 , qr3 , qr4 .",
    "the third and the forth row in fig .",
    "1 are similar to the first two rows , respectively , but at a time of about @xmath60 later . during this long interval of time ( @xmath61 )",
    "the bar has described a total number of about 9 , 11 , 13 , 15 rotations , respectively in the four models .",
    "we see that in qr4 spiral arms are still well discernible at this time . in qr2 and qr3",
    "they are fainter . in qr1",
    "they can not be seen in this projection .",
    "furthermore , we see that the distribution of mass in qr2 , qr3 , qr4 has been expanded along the equatorial plane by a factor that is more prominent in the qr4 model .      in the five frames of the left column of fig .",
    "2 the radial profiles of the mean surface density @xmath62 at a radius @xmath63 on the equatorial plane of all the models ( q , qr1 , qr2 , qr3 , qr4 ) are shown as functions of the radius @xmath63 , in @xmath63-@xmath64 scale .    as the rotation increases along the sequence of the models , the radial surface density profiles at small radii ( @xmath65 )",
    "become steeper . in the rotating models",
    "the slope in the outer parts remains remarkably constant along the radius , indicating an exponential radial profile of the surface density .",
    "the time variations of these profiles during a hubble time are small .",
    "for example , in the frames for the models qr1,qr2,qr3,qr4 , in fig .",
    "2 the surface density radial profiles are drawn at @xmath66 ( solid line ) and at @xmath67 ( dashed line ) . there is a tendency of these profiles to become flatter in time .",
    "this tendency increases along the sequence of the models and it is due to a slow expansion of the mass at large radii combined with a slow contraction at smaller radii .",
    "the exponential radial profiles of the surface density in the rotating models can also be seen in the five frames of the right column of fig . 2 where the corresponding slopes @xmath68 are shown as functions of @xmath63 at an intermediate snapshot of @xmath69 .",
    "we see that the value of the slope @xmath70 in the non - rotating q model decreases almost constantly up to large radii .",
    "however , in the rotating models qr1 , qr2 , qr3 , qr4 the values of @xmath70 show a maximum at a small radius ( @xmath71 ) , but beyond this radius , @xmath70 flattens and remains remarkably constant up to large radii , expressing the exponential character of the profile .",
    "such radial profiles of the surface density are similar to the observed profiles of the discs ( see , for example , grosbol & patsis 1998 , figs.1a - c therein ) .",
    "it is interesting to examine the time evolution of the rotational velocity curves and the distribution of the angular momentum for each model .    in order to find the rotation curve at a given snapshot of such a system",
    "we define 50 successive cylindrical co - axial rings around the rotation axis ( x ) , so that the mass inside every ring is the same for all the rings .",
    "the rotational velocity @xmath72 at the mean radius @xmath73 of the ring @xmath74 is evaluated from the equation @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the mean angular momentum per particle along the x axis of the @xmath77 particles in the ring @xmath74 .    in the left column of fig .",
    "3 the rotational velocity curves of the four models are shown . in these figures",
    "the velocity @xmath78 is measured in units of @xmath79 .",
    "the conversion factor in real units is @xmath80 the value of @xmath15 in @xmath81 depends on the cosmological model , on the total mass of the system and on the value of the redshift @xmath82 at the epoch of virialization of the galaxy .",
    "it is given by @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the total density parameter of the universe , @xmath85 is the hubble constant in units of @xmath86 , @xmath12 is the mass of the galaxy and @xmath87 . for @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 and a redshift of formation @xmath91",
    "we get @xmath92 which is a typical value for @xmath15 .",
    "the solid lines in fig . 3 give the rotational velocity curves @xmath93 evaluated from ( 4 ) at different times , namely @xmath94 , as indicated by the numbers next to the curves .    for comparison , dashed lines in these figures",
    "give the  dynamical \" rotational velocity @xmath95 curves as evaluated at @xmath56 and at @xmath96 from the centrifugal equilibrium under the forces @xmath97 due to the monopole terms of the potential . at the end of a hubble time",
    "the values of @xmath98 become slightly larger near the center , while they become slightly smaller at large radii , indicating a slow redistribution of the mass during this time .",
    "however , this variability of @xmath98 is small compared to the evolution of the rotational velocity curves @xmath93 in all the models . in the inner parts ( e.g. for @xmath65 ) the rotational velocity @xmath93 becomes gradually smaller",
    "this occurs at a decreasing rate and it is a result due to the transference of angular momentum outwards .    the transference of angular momentum outwards can be seen in the right column of fig .",
    "3 , where the cumulative angular momentum is plotted as a function of the cumulative mass from the center at the same snapshots as the rotation curves in the left column of fig .",
    "we see that at later times more mass is required in order to collect the same amount of angular momentum .",
    "it is remarkable that the transference of angular momentum outwards depends also on the model .",
    "for example , in qr1 the distribution of angular momentum at @xmath99 is close to the distribution at @xmath100 , while in qr2 , qr3 and qr4 the distribution of angular momentum at @xmath99 is close to the distribution at @xmath101 .",
    "a direct consequence of the angular momentum transference is that the bar grows and its rotation slows down .",
    "we examine the deceleration of the bar , i.e. the evolution of its pattern speed and the corresponding corotation radius .",
    "we find first , numerically , the function of time @xmath102 , that gives the angle @xmath103 of the orientation of the longest axis of the inertia ellipsoid of the mass inside a radius @xmath63 ( containing the bar ) , with respect to the initial orientation of this axis .",

    "the corotation radius at a particular snapshot can be estimated by locating the unstable lagrangian point @xmath106 from the autonomous hamiltonian ( jacobi integral ) @xmath107 where @xmath108 are the polar coordinates on the equatorial plane ( yz ) and @xmath109 is the value of the pattern speed of the bar at this snapshot . in this expression",
    "the term @xmath110 is the monopole component of the self - consistent potential at this snapshot .    in fig .",
    "4 the time evolution of @xmath111 ( fig .",
    "4a ) and of the corresponding corotation radius @xmath112 ( the radius of the unstable lagrangian point @xmath106 , fig .",

    "does not vary considerably preserving a value about @xmath113 ( in units of @xmath114 ) .",
    "the corotation radius also remains roughly constant at about 2.3 .    in qr2 ,",
    "qr3 , qr4 @xmath111 starts from larger values about 0.75 , 0.90 , and 1.0 , respectively , and decreases initially faster , but more slowly later on .",
    "the corotation radii start from the values about 1.3 , 1.2 , 1.0 and increase by about @xmath5 at the end of the hubble time .",
    "gadotti & de souza ( 2005 , 2006 ) investigated the kinematics , the lengths , and the colors and ages in a good number of face - on bars in real galaxies .",
    "they classified the bars in these galaxies in old and young bars .",
    "one of their main results is that bars can survive for a hubble time .",
    "furthermore , the mean linear size of the young bars is @xmath115 , while the mean linear size of the old bars is @xmath116 , i.e. old bars are by about @xmath117 longer than the young bars .",

    "as regards the dependence of the azimuthal phase @xmath125 on the radius @xmath63 along the spiral arms this is very close to linear , on the average .",

    "9b ( @xmath141 ) the maximum value of @xmath140 in the bar is only slightly reduced . in the region of spiral arms",
    ", however , it falls to the level of about 0.1 or 0.2 .",

    "we see that @xmath145 oscillates up and down , but on the average it decays with time , tending to a minimum value somehow smaller than 0.2 at @xmath100 .",
    "it is remarkable that the mean values of @xmath145 at early times ( e.g. at @xmath147 ) , as well as the time intervals when @xmath145 maintains values greater than a certain value , e.g. @xmath148 , increase along the sequence of the models .",

    "an example of the evolution between two successive peaks is described below in fig .",

    "it requires a much thorough investigation , but here , we will give a short qualitative description of what seems to happen , based only on the observation of a number of successive snapshots . in order to see this effect in more details",
    ", we select a series of 12 successive snapshots ( at every @xmath149 ) in the time interval between @xmath150 and @xmath151 of the evolution of the qr4 model during the 18th-19th rotation of the bar .",
    "this interval of time is marked by a box with dotted lines in fig .",
    "10d . during this interval",
    "the quantity @xmath145 describes about 1.5 oscillations , i.e. minimum - maximum - minimum - maximum .    in fig .",
    "11 the distributions of @xmath152 and @xmath135 are shown ( in pairs as in fig .",
    "5 ) for the 12 successive snapshots ( @xmath153 ) . observing carefully these distributions we can describe the following mechanism :    spiral pattern is due to a wave fluctuation mode of @xmath4 on the surface density , that is excited by the bar .",
    "this wave travels outwards and rotates more slowly than the bar .",
    "the bar goes out of phase with respect to a previously excited part of the mode .",
    "two parts of this mode , excited at a small difference of time are not always in phase . in this case the continuation of the spiral shape of the wave can be interrupted .",
    "the quantity @xmath145 has a minimum .",
    "the two parts of this mode come in phase quasi - periodically producing a global spiral wave with maximum amplitude @xmath145 and smoothly joined azimuthal phases .",
    "they come out of phase again and the global spiral structure is temporarily deformed , or interrupted and so on .",
    "it is possible in this case that , temporarily , quarter - turn spirals ( qts ) appear as , for example , in the snapshot at @xmath154 ( fig .",
    "notice that qts are observed e.g. in ngc 3631 and ngc 1365 , ( fridman , khoruzhii & polyachenko 2002 ; polyachenko & polyachenko 2002 ; polyachenko , 2002a , 2002b ) .",
    "it is also possible that spiral arms can be so confused , due to an irregular dependence of @xmath125 on @xmath63 that can hardly be discernible , but the dependence of @xmath125 on @xmath63 becomes smooth again and continuous spiral arms are re - created again in about half the period of the bar , or in any case in less than a period of rotation of the bar .",
    "this process is repeated all during the hubble time in our experiments , when the bar describes a good number of rotations ranging from 19 rotations in qr1 to 33 rotations in qr4 , although the relative power of the @xmath4 mode with respect to higher modes decreases by a factor of about 2 or 3 .      in general the fraction of mass in chaotic motion ,",
    "the spatial distribution of this mass , the mean level of the lyapunov numbers and their distribution among the chaotic orbits are important parameters related to the morphology and the secular evolution of galaxies .    if chaotic orbits have so small lyapunov numbers that the rate of their chaotic diffusion in a hubble time can not be efficient , or if chaotic orbits are only a small fraction of the total mass , or if they are uniformly distributed inside the equipotential surface of their energy , they can not drive any secular evolution in a galaxy .",
    "secular evolution can be driven within a hubble time by chaotic orbits provided that :    \\i ) lyapunov times of chaotic orbits do not exceed the hubble time    \\ii ) the mass in chaotic orbits with such lyapunov times is a good fraction of the total mass and    iii)these chaotic orbits occupy a limited part of their available phase space .",
    "a better understanding of the various features of our models can be obtained , if we make a distinction between regular and chaotic orbits .",
    "the method of the distinction and the results obtained are discussed in the next section .",
    "we use the method introduced in voglis et al .",
    "( 2002 ) to find the fraction of mass in chaotic motion at various snapshots of our models and compare the results .    as a measure of the chaotic character of an orbit one can use the mean logarithmic divergence between neighboring orbits in a finite time , called finite time lyapunov characteristic number ( @xmath155 ) defined by @xmath156 where @xmath157 is the length at time @xmath104 of the deviation vector from an orbit under study and @xmath158 is its initial value .",
    "the deviation vector @xmath159 is defined in the 6-dimensional phase space @xmath160 from the differentials of the position and momentum variables @xmath161 .",
    "it is evaluated from the variational equations , derived by differentiating the equations of motion .",
    "the coefficients of the variational equations are evaluated from the solutions of the canonical equations of motion resulting from the hamiltonian ( 9 ) , when this hamiltonian is applied to a particular snapshot of the self - consistent run of our systems .",
    "as it is well known ( see e.g. contopoulos 2004 , for a review ) the maximal lyapunov characteristic number @xmath162 of an orbit is the limit of @xmath155 as @xmath104 tends to infinity .",
    "if @xmath162 is zero the orbit is regular ( called also ordered ) , while if @xmath162 acquires a positive constant value the orbit is chaotic and the constant value of the @xmath162 is a measure of the chaotic character of the orbit .",
    "since in practice the orbit can be integrated only for a finite time @xmath163 , @xmath162 can only be approximated by the values of @xmath155 .",
    "however , the values of @xmath155 never become exactly zero .",
    "in regular orbits the values of @xmath155 tend to zero on the average as @xmath164 ( with an average slope @xmath165 ) .",
    "in chaotic orbits , for a transient period @xmath166 , the values of @xmath155 again decrease on the average following the same law ( @xmath164 ) , but later on they tend to be stabilized at a constant value @xmath167 .",
    "this value can be considered as an estimate of the @xmath162 of the orbit .",
    "if @xmath166 is known , a first estimate of @xmath167 is @xmath168 .",
    "thus the detectable values of @xmath169 of a chaotic orbit are limited by the inequality @xmath170 . in order to obtain a distinction between chaotic and regular orbits in terms of @xmath167",
    ", it is necessary to define a threshold value of @xmath171 .",
    "all the orbits for which @xmath155 has already been stabilized at a value @xmath172 , at @xmath173 , can be characterized as chaotic .",
    "the maximum lyapunov time of these orbits is @xmath174 . for insuring that all the orbits , that practically behave as chaotic , have been detected",
    ", @xmath175 should be remarkably larger than a hubble time .    on the other hand , the orbits for which @xmath155 at @xmath173 still decreases on the average as @xmath164 could be either regular ( with @xmath176 ) , or chaotic but with @xmath177 .",
    "all these orbits can conventionally be characterized as regular orbits .",
    "a difficulty arising in applying this method in galaxies is the fact that in galaxies there are orbits evolving in very different characteristic time scales .",
    "the radial period @xmath178 ( i.e. the time for a orbit to go from its apocenter to pericenter and back to apocenter ) of the orbit @xmath179 depends on the binding energy @xmath180 of this orbit according to the relation @xmath181 , almost independently of the angular momentum of the orbit .",
    "this relation is exact in a keplerian field , as well as in the isochrone potential model . in gravitational n - body simulations",
    ", the same relation still holds with a remarkable accuracy ( voglis , 1994 ) .    in galaxies the binding energies of individual orbits , and therefore the corresponding radial periods , spread to more than four orders of magnitude . the departure from integrability of an orbit",
    "depends on the variability per dynamical time of the actions associated with the orbit .",
    "if in an orbit a certain variation of actions takes place in 1 dynamical time and in another orbit the same variation takes place in 10 dynamical times , the departure from integrability is larger in the former case .    therefore , a fair estimate of the departure of orbits from integrability can be obtained by integrating the orbits for the same number @xmath182 of radial periods than for the same time @xmath163 .    for this reason we use the specific finite time lyapunov characteristic number ( @xmath183 ) denoted by @xmath184 for every orbit @xmath179 .",
    "the term ` specific ' is used to declare that @xmath184 is evaluated in units of the inverse radial period @xmath185 of the particular orbit .",
    "this makes the values of @xmath184 almost invariant in the characteristic time scale of the orbit .",
    "a particular threshold value of @xmath186 is a better index for distinction between regular and chaotic orbits .",
    "a disadvantage of the index @xmath184 is that the lyapunov times measured by @xmath187 ( in fixed time units ) are different for orbits with the same @xmath184 , but different energies .",
    "the chaotic diffusion of an orbit is important for times greater than its lyapunov time @xmath188 . among the chaotic orbits , only those with @xmath189 are able to develop effective chaotic diffusion in a hubble time .    in order to estimate the ability of orbits for an effective chaotic diffusion in a hubble time we use , instead of the index @xmath184 , the index @xmath190 which is the value of @xmath155 measured in a common unit @xmath191 for all the orbits , where @xmath17 is the radial period of an orbit with binding energy @xmath18 .",
    "a hubble time is @xmath192 , as described in the introduction .",
    "the lyapunov times of the orbits in common units of @xmath17 are @xmath193 . therefore",
    ", chaotic diffusion of an orbit @xmath179 becomes important in a hubble time , if @xmath194 , or if @xmath195 .",
    "an alternative index that can be combined with the index @xmath184 for the distinction between regular and chaotic orbits is the so called alignment index ( @xmath196 ) defined as @xmath197 where @xmath198 and @xmath199 are two different deviation vectors of the same orbit .",
    "this index is a direct measure of the angle between the two deviation vectors .",
    "the behavior of the deviation vectors in four - dimensional symplectic maps or in three - dimensional hamiltonian systems has been examined in voglis , contopoulos & efthymiopoulos ( 1998,1999 ) and voglis et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . in the case of ordered motion , two initially arbitrary deviation vectors , after a transient period of time , become tangent to the surface of the corresponding torus . on the surface of the torus they oscillate around each other .",
    "thus , the angle between the two vectors ( and hence the alignment index @xmath196 ) shows no systematic variation , but remains always around a finite mean value .",
    "on the contrary , if the orbit is chaotic , the directions of the two deviation vectors tend exponentially to coincide to each other along the same direction ( parallel or antiparallel ) , which is the direction of the nearby passing most unstable manifold .",
    "thus , the index @xmath196 tends exponentially to zero .    in voglis",
    "et al . ( 2002 ) the alignment index @xmath196 was defined as the smaller between the sum or the difference of the two deviation vectors ( normalized to unity at every time step ) , depending on whether they are antiparallel or parallel , respectively . this index is often called sali ( smaller alignment index , skokos 2001 ) .",
    "but by the definition given in ( 17 ) the distinction between parallel or antiparallel deviation vector is avoided .",
    "the adopted maximum number of radial periods of the run time @xmath200 of the orbit @xmath179 is @xmath201 for all the orbits .",
    "the corresponding threshold value of @xmath184 is @xmath202 . by evaluating simultaneously the two indices (",
    "@xmath203 and @xmath184 ) along the orbits of the system we can obtain a reliable distinction between ordered and chaotic orbits in our models at a particular snapshot of their self - consistent run .",
    "it should be stressed that by this distinction we only check whether the positions and velocities of the particles , if they are considered as initial conditions in the fixed potential of the particular snapshot , belong to regular or to chaotic orbits . in general , the same initial conditions in a self - consistent run , i.e. in a time varying potential , do not lead exactly to the same orbits .",
    "this distinction regards a particular snapshot and informs us only about the character of the initial conditions of the orbits in the fixed potential of this snapshot .",
    "however , if the system is in a well established equilibrium ( it has no significant secular evolution ) the coefficients of the potential have only a small noise ( less than 1% ) . we have shown ( voglis et al .",
    "2002 ) that , in this case , if the method of distinction is applied at a different snapshot , e.g. a time of @xmath204 later , only a small number of particles in the system ( less than @xmath205 ) have changed the character of their motion ( from regular to chaotic , or vice versa ) , because of the noise in the coefficients of the potential .",
    "thus , an uncertainty in estimating the fractions of mass in regular or chaotic motion of the order of about @xmath205 always exists .    in a system that develops significant secular evolution , as it is the case of our rotating systems , or the case when the system contains a massive central concentration ( e.g. kalapotharakos et al . 2004 ) , the coefficients of the potential can considerably vary in time , resulting in a considerable change on both the number of chaotic orbits and on the distribution of the lyapunov numbers .",
    "useful pieces of information about the secular evolution of such systems can be obtained by repeating the distinction between regular and chaotic orbits at several snapshots .    in fig .",
    "12a the fractions of mass detected in chaotic motion are shown by points at the snapshots of @xmath147 and @xmath100 joined by lines for all the models as indicated in the figure . in the non - rotating model",
    "q the fraction of mass in chaotic motion remains constant at about @xmath8 all along the period of a hubble time . in the rotating models the fraction of mass in chaotic motion is at the level of about @xmath206 to @xmath207 and",
    "remains on this level , presenting only a small decrease ( of a few % ) at the end of the hubble time .",
    "( notice that all the fractions of mass in this article are with respect to the total mass of the system ) .    a similar representation is shown in fig . 12b , but for the fractions of mass with @xmath208 , that can develop chaotic diffusion in a hubble time .",
    "these fractions range from about @xmath209 to @xmath210 at @xmath57 and from about @xmath211 to @xmath209 at @xmath212 . in other words ,",
    "the lyapunov numbers @xmath213 of a fraction of about @xmath214 of the total mass have been shifted to values smaller than @xmath215 at @xmath212 .",
    "this indicates a tendency of the mass to be self - organized to some degree .",
    "the distributions of chaotic orbits along the axis of @xmath216 are shown in fig .",
    "13 for the four rotating models . in every model",
    "the solid line comes from the snapshot at @xmath57 and the dashed line comes from the snapshot at @xmath212 .",
    "the dotted line with index q in this figure gives the distribution of the q model , for comparison .",
    "all the distributions are normalized with respect to the total mass of the system .    at @xmath57",
    "the maximum of these distributions occurs at values of @xmath216 about @xmath217 for qr1 , qr2 , qr3 , qr4 , respectively , i.e. by about one order of magnitude larger than in the q model , in which the maximum of the distribution occurs at about @xmath218 .",
    "this difference is important for the chaotic diffusion in a hubble time .",
    "a direct consequence of this shift of the lyapunov numbers is that the fraction of mass that can develop effective chaotic diffusion in a hubble time ( @xmath219 ) presents a considerable increase from the level of @xmath9 to the level of @xmath220 , as mentioned above .",
    "it comes out , therefore , that rotation enhances chaos , not only as regards the fraction of mass in chaotic motion , but also as regards the magnitude of the lyapunov numbers , that are seriously shifted towards larger values .",
    "this impressive enhancement of chaos is due to the rotation .",
    "rotation produces two effects . a re - distribution of mass that creates a different self - consistent potential and a series of resonances that affect the dynamical evolution of the system .",
    "a reasonable question at this point is , which of the two effects is more responsible for the enhancement of chaos ?    as we have seen in the models q and c , if there is no rotation chaos increases with increasing departure from sphericity , e.g. with increasing maximum ellipticity .",
    "the new distribution of mass caused by rotation is more complicated than the distribution of mass in the non - rotating models .",
    "namely , the whole distribution of mass is flatter , but the density becomes larger near the center .",
    "a central bar is formed surrounded by a thin and a thick disc . on the disc",
    "the surface density shows an exponential radial dependence and a spiral azimuthal dependence .",
    "this more complicated structure is expected to be in favor of chaos .    on the other hand",
    ", the rotation of the above pattern with a speed @xmath11 introduces instabilities and a sequence of important overlapping resonances between @xmath11 and the frequencies of orbits .",
    "interactions between resonances is known to be an important source of chaos ( contopoulos 1966 ; rosenbluth et al .",
    "1966 ; walker & ford 1969 ; chirikov , israilev & shepelyansky 1971 ; zaslavsky & chirikov 1972 ; chirikov 1979 . for a review see contopoulos 2004 ) .",
    "these two effects can not be disentangled .",
    "however , we can check to what extend each effect is responsible for chaotic motion by the following test .",
    "we consider , for example , that the distribution of mass at a given snapshot , e.g. at @xmath59 , of qr3 does not rotate .",
    "we run the orbits in the fixed potential of this snapshot without rotation ( @xmath221 ) and separate the mass in regular and in chaotic motion by the same method .",
    "the resulting distribution of the chaotic mass along the @xmath216 axis in this case ( non - rotating potential of qr3 at @xmath57 ) is shown by the dotted line with index @xmath222 in fig .",
    "the corresponding fraction of mass is about 46% of the total mass , while the fraction with @xmath223 is only about 15% .",
    "notice that , more than 95% of the identities of particles under the curve @xmath222 in fig .",
    "13c appear also in the group of particles under the curve @xmath57 of the same figure .",
    "the enhancement of chaos between the curves q and @xmath222 can be attributed to the scattering of high energy orbits by the bar and to the torques due to the spiral structure .",
    "such torques are not negligible .",
    "( notice that this is also true in real galaxies , see e.g. gnedin , goodman & frei 1995 ; kormendy & kennicutt 2004 ; block et al .",
    "thus , we conclude that the complicated pattern itself ( formed by the rotation ) increases the mass in chaotic motion even under the absence of resonances .    in the rotating pattern ,",
    "resonances increase further the fraction of chaotic orbits .",
    "furthermore , instabilities introduced by the resonances and interactions between them produce a remarkable increase on the mean level of the lyapunov numbers .",
    "( compare the curves @xmath222 and @xmath57 in fig .",
    "thus , we conclude that rotation enhances the mass in chaotic motion , as well as the mean level of the lyapunov numbers by two collaborating mechanisms , i.e. the more complicated distribution of mass and the instabilities introduced by resonances and interactions between resonances .    during the secular evolution of the systems , part of the mass in chaotic motion",
    "is self - organized , or tends to smaller lyapunov numbers . comparing the distributions of the chaotic mass along the @xmath216 axis at @xmath224 ( solid line ) and @xmath100 ( dashed line ) in fig .",
    "13 , shows that the maximum is shifted towards smaller values and the mass in chaotic motion decreases .",
    "the mass with values of @xmath216 above the limit of @xmath225 at @xmath100 becomes by about 10% smaller as described above ( fig .",
    "a question at this point is how the self - organization observed in this investigation can be compatible with the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "what happens to the entropy ?",
    "self - gravitating systems have negative specific heat ( lynden - bell & wood 1968 ; binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "the angular momentum transference outwards causes an expansion of the outer material of the disc and a shrinking of the inner material .",
    "the energy is redistributed along the radius of the system . in the inner parts the energy decreases , while in the outer parts the energy increases .",
    "an example of comparison of the binding energies of individual particles from qr4 is shown in fig .",
    "14 ( @xmath226 at @xmath57 and @xmath227 at @xmath212 ) .",
    "particles at lower energies lose some of their energy and are projected below the diagonal in this figure , while particles with high energies gain energy and they are projected above the diagonal .",
    "some particles can acquire even positive energies and escape from the system , so the energy of the bound part becomes smaller .",
    "this really happens for about @xmath53 of the particles in each model , as already mentioned at the end of section 2 .",
    "the redistribution of energies is associated with a redistribution of entropy .",
    "some entropy of the inner parts is transferred outwards .",
    "thus , although the total entropy of the system is expected to increase according to the second law of thermodynamics , self - organization is possible due to the redistribution of the binding energies that allows redistribution of the entropy as well .",

    "the set of particles that are detected in chaotic motion at @xmath57 is denoted by c1 and is plotted separately in the right panel of the same row , while the set of the particles that are detected in regular motion at this time is denoted by r1 and is plotted separately in the middle panel .    by comparing the set r1 ( middle panel ) with the set c1 ( right panel ) in a row of these figures",
    "we infer that the spiral arms that are clearly - sighted in qr2 , qr3 , qr4 are almost completely formed by chaotic orbits .",
    "this is a striking new result revealing that a mechanism able to produce spiral arms should be sought in the properties of chaotic orbits rather than in the properties of regular orbits , at least in the case of large deviations from axial symmetry ( strongly perturbed disc ) .",
    "such a mechanism is proposed in voglis , tsoutsis & efthymiopoulos ( 2006 ) . in this article",
    "we show that the spiral structure in these models is guided by the projection on the equatorial plane of the unstable manifolds emanating from the unstable periodic orbits , mainly the unstable manifold emanating from the lagrangian points @xmath233 , @xmath234 ( main manifold ) .",
    "this manifold determines the basic features of the geometry of all the unstable manifolds in the same chaotic domain .",
    "all the unstable manifolds create long - living soliton - like phase correlations between orbits ( as those described in voglis 2003 ) .",
    "an example of how the main manifold reproduces the whole grand design pattern in the model qr3 is given .    during the evolution of the models from @xmath56 to @xmath67 ,",
    "most of the particles in r1 or in c1 maintain their character of motion , but some particles change their character of motion from regular to chaotic and some other particles organize their motion from chaotic to regular .",
    "thus , out of the same initial sample , two new sets of particles in regular and in chaotic motion are detected at @xmath212 .",
    "these sets are denoted by r2 and c2 and they are shown in fig .",
    "17 , which is similar to fig .",
    "16 , but for the time @xmath212 .",
    "spiral arms are not easily discernible in this figures , although we know that even at so late times , as @xmath212 , the @xmath4 mode has a spiral form at least in the region between the corotation radius and @xmath236 ( see fig .",
    "this is because the contrast of the surface density along the spiral arms is so small that can not be easily recognized simply by projecting a sample of particles on the equatorial plane .",
    "it should be noted that the vast majority ( 92%-93% ) of the identities of particles preserve their initial character of motion ( regular or chaotic ) up to the end of the hubble time .",
    "they are common in r1 and r2 or in c1 and c2 . about @xmath7-@xmath205 of the initially regular orbits",
    "become chaotic , and about 5% of the initially chaotic orbits become regular .",
    "also a number of chaotic orbits reduce their lyapunov numbers during a hubble time , showing a tendency of self - organization in the system , as discussed above .    the bar in our simulations is formed by the vast majority of regular orbits ( about 30%-35% ) that remain the same by a factor",
    "more that 90% all during the run .",
    "this regular part of the bar is surrounded by a layer of chaotic particles ( of mass about 10%-15% ) that belongs also to the bar ( chaotic shell of the bar ) .",
    "there is a continuous exchange of chaotic particles between the bar and the disc .",
    "part of the orbits in the chaotic shell of the bar travel outside the bar ( beyond the corotation radius ) along the spiral arms or the disc , but a somehow larger number of other chaotic orbits come into the chaotic shell of the bar and they are trapped there , as chaotic ( or they organize their motion ) , so the size of the bar increases in time .",
    "we have presented the results of several n - body simulations of iso - energetic models of galaxies , having different amounts of angular momenta , but the same scalar virial equilibrium .",
    "we have examined a number of morphological and dynamical properties of these models and we have found the sets of particles that move in regular or in chaotic orbits in every model .",
    "we have compared the spatial distribution of these two sets .",
    "our main conclusions can be summarized as follows :    \\1 ) density waves form a rotating central bar embedded in a rotating thin and a thick disc .",
    "the size of the bar decreases and the density in the region of the bar increases with increasing angular momentum of the models .",
    "\\2 ) beyond the ends of the bar an exponential radial profile of the surface density is formed , resembling the observed corresponding profiles of disc galaxies .",
    "\\3 ) spiral arms are spontaneously formed on the disc , due to an @xmath4 spiral wave fluctuation mode on the surface density , excited by the bar .",
    "spiral arms show an intermittent behavior .",
    "they are deformed , fade or disappear temporarily , but they grow again , in a time scale less than the rotation period of the bar .",
    "the @xmath4 mode preserves its spiral structure outside corotation for a hubble time , during which the bar describes about 20 to 30 rotations ( depending on the angular momentum of the model ) .",
    "the relative amplitude of this mode with respect to higher modes and noise decreases in time .",
    "however , in the region of spiral arms the amplitude of @xmath140 at the end of a hubble time is on the same level as it is given from observational data .",
    "\\4 ) the dynamical rotational velocity curve shows a relatively small variability in a hubble time indicating a slow redistribution of mass .",
    "however , the rotational velocity curve , evaluated from the mean angular momentum of particles inside successive cylindrical rings around the rotation axis , shows a remarkable evolution in time .",
    "namely , this rotation curve decreases in the inner parts , particularly inside one half mass radius , due to the transference of angular momentum outwards .",
    "\\5 ) in faster rotating models ( as in qr2 , qr3 , qr4 ) the central bar loses angular momentum and slows down .",
    "the pattern speed @xmath11 of the bar decreases in time and the respective corotation radius increases by about @xmath5 at the end of a hubble time .",
    "this result is in good agreement with observational data comparing the linear sizes of young and old bars .",
    "\\6 ) rotation enhances chaos substantially , both by increasing the fraction of mass in chaotic motion and by shifting the lyapunov numbers to larger values ( by about one order of magnitude with respect to the non - rotating model ) .",
    "two effects collaborate for this enhancement of chaos , both due to rotation .",
    "the deformation of the distribution of mass relative to the non - rotating model and the resonant effects , particularly near corotation .",
    "the mass that can develop effective chaotic diffusion in a hubble time increases significantly . in our examples , this mass rises ( from the level of 8% of the total mass in the non - rotating q model ) to the level of 45% - 55% in the rotating models .",
    "\\7 ) the energies of chaotic orbits are concentrated around the value of the energy near the corotation radius ( based on the pattern of the central bar ) , while the energies of regular orbits are mainly in the deepest part of the potential well .",
    "\\8 ) a most remarkable result in this work is that spiral arms are almost completely formed by mass in chaotic motion .",
    "this is clearly demonstrated by examining the spatial distribution of the mass in regular and in chaotic motion .",
    "it is significant that in all our models the @xmath4 mode preserves a spiral pattern up to the end of a hubble time .",
    "this mode is gradually obscured by excitation of higher modes and noise .",
    "at least part of the power of the higher modes and the noise is expected to be a real effect , but numerical effects are expected to be present as well . we should keep in mind that integrating orbits in a time varying potential is a demanding problem , mainly as regards the accuracy of reproducing the self - consistent potential and its evolution .    in the level of the available accuracy in the dissipationless simulations presented in this paper ,",
    "our investigation shows only what gravity , combined with rotation , can do .",
    "the relative strength of the @xmath4 wave could be better preserved by the end of a hubble time under the presence of dissipation .",
    "dissipation could absorb noisy components and reinforce the robustness of the @xmath4 mode .",
    "furthermore , gaseous material could be sunk and trapped well inside the corotation radius , as e.g. in bournaud & combes ( 2002 ) ; kormendy & kennicutt ( 2004 ) .",
    "this process enriches the bar with angular momentum , competing the angular momentum transference outwards .",
    "other parameters , not involved in this study , could play a role as well .",
    "e.g. the presence of a massive central black hole could moderate the strength of the bar ( or even destroy the bar , see e.g. shen & sellwood 2004 ) .",
    "furthermore , the rate of redistribution of angular momentum can be modified by the presence of a halo with low values of @xmath0 .",
    "however , chaos can still play an important role in the dynamics and morphology of these systems .",
