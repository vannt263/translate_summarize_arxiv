    "the electromagnetic waves in the terahertz(thz ) region , which is defined in the range from @xmath1thz to @xmath2thz , have wide applications , such as drug detection , materials characterization , security check , and so on .",
    "this has sparked considerable efforts to seek compact and low - cost solid - state generators.@xcite    it has been known for a long time that josephson junctions can be used as electromagnetic oscillators . the power radiated from a single junction , however is in the range of @xmath3 , which is too small for practical applications .",
    "the frequency is about one hundred gigahertz because of the small superconducting energy gap for conventional superconductors.@xcite although one may integrate a large array of josephson junctions made of conventional superconductors on a chip to enhance the radiation power,@xcite the frequency is still below terahertz .",
    "the discovery of intrinsic josephson junctions in layered high-@xmath4 superconductors , such as @xmath5(bscco ) provides a very nice candidate for terahertz oscillator.@xcite the advantages of intrinsic josephson junctions over conventional low temperature junctions are as follows .",
    "first , the junctions are homogeneous in the atomic scale , which makes the coherent radiation in large number of junctions possible .",
    "secondly , the energy gap is about @xmath6mev which corresponds to @xmath7thz .",
    "the terahertz josephson plasma if excited is thus free from landau damping.@xcite    one idea to excite the terahertz wave inside the intrinsic josephson junctions is by the motion of josephson vortices lattice induced by an in - plane magnetic field and a transport current , which has already been investigated both theoretically and experimentally.@xcite in spite of these works , it is still lack of clear evidence of coherent radiation .",
    "radiation from bscco with injection of quasiparticles has been reported@xcite .",
    "alternatively , the terahertz radiation without a magnetic field has also been attempted@xcite .",
    "recently , a strong coherent radiation from bscco in the absence of a magnetic field was observed@xcite , where the mesa of the single crystal of bscco forms a cavity .",
    "the breakthrough in the experiments has inspired considerable theoretical and experimental efforts , aiming to reveal the mechanism of strong radiation.@xcite a new dynamic state has been suggested to explain the experiments@xcite .",
    "it is well known that there exist various dynamic states , such as the mccumber state and states with solitons , with different _ iv _ characteristics in a josephson junction@xcite due to the nonlinearity . in the mccumber state ,",
    "the gauge invariant phase difference is uniform in space , which we will refer to as the state without kink in later discussions .",
    "the soliton solutions are also well known , especially in a single junction , where a quantized particle - like object of @xmath8 phase variation travels along the junction .",
    "recently , a new dynamic state was found , where a @xmath9 phase kink is localized inside the junction with an integer @xmath10.@xcite we will refer to this state hereafter as state with kink . because of the complexity in the dynamics in this highly nonlinear system , theoretical understanding of phase dynamics and its electrodynamics , and finding the optimal state are expected to be helpful for experimental realizations of terahertz generators .",
    "assessments of such a device from a theoretical aspect are also needed .    for this purpose , in this paper",
    "we provide more details on the new dynamic state found in the previous study.@xcite in section ii , we first derive the lagrangian of a stack of josephson junctions based on the superconductor - insulator - superconductor(sis ) model . from the lagrangian we derive the inductively coupled sine - gordon equation .",
    "it also gives the power balance condition . in section iii",
    ", we develop a general procedure to solve the coupled sine - gordon equation from the spectrum analysis , from which we derive the solutions with and without phase kink .",
    "we calculate analytically the _ iv _ characteristics and power radiation of the state with and without kink when the plasma oscillation is small .",
    "numerical simulations are performed to verify the analytical solutions and a good agreement is attained . in section iv , the energy stored in the system is evaluated . in section",
    "v , the far - field radiation pattern from the mesa is calculated both at state with and without kink , which can be used to distinguish the different dynamic states . in section vi , the power radiation from the state with solitons is investigated by simulations for comparison . at last ,",

    "in this section , we calculate the far - field radiation pattern for the mesa operated in the state with kink and without kink , which is important both for applications and for differentiating various states .    to calculate the radiation pattern , we resort to the huygens principle in which the pattern is determined by the oscillation of the electromagnetic fields at the edges of samples , which can be casted into the edge magnetic current and electric current in the formula of equivalence principle.@xcite since there exists a significant impedance mismatch , the electric current produced by the oscillating magnetic field is much smaller than the magnetic current produced by the oscillating electric field , so we can neglect the contribution from the electric current .",
