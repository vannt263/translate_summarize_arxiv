    "stochastic acceleration ( sa ) of particles by plasma waves or turbulence ( pwt ) , a second order fermi acceleration process , plays an important role in understanding the energy release processes and the consequent plasma heating and particle acceleration in solar flares ( e.g. , ramaty 1979 ; mbius et al .",
    "1980 , 1982 ; miller et al .",
    "1997 ; petrosian & liu 2004 , hereafter pl04 ) .",
    "this theory was applied to the acceleration of nonthermal electrons ( miller & ramaty 1987 ; hamilton & petrosian 1992 ; park , petrosian & schwartz 1997 ; petrosian & donaghy 1999 ) , which are responsible for the microwave and hard x - ray emissions and for type iii radio bursts during the impulsive phase of solar flares . in this respect",
    "it has achieved some degree of success ( see pl04 ) .",
    "it has also been advocated for production of nonthermal electrons and ions observed near the earth in association with solar flares ( reames , von rosenvinge & lin 1985 ; mason et al .",
    "1989 ; van hollebeke , mcdonald & meyer 1990 ; bieber et al . 1994 ) .",
    "the accelerated ions show charge - to - mass ratio dependent enhancements relative to the photospheric values , which are readily explained in the context of sa ( miller 2003 ; hurford et al .",
    "1975 ; reames , meyer & von rosenvinge 1994 ; mason et al . 1986 , 2002 , 2004 ; reames & ng 2004 ) . in a few gamma - ray flares , where gamma - ray line emissions due to ion nuclear interactions are clearly observed ,",
    "there is also evidence for an anomalous abundance pattern of the accelerated ions ( share & murphy 1998 ; hua , ramaty & lingenfelter 1989 ) .",
    "the competing models of diffusive shock acceleration and/or direct acceleration by parallel ( to magnetic fields ) electric fields have not been subjected to quantitative tests . in addition",
    "maintaining large electric fields appears to be problematical ( see , however , holman 1985 ) , and there is no convincing evidence for the presence of low coronal shocks for the impulsive flares .",
    "the most critical challenge to these models including the sa model arises from the extreme enhancement of @xmath0he observed in some scatter free impulsive events ( hsieh & simpson 1970 ; serlemitsos & balasubrahmanyan 1975 ; mason , dwyer & mazur 2000 ) .",
    "all models proposed for this are based on either resonant plasma heating or resonant particle acceleration ( fisk 1978 ; temerin & roth 1992 ; miller & vias 1993 ; zhang 1999 ; paesold , kallenbach & benz 2003 ) .",
    "we recently carried out a quantitative study and showed that the sa of @xmath0he and @xmath1he by parallel propagating plasma waves can account for the @xmath0he enhancement , its varied range , and the spectral shape ( liu , petrosian & mason 2004 , hereafter lpm04 ) .",
    "the primary feature of our new finding , which comes from our use of the exact dispersion relation , is that the acceleration of @xmath1he from a low - energy thermal background is suppressed due to its lack of resonance with multiple - waves , a result very similar to the suppression of proton acceleration relative to the electron acceleration ( schlickeiser 1989 ; pl04 ) .    earlier studies of sa of low - energy thermal background electrons and protons revealed an acceleration rate larger than the scattering rate ( pryadko & petrosian 1997 ; pl04 ) .",
    "we show here that , for coronal conditions , this is also true for the sa of @xmath0he and @xmath1he .",
    "consequently , in impulsive events sa by pwt at low energies ( determined by the acceleration rate ) is more efficient than the acceleration by diffusive shocks , whose rate of acceleration is proportional to the scattering rate .",
    "in addition , recent observations of gradual events , which may involve acceleration by interplanetary shocks , suggest that the source population is pre - accelerated by a distinct acceleration process operating in impulsive or gradual flares ( mason , mazur & dwyer 1999 ; desai et al .",
    "2001 , 2003 , 2004 ) .",
    "sa may very well be the agent for this acceleration as well .    in this paper",
    "we explore more realistic models and quantify the dependence of @xmath0he enhancement on basic model parameters . in the next section we discuss the basic features of resonant wave - particle interaction . after showing that the scattering rate is usually lower than the acceleration rate at low energies ,",
    "we calculate the pitch angle averaged acceleration timescales of @xmath0he and @xmath1he under different plasma conditions and for different turbulence spectra , taking into account the uncertainties associated with the generation of turbulence , its cascade and damping .",
    "surprisingly , the acceleration time of @xmath0he is always shorter than that of @xmath1he at nonrelativistic energies . in   [ sep ] the model of sa",
    "is briefly summarized and applied to observations of six impulsive solar energetic particle events ( seps ) observed with the _ advanced composition explorer _ ( _ ace _ ) , where the low - energy ion spectra have convex shapes , which are referred to as ( mason et al .",
    "reasonable fits to the observed @xmath0he and @xmath1he spectra are obtained by adjusting the temperature of the background plasma , the turbulence generation length scale , the intensity of the turbulence , and a normalization factor . in   [ dis ]",
    "we explore the model parameter space to see how observations can be used to constrain properties of the turbulence and the flaring plasma .",
    "it is shown that the acceleration of low - energy @xmath1he can still be suppressed , even without the thermal damping effects , because @xmath1he interacts mostly with small scale waves that have relatively low phase velocities .",
    "the thermal damping effects just amplify this suppression .",
    "the generation length scale of waves in the proton cyclotron ( pc ) branch determines the acceleration rates at high energies and thus mostly affects the high - energy cutoffs . on the other hand , we show that in more strongly magnetized plasmas the accelerations of @xmath1he and @xmath0he become comparable , and @xmath0he enhancement decreases .",
    "this is also true with the increase of the background plasma temperature and/or the intensity of the turbulence . in ",
    "[ sum ] , we summarize the main results and emphasize the importance of studying the properties of the pc branch in understanding the relative acceleration of @xmath0he and @xmath1he . the model limitation and future developments of the sa theory are also discussed .",
    "sa of particles by parallel propagating waves has been explored in pl04 . for the sake of completeness , we summarize here the main results relevant to current study .      to simplify the investigation , we assume that the turbulent plasma waves propagate in a `` cold '' fully ionized plasma",
    ". then the dispersion relation is determined by the ion abundance and the plasma parameter @xmath3 : the ratio of the electron plasma frequency @xmath4 to its gyro - frequency @xmath5 @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the electron number density , and @xmath8 is the large scale magnetic field . in the case of solar flare plasmas ,",
    "modifications to the dispersion relation due to @xmath0he and elements heavier than @xmath1he are negligible ( steinacker et al .",
    "1997 ) . for waves propagating parallel to the large scale magnetic fields ,",
    "one therefore has @xmath9\\,,\\ ] ] where the fraction of @xmath1he number abundance @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the electron - to - proton mass ratio .",
    "the wave frequency and wavenumber are given by @xmath12 and @xmath13 in units of the proton gyro - frequency @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively , where @xmath16 is the speed of light .",
    "the left - handed polarized waves are designated with a negative frequency , and there are five wave branches ( pl04 ) .",
    "figure [ fig1.ps ] shows the @xmath1he - cyclotron ( hec ) and proton - cyclotron ( pc ) branches , which dominate the sa of @xmath0he and @xmath1he ( lpm04 ) , for three values of @xmath3 .     and for @xmath171.0 ( _ dot - dashed curves _ ) , 0.5 ( _ dotted curves _ ) and 0.2 ( _ dot - dashed curves _ ) .",

    "the straight solid and dashed lines in figure [ fig1.ps ] indicate this relation for @xmath0he ( _ thick lower lines _ ) and @xmath1he ( _ thin upper lines _ ) with @xmath27 and two energies .",
    "the intersection points of these lines with the dotted lines for the dispersion relation with @xmath20 designate waves that satisfy the resonance condition .",
    "the fokker - planck coefficients for the particles are calculated by adding contributions from these waves ( dung & petrosian 1994 ) .",
    "the dashed line near the bottom gives the resonance condition for 0.5 kev protons with @xmath28 , which will be useful in understanding the thermal damping effects discussed below .",
    "there has been limited work on a complete kinetic theory description of plasma turbulence detailing the wave generation , cascade , and eventually damping by background particles at small scales .",
    "most of the investigations of plasma turbulence are limited to the mhd regime ( bieber et al .",
    "1994 ; drge 2003 ; hirose et al .",
    "2004 ) , where the wave frequency is much lower than the particle gyro - frequency , and the turbulence cascade is not isotropic for most of the wave modes ( cho & lazarian 2003 , 2004 ) .",
    "a formulation of these processes for application to solar flares is still underdevelopment . here",
    "we study the sa by assuming a power spectrum for the pwt , taking into account the knowledge obtained from recent observations of plasma turbulence in the interplanetary medium and from theoretical investigations .",
    "the main features of pwt can be formated by two length scales : the turbulence generation and the wave damping length scale , and the related spectral indexes .",
    "the turbulence generation length scale is usually related to the large scale dynamical evolution of the system , such as the size of the current sheet between reconnecting magnetic fields . for high frequency wave branches , such as",
    "the pc branch mentioned above , waves can also be generated via coupling with low frequency mhd waves , like those in the hec branch ( xie , ofman , & vias 2004 ) .",
    "although the magnetic reconnections and the consequence energy release and turbulence generation processes seem to involve complex micro- and macro- scopic physics , the turbulence generation length size must be smaller than the typical dimension of the system . for flare conditions ,",
    "such a scale generally implies low wavenumber or frequency waves , which resonate with relativistic particles that is not quite relevant to observations of seps with _ ace_. this is the case for the hec branch so that the low wavenumber cutoff of this branch simply determines the energy content in the turbulence .",
    "the pc branch , on the other hand , mostly interacts with nonrelativistic particles . as discussed in pl04 and lpm04 , large scale waves in this branch",
    "are very efficient accelerators of hundreds of mev protons , @xmath0he and @xmath1he ions .",
    "observations of seps in this energy range can be used to constrain the wave generation at these length scales .",
    "we therefore take the low wavenumber cutoff @xmath29 of the pc branch as one of the primary model parameters .",
    "the high wavenumber cutoff of the turbulence spectrum is determined by the damping rate of these waves by the background plasma .",
    "thermal damping involves complicated nonlinear effects ( swanson 1989 , pp . 122 , 291 , and 305 ) , which can change the wave damping rate , modulate the evolution of the wave spectrum at high @xmath13 , and the particle distribution in the tail of a thermal background plasma .",
    "these determine the injection process of sa .",
    "thermal damping of parallel propagating waves by the background ions has been studied in detail by steinacker et al .",
    "one of the major findings of this work is that waves that resonate with the high - energy tail of a thermal distribution are subjected to strong landau damping .",
    "because the abundances of @xmath0he and elements heavier than @xmath1he are very low , their contributions to the thermal damping effects can be ignored .",
    "but for the short scale waves in the hec and pc branches , which are damped by the background @xmath1he and protons , respectively , the decay time could be comparable to the proton gyro - period .",
    "a steep turbulence spectrum is expected in this wavenumber range .",
    "we assume that the turbulence is unpolarized and has a broken power - law spectrum for each of five wave branches : @xmath30 where @xmath31 indicates the intensity of the turbulent plasma waves , and @xmath29 must be larger ( perhaps much larger ) than @xmath32 for a system with size @xmath33 .",
    "note that @xmath31 , @xmath29 and @xmath34 could be different for different wave branches .",
    "however , we assume that the spectral indexes and @xmath35 are the same for all branches so that the wave intensity only depends on the wavenumber @xmath13 in the inertial ranges , i.e. , between @xmath29 and @xmath34 . from the resonance conditions for @xmath1he and protons with @xmath21",
    "kev / nucleon and @xmath27 in figure [ fig1.ps ] , we set the high wavenumber cutoff @xmath36 for the pc branch and one half of this value for the hec branch .",
    "this characterizes the damping of waves under plasma conditions typical for solar flares ( see xie et al .",
    "2004 ) . because the pc branch is the dominant branch here , in what follows",
    "the corresponding quantities refer to this branch unless specified otherwise .",
    "we choose @xmath37 and @xmath38 as the fiducial parameters , which are consistent with solar neighborhood observations ( bieber et al .",

    "we set @xmath39 in our calculation . ] . for @xmath40",
    "the acceleration and scattering rates of relativistic particles are independent of energy ( corresponding to the so - called hard sphere approximation ) , which gives rise to a power - law particle distribution that is cut off at an energy where the particle resonates with waves with @xmath41 , or where a loss process becomes dominant ( pl04 ) .",

    "because @xmath29 is fixed , the acceleration times in the mev / nucleon energy range do not change significantly .",
    "the plasma parameter , therefore , mostly affects the acceleration rates at low energies and the relative acceleration of the ions .",
    "figure [ fig6.ps ] shows how the acceleration times change with the turbulence spectral indexes @xmath75 . here",
    "we keep @xmath79 and other model parameters unchanged in these calculations .",

    "surprisingly , however , for all the model parameters considered here the acceleration time of @xmath1he is always longer than the @xmath0he acceleration time .",
    "this is one of the key features of sa by parallel propagating waves and has profound implications on the enhancement of @xmath0he and the relative acceleration of the two species .",
    "in the sa theory ions gain energy via their resonant interactions with the pwt and lose energy via coulomb collisions with the background thermal particles .",
    "these processes can be described by the fokker - planck equation , whose coefficients have been calculated in the previous section for interactions with parallel propagating waves under the quasi - linear approximation and where the perpendicular diffusion across magnetic field lines is ignored .",
    "when the wave - ion scattering rate is comparable to the ion acceleration rate , in principle one needs to solve the four - dimensional equation for the particle phase space distribution with the time @xmath80 , momentum @xmath46 , pitch angle cosine @xmath24 , and the location along the large scale magnetic field line @xmath81 as variables .",
    "but the problem can be simplified considerably when one of the rates is much higher than the other ( pryadko & petrosian 1997 ) .",
    "this is the case in the low- and high- energy limits considered here , where the acceleration rate and scattering rate dominate , respectively .",
    "moreover , if the pitch angle dependence of the diffusion coefficients is weak ( e.g. peaked in a narrow range of @xmath24 , see fig .",
    "[ fig2.ps ] ) , then the pitch angle distribution of the particles will be relatively smooth and the anisotropy will be small so that one can use pitch angle averaged quantities . furthermore , because we are mostly interested in the spatially integrated spectra , we can also integrate the particle distribution spatially ( along the field lines ) .",

    "the timescale of source particle injection @xmath89 is determined by the large scale dynamical evolution of the system , which is comparable to the modulation timescale of the solar flare .",
    "because the other interaction times are usually much shorter than the dynamical time of the system , one only needs to consider the steady - state solution of the equation with @xmath92 constant .",
    "then the escaping flux @xmath93 can be compared with the observed fluences of seps with a normalization factor taking into account the duration of the flare and the cross sectional area of the flaring magnetic fields .",
    "( note that for the impulsive seps studied here , the transport effects of the ions from the flaring site in the solar corona to _ ace _ in the earth s neighborhood are negligible because their scattering mean free path is long [ mason et al .",

    "recent observations of seps and radiations produced by solar flares indicate that sa may play a major important role in the acceleration of all particles . it has been applied extensively to impulsive seps , and may be involved in the pre - acceleration of particles in gradual flares , where the particles are further accelerated to even higher energies by interplanetary shocks ( desai et al .",

    "in addition , the stronger the damping of the waves , ( i.e. , the lower the value of the cutoff @xmath34 and/or the larger the cutoff index @xmath71 ) , the stronger the suppression of the acceleration of @xmath1he and the higher the enhancement of @xmath0he . on the other hand ,",

    "it is clear that the model can also be used to study the acceleration of heavy - ions .",
    "the heavy - ion acceleration is dominated by resonant interactions with waves in the hec branch , and ions with lower charge - to - mass ratio are accelerated more efficiently due to their interactions with larger scale waves ( mason et al . 1986 ; mason et al . 2004 ; reames & ng 2004 ) . with simultaneous observations of solar flares by the _ wind _ and _ ace _ spacecrafts ,",
