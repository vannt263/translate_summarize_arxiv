    "this @xmath4 ray is also observed in the double gated spectra shown in fig .",

    "i ) indicating the stretched quadrupole nature of the 137-kev transition .",
    "although , the energy of this @xmath4 ray is too low for the ipdco measurement but the m2 assignment for this low - energy transition may be completely ruled out from the lifetime consideration .",
    "therefore , considering the 137-kev @xmath4 ray as an @xmath37 transition , spin and parity of the 430-kev level has been assigned , in this work , as 10@xmath8 .",

    "the double gated spectrum of 293- and 245-kev shown in fig .",
    "2(a ) has a peak at 374 kev which confirms its placement .",
    "the @xmath37 nature of this transition is also evident from the measured r@xmath34 value ( close to unity ) gated by a known @xmath37 transition .",
    "the placement of the above @xmath4 rays indicates that there should be a 41-kev transition from the 9@xmath8 to the 8@xmath8 state .",
    "this low energy highly converted ( @xmath49 ) transition has not been observed in this work as our experimental set up was not suited to detect such transitions .",
    "it can be seen from fig .",
    "2(a ) that all the @xmath4 rays reported in ref . @xcite",
    "have been observed in the present work up to the 1640-kev state .",
    "however , the 748.6- , 741.9- , 458.6- , 289.4- kev @xmath4 rays , reported in ref .",
    "@xcite and placed above the 1640-kev state , were not observed .",
    "instead , we have observed a cascade of 468- , 292- , 478- and 249-kev @xmath50",
    "@xmath4 rays above the 1640-kev state along with the cross - over @xmath37 transitions .",
    "these @xmath4 rays have been placed above the 687-kev @xmath4 ray in band b1 as they satisfy the corresponding coincidence relations .",
    "it may be pointed out that a more efficient experimental set up was used in the present work than the earlier work . with the observation of these transitions ,",
    "the negative parity ground band b1 has been extended up to an excitation energy of 3.13 mev and a spin of 18@xmath48 .",
    "we have also observed two other band like structures b2 and b3 , for the first time in @xmath0tl .",
    "they are placed above the 16@xmath8 and the 14@xmath8 states of the band b1 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath4 lines belonging to these bands have been seen in the single and double gated spectra shown in fig . 1 and fig . 2(a ) . the spectrum in fig .",
    "2(b ) ( double gate on 760- and 322-kev ) shows the @xmath4 rays belonging to the band b2 .",
    "the spectrum also shows the 761-kev @xmath4 ray , indicating its double placement .",
    "the 687-kev line is observed in this spectrum but not the 726-kev line .",
    "the 216- and the 381-kev @xmath4 rays , belonging to this band , are also observed in this spectrum .",
    "the double gated spectrum of 687- and 726-kev [ fig .",
    "2(c ) ] shows the 760-kev line , slightly lower in energy than the one in fig .",
    "therefore , the higher energy transition ( i.e 761-kev ) of the 760-kev doublet has been assigned as the linking transition between the bands b2 and b1 .",
    "therefore , the lower energy transition ( i.e 760-kev ) of the doublet corresponds to the member of the band b1 .",
    "the 216- , 322- and 381-kev @xmath4 rays are not observed in the spectrum of fig .",
    "2(c ) and hence , they form the members of the band b2 .",
    "to get an unambiguous value for the dco ratios for the 760-and 761-kev transitions , the gating transitions were selected carefully .",
    "the dco ratio values of the doublet can not be distinguised for any choice of a pure @xmath37 gating transition below the 14@xmath8 level .",
    "however , in the 468-kev gate , the 760-kev transition ( in the band b1 ) would be absent and an unambiguous value of dco ratio can be obtained for the 761-kev linking transition . the 468-kev transition has been found to be an @xmath51 transition with very little or no @xmath37 admixture from the negative value of its ipdco ratio .",
    "so , the 468-kev dipole transition was chosen to obtain the dco ratio of the 761-kev linking transition and similarly , the 726-kev quadrupole transition has been chosen as the gating transition to obtain the dco ratio value of the 760-kev in - band transition .",
    "the dco ratios of the 760- and 761-kev transitions , obtained in this way , suggest that both of them are quadrupole transitions .",
    "the ipdco ratio , measured for the in - band 760-kev transition , clearly suggests that it is an @xmath37 transition .",
    "the ipdco ratio could not be obtained for the 761-kev transition and an @xmath37 character for this linking transition has been assumed to assign the parity of the band b2 , tentatively , as negative .",
    "the @xmath52 character for the 761-kev transition could not , however , be ruled out and , hence the parity of the band b2 could be positive as well .",
    "a lifetime measurement of the 18@xmath53 state is necessary to overcome this ambiguity .",
    "the weisskopf estimate of the halflives corresponding to @xmath37 and @xmath52 character of this transition would be @xmath54 pico - sec and @xmath55 nsec , respectively . in the present work",
    ", we could not distinguish these two halflives .",
    "the 876-kev @xmath4 ray has been observed in the double gated spectrum in fig .",
    "2(a ) but not in the double gated spectrum in fig .",
    "2(b ) or 2(c ) .",
    "this @xmath4 ray was observed with any combination of double gates below the 1640-kev level but was not observed with any @xmath4 ray above this level .",
    "this indicates that the 876-kev @xmath4 ray must decay to the 14@xmath8 state of the band b1 .",
    "the cascade of @xmath4 rays in the band b3 has been observed in fig .",
    "2(a ) . a sum of double gated spectra , constructed from the combination of the 687- , 876- , 163- , 207 & 377-kev @xmath4 rays , is shown in fig .",
    "this spectrum clearly shows the 163- , 207- , 328- , 377- & 429-kev @xmath4 rays belonging to this band .",
    "the @xmath37 nature of the 876-kev @xmath4 ray is evident from its dco and ipdco ratios .",
    "therefore , the bandhead of the band b3 has been assigned as 16@xmath8 .",
    "the ordering of the @xmath4s in this band are based on their total intensities . however , since the cross over @xmath37 transitions in this band were not observed , the ordering of the levels may be considered as somewhat tentative . the spins and parities of the states in this band",
    "are assigned from the measured dco and the ipdco ratios of the @xmath4-ray transitions , wherever possible .",
    "the r@xmath34 values of these transitions are very close to the expected values for pure dipole transitions .",
    "the negative values obtained for the ipdco ratios for the 328- and the 377-kev transitions , together with their r@xmath34 values , give clear evidence that they are predominantly m1 in nature . since the other @xmath4 rays are in - band with the 328- and the 377-kev m1 transitions , so , we have assigned m1 nature for all the @xmath4 rays in this band .",
    "the high spin band structure in @xmath0tl , obtained in the present work , can be discussed in the light of the neighboring isotopes .",
    "ground state band structures in the odd - odd tl isotopes in @xmath11 region are similar to band b1 in @xmath0tl . @xmath13tl and @xmath14tl are the other two isotopes for which definite excitation energies , spins and parities are known for this band .",
    "however , it is interesting that the structure of this band in these two nuclei has been interpreted differently . in @xmath13tl ,",
    "this band was interpreted with oblate deformation @xcite while in @xmath14tl , a possible chiral structure has been reported with triaxial deformation @xcite .",
    "we have compared different properties of the ground state band in the odd - odd tl isotopes and have shown that they look very similar .",
    "the configurations of the first few excited states in @xmath0tl are attributed by the following arguments .",
    "the ground state of the odd - a tl isotopes are 1/2@xmath7 corresponding to the 3@xmath56 orbital near the proton fermi level . in the isotone @xmath57hg ,",

    "these states correspond to the @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 orbitals , respectively , near the neutron fermi level .",
    "correspondingly , the configurations of the ground state ( 2@xmath8 ) and the 7@xmath7 isomeric state in the odd - odd @xmath0tl nucleus have been attributed to @xmath61 and @xmath62 configurations , respectively .",
    "the 8@xmath8 state , at the excitation energy of 293-kev , in this nucleus , has been interpreted as the band head of the @xmath5 configuration @xcite .",

    "the band b3 lies at an energy which is somewhat higher than the crossing of the 2- and 4-quasiparticle configurations of the band b1 .",
    "therefore , the band b3 seems to be a 6-quasiparticle band with two more protons in the @xmath9h@xmath10 and @xmath9s@xmath6 orbitals .",
    "the configuration of the band b3 could , therefore , be assigned as @xmath84 .",
    "the respective proton and neutron orbitals constitute the 2-quasiparticle states in this nucleus at the lower excitation energies ( 2@xmath8 state , 7@xmath7 state and the 8@xmath8 band head of the band b1 ) .",
    "the experimental initial aligned angular momentum of 7@xmath48 , deduced for this band , is consistent with the above configuration .",
    "the particle - hole configuration of this band with proton particles in high - j , high-@xmath85 and neutron holes in high - j , low-@xmath85 orbitals ( for an oblate deformation ) is favorable for magnetic rotation ( mr ) and therefore , the excited states , in this band , may be generated by the shear mechanism .",
    "this band , with 3 particle - hole pairs , seems to follow the same general features of mr bands @xcite . for the mr bands , the level energies ( @xmath86 ) and the spin ( @xmath81 ) in the band follow the pattern @xmath87 where , e@xmath88 and i@xmath88 are the energy and the spin of the band head , respectively . the plot of @xmath89 vs. @xmath90 for this band is shown in fig .",
    "the solid line is the fit of the data using the above relation .",
    "the good agreement of the data with the fitted curve , in this plot , clearly indicates that the band b3 closely follows the above relation .",
    "considering a higher limit of the intensity of the unobserved crossover @xmath37 transitions as the level of the background in our data , the lower limit of the @xmath91 ratio has been estimated to be @xmath9228 @xmath93 .",
    "this compares well with the typical value of @xmath9420 @xmath93 for a mr band .",
    "the dynamic moment of inertia j@xmath95",
    "@xmath96 mev@xmath97 obtained for this band is also within the typical value of j@xmath98 @xmath96 mev@xmath97 for an mr band .",
    "all these indicate that the band b3 is , most likely , an mr band .",
    "the band like structure b2 lies at an excitation energy of 3.16 mev with the band head spin of 18@xmath48 .",
    "the parity of this band remains tentative and this band is also not well developed .",
    "therefore , characterization of this band at this moment would be rather prematured .",
    "however , from the systematics of the odd - a tl nuclei , it appears that this band may be generated with an additional proton pair in the i@xmath99 orbital with the 4-quasiparticle configuration of the band b1 above its band crossing .      in order to get an idea about the shape of the tl nuclei for different configurations , the total routhian surface ( trs )",
    "calculations have been performed , in the @xmath100 deformation mesh points , where @xmath101 and @xmath4 are the quadrupole deformation parameters , with minimization in the hexadcapole deformation @xmath102 , for the bands b1 and b3 in @xmath0tl .",
    "the hartee - fock - bogoliubov code of nazarewicz _ et al . _",
    "@xcite was used for the calculations .",
    "a deformed woods - saxon potential and pairing interaction were used with the strutinsky shell corrections method .",
    "the procedure has been outlined in refs .",
    "the contour plots of the trss are shown in fig .",
    "11 for the 2-quasiparticle @xmath5 configuration corresponding to the band b1 ( top panel ) and for the 6-quasiparticle @xmath84 configuration corresponding to band b3 ( bottom panel ) in @xmath0tl .",
    "these surfaces were calculated at the rotational frequencies of @xmath103 mev and 0.16 mev , respectively .",
    "the plots clearly show minima in the trs at an oblate deformation ( @xmath104 is prolate and @xmath105 is oblate ) with @xmath106 and @xmath107 for the band b1 and a near spherical shape with @xmath108 and @xmath109 for the band b3 .",
    "the surfaces calculated for the same 2-quasiparticle configuration as in band b1 are shown in fig .",
    "12 for @xmath77tl and in @xmath14tl .",
    "the minima for these nuclei are also found to be at the oblate deformation with very similar @xmath101 values .",
    "the similarity in the calculated shapes for these nuclei corroborates well with the observed similarities in the properties of the @xmath110 bands in odd - odd tl nuclei .",
    "the oblate shapes in all these three nuclei are predicted to persist over a rotational frequency range up to the band crossing .",
    "after the band crossing , the shape of @xmath0tl remains almost the same with deformation @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "the lack of quadrupole deformation calculated for the band b3 in @xmath0tl is consistent with the non - observation of @xmath37 transitions and the conjecture of mr nature of this band .",
    "the calculated quasiparticle routhians for the protons ( z = 81 ) and the neutrons ( n = 113 ) in @xmath0tl are shown in left and right panels , respectively , of fig . 13 for the deformation parameters @xmath113 and @xmath114 corresponding to the minimum in the trs in fig . 11 .",
    "these calculations predict the first neutron pair alignment ( ab crossing ) at around @xmath115 mev and a second one ( cd crossing ) around @xmath116 mev .",
    "these are in good agreement with the values obtained using similar calculations for @xmath57tl by reviol et al . @xcite . the same nomenclature as that of ref .",
    "@xcite has been used in our calculations to label the quasiparticle levels .",
    "the observed band crossings at @xmath117 mev and at @xmath118 mev in @xmath57tl were identified as due to the first and second neutron pair alignments by reviol et al .",
    "the calculated crossing frequencies , however , are found to underpredict both the experimental crossing frequencies by the same amount and this discrepancy was attributed to the fact that the core deformation is not stiff as assumed in these calculations .",
    "in addition to the first proton pair alignment , as in @xmath57tl , the first neutron pair alignment is also blocked in the odd - odd nucleus @xmath0tl . therefore , the experimental band crossing in @xmath0tl , observed at a rotational frequency of @xmath119 mev , is due to the second neutron pair alignment .",
    "this value of the crossing frequency is in fairly good agreement with the observed second crossing in @xmath57tl but at a slightly lower frequency .",
    "the experimental crossing frequency in @xmath0tl is lowered by 0.03 mev compared to the second crossing in @xmath57tl .",
    "this difference of the experimental crossing frequencies , in these two nuclei , is reproduced well in the calculated second neutron pair alignment frequencies for @xmath0tl ( @xmath116 mev ) obtained in our calculation , and that for the @xmath57tl ( @xmath120 mev ) as obtained by reviol et al .",

    "to investigate the shears mechanism of the band b3 , it has been studied by the semiclassical approach of macchiavelli _ et al .",
    "this is based on a schematic model of the coupling of two long j vectors , ( @xmath121 and @xmath122 ) , corresponding to the proton and the neutron parts of the angular momenta .",
    "this aims at extracting the information on the effective interaction between the nucleons which are involved in the shears mechanism . in this model ,",
    "the shears angle ( @xmath123 ) , between the two j vectors , is an important variable which can be derived using the equation @xmath124 where , @xmath81 is the total angular momentum . considering the @xmath125 and @xmath126 values of 8.5@xmath48 and 13.5@xmath48 , respectively , for the proposed @xmath127 configuration of the band b3",
    ", the band head spin is calculated to be 16 @xmath48 , assuming perpendicular coupling .",
    "this is in excellent agreement with the observed spin of the band head of this band .",
    "the maximum spin for this configuration has been calculated as @xmath128 corresponding to @xmath129 , which is again consistent with the highest spin observed for this band in the present work .",
    "therefore , the angular momentum along the entire range of the band is , most likely , generated through the shears mechanism .",
    "the good agreement of the initial and the final spin values of this band with the calculated ones imply that the spins are generated solely by the shears mechanism with very little or no contribution from the rotation of the core .",
    "this fact is , again , corroborated well by the small quadrupole deformation obtained for this band in the trs calculations .",
    "according to the prescription of macchiavelli _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , the excitation energies of the states in shears bands correspond to the change in the potential energy because of the recoupling of the angular momenta of the shears .",
    "the excitation energies of the states in the band , with respect to the band head energy , can be written as : @xmath130 where , @xmath131 is the energy of the level with angular momentum @xmath81 , @xmath132 is the corresponding shears angle as given in eqn .",
    "3 , @xmath133 is the band head energy and @xmath134 is the strength of the interaction between the blades of the shears .",
    "therefore , @xmath134 can be calculated by using the experimentally observed energy levels of the shears band . in fig .",
    "14 , the @xmath135 is plotted as a function of @xmath123 .",
    "@xmath134 has been extracted from this plot by a fit of eqn .",
    "the fitted curve is shown as the solid line in fig .",
    "the extracted value of @xmath134 comes out to be 1661 kev , which corresponds to an effective interaction of 332 kev per particle - hole pair for the suggested configuration of the band b3 .",
    "this value of the effective interaction is in good agreement with the typical value of @xmath136 kev observed for the mr bands in pb nuclei in this region @xcite .",
    "the @xmath4-ray spectroscopy of the high spin states in the odd - odd nucleus @xmath0tl has been studied in the fusion evaporation reaction using @xmath1re target with @xmath2c beam at 75 mev .",
    "a new and improved level scheme of @xmath0tl is presented in this work which includes 19 new @xmath4-ray transitions . the dco ratio and the polarization asymmetry ratio measurements",
    "have been performed to assign the spins and parities of the levels . the @xmath5 band ( b1 ) in this nucleus has been extended just beyond the band crossing and up to the 18@xmath8 @xmath48 of spin .",
    "the uncertainties in the excitation energies and the spins in this band have been removed .",
    "the moment of inertia , alignment , the energy staggering and signature invesrion of this band have been found to be very similar to its neighoring odd - odd isotopes .",
    "the trs calculations predict similar structure for these nuclei and support the observed similarity .",
    "we have not found any indication of a chiral doublet band structure in @xmath0tl , unlike that which was reported for @xmath14tl .",
    "the observed band crossing in @xmath0tl could also be understood from the band crossing in the neighboring odd - a nuclei with oblate deformation .",
    "therefore , it needs further experimental and theoretical investigation to understand the possible change in the structure of this 2-quaiparticle band in @xmath14tl , if any .",
    "two new side bands ( b2 and b3 ) have been observed in this work , for the _ first time _ , in @xmath0tl .",
    "6-quasiparticle configurations for these bands have been suggested .",
    "a near spherical shape is predicted by the trs calculations for the band b3 and is consistent with the suggested mr nature of this band .",
    "this band has been discussed in the frame work of the semiclassical approach .",
    "the observed band head spin and the range of the spin values of this band are in agreement with such calculations .",
    "however , to get a microscopic understanding of this band , tilted axis cranking calculations are needed .",
