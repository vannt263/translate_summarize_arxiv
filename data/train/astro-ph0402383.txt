    "the interstellar medium ( ism ) in galaxies is excited , dissociated , and ionized by far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) photons produced by young o and b stars .",
    "atomic gas in the ism recombines into molecular form mainly through the catalytic action of dust grain surfaces . in particular , hydrogen nuclei in the ism cycle",
    "repeatedly from the molecular ( ) to the atomic ( ) phase and back again , at rates depending on the incident fuv flux @xmath3 , the total volume density @xmath2 of the gas , and the dust - to - gas ratio @xmath8 .",
    "regions in the ism where the physics is dominated by fuv photons are called photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) .",
    "the surfaces of giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) are important ( and ubiquitous ) examples of pdrs in galaxies .",
    "the physics of pdrs has been explored in detail over the past @xmath9 years by many workers including d.  j.  hollenbach , b.  t.  draine , a.  dalgarno , j.  h.  black , a.  g.  g.  m.  tielens , e.  van dishoeck , j.  le bourlot , and their students and collaborators .",
    "one major focus of this work has been to explain the @xmath10% line - to - continuum ratios of the far - infrared lines of ]  and  in galactic sources observed from high - altitude aircraft and balloon platforms . with the advent of more sensitive space - based observations ,",
    "the models were extended to include the weak rotational - vibrational spectrum of excited  observed on the active pdr surfaces of gmcs that are exposed to relatively intense fuv fluxes from nearby young stars .",
    "an excellent review of the observational and theoretical state of the field is given by @xcite .",
    "pdr model computations have become very detailed and comprehensive , raising the possibility that observations of multiple spectral lines including those from trace molecules such as co can be used to `` invert '' the models in order to determine physical conditions in the ism .",
    "for example , a set of such models has been computed by @xcite for use in the interpretation of far - infrared and submillimeter spectra from galactic and extragalactic sources .",
    "however , we wish to point out that , although there is qualitative agreement on most of the physics , there are differences in the details of the various model codes currently in use around the world as well as differences in the numerical values of the parameters adopted . these differences can lead to disagreements in the values derived for physical conditions even for the same observational data : an example of such differences is illustrated in @xcite .",
    "efforts are underway to intercompare models from different groups in a more systematic manner ( e.  van dishoeck 2003 , private communication ) .",
    "the results obtained from any one model computation ( such as the one we use here ) can therefore be revealing in general , but the specific numerical values obtained should be taken with some caution .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to draw attention to the fact that the  produced from photodissociated  can also be a useful diagnostic for determining physical conditions in pdrs . in particular",
    ", the combination of the 21  cm  and 2.6  mm co(10 ) lines provides a means of independently estimating @xmath2 and @xmath3  in distant pdrs using ground - based radio astronomy data .",
    "these two radio lines form a diagnostic that is particularly useful in the area of parameter space where @xmath3  @xmath4 , 10 @xmath11 ; this range of fuv flux and total density is representative of most of the volume of the ism in galaxies .",
    "our point of departure is the paper by @xcite that describes the results of steady state computations on a specific , extensive set of pdr models over a wide range of physical conditions .",
    "these models are simple one - dimensional semi - infinite slabs of gas with constant density @xmath12 of h nuclei subjected to an equivalent one dimensional flux of fuv photons @xmath3  measured in units of ergs  ps .  over the photon energy range 613.6 ev .",
    "sr is @xmath3  @xmath13 ( @xcite , see our appendix [ app : isrf ] and draine s fig .",
    "the line brightness is calculated along a ray normal to the surface of the slab .",
    "see @xcite for further details of their models .",
    "the incident fuv flux dissociates and heats the cloud surface . at some depth into the cloud",
    ", the dissociation rate has decreased enough to allow co molecules to survive , and the density and heating rate are still high enough to excite rotational line emission from these molecules . among many important results ,",
    "@xcite have computed the 2.6  mm co(10 ) brightness , @xmath14 , emanating from the cloud surface ; this is the most widely studied molecular line in the ism . in figure",
    "[ fig : modelcohi]a we present their results for @xmath15 as a contour diagram of constant surface brightness ( see their fig .",
    "11 ) ; we have extended the range of @xmath2 and @xmath3  down to 1 and 0.03 , respectively , and labeled the contours with their original `` theoretical '' units of ergs  ps .  , as well as with `` co observer '' units of k .",
    "this latter conversion is made according to : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the measured emergent rayleigh - jeans brightness temperature assuming the cloud is completely resolved , @xmath18 is the profile velocity width in , @xmath19 mm , and @xmath20 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "we note that figure [ fig : modelcohi ] assumes that the dust - to - gas ratio @xmath8 is that of the local ism near the sun , and only one side of the slab contributes to the observed emission .",
    "a further caution concerns the value of the density @xmath2 inferred from a specific observed value of the co(10 ) intensity in figure [ fig : modelcohi]a .",
    "there is a general trend in most pdr models to underestimate the co abundance , so that the density inferred from a given observed value of the co(10 ) line is often higher than that obtained from other independent diagnostics .",
    "this is another example in which comparisons among the different modeling efforts will be very useful .",
    "the co(10 ) surface brightness in figure [ fig : modelcohi]a is governed by a complex interplay of processes involving the dissociation and reformation of co molecules , heating and cooling in the ism , and the detailed excitation and macroscopic radiative transfer of the co(10 ) line . by contrast , the 21  cm  line intensity is somewhat easier to compute , since in general this line is optically thin and independent of the kinetic temperature of the ism ; we can therefore ignore the physics of the 21  cm line formation and simply compute the amount of  produced .",
    "incident fuv photons in the wavelength range 9121108   ( 13.611.2 ev ) also dissociate the  on the surface of the gmc .",
    "@xmath21 @xcite .",
    "] this process was first described in the literature by @xcite and is by now well known : it has been summarized by @xcite , who also provide several other references .",
    "the dissociated  creates a `` blanket '' of atomic gas on the surface of the gmc ; the  atoms recombine into  on dust grains and are then returned to the gaseous ism .",
    "approximate analytic expressions for the steady state column density @xmath22 of the atomic gas have been derived by several authors under a variety of limiting assumptions ( e.g.@xcite ) and are discussed in more detail in appendix [ app : modelhiboth ] .",
    "computations of @xmath22 in the context of the present `` standard model '' were first presented in @xcite ( see their fig .",
    "an updated calculation using the latest code and the model parameters in @xcite is presented as the dotted curves in figure [ fig : modelhiboth ] .",
    "the results differ slightly from those of @xcite , owing to small differences in the assumed values of dust abundance , atomic abundances , and a different  formation rate .",
    "this leads to changes in the depth of the  ",
    "transition , and hence to different values of @xmath22 ; the differences are , however , generally less than about a factor of 2 .",
    "a problem arises in attempting to combine the computational results for co(10 ) with those for .",
    "the `` standard model '' used here is bathed in a uniform flux of cosmic rays producing a constant ionization rate of  ps . .",
    "these cosmic rays also produce a faint extended distribution of  atoms owing mainly to ion chemical reactions everywhere in the cloud .",
    "however , as we see below , such a faint extended distribution of  will in general be removed from the observations by the data reduction process , so we would prefer to use models for @xmath22 _ without _ a cosmic - ray component .",
    "nevertheless , cosmic - ray ionization is important for the chemistry in the model , thereby controlling to some extent the abundance of co molecules , so we ought to keep it in the computations of the co(10 ) line .    as a compromise we have chosen to use the approximate analytic expression for @xmath22 since it does not include any effects of cosmic rays .",
    "this approximation is presented in appendix [ app : modelhiboth ] where it is compared with the standard computational model : it is an excellent fit to the model over the full range of parameter space important for this paper and provides a better context in which to compare the theory with the observations . the adopted result for the  column",
    "is shown in figure [ fig : modelcohi]b .",
    "the conversion from  column density in figure [ fig : modelcohi]b to 21  cm emission intensity in k  is : @xmath23 for @xmath22 in units of atoms , and assuming the optical depth of the atomic gas to the 21  cm line radiation is small .    a noteworthy feature of figure [ fig : modelcohi]b is _ the constancy of n ( ) for a constant ratio of @xmath3/@xmath2 _ ( see also eq.[eqn : dissociate1 ] ) ; the same  column density can be produced in high fuv flux , high - density environments or in low fuv flux , low - density environments .",
    "in addition , _ the  column decreases with increasing density at a given value of fuv flux _ : this occurs because the destruction rate for  varies as @xmath2 , but the formation rate varies as @xmath24 ( since the grain density is proportional to @xmath2 ) .",
    "figures [ fig : modelcohi]a and [ fig : modelcohi]b show that the contours of constant co(10 ) emission @xmath15 and constant  column density @xmath22 behave in a complementary fashion .",
    "this suggests that over much of the @xmath2@xmath3  plane an observational determination of @xmath15 and @xmath22 for the same pdr would permit independent estimates to be made of both @xmath2 and @xmath3 . in figure",
    "[ fig : modelboth ] we show the two model computations from figures [ fig : modelcohi]a and b superposed , along with several additional contours and a `` box , '' which will be discussed further below .",
    "the models become progressively less reliable in the top left corner of the plots for both @xmath15 and @xmath22 .",
    "this occurs because the assumption of a steady state model becomes increasingly unreliable in the high @xmath3 ",
    "low @xmath2 section of the diagram ; in this region , radiation pressure causes grains to drift with speeds of the same order as the gas turbulence speeds ( see @xcite , fig .  2 ) .",
    "furthermore , this is also the area of the diagram where large  column densities are predicted ; however , values of @xmath22 in excess of a few @xmath25 @xmath26 are not likely to be observed since the 21  cm line may become optically thick in this regime : @xmath27 for spin temperatures of @xmath28 k , profile fwhms of @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , values that probably represent the extremes typical for the observations .",
    "it should be emphasized that the present calculations of surface brightness can be applied directly only to observations for which the sources of emission are resolved . in any realistic situation ,",
    "the emission probably arises from several pdr surfaces . in this case",
    ", the density and fuv intensity derived from our model using observations of @xmath15 and @xmath22 represent ensemble averages of the distribution of values for @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite have shown that these averages are somewhat biased toward higher fuv fields ; bias toward high or low density depends on the cloud distribution .",
    "the x  axis of figure [ fig : modelboth ] refers to the total volume density in our computational model of an isopycnic cloud . in a real gmc",
    "this is likely to be close to the actual density at the depth in the cloud where the co(10 ) line is formed .",
    "however , it is not likely to be representative of the density of dissociated . this is because the various heating processes at the surface of the gmc ( including photodissociation ) will lead to gradients in temperature and , therefore , if the pressure is roughly constant , to gradients in density .",
    "for example , the model computations of @xcite for relatively low fuv fluxes used by allen et al .  to denote the fuv flux has very nearly the same value as we use here , @xmath31",
    "@xmath3/0.85 for irradiation over @xmath32 sr .",
    "see appendix [ app : isrf ] for a discussion of the various definitions of fuv values used in the literature on pdrs .",
    "] of @xmath3  @xmath33 show that the density at the co(10)-emitting layer is about 5 times that at the    interface .",
    "their figure 4 shows that the co emission emanates from a depth such that @xmath34 , where the temperature is just below 5 k ( see their fig .",
    "3b ) , whereas their figure 2 shows the  ",
    "interface is effectively at very small values of @xmath35 , where the temperature is about 25 k. we have calculated temperatures for higher fuv flux levels @xmath3  = 3 : the surface temperatures are higher in this case , @xmath36 k at the   interface , and @xmath37 k at the co emission layer , for a ratio of @xmath38",
    ". this ratio will continue to rise for yet higher photon fluxes , since the increased surface heating will result in further increases in surface temperature , but the increase in temperature deeper in the clouds where the co(10 ) emission is formed will be less rapid because of more effective cooling .",
    "if the density and temperature are linked by an isobaric condition , the density observed in the bulk of the  may be a factor of 510 lower than that inferred for the co(10 ) line .",
    "it is clear from this discussion that constant - density models for pdrs such as the one we have assumed here are not likely to be very realistic .",
    "more sophisticated models , for example assuming pressure equilibrium , or a full computation with various forms of micro- and macro - turbulent pressure ( e.g. , @xcite ) over the range of the @xmath3@xmath2 parameter space may provide more realistic results and ought to be explored .",
    "figure [ fig : modelboth ] clearly shows the complementarity of 21  cm  and 2.6  mm co(10 ) radio line emission as diagnostics of pdrs . over the range of validity of our calculations , the co(10 ) line brightness @xmath15 depends mostly on the volume density of the gas for @xmath39 , no matter how intense the fuv flux . to the fuv flux",
    "comes about because increasing @xmath3  merely leads to more photodissociation of the surface co , and the co - emitting layer retreats deeper into the static cloud where the temperatures are about the same as they were for the case of lower @xmath3 . ] on the other hand , for constant @xmath2 the brightness increases nearly linearly with increasing fuv fluxes up to @xmath3@xmath40 , becoming logarithmic for higher fuv fluxes .",
    "accordingly , the combination of measurements of @xmath22 and @xmath15 from the same pdr can provide unique values for @xmath2 and @xmath3  over a substantial range in the diagram .",
    "how can extraneous emission from gas that lies far outside the cloud be identified ?",
    "the spatially layered structure of pdrs provides a direct clue , as has been convincingly shown e.g.  by the observations of the orion bar region ( see fig .  2 in @xcite ) on the @xmath41 pc scale . a more or less edge - on viewing angle",
    "is required for a certain identification , and one ought to remove any extended emission that is associated with other clouds along the line of sight or produced by other excitation mechanisms .",
    "galaxies that are viewed at low to intermediate inclination angles are favorably oriented for this identification to work , and @xcite and @xcite have shown that the signature morphology can be found at 100 pc scales in the highest resolution  images of nearby galaxies m81 and m101 .",
    "as to the co , it is generally assumed that this arises in pdrs , although the morphological signature is not always clear .",
    "figure [ fig : modelboth ] provides a method for determining @xmath2 and @xmath3for a specific pdr if @xmath22 and @xmath15 can be determined observationally . as an example",
    ", we consider the galactic object g216",
    "-2.5 ( also called `` maddalena s cloud '' ) which has been proposed to be a large pdr in the galaxy by @xcite .      determining the column density of that part of the  associated with g216",
    "-2.5 is made quite difficult by confusion from unassociated superposed along the line of sight through the galaxy .",
    "several estimates can be made from the single - dish observations reported by @xcite .",
    "first , and perhaps simplest , we estimate that fraction of the total averaged profile shown in their figure 1 that is in the velocity range of the co(10 ) emission ( also shown on the same figure ) ; the  profile shows three overlapping peaks and integrates to @xmath42 k @xmath43 @xmath44 k = .",
    "the averaged @xmath15 profile corresponds to the central  peak and is @xmath45  wide @xcite , so the average amount of  column associated with the co emission is , by this estimate , probably not more than @xmath46 = . in their  3.2.2 ,",
    "@xcite carry out a more involved analysis with area integrations of the  in the velocity range 1638  and conclude that the `` excess ''  associated with the pdr is @xmath47 ; the uncertainty in this method is approximately a factor of 2 ( r.  maddalena 2002 , private communication ) . a value in the range",
    "may therefore be considered typical for this cloud , with some preference for the lower end of that range .      from figure 1 of @xcite , the total @xmath15 profile over the whole cloud integrates to @xmath48 k .",
    "the co(10 ) map for the cloud integrated over the same velocity range of 1638  as the is shown in figures 2 and 4 of @xcite , based on earlier data of @xcite .",
    "maps in @xcite are similar in shape but brighter by about a factor of 2 when compared to the earlier map of @xmath15 in fig .  2 of @xcite .",
    "this is not likely to be an effect of differences in the velocity range over which the data have been integrated , since that range is smaller than the range of 1540 used by maddalena & thaddeus .",
    "we use the more recent results of williams & maddalena . ] from figure 2 of @xcite the co(10 ) brightness ranges from 37 contours with a few positions reaching 10 contours . a range of 38 contours or 616",
    "k  therefore seems representative of the co data , again with some preference for the lower end of that range .",
    "the range of values for @xmath15 and @xmath22 obtained above is plotted as a black box on our figure [ fig : modelboth ] . in the context of our model , these values describe gas with a density range of  and an incident fuv flux of 0.17 of the standard value @xmath3near the sun , with likely values being approximately  and 0.8 , respectively .",
    "although no independent measurements of the total volume density are available for g216  -2.5 , the value we have obtained is in the range generally indicated for gmcs in the galaxy ( @xmath49 , e.g. , @xcite ) . as to the fuv flux , @xcite estimated @xmath3  @xmath10 from what is known about the two nearby young stars identified in their study as likely to be responsible for the photodissociation .",
    "our model thus agrees well with the observations .",
    "the practical detection limits for the  21 cm line are @xmath50 and @xmath51 k  for single - dish survey and interferometer array imaging observations , respectively , corresponding to @xmath52 and .",
    "these are shown as the dashed ( single - dish survey ) and dotted ( interferometer array ) lines for @xmath22 on figure [ fig : modelboth ] .",
    "the corresponding values for the 2.6  mm co line are @xmath10 k  ( dashed line : single dish survey ) and @xmath53 k  ( dotted line : interferometer array ) . in all cases , this assumes that the gas clouds are resolved ; otherwise these limits need to be increased further by the ratio of the beam area to the cloud area .    locating the detection limits on our figure [ fig : modelboth ]",
    ", we can conclude that the range in parameter space over which the combination of and co(10 ) can provide useful constraints on @xmath2 and @xmath3  is given approximately by @xmath3  @xmath4 , 10  @xmath54 .",
    "these boundaries are set by the decreasing sensitivity of the  emission at high fuv flux levels ( @xmath22 increases only logarithmically for high @xmath3  at constant @xmath2 ) and by observational detection limits ( @xmath15 disappears at low @xmath2 owing to insufficient excitation of the transition ;  disappears at high @xmath2 as the gas stays mostly molecular ) .",
    "many observers who report synthesis imaging ( interferometer array ) data in the literature use units of jy beam@xmath55 instead of k. the required conversion factors are ( unfortunately ) telescope dependent ; appendix [ app : conversions ] provides an approximate recipe for these conversions .",
    "we have shown that a combination of observations in the 21  cm line of  and the 2.6  mm line of co can provide a useful diagnostic for physical conditions in distant pdrs . both of these lines",
    "are readily observed in the galaxy and in nearby galaxies using ground - based single - dish and interferometer - array radio telescopes . the useful range in parameter space for this combined radio line diagnostic is approximately bounded by @xmath3  @xmath4 , 10 @xmath5 , a range that covers a large fraction of the volume of the ism in galaxies .",
    "the unique layered morphology of the emission in pdrs provides a means of identifying that part of the  and co emission that is related when that morphology is observable , but confusion along the line of sight makes this separation difficult in the galaxy .",
    "this method will be especially useful for the interpretation of high - resolution  and co synthesis imaging data in nearby galaxies where the pdr morphology can be more easily identified .",
    "improvements in the model parameters and in the details of the computations are anticipated in the near future that will permit even more precise values of @xmath3  and @xmath2 to be obtained .",
    "we are grateful to bruce draine and david hollenbach for discussions on the physics of pdrs .",
    "david also provided very helpful comments on earlier drafts of this paper .",
    "the referee offered many useful suggestions that have also been incorporated .",
    "the  column density in a pdr is calculated with the same physics used to determine the excitation of the  near - infrared fluorescence lines . a logarithmic form for the analytic solution to the equation for formation  destruction equilibrium was first given by @xcite ( see also eq . a2 in @xcite . ] and eq . 3 in @xcite ) .",
    "the model is a simple semi - infinite slab geometry in statistical equilibrium with fuv radiation incident on one side .",
    "the solution gives the steady state  column density along a line of sight perpendicular to the face of the slab as a function of @xmath56 , the incident uv intensity scaling factor ( see appendix [ app : isrf ] ) , and the total volume density @xmath2 of h nuclei .",

    "this is because @xcite and @xcite use different normalisations for the fuv flux ( see appendix [ app : isrf ] ) .",

    "the result is that no consistent improvement is obtained by using any value for the coefficient of @xmath3  other than the value 106 deduced above , although a modest improvement is obtained by using a slightly larger value for the leading coefficient in the equation , , corresponding to a value of @xmath70 for the effective grain absorption cross section . with these small adjustments ,",

    "however , other characterizations of the fuv background also appear in the literature for the `` typical '' and local ism .",

    "furthermore , the `` strength '' of the interstellar fuv field is described in the literature by several different quantities ( e.g. , energy density , photon intensity , energy flux ) using a variety of units .",
    "some authors use a single symbol to report normalized values of their field descriptor , while others specifically represent the normalized quantity by a ratio .",
    "accordingly , the purpose of this appendix is to summarize the approach taken by habing and draine in developing their descriptions of the isrf at ultraviolet wavelengths and to interrelate the representations of that field adopted by several authors whose work is germane to our paper .",
    "@xcite calculated radiation energy density values , @xmath77 , at 1000 , 1400 , and 2200   which were averaged `` over a considerable area '' in space , using bandwidths of 9121040 , 13001450 , and 19002400  , respectively .",
    "his recommended values for the averaged energy density @xmath78 were    @xmath79    however , habing s results depend strongly on assumptions made concerning the wavelength dependence of interstellar extinction and the presence of diffuse galactic light .",

    "the divisor , @xmath115 ergs @xmath26 s@xmath55 sr@xmath55 , was determined from the `` uv field '' results in the solar neighborhood presented by @xcite .",

    "since @xmath56 was normalized by draine s standard background between 6 and 13.6 ev , and @xmath116 was computed by integrating the same curve over a similar energy range ( the lower limits may differ by 0.2 ev ) , @xmath112 is equivalent to @xmath56 .",

    "accordingly , over that band @xmath3  @xmath121 . since @xmath116 ( with units of ergs @xmath26 s@xmath55 sr@xmath55 ) represents an intensity that is referenced to draine s standard curve , it can be written as @xmath122 , whereby @xmath3@xmath123 . inserting this into equation 12 of @xcite , the argument of the logarithm , i.e. , @xmath124 + 1 $ ] can be written as @xmath125 + 1 $ ] , in agreement with equation [ eqn : dissociate1 ] when the latter is written to accommodate irradiation over @xmath107 sr .",
    "it is common practice to report results from imaging synthesis observations of radio spectral lines as contour diagrams of constant surface brightness using `` j beam@xmath55 '' as the unit . ''",
    "( e.g.fig .  4 in @xcite ) .",
    "] this unfortunate combination of units is telescope dependent through the use of the beam unit in the denominator .",
    "the conversion to telescope - independent units such as k  ( which we use here in eqs .",
    "[ eqn : tmbco ] and [ eqn : tmbhi ] ) requires knowledge of the beam area of the radio telescope in steradians , which is not well defined for any radio synthesis imaging telescope owing to the absence of information at short interferometer spacings .",
    "fortunately ( at least for now ) , most data processing systems perform an image restoration step that sets the final point spread function to be a two - dimensional gaussian .",
    "this provides a definite ( but not necessarily accurate ) value for the two - dimensional integral over the beam , and thereby `` solves '' the unit conversion problem .",
    "if we take the fwhms of this gaussian to be @xmath126 and @xmath127 , then the conversion for 21  cm  image contours may be done with the relation          with the same units as the previous equation . we emphasize again that these temperatures are well defined only for completely resolved sources .",
