    "from the recent experiments on atmospheric @xcite and solar @xcite , and reactor @xcite neutrinos , we now know approximately the values of the mixing angles and the mass squared differences of the atmospheric and solar neutrino oscillations :    @xmath13    where we use the standard parametrization @xcite of the mns mixing matrix @xmath14 and the case of @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) corresponds to the normal ( inverted ) mass hierarchy , as is shown in fig.[fig1 ] . in the three flavor framework of neutrino oscillations , the oscillation parameters which are still unknown to date are the third mixing angle @xmath17 , the sign of the mass squared difference @xmath18 of the atmospheric neutrino oscillation , and the cp phase @xmath9 .",
    "it is expected that long baseline experiments in the future will determine these three quantities .    since the work of @xcite",
    ", it has been known that even if the values of the oscillation probabilities @xmath19 and @xmath20 are exactly given we can not determine uniquely the values of the oscillation parameters due to parameter degeneracies .",
    "there are three kinds of parameter degeneracies : the intrinsic @xmath21 degeneracy @xcite , the degeneracy of @xmath22 @xcite , and the degeneracy of @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic degeneracy is exact when @xmath24 is exactly zero .",
    "the sgn(@xmath18 ) degeneracy is exact when @xmath25 is exactly zero , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 stand for the matter effect and the baseline , respectively ( @xmath28 is the fermi constant and @xmath29 is the electron density in matter ) . the @xmath7 degeneracy is exact when @xmath30 is exactly zero .",
    "each degeneracy gives a twofold solution , so in total we have an eightfold solution if all the degeneracies are exact . in this case prediction for physics",
    "is the same for all the degenerated solutions and there is no problem .",
    "however , these degeneracies are lifted slightly in long baseline experiments , may be exactly zero , but the present atmospheric neutrino data @xcite allow the possibility of @xmath31 , so we will assume @xmath31 in general in the following discussions . ] and there are in general eight different solutions @xcite .",
    "when we try to determine the oscillation parameters , ambiguities arise because the values of the oscillation parameters are slightly different for each solution . in particular , this causes a serious problem in measurement of cp violation , which is expected to be small effect in the long baseline experiments , and we could mistake a fake effect due to the ambiguities for nonvanishing cp violation if we do not treat the ambiguities carefully .    in the references @xcite in the past , various diagrams have been given to visualize how degeneracies are lifted in the parameter space .",
    "to see how the eightfold degeneracy is lifted , it is necessary for the plot to give eight different points for different eight solutions .",
    "an effort was made in @xcite to visualize the eight different points by plotting the trajectories of constant probabilities in the @xmath32 plane . in the present paper",
    "we propose a plot in the @xmath0 plane , which offers the simplest way to visualize how the eightfold degeneracy is lifted . as a byproduct ,",
    "we show how the third measurement of @xmath33 , @xmath34 or @xmath12 resolves the ambiguities , after the jparc experiment @xcite measures the oscillation probabilities @xmath1 and @xmath2 at the oscillation maximum , i.e. , at @xmath3 .    in the following discussions we assume that @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are sufficiently precisely known .",
    "this is justified because the correlation between these parameters and the cp phase @xmath9 is not so strong in the case of jparc @xcite , and we can safely ignore the uncertainty of these parameters to discuss the ambiguities in @xmath9 due to parameter degeneracies .",

    "let us look at three typical cases : @xmath27=295 km , @xmath27=730 km , @xmath27=3000 km , each of which corresponds to jparc , off - axis numi @xcite , and a neutrino factory @xcite=3000 km the density of the matter may not be treated as constant , and the probability formulae ( [ degene3n ] ) and ( [ degene3i ] ) may no longer be valid .",
    "it turns out , however , that the approximation of the formulae becomes good if we replace @xmath25 by @xmath144 everywhere in the formula . in the following discussions ,",

    "the four ( red or blue ) curves are separated into two pairs of curves . as we will see later , the large split is due to the @xmath5 ambiguity , while the small split is due to the @xmath108 ambiguity .",
    "the reason that the latter splitting is small is because the difference of the values in the cp phases is small , as is seen from eq .",
    "( [ th23d ] ) . in some of the figures in figs.[fig7],[fig8],[fig9 ]",
    "the number of the red or blue curves is less than four because not all values of @xmath9 give consistent solutions for a set of the oscillation parameters .",
    "let us discuss each ambiguity one by one .      as was mentioned above",
    ", the large splitting of four ( red or blue ) lines into two pair of lines is due to the @xmath5 ambiguity . from eqs .",

    "if @xmath164 , we have @xmath165 , and the values of @xmath52 with @xmath9 and with @xmath159 are different .",
    "thus , to resolve the @xmath5 ambiguity it is advantageous to perform an experiment at @xmath77 which is farther away from @xmath166 .",
    "deviation of @xmath77 from @xmath166 implies either high energy or low energy . in general",
    "the number of events increases for high energy because both the cross section and the neutrino flux increase , so the high energy option is preferred to resolve the @xmath5 ambiguity .",
    "ambiguity at neutrino factories was discussed in @xcite ]      as one can easily imagine , the sgn(@xmath18 ) ambiguity is resolved better with longer baselines , since the dimensionless quantity @xmath167km)(@xmath168g@xmath169@xmath170 becomes of order one for @xmath1711000 km . on the other hand , from figs.[fig8 ] and [ fig9 ] , we observe that the split of the curves with the different mass hierarchies ( the red vs blue curves ) is larger for lower energy .",
    "naively this appears to be counterintuitive , because at low energy the matter effect is expected to be less important ( @xmath172 ) .",
    "however , this is not the case because we are dealing with the value of @xmath47 which is obtained for a given value of @xmath125 . to see this ,",

    "this phenomenon suggests that it is potentially possible to enhance the matter effect by performing an experiment at low energy ( @xmath182 ) even with @xmath27=730 km , and it may enable us to determine the sign of @xmath18 at the off - axis numi experiment .",
    "while the neutrino flux decreases for low energy at the off - axis numi experiment , the cross section at @xmath111gev is not particularly small compared to higher energy , so the low energy possibility at the off - axis numi experiment deserves serious study .",

    "we will discuss the @xmath52-intercept at @xmath174 instead of calculating the slope itself , because it is easier to consider the @xmath52-intercept and because the difference in the @xmath52-intercepts inevitably implies the different slopes for the two lines , as almost all the curves are approximately straight lines . in the case of jparc",

    "this is one of the conditions to resolve the @xmath7 ambiguity .",
    "here we are using the reference value @xmath183 , so the deviation becomes maximal if @xmath192 . in real experiments , however , nobody knows the value of the true @xmath9 in advance , so it is difficult to design a long baseline experiment to resolve the @xmath108 ambiguity . if @xmath9 turns out to satisfy @xmath193 in the result of the third experiment , then we may be able to resolve the @xmath7 ambiguity as a byproduct .",

    "namely , in real experiments all the measured quantities have errors and the curves become thick . in this case",
    "the allowed region is small area around the true solution in the @xmath0 plane and one expects that the fake solution with respect to the @xmath7 ambiguity can be excluded .",
    "this is in contrast to the case of the @xmath33 and @xmath34 channels , in which the slope of the red curves is almost the same as that of the jparc green line and the allowed region can easily contain both the true and fake solutions , so that it becomes difficult to distinguish the true point from the fake one .",
    "as in the case of the @xmath33 channel , the @xmath5 ambiguity is expected to be resolved more likely for the larger value of @xmath202 , and the sgn(@xmath18 ) ambiguity is resolved easily for larger baseline @xmath27 ( e.g. , @xmath2033000 km ) .",
    "thus the measurement of the @xmath12 channel is a promising possibility as a potentially powerful candidate to resolve parameter degeneracies in the future .",
    "in this paper we have shown that the eightfold parameter degeneracy in neutrino oscillations can be easily seen by plotting the trajectory of constant probabilities in the ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 ) plane . using this plot ,",
    "we have seen that the third measurement after the jparc results on @xmath1 and @xmath2 may resolve the sgn(@xmath4 ) ambiguity at @xmath1711000 km , the @xmath5 ambiguity off the oscillation maximum ( @xmath204 ) , and the @xmath7 ambiguity if @xmath8 is small and @xmath9 turns out to satisfy @xmath205 . in general all these constraints on @xmath138 may be satisfied by taking @xmath206 . the condition @xmath206 , however , actually corresponds to the oscillation minimum , and the number of events is expected to be small for a number of reasons : ( 1 ) the probability itself is small at the oscillation minimum ; ( 2 ) @xmath206 implies low energy and the neutrino flux decreases at low energy ; ( 3 ) the cross section is in general smaller at low energy than that at high energy .",
    "therefore , to gain statistics , it is presumably wise to perform an experiment at @xmath207 after jparc .",
    "the off - axis numi experiment with @xmath207 ( @xmath111gev ) may have advantage to resolve these ambiguities .",
    "as is seen in figs.[fig8 ] and [ fig9 ] , the experiments at the oscillation maximum does not appear to be useful after jparc except for the sgn(@xmath4 ) ambiguity . in order to achieve other goals such as resolution of the @xmath5 ambiguity and the @xmath7 ambiguity , it is wise to stay away from @xmath101 in experiments after jparc .",
    "although only the oscillation probabilities were discussed without taking the statistical and systematic errors into account in this paper , we hope that the present work gives some insight on how the ambiguities may be resolved in the future long baseline experiments .",
