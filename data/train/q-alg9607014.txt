    "<S> our results give rise to what we call a `` higher - level '' bailey lemma . as an application </S>",
    "<S> it is shown how this lemma can be applied to yield general @xmath6-series identities , which generalize some well - known results of andrews and bressoud .    </S>",
    "<S> a well - known approach to proving @xmath6-series identities of the rogers  ramanujan type is the andrews  </S>",
    "<S> bailey construction  @xcite , given by the following lemma .    </S>",
    "<S> [ lab ] let @xmath7 and @xmath8 be sequences which satisfy @xmath9 for all @xmath10 . then the sequences @xmath11 and @xmath12 defined by @xmath13 \\beta'_l & = & \\sum_{r=0}^l \\frac{(\\rho_1)_r ( \\rho_2)_r ( aq/\\rho_1 \\rho_2)^r ( aq/\\rho_1 \\rho_2)_{l - r } } { ( aq/\\rho_1)_l ( aq/\\rho_2)_l ( q)_{l - r } } \\ : \\beta_r , \\label{ab}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] again satisfy equation ( [ ab ] ) .    a pair of sequences  that satisfies ( [ ab ] ) is called a bailey pair relative to @xmath14 . the iteration of lemma  [ lab ] : @xmath15 is called a bailey chain . </S>",
    "<S> the symbol @xmath16 in the above lemma is the usual @xmath6-shifted factorial , @xmath17 and @xmath18    perhaps not so well - known however , is that bailey in his original paper  @xcite considered another pair of sequences @xmath19 and @xmath20 related by @xmath21 for all @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> we will refer to a pair of sequences  which satisfies ( [ gd ] ) as a conjugate bailey pair relative to @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> bailey noted that given a bailey pair and some conjugate bailey pair ( both relative to @xmath14 ) the following identity holds : @xmath22 as pointed out by andrews  @xcite , lemma  [ lab ] is a special case of this result with conjugate bailey pair @xmath23 and @xmath24 where @xmath25 is an arbitrary non - negative integer .    </S>",

    "<S> this gives the simple expressions @xmath29 it is the aim of this paper to show that these two expressions are the first instances of an infinite series of conjugate bailey pairs . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we establish a conjugate bailey pair relative to @xmath30 , for each pair of non - negative integers @xmath3 and @xmath2 , positive integer @xmath31 and partition @xmath32 with largest part not exceeding @xmath5 . for @xmath33 and @xmath34 or @xmath35 , </S>",

    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the conjugate bailey pair ( [ gammadelta ] ) with @xmath14 of the form @xmath36 is the special case @xmath37 and @xmath33 .    </S>",
    "<S> before we proceed we note that milne and lilly  @xcite have recently given higher - dimensional generalizations of the bailey transform and the bailey lemma in the setting of very - well poised basic hypergeometric functions on the higher rank groups a@xmath38 and c@xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> specifically they generalized the defining relation of a bailey pair to higher rank ( equation ( [ lab ] ) corresponding to a@xmath39 ) and obtained the corresponding generalization of lemma  [ lab ] . </S>",
    "<S> this has to be contrasted with the results obtained in this paper , which stay within the framework of a@xmath39 , but provide higher - level ( spin ) representations for conjugate bailey pairs . </S>",
    "<S> indeed these representations involve expressions closely related to the string functions of the affine lie algebra a@xmath40 at level @xmath31 , and can be used to obtain @xmath6-series identities for the branching functions of the level-@xmath31 a@xmath40 cosets theories .    in the next section </S>",
    "<S> we slightly reformulate the definition of a conjugate bailey pair and state our main result ; an infinite hierarchy of conjugate bailey pairs . in section  [ secproof ] </S>",
    "<S> we present a recursive proof of our result using telescopic expansion techniques . in section  [ secapp ] </S>",
    "<S> we apply what we term the `` higher - level '' bailey lemma to derive a very general @xmath6-series identity , which contains many known rogers - ramanujan type identities as specializations . for the proof of this general identity </S>",

    "<S> we finally conclude with a brief discussion of our results .    </S>",
    "<S> [ seccbp ] in the following we present an infinite series of pairs of sequences  which satisfy equation ( [ gd ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , for notational reasons it turns out to be fruitful to slightly modify the definition ( [ gd ] ) of a conjugate bailey pair .    a pair of sequences @xmath41 and @xmath42 which satisfies @xmath43 for all @xmath44 is called a -pair relative to @xmath14 .    at first sight </S>",
    "<S> it may seem that a -pair is more general than a conjugate bailey pair , reducing to it for @xmath33 . </S>",

    "<S> more compactly we denote @xmath100    after stating theorem  [ thgd ] , it seems appropriate to make a few remarks about its origin . in statistical mechanics </S>",
    "<S> there has recently been much interest in so - called fermionic representations of virasoro characters , see e.g. , ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such fermionic character representations relate to combinatorial or `` subtractionless '' bases for virasoro modules . </S>",
    "<S> one of the most successful approaches to this problem has been the study of exactly solvable lattice models using what is termed the bethe ansatz technique . </S>",

    "<S> okado models  @xcite , as obtained in ref .  </S>",

    "<S> maybe more important than theorem  [ thgd ] itself is the following corollary .    </S>",
    "<S> [ corgd ] let @xmath106 and @xmath98 be as in theorem  [ thgd ] . </S>",
    "<S> then the following two sequences form a conjugate bailey pair relative to @xmath36 : @xmath107 and @xmath108 here @xmath94 is given by ( [ mn ] ) and @xmath109 by @xmath110    we remark that this generalizes the conjugate bailey pair ( [ gammadelta ] ) ( with the restriction @xmath36 , @xmath111 . )    to conclude this section we note that corollary  [ corgd ] will be used in the following for applications rather than theorem  [ thgd ] . </S>",

    "<S> we show that both the left- and right - hand side of ( [ lem ] ) , denoted by @xmath126 and @xmath127 , respectively , obey the recursion relations @xmath128 as well as the initial condition @xmath129    equations ( [ rec])([initial ] ) fix the function @xmath130 uniquely . with ( [ initial ] ) as a seed , recurrence ( [ boundrec ] ) gives @xmath131 , for all @xmath132 . </S>",
    "<S> now assume that @xmath131 is known for all @xmath133 , with @xmath134 . </S>",
    "<S> since ( [ rec ] ) expresses each @xmath131 with @xmath135 as the sum of two @xmath131 with @xmath133 , this implies that @xmath131 is fixed for @xmath136 . </S>",
    "<S> since the assumption is obviously true for @xmath137 , we indeed find that @xmath130 is fixed by ( [ rec])([initial ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the recurrences are illustrated in figure [ fig ] . </S>",

    "<S> all incoming arrows at a given node indicate which values of @xmath3 and @xmath125 are needed in the recursion relations . </S>",
    "<S> for example the nodes on the diagonal @xmath132 all follow from just the previous node on the diagonal as given by ( [ boundrec ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> all other points need two values of @xmath3 and @xmath125 as given by ( [ rec ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> = 5 cm    since the @xmath95-system ( [ mn ] ) corresponding to the right - hand side of ( [ lem ] ) does not depend on the variables @xmath125 and @xmath3 , @xmath127 is much easier to handle than @xmath126 . </S>",
    "<S> hence we proceed in reversed order .    </S>",
    "<S> so far , everything has been extremely simple . </S>",
    "<S> the proof that @xmath126 satisfies the recurrences ( [ rec ] ) and ( [ boundrec ] ) is however considerably more involved .    </S>",
    "<S> [ secapp ] we now show how theorem  [ thgd ] , and in particular corollary  [ corgd ] , can be exploited to obtain very general @xmath6-series identities , which take many of the known rogers  ramanujan type identities as special cases .    </S>",
    "<S> we substitute the conjugate bailey pair of corollary  [ corgd ] into equation  [ agbd ] and take the limit @xmath141 . </S>",
    "<S> this gives the important result    [ corinf ] let @xmath142 and @xmath98 be as in theorem  [ thgd ] , and let @xmath143 form a bailey pair relative to @xmath36 . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite , polynomial identites related to the characters of @xmath148 virasoro algebras give rise to bailey pairs . the name of the above lemma has been motivated by the fact that inserting these bailey pairs into ( [ eqinf ] ) yields rogers  ramanujan type identities for the branching functions of level-@xmath31 a@xmath40 conformal coset models . </S>",
