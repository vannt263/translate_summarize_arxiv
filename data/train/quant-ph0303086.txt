    "as is widely recognized , quantum mechanics and its generalizations , such as quantum field theory , is a highly successful theory .",
    "so far it has survived every experimental test . yet in spite of this , nagging problems remain .",
    "the problem of measurement is one .",
    "although the use of decoherence to solve the problem @xcite helps in that it explains the existence of the pointer basis in measuring apparatuses , questions still remain @xcite that are related to whether quantum mechanics is really a theory of open systems only or whether there is a system such as the universe that can be considered to be closed and isolated .",
    "this is the approach taken by the everett wheeler interpretation @xcite .",
    "there are other more fundamental questions such as , why space - time is 3 + 1 dimensional , why there are four fundamental forces with the observed strengths , what the reason is for the observed elementary particle mass spectrum , and why the big bang occurred .",
    "another basic question relates to why quantum mechanics is the correct physical theory .",
    "there are papers in the literature that address some of these questions by attempting to show that if things were different then life could not have evolved or some physical catastrophe would happen @xcite",
    ". however these are all heuristic after - the - fact types of arguments and do not constitute proofs .",
    "the possibility of constructing a theory to explain these things , as a `` theory of everything '' or toe represents a sought after goal of physics @xcite .",
    "another very basic problem concerns the relation between physics and mathematics .",
    "the view taken by most physicists is that the physical universe and the properties of physical systems exist independent of and a - priori to an observers use of experiments to construct a theory of the physical universe .",
    "in particular it is felt that the properties of physical systems are independent of the basic properties of how an observer acquires knowledge and constructs a physical theory of the universe .",
    "this view is expressed by such phrases as `` discovering the properties of nature '' and regarding physics as `` a voyage of discovery '' .",
    "a similar situation exists in mathematics .",
    "most mathematicians appear to implicitly accept the realist view .",
    "mathematical objects have an independent , a priori existence independent of an observers knowledge of them @xcite .",
    "progress in mathematics consists of discovering properties of these objects .",
    "this is perhaps the majority view , but it is not the only view .",
    "other concepts of existence include the formalist approach and various constructive approaches @xcite .",
    "these approaches will not be used here as they do not seem to take sufficient account of limitations imposed by physics .",
    "these include limitations resulting from the physical nature of language @xcite .",
    "this realist view of physics and mathematics has some problems .",
    "this is especially the case for the widely accepted position that physical systems exist in and determine properties of a space - time framework .",
    "however , mathematical objects exist outside of space - time and have nothing to do with space - time",
    ". if this is the case , then why should mathematics be relevant or useful at all to physics ?",
    "it is obvious that they are closely entwined as shown by extensive use of mathematics in theoretical physics , yet it is not clear how the two are related at a foundational level .",
    "this problem has been well known for a long time .",
    "it was expressed by wigner @xcite in a paper entitled _ the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences_. a related question is , why is physics so comprehensible ? @xcite .",
    "another foundational issue is based on the universal applicability of quantum mechanics .",
    "it follows that all systems , including experimental equipment , computers , and intelligent systems are quantum systems in different states .",
    "the macroscopic aspect of these systems does not change their quantum mechanical nature .",
    "it follows that the process of validation ( or refutation ) of any theory , including quantum mechanics , is a quantum dynamical process described by quantum dynamical evolution laws .",
    "one sees then that quantum mechanics must in some sense describe its own validation by quantum systems .",
    "however almost nothing is known so far about the details of such a description .",
    "these concerns form the background for this paper .",
    "this work begins with the observation that there is an aspect of physics that is faced daily by physicists , but is not included in physical or mathematical theories .",
    "this is the amount of physical resources , as space , time , momentum , and energy resources , required to carry out experiments and theoretical calculations . for experiments using large pieces of equipment and calculations requiring massive amounts of computing power",
    ", the resource requirements can be considerable .",
    "this use of resources is not discussed in a theoretical context because of a strong belief that the amount of resources needed to carry out experiments and make theoretical calculations on different types of systems has nothing to do with the contents of physical theories being created and verified by this process .",
    "the material facts of what is true physically and properties of the theories making predictions supported by experiment , are believed to have nothing to do with the space time and energy momentum resources needed to do the experiments and carry out the computations .",
    "extending this belief to a toe would mean that resource use by the knowledge acquisition process , whose goal is the construction of a coherent theory of mathematics and physics or toe , has nothing to to with the contents of the toe .",
    "the main purpose here is to take steps towards the possibility that this may not be correct , especially for foundational properties of physics and mathematics .",
    "included are questions regarding the strengths and existence of the four basic forces , why space - time is @xmath4 dimensional , the nature and reasons for the big bang and other general cosmological aspects , and why quantum mechanics is the correct physical theory .",
    "it should be strongly emphasized that the generally believed view of the independence between resource related aspects of carrying out experiments and calculations and the content of the theories created is true for the vast majority of physics and mathematics .",
    "there is ample evidence to support this view .",
    "probably the best evidence is that if it were not true , the dependence would have been discovered by now .",
    "however the fact that it is true for most systems and properties does not mean it is necessarily true for all . in particular , resource related aspects of doing experiments and calculations to create valid physical theories may influence the contents of the theories , at least at a very basic level .",
    "this work takes some initial steps to see if this possibility has merit .",
    "the approach taken is an extension of the general ideas presented in @xcite and @xcite and in references cited therein .",
    "the idea is to describe resource limited domains , theories and languages , each theory and domain is based on a limited amount of physical resources available to verify or refute the statements in the language .",
    "the relative strength of each theory depends on the amount of available resources .",
    "theories with more available resources are stronger than those with less .",
    "the next two sections give informal arguments that give some support to the possibility suggested here , that resource use may influence the basic contents of physical theories .",
    "the arguments are based on the relation between resource requirements and the size of the region or system being investigated .",
    "another relation discussed is that between the indirectness of the reality status of systems and their size @xcite .",
    "these arguments lead to a description of resource limited theories , languages , and domains .",
    "this is provided in the subsections of section [ rlt ] .",
    "included are a brief description of physical resources and a description of procedures , instructions , equipment , and purposes of equipment and procedures as components of the theory domains and languages .",
    "other components include symbols strings as outputs of measurements and computations , and the implementation operation .",
    "these components are used to give descriptions of agreement between theory and experiment , and of theorem proofs in the theories ( subsections [ age ] and [ ptt ] ) . also the minimum resources required to determine the truth value of statements about properties of systems are discussed .",
    "the final subsection gives details on the effect of resource limitations on language expressions .",
    "section [ pot ] describes the use of the partial ordering of the physical resources to partially order the resource limited theories .",
    "the following section describes briefly the dynamics of an observer using resources to acquire knowledge and develop physical and mathematical theories .",
    "the relation to the theories in the partial ordering is also noted .",
    "a characteristic of resource limited theories is that each theory includes parts of arithmetic and other theories . as such one expects gdel s incompleteness theorems @xcite to apply .",
    "it is assumed that the resource limitations do not affect the validity of these theorems .",
    "one concludes from the second theorem that none of the theories can prove their own consistency , and that the same incompleteness applies to any extension proving the consistency of the first theory .",
    "it is possible to iterate the extension process and push the effect of gdel s theorem from theories with less available resources to theories with more available resources .",
    "this is discussed in section [ lrp ] by the use of reflection principles @xcite that are based on validity . because of the resource limitations the reflection principles have to be applied separately to each individual sentence rather than to all sentences at once in a theory .",
    "limit and consistency aspects of a toe are discussed in section [ pactpm ] .",
    "the possibility that a coherent theory of physics and mathematics , or a toe is a common extension of all the theories is noted as is a problem that consistency poses for a toe .",
    "the final section summarizes the paper and points out the need for work on aspects not considered here .",
    "it must be emphasized that the goal of this paper is to describe some properties of resource limited theories , domains , and languages , and the motion of observers using resources to develop theories .",
    "as such this work is only a very small initial step in the approach to a coherent theory of physics and mathematics or a toe .",
    "the material presented here _ does not represent in any way _ a completed toe capable of verification or refutation . to achieve this",
    "many important aspects , not treated here , must be described .",
    "these include but are not limited to probability and information theory aspects , a much more detailed description of available physical resources including a description of resources _ within each theory _ , and specification of the axioms of the theories .",
    "also many of the well known physical theories , such as quantum mechanics , general relativity , and possibly string theory , would have to be included in some form .",
    "it is useful to begin by noting the relation between theories and the size of the systems and regions to which the theories apply . for regions",
    "whose size is of the order of the planck length , @xmath5 cm , string theory is used . for fermi sized regions , @xmath6 cm ,",
    "the strong interaction is dominant with qcd the appropriate theory . for larger regions",
    ", @xmath7 cm up to thousands of cm in size , electromagnetic interactions are dominant with qed the appropriate theory . finally for cosmological sized regions , up to @xmath8 cm in size , gravity is the dominant interaction with general relativity the appropriate theory .",
    "it is also well known that to investigate events in a region of size @xmath0 , probes with momentum @xmath9 and energy @xmath10 must be used .",
    "the latter follows from the fact that the characteristic time associated with a region of size @xmath0 is given by the time , @xmath11 , it takes light to cross the region . here",
    "@xmath12 is planck s constant divided by @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the velocity of light .",
    "this sets a lower limit on the energy momentum of a probe required to investigate events in regions of size @xmath0 .",
    "it is a significant restriction for small @xmath0 .",
    "what is , perhaps , not appreciated , but is well known by both theoretical and experimental physicists , is the fact that that there is another scale of physical resources associated with these regions of different sizes and their associated theories .",
    "these are the space time and energy momentum resources needed to carry out theoretical calculations and do experiments for the theories and their systems relevant to regions of size @xmath0 .",
    "the relationship between the size of the region investigated and the resources needed can be set out in general terms for both experiments and theory based computations . at present",
    "it appears impossible to do meaningful experiments and calculate the associated predicted outcomes for planck sized objects as one does not know what to do or even if such objects exist . because these objects are so small an extremely large or even infinite amount of resources are needed for such experiments and computations .",
    "to investigate fermi sized objects , large accelerators and large amounts of energy are needed to produce the particle beams and maintain the relevant magnetic fields .",
    "computations are resource intensive because the strong interaction makes a perturbation approach to qcd computations infeasible .",
    "the resources needed are large , but finite .",
    "less resources are needed for relevant calculations and experiments on atomic and larger systems",
    ". however more resources , in terms of very large telescopes , on and near earth , and long viewing times with very sensitive detectors , are needed to investigate cosmological sized objects , especially those that are very far away .",
    "the relations between resources needed and the size of the region investigated is shown schematically in figure 1 .",
    "the ordinate shows a characteristic size parameter of the object being investigated .",
    "the upper limit shows the present age of the universe in cm and the lower limit is the planck length in cm .",
    "the first abcissa label , resource use , denotes the amount of resources required to carry out theoretical predictions and to do experiments on the object being investigated .",
    "the amounts increase from left to right as shown by the arrow .",
    "values are not given because it is at present an open question how to quantify the resources required .",
    "also for this paper there is no need to quantify the resources .",
    "the curve is a freehand or arbitrary schematic representation of the dependence of the resources required to carry out experiments and theoretical calculations on the characteristic size of the object being investigated .",
    "the arbitrariness , or lack of knowledge of curve details , is denoted by the dashes in the curve . in spite of this a curve , such as that in fig .",
    "[ size ] , is useful to represent some properties of the dependence that one does know .",
    "this is that the curve has two branches and that each branch must approach a limit . here",
    "these limits are taken to be the planck length and @xmath14 times the age of the universe .",
    "if one feels these limits are two restrictive they may be changed .",
    "the important point is that there seem to be such limits .",
    "the presence and location of the minimum represents systems whose size , real or perceived , is such that we can directly observe them .",
    "many of these objects can be directly examined and handled to determine directly observable properties .",
    "no experiments or theory is required as the properties can be determined directly by our senses .",
    "included are such properties as `` this rock is heavy , hard , and brown'',``the horizon looks flat '' , `` the sun is hot , bright , and moves through the sky '' .",
    "the size of the sun is not the actual size but is the size perceived by us , which is a few cm .",
    "these directly perceived properties belong in the region of minimal resources required because they are direct and uninterpreted .",
    "no theory or experiment is used to explain why anything happens or what its physical properties are .",
    "the resource location of the minimum of the curve is arbitrary .",
    "it is not set at @xmath15 resources to allow freedom in the choice of how resources are quantified .",
    "the ordinate location of the minimum represents sizes of objects that can be directly observed or perceived .",
    "it is a broad minimum ranging over sizes of the order of 1 cm to 100 cm . to reflect this",
    "the minimum is arbitrarily set at 10 cm .",
    "the size range of the minimum is also representative of our size .",
    "the reason is that our size is of the order of the ( real or perceived ) sizes of all systems that we can directly experience .",
    "there is another quite different aspect of theories , theoretical calculations , and supporting or refuting experiments that is relevant to figure 1 .",
    "this is the indirectness of the reality status as a function of the size of physical systems @xcite .    to see this",
    "one notes that the validity of an experimental test of a theoretical prediction depends on the fact that each piece of equipment used in the experiment is properly functioning .",
    "but the proper functioning of each piece of equipment depends in turn on other supporting theory and experiments which in turn @xmath16 . as an example suppose an experiment to test the validity of a theory at some point uses two pieces of equipment , @xmath17 .",
    "the validity of this experiment as a test depends on the proper functioning of @xmath18 and @xmath19",
    ". however , the proper functioning of @xmath18 also depends on some theory which may or may not be the same as the one being tested , and also on some other experiments each of which depend on other pieces of equipment for their validity .",
    "this argument then applies also to the experiments used to validate the theory on which the proper functioning of @xmath18 is based .",
    "similar statements can be made for the proper functioning of @xmath19 .",
    "basic examples of such equipment are those that measure time and distance . the truth of the assertion that a specific system , called a clock , measures time depends on the theory and experiments needed to describe the functions of the clock components and the proper functioning of the clock components .",
    "the conclusion that a particular piece of equipment measures time depends on the conclusions that each component of the equipment functions properly .",
    "similar arguments can be made for distance measuring equipment and equipment for measuring other physical parameters .",
    "computations made to generate theoretical predictions have the same property .",
    "a computation is a sequence of different steps each performed by one or more pieces of equipment such as a computer . here",
    "the proper functioning of the computer depends on theory , which may or may not be the same as the one for which the computation is made , and on experiments that support the theory needed to assert that the computer does what it is supposed to do .",
    "these arguments show that the validity of an experiment or theoretical computation depends on a downward descending network of theories , computations , and experiments .",
    "the descent terminates at the level of the direct , elementary observations that were discussed before .",
    "as was noted these require no theory or experiment as they are uninterpreted .",
    "the indirectness of the reality status of systems and their properties is measured by the depth of descent between the property statement of interest and the direct elementary , uninterpreted observations of an observer .",
    "this can be described approximately as the number of layers of theory and experiment between the statement of interest and elementary observations .",
    "the dependence on size arises because the descent depth , or number of intervening layers , is larger for very small and very large systems than it is for moderate sized systems .",
    "this line of argument gives additional support to the basic nature of the direct elementary observations perceived by an intelligent system .",
    "it is also shown by the curve in figure 1 with the second abcissa label as a measure of the indirectness of the reality status of different sized objects .",
    "the indirectness can be roughly represented by the number of layers of theory and experiment between elementary observations and the theory calculations and experiments that are relevant for the object being investigated .",
    "the relation between the two abcissas suggests that resource use can be included by considering resource limited theories , domains , and languages and their relation to observers use of resources to develop theories .",
    "initial steps in this direction are carried out in the following sections .",
    "before describing resource limited theories , domains , and languages , it is useful to give a brief description of physical resources .      here physical resources are considered to consist of space , time , momentum , and energy . if space and time is @xmath20 dimensional , then the amount , @xmath0 , of resources available is a @xmath21 dimensional parameter @xmath22 .",
    "each of the parameters can be taken to be continuously varying or it can be considered to be discrete .",
    "be a @xmath20 dimensional vector @xmath23 where each @xmath24 denotes the available number of phase space cells for the @xmath25 dimension , and @xmath26 is the number of space dimensions .",
    "the number of phase space cells of unit volume @xmath27 associated with @xmath0 is given by @xmath28 . here",
    "@xmath12 is planck s constant divided by @xmath13 .",
    "however this will not be done here . ]",
    "since the concerns of this paper are independent of which choice is made , the choice of a discrete or continuous @xmath0 will be left to future work .",
    "each parameter , @xmath24 , of the @xmath21 parameter description of @xmath0 is a number indicating the amount of the @xmath25 resource available .",
    "the @xmath26 space parameters @xmath29}= \\{r_{1},\\cdots , r_{d}\\}$ ] and one time parameter @xmath30 give the amount of space and time available . similarly the @xmath26 momentum parameters @xmath31 and energy parameter @xmath32 give the amount of momentum and energy available .",
    "here it is also useful to consider a resource space whose elements are the @xmath21 dimensional @xmath0 .",
    "the space has a partial ordering given by that defined for the resources .",
    "that is @xmath33 if @xmath34 for all @xmath35 .",
    "this space represents a background for description of the resource limited theories and motion of observers developing theories .",
    "this description is sufficient for this paper even though it is quite superficial and brief .",
    "additional details , including quantification and other aspects , are left to future work .",
    "let @xmath36 be a theory , domain , and language associated with each value of @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath3 is the language used by @xmath2 and @xmath1 is the domain or universe of discourse for @xmath2 . here",
    "@xmath0 is the maximum amount of space , time , momentum , and energy resources available to @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath1 .",
    "this puts limitations on the @xmath37 .",
    "a domain @xmath1 is limited by the requirement that at most @xmath0 resources are needed to determine the truth value of any statement @xmath38 in @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath39 be the resources needed to determine the truth value of @xmath38 , i.e. to verify or refute @xmath38 . if @xmath38 is in the domain @xmath1 , then @xmath40 if more than @xmath0 resources are needed to verify or refute @xmath38 , then @xmath38 is not in @xmath1 .    the statements @xmath38 can be quite general .",
    "included are statements about properties of procedures , instructions , equipment , computers , and many other physical and mathematical objects .",
    "since @xmath38 often includes statements about procedures used to determine properties or systems , there can be many statements @xmath38 for a given system and property , each based on a different procedure and with a different value of @xmath39 .",
    "similarly properties can be quite general . included are properties related to experimental tests of theories , purposes of procedures and instructions , existence of systems , etc .. the main point is that @xmath1 is limited to those @xmath38 that satisfy eq . [ reslim ] .    here",
    "the value of @xmath39 is considered relative to the basic uninterpreted directly perceived properties .",
    "any resource value associated with these properties is the zero point .",
    "thus for each @xmath38 @xmath39 includes the resources needed to construct all the equipment needed to verify or refute @xmath38 .",
    "note that @xmath1 is closed under negation as @xmath41 ( @xmath42 means not ) .",
    "however @xmath1 is not closed under conjunction or disjunction . for conjunctions",
    "this follows from @xmath43 one sees from this that it is possible that @xmath38 and @xmath44 are such that @xmath45 and @xmath46 but @xmath47 in this case @xmath38 and @xmath44 are in @xmath1 but @xmath48 is not .",
    "note too that @xmath49 occurs if procedures for determining the truth values of @xmath38 and @xmath44 use some of the same equipment .",
    "also @xmath50 should be such as to avoid double counting of resources used to construct equipment used in both procedures .",
    "the same arguments hold for disjunctions as @xmath51    the theories @xmath2 are limited by the requirement that proofs of all theorems of @xmath2 require at most @xmath0 resources to implement .",
    "thus @xmath38 is a theorem of @xmath2 if a proof of @xmath38 can be done using at most @xmath0 resources .",
    "if @xmath38 requires more than @xmath0 resources to prove , then @xmath38 is not a theorem of @xmath2 .",
    "this limitation follows directly from the physical nature of language @xcite .",
    "if the physical representation of expressions of @xmath3 corresponds to states of systems in @xmath1 , which is the case assumed here , then the representation corresponds to a gdel map of the expressions into system states in @xmath1 . in this case",
    "the provability of a statement corresponds to a statement about properties of systems that are in @xmath1 . as such",
    ", the proof statements are subject to the limitations of eq .",
    "[ reslim ] .",
    "another limitation on @xmath2 is that ( assuming consistency ) all theorems of @xmath2 must be true in @xmath1 .",
    "it follows from this and the first limitation that no statement can be a theorem of a consistent @xmath2 if it is false in @xmath1 , requires more than @xmath0 resources to verify , or more than @xmath0 resources to prove .",
    "the language @xmath3 must satisfy a limitation based on the physical nature of language .",
    "all expressions @xmath52 in @xmath3 as strings of symbols are limited by the requirement that they need at most @xmath0 resources to create , display , and maintain .",
    "this includes symbol strings , as strings of numerical digits ( i.e. as names of numbers ) , which are used in all computations , quantum or classical , as outputs of measurements , and as instructions or programs for experimental or computation procedures .",
    "it is possible that there are expressions in @xmath3 which are sentences but have no interpretation as statements in @xmath1 because the interpretation does not satisfy eq .",
    "[ reslim ] .    in this paper",
    "some major simplifying assumptions are made .",
    "one is that there is no discussion about how the resources and the limitations are described within the statements of @xmath2 .",
    "all resource discussions here are assumed to take place in the metatheory of the theories @xmath2 .",
    "this puts off to future work removal of this assumption , which is clearly necessary .",
    "another assumption is that probabilistic and information theoretic aspects are not included here .",
    "it is clear that this assumption must be removed if quantum mechanics is to be included in any detail .",
    "this is especially the case if the universal applicability of quantum mechanics is taken into account .",
    "a third assumption is that one specific physical representation of the symbols and expressions of @xmath3 is assumed .",
    "specific details are not given here as an abstract representation is sufficient .",
    "it is clear , though , that there are many different physical representations of expressions , each with their own resource characteristics .",
    "included in the domains of the theories are processes or procedures , instruction strings , equipment , and statements about the function or purposes of procedures or equipment , and other physical and mathematical systems . associated with a process or procedure",
    "@xmath53 is a set of instructions @xmath54 ( as a symbol string ) for using several pieces of equipment . here",
    "@xmath55 denotes the equipment used by @xmath53 .",
    "@xmath54 may also include instructions for assembling the equipment in @xmath56 in specified locations and instructions on when to use it . in this case @xmath56",

    "@xmath62 can be as simple as clocks and measuring rods or as complex and massive and large as telescopes and particle accelerators .",
    "of course , larger more complex equipment requires more resources to assemble , use , and maintain than does smaller , less complex equipment .",
    "it is important here to clearly separate _",
    "purposes _ of both procedures @xmath53 and equipment @xmath62 from _ use _ of @xmath53 and @xmath62 .",

    "this was done both for illustrative purposes and as an aid to the reader .",
    "a proper description of @xmath54 would include instructions for how to use @xmath57 without saying anything about what @xmath57 is used for ( space measurement ) .",

    "as the above suggests there is much to do .",
    "probably the most important need is to extend the theories to include probability and information theory concepts .",
    "it is expected that this will be important relative to observers spending resources to acquire knowledge and move towards a limit theory .",
    "another basic need is to develop the description of the theories @xmath2 so that they describe the use of resources and the effects of limited availability of resources .",
