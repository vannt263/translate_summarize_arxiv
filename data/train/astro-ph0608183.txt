    "with the discovery of the cosmological nature of @xmath0-ray bursts ( grbs ) in 1997 @xcite , astronomers were suddenly forced to explain the enormous isotropic energy release of these distant explosions .",
    "some of the most energetic events , such as grb990123 , seemingly released enough energy in the prompt @xmath0-rays ( @xmath4 ergs ; @xcite ) to rival the rest mass of a neutron star .",
    "furthermore , broadband modeling of the best sampled events has shown that a comparable amount of energy remains in the shock , powering the long - lived x - ray , optical , and radio afterglow ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the hypothesis that grbs are a - spherical explosions @xcite , supported by the appearance of achromatic `` jet '' breaks in a large number of afterglow light curves @xcite , proved to be a turning point . with typical opening angles of a few degrees ,",
    "the true energy release from most grbs is @xmath5 ergs , on par with that of a supernova ( sn ) .",
    "this realization enabled the discovery of a standard energy reservoir for the collimation - corrected prompt energy @xcite and kinetic energy of the afterglow @xcite .",
    "grbs are now considered promising standard candle candidates , with the hope of hubble diagrams out to @xmath6 offering complementary constraints to type ia sne on the cosmology of our universe ( @xcite ; c.f .",
    ".    launched in november 2004 , the _ swift _  gamma - ray burst explorer @xcite was designed to position grbs , disseminate accurate coordinates to ground - based observatories in real - time , and follow the uv and x - ray afterglows from minutes to days after the event . in only a year of full operation , _ swift _  has brought about a number of fundamental advances in the grb field , including the discovery of the first x - ray ( grb050509b ; @xcite ) and near - infrared ( grb050724 ; @xcite ) afterglows of a short - hard burst , the detection of the high - redshift ( @xmath7 ) grb050904 @xcite , and the ability to measure broadband light curves starting shortly after , and in a few cases even during the @xmath0-ray event itself .    despite these advances , measuring the bolometric fluences of _ swift _  events",
    "has proved challenging , for a number of reasons .",
    "first , the limited energy range of the _ swift _  burst alert telescope ( bat ; @xcite ) means that _ swift _  can accurately characterize only the softest grb spectra .",
    "second , few _ swift _  events have shown conclusive signs of a jet break , leaving geometric corrections highly uncertain .",
    "finally , the x - ray light curves of _ swift _  afterglows have shown both bright flares @xcite and slow decays @xcite . both behaviors have been attributed to late - time ( @xmath8 ) energy injection , and at times have rivaled the energy release of the prompt @xmath0-ray emission ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "on 20 august 2005 ut , the bat detected and localized the unusually bright and long grb050820a , a truly rare burst in the _ swift _  sample .",
    "the @xmath0-ray light curve is marked by a soft pulse of emission preceding the main event by over 200 s. the main emission was bright enough to be detected by the _ konus - wind _  instrument , providing a @xmath0-ray spectrum extending beyond 1 mev as well as continuous coverage over the entire @xmath9 600 s burst duration .",
    "since _ swift _  triggered on the precursor , both space- and ground - based facilities were able to image the transient during the bulk of the prompt emission .",
    "such contemporaneous multi - wavelength observations have only been achieved for a handful of bursts to date .",
    "the bright x - ray ( @xmath10 mjy ) and optical ( @xmath11 mag ) afterglows made it possible to study the evolution of the afterglow for weeks after the burst , providing one of the most detailed broadband light curves in the _ swift _  era",
    ". finally , late - time _ hubble space telescope _",
    "observations allowed us to constrain the jet - break time , and hence the geometry of the outflow . even after applying the collimation correction",
    ", we find grb050820a is an exceptionally energetic event .    our work proceeds as follows : in  [ sec : obs ] , we outline our broadband observations of the grb050820a , beginning with the high - energy prompt emission and followed by the x - ray , optical , and radio afterglow .",
    "we find the afterglow data are incompatible with the standard model of synchrotron radiation from a single , highly - relativistic shock expanding adiabatically into the surrounding medium @xcite .",
    "instead in  [ sec : anal ] we use power - law fits ( @xmath12 ) to model the afterglow , dividing the burst into segments based on noticeable temporal breaks in the x - ray and optical light curves .",
    "this analysis allows us to investigate the early broadband light curve (  [ sec : pre ] and [ sec : early ] ) , late - time ( @xmath13 ) energy injection in the forward shock (  [ sec : inject ] ) , the structure of the circum - burst medium (  [ sec : cbm ] ) , and the geometry and energetics of the event (  [ sec : energy ] ) .    throughout this work",
    "we adopt a standard cosmology with @xmath14 km s@xmath15 mpc@xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 .",
    "we also make use of the notation @xmath18 .",
    "in this section , we present our broadband observations of grb050820a , which span the spectral range from @xmath0-rays to radio frequencies and extend in time out to 61 days after the burst .",
    "we include an independent analysis of the _ swift _  bat data set , as well as the complete light curve and spectrum from the _ konus - wind _  instrument @xcite , which , unlike the bat , was able to observe grb050820a over its entire duration (  [ sec : gamma ] ) . in  [ sec : xray ] we provide an analysis of the _ swift _  x - ray telescope ( xrt ; @xcite ) data , with afterglow detections out to two weeks after the event .",
    "we present contemporaneous optical data from the automated palomar 60-inch telescope ( p60 ; cenko et al .",
    "2006 , in preparation ) and the _ swift _  ultra - violet optical telescope ( uvot ; @xcite ) , supplemented by late - time images taken with the 9.2-m _ hobby - eberly telescope _  ( het ) and the _ hubble space telescope _  ( hst ) (  [ sec : opt ] ) . finally , we monitored grb050820a in the radio with the very large array beginning only hours after the burst and continuing for approximately two months (  [ sec : radio ] ) .        at 06:34:53 on 20 august 2005 ut , for it is assumed to coincide with the beginning of the prompt emission .",

    "@xcite describe a multi - peaked light curve ( @xmath23 s ) with clear spectral evolution ( hard - to - soft ) within each peak .",
    "following the report of additional high - energy emission from the _ konus - wind _  instrument ( @xcite ; see  [ sec : kw ] ) , the bat team re - analyzed their full light curve and found evidence of a much stronger , harder episode of emission from grb050820a @xcite .",
    "unfortunately the satellite entered the south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) approximately 240 seconds after the burst trigger , and thus estimates of the properties of this second phase are highly uncertain .",
    "here we have independently analyzed the bat data from grb050820a .",

    "grbs , however , are thought to be beamed events . at early times , observers only notice emission from a narrow cone ( opening angle @xmath215 , where @xmath216 is the lorentz factor of the expanding shock ) due to relativistic beaming ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "as the shock slows , however , lateral spreading of the jet becomes important , and the observer eventually notices `` missing '' emission from wider angles @xcite .",

    "furthermore , it is difficult to conceive of a scenario by which internal shocks can generate such long periods of quiescence in a sustained outflow .",
    "the large time lag , soft nature , and repeated occurrence of these precursors hint that they are in fact due to a different emission mechanism than the internal dissipation thought to power the bulk of the high - energy emission .",
    "however , we can not state this conclusively , as would be the case if the precursors were thermal .",
    "if we assume a different emission mechanism , the prompt emission did not begin until 222 s after the _ swift _  trigger . this seemingly small discrepancy in defining @xmath19 affects the calculated temporal decay indices , particularly during the early afterglow (  [ sec : cbm ] ) .",

    "finally , we consider the early x - ray emission .",
    "the temporal decay slope at early times ( @xmath222 ) is too steep to be attributed to a standard forward shock afterglow .",
    "the most popular explanation for the rapid decline of early x - ray emission in _ swift _  grbs is `` high - latitude emission '' : prompt emission from large angles ( @xmath223 ) that , due to relativistic beaming effects , reaches the observer at late times ( @xmath224 , @xcite ) .",

    "however , we find no evidence for a jet break in the optical or x - ray light curves out to at least 17 days after the burst ( see  [ sec : energy ] ) .",
    "another possibility , invoked to explain the relatively low late - time radio flux from grb050904 , is a high ambient density @xcite . in the case of grb050904 , it was argued that the large density raised the self - absorption frequency , @xmath204 , above the radio observing bands .",
    "this greatly suppresses the radio flux , for the spectrum in this regime is proportional to @xmath307 ( eqn .",
    "[ eqn : nu1a ] ) .",
    "there is no evidence in the radio data for an optically thick spectrum , although spectral data is sparse at late times .",
    "furthermore , broadband modeling of this event (  [ sec : energy ] ) rules out a high ambient density for typical values of the micro - physical parameters @xmath308 and @xmath309 .",
    "we therefore consider this explanation unlikely .    alternatively ,",
    "a natural explanation for the low radio flux at late times is a wind - like medium . in a wind - like medium ,",
    "the forward shock peak flux density declines in time as @xmath310 .",
    "the decreasing peak flux counteracts the rising synchrotron emission , suppressing any late - time radio data .",
    "this is of course inconsistent with our x - ray and optical data , which strongly favor a constant - density medium .",
    "one can imagine a scenario in which the environment near the burst ( the regime sampled predominantly by the x - ray and optical data ) is approximately constant in density , while the outer regions ( sampled by the radio at later times ) have a wind - like profile .",
    "however , without a physical justification for such a density profile , this remains little more than speculation .",
    "the lack of a bright radio afterglow remains a puzzling aspect of grb050820a .",
    "using the high - energy fluence derived from _ konus - wind _  satellite (  [ sec : kw ] ) , we calculate the total isotropic energy release in the prompt emission was @xmath311 ergs ( assuming a redshift of @xmath312 ; @xcite ) .",
    "this makes grb050820a one of the most energetic events ( in terms of @xmath313 ) for which a redshift has been measured @xcite .",
    "however , only a fraction of the explosion energy is converted into prompt emission via internal dissipation .",
    "the rest remains in the kinetic energy of the outflow , powering the forward shock and hence the afterglow .",
    "we can estimate the kinetic energy of the afterglow ( @xmath314 ) by examining the the x - ray emission at @xmath315 hr @xcite . at this point ,",
    "the x - rays should be above the cooling frequency .",
    "the flux density is then independent of ambient density and only weakly dependent on @xmath203 .",
    "a joint fit of the phase 3 optical and x - ray data ( after the energy injection has stopped and the system has returned to adiabatic expansion ) constrains the electron energy index : @xmath316 . if we take typical values for @xmath202 ( @xmath317 ) and @xmath203 ( @xmath318 ) @xcite , we find that @xmath319 .    for an accurate accounting of the total energy emitted by this event ,",
    "however , we must determine the degree of collimation of the emission .",
    "we therefore examine all the temporal breaks in the optical and x - ray light curves to determine which one ( if any ) shows an achromatic steepening to the @xmath217 decay expected from a jet @xcite .",
    "the only plausible candidate is the transition from phase 3 to 4 in the optical light curve .",
    "the steepening here is achromatic ( i.e.  it is seen in all three _ hubble space telescope _  filters ) and much too large to be explained solely by the cooling frequency passing through the optical bands ( although this may have occured as well ) .",
    "any contribution from an underlying host galaxy would only further steepen the decay in phase 4 .    with only one observation ,",
    "it is impossible to constrain the post - break decay index .",
    "instead , we assume the post - break decay has a power - law index @xmath320 ( see above ) .",
    "we then find @xmath321 d. this result is consistent with our x - ray observations , which put a lower limit on the jet break time of @xmath322 d.    we note that the jet break time we have inferred for grb050820a is extremely large . in the host galaxy reference frame",
    ", the break occurs at @xmath323 , a factor of three larger than any jet break seen in the pre-_swift _  era @xcite . in this respect , too , grb050820a is a strong outlier .    to convert the jet break times to a range of opening angles",
    ", we use the relation @xcite : @xmath324 here @xmath325 is the fraction of the total energy converted to prompt @xmath0-ray emission .",
    "the only remaining unknown in equation [ eqn : thetatj ] is the ambient density , @xmath326 . using the ratio of the x - ray and optical data , as well as the canonical values of @xmath308 and @xmath309 , we find the density of the burst must be low : @xmath327 @xmath328 .",
    "afterglow modeling of the late - time optical and x - ray data ( phase 3 , after any continued energy injection has ceased and the shock expands adiabatically ) using the technique of @xcite confirms this result : @xmath329 .    combining the above results , we find the opening angle is constrained to fall between between 6.8@xmath330 , corresponding to a beaming factor @xmath331 . while the opening angle is large for a long - soft burst , there are several comparable events in the pre-_swift",
    "_  sample @xcite .",
    "the total collimation - corrected energy emitted in @xmath0-rays ( @xmath332 ) from grb050820a is therefore @xmath333 ergs .",
    "the corresponding value for the blast - wave energy ( @xmath334 ) is @xmath335 ergs .",
    "@xcite have demonstrated an empirical relation between @xmath332 and the peak energy of the prompt emission spectrum in the grb rest frame ( @xmath336 ) .",
    "grb050820a is more energetic than any of the 37 bursts considered in their sample ( in terms of @xmath332 ) , and therefore proves an interesting test case for the so - called ghirlanda relation .",
    "using our calculated value of @xmath332 , ghirlanda predicts @xmath337 mev .",
    "this is marginally consistent with the actual value of @xmath338 mev derived from the _ konus - wind _  dataset .    in figure",
    "[ fig : energy ] , we plot a histogram of @xmath332 and @xmath334 for the @xmath9 15 long - soft cosmological bursts for which both quantities have been derived .",
    "we have not included the most nearby events ( grb980425 , grb031203 , and grb060218 ) in our analysis , as these events released significantly less energy than the typical cosmological grb @xcite .",
    "@xcite have shown that , with the exception of the most nearby events , the sum of @xmath332 and @xmath334 is clustered around @xmath339 ergs .",
    "grb050820a is clearly an over - energetic exception , an order of magnitude more energetic than this sample .",
    "in fact , it would require the direct conversion of @xmath340 m@xmath341 ( with 100% efficiency ) to release this much energy .    finally , it is important to consider how robust our estimates of @xmath314 , @xmath342 , and @xmath326 are given that the standard afterglow model fails to explain the broadband behavior of grb050820a .",
    "we note that the opening angle is relatively insensitive to both variables ( eqn .",
    "[ eqn : thetatj ] ) ; factors of order unity will be greatly reduced by the @xmath343 exponent .",
    "it is difficult to conceive of a long - soft grb environment where the ambient density is less than @xmath344 , and high densities would only increase the opening angle and thus the energy release .",
    "grb050820a joins a select sample of events with simultaneous observations in the @xmath0-ray and optical bands , and an even smaller group with contemporaneous x - ray observations as well .",
    "such events have led to fundamental advances in our understanding of grbs , including the discovery of a reverse - shock optical flash from grb990123 @xcite and possibly from grb050904 @xcite .",
    "the early - time optical emission from grb041219a also showed a bright optical flash , but the rise was correlated with an accompanying peak of @xmath0-ray emission , suggesting a common origin for the two components @xcite .",
    "the early behavior of grb050820a is unlike either of these events . @xcite",
    "have shown the contemporaneous optical emission is well described as the sum of two components : one proportional to the prompt @xmath0-ray emission and one smoothly varying forward shock term . while the @xmath0-ray component is important for @xmath345 s , the optical peak at @xmath181 s is dominated by emission from the external shock region . furthermore , the post - peak decay rate is inconsistent with reverse - shock emission .",
    "instead we interpret this as the forward shock peak frequency passing through the optical bands .",
    "this is not unlike what was seen in the optical for grb060124 @xcite , although the time resolution in the prompt phase was much poorer than for this burst .",
    "the contemporaneous optical light curves of grb050319 @xcite and grb050401 @xcite did not show this peak phase , but extrapolations to late - times were consistent with the adiabatic expansion of a forward shock .",
    "another different behavior was seen in the early optical light curve of grb050801 , which showed an extended plateau phase correlated with the x - ray emission , hinting at continued energy injection from a central engine refreshing the external shocks @xcite .",
    "the contemporaneous x - ray emission , on the other hand , is the low - energy tail of the prompt emission .",
    "this behavior was also seen for grb060124 @xcite and has been hinted at in the rapid decline in early x - ray light curves attributed to high - latitude emission @xcite , as well as the bright x - ray flares seen in many xrt light curves @xcite .",
    "it is clear then , that , in marked contrast to the x - ray emission , contemporaneous optical emission exhibits a large diversity in behavior .",
    "unfortunately the physical mechanism behind this diversity remains to be explained .",
    "the issue of burst geometry is a particularly interesting one in the _ swift _   era .",
    "the steep post - break decay slope , seen simultaneously in multiple filters , makes grb050820a one of the most convincing examples of a beamed event in the _ swift _  sample .",
    "the x - ray afterglow , however , is too faint at late times to provide broadband confirmation .",
    "in fact , very few _ swift _  bursts , including those , like grb050408 @xcite , that have been followed for months , show signs of a jet break in the xrt light curve @xcite .",
    "typical jet breaks in pre-_swift _",
    "bursts occurred on time - scales of several days @xcite .",
    "@xcite predicted that _ swift _  would detect bursts with wider opening angles than previous missions due to the increased sensitivity of the bat .",
    "however , not a single _ swift _  afterglow has shown a convincing jet - break - like transition in multiple band - passes ( candidates include grb050525a and grb050801 ; see @xcite and references therein for a more thorough discussion ) . while it may be that most jet breaks , like grb050820a , occur at late times , beyond the sensitivity of the xrt and most ground - based facilities , this is nonetheless troubling . on the one hand , few if any x - ray jet breaks were seen in pre-_swift _",
    "bursts ; all collimation angles were determined from optical ( and sometimes radio ) light curves .",
    "conversely , given the large number of well - sampled xrt light curves , and the fact that such fundamental results for grb cosmology as the ghirlanda relation rest on our picture of grbs as a - spherical events , this is clearly a matter that merits further investigation .",
    "one consequence of the large opening angle associated with grb050820a is a correspondingly large burst and afterglow energy .",
    "in fact , of all the bursts compiled in the @xcite sample , grb050820a has the largest prompt energy release . and unlike grb990123 @xcite",
    ", this large @xmath0-ray energy was accompanied by a correspondingly large kinetic energy imparted to the afterglow .",
    "the only comparable event for which such energies could be determined was the high - redshift grb050904 , which released a total energy of @xmath346 ergs @xcite . given the large @xmath0-ray fluence , similar events should have been easily detected by both _ swift _  and previous grb missions . and given the bright optical afterglow and the late jet - break , such events are strongly favored for ground - based follow - up ( i.e.  redshift determination ) .",
    "the lack of a large sample of such events means they must be relatively rare in the universe .    like many other _ swift _",
    "grbs , the x - ray light curve of grb050820a exhibits a phase of shallow decay incompatible with the standard forward shock model @xcite .",
    "grb050820a is relatively unique , however , in that this epoch is also well - sampled in the optical .",
    "the seemingly simultaneous breaks in the optical light curve bolster the commonly - held belief that this phase is caused by some form of refreshed shocks @xcite .",
    "coupled with the large gap between the precursor and the bulk of the prompt emission , the late - time energy injection poses fundamental challenges to any central engine model .    finally , we return to the question of the radio afterglow .",
    "radio observations typically probe low - lorentz factor ejecta ( @xmath347 ) at large distances from the central engine ( @xmath348 cm ) . the forward shock peak frequency reaches the radio much later than the optical or x - ray bands .",
    "thus , radio emission is usually visible at later times than optical or x - ray emission , and is well - suited to study afterglows when the emission is isotropic ( i.e.  after the jet break ) or even in some cases when the ejecta has slowed to newtonian expansion @xcite . for this reason",
    ", late - time radio observations are considered the most accurate method for model - independent calorimetry .",
    "for grb050820a , this paradigm has broken down .",
    "the burst had a bright optical and x - ray afterglow , but weak emission in the radio .",
    "it is hoped that further studies of such energetic grbs in the _ swift _  era will help to elucidate some of these puzzles .                                                                                                                                                                                                                ,",

    "<S> the large time lag between the precursor and the main emission enabled simultaneous observations in the @xmath0-ray , x - ray , and optical band - passes , something only achieved for a handful of events to date . while the contemporaneous x - rays are the low - energy tail of the prompt emission , the optical does not directly track the @xmath0-ray flux . </S>",
    "<S> instead , the early - time optical data appear mostly consistent with the forward shock synchrotron peak passing through the optical , and are therefore likely the beginning of the afterglow . on hour time scales after the burst , the x - ray and optical light curves are inconsistent with an adiabatic expansion of the shock into the surrounding region , but rather indicate that there is a period of energy injection . </S>",
    "<S> observations at late times allow us to constrain the collimation angle of the relativistic outflow to @xmath1 . </S>",
