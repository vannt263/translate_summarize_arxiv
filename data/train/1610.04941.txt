    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are close binary systems which are composed of a white dwarf ( wd ) primary and a roche - lobe - filling secondary .",
    "the transfered mass from the secondary forms an accretion disk around the primary .",
    "dne are a subclass of cvs characterized by a sudden brightening of the disk , called outburst .",
    "outbursts are thought to be caused by thermal instability of disk ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "su uma - type dwarf novae ( dne ) show not only normal outbursts but also superoutbursts which are caused by thermal - tidal instability @xcite . in superoutbursts , superhumps can be observed which have a small amplitude of 0.10.5 mag with a period a few percent longer than @xmath1 .",
    "superhumps are considered to be a result of the 3:1 resonance of accretion disks which makes disks elliptical @xcite . according to @xcite , ordinary superhumps are classified to three stages by how the period changes :",
    "stage a , stage b , and stage c ( see figure [ fig : shtemplate ] on the classification of superhumps ) .",
    "the stage a superhumps are thought to represent the growing phase of the 3:1 resonance , and their period is considered to reflect the disk precession rate at the 3:1 resonance radius .",
    "the period of stage b superhumps is shorter because of pressure effects in the disk , and the origin of stage c superhumps is unclear ( for more detail , see @xcite ) .",
    "wz sge - type dne are a subclass of su uma - type dne which shows few normal outbursts and , compared with su uma - type dne , have especially rare outbursts and short orbital periods .",
    "wz sge - type dne feature double - peak variations in their light curves , called early superhumps , which are observed in the initial term of superoutbursts .",
    "it is believed that the period of early superhumps corresponds reasonably well with the orbital period @xcite .",
    "they also exhibit multiple rebrightenings after the main superoutburst ( see @xcite for review ) .",
    "the reason why early superhumps are observed in wz sge - type dne is that the binaries have extremely small mass ratios @xmath0 , so the disks can spread to the 2:1 resonance radius @xcite . once the 2:1 resonance is excited , two - armed dissipation patterns",
    "appear near the 2:1 resonance radius , and we see the geometrical superposition of two light sources .",
    "this is how early superhumps are observed with double - peaked profiles ( cf .",
    "the 2:1 resonance is thought to suppress the growth of the 3:1 resonance @xcite .",
    "hence , after the 2:1 resonance becomes weak , the 3:1 resonance becomes excited and ordinary superhumps grow .",
    "there are several cases when rebrightenings occur after main superoutbursts .",
    "the rebrightenings are grouped into five types : only one long duration rebrightening ( type a ) , multiple rebrightenings ( type b ) , only one short duration rebrightening ( type c ) , no rebrightenings ( type d ) , and double superoutburst ( type e ) @xcite .",
    "the rebrightening types appears to reflect the evolutionary phase , and the order of the evolution seems to be type c@xmath5d@xmath5a@xmath5b@xmath5e as @xcite suggested .",
    "according to the evolutionary theory of cvs , a binary separation become shorter mainly by magnetic braking in initial stage ( orbital period @xmath6 3 hrs ) , and by gravitational wave radiation ( gwr ) in the last stage ( orbital period @xmath7 3 hrs ) @xcite . as mass transfer from the secondary proceeds ,",
    "the secondary becomes partially degenerate .",
    "the smaller the mass of the degenerate secondary star becomes , the larger its radius becomes .",
    "such a transition of the mass - radius relation causes the increasing orbital period .",
    "hence it is believed that there is a theoretical lower limit of the period of cvs , called the period minimum @xmath4 ( @xcite ) .",
    "assuming that the angular momentum loss of the binary is driven purely by the gwr , the theoretical @xmath4 is calculated to be 6570 min @xcite .",
    "however , the observational cut - off of the @xmath1 distribution is about 80 min , and the peak , called the period spike , is about 82 min @xcite .",
    "thus , @xcite suggested an increased rate of the angular momentum loss to match the observational distribution , and reproduced @xmath4 of 82 min . although the value of 82 min has been widely accepted , the mechanism of the larger angular momentum loss is unclear , and the discrepancy between the theory and observation is not settled yet ( period minimum problem ) .",
    "cvs below the period minimum are generally classified as evolved objects called ei psc - type , or helium - rich objects called am cvn - type .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite reported on the peculiar `` wz sge - like '' cv ov boo ( sdss 150722.30 + 523039.8 ) whose orbital period of 67 min is below the period minimum of 82 min . ``",

    "we do not know , however , whether an object like ov boo shows outbursts like wz sge - type objects .    in this paper",
    ", we report on a new wz sge - type dn below the period minimum , asassn-15po .",

    "orbital periods of cvs are very important for determining the evolutionary stage of cvs .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , we regarded the period of early superhumps as the orbital period , and the value is 0.050454(2 ) d ( @xmath29 72.6 min ) below the period minimum of 82 min .",

    "this method , however , suffers from the degree of pressure effect @xcite .",
    "recently , deepened understanding of precession disk enable us to develop the estimation method of mass ratio of su uma - type dne . by using the method of @xcite",
    ", we can estimate the mass ratio @xmath0 from @xmath1 and @xmath2 of stage a. we define the fractional superhump excess @xmath32 as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the aspidal precession rate of the eccentric disk , and @xmath35 is the orbital angular frequency.the dynamical precession rate @xmath36 at the radius @xmath37 is as follows ( note that equation [ eq : omega ] in @xcite is a misprint @xcite . ) @xmath38 where @xmath37 is normalized by the binary separation and @xmath39 is the laplace coefficient @xcite , @xmath40 we know that the dynamical precession during stage a occurs at the 3:1 resonance radius , which is given by @xmath41 by numerically solving the above equations , the mass ratio ( @xmath0 ) can be obtained just from @xmath1 and @xmath2 of stage a. we calculated that the @xmath0 of asassn-15po is 0.0699(8 ) .",
    "this is a normal value in wz sge - type dne .",
    "we also know the empirical relation of wz sge - type dne between @xmath0 and @xmath27 during stage b. @xcite derived the following equation @xmath42 @xmath0 from equation [ eq : q_emp ] is 0.066(7 ) which is in good agreement with @xmath0 from stage a. we note that this relation is known to hold for ordinary wz sge - type dne ( and a part of su uma - type dne ) , and it is unclear whether we can use the relation for unusual wz sge - type dne",
    ". we should confirm it by measuring more unusual objects .",
    "we introduced the evolutionary theory of cvs in section 1 , and the evolutionary track can be clearly seen on the relation between mass ratio @xmath0 versus @xmath1 in figure [ fig : evo ] , which is taken from @xcite",
    ". filled circle and squares are cvs for which mass ratios have been are measured by stage a superhumps and eclipses , respectively .",
    "the dashed line is one of the standard evolutionary tracks , which is assumed that the angular momentum loss is driven only by the gwr , and the thick line is another one , which is modified by assuming a higher angular momentum loss to correspond with the observational studies , with the period minimum of 82 min from @xcite .",
    "the mechanism of the higher angular momentum loss rate is unclear ; nevertheless , the modified evolutionary theory has been widely accepted . the scattering around @xmath430.074 is mainly caused by observational difficulties . one system ( iy uma ) with @xmath440.10 is an eclipsing one and it is difficult to determine the period of stage a superhumps due to overlap with eclipses ( see , @xcite ) . other systems with relatively long @xmath1 ( @xmath190.074 )",
    "also have difficulties since stage a superhumps in high-@xmath0 systems last only 1 - 2d , in contrast to several days in low-@xmath0 systems .",
    "although the majority of cvs are considered to evolve along the evolutionary track as the mass transfer proceeds , asassn-15po is located below the period minimum .",
    "this object is a long - sought candidate of the theoretical period minimum cv , which evolves purely by the gwr .",
    "this possibility , however , may be less likely since the majority of known cvs are not apparently on the theoretical evolutionary track and there is no physical reason why one single cv out of more than 2000 should undergo a different type of angular momentum loss .",
    "the systems with high - density secondaries can have shorter orbital periods below the period minimum .",
    "as we consider the roche - lobe geometry , the relation of @xmath1 and density of a secondary star @xmath45 is restricted to @xmath46 @xcite . from this relation",
    ", we can say that the shorter orbital period the system has , the higher density the secondaries should be .",
    "hence , the short orbital period of asassn-15po suggests that this system has a compact , high - density secondary .",
    "one explanation to the high - density secondary is that the system has a slightly evolved secondary , which are called ei psc - type cvs @xcite .",
    "the density of evolved stars is higher than that of hydrogen - rich stars @xcite .",
    "recently , several ei psc - type cvs have been discovered and are thought to be intermediate objects evolving toward the am cvn - type systems in the cv channel .",
    "the identification of ei psc - type is an unusually hot donor for the short orbital period @xcite , which can be explained by an evolved donor that has been stripped of its hydrogen layers .",
    "another hallmark of these system is that they are n -enhanced , and c - depleted @xcite .",
    "there is , however , only a low - resolution spectroscopic observation of asassn-15po ( see section [ sec : spectrum ] ) , so we can not determine whether asassn-15po is classified as a ei psc - type cv . it is known that evolved cvs often show profiles of superoutbursts different from ones of hydrogen - rich cvs because of the difference of the ionization temperature between the hydrogen and evolved helium - rich disks @xcite .",
    "however , it is known that some ei psc - type cvs show outbursts similar to typical hydrogen - rich objects , because the secondaries of such objects are considered to be only slightly evolved and have a hydrogen - rich surface and a helium - rich core .",
    "the disk composition of such objects is , thus , still sufficiently hydrogen - rich ( ohshima et al . in preparation ) . considering this ,",
    "there is a possibility that asassn-15po is a member of the ei psc - type cvs .",
    "we are not sure , however , whether the surface and core composition is sufficiently different since these stars may be fully , or nearly fully convective .",
    "the other possibility is that this object is metal - poor ( population ii ) . as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "if the metallicity of the secondary is poor , the opacity of the surface is also small , which leads to about a 20@xmath47 smaller radius of the secondary .",
    "lower metallicity enables the period minimum to become shorter @xcite .",
    "hence , the short orbital period of asassn-15po can imply that the object belongs to population ii .",
    "however , we have to note that , as mentioned in section [ sec : int ] , cvs with low metallicity may not undergo the same outbursts as cvs with normal metallicity because of the different opacity of the accretion disk . in ordinary hydrogen - rich cvs",
    ", the middle branch of the s - curve mainly represents the opacity variation due to the partial ionization of hydrogen .",
    "it is known that iron - group elements contribute to this opacity , and we may expect some difference in the s - curve between population i cvs and iron - poor population ii ones , and consequently some difference in the outburst behavior ( cf .",
    "different s - curve in different metallicities in @xcite ) .",
    "this metallicity effect becomes more prominent in hydrogen - poor systems ( fig.3 in @xcite ) .",
    "we do not have observational evidence whether outburst properties are different in population ii cvs from population i ones , but since the number of cvs in globular clusters is increasing ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , we may have observational evidence in near future how population ii cvs behave during outbursts . here",
    ", we showed in section [ sec : res ] that assasn-15po behaved very similarly to ordinary hydrogen - rich cvs .",
    "assuming the difference of the outburst behavior between population i and ii , our observations suggest that asassn-15po is not a population ii star .",
    "we have no way to identify whether the secondary belongs to population ii because there is no data of proper motion of this object . in order to check this interpretation",
    ", we need a theoretical model calculation of dn outbursts for different metallicities and a direct spectroscopic observation in quiescence .",
    "finally , we have to consider a possibility that the binary was born with a brown - dwarf donor below the period minimum .",
    "this system may have started mass transfer below period minimum , and evolved toward present longer period .",
    "we reported photometric observations and a low - resolution spectroscopy of the superoutburst of asassn-15po .",
    "the light curve showed a typical wz sge - type superoutburst with the multiple rebrightenings , classified as type a / b . the main superoutburst lasted for about 28 days , and , after a few days , the rebrightening phase began and continued for at least 24 days .",
    "we could also see early superhumps ( bjd 2457277.382457285.62 ) , stage a superhumps ( bjd 2457286.972457289.46 ) and stage b superhumps ( 2457289.462457303.79 ) .",
