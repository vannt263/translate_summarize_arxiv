    "observations of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , in particular wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap )  @xcite provide us with some of the most promising data to study the signatures of the early universe .",

    "the detected temperature and polarization angular power spectrum , contains informations about the background cosmology as well as the initial conditions of the universe .",
    "precision measurements of anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background , and the clustering of large scale structure , suggest that the primordial density perturbation is dominantly adiabatic ( isentropic ) and has a nearly scale invariant spectrum  @xcite .",
    "this is in good agreement with most simple inflationary scenarios which predict power law or scale invariant forms of the primordial perturbation  @xcite .",
    "the data have also been used widely to put constraints on different parametric forms of primordial spectrum , mostly motivated by inflation  @xcite . however , despite the simplicity of a featureless primordial spectrum , it is quite important to determine the form of the primordial power spectrum directly from observations with minimal theoretical bias since departure from the scale invariant form of the pps is motivated by most inflationary scenarios .",
    "many model independent searches have been carried out to look for features in the cmb primordial power spectrum  @xcite .",
    "the richardson - lucy ( rl ) deconvolution algorithm , was employed as one of the first approaches to reconstruct the form of the primordial spectrum directly from cmb data and has been extensively used till now on different cmb observations  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we modify further the rl deconvolution algorithm and we reconstruct the power spectrum using wmap 9 year data . amongst several new features in this paper , in particular we shall use directly the _",
    "un - binned _ correlated @xmath5 data to reconstruct the power spectrum .",
    "we note that all earlier studies have used the uncorrelated binned data to reconstruct the pps and we show that this new modification improves the efficiency of the method in providing a pps that radically improves the likelihood of fit to cmb data significantly .",
    "it is important to clarify that our goal is solely to determine a pps that best fits the cmb data at any given location in the cosmological parameter space .",
    "we do not attempt to claim that the pps obtained pertains to the true pps , as such would be fraught with interpretational conundrums .",
    "our approach allows a computational approach to sample the functional degree of freedom in the pps and the consequent implications for the cosmological parameter estimation . at first glance",
    "though it seem to be a mathematically inappropriate study , since rl needs uncorrelated data to begin with , we shall show that the use of the un - binned data improves the algorithm in various ways for our particular case of study .",
    "we show that using this method for the first time we have been able to directly reconstruct a power spectrum which improves the @xmath0 fit to the most recent cmb data by about 200 - 300 better than the best fit power - law form of the pps .",
    "we should mention that it is the improved quality of the present day data that allows us to directly use the un - binned data with the modifications to the rl algorithm .",
    "this is expected to be even more relevant for the forthcoming planck  @xcite data . while getting such a huge improvement in the @xmath0 fit",
    "is exciting and hints towards the feasibility of detecting features in the pps , we address the consistency check of different pps models to the data and find that the power - law form of the primordial spectrum is indeed consistent with the current data after a complete error - analysis .",
    "so we reiterate to the readers that these two issues , reconstruction and falsification , should not be confused .",

    "first we discuss the rl algorithm and its modification implemented in this work .",
    "then we explain in detail the way to incorporate the binned , un - binned data in a combined analysis .",

    "the method of using un - binned @xmath5 data in a combined analysis is the major new implication in this work and we shall explain our assumptions in subsection  [ subsec : unbinned ] .",
    "apart from obtaining a power spectrum providing a better fit , through error estimation , we address whether power law power spectrum is still allowed by the current wmap data",
    ". finally we shall aim to reconstruct pps that provides a much better fit than the conventional slow roll inflationary scenarios but at the same time does not include too many features and can be obtained from inflationary potential with a limited number of parameters .      in the field of astronomy ,",
    "rl algorithm is typically used for reconstruction of images  @xcite .",
    "it has been first demonstrated in article  @xcite that this method can be used to reconstruct the primordial power spectrum from the angular power spectrum using the deconvolution .",

    "irl algorithm can be formulated as follows ,    -p_k^(i)=p_k^(i ) ,  [ eq : irlalgorithm ] basically the convergence factor @xmath18^{2}$ ] , weighs down the contribution of two types of multipoles towards modification of the primordial spectrum , namely , the @xmath7 which has already closer to @xmath6 _ w.r.t _ others , and the data with higher errors . here",
    "we should mention that we have scaled the data with a factor such that the primordial power spectrum in each iterations remains cobe normalized .",
    "[ subsec : unbinned ]    as has been indicated in the introduction , the earlier works on the reconstruction of primordial power spectrum have been performed using the binned data from wmap .",
    "although the comparison with the binned data seems a reasonable approximation , it has limitations .",
    "the angular power spectra generated from the reconstructed primordial spectra , though , gives a better fit to the binned data compared to the power law spectrum , it provides a worse fit to the complete data which incorporates un - binned auto and cross correlations of temperature and polarization anisotropies . as the reconstructed power spectrum by definition attempts to fit only the few binned data - points , in between two binned multipole spurious oscillations",
    "are imposed which are not expected to agree with the complete datasets and provides a worse likelihood to the total data .",
    "smoothing of these spurious oscillations needs to be implemented in order to average out unwanted features and obtain a better fit to the data  @xcite .    on the other hand , though working with un - binned correlated data does not seem to be a perfect choice _ mathematically _ , we found that this approach is much better than working with the binned data in various ways",
    ". we should remember that we are using irl method adjusted for our case of study dealing with data with different uncertainties which is a clear physical problem rather than looking for exact solutions for a set of mathematical equations .",
    "we can modify equation .",
    "[ eq : irlalgorithm ] considering the correlated error matrix of the data , henceforth we shall call it mrl ( modified richardson - lucy ) :    -p_k^(i)=p_k^(i ) ,  [ eq : modifiedirlalgorithm ]    q_=_(c_^d - c_^t(i ) ) cov^-1(, )    where @xmath19 is the inverse of the error covariance matrix . in practice",
    ", this inverse of the error matrix from wmap 9 years observations can not be implemented directly due to complication of likelihood estimators .",
    "however , still one can use a likelihood function similar to the one used by wmap team in their first data release to generate a covariance matrix using pseudo @xmath5 s . in this work",
    "we show that even using the diagonal terms of the covariance matrix which are given by wmap 9 year results would still work perfectly fine in our context of study .",

    "looking at fig .",
    "[ fig : vark ] and comparing blue and green lines which are the likelihoods given by the wmap codes and the @xmath0 derived by using the diagonal terms of the covariance matrix , we see that they are following each other clearly at all scales and this reflects that we have chosen a reasonable approximation in our reconstruction procedure .",
    "the new approach requires much less iterations to reach a reconstructed power spectra providing a better fit . on the other hand",
    "the reconstructed power spectra directly provides a much better fit ( @xmath20 ) to the total data set ( computed by wmap likelihood code ) compared to the best fit power law case . finally , unlike the works with the binned datasets",
    ", we do not have to smooth the power spectrum in this case to achieve a good likelihood to the whole data .",
    "the use of un - binned data makes the method of reconstruction much more faster too , since in this case we are using more informations from the observations which directly contribute to the corrections of the pps compared to the binned data where we only use 44 binned @xmath5 s which average out the contributions .",
    "hence , in a way we get a huge improvement of fit directly with fewer iterations . here , though to have an idealistic analysis , a treatment with full covariance matrix is required , we have found that the diagonal terms are sufficient to have an efficient reconstruction , at least to the cosmological scales covered by wmap .",
    "however , we should mention that the method of using the un - binned data has its own disadvantages .",
    "after the multipole moment @xmath21 the quality of data gets worse as the noise becomes comparable to the signal ( or higher as we go to higher @xmath22 ) . in the range @xmath23 one encounters a number of negative @xmath5 which forces the mrl method to set @xmath8 to _ zero _ at high @xmath24 region , which is purely unphysical artefact of the negative @xmath5 s . to avoid this problem",
    "we have carried out our analysis by setting the negative @xmath5 s to zero .",
    "we shall demonstrate the results obtained in the section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "we find , despite of setting the negative @xmath5 s to zero ( which we consider a crude approximation ) the reconstructed power spectra provide a better fit of @xmath25 when compared with the conventional power law primordial spectrum .",
    "we note that this is indeed an artefact of the limitations of the high @xmath22 data towards improvement of fit . here",
    "it is important to emphasize that as we have _ neglected _ the negative @xmath5 s , the amplitude of power around the third peak is _ enhanced _",
    ", which , in turn leads to an amplification of scalar power spectrum at large @xmath24 ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "finally to get rid of the _ unphysical _ amplification described above , we have implemented the mrl algorithm to the combined binned and un - binned temperature data .",
    "we have considered the un - binned data till the multipole @xmath27 an the binned data afterwards   at @xmath28 by setting it to zero .",

    "however , the present polarization data from wmap-9 is not good enough to improve significantly our reconstruction process .",
    "for instance a quick glance of the un - binned ee angular power spectrum should reveal many negative points in every cosmological scales which is certainly not physical .",
    "binned ee and te spectrum can be used for reconstruction as in  @xcite , but we should emphasize that the huge improvement of fit , which is the main crux of this paper comes from the un - binned reconstruction which certainly can not be achieved by taking into account the binned polarization data . with the upcoming results from planck  @xcite we hope that we shall have access to a far better polarization data which can be used for a more efficient reconstruction .    here",
    ", we should also discuss briefly the effect of cmb gravitational lensing on the reconstruction procedure . apart form",
    "the underlying cosmological model , the effects of lensing on the angular power spectrum depends mildly on the form of the primordial power spectrum as well .",
    "this makes it quite complicated to incorporate the effect of lensing directly in the rl kernel @xmath32 .",
    "however , we find that the effect of lensing for scales probed by wmap does not differ drastically when we compare between reconstructed power spectrum and power law spectrum . in this paper for simplicity",
    "we neglect the effect of lensing in the reconstruction process ( though in the likelihood estimation it is considered ) since the background model is fixed . for the purpose of cosmological parameter estimation with the reconstructed spectra , which we are presently pursuing , we in fact take into account the effect of lensing through some approximation that would be reported in a forthcoming publication .",
    "as has been described in earlier literature  @xcite , after a few iterations , mrl method converges to a reconstructed power spectrum which provides a _ huge _ improvement of fit when compared with the standard power law case .",
    "it should be mentioned that , as the mrl method attempts to reconstruct the primordial spectra by fitting the mean values of the observed @xmath5 data , we find the reconstructed @xmath5 goes through the vicinity of most of the data points . now , as the data has the probability to reside within its observed errors , we should be able to reconstruct a set of primordial spectra which generate @xmath5 s residing within the errors associated with the data .",
    "we synthesize 1000 @xmath5 datasets from the original data points with gaussian random fluctuations with a variance associated to the corresponding 1@xmath33 errors to the data - points ( in the context of error - estimation also see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    using the above formalism",
    ", we generate 1000 primordial power spectra . to obtain the band associated to the uncertainty , in each mode we identify the most dense region which contains @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( corresponding to the 1@xmath33 and 2@xmath33 regions respectively ) spectra within .",
    "this statistics helps us to get rid of the distribution around the mean value and the errorband obtained is expected to purely contain the 1@xmath33 and 2@xmath33 region of maximum occurrence of events .",
    "[ subsec : smooth ]    in this work we have used the un - binned @xmath5 s to reconstruct the primordial power spectrum .",
    "it has been indicated in earlier works that working with the binned data requires a post - iteration smoothing  @xcite to get a power spectrum providing a better fit to the complete cmb data ( likelihood obtained using the complete covariance matrix including polarization ) _ w.r.t _ the power law spectrum .",
    "although , the use of the un - binned data privilege us to provide a huge better fit to the data without smoothing , we would like to point out that this reconstructed power spectrum contains unphysical artefacts due to presence of observational and statistical noise in the data .",
    "smoothing of the reconstructed power spectrum helps us to find out the broad shape of the power spectrum directly from the cmb observation with the averaging out the possible noise effects .    to smooth the spectrum we adopt the following algorithm using gaussian filters .",
    "= ,    where , @xmath36 indicates the width of the gaussian filter and note that as @xmath36 approaches zero , the smooth spectrum becomes identical to the raw one .    in our work",
    "we have tested two types of smoothing using the filter width @xmath36 . in the first method we choose the width @xmath36 to be constant over all scales .",
    "we investigate the dependence of the likelihood as a function of the width under different iterations .",
    "now , keeping in mind that the quality of the data is not good at higher multipoles ( @xmath37 ) to provide tight constraints on power spectrum at high @xmath24 , we use a variable width . here , we use @xmath38 .",
    "this allows us to incorporate the broad oscillations ( possible artifacts of inflationary model ) at the intermediate cosmological scales and average out the violent oscillations ( if any ) , possibly generated from the noise .",
    "there are ways that one can define a penalty term for non - smoothness of the reconstructed spectrum and combine this quantity with @xmath39 fit to the data to derive the likelihood ( effective @xmath39 ) .",
    "however , the weight one gives to the penalty term and also definition of the penalty term can both be arbitrary choices affecting the results .",
    "though , to distinguish the broad and possible physical features from the noise , a careful error dependent smoothing can be carried out .",
    "we are currently investigating such issues .",
    "we have used publicly available code camb  @xcite to compute the kernel @xmath9 . following the irl algorithm implemented in earlier works",
    ", we have developed a new fortran 90 code .",
    "we have used our code as an add - on to camb .",
    "we have fixed the values of @xmath40 and @xmath10 to their best fit obtained from the analysis of wmap nine - year data  @xcite .    for the reconstruction with the binned data we have made use of the wmap nine - year data and its binning .",
    "we bin the kernel @xmath9 and the @xmath7 s ( appearing in eq .",
    "[ eq : combined ] ) using the same binning as in wmap nine - year data .",
    "we normalize @xmath9 to one in every multipole as indicated in earlier works to get @xmath15 . for the analysis with the un - binned data we follow the same procedure as above except the binning and for the combined data we follow eq .",

    "guess we have used the best fit primordial power spectrum from wmap-9 .",
    "we have used nearly 1700 @xmath24-space samples to calculate the @xmath5 s . using a higher number of @xmath24-space points obviously provides a much better fit to the spectra ( @xmath41 ) as it contains more degrees of freedom , but at the same time contains violent oscillations at higher wavenumbers .",
    "if we aim to converge on a power spectrum that can be motivated by an inflationary theory with a few parameters , we should have less fluctuations in the power spectrum and it requires a careful smoothing of the spectra which is of course easier to implement in the former case with less @xmath24-space sampling .",
    "in this section we shall demonstrate the results of our analysis .",
    "we should point out that , unless otherwise explicitly mentioned , the figures presented in this section are obtained using the combined un - binned and binned data following eq .",
    "[ eq : combined ] . following the smoothing algorithm in the subsection  [ subsec : smooth ]",

    "this figure shows the likelihood calculated considering temperature data alone and including the polarization .",
    "we would like to point out that smoothing of the primordial spectrum affects the temperature and the polarization spectrum in a similar way and this fact justifies that our method of working with the un - binned data is quite apt .",
    "further the inset of the figure suggests using the combined un - binned and binned data only after 20 iterations we are able to get a better fit of @xmath45 without any smoothing of the data  ] .",
    "needless to add , as expected we get better fit with the low width of the smoothing filter . however , we would like to add a couple of sentence regarding the increase of @xmath0 obtained from highly smoothed spectra as we increase iterations .",
    "a quick glance at the wmap un - binned data reveals for a number of multipoles the theoretically angular power spectrum from power law is unable to fit the data .",
    "basically the @xmath46 convergence factor introduced in the irl ( and mrl ) algorithm induces the broad features in the spectrum which helps us to fit the the outliers with low noise in first few iterations .",
    "if we allow higher iterations the it is possible to get a huge improvement of fit ( @xmath47 ) by fitting the possible noise in the data .",
    "now a smoothing of such highly oscillatory spectrum using a filter of uniform width in all scales suppresses the imposed oscillations in uniform manner which leads to a worse fit .",
    "[ fig : vark ] suggests that for @xmath48 the spectra obtained after 70 and 100 iterations actually fit the data worse than the power law , while note that the smoothed spectra after 20 iterations is indeed providing a better fit .",
    "however , with decreasing @xmath36 we recover that with higher iterations we get higher better fit to the data . here , we should also mention that using a different smoothing algorithm it should be possible to get rid of unwanted oscillations in the spectrum .",

    "we have also performed smoothing on the reconstructed results to get variety of the cases with different fluctuations that could rise to the high likelihood to the data .",
    "we have presented a few samples of reconstructed smooth primordial power spectrum and the corresponding angular power spectra which provide better likelihoods w.r.t . the power law spectrum . here",
    "we should also mention that we have implemented the smoothing to obtain a primordial power spectrum that can be generated with only a handful of parameters such that this can be motivated from an inflationary scenarios . after comparing the effect of the width of smoothing filter on the total likelihood and the likelihood obtained from the diagonal term of the inverse covariance matrix",
    "we argue that our method of using the combined data ( un - binned and binned ) in mrl algorithm is a robust assumption . finally to obtain the error band for the reconstructed primordial spectrum associated to the uncertainty of the observational data we generated 1000 datasets bootstrapped from the original @xmath64 s .",
    "we find that though the features provide a huge better fit to the data , all these features could be presented because of random fluctuations and noise and in fact power law is still very much consistent to the cmb observations .",
    "we should emphasis here that there is a delicate difference between reconstruction and falsification . while doing falsification we test possibility of the observed data given the model , in the reconstruction approach we try to look at all phenomenological possibilities . in this work",
    "we have done both of these tasks and while we see that power - law is consistent to the data , we present handful of cases and forms for the primordial spectrum that all can give very good fit to the data . with the upcoming data from planck",
    "we expect that it will be possible to use un - binned data up to higher range of multiples and with our proposed procedure we will be able to probe smaller scales of primordial power spectrum .",
    "further , we also expect to get a tighter errorband on the primordial spectrum than what we have achieved with wmap-9 using high quality of planck polarization data .",
    "in fact the quality of the wmap polarization data was very much inferior to its temperature data and we could not achieve any significant better fit to the whole data by incorporation of wmap polarization data . while in this paper we proposed a new and easy to use approach for the reconstruction of the primordial spectrum , in a companion paper we perform the important task of cosmological parameter estimation allowing the free form of the pps  @xcite .",

    "<S> we have improved further the error sensitive richardson - lucy deconvolution algorithm making it applicable directly on the un - binned measured angular power spectrum of cosmic microwave background observations to reconstruct the form of the primordial power spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> this improvement makes the application of the method significantly more straight forward by removing some intermediate stages of analysis allowing a reconstruction of the primordial spectrum with higher efficiency and precision and with lower computational expenses . applying the modified algorithm we fit the wmap 9 year data using the optimized reconstructed form of the primordial spectrum with more than 300 improvement in @xmath0 with respect to the best fit power - law . </S>",
    "<S> this is clearly beyond the reach of other alternative approaches and reflects the efficiency of the proposed method in the reconstruction process and allow us to look for any possible feature in the primordial spectrum projected in the cmb data . </S>",
    "<S> though the proposed method allow us to look at various possibilities for the form of the primordial spectrum , all having good fit to the data , proper error - analysis is needed to test for consistency of theoretical models since , along with possible physical artefacts , most of the features in the reconstructed spectrum might be arising from fitting noises in the cmb data . </S>",
    "<S> reconstructed error - band for the form of the primordial spectrum using many realizations of the data , all bootstrapped and based on wmap 9 year data , shows proper consistency of power - law form of the primordial spectrum with the wmap 9 data at all wave numbers . </S>",
