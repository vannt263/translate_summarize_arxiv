    "in this paper we prove that one can obtain natural bundles of lie algebras on rank two @xmath0-manifolds , with fibres isomorphic to @xmath1 and to @xmath2 , @xmath3 . in the most rigid case ( which includes complex tori and abelian varieties ) these bundles have natural flat connections ,",
    "whose flat global sections act naturally on cohomology .",
    "+ an @xmath0-structure is a direct generalization ( with @xmath0 distinct `` forms '' ) of the notion of structure , to which it reduces when @xmath4 .",
    "the original motivation for the introduction in @xcite of @xmath0-manifolds was the geometric study of the analytical theory of maps from ( open subsets of ) @xmath5 to a given manifold .",
    "then it was realized that this theory in the case @xmath6 is well suited for the study of mirror symmetry ( see @xcite,@xcite ) , as it should be , given that for @xmath7 we are considering maps from riemann surfaces into general manifolds . in a further specialization of the general features of the theory ,",
    "already in @xcite and @xcite , and more in detail in @xcite , it was argued that , independently of the geometric motivations , one can observe a rich algebraic structure `` living '' on natural bundles on @xmath0-manifolds .",
    "we decided therefore to embark in a systematic study of these algebraic structures , because of their intrinsic interest , and with the strong belief that if we could master them well enough , we would then be able to apply this theory to interesting problems in algebra and in geometry .",
    "+ the first result of this line of work is the paper @xcite , where we found a natural lie superalgebra bundle on rank three 2-manifolds .",
    "we believe that these computations will be very relevant to the geometric study of mirror symmetry , and to the search of a geometrical interpolation between the various string theories ( see @xcite for a more detailed introduction on this aspect ) .",
    "more specifically , in @xcite it was conjectured that the natural bundles of lie ( super ) algebras and of their representations on certain 2-manifolds could provide the natural background on which to build field theories ; these are rich from the representation theoretic point of view and , once quantized using the language of @xcite , were conjectured to be the right playing field for the search of an m - theory ( see for example @xcite for a similar approach to the standard model in particle physics ) . a direction more in line with this algebraic study ( but actually strongly related to the previous one ) is the relationship with higgs bundles and hitchin systems",
    "( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "+ in the present paper we obtain results which are directly applicable to questions in complex geometry and in algebraic geometry .",
    "the basic reason for this is that a rank two @xmath0-manifold ( or a naturally defined double cover of it , in some cases ) has a canonical complex structure , with which it becomes of complex dimension @xmath8 .",
    "we prove that on these manifolds originating from @xmath0-geometry there are natural bundles of unitary lie algebras of signature @xmath9 , which act in various ways on differential forms .",
    "it is this natural way of representing `` large '' and well known unitary lie algebras on differential forms which opens a wide range of geometric applications . for comparison",
    ", one should recall that the corresponding constructions for plain manifolds produce the `` lefschetz '' action of @xmath10 on forms and on cohomology , which has a lot of geometric applications and consequences .",
    "+ let us now introduce more in detail the geometric and algebraic characters which will play a role .",
    "the initial object comes from a generalization and an unconventional point of view on the notion of jet space ( see @xcite for details ) :    a _",
    "manifold of rank @xmath11 is a smooth manifold of dimension @xmath12 , together with @xmath0 smooth closed two - forms @xmath13 such that for any @xmath14 there is a ( darboux ) coordinate system around @xmath15 of the form @xmath16 for which the forms have the canonical ( local ) expression @xmath17    of course , when @xmath4 we recover the usual notion of ( possibly degenerate ) symplectic manifold .",
    "when one adds a riemannian metric , and asks for the natural compatibility conditions with the polisymplectic data , one comes to our main object of study : +    [ dfn - ska ] a smooth manifold @xmath18 of dimension @xmath19 together with a riemannian metric @xmath20 and @xmath21-forms @xmath22 is _ @xmath0- _ ( of rank",
    "@xmath11 ) if for each point of @xmath18 there exist an open neighborhood @xmath23 of @xmath15 and a system of coordinates @xmath24,@xmath25 , @xmath26 on @xmath23 such that : + 1 ) @xmath27 , + 2 ) @xmath28 . +",
    "any such system of coordinates is called _",
    "standard_(@xmath0- ) .    for @xmath4",
    "one recovers the usual notion of manifold . as in the case of manifolds",
    ", one can use the differential forms associated to the structure to build `` wedge '' operators on forms , and , using their adjoints , one gets natural lie algebras .",
    "again as in the case of manifolds , to build correctly a theory involving also the adjoints of such wedge operators , it is necessary to consider their pointwise action , and to recover the global operators on forms as global sections of corresponding bundles of lie algebras .",
    "when @xmath29 one obtains the classical @xmath10 action on the forms of a manifold ( and on its cohomology using the hodge identities ) . in the case @xmath30 there is a qualitatively different situation , in that there are more natural differential two - forms than one could initially guess .",
    "indeed , in addition to the structural forms @xmath13 which generalize directly the form , there are also `` mixed '' forms @xmath31 for any pair of indices @xmath32 , including the structural ones via the identifications @xmath33 the precise description of these derived natural forms will be given in the next section . here",
    "however we can already use them to build corresponding `` wedge '' operators , lefschetz style :    [ dfn : loperators ] for @xmath34 and @xmath35 with @xmath36 , @xmath37    some canonical mutually orthogonal distributions @xmath38",
    "( @xmath39 ) are induced on @xmath40 by the forms @xmath31 ( see section [ sec : defi ] ) .",
    "therefore other natural operators , called @xmath41 ( @xmath39 ) arise from wedging with the local volume forms of these distributions .",
    "one then uses all these operators , and their ( pointwise ) adjoints , to build a natural bundle of real lie algebras @xmath42 ( and its complexified bundle @xmath43 ) acting on forms . to be precise",
    ", one can fix a point @xmath14 , and on this point one can restrict the actions above , to obtain bundles of lie algebras on the @xmath0-manifold .",
    "this approach has many advantages , among which the fact that these bundles will exist also in situations in which the single operators used to define them do not have global sections on all of @xmath44 .",
    "+ coming to a more detailed description of the contents of the present paper , in section [ sec : defi ] we give the definiton of _ almost _ @xmath45structure , which is a weaker version of the defintion of @xmath45structure .",
    "then we provide a first geometric description of an ( almost ) @xmath45manifold @xmath44 : we discuss the existence of an ( almost ) complex structure , the natural distributions on the cotangent space , the group of local structure - preserving tranformations and the orientability properties .    section [ sec : natural ] is devoted to the definition of the bundles of lie algebras @xmath42 and @xmath43 on @xmath44 which constitute the main object to be studied in this paper .",
    "we also point out two other real forms ( @xmath46 ) , defined in terms of geometric generators , of the bundle @xmath43 .",
    "we then define @xmath47 as the real sub - bundle of @xmath43 which is the direct generalization of the classical @xmath10 lefschetz bundle of geometry .",
    "the sections from 4 to 7 are a detailed study of the fibres of above mentioned lie algebra bundles : in section 4 the lefschetz bundle @xmath47 is studied in detail , by showing some fundamental relations among its generators ; the fibres of the bundle turn out to be isomorphic to the orthogonal algebra @xmath48 and serre generators are presented in terms of simple brackets of geometric generators ( theorem [ pro : dn ] ) .",
    "sections 5 and 6 are devoted to the complete description of the main complex bundle @xmath43 : we use the hodge decomposition on @xmath49 with respect to the ( almost ) complex structure and clifford algebra techniques to show that the fibres of @xmath43 are isomorphic to @xmath50 ; furthermore , we characterize @xmath43 as the bundle of all quadratic elements of trace zero ( compatible with the almost complex structure ) of a clifford algebra bundle ( theorem [ teo : slstructure ] ) .",
    "section 7 focusses on the real forms of @xmath43 which turn out to be interesting both from the algebraic and the geometric point of view .",
    "in fact @xmath51 is proven to be the bundle of the real split form of @xmath43 , while @xmath42 and @xmath52 are shown to be the real bundles of operators which preserve two natural non degenerate hermitean inner products on @xmath49 ( theorems [ pro : realform ] , [ teo : ggru ] , [ teo : ggr ] ) .",
    "a superhermitean variant of one of these inner products was introduced in @xcite to study rank three wsd structures .",
    "a computation of the signature shows that the fibres of @xmath42 and @xmath52 are unitary lie algebras isomorphic to @xmath53 .",
    "we observe that the complete description of @xmath42 fully answers to the question ( first rised in @xcite and then more precisely in the rank two case in @xcite ) on the nature of the algebraic bundles generated by the real canonical operators associated to an @xmath0-structure .",
    "furthermore , at the end of the section , @xmath47 is shown to coincide with @xmath54 .",
    "after this presentation of the natural lie bundles of an @xmath0-structure , we devote sections [ sec : tori ] and [ sec : moduli ] to the construction of some examples of ( full , almost , or pointwise ) @xmath0-structures . in section [ sec : tori ] we first recall the standard examples of @xcite built using iterated cotangent bundles of smooth riemannian manifolds .",
    "we then observe how any real torus of dimension @xmath19 can be given many non - equivalent translation invariant @xmath0-structures . in corollary",
    "[ cor : cohomology ] we prove that when @xmath44 is compact orientable @xmath0-there is a natural action of the flat global sections of the bundles of lie algebras @xmath55 on cohomology .",
    "then , in theorem [ teo : rivfinito ] , we characterize the rank two @xmath0-manifolds which are quotients of tori in terms of the calabi - yau condition . in section [ sec : moduli ]",
    "we put a pointwise rank two @xmath0-structure on the moduli space of elliptic curves with @xmath56 punctures , which depends naturally on any chosen metric .",
    "this section is again introductory in nature , but with a stronger emphasis on the geometric aspects of the theory . it would be too long to describe all the general facts on @xmath0-geometry here , so we will list here only the most relevant ones for our purposes , while referring to @xcite for a more thorough analysis .",
    "first , as will have been clear already to the reader , one can isolate the pointwise aspects of the definition of an @xmath0-manifold .",
    "the notion of almost @xmath0-manifold given below is actually a hybrid between pointwise and local properties , which was introduced in @xcite ( in the nondegenerate case ) in the belief that this mix could be best suited to the purposes of that paper :    [ dfn : aska ] a _ almost @xmath0-structure of rank @xmath11 _ on a smooth manifold @xmath44 of dimension @xmath12 is given by a riemannian metric @xmath20 and a smooth differential two - form @xmath31 for any pair of indices @xmath57 such that @xmath58 give a polysymplectic structure , and for any point @xmath14 there is an orthonormal basis of @xmath40 made of covectors @xmath59 for @xmath60 and @xmath61 and @xmath62 such that , , @xmath63 the forms @xmath31 with @xmath64 are called _ dualizing forms_.    one can directly check that giving an almost @xmath0-structure is equivalent to giving the forms @xmath58 and a compatible metric , which is exactly what is needed for an @xmath0-structure , except for the local condition 2 ) , which is equivalent to the invariance of the forms with respect to the levi - civita connection .",
    "this is the way in which @xmath0-manifolds were introduced in @xcite .",
    "clearly there are some redundancies in the definition given above : for example , one has always @xmath65 .",
    "observe also that an almost 1-manifold is simply an almost manifold , and for this reason in this paper we consider only the case @xmath66 which is moreover the range where our constructions do exist .",
    "recall also that an almost 2-manifold in which the structure forms are closed is a weakly self dual manifold ( see @xcite , definition 2.6 ) , or wsd manifold for short .",
    "+   _ for the algebraic constructions to be discussed in this paper , all that is needed is a rank 2 almost @xmath0-structure ( actually for the main construction we will need only the pointwise part of the definition)_. + the almost @xmath0-structure on a manifold @xmath44 splits its cotangent space as @xmath67 where the @xmath68 are @xmath69 mutually orthogonal canonical distributions defined as : @xmath70 the almost @xmath0-structure also determines canonical pairwise linear identifications among the spaces @xmath68 , so that one can also write @xmath71 or more simply @xmath72 where @xmath73 .",
    "+ let us now come back to the canonical operators @xmath74 mentioned in the introduction .",
    "+ we now choose an orientaion of @xmath75 at a fixed point @xmath14 , and a ( non - canonical ) orthonormal basis @xmath76 compatible with this orientation ; this together with the standard identifications of the @xmath68 determines an orientation and an orthonormal basis for @xmath77 , which we write as @xmath78 .",
    "we remark that the @xmath59 are an _ adapted coframe _ for the almost @xmath0-structure , and therefore we have the explicit expressions : @xmath79 a different choice of the @xmath76 would be related to the previous one by an element in @xmath80 .",
    "the lie algebra of the group @xmath80 expressing the change from one adapted basis to another is generated point by point by the operator @xmath81 , which is determined and determines a ( pointwise , local or global if possible ) orientation of the distribution @xmath75 :    [ dfn : so2r ] the operator @xmath82 associated to the standard basis @xmath59 is defined as @xmath83 and @xmath84 for @xmath85    [ rmk : j ] as @xmath81 commutes with itself , and it is determined at every point @xmath14 by an orientation of @xmath86 , it is always well defined locally . of course , @xmath81 admits a global determination if and only if @xmath75 admits a global orientation .",
    "this happens for example if @xmath44 is orientable and @xmath0 is even .",
    "whenever we will need a local volume form on @xmath44 , we will use the one induced by a local choice of @xmath81 which we will call @xmath87 over the point @xmath14 .",
    "+ from the above considerations it follows the following fundamental remark :    an ( almost ) @xmath0-manifold of rank 2 is in particular an ( almost ) complex manifold of complex dimension s+1 , when there is a global determination of @xmath81 .",
    "this happens in particular when @xmath44 is orientable and @xmath0 is even .",
    "for this reason , rank two ( almost ) 2-manifolds can be seen as a chapter in ( almost ) complex geometry .",
    "this allows on one hand to `` import '' the techniques of complex geometry into the realm of almost 2-geometry , and on the other hand allows one to apply the results of almost 2-geometry to the complex world . summing up",
    ", we have that @xmath88 and in the rank two case we have moreover that locally @xmath89    when the structure is @xmath0- , one has that all the structure forms are covariant constant with respect to the levi - civita connection associated to the metric .",
    "this allows one to perform many of the same constructions that one usually performs in the case .",
    "in particular , one recovers ( the analog of ) the hodge identities , and the adjoints of the canonical operators @xmath74 operate on cohomology ( see theorem [ teo : skaid ] and corollary [ cor : cohomology ] ) .",
    "this is the context in the case of abelian varieties , which in our opinion will provide many interesting applications of the constructions to be detailed in the present paper .    for a general rank of the structure @xmath90",
    ", many of the above considerations generalize ; for example the group of pointwise transformations which preserve the structure is @xmath91 .",
    "as we have seen above , in the @xmath92 case we obtain @xmath93 whose algebra is generated by @xmath81 , while the @xmath94 case ( in which comes into play @xmath95 ) was discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "clearly however , not everything generalizes to arbitrary rank : for example , a rank three @xmath0-manifold may be of ( real ) dimension @xmath96 , which is odd and therefore it is impossible to have an almost complex structure on such a manifold . still in case @xmath94 ,",
    "one has natural operators also in odd degree , and therefore the natural algebras which come out of the geometry are lie superalgebras , instead of lie algebras ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in this section we fix a point @xmath15 in an almost @xmath0-manifold @xmath44 and we mostly work on tensor powers of @xmath97 .    as was mentioned in the previous sections , using the forms @xmath31 of the almost @xmath0-structure , we can build corresponding operators on forms , much in the way as the @xmath98 operator is built on manifolds : + * definition  [ dfn : loperators ] * _ for @xmath34 and @xmath35 with @xmath36 , @xmath37 _ + the above operators restrict also to @xmath99 for any @xmath14 where , using the chosen ( orthonormal ) basis , one can define also corresponding ( non canonical ) wedge and contraction operators :    let @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath14 . the operators @xmath102 and @xmath103 are respectively the wedge and the contraction operator with the form @xmath59 on @xmath99 ( defined using the given basis ) ; we use the notation @xmath104 to indicate the element of @xmath105 dual to @xmath106 : @xmath107    [ pro : clifrelations ] the operators @xmath108 satisfy the following relations : @xmath109 @xmath110 @xmath111 @xmath112 where @xmath113 is adjunction with respect to the metric .    the proof is a simple direct verification , which we omit . + it is then immediate to check that :    [ pro : dfnj ] @xmath81 can be expressed on the whole @xmath99 as @xmath114    [ rmk : dfnj ] from this expression and the previous proposition one obtains that @xmath115 , i.e. for every @xmath15 the lie algebra generated by @xmath81 is a subalgebra of @xmath116 isomorphic to @xmath117 .    using the ( non canonical ) operators @xmath102 we can obtain simple expressions for the pointwise action of the canonical wedge operators @xmath118 associated to the volume forms of the distributions @xmath68 :    [ dfn : voperators ] for @xmath119 and @xmath120 , @xmath121    remember however that the operators @xmath118 , being simply multiplication by the volume forms of the spaces @xmath68 , depend on the choice of a pointwise orientation for these spaces , which is implied for example by the choice of a determination for the operator @xmath81 . notice that when @xmath0 is even , and @xmath44 is oriented , it is always possible to define @xmath81 ( and consequently @xmath118 ) globally on @xmath44 . on the opposite extreme situation , if @xmath44 is non - orientable , it is certainly not possible to orient globally any one of the distributions @xmath68 ( and a fortiori you can not determine @xmath81 globally ) .",
