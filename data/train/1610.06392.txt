    "the main components of the experiment are a source of cooled and polarized atomic hydrogen , the hyperfine spectrometer of the @xmath10  hyperfine splitting ( hfs ) setup ( i.e. a microwave cavity and a superconducting sextupole magnet ) , and a hydrogen detector ( cf .",

    "the atomic hydrogen source maintains a microwave driven plasma in a pyrex cylinder to dissociate molecular hydrogen ( @xmath24 )  @xcite .",
    "hydrogen atoms are allowed into the first vacuum chamber through a ptfe tubing , which is kept under cryogenic temperatures in order to cool the hydrogen atoms and hence reduce their velocity  @xcite .",
    "two tubing configurations are used in which the plasma - containing pyrex cylinder is either mounted perpendicular to or on axis with the beam . in the first case ,",
    "a 90@xmath25 bent tubing assures an efficient and complete interaction of the hydrogen atoms with the cold ptfe surface . in the latter case ,",
    "a straight tubing keeps the recombinations caused by wall interactions down to a minimum .",
    "the cooled atomic hydrogen beam is directed onto a skimmer of in diameter and reaches the second , differentially - pumped chamber , which houses two permanent sextupole magnets with a pole field of @xmath26 at a radius of over a mechanical length of each  @xcite .",
    "in addition to providing the initial spin - polarisation , those sextupole magnets are moveable and feature a midway aperture ( aperture 1 ) to allow for the adjustable selection of a narrow velocity range .",
    "as the focusing length depends on the beam velocity , only a certain velocity component is focused onto the aperture and can pass , while the off - axis portions of all other components are blocked .",
    "the variable distance to the aperture located at half the distance between the sextuple magnets ( @xmath27 ) therefore selects a velocity component .",
    "the resulting velocity distribution is much narrower than a maxwell - boltzmann distribution and roughly of gaussian shape . the spin - polarised and velocity - selected hydrogen beam passes another aperture ( aperture 2 ) and is then modulated by a tuning fork chopper in the next differentially - pumped section .",
    "the modulation adds time - of - flight measurements to the beam diagnostic tools as well as suppression of background originating from residual hydrogen via lock - in amplification .",
    "downstream of the chopper , apertures of different diameters ( aperture 3 ) can be installed in order to produce different beam sizes at the entrance of the microwave cavity .",
    "the @xmath10  hfs spectrometer has been designed with an open diameter of since a large acceptance is crucial in view of small @xmath10  production rates .",
    "the amplitude of the oscillating magnetic field @xmath28 has to be sufficiently uniform over the large open diameter in order to guarantee a trajectory - independent state - conversion probability .",
    "this requirement is best met by a cavity of so - called strip - line geometry  @xcite .",
    "two highly transparent meshes confine the microwaves at the entrance and exit of the state - conversion cavity , which are separated by half a wavelength of the hyperfine splitting transition ( @xmath29 ) . a standing wave forms between them and as a consequence @xmath28 is not constant along the beam propagation direction , causing a _ double - dip _ resonance line - shape .",

    "a synthesiser coupled to an external rubidium clock for frequency stabilisation produces microwaves , which are fed radially to the cavity via an antenna after amplification . on the opposite side of the cavity",
    "another antenna is used for pick - up and monitoring of the microwave power ( @xmath33 ) using a spectrum analyser .",
    "helmholtz coils are mounted onto the cavity to generate a homogeneous external magnetostatic field @xmath34 , parallel to @xmath35 , and of several gauss in magnitude at the interaction region for fine control of the zeeman splitting . a current source with a relative stability of supplies the helmholtz coils current @xmath36 , which is independently monitored by an amperemeter .",
    "@xmath36 is directly proportional to @xmath34 and turned out to be a better proxy for the magnetic field inside the cavity than a dedicated external magnetic field measurement .",
    "the microwave cavity and the helmholtz coils are surrounded by a two - layer cuboidal mu - metal shielding to block the earth s magnetic field as well as the fringe field of the closely succeeding superconducting sextupole magnet .",
