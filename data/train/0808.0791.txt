    ".    there exists a proper embedding @xmath7 whose image is a topologically knotted complete minimal surface .    our construction is based on the existence of locally well - behaved fatou - bieberbach domains and on the existence of knotted holomorphic discs in the 4-ball . a fatou - bieberbach domain in @xmath0",

    "indeed , all we need is a knotted proper holomorphic embedding of the closed unit disc @xmath13 that maps @xmath14 to @xmath15 . composing the restriction of this embedding @xmath16 with a biholomorphism @xmath17 yields a knotted proper holomorphic embedding of @xmath12 in  @xmath0 .",
    "the existence of knotted proper holomorphic embeddings @xmath13 is easily established by using the theory of complex algebraic curves in @xmath0 .    we describe the relevant features of the fatou - bieberbach domains needed for our purpose in section  2 .",

    "fatou - bieberbach domains in @xmath0 are usually described by certain infinite processes , for example as domains of convergence of maps defined by sequences of automorphisms .",

    "the class of algebraic links has been generalized by rudolph to the larger class of quasipositive links  @xcite .",
    "using the theory of quasipositive links , it is easy to construct knotted proper holomorphic embedded discs in @xmath11 . in the following , we will give a short description of rudolph s theory ; more details are contained in  @xcite and  @xcite .",

    "if @xmath36 is the closed disc bounded by @xmath52 , then the intersection @xmath71 is a piece of complex plane curve bounded by the link @xmath69 . choosing the polynomial @xmath57 and the curve @xmath52 appropriately , it is possible to arrange @xmath72 to be an embedded disc with a non - trivial quasipositive knot as boundary ( see  @xcite , example 3.2 ) . assuming that @xmath72 is compact , there exists @xmath27 , such that @xmath73 . in order to establish theorem  [ mainthm ]",
    ", it remains to find an example where @xmath72 is knotted in @xmath74 , more precisely @xmath75 in view of lemma  [ lemma1 ] , this will then give rise to a knotted proper holomorphic embedding of the unit disc in @xmath22 , hence in @xmath0 .    here",
    "we choose @xmath8 to be a fatou - bieberbach domain whose intersection @xmath76 is a small @xmath10- perturbation of @xmath74 .",
    "if this perturbation is small enough , then the intersection @xmath77 is still a proper holomorphic embedded disc , as knotted as @xmath72 in @xmath74 .",
    "we conclude this section with a concrete example , in fact rudolph s example  3.2 of  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath78 the complex plane curve @xmath56 is easily seen to be non - singular .",
    "the equation @xmath79 fails to have three distinct solutions @xmath64 , if and only if the two equations @xmath79 and @xmath80 have a simultaneous solution .",

    "thus the set @xmath60 consists of the @xmath82th roots of unity . for @xmath83 ,",
    "the equation @xmath62 has three distinct solutions @xmath84 , which we index by increasing real parts .",
    "further , it will be convenient to determine the set @xmath85 of complex numbers @xmath61 such that the equation @xmath62 has two distinct solutions @xmath64 with coinciding real parts . in our example",
    ", @xmath85 consists of @xmath82 rays emanating from the points of @xmath60 , as shown in figure  1 .",
    "these rays carry labels @xmath67 or @xmath86 , depending on whether the real parts of @xmath87 and @xmath88 or those of @xmath88 and @xmath89 coincide .",
    "there is a way of orienting the rays that corresponds to choosing positive standard generators of the braid group .",
    "figure  1 also indicates a curve @xmath52 that bounds a disc   @xmath90 .",
    "we claim that the piece of complex plane curve @xmath71 is a disc with @xmath91 .",
    "first , we observe that if we ` cut off ' the two ends of the disc @xmath90 of figure  1 , we obtain another disc @xmath92 disjoint from @xmath60 .",
    "the intersection @xmath93 is therefore a disjoint union of three discs . adding the ends to @xmath92",
    "again gives rise to two identifications along the boundaries of these discs .",
    "it is easy to see that these identifications result in a single disc whose boundary @xmath94 is knotted ( actually @xmath69 is the quasipositive ribbon knot @xmath95 ) .",
    "however , the mere fact that @xmath69 is knotted does not imply that the fundamental group of @xmath96 is not isomorphic to @xmath46 ( see the last paragraph of  @xcite )",
    ". we will describe @xmath97 explicitly , in terms of generators and relations .",
    "hereby we will use orevkov s method for presenting the fundamental group of the complement of complex plane curves in @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "to every connected component of @xmath98 ( in our case @xmath99 ) , we assign @xmath63 ( in our case @xmath100 ) generators corresponding to meridians of the @xmath63 discs lying over that component .",
    "every oriented edge of the graph @xmath85 gives rise to @xmath63 relations between the generators of the two ( not necessarily distinct ) components adjacent to that edge .",
    "all these relations are of wirtinger - type ( see  @xcite , lemma  3.1 ) .",
    "let us denote the four connected component of @xmath99 by @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , starting at the bottom left and going clockwise around @xmath90 . to every region @xmath105",
