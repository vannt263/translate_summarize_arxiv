    "chaotic systems show several unexpected and complex dynamics .",
    "`` chaotic itinerancy''@xcite and `` evolution to edge of chaos''@xcite are good examples .",
    "the mysterious role of chaos in neural networks has also been studied extensively@xcite .",
    "however , the origin of such interesting behaviors has not been clarified sufficiently ; because an important feature of complex systems , multistability , has not been discussed explicitly in regard to the chaos .",
    "the studies of multistable systems subject to probabilistic noise have extensively been carried out in the field of reaction - rate theory , which is analyzed as stochastic processes@xcite .",
    "the theory makes it possible to calculate a barrier crossing probability in multistable systems , in which the noise may have a simple time - correlation .",
    "however , this theory also has a difficulty in treating a dynamical noise ( perturbation ) , especially for chaotic noise ; because the theory is based on stochastic processes , in which simple structure of the time - correlation of the noise is necessary for its integrability .",
    "in addition to these background , some chaotic time series have been assumed to be too random to retrieve its deterministic nature in physical systems , because they may have the same randomness even as the coin tosses@xcite .",
    "therefore the effect of chaotic noise has not been recognized as an important property even for a macroscopic physical systems , whereas the chaotic noise has dynamical asymmetry@xcite .    in the recent letter@xcite",
    ", we reported that the short - time correlation of chaotic noise caused by its determinism is unexpectedly important in understanding the dynamics of multistable systems with chaotic structures@xcite . in this paper , we detail the analytical derivation of the barrier crossing probability of the dissipative particle in multistable systems subject to chaotic noise and show that the analytical result is applicable to wider classes of chaotic noise .    we also emphasize in this paper that chaotic noise is a first realization of the effect of dynamical asymmetry of any noise which induces unidirectional motion of a dissipative particle in a _",
    "symmetric _ potential .",
    "this is a new insight in regard to the discussions on the possible mechanism of protein motors by ratchet models@xcite .    in section.ii",
    ", we describe the system in which we will discuss the effect of chaotic noise on the dissipative particle in a periodic potential . in section.iii",
    "we will derive the barrier crossing probability of the dissipative particle over potential barrier , where we use two kinds of generalized chaotic maps for wider application . in section iv",
    ", we show that the present analytical result is applicable both to the chaotic noise which is non - piecewise linear map and to the chaotic noise which has non - uniform invariant density , by using a logistic map chaos , as an example . in section.vi , we summarize our discussions , where we remark the relation of our result to ratchet models of protein motors .",
    "in this section , we describe a system where we argue the effect of chaotic noise on multistable systems .",
    "we discuss a dynamics of a dissipative particle in a periodic potential subject to chaotic noise .",
    "we believe that the present system is a minimal one which shows an effect of chaotic noise on a multistable system clearly .",
    "a dissipative particle in a potential @xmath1 and noise @xmath2 obeys the equation : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is an additive noise . we introduce a chaotic noise : @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a chaotic time series generated by : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a chaotic map .",
    "the potential , @xmath9 , is any periodic potential . in this paper , we report mainly the results of our study using a piecewise linear potential with parity symmetry : @xmath10 for @xmath11 , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a half width of the period of the potential and @xmath14 is a height of the potential barrier .",
    "we consider a system which satisfies the following condition : @xmath15 in this condition , the dissipative particle can move against the gradient of the potential in both direction and the particle staying near a bottom of the potential needs to be driven by chaotic noise many times to cross the potential barrier . in the following",
    "we study a discretized equation , @xmath16 which is approximately obtained by integrating eq.(1 ) from @xmath17 to @xmath18 .",
    "the choice of the finite @xmath19 does not alter the central result as shown in the following .",
    "we show here that the present system is a sufficient one which exhibit an unexpected dynamics under chaotic noise .",
    "we also show that the central result is not altered if the potential is not piecewise linear . for the purpose , although this paper is intended to discuss the effect of a general chaotic noise , we briefly summarize the qualitative result of the symmetry breaking dynamics by using the tent map chaos@xcite , @xmath20 .",
    "the tent map chaos has a uniform invariant density with parity symmetry , @xmath21 [ for @xmath22 , otherwise @xmath23 ] and @xmath24 correlated@xcite , these properties of which are the same as the uniform random number , @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "the tent map chaos is one of the most random chaotic sequences which have the same randomness as the coin tosses . therefore the macroscopically broken parity dynamics induced by this apparently symmetric chaotic noise had never been realized explicitly before our discovery , to our knowledge .",
    "as found in the previous letter@xcite , the chaotic noise generated by this tent map can induce a broken symmetry dynamics of a dissipative particle even in a symmetric multistable system .",
    "it is easily verified that the qualitative results , namely , the broken symmetry dynamics , are the same both for a smooth periodic potential and for a piecewise linear potential ( fig.2 ) . if we replace the piecewise linear potential , @xmath9 , with the sinusoidal potential having the same amplitude and the period , @xmath27 ; the direction in which the particle moves does not change .",
    "the quantitative difference of the velocity as shown in figure 1 can be attributed to the difference of the absolute maximum gradients of the potentials : @xmath28 .",
    "it can also be verified that a choice of @xmath29 does not essentially alter the time evolution of the dissipative particle ( fig.2 ) .",
    "in this section , we argue a barrier crossing probability of a particle in a periodic potential subject to chaotic noise@xcite . an average velocity of the particle is expressed in terms of the barrier crossing probabilities :",
    "@xmath30 where @xmath31 is a barrier crossing probability in a positive direction caused by a process , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 is that in a negative direction .",
    "as is found later , the average velocity is often dominated by one barrier crossing probability , p : @xmath34 .",
    "when the slope of the potential is large enough , a particle is found mostly in the neighborhood of one of the basins of the potential .",
    "therefore , the particle needs to be forced continuously by the noise having the coherent values to cross the barrier .",
    "chaotic noise works effectively for the barrier crossing when the noise stays in the neighborhood of an unstable fixed point , @xmath35 .",
    "there are two types of the chaotic sequences staying near an unstable fixed point : one is the chaotic sequence leaving the unstable fixed point monotonically in its stay and the other is the sequence leaving it with oscillation .",
    "first , we discuss the former case which is relatively simple to treat .    in this paper ,",
    "we have restricted ourselves for the chaotic noise in which the two successive events of clustering around an unstable fixed point is not strongly correlated ; in other words , the successive clustering does not occurs without a sufficient intermission .",
    "however , there exists a case where the two successive events can be strongly correlated .",
    "bernoulli shift chaos is the case@xcite .",
    "we will not discuss the complex case in this paper .",
    "the study is under way .      as shown in fig.([fig:1 ] ) , the nearer the injected chaotic noise @xmath2 is to the unstable fixed point @xmath35 , the longer @xmath2 stays in the neighborhood of @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , we have to calculate first how near the chaotic noise needs to be injected in the neighborhood of an unstable fixed point for the particle to cross the barrier .    in the following ,",
    "we calculate the maximum distance @xmath36 between an injected chaotic noise and an unstable fixed point , for the barrier crossing . the maximum distance , @xmath36 , is necessary to obtain the barrier crossing probability for the particle under chaotic noise . to make the following discussion applicable to wider classes of chaotic maps , we investigate the effect of a chaotic noise generated by a generalized piecewise linear map , which is characterized by the absolute value of the slope of the map , @xmath37 , and an unstable fixed point , @xmath35 .    in a system which satisfies eq.([ine",
    "] ) , the particle is mostly found near one of the bottoms of the potential .",
    "therefore we assume that the particle is at an origin of the @xmath38-coordinate at discrete time , @xmath39 , namely , @xmath40 , when the chaotic noise starts to drive the particle to cross the potential barrier .",
    "we also assume that the particle crosses the barrier by n ( @xmath41 ) time steps .",
    "the nearer the chaotic sequence , @xmath42 , is injected to an unstable fixed point , the longer the particle continues to climb the potential .",
    "if the particle moves over a half width of the potential , @xmath13 , within @xmath43 time steps , we judge that the particle crosses the potential barrier . in this consideration",
    ", we calculate the maximum distance @xmath44 for the barrier crossing due to the effect of an unstable fixed point , as a function of @xmath35 , @xmath37 , @xmath14 and @xmath13 .",
    "note that the slope of the potential @xmath45 because the fixed point @xmath35 is unstable .    from the conditions",
    ", we write the following inequality in which the particle can cross the barrier : @xmath46 @xmath47 where we assume that the sign of @xmath2 is plus for simplicity ; but the following result is also valid for negative @xmath2 by replacing it with an absolute value of @xmath2 . in such a case , the direction of the velocity of the particle is reversed .",
    "let us set @xmath48 then one finds , @xmath49 we obtain through eq.([eq:3 ] ) : @xmath50 where we use an approximation that @xmath40 .",
    "inserting eq.([eq : a4 ] ) into eq.([eq : a5 ] ) and using eq.([eq : a2 ] ) , one obtains @xmath51 inserting eq.([eq : a4 ] ) into eq.([eq : a1 ] ) , we get @xmath52 eq.([eq : a7 ] ) gives the maximum @xmath43 for which the noise keeps driving the particle upward against the potential as a function of @xmath35 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , @xmath55 + 1 .",

    "limit the simple expression of the maximum distance @xmath36 , which is comparable to the scaling of the barrier crossing probability p shown in the previous letter@xcite , is obtained .",
    "first , we rewrite the maximum distance , @xmath36 , obtained in eq.([eq : lo1 ] ) : @xmath63 where @xmath64 by the following limits , we get : @xmath65",
    "@xmath66    this yields the same scaling expression as the barrier crossing probability in the previous letter@xcite : @xmath67 if @xmath68 . the first limit in eq.([eq : f1 ] ) is valid if the width of the potential barrier is sufficiently large . the second in eq.([sameprl",
    "] ) is valid if the the effect of the potential gradient is sufficiently small .      in this subsection , we discuss the maximum distance , @xmath36 , for the case that the chaotic noise leaves an unstable fixed point with oscillation ( fig.([fig:2 ] ) ) . in a similar way as eq.([eq : a1 ] ) and eq.([eq : a2 ] ) , we write the inequalities in which the particle can cross the potential barrier : @xmath69 @xmath70 the chaotic noise works to drive the particle against the gradient of the potential up to @xmath71 if eq.([eq : b1 ] ) is satisfied . one finds that the noise may drive the particle against the potential , even if eq.([eq : b1 ] ) is not satisfied : this happens when @xmath72 .",
    "however , this ambiguity in the inequality ( eq.(20 ) ) does not change the following result of @xmath36 without a pre - factor as shown later ( eq.([eq : bd1 ] ) and eq.([eq : bd2 ] ) ) .",
    "let us set @xmath73 then one finds , @xmath74 we obtain through eq.([eq:3 ] ) : @xmath75 by setting @xmath40 .",
    "one obtains from eq.([eq : b4 ] ) @xmath76 where @xmath77 means an average over the sign , @xmath78 , of @xmath79 . by use of this averaging procedure , eq.([eq : b5 ] )",
    "is replaced by @xmath80 inserting eq.([eq : bc1 ] ) into eq.([eq : b2 ] ) , one obtains @xmath81 inserting eq.([eq : b4 ] ) into eq.([eq : b1 ] ) , we get @xmath82 eq.([eq : b7 ] ) gives the maximum @xmath43 for which the noise keeps driving the particle upward against the potential as a function of @xmath35 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "replacing @xmath43 of eq.([eq : b6 ] ) by @xmath83 , we obtain the maximum value of @xmath53 for which eq.([eq : b2 ] ) is satisfied , that the particle crosses the peak and makes transition : @xmath84 where we used an approximation for @xmath85 .    by the following limits , we get simpler expressions of @xmath36 like eq.([eq : f1 ] ) and eq.([sameprl ] ) : @xmath86 the last expression is the same as that obtained for the chaotic noise which monotonically leaves an unstable fixed point ( eq.([sameprl ] ) ) .",
    "we note that the main result is not altered even if _ r.h.s .",
    "_ of eq.([eq : b1 ] ) is replaced by an arbitrary constant , @xmath87 : namely , @xmath88 in this case , we obtain @xmath89 which is the same as the previous expression ( eq.([eq : e1 ] ) ) without a pre - factor , @xmath87 .      in this subsection",
    "we argue the relationship between the maximum distance , @xmath36 , and the barrier crossing probability .",
    "first , we restrict ourselves to the chaotic noise generated by the tent map function for demonstration .",
    "this function has two unstable fixed points , @xmath90 and @xmath91 , the effect of which corresponds to the case of fig.([fig:1 ] ) and fig.([fig:2 ] ) respectively .",
    "the former case is discussed here ( fig.([fig : tenta ] ) ) .",
    "suppose that the barrier crossing event of the particle starts when the chaotic noise is injected in the @xmath53-neighbor of the unstable fixed point , @xmath35 .",
    "then the event occurs only when the chaotic noise was in an interval , @xmath92 , just before the start of the barrier crossing as shown in fig.([fig : tenta ] ) .",
    "thus , the sum of the invariant density over the interval , @xmath92 , gives the barrier crossing probability@xcite .",
    "therefore , we get the barrier crossing probability of the particle in a negative direction caused by the effect of the unstable fixed point , @xmath93 , of the tent map function : @xmath94 because the invariant density of the tent map function is uniform : @xmath95 .    the barrier crossing probability in a positive direction caused by @xmath96 can be obtained in the same way ( fig.([inj2 ] ) ) .",
    "however , the barrier crossing probability in a positive direction is much smaller than that in a negative direction , because the amplitude of the unstable fixed point , @xmath96 , in a positive direction is much smaller than that in a negative direction : @xmath97 .",
    "this is immediately be confirmed by the expression : @xmath98 ( see eq.([sameprl ] ) and eq.([eq : f3 ] ) ) .",
    "therefore , the effect of one unstable fixed point , @xmath99 , dominates the overall barrier crossing probability of the system with a sufficient barrier width , @xmath13 .",
    "the comparison between the analytical result and the numerical one is shown for the noise generated by the tent map chaos ( fig.[add ] ) .",
    "the present theory sufficiently predicts the exponential decrease rate of the barrier crossing probability as to the potential width , @xmath13 , for @xmath100 .",
    "the disagreement of the constant factor especially for the case , @xmath101 , may be attributed to the ambiguity of the assumption of the initial condition of the particle : @xmath40 .",
    "when the chaotic noise is generated by the tent map , the noise drives the particle by @xmath102 in the positive direction just before the coherent drives caused by @xmath103 in a negative direction for the barrier crossing .",
    "the more the slope of the potential is , the stronger this effect works , because this anti - drive effect due to @xmath102 needs additional kicks in a negative direction for the noise to drive the particle , roughly equal to @xmath104 as similar as in the next subsection .    in general ,",
    "the invariant density of a chaotic map is not uniform@xcite .",
    "thus , a simple analytical expression of the barrier crossing probability can not generally be obtained .",
    "we derive a formal solution of the barrier crossing probability .",
    "let a set @xmath105 : @xmath106 and @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the @xmath53 neighborhood of an unstable fixed point , @xmath35 , and @xmath8 is a chaotic map .",
    "then , the sum of the invariant density over a set @xmath105 gives the desired expression of the barrier crossing probability : @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the invariant density of the chaotic map .",
    "if the invariant density of a chaotic map in the region , @xmath105 , is so smooth that it can be approximated by a constant in the small region , the scaling form of the barrier crossing probability , @xmath111 , is the same as that of @xmath36 without a pre - factor ( such as @xmath112 ) .",
    "this explains the coincidence of the scaling forms between @xmath36 ( eq.([sameprl ] ) ) and the barrier crossing probability , @xmath111 ( eq.([eq : prl ] ) ) .",
    "the analytical result of the barrier crossing probability is easily understandable by a physical insight .",
    "as mentioned in the last subsection , the barrier crossing probability and the critical distance , @xmath36 , can have the same scaling form for several kinds of chaotic noise of which an invariant density is so smooth that it can be approximated by a constant in a small region , @xmath105 , for the injection to the unstable fixed point .",
    "we discuss this case for simplicity .",
    "then , the scaling form of the barrier crossing probability as in eq.([eq : f1 ] ) and in eq.([eq : f3 ] ) is : @xmath113 the factor , @xmath114 , is a displacement of the particle when the particle is kicked by one chaotic noise at an unstable fixed point . therefore the value , @xmath104 , gives the number of the kicks necessary for the particle at a basin of the potential to cross the potential barrier ; where we used an approximation that a chaotic noise has almost the same value as the unstable fixed point , @xmath35 , during the condition , eq.([eq : a1 ] ) or eq.([eq : b1 ] ) , is satisfied .",
    "the approximation can be justified at least for the piecewise linear maps , as found in the analytical derivation of the barrier crossing probability .",
    "because the value , @xmath104 , gives the number of the necessary kicks by chaotic noise , we can understand the exponential dependence of the barrier crossing probability on the value , @xmath104 .",
    "suppose that @xmath115 which satisfies eq.([eq : a1 ] ) or eq.([eq : b1 ] ) and the particle crosses the barrier . if the factor , @xmath116 , increases by one , the following inequality for the noise , @xmath117 , must be satisfied for the barrier crossing : @xmath118 because eq.([eq : g ] ) is equivalent to @xmath119 , where the noise continues to drive the particle @xmath43 times after @xmath120 .",
    "thus the unit increase of @xmath116 decreases the measure of set @xmath105 by @xmath112 .",
    "therefore , the barrier crossing probability depends exponentially on the value , @xmath104 , with the base , @xmath37 , when the distribution of the invariant density is sufficiently smooth .",
    "in the previous discussions including ref.@xcite , we have argued only the effect of chaotic noise generated by a piecewise linear map with uniform invariant density .",
    "therefore we consider in this section the validity of the present analytical results by applying them to the map which is a non - piecewise linear map and has a non - uniform invariant density .",
    "for this purpose , we use a logistic map@xcite as a chaotic noise , because an analytical expression of the invariant density is available . the chaotic sequence of the logistic map appears as follows : @xmath121 the invariant density of the logistic map is , @xmath122 , @xmath123 $ ] .",
    "because an analytical expressions of @xmath36 for the barrier crossing probability were derived only for a piecewise linear map , we have to make an approximation to obtain the barrier crossing probability induced by the logistic map .",
    "as noted previously , the clustering event of chaotic noise near an unstable fixed point occurs when @xmath42 is injected near to the unstable fixed point .",
    "therefore , it seems valid to linearize the logistic map around an unstable fixed point ( @xmath124 ) and the corresponding region ( @xmath125 ) to be injected near to the unstable fixed point . with this procedure",
    ", we get the linearized slope of the map : @xmath126 ( see fig.[fig : logi ] ) .    by use of this approximation",
    ", we can evaluate the barrier crossing probability for a non - uniform invariant density by using eq.([eq : lo2 ] ) .",
    "the set @xmath105 of eq.([eq : lo2 ] ) is : @xmath127 .",
    "therefore , we get an analytical expression of the barrier crossing probability : @xmath128 where @xmath36 is given by eq.([eq : lo1 ] ) .    the theoretical barrier crossing probabilities of the logistic map are shown with the numerically obtained barrier crossing probabilities ( fig.[fig : logidata ] ) .",
    "the data of the larger slope of the potential ( @xmath129 ) agree better with the theoretical predictions ( eq.([theorlo ] ) ) than that of @xmath130 .",
    "the disagreement for the smaller slope of the potential may be attributed to the assumption of the present theory that the particle should start climbing from @xmath40 when the chaotic sequence is injected near to an unstable fixed point .",
    "if the slope of the potential is small , the particle fluctuates much around one of the bottoms of the periodic potential .",
    "this fluctuation effect caused by the logistic map may be strong because the invariant density goes to infinity at both edges of the map , @xmath131 : this decreases the validity of the assumption of the present theory .",
    "we showed in this paper a new macroscopic feature of chaotic dynamics emerging in a multistable system : the effect of chaotic noise on the multistable system is attributed to its unstable fixed points , which reminds us of the deterministic nature of chaos .",
    "the new feature appears effectively in a multistable system when the slope of the unstable fixed point of the noise , @xmath37 , is near the `` edge of chaos '' , because the local lyapunov index , @xmath132 , at the unstable fixed point is @xmath133@xcite .",
    "this is consistent at least with recent literature of neural networks@xcite    the unidirectional motion of the dissipative particle in a periodic potential has been discussed in relation to the dynamics of motor proteins@xcite .",
    "we showed that the unidirectional motion can be induced by an apparently symmetric chaotic noise even if the particle is in a symmetric multistable potential .",
    "similar results have recently appeared with several variations@xcite after our first report@xcite .",
    "the authors of the papers claim that the unidirectional motion can occur in a symmetric multistable potential if an additive noise is `` temporally asymmetric . ''",
    "however , the asymmetric effect of the noises they used can be attributed to asymmetric distribution of the probability density of the noise . in this sense",
    ", the effect of the _ temporally asymmetric _ noise is rather static , and thus the effect of `` temporally asymmetry , '' should be discriminated from that of `` dynamical asymmetry . ''",
    "finally , we mention that the present analytical method to estimate barrier crossing probabilities may be applied to the escape rate problem induced by other types of time correlation of the fluctuation including an intermittent chaos and non - chaotic time series : the escape rate is found to be strongly dependent on the _ transient _ time - correlation of the additive noise@xcite .",

    "<S> in a recent letter [ phys.rev.lett . * 30 * , 3269 ( 1995 ) ] , we reported that a macroscopic chaotic determinism emerges in a multistable system : the unidirectional motion of a dissipative particle subject to an apparently symmetric chaotic noise occurs even if the particle is in a spatially symmetric potential . in this paper , we study the global dynamics of a dissipative particle by investigating the barrier crossing probability of the particle between two basins of the multistable potential . </S>",
    "<S> we derive analytically an expression of the barrier crossing probability of the particle subject to a chaotic noise generated by a general piecewise linear map . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the obtained analytical barrier crossing probability is applicable to a chaotic noise generated not only by a piecewise linear map with a uniform invariant density but also by a non - piecewise linear map with non - uniform invariant density . </S>",
    "<S> we claim , from the viewpoint of the noise induced motion in a multistable system , that chaotic noise is a first realization of the effect of _ dynamical asymmetry _ of general noise which induces the symmetry breaking dynamics .    </S>",
