    "understanding the distribution of mass on large scales is a fundamental quest in cosmology .",
    "how does it compare with the distribution of stars , light , and gas ?",
    "we know that individual galaxies are surrounded by large dark matter halos , and that groups and clusters of galaxies are dominated by dark matter comprising five to ten times more mass than baryonic matter ( stars and gas ) .",
    "it is generally believed that the relative contribution of dark matter increases with scale  from galaxies , to groups , to clusters , and to large - scale structure ; larger scale systems are believed to contain more dark matter , relative to light or stars , than do galaxies ( @xcite ; and more recently @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we investigate the distribution of mass , light , and stars and explore how light and stars trace mass as a function of environment and scale .",
    "we discuss the implications for the disribution of dark matter and for the stellar mass fraction .",
    "one of the classical methods to investigate the distribution of mass in the universe is to compare it directly with the distribution of stellar light : how does mass follow light ?",
    "this method was first used on large scales by @xcite ; this was followed by many additional investigations ( see @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "the comparison between the distribution of mass and light is represented by the mass - to - light ratio , @xmath3 , which can be studied as a function of scale and environment .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and others showed that @xmath3 increases systematically with scale , from the small scale of galaxies to the larger scale of groups , clusters , and larger scale structure , indicating a growing dominance of dark matter with scale ( see also @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite investigated the overall @xmath2 function from galaxies to large scales , separating galaxies into ellipticals ( older ) and spirals ( younger ) .",
    "they showed that @xmath2 rises from the small scales of galaxies up to a few hundred kpc , reflecting the large dark matter halos around galaxies , then flattens to a constant value , where light approximately traces mass , with comparable relative contribution of dark matter on all scales .",
    "@xcite thus suggest that most of the dark matter in the universe may be located in the large dark matter halos around individual galaxies and that the dark matter in groups and clusters may simply be the sum of their individual galaxy members ( plus gas ) .",
    "more recently , @xcite used gravitational lensing observations of clusters from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and found a similar trend of increasing @xmath3 with radius that flattens on scales of several mpc .",
    "the flattening of @xmath3 on large scales indicates that light follows mass on these scales and the @xmath3 ratio approaches a mean cosmic value @xcite .",
    "in this paper we use the sdss observations of weak lensing mass and the observed distribution of light around 132,473 stacked groups and clusters of galaxies at @xmath11 @xcite to analyze the mass - to - light profile as a function of environment , from small groups of a few galaxies to the richest clusters , and as a function of scale , from the small scale of 25 kpc inside clusters to large cosmic scales of @xmath12 mpc .",
    "these scales reach to @xmath13 virial radii of the systems , well into the large - scale cosmic environment .",
    "we investigate how light traces mass on these scales , how the @xmath3 profile is affected by the varying stellar population , and how the stars trace the underlying mass distribution .",
    "we estimate the approximate stellar mass fraction as a function of environment and scale . we show that light and stars trace mass on scales above several hundred kpc , and that the mean stellar mass fraction is nearly constant on all these scales in all environments , @xmath7 (  [ d4 ] ) .",
    "we further show that most of the dark matter may be located in the large halos around individual galaxies (  [ d3 ] ) .",
    "we discuss the data in  [ data ] and the analysis and results in  [ results ] .",
    "we investigate the contribution of individual galaxies to the total @xmath14 function in ",
    "[ d3 ] , determine the distribution of the stellar mass fraction in ",
    "[ d4 ] , and calculate @xmath15 in  [ d5 ] .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in  [ conclusions ] .",
    "we use a flat @xmath16cdm cosmology with @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 km / s / mpc ( where @xmath20 should be inserted for @xmath16cdm ; @xcite ) .",
    "the maxbcg cluster catalog @xcite was obtained from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) data release 4 @xcite .",
    "the cluster finder is based on the red - sequence method ; it maximizes the likelihood that a galaxy is a brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) at the center of an overdensity of red - sequence galaxies @xcite .",
    "all clusters are selected from a 7500 deg@xmath21 region on the sky and are in the photometric redshift range @xmath11 .",
    "the cluster richness @xmath22 is defined by the number of galaxies on the red sequence with rest - frame @xmath23-band luminosity @xmath24 located within a radius @xmath25 from the bcg ( where the @xmath23-band @xmath9 is the @xmath26 value from @xcite , corresponding to @xmath27 , and @xmath25 is the radius within which the local galaxy overdensity is 200 ; see @xcite ) .",
    "the radius @xmath25 , which is used only to define the cluster richness @xmath28 , differs from the @xmath29 we use throughout this paper , which defines a mass overdensity of 200 times the critical density .",
    "the published catalog contains 13,823 clusters with @xmath30 ; @xcite ( hereafter ) augment the catalog to include small groups of galaxies with @xmath31 , resulting in a sample of 132,473 groups and clusters with @xmath32 .",
    "the cluster photometric redshifts are accurate to @xmath33 , with a scatter of @xmath34 for @xmath30 , degrading to @xmath35 for the poorest systems , with the same accuracy .",
    "the cluster sample was partitioned into 12 richness bins ranging from small groups with @xmath36 to the richest clusters with @xmath37 ( @xcite ; hereafter ) .",
    "the number of clusters per bin decreases from 58,788 for the poorest bin to 47 for the richest .",
    "the weak lensing mass measurements were carried out by and on the stacked clusters in each richness bin , all centered on the cluster bcg . because lensing is not sensitive to a uniform mass distribution ( `` mass sheet '' ) , the measured mass reflects the mean mass density of the lens sample above the mean density of the universe .",
    "the average tangential shear of background galaxies due to lensing by the foreground stacked clusters was measured by and used to calculate the mass density distribution around the clusters as a function of projected radius from the center out to scales of @xmath38 mpc . made corrections to the density profile for contamination of the lensed sample by cluster members and residual additive biases in the tangential shear .",
    "the mass density contrast of the lensing clusters in each richness bin was measured in logarithmically spaced bins of projected clustercentric radius from @xmath39kpc to @xmath40mpc .",
    "the 2d density contrast profile was then deprojected to a 3d density excess profile @xmath41 using an abel inversion ( see for details ) .",
    "this measurement reflects the cluster - mass cross - correlation function times the mean density of the universe , @xmath42 .",
    "this was used to calculate the cumulative excess mass @xmath43 within each radius @xmath44 , as well as to find @xmath29 , the radius within which the average mass density is 200 times the critical density .",
    "we correct the mass profiles presented by @xcite ( hereafter ) for an improved photometric redshift distribution of the lensed background galaxies ; a full description is given in  [ data5 ] .",
    "the light distribution around the stacked clusters , using galaxy luminosities as defined below , was measured ( by ) as a function of radius for the same scales as above , from @xmath45 kpc to @xmath46 mpc .",
    "a uniform background was subtracted using similar measurements around random points .",
    "the luminosity measured reflects the luminosity density of the systems above the mean , @xmath47 , thus representing the cluster - light cross - correlation function as a function of radius , @xmath48 , comparable to the mass measurements described above .",
    "all galaxy luminosities used are in the @xmath23-band , with k - correction applied to bring them to the mean cluster redshift of @xmath49 ; these are denoted @xmath50 .",
    "all galaxy magnitudes are sdss model magnitudes .",
    "a volume and magnitude limited sample of galaxies was chosen with @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the projected luminosity profiles discussed above were inverted to obtain the 3d luminosity density profile , similar to the mass inversion .",
    "this was then integrated to obtain the excess cumulative luminosity @xmath53 within the same clustercentric radial bins as above , from @xmath54kpc to @xmath1mpc . because the luminosity density was not measured within the innermost @xmath45kpc where the bcg is located , the average luminosity of the bcg in each stacked richness bin was added to the cumulative luminosity , so that the central @xmath55 is included in the light ( see for more details ) .      the excess mass within radius @xmath44 from the center of the stacked clusters , @xmath56 , divided by the excess luminosity within radius @xmath44 , @xmath57 , gives the mass - to - light ratio @xmath58 \\",

    "the bias factor @xmath61 depends on the ratio of the bias of clusters relative to mass and light , @xmath62 , which is near unity since the cluster bias essentially cancels out in this ratio .",
    "the bias of the galaxy tracers relative to the mass , @xmath63 , is @xmath64 for galaxies near @xmath9 @xcite and varies very slowly for galaxies below @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "since the luminosity threshold of the galaxy tracers is only @xmath65 ( and the mean luminosity of all the galaxies within @xmath66mpc is @xmath67 ) , this implies a bias of 1.05 ( for @xmath68 ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus , on large scales , @xmath69 should approach a constant value , representing the cosmic mass - to - light ratio ( with only minor bias correction ) .",
    "we correct the lensing masses of and using the correction from @xcite that reflects an improved treatment of the photometric redshift distribution of the background source galaxies based on a detailed analysis by @xcite .",
    "this correction increases the lensing mass by @xmath70 ( _ stat . _ ) @xmath71 ( _ sys . _ ) .",
    "we also correct the @xmath29 values by the small correction needed ( @xmath72 ) due to this mass increase .    the mass and luminosity determinations discussed above use bcgs as the center for the stacked clusters .",
    "if the bcg is slightly offset from the center of the cluster ( e.g. , @xcite ) , both the lensing mass and luminosity in the central regions will be slightly underestimated ( relative to the central mass and light of the cluster dark matter halo ) although the effect will partially cancel in the mass - to - light ratio .",
    "the effect is strongest near the center of the clusters , as well as in poor groups for which miscentering is more likely to occur .",
    "however , the effect is negligible on large scales .",
    "discussion of the effect can be found in , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we do not correct for this effect as the corrections are uncertain and are typically small ( except in the poorest groups ) ; they are not important for our main goal of understanding the behavior of the mass - to - light profile on larger scales .",
    "our results thus reflect the mass - to - light ratio around bcg galaxies , not necessarily around the center of the dark matter halos , especially for small groups .    we further note that unless otherwise stated ( e.g. ,  [ d2 ] - [ d4 ] ) the luminosity accounts only for galaxies above the luminosity threshold of @xmath73 , as discussed above",
    ". it does not include the entire luminosity of the systems .",
    "this is discussed in  [ d2 ] .",
    "we combine the twelve stacked bins of groups and clusters (  [ data ] ) into three broader richness bins to study the overall @xmath74 as a function of radius around poor ( @xmath75 ) , intermediate ( @xmath76 ) , and rich ( @xmath77 ) systems .",
    "we use the same radial bins as in .",
    "we investigate both the cumulative @xmath78 , and the local , differential mass - to - light profile , @xmath79 . for simplicity",
    ", we refer to these as @xmath80 and @xmath81 , respectively .",
    "the integrated mass - to - light profile @xmath80 is presented in figure [ graph : graph100 ] as a function of radius from @xmath82kpc to @xmath83mpc for each of the three richness bins .",
    "the observed increase of @xmath80 with radius on small scales is caused by the central bcg galaxy which dominates the cluster luminosity in the central regions ( typically @xmath84 kpc ) : these regions reflect primarily @xmath80 of the bcg galaxy .",
    "the three top curves in figure [ graph : graph100 ] present @xmath80 when the mean bcg luminosity is excluded from each richness bin , revealing the impact of the bcg .",
    "a comparison of the two sets of curves shows that the bcg luminosity accounts for the increasing @xmath80 in the central regions , and has negligible effect on the mass - to - light ratio on large scales . when the bcg light is excluded , the integrated mass - to - light profile is nearly flat on all scales , except for the rise on small scales that results from excluding the light ( i.e. , @xmath85 ) but not the mass .",
    "if we further exclude the mass within the central region ( see below ) , @xmath86 flattens on all scales . on large scales",
    "@xmath80 is essentially independent of cluster richness ; all environments , from the smallest groups to the richest clusters , exhibit the same overall mass - to - light ratio , reaching a universal value on scales of a few mpc . on intermediate scales of @xmath87mpc , while @xmath80 is nearly flat , small differences are observed as a function of richness and radius .",
    "we discuss these trends below and show that they are consistent with the varying mean stellar population age as a function of richness and radius .",
    "the rise in @xmath88 on small scales is considerably faster for rich clusters than for poor groups ( figure [ graph : graph100 ] ) .",
    "rich clusters reach a nearly flat @xmath80 distribution at only @xmath89mpc ( typically near the edge of the bright bcg ) .",
    "poor groups have a slow rise of @xmath80 with radius : the bcg luminosity dominates the group s luminosity and thus @xmath86 to scales of a few mpc .",
    "this is because the bcg luminosity , while known to increase with cluster richness ( @xmath90 ; @xcite ) , is considerably more dominant in poor groups ( @xmath91 ; @xcite ) .",
    "this is easily understood : in a poor group of a few galaxies , the bcg typically contains most of the group luminosity ; as the group s luminosity @xmath92 is integrated over radius , the bcg light dominates the group luminosity to large scales . in rich clusters , on the other hand , the bcg is brighter but constitutes only a small fraction of the total cluster luminosity at nearly all scales outside the innermost region .    , for poor ( @xmath75 ) , intermediate ( @xmath93 ) , and rich ( @xmath77 ) clusters .",
    "the dashed curves and related points show @xmath3 including both the light and mass of the central bcg , whereas the solid curves and related points show @xmath94 excluding the bcg light . ]    , outside the central regions , with the bcg light and central mass excluded ( see  [ results ] ) . ]    because the effect of the bcg is dominant in the innermost regions , and our interest is mostly in understanding the general behavior of @xmath86 on larger scales , we present in figure [ graph : graph200 ] the cumulative @xmath95 profile excluding both the central bcg luminosity ( as in fig . [",
    "graph : graph100 ] ) as well as the central mass . for the latter ,",
    "we exclude all the mass within a central radius of 50 @xmath96 kpc for the poorest systems ( which have the smallest bcgs ) up to 150 @xmath96 kpc for the richest clusters . selecting somewhat different radii for the central mass exclusion",
    "has only a small effect on the overall @xmath86 profiles ( e.g. , compare with figure [ graph : graph100 ] where no central mass has been excluded ) ; it does not affect the main results discussed below .",
    "the @xmath86 profile outside the innermost regions ( figure [ graph : graph200 ] ) shows a nearly flat distribution on all scales , for all systems rich and poor , from the surprisingly small scale of few hundred kpc to the largest cosmic scales at 22 @xmath96 mpc .",
    "the fact that the distribution is nearly flat on all scales indicates that stars , which make up only a few percent of the total mass , trace the distribution of mass well .    while @xmath86 is nearly flat",
    ", we observe a small trend with richness and with radius : @xmath86 increases slightly with richness at a given radius ( on scales of @xmath97 mpc ) , and decreases slightly with radius ( up to few mpc ) for all richnesses . as we show below",
    ", these trends are consistent with the different mix of stellar populations  old in e / s0 galaxies and younger in spiral galaxies  as a function of radius and richness . following the density - morphology relation @xcite , the fraction of e / s0 galaxies is high in high - density regions ( rich clusters ) , and decreases with radius and richness to the lower density regions on larger scales and in poorer groups . since",
    "early - type galaxies are dominated by an old stellar population with negligible recent star formation , their @xmath98 ratio is larger ( by a factor of @xmath99 ; see below ) than that of the younger stellar population of spiral galaxies , whose luminosities are dominated by bright young stars . as the fraction of spirals increases with radius , the integrated @xmath74 of the cluster decreases slowly with radius , as observed .",
    "the small increase of @xmath74 from poor to rich clusters at a given radius ( figure [ graph : graph200 ] ) reflects partly the same effect : at a given radius a more massive cluster is generally at a smaller multiple of its virial radius , and thus a higher density , so it is dominated by a larger fraction of old e / s0s with higher @xmath3 .    , outside the innermost cluster regions ( bcg mass and light excluded ) .",
    "same as figure [ graph : graph200 ] , but plotted against the clustercentric radius in units of @xmath29 .",

    "the dashed line shows the expected trend of the varying stellar population ( see text ) . for clarity ,",
    "only a representative error bar is shown . ]",
    "figures [ graph : graph300 ] and [ graph : graph400 ] present the cumulative and local ( differential ) mass - to - light profiles , respectively , as a function of radius in units of the physical scale of the system , @xmath100 , from small scales to nearly 40@xmath29 . in figure",
    "[ graph : graph300 ] , we again exclude the bcg luminosity and the innermost mass in order to better understand the overall trend of @xmath86 without the dominant impact of the bcg .",
    "the differential analysis ( figure [ graph : graph400 ] ) is independent of the bcg , except in the very central region , since it reflects the local @xmath101 ratio at any radius .",
    "the results in both figures highlight the similarity of @xmath102 for all systems and on all scales .",
    "mass and light appear to follow each other  especially when accounting for the stellar population age  from deep inside clusters ( outside their bcg cores ) out to large cosmic scales .",
    "figure [ graph : graph450 ] presents the observed profiles of the mass density , luminosity density , and galaxy number density for all environments as a function of @xmath100 .",
    "the profiles are nearly identical , independent of richness .",
    "this similarity of profiles is equivalent to the similar @xmath101 profile observed for all systems as shown above .",
    "since @xmath100 corresponds to a similar overdensity for all systems , no significant stellar population effect is expected between the different richness bins , and none is observed .",
    "the richest clusters show a slightly higher cumulative @xmath86 at @xmath103 ( figure [ graph : graph300 ] ) .",
    "this is caused by a somewhat higher @xmath3 at the very center of the clusters , which may reflect a higher central mass concentration relative to luminosity in the innermost regions of the richest systems ( e.g. , more massive or extended bcgs than our central mass exclusion and/or loss of luminosity due to merging ) .",
    "the @xmath101 profile ( figure [ graph : graph400 ] ) is similar for all richness groups and on all scales starting from deep inside clusters ( @xmath104 ) ; the profile decreases slowly with radius , by a factor of @xmath105 , from small scales up to several @xmath29 and remains flat thereafter to nearly @xmath106 .",
    "this trend is consistent with the stellar population mix , which we quantify below .",
    "we use the mean observed relative stellar @xmath107 ratio of early - type versus spiral galaxies of @xmath108 @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with @xcite single stellar population synthesis models with ages 10 gyr versus 4 gyr , the approximate mean ages of stellar populations in e / s0 and spiral galaxies ( albeit with much scatter ; see @xcite ) .",
    "we combine this ratio with the mean fraction of early and late type galaxies using the density - morphology relation discussed above . here",
    "we use a typical e / s0 fraction of 40% on large - scales ( @xmath109 ) , increasing to 90% in the central high - density regions of groups and clusters ( @xmath110 ) .",
    "the resulting mass - to - light ratio then decreases by a factor of @xmath111 from the centers of clusters to the lower densities on large scales .",
    "this is presented by the dashed lines in figures [ graph : graph300 ] and [ graph : graph400 ] ( for the cumulative and differential functions , respectively ) .",
    "this expected trend agrees well with the observed @xmath74 profile for all systems , suggesting that the small decline in @xmath74 as a function of scale can be accounted for by the different stellar population .",
    "clusters have a strong spatial auto - correlation function and are located in high - density regions with a higher density of older galaxies that extends to large scales ; this is likely the reason that the high @xmath101 ratio persist to several @xmath29 before dropping to a lower more constant field value on large scales .",
    "the typical cluster correlation scale is @xmath112 @xcite for both poor and rich clusters ; this is shown by the vertical band in figures [ graph : graph300 ] and [ graph : graph400 ] . while @xmath3 reaches the cosmic value on these large scales , we emphasize that when the stellar population age is accounted for , all systems exhibit the same mean mass - to - light ratio on all scales .",

    "the stellar population effect as a function of @xmath124 for the 3.1 mpc radius is shown by the dotted line ; it agrees well with the observed @xmath3 function , except for the richest clusters , which as described above contain an increased amount of mass compared to light at their very centers . here",
    ", the slow increase of @xmath3 with richness due to the stellar population trend is caused by the fact that the same physical radius corresponds to a different galaxy overdensity in environments of different richness .",

    "all the measurements discussed above are centered on the bcg , which may be slightly offset from the center of the dark matter halo of the cluster .",
    "our results therefore reflect the distribution of @xmath74 around bcgs out to large cosmic scales and should be so interpreted .",
    "furthermore , for scales outside the innermost regions of clusters , the possible mis - centering has negligible impact on @xmath3 .",
    "the poorest groups have the highest uncertainty in terms of cluster centering , luminosity uncertainties , and mass uncertainties because of the weaker lensing signal .",
    "therefore , the poorest groups ( @xmath126 ) are prone to larger uncertainties .",
    "previous results found that @xmath127 increases with cluster richness ( mass ) , approximately as @xmath128 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "here we show that this is mostly the effect of the bcg luminosity : the @xmath29 scale of the poorest groups is nearly the same size as the bcg galaxy ( a few hundred kpc ) , therefore the group @xmath127 is dominated by the lower @xmath86 of the bcg , while the bcg luminosity of rich clusters is negligible at the cluster scale of @xmath129 mpc . using the observed relations ( @xmath130 and @xmath131 ;  [ results ] ; @xcite ) we find @xmath132 , as is indeed observed . comparing the @xmath74 profile outside the innermost region ( at @xmath133 ) , we show that @xmath134 is nearly independent of richness ( figures [ graph : graph300 ] and [ graph : graph400 ] ) .",
    "the nearly flat distribution of @xmath14 persists on all scales , from @xmath104 ( @xmath135 kpc in small groups and @xmath8 kpc in large clusters ) out to nearly @xmath136 mpc .",
    "the small decrease in the mass - to - light ratio as a function of @xmath100 is consistent with a decreasing stellar population age as a function of local galaxy density (  [ results ] ) .",
    "this effect , combined with the fact that the physical radius @xmath44 corresponds to a different galaxy density in clusters of different richnesses , also accounts for the observed trend in @xmath80 as a function of cluster richness at fixed @xmath44 ( figure [ graph : graph500 ] ) .",
    "this agreement implies that the underlying mass and light distribution , when accounting for the stellar population age , follow each other remarkably well on all scales .",
    "it further suggests that the stellar mass fraction , @xmath137 , is nearly constant on these scales ( see  [ d4 ] ) .",
    "the luminosities discussed above do not represent the total luminosities since they include only galaxies above the threshold of @xmath138 (  [ data ] ) .",
    "the luminosity contributed by fainter galaxies is not included , and neither is the diffuse intracluster light ( icl )  integrated light from individual stars in the cluster potential @xcite .",

    "we estimate these additional luminosity contributions below .",
