    "independent observational data such as sn ia @xcite , cmb @xcite , and bao @xcite suggest that about 70% of the energy density today consists of dark energy responsible for cosmic acceleration .",

    "however there have been theoretical attempts to construct viable quintessence models in particle physics  especially in supersymmetric theories @xcite .",

    "the representative potential of this class is the hilltop potential such as @xmath21 $ ] .",
    "the second class consists of freezing models , in which the evolution of the field gradually slows down because of the shallowness of the potential at late times . for the inverse power - law potential @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) @xcite there is a so - called tracker solution characterized by a nearly constant field equation of state @xmath24 during the matter era @xcite . in this case",
