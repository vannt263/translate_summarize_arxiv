    "according to the _ beilinson conjectures _ , there is an intimate connection between the @xmath2-theory , or _ motivic cohomology _ , of a smooth proper variety @xmath3 over a number field , and special values of the @xmath4-function of @xmath3 .",
    "these values are expected to compare two @xmath5-structures on the highest exterior power of a certain finite dimensional @xmath6-vector space , namely the _",
    "absolute hodge cohomology _ of @xmath3 .",
    "the first comes about via an exact sequence involving algebraic de rham , and betti cohomology of @xmath3 .",
    "according to the conjecture , the image of @xmath2-theory under the so - called _ regulator _ provides absolute hodge cohomology with a second @xmath5-structure .",
    "+ in any of those higher dimensional cases , when weak versions of the conjectures are proved ( see @xcite , section 8 for a survey ) , one constructs _",
    "special elements _ in motivic cohomology and shows then that the regulators of these elements generate a @xmath5-structure , whose covolume has the expected relation to the special value of the @xmath4-function .",
    "however , one does not even know if the motivic cohomology is finite dimensional , or whether it is generated by the special elements .",
    "+ the only case when the full conjectures are known concerns varieties of dimension zero ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these are basically the only varieties for which the ranks of all @xmath2-groups have been determined , and the regulator is known to be injective . + the present work focuses on the construction of special elements in the motivic cohomology of symmetric powers of elliptic curves , and their images under the regulators .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath7 be an elliptic curve over a regular base @xmath8 . denote by @xmath9 the complement of the zero section , and by @xmath10 the kernel of the summation map @xmath11 note that the symmetric group @xmath12 acts on @xmath10 . for technical reasons",
    "( to be explained later in this introduction ) , we shall suppose that @xmath0 satisfies the _ disjointness property _",
    "@xmath13 : any two unequal sections in @xmath14 have disjoint support .",
    "+ the _ first _ objective of this work is the _ geometric _ construction of the following data , which we refer to as the _ formalism of elliptic bloch groups _ ( see section  [ ii ] ) :    * the _ elliptic bloch groups _",
    "@xmath15 , @xmath16 , which are actually @xmath17-vector spaces . *",

    "( theorem  [ 9be ] ) , this interpretation will allow to describe the images of the elements of @xmath27 under the regulator to absolute hodge cohomology in terms of _ eisenstein  kronecker series_. + the _ third _ objective is a detailed analysis of the maps @xmath28 .",
    "our main theorem  [ 9bi ] implies that the @xmath28 are isomorphisms as soon as the elliptic analogue of the beilinson ",
    "soul vanishing conjecture ( conjecture  [ 9bl ] ) holds . as a consequence ( theorem  [ 9ce ] ) , we shall see that conjecture  [ 9bl ] implies parts  1 and 2 of the _ weak version of zagier s conjecture for elliptic curves _",
    "( @xcite , conj .  1.6.(b ) ) . + for small @xmath29 , one can say more : first , we get a proof of the conjecture for @xmath30 ( see subsection  [ 10 ] ) , thus constructing elements in @xmath31 from certain formal linear combinations of elements of the mordell  weil group of @xmath0 .",
    "the present construction is of _ geometric _ nature .",
    "it will be shown to yield the same result as the _ sheaf theoretical _ construction of @xcite .",
    "+ second , in the case @xmath32 , we get an unconditional proof of parts  1 and 2 of the weak version of zagier s conjecture for elliptic curves ( see subsection  [ 11 ] ) .",
    "let us remark that in the case @xmath33 , the main result of @xcite is considerably stronger than ours .",
    "indeed , the authors show zagier s conjecture for ( @xmath32 and ) an elliptic curve @xmath0 over an _ arbitrary _",
    "field @xmath2 . translated into the language employed above ,",
    "the difference between zagier s conjecture proved in @xcite , and its weak version considered in the present work , consists in _ surjectivity _ : the bloch group @xmath34 of loc .",
    "is generated by the elliptic symbols if @xmath2 is algebraically closed .",
    "+ in the case of @xmath33 , @xcite contains the construction of certain complexes @xmath35 for arbitrary @xmath23 .",
    "the groups occurring in @xmath35 are given , at least up to torsion , by taking the @xmath2-rational divisors on @xmath0 , and dividing out certain convolution products of divisors of functions on @xmath0 .",
    "goncharov conjectures ( loc .",
    "cit . , conjecture 9.5.b ) ) that there are canonical isomorphisms @xmath36 for any @xmath37 .",
    "( the main result of @xcite concerns the cohomology of the complex @xmath38 . ) it would naturally be desirable to compare the two approaches ( see remark  [ 9bo ] ) . + we also get an alternative description of the _ eisenstein symbol on torsion _ ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "more precisely , we show , in subsections  [ 8 ] and [ 12 ] , that the restriction of the formalism of elliptic bloch groups to torsion yields a construction , which at least in absolute cohomology is identical , up to scaling , to the eisenstein symbol of loc .",
    "it should be possible to link the two motivic constructions as well .",
    "+ in analogy to the torsion case , let us refer to the inverse of @xmath28 as the _ eisenstein symbol _",
    ", whenever that inverse exists .",
    "+ in order to sketch some of the background , let us continue by discussing the classical _ zagier conjecture _",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "it gives a description , in terms of a formalism of classical bloch groups , of the @xmath2-theory of a field . in the case of number fields , there are two proofs of its _ weak version _",
    ", which is about the existence of the formalism , but does not say anything about its image in @xmath2-theory : @xcite gives the construction of the @xmath39 , in the @xmath2-theory of _ any _ field .",
    "as in @xcite or @xcite , quite some technical efforts have to be made in order to identify the image of the elements in @xmath27 under the regulator to absolute hodge cohomology . +",
    "the proof given in the unpublished preprint @xcite is different from @xcite in that it makes use of the full force of the theory of the _ classical polylogarithm_. in particular , one works in certain categories of mixed sheaves .",
    "e.g. , in its complex analytic incarnation , the polylog is a certain extension of variations of hodge structure .",
    "one of the main advantages of this approach is that the complicated computations in absolute hodge cohomology are avoided .",
    "instead , one needs to know the explicit shape of the polylog , say in terms of the entries of its period matrix .",
    "furthermore , one can treat regulators to other absolute cohomology theories in a completely analogous manner .",
    "+ it should be noted that in both proofs of the weak version of zagier s conjecture for number fields , borel s theorem plays a central technical role .",
    "in fact , our main theorem  [ 9bi ] is the precise analogue of de jeu s main result ( @xcite , thm .  3.12 ) .",
    "in the number field case , he is able to deduce the weak version of zagier s conjecture , because borel s theorem implies the beilinson ",
    "soul conjecture .",
    "+ in the present paper , we follow the approach of @xcite , transferring the geometric construction of loc .",
    "to the elliptic setting , and replacing the classical by the _ elliptic polylogarithm_. as far as the explicit description of the objects is concerned , our emphasis lies on the hodge theoretic side .",
    "let us stress however that the formal setting to be created here is equally applicable to the @xmath40-adic setting .",
    "given the recent results of kings concerning the identification of the @xmath40-adic elliptic polylog ( @xcite , section 4 , in particular thm .",
    "4.1.3 ) , a statement about the explicit shape of the @xmath40-adic eisenstein symbol seems within reach ( see loc .",
    "4.2.9 , which identifies the eisenstein symbol on torsion points ) . in this context",
    ", we expect a satisfactory treatment of part 3 of the weak version of the elliptic zagier conjecture , which concerns the _ integrality criterion _ ( see @xcite , 1.6.(b ) ) .",
    "+ let us now describe how the strategy of the construction of explicit elements in motivic and absolute cohomology `` via polylogarithms '' looks like .",
    "this strategy is again due to beilinson , and clearly present in papers like @xcite , or @xcite .",
    "+ the zeroeth step is to introduce , as in @xcite , the concept of yoneda extensions in categories of mixed sheaves in order to reinterpret the target of the regulator , i.e. , absolute cohomology .",
    "+ according to the motivic , i.e. , largely conjectural philosophy , the source of the regulator admits a similar interpretation : there should be a @xmath5-linear category of _ mixed motivic sheaves _",
    "@xmath41 on @xmath3 , together with exact functors , called _ realizations _",
    ", for any absolute cohomology theory , into the corresponding mixed sheaf category .",
    "there should be an isomorphism between motivic cohomology and the ext groups of tate twists in @xmath41 identifying the regulator with the morphism induced by the realization .",
    "+ the polylogarithmic strategy for the construction of special elements in motivic cohomology , and the computation of their images in absolute cohomology under the regulator , continues as follows : + step 1 .",
    "construct the special elements in absolute cohomology first .",
    "more precisely , construct the polylogarithmic extension on @xmath9 , and define the special elements by pulling back this extension via sections @xmath42 .    1 .",
    "the construction is a priori sheaf theoretical , and uses concepts like leray spectral sequences .",
    "the polylog is characterized by a certain universal property , one consequence of which is the so - called _ rigidity principle_. e.g. , in the hodge theoretic setting , rigidity states that the polylogarithmic extension of variations of hodge structure is uniquely determined by the underlying extension of local systems .",
    "2 .   via rigidity",
    ", it is possible to give explicit descriptions of the objects defined by abstract theory .",
    "3 .   again via rigidity , it is possible to show that the abstract construction of ( a ) is `` geometrically motivated '' : the extensions occur as cohomology objects , with tate coefficients , of certain @xmath8-schemes .",
    "step 2 . because of the present non - availability of a sheaf theoretical machinery on the level of motives , step 1  ( a ) admits no straightforward motivic imitation .",
    "however , it turns out that 1  ( c ) has a translation to motivic cohomology , yielding the explicit elements we were looking for .",
    "compatibility with the construction on the level of realizations under the regulator is then a consequence of the definition .",
    "+ in fact , one may expect this strategy to work in a context considerably more general than that of elliptic curves .",
    "we continue by indicating how , in the elliptic case , these steps are treated in the existing literature .",
    "+ step @xmath43 consists of the identification of absolute cohomology with ext groups in suitable categories of mixed sheaves . for the hodge theoretic and @xmath40-adic setting ,",
    "this is done in the appendices of @xcite , in particular , loc .",
    "a.1.10 , a.2.7 , b.4 . + as for step 1 , we refer to @xcite , 1.3 , or @xcite , section 1 for the construction of the sheaf theoretical incarnations of the elliptic polylogarithm .",
    "the explicit description in the setting of real hodge structures is contained in @xcite , 3.33.6 , and also in @xcite , section  4 .",
    "it is recalled in the present subsection  [ 2 ] .",
    "a specific geometric realization of the polylog in absolute cohomology is given in @xcite , 6.1 .",
    "+ finally , loc .",
    ", 6.26.3 contains the construction of the class of the polylogarithm in motivic cohomology , corresponding to the geometric situation established in loc .",
    "+ while this geometric situation enables one to give a polylogarithmic construction of the eisenstein symbol on torsion ( loc .",
    "cit . , 6.4 ) , we found ourselves unable to use it for our purposes .",
    "+ as a consequence , a good part of this work deals with an alternative solution of steps 1  ( c ) , and hence 2 ( which nonetheless in spirit follows faithfully the strategy of @xcite ) .",
    "the starting point is the so - called _ residue spectral sequence _ associated to a stratification of a smooth scheme @xmath3 induced by a given @xmath44-divisor .",
    "it converges to motivic cohomology of the full scheme @xmath3 .",
    "its @xmath45-terms are given by motivic cohomology of the locally closed subschemes associated to the filtration by _",
    "subschemes , which comes about by considering the complements of intersections of the divisor . in our situation",
    ", @xmath3 will be a power of the elliptic curve @xmath0 , and the divisor will be associated to finitely many sections of the structural morphism @xmath46 .",
    "+ the residue spectral sequence will be used twice :    1 .   for the construction of the polylogarithm",
    ", we perform base change via @xmath47 .",
    "we are able to control the differentials of ( a direct summand of ) the spectral sequence .",
    "consequently , it is possible to define the polylog by an inductive process .",
    "the bloch groups , the differentials , and the restrictions all occur in a quotient of the residue spectral sequence .",
    "the elliptic symbol @xmath20 will come about as pullback of the polylogarithm by @xmath48    \\(a ) is a direct translation of the strategy used in @xcite , 6.3 .",
    "the bulk of the present article consists of the detailed treatment of ( b ) .",
    "+ let us comment our hypothesis @xmath13 : under one central aspect , our treatment of the elliptic polylogarithm is less demanding than that of the classical situation : we do not have to work with simplicial schemes , and hence , do not need relative motivic cohomology ( @xcite , appendix b ) .",
    "by contrast , if we intended to work in a situation where sections were allowed to meet , simplicial techniques would enter at once . as was pointed out to the author ,",
    "@xmath13 is a _ very _ serious restriction of generality : if the base @xmath8 contains a point whose residue field is finite , then it implies that @xmath14 is torsion ( in which case none of the results mentioned in this article is new ) .",
    "+ the coarse structure of this work is as follows : section  [ i ] concerns the construction of the elliptic polylogarithm , section  [ ii ] establishes the formalism of elliptic bloch groups and states the main results mentioned above .",
    "their proofs are presented in section  [ iii ] . for the description of the finer structure , we refer to the introductions of the individual sections .",
    "+ we need to mention that this division reflects the history of this article : section  [ i ] is a revision of the first half ( sections 16 ) of the manuscript `` on the generalized eisenstein symbol '' , distributed in spring 1997 . by contrast , sections  [ ii ] and [ iii ] have almost no nontrivial intersection with the second half of that manuscript .",
    "this is largely due to the author s discovery that one of the central ideas of de jeu s construction of the bloch groups in the setting of the classical zagier conjecture ( @xcite ) could be translated almost _ verbatim _ into the elliptic context , thus solving the main technical problem encountered in the older version of this work . in particular",
    ", we wish to point out that the main results no longer require an injectivity statement concerning the ( product of the ) regulators .",
    "+ * acknowledgements : * the present paper is a largely revised version of my 1997 _ habilitationsschrift_. it is an honour to have it included in the proceedings of the conference commemorating the anniversary of @xcite , which not only addressed the specific question of studying special elements in @xmath49 , but formed one of the motivations for beilinson s conjectures in general .",
    "i am indebted to the organizers for providing me with this opportunity .",
    "+ i am grateful to the centre emile borel , paris , and to the university of chicago for their hospitality . during my stays in march 1997 and may 1999 respectively , most of the ideas for this work were put into a definitive form .",

    "in subsection [ 1 ] , we normalize the sheaf theoretic notations used throughout the whole paper . in the @xmath40-adic setting",
    ", we are working with schemes of finite type over @xmath50 $ ] .",
    "it is straightforward , however , to transfer our main results to schemes of finite type over @xmath5 . with [ 1f ]",
    ", we already encounter one of our main technical tools : the spectral sequence associated to a filtration of a smooth scheme by open subschemes , whose associated stratification is one by smooth schemes .",
    "let us refer to it as the _ residue spectral sequence_. + subsection [ 2 ] gives a quick axiomatic description of the elliptic logarithmic sheaf @xmath51 , and of the ( small ) elliptic polylogarithmic extension @xmath52 .",
    "we also give a more detailed discussion of some aspects of the elliptic zagier conjecture . the universal property [ 2a ] of @xmath51 is needed only to connect the general definition of the logarithmic sheaf as a solution of a representability problem to the somewhat ad hoc , but much more geometric definition of subsection  [ 5 ] . a reader willing to accept the result on the shape of the hodge theoretic incarnation of the polylogarithm ( [ 2i ] )",
    "may therefore take the constructions in subsections  [ 5 ] and [ 7 ] as a definition of both @xmath51 and @xmath53 , and view subsection  [ 2 ] as an extended introduction providing background material .",
    "+ in subsection [ 3 ] , we establish the geometric situation used thereafter .",
    "the subsection is mainly intended for easier reference .",
    "let us note that the definition was inspired by the construction of @xcite , section  4 , in the classical case .",
    "+ in subsection  [ 4 ] , we identify the residue spectral sequence in the special situation of open subschemes of a power @xmath54 , which are given by removing sections of the structural morphism @xmath46 .",
    "the main results are [ 4f ] and [ 7b ] .",
    "+ using the results of subsection  [ 4 ] , we then proceed to give the geometric realization of @xmath51 and of @xmath53 .",
    "theorem  [ 5e ] identifies @xmath51 ( or rather , its pullback to @xmath9 ) with a projective system of relative cohomology objects with coefficients in tate twists of certain subschemes of powers of @xmath55 over @xmath9 .",
    "together with the leray spectral sequence , this result suggests that extensions by @xmath51 should be described as elements of the projective limit of absolute cohomology of these schemes .",
    "corollary  [ 5h ] makes explicit this identification for @xmath53 .",
    "+ now that the zeroeth and first steps of the strategy , outlined in the introduction , have been accomplished , the next thing to do is to translate the construction of subsection [ 5 ] to the setting of motivic cohomology , and give the definition of the class of the elliptic polylogarithm . here",
    ", we encounter a typical technical difficulty : the construction of subsection  [ 5 ] was possible partly because of the vanishing of absolute cohomology in a certain range of indices ( see e.g.  the proof of theorem  [ 5b ] ) .",
    "the analogous vanishing results in motivic cohomology are at present not available . in order to circumvent this technical complication",
    ", we translate @xcite , 6.2 , 6.3 to our setting , and employ the action induced by the isogenies @xmath56 $ ] on our motivic cohomology groups .",
    "the main result of subsection  [ 7 ] is theorem  [ 7e ] .",
    "it states that a certain differential in the residue spectral sequence is an isomorphism on the generalized eigenspace for the eigenvalue @xmath57 . as in @xcite",
    ", this enables one to define the motivic elliptic polylogarithm by an inductive process ( [ 7 g ] ) . by construction , everything is compatible with what was done before under the regulators . from its definition",
    ", we also get a statement about the image of the polylog under the differential of our spectral sequence ( proposition  [ 7i ] )",
    ". this result will be responsible for the special shape of our differential @xmath58 on the elliptic symbols @xmath59 .",
    "the precise structure of our motivic realization of @xmath53 is explained by its _ application _ , in sections  [ ii ] and [ iii ] , to the formalism of elliptic bloch groups .",
    "readers interested only in the construction of @xmath53 will find a concise presentation in @xcite , where spectral sequences are completely avoided by using motivic _",
    "homology_. in fact , we wish to mention that after studying @xcite , it was possible to considerably simplify the original proof of theorem  [ 7e ] , by observing that for relative elliptic curves , the techniques used in @xcite generalize to base schemes which are not necessarily smooth and quasi - projective over a field",
    ". + subsection  [ 8 ] discusses the specialization of the elliptic polylogarithm to torsion sections .",
    "we get versions of the results of @xcite , 6.4 in our geometric setting .",
    "we start by defining the sheaf categories which will be relevant for us . for our purposes",
    ", it will be necessary to work in the settings of _ mixed @xmath40-adic perverse sheaves _ , of _ algebraic mixed hodge modules _ , and of _ algebraic mixed hodge modules over @xmath6_.",
    "since the procedures are entirely analogous , we introduce , for economical reasons , the following rules : whenever an area of paper is divided by a vertical bar +   @xmath60    the text on the left of it will concern the hodge theoretic setting , while the text on the right will deal with the @xmath40-adic setting . we let @xmath61 \\ ; , \\\\   f : = { { { \\mathbb}{q}}}_\\ell \\ ; .",
