    "together with quintessence ( a scalar field with some potential minimally coupled to gravity ) @xcite and other physical and geometrical ( modified gravity ) models of dark energy ( see , e.g. , the reviews @xcite for exact definitions ) , the generalized chaplygin gas @xcite ( hereafter gcg ) is one widely studied model among those proposed to describe the observed accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite . in its generalized form , the chaplygin gas is a barotropic fluid with the following equation of state : @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath3 are positive constants ( for the original chaplygin gas @xmath8 ) .",
    "the generalized equation of state ( [ gcgeos ] ) has been introduced in @xcite and analysed in @xcite and in many other subsequent papers .",
    "in contrast to many models describing dark energy alone , the gcg gives a unified description of dark matter and dark energy , enrolling itself in the class of so - called quartessence or unified dark matter ( udm ) cosmological models .",
    "it allows to interpolate between a dust  dominated phase of the evolution of the universe in the past and an accelerated one at recent time , see eq .",
    "( [ gcgrhoevo ] ) below .",
    "that is why the gcg has attracted much attention in cosmology .",
    "the evolution of the energy density as a function of the cosmic scale factor @xmath9 of the friedmann  lematre  robertson  walker ( flrw ) cosmological model is easily obtained from ( [ gcgeos ] ) and from the energy conservation equation : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is an integration constant usually chosen to be positive ( if @xmath12 , the weak energy condition is violated and phantom cosmology takes place , see for example @xcite ) .    from ( [ gcgeos ] ) and ( [ gcgrhoevo ] ) ,",
    "the parameter @xmath13 and the square sound velocity @xmath14 have the following expressions : @xmath15^{-1 } , \\label{gcgw}\\\\ c_{\\rm sch}^{2 } & \\equiv & { \\frac { { \\rm d } \\pp}{{\\rm d } \\rr } } = -\\alpha w_{\\rm ch}. \\label{gcgcs}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that for @xmath0 , @xmath16 may exceed the velocity of light ( set to unity in our notations ) in the course of the recent or future evolution of the universe , while it was non - relativistic at large redshifts , during the matter  dominated stage , for all values of @xmath3 .",
    "cosmological models based either on one or on more than one fluid are essentially different .",
    "the reason for this is that the various fluid components interact indirectly via geometry and may also interact by direct energy exchange .",
    "direct non - gravitational interactions are typically neglected but the indirect ones are always present and can give rise to totally different evolutions , especially at the perturbative level .",
    "we will see how this works for the gcg together with baryons .",
    "the pure gcg , namely the cosmological model based on the gcg alone , has passed many tests of standard cosmology .",
    "quite recently , updated constraints for the gcg parameters have been published @xcite . however , the behaviour of the gcg under perturbations is still problematic @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the study of the power spectrum of large scale structures seems to indicate that the best fit value of @xmath3 is very close to zero , rendering the gcg indistinguishable from @xmath2cdm [ the latter is indeed the limit of gcg for @xmath17 , as one can infer from ( [ gcgh ] ) below ] .",
    "this feature has to be attributed to the gcg sound velocity which , during the cosmic evolution , grows from 0 to @xmath18 driving inhomogeneities to oscillate ( if @xmath19 ) or to blow  up ( if @xmath20 ) .",
    "this characteristic seems to be common to all udm models @xcite which , as a consequence , might appear to be ruled out .",
    "however , as shown in @xcite , it appears that adding a baryon component to the gcg the problem disappears and the model is in agreement with observations .",
    "but the debate still goes on and the authors of @xcite have corroborated their claim about ruling out gcg and , in general , all quartessence models through gravitational lensing measurements on the basis of the current value of the cosmological parameter @xmath21 ( the rms mass dispersion on a sphere of radius @xmath22 @xmath23 ) .    still ,",
    "the parameter @xmath21 need not necessarily be a confident discriminant among different cosmological models since it is clearly a quantity which is strongly affected by non  linear effects , while all the calculations performed in @xcite are carried out in the linear regime .",
    "this point was also raised much earlier in @xcite in a more general context .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate the issue of cosmological perturbations in gcg models using the gauge  invariant formalism @xcite .",
    "we consider both the gcg alone and in the presence of baryons , confirming the results of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in addition , the gcg seems to favour structure formation when its sound velocity is superluminal , in particular when @xmath4 .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following :    1 .",
    "in section [ giform ] we briefly outline bardeen gauge  invariant formalism and derive the equations that we will numerically solve in the rest of the paper .",
    "2 .   in section [ gcgruled ]",
    "we investigate structure formation in a gcg  dominated universe and display the role of the sound velocity .",
    "3 .   in section [ gcgpowers ]",
    "we calculate the theoretical power spectrum in a gcg  dominated universe and compare it with the observed one .",
    "4 .   in section [ gcgandbar ]",
    "we consider a two  fluid model based on gcg in presence of baryons .",
    "for this variant of the model we perform the same analysis of the previous two sections and compare the results .",
    "in section [ concl ] we present our conclusions and discuss in more detail why a possible superluminal sound velocity of the gcg is not prohibited by causality arguments . 6 .   for completeness ,",
    "we add an appendix in which , using the technique developed in @xcite we write down the exact solution for perturbations of dust - like matter and generalized chaplygin gas in the newtonian approximation at the matter  dominated stage .",
    "the cosmological perturbations issue was first tackled and studied by lifshitz in 1946 in the synchronous gauge @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in 1980 bardeen developed gauge invariant perturbation theory @xcite by constructing suitable combinations of metric and stress  energy tensor perturbations which are invariant under a generic gauge transformation . the gauge  invariant formalism has been used and reviewed by many authors . here",
    "we follow the notation of @xcite and study only scalar perturbations .",
    "the first  order einstein equations have the following form : @xmath24\\delta^{i}_{j } - \\\\ - \\frac{1}{2}\\gamma^{ik}\\left(\\phi - \\psi\\right)_{|kj } = a^{2}\\delta p\\delta^{i}_{j } - \\sigma^{|i}_{|j } , \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the scale factor as a function of the conformal time @xmath26 .",
    "its present value is normalized to unity ; @xmath27 , where the prime denotes derivation with respect to the conformal time ; @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the bardeen gauge",
    " invariant potentials ; @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the gauge  invariant expressions of the perturbations of the energy density and pressure ; @xmath32 is the gauge  invariant expression of the scalar potential of the velocity field ; @xmath33 represents the shear . finally , @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) is the spatial part of the flrw metric and @xmath36 is its curvature parameter which corresponds respectively to flat , close and open geometry .",
    "the vertical bar denotes covariant derivation with respect to @xmath34 .",
    "units are chosen such that @xmath37 .",
    "see @xcite for a detailed derivation of system ( [ muksys ] ) .",
    "we introduce two assumptions which simplify ( [ muksys ] ) :    * we assume @xmath38 ; * we neglect shear perturbations , namely we assume @xmath39 .",
    "this implies @xmath40 .    for a cosmological model based on @xmath41 non  interacting fluids we write for the background quantities : @xmath42",
    "while for the perturbations in the linear regime : @xmath43 the mixed time ",
    "space component of the perturbed energy ",
    "momentum tensor will look like @xmath44 , since each fluid will contribute with its own velocity .",
    "adiabatic perturbations of a barotropic fluid are characterized by the following equation of state : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the sound velocity at constant entropy for the generic component @xmath47 . in the cosmological perturbation theory it is customary to deal with the density contrast : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the background energy density of the component @xmath47 .",
    "since we work in the linear regime it is useful to take the spatial fourier transform of ( [ muksys ] ) which allows us to treat each mode independently . with the above assumptions and trading the conformal time for the scale factor @xmath50 , system ( [ muksys ] ) for a generic multi ",
    "fluid model is rewritten as follows : @xmath51 where the dot denotes derivation with respect to the scale factor @xmath50 ( for the sake of simplicity we adopt the same notation for the fourier transformed quantities as for the original ones ) .",
    "if @xmath52 , the system is determined and can be solved by eliminating @xmath53 and by extracting the following second order equation for @xmath54 : @xmath55 once solved , we can use the solution of ( [ eqphi ] ) in the first equation of ( [ muksys2 ] ) to find the solution for @xmath53 .    instead , if @xmath56 we need @xmath57 additional equations to make ( [ muksys2 ] ) determined .",
    "these equations should take into account the possible interactions and the energy exchanges among the different fluids .",
    "since we have assumed that they are not mutually interacting directly , the required additional equations to be added can be simply chosen as the energy conservation equations , @xmath58 , given separately for each further component .",
    "namely the continuity equation @xmath59 : @xmath60 and the euler equation @xmath61 : @xmath62\\dot { } + \\frac{3}{a}\\left(\\rho_{i } + p_{i}\\right)v_{i } - \\frac{c_{{\\rm s}i}^{2}\\rho_{i}}{{\\mathcal{h}}}\\delta_{i } - \\frac{\\left(\\rho_{i } + p_{i}\\right)}{{\\mathcal{h}}}\\phi = 0,\\ ] ] where @xmath63 .",
    "both ( [ conteq ] ) and ( [ euleq ] ) are fourier transformed , that is why there is no @xmath64 subscript in ( [ euleq ] ) .",
    "it is possible to write the combination of ( [ muksys2 ] ) , ( [ conteq ] ) and ( [ euleq ] ) as a system of @xmath41 second order equations , one for each @xmath65 .",
    "one needs to derive ( [ conteq ] ) , then to express @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 in terms of the other @xmath65 s through ( [ muksys2 ] ) , ( [ euleq ] ) and again ( [ conteq ] ) . in the case",

    "as shown in @xcite , at the matter  dominated regime , i.e. when @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 , the above coefficients are far simpler and system ( [ gensys ] ) can be rewritten in the following quasi ",
    "newtonian form : @xmath81 this approximation is sufficient to study the formation of all gravitationally bound objects ( galaxies , in particular ) which become nonlinear for @xmath82 . as pointed out in @xcite , it is possible to recover the system ( [ gensyssimplified ] ) by considering the limit @xmath83 , too , but it is not a necessary constraint in the matter  dominated regime when @xmath84 and @xmath85 are small .",
    "it is interesting that the system ( [ gensyssimplified ] ) can be exactly solved for the two  fluid model considered in sec .",
    "[ gcgandbar ] .",
    "the solution is exhibited in the appendix .",
    "in the gcg dominated universe the hubble parameter scales as follows : @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 is the hubble constant .    in a typical analysis of the gcg model",
    "it is customary to take @xmath89 since the square sound velocity tends to @xmath3 for @xmath90 , as can be seen from ( [ gcgcs ] ) .",
    "for @xmath8 the sound velocity will tend to unity in the far future , at @xmath91 .",
    "the new regime that we investigate in the present paper is @xmath0 , thereby making gcg superluminal after a sufficiently long but still finite time .    from ( [ gcgcs ] )",
    "it is straightforward to calculate at which redshift the transition to the superluminal gcg would occur . for generic values of @xmath92 and @xmath3 : @xmath93^{\\frac{1}{3\\left(\\alpha + 1\\right ) } } - 1.\\ ] ] given @xmath94 and @xmath92 , it is plausible to expect that some , hopefully observable , cosmological effect would take place at that redshift .",
    "it is crucial to point out that @xmath3 and @xmath92 are not independent , but linked by ( [ gcgh ] ) , once we have some constraints about the background expansion . in the present paper we consider @xmath95 , i.e. the redshift at which the transition to the accelerated phase of the expansion takes place . we derive its expression from ( [ gcgh ] ) : @xmath96^{\\frac{1}{3\\left(\\alpha + 1\\right ) } } - 1.\\ ] ]",
    "it follows from the most recent sn ia observations combined with cmb and baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) data that @xmath97 with a rather large uncertainty ( at least @xmath98 or more at the @xmath99 confidence level ) , see e.g. fig . 7 in @xcite and",
    "also @xcite . for comparison ,",
    "if only sn ia are used , then the gold+hst dataset @xcite leads to @xmath100 , see fig . 2 in @xcite and also @xcite ) while other datasets ( snls and essence ) alone produce values of @xmath101 , too ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , these numbers strongly depend on the present value of the non - relativistic matter density @xmath102 which , in turn , has to be expressed through @xmath92 in the gcg case ( the values given above correspond to @xmath103 )",
    ". direct calculation of @xmath104 for udm models @xcite shifts this quantity to even larger redshifts : @xmath105 . actually ,",
    "in the latter case , the authors consider only silence quartessence ( namely the effective sound velocity is assumed to be zero ) and the parameter @xmath3 is constrained to be @xmath106 .",
    "then from ( [ acctransz ] ) we can write down an explicit relation between @xmath92 and @xmath3 : @xmath107 note that the uncertainty @xmath108 of the transition redshift propagates on @xmath92 through the following formula : @xmath109^{2}(1 + z_{\\rm tr})^{3\\alpha+4}}\\sigma_{z_{tr}},\\ ] ] therefore the larger is @xmath3 , the smaller is the bias on @xmath92 .",
    "a widely used cosmological parameter stemming from cmb observation is @xmath110 , the comoving distance to the last scattering surface scaled to @xmath102 , namely : @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the last scattering surface redshift . in udm models",
    ", the quantity @xmath102 should be taken from the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath113 for @xmath114 at the matter  dominated stage , so @xmath115 ( or @xmath116 if baryons are taken into account , too ) . at the @xmath117 confidence level , @xmath118 ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "an interesting limiting case is the super ",
    "duperluminal one : @xmath119 .",
    "then @xmath120 for @xmath121 and @xmath122 for larger @xmath123 . in this case",
    ", one can obtain an analytic expression for @xmath110 : @xmath124 then the above mentioned observational window for @xmath110 is reached for @xmath125 .    combining ( [ acctransz ] ) with ( [ transz ] )",
    "we find that @xmath126 if @xmath127 , then @xmath128 .",
    "for @xmath129 , @xmath130 but @xmath131 approaches @xmath95 once more for @xmath119 . for a fixed @xmath95",
    ", the maximal value of @xmath131 is reached for @xmath132 when @xmath133 .",
    "thus , for @xmath134 , the transition from subluminal to superluminal gcg occurs approximately at the same time as the transition to the accelerated phase of expansion of the universe .",
    "we now compare the evolution of perturbations in the gcg  dominated universe for different values of @xmath3 .",
    "we choose an integration range which starts at the decoupling era , namely @xmath135 ( @xmath136 ) , and ends up when the first structures , namely protogalaxies , were formed ( @xmath137 , or @xmath138 ) , so that the linear approximation holds true .",
    "we numerically solve ( [ eqphi ] ) choosing @xmath139 $ ] as normalized initial conditions for @xmath140 $ ] . in our calculations we use ( [ acctransza ] ) to properly choose @xmath92 as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "we show the results using @xmath141 and @xmath142 .     for different values of @xmath3 and for @xmath143 h mpc@xmath144 .",
    "the transition redshift is @xmath145,title=\"fig:\",width=491 ] +    , with @xmath146,title=\"fig:\",width=491 ] +    the plots in figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] display the evolution of the density contrast in the gcg , which we call @xmath147 , for different choices of the parameter @xmath3 and for @xmath143 h mpc@xmath144 , which corresponds to a scale of order @xmath148 @xmath149 @xmath150 , which is typical of a protogalaxy .",
    "the case @xmath151 corresponds to the @xmath2cdm model .",
    "indeed , here we are first investigating if formation of gravitationally bound objects including galaxies takes place at all .",
    "that is why we have chosen so small a scale and we have stopped at @xmath152 .",
    "the gcg udm model , like all cdm  like ones , belongs to the class of bottom  up , or hierarchical clustering , scenarios of structure formation where small scale structures are formed first .",
    "the question of large  scale structure in this model at scales which remain linear for @xmath153 , of course , requires integration up to @xmath154 .",
    "it is considered in the next section .",
    "part of the results found in @xcite are already confirmed by this analysis , without a deeper study involving the power spectrum .",
    "the development of oscillations takes place too early for @xmath155 , thus preventing structure formation .",
    "however , two further interesting features can be extracted from figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] .",
    "first , it seems that there exists a critical value , namely @xmath156 , for which the deviation of the gcg from the @xmath151 linear growth is maximal .",
    "second , the larger the value of @xmath3 ( in the range @xmath157 ) the smaller the deviation from the @xmath151 behaviour . indeed ,",
    "when @xmath0 , i.e. in the superluminal regime , the oscillations are absent and the growth seems even to be enhanced .    both the above mentioned features can be explained by the behaviour of the gcg sound velocity as a function of @xmath3 , which is displayed in figure [ fig3 ] for @xmath141 ( the plots for @xmath142 are very similar ) .    ) plotted as a function of @xmath50 for different values of @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath92 is given by ( [ acctransza ] ) with @xmath141.,title=\"fig:\",width=491 ] +    for @xmath158 the sound velocity becomes non negligible much earlier than at other values of @xmath3 .",
    "the range @xmath159 appears thus to be ruled out since structure formation is prevented .",
    "however , to understand what happens out of this range it is necessary to study the clustering properties of matter at the present time , namely the power spectrum .",
    "this will be done in the following section .",
    "in the previous section we have shown that in the gcg model galaxy formation is possible only when @xmath3 is very small or @xmath134 . in this section",
    "we try and constrain these bounds further by studying the clustering properties of gcg perturbations , namely the power spectrum @xmath160 , and comparing it with observation .",
    "we exploit the sdss ( sloan digital sky survey ) data as analysed in @xcite .",
    "the sample considered by the authors consists of 205,443 galaxies observed before july 2002 .",
    "the data consist of ra ( right ascension ) , dec ( declination ) and redshift @xmath123 for each galaxy .",
    "the redshift is converted to comoving distance by using a flat cosmological model with a cosmological constant @xmath161 ( it can be shown that our results are robust to this assumption ) .    the power spectrum is computed at present time , namely at @xmath162 .",

    "the power spectra for @xmath127 and @xmath175 are highly irregular and their slopes are hardly recognizable .    in conclusion , the pure gcg does not seem to work from a perturbative viewpoint , even when it is superluminal .",
    "however , a reasonable possibility is to allow the gcg to have non ",
    "adiabatic perturbations , which is a natural assumption since it is not a pressureless fluid .",
    "an attempt in this direction has already been performed in @xcite and @xcite ( here also a baryon component is considered ) .",

    "has the following form : @xmath180^{1/1 + \\alpha}\\right\\}a^{2},\\ ] ] where subscript b refers to the baryonic component and subscript @xmath181 indicates that the corresponding quantity is evaluated at the present epoch ( @xmath182 ) .    system ( [ gensys ] ) is solved numerically in the same integration range of the previous sections and setting @xmath183 . before proceeding",
    "it is necessary to find a relation between @xmath92 and @xmath3 which ensures the preservation of the correct background expansion , e.g. the acceleration redshift @xmath184 .    from ( [ chbhomega ] )",
    "it is possible to work out the following expression : @xmath185 - 1/2}{\\left\\{\\bar{a}\\left[(1+z_{\\rm tr})^{-3(\\alpha+1)}-1\\right ] + 1\\right\\}^{\\alpha/\\alpha + 1 } } = \\frac{\\omega_{\\rm b0}}{2\\left(1-\\omega_{\\rm b0}\\right)},\\ ] ] which can not be inverted to give @xmath92 as a function of @xmath3 .",

    "we show an exact solution , in the matter dominated regime , for the evolution of perturbations in the model of the present section .     with @xmath145.,title=\"fig:\",width=491 ]",
    "+     with @xmath188.,title=\"fig:\",width=491 ] +    in figures [ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] we show the baryonic power spectra computed for different values of @xmath3 compared to the observed one .",
    "we have chosen as normalized initial conditions the following values : @xmath189 = \\left[1 , 1 , 1 , 1\\right]$ ] .",
    "we have chosen the same initial conditions for all the quantities essentially because after the equivalence era the gcg behaved as dust and therefore its density contrast grew linearly ( as a function of the scale factor ) .    unlike what happened in the previous section , this time there were no oscillations in @xmath190 , since the baryonic density contrast is unaffected by the instabilities of the gcg one .",
    "in fact , the results are different from those inferred from figures [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] .",
    "the agreement with the observed power spectrum is better .",
    "it is particularly good again for very small @xmath3 but also in the range @xmath0",
    ". therefore the gcg seems to work better either when it is practically indistinguishable from @xmath2cdm or when its sound velocity is superluminal .",
    "the good agreement of the theoretical power spectrum with the observed one can be explained realizing that gcg perturbations are indistinguishable from those of baryons at the beginning of the matter  dominated stage .",
    "therefore they really act as dark matter and compel baryons perturbations to grow and form structures . on the other hand , when the gcg sound velocity increases ,",
    "the growth of the baryons inhomogeneities is damped , but does not oscillate .",
    "this fact can be observed in figures [ fig8 ] and [ fig9 ] .",
    "moreover , structures which have already formed are not influenced by the gcg sound velocity , so neither is the large scale power spectrum .",
    "this was already pointed out in @xcite .     for different values of @xmath3 and for @xmath143 @xmath167 @xmath171 .",

    "we have chosen @xmath143 @xmath167 @xmath171 .",
    "note that the plots corresponding to @xmath151 and @xmath127 are superposed .",
    "we infer from figures [ fig8 ] and [ fig9 ] that the gcg sound velocity has a damping effect on the growth of baryon inhomogeneities .",
    "these are not compelled to oscillate , but structure formation is delayed , if not prevented . in order to render structure formation as similar as possible to that of @xmath2cdm , we need either very small values of @xmath3 or @xmath129 . the latter range for @xmath3 just leads to @xmath130 as was shown in section [ gcgruled ] .",
    "from our analysis it emerges that :    * the generalized chaplygin gas cosmological model , with no additional fluid components , is compatible with structure formation and large scale structure clustering properties ( encoded in the power spectrum ) only for @xmath3 sufficiently small ( @xmath1 ) , in which case it is practically indistinguishable from the @xmath2cdm model . *",
    "adding to the generalized chaplygin gas model a baryon component we find that the growth of the density contrast and the large scale structure clustering properties are compatible with observations for all values of @xmath3 .",
    "however very small values of @xmath3 and the case @xmath4 are favoured .",
    "note , however , that the integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect ( not considered in this paper ) leads to rather large enhancement of low cmb multipoles @xmath193 in udm models , in contrast to a modest increase of @xmath193 in the @xmath2cdm model @xcite , that results in the exclusion of the gcg with @xmath194 @xcite ( see also the recent paper @xcite for an analytical treatment of the isw effect for udm models ) .",
    "it may be interesting to investigate if it remains so large for all @xmath195 .",
    "now , since most of the new results of this paper refer to the superluminal case @xmath0 , it is natural to consider the question if this range is physically admissible in more detail .",
    "the fact that the group velocity @xmath196 in media may exceed the light velocity in vacuum ( unity in our notations ) is not , in itself , unphysical .",
    "not only it is not prohibited from the theoretical point of view , but this phenomenon has been actually observed in laboratories in case of light propagation through dispersive media . as was proved long ago",
    "( see e.g. @xcite ) , what is really necessary in order not to violate causality is that the signal ( or , the wavefront ) velocity should not exceed @xmath197 .",
    "then , what is the signal velocity for the gcg ? it does not appear possible to answer this question at the hydrodynamic level since the gcg phenomenological equation of state in the normal ( non - phantom ) case requires @xmath198 , so that the limit @xmath199 corresponding to a wavefront expanding into vacuum can not be studied .",
    "therefore , to determine the value of the signal velocity for the gcg , one has to use some underlying microscopic field  theoretical model from which the equation of state ( [ gcgeos ] ) arises in macroscopic hydrodynamics .",
    "now we are able to consider the limit @xmath203 corresponding to a wavefront expanding into vacuum with no @xmath5-essence in front of it . to prove that the signal velocity is equal to unity in this case , it is sufficient to show that the wave equation corresponding to ( [ tach ] ) , namely @xmath204 has plane - wave solutions of the type @xmath205 in flat space - time ( since the signal velocity is also the infinite momentum limit of the phase velocity of a wave )",
    ". it is straightforward to check that the sufficient condition for this to hold is that both @xmath206 and @xmath207 are finite at @xmath208 ( a similar remark is made in the recent paper @xcite , see also @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , @xmath209 should be non - negative in order for ghosts not to be present .    in the superluminal case @xmath0 , the lagrangian density ( [ tach ] )",
    "does not satisfy this condition since @xmath206 and @xmath207 diverge at @xmath203 .",
    "however , without going into a more detailed analysis of the singularity structure at a null hyper ",
    "surface in this case , we propose a simple _ sufficient _ way to cure the causality problem for the gcg .",
    "namely , let us assume that the expression ( [ tach ] ) changes to @xmath210 for @xmath211 where @xmath212 and that it smoothly matches ( [ tach ] ) at @xmath213 .",
    "then it is clear that the signal velocity is exactly unity .",
    "the lagrangian density ( [ change ] ) describes a massless scalar field minimally coupled to gravity and a cosmological constant .",
    "the correspondingly corrected macroscopic gcg remains the same in the observable region @xmath214 , or @xmath215 ( note that @xmath216 is of the order of the present day critical energy density in the universe ) but will become a mixture of a cosmological constant and the extremely stiff ideal fluid ( @xmath217 ) in the far future when @xmath218 will drop to @xmath219 .",
    "with the same accuracy , one can say that the corrected gcg becomes the usual chaplygin gas when its density is very close to @xmath216 , much closer than the one which occurs presently .",
    "thus , by slightly changing the gcg equation of state in the unobservable region , the causality problem is cured . as a result ,",
    "the present gcg superluminal sound velocity is a _ transient _ phenomenon which disappears at @xmath220 .",
    "finally , note that in the limit @xmath119 , the ggg realizes the parker - raval scenario @xcite of a sudden transition from the matter  dominated stage with @xmath221 to the de sitter expansion with a constant curvature ( modulo a small term @xmath222 ) .",
    "the original idea of parker and raval to produce such a scenario using non - perturbative vacuum polarization of a light minimally coupled scalar field is questionable , both regarding derivation of the effective action and stability of the resulting specific kind of the @xmath223 theory of gravity ( here @xmath110 is the ricci scalar ) .",
    "but the same scenario based on the limiting case of the gcg does not have these problems .",
    "this shows once more that the superluminal gcg deserves further , more detailed study .",
