    "the time variation of the radial abundance gradients is possibly the most important information that can be obtained from the abundance variations in the galactic disk . in this respect ,",
    "planetary nebulae ( pne ) play a particularly important role , as they have relatively well determined abundances and are originated from stars within a reasonably large mass ( and age ) bracket ( see for example maciel & costa @xcite ) .    using pne , maciel et al .",
    "( @xcite ) suggested a time flattening of the o / h gradient from roughly @xmath00.11 dex / kpc to @xmath00.06 dex / kpc during the last 9  gyr .",
    "more recently , maciel et al .",
    "( @xcite ) extended the original discussion by estimating the [ fe / h ] gradient and using other objects such as open clusters , cepheid variables , hii regions and stars in ob associations . in the present work ,",
    "we consider four chemical elements ( o , s , ar , and ne ) and take into account four different pne samples .",
    "a detailed discussion can be found in maciel et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the four samples considered are : ( i ) the basic sample , which is essentially the same used in our previous work ( maciel et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , costa et al .",
    "@xcite ) . this sample contains up to 234 objects and is the largest one considered , but it is a compilation , albeit careful , of several different determinations in the literature ; ( ii ) the homogeneous sample of henry et al .",
    "( @xcite ) ; ( iii ) the sample recently presented by perinotto et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , and ( iv ) our own data , which we will call the iag / usp sample .",
    "this is a highly homogeneous sample , although relatively small , reaching about 70 nebulae ( see costa et al .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "abundance gradients were determined for o , s , ar , and ne assuming a linear variation in the abundances with the galactocentric distance @xmath1 .",
    "the ages of the pne progenitors were estimated in the following way .",
    "first , the heavy element abundances were converted into [ fe / h ] metallicities and then the ages were determined using an age - metallicity relationship ( amr ) which also depends on the galactocentric distance .",
    "once the individual ages had been determined , the nebulae in each sample were divided into two age groups , group  i ( younger ) and group  ii ( older ) .",
    "we considered the age separation of the groups @xmath2 in the range 3.0 to 6.0 gyr , and for each of these values we calculated the gradients of groups i and ii . comparing the derived gradients for all four elements and samples , we conclude that the gradients of the younger group  i are systematically flatter than the corresponding gradients of the older group  ii .",
    "considering the other objecs studied in our previous work , namely open clusters , cepheid variables , hii regions and stars in ob associations , the general picture of the time variation of the gradients becomes more clear , as can be seen in fig .  1",
    ". predictions of models by hou et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and chiappini et al .",
    "( @xcite ) are also shown , as illustrations of theoretical models of chemical evolution .",
    "it can be concluded that the flattening rate is essentially the same as derived before , namely , @xmath3/dr \\sim 0.005 $ ] to @xmath4dex kpc@xmath5 gyr@xmath5 for the last 6 to 8 gyr ."
