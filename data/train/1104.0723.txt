    "the inflation is a very important concept in the modern cosmology @xcite .",
    "the standard model of the inflation was introduced by guth @xcite . however , because this model relies on a scalar field which has no interaction with any other fields , so that it is impossible that the radiation to be produced during the inflation .",
    "this leads to a thermodynamically supercooled phase of the universe @xcite .",
    "so this standard inflationary model needs a `` graceful exit '' to ensure the universe enters a radiation - dominated phase .",
    "in fact , it is not the only way to describe the inflationary dynamics .",
    "another model of the inflationary picture is called the warm inflation @xcite , as opposed to the conventional cool inflation . in this model ,",
    "the dissipative effects are very important during the inflationary era , so the radiation is produced concurrently with an inflationary expansion and there is no a separate reheating phase .",
    "also , the density fluctuation in the warm inflation arises from the thermal fluctuation , rather than the vacuum fluctuation which dominates the supercooled case @xcite .",
    "the radiation dominates immediately as soon as the warm inflation ends .",
    "the matter components of the universe are created by the decay of either the remaining inflationary field or the dominant radiation field @xcite .",
    "the warm inflation has been studied by many authors not only in classical cosmology scenario but also in quantum cosmology scenario ( see @xcite and references therein , and @xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we focus on a tachyon warm inflation in loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) scenario .    the application of loop quantum gravity techniques to homogeneous cosmological models is known as lqc @xcite .",
    "owing to the homogeneity and isotropy of the spacetimes , the connection is determined by a single parameter called @xmath3 and the triad is determined by @xmath4 .",
    "the variables @xmath3 and @xmath4 are canonically conjugate with poisson bracket @xmath5 , in which @xmath6 is the barbero - immirzi parameter and @xmath7 . in the lqc scenario ,",
    "the initial singularity is instead by a bounce .",
    "thanks to the quantum effect , the universe is in an initially contracting phase with minimal but not zero volume , and then the quantum effect drives it to the expanding phase . and , in the effective lqc scenario , the loop quantum effects can be very well described by a effective modified friedmann dynamics @xcite .",
    "there are two types of modifications , one is the inverse volume correction , the other is the holonomy correction .",
    "this paper we just discuss the holonomy correction . in this effective lqc scenario , a factor of @xmath8",
    "is added to the standard friedmann equation . for the correction term , @xmath9 ,",
    "comes with a negative sign , the hubble parameter @xmath10 , and @xmath11 vanishes when @xmath12 , consequently the quantum bounce occurs .    the warm inflation in the lqc scenario is considered by herrera @xcite recently .",
    "the author discussed the inflationary phenomenon described by a scalar field coupled to radiation . in this paper",
    ", we would like to consider a tachyon warm inflation in the lqc scenario .",
    "the tachyon field might be responsible for the inflation at the early stage and could contribute to some new form of dark matter at late times @xcite .",
    "the behavior of the tachyon field in lqc was studied by @xcite , in which the author considered the inverse volume modification and found that there exists a super accelerated phase in the semiclassical region .",
    "( for arbitrary matter , the universe will enter a super accelerated phase , this issue was first considered by @xcite . ) the tachyon field in lqc based on @xmath13 modification was studied by @xcite .",
    "the authors found that the inflation could be extended to the region where the classical inflation stops . in this paper , we consider the tachyon field is interacting with radiation during the inflationary stage .",
    "just as many authors have pointed out ( see @xcite , ect ) the dynamical behaviors of interacting field in lqc are very different from the ones in classical cosmology .",
    "the purpose of this paper is comparing the difference between the tachyon warm inflation in lqc and the one in classical cosmology , and also , we will compare the difference between the tachyon warm inflation and the tachyon ( cool ) inflation in lqc .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we present in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] the basic concepts of the tachyon warm inflation in the lqc scenario , and discuss in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] the exponential potential as an example of this tachyon warm inflation .",
    "we end this paper with some conclusions and discussions in sec .",
    "in the lqc scenario , the friedmann equation is modified as @xcite @xmath14 with the total energy density @xmath15 and the critical density @xmath16 , and @xmath7 . in our consideration , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 denotes the energy density of the tachyon field @xmath19 , and @xmath20 the radiation energy density .",
    "the dynamical equations for @xmath21 in the warm inflation scenario are @xmath22 where the dot means the derivation with respect to time , and @xmath23 is the dissipation coefficient responsible for the decay of energy density of the tachyon field into radiation during the inflationary era .",
    "@xmath23 can be considered as a constant or a function of the field @xmath19 , or the temperature @xmath24 , or both of them @xcite ; and , according to the second law of thermodynamics , @xmath25 should be hold . in this paper , for simplicity we only consider to be a constant . the energy density @xmath18 and the pressure @xmath26 of the tachyon field can be written as @xcite @xmath27 in which @xmath28 is the potential of the tachyon field .",
    "considering eqs.([drp ] ) and ( [ rp ] ) , one can get the equation of motion ( eom ) of the tachyon field @xmath29 in which @xmath30 .    in the lqc scenario ,",
    "the condition for a bounce is @xmath31 and @xmath32 , in which @xmath33 \\left(1 - 2\\frac{\\rho_\\phi+\\rho_\\gamma}{\\rho_c}\\right).\\label{dh}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this means that the universe will enter a super - inflation phase immediately after bouncing .",
    "this is the first stage of the inflation .",
    "the hubble parameter @xmath10 will be increasing in this stage .",
    "this stage is purely cased by the quantum effect and is very short @xcite .",
    "we do nt consider it in this paper .    according to eqs.([fri - eq ] ) and ( [ dh ] ) , the raychaudhuri equation can be written as @xmath34 \\right\\ } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the total pressure @xmath35 and the slow - roll parameter @xmath36 .",
    "inflation is often defined as a period of accelerated expansion , i.e. , @xmath37 . in this paper",
    ", we will focus on the evolution of the field in the slow - roll inflationary era . during this era ,",
    "the potential dominates over the kinetic energy of the tachyon field , i.e. @xmath38 , and the energy density of the radiation , i.e. , @xmath39 .",
    "we can also assume that @xmath40 and @xmath41\\dot{\\phi}$ ] in this region .",
    "then , the friedmann equation is reduced to @xmath42 and the eom of the tachyon field ( [ eom ] ) becomes @xmath43 in which @xmath44 is the rate defined as @xmath45 for a strong ( weak ) dissipative regime , we have @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) , i.e. , @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "the raychaudhuri equation can be rewritten as @xmath50 with @xmath51 the inflation ends when @xmath52 , this implies that @xmath53 .",
    "so , at the point of ending of the inflation , one has @xmath54 with the equation of state parameter of the tachyon field @xmath55 . in the classical cosmology , @xmath56 , it is easy to find that the inflation ends when @xmath57 , i.e. , @xmath58 ( see eq.([mod - ray ] ) and consider @xmath59 ) .",
    "but in the lqc scenario , if @xmath58 , @xmath60 , this means the energy density of the tachyon field should be zero at the inflation ending point .",
    "but it is easy to verify that @xmath61 when @xmath58 ( see eq.([rp ] ) ) .",
    "this means that the inflation phase still exists in lqc while the classical inflation stops .",
    "notice that we suppose the quantum effect can not be ignored .",
    "if @xmath62 where the quantum effect can ge ignored , just as @xcite argued , the quantum and the classical inflation have the same trajectory .",
    "this phenomena is as same as the tachyon ( cool ) inflation in lqc .",
    "this is not surprise . for the energy density of the tachyon field ( or the potential of the tachyon field ) dominates over the energy density of radiation .",
    "also , as the condition is in the classical tachyon warm inflation @xcite , we can consider that the radiation production is qusi - stable during the warm inflation region .",
    "then the energy density of radiation can be reduced as @xmath63 considering eqs.([rfri ] ) , ( [ reom ] ) and ( [ rg ] ) , one can obtain @xmath64    under those conditions , one can get the slow - roll parameter @xmath65}{[1-v(\\phi)/\\rho_c]^2}.\\label{vare}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the last fraction is caused by the modification of the quantum geometry .",
    "also , we can rewrite @xmath66 as a function of @xmath67 and the rate @xmath44 : @xmath68 the accelerated expansion occurs if @xmath69 , i.e. , @xmath37 .",
    "then , the relationship between @xmath18 and @xmath20 in the accelerated region is @xmath70 the inflation ends when the slow - roll conditions are violated , i.e. , @xmath71 , which implies @xmath72}{\\kappa v(\\phi)[1-v(\\phi)/\\rho_c]^2}= 2(1+r).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the number of e - folds before inflation ends is @xmath73}{v_{,\\phi}}(1+r)d\\phi .",
    "\\label{e - folds}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which @xmath74 denote the values of the tachyon field at the beginning and the end of inflation respectively .    comparing above equations with the ones in the classical scenario @xcite , one can find that the term modified by quantum geometry is very important in the inflationary regions . notice that we assume the inflation happens very near the quantum dominated region .",
    "if the inflation happens far away from the quantum dominated region , then the quantal modified term @xmath75 and the variables which are shown by above equation are as same as the ones in the classical cosmology . as an example , we will discuss the warm inflation of the tachyon field with an exponential potential in strong and weak dissipative regime .",
    "at the sec . [ sec2 ] we get the expressions for the variables of the tachyon warm inflation with general potential . as an example , we consider in this section the exponential potential @xcite @xmath76 with the constant @xmath77 and the tachyon mass @xmath78 ( with unit @xmath79 ) .",
    "the discussion will be concerned with the strong and weak dissipative regime . for simplicity , we just consider @xmath80 is a constant .      for a strong dissipative regime , we have @xmath46 , i.e. , @xmath81 . considering eqs.([reom ] ) and ( [ exp - p ] ) , one can get @xmath82 here , we have taken into account the condition of @xmath48 . and from now on , we will just consider @xmath23 as a constant dissipation coefficient , i.e. , @xmath80 .",
    "then , one can obtain the evolution of the tachyonic field : @xmath83 in which @xmath84 is the initial value of @xmath19 at the time that the slow - roll inflation begins .",
    "it is straightforward to see that @xmath85 is not the function of the quantum geometry correction @xmath86 .",
    "this is because we consider @xmath48 , then the hubble parameter is ignored when we consider the eom of the field .",
    "this is as same as the evolution in the tachyon warm inflation of the classical cosmology scenario @xcite , but is different from the standard inflation of tachyon field in lqc @xcite in which the correction came from the quantum geometry effects plays an important role .    to get an explicit expression of the number of e - folds",

    "the first is a stage of the super - inflation near the bouncing epoch as we discussed in the sec.[sec2 ] .",

    "the second stage of the inflation begins at the stage @xmath130 .",
    "this stage is far away from the bouncing epoch and the quantum correction is completely negligible .",
    "this is nothing but just the standard slow - roll inflation .",
    "the evolution pictures of two inflationary scenario have the same directions when we consider the same initial condition ( @xmath131 ) .",
    "the variable @xmath10 in warm inflation is bigger than the one in ( cool ) inflation at the same time .",
    "this is reasonable .",
    "since the total energy density @xmath15 in warm inflation includes the energy density of the tachyon field @xmath18 and the radiation @xmath20 , but the one in ( cool ) inflation just includes @xmath18 .",
    "we assume these two different inflation models have the same initial conditions .",
    "so @xmath132 at the same time .",
    "and we can find that the field @xmath19 in warm inflation is smaller than the one in ( cool ) inflation .",
    "this is because the energy density of the tachyon field decays into the radiation during the inflationary era .",
    "also , we can see the non - inflationary phase ( between the super - inflation and the slow - roll inflation ) in warm inflation is longer than the one in ( cool ) inflation .",
    "this phase is an indirect loop quantum gravity effect @xcite .",
    "it is easy to find that the slow - roll inflation is beginning at @xmath133 in the ( cool ) inflation but at @xmath134 in the warm inflation .    in this section",

    "if we consider the weak dissipative regime ( @xmath47 ) , the beginning time of the slow - roll inflation in warm inflation is later than the one in ( cool ) inflation when we consider the same initial condition .",
    "but due to the perturbation theory of loop quantum cosmology is still open , we can not get the parameters @xmath126 through the observational data .",
    "therefore it is still impossible to get the special total number of e - folds number .",
    "as showing in eq.([fri - eq ] ) , the friedmann equation in lqc adds a factor of @xmath8 in the right side of the standard friedmann equation .",
    "the correction term @xmath136 comes with a negative sign , this makes it possible that @xmath137 when @xmath12 , and the bounce occurs . at the bounce point , @xmath31 and @xmath138 is positive .",
    "the universe enters a super - inflation stage .",
    "( if one considers the inverse volume modification , the universe will also enter a super - inflation stage @xcite . )",
    "eq.([dh ] ) shows that @xmath138 continues to positive till @xmath139 ( at which point @xmath138 is vanishes , and after this point , it will become negative . ) .",
    "thus , every lqc solution has a super - inflation phase from @xmath12 to @xmath139 .",
    "however , we must recognize that this stage is very short , so that the super - inflation can not substitute for the slow - roll inflation .    in this paper",
    ", we studied the tachyon warm inflation model in the lqc scenario . at first , we considered the tachyon field with a general potential coupled with radiation field in the slow - roll inflation phase . during this inflationary era",
    ", the potential dominates over the kinetic energy of the tachyon field and the energy density of radiation .",
    "then the modified friedmann equation and rachaudhuri equation have the same expressions with the tachyon ( cool ) inflation in lqc .",
    "we found that the warm inflation phase in lqc will expand to the region where the classical inflation stops .",
    "the interacting term will modify the eom of the tachyon field in the slow - roll approximate .",
    "then the energy density of radiation has also been modified .",
    "based on those conditions , we got a general relationship between the tachyon field and radiation energy density , and obtained the relationship between @xmath67 in the accelerated region .",
    "we found that the number of e - folds before inflation ends depends on the modification term @xmath140 and the rate @xmath44 .",
