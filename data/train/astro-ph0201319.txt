    "t tauri stars ( ttss ) are young ( @xmath8 myr ) , roughly solar mass stars that have only recently emerged from their natal molecular clouds to become optically visible ( see reviews by * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "the presence of disks around classical ttss ( cttss ) is now well established observationally .",
    "millimeter wave measurements of the dust continuum from the outer disk can be used to estimate the disk mass , assuming a dust to gas ratio ( see review by zuckerman 2001 ) .",
    "such estimates typically yield masses of @xmath9 m@xmath10 , consistent with the minimum mass for the solar nebula ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "spectral line observations can be used to study the inner regions of the disk through their kinematic signatures .",
    "this has been done successfully for very young embedded sources using the infrared ( ir ) bands of co @xcite , but the results are confusing for the cttss that show co band emission @xcite .",
    "molecular hydrogen is expected to be @xmath11 times more abundant than other gas tracers such as co in the disks surrounding young stars .",
    "depending on the density , h@xmath0 can survive at temperatures of up to 4000 k ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and can self - shield well against uv radiation fields , making it an excellent diagnostic of disks around young stars .",
    "good probes of gas in circumstellar disks are needed to determine the lifetime of gas in these environments where planets likely form .",
    "most studies of disks to date have relied on the ir to millimeter wavelength spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of these young stars .",
    "these studies are mainly sensitive to micron - sized dust and have shown that the typical survival time for this dust is only a few million years @xcite .",
    "this does not mean , however , that the disks around these stars disappear on this short timescale .",
    "theories of giant planet formation suggest that after the dust collects into larger particles ( and no longer shows up in studies of the sed ) , the gas is still present in the disk for some time before it accretes onto the planets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . indeed ,",
    "if for most cttss the gas disappears from the disk on the same timescale as the dust does , it may be quite difficult to form giant gas planets .    molecular hydrogen around a ctts",
    "was first detected by 2.12183 @xmath12 m 1 - 0 s(1 ) line emission in the spectrum of t tau @xcite .",
    "@xcite discovered ultraviolet emission lines of h@xmath0 in an _ iue _  spectrum of t tau and identified them as fluorescent lines pumped by , which were previously seen in sunspot spectra . in both cases , it was apparent that the molecular hydrogen emission from t tau is spatially extended .",
    "subsequently , h@xmath0 has been studied often around cttss in both the ir and uv .",
    "@xcite surveyed young stellar objects in the ir , finding h@xmath0 emission in 4 cttss .",
    "the location of this h@xmath0 emission is very important .",
    "recent ground - based images of t tau show that the ir emission is quite extended , reaching to 20  from the star ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the extended ir h@xmath0 emission seen around t tau and other young embedded sources like l1448 @xcite is interpreted as shock heated emission from the interaction of the stellar / disk wind / jet with the surrounding cloud material ( see review by * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite used iso to detect h@xmath0 emission in the ir from 22 cttss , herbig ae / be stars , and debris - disk stars , but with a large aperture extending over 20  this emission may include both disk emission and spatially extended h@xmath0 emission from outflows .",
    "they assumed based on the strength of on - source versus off - source co emission that the bulk of the emission occurred in the circumstellar disks .",
    "however , @xcite attemped to detect on - source h@xmath0 emission from five of these sources using a small slit , but failed to detect any significant h@xmath0 emission .    magnetic quadrupole transitions of h@xmath0 in the ir are very weak , and electric dipole transitions within the ground electronic state are forbidden because h@xmath0 has no net dipole moment . in the uv , the large oscillator strengths of the electronic lyman - band ( b - x ) transitions lead to strong emission and absorption lines via transitions to and from the excited electronic state .",
    "@xcite observed h@xmath0 emission in the uv around 13 of 32 ttss studied with _",
    "@xcite go on to argue that the limited sensitivity of _ iue _  may be the only reason that h@xmath0 was not detected in the remaining 19 tts .",
    "@xcite attributed uv pumping to the excitation of h@xmath0 , because the observed flux in h@xmath0 lines scales with the total uv flux .",
    "the uv h@xmath0 lines of t tau are spatially extended beyond the disks thought to be in this system and may have substantial contributions from outflows .",
    "however , as described below , we do not think that the h@xmath0 lines from tw hya arise in a molecular outflow .",
    "more recently , @xcite detected fluorescent h@xmath0 around a sample of cttss with _ hst_/ghrs and attributed the pumping to the red wing of . @xcite and @xcite presented observations of circumstellar h@xmath0 absorption against the profiles of the herbig ae / be stars ab aur and dx cha , as observed with the far ultraviolet spectrograph explorer ( _ fuse _ ) .",

    "the outer radius of the disk extends more than 225 au @xcite from the star , and its inner truncation radius is about 0.3 au @xcite .",
    "@xcite found evidence from comparing the observed spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of tw hya to models of seds that grains in the inner @xmath20 au of the disk may have grown in size and settled towards the midplane , while dust and gas in the outer disk is well - mixed .",
    "the disk mass is roughly @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "based on submillimeter co emission and estimates for the disk mass , @xcite and @xcite determined that co is underabundant by a factor of @xmath22 around tw hya , with respect to a typical ism h@xmath0/co ratio of @xmath23 . there is no molecular cloud associated with tw hya @xcite , and therefore no opportunity to observe whether or not there is an outflow from h@xmath0 or co observations .",
    "@xcite reported the detection of h@xmath0 emission in the 1 - 0 s(1 ) line at 2.12183 @xmath12 m from tw hya , attributing this line to formation in the circumstellar disk , in which the h@xmath0 is excited by non - thermal electrons produced by x - ray ionization .",
    "tw hya is a strong x - ray source , with @xmath24 @xmath5 as measured with chandra by @xcite .",
    "these chandra observations indicated an overabundance of ne , an underabundance of o and fe , and solar - like abundances of si , mg and n in the x - ray emission region . from the sharply peaked emission measure distribution and high electron density , @xcite concluded that the x - ray emission is produced in an accretion shock .",

    "we used the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) on hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) to observe the pre - main sequence star tw hya on 2000 may 7 .",

    "fuse _  consists of 4 gratings with two channels each .",
    "the spectrum was re - binned to one wavelength bin per resolution element to increase signal - to - noise . in this paper",
    "we use spectra from the sic1a , lif1a , lif2b , and lif2a channels , covering the spectral regions 9151006  , 9901080  , 10951185 , and 10901180  , respectively .",
    "we calibrate the wavelengths of the lif1a and lif2a segments using h@xmath0 lines , and of the sic2a segment using ism absorption , to obtain an accuracy of @xmath29  .",
    "we detect in the stis  e140 m observation of tw hya over 200 emission lines in the 1140 - 1710   spectral region , shown in figures 12 .",
    "we use a database of over 19,000 h@xmath0 lyman - band lines @xcite and the @xcite atomic line database to identify lines based upon both coincidence with calculated ( for h@xmath0 ) or lab rest wavelengths ( for atoms ) and consistency of fluxes with predicted branching ratios from the upper state for h@xmath0 lines .",
    "we identify 143 h@xmath0 lines , including five blends , from 19 excited levels , listed in table 2 by upper level .",
    "following conventional spectroscopic notation , these lines are identified as r or p depending on the change in rotational quantum number of @xmath30 or @xmath31 , respectively , where @xmath32 refers to the rotational quantum number of h@xmath0 in the upper excitation state and @xmath33 refers to the rotational quantum number in the lower excitation state .",
    "for example , the line 0 - 4 p(1 ) at 1335.921   is the transition between @xmath34 , @xmath35 in the ground electronic state and @xmath36 , @xmath37 in the excited electronic state .",
    "we use the term _ progression _ to indicate the set of r and p transitions from a single excited level to the various available levels in the ground electronic state , as demonstrated in figure 3 .",
    "we describe our identification of lines by analyzing in detail the lines from the @xmath38 level in the excited electronic state .",
    "table [ tab : vu0ju17.tab ] shows the possible radiative transitions from this state .",
    "we detect five of the six transitions with the largest radiative de - excitation rates , @xmath39 , and calculate that the flux ratios are consistent with the branching ratios .",
    "the only undetected line among the strongest six transitions is 0 - 5 p(18 ) at 1548.146  .",
    "the flux at this wavelength is dominated by the blue side of the 1548   line , making the detection of the h@xmath0 line difficult .",
    "in addition to these 143 h@xmath0 lines from our stis observations , figure 4 shows the detection of the lyman - band h@xmath0 transitions 1 - 1 p(5 ) at 1161.864   and 1 - 1 r(3 ) at 1148.751   in the _ fuse _  spectra of tw hya @xcite .    in table",
    "[ tab : tentative ] we list 15 tentatively identified h@xmath0 lyman - band lines from 10 different excited levels . based on branching ratios , these lines should be among the strongest lines from a given excited level , and a transition to that excited level coincides with a strong emission feature .",
    "for these tentative identifications , emission in the other transitions from the same upper level is either masked by strong emission features , occurs shortward of the spectral region we observed , is obscured by a wind absorption feature in an atomic line , or is too weak to be clearly identified as emission .",
    "for example , we identify a narrow feature at 1593.826 tentatively as emission in the h@xmath0 transition 3 - 10 r(5 ) , the second strongest transition from @xmath40 , with a calculated rest wavelength of 1593.751  . the strongest transition from this excited state , 3 - 10 p(7 ) at 1611.315  , appears to be weakly present .",
    "the third and fourth strongest lines , 3 - 1 r(5 ) and 3 - 1 p(7 ) , have wavelengths shortward of the stis  bandpass .",
    "this observation is too short to detect the weaker lines .",
    "the excited level for this transition may be pumped by via the 3 - 2 r(5 ) transition at 1175.248  .",
    "we do not use these tentatively identified h@xmath0 lines in further analysis .",
    "a similar test of over 75,000 co lines from the kurucz database failed to identify any groups of co lines in the spectrum of tw hya ; we therefore consider the coincidence of individual co transitions with observed emission lines as random chance .",
    "the usual electronic pumping routes through the multiplet at 1305  , as seen in giant stars such as @xmath16 boo @xcite do not appear to occur in tw hya ( see figure 5 ) . a number of weak , narrow emission lines from 13541357   may be co a - x emission , pumped by h@xmath0 emission at 1393.9   via transitions within the thermal width of the h@xmath0 line .      observing with a @xmath41 aperture , for tw hya s distance of 56 pc , we detect h@xmath0 emission that occurs spatially within 14 au of the star .",
    "the stis  e140 m mode can provide some information on the spatial extent of the h@xmath0 emission across the aperture .",
    "we analyze separately the spatial distribution of h@xmath0 lines with wavelengths @xmath42  , @xmath43  , and @xmath44  , because the width of the instrumental spatial profile increases towards lower wavelengths @xcite . in this analysis",
    ", we do not use h@xmath0 lines contaminated by , , , or emission .",
    "we co - add the spatial extent of many h@xmath0 lines and compare their spatial distribution to other lines with similar wavelengths .",
    "the  1215.67   line , the 1549   doublet , and the 1640   line are probably produced in the accretion shock near the stellar surface ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and therefore should be spaitially unresolved and represent a good estimate of the spatial profile in the cross - dispersion direction .",
    "cooler lines , such as the 1304   triplet and the multiplets at 1561   and 1657  , may be produced in the accretion shock or may also be somewhat extended .",
    "the geocoronal line uniformly fills the aperture .",
    "we use the order locations on the detector to identify the location of each h@xmath0 line and then extract a subimage , a @xmath45 pixel region around the brightest pixel at this location .",
    "we co - add these subimages , and then create normalized spatial profiles for h@xmath0 from 3 pixel ( 011 ) wide swaths and for atomic lines from 7 pixel ( 026 ) wide swaths centered on the brightest pixel .",
    "although the brightest pixel is offset in different wavelength bins by up to half a pixel , this only slightly affects the central region of the spatial profile and does not affect the wings of the profile .",
    "figure 6 shows that the h@xmath0 profile has more power in the wings of the spatial profile than the high - temperature lines and , although the wings are comparable to the extent of emission .",
    "geocoronal  emission , which uniformly fills the aperture , is clearly more extended than the h@xmath0 emission .    in figure 6c",
    "we compare the spatial extent of emission and h@xmath0 emission lines above 1500  .",
    "we split these h@xmath0 lines into 9 lines with flux above and 36 lines below @xmath46 erg @xmath2 s@xmath3 .",
    "the stronger h@xmath0 lines do not show the broad wings that the weak emission lines show .",
    "similarly , we compare emission at the peak wavelength to emission on the edge of its spectral profile .",
    "the spatial profile from the peak emission strongly resembles the spatial profile of the strong h@xmath0 lines , while the spatial profile from the weak wings of the profile strongly resembles the spatial profile of the weak h@xmath0 emission lines .",
    "this relationship , with weak h@xmath0 lines having broader wings than strong h@xmath0 lines , holds for all wavelengths .",
    "this weak emission in the wings may be due to a weak extended background uv source or detector background .",
    "we conclude that the h@xmath0 emission is not extended in the cross - dispersion direction beyond the @xmath6 resolution of the telescope , comparable to 2.8 au , or a 1.4 au radius from the central star .",
    "we fitted most of the emission lines with either a single or , for blended lines , multiple gaussians .",
    "several lines were not fitted because their profiles are non - gaussian , as shown by many examples in figure 7 .",
    "the profiles of  1215.67  , the 1549   doublet , the 1240   doublet , the 1640.5   line , the 977   line , and the 1335.7   line show strong redshifted emission with a sharp blue edge .",
    "ism absorption appears in the 1302  , 1334.5   line , 1526.7  , and in the 2800 doublet , centered at the rest wavelength of these transitions in the heliocentric frame .",
    "the low - temperature 1305   triplet , 1335   doublet , 1492.6  , and lines at 1526.7   and 1533.4  , along with the 2800   doublet in the nuv , have p - cygni profiles that indicate winds of @xmath47 .",
    "physical properties that can be inferred from these lines will be determined in a subsequent paper .",
    "we do not observe h@xmath0 absorption within the  profile , even though the h@xmath0 must absorb the  photons to cause the fluorescence ( see  5 ) . in _",
    "hst_/stis  observations of mira b , @xcite detect h@xmath0 absorption against as well as the corresponding fluorescence . our _ fuse _",
    "observations do not show significant h@xmath0 absorption against the profiles .",
    "these unseen h@xmath0 lines , with @xmath48 , have been observed in other pms stars @xcite . because there is no h@xmath0 absorption in our line of sight , if the h@xmath0 is in a circumstellar shell or outflow around tw hya , then the shell or outflow must be clumpy enough such that the h@xmath0 is not in our line of sight to the star . in paper",
    "ii we will quantify this conclusion .",
    "the observed  profile is characterized by a strong red wing , possibly produced in the accretion shock , and a dark , wide absorption feature that extends to -700 .",
    "the large width of the  line may be caused by pressure broadening , which @xcite argue produces the broad wings of h@xmath16 based on modelling its line profile .",
    "the absorption feature is probably caused by a combination of wind , circumstellar , and interstellar absorption . in paper",
    "ii we will analyze the  profile in greater detail , including on a comparison between the observed  profile and a synthetic  profile reconstructed from h@xmath0 emission line fluxes .    to correct for instrumental line broadening ,",
    "we now calculate the spectral line - spread function of the detector .",
    "we determined in  3.2 that emission in both atomic and molecular lines is not spatially extended in the cross - dispersion direction .",
    "if the emission is also not extended in the dispersion direction , then from the spatial distribution of emission we can determine the spectral line - spread function .",
    "we fit multiple gaussians to the spatial distribution of h@xmath0 in three regions : @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 .",
    "we then multiply the fwhm of these gaussians by 0.82 , which is the ratio of the plate scale of the detector in the cross - dispersion direction to the plate scale in the dispersion direction due to anamorphic magnification .",
    "we then fit emission lines with gaussians , correcting for the spectral line - spread function , to obtain intrinsic line widths .",
    "parameters of these fits to atomic and unidentified lines are listed in table [ tab : linelist.tab ] .",
    "we only list the flux from our gaussian fits to h@xmath0 lines because there are so many and they are all similar .",
    "we measured the flux of the two _ fuse _",
    "h@xmath0 in the lif1b and lif2a channels separately and co - added the flux of each line , weighted by the error in the flux .",
    "the @xmath41 aperture is not a supported operating mode for stis .",
    "the line - spread function we calculate from the spatial profile of the h@xmath0 emission is similar to the line - spread function determined by @xcite for the @xmath49 aperture , and as expected , they are slightly broader for the @xmath50 aperture . we show in figure 8 that the mean observed fwhm of h@xmath0 lines is @xmath51 , before removing instrumental broadening .",
    "two lines , 1 - 8 p(11 ) at 1603.164   and 1 - 4 r(3 ) at 1314.690  , have anomalous widths of more than 30  and are not used in future analysis . after removing instrumental broadening with our calculated spectral line - spread function ,",
    "the average fwhm of the 30 h@xmath0 lines with fluxes above @xmath52 erg @xmath2 s@xmath3 is @xmath53 , which corresponds to a temperature of 6200 k if the broadening were entirely thermal .",
    "although we believe our calculated spectral line - spread function is more accurate for our data than the line - spread function given in @xcite for the @xmath49 aperture , we calculate a fwhm of @xmath54  when we correct for instrumental broadening using the line - spread function for the @xmath49 aperture . in paper",
    "ii we will determine the temperature of the h@xmath0 emission region and calculate the non - thermal broadening of the h@xmath0 emission .",
    "figure 9 shows that the mean velocity shift of 137 h@xmath0 lines is @xmath55 , with respect to rest wavelengths calculated by @xcite .",
    "we used a conservative error estimate of 0.75  for the assumed random uncertainty in the rest wavelengths , which is slightly larger than the difference between observed and calculated wavelengths , as given by @xcite .",
    "the velocity shift of h@xmath0 lines , given the approximate @xmath56  uncertainty in wavelength zero - point calibration for stis e140 m spectra @xcite , is consistent with previous photospheric radial velocity measurements : @xmath57  @xcite , @xmath58  @xcite , @xmath59  @xcite , and @xmath60  @xcite .",
    "the velocity shift for 30 lines shortward of 1350   is @xmath61 , compared with @xmath62  for 67 lines between 1350   and 1550  , and @xmath54  for 29 lines above 1550  , confirming the excellent relative wavelength scale of stis .",
    "emission in lines of , , , and , from gas at @xmath63 k , is probably produced in an accretion flow near the surface of the star @xcite , as indicated by their broad red wings , which may be produced by rapidly inflowing hot gas .",
    "this emission may also be produced in a stellar transition region , although these red wings are broader than emission from most active stars with a coronal emission source ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the ratio of flux in the doublet near 1550   to the flux in the doublet at 1400   is 30 . in a study of eight cttss with _",
    "hst_/ghrs , @xcite found that this ratio varies from 0.5 to 3 in stars that show emission , but emission was conspicuously absent from a number of these stars . in spectra of main - sequence and giant stars ,",

    "* ) . in giant stars such as @xmath16 boo",
    ", the si iv doublet may be absorbed by bound - free absorption below 1525   @xcite .",
    "when this absorption occurs , we expect continuum absorption to quench any emission , as is observed for @xmath16 boo ( ayres , private communication ) , but we detect strong emission at 1238   and 1243  .",
    "temperature effects probably do not explain the weakness of the features because it is formed at 80,000 k , close to the 100,000 k formation temperature of .",
    "strong emission in the red wing of the line at 977.0 indicates the presence of cooler material in the accretion flow , while a strong red wing in , , and emission indicates hotter material in the flow .",
    "we do not detect features at 1206   and 1296  , which are strong in main - sequence and active stars , and the features at 1309.3  , 1526.7  , and 1533.3   are weak .",
    "in addition , @xcite find in iue spectra of tw hya that the ] 1892   line is also fairly weak , although a reasonable amount of flux is present in the ] 1808   and ] 1817   lines .",
    "all of this leads us to speculate that si may be underabundant in the accretion flow . in the gas phase of the ism , si is underabundant by a factor of 100 relative to solar because si readily depletes onto grains @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite provide evidence that grains in a circumstellar disk settle near the midplane .",
    "@xcite showed that ionized material at the surface of the disk couples to the magnetic field , and thereby preferentially accretes onto the star .",
    "silicon may therefore be underabundant in the accretion flow because it is predominantly located in grains at the circumstellar midplane that do not participate in the accretion .",
    "if most of the si is bound in grains , then we might expect strong sio emission from stellar disks when the accretion shock has underabundant emission , since the formation of sio is one step towards the incorporation of si into dust . @xcite and",
    "@xcite find a broad hump in the ir region 8 - 13 @xmath12 m , which they attribute to a combination of silicates , and @xcite conclude that the disk of tw hya contains several hundred earth masses of condensed silicates and ices .",
    "if depletion onto grains in a tts environment resembles similar processes in the ism , then other refractory elements such as fe should also be underabundant .",
    "unfortunately , analysis of the strength of nuv lines is complicated , partly because most of them are photoexcited by  @xcite , and there are no other fe lines available for us to study .",
    "@xcite found solar - like abundances of si and mg , an underabundance of fe and o , and an overabundance of ne in the chandra spectrum of tw hya .",
    "they attributed the x - ray emission to the accretion shock , which disagrees with previous models in which x - rays from ttss are produced in a coronae ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "if this is the case , then our speculation that si is underabundant in the accreting gas would be incorrect .",
    "we also note that we do not detect emission at 1351.7  , which is strong in most stars due to pumping by .",
    "we will pursue these abundance issues further in a future paper .",
    "we identify 19 progressions of h@xmath0 lines , each with a distinct upper vibrational level @xmath64 and rotational level . in table 6 , we list these progressions , including the number of detected lines and flux ( @xmath65 ) in each progression .",
    "ten other progressions listed in table 3 include the 15 tentatively identified h@xmath0 lines .",
    "figure 10 shows that most levels in the excited electronic state are photoexcited by transitions coincident with .",
    "figure 11 shows that the lower levels of these transitions are the lowest energy levels with transitions coincident with , indicating that the level populations may be thermal .",
    "the doublet , doublet , and multiplet also pump some of these levels .",
    "the observed  profile includes a broad absorption feature with fwhm about @xmath66 , produced by neutral h in the ism , circumstellar material , and a wind from tw hya or its disk .",
    "we detect no flux due to either  or h@xmath0 emission in this dark absorption line .",
    "this absorption feature coincides with several h@xmath0 transitions that pump the excited state , so most of the  absorption must occur after the  emission encounters the h@xmath0 .",
    "we demonstrate the identification of a pumping mechanism for a given excited level by returning to the case of @xmath67 . because most of the h@xmath0 is in the ground electronic state , and",
    "the low transition probabilities preclude any collisional redistribution of h@xmath0 within the excited electronic state , one of the transitions shown in table [ tab : vu0ju17.tab ] must pump the @xmath67 level . of these transitions , only the 0 - 5 p(18 ) 1548.213   line overlaps with a strong emission line observed in the tw hya spectrum . the weak h@xmath0 feature at",
    "1381   is unable to pump a significant amount of h@xmath0 into the @xmath67 level .",
    "the continuum at the wavelengths of these transitions is also unable to pump an appreciable amount of h@xmath0 into this level .",
    "the 0 - 2 r(16 ) transition , which would be observed at 1335.357  , falls in between the 1335 doublet",
    ". we do not expect significant blue emission from the 1335.7 line in this doublet .",
    "the 1334.5   line probably has a strong red wing similar to the 1335.7   line , but this wing is absorbed by a wind in 1335.7  .",
    "we estimate that the strength of the 1334.5   line at + 180  is @xmath68 erg @xmath2 s@xmath3 , which is the strength of the 1335.7   line at the same position .",
    "this flux is a factor of 10 weaker than the flux available to pump this upper level .",
    "the lower levels for 0 - 2 r(16 ) and 0 - 5 p(18 ) have energies 2.8 ev and 3.8 ev , respectively , that are too high to have a significant population at sensible temperatures .",
    "the @xmath69 level is particularly difficult to populate .",
    "we conclude that either the 0 - 5 p(18 ) transition at 1548.213   or the 0 - 2 r(16 ) transition at 1335.357   pumps this upper level .",
    "the pumping mechanism for almost all other levels is well determined .",
    "the pumping transitions listed in table 6 require significant populations in the lower rovibrational levels .",
    "changes in these level populations may alter which pumping mechanism is most important for certain excited levels . at low temperatures , the ground vibrational level will be much more populated than excited vibrational levels . as a result , @xmath70 and @xmath71",
    "would be pumped by the continuum via 0 - 0 p(1 ) at 1110.062   and 0 - 0 p(2 ) at 1110.119  , respectively . however , because we do not observe other progressions that would be pumped by the continuum , we conclude that the gas temperature is sufficiently high that  pumps these excited levels .",
    "the @xmath72 level is pumped by both 1174   via the 3 - 2 p(4 ) transition at 1174.923   and by  via the 3 - 3 p(2 ) transition at 1217.031  .",
    "pumping of the @xmath67 and the tentative route @xmath73 can not possibly occur if the h@xmath0 populations are thermal because the energy of the lower level for the routes which populate these levels are very high ; we claim that the emission pumps these former via 0 - 3 p(25 ) at 1547.971  , and that and emission pumps the latter , as described above .",
    "the lower level @xmath74 for the first transition has an energy of 4.2 ev , compared with the 4.5 ev dissociation energy of the h@xmath0 molecule .",
    "one h@xmath0 transition , 0 - 4 r(1 ) at 1333.851  , with a flux of @xmath75 erg @xmath2 s@xmath3 , is about six times weaker than would be expected by branching ratios .",
    "its counterpart , 0 - 4 p(3 ) at 1342.314  , has a similar branching ratio and lower energy level , and a flux of @xmath76 erg @xmath2 . in paper ii",
    ", we will show quantitatively that this particular line is anomalously weak , and that it is the only line that is signifcantly weaker than predicted by our modelling .",
    "we conclude that this h@xmath0 line , which is centered at 130  to the blue side of the 1334.5   line , is absorbed by a wind component of this line .",
    "this result places the wind in our line of sight to the h@xmath0 emission region , and constrains the plausible geometries of tw hya s circumstellar environment .",
    "we now analyze the velocity shifts and line fwhms pumped from levels with @xmath77 ev and @xmath78 ev separately .",
    "as discussed in  3.3 , the velocity shift of h@xmath0 lines increases slightly with increasing wavelength , probably because of the relative wavelength accuracy of stis .",
    "we correct for these changes by fitting a line to the velocity shift and wavelength of each transition .",
    "we find that the velocity shift of 37 lines pumped from high energy levels is an average of @xmath79  above the estimated velocity , while the velocity shift of the 65 lines pumped from low - excitation levels is @xmath80  from the estimated velocity shift .",
    "the accuracy of the wavelengths calculated by @xcite compared with laboratory wavelengths indicates that there is most likely not a wavelength bias for high - energy lines .",
    "thus , the difference in the mean velocity shift between the two groups of h@xmath0 lines is likely real .",
    "we now consider a circumstellar shell , an outflow , the stellar photosphere , and a disk as possible places of origin for the h@xmath0 emission .",
    "we have a number of pieces of evidence to discriminate between models .",
    "the h@xmath0 emission is not shifted by more than 3  relative to the photospheric radial velocity .",
    "the spatial extent of the emission indicates that most of it occurs within @xmath6 from the star .",
    "the  profile shows no h@xmath0 absorption , which gives an upper limit to the amount of h@xmath0 in our line of sight .",
    "finally , the wind feature absorbs h@xmath0 emission , which indicates that lies in our line of sight to the warm h@xmath0 .",
    "warm molecular emission has in the past been interpreted as shock - heated emission due to an outflow interacting with the surrounding ambient molecular material .",
    "however , the twa is isolated from any molecular cloud , so this type of emission is difficult to accept .",
    "molecular emission is absorbed by a wind component in the line at 1334.5  , which would not occur in most shell models .",
    "the h@xmath0 progressions pumped near line - center of ly@xmath16 probably would not occur because of absorption in the wind .",
    "assuming the outflow interacts with surrounding material at a large distance from the star , the h@xmath0 emission should be more extended .",
    "consequently , we rule out emission from a surrounding molecular cloud",
    ".    molecular gas could become entrained in an outflow , or perhaps form part of the outflow , which could produce emission from hot h@xmath0 gas . in this scenario ,",
    "the star would have to be extremely close to face - on so that we do not observe either spatial extent in the h@xmath0 emission or h@xmath0 absorption against the ly@xmath16 emission .",
    "however , we rule out velocity shifts greater than 3  for the h@xmath0 emission , which is inconsistent with expected outflow velocities .",
    "@xcite determined that co absorption near 1.6 @xmath12 m occurs in the photosphere of most ttss .",
    "the data analyzed here are roughly consistent with an origin of the h@xmath0 emission in the photosphere .",
    "if the h@xmath0 is produced in the photosphere , then it should be detected in the ir around naked ttss ( ntts ) as well as cttss , but this emission has not yet been detected . in a study of h@xmath0 fluorescence with _",
    "hst_/ghrs , @xcite detected h@xmath0 emission from eight cttss but did not detect h@xmath0 emission from the one ntts in their sample .",
    "this result is consistent with a disk origin of h@xmath0 emission , if the gas disappears from the disk on the same timescales that dust disappears .",
    "however , because this h@xmath0 emission is reprocessed  emission , nttss may not show h@xmath0 emission because their atomic emission lines are typically weak .",
    "even with weak profiles ,  may still be strong near the center of the line profile . in figure 10 ,",
    "two progressions are pumped near the rest wavelength of , and fluoresence in these progressions could in principle be seen from nttss .",
    "this comparison requires further observations with greater sensitivity than _",
    "hst_/ghrs offered in order to interpret the results .",
    "we conclude that the most likely site of h@xmath0 emission is in the disk .",
    "a disk origin satisfies all of our requirements listed above .",
    "the fluorescence could only occur in the surface layer of the disk , because grains would absorb any uv radiation below a certain depth . in paper ii",
    ", we will calculate the physical properties of the h@xmath0 emission region .",
    "the h@xmath0 fluorescence typically occurs in warm regions ( @xmath81 k ) , which may pose certain problems in comparing this conclusion with disk models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "from the temperature of the disk , we will calculate the thermal broadening of the h@xmath0 emission and subsequently spatially constrain the h@xmath0 emission using its orbital velocity .",
    "if this h@xmath0 fluorescence occurs in a disk , then the line profiles from stars with higher inclinations should be wider . in _",
    "spectra of the df tau , with an edge - on disk , @xcite found that fwhm of the h@xmath0 emission lines were typically about 25 , while we calculate a fwhm of 18 for the face - on system tw hya .",
    "@xcite determined from co absorption that the @xmath82 of df tau is @xmath83 , compared with @xmath84 for tw hya .",
    "the additional broadening observed in the h@xmath0 lines of df tau may result either from a faster orbital velocity if the h@xmath0 is in the disk , or a faster stellar rotation if the h@xmath0 is in the photosphere .",
    "our analysis of the ultraviolet spectra of tw hya obtained with the stis instrument on _ hst _  and with _ fuse _",
    "lead to the following conclusions :    \\1 .",
    "the 12501650   spectrum is dominated by molecular hydrogen fluorescence in 143 lyman band lines .",
    "the observed flux in these lines is @xmath1 erg @xmath2 s@xmath3 , corresponding to @xmath85 at the stellar distance of 56 pc .",
    "the h@xmath0 spectrum is pumped to the excited electronic state mainly by transitions coincident with the broad  emission line .",
    "other lines , such as the 1335   doublet , 1175   multiplet , and the 1550   doublet may also pump some h@xmath0 to the excited electronic state .",
    "the h@xmath0 emission is not spatially extended from the star , given a resolution of @xmath6 , corresponding to 2.8 au at 56 pc . with a face - on disk ,",
    "the h@xmath0 emission is produced within 1.5 au of the central star .",
    "the wavelengths of the h@xmath0 emission is not shifted by more than 3  with respect to the photospheric velocity of the star .",
    "the stellar wind occurs in our line of sight to the h@xmath0 emission region , based upon the anomolously weak flux in an h@xmath0 line that has a wavelength coincident with a wind feature of 1334.5  .",
    "no significant h@xmath0 absorption is detected against the  profile or the emission lines .",
    "the h@xmath0 emission likely originates in the surface layer of a disk , rather than a circumstellar shell or an outflow .",
    "we can not rule out the possibility that the h@xmath0 emission is produced in the stellar photosphere .    \\7 .",
    "silicon ii , iii , and iv lines are anomolously weak in the uv , possibly because si depletes onto grains that accumulate in the disk midplane and decouples from the surface material of the disk that preferentially accretes .",
    "thus the accretion column responsible for the high temperature emission lines would then be very silicon - poor .",
    "models of the accretion shock are needed to further probe this possibility .",
