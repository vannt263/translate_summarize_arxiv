    "the existence of high velocity stars in the galactic halo is an ascertained feature .",
    "some of them have speed sufficient to escape the galaxy gravitational potential .",
    "they may have gained such high velocities thanks to different physical mechanisms , as three - body interactions among binary systems in star clusters or with the massive black hole in the galactic centre .",
    "high velocity stars can be divided in two different categories , i.e. runaway stars and hypervelocity stars .",
    "runaway stars , historically defined in the context of o and b stars @xcite , are galactic halo stars with peculiar motions higher than @xmath3 km s@xmath4 ( although the definition of runaway star is not univocal ) .",
    "young massive stars are not expected to be observed in the halo far from star - forming regions , since special conditions , as the presence of molecular clouds with dense cores , are required to form such stars .",
    "therefore , they are thought to be born not in the halo , but rather to have travelled far from their birthplace .",
    "there are two proposed mechanisms for the production of runaway stars : supernova ejections and dynamical ejections @xcite .    in the supernova ejection mechanism",
    "@xcite a runaway star is supposed to have origin in a binary system when its companion explodes as a supernova .",
    "the maximum possible ejection velocity is given by the sum of the orbital velocity of the progenitor binary and of the supernova kick velocity .",
    "additional effects may come from asymmetric explosions @xcite , but , in any case , runaways velocities are below the galactic escape velocity . in the dynamical ejection mechanism @xcite",
    "the runaway star derives from a three- or four - body interaction .",
    "for example , if a binary system interacts with a massive star , one member of the binary could be captured by the massive star , while the other star may be ejected with high velocity @xcite . in this case",
    ", the maximum possible ejection velocity is the escape velocity of the most massive star .",
    "observations show that both the ejection mechanisms operate in nature @xcite .",
    "hypervelocity stars ( hvs ) are stars escaping the host galaxy .",
    "@xcite was the first to predict theoretically their existence as a consequence of interactions with a massive black hole ( bh ) in the galactic centre , while @xcite serendipitously discovered the first hvs in the outer stellar halo , a b - type star moving over twice the galactic escape velocity .",
    "the most recent hvs survey is the mmt ( multiple mirror telescope ) survey , a spectroscopic survey of stars within the range of colours of @xmath5 m@xmath6 late b - type stars @xcite .",
    "the mmt observational approach is justified by that such stars should not exist at faint magnitudes in the outer halo unless they were ejected until those distances .",
    "actually , such stars have relatively short lifetimes and should originate in a region of on - going star formation .",
    "the mmt survey revealed @xmath7 hypervelocity stars ejected from the milky way at distances between @xmath8 and @xmath9 kpc .",
    "however , the mmt survey is able to measure only the component along the line of sight of the velocity vector . to compute the other velocity components , a measure of proper motions",
    "is needed .",
    "this is in most of the cases not possible ( but for some special cases @xcite ) , because hvss found by mmt survey are very distant so that their proper motions are too small ( @xmath10 mas yr@xmath4 ) to be measured with ground - based telescopes .",
    "moreover , as said above , the mmt survey is biased to the observation of stars within the colour range of @xmath5 m@xmath6 late b - type stars , although an observational effort to find an older population of hvs @xcite has been done , unsuccessfully , in the last years .",
    "hills mechanism involves the tidal breakup of a binary passing close to a massive bh .",
    "this mechanism was analyzed by other authors in the attempt to shed light on the properties of the stars that are accelerated in such a way @xcite .",
    "the tidal breakup of a binary could lead also to a population of stars orbiting in the inner regions of the galaxy around the central bh , the so - called s stars @xcite . since the hills prediction",
    ", a lot of other mechanisms have been proposed in the literature to explain the production of high velocity and hypervelocity stars , which involve different astrophysical frameworks and phenomena @xcite :    * the interaction of a super massive black hole binary ( smbhb ) with a single star in the nucleus of the host galaxy . in this way",
    "stars can be accelerated at velocities high enough to escape the local gravitational potential @xcite ; * some stars can come from another ( nearby ) galaxy with a high velocity relative to the present galactic environment @xcite ; * the close encounter of a hard massive binary star and a single massive star could produce stars with velocities larger than the local escape velocity @xcite ; * a supernova explosion in a close binary can give a kick to the companion to accelerate it to a very high velocity @xcite .",
    "an interesting point is that , as shown by @xcite and @xcite , hvs in our galaxy have both slow and rapid rotations , suggesting different acceleration mechanisms .",
    "note indeed that hvss originated by a binary disrupted by a black hole are not expected to be fast rotators and so this origin is unlikely for fast rotating hvss .",
    "therefore , since hvs production mechanisms should involve different astrophysical frameworks and phenomena , it would be possible to infer information about different pieces of physics , as that of the three - body interaction , the physics of the region near massive bhs @xcite as well as the physics of supernovae .",
    "moreover , the study of the proper motions of such fast moving stars can improve the knowledge of the galaxy gravitational potential shape , of its dark matter component @xcite and , in line of principle , may lead to useful information also for cosmology @xcite .    observations of high velocity and hypervelocity objects have been limited to high - mass , early - type stars due to obvious observational bias .",
    "observers have started investigating low - mass high velocity stars only recently @xcite , some of which are low - mass hvs candidates .",
    "the european esa satellite gaia is expected to measure proper motions with a precision of @xmath11 mas yr@xmath4 and so will be able to provide for a larger and less biased sample . furthermore ,",
    "gaia _ is expected to find @xmath12 hvss in a sample of @xmath13 stars .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate another mechanism of production of high velocity stars , which involve a globular cluster ( gc ) that during its orbit has the chance to pass close to an smbh in the center of its host galaxy .",
    "this chance is increased by the orbital decay suffered by massive clusters moving a dense galactic environment , which makes significant the dynamical friction braking exerted by the stars of the galaxy @xcite . for these test cases",
    ", we assumed @xmath14 m@xmath1 with the scope of identify at better the underlying physical mechanism .",
    "the paper is organized this way : in sect .",
    "[ sec : meth ] we outline and describe our approach to the study of the consequences of the gc - smbh interaction ; in sect .",
    "[ sec : res ] the results are presented and discussed ; in sect . [",
    "sec : con ] we draw the conclusions .",
    "significant details are given in the appendix .",
    "our scattering experiments refer to the interaction of three different bodies : a super massive black hole ( smbh ) , a globular cluster ( gc ) and a star . in our simulations the smbh sits initially in the origin of the reference frame , while the gc follows an elliptical orbit at a relatively close distance around it .",
    "the assumption of close distance to the bh is motivated by that the globular cluster is supposed orbitally decayed by dynamical friction braking , as discussed in arca sedda et al .",
    "( in preparation ) . given the bh influence radius as that within which the bh potential dominates    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the stars velocity dispersion in the central galactic region , we can treat the dynamics of the star interacting with the environment as a 3-body ( gc , smbh and test star around the gc ) problem whenever the relevant fly - by passage occurs within the distance @xmath17 from the smbh .",
    "in the cases studied in this paper ( sect . [ sec : res ] ) , @xmath18 pc , which means that the choice we make in this paper of 10 pc as radius of the gc circular reference orbit , with the values of pericenters distances ( around which the scattering is effective ) given in table 1 , is fully compatible with the neglect of the smooth external field .    actually , neglecting the stellar background potential ,",
    "the mechanical energy ( per unit mass ) of the gc on a circular orbit of radius @xmath19 is    @xmath20    given that the circular velocity is @xmath21 .",
    "consequently , taking into account that the angular momentum per unit mass of the gc on the circular orbit around the bh is @xmath22 , the pericenter ( @xmath23 ) and apocenter ( @xmath24 ) distances of the gc on orbits of same energy ( @xmath25 ) but different angular momentum @xmath26 are given by    @xmath27    of course in the above equation the @xmath28 sign gives the pericenter and the @xmath29 sign gives the apocenter . in conclusion , once we have , as reference , a circular orbit of radius @xmath19 we may compare it with a set of orbits at same energy just varying the ratio @xmath30 .",
    "the eccentricity of the orbit is , trivially ,    @xmath31    we varied the parameter    @xmath32    in order to sample gc orbits of different eccentricity and same orbital energy . of course ,",
    "@xmath33 for radial orbits ( @xmath34 ) and @xmath35 for circular orbits ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "the cartesian reference frame has been chosen as that with the @xmath37-axis along the line connecting the gc with the smbh and @xmath38-axis orthogonal , so that the @xmath39 frame is equiverse to the gc orbital revolution .    in the restricted three - body problem",
    ", it is well known the existence of the hill s surfaces which enclose the two finite - mass bodies @xcite .",
    "the radius of the hill s sphere , given by @xmath40 defines the spherical volume around the gc where its gravitational potential dominates . outside the hill s sphere",
    ", the bh potential overcomes the one of the cluster . for the set of parameters used in our scattering experiments , @xmath41 pc @xmath42 pc , @xmath43 pc @xmath44 pc and @xmath45 pc @xmath46 pc for a gc of mass @xmath47 m@xmath6 , @xmath48 m@xmath6 and @xmath49 m@xmath6 , respectively .",
    "a meaningful study refers to the fate of stars moving around the gc with orbits initially all within the gc influence radius .",
    "therefore , we put the initial circular orbits , on which the test star moves around the gc , inside this sphere by setting the radius of this orbit to be a fraction ( @xmath50 ) of the distance from the first lagrange point ( l1 ) and the gc .    for the sake of statistical significance , once fixed the unperturbed star circular orbit we sampled cases with initial different phases , in the range @xmath51 at increments of @xmath52 @xcite .    to summarize , in this paper the values of the relevant initial parameters",
    "have been set as follows ( see also table 1 ) :    * the super massive black hole mass is @xmath14 m@xmath6 ; * the globular cluster mass , @xmath53 , assumes the three values @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 m@xmath6 ; * the test star mass , @xmath54 , is set equal to @xmath55 m@xmath6 ; * the gc reference circular orbit has the radius @xmath56 pc ; * the gc orbital eccentricity ranges from @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) to @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) and is parametrized varying @xmath61 at steps of @xmath11 ; * the test star circular orbit radius around the gc is parametrized by @xmath62 , whose values are in the range @xmath63 ; * the star initial position on the circular orbit of given radius ( see above ) is parametrized by adopting a set of 24 different angles spanning @xmath51 with a @xmath52 step ; * the star circular orbit around the gc and the gc orbit respect to the bh are coplanar .",
    "the choice of the range of @xmath64 , and consequently of @xmath65 , toward large values of @xmath65 , is due to that ( as we will see in the results section ) the efficiency of the energy transfer on the test star orbiting the gc tends to vanish at eccentricities less than @xmath66 .",
    ".the values of @xmath64 , the eccentricity @xmath65 , the pericentre @xmath23 and apocentre @xmath24 of the gc elliptical orbits . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : hvs ]      [ fig : models ]    after discussing the fate of an indivudal test star moving circularly around a point like gc , we want here to quantify the actual number of stars belonging to a gc that can become bound to the smbh or ejected at high or even hyper velocity after the interaction with the smbh .",
    "a suitable estimation comes from the evaluation of the number of stars in nearly circular orbits in a self consistent model of gc of known distribution function ( df ) .",
    "of course , the df is not unique and depends both on the functional form of the gc gravitational potential and on the level of anisotropy .",
    "here we consider two different gravitational potentials for the gc    * a hernquist potential @xcite + @xmath67 + where @xmath68 is the total gc mass and @xmath69 its core radius ; * a plummer potential @xcite + @xmath70 + where , again , @xmath68 is the total gc mass and @xmath69 its core radius .    subsequently , we treated both the isotropic and anisotropic cases . with the usual definition of the anisotropy parameter    @xmath71    where @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 are the velocity dispersions in spherical polar coordinates , an isotropic model has @xmath75 , while @xmath76 is non - zero for anisotropic cases .",
    "using different modelisations , we computed the local fraction of stars of the gc on nearly circular orbits , @xmath77 , as function of @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the local density of bound stars of any velocity , while @xmath80 is that of stars moving on nearly circular orbit of scaled radius @xmath81 , i.e. those with velocity very close to the local circular velocity @xmath82 .    for the hernquist potential ,    @xmath83    while for the plummer potential    @xmath84    the function @xmath80 depends , besides the assumed potential , also on the degree of velocity anisotropy and can be calculated as described in appendix .",
    "the resulting @xmath80 will depend also on the  tolerance  @xmath85 , which quantifies the departure from the exact circular velocity . in our calculations we consider in @xmath80 all the stars having a local speed in the interval @xmath86 , with @xmath87",
    ".    as expected , figs . [",
    "fig : model_her]-[fig : model_plu ] show that the isotropic ( @xmath88 ) model fraction stays between the radially biased ( @xmath89 ) and the tangentially biased ( @xmath90 ) models .",
    "combining these evaluations of the local fractional abundance of stars on nearly circular orbits with the branching ratios obtained in the previous sections , we can evaluate the actual numbers of stars which escape from or remain bound to the gc or the smbh after close gc - smbh interactions .",
    "this requires some assumptions .",
    "first of all we assume that the gc is composed by a single - mass ( @xmath91 m@xmath6 ) population of stars .",
    "moreover , we assume that the core radius has a size which is half the innermost circular orbit radius chosen .",
    "the number of stars in nearly circular orbits is evaluated by mean of the integral    @xmath92    where @xmath93 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 is the assumed number of stars in the gcs , while @xmath94 and @xmath95 are given by    @xmath96    being @xmath97 . a straightforward product of @xmath98 with the fractions of bound to the gc or bh or unbound ( high velocity or hypervelocity ) stars , as derived by our scattering experiments presented in the previous sections , gives an estimate of the actual number of stars ejected thanks to the gc - bh interaction mechanism .",
    "figures 7 - 8 - 9 report the number of stars ejected from the gc after the close interaction between the gc and the bh , as function of the circular orbit radius for various values of @xmath64 , both in the isotropic ( @xmath75 ) and anisotropic ( @xmath99 ) hernquist and plummer gc models .",
    "the number of ejected stars depends , besides on the gc mass , on the gc potential model and on the degree of anisotropy , as shown by fig .",
    ".    moreover , the number of ejected stars increases with the gc mass .",
    "actually this mechanism would produce @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 high velocity stars for gc mass of @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , respectively .",
    "this almost linear dependence of the number of ejected stars on the gc mass is explained by that the gravitational energy per unit mass available to be converted into the test star kinetic energy is linearly scaling with @xmath53 , @xmath106 @xmath53 .",
    "the same token holds for an explanation of the isotropic - anisotropic models difference . in the case of tangentially biased models ( @xmath90 )",
    "there is a larger fraction of ejected stars because of the larger fraction of stars in nearly circular orbits . on the other hand ,",
    "the fraction of ejected stars is smaller for radially biased models ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "the phenomenon of the existence of high velocity stars , or even hypervelocity stars , in our galaxy has been explained in the literature @xcite in terms of the presence of a massive black hole in the galactic centre ( @xmath107 m@xmath1 in our milky way ) .",
    "the mechanism of star acceleration to high speed requires , indeed , an efficient energy exchange in a multiple system , i.e. a three or more bodies interaction with the massive black hole @xcite or , if it exists , with a black hole binary @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we deepened what has been recently found by arca sedda et al .",
    "( in preparation ) and preliminarily presented in @xcite , i.e. that the close passage of a massive globular cluster near a massive black hole can be source of ejection of stars from the cluster , which are accelerated to high speeds . in our study , we assumed @xmath14 m@xmath1 with the scope of identify at better the actual physical mechanism .",
    "the underlying mechanism is likely a 3-body interaction , where the  bodies   are the super massive black hole ( @xmath0 m@xmath1 ) , the globular cluster ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 m@xmath1 ) and the test star ( 1 m@xmath1 ) belonging to the globular cluster .",
    "we have performed a series of high precision integration of the orbits of such 3 bodies to check the probability for the test star orbiting a globular cluster , which experiences a close ( pericenter distance less than 10 pc ) encounter , to remain bound to the cluster , to be captured by the black hole or gain high velocity such to overcome the cluster escape velocity and , possibly , the galaxy escape velocity .",
    "we determined the branching ratios of these 3 phenomena and found that :    * the efficiency of the star acceleration process is almost linear in @xmath53 ; * a massive globular cluster ( composed by @xmath49 identical 1 m@xmath1 stars ) releases , in a single close passage around the super massive black hole , about @xmath47 stars ; * in a very close gc - bh encounter ( @xmath108 m@xmath1 , @xmath109 ) the probability of stars to remain bound , become bound to the bh or escape from the cluster are @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , respectively ; * the fractions of stars , respect to the total ejected stars , which escape from the whole galaxy is @xmath113 for an @xmath114 m@xmath6 elliptical and @xmath115 for an @xmath116 m@xmath6 spiral galaxy .",
    "moreover , we studied the effects of the inclination of the star initial orbit around the gc respect to the gc orbit . when the orbits are perpendicular , the branching ratios of the ejected stars and of the stars captured by the bh decrease , while the branching ratio of stars which remain bound to the gc increases .",
    "therefore , the overall effect of the increasing inclination of the star orbit respect to the gc orbit consists mainly in a slight reduction of the fraction of stars ejected from the gc and/or captured by the bh .",
    "correspondingly , the velocity profile of the ejected stars is peaked at lower velcoity values .",
    "furthermore , we performed the same set of 3-body scattering experiments for the @xmath108 gc assuming it is a plummer sphere with a core radius of @xmath117 pc . in this smoothed case , the velocity distribution shrinks towards lower values of the velocity since the amount of gravitational energy , to convert into kinetic one , decreases .",
    "as a consequence , we found no ejection of hypervelocity stars , suggesting that , when the gc is described by a smoothed potential , it is likely to eject only high velocity stars , which escape the gc - bh system , but still remain bound to the host galaxy .",
    "different high velocity and hypervelocity ejection mechanisms predict different spatial distributions , velocity distributions and physical and kinematic characteristics of the ejected stars @xcite .",
    "one important feature of this mechanism is the collimation of the ejected stars .",
    "we found that the high velocity stars are ejected in sort of jets , whose angular amplitude depends on the gc mass .",
    "high velocity stars produced by the interaction of a low - mass gc with a massive bh are likely to be concentrated in a small amplitude jet . on the other hand ,",
    "higher gc masses make the ejection jets have a huge amplitude and stars are ejected in a nearly isotropic emission .",
    "these results are compatible with @xcite finding .",
    "note that our results refer to a single gc - bh interaction ; anyway , we expect a production of a high velocity star jet every time a gc undergoes a close encounter with a massive bh .",
    "consequently , small clusters of high velocity stars are expected to be present in the sky , whose characteristics depend strongly on the mass of the gc from which they come from . at this regard , it is interesting to note that about half of the discovered hvs are clumped around the leo constellation @xcite .",
    "the kinematics and dynamics of the jets , their position in the sky and their velocity profile may give information about the gc - bh interaction that produced them , in particular about the gc mass and its orbits before being disrupted by the massive black hole .",
    "moreover , some stars of the jet , the ones on the right tail of the velocity distribution , may have such high velocities to be hvs , and so to be lost by the jet itself since they are unbound respect to the hosting galaxy gravitational field .",
    "being composed by stars formerly belonging to a gc , we expect that the jets contains stars of about same age and metallicity , with a common flight time .",
    "hence , in principle , by measuring the dynamical and physical properties of such high velocity jets , it would be possible to infer information about the globular cluster progenitor before its tidal erosion by the massive bh .    finally , a counterpart of such jets is the production of a population of stars orbiting the inner galactic regions and which share age and metallicity with the jet stars .",
    "as mentioned above , we assumed @xmath14 m@xmath1 with the scope of identify at better the underlying physical mechanism . for what concerns the milky way",
    ", we expect that the velocity distribution would be peaked at lower velocities due to the less energetic mechanism ( being the sgra * mass a factor 25 lower ) , with the production of high velocity rather than hypervelocity stars",
    ". however , we suggest that , in the very last , eccentric and narrow gc orbits , some hvs may be produced through the mechanism studied in this work . finally , we suggest that the recent observed runaway rr lyrae variable star , macho 176.18833.411 , @xcite may have been produced through the mechanism studied in this work .",

    "we also thank e.m .",
