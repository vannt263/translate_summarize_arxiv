    "entanglement is a key property that makes quantum information theory different from its classical counterpart @xcite .",
    "maximally entangled states , for example , are the basis of quantum state teleportation which has recently been demonstrated @xcite . under realistic conditions ,",
    "however , one will only be able to generate partially entangled mixed states .",
    "it is then of interest to be able quantify the amount of entanglement in such states .",
    "some measures of entanglement for mixed states have been suggested recently @xcite .",
    "they are useful , for example , as upper bounds to entanglement purification protocols @xcite and to the quantum channel capacity of certain quantum communication channels @xcite .",
    "unfortunately entanglement measures for mixed states ( which are relevant in the presence of noise ) are usually quite hard to calculate analytically , although an analytic expression for the entanglement of formation of two spin-@xmath0 particles is now known @xcite .",
    "the general case remains unsolved .",
    "for some problems , however , it is not so important to know the exact amount of entanglement ( a quantity that is not unique anyway )",
    ". it would be completely sufficient if one knew which state of a family of states has the most entanglement . to answer this question",
    "it would be sufficient to find a ( hopefully as simple as possible ) quantity that preserves the ordering of density operators with respect to entanglement , i.e. that for two measures @xmath1 and @xmath2 and any two density operators @xmath3 and @xmath4 we have that @xmath5 is equivalent to @xmath6 .",
    "in this paper we will compare the entanglement of formation for two spin-@xmath0 particles , for which a closed analytical form is known , with a quantity which was proposed in @xcite as a way to quantify the degree of entanglement of a mixed state .",
    "the basis of this ` measure of entanglement ' is the peres - horodecki criterion for the separability of bipartite systems @xcite . given a state of , for example , two",
    "spin-@xmath0 systems one calculates the partial transpose of the density operator .",
    "the state is separable exactly if the partial transpose is again a positive operator .",
    "if , however , one of the eigenvalues of the partial transpose is negative then the state is entangled .",
    "one can now imagine that the amount of entanglement is quantified by the modulus of this negative eigenvalue , i.e. the larger it is , the larger the entanglement of the state .",
    "it is important to check whether this measure indeed preserves the ordering of density operators as it has been used for this purpose in some publications .    in section",
    "ii we will explain the entanglement of formation and subsequently we summarize some properties of the negative eigenvalue measure of entanglement . finally , we present in section iii both a numerical and an analytical comparison of the two measures of entanglement with respect to the ordering of density operators induced by them . in section",
    "iv we sum up the results of this paper .",
    "in this section we briefly describe some entanglement measures in particular the entanglement of formation and the negative eigenvalue measure of entanglement .",
    "there are not very many good measures of entanglement .",
    "one example is the relative entropy of entanglement @xcite .",
    "in fact , it gives rise to the most restrictive upper bound on the channel capacity of the depolarizing channel @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , even for two spin-@xmath0 particles no general analytical expression has been found for it so far although many special cases can be solved analytically .",
    "a second measure of entanglement and actually the first measure of entanglement that has been proposed for mixed states is the entanglement of formation @xcite .",
    "it basically describes the amount of entanglement that needs to be shared previously in order to be able to create a particular ensemble in a given state @xmath7 by local operations .",
    "mathematically , this means that we find that pure state ensemble that realizes the state @xmath7 and which has the smallest amount of entanglement , i.e. , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a set of not necessarily orthogonal pure states .",
    "the entanglement of formation is known to be larger than the relative entropy of entanglement which proves that in general quantum state purification methods can not recover all the entanglement that has been invested in the creation of the quantum state @xcite .",
    "a nice feature of the entanglement of formation is the fact that it can be solved analytically for a system of two spin-@xmath0 particles @xcite .",
    "this allows for fast numerical studies as the cumbersome minimization eq .",
    "( [ formation ] ) can be avoided .",
    "the entanglement of formation can be expressed in terms of the function @xmath10 where @xmath11 for a density operator",
    "@xmath7 one defines the spin flipped state @xmath12 where the @xmath13 denotes the complex conjugate in the standard computational basis @xmath14 .",
    "one then finds the entanglement of formation to be @xmath15 where the so called concurrence is defined by @xmath16 here , @xmath17 are the eigenvalues , in decreasing order , of the hermitean matrix @xmath18 . for properties of this measure of entanglement the reader should consult the literature @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that since @xmath19 as a function of the concurrence @xmath20 is a strictly monotonous function and maps the interval @xmath21 $ ] on @xmath21 $ ] @xmath20 can in fact also be regarded as a measure for entanglement .    we will now consider the negative eigenvalue of the partial transpose of a density operator as a measure of entanglement . in the next section",
    "we will then compare it to the entanglement of formation .",
    "for two spin-@xmath0 particles ( which form the two systems @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) any disentangled state @xmath7 can be written as the convex sum of product states @xmath24 states which permit a representation of the form eq .",
    "( [ separa ] ) are also called separable . for two spin-@xmath0 particles",
    "there is a simple criterion to decide whether a given state is separable or not @xcite .",
    "one calculates the partial transpose @xmath25 of the density operator @xmath7 in the computational basis .",
    "this means that we transpose only one subsystem , either subsystem @xmath22 or @xmath23 .",
    "if the resulting matrix is positive semidefinite then the density operator @xmath7 is separable ; otherwise it is not .",
    "therefore the partial transpose of an entangled state has a negative eigenvalue and the idea of the negative eigenvalue measure is to use the modulus of the negative eigenvalue to quantify the entanglement of the state @xmath7 . in a mathematical form",
    "this reads as @xmath26 where the @xmath27 are the eigenvalues of the partial transpose @xmath25 .",
    "however , we do not know whether this way of quantifying the entanglement constitutes a proper measure of entanglement",
    ". therefore we will investigate in the next section numerically whether the entanglement of formation and the negative eigenvalue measure are compatible from a different point of view .",
    "we would expect that any two ` good ' entanglement measures should generate the same ordering of the density operators .",
    "this means that for two entanglement measures @xmath1 and @xmath2 and any two density operators @xmath3 and @xmath4 we have that @xmath28 why do we expect this relation to be true ? if in one measure of entanglement @xmath3 contains more entanglement than @xmath4 then we would expect that a quantum state purification method would generate more singlets from an ensemble in state @xmath3 than ensemble @xmath4 . if @xmath2 is also a measure of entanglement then we would expect that @xmath4 would yield more singlets than @xmath3 .",
    "while this reasoning is not strict , it nevertheless indicates that eq .",
    "( [ consist ] ) should be true for two ` good ' measures of entanglement .    in the next two subsections we will now check whether eq .",
    "( [ consist ] ) is satisfied for the entanglement of formation @xmath29 and the negative eigenvalue measure of entanglement @xmath30 .      for some classes of density operators we can easily check analytically whether the relation eq .",
    "( [ consist ] ) is true . for pure states",
    "it is sufficient to consider states of the form @xmath31 as it follows from the schmidt decomposition @xcite .",
    "the entanglement of formation @xmath29 then reduces to the von neumann entropy of entanglement while the negative eigenvalue measure yields @xmath32 both measures decrease monotonically with @xmath33 so that for pure states eq .",
    "( [ consist ] ) is satisfied .",
    "it should be mentioned that for pure states @xmath34 with @xmath31 the concurrence @xmath20 is given by @xmath35 hence , also for arbitrary pure states @xmath36 the negative eigenvalue measure and the concurrence are connected by the simple equation @xmath37 werner states are defined as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the singlet state and @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "the concurrence of werner states is given by @xmath41 for @xmath42 ( otherwise @xmath43 is a separable state ) while the entanglement of formation is found to be @xmath44 with @xmath45 .",
    "the negative eigenvalue measure simply gives @xmath46 which means that eq .",
    "( [ connection ] ) is also valid for werner states .",
    "again , both measures decrease monotonically with @xmath47 and therefore eq . ( [ consist ] ) is satisfied .    moreover , no counterexample to eq .",
    "( [ consist ] ) can be constructed from pure states and werner states , i.e. no two density operators @xmath3 and @xmath4 can be found which violate eq . ( [ consist ] ) when @xmath3 is assumed to be a pure state and @xmath4 corresponds to a werner state . because of the monotony of @xmath19 in eq .",
    "( [ ent1 ] ) this can already be seen when comparing the concurrences of @xmath3 and @xmath4 with the negative eigenvalue measure of the respective states : from eq .",
    "( [ connection ] ) it then immediately follows that @xmath48 can not be fulfilled for any value of @xmath47 .",
    "one may therefore suspect that eq .",
    "( [ consist ] ) also holds for arbitrary mixed states . to tackle the question whether eq .",
    "( [ consist ] ) is generally satisfied and hence the two entanglement measures induce the same ordering we have employed monte carlo simulations . if eq .",
    "( [ consist ] ) is violated at all , it is - roughly speaking - also of interest to investigate how ` badly ' it is violated after all . in the following subsection we present the results of the numerical test that we have performed .      in order to test the ordering induced by the two entanglement measures under consideration we have numerically generated a million pairs of random density matrices with respect to a certain well defined distribution . in the case of two spin-@xmath0 particles , which is the case of interest in this paper",
    ", one has to generate random density operators - i.e. linear , self adjoint , positive semidefinite operators @xmath7 of finite trace @xmath49 - acting on the four dimensional hilbert space isomorphic to @xmath50",
    ". one can represent @xmath7 by the decomposition @xmath51 with pairwise orthogonal projections , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "this in turn corresponds to a @xmath54 matrix of the form @xmath55 where the diagonal matrix @xmath56 is defined by @xmath57 .    a plausible choice for the ensemble of unitary @xmath54 matrices which can be used to construct density matrices according to eq .",
    "( [ construction ] ) is the one with the normalized haar measure on the group of unitary matrices @xmath58 which is called the circular unitary ensemble @xcite .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that random unitary matrices representative for the circular unitary ensemble can be obtained as follows : let us set @xmath59 where the complex @xmath54 matrices @xmath60 , @xmath61 with three real parameters @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 are given by @xmath65 we now take @xmath66 and @xmath67 to be independent random variables with a uniform distribution in the interval @xmath68 , and for a given random number @xmath69 distributed uniformly in the interval @xmath70 we choose @xmath71 to be @xmath72 for @xmath73 .",
    "matrices generated in this way are then random unitary matrices of the wanted type ( except for a random phase which is of no significance for our purposes ) .",
    "finally , a set of random density matrices can be obtained by appropriately choosing the diagonal matrices @xmath56 .",
    "more precisely , the random vector with entries @xmath74 should be uniformly distributed on the manifold defined by @xmath53 . according to @xcite this",
    "can be achieved , e.g. , by setting @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 , where again , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 are random numbers drawn with respect to a uniform distribution in the interval @xmath70 .    to investigate whether eq .",
    "( [ consist ] ) is satisfied we now draw random density matrices from the previously described ensemble and calculate the eigenvalues of the partial transposes and the eigenvalues of the products of the respective density operators with the spin flipped states . after discarding those density matrices which correspond to separable states",
    "we then determine values for @xmath30 and @xmath29 as described in section ii .",
    "finally , we check for pairs @xmath82 whether the sign of @xmath83 and @xmath84 is identical . fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows a diagram in which @xmath85 is plotted versus @xmath86 for @xmath87 pairs @xmath88 of random density matrices .",
    "although there is obviously a certain correlation between @xmath89 and @xmath90 , there are dots in the second and the fourth quadrant of the diagram which are associated with pairs of states which do not satisfy eq .",
    "( [ consist ] ) .",
    "one can therefore conclude that in the case of two spin-@xmath0 systems this relation is not satisfied for arbitrary mixed states , and hence , the ordering induced by the entanglement of formation @xmath29 and the one induced by the negative eigenvalue measure @xmath30 is not the same .",
    "@xmath85    @xmath86    it is interesting to note that most of the randomly drawn density operators do not correspond to entangled but to separable states ; so more density matrices have to be discarded than can be kept for the investigation .",
    "in fact , from the numerical simulations we can estimate the probability @xmath91 that a created mixed state is entangled as @xmath92 , which is in complete agreement with the analytical and numerical findings presented in @xcite .    from the monte carlo simulation",
    "we can also give a rather accurate estimate of how likely it is to find a pair of states which violates eq .",
    "( [ consist ] ) , given that both states are entangled . from the relative frequency of a violation for a million pairs of density matrices we obtain for the estimate of this probability @xmath93 @xmath94    @xmath30    @xmath29    now that we know that the ordering is different it is interesting to see to what extent the values of @xmath95 and @xmath96 differ for a given state @xmath7 , or how these random states are distributed in a diagram where @xmath29 is plotted versus @xmath30 .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows such a plot . since the ordering induced by @xmath29 and @xmath30",
    "is not the same , there is no strictly monotonous function @xmath97\\rightarrow[0,1/2]$ ] such that @xmath98 for all states @xmath7 .",
    "this is also obvious from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] again the distribution of states is shown , but this time the negative eigenvalue measure is plotted versus the concurrence @xmath20 .",
    "we can see that most of the dots are located close to the diagonal connecting @xmath99 and @xmath100 ; this diagonal corresponds to states satisfying eq . ( [ connection ] ) .",
    "note that the numerical simulation also strongly suggests that for a state @xmath7 with a certain value of @xmath101 the upper bound for the possible values of the negative eigenvalue measure @xmath95 is given by @xmath102 , that is , that in general @xmath103 holds for any state @xmath7 .",
    "furthermore , since for pure states the ordering induced by the two entanglement measures is the same but in general it is not , it is of interest to investigate the dependence of the probability that eq .",
    "( [ consist ] ) is violated for a pair of entangled states @xmath82 on the ` purity of those states ' with respect to a certain characterization of the purity . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we show the relative number of pairs @xmath82 of states which do not satisfy eq .",
    "( [ consist ] ) versus @xmath104 based on a million pairs of entangled states . here ,",
    "@xmath105 and @xmath106 are the linear entropies @xmath107 of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively , as commonly employed , e.g. , in decoherence studies @xcite .",
    "obviously , pure states correspond to a vanishing linear entropy .",
    "@xmath30    @xmath20    we observe that the fraction of pairs @xmath82 of states with @xmath108 increases monotonically with the sum of the linear entropies of the respective states .",
    "this indicates that the more mixed the two states are with respect to the arithmetic mean of their linear entropies , the larger is the probability that this pair violates eq .",
    "( [ consist ] ) . above a certain cut off no pairs of entangles states can be found at all - the numerical data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] give an estimate for the probability density of finding a pair of entangled states with a certain value of @xmath109 ( compare also @xcite ) .",
    "it should finally be mentioned that in @xcite yet another measure of entanglement incorporating the partial transpose is proposed : for a given state @xmath7 the quantity @xmath110 is taken as a measure , where again , the @xmath27 denote the eigenvalues of the partial transpose @xmath25 of @xmath7 .",
    "while the actual value of @xmath111 for a given state is of course different from that of @xmath30 , from numerical simulations we come to the same conclusion that the ordering induced by this measure is different from the one induced by the entanglement of formation @xmath29 .",
    "we have compared the entanglement of formation with a potential measure of entanglement that is given by the negative eigenvalue of the partial transpose of the density operator of the system .",
    "in particular the ordering of density operators with respect to the amount of entanglement induced by the two measures has been compared both numerically and analytically .",
    "we have shown that the negative eigenvalue measure does not induce the same ordering as the entanglement of formation .",
    "therefore we do not expect it to be a ` good ' measure of entanglement .",
    "in particular it can not , in general , be used to determine the most entangled state for a given family of density operators as it has been used previously .",
