    "type ia supernovae are thought to be generated by thermonuclear explosions of carbon - oxygen white dwarfs undergoing accretion in stellar binary systems ( hoyle & fowler 1960 ) .",
    "however , the nature of the progenitor binary systems ( one white dwarf or two ? ) , the masses of the white dwarfs ( chandrasekhar or sub - chandrasekhar mass ? ) and the explosion mechanism(s ) ( e.g. convective deflagration , delayed - detonation , etc . ) for sn ia are still open questions ( for recent reviews see branch 1998 ; branch et al .",

    "the explosion of a chandrasekhar mass c - o white dwarf is thought to be initiated by carbon ignition at the center , followed by a subsonic nuclear flame ( deflagration wave ) propagating outwards .",
    "prompt detonation models ( arnett 1969 ; hansen & wheeler 1969 ) , characterized by supersonic nuclear flames , are not viable since they do not produce the intermediate mass elements which are observed in sn ia spectra ( nomoto , thielemann , & yokoi 1984 ; wheeler & harkness 1990 ) . among deflagration ( subsonic nuclear flame ) models ,",
    "the elemental nucleosynthesis depends on the characteristics of the flame propagation , on shock waves generated by instabilities at the flame front and on the density at the transition from deflagration to detonation ( nomoto et al .  1997b ; niemeyer & hillebrandt 1995 ; niemeyer & woosley 1997 ) .",
    "in the classical `` w7 '' deflagration model ( nomoto et al .  1984 ; branch et al .",
    "1995 ; harkness 1991 ; thielemann , nomoto & yokoi 1986 ) , the propagation speed of the flame front is relatively high ( @xmath1 of the sound speed ) , but remains subsonic . in `` delayed detonation '' models , the flame speed is initially much lower , ( @xmath2 of the sound speed ) , but rises to become supersonic ( livne 1993 ; arnett & livne 1994a , 1994b ; khokhlov 1995 ; niemeyer & hillebrandt 1995 ) . in `` pulsating detonation '' models , the deflagration fails to unbind the white dwarf , causing a pulsation , and detonation occurs upon contraction ( arnett & livne 1994a , 1994b ) .    despite the remaining theoretical uncertainties in the more popular models for sn ia",
    ", there is better agreement in their predicted nucleosynthetic yields than in the yields from various models for sn ii ( gibson , loewenstein & mushotzky 1997 ) .",
    "nonetheless , significant discrepancies still exist between the yield predictions of competing sn ia explosion models .",
    "for example , the nickel yield from the w7 model cited above is @xmath3 times greater than those from delayed detonation models . accurately determining the elemental yields from sn ia",
    "is crucial to determining the relative contribution of different supernovae types to the metal enrichment of galaxies and intracluster gas .",
    "furthermore , assessing the relative contribution of sn ia and ii ejecta in intracluster gas provides crucial information for determining which enrichment mechanism(s ) were most dominant in contaminating intracluster gas . in this paper",
    "we use x - ray spectroscopic observations of intracluster gas to discriminate between competing theoretical models for sn ia .",
    "intracluster gas tends to be metal - rich , with abundances of @xmath4 solar . since",
    "heavy elements are produced in supernovae , the metals in intracluster gas must have come from stars .",
    "however , the metal enrichment mechanism(s ) for intracluster gas remains controversial .",
    "the most likely enrichment mechanisms are thought to be protogalactic winds ( larson & dinerstein 1975 ) and ram pressure stripping ( gunn & gott 1972 ) .",
    "the processes may be distinguished by their chemistry .",
    "protogalactic winds would be associated with sn ii ejecta , while the more secular process of ram pressure stripping would be associated with significant supplemental amounts of sn ia ejecta which accumulated in the interstellar medium of galaxies .",
    "early x - ray spectroscopy of intracluster gas indicated a dominance of sn ii ejecta ( canizares et al .",
    "1982 ; canizares , markert & donahue 1988 ) and more recent _ asca _ spectroscopy has been interpreted similarly ( mushotzky & loewenstein 1997 ; mushotzky et al .",
    "such a dominance of sn ii ejecta supports the protogalactic wind scenario for the metal enrichment of intracluster gas .",
    "further support comes from the observation that the specific energy of intracluster gas is greater than that of cluster galaxies ( white 1991 ) .",
    "however , theoretical uncertainties in the elemental yields from sn ia and sn ii allow _ asca _ spectroscopy to also be interpreted as showing that as much as 50% of the iron in clusters comes from sn ia ( ishimaru & arimoto 1997 ; fukazawa et al .",
    "1998 ; nagataki & sato 1998 ; dupke 1998 ; dupke & white 1999 ) . in a detailed study of abell 496 , dupke & white ( 1999 ) used an ensemble of elemental abundance ratios to show that the fractional contribution of sn ia ejecta is @xmath5 ( by mass ) in the bulk of the cluster , increasing to @xmath6 in the vicinity of its central cd galaxy .",
    "they argued that ram pressure stripping could not have caused the central abundance enhancement in abell 496 and instead proposed that a secondary sn ia - driven wind ( following a more vigorous sn ii - driven protogalactic wind ) , was partially suppressed in the vicinity of the cd ( due to the cd being at the bottom of the cluster s gravitational potential and in the midst of the highest ambient intracluster gas density ) .",
    "if this suggestion is correct , high fractions of sn ia ejecta should also be found in other clusters with central abundance enhancements .    in this paper",
    "we show that abell 496 , abell 2199 , and abell 3571 have central iron abundance enhancements .",
    "we use an ensemble of abundance ratios to determine the relative proportion of sn ia and sn ii ejecta in their central regions and find that the mass fraction of sn ia ejecta ranges from @xmath7 .",
    "we then further analyze these central regions , where the metal contamination is dominated by sn ia ejecta , to discriminate between competing theoretical models for sn ia .",
    "in particular , we show that the ni / fe ratios observed at the centers of these clusters are consistent with the `` standard '' w7 model , but are inconsistent with those of various delayed - detonation models .",

    "abundances are measured relative to the solar photospheric values of anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) , in which fe / h=@xmath35 by number .",
    "galactic photoelectric absorption was incorporated using the wabs model ( morrison & mccammon 1983 ) .",
    "spectral channels were grouped to have at least 25 counts / channel .",
    "energy ranges were restricted to 0.810 kev for the gis and 0.410 kev for the sis .",
    "spectra from all four _ asca _ instruments ( sis 0 & 1 and gis 2 & 3 ) were fit individually and jointly .",
    "since the individual spectral fits are consistent with the joint analyses of all four instruments , we will only describe the joint fits .",
    "spectra were extracted from regions as small as @xmath36 radius at several different projected spatial distances from the clusters center . thermal emission models ( mekal ) with variable temperatures , overall abundances , normalizations and absorbing column densities ( wabs ) were then jointly fit to all four spectra from each region .",
    "the normalizations for the individual spectra were allowed to vary independently , to compensate for small calibration and spatial extraction differences between the four detectors .",
    "since each cluster has a moderate cooling flow at its center , we also added a cooling flow component to the mekal thermal emission model for the central region of each cluster , in order to test the model - dependence of our abundance measurements .",
    "the cooling flow spectral model cflow in xspec is characterized by maximum and minimum temperatures , an abundance , a slope which parameterizes the temperature distribution of emission measures , and a normalization which is simply the cooling accretion rate .",
    "we adopted the emission measure temperature distribution that corresponds to isobaric cooling flows ( zero slope ) .",
    "we tied the maximum temperature of the cooling flow to the temperature of the thermal component , and we fixed the minimum temperature at 0.1 kev .",
    "we applied a single ( but variable ) global absorption to both spectral components and associated an additional , intrinsic absorption component with the cooling flow , placing it at the redshift of the cluster .",
    "the resulting fits were all excellent , having reduced @xmath37 of @xmath38 .",
    "we first used isothermal mekal models to determine the overall elemental abundance ( largely driven by iron ) in each cluster region .",

    ", the central abundance is @xmath45 solar , declining to @xmath46 solar in the outer regions .",
    "we also used the @xmath47-test to assess the significance of the abundance gradient in each cluster by comparing the @xmath37 of fits which assumed the abundances were the same in the two projected spatial regions ( inner versus outer ) to fits which allowed the abundances in the two regions to vary independently .",
    "the difference between the @xmath37 of these two fits must follow a @xmath37 distribution with one degree of freedom ( bevington 1969 ) .",
    "we find that the central abundance enhancements are significant with @xmath48% confidence .",
    "as can be seen from table 2 , the addition of a cooling flow component in the central regions does not significantly change the abundance estimates .    both abell 496 and abell 2199 have clear temperature gradients when",
    "isothermal mekal models are used : the temperature in abell 496 rises from @xmath49 kev within @xmath36 to @xmath50 kev beyond @xmath51 ; in abell 2199 the temperature rises from a central value of @xmath52 kev to @xmath53 kev beyond @xmath51 .",

    "we also determined individual elemental abundances in the central region of each cluster by using the vmekal spectral model in xspec . in our spectral model",
    "fits , the helium abundance was fixed at the solar value , while carbon and nitrogen were fixed at 0.3 solar ( since _ asca _ is rather insensitive to carbon and nitrogen and the derived abundances of other elements are not affected by the particular choice for carbon and nitrogen abundances ) .",
    "our observed abundances are shown in table 3 .",
    "it can be seen from table 3 that the best determined abundances in all three clusters are those of iron , silicon and nickel .",
    "argon , calcium and magnesium abundances are poorly measured and are not listed .",
    "oxygen , neon and sulfur abundances are not well constrained in abell 3571 .",
    "nickel abundances are about twice solar in all three clusters .    to estimate the sn ia / ii mass fraction",
    ", we will compare various observed abundance ratios to the theoretical predictions of specific models for sn ia and ii .",
    "for sn ia we initially adopt the updated w7 model of nomoto et al .",
    "( 1997b ) , while for sn ii we use the calculations of nomoto et al .",
    "( 1997a , 1997b ) , who adopt a salpeter initial mass function over a sn ii progenitor mass range of 10 - 50 @xmath15 .",
    "the abundance ratios we use involve oxygen , silicon , iron and nickel .",
    "various observed ratios are listed in table 4 and compared to the theoretical ratios from the models we adopt .",
    "we do not include sulfur and neon in these estimates because their theoretical yields from sn ii are particularly problematic . in their analysis of _ asca _ spectra of four clusters , mushotzky et al .",
    "( 1996 ) observed a persistent underabundance of sulfur and an overabundance of neon compared to expectations from theoretical models of supernova yields .",
    "dupke & white ( 1999 ) and dupke & arnaud ( 1999 ) , using different theoretical models for sn ii yields , found that the theoretical sulfur yield would have to be reduced by a factor of @xmath142 - 4 to be consistent with results for most other elemental ratios in their _ asca _ analyses of abell 496 and perseus , respectively .",
    "dupke & arnaud ( 1999 ) also found that theoretical neon yields would have to be reduced by a factor of @xmath57 to be consistent with the results for most other elemental ratios .",
    "therefore , to estimate the sn ia iron mass fraction , we use only abundance ratios involving the better constrained ( observationally and theoretically ) abundances of iron , silicon , nickel and oxygen .    various abundance ratios in the central regions of abell 496 ,",
    "abell 2199 , and abell 3571 are shown in table 4 , along with the theoretical expectations for sn ia and sn ii ejecta ; the errors associated with the observed abundance ratios are the propagated 1@xmath58 errors . in table 5 we list the best - constrained abundance ratios for each cluster along with the associated estimates for the sn ia iron mass fractions ; the individual sn ia iron mass fraction estimates are consistent with one another , within their errors .",
    "the ensemble average of these individual estimates of the sn ia iron mass fraction ( weighted by their errors ) is also indicated at the bottom of table 5 for each cluster .",
    "( in abell 3571 , the oxygen abundance is not well constrained , so we have not included it in the calculation of the ensemble average . ) evidently , the central regions of all three clusters are substantially enriched by sn ia ejecta , with sn ia iron mass fractions of 73@xmath59 , 74@xmath60 and 58@xmath61 in abell 496 , abell 2199 and abell 3571 , respectively .",
    "in the previous section we showed that abell 496 , abell 2199 and abell 3571 have significant central abundance enhancements which are comprised mostly of sn ia ejecta .",
    "a variety of abundance ratios provide mutually consistent estimates of the central sn ia iron mass fraction , given our adopted models for theoretical yields from sn ia and ii .",
    "this mutual consistency encourages us to test alternative theoretical models for sn ia ( alternative sn ii models will be explored in white 1999 ) .",
    "in particular , we will compare the w7 `` deflagration '' model adopted above to `` delayed detonation '' models which have been explored in response to concerns about the physicality of the explosion in the w7 model ( khokhlov 1991 ) .",
    "delayed detonation models are characterized by ( initially ) slower flame speeds ( a few percent of the sound speed ) than the w7 model .",
    "we consider the delayed detonation models of nomoto et al .",
    "( 1997b ) , who calculate yields for a sequence of models distinguished by a variety of densities ahead of the deflagration front , which modulates the onset of detonation .",
    "we find that the elemental yields of their models wdd1 , wdd2 and wdd3 do @xmath62 provide the same consistency as found with model w7 in estimating the sn ia / ii fraction .",
    "table 6 compares the estimates of sn ia iron mass fractions derived from the three delayed detonation models described above . the adopted sn ii yields are again those of nomoto et al .",
    "( 1997a , 1997b ) .",
    "comparison of tables 5 and 6 shows that the w7 model provides more satisfactory results in three different ways : 1 ) more abundance ratios fall within the theoretical bounds of sn ia and sn ii , as they should , when w7 is adopted ( observed ratios which are outside the theoretical bounds for sn ia and ii ejecta , therefore preventing mass fraction estimates , are indicated by dashes ) ; 2 ) the dispersion in the average of the ( remaining ) individual sn ia iron mass fraction estimates tends to be smaller when the w7 model is adopted ; 3 ) the mutual consistency of the sn ia iron mass fraction estimates derived from individual abundance ratios for a given cluster is best when the w7 model is adopted .    concentrating on the nickel yield in particular , we find that our cluster observations further discriminate against the delayed detonation models cited above .",
    "the observationally best determined abundance ratio involving nickel is the nickel to iron ratio .",
    "recall from table 4 that the individual ni / fe ratios are consistent with the other indicated ratios in estimating the fractional sn ia contamination .",
    "figure 2 compares the ni / fe ratio observed in the three clusters analyzed in this work to the predicted ni / fe ratio from the w7 deflagration model , as well as from the three delayed detonation models described above ; the indicated observational errors are the propagated 90% confidence limits .",
    "evidently , the observed ni / fe ratios are @xmath63 with any of these delayed detonation models at better than 90% confidence .",
    "the observed ni / fe ratio is fully consistent with the w7 model , however .",
    "thus , the elemental yields of the w7 model are more consistent with x - ray spectroscopic observations of intracluster gas than those of delayed detonation models .",
