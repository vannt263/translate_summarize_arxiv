    "since the first evidence in 1994@xcite and the discovery of the top quark in 1995@xcite@xcite , the cdf and d   collaborations invested a lot of work to determine its properties , specially the value of its mass , which is a fundamental parameter of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the ongoing run  ii , with the upgraded fermilab tevatron collider and cdf and d   detectors , gives new possibilities for a precise measurement of the top mass .",
    "due to its large mass , corresponding to a yukawa coupling of order unity , one may suspect that the top quark may have a special role in the electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "in addition , due to its significant contribution to high order radiative corrections of a number of electroweak observables , a precise measurement of the top quark mass provides a tighter constrain on the higgs mass@xcite .",
    "this paper reports on the latest cdf and d   top quark mass results which are based on about 318  @xmath10 ( cdf ) and 219  @xmath10 ( d  ) of data from the first two years of the tevatron run  ii ( 2002 to 2004 ) .",
    "another paper , presented on this conference@xcite , summarized the top quark kinematics properties including its recently measured production cross section at the center of mass energy of @xmath11=1.96 tev ,    at this tevatron energy , top quarks are produced generally in pairs from the processes @xmath12 ( in @xmath1385% of the cases ) and @xmath14 ( in @xmath1315% of the cases ) .",
    "top can be produced as a single quark by electroweak interactions , by w - gluon fusion or virtual w@xmath15 production in the s - channel@xcite , but with a smaller cross section .",
    "at this time , no signal has been observed from single top processes and they are not expected to be utilized for a precise mass measurement .    in the standard model the branching ratio of the decay @xmath16 is nearly 100% .",
    "when a @xmath17 pair is produced , each of the w - bosons can decay into either a charged lepton and a neutrino ( branching ratio of 1/9 for each lepton family ) or into a @xmath18 quark pair ( branching ratio of 2/3 ) .",
    "this allows us to classify the final states as :    * dilepton final state , when both w s from the @xmath17 pair decay leptonically .",
    "this state is characterized by two high p@xmath19 charged leptons , two jets from @xmath20 quarks and significant missing transverse energy ( @xmath1 ) from the neutrinos .",
    "* lepton plus jets final state , when one w boson decays leptonically and the other one hadronically .",
    "this state contains one high p@xmath19 charged lepton , four jets and significant @xmath1 . *",
    "all hadronic final state , when both w s decay hadronically .",
    "this state is characterized by 8 jets , two of which are from @xmath21-quarks .    in run",
    "i , cdf and d   used all of these signatures for the top mass measurements . at this time , the run  ii top mass analyses from the all - hadronic channel are still in progress and will not be reported in this paper .",
    "figure  [ fig : topmasshistory ] shows how our knowledge on the top quark mass improved with time .",
    "the diamonds represent the indirect determinations from fits to the electroweak observables@xcite .",
    "the curves in the upper left corner of the figure represent the limits from direct searches in @xmath22 and @xmath23 machines .",
    "the run  i cdf and d   results are presented with squares .",
    "the filled circles are the new tevatron run  ii results . the band represents the average run  i top mass results .",
    "one observes that the recent tevatron results have equal or better accuracy than the run  i world average .",
    "the kinematics of the events in the lepton plus jets final state is over - constrained . in this channel ,",
    "the number of measured quantities and the number of applicable energy - conservation equations , from five production and decay vertices , are larger than the number of non - measured kinematical event parameters .",
    "this feature allows for a complete reconstruction of the four - momenta of the final state particles in the event , for example using the two constrain kinematical fit ( 2cf ) , and for a reconstruction of the top mass event - by - event . in this type of analysis",
    "there is an ambiguity in how to assign the four leading jets to the two b quarks and two light quarks coming from the @xmath17 system .",
    "if none of these jets is tagged by b taggers , electrons or muons from the @xmath21-quark semileptonic decays ( soft lepton tagging , slt@xcite ) ] there are 12 different ways of assigning jets to the 4 partons . combining with the ambiguity from solving of a quadratic equation on @xmath24",
    ", there are 24 different values of @xmath25 returned by the fit .",
    "the combinations are reduced to 12 or to 4 if one or two of the jets are selected from b - taggers .",
    "the variety of the cdf and d   analyses in the lepton plus jet sample is relatively large .",
    "however , all analyses can be separated in three major categories :    1 .",
    "template type analyses , where the reconstructed mass distribution from the data is compared with expected distributions from monte carlo generated signal ( mass - dependent ) and background . in these types of analyses , all events are weighted equally . by doing so",
    "one neglects the additional information coming from a different mass resolution in single events .",
    "in addition no use is made of possible information from the dynamic of the process which can be assumed to be known .",
    "typical examples for this type of analysis are the cdf and d   run  i@xcite@xcite and the latest , most accurate cdf run  ii lepton plus jets analysis , described in section  3.1 . 2 .",
    "matrix element type analyses , originally proposed by dalitz and goldstein@xcite and independently by kondo@xcite .",
    "these methods calculate the posterior probability , given the known production cross section , for every event with measured kinematic properties , to originate from a @xmath26 process .",
    "a typical example is the d   matrix element analysis which is the base of the best run  i top mass measurement@xcite . in run",
    "ii cdf uses a method , proposed by k.kondo@xcite , called dynamic likelihood analysis , which differs in the way that the normalization of the differential cross section is performed .",
    "3 .   a mixture between methods 1 ) and 2 ) . for example",
    "the @xmath17 event is reconstructed using the kinematic algorithms similar to the template analyses but an event - by - event probability of each kinematic reconstruction is exploited as a weight ( for example @xmath27 ) .",
    "a typical example of this category is the d   ideogram analysis@xcite .",
    "for the time being the most accurate top quark mass measurement comes from the lepton plus jets channel .",
    "this channel combines the benefits of good signal to background ratio , the possibility to reconstruct the top quark mass event by event with a relatively small combinatorial effect , and a large branching fraction . in brief",
    ", we discuss below the main selection criteria for this channel .",
    "lepton plus jets events have the signature @xmath28 .",
    "the characteristics of this final state begins with the identification of one isolated central high energy lepton ( @xmath29 with @xmath30 20 gev or @xmath3 with @xmath3120 gev ) and @xmath32  1 .",
    "assuming that the lepton is coming from w boson decay , a companion neutrino should exist .",
    "this would spoil the balance of the observed momentum in the transverse plane .",
    "the missing transverse energy ( @xmath1 ) is constructed by adding the calorimeter energy vectors in the plane transverse to the beam .",
    "the calorimeter clusters identified as jets are corrected for detector response and for multiple @xmath23 interactions . in muon events the @xmath1 is computed using the muon momentum measured by the track instead of the muon calorimeter signal .    in order to fully reconstruct the @xmath17 system , at least four central jets @xmath33",
    "2 are required in the system . the svx tagging algorithm",
    "is run over the leading jets ( @xmath3415 gev ) : some of them may be identified as b - jets . to obtain maximum statistical benefit from the event sample",
    "it is helpful to decompose it into several classes of events which are expected to have different signal - to - background ratios and top mass resolutions .",
    "the monte carlo studies showed that an optimal partitioning is obtained splitting the sample into four statistically independent categories : events with double svx tags ( 2svx ) , events with single svx tag and tight forth jet cut ( four jets with @xmath3415 gev , 1sxvt ) , events with single svx tag and loose forth jet cut ( 15 @xmath358 gev for the 4@xmath36 jet , 1sxvl ) and finally events without tags ( 0-tag ) .",
    "since the last sample has a high background contamination compared to svx tagged ones , an additional optimization of the jet @xmath37 cuts ( @xmath38 21  gev ) was performed .",
    "a total of 165 @xmath17 candidates were selected from 318  @xmath10 of data .",
    "the dominant backgrounds in all samples are direct w plus multijet production , including heavy flavour production , and qcd multijet events where one jet is misidentified as a lepton .",
    "additional small backgrounds are due to ww / wz and single top production .",
    "the amount and composition of the background depends on the sample . in the case of the 2svx sample ,",
    "the @xmath39 background dominates ( @xmath1360% ) while in the case of the 0-tag sample , the w plus light quark production is responsible for @xmath1375% of background .",
    "the information for these four subsamples , including the dominant type and background fraction , is summarized in table  [ t - sample ] .    0.1 in    ._in the first four columns from left to right :",
    "lepton plus jets subsamples used in the top quark mass analysis , number of events in each sample , s / b ratio , and a summary of the jet energy cut selection are presented .",
    "a total of 165 @xmath17 candidates were selected .",
    "the last column summarizes the background fractions in % from @xmath40 + light quark , @xmath39 and qcd multijet events ( left to right ) . _ [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : d0syst ]    as expected , the dominant systematic uncertainty originates from the jes .",
    "the impact of jes on the reconstructed top mass was evaluated by scaling the jet energies by @xmath41 for both signal and background in the mc simulation . the uncertainty on the jes was conservatively assumed to be 5% for the @xmath42  gev .",
    "for jets with @xmath43  gev , the jes uncertainty decreases linearly as @xmath44 )  gev .",
    "next in importance to the jes is the systematic uncertainty coming from gluon radiation .",
    "regardless of which jet permutation is used , the fitted mass will not be correct if the a radiated gluon is one in the four leading jets in the event . to understand how this affects the @xmath17 reconstruction , mc events with only four partons hadronizing and forming four jets",
    "were compared to events where one of the leading 4 jets comes from gluon radiation .",
    "a small deviation of @xmath45 0.2 gev / c@xmath6 from the nominal top mass is observed when the events without gluon radiation are reconstructed .",
    "the difference becomes @xmath46 gev / c@xmath6 when one of the leading jets is a radiated gluon . in this",
    "analyses the model of the kinematic properties of the events is taken directly from mc simulation .",
    "therefore some deficiencies in the mc model may lead to a substantial bias in the mass reconstruction . in order to perform a conservative estimate of this possible effect , in addition to the nominal sample for @xmath17 signal a complementary sample",
    "was generated where an additional parton is produced in association with the @xmath17 pair .",
    "the cross section for this process is approximately two times smaller than the cross section for the @xmath17 production . by analyzing this sample , an uncertainty of + 2.3  gev / c@xmath9 due to the uncertainty on signal modeling",
    "is assigned to the analyses .",
    "all other possible systematic effects turned out to be relatively small , at the level of 0.5@xmath130.7 gev / c@xmath6 .",
    "the distributions of the fitted masses and -ln(@xmath47 ) curves are shown in figure  5 .",
    "the top two figures show the result from the @xmath21-tagged analysis while the bottom two represent the topological one . taking into account the output from the binned likelihood fit and the systematic uncertainties the final result for the analyses is @xmath7 = 170.6 @xmath48(stat . )",
    "@xmath49(syst . )  gev / c@xmath6 ( @xmath21-tagged analysis ) and @xmath7 = 169.9@xmath50(stat.)@xmath51(syst . )",
    "gev / c@xmath6 for the topological one .",
    "cdf has several independent dilepton analyses which are found to return consistent values for the top mass . since this sample has good signal to background ratio ( @xmath52 ) one",
    "is stimulated to invent ingenious ways to reconstruct the events and extract @xmath7 .",
    "the event selection criteria are similar as in the lepton plus jets channel .",
    "two or more central jets with @xmath30 15 gev are required .",
    "a loose criterion is applied to the second lepton - it must have opposite charge but isolation is not mandatory .",
    "for the missing transverse energy the cut is increased to @xmath5325 gev since two neutrinos are supposed to be presented in the event .",
    "if @xmath5450 gev , a requirement for the angle between @xmath1 and the nearest lepton or jet to be @xmath5520@xmath56 is imposed .",
    "also the transverse energy sum , @xmath57 , has to be more than 200  gev .",
    "events due to cosmic rays , conversions or z bosons are rejected .",
    "four major backgrounds are taken into account : di - boson plus jet production , w plus jets where one of the jet is faking a lepton , and drell - yan production , specially z/@xmath58 .",
    "33 events passed all cuts with an expected background of 11.6@xmath592.1 events .",
    "in contrast to the lepton plus jets mode , in the dilepton case due to the presence of two neutrinos the kinematics is not constrained . the number of non - measured kinematical variables is larger by one than the number of kinematic constraints ( @xmath60 ) . obviously , it is impossible to single out only one solution per event .",
    "we may take some event parameter ( @xmath61 ) as known in order to constrain the kinematics and then vary @xmath61 to determine a set of solutions . in order to determine a preferred mass , every solution should have a weight attached to it .",
    "the minimal requirement in the case of @xmath60 kinematics is to use a two dimensional vector as @xmath61 .",
    "we chose the azimuthal angles of the two neutrino momenta @xmath62 and create a net of solutions in the @xmath63 plane .",
    "for every point of the @xmath63 plane we have 8 solutions .",
    "two of them are generated by the two possibilities of associating the two charged leptons to the two leading jets which are assumed to originate from the @xmath20 partons .",
    "the four other solutions are generated from the four ways of associating each neutrino to two @xmath64 momenta , satisfying the w decay kinematics .",
    "we select the minimal @xmath65 solution for every point of the net for further use in our analysis .    using the @xmath65 value from a minimization we weight the selected solutions by @xmath66 .",
    "this is done in order to suppress the solutions which have worse compliance with the fit hypothesis .    the final extraction of the top quark mass from a sample of dilepton candidates is provided by the unbinned likelihood fit .",
    "the expected signal and background p.d.fs are obtained using monte carlo samples with detector simulation . the background - constrained fit ( n@xmath67=11.6@xmath592.1 ) returns : m@xmath68 = 169.8 @xmath69  gev / c@xmath70 , with 23.4@xmath71 signal events .",

    "the insert shows the mass dependence of the negative log - likelihood function .",
    "the right plot represents the error distribution for monte - carlo simulated experiments , where the arrows indicate the data result .",
    "we also performed a fit without constraining the number of background events . this fit returns m@xmath68 = 169.2@xmath72  gev / c@xmath70 , with 33.0@xmath73 signal events and 0.0@xmath74 background events .      to reconstruct the top quark mass in the dilepton channel",
    ", d   follows the ideas proposed by dalitz and goldstein in@xcite .",
    "the analysis uses about 230  @xmath10 of data .",
    "the initial selection includes :    * two leptons , electron or muon , with @xmath75 15 gev in the pseudorapidity regions @xmath761.1 or 1.5@xmath772.5 for the electron and @xmath782.0 for the muon . in e-@xmath3 events a separation cut of @xmath790.25",
    "is applied ; * two or more jets with @xmath75 20 gev in the pseudorapidity region @xmath802.5 ; * large missing @xmath5325 gev .",
    "however the @xmath1 cut is varied for di - electron or di - muon events depending on the @xmath81 or @xmath82 invariant mass ; * veto on the @xmath83 events ; * a cut @xmath84 0.25 rejects the events where the @xmath1 and @xmath3 vectors are close to each other in the transverse plane ; * @xmath85 140 gev , where @xmath57 is the scalar transverse momentum sum of the larger of the two lepton @xmath86s and of all jets over 15 gev . * for @xmath81 events a additional sphericity @xmath87",

    "the d   analysis method can be summarized as follows .",
    "the momenta of the two highest @xmath86 jets in the event are assigned to the @xmath20 from the decay of @xmath17 quarks .",
    "then a likelihood to hypothesized values of the top mass in the region of 80@xmath13280  gev is determined . for each event a solution is found when the pairs of @xmath17 momenta are consistent with the observed lepton and jet momenta and @xmath1 . a weight to each solution",
    "is assigned as    @xmath89    where @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) is the parton distribution function for the proton ( anti - proton ) and the initial quark ( anti - quark ) is carrying a momentum fraction @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "@xmath94 denotes the probability for the top ( anti - top ) quark with a mass @xmath95 to generate a lepton @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) with the observed energy in the top quark rest frame .",
    "there are two ways to assign the two jets to the @xmath21 and @xmath98 quarks .",
    "in addition , for each jet - to - parton assignment , there might be up to four solutions for each hypothesized value of the mass , coming from the fact that every neutrino may have up to two real solutions for its @xmath99 , satisfying the kinematics .",
    "then the likelihood for each value of the top quark mass @xmath7 is given by the sum of the weights @xmath100 over all possible solutions :    @xmath101    up to now there was an implicit assumption that all momenta are measured perfectly .",
    "therefore the weight in ( [ lhood3 ] ) is zero if no exact solutions are found . to account for detector resolution",
    "the weight calculations are repeated with input values for the particle momenta drawn from gaussian distributions with means equal of the measured values and widths corresponding to the detector resolution .",
    "in addition the @xmath1 value is recalculated from generated particle momenta and a random noise from a normal distribution with mean 0 gev and rms 8 gev is added .",
    "figure  [ fig : d0dilep ] up ( down ) shows the weight curves for @xmath88 ( @xmath81 ) events before ( solid line ) and after ( shadow area ) resolution smearing . for each event",
    "the value of the top quark mass at which the weight curve reaches its maximum is used as the estimator of the mass .",
    "after that , to extract the most probable top mass value from the data sample , a standard template method which exploits a binned maximum likelihood fit is applied .",
    "the likelihood fit returns @xmath102 = @xmath103 gev / c@xmath6 . the jes uncertainty ( 5.6 gev / c@xmath70 )",
    "dominates the systematic error .",
    "combining the presently available most accurate run  ii cdf and d   measurements in the dilepton and lepton plus jets decay topologies , one finds @xmath8  gev / c@xmath9 .",
    "this result is unofficial .",
    "the average is made by the author assuming simple correlations ( 0 or 1 ) between the systematic uncertainties in the cdf and d   measurements .",
    "the expected cdf uncertainty for jes systematics as a function of integrated luminosity is shown in figure  [ fig : summary ] , left .",
    "the right plots shows the total top mass error versus integrated luminosity for the cdf lepton plus jet analysis .",
    "one may conclude that with a run  ii integrated luminosity of 8  @xmath104 the top quark mass could be measured by cdf with a precision of @xmath132.0 gev / c@xmath6 .",
