    "in addition sn 1987a was detected in the radio shortly after outburst ( see turtle et al .",
    "1987 ) , but at a level significantly below that seen from the more distant type ii supernovae and from the galactic snr cas a. radio emission was also detected for a brief period from two type ibs , 1983n and 1984l ( sramek , panagia , & weiler 1984 ; weiler et al .",
    "1986 ; weiler & sramek 1988 ) , and from the type ic supernova 1990b ( van dyk et al .",
    "no type ia sne have been detected in the radio despite several searches ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "radio emission from supernova remnants ( snrs ) is typically observed long after the supernova phase .",
    "such factors as the density of the local interstellar medium affect the turn - on time in models such as those of cowsik & sarkar ( 1984 ) based upon the gull ( 1973 ) piston model .",
    "these models typically suggest a minimum of 100 years for the formation and brightening of an snr .",
    "sn  1987a is already indicating an increase in brightness with time ( gaensler et al .",
    "1997 ) , but it is entering a phase of delayed circumstellar interaction .",
    "we ( cowan & branch 1982 , 1985 ) have defined intermediate - age supernovae , from @xmath6  10300 years old , as spanning the period well after the optical emission fades ( typically about 2 years ) and before the turn - on of radio emission from an snr ( assumed to take at least 100 years ) .",
    "this time period is critical in understanding the later stages of stellar evolution . in particular ,",
    "the circumstellar mass loss rate for the supernova progenitors is a critical component in the initiation and duration of radio emission in the models of chevalier ( 1982 , 1984 ) .    to study this transition period ,",
    "we and others have attempted to detect radio emission from intermediate - age supernovae . while there have been a number of unsuccessful searches ( see @xcite ) , sne 1950b & 1957d in m83 ( @xcite ) , sn 1968d in ngc 6946 ( hyman et al .",
    "1995 ) and sn 1970 g in m101 ( @xcite ) have been detected in the radio more than a decade after explosion .",
    "( sn 1961v was also detected [ @xcite ] , but there is uncertainty about whether it really was a supernova [ filippenko et al .",
    "we also note that while the radio emission from sn  1980k has abruptly dropped after approximately ten years ( @xcite ) , sn  1979c ( at a greater distance than sn  1980k ) is still emitting at detectable levels ( @xcite )    in this _",
    "letter _ we report the probable detection of sn  1923a in m83 , which at an age of @xmath6 68 years would be the oldest intermediate - age supernova of known age .",
    "sn 1923a was discovered by c.  lampland ( lampland 1936 ) in m83 , classified as an sabc starburst galaxy at 4.1 mpc ( saha et al .",
    "1996 ) and home to 5 other supernovae ( sne 1945b , 1950b , 1957d , 1968l , 1983n ) .",
    "its position via offsets to the center of m83 is @xmath7 e and @xmath8 n. a recent re - analysis of the map of m83 from crb revealed two faint sources near the optical position of sn 1923a .",
    "observations of m83 were made at two epochs for each wavelength , 20 and 6 cm , at the very large array ( vla ) in different configurations such that the beam sizes were circular and approximately the same for all observations .",
    "the different `` hybrid '' configurations were used at the vla to obtain circular beam sizes for observations of m83 , at low declination .",
    "the phase and pointing centers for all images were at r.a.(1950)@xmath9 , dec.(1950)@xmath10 and the strong radio source 3c 286 was used as primary flux calibrator for all observations .    due to the non - thermal nature of the late - time radio emission from supernovae , m83",
    "was observed initially at 20 cm at the first epoch , and then at 6 cm to determine the spectral index of the observed sources . at the second epoch a problem with the online systems at the vla corrupted the 20 cm data taken in the hybrid bna configuration .",
    "the observations were repeated later in b configuration instead , resulting in a slightly different beam size than at the first epoch at 20 cm .",
    "table 1 summarizes the relevant parameters for each wavelength and epoch .",
    "the data reduction was done using the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) software provided by the national radio astronomy observatory .",
    "details of the original data reduction techniques are described in the papers regarding the observations of m83 ( cowan & branch 1985 , crb ) .",
    "while a maximum entropy method was used in the original image processing to reconstruct the diffuse structure , we have used clean for the second epoch observations to get a higher signal - to - noise for isolated point sources ( i.e. , sn 1923a ) where the diffuse structure was not important .",
    "we initially attempted to fit the two nearby point sources with two gaussian components simultaneously using jmfit , however , the relatively low signal - to - noise ratio of the two sources prevented convergence .",
    "therefore , all but one of the flux densities and positions were determined by fitting a quadratic function to each source , using the maxfit program of the aips package . for the other datum ,",
    "the fit using maxfit failed so that we report the peak flux using the aips routine imstat .",
    "a background level was estimated using tvstat at all wavelengths and epochs .",
    "the background level was determined to be on the order of the rms noise so it was included in the error estimation .",
    "pbcor was used to correct the fluxes for primary beam attenuation .",
    "images of the field of view can be seen in figure 1 and results for positions and fluxes are given in table 2 , along with the optical supernova position from pennington , talbot , & dufour ( 1982 ) .",
    "figure 1a shows approximately half of m83 at 20 cm along with several sources crb observed , labeled here as in that paper .",
    "figure 1b shows the region surrounding sn 1923a ( zoomed in from figure 1a ) and includes both sn candidates .",
    "figure 1c is a 6 cm map of approximately the same region as in figure 1b . to within the uncertainties ,",
    "both unresolved sources are coincident with the optical position .",
    "although we tentatively report the western ( closer ) source as probably being from sn 1923a , we can not exclude the possibility that either source may be sn 1923a .",
    "calculation of the spectral index , @xmath11 , ( @xmath12 ) between 20 and 6 cm ( at second epoch only ) reveals that both candidates are non - thermal , with the western source at @xmath13 and the eastern source at @xmath14 .",
    "some caution must be exercised in interpreting this value since the flux densities were measured at slightly different times .",
    "we can compare this value to the late - time spectral indices of other type ii sne ( @xmath15 [ 1950b , crb ] , @xmath16 1957d , crb ] , @xmath17 [ 1961v , cowan et al .",
    "1988 ] , @xmath18 [ 1968d , hyman et al . 1995 ] , @xmath19 [ 1970 g , cowan et al . 1991 ] , @xmath20 [ 1979c , @xcite ] )",
    ".    since there are 6 cm flux densities at two epochs , it is tempting to try to fit the data to a power - law in time ( @xmath21 ) for comparison with other events ( @xmath22 $ ] , @xmath23 $ ] ) . for sn 1923a",
    "we find @xmath24 and @xmath25 for the western and eastern sources , respectively . since the flux densities appear to be decreasing with time , both sources are consistent with being in the later stages of radio supernova evolution .",
    "while it is likely that both sources are fading radio sne , it is not clear which source is sn 1923a .",
    "although the detected sources are relatively weak , the non - thermal nature and the apparent positional coincidence with the location of sn  1923a ( as shown in table 2 ) make it probable that we have detected radio emission from this supernova .",
    "the sources are separated by about @xmath26 which , at the distance to m83 ( 4.1 mpc ) , corresponds to almost 70 pc , thus the sources can not both be from sn 1923a .",
    "past optical studies of the site of sn  1923a have shown evidence for an h  ii region at or near the supernova site .",
    "rumstay & kaufman ( 1983 ) list an h ii region  no .",
    "59 in their paper  within @xmath27 of the sn position as based upon offsets with respect to the center of its parent galaxy .",
    "richter & rosa ( 1984 ) refer to rumstay & kaufman h ii region no .",
    "59 as an h ii region associated with and lying @xmath28 from sn 1923a .",
    "pennington et al .",
    "( 1982 ) also note that sn 1923a appears to be coincident with an h  ii region .",
    "a map of h ii regions by de vaucouleurs , pence , & davoust ( 1983 ) , when overlaid with the scaled radio map , has our source for sn  1923a directly over the h ii region .",
    "since the progenitor star of sn  1923a has been estimated to have been massive , @xmath29 18 m@xmath30 ( pennington et al . 1982 ) , it should not have moved much prior to explosion , and the h  ii region near the radio source may be associated with the supernova s progenitor .",
    "the presence of an h  ii region at the sn site reduces the chances that the two sources are actually background sources .",
    "there is evidence for other similar associations of radio supernovae ( rsne ) and h ii regions ( van dyk 1992 ) , including sn  1957d ( also estimated to have resulted from a massive star ) in m83 ( crb ) .",
    "clearly new examinations of the area surrounding the site of sn  1923a in m83 to search for an optical counterpart to the radio source are warranted .",
    "on the basis of what is known about the shape of its light curve , sn  1923a has been tentatively designated as a sub - luminous type ii - p ( patat et al . 1994 , schaefer 1996 ) .",
    "no type ii - p ( other than sn  1987a ) has been detected previously in the radio . in figure 2 , we plot the radio luminosity at 20 cm of the new source assuming it to be sn  1923a , along with several other extra - galactic rsne and two galactic snrs , as a function of time since outburst . data and fits ( solid lines ) in figure 2 for the well - studied type ii - l sn 1979c were taken from weiler et al .",
    "( 1986 , 1991 ) , for the type ii - l sn 1980k from weiler et al .",
    "( 1986 , 1992 ) , for the type ib sn 1983n from weiler et al . ( 1986 ) and cowan & branch ( 1985 ) , for the type ii - l sn 1970 g from cowan et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , for the type ii - l sn 1968d from hyman et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and for sne 1950b & 1957d from crb .",
    "the distance to m83 ( 4.1 mpc ) was taken to be the cepheid  based distance to ngc 5253 , ( saha et al . 1995 ) , a fellow member of the centaurus group . as figure 2 illustrates , the luminosity of sn  1923a is comparable to , but slightly below , the two other intermediate - age supernovae we have detected in m83 , sne 1957d and 1950b .",
    "( these two supernovae are suspected to have had massive progenitors but their actual supernova types are unknown . ) sn 1957d may actually be somewhat less luminous than plotted , because emission from an associated h ii region may have contributed to the observed flux . the radio emission from sn",
    "1923a falls between that of cas a and the crab .    at an age of approximately 68 years",
    "when last observed , sn  1923a would be the oldest radio supernova yet discovered .",
    "detectable radio emission from supernovae decades after explosion ( but before the snr phase ) may in fact be uncommon , as evidenced by the small class of such known objects .",
    "observations of several other supernovae over a number of years also support that conclusion .",
    "while sn  1979c is still detectable , sn  1980k has dropped off sharply after a decade of being followed .",
    "recently montes et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have reported early - time radio emission from sn  1986e , while we were unable to detect this supernova at an intermediate - age despite a deep vla search ( eck et al .",
    "montes et al .",
    "( 1997 ) argue that sn  1986e is a typical type ii - l , similar to sn  1980k and the fading radio emission can be adequately explained in terms of the chevalier model .    what is the cause of the radio emission of sn  1923a ?",
    "no type ii - p events have been observed to undergo a prompt , bright circumstellar interaction such as that of radio supernovae .",
    "sn  1987a , having been a sub - luminous type ii - p , underwent a prompt but dim circumstellar interaction that would not have been detectable in a galaxy beyond the local group , but now it is beginning what promises to be stronger , delayed interaction with a detached circumstellar shell that originated back in its red giant days . if sn  1923a was a sub - luminous type ii ",
    "p , it may now be fading from the kind of delayed interaction that sn  1987a is just beginning .    the key radio observations needed now ( apart from more firmly establishing the presence of a non - thermal radio source at the site of sn  1923a ) are to trace the radio evolution of these sources , one of which is likely to be sn 1923a , the oldest radio supernova yet detected . while we noted above that theoretical models have suggested a minimum time of 100 years for the onset of the snr ( and a brightening ) phase , radio emission from the supernovae at this age has never been previously detected or studied .",
    "our observations at one wavelength seem to indicate that the source closest to the sn position is still fading with time , but our uncertainties are large .",
    "additional observations of sn 1923a will help to understand more about the nature of radio emission as supernovae evolve from intermediate - age to the snr phase .",
