    "under the extreme conditions of temperature and/or density a phase transition is expected in the qcd phase diagram .",
    "in fact , there are two phase transitions at these extreme conditions , namely the confinement to deconfinement phase transition and the chiral phase transition .",
    "these two phase transitions are defined in two extreme quark mass limits . for infinite quark mass limit confinement to deconfinement phase transition",
    "is well defined , and polyakov loop acts as the order parameter of the transition corresponding to the @xmath0 ( for three colours ) global symmetry breaking . in the limit of zero quark mass we have chiral symmetry restoring transition .",
    "this phase transition is characterized by the chiral condensate , which acts as the order parameter .",
    "but , in the real world where quark masses have a finite value , the nature of these phase transitions is not known .",
    "whether these two transitions will occur simultaneously or one will precedes the other remain an open question .",
    "order of the phase is another aspect of the phase transition which is also being pursued actively .",
    "here we are concerned with the thermodynamic aspect of the phase transition in terms of some relevant thermodynamic variables such as various quark number and isospin susceptibilities , specific heat , speed of sound etc .",
    ", to see how the behaviour of these variables change as we go from one phase to the another .",
    "being in the nonperturbative domain the lattice qcd and the effective models are the only theoretical framework which can be employed to study the phase transition .",
    "the effective model we employ here is known as the pnjl ( polyakov loop + nambu - jona - lasinio ) model . within the framework of pnjl model",
    "one can study both the confinement to deconfinement transition and the chiral phase transition together . for details of this model and of its various improvements see refs .",
    "@xcite    the plan of the paper is as follows . in the next section we briefly outline the theoretical framework . in section 3 ,",
    "our results are discussed and finally we conclude in section 4 .",
    "the coupling between the chiral and the deconfinement order parameter within the pnjl model allows us to study the thermodynamics of both the transitions inside a single theoretical framework .",
    "the thermodynamics of the gauge sector is controlled by the polyakov loop whereas the njl model takes care of the thermodynamics of the quark sector . to obtain various thermodynamic quantities",
    "we start with the thermodynamic potential per unit volume computed within the pnjl model  @xcite :      where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are , respectively , two light flavours condensates and the respective chemical potentials are @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "note that @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the quasi - particle energies are @xmath8 , where @xmath9 are the constituent quark masses and @xmath10 is the current quark mass ( we assume flavour degeneracy ) . @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the effective coupling strengths of a local , chiral symmetric four - point interaction .",
    "we take @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the coupling used in ref .",
    "@xmath15 is the 3-momentum cutoff in the njl model .",
    "the form of the effective gauge potential is in the form given by , @xmath16 \\ , \\label{effu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is taken from @xcite .",
    "it arises because of the transformation from matrix valued field @xmath18 to complex valued field @xmath19 .",
    "the role of this second term ( known as vandermonde determinant ( vdm ) term ) is to regulate the behaviour of @xmath19 so that its value remains within the group theoretic limit .",
    "this term is dropped while calculating the pressure .",
    "for details we refer to @xcite .",
    "once the thermodynamic potential @xmath20 is fixed , we first obtain the mean fields by minimizing @xmath20 w.r.t the field variables @xmath19 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath3 .",
    "we then calculate all the relevant thermodynamic quantities by appropriate differentiation of @xmath20 . here",
    "we are concerned with the various susceptibilities namely the quark number susceptibility ( qns ) and isospin number susceptibility ( ins ) .",
    "it is also to be noted that by qgp susceptibility we intend to mean these susceptibilities .",
    "susceptibilities are important as they are related to fluctuations which can be measured experimentally .",
    "we computed all these quantities from the taylor expansion of the pressure , as it is related to the thermodynamical potential via the relation , @xmath23 for susceptibilities we expand the scaled pressure ( @xmath24 ) in a taylor series for the quark number and isospin number chemical potentials , @xmath25 and @xmath26 respectively .",
    "the coefficients we are interested in are given by ,    @xmath27    @xmath28    the first equation represents the qns and its higher order derivatives whereas the second one corresponds to the ins and its higher order derivatives .",
    "specific heat and the speed of sound are calculated from the expansion of the pressure with respect to the temperature .",
    "explicit expressions of these quantities are given by :    @xmath29    @xmath30    for details of computing these coefficients please refer to @xcite .",
    "0.1 in    we present the qns , ins and their higher order derivatives with respect to @xmath25 in fig .  [ fg.scnord ] .",
    "we have plotted the lqcd data from ref .",
    "@xcite for quantitative comparison .",
    "we find , qns @xmath31 ( fig .  [ fg.c2 ] ) matches well with the lattice data upto @xmath32 but beyond which it goes to sb limit whereas the lattice data saturates at @xmath33 of the ideal gas value .",
    "similar trend is observed for ins @xmath31 .",
    "it remains close to lqcd data upto @xmath34 and then it saturates at sb limit . however both qns @xmath31 and ins @xmath31 agree well with each other which is also observed in lattice calculation .",
    "it is to be noted here the qns @xmath31 matches well with the lqcd data as shown in @xcite , if we do not include the vdm term .",
    "variation of next higher order coefficients @xmath35 of both qns and ins with temperature are shown in fig .",
    "[ fg.c4 ] .",
    "we find a good agreement for both the coefficients with the lattice data for whole range of temperatures .",
    "if we do not include the vdm term ( see @xcite ) then the qns @xmath35 matches the lattice data only upto @xmath36 .",
    "the effect of the vdm term is to bring the @xmath31 and @xmath35 coefficients to their respective sb limit .",
    "0.15 in    in fig .",
    "[ fg.cvcs ] we have presented our result for specific heat , speed of sound and conformal measure . compared to our previous observation in ref .",
    "@xcite the specific heat @xmath37 differs only marginally at higher temperature .",
    "we find a small peak near the transition temperature which in the case of critical end point ( cep ) will diverge . at higher temperature it saturates below the ideal gas limit and",
    "approaches the conformal limit of @xmath38 from above .",
    "the effect of the vdm term cancels out for both the speed of sound and the conformal measure as they are the ratios of the energy density and pressure .",
    "various thermodynamical variables of importance are calculated using an improved version of the pnjl model .",
    "all the variables estimated are found to be in reasonable agreement with the lqcd data , though the qns @xmath31 and the ins @xmath39 on the lattice are smaller by about 20 @xmath40 .",
    "we found all thermodynamical variables approach to their respective ideal gas limit at higher temperature .",
