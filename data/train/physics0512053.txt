    "the classical dynamics of scalar field theory has been extensively studied in the literature . in most investigations a lattice discretization of the scalar field is used , reducing the problem to the study of the dynamics of a system of non - linear coupled oscillators @xcite .",
    "the central question in this case is the evolution of the system towards a thermalized stationary state . in the early days",
    "fermi , pasta and ulam @xcite have obtained deviations , even for large times , from the naively expected equipartition of the energy among the different oscillators . through the efforts to explain these results , it became clear that , for appropriate initial conditions , a variety of periodic solutions ( breathers , solitary waves ) @xcite , defined on the non - linear lattice , exists",
    ". therefore , the choice of the ensemble of the initial configurations strongly influences the long time behavior of the system dynamics .",
    "recent works @xcite show that for a random ensemble of initial configurations a sufficiently large system relaxes to the usual equilibrium distribution , but the corresponding relaxation time strongly depends on the parameters of the theory .    in the present work",
    "we reconsider the classical dynamics of a scalar field in @xmath1 dimensions adopting a different point of view : as initial conditions we use an ensemble of scalar field configurations possessing a non - conventional profile , inspired by the order parameter fluctuations of a critical system at thermal equilibrium .",
    "these configurations generate a fractal measure on the lattice characterized by a corresponding fractal mass dimension .",
    "we do not consider here the dynamical process responsible for the formation of such a critical state , but we concentrate on its evolution once it has been formed . our aim is to investigate the deformation of the initial fractal measure as the system evolves according to the classical equations of motion . in particular , we are interested in determining the time scale for which signatures of the initial fractality survive , and leave their imprint in appropriate observables .",
    "we find that the initial geometry is successively deformed and restored again , with a frequency determined by the field oscillations .",
    "this behavior seems to be generic , since it is observed for both random as well as deterministic ( cantor - like ) fractal measure .",
    "moreover , we study in detail the influence of an additional thermalized non - critical scalar field , described initially by configurations with conventional geometry , coupled to the system , as well as the dependence of the corresponding characteristic time scales on the parameters of the theory .",
    "finally , we discuss the applicability of our model to the out - of - equilibrium evolution of an isoscalar condensate formed near the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) critical point during a heavy - ion collision experiment .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section ii is divided in two subsections . in subsection",
    "iia we present our model considering a single self - interacting scalar field . in iib we describe the generation of the ensemble of initial configurations for a scalar field corresponding to a random fractal measure on the lattice with a given fractal mass dimension .",
    "section iii contains the numerical results of the single field case and section iv the corresponding results for the evolution of field configurations initially generating a deterministic fractal measure with cantor - like structure . in section",
    "v we analyze the dynamics of two coupled scalar fields .",
    "finally , in section vi we summarize our results and discuss their relevance to the phenomenology of out - of - equilibrium critical systems .",
    "our model consists of a classical scalar field @xmath2 obeying the usual @xmath0-dynamics described by the lagrangian density : @xmath3 with the potential @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the coupling parameters of our model . all the quantities ( @xmath2 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , as well as the space - time variables ) appearing above are chosen dimensionless . following the @xmath2-model",
    "we assume that the @xmath7 symmetry ( @xmath8 ) is broken only through a linear term in the potential , setting the coefficient of the cubic term to zero .",
    "furthermore , we have absorbed one more parameter by rescaling the field as well as the space - time units .",
    "thus , only two parameters remain in the potential term .",
    "we consider the dynamics of the scalar field in @xmath1 dimensions .",
    "the corresponding equation of motion is @xmath9 where dot represents time derivative and prime the spatial one . to proceed numerically we have to discretize eq.([eoms ] ) on a lattice",
    "this reduces the system to a chain of non - linear coupled oscillators .",
    "we use the following leap - frog discretization scheme : @xmath10 , \\label{leap - frog}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the lattice spacing , @xmath12 is the time step , the upper indices correspond to time steps and the lower indices to lattice sites . as usual",
    "we perform an initial fourth order runge - kutta step to make our algorithm self - starting .",
    "we are interested in studying the evolution of the above system determined by eq.([eoms ] ) , using an ensemble of initial field configurations possessing a non - conventional profile , characterized by a fractal mass dimension .",
    "the motivation of this choice and the details of constructing such an ensemble , defined on a 1-dimensional lattice , are given in the next subsection .",
    "the absolute value of the @xmath2-field introduced in the previous subsection is interpreted as local density , and the corresponding fractal behavior is described by a fractal measure demonstrated in the dependence of the mean `` mass '' on the distance @xmath14 around a point @xmath15 defined by : @xmath16 obeying the power law @xmath17 for every @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath18 is the fractal mass dimension of the system @xcite and the mean value is taken with respect to the ensemble of the initial @xmath2-configurations .",
    "the production of a @xmath2-ensemble possessing the fractal measure described in eqs .",
    "( [ massdimen],[masspower ] ) , has been accomplished in @xcite .",
    "it is based on the observation that a scale invariant free energy of the form : @xmath19=\\int_v d^dx \\ { \\frac{1}{2 } ( \\nabla \\sigma)^2 + g \\sigma^{\\delta+1 }   \\ } , \\label{effact}\\ ] ] when introduced as a weight in the partition function : @xmath20 e^{-\\gamma[\\sigma]},\\nonumber\\ ] ] of the scalar field @xmath2 , generates piecewise constant configurations leading to an ensemble possessing fractal mass dimension ( according to the definition above ) : @xmath21 in the following we will use @xmath22 and the dimension @xmath23 , therefore the corresponding fractal mass dimension is @xmath24 .",
    "it must be noted that the free energy ( [ effact ] ) for @xmath25 , @xmath22 and @xmath26 describes the effective action of the @xmath27 ising model at its critical point @xcite .    in practice , to produce critical configurations on a lattice we use the following algorithm @xcite : we perform a random partitioning of the lattice in elementary clusters of different size @xmath28 .",
    "thus , each cluster consists of several lattice points . within each cluster the value of @xmath2",
    "is assumed to be constant . to obtain the values of @xmath2 in the different clusters we use a uniform random distribution .",
    "each @xmath2-field configuration is weighted by a factor @xmath29}$ ] , where @xmath30 $ ] is calculated for the given configuration , using the coupling value @xmath26 .",
    "we use a metropolis algorithm @xcite to perform a random walk in the configuration space of the @xmath2-field .",
    "we perform firstly @xmath31 initial algorithmic steps in order to achieve equilibrium . the @xmath13 ensemble is then formed by recording a large number ( @xmath32 ) of statistically independent @xmath2-configurations .    with this procedure",
    "we acquire an ensemble of field configurations generating a random fractal measure on the lattice as a statistical property after ensemble averaging .",
    "this property is not reflected in the geometry of either one configuration neither in their average @xmath33 , which is depicted in fig .",
    "[ sigma0 ] , but is produced only through the entire ensemble .",
    "each one of the configurations as well as their average , have a continuous power spectrum ( @xmath34 ) resembling a colored noise profile , and the mean value of the field ( spatial average ) is almost zero .",
    "the produced ensemble possesses the property ( [ masspower ] ) , where now the fractal mass dimension is determined by the power - law behavior of latexmath:[$m(x_0,\\xi)=\\langle\\int^{x_0+\\xi}_{x_0 }    inside clusters of size @xmath28 .",
    "the @xmath36 versus @xmath28 figure is drawn as follows : for a given @xmath37 of a specific configuration we find the size @xmath28 of the cluster in which it belongs and we calculate the integral latexmath:[$\\int^{x_0+\\xi}_{x_0 }    @xmath36 vs @xmath28 figure .",
    "for the same @xmath37 we repeat this procedure until we cover the whole ensemble , and the aforementioned figure is formed . averaging in @xmath37",
    "obviously does not alter the results , since @xmath39 , with @xmath40 spanning the entire lattice . in fig",
    "[ spower1]a we observe that in the log - log plot of @xmath36 vs @xmath28 , the slope @xmath41 , i.e the fractal mass dimension @xmath18 according to ( [ masspower ] ) , is equal to @xmath42 , which is the theoretical value calculated from ( [ fracdim ] ) , within an error of less than 0.3% .",
    "we study the evolution of the system determined by equation ( [ eoms ] ) which we solve in 1-d 2000-site lattice , using as initial conditions an ensemble of @xmath43 independent @xmath2-configurations on the lattice generated as described above , i.e possessing fractal characteristics .",
    "the initial time derivatives of the field , that is the kinetic energy , are assumed to be zero , since this is a strong requirement of the initial equilibrium .",
    "the ensemble population is by far satisfactory since the results are independent of it as long as it is larger than @xmath44 ( numerically tested ) , and furthermore they are independent from the number of the lattice sites provided that it is greater than @xmath45 .",
    "we investigate the evolution of @xmath46 which initially is a power law @xmath47 , where @xmath48 ( fractal mass dimension ) .    in order to understand the dynamics of the @xmath2-field within this ensemble we firstly consider the evolution of the field s mean value @xmath49 , as well as its standard deviation @xmath50 .",
    "the averages are taken over all statistically independent configuration .",
    "we classify the dynamics in six different cases , produced through a suitable choice of the parameters @xmath6 and @xmath51 , according to the corresponding form of the potential plotted in fig [ potetial.plot ] . in fig .",
    "[ sketo.s.final1 ] we depict the evolution of @xmath49 for these cases . for zero @xmath6 and @xmath5 , the potential term vanishes and",
    "the mean value of the field remains constant and equal to a very small value determined by the initial conditions . for non - zero @xmath6",
    "the field oscillates around the potential minimum and the oscillation amplitude as long as the frequency increase with @xmath6 for fixed @xmath5 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the minimum value of the potential decreases and at the same time the value of @xmath2 , for which the potential minimum occurs , increases ( see figs .  [ potetial.plot ] and [ sketo.s.final1 ] ) .",
    "note furthermore that due to the quadric anharmonic term in the potential the time mean value of the oscillations is slightly smaller than the potential minimum . on the other hand , for small @xmath5",
    ", @xmath49 oscillates almost harmonically , and the amplitude together with the minimum decrease with increasing @xmath5 , while the frequency increases . for @xmath52",
    "the oscillations damp relatively fast ( the larger the @xmath5 values the faster the rate , as the potential becomes steeper ) , leading to a stabilization of @xmath49 . finally , in fig .",
    "[ sketo.s.final2 ] we show the evolution of the ensemble average of the standard deviation of the @xmath2-field for the same parameters as above .",
    "note that the standard deviation can be quite large even if @xmath49 remains small , such as in the @xmath53 , @xmath54 case .    as a next step",
    "we calculate the evolution of @xmath55 defined previously .",
    "as time passes the power - law form of @xmath56 remains , but the corresponding exponent @xmath57 increases , approaching the value @xmath58 , when the signs of the initial fractal geometry disappear and a conventional pattern establishes , as is depicted in fig .  [ spower1 ] .",
    "however , a more detailed analysis for greater time intervals reveals a remarkable phenomenon . in the solid line plots of fig .",
    "[ spower.evol ] we show the evolution of @xmath41 ( each @xmath41 value coming from a linear fit ) .",
    "it can be clearly observed that the characteristic exponent @xmath57 after reaching the value 1 , fluctuates and for particular times becomes almost equal to @xmath59 .",
    "thus , the initial fractal measure is restored repeatedly within the considered ensemble .",
    "a simultaneous study of this graph and fig .  [ sketo.s.final1 ] is illuminating , since we observe that the reappearance of the fractal mass dimension , describing the initial measure , occurs when the mean field value becomes almost zero .",
    "if we interpret the @xmath2-field as a system of coupled anharmonic oscillators with initial field values around zero and zero kinetic energy , we expect an almost simultaneous pass from their turning points , due to synchronization .",
    "the energy transfer between the different oscillators takes place through the spatial derivative , as can be seen in equation ( [ eoms ] ) .",
    "therefore , if it is small compared to the other terms ( which is the case in general ) , the oscillators do not mix significantly , and due to their initial zero kinetic energy they roll to their common minimum , they oscillate around it and then return to their starting position almost in phase and with kinetic energy close to the initial one , i.e close to zero .",
    "so , every time the kinetic energy and the mean field value become zero , the system reaches to a state similar to the initial one , leading to the restoration of the initial fractal measure . on the other hand ,",
    "when the oscillators roll away from zero , the geometrical characteristics of the ensemble are changed by the dynamics , since they acquire large field values and large kinetic energy ( compared to the initial ones ) .    in figs",
    "[ spower.evol]b,c,d we can clearly observe this behavior .",
    "moreover , @xmath57 in figs [ spower.evol]e and f is also easily interpreted since in these cases , following closely the evolution of the @xmath2 mean value , it stabilizes after some reciprocations . finally , the behavior of @xmath41 for @xmath60 , @xmath61 depicted in fig .",
    "[ spower.evol]a is also expected since in this case ( [ eoms ] ) reduces to the simple wave equation , @xmath2 values stay always around zero , i.e around their initial values , and @xmath41 oscillates around a value between @xmath42 and @xmath62 , namely the signs of the initial fractal geometry are always visible .",
    "the dotted line plots of fig .",
    "[ spower.evol ] depict the time average of @xmath41 defined by @xmath63 . as it can be observed , the influence of the initial fractal mass dimension is still visible in this time integrated measure .",
    "lastly , in order to have a clearer apprehension of the aforementioned phenomenon , we perform some tests . in fig .",
    "[ diaforstests]a and [ diaforstests]b we present the evolution of the system with random initial conditions , prepared choosing the @xmath2 value at each site from a uniform distribution , for @xmath53 and @xmath64 .",
    "the mean field value oscillates around the minimum as before , and the slope @xmath41 which initially is obviously one , corresponding to a non - fractal system , remains equal to 1 as expected , independently of the field motion . following the arguments referred above",
    ", one could say that every time @xmath49 returns to zero the system enters in a state similar to the initial one , and @xmath57 remains always 1 since the initial state is characterized by @xmath65 . in figs",
    "[ diaforstests]c and [ diaforstests]d we evolve our system using initial conditions corresponding to a fractal measure with mass dimension @xmath59 , but with random non - zero ( actually quite large ) kinetic energy , for @xmath53 , @xmath64 . in this case",
    "the finite value of the initial kinetic energy ( different for every oscillator ) forbids the return of the system to a state close to the initial one , each time the mean value of the field passes through zero , suppressing the approach to the initial fractal state .",
    "( note that due to the large initial kinetic energy the system oscillates around both minima ) .",
    "additionally , in figs [ diaforstests]e and [ diaforstests]f we perform the following scenario : we evolve the initial ensemble , possessing fractal mass dimension @xmath59 , for @xmath53 , @xmath64 , introducing by hand a three orders of magnitude larger coefficient to the spatial derivative term in the equation of motion . as expected , the enhanced diffusion in this case induces very strong mixing of the oscillators , and as a consequence the system never reacquires the initial fractal characteristics . , taking small @xmath6 and @xmath5 and large @xmath66 . ]",
    "in order to acquire a better comprehension of the mechanism of the aforementioned phenomenon , we investigate the evolution of one cantor - like scalar field configuration .",
    "this set up , although not related to critical phenomena , is enlightening since in this case a direct geometrical interpretation at the level of one configuration is possible , instead of investigating the statistical fractal properties of an ensemble .",
    "firstly , we construct a finite approximation to the 1d cantor dust of @xmath67 sites , with hausdorf fractal dimension @xmath24 @xcite . in order to transform this fractal set into a field configuration defining a fractal measure on an equidistant lattice",
    "we find the minimum two - point distance of the set and using it as the lattice spacing we determine the size of the lattice by dividing the maximum two point distance in the set by the minimum one . in the sites of this new equidistant lattice that are closer to the locations of the points of the initial cantor set , we give the field value 1 , while in all the others we give the field value 0 .",
    "thus , we turn out with a field configuration in an equidistant lattice , which by construction has the property @xmath68 in a good precision , where the reference sites @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) are obviously only those with field values 1 . the averaging now is taken only on the different @xmath69 since we have only one configuration .",
    "the produced @xmath2-field configuration is depicted in fig .",
    "[ det.sav ] where the fractal property is clear .",
    "note that starting from the initial @xmath67 cantor lattice , we transited in a much larger ( @xmath71 sites ) equidistant one .",
    "now , we evolve this @xmath2-configuration according to equation of motion ( [ eoms ] ) taking zero initial kinetic energy , and we focus on the evolution of latexmath:[$\\langle\\int^{x_{0,i}+\\zeta}_{x_{0,i } }    mass dimension @xmath48 as can be seen in the upper graph of fig .",
    "[ det.3power ] .    in fig .",
    "[ det.fields ] we demonstrate the evolution of the mean value of the field , its standard deviation , and the slope @xmath41 , for potential parameters @xmath53 and @xmath73 .",
    "we observe the same behavior with the case of the previous section , that is the change of the initial fractal mass dimension , and its return to this value each time @xmath49 approaches zero .",
    "the explanation is the same as before without any significant new ideas .",
    "the only difference is that in the present case only a small subset of the entire lattice is initially described by a fractal measure with mass dimension @xmath42 .",
    "the remaining lattice sites are occupied by zero field values , which initially have zero contribution to @xmath74 .",
    "however , as the system evolves , these initially zero oscillators roll towards the potential minimum , producing a non - fractal background , i.e a linear contribution to @xmath75 , and thus supplanting and suppressing the total power law behavior .",
    "on the other hand , when the mean field value returns to zero , the system reaches a state similar to the initial one , ( zero mean field value and zero kinetic energy ) , the initially zero oscillators approach again the value @xmath76 almost in phase and reproduce a configuration with fractal mass dimension @xmath77 . in fig .",
    "[ det.3power ] we depict @xmath78 versus @xmath79 for three times .",
    "the first corresponds to the initial moment , the second to the first complete destruction of the fractal geometry , and the third to the first approximate re - establishment of the initial fractal measure .",
    "it is interesting to extend the single field model of section ii in the case of two coupled fields , one of them having a fractal profile and the other a conventional one . in this case",
    "the lagrangian density ( [ lagrs ] ) is extended to @xmath80 with the potential @xmath81 avoiding to introduce additional parameters .",

    "in the next subsection we describe the generation of the ensemble of 1-d @xmath83-configurations on the lattice , using the algorithm introduced in @xcite .",

    "[ spfields]a , b we demonstrate the evolution of the mean @xmath2-field and its standard deviation , and in figures [ spfields]c , d the corresponding quantities for the @xmath83-field , for @xmath53 and @xmath64 .",
    "the absence of a term linear in @xmath83-field in the potential ( [ potsp ] ) , leads to slight oscillations , due to the small initial total energy of the @xmath83-field , of the mean value @xmath104 around zero .",
    "the anharmonic character of these oscillations relies on the non - linear form of the equation of motion ( [ eomsp ] ) , and is enhanced relatively to the @xmath2 case due to the large variation of the coupling term @xmath105 .",
    "note however that although the mean field value @xmath104 remains small , this is not the case for its fluctuations which can become quite large . on the other hand ,",
    "as one can see in figures [ spfields]a , b , the corresponding @xmath2 quantities do not differ significantly from the single field case since @xmath83-field remains small .    in fig .  [ sp.power ]",
    "we depict the slope @xmath57 for the aforementioned evolution scenario of the @xmath2-field interacting with the @xmath83-field . in general",
    "we observe the same phenomenon as in the single field case , that is @xmath57 becomes approximately equal to its initial value every time @xmath49 approaches zero .",
    "however , the stronger non - linearity forbids @xmath49 to become exactly zero but rather to obtain a small finite value , which in turn has as a consequence that @xmath57 does not approach so closely the initial value as in the single field case . this is illustrated in figs .",

    "however , in both cases the system maintains a memory of its initial fractal characteristics .",
    "we have evolved the system with various @xmath83-field initial conditions ( random , constant etc ) in order to check the generality of the results described above .",
    "it turns out that for the two - field case the re - establishment of the initial fractal geometry does not depend on the specific @xmath83-field initial conditions , unless they are fine tuned so that @xmath49 is driven to large values without occasionally returning close to the region @xmath110 .",
    "in this work we investigate the evolution of the fractal characteristics of a single or two coupled scalar fields system , within the framework of the general @xmath2-model . after a relatively rapid deformation of the initial fractal geometry",
    ", we observe that it is being re - established almost periodically each time the mean value of the @xmath2-field returns to zero .",
    "this effect is obtained using both random , as well as deterministic ( cantor - like ) fractal set up . the key point for the occurrence of this behavior",
    "is the condition of initial equilibrium .",
    "as the system practically consists of coupled anharmonic oscillators , this condition is expressed through the zero initial kinetic energy for each oscillator , leading to a synchronous evolution of the entire system .",
    "additionally , the fractal measure characterizing the initial state is based on the fact that the corresponding field configurations represent fluctuations ( with a specific pattern ) around zero .",
    "thus , each time the oscillators pass through their turning points , associated to zero mean field value , in phase , the initial fractal geometry is being re - established .",
    "the above evolution , at least qualitatively , is quite general and robust for a very wide parametric space .",
    "the scenario analyzed in this paper could be extended to 3 dimensions and serve as a model in order to describe the evolution of the order parameter fluctuations in a critical system .",
    "in particular it could be used to explore the non - conventional correlations which are expected to occur during the formation of an isoscalar condensate in a heavy ion collision experiment . in this case one",
    "has to adapt the @xmath2-model lagrangian in order to describe correctly the characteristics of the order parameter associated with the 2nd order critical end point of the chiral qcd phase transition @xcite . at the phenomenological level",
    "these correlations are expressed through the fractal mass dimension of the @xmath2-field configurations , determining the statistical properties of the condensate .",
    "the dynamics of the system is similar to the two - field case investigated above , provided that the critical system is initially at equilibrium .",
    "one can study the evolution of the initial fractal characteristics of the @xmath2-field and the possibility to leave signals at the detectors , supplying an indication of the phase transition .",
    "the discussion of the present work supports this eventuality since the time average ( in order to simulate the experimental conditions ) of the periodical deformation and re - establishment of the initial fractal geometry , will leave a signature .",

    "<S> we extend our study to the case of two interacting scalar fields , and we find qualitatively similar results . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , our analysis indicates that the geometrical properties of a critical system initially at equilibrium could sustain for several periods of the field oscillations in the phase of non - equilibrium evolution . </S>"
