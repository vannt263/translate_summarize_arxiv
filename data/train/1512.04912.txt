    "consumer spending is an integral component of economic activity . in 2013 , it accounted for 71% of the us gross domestic product ( gdp ) , a measure often used to quantify economic output and general prosperity of a country . given its importance , many studies focused on understanding and characterizing consumer behavior .",
    "researchers examined gender differences and motivations in shopping  @xcite , as well as spending patterns across urban areas  @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", shopping has increasingly moved online .",
    "consumers use internet to research product features , compare prices , and then purchase products from online merchants , such as amazon and walmart .",
    "moreover , platforms like ebay allow people to directly sell products to one another .",
    "while there exist concerns about the risks and security of online shopping  @xcite , large numbers of people , especially younger and wealthier  @xcite , choose online shopping even when similar products can be purchased offline  @xcite .",
    "in fact , online shopping has grown significantly , with an estimated $ 1,471 billion dollars spent online in 2014 in the united states alone by 191 million online shoppers .    most of these online purchases result in a confirmation or shipment email sent to the shopper by the merchant .",
    "these emails provide a rich source of evidence to study online consumer behavior across different shopping websites .",
    "unlike previous studies  @xcite , which were based on surveys and thus limited to relatively small populations , we used email data to perform a large - scale study of online shopping . specifically , we extracted information about 121 million purchases amounting to 5.1b dollars made by 20.1 million shoppers , who are also yahoo mail users .",
    "the information we extracted included names of purchased products , their prices , and purchase timestamps .",
    "we used email user profile to link this information to demographic data , such as gender , age , and zip code .",
    "this information enabled us to characterize patterns of online shopping activity and their dependence on demographic and socio - economic factors .",
    "we found that , for example , men generally make more purchases and spend more on online purchases .",
    "moreover , online shopping appears to be widely adopted by all ages and economic classes , although shoppers from more affluent areas generally buy more expensive products than less affluent shoppers .",
    "looking at temporal factors affecting online shopping , we found patterns similar to other online activity  @xcite . not surprisingly , online shopping has daily and weekly cycles showing that people fit online shopping routines into their everyday life .",
    "however , purchasing decisions appear to be correlated .",
    "the more expensive a purchase , the longer the shopper has to wait since the previous purchase to buy it .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that most shoppers have a finite budget and have to wait longer between purchases to buy more expensive items .",
    "in addition to temporal and demographic factors , social networks are believed to play an important role in shaping consumer behavior , for instance by spreading information about products through the word - of - mouth effect  @xcite .",
    "previous studies examined how consumers use their online social networks to gather product information and recommendations  @xcite , although the direct effect of recommendations on purchases was found to be weak  @xcite .",
    "in addition , people who are socially connected are generally more similar to one another than unconnected people  @xcite , and hence , they are more likely to be interested in similar products .",
    "our analysis confirmed that shoppers who are socially connected ( because they email each other ) tend to purchase more similar products than unconnected shoppers .",
    "once we understand the factors affecting consumer behavior , we are then able to predict it .",
    "given users purchase history and demographic data , we attempt to predict the time of their next purchase , as well as the price of their next purchase . our method attains a relative improvement of at least 49.8% over the random baseline for predicting the price of the next purchase and 36.4% relative improvement over the random baseline for predicting the time of the next purchase .",
    "interestingly , demographic features were the least useful in the prediction task , while temporal features carried the most discriminative information .",
    "the contributions of the paper are summarized below :    * introduction of a unique and very rich data set about consumer behavior , extracted from purchase confirmations merchants send to buyers ( section  [ section : dataset ] ) ; * a quantitative analysis of the impact of demographic , temporal , and network factors on consumer behavior ( section  [ section : behavior ] ) ; * prediction of consumer behavior , specifically predicting when will the next purchase occur and how much money will be spent ( section  [ section : prediction ] ) .    a better understanding of consumer behavior can benefit consumers , merchants , as well as advertisers . knowing when consumers are ready to spend money and how much they are willing to spend can improve the effectiveness of advertising campaigns , and prevent consumers from wasting their resources on unnecessary purchases . understanding these patterns",
    "can help make online shopping experience more efficient for consumers .",
    "considering that consumer spending is such a large portion of the economy , even a small efficiency gain can have dramatic consequences on the overall economic activity .",
    "most online purchases result in a confirmation email being sent by the seller to the shopper .",
    "these emails provide an unique opportunity to study the shopping behavior of people across different online retail stores , such as amazon , ebay , and walmart .    [",

    "most of previous research on shopping behavior and characterization of shoppers has been conducted through interviews and questionnaires administered to groups of volunteers composed by at most few hundred members .",
    "* offline shopping * in physical stores has been studied in terms of the role of demographic factors on the attitude towards shopping .",
    "the customer s gender predicts to some extent the type of purchased goods , with men shopping more for groceries and electronics , while women more for clothing  @xcite .",
    "gender is also a discriminant factor with respect to the attitude towards financial practices , financial stress , and credit , and it can be a quite good predictor of spending  @xcite . many shoppers express the need of alternating the experience of online and offline shopping  @xcite , and it has been found that there is an engagement spiral between online and offline shopping : searching for products online positively affects the frequency of shopping trips , which in its turn positively influences buying online  @xcite .    * online shopping * has been investigated since the early stages of the web .",
    "many studies tried to draw the profile of the typical online shopper .",
    "online shoppers are younger , wealthier , more educated than the average internet user . in addition",
    ", they tend to be computer literate and to live in the urban areas  @xcite .",
    "their trust of e - commerce sites and their understanding of the security risks associated with online payments positively correlate with their household income and education level  @xcite , and it tends to be stronger in males  @xcite . the perception of risk of online transactions influences shoppers to purchase small , cheap items rather than expensive objects  @xcite .",
    "customers of online stores tend to value the convenience of online shopping in terms of ease of use , usefulness , enjoyment , and saving of time and effort  @xcite .",
    "their shopping experience is deeply influenced by their personal traits ( e.g. , previous online shopping experiences , trust in online shopping ) as well as other exogenous factors such as situational factors or product characteristics  @xcite .",
    "* demographic factors * can influence the shopping behavior and the perception of the shopping experience online .",
    "men value the practical advantages of online shopping more and consider a detailed product description and fair pricing significantly more important than women do .",
    "in contrast , some surveys have found that women , despite the ease of use of e - commerce sites , dislike more than men the lack of a physical experience of the shop and value more the visibility of wide selections of items rather than accurate product specifications  @xcite . unlike gender",
    ", the effect of age on the purchase behavior seems to be minor , with older people searching less for online items to buy but not exhibiting lower purchase frequency  @xcite . with extensive evidence from a large - scale dataset",
    "we find that age greatly impacts the amount of money spent online and the number of items purchased .",
    "* the role of the social network * is also a crucial factor that steers customer behavior during online shopping .",
    "often , social media is used to communicate purchase intents , which can be automatically detected with text analysis  @xcite . also , social ties allow for the propagation of information about effective shopping practices , such as finding the most convenient store to buy from  @xcite or recommending what to buy next  @xcite .",
    "survey - based studies have found that shopping recommendations can increase the willingness of buying among women rather than men  @xcite .",
    "* factors leading to purchases * in offline stores have been extensively investigated as they have direct consequences on the revenue potential of retailers and advertisers .",
    "survey - based studies attempted to isolate the factors that lead a customer to buy an item or , in other words , to understand what the strongest predictors of a purchase are .",
    "although the mere amount of online activity of a customer can predict to some extent the occurrence of a future purchase  @xcite , multifaceted predictive models have been proposed in the past . features related to the phase of information gathering ( access to search features , prior trust of the website ) and to the purchase potential ( monetary resources , product value ) can often predict whether a given item will be purchased or not  @xcite .",
    "* prediction of purchases in online shopping * is a task that has been addressed through data - driven studies , mostly on click and activity logs .",
    "user purchase history is extensively used by e - commerce websites to recommend relevant products to their users  @xcite .",
    "features derived from user events collected by publishers and shopping sites are often used in predicting the user s propensity to click or purchase  @xcite .",
    "for example , clickstream data have been used to predict the next purchased item  @xcite ; click models predict online buying by linking the purchase decision to what users are exposed to while on the site and what actions they perform while on the site  @xcite . besides user click and purchase events",
    ", one can leverage product reviews and ratings to find relationships between different products  @xcite .",
    "email is also a valuable source of information to analyze and predict user shopping behavior  @xcite . click and browsing features represent only a weak proxy of user s purchase intent , while email purchase receipts convey a much stronger intent signal that can enable advertisers to reach their audience .",
    "the value of commercial e - mail data has been recently explored for the task of clustering commercial domains  @xcite .",
    "signals to predict purchases can be strengthen by demographic features  @xcite .",
    "also , the information extracted from the customers profiles in social media , in combination with the information of their social circles , can help with predicting the category of product that will be purchased next  @xcite .",
    "studying the online consumer behavior as recorded by email traces allows to overcome the limitations of previous studies that focused either on small - scale surveys or on purchases logs from individual vendors . in this work",
    ", we provide the first very large scale analysis of user shopping profiles across several vendors and over a long time span .",
    "we measured the effect of age and gender , finding that the spending ability goes up with age till the age of 30 , stabilizes in the early 60s , and then starts dropping afterwards .",
    "regarding the gender , a female email user is more likely to be an online shopper than an average male email user .",
    "on the other hand , men make more purchases , buy more expensive products on average , and spend more money .",
    "younger users tend to buy more phone accessories compared to older users , whereas older users buy tv shows and vitamins & supplements more frequently . using the user location ,",
    "we show clear correlation between income and the number of purchases users make , average price of products purchased , and total money spent .",
    "moreover , we study the cyclic behavior of users , finding weekly patters where purchases are more likely to occur early in the week and much less frequently in the weekends . also , most of the purchases happen during the work hours , morning till early afternoon .",
    "we complement the purchase activity with the network of email communication between users . using the network , we test if users that communicate with each other have more similar purchases compared to a random set of users , and we find indeed that is the case .",
    "we also consider gender of the users and find that woman - woman pairs are more similar than man - man pairs that are also more similar to each other than the woman - man pairs .",
    "finally , we use our findings to build a classifier to predict the price and the time of the next purchase . our classifier outperforms the baselines , especially for the prediction of the time of the next purchase .",
    "this classifier can be used to make better recommendations to the users .",
    "our study comes with a few limitations , as well .",
    "first , we can only capture purchases for which a confirmation email has been delivered .",
    "we believe this is the case for most of online purchases nowadays .",
    "second , if users use different email addresses for their purchases , we would not have their full purchase history .",
    "similarly , people can share a purchasing account to enjoy some benefits ( e.g. , an amazon prime account between multiple people ) , but that occurs rarely , as suggested by the fact that less than 0.01% of the users have goods shipped to more than one zip - code .",
    "third , the social network that we considered , albeit big , is not complete .",
    "however , the network is large enough to observe statistically significant results .",
    "lastly , we considered the items that were purchased together as separate purchases ; it would be interesting to see which items are usually bought together in the same transaction . 0 some limitations / possible future improvements :                                                t.  hansen , j.  moller  jensen , and h.  stubbe  solgaard .",
