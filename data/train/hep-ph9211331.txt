    "given the number and nature of the assumptions we have made , a brief summary of our whole analysis is in order . after outlining our scaling procedure",
    ", we found that a @xmath37 total cross section of @xmath73 above a @xmath37 c.m.s .",
    "threshold @xmath99 corresponds to a @xmath76 cross section of @xmath228 at @xmath148 this sets an upper limit on the signal ( within the assumptions )  before any kind of backgrounds , acceptance , efficiencies , etc .",
    "are considered .",
    "going further , we scaled up an assumed hadronic multiplicity distribution and determined how @xmath229 is partitioned into contributions with fixed multiplicity ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "due to the rapidly falling @xmath37 luminosity , most @xmath37 interactions occur just above the assumed threshold @xmath59 which leads to @xmath230 when backgrounds are considered , a naive analysis reveals that signals containing @xmath231 goldstone bosons are likely dominated by generic backgrounds and suggests that the potentially detectable signal resides largely in the high - multiplicity tail of the multiplicity distribution .",
    "this restriction reduces the original @xmath232 approximately by a factor of two .",
    "signatures roughly consisting of a ) at least two high @xmath140 leptons ( presumably from @xmath159 decay ) and ten or more jets or b ) one leptonically reconstructed @xmath167 , one or more high @xmath140 leptons and eight or more jets have a combined cross section of a few fb which is a factor of 4 - 5 above the background . of course , given the nature of the assumptions involved , these cross sections are not to be taken literally  they are only meant to be indicative of the strengths or weaknesses of a multi-@xmath35 signal . a relatively interesting conclusion , however , is that if strong multi-@xmath35 production is to be observed over conventional backgrounds , the inelastic production of three or four longitudinal bosons is likely not sufficient ; one has to consider the productions of seven or more bosons .",
    "the frequency of such high multiplicity states will likely depend critically upon the details of the underlying strongly interacting theory .    if one is willing to entertain the notion of of inelastic @xmath37 physics above a @xmath37 c.m.s .",
    "threshold as low as @xmath233 then most of our results still hold and are of relevance to the ssc physics program . as can be deduced from figure  2 , the total signal rates for ( @xmath234 ) are identical to those for ( @xmath235 ) .",
    "since the average charge multiplicity @xmath88 is a slowly varying function of @xmath62 a reduced threshold does not change the overall @xmath35 and @xmath236 multiplicity significantly . on the other hand ,",
    "all the background rates at the ssc are lower than at @xmath237    the broad conclusion to be drawn is that it appears feasible to observe multi-@xmath35 production arising from a strongly interacting higgs sector ( if such a sector exists at all ) . since the energy scale at which inelasticity sets in is generally determined by the masses of the low - lying resonances of the underlying strongly interacting theory , our results are only suggestive ( since they arise from conservatively assuming a rather high threshold of @xmath238 nevertheless , our results are rather encouraging and suggest that the inelastic @xmath7 and @xmath239 production may provide an interesting window to the mechanism of strongly broken electroweak symmetry .",
