    "the discussion of classical and quantum dynamics of spatially extended billiard chains , either with periodicity or disorder , is a promising field of research with a variety of direct applications , e.g. in nanophysics , fiber optics , electromagnetic cavities , etc .",
    "it is fair to say that studies in spatially extended billiard systems have been under represented as compared to a vast amount of work which has been dedicated to billiards on bounded domains .",
    "nevertheless , one has to mention several basic results in this type of systems .",
    "first , one can study the escape rates from finite portions of an infinite billiard chain , like the lorentz channel @xcite .",
    "second , one can study classical transport properties , such as diffusion and transport of heat along the billiard chains in order to understand the dynamical ( microscopic ) origin of the macroscopic transport laws @xcite .",
    "third , one can study the relation between deterministic diffusion in a classical billiard chain , anderson - like dynamical localization in the corresponding quantum chain , and the nature of its spectral fluctuations @xcite . and fourth",
    ", there is an interesting effect of localization transition in the presence of correlated disorder , which has been studied in the case of billiard chains both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "[ pic : shema ]    in this paper we discuss a class of classical billiard channels with an unusual and distinct dynamical property , namely uni - directionality of the ray motion along the chain .",
    "specifically we focus our study on a particular billiard chain  a channel with parallel semi - circular walls which we name as _",
    "serpent billiard_. the billiard under discussion is built as a periodic composition of semicircular rings of radii @xmath0 and @xmath1 , for the inner and outer circular arc , respectively .",
    "the geometry of this billiard chain and illustration of the ray dynamics are shown in fig .",
    "[ pic : shema ] . by construction",
    "the phase space separates into two disjoint invariant components corresponding to the left and right uni - directional motions , corresponding to two different signs of the angular momentum as defined with respect to the origin ( center ) of the ring of the current billiard cell . within each cell",
    "the angular momentum is conserved .",
    "further , it is obvious that upon the transition between one cell to another the sign of angular momentum , as calculated with respect two the centers of adjacent cells , remains unchanged",
    ". therefore , particles traveling from left to right initially will do so forever and will thus never be able to change the direction of travel , and similarly for the motion in the opposite direction , so that these two motions constitute two disjoint invariant halves of the phase space . nonetheless , as we shall show below",
    ", the dynamics inside each invariant half of the phase space may be ( practically ) totally chaotic and ergodic .",
    "we note that this property of uni - directionality can be proven for a more general billiard channel which is bounded by an arbitrary pair of _ parallel _ smooth curves .",
    "namely , it is easy to prove the following observation .",
    "+   + let the billiard motion in @xmath2 be bounded by two smooth @xmath3 curves @xmath4 , @xmath5 , with natural parameterizations @xmath6 .",
    "the curves @xmath7 and @xmath8 should never intersect and they should be parallel in the following sense : for any @xmath9 , a line @xmath10 intersecting @xmath7 _ perpendicularly _ at @xmath11 should also intersect @xmath8 _ perpendicularly _ , say at point @xmath12 defining a map @xmath13 .",
    "the function @xmath14 should be monotonously increasing invertible function , i.e. @xmath15 for all @xmath16 , or in other words , the lines @xmath10 _ should not intersect _ each other inside the billiard region",
    ".    then the billiard motion is _ uni - directional _ , i.e. the sign of the tangential velocity component @xmath17 stays constant for all collision points of an arbitrary trajectory .",
    "+   + to prove this observation , it is sufficient to consider two subsequent collisions of a segment of trajectory with a velocity of unit length @xmath18 .",
    "we may assume the first collision to take place at @xmath19 and write @xmath20 .",
    "then we consider two possible cases : + ( a ) the next collision happens on the curve @xmath8 , say at the point @xmath12 .",
    "then the angle of incidence again writes as @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath22 and @xmath23 are the angles between the segment of the trajectory and lines @xmath10 and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "since the latter two do not cross inside the billiard region , it follows that the sign of @xmath22 and @xmath23 should be the same ( positive ) .",
    "we may have @xmath25 only if @xmath26 , i.e. when the motion takes place along @xmath10 which is a periodic orbit . see fig .",
    "[ pic : diag]a .",
    "+ ( b ) another possibility is that the next collision happens with the same curve , i.e. at @xmath27 .",
    "writing @xmath28 we again observe that the sign of the angles @xmath22 and @xmath23 should be the same ( positive ) , considering that the other ends of the lines @xmath10 and @xmath29 at points @xmath30 and @xmath31 should lie on the same side of the trajectory segment since the latter should not cross @xmath8 .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ pic : diag]b .",
    "thus we have proven that @xmath10 is a family of marginally stable periodic orbits , of vanishing overall measure , which separates the phase space of the billiard into two halves of unidirectional motions .",
    "( a)(b )    it is perhaps worth stressing that the conditions of parallelism as expressed in the statement imply also that the width of the channel should be constant , @xmath32 .",
    "+   + we should note that detailed understanding of the dynamics of such a class of billiards may have useful applications , in particular in fiber optics , electromagnetic waveguide propagation , etc . in the following sections we shall concentrate on the dynamics of the specific serpent billiard model , which we shall analyze in terms of a special version of the poincare map , the so - called jump map .",
    "then we shall describe analytically and numerically the average transport velocity , deterministic diffusion and correlation functions of the model .",
    "let us consider the hamiltonian dynamics of a particle in a serpent billiard channel . we are considering a classical point particle with a fixed velocity of unit size . due to uni - directionality of the motion , as shown above",
    ", we may freely choose to consider only forward propagation  in the positive direction of @xmath33 axis  as it is shown in the example of fig .",
    "[ pic : shema]b .",
    "the forward dynamics of the billiard can be written in terms of dynamics within a given basic cell and a transition to an adjacent basic cell . in order to fully describe the dynamics we only need to know a poincar ' e - like transformation which maps coordinates of an entry into a cell to the coordinates of an exit and the time spent between entry and exit ( the entry into an adjacent cell ) .",
    "thus we formulate the dynamics of our billiard chain in terms of a jump map model @xcite .",
    "we shall define the jump map more precisely below .",
    "let the particle enter the basic cell on the left end at the initial position @xmath33 and with the horizontal velocity component @xmath34 and travel to the right end where it exits at the position @xmath35 and velocity @xmath36 . to clarify the notation we introduce a phase space _",
    "entry section _ @xmath37 and an _ exit section _ @xmath38 @xmath39 , v_x\\in [ -1,1]\\},\\quad    { \\cal s}_{\\rm r } = \\{(x , v_x ) : x\\in [ q,1 ] , v_x\\in [ -1,1]\\}.\\ ] ] the dynamical mapping of an entry point to an exit point shall be denoted by @xmath40 , @xmath41 the map @xmath42 can be expressed analytically since the billiard in the circular ring is integrable .",
    "since the lengthy expression is not very illuminating we give its explicit form in the appendix . in order to be able to apply @xmath42 again",
    ", we have to transform the current exit position @xmath35 to the entry position of the next basic cell by a map @xmath43 @xmath44 with this transformation the conservation of angular momentum around the center of the current cell is broken which implies non - integrability of the model .",
    "we should mention that our serpent billiard falls into the category of _ semi - separable _",
    "systems @xcite .",
    "the propagation of a particle from one basic cell to another can then be stated in terms of a single map @xmath45 @xmath46 we will refer to @xmath47 as a _ jump _ or _",
    "poincare map _ and to the phase space @xmath48 as a _ surface of section _",
    "( sos ) . in terms of the map @xmath47 the dynamics over the whole channel is decomposed into spatially equidistant snapshots .",
    "in order to maintain the whole physical information about the dynamics we have to introduce the _ time function _ @xmath49 , i.e. @xmath50 measures the time needed by a particle to travel from the entry point @xmath51 to the other end of the basic cell .",
    "the pair @xmath52 now represents the _ jump model _ corresponding to our billiard channel .",
    "again , the time function @xmath50 could be written out explicitly , though with a cumbersome expression , so we put it in the appendix .",
    "however , we should note that numerical routines for computing the map @xmath47 and the function @xmath53 are very elementary and efficient .    as a useful illustration of the gross dynamical features of the model we plot in fig .",
    "[ pic : phase_space ] the phase portraits of the poincar ' e - jump map @xmath47 for different values of the parameter @xmath54 .",
    "we observe that the jump map has in general a mixed phase space with chaotic and regular regions coexisting on sos .",
    "we also observe that the phase portraits are symmetric in @xmath33 around the mean radius @xmath55 .",
    "we note that the chaotic component is always dominant in size over the regular components and for certain regions of parameter @xmath54 values the regular components are practically negligible so the jump map appears to become ( almost ) fully chaotic and ergodic .",
    "one nice example where we were unable to locate a single regular island has the parameter value @xmath56 . in fig .",
    "[ pic : ratio ] we plotted the relative area of regular sos components as a function of parameter @xmath54 . # 1#2    in order to quantify the exponential instability of trajectories inside the chaotic component of sos we have measured the average lyapunov exponent @xmath57 ( as described e.g. in @xcite ) .",
    "the result for @xmath57 as a function of @xmath54 is shown in fig .",
    "[ pic : lyap ] .",
    "we observe that the chaoticity as measured by @xmath57 , being equal to the dynamical kolmogorov - sinai entropy , is always positive and is increasing monotonically with @xmath54 .",
    "this trend was somehow intuitively expected , as the number of collisions within the jump increases with @xmath54 .",
    "namely , the bigger number of collisions between entry and exit sections implies less correlation between the angular momenta of the adjacent cells meaning stronger integrability breaking .",
    "important fingerprints of dynamics , in many ways complementary to lyapunov exponents , are the time - correlation functions .",
    "these reflect the mixing property of the system which implies decay to equilibrium of an arbitrary initial phase space measure .",
    "time correlation functions are also directly related to transport , which is studied in the next section , through a linear response formalism .",
    "we discuss discrete time correlation function of the jump map between two observables @xmath58 and @xmath59 , which is defined as @xmath60 the correlation functions are normalized such that always , @xmath61 , even for observables which are not in @xmath62 . in the sequel we consider autocorrelation functions of very regular observables such as the phase space coordinates , namely @xmath63 and @xmath64 , and the autocorrelation function of the time function @xmath65 which is even more interesting for two reasons : ( i ) @xmath65 is directly related to particle transport as described in the next section , and ( ii ) @xmath53 is not in @xmath62 as discussed below . numerical data presented in fig .",
    "[ pic : corr ] strongly suggest that correlation function @xmath65 typically exhibits exponential decay @xmath66 for most of values of @xmath54 , except that for small parameter values @xmath67 the initial exponential - like decay seems to turn into an asymptotic power law decay @xmath68 . on the other hand the correlation decay of non - singular observables , like @xmath63 and @xmath64 seems to behave as a power law for all values of @xmath54 .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the qualitative nature of correlation decay seems to be quite different for different classes of observables such as @xmath33 compared to @xmath53 .",
    "however , in all the cases time correlation functions strongly decay which is a firm indication of the mixing property of the serpent billiard on the chaotic component .",
    "+    the time function @xmath50 is expected to have a singularity for @xmath69 as it may take arbitrary long to traverse the semicircular ring with sufficiently small value of angular momentum .",
    "it is straightforward to show that this is a square - root singularity @xmath70 an example of the structure of the time function for @xmath56 is shown as a density plot in fig .",
    "[ pic : time_fun]a .",
    "another quantity which can illustrate the dynamical behaviour of observable @xmath53 is the probability distribution @xmath71 of times @xmath50 for a very long chaotic trajectory . assuming that the system is ergodic on the full sos , the probability distribution @xmath71 can be written in terms of the constant invariant measure on sos @xmath72 singularity ( [ eq : sing ] )",
    "implies the asymptotic form of the distribution @xmath73 for large @xmath74 .",
    "this asymptotic property does not essentially depend on the full ergodicity of the map , as we find the same asymptotic behaviour by numerical simulation of @xmath75 for different values of @xmath54 as shown in fig .",
    "[ pic : time_fun]b .",
    "it is obvious that the only important condition for the universal decay of @xmath75 is that the chaotic component should extend to the lines of singularity @xmath76 .",
    "the distribution @xmath75 is very important , because it directly connects to the particle transport properties of the channel that are discussed in the next section .",
    "\\(a ) ( b )",
    "here we would like to examine the transport properties along our billiard chain in the context of the jump model .",
    "the basic cells are labeled with nonnegative integer @xmath77 starting with @xmath78 and counting forward to the right .",
    "transported length is measured as the number of traversed basic cells .",
    "this means that our length of travel is an integer but we should keep in mind that the physical length of one basic cell in the direction along the chain is @xmath79 .",
    "let us prepare an ensemble of particles on the sos @xmath37 of the zeroth basic cell , @xmath78 .",
    "the phase space is generally mixed and let the dominating chaotic component be denoted by @xmath80 .",
    "we observe that each invariant phase space component may have its own transport properties and to obtain a clear picture of transport we have to test each component separately .",
    "the transport on regular components ( islands ) of sos is obviously ballistic since the islands are transporting with a constant and sharply defined average velocity .",
    "thus we concentrate on the more nontrivial case of transport on the chaotic component , namely in the following we choose a uniform initial distribution of the particles over the leading chaotic component @xmath81 : @xmath82 .",
    "the transport of an ensemble of particles is described using the probability distribution @xmath83 of particles over the basic cells @xmath77 as a function of time @xmath74 .",
    "let us express this distribution in terms of a jump map @xmath84 and the time function @xmath50 . the time spent by a particle to traverse @xmath85 basic cells starting from the initial position @xmath86 is calculated as @xmath87 the probability distribution of a single particle with initial coordinate @xmath88 over the basic cells ( labeled by @xmath77 ) at time",
    "@xmath74 can be written straightforwardly as @xmath89 by averaging @xmath90 over an initial ensemble of particles , defined by @xmath91 we obtain the distribution of particles over the cells @xmath92 where we are using the ensemble average distribution of times needed to traverse @xmath93 basic cells , denoted as @xmath94 , @xmath95 let @xmath96 denote an average over the spatial distribution @xmath83 @xmath97 our aim is to obtain the time - asymptotic ( @xmath98 ) form of @xmath83 where only contributions of far lying cells @xmath99 are relevant . since the auto - correlation functions in our model are decaying very fast , in particular the relevant @xmath100 ( see the end of previous section ) , we may employ the central limit theorem and approximate the distribution of @xmath101 , @xmath94 , in terms of distribution of @xmath53 , @xmath102 : @xmath103 this approximation is very useful , because we can obtain the whole distribution @xmath83 using a single function @xmath104 that can be easily measured and is already plotted in fig .

    "@xmath105 we can treat the variable @xmath101 as infinitely divisible @xcite and the parameter @xmath93 as a continuous variable . then we can approximate the finite difference in @xmath93 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pnt ] ) in terms of a derivative @xmath106 and calculate @xmath83 as @xmath107 basic properties of the transport shall be described by the mean traversed length @xmath108 and the spatial spread of the initial ensemble @xmath109 .",
    "the mean @xmath108 can be asymptotically , for @xmath98 , exactly expressed by the formula @xmath110 from the central limit theorem we immediately obtain the mean velocity as the inverse mean traverse time @xmath111 the average @xmath112 , and the minimal time @xmath113 to traverse a basic cell , as a function of @xmath54 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ pic : times ] .",
    "the mean time @xmath112 is almost linearly increasing with increasing the parameter @xmath54 .",
    "this reflects the obvious fact that the travel becomes slower by narrowing the channel .",
    "the fact that the linear growth of @xmath108 is indeed given by velocity @xmath114 is also demonstrated numerically for @xmath56 in fig .",
    "[ pic : dif]a .",
    "it is a little more tedious to obtain an analytical approximation for the average spreading width @xmath115 .",
    "essentially we need to control the growth of second moment of distribution @xmath83 .",
    "this distribution is given by eq.([eq : approx_pnt ] ) in terms of @xmath94 which may be asymptotically expressed as a convolution of independent distributions @xmath116 ( [ eq : conv ] ) assuming sufficienly fast decay of temporal correlations as established numerically .",
    "as a consequence , @xmath94 inherits cubic singularity of @xmath116 , namely @xmath117 .",
    "this heuristic argument would suggest marginally normal diffusion @xmath118 , not essentially connected to the strength of correlation decay but simply as a consequence of singularity of the time function .",
    "this observation can be formalized with a brief calculation .",
    "we stress that for large times @xmath98 only cells with labels @xmath119 contribute appreciably to the probability distribution @xmath83 . in this regime",
    "we approximate @xmath94 using ( [ eq : approx_dpdt ] ) , hence we can easily write its fourier transform as @xmath120 the asymptotics of @xmath121 for @xmath122 will determine the asymptotics for @xmath94 for long times @xmath98 .",
    "thus we write the local expansion of @xmath121 around @xmath123 explicitly taking into account the known asymptotics in time domain , @xmath124 , namely @xmath125 where @xmath126 and @xmath22 are positive constants depending on the details of @xmath116 . using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : p1k],[eq : pnk ] ) and applying the inverse fourier transform we find that the limiting distribution , namely @xmath127 for large @xmath93 , is given by the formula @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the standard gaussian function . by inserting the above expression ( [ eq : limit_pn ] ) into approximation of @xmath83 ( [ eq : approx_pnt ] ) and expanding in terms of parameter @xmath130 we get the result @xmath131 from this analysis we predict that the diffusion of initial ensemble of particles will distribute over the basic cells with dispersion growing as @xmath132 . thus we have shown analytically that our serpent billiard exhibits marginally normal diffusion with a drift .",
    "we have tested our analytical results by performing extensive numerical simulations .",
    "an example of of @xmath133 for @xmath56 is shown in fig .",

    "we stress that our numerical data are indeed consistent with the marginally normal diffusion .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed a simple billiard chain , the so - called serpent billiard , with a special dynamical property of strictly uni - directional classical motion .",
    "we have also proven unidirectionality of motion for a more general class of billiard channels with parallel walls .",
    "the dynamics along the serpent billiard channel is described in terms of a variant of a jump model @xcite , namely the jump - poincar ' e map between the surfaces of section of two adjacent basic cells of the billiard , and the time function i.e. the time needed to traverse the basic cell as a function of the position on the surface of section .",
    "we have shown that the jump map is chaotic with generally mixed phase space , where the relative size of the largest chaotic component is generally increasing with decreasing of the channel s width .",
    "the latter dependence is not strictly monotonic , because of bifurcations of regular components , but for narrow channels the chaotic component is typically largely dominant . for a considerable range of the parameter ( denoting the channel s width )",
    "the jump map is even practically fully chaotic , ergodic , as no detectable islands of regular motion have been found .",
    "this does not mean that the islands of stability can not exist for typical values of the parameter .",
    "we only wish to stress that it is easy to find parameter values ( such as the case @xmath56 studied in the paper ) for which all possible islands of stability are undetectably small for numerical ( experimental ) purposes .",
    "numerically measured maximal lyapunov exponent shows that the chaoticity on a chaotic component is monotonically increasing with narrowing the channel .",
    "the transport of particles along the channel measured in the number of traversed basic cells exhibits a marginally - normal diffusion @xmath134 ( when the drift term is subtracted ) due to square - root singularity of the time function .",
    "this singularity is a consequence of parallel walls , or saying in dynamical terms , it is due to a family of marginally stable bouncing ball trajectories bouncing perpendicularly between the walls .    besides its interesting and rather exotic dynamical properties",
    ", the model and its generalizations may also be relevant for real world problems of transport , such as in optical fibers or wave - guides .",
