    "these techniques rely on the wave chaotic nature of most real world cavities .",
    "when a wave is broadcast into a cavity to probe it , the response signal consists of reflections that bounce from almost all parts of the cavity ; this is due to the underlying spatial ergodicity of ray trajectories in ray chaotic cavities .",

    "however , the quantification was based on an empirical law that is specific to the system and perturbation at hand .",
    "this is because the effect of the perturbation on the dynamics of the waves propagating inside the wave chaotic cavity is not straightforward @xcite . in this paper , we focus on a single class of perturbation whose effect can be theoretically predicted , and we propose two time domain techniques to measure that particular kind of perturbation in any cavity .    in this paper , we focus on quantifying volume changing perturbations ( vcp ) to a wave chaotic scattering system .",

    "the reconstructed pulse approximates the time reversed version of the original pulse broadcast into the cavity .",
    "however , if the time reversed baseline sona is broadcast into a perturbed cavity , then the reconstructed pulse will more poorly approximate the time reversed version of the original pulse .",
    "the time axis of the baseline sona needs to be scaled using the optimum factor before it is time reversed and broadcast into the perturbed cavity ; this is assuming that the perturbation is vcspp .",
    "the optimum stretching / squeezing factor is expected to result in a reconstructed pulse that best approximates the original pulse .",
    "once again , the optimum stretching / squeezing factor is expected to be @xmath3 .",

    "recently , it was proposed that time reversal mirrors could also be applied to quantum systems @xcite .",
    "the robustness of time - reversal mirrors in a scattering medium undergoing perturbations has also been studied @xcite .",
    "the cavity that is used to test the sensing techniques is an approximately @xmath22 ( i.e. dimensions of @xmath23 x @xmath23 x @xmath24 ) aluminum box that has scatterers and interior surface irregularities which facilitate the creation of ray chaotic trajectories ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : vcpfig2 ] ) .",
    "the cavity is a mixed chaotic and regular billiard system because it has parallel walls which may support integrable modes in addition to the chaotic modes .",
    "overall , the cavity represents a real world case in which the sensor would operate .",
    "there are two ports that connect the cavity to a microwave source and an oscilloscope .",
    "each port consists of a monopole antenna of length @xmath25 , and diameter @xmath26 .",
    "the monopole antennas are mounted on two different walls of the cavity .",
    "an electromagnetic pulse with a center frequency of @xmath27 , and a gaussian envelope of standard deviation @xmath6 is typically broadcast into the cavity through port 1 .",
    "the resulting sona signal is collected at port 2 by the oscilloscope , and it is digitally filtered to minimize noise .    experimentally inducing a vcspp can be more challenging than inducing a vcp , which may slightly change the shape of the enclosure .",
    "vcspps can be realized by changing the speed of wave propagation within the cavity ( i.e. changing the electrical volume ) .",
    "the speed of light ( for the electromagnetic experiment at @xmath27 ) within the cavity can be changed by filling up the cavity with different gases which have similar dissipation and dispersion properties .",

    "[ sec:3-fdtd ] , it was shown that the slightly different dissipation values of these gases does not change the sona signal in any perceivable way .",
    "however , the slightly different speed of light values of these gases was seen to significantly change the sonas collected .",
    ", width=288 ]    the experimental procedure for filling up the cavity with different gases is as follows ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : vcpfig2 ] ) .",
    "there is a gas inlet on the top wall of the cavity .",
    "the gas inlet was connected to a gas tank via a plastic tube and a long copper tube coil .",
    "the long copper tube coil allowed the gas to reach room temperature before it gets into the cavity .",
    "there was a pressure regulator in between the gas tank and the copper tube to control the rate of flow of the gas .",
    "there were three gas outlets near the top wall of the cavity , and three gas outlets near the bottom wall of the cavity .",
    "the diameter of the gas inlet and outlets was about a fifth of the wavelength , so that no significant microwave leakage occurred .",
    "depending on the density of the gas which was being pumped into the cavity , half of the outlets ( near the top or bottom wall ) were closed off with tape .",
    "this procedure helped to displace the existing gas and retain the gas being pumped into the cavity .",
    "as detailed in sec .",
    "[ sec:3-results ] , sona signals were collected from the cavity both during and after the gas transfer process .",
    "the sona signals that were collected during the gas transfer indicate when the cavity is almost fully filled with the new gas .",
    "the sona signals that were collected after the gas transfer were used to measure the vcspp that was induced .      the experiment described in sec .",
    "[ sec:3-experiment ] was modeled using a finite difference time domain ( fdtd ) code .",
    "the fdtd code solves maxwell s equations inside a 3d numerical model of the experimental cavity introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec:3-experiment ] .",
    "the code for this simulation was optimized for parallel computers and for the simulation of reverberation chambers @xcite .",
    "the fdtd simulation of the cavity enabled a direct comparison of experimental and simulation results .",
    "the fdtd simulation formed a 3d model of the experimental cavity by using spatial cubic cells with an edge length of @xmath35 , and the cavity consisted of @xmath36 cells .",
    "the smallest time step taken to propagate solutions of maxwell s equations through the cells was @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , the courant s number for computational stability was @xmath38 for all the media ( @xmath28 ) considered , where @xmath39 is the speed of light in vacuum @xcite .",
    "the model of the cavity also had two ports , with antennas that are similar to the monopoles used in the experiment .",
    "the electromagnetic pulse broadcast into the model was also similar to the one broadcast experimentally ( i.e. center frequency of @xmath27 , and width of @xmath6 ) .",
    "the maximum and minimum of the ratio of the wavelength to the cubic cell dimension were @xmath40 and @xmath41 respectively .    in the experiment ,",
    "the main source of dissipation is ohmic loss from the aluminum walls of the cavity . in the simulation ,",
    "the walls were assumed to be lossless for simplicity . instead , an equivalent loss was introduced within the medium of wave propagation to achieve the same quality factor as the experimental cavity @xcite . to accomplish this ,",
    "a uniform conductivity of @xmath42 was introduced throughout the interior of the cavity model .    as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec:3-experiment ] , the experiment relies on changing the electrical volume ( at @xmath27 ) within the cavity by changing the gases filling the cavity .",
    "the gases used were air , nitrogen gas , and helium gas . for typical laboratory atmospheric conditions , the electromagnetic loss in air at @xmath27 can be mainly attributed to oxygen molecules @xcite .",
    "the specific attenuation of oxygen is @xmath43 whereas the specific attenuation of water vapor is just @xmath44 at @xmath27 .",
    "the conductivity of air is estimated to be @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the dissipation inside the cavity filled by helium gas or nitrogen gas was roughly modeled by introducing an equivalent loss of @xmath46 uniformly throughout the cavity ( once again , the walls were assumed to be lossless in the model ) .",
    "it was shown that sonas that are collected from the cavity model with @xmath42 conductivity , and sonas that are collected from the cavity model with @xmath47 are identical ( i.e. they have a fidelity of @xmath19 ) .",
    "this simulation result proved that the difference in loss among air ( at @xmath29 relative humidity ) , nitrogen gas , and helium gas is not significant .",
    "as will be discussed later in sec .",
    "[ sec:3-results ] , the gases that experimentally filled the cavity are not pure .",
    "the effective @xmath28 of the gases that filled the cavity are different from the @xmath28 values for pure gases .",
    "the simulation of the cavity that is filled with helium , nitrogen or air is done by using the effective @xmath28 values .",
    "this allows the simulation to better model the experimental reality .",
    "the @xmath28 values used to simulate a cavity filled with air , nitrogen and helium are @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 respectively .",
    "these values were chosen to match the experimental results that will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec:3-results ] .",
    "the values were determined by anchoring the effective @xmath28 of nitrogen to the value for pure nitrogen gas , and finding the effective @xmath28 values for the other gases to match the experiment .      here , the sensitivity of the sensor is described by deriving an expression for the minimum volume changing perturbation that can be measured .",
    "then , it will be shown that the vcspp which is induced when either of the three gases in the experiment ( i.e. air , nitrogen and helium gas ) is displaced by another one , can be measured using our experimental set up .",
    "consider using the sensing technique based on scattering fidelity , which was introduced in section  [ sec:3-theory ] .",
    "the technique relies on comparing the baseline and perturbed sonas generated by a short pulse that excites many modes of the system as a function of time . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3-sensitivity ] , it is assumed that the perturbation increases the volume by a factor of @xmath4 , where @xmath8 . at time @xmath51 , the sonas are expected to be similar for small enough @xmath17 ( see eq .",

    "@xmath15 , there may be a perceptible difference between the sonas .",
    "any particular signal feature in the baseline sona at time @xmath15 is expected to be seen in the perturbed sona at time @xmath53 , where @xmath54 ; here , @xmath55 is defined as the time gap that develops between two identical features in the baseline and perturbed sona at time @xmath15 , where @xmath15 is measured within the baseline sona .",
    "this is because the baseline sona stretched out along its time axis by a factor of @xmath3 should approximate the perturbed sona , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec:3-theory ] .",
    "the minimum volume changing perturbation that can be quantified is the minimum of @xmath56 . on the other hand , when the @xmath14 of the baseline and perturbed sona is computed at any time @xmath15",
    "( see eq .",
    "[ eqn : sf ] ) , there are two necessary conditions that should be satisfied in order to be able to measure the perturbation .",
    "first , the signal - to - noise - ratio ( @xmath57 ) of the baseline sona at time @xmath15 should be well above @xmath19 .",
    "this is because the @xmath14 of the baseline and perturbed sonas ( when the @xmath57 is close to 1 ) would simply be the correlation of two noisy signals .",
    "second , @xmath55 should be , conservatively , greater than half of the period of the oscillations in the sona signals .",
    "otherwise , if @xmath55 is much smaller than half a period of the sona oscillations , the @xmath18 will not be convincingly lower than its maximum value at @xmath51 ( which is @xmath58 for the appropriate @xmath17 value in eq .",
    "[ eqn : sf ] ) , hindering reliable measurement of the perturbation .",
    "these two conditions guarantee that the @xmath18 of the baseline and perturbed sona can be used to measure the perturbation .",
    "the minimum of @xmath56 subject to these two conditions is @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the period of sona oscillations and @xmath61 is the time at which the @xmath57 of the sona approaches @xmath19",
    ".    therefore , the minimum perturbation that can be quantified by the sensor ( i.e. @xmath59 ) depends on the wavelength of the waves used to probe the cavity , the dissipation in the cavity and the @xmath57 of the system .",
    "the @xmath57 in turn depends on the noise in the system , and the dynamic range of the wave generation and detection equipment .",
    "the equipment used in this experiment are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vcpfig2 ] . for the electromagnetic experimental",
    "set up that is probing the @xmath22 cavity discussed in this work , using @xmath1 wavelength waves , a vcspp that is as small as @xmath62 parts in @xmath63 can be measured .",
    "note that it is assumed that the probing pulse excites several resonances of the baseline system as it is discussed further in sec .",
    "[ sec:3-limitationtd ] .",
    "getting back to the experimental set up shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vcpfig2 ] , the vcspp was induced by changing the gas filling the cavity from air to nitrogen gas or to helium gas .",
    "this results in @xmath64 change in the @xmath28 of the gases , which is equivalent to a vcspp of at least @xmath65 parts in @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , the experimental system is expected to detect the change in electrical volume induced when one of these gases displaces the other inside the cavity ( assuming that the gases are pure ) .        the air in the cavity at @xmath66 and @xmath29 relative humidity , was systematically displaced with nitrogen gas at room temperature .",
    "the nitrogen gas was pumped into the cavity at @xmath67 gauge pressure as the air flowed out through the gas outlets of the cavity .",
    "every two minutes , the flow was stopped , and @xmath68 nominally identical sonas ( which are actually almost identical ) were measured from the cavity , and these were averaged together .",
    "the averaging is done after aligning the sonas to eliminate the adverse effects of trigger jitter in the data acquisition system . in this manner , five",
    "averaged sonas were collected from the cavity as the cavity was filled with more and more pure nitrogen gas .",
    "each of these five sonas were compared with a sona that was collected from the original cavity filled with air .",
    "the comparison was done by computing the scattering fidelity ( see eq .",
    "[ eqn : sf ] ) of the sona from airy cavity and a sona from a partially air - filled cavity .",
    "[ fig : vcpfig3 ] shows these scattering fidelities .",

    "[ fig : vcpfig3],width=288 ]    the scattering fidelity of a vcspp shows oscillation whose period is inversely related to the strength of the perturbation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : vcpfig3 ] ) .",
    "the oscillation in the scattering fidelity can be explained by specifically examining the scattering fidelity of sona from the air filled cavity , and sona from the nitrogen gas filled cavity ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : vcpfig4](a ) ) . here ,",
    "both of the sonas were obtained by averaging over @xmath71 nominally identical sona samples . for times relatively close to @xmath51 , the difference in the speed of light between air and nitrogen",
    "does not show up when signals that traveled through these two gases are compared ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : vcpfig4](b ) ) .",
    "however , at @xmath72 , a phase shift of half a period ( i.e. @xmath73 for the probing pulse centered at @xmath27 ) develops between the two signals ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : vcpfig4](c ) ) .",
    "thus , the scattering fidelity between the two sonas becomes @xmath74 .",
    "the relative phase shift between the two sonas increases to one full period at about @xmath75 , and hence the scattering fidelity recovers to almost @xmath19 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : vcpfig4](d ) ) .",
    "however , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : vcpfig4](d ) , in addition to the phase shift that develops between the individual oscillations of the two sonas , a relative phase shift starts to develop between the envelopes of the sona signals .",
    "thus , the scattering fidelity of vcspps is not expected to oscillate between @xmath19 and @xmath20 indefinitely .",
    "rather , it is expected to decay while oscillating @xcite .",
    "however , we do not anticipate seeing this fidelity decay with our measurement system for this particular perturbation because the @xmath57 of the sonas approaches unity after about @xmath7 , and the fidelity does not decay appreciably within this time for this particular perturbation .",

    "( c ) the sonas are out of phase by half a period around @xmath76 .",

    "besides , the phase shift between the envelopes of the sonas becomes significant .",
    "[ fig : vcpfig4],width=288 ]    the speed of light at @xmath27 in pure nitrogen gas was faster than it was in the laboratory air ( which had about @xmath78 relative humidity ) .",
    "therefore , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec:3-theory ] , the vcspp can be quantified by finding the optimum stretching factor to be applied on the sona that is collected from the cavity filled with nitrogen .",
    "the goal is to recover the scattering fidelity of the stretched `` nitrogen - sona '' and the `` air - sona '' to @xmath19 .",
    "this was achieved by using a stretching factor given by @xmath79 ; because , @xmath80 ( @xmath81 half a period of oscillation of the sona ) at @xmath76 ( @xmath82 ) based on the discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec:3-sensitivity ] .",
    "the resulting scattering fidelity is plotted in red ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : vcpfig5 ] ) with the scattering fidelity of the unmodified sonas which is shown in blue .",
    "the optimum stretching factor is @xmath83 . whereas , @xmath84 is the expected value of @xmath3 . in other words , ideally a @xmath85 ( parts per million )",
    "change across each electrical dimensions of the cavity is expected , however , an @xmath86 change is measured .",
    "the discrepancy can be explained by the fact that the nitrogen gas that filled the cavity has an effective @xmath28 that is probably much closer to the effective @xmath28 of air .",
    "[ fig : vcpfig3 ] shows that it can take several minutes to displace the air in the cavity with pure nitrogen .",
    "therefore , we do not expect the @xmath28 of the nitrogen gas that filled the cavity to be the same as the literature value for pure nitrogen gas .",
    "the same conclusion applies to the other gases filling the cavity .",
    "there are several reasons for the expected discrepancy between the literature value of @xmath28 and the effective @xmath28 of the gases filling the cavity experimentally .",
    "the helium and nitrogen gases are of industrial quality , which is not perfectly pure . besides",
    ", the cavity is not necessarily air tight ; this could lead to leakage of air into the cavity when the cavity is not pressurized . finally , the @xmath28 of the gases is a function of temperature and relative humidity ( for the case of air ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , deviations of laboratory temperature and relative humidity from @xmath33 and @xmath78 could impact the effective @xmath28 value of the gases .",
    "the fact that the shape of the cavity was preserved ( during the displacement of the air by nitrogen gas ) can also be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : vcpfig5 ] .",
    "if the shape of the cavity were not preserved , it would not be possible to recover the scattering fidelity of the two sonas through simple numerical stretching of one of the sonas , along the time axis .",
    "hence , displacing air with nitrogen gas is not just a vcp , but is also a vcspp .",
    "later , a vcp induced by displacement of air with helium , which is not vcspp , will be discussed .     throughout the times when the @xmath57 of the sonas is robust .",
