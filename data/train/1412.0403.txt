    "the study on the change in structural properties of foreign atoms or ions in different external environment [ 1 - 14 ] is a subject matter of immense interest in the last few decades as it provides deep insight to several interesting phenomenon in astrophysics and plasma physics .",
    "there exists a bulk of studies detailed in sil _ et .",
    "[ 15 ] , on the behavioral changes in the structural properties of few - body systems embedded in external plasma environment , useful for laboratory and astrophysical plasma diagnostics determination .",
    "the most important part of such studies is to model the environment by an effective potential so that one can suppose as if the foreign atom / ion or the test charge will feel that effective potential while placed in or moving through that medium .",
    "it is well - known according to the debye - huckel theory [ 16 , 17 ] of weak electrolyte that an static atom / ion feel screened coulomb type potential while placed in a collision - less high temperature classical plasma .",
    "the screening parameter in this case is a function of electron number density ( @xmath0 ) and temperature ( @xmath1 ) of the plasma and thus different plasma situations can be simulated by suitably tuning the screening parameter [ 4 ] .",
    "in contrast , when the temperature ( @xmath1 ) of the plasma electrons approaches to the `` _ _ fermi - temperature _ _ '' @xmath2 [ @xmath3 being the `` _ _ fermi - energy _ _ '' of the electrons and @xmath4 is the boltzmann constant ] , the equilibrium plasma electron distribution function changes from maxwell - boltzmann to fermi - dirac distribution . under such condition , the quantum degeneracy effects start playing a significant role as the thermal de - broglie wavelength for the plasma electrons becomes comparable or equal to that of average inter - electronic distance [ 18 ] . quantum plasma s",
    "are generally made of electrons and ions or holes .",
    "the studies on quantum plasma got importance in several branches of applied physics specially in nano - science [ 19 - 21 ] as well as in laboratory plasma experiments [ 22 - 25 ] and in astrophysical scenario [ 26 - 28 ] .",
    "+ pine [ 29 ] have treated an arbitrary collision - less quantum plasma environment as a dielectric medium and derived the analytic form of dielectric function using random phase approximation ( rpa ) method .",
    "using such dielectric function , sukla _ et .",
    "[ 30 ] showed that the effective potential felt by a slowly moving test charge has two component : the usual near field debye - huckel screening term and far - field wake potential .",
    "far field wake potential decays as the inverse cube of the distance between the origin of the test charge and the location of the observer .",
    "it is interesting to note that for far field , the effective potential of a moving `` _ _ test charge _ _ '' in an isotropic collision - less classical plasma also falls off as the inverse cube of the distance of the observer from the test charge [ 31 ] .",
    "the effect of far field wake potential is very small on the binding energy of atom .",
    "thus it is very much important to study devoted to the effect of near field wake potential on the binding energy of atom / ion .",
    "the only attempt in this context was made by hu _",
    "[ 32 ] . they [ 32 ] have found that the near field wake potential is proportional to @xmath5 and @xmath6 ; @xmath7 being the radial distance between the moving ion and the observer while @xmath8 is the angle between the radial vector and velocity vector of the ion .",
    "they [ 32 ] have used meijer s g function in deriving the analytic form of the near field wake potential , where this g function violets the condition used in its definition [ 33 ] .",
    "this results in some anomalous findings in binding energy calculations _",
    "e.g. _ variationally over - bound energy levels _",
    "_ the energy levels of the free atom and the removal of degeneracy of the energy levels _ w.r.t .",
    "_ the magnetic quantum number ` @xmath9 ' .",
    "even if we assume that their form of the potential to be correct , the energy levels should be stark - like shifted due to ` @xmath6 ' term in the potential and due to obvious reason there is no possibility of getting zeeman - like splitting without any perturbation _ e.g. _ magnetic field which breaks the azimuthal symmetry of the the system .",
    "+ to examine the influence of near field wake potential on the structural properties of moving atom / ion in quantum plasma , the analytic form of the potential has been derived in the present work using correct form of meijer s g function [ 33 ] and its identities .",
    "the present derived potential is proportional to @xmath10 [ @xmath11 being the zeroth order mac - donald function or modified bessel s function of second kind [ 34 ] and @xmath12 is the debye parameter ] and @xmath6 .",
    "subsequently we have applied rayleigh - ritz variation method to obtain the binding energies of all states lying between @xmath13 and @xmath14 configuration of hydrogen - like carbon ion moving through electron - hole - droplet ( ehd ) quantum plasma .",
    "in contrast to the findings of hu _ et .",
    "[ 32 ] , no overbound result has been observed .",
    "moreover the splitting of energy levels _ w.r.t . _",
    "@xmath15 , has been observed which is purely stark - like shifting due to oscillatory term in the potential .",

    "the energy eigenvalues of free ions are given in the first row of each table .",
    "from the numbers quoted in the tables 2 - 5 , it is to be noted that as the plasma density ( @xmath0 ) increases for a given ion velocity ( @xmath50 ) , the energy eigenvalues become more and more positive leading towards destabilization of the ion while as the ion velocity increases for a given plasma density ( @xmath0 ) , the energy eigenvalue becomes more and more positive but with a much slower rate compared to the preceding one .",
    "thus it can be argued that the effect of static screening ( depends only on @xmath0 ) of the plasma environment on the energy eigenvalue is much more pronounced compared to the wake field , where the later arises due to the velocity ( @xmath50 ) of the ion and also depends on plasma electron density ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "in contrast ,",
    "_ [ 32 ] showed that the energy of each state considered here becomes over - bound ( _ i.e. _ more negative than the energy of the free ion ) when the ion velocity ( @xmath50 ) reaches a sufficiently high value .",

    "al . _ [ 32 ] reported that for @xmath162 m@xmath163 and ion velocity @xmath50 = 5000 m / s , the ground state ( @xmath102 ) energy of c@xmath25 becomes -25.60524 a.u . which is more negative than the ground state energy -18.0 a.u .",
    "for the free c@xmath25 ion . in this regard ,",
    "[ 32 ] opined that such over - boundness occurred because of the choice of angular part of the wave function .",
    "but the angular part of the wavefunction can not be responsible for such over - boundness as it violets the basic variational principle .",
    "the error lies in the deduction of the form of the near - field wake potential .",
    "moreover , the -_ve _ sign for the near - field wake potential as obtained by hu _ et .",
    "[ 32 ] is not correct .",
    "no such over - boundness are being observed in the present calculations , _",
    "e.g. _ , we have obtained the ground state ( @xmath102 ) energy of -17.33679 a.u . for c@xmath25 ion , where @xmath162 m@xmath163 and @xmath50 = 5000 m / s .",
    "+ it can also be noted from the tables 3 - 5 that the usual breaking of accidental degeneracy ( _ i.e. _ @xmath164 degeneracy corresponding to a given @xmath165 ) occurs _",
    "_ the plasma electron density ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "this is a well - known phenomenon in presence of debye - huckel potential and can be found in different studies [ 15 ] .",

    "i.e. _ @xmath166 is being removed for each ion velocity ( @xmath50 ) because of the presence of @xmath6 term in the near - field wake potential as seen in the tables 3 - 5 .",
    "for example , table-3 shows that for ion velocity ( @xmath50 ) @xmath129 c.m./sec . and plasma electron density ( @xmath0 ) @xmath128/c.c .",
    ", the energy eigenvalues of @xmath167 and @xmath24 states are @xmath168 a.u . and @xmath169 a.u .",
    "this is purely stark - like splitting .",
    "in contrast ,",
    "[ 32 ] reported the lifting of degeneracy of the energy levels _",
    "w.r.t _ magnetic quantum no . ` @xmath9 ' _ i.e. _ zemman - like splitting .",
    "the error lies in the calculation of the matrix element of kinetic energy as given in the expression of @xmath170 of appendix - b of ref-[32 ] . in deriving @xmath170 , hu _ et .",
    "[ 32 ] used the condition that the magnetic quantum number _",
    "m _ must be non - negative while in the numerical calculation of the energy eigenvalue they have used -_ve _ values of _",
    "m_. + the variation of energies of ( @xmath167 , @xmath24),(@xmath171 , @xmath26 ) , ( @xmath172 , @xmath55 ) , ( @xmath173,@xmath56,@xmath57 ) , ( @xmath174,@xmath154,@xmath155 ) and ( @xmath175,@xmath156,@xmath157,@xmath103 ) states with ion velocity ( @xmath50 ) for four different plasma densities ( @xmath0 ) are depicted in figure 1 - 6 respectively .",
    "it is evident from figures 1 - 3 that corresponding to plasma density ( @xmath0 ) @xmath128/c.c , @xmath140 states energetically lies below @xmath139 state for the entire range of ion velocity ( @xmath50 ) and thus no crossing of energy levels are being observed .",
    "but for other three densities higher than the previous one , it is to be noted that , for low ion velocity @xmath139 state energetically lies below than that of @xmath140 state while after a critical ion velocity @xmath140 state becomes more negative than that of @xmath139 state .",
    "hence , incidental degeneracy of @xmath139 and @xmath140 states occurs at the critical ion velocity .",
    "such crossing of energy levels and subsequent appearance of incidental degeneracy occur for all other angular momentum states ( _ i.e. _ _ d _ , _ f _ ) as given in figures 4 - 6 .",
    "such incidental degeneracy was reported earlier by sen [ 42 ] in case of shell confined hydrogen atom .",
    "thus the figures 1 - 6 give a good insight on the combined effect of static screening and near field wake potential on different angular momentum states of a slowly moving ion in quantum plasma .",
    "the electrostatic potential for a moving ion under quantum plasma are being derived where the thermal mac number remains below unity .",
    "subsequently , the effect of such potential on the change of the energy eigenvalues of different states of hydrogen - like carbon ion are being studied under the framework of rayleigh - ritz variational method .",
    "level crossing phenomenon and incidental degeneracy are being observed for the first time in case of ion moving in the quantum plasma environment .",
    "the present form of the potential will help future workers to investigate the structural properties of different ions under quantum plasma environment .",
