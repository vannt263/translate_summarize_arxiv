    "the swift gamma - ray burst explorer ( gehrels et al .",
    "2004 ) was successfully launched on 2004 november 20 .",
    "thanks to its fast - pointing capabilities , swift is performing the first comprehensive observations of the early afterglow phase of gamma  ray bursts ( grb ) .",
    "a few grbs have been followed by swift within 200 s from their trigger time : grb050117a ( 193 s ) , grb050126 ( 131 s ) , grb050128 ( 108 s ) , grb050215b ( 108 s ) , grb050219a ( 92 s ) and grb050315 ( 83 s ) .    in this paper",
    "we focus on grb050128 .",
    "the burst alert telescope ( bat ; barthelmy et al . 2005 ) on board swift triggered and located grb050128 at 04:19:54 ut ( cummings et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the burst profile is multi - peaked with a @xmath3 duration of 13.8 s. the fluence is @xmath4 erg @xmath5 ( 15350 kev ) making it a ` normal ' burst with respect to the batse grb population .",
    "the spectrum of the burst during the @xmath3 interval can be described by a power law model with photon index @xmath6 ( 15350 kev ) .",
    "the peak energy is above 350 kev making it a classical grb .",
    "swift pointed autonomously to the grb .",
    "we will report in the next sections about the xrt and uvot observations .",
    "ground - based follow - up observations started as soon as the gcn circular announcing the discovery of the new grb was issued .",
    "this happened with some delay , since swift was in the early phases of the mission and each circular was being checked manually before being distributed .",
    "the first gcn circular on grb050128 was issued by the xrt team ( antonelli et al .",
    "2005 ) . the robotic 60-cm rem telescope located in la silla pointed to grb050128 approximately 3 hr after the burst with good seeing conditions ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "no new sources were discovered with an upper limit of @xmath8 ( covino et al .",
    "2005 ) , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( melandri et al . 2005 ) .",
    "a further upper limit came from the 2-m faulkes telescope south with @xmath12 11.5 hr after the burst ( monfardini et al .",
    "grb050128 has also been observed in the radio band at 8.4 ghz yielding an upper limit of 100 @xmath13jy @xmath14 d after the burst ( frail & soderberg 2005 ) .    in the following we focus on the observations by the x  ray telescope ( xrt ,",
    "burrows et al .",
    "2005a ) on board swift . in section 2",
    "we describe the data analysis . in section 3",
    "we discuss on theoretical implications of these observations and in section 4 we draw our conclusions .",
    "uvot ( roming et al . 2005 ) observations started on jan 28 , 2005 at 20:03:07 ut , about 15.8 hours after the burst .",
    "this delay happened because uvot was in safe mode at the trigger time . during each orbit",
    "uvot acquired a single shot image in each filter @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 in imaging mode .",
    "uvot did not detect the afterglow .",
    "upper limits on the first ( summed over about 1 d elapsed time ) uvot observations are @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) , @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) and @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "xrt observed grb050128 after an automatic slew of the swift satellite .",
    "however , xrt was not yet operating in its nominal automatic mode changing configuration but rather in a manual mode for the purpose of obtaining calibration data . before pointing to grb050128 , the xrt was observing a uvot calibration target in photon counting mode ( see hill et al .",
    "2004 for a description of xrt observing modes ) .",
    "xrt fully settled on the bat position 108 s after the trigger .",
    "xrt observed grb050128 for 17 orbits following the first pointing , accumulating a nominal exposure time of 17303 s ( distributed over 73 ks ) .",
    "this low earth orbit of swift causes source observations to be interrupted each orbit . at the same time , thanks to the fast - pointing capability of swift , several targets may be observed per orbit . at this early stage of the mission",
    "the analysis of the data is not straightforward .",
    "we analysed the data running the task xrtpipeline within ftools v5.3.1 and cutting out temporal intervals when the ccd temperature was higher than @xmath24 celsius ( see burrows et al .",
    "2005b ) and when the total count rate in the 0.210 kev energy band over the entire ccd was larger than 85 c s@xmath25 ( these counts are mainly soft counts and are due either to dark current or to the bright earth limb near the end of each snapshot observation ) . with these cuts",
    "we obtain a total exposure time of 13047 s distributed over 11 orbits .",
    "a fading source is clearly evident in all the xrt orbits . in the first two orbits the source is clearly piled - up and to derive an unbiased position we rely on the remaining @xmath26 ks exposure .",
    "an image has been extracted in the 0.510 kev energy band to avoid contamination from low energy photons .",
    "the source position has been derived with ximage ( v4.2.1 ) using the centroid command : ra(j2000 ) : 14h38m18s.0 , dec(j2000 ) : -34@xmath27@xmath28@xmath29.9 .",
    "the main contributors to the positional uncertainty are the uncalibrated satellite attitude and boresight , resulting in a @xmath30 error radius ( @xmath31 confidence level ) .      in order to properly track the decay of the fading source we have to account for the piled - up core in the first two snapshot observations . to this aim we extracted photons from an annular region ( inner and outer radii 4 and 30 pixels , respectively ) on source .",
    "this aperture was then applied to the rest of the observations , even when it was not needed .",
    "the light curve will have an underestimated normalization but it will not be distorted by pile - up . a background light curve has also been extracted from an annular region ( inner and outer radii 80 and 120 pixels , respectively ) centered on the same position and free of other sources and hot pixels .",
    "1 shows the background - subtracted light curve in the 0.210 kev energy band",
    ". the source is clearly fading .",
    "the decay light curve is not consistent with a single power law ( @xmath32 , with 35 degrees of freedom , dof , null hypothesis probability , nhp , @xmath33 ) , being flat at the beginning and steepening at later times .",
    "we also tried a single power law with a different initial time @xmath34 , considered here as a free parameter .",
    "we can account in principle for the observed decay with @xmath35 s , however this early time is not physically meaningful .",
    "a better description of the data is provided by two power laws ( with indices @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) smoothly joined at a break time @xmath38 to model the decay .",
    "the fit with this model is good ( @xmath39 with 33 dof , @xmath40 nhp ) and @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 s ( these errors are @xmath31 for one interesting parameter , i.e. @xmath44 , throughout the letter ) .      given the large variability in the source count rate and the knowledge from the temporal analysis of the existence of a change in the decay slope , we extracted three spectra from our data , one from each of the first two snapshots and one for the rest of the observation ( see fig .",
    "the first two spectra were extracted from the same annular region as for the temporal analysis .",
    "the last spectrum , since the source is much fainter , was extracted from a circular region on source of 30 pixel radius .",
    "exposure times are 286 , 1653 and 10731 s , respectively .",
    "data have been filtered for grades 04 ( according to the xmm - newton nomenclature , i.e. single and double pixel events ) , since at this stage the response matrix for the standard 012 pixel event is not fully calibrated .",
    "ancillary response files were generated with the task xrtmkarf within ftools ( v5.3.1 ) , accounting for the different extraction regions .",
    "data were rebinned to have at least 20 counts per energy bin and allow @xmath45 fitting within xspec ( v11.3.1 ) .",
    "we fit the data with an absorbed power law model for all the observations .",
    "we first fixed the absorbing column density to the galactic value of @xmath46 .",
    "we added a @xmath47 systematic uncertainty to all our fits to account for the residuals still present in our response matrix ( given the relatively low number of counts this does not alter our results sensibly ) .",
    "this simple fit can account for the observed spectra .",
    "the fit is good with @xmath48 for 63 dof ( @xmath49 nhp ) .",
    "the power law photon index is @xmath50 .",
    "the 0.210 kev unabsorbed fluxes of the three observations with mid times of 258 s , 6156 s and 51587 s are @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "given the slope change in the light curve we also untie the power law photon index of the three observations ( even if it is not required by the statistics ) .",
    "the three photon indices are @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "these values are consistent with each other with a small deviation in the second snapshot .",
    "although the fit is consistent with the galactic column density , we let the column density value free to vary .",
    "the fit is improved with a @xmath57 ( 62 dof , @xmath58 nhp , see fig .",
    "2 ) and the improvement is significant according to the f - test ( probability @xmath59 , even if we improved an already statistically good fit ) . in fig .",
    "3 , we show the contour plot of the column density vs. power law photon index .",
    "the fit obtained with the column density fixed to the galactic value is outside the @xmath60 boundary .",
    "the absorbing column density is @xmath61 and the power law photon index @xmath62 .",
    "unabsorbed fluxes ( 0.210 kev ) are @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively . also in this case , leaving free the photon index to vary within the observations the second one is characterized by a slightly steeper index .",
    "the major result on the grb050128 afterglow concerns the monitoring in the x  ray band of its early temporal decay . this decay can not be described by a simple power law but can be accounted for by a slowly varying double power law decay . during this transition",
    "there are no apparent marked spectral changes .",
    "the most straightforward interpretation is that the temporal break reveals a jet , i.e. corresponding to the epoch when the relativistic beaming angle ( @xmath66 ) becomes larger than the physical opening angle ( @xmath67 ) of the jet during the fireball deceleration ( e.g. rhoads 1999 ) . in the slow cooling regime , for a uniform density circumstellar",
    "medium , the temporal decay changes from @xmath68 to @xmath69 ( e.g. rhoads 1999 ) , which is well consistent with the observed temporal decay indices when @xmath70 is adopted .",
    "in such a case no spectral change is expected .",
    "however , the expected spectral photon index should be @xmath71 , too small to be compared with the observed value . in order to make the jet model work",
    ", one needs to assume @xmath72 before the jet break , and @xmath73 after the jet break ( here @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the typical synchrotron frequency and the cooling frequency , respectively ) .",
    "in such a case , @xmath70 gives a consistent interpretation of both spectral and temporal indices in all three epochs , regardless of whether the medium is an interstellar medium ( ism ) or a wind from a massive companion .",
    "this model requires a little bit of coincidence in that the synchrotron frequency happens to cross the x  ray band during the jet break .",
    "however , considering the rapid decline with time of @xmath74 this is not a very unlikely possibility .",
    "another caveat is that a flat electron spectrum @xmath70 is abnormal in late afterglow fits ( e.g. panaitescu & kumar 2001 ) .",
    "however , since we are observing a previously unexplored early epoch , a small @xmath76 required for the jet model to work can not be ruled out .",
    "possible ways to generate a flat electron spectrum have been suggested earlier ( e.g. bykov & mszros 1996 ) .",
    "if this is indeed a jet break , this would be the earliest jet break detection so far . using the standard definition of jet break time ( i.e. @xmath77 ) one can derive @xmath78^{-3/8}$ ] for a constant density interstellar medium and @xmath79^{-1/4}$ ] for a wind model . here",
    "@xmath80 is the density of the ism , @xmath81 is the isotropic - equivalent burst energy in units of @xmath82 erg and @xmath83 is the wind parameter , with @xmath84 being the mass loss rate , @xmath85 being the wind velocity , and @xmath86 g cm@xmath25 ) .",
    "these jets are not extremely narrow ( e.g. covino et al .",
    "2003 ) but are narrower than the typical jets identified in the previous late afterglow observations ( e.g. table 2 of bloom et al .",
    "according to the grb standard energy argument ( e.g. frail et al .",
    "2001 ; panaitescu & kumar 2001 ) , such a narrow jet should correspond to large isotropic gamma - ray energy . since this burst was not particularly bright , it might lie in the low energy tail of grb - energy distribution , thus being another outlier for the standard energy relation .    besides the jet interpretation",
    ", one could search for other possible solutions by considering the temporal and spectral relations in various afterglow models ( e.g. mszros , rees & wijers 1998 ; sari , piran & narayan 1998 ; chevalier & li 2000 ; zhang & mszros 2004 ) .",
    "the most straightforward model is within the framework of the standard isotropic wind model ( chevalier & li 2000 ) .",
    "the first cluster of the data corresponds to the @xmath88 regime , in which the temporal index @xmath89 and the photon spectral index @xmath90 are expected .",
    "the second and the third clusters of the data correspond to the regime of @xmath91 , in which the temporal index @xmath92 and the photon spectral index @xmath93 are expected . all these are consistent with the data for @xmath94 . in this interpretation , one needs to assume that both @xmath74 and @xmath75 cross the x  ray band during the gap between the first two clusters of data and that the frequencies switch the order .",
    "this could be achieved with a small wind parameter ( e.g. @xmath95 in the range of @xmath96 ) .",
    "one caveat is that in the wind model @xmath97 , so that the time interval of the gap is not long enough for @xmath75 to completely cross the band . nonetheless , the spectral slope in the second cluster is slightly steeper than the other two , which might be still consistent with the data if one introduces an evolving cooling break near the high energy edge of the band during the epoch of the second snapshot . introducing a slightly steeper density profile ( larger than @xmath98 for the wind case )",
    "could further alleviate the problem .",
    "furthermore , if the electron equipartition factor @xmath99 drops during the temporal gap , this would speed up the @xmath75 crossing time scale , making the model more consistent with the data .    finally , we note also that a similar behaviour has been observed in optical light curve grb021004 even if with a slightly longer break time ( @xmath100 d , fox et al .",
    ". this transition has been interpreted by li & chevalier ( 2003 ) as a fast to slow cooling transition .",
    "swift is exploring for the first time the early stages of grb afterglow decays .",
    "we detect a clear early temporal break in the x  ray afterglow of grb050128 , with the spectral indices not changing around the break .",
    "the data could be argued to be consistent with either a jet model or a wind model .",
    "the jet model requires a flat electron spectrum and an assumed spectral domain change within the temporal gap between the first two snap shot observations .",
    "if this is true , we may have detected the earliest jet break so far .",
    "the wind model requires a ( relatively ) low ambient density and possibly an evolution of the @xmath99 parameter .",
    "we note that in this last case , passages from fast to slow cooling regimes might have remained hidden in the great majority of grb afterglows if they are characterized by such a tenuous environment , due to the late times at which they were observed .",
    "the early detection of the x  ray afterglow , coupled with the initial flat decay , allows us to estimate its fluence @xmath101 .",
    "in fact , given the value of @xmath36 and @xmath37 , @xmath102 is not very sensitive to the start time @xmath34 of the afterglow and is dominated by the flux at the break time @xmath38 .",
    "the fluence between 108 s and 73000  s is @xmath103 erg @xmath104 ( 15350 kev ) , while extrapolating from @xmath105 to @xmath106 it is @xmath107 erg @xmath104 .",
    "these values amount to @xmath108 and @xmath109 of the prompt fluence in the same energy band .",
    "since prompt and afterglow spectra are similar we might expect a relatively small difference in the bolometric correction .",
    "this is the first determination of the ratio between grb proper and early afterglow energetics .",
