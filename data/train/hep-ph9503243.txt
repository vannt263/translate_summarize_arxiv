    "cern intends to increase the energy of its electron - positron collider lep so that @xmath0-pairs can be produced .",
    "the upgraded lep 2 should demonstrate directly the presence of the non - abelian gauge coupling of the @xmath3 to @xmath4 .",
    "it should also show the effects of the magnetic moment and the quadrupole moment of the @xmath5at tree - level , these quantities are predicted by the standard electroweak model without any assumptions on its higgs content but have not yet been measured directly .",
    "the energy of lep 2 may eventually be increased to allow the production of @xmath3-pairs in addition to @xmath0-pairs .",
    "many authors including ourselves have considered alternatives to the standard electroweak model in which additional self - couplings of the gauge particles can occur @xcite .",
    "these new anomalous couplings are often present in the standard model as small radiative corrections , but in alternative models it is commonly speculated that they may be large .",
    "for example , the @xmath3 should couple to an electromagnetic field through a @xmath6- and @xmath7-violating , but @xmath8-conserving , anapole moment of order @xmath9 in the standard model@xcite , but in a composite model this anapole moment may be large , that is to say of order unity @xcite .",
    "similarly , the @xmath0 has an electric dipole moment ( edm ) of order less than 10@xmath10 @xmath11 in the standard model is known to vanish even at the two - loop order@xcite .",
    "the bound we quote is from an estimate given in reference @xcite . ] in the minimal standard model , but in alternative models it may be much larger and if so , this edm may even be the source of the @xmath8-violation observed in the @xmath12 system .",
    "nevertheless , even if such anomalous couplings exist , they are not expected to have any appreciable consequences in measurements at current lep energies .",
    "an important aim of lep 2 is to search for the presence of these anomalous couplings ( and other variations from the predictions of the standard model ) in addition to its primary purpose of demonstrating the @xmath13 non - abelian coupling and the magnetic and quadrupole moments of the @xmath0 .    in this note",
    "we consider the general form of the three vector boson coupling which gives in particular the electromagnetic structure of the @xmath0 and the @xmath14 .",
    "this allows us to formulate threshold theorems for all the gauge boson pair production processes . in the next section",
    "we show that a threshold theorem exists for @xmath15 which picks out one particular anomalous coupling . in section 3",
    "we discuss @xmath16 which is especially simple to analyse on account of the majorana ( self - dual ) nature of the @xmath3 .",
    "this property severely limits the form of the @xmath1 ( or @xmath17 ) interaction and gives a very clean threshold theorem . in section 4",
    "we discuss @xmath18 , which satisfies a threshold theorem but at lep , not lep 2 energies .",
    "it is therefore especially important to study this process at lep 2 since the constraints of the threshold theorem no longer apply .",
    "the general form of the electromagnetic coupling of a spin - one particle of mass @xmath20 can be written in the form @xcite",
    "@xmath21    @xmath22    @xmath23    here , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the momenta of the @xmath26 and @xmath27 and @xmath28 = @xmath24 + @xmath25 is the virtual photon momentum .",
    "the @xmath0 is taken to be on - shell so @xmath29 .",
    "since the electromagnetic current is conserved we have @xmath30    no symmetry other than electromagnetic current conservation and lorentz invariance is assumed in this decomposition .",
    "if we now consider the process @xmath31e@xmath32 through the virtual photon exchange term of figure 1 , we can ignore all terms in eq .",
    "( 1 ) proportional to @xmath33 since the electromagnetic current of the electron is also conserved .",
    "hence we obtain the form of the coupling written down by hagiwara et al.@xcite @xmath34    @xmath35    @xmath36    the seven form factors @xmath37 are functions only of @xmath38:@xmath39 and @xmath40 determine the electromagnetic charge , magnetic moment and quadrupole moment of the @xmath0 and conserve @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath41 ; @xmath42 and @xmath43 violate @xmath7 and @xmath41 but conserve @xmath6 and hence can lead to an electric dipole moment of the @xmath0 , while @xmath44 conserves @xmath7 but violates @xmath6 and @xmath41.the anapole @xmath45 conserves @xmath41 but violates @xmath6 and @xmath7 . by comparing equations ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) we obtain the constraints @xmath46 imposed by current conservation .    in @xmath0-pair production at lep 2 the amplitude to first order in @xmath47",
    "is given by the born approximation , that is the neutrino exchange term ( figure 2 ) which is non - zero at threshold , the virtual photon exchange term of figure 1 , together with a corresponding term in which the virtual photon is replaced by a virtual @xmath3 .",
    "the we@xmath48 coupling is known from @xmath49-decay and @xmath50-decay .",
    "the description of virtual @xmath3-exchange is almost identical to that of virtual photon exchange .",
    "we now take the @xmath51 coupling ( or weak vertex function of the @xmath0 ) to be given by @xmath52 instead of @xmath53 and we can break up @xmath52 into its transverse and longitudinal parts    @xmath54    where @xmath55 includes all terms proportional to @xmath56 .  provided that we take @xmath57 , the weak neutral current of the electron- positron system which couples to the @xmath3 is conserved .",
    "this ensures that the longitudinal part , @xmath55 , does not contribute to the amplitude .",
    "so we can take the @xmath51 coupling to be given by @xmath58 and this can be decomposed in exactly the same form as the electromagnetic vertex @xmath59 in eq . 1 provided we simply replace the form factors @xmath37 by the corresponding form factors @xmath60 .",
    "we can also neglect higgs exchange in the @xmath57 limit .    at threshold @xmath61 in the centre of mass frame and hence @xmath62 @xmath63 and @xmath43",
    "do not contribute to the virtual photon exchange diagram .",
    "furthermore in this frame @xmath28 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are purely timelike while the polarization vectors @xmath64 and @xmath65 of @xmath26 and @xmath66 are purely spacelike .",
    "hence when contracted with @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath44 are coefficients of @xmath70 and @xmath71 both of which vanish .",
    "so only the cp - violating term @xmath72 persists at threshold . for @xmath3-exchange",
    "a similar argument gives @xmath73 as the sole contribution .",
    "so we end up with the threshold theorem for @xmath0-pair production at threshold    @xmath74\\ ] ]    where we define @xmath75    note that the interference term between the cp violating @xmath3 and photon exchange diagrams is suppressed .",
    "as expected the leading order terms in @xmath76 ( the neutrino exchange t - channel and cp violating s - channel ) give an isotropic angular distribution .",
    "the next order term in @xmath50 is solely from the t - channel and leads to an asymmetry that vanishes upon integration .",
    "the corollary of this result is that if the electric dipole moment @xmath42 ( and any associated weak dipole moment @xmath73 ) of @xmath0 is too small to be measurable , then the standard model dominates in @xmath0-pair production near threshold as the other @xmath77 and @xmath13 couplings all enter into the cross - section with factors of at least @xmath50 , where @xmath50 is the velocity of the @xmath0 .",
    "this result just follows from kinematics together with electromagnetic ( and weak ) current conservation , just as it does in classic low energy theorems.@xcite it requires no assumptions on the underlying gauge structure of the theory .",
    "furthermore as the we@xmath48 coupling is taken from its value as observed in @xmath50-decay the born approximation includes the radiative corrections associated with the running of the fine structure constant .",
    "it can be expected that an electric dipole moment @xmath42 ( and any associated weak dipole moment @xmath73 ) of the @xmath0 would contribute to the neutron electric dipole moment .",
    "the experimental limits on the neutron edm allow bounds to be set on the @xmath0 edm .",
    "these bounds , however , are not rigorous @xcite and lep 2 can be expected to provide a more substantive result .    in this discussion",
    "we have not considered the radiative corrections to the process , in particular the initial state radiation effects which give the dominant contribution ( see the treatment by bardin et al @xcite and berends , pittau and kleiss @xcite ) . nor have we considered the finite width effects which can be substantial in the threshold region .",
    "these may be treated according to the prescription of fadin , khoze and martin.@xcite",
    "extensive studies have been devoted to anomalous @xmath77 and @xmath13 couplings but rather less attention has been focussed on the anomalous @xmath79 and @xmath17 couplings",
    ". there may be three reasons for this : ( a ) within standard electroweak theory the @xmath80 cross section is an order of magnitude larger than the @xmath81 cross section ; ( b ) at lep 2 there is not expected to be sufficient energy initially to produce @xmath3-pairs and ( c ) @xmath13 and @xmath77 couplings appear at tree level in standard electroweak theory @xmath1 and @xmath17 couplings are absent .",
    "nevertheless , from the purely phenomenological point of view that we have adopted here the @xmath1 and @xmath17 coupling are particularly easy to analyse .",
    "this is because the @xmath3 is a majorana particle@xcite ( i.e. it is its own antiparticle ) and hence , using the same notation that we used in the previous section , the @xmath1 on - shell coupling must be symmetric under interchange of the two @xmath3s ; that is to say that    @xmath82    by inspection it is easily seen that only the anapole couplings @xmath83 and @xmath84 satisfy this criterion . imposing cp conservation only @xmath84 survives .",
    "likewise , for @xmath17 coupling , the corresponding weak anapole moment @xmath85 is the only term , provided that the first two @xmath3s are on - shell and the third off - shell .",
    "so the threshold theorem for @xmath3-pair production follows simply : the cross - section at threshold is given by the standard model since the @xmath3 can not possess an electric dipole moment . at higher energies the anapole term which is pure @xmath7 wave with a ( 1+@xmath86 ) angular distribution should play a role .",
    "note that whereas in @xmath0-pair production above threshold up to six anomalous couplings may be present outside the threshold region , in @xmath3-pair production there is only the anapole .",
    "the anapole couples a longitudinal @xmath3 to a transverse @xmath3 , so the signal for the presence of the anapole would arise in the @xmath87 cross - section .",
    "the unique cp conserving @xmath1 operator which contributes to @xmath81 production is given by @xmath88    in momentum space this operator is proportional to the invariant mass @xmath38 of the photon ( see eq .",
    "1 ) which means that in @xmath89 processes this leads to a contact interaction@xcite .",
    "the @xmath17 vertex on account of bose symmetry is of the same lorentz structure as the anapole with the @xmath90 term replaced by @xmath91 : again it also leads to a contact interaction . for these reasons",
    "unless the initial beams are polarised we can not distinguish between a @xmath17 and @xmath1 anomalous coupling in @xmath81 production .",
    "for illustration we show the contribution of the electromagnetic operator to the differential @xmath81 cross section    @xmath92    where @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 the quantities @xmath96    and @xmath97    will occur in @xmath18 .",
    "note that the anomalous term is strongly suppressed by a function @xmath98 compared to the standard model terms where @xmath50 is the @xmath3 velocity .",
    "so energies well above the planned lep 2 energies would be necessary to investigate this coupling .",
    "nevertheless it is perhaps worth noting that at a future electron - positron collider of energy 500gev or more , it should be relatively easy to disentangle the standard model terms from the anomalous anapole term .",
    "this would be accomplished by a cut in scattering angle about the forward direction which would severely restrict those events arisng from the standard model while hardly affecting the anomalous terms .",
    "we showed some years ago @xcite ( see also @xcite ) that the threshold amplitude for @xmath18 was determined by the @xmath99 coupling constant including one - loop radiative corrections .",
    "this is simply a statement that the threshold energy for this process is the @xmath3 mass and therefore soft - photons have to be treated according to quantum electrodynamics in the usual way .",
    "so near threshold , the standard model term for this process which correctly contains the threshold amplitude must dominate over all anomalous terms .",
    "the @xmath3-exchange diagram for the process @xmath18 where one @xmath3 is on - shell and one is off - shell and the photon is real , involves a coupling of electric dipole transition type that vanishes when both @xmath3 s become real .",
    "the cp conserving operator that parametrizes this transition can be written as    @xmath100    where @xmath101 is the electromagnetic tensor , @xmath102 is the scale associated to this operator and @xmath103 characterises the strength of the ( edt ) coupling .",
    "it is useful to introduce the dimensionless parameter @xmath104 + one can already set a bound on this operator from the lep data since it contributes to the radiative decay @xmath105 .",
    "we have :    @xmath106    the best limit is from the search of single ( energetic ) isolated photons associated with @xmath107 production .",
    "the l3 collaboration@xcite gives the limit @xmath108 c.l .",
    "in fact this limit corresponds to all events collected for centre - of - mass energies @xmath109 .",
    "this is not as good a limit as one might hope to get due to the p - wave nature of the transition which makes the photon prefer to have as large an energy as possible , but around the @xmath3 peak this is offest by the fact that this configuration forces the intermediate z to be far from resonance .",
    "+ therefore , in order to look for this anomalous coupling , it is necessary as in @xmath78 to be well above threshold .",
    "it turns out that while the cross section for the production of a transverse @xmath3 in the standard model term is strongly peaked in the forward / backward directions , the cross section for the production of a longitudinal @xmath3 has an isotropic angular distribution .",
    "so including the anomalous transition it is easy to show that @xmath110 + \\left ( \\frac{k_e}8\\right ) ^2\\beta ^4\\gamma ^4\\cos ^2\\theta \\right\\}\\ ] ]    where now @xmath111 , and @xmath112 @xmath113 were defined above .",
    "note that again the anomalous term is suppressed near threshold by a factor @xmath114 .",
    "the importance of @xmath18 compared to the first two processes is that at foreseeable lep 2 energies , this process is always well above threshold while the first two processes we have discussed are likely to be still in the threshold region .",
    "hence while it will be difficult to detect any anomalous couplings in e@xmath115 at lep 2 if cp - violating couplings are small and if lep 2 is operated at or very close to threshold , and essentially impossible to detect anomalous couplings of the @xmath3 in @xmath78 ; there should be no difficulty in searching for anomalous couplings of the @xmath3 in @xmath116 .",
    "we have shown that if cp is nearly conserved , then it will be difficult to measure deviations from the standard model in @xmath0-pair production at lep2 .",
    "the likelihood of a successful measurement of any deviation increases substantially with the energy of the machine .",
    "it is therefore essential to work at the highest energies possible .  in some ways",
    "this result is reminiscent of that of de rujula et al.@xcite , who state that the standard model must be satisfied in the lep2 energy region .",
    "our result differs from theirs , however , in several ways : first their result makes no distinction between threshold and non - threshold energies ; second our emphasis is on cp - conservation and not su(2)xu(1 ) local gauge invariance , and third if cp is badly broken in the gauge boson sector then a clear discrepancy from the standard model will be observed .",
    "finally we stress again the importance of looking for at @xmath117 production at lep2 since this process is well above threshold .    99 k.j.f .",
