    "charge ordering in layered transition metal oxides has recently attracted a significant research interest , due to its possible relation to the mechanism of high temperature superconductivity in doped cuprates@xcite and bismuthates.@xcite in particular , stripe - like ordering , which involves holes ordered into linear arrays , separated by an antiferromagnetically ( af ) ordered electronic background , have been discussed as a candidate for the explanation of pseudogap effects in underdoped cuprate compounds.@xcite in addition , the formation of domain walls has been discussed in terms of the proximity to phase separation.@xcite quite generally , phase separation on mesoscopic and even macroscopic scales is potentially relevant for any strongly correlated organic and inorganic electronic system , including systems with spin - density - wave ( sdw),@xcite charge - density - wave ( cdw),@xcite and jahn - teller broken - symmetry@xcite ground states .    on the experimental side ,",
    "mesoscopic ( nanoscale ) phase separation has been observed in many compounds . in the case of la@xmath0sr@xmath1nio@xmath2 stripes",
    "have been observed both using nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) methods and more directly , using high - resolution electron diffraction @xcite .",
    "in addition , stripes have also been identified in la@xmath3ca@xmath1mno@xmath4 for specific commensurate values of doping @xcite . in cuprates static stripe order has been observed in la@xmath5sr@xmath1nd@xmath6cuo@xmath7 in both elastic and inelastic neutron scattering experiments@xcite , and @xmath8-ray diffraction experiments @xcite .",
    "there are also evidences that stripes exist in some form in high-@xmath9 compounds . in the oxygen",
    "doped la@xmath10cuo@xmath11@xcite stripes have been observed using the nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) techniques .",
    "magnetic susceptibility measurements@xcite , nuclear quadrupole resonance @xcite ( nqr ) and muon spin resonance @xcite all indicate formation of domains in la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath12 and recent inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) experiments in la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath12 and yba@xmath13cu@xmath4o@xmath14 superconductors yield results consistent with stripe formation @xcite , although the width of the ins lines in , e.g. , ybco materials is large , which may suggest dynamic charge ordering .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "stripes have been proposed by several research groups . since in strongly correlated systems , such as cuprate superconductors , electrons exhibit a strong on - site repulsion ,",
    "numerous studes have been devoted to the hubbard and @xmath15-@xmath16 models .",
    "it has been shown that a mean - field treatment of the hubbard model yields a stripe phase as a locally stable solution @xcite .",
    "many other studies view the stripes as an outcome of the competition between kinetic energy of holes and exchange energy of spins alone and frequently neglect the role of the long - range part of the coulomb interaction.@xcite and only recently , an attempt to incorporate the long - range forces into the mean - field approach to the hubbard model has been made.@xcite another point of view emphasizes the intrinsic instability of a strongly correlated electronic system towards a phase separation as a necessary starting point.@xcite then it is assumed that such an instability is prevented by the long - range coulomb forces . therefore , the competition between this instability , whose existence in the physical range of parameters of the realistic models is yet to be proven , and coulomb repulsion gives rise to a stripe phase .",
    "thus , these two approaches agree on the importance of the correlations but disagree on the role of long - range forces .",
    "more recently , it has been shown that phase separation is indeed a very common phenomenon close to quantum critical points.@xcite    one would expect that the existence of stripes in the widely studied `` minimal '' @xmath17 or hubbard models can be either proven or disproven by some unbiased numerical technique .",
    "unfortunately , numerically the stability of the stripe phase has been established less clearly .",
    "numerical studies of the @xmath15-@xmath16 model are presenting conflicting conclusions as to the existance of stripe phases in the ground state of this `` basic '' strongly correlated model which might be the result of the strong finite - size effects @xcite .",
    "for example , even a monte carlo simulation of the doped ising model , without the long - range forces , yields holes ordered into loops , rather than into geometric arrays.@xcite in fact , with an exception of the recent density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) simulations of white and scalapino@xcite , which have found stripe formation in relatively large @xmath17 clusters , no microscopic calculation to date has shown that the stripes are a stable entity .",
    "most importantly , no stripe formation in a system with long - range interaction has been studied in a direct simulation .",
    "in addition , the sizes of the clusters available with modern day computers for solving quantum models of spins and holes are still too small to study role of the the long - range coulomb interaction and be free from significant finite - size effects .",
    "in this situation we propose a different strategy : one can study a quasiclassical limit of the quantum problem of holes in an af spin environment analytically and incorporate all essential correlations in an effective hole - hole interaction . in this case the af background is effectively integrated out , and the focus is on the charge subsystem .",
    "then the motion of `` classical '' holes at finite density , interacting via an _ effective _ magnetic interaction and in the presence of long - range coulomb forces , can be studied numerically in much larger systems .",
    "in other words , in this paper we combine analytical and numerical approaches to study the charge ordering in transition metal oxides .",
    "our numerical approach is based on the spin density wave ( sdw ) picture of schrieffer , wen and zhang,@xcite which is closely related@xcite to the semiclassical approach to the @xmath15-@xmath16 model by shraiman and siggia@xcite in which the interaction between doped holes stems from the spiral distortion of the local nel vector near a hole . as shown below , in the quasiclassical limit , the problem can be solved using classical monte carlo ( mc ) or molecular dynamics ( md ) methods . in a systematic numerical study we explore the interplay between long - range coulomb interaction and short ( or intermediate)-range af interactions of dipolar nature , which we take to have both isotropic and anisotropic components ( depending on the lattice structure ) .",
    "our main results can be summarized as follows : in the absence of disorder we find four phases depending on the density of holes and the characteristic af energy scales : ( _ i _ ) a wigner crystal , ( _ ii _ ) diagonal ( glassy ) stripes , ( _ iii _ ) a geometric phase , characterized by horizontal - vertical stripes or checkerboard ( grid ) , and ( _ iv _ ) a `` clumped '' phase ( phase separation ) . in our study",
    "the stripe - like phases emerge as a kind of melting of the wigner crystal phase , hence the long - range coulomb interaction is a necessary ingredient for their occurrence . in the geometric phase",
    "the stripes , resulting from the competition of the short - range and long - range interactions , are characterized by a particular af dipolar alignment .",
    "the patterns are very stable , showing large `` string tension , '' while the motion of holes within a stripe is much softer . if one takes into account the kinetic energy of the holes along the stripes one is lead to the concept of a quantum liquid crystal as proposed recently by emery , fradkin and kivelson .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , the ground state of the geometric phase is not well defined in that there are many geometric phases with very low energies , comparable to that of the ground state , implying a _ rugged energy landscape_. we find that , on lowering the temperature , the geometric hole ordering is characterized by occurence of secondary defects in the structure . at higher temperatures we find that the _ dynamic _",
    "hole ordering is characterized by _ temporally intermittent _ pattern formation ( i.e. , spatio - temporal intermittency ) .",
    "finally , we find that a sufficient concentration of randomly placed impurities destroys the geometric hole pattern , although , regardless of the impurity type , stripe _ segments _ are preserved .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we present a review of the theoretical model and the computational methods we use . in section [ sec : results ] we present our numerical results and in particular we present the phase diagram showing how the obtained phases emerge as a function of doping and interaction strengths .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conclusions ] we summarize our conclusions and experimental implications .",
    "we begin with the spin density wave ( sdw ) picture of layered transition metal oxides .",
    "this picture has been very successful in describing the stoichiometric insulating af phase of these systems at low temperatures.@xcite in this picture the electrons move with hopping energy @xmath15 in the self - consistent staggered field of its spin , as described by , e.g. , the hubbard model ( the calculation is presented in detail in appendix [ hub ] ) : @xmath18 because the translational symmetry of the system is broken , the electronic band is split into upper and lower hubbard bands.@xcite on performing a bogoliubov transformation , one defines the valence ( @xmath19 ) and conduction band ( @xmath20 ) operators , respectively : @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 are the bogolioubov weights and @xmath24 is the sublattice index .",
    "the upper and lower hubbard bands are separated by the mott - hubbard gap , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the expectation value of the staggered field @xmath27 , @xmath28 calculated at momentum transfer @xmath29 . at half filling the lower band is filled and the upper band is empty .",
    "this picture is consistent with the angle resolved photoemission data in the layered af insulator sr@xmath13cuo@xmath13cl@xmath13.@xcite on doping the system with holes with planar density @xmath30 , at low temperatures , @xmath31 , the low frequency physics reflects purely the lower hubbard band ( lhb ) .",
    "it has been shown@xcite that , regardless of the band structure , the lhb has a maximum at four wavevectors @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the lattice spacing , and therefore the long wavelength theory of the problem can be studied by assuming the momentum of the holes to be close to these points .",
    "then the two hole interaction hamiltonian can be separated into the longitudinal and transverse parts ( @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively ) , whose fourier transform , for quasiparticle momenta near @xmath36 , is equal to:@xcite @xmath37 \\delta({\\bf r})- \\nonumber \\\\",
    "b_{xy}&&\\left[\\frac{{\\bf d}_1\\cdot { \\bf d}_2}{r^2 } -   2\\frac{({\\bf d}_1 \\cdot { \\bf r})\\,\\ ,           ( { \\bf d}_2 \\cdot { \\bf r})}{r^4}\\right ] \\left(\\sigma^+_1\\sigma^-_2 + \\sigma^-_1\\sigma^+_2\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is a relative hole - hole distance , @xmath39 is a coordinate of a hole in units of @xmath33 , @xmath40 is a spin - density operator , with @xmath41 pauly matrices , @xmath42 is a unity vector in the direction of the dipole moment of the hole . in the sdw formalism",
    "the interaction strengths @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are all of order hubbard @xmath46 .",
    "the interaction ( [ eq : interaction ] ) is clearly rotationally invariant and valid for @xmath47 , while for @xmath48 it yields an unphysical divergence of the ( attractive ) dipolar interaction .",
    "we observe that this form of the hamiltonian is not particular to the sdw theory of the hubbard model , but stresses the fact that a mobile carrier in an antiferromagnet produces a dipolar distortion of the magnetic background .",
    "we demonstrate this explicitly in appendix [ tj ] where we show that the t - j model has exactly the same type of interaction terms . in other words , at finite density the holes interact via two different mechanisms : a uniform short - range attractive force due to af bond  breaking and a long - range magnetic dipolar interaction ( contained by eq .",
    "( [ eq : interaction ] ) , see ref .  ) .",
    "the latter term is due to the long range spiral distortion of the af background , which is a consequence of quasiparticles interacting with soft ( goldstone ) modes of the spin system.@xcite the magnetic dipole moment associated with each hole is due to the coherent hopping of holes between different sublattices and scales with the af magnetic energy .",
    "this implies that the quantum effects associated with hole kinetic energy can be neglected , which is correct in the limit @xmath49 , believed to be valid in nickelates .",
    "this is also why the hole - hole interaction obtained in the weak coupling sdw picture is equivalent@xcite to that in the effective hamiltonian found by shraiman and siggia@xcite , based on the @xmath17 model , where the _ dipolar _ interaction is obtained using _ semiclassical _ analysis of the spin part of the model , as well as symmetry considerations .",
    "it is also possible to prove , using ward identities , that the remaining spin part of the problem is equivalent to the two dimensional ( 2d ) non - linear @xmath50 model in the long wavelength limit @xcite .",
    "it has been argued@xcite that at physical values @xmath51 all coupling strengths ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath52 ) , and therefore the hole - hole interaction , will be renormalized to the value of super - exchange constant @xmath16 .    in pure two dimensions at finite @xmath53",
    "the system is magnetically disordered , characterized by a finite magnetic correlation length , @xmath54 ( see ref .  ) , and the range of the dipolar interaction between the holes , mediated by the af background , is also of order @xmath54 . in fact , even at @xmath55 and _ finite _ hole concentration the correlation lenght is restricted and the dipolar interaction is effectively short ranged .",
    "it has been noted @xcite that the dipolar twist of the magnetic background would imply local time - reversal symmetry breaking which puts some restrictions on the applicability of the picture to the real systems where such symmetry breaking has not been experimentally observed .",
    "indeed , the time - reversal symmetry is already broken in the nel state , as well as in any magnetically ordered state . however , in two - dimensional spin systems at finite temperature all symmetries are restored and we expect this to be true also for the hole - doped case studied here .    besides the af interactions the holes also experience the long - range coulomb interaction .",
    "this is clear if we consider that @xmath56 ( where @xmath57 is the mean inter - particle distance and @xmath58 is the bohr radius ) is very large in the underdoped systems ( @xmath59 ) . in other words , in systems with a small density of holes",
    "the screening , which is due to the density fluctuations , is very weak and one must take the coulomb interaction into account .    finally , each hole carries a spin degree of freedom as well .",
    "however inspection of eq .",
    "( [ eq : interaction ] ) reveals that the overall spin energy is minimized in the spin anti - symmetric channel .",
    "hence we neglect the spin - symmetric channel and thus in our approach , we only consider the charge channel with an effective ( magnetic in origin ) interaction between two holes , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , of the form ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : interaction ] ) ) @xmath62 where we have asssumed that * r * can be relaxed from a crystal lattice position to an arbitrary ( continuous ) value .",
    "we return to this point later .    in eq .",
    "( [ total ] ) @xmath63 is the hole charge , @xmath64 is the dielectric constant ( which we assume to be of order 1 ) , @xmath65 is the angle made between @xmath66 and a fixed axis and @xmath67 are the angles of the magnetic dipoles relative to the same fixed axis .",
    "@xmath68 is the strength of the uniform ( short - range ) interaction and @xmath69 is the strength of the magnetic dipolar interaction , which we will assume to be independent adjustable parameters , which , in real materials , should be of order @xmath70 ev . note that we have introduced @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is some appropriate average length , @xmath73 , in order to avoid the unphysical divergence of the dipolar part of the interaction in eq .",
    "( [ eq : interaction ] ) , while keeping the necessary symmetry of the interaction .",
    "moreover , in the sdw picture , at low doping , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are restricted to the angles @xmath76 , the four angles determined by the vectors * k*@xmath77 .",
    "in addition , the dipole moment vectors are also restricted to * k*@xmath77 , which justifies our use of eq.([total ] ) where we have assumed a fixed _ size _ of the dipole moment for each hole .",
    "however , at larger doping levels these angles can be relaxed to arbitrary values , provided the interaction is short - ranged .",
    "of course , we have verified by an explicit calculation that restricting dipole angles to the discrete values does not qualitatively change our results , presented in the next section .",
    "it is interesting to note that the hole - hole interaction in the form almost identical to eq .",
    "( [ total ] ) has been obtained by aharony _",
    "et al._@xcite for the _ static _ holes residing on cu - o bonds within the framework of a _ classical _ model of an af diluted by ferromagnetic bonds . in this case the value of the coupling constant @xmath69 is also restricted by a few @xmath16 .",
    "indeed , starting from the insulating phase of cuprates , the holes are injected into the cuo@xmath13 planes at high temperatures during the sample preparation .",
    "the hole distribution in this case is annealed ( instead of quenched as proposed in ref .  ) since the holes have enough phase space for interactions .",
    "as the temperature is lowered the holes can adjust themselves to @xmath78 and form the structures we discuss below .    quite generally",
    ", one can think of an af as an active media generating long range dipolar forces in response on some local distortion .",
    "therefore , the interaction @xmath78 , eq .",
    "( [ total ] ) is of more general significance than just a result of the sdw picture , and the study of the system of particles interacting via @xmath78 is of wider interest .    in general ,",
    "the many - body problem of holes in an af background is extremely complicated , involving many - particle interaction terms .",
    "however , at low densities , where the average distance between holes is comparable to the af correlation length , it is reasonable to assume that the interaction of any two holes is weakly perturbed by other holes , and the total potential energy can be expressed in terms of two - particle energies , provided the af correlation length is replaced by an _",
    "effective _ correlation length , which , to avoid clutter , we also denote as @xmath54 .",
    "we therefore study the system of `` classical '' particles in a computational box of size @xmath79 , interacting via a potential @xmath80 where @xmath78 is given by ( [ total ] ) .",
    "however , we emphasize that our approach is not a self - consistent one in the sense that the true interaction must include many particle terms ( omitted here ) , which stem from the fact that the sdw state is altered due to the charge ordering .",
    "the self - consistent approach to charge ordering will be presented elsewhere .",
    "in addition , superconducting fluctuations have been neglected . moreover",
    ", the kinetic energy of the holes may lead to a quantum melting of the phases discussed here .",
    "= 7.5 cm    = 7.50 cm    the long - range character of the coulomb interaction requires further consideration : in order to perform calculations at finite density , as required by the dipolar interaction we consider , we usually perform calculations with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the ability to handle long - range coulomb interactions in rectangular periodic media has been enhanced recently in the area of molecular physics.@xcite assuming a computational cell of arbitrary geometry and cyclic boundary conditions it is possible to sum interactions of particles with all of their images residing in cells obtained by translation from the original computational cell,@xcite yielding an effective interaction which is periodic in the computational cell used ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lekner ] ) . on making integral transformations ,",
    "coulomb interactions are computed by summing over fast - convergent bessel functions with great accuracy ( see ref .   for a detailed study of the lekner summation technique ) .",
    "the computational efficiency is further enhanced by tabulating the effective interaction .",
    "this is possible since the difference between the obtained effective interaction and the coulomb interaction is a well behaved function which can be easily calculated using polynomial interpolation .    at the beginning of each simulation",
    "we place the holes at random and assign to each hole a magnetic dipole moment of constant size , but random direction .",
    "we study the energy landscape and the dynamics of the system using three different methods : monte carlo ( mc ) , langevin molecular dynamics ( md ) and a hybrid mc - md method.@xcite all three methods yield essentially the same results .",
    "both mc and md methods are well known in the literature@xcite and hence we only review details pertinent to our calculation . in the mc method we use the standard metropolis algorithm for the acceptance of hole configurations . for the langevin md method the dynamics of the system",
    "is determined by the forces , obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) , with a noise term , @xmath81 , for each particle which satisfies the usual fluctuation - dissipation condition @xmath82 , where @xmath83 , @xmath84 correspond to all possible degrees of freedom and @xmath85 is a damping term.@xcite since the system exhibits several phases ( see fig .  [ fig : phase_diagram ] ) for some values of the input parameters , its ground state is not always well defined and a numerically obtained low temperature state may , in fact , depend on the initial and boundary conditions . hence , in order to rapidly reach a hole configuration with the lowest global minimum energy we perform simulated annealing from high temperatures .",
    "the hybrid mc method includes elements of both the mc and md methods : the hole configuration is again determined using the standard metropolis algorithm , but here a new configuration is obtained by letting the system evolve through a classical md calculation over a certain time period .",
    "note that , in principle , in classical md calculations the energy is a conserved quantity , hence every step should in principle be accepted .",
    "in reality the md method introduces errors which typically slightly lower the system energy , just as required by the metropolis algorithm .",
    "hence this method yields extremely high mc acceptance ratios.@xcite",
    "in this section we discuss the results of our numerical calculations .",
    "we first present the obtained ordered phases and the phase diagram of the system and discuss its implications .",
    "we then show the hole ordering in the presence of disorder .",
    "finally we show the properties of the system as a function of @xmath53 and in particular the dynamics of the observed ( stripe ) pattern formation .",
    "before we begin with the presentation of our results we address the input parameters of the model , namely the hole density , @xmath30 ( or the doping level @xmath86 ) , the strength of the isotropic and dipolar part of the af interaction , @xmath68 and @xmath69 respectively , the af correlation length , @xmath54 , the temperature @xmath53 and the concentration of impurities , @xmath87 , for the systems with static point disorder .",
    "we define the doping level @xmath86 as the hole density measured in units of cuprate lattice spacing ; thus @xmath88% corresponds to 1 hole per 100 @xmath89 , where @xmath90  .",
    "the input parameters are not necessarily independent of each other , e.g. , @xmath68 and @xmath69 should be proportional to each other , with @xmath91 when @xmath92 and @xmath93 when @xmath94 ( see ref .  ) .",
    "however , since the range of the bond breaking and dipolar interactions is vastly different , it is reasonable to treat @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath54 as independent parameters .",
    "clearly both @xmath68 and @xmath69 should be of order of the hubbard @xmath46 in the sdw approach and of the order of @xmath16 in the strong coupling limit , and the correlation length is of order 1 to 10 lattice spacings in cuprates .",
    "we begin with the low temperature properties ( ground state ) of the system as a function of @xmath69 .",
    "the relevant order parameter for charge ordering is the fourier transform of the hole density : @xmath95 where @xmath39 is the position of the @xmath96 hole and @xmath97 is the total number of holes .",
    "a peak in @xmath98 at some wave - vector @xmath99 indicates ordering .",

    "( [ eq : staggered ] ) , it is immediately clear that @xmath101 , i.e. , a peak in @xmath102 at @xmath103 leads to a magnetic peak at @xmath104 and by symmetry at @xmath105 .    since the interaction due to the second term in eq .",
    "( [ total ] ) ( isotropic attractive interaction ) is extremely short - range ( in fact in an infinite system it is a @xmath106 function ) , it is initially reasonable to set @xmath107 and explore the behavior of the system as a function of @xmath69 .",
    "we return later to the role of @xmath68 . as explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] low @xmath53 properties have been obtained by annealing the system from some high temperature ( @xmath108k ) down to temperatures of order 1k . in the extreme case @xmath109",
    "we find a wigner crystal with small distortions , to be the state of lowest energy , as expected@xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : wigner]a ) .",
    "= 8.0 cm    the small distortion of the wigner crystal structure is due to the periodicity , which introduces a small spatial anisotropy into the system due to the shape of the computational box . indeed , upon setting , e.g. , @xmath110",
    ", we obtain a perfect wigner crystal to be the ground state .",
    "another extreme case is when @xmath111 . in this case",
    "the af dipolar interaction dominates over the average coulomb interaction ; one then finds star shaped clumps of holes , similar in shape to those found in ref .",
    ", which can , at sufficiently high density , form a geometric structure ( e.g. , a wigner crystal of clumps ) .",
    "we note that this case is rather unphysical , as macroscopic phase separation is inconsistent with our initial assumption of the two - body dipolar interaction being independent of the many - hole effects . on the other hand , ordering of macroscopically hole rich regions",
    "is in agreement with the conjecture that all ground states are geometrically ordered.@xcite on increasing @xmath112 , at fixed density , the wigner crystal becomes unstable and a new phase with diagonal stripes is formed , as shown in fig .",
    "2a of ref .. the main characteristic of this phase is a ferro - magnetic ordering of the af dipoles .",
    "the situation here is very similar to that observed in la@xmath0sr@xmath1nio@xmath2 ( see ref .  ) .",
    "note that such a state with a dipole ordering appeares to violate time reversal symmetry . on the other hand the true ground state in this case also involves hole ordering , with holes aligned in stripes either perpendicular or parallel to the dipole orientation .",
    "however , the interstripe distance , in this case , is close to that between holes within a stripe and hence a simulation inevitably yields a `` glassy '' state , with many defects .",
    "this is reflected in the shape of @xmath102 , which shows broad peaks ( see fig .",
    "2b in ref . ) , indicating an average interstripe distance .",
    "= 6.50 cm    = 5.0 cm    = 5.0 cm    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tile]a , at larger values of @xmath69 a linear stripe is formed , which , with increasing density tends to close into a loop .",
    "more importantly , the loop formation is accompanied by magnetic dipole orientation along the straight portion of a loop with gradual rotation by @xmath113 at each corner.@xcite due to the rotation of dipoles at corners the loops interact , and eventually form the checkerboard ( grid ) pattern.@xcite the size of the distance between holes within a line is determined by the ratio of @xmath69 ( or the sum of @xmath68 and @xmath69 , for @xmath114 ) and the coulomb energy ; the grid sizes are determined by the hole density alone .",
    "these results appear to be consistent with the dmrg numerical solution of the @xmath17 model@xcite which also finds loops of holes , except that in our case the periodic boundary conditions and the coulomb interaction yield a `` tile grid '' as opposed to `` droplets . ''",
    "note the almost perfect ( infinite charge correlation length , @xmath115 ) crystal structure obtained ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tile]c ) .",
    "it is noteworthy that a typical solution yields a finite dipole moment at each grid intersection , which , in turn , can take one of the two orientations ( along two diagonals of the computational box ) , thus creating a highly degenerate system of moments ( see fig.[fig : coex ] below ) .",
    "we recall that the presented solution is obtained assuming an arbitrary dipole orientation with a constant hole dipole magnitude , i.e. , a continuum of angles between the dipoles and a fixed axis .",
    "as explained in the previous section , at very low doping the dipoles would reside near the bz diagonals , i.e. , they would assume almost `` discrete '' orientations . in order to study the effect of this `` discreteness ''",
    "we have performed the same simulation this time assuming that hole dipoles can take only one of four directions ( determined by the momenta of the maxima of the lower hubbard band ) .",
    "we find that the physics of the pattern formation is qualitativelly unaltered ( hence we do not present them here ) , except for one important difference : the `` bending '' of stripes at the grid intersections disappears , i.e. , one no longer has a finite dipole moment at these intersections .",
    "another way of quantifying this ordered phase is by straightforwardly calculating the `` string tension , '' which , at @xmath116 is equal to @xmath117 , where @xmath46 is the total potential energy and @xmath8 is a small hole ( or stripe ) displacement ; a large string tension indicates a high stability of the obtained phase , and vice versa . in fig.[fig : tension]a we show the string tension for motion perpendicular to a grid side compared with the motion along a side . as seen in the figure , the grid phase ( and , as discussed below , the stripe phase ) is extremely stable with respect to the hole motion perpendicular to the holes line segments , due to the coulomb interacton . on the other hand , at larger doping values and fixed hole density the stripes are almost compressible , i.e.",
    ", the motion of holes along a stripe is rather soft .",
    "the anisotropy of the perpendicular and longitudinal string tension decreases with decreasing @xmath69 .",
    "= 7.0 cm    = 7.0 cm    at fixed af correlation length the four observed phases yield a diagram which we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_diagram]a .",
    "we remark that in all phases a non - vanishing value of @xmath68 leads to a decrease in the effective value of @xmath69 at which the transitions occur , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_diagram]b .",
    "the isotropic term @xmath68 alone _ never _ produces any non - trivial geometric phase ( e.g. , stripes ) , even with inclusion of lattice effects .",
    "we find that the transition between the ferro - dipolar and the grid phases is first order , as indicated by the coexistence of phases in fig .",

    "no coexistence of phases has been observed at other transitions , suggesting that they are second order .",
    "we also recall that our calculations are _ quasiclassical _ and thus the obtained geometric ( stripe ) phases are insulating .",
    "moreover , in our formalism the hole density within a stripe can assume an arbitrary value , depending on the dipolar interaction strength .",
    "= 6.50 cm    = 6.0 cm    = 8.0 cm    in the cases presented above we have assumed a uniform magnetic dipolar interaction . it is well known that there are orthorhombic and tetragonal distortions in practically all transition metal oxides . in particular static stripe formation has only been observed in the low temperature tetragonal phase of la@xmath5nd@xmath6sr@xmath1cuo@xmath12@xcite . in order to study the influence of the anisotropy we assume that the magnetic dipole sizes along the @xmath8 and @xmath118 directions have anisotropy @xmath24 ( @xmath119 corresponds to the isotropic case ) .",
    "figure [ fig : aniso ] shows the pattern we obtain for @xmath120 :    = 7.0 cm    the rotational symmetry is broken and a stripe superlattice is formed , with a charge ordering vector @xmath121 , where @xmath122 is the inter - stripe distance .",
    "more importantly , the total dipole moment in this state vanishes . as explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , this yields a fourier transform of the magnetization @xmath123 peaked at @xmath124 in momentum space .",
    "of course , it is reasonable to assume that in twinned single crystals , used in inelastic neutron scattering experiments , one has domains which average out this anisotropy .",
    "note that in both calculated geometric phases ( see figs .  [ fig : tile ] and [ fig : aniso ] ) , the interstripe distance is much larger than the intrastripe distance , in agreement with experimental findings in underdoped cuprates .",
    "our results are somewhat sensitive to the applied boundary conditions .",
    "first , for a small computational box the exact size of the grid depends on its commensuration with the box length , which , in turn depends on the density . on increasing of the size of the computational box",

    "[ fig : tile ] .",

    "[ fig : tile]b with no change in their wave - numbers , indicating the finite value of @xmath115 , as seen in fig.[fig : defects]b .",
    "the sensitivity to boundary conditions is further seen in finite size calculations , i.e , not assuming periodic boundary conditions , but with an appropriate neutralizing charge background . in this case",
    "the holes do not form geometric phases , although they still form stripes , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : maze]a",
    ". however , in a finite system even very small anisotropy ( @xmath125 ) again leads to stripe formation , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : maze]b .",

    "= 7.0 cm    = 7.0 cm    = 4.0 cm = 4.0 cm = 4.0 cm = 4.0 cm    we have also performed simulations in the presence of a realistic underlying periodic lattice and have found that this creates slight distortions in the phases , pinning loops more strongly . in particular , the peaks in @xmath98 sharpen in some of these phases .",
    "we now turn to the effects of point disorder .",
    "there are several kinds of impurities which are of experimental interest in transition metal oxides .",
    "we divide them into four distinct groups :    -2mm=4.1cm=3.8 cm -4.3 cm 4.1cm=4.2cm=3.9 cm .1 cm    \\(i ) out - of - plane impurities , such as sr in lsco compounds , ( ii ) in - plane charged impurities , such as ( presumably ) li,@xcite ( iii ) in - plane uncharged impurities , such as ni and ( iv ) in plane uncharged impurities which induce a magnetic moment , such as zn .",
    "hence , we model the impurity effects by adding a random ( in position ) potential to the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) , which is either short - ranged and located in plane or , as in the case of charged impurities , long - ranged ( coulomb ) and either in - plane or out - of - plane ( a distance @xmath126 from the plane where the holes are located ) . in the case of type iv",
    "we have also altered the dipolar interaction in the vicinity of an impurity , i.e. , the magnetic interaction is multiplied by a factor @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is the distance of a hole to a nearby impurity and @xmath129 is the effective radius of the impurity , which , for the case of zn , has been estimated to be of order 2 lattice sites around each impurity atom.@xcite examples of the effects of the four types of impurities are presented in fig .  [ fig:4impurities ] .",
    "clearly , all four types of impurities lead to the destruction of the geometric ( stripe or grid ) hole order at sufficiently large impurity concentration , @xmath87 . on the other hand , in all four cases stripe ordering persists through the formation of line segments of holes , resulting in a new , _ glassy _",
    "phase.@xcite moreover , the four impurity types exhibit different mechanisms for destroying the stripe order .",
    "the charge ordered phases are practically unaffected by a small concentration of uncharged impurities ( see fig.[fig:4impurities]b ) , i.e. , the stripes simply avoid impurity sites . consequently , the stripes persist to relatively high concentrations of this type of disorder .",
    "the charged impurities first lead to stripe deformation , i.e. , the stripes pass either very close to the impurities ( for attractive , pinning impurities ) or very far from the impurities ( for repulsive impurities ) , in order to maximize the potential energy ( see figs .",
    "[ fig:4impurities]a and [ fig:4impurities]c ) . with increasing @xmath87",
    "the stripes rupture and only stripe segments persist .",
    "finally , the impurities with a local magnetic moment affect the formation of the spiral spin phase , responsible for the ( attractive ) dipolar interaction . since the magnetic interaction is strongly suppressed in the vicinity of such an impurity site",
    ", even the stripe segments can not exist there , as shown in fig.[fig:4impurities]d .",
    "impurities are especially effective in destroying the ordered phases found at small @xmath69 . for example , the wigner crystal state becomes glassy at relatively low impurity concentrations .",
    "this happens because , e.g. , in the case of impurity type i , the attractive coulomb energy between impurities and holes scales like @xmath130 , where @xmath126 is the distance between the planes in which the impurities and holes reside , while the average inter - hole coulomb energy behaves like @xmath131 .",
    "thus when @xmath132 the holes are pinned by impurities .    in general the role of impurities depends strongly on the impurity concentration , @xmath87 . however , the magnetic dipole interaction is sufficient to retain the main orientation , as seen in fig.[fig : imp_correlation ] where we have plotted the correlation length as a function of @xmath87 .",
    "this leads us to conjecture that with the addition of the kinetic energy the holes can move in string segments in an orientation given basically by the phase diagram of the clean system .",
    "the stripe motion would then be caused by mesoscopic thermal or quantum tunneling of the finite strings between the minima of the overall potential .",
    "this would lead to non - linear field dependence in the low temperature conductivity.@xcite      we now proceed to the finite @xmath53 results . the numerical procedure is identical , except that the temperature is lowered adiabatically to a finite value ( i.e. , a numerical annealing ) . in a classical simulation",
    "this is equivalent to introducing kinetic energy into the system .    in the case of a wigner crystal , @xmath109",
    ", we find that the introduction of finite @xmath53 melts the crystalline structure and the resulting phase is the 2d coulomb gas .",
    "the diagonal ( glassy ) phase is also unstable at relatively low temperatures . on the other hand ,",
    "the geometricaly ordered states , for @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is the distance between holes within a stripe segment , are all stable up to @xmath53 of order @xmath135 . at even higher temperatures",
    ", the stripe array melts with a temporal intermittency of the observed pattern : i.e. , spatio - temporal intermittency .",
    "[ fig : intermittent ] shows four stages of this melting process .",
    "we observed that the stripe melts through a rupture which results in creation of finite stripe segments that eventually ( at constant and high @xmath53 ) disperse into individual holes .",
    "note that the temporal geometric pattern ( panel ( b ) ) is not the same as that in the ground state . as mentioned before , there are many low lying geometric states , close in energy to the ground state , which can temporarily occur at finite @xmath53 .",
    "hence the dynamics of the stripe ordering is similar to that observed in glasses , characterized by non - gaussian fluctuations . to show this we follow the dynamics of the hole system at temperatures slightly _ below _ the melting temperature : we start from a low lying metastable state , such as that depicted in fig.[fig : intermittent]b , increase the temperature adiabatically to the point at which the structure begins to melt ( which is a measure of the activation energy ) and",
    "let the system equillibrate .",
    "= 6.3 cm    = 6.3 cm    = 6.3 cm    in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum]a we plot an energy histogram at this temperature ( with the energy shifted by an arbitrary additive constant ) , thus indicating an intensity of the energy states ( bands ) :    = 6.50 cm    = 6.50 cm    obviously , there is a band of energy states , not far ( fraction of an ev per particle ) from the ground state , which are close in energy and metastable .",
    "these states are separated by a high barrier ( the maximum of which would fall beyond the right edge on the plot ) , yet are close in energy , suggesting a _ rugged _ energy landscape.@xcite indeed , as shown earlier , formation of a string of holes creates a barrier for adding more holes to the string ( they can be only added to the string ends ) .",
    "thus , any geometrically ordered state ( say , those with denser intra - stripe hole concentration and larger interstripe distances ) must be separated by an energy barrier from other geometrically ordered states and in particular from the ground state .",
    "the potential energy states obtained suggest that the dynamics of stripe motion should be strongly governed by these low lying states and thus show a non - trivial fluctuation spectrum . indeed , in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum]b we show the power spectrum of the energy fluctuations for the solution described by the histogram in fig .  [",
    "fig : spectrum]a , and see that the noise spectrum contains a strong @xmath136 component for approximately two and half decades of frequencies .",
    "this indicates slow fluctuations , which we ascribe to collective motions of melted hole string segments .",
    "another way of characterizing the melting of stripes is by counting `` free holes : '' in fig .",
    "[ fig : free_holes ] we show the percentage of holes which are _ not _ in a part of an ordered pattern , as a function of @xmath53 . as one can see , at the transition point",
    "only a small fraction of holes does not belong to a string segment , in agreement with our observation that the stripes melt by rupturing into smaller segments .",
    "= 7.4 cm = 5.5 cm    further study of the glassy dynamics of charge ordered phases in terms of the ( free ) energy landscape will be presented elsewhere .",
    "in summary , on employing the sdw picture of transition metal oxides , we have studied the short - range and dipolar attractive forces generated by the af fluctuations , together with long - range coulomb forces .",
    "we have developed a novel numerical technique , which enables us to treat doped hole vacancies at finite concentration .",
    "we have studied the competition between long - range and short - range interactions and its influence on hole ordering in layered transition metal oxides .",
    "we have found a rich phase diagram for the clean system which includes a wigner solid , diagonal stripes , grid ( loops ) and a macroscopic phase separation . for intermediate values of magnetic interaction",
    "this phase diagram is consistent with several different experimental measurements , such as the inelastic neutron scattering .",
    "in addition , on adding a small , but finite amount of anisotropy to the dipolar interaction we find that the ground state of the system of holes is the striped phase , found in la@xmath137nd@xmath138sr@xmath1cuo@xmath7 . in the geometric phases with strong magnetic interaction strength we have found a large string tension for the motion of holes perpendicular to the stripe direction .",
    "this is due to the coulomb interaction and indicates strong stability of the obtained phases .",
    "we have also found the system of holes to be quite sensitive to the presence of charged impurities . in particular , adding out - of - plane attractive impurities pins the holes and , for small pinning energies , increases the melting temperature of the stripe phase , although it does yield a finite charge correlation length . in general ,",
    "charged impurities are very effective in destroying the stripe order , especially those residing in the same plane as the holes , regardless of whether they are attractive or repulsive , although the stripe phases survive as finite _ stripe segments _ up to relatively high impurity concentrations .",
    "this suggests that nonlinear conductivity should be prevalent .",
    "the resulting hole patterns are the result of frustration ( competition between short - range and long - range forces ) : this frustration leads to collective motions , involving large number of particles which ultimately lead to geometricly ordered ground states .",
    "we have also studies the dynamics of the geometric phase formation and its melting .",
    "we find that the dynamics is characterized by a `` glassy '' behavior in that the energy landscape is rugged , as characterized by the spatio - temporal intermittency of the observed behavior .",
    "more importantly , we find that , for fixed ( large ) size of the magnetic ( dipolar ) interaction , there are fewer number of sharper minima , while the string tension of the stripes is larger . as a consequence , in this case",
    "the melting of the stripe phase occurs at higher temperature with increased doping concentration .",
    "the energy landscape is also characterized by formation of domains , separated by defects .",
    "this picture is in agreement with recent nmr experiments@xcite in which small activation energies are easily attributed to domain growth and/or motion .",
    "thus , further study of our model will include the dynamics of the domain growth and their melting .",
