    "the energy cascade is unaffected and the velocity distribution agrees with the stationary distribution but above this scale , the distribution is exponentially suppressed .",
    "we relied only on the linear boltzmann equation to derive a scaling form for the cut - off function .",
    "of course , the full nonlinear equation ( [ be-1d ] ) is still relevant as it governs the dynamics of small velocities via the stationary solution @xmath152 .",
    "this guarantees that the velocity distribution is properly normalized , and specifically , that the integral over small velocities remains finite .",
    "we numerically integrated the hard - sphere boltzmann equation in one - dimension to verify these predictions .",
    "velocity bins are kept , each with a double precision number representing the number of particles within that velocity range . in the simulation ,",
    "two velocity bins are chosen randomly with a rate proportional to the collision rate .",
    "when two bins `` collide '' , particles are transferred from each into target bins , determined by the collision rule ( [ rule-1d ] ) .",
    "we generated the stationary distribution by injecting energy at a fixed rate .",
    "this was done by uniformly removing particles from the distribution and re - injecting them according to a gaussian distribution with a large characteristic velocity .",
    "once the system reaches the stationary state , we turn off the energy injection and observe the distribution @xmath18 as it cools .",
    "figure [ fig : snapshots ] shows the driven steady - state distribution and the freely cooling distributions at three later times .",
    "the results verify that the steady - state has a power - law tail , @xmath216 and that the freely cooling distributions are close to the steady - state distribution for sufficiently small velocities .",

    "( [ vhaff ] ) , holds until @xmath126 is order @xmath217 .",
    "thus , the lifetime of the collapsing power - law solution approaches a constant of order unity as @xmath160 becomes infinite . during most of the time that the power - law is collapsing",
    ", @xmath126 decays algebraically with time , @xmath218 .",
    "figure [ fig : vt ] shows the cut - off velocity versus time together with a fit to the form ( [ decaysoln ] ) with @xmath17 .",
    "we also checked that the tail of the cooling distribution is exponential .",
    "we conclude that for completely inelastic hard - spheres , the simulation results are in excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions .",
    "in summary , we find a new class of steady - state and time - dependent states for inelastic gases . in the nonequilibrium steady - states ,",
    "energy is injected at large velocities , it cascades down to small velocities , and it is dissipated over a power - law range .",
    "generically , the steady - state distributions have a power - law high - energy tail .",
    "the characteristic exponents were obtained analytically and they vary with the spatial dimension and the collision rules . formally , the stationary solutions are characterized by an infinite dissipation rate , while the energy density may be either finite or infinite . in an actual particle system , these steady - states may be realized only up to the energy injection scale , so that all thermodynamic characteristics including the dissipation rate and the energy density are finite .      when injection is turned - off , the velocity distribution is stationary only in a shrinking range of velocities and it decays sharply as a stretched exponential at large velocities . for completely inelastic collisions , the scaling function underlying this behavior can be obtained exactly from the linearized boltzmann equation and at small velocities , there is a subtle log - normal correction to the power - law behavior .",
    "although we analyzed only the one - dimensional case , we expect the same behavior in higher - dimension .",
    "these time - dependent states can be loosely thought of as a hybrid between a steady - state solution and the well - known , freely - cooling solution .",
    "both the time - dependence of the characteristic velocity and the decay at large velocities are similar , but not identical , to those occurring for freely cooling granular gases . after",
    "the cut - off velocity becomes comparable to the typical velocity , the velocity distribution presumably crosses over to the freely cooling solutions .",
    "cascade processes occur in many other physical systems .",
    "mathematically , the inelastic cascade process for one - dimensional hard - spheres is identical to that found for the grinding process in ref .",
    "@xcite , and in both problems @xmath220 . indeed , the cascade process ( [ cp-1d ] ) is equivalent to a fragmentation process . in fluid turbulence ,",
    "the fluid is forced at a large spatial scale , energy cascades from large scales to small scales , where it is dissipated due to viscosity @xcite .",
    "actually , the situation found here for granular gases is analogous to wave turbulence , that is described by a kinetic theory for wave collisions @xcite .",
    "one difference with the kolmogorov spectra of fluid turbulence is that the characteristic exponents are irrational because they do not follow from dimensional analysis .",
    "inelastic cascades are a direct consequence of the collision rule and they are described by a linear equation . this equation should be valid under very broad conditions and it can be generalized to nonuniform distributions of impact angles and collision parameters as well as polydisperse granular media .",
    "additionally , the cascade dynamics should extend to viscoelastic collision rules because the restitution coefficient depends only weakly on the relative velocity for energetic collisions @xcite .",
    "the most significant condition for these steady - states concerns the driving mechanism : the injection rate must be small compared to the collision rate and the injection energy large compared to the typical energy .",
    "we propose that stationary distributions may be achieved in driven granular gas experiments where energy is injected at very large velocity scales .",
    "algebraic tails with exponents comparable with these reported here were observed recently in sheared granular layers , but these experiments involved frictional , rather than collisional , dynamics @xcite .",
    "inelastic cascades should also arise when an energetic particle hits a static medium of inelastic particles , or alternatively , a background of slowly moving particles .",
    "indeed , the collision dynamics in this case reduce to the inelastic cascade discussed in this paper",
    ". this setup may be interesting to study theoretically and experimentally .    in closing ,",
    "the kinetic theory of inelastic collisions is remarkable as the nonlinear boltzmann equation admits a number of distinct solutions including steady - states , transient states , and hybrid states that interpolate between the two .",
    "nonlinearity , nonlocality , and the lack of energy conservation are responsible for this remarkable complexity .",
