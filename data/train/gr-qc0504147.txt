    "in the hamiltonian analysis of theories of gauge potentials , the configuration space usually is the space @xmath1 of connections defined on a principal fiber bundle @xmath2 of a compact structure group @xmath3 .",
    "the cotangent bundle @xmath4 ( appropriately defined ) with the natural symplectic structure becomes the phase space .",
    "in addition to the hamiltonian equations of motion , the theory will exhibit constraint equations .",
    "the constraints play a double role in a hamiltonian theory . on the one hand",
    "they generate a group of symmetries of the phase space referred to as the gauge transformations , on the other hand the set of solutions of the constraints defines the constraint surface of the phase space .",
    "the simplest example for such a kind of theory is certainly maxwell theory , where the structure group is @xmath5 .",
    "a more general example is yang - mills theory , where the structure group may be an arbitrary compact lie group @xmath3 . in this case",
    "the group of the gauge transformations is the group of the fiber preserving automorphisms of the given bundle , homotopic to the identity .",
    "the group is often referred to as the `` yang mills gauge transformations '' .",
    "another example , in fact the one which has triggered the present investigations , is gravity , formulated in terms of real ashtekar variables @xcite . in the @xmath6 case ,",
    "the structure group is @xmath7 , the bundle is trivial and defined over a @xmath8-manifold .",
    "the group of the gauge transformations generated by the constraints contains _ all _ the bundle automorphisms homotopic to the identity map . in terms of a local section ,",
    "the group becomes the semi - direct product of the yang - mills gauge transformations and the diffeomorphisms of @xmath9 homotopic to the identity map .",
    "this hamiltonian formulation is the starting point of the loop quantum gravity ( lqg , for brevity ) program .    to quantize such a theory  la dirac ,",
    "one first seeks appropriate basic variables .",
    "these are preferred functions separating the points of the phase space which are then quantized . this part of the procedure is called _ kinematical _ hereafter .",
    "the constraints are then imposed as operator equations on the kinematical hilbert space or in an appropriately selected dual .    in the present paper we are concerned with two issues arising in the kinematical quantization framework of lqg and of every theory of connections",
    "whose phase space is @xmath4 .",
    "the first issue concerns the choice of basic classical variables and a definition of a corresponding ( abstract ) quantum @xmath0-algebra .",
    "we slightly generalize and improve details of the ideas developed in lqg and define a quantum @xmath0-algebra @xmath10 of basic quantum variables .",
    "our definitions are valid for arbitrary dimension @xmath11 of the base manifold @xmath9 , arbitrary compact structure group @xmath3 , and arbitrary bundle @xmath12 .",
    "the second issue arises when we look for representations : if @xmath10 admits more than one representation , which one are we going to choose to carry out the dirac quantization program ?",
    "our result here will hold in a more specific setting than our definition of the algebra @xmath10 : we will show that in the case of _ diffeomorphism invariant theories _ which induces , by the bundle projection @xmath13 , all the diffeomorphisms of @xmath9 homotopic with the identity map .",
    "] , upon restricting to diffeomorphism invariant representations , this issue will not arise : we find a unique cyclic representation    in the following , let us explain the two results of the paper a bit more in detail and relate them to what has already been achieved elsewhere .    * the classical algebra : * for the sake of informal presentation ,",
    "let us choose a ( local ) trivialization of the bundle @xmath12 and use the notation of field theory .",
    "( the main part of the paper will be kept in the geometric and algebraic style . )",
    "then the phase space consists of pairs @xmath14 of fields defined on @xmath15 , where : @xmath16 @xmath17 is a differential 1-form taking values in the lie algebra @xmath18 of the gauge group @xmath3 and @xmath19 @xmath20 is a vector density of weight @xmath21 taking values in @xmath22 , the dual vector space to @xmath18 .",
    "the non - vanishing poisson relations between the fields evaluated at points can be written as @xmath23 where in a local coordinate system @xmath24 in @xmath15 and in a basis @xmath25 of @xmath18 the fields are decomposed into @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( @xmath28 denote the dual basis ) .",
    "the first question to ask is which functionals of @xmath17 and @xmath20 should be quantized .",
    "a very natural answer is obtained by considering the geometric nature of the fields @xmath17 and @xmath20 : @xmath17 is a 1-form on @xmath9 and therefore integrals of @xmath17 along 1-dimensional submanifolds are well defined .",
    "@xmath20 on the other hand , as a vector density of weight one can be turned into a pseudo @xmath29-form @xmath30 ( still @xmath22 valued ) using the totally antisymmetric symbol , namely @xmath31 .",
    "hence it can be integrated over @xmath29-dimensional hyper - surfaces of @xmath9 . asking in addition for simple transformation behavior of the functionals of @xmath17 upon a change of trivialization , that is with respect to @xmath32 where @xmath33 is an arbitrary ( locally defined ) @xmath3 valued function in @xmath15 ,",
    "one is led to consider functionals depending on @xmath17 via the wilson loop functionals @xmath34=\\mathcal{p}\\left(\\exp -\\int_\\alpha    a\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is a path in @xmath15 .",
    "a similar requirement applied to the canonical conjugate field @xmath20 leads to the flux - like variables @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a @xmath29-dimensional surface and @xmath38 is a function of compact support on @xmath37 . starting from the bracket these variables can be endowed with a lie algebra structure with a remarkable geometric flavor which was systematically explored in @xcite : the functions @xmath39 depending on @xmath17 via the wilson loop functionals only form the algebra of cylindrical functions and every flux variable @xmath40 acts as a derivation @xmath41 on this algebra , defined by the poisson bracket ) preserves the space of cylindrical functions and the dirac delta is absorbed completely by the integrations involved in the definitions of the holonomy and flux .",
    "this fact was pointed out for the first time in @xcite .",
    "the specific flux derivation used in this paper was defined in @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath42 this is also the approach we will use in the present paper .",
    "the product ( [ x ] ) is well defined provided that the intersection between the path @xmath35 with the surface @xmath37 contains finitely many isolated points . a simple condition that ensures this",
    "property uses a real analytic structure on @xmath15 , analytic paths and analytic surfaces .",
    "correspondingly , analytic diffeomorphisms of @xmath15 are among the natural symmetries inherited from @xmath15 that define automorphisms of the algebra of the basic variables .",
    "the analyticity requirement , however , breaks the local character of the non - analytic diffeomorphisms group .",
    "therefore , the most important difference to the treatment of the previous papers on the subject @xcite is that we will employ here a considerably larger group of symmetries .",
    "we will not require that the diffeomorphisms we consider be analytic everywhere but , roughly speaking , analytic only up to submanifolds of lower dimension .",
    "some care has to be taken in the precise definition of this notion , mainly to insure that they form a group and that application of these diffeomorphisms produce surfaces and edges that still have finitely many isolated intersection points .",
    "the important point is that this larger symmetry group now contains local diffeomorphisms , and this will be instrumental for proving the uniqueness result .",
    "a more technical difference as compared to the lqg literature is that , following @xcite , we will be working with arbitrary space - time dimensions and not assume a trivialization of the @xmath3-bundle .    * the quantum algebra : * the next step in the quantization program is to define the quantum algebra @xmath10 . stated in a heuristic way",
    ", we want to define an abstract @xmath0algebra of quantum objects @xmath43 , @xmath44 whose relations reflect @xmath16 the multiplicative structure of the functions of the wilson loop functionals and the derivations , and @xmath19 the complex conjugation structure of the functions of the wilson loop functionals and the flux functionals .",
    "such an algebra has been defined in @xcite on various levels of rigor and abstraction .",
    "here , we will reach an equivalent , precise definition by using intuition from geometric quantization .",
    "* representations , uniqueness : * after one has defined the quantum algebra @xmath10 , according to the dirac quantization program @xmath10 has to be represented on a hilbert space , the constraints have to be implemented as operators , and solutions to the constraints have to be found .",
    "generically , @xmath10 will admit an infinite number of inequivalent representations , so it is an important question which one of them is the right one to use .",
    "ultimately , this question can only be answered by exhibiting one or more representations in which the program can be followed through to the end , leading to a bona fide quantization of the theory .    however , there are clearly more and less natural choices of representations to try first : most importantly , if the classical theory has symmetries that act on @xmath10 by a group of automorphisms then it is natural to try to find a representation in which these automorphisms are unitarily implemented .",
    "a second natural idea is to first look at irreducible or at least cyclic representations as the simple building blocks , out of which more complicated representations could eventually be built .",
    "finally , if @xmath10 is not a banach - algebra , one has to worry about domain questions and it is somewhat natural to consider representations first that have simple properties in this respect .",
    "a simple formulation of these properties can be given by asking for a state ( i.e. a positive , normalized , linear functional ) on @xmath10 that it is invariant under the classical symmetry automorphisms of @xmath10 .",
    "given a state on @xmath10 one can define a representation via the gns construction .",
    "this representation will be cyclic by construction .",
    "furthermore , by construction it has a common invariant dense domain for all the operators representing elements of @xmath10 . finally , if the state is invariant under some automorphism of @xmath10 , its action is automatically unitarily implemented in the representation .",
    "in this article , we will investigate the class of representations of @xmath10 delineated above in a special case , namely if the theory under consideration is invariant under diffeomorphisms of the manifold @xmath9 in the trivial bundle case , and automorphisms of the bundle in the general case .",
    "most prominently , this is the case for gravity , written in terms of connection variables , as used in loop quantum gravity .",
    "it follows from @xcite , that for the case of interest for loop quantum gravity , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , a state with these properties exists . the corresponding representation has subsequently served as a cornerstone in the lqg program .",
    "moreover , this representation can be immediately generalized to arbitrary dimension and arbitrary compact gauge group .",
    "therefore the requirements above do not reduce considerations to the empty set .",
    "however , it is an important question for the lqg program , and at least an interesting mathematical question in general , whether there exist other representations with these properties .",
    "our analysis will show that this is not the case : the only state that is invariant under the group of diffeomorphisms described above is the one used in lqg .",
    "this is a more satisfying result than the ones obtained in @xcite .",
    "however it relies heavily on the enlargement of the symmetry group of a state not used in earlier publications .",
    "+ while work on this manuscript was in progress , similar results as the ones that we will present here have been obtained in @xcite .",
    "the technical setup of @xcite differs somewhat from the one used here , and we refer to section [ concl ] for a comparison .",
    "the goal of this section is a definition of the @xmath0-algebra @xmath10 of basic , quantum observables .",
    "we have already mentioned the algebra in the introduction and explained its meaning , in this section we will give a complete definition .",
    "as indicated , in our approach we will base all definitions on a new category of manifolds that is larger than the analytic category but smaller than the @xmath47-times differentiable one .",
    "the technical definitions and proofs in this respect are relegated to the appendix .",
    "let us start here by giving a more intuitive description , justification for this enlargement and outline of the properties relevant in our paper .",
    "in this work we consider a @xmath48-dimensional differential manifold @xmath9 .",
    "the differentiability class @xmath49 is fixed , @xmath50 .",
    "our elementary variables  already mentioned in the introduction and carefully defined in the following sections  are constructed by using curves ( later called edges ) and co - dimension one submanifolds ( faces ) of @xmath9 . a necessary condition for the poisson bracket between the variables to be finite",
    "is that every edge intersects every face in at most finite number of isolated intersection points plus a finite number of connected segments ( i.e. edges in themselves ) . to ensure this condition we need to carefully define a class of curves and submanifolds we consider",
    ". it will be also important that the class be preserved by a sufficiently large subgroup of the diffeomorphisms of @xmath9 .",
    "` large ' means that the subgroup contains sufficiently many diffeomorphisms that act non - trivially only within compact regions .",
    "this is not the case , for example , for the analytic diffeomorphism group that has usually been considered in this context .",
    "we solve this technical issue by defining an appropriate category of manifolds we will call semianalytic .",
    "next , we assume that the manifold @xmath9 is equipped with a semianalytic structure .",
    "henceforth , all the local maps , diffeomorphisms , submanifolds and functions thereon , are assumed to be @xmath49 and semianalytic .",
    "a semianalytic structure is weaker than an analytic one , therefore it can be determined on @xmath9 for example by choosing an arbitrary analytic structure .    briefly",
    ", ` semianalytic ' means ` piecewise analytic ' .",
    "for example , a semianalytic submanifold would be analytic except for on some lower dimensional sub - manifolds , which in turn have to be piecewise analytic . to convey the idea , figure [ faceexam ] depicts a semianalytic surface in @xmath51 .",
    "however , whereas in the case of @xmath52 ` piecewise analytic ' has a well established interpretation , in a higher dimensional case those words admit a huge ambiguity . therefore in the appendix",
    "we introduce exact definitions and prove relevant properties .",
    "we heavily rely on the theory of the semianalytic sets developed by ojasiewicz @xcite .",
    "the special property of the semianalytic category so relevant for us in this paper , is that the intersection between every two connected submanifolds , locally , is a finite union of connected submanifolds .",
    "of course , this is also true in the analytic case .",
    "but the difference between the analytic and the semianalytic structures is in the local character of the later ones .",
    "technically , the locality is expressed by the fact that every open covering of @xmath9 admits a compatible semianalytic partition of unity .",
    "let us recall from the appendix that by _ semianalytic edge _ we mean a connected , 1-dimensional semianalytic submanifold of @xmath9 with 2-point boundary .",
    "an edge is an oriented embedded 1-dimensional c@xmath53 submanifold of @xmath9 with a 2-point boundary , given by a finite union of semianalytic edges .    over the manifold",
    "@xmath9 we fix a principal fiber bundle @xmath54 the structure group of @xmath12 is denoted by @xmath3 , and it is assumed to be compact and connected .",
    "the right action of @xmath3 on @xmath12 will be denoted in the usual way as @xmath55 .",
    "we are assuming the bundle is semianalytic .",
    "on @xmath12 we consider the space of the connections @xmath1 .    given an edge @xmath56 , a connection @xmath57 defines a bundle isomorphism @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the beginning and end points of @xmath56 , and the fibers of @xmath12 are considered as pullbacks of the bundle @xmath12 .",
    "the space @xmath61 of all the bundle isomorphisms @xmath62 ( in fact , @xmath61 depends on the points @xmath59 and @xmath60 only ) can be mapped in a 1 - 1 way into @xmath3 , @xmath63 and the map , called a gauge map , is defined by a choice of two points , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , and by @xmath66 therefore , it is determined up to the left and right multiplication in @xmath3 by arbitrary elements @xmath67 , corresponding to changing the points @xmath68 and @xmath69 . in this way",
    "@xmath61 inherits every structure of @xmath3 which is left and right invariant ( including the topology , the differential manifold structure , the haar measure ) .",
    "a function @xmath70 is called cylindrical if there exists a finite set @xmath71 of edges and a function @xmath72 such that for every @xmath57 @xmath73 in this case , we say that @xmath74 is compatible with @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "every cylindrical function is compatible with many sets of edges .",
    "without lack of generality , we may assume that @xmath75 is an embedded graph , that is , if two edges @xmath77 intersect , then the intersection is contained in the boundary of each of them @xcite .",
    "the semianalyticity assumption used in the definition of the edges is sufficient . ]",
    "the boundary points of edges constituting a graph @xmath75 are called the vertices of @xmath75 .",
    "it is easy to see , that all the cylindrical functions set up a subalgebra of the algebra of all the complex valued functions defined on @xmath1 ; we denote it by @xmath78 . in a natural way it admits definition of an involution and a norm @xmath79",
    "the space of connections is considered here a configuration space . however , promoting the cylindrical functions to the basic position variables on @xmath1 ( an over - complete set of variables ) is equivalent to embedding @xmath1 into the gelfand spectrum of the unital c@xmath81-algebra @xmath82 defined as the completion of @xmath83 .",
    "elements of the gelfand spectrum of @xmath82 have a geometric interpretation of generalized ( or distributional ) connections on @xmath1 .",
    "we recall now definition of the generalized connections ( see @xcite for a recent review , and @xcite for the origins ) .",
    "consider the space @xmath84 of all the edges in @xmath9 including the trivial one .",
    "certain pairs @xmath85 can be composed , yielding a new edge .",
    "more precisely , let the beginning point of @xmath56 be the end point of @xmath86 , then we define @xmath87 _ provided the result is again an edge _ , where the line stands for the completion , and the beginning ( end ) point of @xmath88 is defined to be the beginning ( end ) point of @xmath56 ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "if @xmath86 differs from @xmath56 in orientation only , then @xmath89 is trivial , hence we will also use the notation @xmath90 for the edge @xmath56 with orientation reversed .",
    "on the other hand , from the principal fiber bundle @xmath12 , for pairs of points @xmath91 one has the bundle isomorphisms @xmath62 , and those from @xmath92 to @xmath93 can be composed with those from @xmath93 to @xmath94 , yielding isomorphisms again .",
    "a generalized connection @xmath95 on @xmath12 assigns to every edge @xmath56 a bundle isomorphism @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the beginning ( source ) of the edge @xmath56 , and @xmath98 is its end ( target ) , such that @xmath99 whenever @xmath89 is defined .",
    "we denote the space of generalized connections by @xmath80 .",
    "every cylindrical function @xmath74 is naturally extendable to @xmath80 , by using a compatible graph @xmath75 and function @xmath76 ( see ( [ cyl ] ) ) , namely @xmath100 ( the result defines a unique function on @xmath80 , independent of choice of the compatible @xmath75 and @xmath76 . ) given any @xmath101 , the map @xmath102 is continuous in @xmath103 and defines a c@xmath104-algebra homomorphism , that is an element of the gelfand spectrum .",
    "moreover , every element of the gelfand spectrum can be represented by a generalized connection in that way @xcite . in this way",
    "we identify the spectrum with @xmath80 .",
    "the ashtekar - isham quantum configuration space for the loop quantization of the theory of connections defined on @xmath12 is the space @xmath80 of the generalized connections .",
    "given a finite dimensional manifold as a configuration space , and the cotangent bundle as the phase space , the momenta correspond to the tangent vector fields and there is available an elegant geometric quantization scheme .",
    "this idea is easily generalized to an infinite dimensional @xmath1 , but for the quantization , one would need a measure on @xmath1 in our case required to be invariant with respect to the automorphisms of the bundle @xmath12 . instead , ashtekar and isham defined @xmath80 and proposed to embed @xmath1 in @xmath80 because the latter has naturally defined compact topology and is therefor easier to treat .",
    "however , @xmath80 does not have a manifold structure .",
    "nonetheless , the fluxes of the electric field and the corresponding derivations ( [ x ] ) defined in @xmath78 do lead to a quite precise definition of a generalized vector field tangent to @xmath80 .",
    "we introduce it in this subsection in a geometric , manifestly trivialization invariant way .",
    "we define now on @xmath80 generalized vector fields which correspond to the derivations ( [ x ] ) , that is to the smeared fluxes of the frame field @xmath20 .",

    "now we make use of lemma [ le1 ] from section [ statesgns ] : the state ( [ omegacyl ] ) is actually continuous with respect to the c@xmath81-norm on @xmath180 . thus , using the representation theorem by riesz and markow , there exists a measure @xmath388 on @xmath80 such that @xmath389 notice now that lemma [ fun ] implies what follows @xmath390\\,,\\ , [ \\widehat{x_{s , f}(\\psi')}]\\ , \\right\\rangle}_{{\\mathcal{h}}_\\omega}\\\\ & = i{\\left\\langle\\ , [ \\hat{\\psi}]\\,,\\ , [ \\hat{x}_{s , f}\\hat{\\psi}']- [ \\hat{\\psi}'\\hat{x}_{s , f}]\\ , \\right\\rangle}_{{\\mathcal{h}}_\\omega}\\\\ & = i{\\left\\langle\\ , [ \\hat{\\psi}]\\,,\\ , [ \\hat{x}_{s , f}\\hat{\\psi}']\\ , \\right\\rangle}\\\\ & = i{\\left\\langle\\ , [ \\hat{x}_{s , f}\\hat{\\psi}]\\,,\\ , [ \\hat{\\psi}']\\ , \\right\\rangle}\\\\ & = - \\int_{{\\overline{\\mathcal{a } } } } \\overline{x_{s , f}(\\psi ) } \\psi'\\,d\\mu.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] setting @xmath391 ( i.e. the constant function on @xmath80 of the value @xmath21 ) we see that for any face @xmath37 and any smearing vector field @xmath107 and for any function @xmath392 @xmath393 as it was shown in @xcite the only measure satisfying the above condition coincides with the measure defined on @xmath80 by the state @xmath268 described in the example .    in conclusion ,",
    "as we have emphasized the uniqueness result proved in the last section is reassuring for the lqg program , and it shows that diffeomorphism invariance can sometimes be a powerful remedy against complications that one expects based on what one knows about background dependent field theories .",
    "our result is based on certain , albeit reasonable , assumptions , therefore an immediate question is whether it can be generalized .",
    "certainly the result holds for any enlargement of the symmetry group that contains the diffeomorphisms considered above . whether it also holds for smaller extensions , or even for only the analytic diffeomorphisms is an open question .",
    "we feel however that as soon as the subgroup of diffeomorphisms is big enough to contain local ones , application of the techniques used above should be straightforward .",
    "also , even if uniqueness were to break down if only invariance under analytic automorphisms is required , it is not clear how relevant the result would be physically , as it would heavily involve details of the structure of analytic diffeomorphisms on a given manifold @xmath9 .",
    "another way to generalize the result would be to consider , instead of the flux operators , the unitary groups that they generate , and ask for diffeomorphism invariant representations in which these groups are strongly continuous . in @xcite",
    "this setting was considered , however the results were not satisfactory due to the more complicated domain questions arising .",
    "a more satisfying result was recently obtained by fleischhack in @xcite . it does not make the assumption of a common dense domain for all flux operators and cylindrical functions that is implicit in our treatment .",
    "however , it needs an additional assumption on the action of the bundle automorphisms in the representation .    finally , as for background dependent theories",
    ", at least the definition of the kinematical algebra @xmath10 applies in principle . whether one expects the type of variables used , to be well defined in the quantum theory is certainly a difficult question .",
    "still it seems worthwhile to look for non - diffeomorphism invariant representations of @xmath10 and see if they can be put to use in physics .",
    "another interesting starting point for future work is the observation that the uniqueness theorem fails if a rather innocent looking assumption  that of compact support on @xmath37 for the smearing functions @xmath107 used in the flux variables @xmath40  is removed : consider the example @xmath395 , @xmath396u(1 ) , and drop the assumption of compact support for the smearing functions .",
    "the hyper - surfaces @xmath37 are one dimensional in this case .",
    "let us also choose an orientation for @xmath9 . from that orientation , together with the orientation on the normal bundle of a given @xmath37",
    "we can equip @xmath37 with an intrinsic orientation , and thus integrate one - forms on @xmath37",
    ". then we can define @xmath397 it is easy to check that @xmath210 defines a state on @xmath10 and is manifestly invariant under the action of orientation - preserving diffeomorphisms .",
    "obviously it is different from @xmath268 and thus would constitute a counterexample to our uniqueness result , were it not for the fact that for smearing functions @xmath107 with compact support in @xmath37 , @xmath398=0 . hence under the assumptions made in this paper , @xmath399 , and there is no contradiction .",
    "since obvious generalizations of this state to a higher dimensional situation seem to fail , the existence of @xmath210 for smearing functions without compact support might just be a peculiarity of @xmath400 .",
    "however , just as for @xmath210 the endpoints of the lines @xmath37 can be used to `` anchor '' diffeomorphism invariant information in the state , it is not inconceivable that similarly points of the boundary of hyper - surfaces @xmath37 in which the boundary has a lower differentiability than @xmath49 might be used to that end in higher dimensions . in any case",

    "<S> loop quantum gravity is an approach to quantum gravity that starts from the hamiltonian formulation in terms of a connection and its canonical conjugate . </S>",
    "<S> quantization proceeds in the spirit of dirac : first one defines an algebra of basic kinematical observables and represents it through operators on a suitable hilbert space . in a second step , </S>",
    "<S> one implements the constraints . </S>",
    "<S> the main result of the paper concerns the representation theory of the kinematical algebra : we show that there is only one cyclic representation invariant under spatial diffeomorphisms .    </S>",
    "<S> while this result is particularly important for loop quantum gravity , we are rather general : the precise definition of the abstract @xmath0-algebra of the basic kinematical observables we give could be used for any theory in which the configuration variable is a connection with a compact structure group . </S>",
    "<S> the variables are constructed from the holonomy map and from the fluxes of the momentum conjugate to the connection . </S>",
    "<S> the uniqueness result is relevant for any such theory invariant under spatial diffeomorphisms or being a part of a diffeomorphism invariant theory . </S>"
