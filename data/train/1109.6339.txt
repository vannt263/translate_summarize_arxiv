    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , even large spectroscopic surveys like the sn ia progenitor survey ( spy ) have limited success in identifying merger systems @xcite .",
    "many of the radial velocity variables in spy and other surveys turn out to be low - mass wds @xcite .",
    "only 24 double wd systems were known in 2005 , and all but three have primary wds with @xmath30.5@xcite .",
    "the galaxy is not old enough to produce low - mass wds through single star evolution , but they can form in unusual systems ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "the majority of low - mass wds are found in binary systems @xcite , where the progenitor main - sequence stars experience enhanced mass - loss during one or two common - envelope phases .",
    "hence , low - mass wds are prime targets for discovering short period merger systems .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have established a radial velocity program , the elm survey , to search for companions around known extremely low - mass ( @xmath40.2 ) wds in the sdss data release 7 footprint and the mmt hypervelocity star survey @xcite .",
    "so far , the elm survey has identified 12 wd merger systems , tripling the number of systems known @xcite .",
    "depending on the unknown mass ratios , these systems may be the progenitors of stable mass - transfer am cvn binaries , single helium - rich subdwarfs , extreme helium stars , or underluminous sne .",
    "the elm survey is also responsible for finding the first tidally distorted wd j0106 @xcite and the 12 min orbital period detached , eclipsing binary wd system j0651 @xcite .",
    "these two systems , j0106 and j0651 , are currently the only known detached binary wd systems with periods shorter than 1 hr . all other known binary wd systems with @xmath5 1 hr are in interacting am cvn systems .    here",
    "we present the discovery of a new detached binary wd system with @xmath5 1 hr found in the elm survey .",
    "j1630 was recognized as a low - mass wd in the sdss dr4 wd catalog @xcite .",
    "our follow - up radial velocity observations demonstrate that j1630 contains a pair of wds with an orbital period of only 39.8 minutes . in section 2",
    "we describe our spectroscopic and photometric observations . in sections 3 and 4",
    "we constrain the physical parameters of the binary and discuss the nature and future evolution of j1630 .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in section 5 .",
    "we used the 6.5 m mmt with the blue channel spectrograph to obtain medium resolution spectroscopy of j1630 on ut 2011 march 1 and april 22 - 23 .",
    "we operate the spectrograph with the 832 line mm@xmath6 grating in second order , providing wavelength coverage from 3600   to 4500   and a spectral resolution of 1.2  .",
    "j1630 has @xmath7 mag .",
    "we started our observations with 400 s exposures , but reduced the exposure time to 300 s after detecting significant velocity variations in back - to - back exposures .",
    "we obtain all observations at the parallactic angle , with a comparison lamp exposure paired with every observation .",
    "we flux - calibrate using blue spectrophotometric standards @xcite , and we measure radial velocities using the entire spectrum in the range 3700 - 4430   and the cross - correlation package rvsao .",
    "the details of our data reduction procedures are discussed in @xcite .    realizing that j1630 has a period similar to the tidally distorted wd j0106 , we acquired high speed photometric observations of j1630 to search for eclipses and ellipsoidal variations .",
    "we used the mcdonald 2.1 m otto struve telescope with the argos frame transfer camera @xcite over 1 night in 2011 may and 3 nights in 2011 july .",
    "we obtained 1819 images of j1630 with a 1 mm bg40 filter and 15 or 30 s exposures for a total exposure time of 9.6 hr .",
    "table 1 lists our radial velocity measurements for j1630 . we compute best - fit orbital elements using the code of @xcite . to verify the uncertainty estimates , we perform a monte carlo analysis using 10000 sets of simulated radial velocities ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we adopt the inter - quartile range in the period and orbital elements as the uncertainty .",
    ".radial velocity measurements for j1630 [ cols=\"^ , > \" , ]     j1630 exhibits radial velocity variations with a semi - amplitude of @xmath8 and orbital period of @xmath9 d , or 39.8 @xmath10 0.1 min .",
    "figure 1 shows the best - fit orbit compared to the observed radial velocities . due to our relatively long exposure times",
    ", our data do not sample the velocity curve well near maximum and minimum .",
    "thus , we underestimate the velocity semi - amplitude . to correct for this underestimate , we sample a sine curve at the exact 21 phases of our observations with @xmath11 long integrations .",
    "we recover the exact period , but @xmath12 is systematically underestimated by 2.7% .",
    "thus , the corrected velocity semi - amplitude is @xmath13 . with this correction",
    ", j1630 has a mass function of @xmath14 .",
    "the systemic velocity ( after subtracting the gravitational redshift of 7.6 ) is @xmath018.7 @xmath10 3.8  and the time of spectroscopic conjunction is hjd 2455622.024130 @xmath10 0.000097 d.      @xcite derive @xmath15 k and @xmath16 from the low - quality sdss spectrum of j1630 .",

    ", we also perform fits to the individual spectra .",
    "we find a best - fit solution of @xmath19 k and @xmath20 from the composite spectrum .",
    "fitting only the balmer lines , we obtain @xmath21 k and @xmath22 . these results are consistent with each other and the previous @xmath23 and @xmath24 estimates within the errors .",
    "the best - fit model using the continuum shape provides a slightly better fit to the sdss photometry ( figure 2 ) and we adopt that model for the remainder of the paper .",
    "we note that all of the studies described above are done using @xcite models .",
    "@xcite find a systematic offset of @xmath25 dex between their analysis and the analysis done using @xcite models .",

    "based on the improved @xcite tracks ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for elm wds , the visible wd in j1630 is a 160 myr old 0.30 @xmath10 0.02  wd with a radius @xmath27 .",
    "its absolute magnitude @xmath28 corresponds to a distance of 0.7 kpc .",
    "based on five epochs from the usno - b and the sdss , @xcite measure a proper motion of ( @xmath29 ) mas yr@xmath6 .",
    "j1630 is 0.5 kpc below the galactic plane and it has @xmath30 , and @xmath31 km s@xmath6 with respect to the local standard of rest @xcite .",
    "j1630 is a disk star .",
    "the mass function implies a companion mass of @xmath2 0.30 .",
    "such a main - sequence companion would have been detected in the sdss photometry .",
    "therefore , the companion is a compact object .",
    "based on the mass function alone , the probability of a neutron star ( 1.4 - 3.0 ) companion is 5% .",
    "however , no milli - second pulsar companions are detected in the radio @xcite .",
    "hence , the companion is very likely another wd .",
    "figure 3 shows the fourier transform ( ft ) of the j1630 light curve .",
    "the light curve is affected by low frequency sky noise due to the changes in the atmosphere and the color differences between the wd and the reference stars .",
    "the middle panel shows the ft pre - whitened by the main peak in the top panel .",
    "there are many aliases , but the highest peak is at the orbital period ( dashed line ) .",
    "the ft for the brightest comparison star ( bottom panel ) does not show any significant variations at the same frequency .    0.2 mhz .",
    "after pre - whitening , the strongest peak is at the orbital period of the binary ( dashed line ) .",
    "no significant peak is observed at the same frequency for the comparison star.,width=326 ]    figure 4 shows the argos light curve of j1630 ( top panel ) folded over the best - fit orbital period of 39.8 min .",
    "the bottom panel shows the same light curve binned into 100 orbital phase bins . unlike j0106 and j0651",
    ", j1630 does not show any significant ellipsoidal variations .",
    "the amplitude of the ellipsoidal effect is roughly @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the orbital semi - major axis and @xmath34 is the radius of the primary @xcite .",
    "even though j0106 and j1630 have almost the same orbital period , j1630 is about a factor of two more massive and a factor of two smaller in size compared to j0106 .",
    "therefore , the expected amplitude of the ellipsoidal variations is @xmath350.1% , consistent with the observations .",
    "we expect to see @xmath360.24% amplitude sinusoidal variations due to the relativistic beaming effect . fitting a sinusoid ,",
    "the lightcurve is best explained by 0.17% @xmath10 0.05% variations at the orbital period ( see the bottom panel in figure 3 ) .",
    "these variations are consistent with the expected beaming signal .",
    "to verify that the observed variations in the light curve are not a statistical fluctuation , we perform a bootstrap analysis .",
    "we create 10000 synthetic light curves by random sampling with replacement from the observed light curve .",
    "this analysis shows that the probability of measuring a random signal with @xmath20.17% amplitude at the orbital period is 2% .",
    "based on figures 3 and 4 and our statistical analysis , the doppler boosting signal is likely detected in j1630 .",
    "however , the boosting signal does not provide any new physical constraints on the properties of this binary .",
    "along with j0106 and j0651 , j1630 is only the third detached wd binary known to have a period shorter than an hour .",
    "all three were discovered in the last year as part of the elm survey .",
    "previously , all known systems with @xmath37 hr were interacting am cvn systems .",
    "we do not see any evidence of mass transfer ( no emission lines and no obvious excess continuum ) in the three targets mentioned above .",
    "the primary wds in j0106 and j0651 both show ellipsoidal variations due to their larger size and shorter orbital periods .",
    "these variations are extremely useful for constraining the inclination angle of the systems .",
    "however , j1630 does not show any significant ellipsoidal variations , and we only have an upper limit on the inclination angle due to the lack of eclipses .",
    "for the companion to avoid detection in the sdss photometry and our spectroscopy implies that it is @xmath38 fainter than the visible wd . for an edge on orbit ,",
    "such a companion would have @xmath39 , @xmath40 k , and @xmath41  @xcite .",
    "a total eclipse would be @xmath4270% deep and last for about 1.8 minutes .",
    "the lack of eclipses in the photometry constrain the inclination angle to @xmath1 .",
    "hence , j1630 is best explained by a binary system containing a 0.30  wd with a @xmath430.30  wd companion at a separation of @xmath20.32 .",
    "the two wds in the j1630 binary will merge in @xmath4231 myr due to gravitational wave radiation @xcite .",
    "after j0651 , j1630 is currently the second quickest wd merger system known . when the mass transfer starts , j1630 will most likely have unstable mass transfer due to the mass ratio of its components being close to unity @xcite .",
    "however , the merger outcome is uncertain because of the unknown inclination angle and the companion mass .",
    "if the companion is another he - core wd , the merger will likely create a single he - burning subdwarf in 23 - 31 myr .",
    "if the companion is a more massive carbon / oxygen core wd , the system will merge in @xmath4223 myr to form a rapidly rotating massive wd ( see * ? ? ? * for other possibilites ) .",
    "short period binary wds are important gravitational wave sources . for example , the 12 minute orbital period binary j0651 should be detected by lisa within its first week of operation @xcite .",
    "similarly , the previously discovered 39 min orbital period system j0106 may be detected by lisa after 1 yr of observations . with an orbital period similar to j0106",
    ", j1630 is also a promising candidate for detection . for an average inclination angle of 60@xmath44 and model - dependent distance of 0.7 kpc",
    ", we expect the gravitational wave strain at earth @xmath45 at a frequency @xmath46 ( hz ) = @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "this is at the s / n = 5 detection limit of lisa after 1 year of observations .",
    "we report the discovery of a new 40 min orbital period detached binary wd system , j1630 . along with the previously discovered 12 min and 39 min orbital period systems , j0651 and j0106 ,",
    "j1630 is only the third known detached binary wd system with a period less than an hour .",
    "all three systems are excellent gravitational wave sources to be detected by lisa .",
    "j1630 is almost a twin of the 39 min orbital period system j0106 .",
    "however , due to its smaller size and larger mass , significant ellipsoidal variations are neither expected nor detected in its light curve .",
    "therefore , the inclination angle of the system can not be constrained accurately with the current data .",
    "follow - up high - speed photometric observations at a larger telescope will be useful to constrain the doppler boosting signal more accurately and to search for grazing eclipses .",
    "the two wds in this system will merge in less than 31 myr and likely form a single subdwarf star or a rapidly rotating massive wd .",
