    "why and how galaxies stop their star formation activities and then move from the `` blue cloud '' to the `` red sequence '' ( the so - called `` quenching procedure '' ) is a key question in the studies of galaxy formation and evolution . in literature , at least two factors are proposed to affect quenching : galaxy stellar mass and environmental conditions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , it is still far from a comprehensive understanding of the detailed quenching picture .    in the color - magnitude ( or the color - mass diagram ) , the green valley is a narrow region connecting the `` blue cloud '' and `` red sequence '' @xcite .",
    "the galaxies in gv were thought to be the transition populations between the star - forming and the quenched galaxies @xcite , hence holding important clues to the consequence led by the quenching procedure . in a recent paper , @xcite showed that the color distributions of gv etgs on the @xmath0 versus .",
    "@xmath7 diagram can be modeled by a quenching time scale of @xmath8 gyr , while for the bulk of ltgs a longer quenching time scale is required ( @xmath9 gyr ) .",
    "this study suggests that morphology is another factor which can affect the detailed quenching processes in galaxies .",
    "recent works have found that quenching is connected with remarkable bulge growth @xcite , regardless of its detail working mechanism .",
    "it is thus necessary to investigate in which part the quenching procedure first take place in a galaxy .",
    "recently , @xcite found the specific star formation ( ssfr ) re - normalized by disk stellar mass ( formulated by @xmath10 ) are weakly dependent on disc masses . in their work , `` mass quenching '' was interpreted as more massive galaxies have larger bulge mass fractions@xmath11the portion of a galaxy not forming stars .",
    "thus when investigating how quenching is processing in galaxies , it will be more reasonable to treat galaxies as composite systems , rather than integrated mass , if the data allows to do so .",
    "spatial resolved study on the residual star formation in a gv galaxy may shed light on how quenching is processing in a galaxy .",
    "large surveys such as sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite and _ galaxy evolution explorer ( galex ) _",
    "@xcite survey have provided a large sample of local galaxies to facilitate such kind of studies . in a previous work , @xcite have investigated the @xmath12 color profile in a sample of low redshift etgs and found that roughly 30% of them show positive color gradients , which is consistent with the existence of central star formation . since the emissions in the uv bands are more sensitive to recent star formation than that of the optical bands , in this letter , we use _ _ galex__+sdss data to study the radial uv - optical color distributions in a sample of low redshift face on gv galaxies , and to investigate how the residual star formation activities distribute in transition galaxies . throughout this letter",

    "this sample is magnitude completed to @xmath20 ab mag and with galaxy zoo @xcite visual morphological classifications .",
    "the stellar masses are derived by fitting the five sdss photometric bands to a library of 6.8@xmath21 models star formation histories generated from @xcite stellar models .",
    "we follow the process of @xcite to select gv galaxies .",
    "first the galaxies are k - corrected to @xmath22 using the kcorrect code of @xcite with the sdss five broad - band photometry .",
    "then the magnitudes are corrected for dust reddening using estimates of internal extinction from the stellar continuum fits by @xcite , applying the @xcite law . then the gv is defined on the dust - corrected color - mass diagram for all galaxies , given @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the k - corrected @xmath0 color index and @xmath25 is log stellar mass , respectively .",
    "this criterion is stricter than that of @xcite to ensure that our samples are not contaminated by the blue cloud and red sequence galaxies . with this criterion ,",
    "about 700 etgs and 3000 ltgs are classified as gv galaxies . to ensure that their radial color distributions can be robustly measured , only galaxies with @xmath26 are selected .",
    "the remaining sample contains about 300 etgs and 700 ltgs .",
    "the _ galex _ nuv image has a resolution of 1 pixel=@xmath27 and a point spread function ( psf ) with full width at half - maximum ( fwhm)=@xmath28 .",
    "the pixel size and psf of sdss image are @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively . to ensure that the photometric measurements are consistent across the different bands , we need to transform all the images to the same geometry and effective resolution before doing photometry .    following @xcite s pipeline , a uv - optical matched photometric catalog",
    "have been generated by li et al .",

    "the psf kernel function was obtained by fitting a two - dimensional gaussian function to the stacked star stamps in the corresponding _ galex _ nuv frame .",
    "the psf - convolving procedure on the sdss images was done by running immatch / psfmatch task in iraf .",

    "the psf - matched photometry have been compared with the sdss public data .",
    "good consistency is found between the sdss c - model magnitudes and the auto magnitudes we measured .",
    "finally , the magnitudes are corrected for galactic extinction using the galactic dust map @xcite .",
    "we cross - match the gv sample selected in section 2 with the uv - optical matched catalog and obtain 117 etgs and 219 ltgs . among these",
    ", 9 etgs and 13 ltgs classified as seyfert galaxies on the bpt diagram are rejected @xcite .",
    "the final sample containing 108 etgs and 206 ltgs will be used to investigate their nuv - optical radial color distributions in the next section .",
    "in fig . 2 we show the radial dust - corrected sdss @xmath0 color distributions .",
    "the dust correction on the colors is done by using a single e(b - v ) value ( drawn from @xcite ) at all radii , as it is difficult to know how extinction vary at different radii .",
    "the radii are normalized by @xmath31 , the radii enclosed 50% sdss r - band petrosian fluxes .",
    "to present the results more clearly , we divide the sample into two subsamples , according to their @xmath32 . @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the color indices measured in the central @xmath35 aperture and that of the whole galaxy , respectively .",
    "a galaxy having @xmath36 means that its color in the core is bluer than that of the whole .",

    "etgs also have more compact morphologies and approximately 35% of our etgs have @xmath40 .",
    "so the measurements of the outer colors in these small - size etgs will be seriously contaminated by the background and not reliable . for the @xmath41 galaxies ,",
    "we show their color profiles in grey lines .",
    "note that rejecting these small - size galaxies will not affect our main conclusions on the radial color distributions .",
    "however they will be kept to maintain a large etg sample size .",
    "24 out of 108 etgs are blue - cored , as shown in the upper left panel in fig .",
    "this fraction is significantly larger than that of ltgs , which is only 28/206 . for the red - cored subsamples ,",
    "we find their color profiles are different between etgs and ltgs : most etgs show very mild color gradient out to 3@xmath31 ( @xmath42 for etgs ) , whereas ltgs colors decrease when r>0.5@xmath31 .",

    "nuv@xmath3 is a widely explored color index in literature @xcite .",
    "interestingly , this figure shows dramatically different features compared to the @xmath0 color distributions . for etgs , we find 68/108 of them having inner - blue nuv@xmath3 colors , e.g. their recent star formation are concentrated in the central regions .",
    "the rest show very flat nuv@xmath3 color profiles .    for ltgs , more than 90% of them",

    "their nuv@xmath3 colors monotonously decrease beyond r@xmath40.5@xmath31 , which can be interpreted by red bulges plus blue disk components that are still actively forming stars .",

    "is the color profile we measured on an image with a @xmath43 psf robust ?    to answer this question ,",
    "we have done a test on the simulated images . for each galaxy",
    ", we use its sdss r - band image to simulate its corresponding image in the nuv band . to be simplified , here",
    "we only discuss the simplest case .",
    "first the sdss r - band image is degraded to @xmath44/pixel to match the nuv resolution . the nuv flux at the radius @xmath45 of the simulated image ( @xmath46 )",
    "is then given : @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the flux at @xmath45 on the sdss r - band image and @xmath49 is a given gradient value , respectively . by definition ,",
    "the nuv@xmath3 color at @xmath45 is : @xmath50 .",
    "the value @xmath51=3.5 is the median color at galactic centers , which is directly taken from fig .",
    "another set of image , namely the simulated psf - convolved image , are also created by convolving the image we simulated to the nuv psf .",
    "finally we measure the nuv@xmath3 color index on the two sets of simulated images to investigate how the psf will impact on the output color profile .",
    "we select a ltg with @xmath52 and show the result in fig .",
    "4 . in the upper and lower panels",
    ", we simulate a color profile with a steep and a mild gradient , respectively .",
    "interestingly , we find the shape of output color profile looks quite similar to those measured on the real images . for both cases , we find that the color profiles measured on the simulated psf - convolved image _ are basically consistent _ with the prior given profiles",
    ". the color profile is smoothed at galactic centers by the psf , as seen in fig .",
    "we find that the color deviation becomes evident at @xmath53 , which is likely owing to the low surface brightness at the radii larger than @xmath1 . to conclude , we find the color profile for a @xmath54 galaxy is _ not seriously _ modified by the nuv psf , and our result are of high robustness .      ) vs. ew(h@xmath5 ) .",

    "ew(h@xmath5 ) diagram .",
    "it can be seen that the bulk of gv galaxies have weak h@xmath5 emissions , i.e. , ew(h@xmath56)<10  , showing that the star formation rate is low in the core of gv galaxies . in the subsection above we have found that a large fraction of etgs have blue - cored nuv@xmath3 colors .",
    "interestingly , in fig .",
    "5 we find that nearly half of etgs have ew(h@xmath5)>6.0  , confirming that they have star formation in the core regions .",
    "we call galaxies with ew(h@xmath5)>6.0   as `` h@xmath5 emitter '' in the following .",
    "this fraction is significantly lower in ltgs , indicating that the residual star formation in ltgs are mostly attributable to the galactic disc .",
    "the star formation strength was found to link with galaxy mass , as demonstrated by the famous star - forming `` main sequence '' @xcite .",
    "we have check whether the different core ew(h@xmath56 ) distributions in etgs and ltgs are due to their different mass distributions .",
    "the sample is divided into two subsamples according to their stellar mass .",
    "the dividing mass threshold is set to log@xmath57=10.2 , the mass that can roughly separate galatic properties into two main groups @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath5 emitter fraction is @xmath58 and @xmath59 in the low and high mass etg subsamples , respectively .",
    "the fractions is @xmath60 and @xmath61 in the ltgs , respectively .",
    "thus the different ew(h@xmath5 ) distributions between etgs and ltgs can not be explained by their different mass distributions .    under the @xmath13cdm paradigm , an etg is formed through hierarchical mergers .",
    "the e+a galaxies , also called post - starburst galaxies , are considered as the products of galaxy interactions and the progenitors of red etgs . in fig .",
    "4 , the box enclosed ew(h@xmath62)>3.0   and ew(h@xmath56)<6.0   defines our e+a selection criterion . it can be seen that most e+a galaxies have early - type morphologies , although the number of ltgs are significantly larger than etgs .",
    "however , even in gv etgs , e+a galaxies only compose a rather small fraction , suggesting that most red etgs may not undergo the e+a phases in their past .",
    "our main finding is that gv etgs have dramatically different radial nuv@xmath3 color distributions compared to ltgs .",
    "a larger fraction of etgs have blue cores , both represented by @xmath0 color and nuv@xmath3 color .",
    "more than a half of etgs show blue - cored nuv@xmath3 colors and the remainders have flat color distribution out to @xmath1 .",
    "compared to etgs , nearly all ltgs have uniform color profiles that can be well interpreted as a red bulge plus a blue disk component .",
    "the more fraction of central star formation in etgs than in ltgs are confirmed by the sdss spectra .",
    "we will discuss our findings in this section .",
    "the inner - blue phenomenon in etgs is not first reported by us but have been mentioned in some previous works @xcite .",
    "it is likely attributable to a starburst or its residual in the galactic center . under the @xmath13cdm paradigm ,",
    "a major merger of two gas rich ltgs will induce gas inflow to trigger central starburst @xcite .",
    "strong starburst will soon be suppressed by agn feedback and the star formation shut down quickly , then produce an e+a remnant , as predicted by models @xcite .",
    "interestingly , @xcite found roughly 50% blue etgs show merger features in deep images , supporting this scenario .",
    "some previous studies also found a large fraction of e+a galaxies show very obvious interaction features @xcite .",
    "however , the e+a population only compose a very small portion of the total gv etgs .",
    "we suggest most red etgs may not undergo the e+a phases in their past .    the star formation in the cores of etgs can be alternatively explained by the contribution of a `` cooling flow '' @xcite . in the x - ray observations , some etgs have relatively lower temperature in the core regions and can induce gas inflow .",
    "the inflow of cool gas can fuel an agn or trigger star formation activity in the center of etgs .",
    "this picture explains the star formation in the center without the need of a strong starburst triggered by a merger .",
    "we find most gv ltgs host inactive cores and blue disk components .",
    "the central masses of ltgs can be built either by secular evolution @xcite or the central starbursts .",
    "@xcite found that ltgs with strong bars either have enhanced central star formation rates , or star formation that is suppressed compared to the mean .",
    "@xcite found that redder ltgs are more likely to have bars .",
    "these findings suggest that the central mass build up and the subsequent quench in a portion of ltgs is likely driven by bars .",
    "other mechanisms such as galaxy interactions are needed to explain the quenched ltgs without bars .",
    "the color gradient of ltgs is consistent with inside - out disk growth scenario .",
    "@xcite found evidence that disk galaxies follow an inside - out disk growth model . in this model , the hi gas",
    "are accreted onto the outer disc and form new stars , through which the disk galaxy grow up .",
    "the long quenching time scale required for a ltg as modeled in @xcite is likely due to the long time scale of removing / exhausting the cool gas on its gaseous disk .",
    "however , we note that several ltgs have inner - blue color profiles .",
    "we have check their sdss images and found , 4/9 of them have visible tidal interaction features . among these ,",
    "one is classified as an e+a galaxy .",
    "thus the central star formation in these ltgs is likely driven by galaxy interactions .",
    "the rest have much smaller bulge components than most ltgs and their sdss spectra show relative strong h@xmath5 emission lines .",
    "thus they are possibly in the process of bulge building .",
    "however , the fraction of blue - cored ltgs is so small and will not hamper our final conclusion .",
