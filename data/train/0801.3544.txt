    "dust influences the environment from which it forms by consuming elements from the gas phase . hence",
    ", dust selectively alters the local metallicity in the atmosphere of a brown dwarf as well as in planetary atmospheres ( woitke & helling 2004 , helling , woitke & thi 2008 ) .",
    "dust clouds furthermore efficiently absorb photons which can result in @xmath0m - broad absorption features ( helling et al .",
    "2006 , 2007 ; cushing et al .",
    "2006 , burgasser et al .",
    "the absorbed energy is redistributed inside the lattice structure of the solid grain causing an isotropic irradiation of ir photons into the atmosphere , a process , which considerably alters the atmospheric temperature profile ( tsuji et al .",
    "1996 , tsuji 2005 , ackerman & marley 2001 , allard et al .",
    "both processes , the selective alteration of local element abundances and the changing atmospheric temperature , have a distinct influence on the gas - phase chemistry which determines the atomic and molecular concentrations .",
    "these intricate effects are important even for elements not or only marginally involved into the dust formation process as we will show in this letter .",
    "alkali lines are dominant features in the optical spectrum of brown dwarfs and the far line wings of the most abundant alkali metals , sodium and potassium , determine the pseudo - continuum in this spectral range ( johnas et al .",

    "another alkali , li , is used to determine fundamental parameter of substellar objects ( e.g. martin , rebolo & maguzza 1994 , johnas et al .",
    ". they all can be a powerful tool to study the cloud formation in substellar objects if combined with an atmosphere simulation which allows to correlate the line profiles with an analysis of the atmosphere regarding the @xmath1 structure ( @xmath2 - gas temperature , @xmath3 - gas pressure , @xmath4 - convective velocity ) and the chemistry .    in this letter",
    "we show that the modelling of dust formation has a strong impact on the line shapes and the depth of the na  i and k  i alkali lines in dust - enshrouded l - dwarfs .",
    "we utilise our kinetic model for dust cloud formation in atmosphere simulations of substellar objects ( brown dwarfs and extrasolar planets ) in comparison to two limiting cases in order to demonstrate the sensitive dependence of alkali line profiles on the local @xmath5 profile ( @xmath6 - element abundance ) of the atmosphere .",
    "we show that the treatment of dust cloud formation has a much stronger impact on the alkali line profiles than the details of the line profile calculation .",
    "we present our studies based on simulations carried out with the general purpose model atmosphere code ` phoenix ` , version 15 , ( hauschildt & baron 1999 ) .",
    "we combine the study of line profiles of johnas ( 2007 ) with the kinetic dust cloud modelling by ( helling & woitke 2007 ) which has recently been incorporated into ` phoenix ` by dehn ( 2007 ) ( also dehn et al .",
    "we concentrate here on the following two different line profile approaches for which the model atmospheres are calculated :    * impact  line profiles : + van der waals profiles applying the impact approximation for near line wings ( schweitzer et al .",
    "1996 ) * modern1  line profiles :   + detailed non - analytical , semi - classical line profiles ( allard et al . 2005 , allard & spiegelman 2006 , johnas et al .",
    "2006 ) including h@xmath7 in two symmetries , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and he as perturber .",
    "the alkali line profiles are represented by two terms , one describing the near line wing with the impact approximation ( baranger 1958b , royer 1971 ) and the other describing the far line wing with the one  perturber approximation in the density expansion ( royer 1971 ) .    for our study of the influence of different dust model approaches on alkali line profiles ,",
    "we compare simulations for the two limiting cases cond and dusty ( allard et al .",
    "2001 ) , and our new drift module ( dehn et al . 2008 ) which includes a detailed modelling of dust formation :    * cond approach : + the cond approximation assumes the dust to be in chemical and phase equilibrium with the surrounding gas phase .",
    "the dust is ignored as opacity source because it is _ assumed _ that after the dust grains have formed they sink down below the photosphere , thus resulting in a depleted gas phase with no dust absorption or emission .",
    "this scenario was used to model t - type brown dwarfs ( e.g. lodieu et al .",
    "2007 ) or planetary objects ( e.g. seifahrt et al . 2007 ) with t@xmath10 lower than @xmath111400k but does not allow to consider the cloud _ formation _ process .",
    "these models are not realistic for the parameter range considered here and are included for comparison only . *",
    "dusty approach : + the dust is assumed to have formed in chemical and phase equilibrium , as in the cond models but is _ assumed _ to remain at the place of formation . in both cond and dusty , the amount of elements bound in grains is subtracted from the gas phase .",
    "no dust settling is taken into account .",
    "the interstellar grain size distribution is used for the dust opacity calculation .",
    "dusty models were used at higher t@xmath12 representing the case of a thick cloud layers inside the atmosphere of l - dwarfs ( e.g. leggett et al .",
    "2001 ) and do not consider the actual formation process .",
    "* drift approach : + the drift package ( dehn et al .",
    "2008 ) is based on a kinetic treatment of dust formation ( woitke & helling 2003 , 2004 ; helling & woitke 2006 ; helling , woitke & thi 2008 ) .",
    "a stationary dust formation process is assumed for application in static model atmospheres . in these model atmospheres , seed particles ( here :",
    "tio@xmath7 ) nucleate from the gas phase if an appropriate super - saturation is achieved , subsequently grow a mantle made of various compounds ( sio@xmath7[s ] , al@xmath7o@xmath13[s ] , fe[s ] , mgo[s ] , mgsio@xmath13[s ] , mg@xmath7sio@xmath14[s ] , and tio@xmath7[s ] ) by 32 chemical surface reactions ( dehn 2007 ) , settle gravitationally , and evaporate .",
    "the dust formation cycle is completed by convective overshooting of uncondensed material which is modelled by an exponential decrease of the mass exchange frequency into the radiative zone ( ludwig et al .",
    "the material composition of the grains , the amount and the size of dust particles formed  which are needed to evaluate the cloud s opacity in the radiative transfer calculation  are results of our model .",

    "figure  [ fig : dt - p ] shows that the atmospheric @xmath21structures are very similar for @xmath22bar for drift - phoenix and dusty - phoenix models , but can differ by up to 300k ( i.e. 30% ) at lower pressures .",
    "all models agree well in the innermost atmospheric layers .",
    "the drift - phoenix temperature gradient is steeper compared to the dusty - phoenix case .",
    "the drift - phoenix model structure falls basically between the two limiting cases dusty and cond .",
    "the different line profiles cause negligible differences in the @xmath21structures for all three cloud models ( johnas 2007 ) .",
    "in addition to the @xmath21structures in fig .",
    "[ fig : dt - p ] , the flux contribution function @xmath23 ( see fuhrmeister et al .",
    "2006 ) of each of the simulations is shown at 5880  which is a line wing wavelength in the nai  d@xmath7 resonance line ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dnak ] ) .",
    "the maximum of @xmath23 is correlated to the location in the atmosphere at which the line wing is formed at that specific wavelength ( magain 1986 , fuhrmeister et al .",
    "note , however , that @xmath23 should only be considered for strong lines like nai and ki .",
    "figure  [ fig : dt - p ] demonstrates that in general the naid@xmath7 line wings at 5880 form at comparable local gas pressures in the model atmospheres despite the different dust cloud approaches considered here .",
    "we furthermore find that na and k appear with comparable concentrations in the line forming regime in all models ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pnak ] ) .",
    "_ this leaves the local temperature as only candidate for potential differences in the na  i and k  i line profile for different dust cloud treatment . _",
    "figure  [ fig : driftmodimp ] shows that the low resolution drift - phoenix spectrum for two different line profile setups will basically differ in the optical and near - ir region which is , hence , the spectral region predominantly influenced by the line profile treatment .",
    "although one might have expected more effects in larger spectral ranges , the relative changes shown in the bottom - panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : driftmodimp ] are relatively small . on the contrary ,",
    "the differences in the low - resolution spectra between the different dust approaches ( drift , dusty ) for fixed line profile treatment are quite remarkable ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mod1dd ] ) .",
    "these strong differences are no surprise because the atmospheric @xmath24structures differ substantially ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dt - p ] ) , and therefore the amount of molecular opacity carriers does change .",
    "for example , dusty - phoenix produces a tio - concentration of two orders of magnitude less than drift - phoenix at @xmath25bar .",
    "the temperature - dependent gas - phase composition does also influence the dust formation by providing the constituents from which the dust forms .",
    "we find similar discrepancies when comparing spectra between drift - phoenix and cond - phoenix models ( not shown ) .              the classical dusty - phoenix simulation result in a lower pseudo  continuum for both , the naid and ki doublets compared to the drift - phoenix results ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dnak ] ) .",
    "the dusty - phoenix models have a higher dust opacity than the drift - phoenix models which results in strongly differing @xmath24-structures .",
    "hence , also the line shapes for the naid and ki doublets differ considerably .",
    "it appears that the local gas pressure and the concentration of na  i and k  i are very similar in the line forming region in these models but large differences occur in the local temperatures .",
    "comparing fig .",
    "[ fig : cond ] visualises that the cond - phoenix line profiles match up with the drift results better in the far wings since here the differences in the local temperature are somewhat smaller ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dt - p ] ) .",
    "generally , the drift - phoenix atmosphere simulations , which are based on a detailed kinetic cloud model , yield a stronger pseudo - continuum and deeper line cores .",
    "the similarity of the alkali partial pressures especially between the drift and dusty approach point to the local temperature as main cause for the large differences in the line - profiles .",
    "all figures show that _ the observable line shapes depend more on the dust model than on the line profile model . _",
    "we have demonstrated that the dust treatment in an atmosphere simulation for substellar objects has a large influence on the resulting line - profile of the alkalies na  i and k  i. we conclude that the main cause for these large differences is the strongly changing local temperature which is directly linked to the dust treatment by the resulting dust opacity .",
    "the different treatments of the alkali line profiles result in negligible changes compared to the effect of dust treatment .",
    "the pseudo - continuum of alkali line - profiles are strongest if based on a microphysical dust model taking into account the kinetic nature of dust formation ( drift - phoenix ) .",
    "this findings may foster studies on li  i and rb  i lines since johnas ( 2007 ) has shown that in particular the far k  i line wings can mask the rb  i doublet , but",
    "both the na  i and the k  i overlap the li  i doublet cores .",
