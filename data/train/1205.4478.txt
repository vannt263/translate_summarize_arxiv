    "hexagonal manganites ( the space group @xmath4 ) are one of canonical examples of multiferroics , which have attracted an enormous attention recently .",
    "the coexistence of ferroelectricity and magnetism in such systems provides a unique possibility for manipulating the charges by applying a magnetic field and the spins by applying a voltage , which is crucially important for the construction of new forms of multifunctional devices.@xcite to this end , the direct magnetic phase control by static electric field was realized in homno@xmath0.@xcite the interplay between the ferroelectric activity and the magnetic order was also demonstrated in ymno@xmath0 and lumno@xmath0 with the measurements of the dielectric constant and the loss tangent , which were shown to exhibit clear anomalies around the nel temperature ( @xmath5@xmath6 75 k and 88 k in ymno@xmath0 and lumno@xmath0 , respectively),@xcite even despite the fact that the ferroelectric transition itself occurred at much higher temperature ( @xmath7@xmath8 k).@xcite another spectacular example is the coupling of magnetic and ferroelectric domains , which was visualized in ymno@xmath0 by using optical second harmonic generation technique.@xcite furthermore , the magnetic transition in ymno@xmath0 and lumno@xmath0 is accompanied by a distinct change of the atomic positions.@xcite thus , the experimental data clearly demonstrates the existence of a strong coupling amongst electric , magnetic , and lattice degrees of freedom in these hexagonal manganites .",
    "the magnetic frustration is one of the key concepts of multiferroic materials , which may assist the inversion symmetry breaking and , in a number of cases , be even responsible for such a breaking.@xcite in this respect , the hexagonal lattice is not an exception , and is typically regarded as a playground for studying the magnetic frustration effects .",
    "however , it is also the main complication , hampering the theoretical understanding of multiferroic effects in hexagonal compounds , even despite the fact that the high - spin state ( @xmath9@xmath6@xmath10 ) , realized in manganites , is typically regarded as an `` easy case '' for such theoretical analysis , where the classical the spin fluctuations dominate over the quantum ones .",
    "nevertheless , the ground state of classical spins in the hexagonal lattice is expected to be highly degenerate .",
    "different signs of spin fluctuations , apparently originating from this degeneracy , were indeed observed in the neutron scattering experiments , even below @xmath5.@xcite another evidence of spin fluctuations , which is also related to the quasi - two - dimensional character of magnetic interactions , is the large ratio of the curie - weiss temperature ( @xmath11 ) to @xmath5 ( about 7 in ymno@xmath0).@xcite    the degeneracy can be lifted by lattice distortions and , in this context , plenty of attention is paid to the so - called trimerization instability , inherent to the @xmath4 structure.@xcite however , the trimerization alone does not lift the frustration of isotropic exchange interactions . in this sense ,",
    "the situation is fundamentally different from the exchange striction effect , which accompanies the formation of the @xmath12-type antiferromagnetic ( afm ) state in the orthorhombic ymno@xmath0 and which lifts the frustration of nearest - neighbor ( nn ) interactions.@xcite nevertheless , the trimerization can interplay with the relativistic spin - orbit ( so ) coupling and , in this way , give rise to new anisotropic interactions , which can lift the degeneracy and stabilize some individual magnetic structure with the well - defined symmetry .",
    "such structures were detected in the experiments on the neutron diffraction ( ref .  ) and optical second harmonic generation ( ref .  ) . in a number of cases ( e.g. , in lumno@xmath0 )",
    ", there can be several magnetic structures , coexisting in a narrow temperature range.@xcite in short , despite difficulties , there is an enormous experimental progress in the identification of magnetic structures of hexagonal manganites , resulting from a delicate balance between lattice distortion , so interaction , and frustration effects .",
    "the microscopic understanding of rich magnetic properties of the hexagonal manganites is still rather limited . to begin with",
    ", there is no clear microscopic model , which would explain the origin of basic magnetic structures of hexagonal manganites , and why different manganites tend to form different magnetic structures .",
    "basically , it is only known how the trimerization affects the nn isotropic interactions.@xcite the presence of single - ion anisotropy and dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interactions is , of course , anticipated .",
    "however , it is absolutely not clear how all these effects come together to form a variety of magnetic structures , realized in the hexagonal manganites .    in this paper",
    ", we will try to answer some of these questions . for these purposes ,",
    "we consider two characteristic manganites : ymno@xmath0 and lumno@xmath0 , which form different magnetic structures in the ground state : @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively ( in the international notations , where each underlined symbol means that given symmetry operation is combined with the time inversion ) .",
    "we will show that this difference can be naturally related to different directions of the trimerization : expansion and contraction of the mn - trimer , which takes place in ymno@xmath0 and lumno@xmath0 , respectively . in our study , we start from the first - principles electronic structure calculations .",
    "first , we construct a low - energy electronic model , which captures details of the magnetic structure and correctly reproduces the magnetic ground state of ymno@xmath0 and lumno@xmath0 .",
    "then , we analyze these results by further transforming the electronic model into the spin one and elucidating which magnetic interaction is responsible for each detail of the magnetic structure .",
    "we will also consider the ` temperature effect ' , associated with the temperature change of the experimental crystal structure , and show that above @xmath5 it gradually diminishes the anisotropic interactions .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "all methodological aspects , such as construction of the electronic model and calculation of magnetic interactions , are discussed in sec .",
    "[ method ] .",
    "results of solution of the electronic model in the hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation are presented in sec .",
    "[ mstructures ] . in sec .  [ minteractions ] , we give a detailed analysis of the obtained results in terms of magnetic interactions , which were computed using different starting points . in sec .",
    "[ polarization ] , we discuss the magnetic part of the ferroelectric polarization and propose how it can be controlled by switching the magnetic state . finally , a brief summary of the work is given in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "since our goal is the construction of microscopic theory for the magnetic properties of ymno@xmath0 and lumno@xmath0 , we first adopt the low - energy model , which would provide a realistic description for the mn @xmath3 bands of these compounds : @xmath13 the model is constructed in the basis of wannier orbitals , using the input from the first - principles electronic structure calculations .",
    "each wannier orbital is denoted by the greek symbol , which itself is the combination of spin ( @xmath14@xmath6 @xmath15 or @xmath16 ) and orbital ( @xmath17@xmath6 @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20@xmath21@xmath22 , @xmath23 , or @xmath24@xmath21@xmath25 ) variables .",
    "since the mn @xmath3 bands in hexagonal manganites are well separated from the rest of the spectrum,@xcite the construction of the model hamiltonian ( [ eqn.manybodyh ] ) is rather straightforward .",
    "the corresponding procedure can be found in ref .  .",
    "all calculations have been performed using experimental parameters of the crystal structure , measured at 10 k and 300 k ( ref .  , supplementary information ) , i.e. well below and above the magnetic transition point .",
    "the experimental space group @xmath4 has 12 symmetry operations , which can be generated by the mirror reflection @xmath26@xmath27@xmath21@xmath26 , @xmath28 , and the @xmath29-degree rotation around the @xmath30-axis , combined with the half of the hexagonal translation , @xmath31 .",
    "the crystal - field splitting , obtained from the diagonalization of the site - diagonal part of @xmath32 ( without spin - orbit coupling ) , is very similar in ymno@xmath0 and lumno@xmath0 .",
    "for example , if one uses the 10 k structure , we obtain the following scheme of the atomic levels : @xmath21@xmath33 , @xmath21@xmath34 , @xmath21@xmath35 , @xmath21@xmath36 , and @xmath37 ev in the case of ymno@xmath0 , and @xmath21@xmath38 , @xmath21@xmath39 , @xmath21@xmath40 , @xmath21@xmath36 , and @xmath41 ev in the case of lumno@xmath0 . the use of the 300 k structure yields similar results .",
    "clearly , the crystal field tends to stabilize four atomic orbitals , which are separated from the fifth one by the large energy gap .",
    "such a scheme of the crystal - field splitting is consistent with the formal @xmath42 configuration of the mn - ions , which is subjected to the jahn - teller instability .",
    "the fifth ( unoccupied ) orbital is of predominantly @xmath20@xmath21@xmath22 symmetry .",
    "the off - diagonal elements of @xmath32 with respect to the site indices stand for the transfer integrals .",
    "they are listed in ref .  .",
    "the value of the screened coulomb interaction @xmath43 ( defined as radial slater s integral @xmath44 ) is about @xmath45 ev for all considered systems .",
    "the intraatomic exchange ( hund s ) coupling @xmath46 is about @xmath47 ev , which is practically unscreened .",
    "the full matrices of screened coulomb interactions can be also found in ref .  .",
    "after the construction , the model is solved in the hf approximation.@xcite this procedure appears to be extremely useful , especially for the search of the magnetic ground state . typically , in frustrated magnetic systems",
    ", we are dealing with the competition of several magnetic interactions of the both relativistic and non - relativistic origin .",
    "therefore , even hf calculations for the relatively simple model ( [ eqn.manybodyh ] ) can be very time consuming , because they may require tends of thousands of iterations . in such a situation , the full scale electronic structure calculations are simply unaffordable .",
    "since the degeneracy of the ground state is lifted by the lattice distortion , the hf approximation appears to be a good starting point for the analysis of the equilibrium magnetic properties.@xcite    of course , the model ( [ eqn.manybodyh ] ) is not perfect , because it does not explicitly include the oxygen band , which can be important for the quantitative analysis of magnetic properties of manganites .",
    "therefore , whenever possible , we check results of our model analysis by direct calculations in the local - spin - density approximation ( lsda ) . for these purposes",
    ", we use the tight - binding linear muffin - tin - orbital method ( in the following we will refer to such calculations as ` lmto calculations').@xcite hopefully , in both cases we can employ the same strategy for calculations of magnetic interactions , which is based on the local force theorem and the green s function technique .",
    "namely , the isotropic exchange interactions ( @xmath48 ) can be obtained in the second order perturbation - theory expansion for the infinitesimal spin rotations,@xcite antisymmetric dm interactions ( @xmath49 )  by considering mixed type perturbation with respect to the rotations and the relativistic so coupling,@xcite and the single - ion anisotropy tensors ( @xmath50 )  in the second order with respect to the so interaction @xcite .",
    "the lmto calculations have been performed for the afm configuration @xmath51 , where the arrows stand for the directions of magnetic moments at the sites @xmath52-@xmath53 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.atomicpositions ] for the notations of atomic positions ) .",

    "the mn - trimers , which transform to each other by the symmetry operation @xmath31 , are shaded.,width=302 ]    the use of the afm configuration is essential in order to open the band gap in lsda ( about @xmath56 ev for ymno@xmath0 , which is comparable with the experimental optical gap of @xmath57 ev , reported in ref .  ) .",
    "certain inconvenience of working with the afm @xmath51 configuration is that it artificially lowers the @xmath4 symmetry : in this case , the local symmetry can by preserved only around the sites @xmath10 and @xmath58 , which will be selected as the reference points for the analysis of interatomic magnetic interactions .    in our lmto calculations we decided to stick to the regular lsda functional and not to use any corrections for the on - site coulomb interactions ( lsda@xmath59@xmath43 ) . on the one hand",
    ", such corrections can improve the description for interatomic magnetic interactions ( similar to the model ) . on the other hand , the use of the lsda@xmath59@xmath43 functional is always conjugated with some additional uncertainties in the calculations , related to the double - counting problem .",
    "furthermore , the example of lamno@xmath0 shows that lsda is a reasonably good starting point for the analysis of interatomic magnetic interactions.@xcite nevertheless , when we compare the lmto results with the model calculations we discuss possible consequences of the coulomb @xmath43 on the magnetic interactions in the former case .    due to the hybridization with the oxygen states , which is treated explicitly in the lmto calculations ,",
    "the value of spin magnetic moment at the mn - sites is reduced till @xmath60 @xmath61 .",
    "thus , some deviation of the local magnetic moment from the ionic value ( @xmath62 @xmath61 ) , which is typically seen in the experiment,@xcite can be attributed to the covalent mixing . in model",
    "hf calculations , similar effect can be described through the transformation from the wannier basis to that of atomic orbitals.@xcite",
    "we start with the central result of our work and argue that the low - energy model ( [ eqn.manybodyh ] ) , with the parameters derived from the first - principles electronic structure calculations,@xcite successfully reproduces the magnetic ground state of ymno@xmath0 and lumno@xmath0 .    the main candidates for the magnetic ground state of ymno@xmath0 and lumno@xmath0 are shown in fig .",

    "@xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath70 , the directions of the magnetic moments at the sites 4 , 5 , and 6 in the plane @xmath30@xmath6@xmath55 are obtained by the @xmath75 rotations around the @xmath30-axis of the vectors @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 . for the magnetic configurations",
    "@xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 , these @xmath75 rotations should be combined with the time inversion . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     they were obtained by considering mixed perturbation theory expansion with respect to the so interaction and infinitesimal rotations of spin magnetic moments.@xcite in principle , the parameters @xmath79 and @xmath80 are not independent and can be transformed to each other using symmetry operations of the space group @xmath4 . however , it is more convenient to consider their contributions independently . due to the mirror reflection @xmath26@xmath27@xmath21@xmath26 , the elements of two _ axial _",

    "thus , they will produce a finite canting at the site @xmath10 only if the directions of two other magnetic moments @xmath77 and @xmath78 would have an afm component along @xmath26 and a fm component along @xmath88 , i.e. : @xmath89@xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "such a situation is realized in the magnetic configurations @xmath64 and @xmath65 ( but not in @xmath63 and @xmath66 ) .",
    "then , the magnetic moment at the site 2 will experience the additional rotational force from the sites @xmath52 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 : @xmath94$]@xmath59@xmath95$]@xmath59@xmath96 $ ] .",
    "for the magnetic configurations @xmath64 and @xmath65 , the sites of the type ` @xmath97 ' will create the same rotational force : @xmath98 .",
    "however , for the @xmath63 and @xmath66 configurations , it holds @xmath99@xmath100 .",
    "therefore , these two contribution will cancel each other and there will be no canting of spins .    these rotational forces should be incorporated in the expression ( [ eqn : canting ] ) for the spin canting , which yields @xmath101@xmath102 .",
    "this canting is still smaller than @xmath103@xmath104 , obtained in the hf calculations for the @xmath65 configuration ( table  [ tab : directions ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , it should be noted that all the parameters of the spin hamiltonian ( [ eqn : spinmodel ] ) were evaluated using perturbation theory expansion near the collinear fm state , which is very far from the ground - state configuration @xmath65 .",
    "thus , it is difficult to expect that the perturbation theory , although is very useful for the semi - quantitative analysis , should be able to reproduce all details of the solutions of the electronic model ( [ eqn.manybodyh ] ) .",
    "in fact , some parameters of the spin hamiltonian ( [ eqn : spinmodel ] ) appear to be sensitive to the state , in which they are calculated .",
    "for example , we have also considered the collinear afm configuration @xmath51 , where the arrows stand for the directions of magnetic moments at the sites @xmath52-@xmath53 . in this case , the dm interactions involving the site @xmath10 , which is afm coupled with all nn spins in the @xmath18-plane , become ( in mev ) : @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107@xmath108 .",
    "then , corresponding rotational force @xmath109 will be about 2 times larger than in the fm state .",
    "meanwhile , the parameters of isotropic exchange interactions @xmath110 and @xmath111 decrease by about 15% .",
    "these factors will additionally increase @xmath72 .",
    "furthermore , the hf potential for the low - energy model ( [ eqn.manybodyh ] ) is orbitally dependent . in this cases ,",
    "the local force theorem is no longer valid.@xcite therefore , the total energy change due to the so interaction can be replaced only approximately by the change of the single - particle energies of the hf method . for the single - ion anisotropy , the situation was discussed in appendix b of ref .  .",
    "presumably , this is the main reason , explaining the quantitative difference between the results of the electronic and spin models .",
    "thus , these are typical uncertainties , supplementing the construction and analysis of the spin model ( [ eqn : spinmodel ] ) .    nevertheless , the local force theorem is valid within lsda . therefore , it is interesting to estimate the spin canting in the lmto calculations , which are based on the lsda functional . in this case ,",
    "all dm interactions become larger . for example , for ymno@xmath0 ( 10 k )",
    "we have obtained the following parameters ( in mev ) : @xmath112@xmath113@xmath114 , @xmath115@xmath116@xmath117 , and @xmath118@xmath119 .",
    "then , by combining them with corresponding parameters of the single - ion anisotropy @xmath120@xmath121 mev and isotropic exchange interactions @xmath110 and @xmath111 , which are listed above , we obtain the canting angle @xmath122@xmath123",
    ". thus , it is interesting that lsda , despite its limitation , provides the best starting point for the analysis of the spin canting via the perturbation - theory expansion for the spin - orbit interaction , due to validity of the local force theorem .",
    "similar situation was found in the orthorhombic lamno@xmath0.@xcite    thus , although derivation of parameters of spin model ( [ eqn : spinmodel ] ) may differ in details , depending on the form of the electronic hamiltonian , which is used as the starting point , as well as some additional approximations , underlying definitions of the model parameters , this analysis provides a clear microscopic basis for understanding the main difference between ymno@xmath0 and lumno@xmath0 : why the former tends to form the canted noncollinear magnetic structure @xmath65 , while the latter forms the planar structure @xmath66 .",
    "finally , we would like to comment on the behavior of electronic polarization @xmath124 .",
    "it was calculated within the berry - phase formalism,@xcite which was adopted for the model calculations.@xcite of course , the ferroelectric activity in ymno@xmath0 and lumno@xmath0 is primarily caused by structural effects .",
    "for example , in ymno@xmath0 , the ferroelectric transition occurs at about @xmath125 k,@xcite which is much higher than @xmath126 k.@xcite this fact was also confirmed by first - principles calculations.@xcite another appealing evidence is that the ferroelectric domains in ymno@xmath0 always coincide with the structural ones.@xcite nevertheless , beside this structural deformation , we have found that there is a substantial magnetic contribution to @xmath124 .",
    "more specifically , all magnetic configurations can be divided in two group .",
    "the first one includes @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath70 , where the magnetic moments in the planes @xmath30@xmath6@xmath54 and @xmath30@xmath6@xmath55 can be transformed to each other by the simple rotations .",
    "the second groups includes @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 , where these rotations should be additionally combined with the time inversion . according to our finding",
    ", the states in each group are characterized by nearly equal values of @xmath124 .",
    "however , the transformation of the magnetic state from one group to another would cause a finite jump of electronic polarization .",
    "thus , in principle , the value of the ferroelectric polarization can be controlled by changing the magnetic state ( and vice versa ) . in this sense , more promising candidate is ymno@xmath0 , where the ground state ( @xmath65 ) and the first excited state ( @xmath64 ) belong to different groups .",
    "the energy difference @xmath127 between these two configurations is about @xmath128 mev ( see table  [ tab : totale ] ) .",
    "then , the change of the ferroelectric polarization , associated with the change of the magnetic state @xmath65@xmath27@xmath64 , can be estimated as @xmath129@xmath130@xmath131 @xmath132c / m@xmath133 .",
    "the practical realization of such a switching phenomenon would be probably interesting , although it is not immediately clear , which external interaction could switch the magnetic state .",
    "formally speaking , the magnetic configuration @xmath64 could be stabilized by the external electric field @xmath134 , which couples to @xmath135 and results in the additional energy gain @xmath21@xmath136 .",
    "alternatively , one could exploit the fact that @xmath64 allows for a weak ferromagnetism along @xmath30 ( while @xmath65 does not ) and , therefore , could be also stabilized by interaction with the external magnetic field , @xmath21@xmath137 , which couples to the net magnetic moment @xmath138 ( @xmath139@xmath140 per mn - site ) .",
    "however , in order to overcome the total energy difference @xmath127 , this would require unrealistically large values of @xmath141 and @xmath142 , which can not be realized in practice .",
    "therefore , one should explore alternative possibilities .",
    "for example , from the viewpoint of microscopic interactions , one could use the competition of the nn and next - nn interactions between adjacent @xmath18-planes , which in the case of ymno@xmath0 act in the _ opposite _ direction ( see discussions above ) .",
    "the @xmath65 configuration is stabilized by the next - nn interactions . however , if one could find such macroscopic conditions , which would shift this balance towards nn interactions , one could switch the magnetic structure @xmath65@xmath27@xmath64 and , therefore , the ferroelectric polarization .",
    "another possibility is , of course , to exploit magnetism of the rare - earth ions , which can act similar to @xmath142 , but produces much stronger effect on the mn - sublattice .",
    "such a magnetic phase control was indeed realized experimentally in the series of hexagonal manganites with the magnetic rare - earth sublattices.@xcite",
    "using results of first - principles electronic structure calculations , we have established the low - energy model , which is able to capture basic magnetic properties of hexagonal manganites .",
    "this hubbard - type model describes the behavior of the mn @xmath3 bands , being subjected to the lattice deformation and on - site electron - electron interactions .",
    "all parameters of such model , derived from the first principles calculations for two characteristic manganites ymno@xmath0 and lumno@xmath0 , are summarized in ref .  .",
    "then , the model was solved in the hf approximation , by considering all possible noncollinear magnetic structures with different symmetries . since the magnetic frustration in the hexagonal @xmath4 lattice",
    "is lifted by the relativistic so interaction , the hf approximation provides a good starting point for the analysis of the magnetic properties of these compounds and successfully reproduce the experimental change of the magnetic ground state from @xmath1 to @xmath2 in the direction from ymno@xmath0 to lumno@xmath0 , which was observed in the neutron diffraction and nonlinear optical studies .    in order to clarify the microscopic origin of such a change",
    ", we have further transformed the electronic model into the spin one and discussed the same trend in terms of differences in the behavior of magnetic interactions in these systems .",
    "we have found that the main reason why ymno@xmath0 and lumno@xmath0 tend to form different magnetic structure is related to the behavior of the single - ion anisotropy , which couples to the trimerization distortion in the hexagonal plane and reflects different directions of this trimerization in ymno@xmath0 and lumno@xmath0 ( expansion and construction of the mn - trimers , respectively ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the interplane coupling in both compounds is controlled by the next - nn interactions , which is less sensitive to the direction of trimerization .",
    "the spin canting in the @xmath1 structure of ymno@xmath0 is a combined effect of both single - ion anisotropy and dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions , which act in the same direction . as the trimerization distortion decreases with the temperature",
    ", all anisotropic interactions also decrease , thus reviving the magnetic frustration and the degeneracy of the magnetic state .    finally ,",
    "using the berry - phase formalism , we have estimated the magnetic contribution to the ferroelectric polarization and discussed how it can be controlled by changing the magnetic structure of ymno@xmath0 .",

    "<S> then , we analyze this result in terms of interatomic magnetic interactions , which were computed using different approximations ( starting from the model hamiltonian as well as directly from the first - principles electronic structure calculations in the local - spin - density approximation ) . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the main reason why ymno@xmath0 and lumno@xmath0 tend to form different magnetic structures is related to the behavior of the single - ion anisotropy , which reflects the directional dependence of the lattice distortion : namely , the expansion and contraction of the mn - trimers , which take place in ymno@xmath0 and lumno@xmath0 , respectively . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic coupling between the planes is controlled by the next - nearest - neighbor interactions , which are less sensitive to the direction of the trimerization . in the @xmath1 structure of ymno@xmath0 , </S>",
    "<S> the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions lead to the spin canting out of the hexagonal plane  in the same direction as the single - ion anisotropy . finally , </S>",
    "<S> using the berry - phase formalism , we evaluate the magnetic - state dependence of the ferroelectric polarization , and discuss potential applications of the latter in magnetoelectric switching phenomena . </S>"
