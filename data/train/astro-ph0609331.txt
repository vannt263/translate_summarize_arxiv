    "when a fast astrophysical shock enters neutral interstellar gas , we see an optical spectrum that is dominated by h@xmath0 and other balmer lines and is nearly devoid of the forbidden lines typically seen in emission line nebulae .",
    "the balmer emission is caused by impact excitation of neutral hydrogen atoms by fast ions and electrons in the shocked gas .",
    "the emission lines in such `` balmer - dominated '' or `` non - radiative '' shocks have two components .",
    "the first is a narrow component with a line width characteristic of the cold interstellar gas , which results from direct excitation of the neutral hydrogen atoms .",
    "the second is a broad component with a line width characteristic of the thermal velocity broadening of the shocked protons .",
    "the broad component results from charge transfer reactions , which pass electrons from the nearly stationary hydrogen atoms to the shocked protons .",
    "the resulting fast hydrogen atoms may be created in excited states or may be excited by subsequent collisions with other fast ions and electrons . the resulting ratio of the broad to narrow components and the profiles of the broad balmer lines depend on the equilibration of electron and ion temperatures in the shocked gas , on resonance trapping of the lyman lines , and on the velocity and the inclination of the shock surface .",
    "the theory to interpret the emission spectra of such balmer - dominated shocks was developed originally by chevalier & raymond ( 1978 , hereafter cr78 ) and chevalier , kirshner & raymond ( 1980 , hereafter ckr80 ) and augmented by smith et al .",

    "generally , the theoretical models fit the observations fairly well , but significant discrepancies ( by factors @xmath2 ) between the theoretical and observed broad - to - narrow line ratios persist in some cases , as we shall discuss .",
    "supernova 1987a has provided a dramatic new example of a balmer - dominated shock .",
    "in contrast to the snrs cited above , broad balmer emission from snr 1987a comes from hydrogen atoms in the rapidly expanding ( @xmath3 km  s@xmath4 ) supernova debris rather than the stationary interstellar gas . in this case , the highest velocity component of the emission lines , called `` surface emission , '' results from the excitation of freely - streaming hydrogen atoms that cross the reverse shock .",
    "observations of the profiles of h@xmath0 and ly@xmath0 emission from the reverse shock with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) have enabled us to measure the rapidly evolving flux of hydrogen atoms across the reverse shock and to reconstruct partially the three - dimensional geometry of the shock surface ( michael et al .",
    "1998a , b , 2003 , with the last hereafter m03 ; heng et al .",
    "2006 , hereafter h06 ) .",
    "in addition to the surface emission , h06 identified a lower velocity component of the h@xmath0 and ly@xmath0 emission lines , which they called `` interior emission . '' evidently , this interior emission results from charge transfer of electrons from the freely - streaming hydrogen atoms to protons in the shocked gas and is analogous to the broad component seen in the balmer lines of other snrs .",
    "we also note that balmer - dominated bow - shocks have been observed in four pulsar nebulae ( bucciantini 2002 ) .    here",
    ", we revisit the theory of balmer - dominated shocks .",
    "we hope to resolve the discrepancies between observations and theory , to understand better how to interpret the line profiles , and to extend the existing theoretical models to the very high shock velocities seen in snr 1987a . in ",

    "[ sect : tree ] , we present a new formalism for deriving the intensities and the profiles of broad and narrow emission lines . in  [ sect : results ] , we compare our results to previous models and to existing data on balmer - dominated remnants and snr 1987a . finally , in  [",
    "sect : discussion ] , we discuss the limitations of the model and future development that is needed .",
    "the basic model we consider is a plane - parallel shock with velocity @xmath5 that strikes a stationary gas of cold neutral hydrogen and helium , with the latter having fractional abundance @xmath6 .",
    "( other elements that may be present with typical cosmic abundances will have no significant effects . )",
    "we assume that the shocked gas is fully ionized and that the ions and electrons comprise a fluid having a velocity @xmath7 relative to the shock frame .",
    "we assume that the ions and electrons have maxwellian velocity distributions .",
    "there is an uncertainty regarding the equilibration of post - shock ion temperatures .",
    "electrons and protons are heated to temperatures having a minimum ratio equal to that of their masses ( i.e. , @xmath8 ) .",
    "the coulomb equilibration time often exceeds the age of the remnant , in which case the temperatures will remain unequal throughout the transition zone where the neutral atoms become ionized .",
    "however , plasma waves and magneto - hydrodynamical turbulence at the shock front may transfer energy rapidly from protons to electrons .",
    "we consider two models . in the first , `` model f '' ,",
    "the electron and ion temperatures are fully equilibrated . in the second , `` model n '' , two - stream plasma instabilities produced by protons reflected upstream result in @xmath9 ( cargill & papapoulos 1988 ;",
    "see also references in g02 ) .",
    "following g02 , we define an equilibration parameter , @xmath10 , such that @xmath11,\\nonumber\\\\ t_e = \\frac{3 m_p v^2_s}{16 k } \\left [ \\mu f_{eq } + \\frac{m_e}{m_p}\\left(1 - f_{eq}\\right)\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the mean molecular weight . for example , @xmath13 for galactic abundances ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "consequently , @xmath15 for model f and @xmath16 for model n. we further assume that equilibration between the protons and the alpha particles occurs so rapidly that their post - shock temperatures are equal , namely @xmath17 .",
    "the most questionable assumption of this model is that the hydrogen atoms enter a shocked ion plasma having uniform density , velocity , and temperature given by the adiabatic jump conditions . in reality , the hydrogen atoms are ionized and excited in a transition zone where the ions are produced , decelerated , and heated .",
    "no model , including the present one , of emission from balmer - dominated shocks has included a proper description of this transition zone . in ",
    "[ sect : discussion ] , we discuss the consequences of this approximation further , deferring a more detailed treatment to a future paper .",

    "the distribution @xmath45 is not maxwellian because it includes factors of the relative velocity between the beam and the ions and the charge transfer cross section .",
    "for example , it has the value @xmath46 at the velocity of the initial beam .",
    "these new hydrogen atoms can in turn be excited , ionized , or undergo another charge transfer reaction .",
    "if they are excited , they will emit one or more photons and remain in the same distribution function .",

    "we must distinguish between the net charge transfer cross section , @xmath39 , and the cross sections , @xmath51 , for charge transfer reactions which leave the hydrogen atom in excited states ( and consequently produce photons ) .",
    "for the latter , we use the cross sections of barnett ( 1990 ) , who tabulates results for @xmath52 and @xmath53 . to obtain cross sections for @xmath54 , we use the scaling relation ( janev & smith 1993 ; c.d .",

    "we do not follow the evolution of these ions ; instead , we regard the reactions producing them as equivalent to impact ionization of hydrogen and include the corresponding cross sections as a contribution to the net impact ionization cross section .    examples of these cross sections are shown in figure [ fig : cross ] .",

    "however , for shock velocities @xmath69 2000 km s@xmath4 the net rate coefficients for excitation and ionization continue to increase , while the rates for charge transfer decrease rapidly .",

    "the observable quantities for balmer - dominated shocks are the profiles ( or widths ) of the broad lines , the velocity shifts between the peaks of the broad line and narrow lines , and the intensities of the broad and narrow lines .",
    "below , in ",
    "[ subsect : snr ] , we discuss the interpretation of these quantities for several well - known snrs in the light of the models described above and we compare our results to previous work . then , in  [ subsect : snr1987a ] , we discuss how our results may be used to interpret the emission from the reverse shock in sn 1987a .      as ckr80 and",
    "others have emphasized , we can infer the velocity , @xmath5 , of a balmer - dominated shock from the observed fwhm .",
    "our results are fairly close to previous ones .",
    "for example , for our fully equilibrated model f ( viewed edge - wise ) , and @xmath123 km s@xmath4 , we find fwhm @xmath124 km s@xmath4 ( fig . [ fig : fwhm1 ] ) , which may be compared to corresponding values in the literature : fwhm @xmath125 km s@xmath4 estimated from fig . 3 of ckr80 , fwhm @xmath126 km s@xmath4 estimated from fig . 7 of s91 , and fwhm @xmath127 km s@xmath4 estimated from fig . 9 of g01 .",
    "unfortunately , we have not been able identify the sources for the differences among these values .",
    "however , we note that there is a typographical error in equation ( 5 ) of ckr80 , which propagated into papers like kwc87 ; this was later corrected in s91 .    in table 1 ( column 3 ) , we list values of the fwhm of the broad h@xmath0 line measured in several snrs . note that values measured by different authors for a given snr do not necessarily apply to the same part of the shock front , so the differences among such measurements may be real .",
    "we also list in column 4 the range of shock velocities inferred by those authors by fitting their models to the observations .",
    "this range takes into account uncertainties both in the measured fwhm and in the model itself , with the lower values of @xmath5 coming from non - equilibrated models and the higher values from fully equilibrated ones . in columns 6 and 7",
    ", we list the values of @xmath5 that we infer by fitting our models to the same data .",
    "the values in column 6 are inferred from the non - equilibrated model n , while those in column 7 are from the fully equilibrated model f , and the errors in each case derive only from the errors in the measured values of the fwhm .",
    "( in making such fits , we used the model curve for edge - wise aspect , which we believe to be close to the actual situation in most cases . ) in general , we see that the values of @xmath5 inferred from our models are in fairly good agreement with those inferred by other authors , but that in some cases we infer values of @xmath5 that are lower than the original values by as much as 28% .",
    "the velocity offset , @xmath128 , between the centroids of the narrow and broad components is sensitive both to the shock velocity , @xmath5 , and the aspect angle , @xmath117 , of the shock .",
    "we can write @xmath129 where @xmath130 , the offset for a face - on shock , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fwhm1 ] . at low shock velocities ,",
    "the composite profile is virtually coincident with the maxwellian of the protons and so , to a very good approximation , @xmath131 .",
    "however , for @xmath66 km s@xmath4 , the composite profiles ( fig .",
    "[ fig : projdist ] ) begin to shift noticeably toward the narrow line , so that @xmath132",
    ".    it should be possible to infer the aspect angle of the shock by comparing the measured fwhm with @xmath133 .",
    "for example , kwc87 measured fwhm @xmath134 km s@xmath4 and @xmath135 km s@xmath4 in a filament in tycho s remnant . from this result and fig .",
    "[ fig : fwhm1 ] , we can infer @xmath136 km s@xmath4 and @xmath137 for model f , consistent with kwc87 s estimation of @xmath138 .",
    "of course , the observations will tend to select bright filaments that are viewed nearly edge - on .",
    "the measured ratio of broad to narrow line h@xmath0 intensities , @xmath139 , is listed in column 5 of table 1 . as first noted by ckr80 ,",
    "this ratio is sensitive to the optical depth in the in the lyman series . in choosing the cascade matrices in equations ( [ eq : halpha_n ] ) and ( [ eq : halpha_b ] ) , we consider two limits . in case",
    "a , all lyman transitions are optically thin . in case",
    "b , they are optically thick ; therefore , any ly@xmath1 photon that is emitted will be trapped until it splits into ly@xmath140h@xmath0 .",
    "likewise , ly@xmath141 must be converted to ly@xmath140h@xmath1 or ly@xmath140h@xmath142p@xmath0 , and so on . in balmer - dominated shocks , the narrow line emissivity of h@xmath0 for case b is increased by a factor @xmath143 compared to case a , and that of h@xmath1 by a factor @xmath144 .",
    "g01 modeled the ionization structure of the shock fronts in three snrs and performed monte carlo simulations of ly@xmath1 and ly@xmath141 trapping .",
    "they find that most of the broad lyman photons escape from the shock , but that narrow lyman photons are likely to be absorbed and converted into balmer lines both behind and ahead of the shock .",
    "therefore , for most snrs ( except snr 1987a ) , we are making a good approximation to adopt case a for the broad lines and case b for the narrow lines . for a theoretical upper limit on @xmath145 , we assume case a for both components .    in figure [",
    "fig : halpha ] , we plot the measurements of @xmath146 and @xmath5 inferred from the measured fwhm for several snrs .",
    "we do this for both the non - equilibrated model n and the fully equilibrated model f. as in columns 6 and 7 of table 1 , the uncertainties in the inferred @xmath5 are due entirely to the measurement errors .",
    "we also plot , for both models , the relationship @xmath146 _ vs. _ @xmath5 predicted by our theory , as well as the same relationship from equation ( 4 ) of s91 ( using our rate coefficients ) , @xmath147,\\ ] ] which follows from the model originally presented by ckr80 .",
    "the case a and b efficiencies ( @xmath148 and @xmath149 ) are given in cr78 , while we adopt the mean value of the fraction of charge transfers to excited states yielding h@xmath0 photons to be @xmath150 . in both cases , we assume case a for @xmath151 and case b for @xmath152 .",
    "one can see from figure [ fig : halpha ] that the data fit the models fairly well , and that our derived relationship of @xmath146 _ vs. _ @xmath5 does not differ very much from that derived by ckr . in the cases of sn 1006 , kepler and rcw 86 and 054870.4 ,",
    "the fits do not discriminate very well between models n and f , though model f provides a better fit to the cygnus loop than model n. the remnants of tycho and 0519 - 69.0 are marginally fitted by models f and n , respectively . with the exception of sn 1006 , we also note that the data can not be fit with a model in which case a applies to @xmath152 as well as @xmath151 . in that case ,",
    "the theoretical curves would be elevated by a factor @xmath143 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : halpha ] ) , and would not fit the data at all .",
    "we can make a similar comparison of theory to data with the h@xmath1 line .",
    "the corresponding fraction of charge transfer to excited states yielding h@xmath1 is estimated to be @xmath153 ( bates & dalgarno 1953 ) .",

    "however , for @xmath66 km s@xmath4 , these ratios do become quite sensitive to @xmath5 .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that the monte carlo simulations of g01 and g02 , which model lyman line trapping , result in tighter constraints on @xmath156 .",
    "snr 1987a has a double shock structure , consisting of a forward and a reverse shock .",
    "in contrast to other snrs , the balmer - dominated shock in snr 1987a comes , not from nearly stationary neutral hydrogen overtaken by the supernova blast wave , but from freely - expanding neutral hydrogen atoms in the supernova debris crossing the reverse shock .",
    "the debris crosses the reverse shock at velocities @xmath157 12,000 km s@xmath4 ( m03 ; h06 ) . in the frame of the observer ,",
    "the forward shock or blast wave is moving at between 3500 and 5200 km s@xmath4 ( manchester et al .",
    "2002 ; park et al . 2002",
    "; michael et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the reverse shock is moving at about 80% of the velocity of the forward shock ( m03 ) .",
    "hence , in the frame of the observer , the post - shock ions are relatively slow particles moving at velocities of between 5100 and 6120 km s@xmath4 .",
    "the `` shock velocity '' in this case is interpreted as the velocity of the freely - streaming hydrogen atoms in the rest frame of the reverse shock , i.e. , @xmath158 km s@xmath4 .    in the terminology of this paper , the `` narrow '' line emission resulting from excitation of hydrogen atoms initially crossing the reverse shock will have the greatest doppler shift , corresponding to the free - streaming debris . there is a unique mapping of the doppler shift of this narrow emission to the depth of the reverse shock measured from the midplane of the supernova debris along the line of sight . using the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) , m03 and h06 ( and references therein ) mapped streaks of high velocity emission in both h@xmath0 and ly@xmath0 in snr 1987a , which h06 called `` surface emission '' .",
    "this surface emission is evidently equivalent to narrow line emission from atoms crossing the reverse shock .",
    "h06 also detected h@xmath0 and ly@xmath0 emission from the same location having substantially lower doppler shifts than the surface emission .",
    "if that emission came from freely - expanding atoms in the supernova debris , those atoms would have to reside beneath the reverse shock surface .",
    "accordingly , h06 called this emission `` interior emission '' .",
    "that was an unfortunate choice of terminology .",
    "at least part if not all of this emission must come from more slowly moving hydrogen atoms immediately _ outside _ the reverse shock surface , which result from charge exchange reactions of hydrogen atoms in the supernova debris with protons in the shocked gas .",
    "this `` interior emission '' is analogous to the broad line emission in the terminology of this paper .    following m03 , we have adopted a model for snr 1987a having @xmath159 . as before ,",
    "we consider two variants , model n ( @xmath160 , @xmath161 ) and the fully equilibrated model f ( @xmath162 ) . in snr 1987a",
    ", the debris crossing the reverse shock has a sobolev optical depth @xmath163 ( m03 ) .",
    "therefore , we assume that case b is a good approximation , not only for the narrow line emission , but also for the broad line emission .    since the broad and the narrow line emission from snr1987a comes from the expanding debris as it crosses the reverse shock , the line profiles will depend on the hydrodynamics of the reverse shock surface , which we do not consider here .",
    "however , one can measure the ratios of broad ( `` interior '' ) to narrow ( `` surface '' ) emission and of h@xmath0 to ly@xmath0 emission ( h06 ) . by comparing those ratios to those predicted by our theory ,",
    "we can test the hypothesis that the interior emission is indeed the result of charge transfer reactions between hydrogen atoms and protons at the reverse shock .",
    "figure [ fig:87a ] shows these ratios as functions of shock velocity for our model of snr 1987a .",
    "the solid curves show the photon emission ratio @xmath164 .",
    "we see that @xmath165 , a result that is almost independent of @xmath5 and almost the same for interior and surface emission , both for model n and model f. this value is consistent with the value @xmath166 estimated by ckr80 and @xmath167 estimated by m03 .    the dotted curves in fig .",
    "[ fig:87a ] show the number , @xmath168 , of ly@xmath0 photons ( both surface and interior ) emitted per hydrogen atom crossing the reverse shock . in the rest frame of the reverse shock , these atoms cross the shock with a velocity @xmath158 km s@xmath4 . for @xmath5 in this range , @xmath169 for both models n and f. these values may be compared to the value @xmath170 estimated by m03 .    the dashed curves in fig .",
    "[ fig:87a ] show the ratios @xmath146 of interior to surface emission . for the range of shock velocity expected in snr 1987a ,",
    "the curves predict @xmath171 for both models n and f. these values are more than an order of magnitude smaller than the ratio @xmath172 observed by h06 .",
    "for most snrs , the models presented here agree fairly well with previous models and seem to account for the observed data of both broad line fwhm and ratio @xmath173 of broad - to - narrow line intensities .",
    "however , these same models fail to account for the observed ratio @xmath146 of interior - to - surface emission for the conditions of the reverse shock in snr 1987a .",
    "either the model is wrong , or the interior h@xmath0 emission from snr  1987a is dominated by some excitation mechanism other than charge transfer at the reverse shock .    as we mentioned in ",
    "[ sect : assumptions ] , the most questionable assumption of the model is that the hydrogen atoms enter a proton plasma which has been suddenly decelerated according to shock jump conditions .",
    "this assumption is flawed  the approximation is good only when the neutral fraction is small ( see lim & raga 1996 for a discussion on the effects of larger neutral fractions ) .",
    "indeed , the reverse shock has a transition zone of finite thickness @xmath174 , within which the ionization , excitation and charge transfer reactions occur .",
    "consider the first hydrogen atoms to enter this zone from upstream .",
    "when they become ionized , the resulting protons must have streaming velocities comparable to that of the hydrogen atoms . within the transition zone ,",
    "the newly created protons must be decelerated and compressed so that they emerge on the downstream side of the zone with velocity @xmath175 .",
    "but most of the ionizations must occur when the relative streaming velocity of the hydrogen atoms and the protons is substantially less than the relative velocity of @xmath176 that is assumed in the present model .",
    "given the fact that @xmath146 decreases precipitously for @xmath66 km s@xmath4 ( fig . [ fig:87a ] ) , we see that our model might grossly underestimate the actual value of this ratio in the case of snr 1987a .    to properly interpret the h@xmath0 and ly@xmath0 emission from snr 1987a",
    ", we must construct a model for this transition zone similar to that of whitney & skalafuris ( 1963 ) and skalafuris ( 1965 , 1968 and 1969 ) . in a sense ,",
    "the analysis presented here is a warm - up to that task .",
    "once we have such a model , we can use the results of the present analysis to calculate the emissivity and profiles of broad and narrow lines throughout the transition zone .",
    "the assumption that a balmer - dominated shock can be treated as a discontinuous jump is faulty for all snrs , not just snr  1987a .",
    "accordingly , we may ask why the model seems to work for most snrs , for which @xmath121 km  s@xmath4 . if one allowed for the transition zone in constructing a model for actual snrs",
    ", one would construct a weighted average of @xmath146 over relative velocities ranging up to @xmath176 .",
    "but , as fig .",
    "[ fig : halpha ] shows , the ratio @xmath146 does not vary greatly for @xmath155 km  s@xmath4 .",
    "therefore , the value of @xmath146 appropriately averaged over a range of relative velocities would still agree fairly well with the observed values .",
    "on the other hand , these considerations bring into question the validity of the relationship between the broad line fwhm and the shock velocity predicted by the current models . in a more realistic model that takes into account the finite thickness of the transition zone ,",
    "a greater fraction of the h@xmath0 emission would take place where the relative velocity is less than @xmath176 .",
    "the result would be a reduced value of the fwhm of the broad emission for a given value of @xmath5  or , equivalently , a greater value of @xmath5 required to account for a given fwhm .",
    "this consideration suggests that the current models may be under - estimating significantly the shock velocities of snrs .",
    "the present model is also inadequate to interpret current observations of the ratio @xmath177 in snr 1987a .",
    "the observed brightness of ly@xmath0 is modified by resonant scattering in the supernova debris .",
    "the resonance scattering can double the brightness of ly@xmath0 on the near side of the supernova debris and greatly suppress it on the far side , as pointed out by h06 .",
    "however , since the ly@xmath0 photons are produced in the transition zone , and their mean free paths are less than @xmath178 , we need a model of the transition zone to account properly for this resonant scattering .",
