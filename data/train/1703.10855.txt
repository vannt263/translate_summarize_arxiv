    "in this work , we consider a linearized fluid - structure model with respect to some reference state , including an arbitrary spatial vector field .",
    "the coupled system here describes the interaction between a linear plate and a flow of _ compressible _ barotropic , viscous fluid .",
    "such interactive dynamics are crucially considered in the design of many engineering systems ( e.g. , aircraft , engines , and bridges ) .",
    "the study of compressible flows ( gas dynamics ) itself has implications to high - speed aircraft , jet engines , rocket motors , hyperloops , high - speed entry into a planetary atmosphere , gas pipelines , commercial applications ( such as abrasive blasting ) , and many other fields ( see @xcite , for instance ) . in these applications ,",
    "the density of a gas may change significantly along a streamline .",
    "compressibility _  i.e. , the fractional change in volume of the fluid element per unit change in pressure  becomes important , for instance , in flows for which @xmath5the cases @xmath6 and @xmath7 are subsonic / incompressible and subsonic / compressible regimes , respectively .",
    "compressible flows can be either transonic @xmath8 or supersonic @xmath9 . in supersonic flows ,",
    "pressure effects are only transported downstream ; the upstream flow is not affected by conditions downstream .    in the study of incompressible flows ,",
    "the associated analysis typically involves only two unknowns : pressure and velocity .",
    "these are usually found by solving two equations that describe conservation of mass and linear momentum , with the fluid density presumed to be constant .",
    "by contrast , in compressible flow , the gas density and temperature are variables .",
    "consequently , the solution of compressible flow problems will require two more equations ; namely , an equation of state for the gas , and a conservation of energy equation .",
    "moreover , the imposition of external forces to the governing equations may not immediately result in a uniform flow throughout the system .",
    "in particular , the fluid may compress in the vicinity of the applied force ; that is to say , the density may increase locally in response to the given force .",
    "the effects due to compressibility and viscosity upon an ( uncoupled ) fluid dynamics will have to be taken in account when subsequently considering the mathematical properties of pde s describing interactions of said fluid dynamics with some given structure .",
    "in aeroelasticity , the compressible gas is often assumed to be inviscid ",
    "i.e . , viscosity - free  and the flow irrotational ( potential flow ) .",
    "these assumptions are often invoked in practice , as they reduce the flow dynamics to a wave equation @xcite ( see section [ techreview ] below ) . however , there are situations where viscous effects can not be neglected , e.g. , in the transonic region @xcite .",
    "the _ mathematical _ literature  especially in the last 20 years  on fluid - structure interactions across each of these fluid regimes is quite vast .",
    "we will certainly not attempt here a general overview of this literature , but in section [ techreview ] we will provide an in - depth discussion of those key modern references which pertain to the our present work . at this point , we do mention the primary motivating reference @xcite : in this work , the author considers the dynamics of a ( nonlinear ) plate , located on a flat portion of the boundary of a three dimensional cavity , as it interacts with a compressible , barotropic ( linearized ) fluid which fills the cavity . in the present work",
    ", we will analyze a comparable setup , but with a purely linear plate model ; the focus here will be on establishing and describing the essential semigroup dynamics which drives the coupled pde model .    the accommodation of physically relevant nonlinearities ",
    "i.e. , those seen in @xcite  can be readily made subsequent to the present analysis , which develops a good  linear theory .",
    "linearities which are amenable to such treatment include those of berger , kirchhoff , or von karman type , inasmuch as they are _ locally lipschitz _",
    "@xcite on the plate s natural energy space . in many cases ,",
    "it is the addition of structural nonlinearity which ultimately leads to global - in - time boundedness of corresponding trajectories @xcite .",
    "accordingly , nonlinear dynamics will be considered in a forthcoming work .",
    "we also consider a lipschitz geometry , as opposed to the common assumption @xcite that the domain is smooth . given the transition between the elastic and inelastic components of the boundary , a lipschitz boundary is surely more natural and physically relevant ",
    "see figure 1 below  and also more amenable to pertinent generalizations , e.g. , tubular domains ( finite or infinite ) @xcite . further distinguishing our work from @xcite , we take the linearization of the compressible navier - stokes equations about a rest state which has a _ nonzero ambient flow component_. since this linearization process produces some additional terms which depend on the ambient flow ( which are not all compact perturbations of principal spatial operators ) , previous techniques to obtain the well - posedness result can not be directly applied . ) ; @xcite . in this communication",
    ", he remarked that the approaches utilized in @xcite with @xmath10 were not amenable to the problem studied with @xmath11 .",
    "he noted that a semigroup approach might be fruitful , and this comment provided an impetus for the present work .",
    "] instead , to obtain the primary result we invoke a semigroup approach , invoking the well known lumer - phillips theorem @xcite .",
    "we believe that the present treatment fits nicely within the context of the recent work of i. chueshov , where the interactive dynamics between fluid and a plate ( or shell ) are considered from various points of view chu2013-comp , chu2013-inviscid , tube , cr - full - karman , churyz2012-pois , churyz2011 .",
    "moreover , one can draw comparisons and contrasts between the well - posedness analysis here and that in @xcite and @xcite , which deal with _ incompressible _ fluid - structure interactions : in @xcite and george1 , there is also a two dimensional elastic structure existing on the boundary of a three dimensional domain , in which a fluid evolves . however , the earlier well - posedness work @xcite requires an appropriate _ mixed variational _ , _ babuska - brezzi _ formulation , which is nonstandard and instrinsic to the particular dynamics under consideration ( see e.g. , theorem 3.1.5 of @xcite ) ;",
    "whereas the present effort combines the lax - milgram theorem with a critical well - posedness result for ( static versions of ) the pressure pde component of the fluid - structure system ( see the first equation in ( [ system1 ] ) and theorem [ dv ] of the appendix . ) for fluid - structure well - posedness studies that involve a three dimensional solid immersed in a three dimensional fluid , and which utilize semigroup techniques , see @xcite,@xcite,@xcite . )    eventually , we are interested in learning if and how the presence of the dissipating fluid dynamics affects the stability of the structure ( as in , e.g. , @xcite,@xcite ) . in particular ,",
    "for the _ linear _ compressible fluid - structure interaction pde model , we are interested in strong / uniform stability properties of the associated @xmath1-semigroup . on the other hand ,",
    "if one inserts nonlinearity into the structural component of the interaction , the existence and nature of global attractors become the primary objects of interest for the associated pde dynamical system .",
    "qualitative properties of fluid - structure models ( such as well - posedness and stability of solutions , and the existence of compact global attractors ) have been intensely investigated by many authors over the past 30 years . for the pde model under consideration , ( [ system1])([ic_2 ] ) below",
    ", issues of long - time behavior of solutions will be addressed in forthcoming work @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ model ] we describe the pde model and discuss our standing hypotheses . in section [ results ] we provide a discussion of the principal dynamics operator ( on the natural space of finite energy ) , as well its domain ; we then formally state the semigroup generation result which immediately yields well - posedness of fluid - structure model , in the sense of hadamard .",
    "we also include in this section the notion of _ energy balance _ for semigroup solutions .",
    "section [ techreview ] provides an in - depth discussion of the key pertinent references , and their relationship to the result presented here .",
    "section [ proof ] gives the proof of the main result via the lumer - phillips theorem : namely , we establish dissipativity and maximality of a certain bounded perturbation of the modeling fluid - structure operator . section [ static ] gives a brief description of stationary solutions to the dynamics at hand .",
    "lastly , the appendix provides a proof of a key technical lemma on the well - posedness of solutions to the stationary version of the decoupled pressure pde component in ( [ system1])(ic_2 ) below .      for the remainder of the text",

    "our semigroup approach does not require the use of approximate solutions .",
    "indeed , we overcome the key difficulty of trace regularity issues by exploiting cancellations at the level of solutions with data in the generator . in this way",
    "we do not have to work component - wise on the dynamic equations , though we must work carefully ( and component - wise ) on the static problem associated with maximality of the generator .",
    "we remark that , despite these trace regularity issues , when @xmath10 , uniform decay of finite energy solutions is obtained in @xcite through a clever lyapunov approach that makes use of a neumann lifting map with associated estimates ; this construction is fundamentally obstructed by the addition of the @xmath140 term in the pressure equation .",
