    "the investigation of particle production is a well established method to probe the hot and dense nuclear matter which is produced in collisions between heavy nuclei .",
    "the collision dynamics is rather fairly understood within transport model approaches . at incident energies around 1",
    "a.gev one finds that the pion production is the dominant channel by which the hot , compressed matter de - excites .",
    "pionic observables such as yields , spectra and flow have been measured at gsi ( fopi @xcite , kaos @xcite ) and lbl @xcite .",
    "one , however , finds that transport models such as qmd and buu in general overestimate the abundance of low energy pions as well as the charged pions multiplicities @xcite .",
    "in addition , this discrepancy is most prominent in heavy colliding systems like @xmath2 , as compared to light systems such as @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "one characteristic aspect of such heavy systems is the high neutron - proton asymmetry effect . essentially due to this asymmetry factor @xmath4 , in the case of heavy systems ,",
    "one generally finds for the total pion yields @xmath5 . on the other hand , for light systems",
    "one expects the pion abundances to be more or less equally distributed , i.e. @xmath6 .",
    "this observed charge dependence of the pion yields is mainly due to the isospin dependence of the pion production cross sections which can be well understood within the isobar model @xcite as most of the pions produced at intermediate energies originate from @xmath7decays .    normally , although a isospin dependence is duly included in the baryon - baryon collision process , these baryons comprising nucleons , @xmath8 and @xmath9 propagate in an isospin independent mean field .",
    "as most of the pions , particularly the low energy ones , result from @xmath7decays the general nature of the production / re - absorption and the propagation of @xmath7resonances are important .",
    "the inclusion of a isospin dependent mean field ( idmf ) will certainly affect the reaction dynamics of nucleons and resonances leading to possible differences in pion yields .",
    "this is due to the fact that the various charges of nucleons and resonances will be affected in a different way by the isospin dependent mean field during their propagation .",
    "this isospin dependence makes neutrons more energetic than protons .",
    "thus , with other properties remaining the same , one expects that with inclusion of a idmf the average number @xmath10 of @xmath11@xmath11 collisions will get somewhat reduced while the average number @xmath12 of @xmath13@xmath13 collisions will get slightly enhanced . at low incident energies ,",
    "it is found @xcite that the idmf strongly affects observables such as the collective flow and the pre - equilibrium @xmath14 ratio .",
    "therefore , it is of general interest to analyze the role of the idmf in the context of pion production in heavy ion reactions at sis energies .    in view of this",
    "we make our first exploratory study on the role of a isospin dependent mean field on the pionic observables such as @xmath15spectra and the @xmath16 ratio .",
    "to analyse the effect of the isospin dependence on the pion production process we make use of the quantum molecular dynamics ( qmd ) model @xcite which is well described in our earlier works @xcite .",
    "pions are produced mainly by resonance decays , and this pion production process is implemented in the model in the following way .",
    "nucleons while propagating shall collide stochastically if the distance between the centroids of the two gaussian wavepackets is less than @xmath17 .",
    "this collision process is implemented using monte carlo methods and the effect of the pauli exclusion principle is duly taken into account . for the inelastic nucleon - nucleon channels we include the @xmath18 as well as the @xmath19 resonance . in the intermediate energy",
    "range the resonance production is dominated by the @xmath20 , however , the @xmath21 yet gives non - negligible contributions to the high energetic pion yield @xcite .",
    "the resonances as well as the pions originating from their decay are explicitly treated , i.e. in a non - perturbative way and all relevant channels are taken into account .",
    "in particular we include the resonance production and rescattering by inelastic nn collisions , the one - pion decay of @xmath20 and @xmath21 and the two - pion decay of the @xmath21 and one - pion reabsorption processes .",
    "( for details see ref .",
    "@xcite . ) the isospin dependence of the pion production cross sections is duly included in the model .",
    "thus one is able to understand the observed charged dependence given by @xmath5 . for the au+au system",
    ", we obtain the ratios @xmath22 for the respective multiplicities , which then gives @xmath23 .",
    "finally , the pions thus produced are guided essentially by the coulomb interaction between the pions and baryons .",
    "it may be said here that the pion propagation can , in principle , be also affected by the contribution arising from the effect of nuclear medium , i.e. from the collective @xmath24 and @xmath25 excitations , on the pion dispersion relation . however , it is shown in a recent study @xcite that only weak corrections , i.e. a small in - medium pion - nucleus potential , are required in order to obtain a realistic description of pionic observables .",
    "in addition , also in other works @xcite it was found that the high energy part of the pion spectrum is not much affected by these medium corrections .",
    "a more sophisticated treatment of collective pionic excitations within the transport approach was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which was subsequently applied to heavy ion collisions in ref .",
    "however , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is rather questionable if the simple @xmath24 ( and @xmath25 ) model yields a reliable pion dispersion relation .",
    "further , the results of ref .",
    "@xcite indicate that the influence of collective excitations on pionic observables is small and tends to enhance the pion yields with respect to the standard approaches and the experimental findings .",
    "moreover , in this exploratory study we wish to concentrate on the role of the idmf in pion production .",
    "hence , we omit the medium effects of the charge dependence of pion production in the present work .",
    "now , coming to the baryon propagation part , the transport models like qmd normally propagate the nucleons and resonances in a density and momentum dependent nuclear mean field and as well include the coulomb interaction among the charged particles . in the present study we consider in addition to the above stated components a isospin dependent contribution to the total mean field .",
    "thus , one has , @xmath26 where @xmath27 stands for any one of the nucleons or resonances .",
    "the isospin dependent potential @xmath28 is determined following ref .",
    "@xcite as @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the potential part of the nuclear symmetry energy at nuclear matter saturation density ( @xmath32 @xmath33 ) .",
    "the density dependence of the idmf is taken to be @xmath34 .",
    "the strength of the density dependence varies widely among the theoretical studies @xcite . for our present qualitative investigation , we choose two particular values , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "having obtained the idmf for neutrons and protons , we now express @xmath37 for the respective resonances as : @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "thus , both , nucleons and resonances propagate in an isospin dependent mean field .",
    "consequently , there shall appear  with the other conditions being the same  a smaller number of @xmath11@xmath11 and @xmath11@xmath13 collisions , and a slightly enhanced number of @xmath13@xmath13 collisions .",
    "since @xmath42 are predominantly created in @xmath11@xmath11 collisions via @xmath43 and @xmath44 decays , the number of @xmath42 ( @xmath45 ) is expected to decrease . on the other hand , as @xmath46 are mainly created in @xmath13@xmath13 collisions via @xmath47 and @xmath48 decays , @xmath49 may slightly increase .",
    "therefore , the charged pion ratio @xmath16 may effectively decrease .",
    "but , we need to take into account the effect of re - absorption process as well , which sort of counterbalances the effect due to the idmf on pion production . in addition , in the case of @xmath46 , both @xmath11@xmath13 and @xmath13@xmath13 collisions contribute to @xmath49 via @xmath48 decay . as @xmath50 there",
    "may as well be a slight reduction in @xmath49 at the end of the reaction .",
    "the final outcome of the interplay of these effects in regard to pionic observables is discussed in the following section .",
    "in this section we discuss the results as obtained from simulations made including an isospin dependent mean field in the baryon propagation part .",
    "all the calculations pertain to the @xmath0 reaction at @xmath51 a.gev and use the standard momentum dependent skyrme force which corresponds to a soft equation of state , hereafter referred to as smd force .",
    "as expected , we find that the average number of collisions are modified due to the presence of a idmf .",
    "it is found that average number of @xmath11@xmath11 collisions , @xmath10 , decrease by about @xmath52 , while @xmath12 increase by about @xmath53 . as a result , it can be seen from fig . 1 that , the total pion multiplicity @xmath54 obtained for zero impact parameter , @xmath55 , decreases by about @xmath56 at midrapidity . moreover , though one sees that the reduction in @xmath54 slightly increases with increase in the value of parameter @xmath57 , which signifies the density dependence of the symmetry energy ; the dependence of @xmath54 on @xmath57 is not so prominent at high incident energies considered here .",
    "in addition , it may be said here that though the total pion number at @xmath55 decreases from @xmath58 to @xmath59 , the theoretical results obtained for charged pion multiplicity are still overestimated @xcite as compared to the experimental data .",
    "it is known @xcite that the high energy pions belong mostly to the early , compressed phase of the nuclear reaction .",
    "hence , these pions undergo relatively less scattering as compared to the low energy pions , and thereby , one expects high energy pions to be less affected by the isospin dependence of the mean field .",
    "this aspect is illustrated in fig .",
    "2 , where the pion transverse momentum @xmath60 distribution calculated at midrapidity with @xmath55 is shown . a substantial reduction over the low@xmath1 part due to the idmf can be noted .",
    "in contrast , the high@xmath1 part remains more or less the same .",
    "further , a similar suppression of low@xmath1 pions is also found in the case of non - central collisions .",
    "it maybe recalled here that transport models like qmd overestimate the low energy part of pion spectra .",
    "now , with inclusion of the idmf , we expect that this overestimation of model calculations as compared to the data to be reduced . toward this purpose , we performed simulations pertaining to the minimum bias condition for a particular value of @xmath61 .",
    "results obtained for the charged pion spectra are compared in figs . 3 and 4 to the fopi data @xcite .",
    "it is satisfying to note that results obtained with the idmf are closer to the fopi data than those obtained with @xmath62 , particularly over the low@xmath1 part .",
    "in addition , the effect of the idmf is more significant on the @xmath42 spectrum than on @xmath46 .",
    "thus , for a quantitative description of pion yields and spectra , we need to include the isospin dependence of the mean field .",
    "another quantity which is sensitive to the isospin dependence is the charged pion ratio @xmath16 .",
    "the study of the charged pion ratio is of importance and current interest since one can , in principle , extract information regarding the size of the participant zone during its compression and expansion stages . in particular",
    ", the observed energy dependence of @xmath16 @xmath63 that is , the value of this ratio decreases from about 3.0 to 0.9 as pion kinetic energy increases from @xmath59 mev to @xmath64 mev , and remains almost constant at higher energies@xmath63 is shown to be due to the coulomb potential @xcite , which is opposite in nature for @xmath46 and @xmath42 . with the inclusion of a idmf we expected the ratio to decrease , particularly over the low energy region .",
    "however , we found that in practice the decrease is not substantial enough to illustrate the role of idmf .",
    "this may be due to , firstly , that there is a net reduction in low@xmath1 @xmath65 as these positively charged pions are also produced in @xmath66 collisions , and secondly , that the low@xmath1 pions undergo more production - reabsorption cycles before they freeze out which may wash out the isospin effects .",
    "however , the effect of the idmf on @xmath16 is more clearly seen when the charged pion ratio is analysed as a function of the normalized center  of  mass rapidity @xmath67 .",
    "results obtained with @xmath55 are shown in fig .",
    "5 . the error bars quote the statistical uncertainty of the calculations which is due to the event number . quite interestingly ,",
    "similar to the energy dependence , there appears a systematic @xmath68dependence of the @xmath16 ratio where we obtain in the case of no asymmetry dependence , i.e. @xmath62 , @xmath69 over the midrapidity region and the ratio decreases with increasing @xmath70 .",
    "this @xmath68dependence is essentially due to the coulomb interaction .",
    "this is also illustrated in the same figure , where one finds that , in the absence of the coulomb interaction , the ratio remains more or less constant , i.e. @xmath71 which is indicated by the horizontal line in fig .",
    "5 . furthermore ,",
    "once the idmf is included , the charged pion ratio gets significantly suppressed over the midrapidity region while the distribution remains more or less the same beyond the midrapidity region . with an increase in the value of @xmath57 ,",
    "( [ vasym ] ) , the amount of suppression slightly increases .",
    "in addition , there appears a double peaked structure , even at @xmath55 , which is due to the isospin dependence of the nuclear mean field .",
    "furthermore , this structure appears to be sensitive on the density dependence of the isospin dependent interaction .",
    "thus , this particular observable clearly illustrates the effect due to coulomb interaction and the idmf .",
    "a recent preliminary analysis @xcite of the fopi data for 1 a.gev @xmath2 on @xmath2 collisions indicates such a double peaked structure for semi - central as well as for most central collisions . in semi - central collisions",
    "this structure is probably due to an incomplete stopping and thermalization of the pions and can be qualitatively explained by the standard approach . to illustrate this effect",
    "we show in fig .",
    "6 the @xmath16 ratio for a central ( b=1 ) and a semi - central ( b=6 ) collision with both calculations performed without an isospin dependence of the nuclear mean field .",
    "as already seen in fig .",
    "5 there exists only one single peak for b=1 .",
    "thus the reduction of the @xmath16 ratio at midrapidity in central collisions can probably be regarded as a signature for the importance of the idmf in the pion production mechanism at sis energies .",
    "to summarize , we have made an exploratory study on the importance of a isospin dependent nuclear mean field ( idmf ) concerning the pion production mechanism in intermediate energy heavy ion reactions .",
    "it is found that due to the different isospin charges of nucleons and resonances , the average number of collisions gets modified and hence , the pion yield . in particular ,",
    "the low energy pions get significantly suppressed rendering a better agreement of calculated pion spectra with the fopi data .",
    "we have also analysed the rapidity distribution of the charged pion ratio where due to the effect of the idmf , one finds a substantial reduction of the @xmath16 ratio over the midrapidity region in central collisions .",
    "this particular observable seems to illustrate clearly the effects due to coulomb force and the idmf .",
    "therefore , our present study strongly suggests that at the quantitative level , it is quite important to take into account the isospin dependence of the nuclear mean field ."
