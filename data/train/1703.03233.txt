    "probabilistic models of argumentation became popular in cognitive science and its subfields including psychology , philosophy , and computer science in recent years .",
    "like logic - based nonmonotonic approaches for defeasible argumentation , probabilistic approaches allow for dealing with exceptions and retracting conclusions in the light of new evidence",
    ". however , in contrast to qualitative logical approaches , probability allows for managing _ degrees of belief _ in the sentences involved in common sense argumentation .",
    "moreover , degrees of belief can be used to model the strength of arguments @xcite .    the concept `` argument '' is ambiguous . in logic",
    ", it denotes a triple consisting of a ( possibly empty ) premise set , a conclusion indicator , and a conclusion set .",
    "consider , for example , the following argument , which is an instance of modus ponens :    [ cols= \" < ,",
    "< \" , ]     finally , we discuss qualitative data taken from structured interviews on folk psychological conceptions on what argument strength means .",
    "[ [ interview - results ] ] interview results + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    after the participants completed the paper and pencil tasks , we collected folk psychological conceptions on what `` argument strength '' ( _ argumentin vahvuus _ ) means by structured interviews .",
    "we asked the participants how they would define argument strength in their own words .",
    "participants who had received the _ persuasive _ booklets , we hypothesized , mentioned persuasive aspects ( like how _ convincing _ arguments are ) more frequently than those of the epistemic condition .",
    "moreover , participants who had received the _ epistemic _ booklets focused more on epistemic aspects ( like truth and knowledge ) than those of the persuasive condition . however , the interview responses do not confirm these hypotheses .",
    "the responses to the interview question concerning the meaning of `` argument strength '' reflected features of our measure @xmath1 .",
    "specifically , the _ location _ of the coherent conclusion probability interval was referred to by almost all of the participants . for many participants the location seemed to be more important than the _ precision _ of the coherent conclusion probability interval .",
    "they had , for example , focused solely on the lower probability bound of the interval and ignored the upper bound or responded based on the mean value of the interval .",
    "however , a few participants also referred to the _ precision _ of the coherent conclusion probability interval by sentences like :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ `` the size of this gap between 33 [ % ] and 100 [ % ] is so big that it increases the uncertainty .

    "the arguments were strong , when the probabilities in the conclusions were _ correct _ , almost regardless of the values in them .",
    "finally , we note that the interview responses provide folk psychological evidence for using location and precision of conclusion probability intervals for evaluating the strength of uncertain arguments .",
    "location and precision are the key ingredients of our measure of argument strength  @xmath1 .",
    "we proposed a formal measure of argument strength and showed how it predicts responses in ellsberg tasks .",
    "specifically , we framed choices among bets in terms of probability logical argument forms .",
    "we confirmed experimentally that ellsberg s predictions can be justified by argument strength rankings and argument strength ratings .",
    "since the proposed measure exploits tools available in coherence - based probability logic and since it is based on a deductive consequence relation , it allows for dealing with arguments involving conditionals .",
    "the proposed measure has many plausible consequences , which calls for future formal - normative and experimental research for modeling also other argument types , like the conditional syllogisms .",
    "understanding argument strength is important for theories about reasoning and argumentation in general .",
