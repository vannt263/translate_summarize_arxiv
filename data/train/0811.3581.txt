    "we analyze the approach to equilibrium of a system qudit interacting with a very large ensemble of qudits .",

    "the paper is structured as follows : in the following section we review the random collision model and we specialize it to the case of collisions described by random unitary operators .",
    "we then characterize the approach to equilibrium by analytically calculating the purity of the system steady state and the rate of approach to such state for the specific case of colliding qubits .",
    "such analytical analysis is then generalized to a system qudit of dimension @xmath0 colliding with an ensemble of qudits of size @xmath1 .",
    "we then proceed with a numerical analysis of the entanglement dynamics for colliding qubits",
    "in the random collisions model of irreversible dynamics a system qudit interacts with an environment consisting of @xmath4 qudits .",
    "such interaction is modeled by pairwise collisions between the system qudit an a single environment qudit .",
    "each collision is described by a random unitary operator .",
    "the environment , i.e. @xmath4 , is assumed to be so large that the system never collides twice with the same environment qudit . in pictorial terms",
    "one can think of a single qudit colliding in sequence with the individual qudits of a long chain .",

    "let us assume that the system and environment are in an initial tensor product state @xmath11 . since the collision operators are random unitaries , the specific states @xmath12 are irrelevant and we can assume , without loss of generality that all the environment qudits are in the same initial state @xmath13 .    in order to characterize the relaxation process we first consider the decay of the system purity after @xmath5 collisions .",
    "we remind the reader that , given a density operator @xmath14 , its purity is defined as @xmath15 $ ] . the purity is a decreasing function of the degree of statistical mixture of @xmath14 and , for a qudit of dimension @xmath0 takes values in the range @xmath16 , where @xmath17 corresponds to pure states and @xmath18 to the completely unpolarized mixed state .",
    "since we are focussing our attention to the purity of the system , our model is equivalent to a system qudit colliding with a single environment qudit whose state is refreshed to its initial state @xmath13 after each collision .",
