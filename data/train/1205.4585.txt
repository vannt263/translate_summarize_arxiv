    "as a consequence of the unitary evolution inherent to quantum mechanics , noise is the price we must pay in any deterministic quantum state amplification process .",
    "this can be seen in the ideal ( quantum - noise limited ) optical amplifier , which is described by the evolution @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 denote the input and ouput bosonic mode operators , @xmath3 is the bosonic operator associated with an ancilla mode initially in the vacuum state , and @xmath4 is the amplitude gain .",
    "the term in @xmath5 necessarily adds some noise , which originates from the vacuum fluctuations of mode @xmath3 and can be associated with spontaneous emission .",
    "remarkably , if one drops the constraint that the amplifier is deterministic , it becomes possible to define a _ noiseless _ amplification process , which probabilistically amplifies any coherent state @xmath6 with no added noise , that is @xmath7 in other words , one can trade a noisy trace - preserving process for a noiseless but trace - decreasing one .",
    "such a scheme was proposed by ralph and lund @xcite , based on an optical quantum scissor setup .",
    "it is called an _ heralded _ noiseless linear amplifier ( hnla ) , in the sense that the success of the noiseless amplification can be heralded by some detection event ( we know when the noiseless amplification has succeeded ) .",
    "strictly speaking , the hnla operator is unbounded , so it is actually impossible to implement a _",
    "noiseless amplifier , albeit with zero success probability .",
    "however , the perfect hnla can be approximated as closely as we wish by truncating the input fock space to an increasingly large photon number @xmath8 .",
    "more precisely , the action of an approximate hnla on a fock state @xmath9 in the truncated space @xmath10 can be mathematically described by some filtration operator @xmath11 , which works as @xmath12 where @xmath8 and @xmath13 are two parameters defining the optical hnla setup of ref .",
    "note that @xmath14 , implying that @xmath15 . in the limit @xmath16",
    ", applying the filtration operator @xmath17 on a coherent state @xmath6 gives @xmath18 which is proportional to the desired noiselessly amplified coherent state @xmath19 .",
    "one can see that @xmath11 tends to a perfect hnla as @xmath16 , while its success probability @xmath20 tends to zero .",
    "note that the success probability is state - dependent and diverges for large input amplitudes ( large @xmath21 ) .",
    "this is precisely related to the fact that @xmath22 is an unbounded operator in the infinite - dimensional fock space ( this is why we need to have the prefactor @xmath23 , which vanishes for a perfect hnla as @xmath24 ) .",
    "as expected , only an approximate hnla with non - zero success probability can be realized physically if we keep @xmath8 finite .",
    "various possible implementations of the hnla have been found and experimentally demonstrated @xcite , but they all share this property that the higher is the fidelity between the actual output state and target state , the lower is the success probability .",
    "the hnla may serve as a tool for quantum entanglement distillation or for breeding schrdinger cat states @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "more recently , it has also been shown useful to carry out continuous - variable quantum error correction on a lossy line @xcite , or , in conjunction with noiseless attenuation , as a tool to convert a lossy line into a lossless line @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will investigate its ability to serve as an heralded phase - insensitive single - mode squeezer .",
    "we will mainly be interested in the perfect hnla , so we will disregard the above truncation effect and simply use @xmath26 as a filtration operator , remembering that the proportionality constant is related to the normalization of the actual output state and would vanish in the limit of a perfect hnla .    in section",
    "ii , we will examine how it acts on an arbitrary squeezed state , showing that the resulting state undergoes a stronger squeezing whatever the initial squeezing angle .",
    "we will also derive its effect on the mean field of a coherent squeezed state as well as the corresponding success probability .",
    "these results will be exploited in section iii in order to investigate how this heralded phase - insensitive squeezing lives in so - called `` peaceful coexistence '' @xcite with the causality principle of special relativity . indeed , at first sight",
    ", it seems that such a universal squeezing feature may be exploited in an heralded scheme that would violate the no - cloning principle , hence would lead to instantaneous signaling with a small but non - zero success probability .",
    "we will show that the state dependence of the success probability in conjunction with bayes rule for conditional probabilities precisely leads to a situation where this paradox is avoided , as expected .",
    "finally , we discuss our conclusions in section iv .",
    "in the following , we use the notation @xmath27 for denoting a coherent squeezed state , where @xmath28 is the vacuum state , @xmath29 is the displacement operator , and @xmath30 is the squeezing operator . the displacement amplitude @xmath31 and squeezing amplitude @xmath32 are two complex parameters defined as @xmath33 with @xmath34 and @xmath35 being respectively the displacement of the @xmath34- and @xmath35-quadrature @xcite , and @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the squeezing strength and @xmath38 is the squeezing angle ( @xmath39 refers to squeezing of the @xmath34 quadrature , while @xmath40 stands for squeezing of the @xmath35 quadrature ) .    for simplicity , we first consider the action of @xmath11 on a vacuum squeezed state , i.e. , @xmath41",
    "the expansion of such a state in the fock basis reads as a superposition of even fock states @xcite , @xmath42 in each term of this superposition , which results into another vacuum squeezed state @xmath43 the resulting squeezing parameter @xmath44 is related to the original one by the relation @xmath45 while the phase @xmath38 is unchanged .",
    "( note that the condition @xmath46 must be satisfied for this expression to make sense . )",
    "thus , if the operation is successful , the resulting state is squeezed along the same angle @xmath38 as the original state , but with a stronger parameter @xmath47 regardless of @xmath38 , as implied by eq .",
    "( [ defrprime ] ) .",
    "this is yet another very peculiar property of this heralded transformation , namely _ phase - insensitive squeezing_. the signal - to - noise ratio is thus conserved in this transformation , just as for a ( deterministic ) phase - sensitive amplifier @xcite , while the transformation is actually phase - insensitive ; this is obvious since @xmath11 only depends on @xmath48 .",

    "( [ hnlaonsqueezed ] ) as @xmath57 now , let us see how the operator in the right - hand side of eq .",

    "we start by rewriting the vacuum squeezed state as @xmath67 where @xmath68 if we define @xmath69 , we may calculate the action of the exponential @xmath70 on the state @xmath66 by using the expansion @xmath71 the expression of @xmath72 is thus a double summation over @xmath52 and @xmath73 , which we may express by relabeling the variables as @xmath74 with @xmath75 using eq .",
    "( [ h_n(0 ) ] ) for @xmath76 , which only contributes to the sum for even @xmath73 , we can rewrite this as @xmath77 using the explicit expression for the hermite polynomial , eq .",

    "( [ 8 ] ) , we obtain @xmath80 noting the similarity with eq .",
    "( [ fockexpansion ] ) , this can be reexpressed as another coherent squeezed state @xmath81 .",
    "by defining the new displacement amplitude @xmath82 such that @xmath83 we obtain finally @xmath84 in summary , we see that the coherent squeezed state @xmath85 has been transformed by @xmath11 into another coherent squeezed state @xmath81 , where the transformation of the squeezing amplitude @xmath86 is governed by eq .",
    "( [ defrprime ] ) , while the transformation of the coherent amplitude @xmath87 is defined via eq .",
    "( [ defalphaprime ] ) .",
    "the latter can be rewritten as a transformation between the quadrature components before amplification @xmath88 and those after amplification @xmath89 .",
    "such a transformation is generally complicated , but if we consider an @xmath34-squeezed state ( @xmath39 ) , it takes the simple form @xmath90 if the initial squeezing vanishes ( @xmath91 ) , we recover the transformations which characterize the action of the hnla on a coherent state , @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "however , for an @xmath34-squeezed state , we see that the prefactor of @xmath94 is smaller than one while the prefactor of @xmath95 is larger than one ( remember @xmath96 ) .",
    "of course , a similar behavior prevails for squeezed states along any quadrature since the transformation is phase insensitive .",
    "thus , we conclude that the amplification gain becomes sublinear in @xmath97 for the squeezed quadrature and superlinear in @xmath97 for the antisqueezed quadrature @xcite .",
    "as explained in section  i , @xmath11 is an unbounded operator which can only be approximately implemented by truncating the fock space at a photon number @xmath8 in order to get a non - zero success probability .",
    "we have investigated this truncation effect for a vacuum squeezed state of various squeezing strengths @xmath64 . in figure  1",
    ", we exhibit the fidelity @xmath100 between the ideal output squeezed state @xmath66 and the ( renormalized ) truncated output state @xmath101 resulting from applying the truncated operator @xmath102 onto the truncated input squeezed state @xmath103 .",
    "the fidelity can be expressed as @xmath104 and it is easy to check that @xmath105 , @xmath106 , so that the truncated process becomes perfect in the limit of an infinite large space .",
    "the success probability reads @xmath107 which tends to zero in the limit of a large @xmath8 , as expected . in figure 1 , we plot @xmath108 and @xmath109 as a function of the truncation size @xmath8 .",
    "we take a value of the gain @xmath110 and consider several values of the squeezing @xmath64 assuming @xmath39 ( remember @xmath111 ) .",
    "we observe that for small values of @xmath8 , the fidelity is close to one if the squeezing is not too large , while the success probability remains acceptable .",
    "for example , if @xmath8 is as low as 2 photons and the squeezing @xmath64 corresponds to 4  db , we get @xmath112 with @xmath113 .     of the approximate phase - insensitive squeezer ( with respect to the ideal one ) as a function of the truncation size @xmath8 for @xmath110 .",
    "we consider a vacuum squeezed state at the input with several values of the squeezing @xmath64 ( from 2 db to 8 db ) .",
    "the success probability @xmath109 is also shown . for @xmath114 and a squeezing of 4  db",
    ", we have @xmath112 and @xmath113,width=321 ]    .",
    "any local operation on an entangled quantum state whose members are spacelike separated is well known to preserve causality in the sense that acting on one member can not lead to consequences that would be instantaneously measurable on another member .",
    "thus , although the nonlocality inherent to quantum theory seemingly leads to a so - called  action at a distance \" , it does not open a way to instantaneous signaling .",
    "this feature was dubbed by shimony the `` peaceful coexistence '' between quantum mechanics and special relativity @xcite . as explained below in sec .",
    "iii b , it seems that the ability to squeeze a quantum state independently of its phase could contradict this peaceful coexistence and lead to instantaneous signaling between entangled parties on an heralded basis . while we , of course , do not expect this possibility to hold , it is intriguing enough to deserve a serious analysis . in the rest of this paper",
    ", we examine the mechanism behind this peaceful coexistence between the phase - insensitive squeezer and special relativity .",
    "let us start by analyzing the action of the hnla on one mode of an epr pair , or more precisely a two - mode vacuum squeezed state of parameter @xmath115 , @xmath116 remember that tracing over one mode results in a thermal state of mean photon number @xmath117 , @xmath118 with a covariance matrix @xmath119 assume that alice and bob share such an epr state and that bob applies the hnla , as depicted in figure  2 . as discussed in @xcite",
    ", applying the operator @xmath120 gives an additional weight @xmath121 in each term of the superposition ( [ epr ] ) .",
    "thus , when successful , this yields a stronger entangled epr state , namely @xmath122 with squeezing parameter @xmath123 satisfying @xmath124 in a second time , alice may measure the photon number in her mode ( i.e. , she applies a projective measurement in the @xmath125 basis as shown in fig .",
    "2 ) , so that she prepares a mixture of photon number states ( with a geometric distribution ) on bob s side , which is the thermal state @xmath126 with a mean photon number @xmath127 . of course",
    ", this preparation `` at a distance '' just corresponds to some possible ensemble realizing bob s state , which may also have been obtained simply by performing a partial trace of @xmath128 over alice s mode .",
    "and we compare two situations : ( i ) bob amplifies his mode with the hnla of gain @xmath97 , which creates a stronger entangled state @xmath128 , and then alice measures her mode , thereby preparing some mixture at bob s side ; ( ii ) alice measures her mode first , thereby preparing some mixture at bob s side , and bob later amplifies each component pure state of this mixture .",
    "it is verified that these two situations yield the same average state @xmath129 at bob s side as a consequence of bayes rule ( both photon number or heterodyne measurement are considered ) .",
    ", width=340 ]    now , instead of assuming that bob s amplification was done before alice s measurement , we may also consider the opposite situation , that is , alice first measures her part of the state @xmath130 , which prepares a photon number state @xmath131 at bob s side with probability @xmath132 then , applying the hlna on @xmath131 results in the same state @xmath131 with a success probability @xmath133 . to get the probability of the @xmath131 component in the resulting state",
    ", we need to use bayes rule for conditional probabilities , namely , @xmath134 where @xmath109 is the average success probability .",
    "thus , as expected , the resulting mixture of photon number states exactly coincides with the expression of bob s state given by eq .",
    "( [ bob - state ] ) , so that measuring on alice s side before or after amplifying on bob s side does not make any difference .",
    "even though the photon number states @xmath131 are unaffected by the hnla , the mean photon number of bob s state is enhanced ( @xmath135 ) by the hnla due to the fact that higher photon - number states have a higher probability to be sucessfully transformed ( into themselves ) , which introduces just the right bias .",
    "this is the simplest illustration of the `` peaceful coexistence '' that we can find .",
    "another simple case occurs if alice performs an heterodyne measurement on her mode of the epr state , that is , she performs a povm measurement based on projectors onto coherent states @xmath136 ( as also shown in fig .  2 ) .",
    "remember that the thermal state @xmath137 can also be written as a gaussian mixture of coherent states , namely @xmath138 where the mean photon number @xmath139 is related to the squeezing parameter @xmath115 via @xmath117 .",
    "starting from the entangled state @xmath140 , if bob amplifies his mode before alice s measurement , we need to consider the effect of heterodyne measurement on alice s mode of the entangled state @xmath141 .",
    "the resulting state that is prepared `` at a distance '' ( on bob s side ) is obviously a gaussian mixture of coherent states , which reads as @xmath142 with a mean photon number @xmath127 .",
    "this is also simply the state obtained by tracing @xmath141 over alice s mode .    alternatively ,",
    "if alice performs her heterodyne measurement before bob s amplification , she first prepares the coherent states @xmath136 on bob s side with the probability distribution @xmath143 each coherent state @xmath6 is transformed by the hnla into an amplified coherent state @xmath144 with probability @xmath145 , so that bob s state conditional on the success of the hnla can be written as @xmath146 where we have used the identity @xmath147 . by making the change of variable @xmath148 in eq .",
    "( [ conditionalstate ] ) , using eq .",
    "( [ s - to - s ] ) and the identity @xmath149 , it is easy to check that bob s conditional state @xmath150 is exactly proportional to the thermal state of eq .",
    "( [ new_thermal_state ] ) with a mean photon number @xmath151 .",
    "thus , the mean photon number enhancement @xmath135 is due here to the combined effect of the amplification gain @xmath97 with the bias induced by bayes rule .",
    "these two examples are of course not very surprising since we knew from the beginning that whatever alice does on her part of the entangled state ( measuring it or not ) , bob is left with the same reduced state and the fact that he noiselessly amplifies it before or after alice s measurement is irrelevant ( this notion is even meaningless for a spacelike interval between the two events ) . in sec .",
    "iii  b , we will consider a more subtle scenario exploiting the link between causality , cloning , and amplification , which seemingly provides a genuine way to signaling .",
    "it has been known since a famous paper by dieks @xcite that the quantum no - cloning principle can be proven using a thought experiment which connects it to the impossibility of instantaneous signaling .",
    "assuming that alice and bob share an entangled state , it appears that alice could instantaneously communicate to bob if the latter had a perfect quantum cloning transformation at his disposal .",
    "alice would simply perform a specific measurement on her component of the state depending on the information she wishes to communicate , while bob would acquire the information by perfectly cloning his component of the state before measuring it . since signaling is impossible ,",
    "perfect quantum cloning is precluded .",
    "note that imperfect quantum cloning is nevertheless possible ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a review ) and , interestingly enough , the minimum cloning noise that is needed to comply with causality in dieks thought experiment exactly coincides with the noise of the best imperfect cloning transformation that is allowed by quantum mechanics @xcite .    here , we start from the possible realization of the continuous - variable gaussian cloning transformation @xcite in terms of a phase - insensitive amplifier of amplitude gain @xmath152 followed by a balanced beam splitter , whose output ports yield the two clones @xcite . in this realization",
    ", the imperfection of the clones originates from the added noise of the amplifier , and the optimal ( imperfect ) cloner precisely corresponds to the ideal quantum - limited amplifier of eq .",
    "( [ opqulim ] ) .",
    "if we replace this amplifier by the hnla with the same gain , we obtain a probabilistic heralded perfect cloner , which yields two perfect clones when it succeeds .",
    "more precisely , the fidelity of the clones can be made arbitrary close to one at the cost of a decreasing success probability .",
    "following dieks reasoning , it seems that such a probabilistic perfect cloner could enable alice to communicate instantaneously to bob , though on an heralded basis only .",
    "it must be stressed that this possibility for heralded instantaneous signaling is in reckless contradiction with causality .",
    "even if the success probability is very low and the fidelity is slightly below one , bob should not _ at all _ be able to acquire _ any _ information on alice s bit while knowing that he has succeeded .",
    "we will show how this loophole is avoided , thanks to a subtle interplay between quantum mechanics and bayes rule for conditional probabilities .    , and alice measures the @xmath34 or @xmath35 quadrature in order to send the bit 0 or 1 , respectively .",
    "this results into two possible ( indistinguishable ) mixtures of squeezed states at bob s side .",
    "the perfect cloning ( or amplification ) of each component squeezed state of these two mixtures realized with the heralded phase - insensitive squeezer of gain @xmath97 seems to provide bob with a way to discriminate the phase - encoded information ( @xmath34 or @xmath35 ) , which would lead to heralded signaling .",
    "in fact , the state dependence of this heralded transformation `` conspires '' with bayes rule and forbids this to happen .",
    "bob s mixtures coincide with the same state @xmath129 regardless of alice s bit .",
    ", width=340 ]    we introduce a continuous - variable analog to dieks scheme ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . in such a scheme , alice and bob share an entangled state @xmath140 , and alice decides to perform a homodyne measurement of the @xmath34 or @xmath35 quadrature on her mode .",
    "the choice between @xmath34 and @xmath35 corresponds to the bit of information she wishes to instantaneously communicate to bob .",
    "if she measures the @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) quadrature , this prepares an ensemble of @xmath34-squeezed ( @xmath35-squeezed ) states on bob s side .",
    "then , bob clones these squeezed states by using the hnla and attempts to gain some knowledge on the phase - encoded information bit . to understand why signaling is impossible , it is necessary to investigate the noiseless amplification of these two indistinguishable ensembles of @xmath34- or @xmath35-squeezed states , for which we will need the results of section ii .",
    "assume that alice wants to communicate a bit 0 , so she measures the @xmath34 quadrature of her mode . as sketched in fig .  3 ,",
    "this prepares on bob s side an ensemble of @xmath34-squeezed states of mean vector @xmath153 and covariance matrix @xmath154 with @xmath34 being drawn from a gaussian distribution of mean 0 and variance @xmath155 . here",
    "@xmath64 is the single - mode squeezing parameter of each component state of this mixture , and , given eq .",
    "( [ cov - matr - therm ] ) , it must be related to the two - mode squeezing parameter @xmath115 of the epr state by @xmath156 .",
    "this expresses that the @xmath35-variance of each component @xmath34-squeezed state is equal to the variance of the thermal state @xmath137 obtained simply by tracing over alice s mode .",

    "the next step is to verify that the @xmath34-variance of bob s state after amplification coincides with the @xmath35-variance .",
    "more generally , we need to verify that bob s resulting state is independent of alice s choice to measure one particular quadrature ( here @xmath34 ) .",
    "the ensemble of @xmath34-squeezed states before amplification can be written as a mixture @xmath160 where @xmath161 stands for an @xmath34-squeezed state of parameter @xmath64 that is centered on @xmath153 .",

    "therefore , we have verified that if alice wants to send a bit 0 and bob s thermal state is thereby decomposed into a gaussian mixture of @xmath34-squeezed states @xmath161 , the resulting state becomes a gaussian mixture of amplified @xmath34-squeezed states @xmath164 with a stronger squeezing but which nevertheless remains phase - invariant , as illustrated in fig .",
    "the same reasoning is of course true regardless of the initially squeezed quadrature , so that the resulting state would be exactly the same if alice wanted to send a bit 1 and bob s thermal state was decomposed into a gaussian mixture of @xmath35-squeezed states .",
    "hence , no information whatsoever is available to bob and causality is preserved , even on a heralded basis .",
    "in summary , we have found that the hnla acts as a phase - insensitive or `` universal '' single - mode squeezer in the sense that any squeezed state is transformed into another squeezed state with a stronger squeezing of the quadrature that was initially squeezed .",
    "this `` universal '' squeezing is superimposed with a nonlinear amplification of the mean field of the input state , as the gain is proportional to @xmath97 corrected with an additional factor that underamplifies the initially squeezed quadrature and overamplifies the initially antisqueezed quadrature .",

    "<S> a non trace - preserving map describing a probabilistic but heralded noiseless linear amplifier has recently been proposed and experimentally demonstrated . here </S>",
    "<S> , we exhibit another remarkable feature of this peculiar transformation , namely its ability to serve as a universal single - mode squeezer regardless of the quadrature that is initially squeezed . </S>",
    "<S> hence , it acts as an heralded phase - insensitive optical squeezer , conserving the signal - to - noise ratio just as a phase - sensitive optical amplifier but for all quadratures at the same time , which may offer new perspectives in quantum optical communications . </S>",
    "<S> although this ability to squeeze all quadratures seemingly opens a way to instantaneous signaling by circumventing the quantum no - cloning theorem , we explain the subtle mechanism by which the probability for such a causality violation vanishes , even on an heralded basis . </S>"
