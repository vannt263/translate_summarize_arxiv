    "is the weather difficult to forecast because the world is so big ?",
    "do human hearts , unlike those of mice , sometimes spontaneously fibrillate because they are large enough to sustain a different kind of dynamics @xcite ? are there limits to building an arbitrarily powerful synchronous digital parallel computer because a sufficiently large network of coupled nonlinear computer clocks may become unstable to asynchronous behavior ?",
    "these questions capture the essence of some recent experimental and theoretical efforts to understand how the dynamics of physical systems may depend on their size .",
    "progress in answering these questions will likely be useful for engineering applications in which one wants to design , control , simulate , and forecast complex dynamical systems .",
    "but progress in understanding these issues is also rewarding in its own right .",
    "there is pleasure in discovering unifying principles that can explain the fascinating never - repeating patterns that are found in many chemical , mechanical , biological , electronic , fluid , and plasma driven dissipative systems @xcite .    in the following ,",
    "i review some recent and ongoing research , both experimental and theoretical , that is trying to answer these kinds of questions concerning the relation of dynamics to system size . for reasons that are discussed further below , my review focuses on a restricted class of sustained nonequilibrium systems , viz . , those that are nontransient , homogeneous , and not driven strongly out of equilibrium . these conditions represent idealizations and simplifications of the complexities that occur in many natural and artificial systems and so provide an important opportunity to obtain insight about how one particular mechanism  increase in size  may contribute to overall complexity .",
    "a particular hope is that studying the thermodynamic limit of infinitely large system size , @xmath3 , may prove especially productive for analyzing complex systems since various ideas from statistical mechanics , thermodynamics , and hydrodynamics may then apply @xcite .",
    "a related hope is that subsystems of a finite inhomogeneous system , over appropriate length and time scales , may be quantitatively understood in terms of what one learns from subsystems of infinite homogeneous systems .",
    "future research will need to address the challenging questions of transient dynamics , spatial inhomogeneities , and other routes to complexity that bring in more realistic details .    to illustrate the kinds of insights that one might obtain from a thermodynamic approach to large nonequilibrium systems",
    ", we can suggest a partial answer to the above question of whether the earth s weather is hard to predict because the world is so big .",
    "we idealize and assume that the earth s atmosphere can be treated as a homogeneous turbulent medium .",
    "we then carry out a thought experiment of letting the radius of the earth , and so its surface area , increase indefinitely while somehow keeping the composition of the atmosphere and its physical processes unchanged .    in this limit and",
    "assuming homogeneity , thermodynamics suggests that we think about two kinds of quantities for characterizing the dynamics @xcite : _ extensive _ quantities analogous to the energy , entropy , or mass of an equilibrium system , whose values grow in proportion to the system volume  @xmath1 ; and _ intensive _ quantities analogous to the pressure , temperature , chemical potential , or mass density of an equilibrium system , whose values are independent of system size ( for a sufficiently large size ) .",
    "extensive and intensive quantities arise from the locality of physical interactions ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2 ) . a sufficiently large subsystem of an infinite system is coupled only weakly to other subsystems , by an amount of order the ratio of its surface area ( which represents the region of coupling ) to its volume . over some time scale that increases with increasing subsystem sizesystems",
    "often relax towards equilibrium by diffusive processes so that a relaxation time would scale algebraically as  @xmath4 , where  @xmath5 is the system size .",
    "for decay of transients towards the attractor of a sustained nonequilibrium system , the scaling of relaxation time with system size is poorly understood . in some cases ,",
    "one finds algebraic , but slower than diffusive , scaling  @xcite while in some other cases the relaxation time grows exponentially with system size  @xcite . ]",
    ", the weak coupling implies that the subsystem dynamics will be approximately nontransient and uncorrelated with the dynamics of other subsystems . in the thermodynamic limit ,",
    "various parameters are extensive since they are proportional to the number of independent subsystems ( which are statistically identical by the assumption of homogeneity ) , or are intensive since they characterize a particular subsystem .    as discussed below in section  [ measures ] , theory and numerical experiments indicate that the fractal dimension of the measure of a dynamical system s attractor @xcite .",
    "it is a nonnegative number that is 0 , 1 , integer - valued , or real - valued for respectively fixed points , periodic behavior ( limit cycles ) , quasiperiodic behavior ( tori ) , and strange attractors .",
    "when calculated from time series , the dimension is useful to know since the ceiling of  @xmath0 provides an estimate of the minimum number of degrees of freedom of _ any _ mathematical model that can generate the particular dynamics@xcite ]  @xmath0 of a large homogeneous turbulent system such as our idealized atmosphere will be extensive , increasing in proportion to the surface area of the earth for a fixed atmospheric depth .",
    "in contrast , the largest positive lyapunov exponent is a real - valued measure of instability , giving the average rate of exponential separation of two infinitesimally close initial conditions in phase space @xcite . a positive exponent  @xmath6 is a commonly stated necessary criterion for a deterministic dynamical system to be chaotic . ]",
    "@xmath7 is an intensive quantity , becoming independent of system size  @xmath5 for large enough  @xmath5 .",
    "one can then argue that short - term meteorological forecasting is limited _ not _ by the large size of the atmosphere but rather by its many interacting components and their local nonlinear couplings .",
    "this follows since the forecasting time  @xmath8 is an intensive quantity , independent of system size in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "similar thermodynamic reasoning suggests ways to test other potential relations between quantities used to describe spatiotemporal dynamical systems .",
    "thus some researchers @xcite have speculated about possible relations between the reciprocal of the correlation time , @xmath9 , of time series obtained from a chaotic system and the largest lyapunov exponent  @xmath7 or between  @xmath9 and the metric entropy  @xmath10 ( a dynamical quantity that quantifies instability by the rate at which new information is created @xcite ) .",
    "but as pointed out by sirovich and deane @xcite , the time  @xmath11 is an intensive quantity and so should be related to other intensive quantities such as the exponent  @xmath7 or to the entropy density @xmath12 , rather than to extensive quantities such as the entropy  @xmath10 .",
    "similarly , the asymptotic exponential decay of the high - frequency part of the power spectrum  @xmath13 associated with a bounded deterministic system @xcite should have an intensive decay rate . verifying this intensive behavior could resolve some conjectures by sigeti @xcite , that this decay rate may be related to the intensive  @xmath7 or to the extensive entropy  @xmath10 .",
    "the assumptions of homogeneity and extensivity invoked in these arguments raise numerous interesting questions : is there a characteristic length scale above which a homogeneous nonequilibrium system becomes extensively chaotic ( @xmath14 ) and , if so , what determines this length scale ?",
    "in particular , is the earth s atmosphere extensively chaotic and is  @xmath7 indeed an intensive meteorological quantity ? as system size is increased ( with all other parameters held fixed ) , is there a gradual or abrupt transition to extensive scaling ?",
    "are intensive quantities such as  @xmath7 _ local _ quantities in that their values can be calculated from information localized to some region of space of an equilibrium system is intensive as a partial derivative at constant volume , @xmath15 , of extensive energy  @xmath16 with respect to extensive entropy  @xmath17 .",
    "but the temperature can be measured locally , e.g. , with a thermometer , without having to know first the global relation  @xmath18 . ] ?",
    "if so , by what algorithms ? perhaps most importantly , what intensive quantities should be used for characterizing large nonequilibrium systems ?",
    "the correlation functions , fractal dimensions and lyapunov exponents discussed below in section  [ measures ] are logical , rather than physical , choices suggested by mathematical theory .",
    "they lack the deeper significance of quantities such as energy , entropy , and temperature which ultimately follow from conservation laws of additive quantities @xcite .",
    "nonequilibrium systems generally lack conservation laws because of the fluxes of energy and matter required from external sources to drive systems from equilibrium .    in the absence of a fundamental theory of sustained nonequilibrium systems",
    "[ fundamental - theory - mentioned ] that can suggest the appropriate quantities to measure , this review will consider only some simple - minded ways to characterize spatiotemporal disorder , viz .",
    ", several different kinds of correlation lengths .",
    "although such lengths are crude ways to summarize the information available in correlation functions , and correlation functions themselves only represent lower - order statistical information of some probability distribution function , the study of correlation lengths is an important first step that can indicate which basic length scales are relevant in a large nonequilibrium system .",
    "a more refined analysis may occasionally be justified by the details of a particular experiment ( e.g. , the statistics of defects in bnard convection @xcite ) but further progress will ultimately depend on new theory .    as discussed below in section  [ measures ] , the extensive scaling of the fractal dimension with system volume suggests a relatively new measure of spatiotemporal disorder , the dimension correlation length  @xmath2 introduced by cross and hohenberg ( * ? ? ?",
    "* page 948 , eq .",
    "( 7.38 ) ) .",
    "researchers from my group at duke university , using a powerful parallel computer , have provided some of the first systematic studies of  @xmath2 for models of homogeneous spatiotemporal chaos @xcite .",
    "these calculations yielded the somewhat unexpected result that the length  @xmath2 is generally independent from , and smaller than , the correlation lengths derived from the more familiar two - point and mutual information @xcite correlation functions .",
    "this result has implications for physics and for simulation .",
    "one is that at least _ two _ length scales are needed to characterize homogeneous spatiotemporal chaos .",
    "another is that the concept of correlation is not so straightforward and care is required to choose the appropriate definition in some given context .",
    "a third implication is that the length  @xmath2 suggests one answer to what is meant by a `` big '' nonequilibrium system , namely one for which the system size  @xmath5 satisfies  @xmath19 .",
    "fourth , it is natural to speculate that the length  @xmath2 is the characteristic size of weakly interacting subsystems .",
    "if so , this has implications for using parallel computers to simulate the long - time dynamics of large spatiotemporal chaotic systems since one could replace a long time integration ( which is difficult to parallelize ) with a shorter time integration over a much larger spatial region ( which is easier to parallelize using domain decomposition ) .",
    "by analogy to ergodicity which allows one to replace ensemble averages by time averages , this could be called `` spatial ergodicity '' since the many independent subsystems in the large domain would constitute different realizations of the dynamics over the length scale  @xmath2 .",
    "the rest of this review is divided into the following sections . in section  [ complexity ] , several routes are discussed that lead to increased dynamical complexity .",
    "it is argued that the scaling of complexity with size is a particularly promising route from a theoretical point of view . in section  [ expts ] ,",
    "some representative large - aspect ratio experiments are discussed that have guided our understanding of the thermodynamic limit of spatiotemporal chaos . in section  [ measures ] , several different correlation lengths are introduced , including the dimension correlation length . the parametric dependence of the different correlation lengths",
    "are then discussed for numerical calculations on a particular two - dimensional model of spatiotemporal chaos .",
    "finally , in section  [ conclusions ] , key points of this review are collected and some questions identified for further research .",
    "this review is oriented towards the other participants of this workshop , i.e. , mainly towards fluid dynamicists who have worked more in the area of navier - stokes turbulence than in nonlinear dynamics and spatiotemporal chaos .",
    "for this reason , i have tried to be somewhat more pedagogical in motivating the questions asked and ideas used .",
    "the books by strogatz @xcite and ott @xcite are good references for nonlinear dynamics of low - dimensional systems while the book by manneville @xcite and the review article by cross and hohenberg @xcite provide good surveys of the nonequilibrium physics of spatially extended systems .",
    "readers might also find useful a more detailed knowledge of thermodynamics and statistical physics than is usually discussed in fluid dynamics texts , e.g. , at the level of landau and lifshitz @xcite or of callen @xcite .",
    "a specific motivation for investigating how dynamics may scale with system size is the fact that it remains extremely difficult to understand many of the complex nonequilibrium systems in nature or even in the more controlled settings of laboratory experiments such as rayleigh - bnard convection @xcite .",
    "a reasonable strategy might then be to study separately some of the different mechanisms that increase the complexity of nonequilibrium systems and then to study what happens when these different mechanisms are combined .",
    "( for now , i will avoid trying to pin down the slippery concept of `` complexity '' , which will be discussed briefly in section  [ measures ] . ) in this section , three routes to increased complexity will be discussed for sustained nonequilibrium systems : increasing the number of interacting components , driving the system further from equilibrium , and making the system large with other parameters held fixed .    before discussing these routes",
    ", it will be useful to clarify what is meant by `` understanding '' the spatiotemporal dynamics of a sustained nonequilibrium system and why our understanding is presently so poor .",
    "an essential prerequisite for understanding any physical system is that one can define its state mathematically and measure its state physically . how to define the state of a system is often _ not _ clear and can be ambiguous , e.g.",
    ", one can choose a microscopic ( molecular ) or a macroscopic ( continuum ) description of the same fluid .",
    "in either case , the state of a system is a set of numbers which is necessary and sufficient for solving certain known dynamical equations .",
    "( the set of numbers and the appropriate equations must often be discovered together which historically has been difficult in many cases . )",
    "once the state of a system is known , one can ask further questions such as : how to classify different states , how states change with parameters , what kind of bifurcations separate one state from another , how does the stability of states change with parameters , and how does transport of energy , momentum , or mass depend on a state .",
    "the difficulty of understanding spatiotemporal chaos lies precisely in finding a sufficiently _ reduced _ description of the system in terms of states that are mathematically well - defined , computationally accessible , and physically measurable .",
    "the navier - stokes equations are a valuable reduction of molecular dynamics but their turbulent solutions are , in turn , so complex that a further reduction and simplification would be useful at still longer wavelengths and over longer time scales .",
    "some tentative initial steps have been taken in finding such reductions[page : reductions ] @xcite but our knowledge remains quite limited .",
    "identifying the appropriate length scales over which a further reduction might be constructed , or even knowing whether such length scales exist , is a central unsolved problem .",
    "systems in thermodynamic equilibrium are perhaps an outstanding example to keep in mind that are well understood in the sense of knowing how to specify states .",
    "thermodynamic theory tells us that any _ two _ macroscopic thermodynamic parameters , say pressure  @xmath20 and temperature  @xmath21 , suffice to characterize an equilibrium system @xcite and remaining parameters can be determined from equations of state . for given thermodynamic parameters like  @xmath20 and  @xmath21 ,",
    "equilibrium states are not necessarily homogeneous and can exist in different phases and most substances exist in only a modest number of phases such as solid , liquid or gas phases .",
    "( some substances such as metallic plutonium have many crystalline phases but still no more than of order one hundred . )",
    "phases can undergo transitions as parameters are varied and the stability of a phase can be calculated from knowledge of its free energy .",
    "the phase transitions are mainly of two kinds , first - order ( subcritical or discontinuous ) and second - order ( supercritical or continuous ) .",
    "the theory of critical phenomena @xcite provides a powerful quantitative and experimentally tested method to characterize second - order phase transitions .",
    "there are critical exponents that describe how order parameters scale near a second - order transition , and these exponents have universal properties in that they depend only on a few details such as the lattice symmetry and spatial dimensionality of the equilibrium system .    by comparison ,",
    "our understanding of low - dimensional nonequilibrium systems is already in a much less satisfactory state , not even worrying about higher dimensional , spatially extended systems which is the concern of this review . while a `` microscopic '' state for a given set of ordinary differential equations ( abbreviated as o.d.e.s in the following ) is readily defined in terms of a point in some phase space",
    ", it is the `` macroscopic '' long - time description of the phase - space attractors that is not well understood . by using fourier analysis to compute the power spectrum of a time series of some dynamical system",
    ", the corresponding attractor can be classified simply and efficiently as being stationary , periodic , quasiperiodic , or nonperiodic @xcite . with some effort",
    "is computationally expensive for large  @xmath0 @xcite and remains impractical except for known mathematical equations in one- or two - space dimensions and for researchers with access to powerful computers . ]",
    ", the nonperiodic states can be partially further classified , e.g. , by their lyapunov spectrum or by their fractal dimension @xcite . at this time , a mathematical characterization and classification of attractors and of their bifurcations remains incomplete , especially of bifurcations from a non - chaotic state to a chaotic state or from one chaotic state to another . for spatially extended high - dimensional systems , even less",
    "is known about the kinds of attractors and bifurcations that can occur @xcite .",
    "it is an open and important question whether there are macroscopic parameters analogous to temperature or entropy that give a concise , useful , and computable description of spatiotemporal chaos at long wavelengths .",
    "i have taken some time to discuss what are largely elementary observations about the challenge of defining or measuring states of nonequilibrium systems since these are central issues in learning how to quantify such systems .",
    "the earth s atmosphere is a good example of a nonequilibrium system that remains poorly understood because we do not have useful ways to characterize its complex dynamics .",
    "the following is a partial list of why atmospheric dynamics is complex : the atmosphere is made up of many physical components such as nitrogen , carbon dioxide , water vapor , and ozone , leading to many coupled spatiotemporal fields such as temperature , pressure , velocity , and concentrations ; the atmosphere is inhomogeneous through the presence of clouds and through coupling to difficult - to - characterize topography such as deserts , forests , ocean surfaces , and ice caps ; the earth s atmosphere has a large geometric aspect ratio ( ratio of lateral width to depth ) and thus permits dynamics on long wavelengths ; and the atmosphere is strongly driven out of equilibrium by heating from the sun and so is highly turbulent , involving a huge range of length and time scales .",
    "also , the atmosphere remains difficult to observe since it is immense compared to the regions of earth where scientists live or can make measurements .    from this meteorological example",
    ", we can identify at least three distinct routes to increased complexity that ( unfortunately for theorists ) typically occur together in many nonequilibrium systems .",
    "these routes are : many interacting components , strong driving from equilibrium , and large size .",
    "we discuss these briefly in turn and then concern ourselves with this last route for the remainder of this article .",
    "one route to complexity arises by coupling more and more different components together .",
    "this kind of complexity can occur whether or not there are spatially dependent variables , e.g. , many elements can be wired together in an electronic circuit or all the chemicals of a chemistry set can be stirred together to see what happens . adding more and more components together corresponds mathematically to coupling more and more o.d.e.s and studying dynamics in a higher- and higher - dimensional phase space .",
    "the brain is complex in this way because of its many different components : there are many different kinds of neurons communicating chemically via many different kinds of neurotransmitters , and the neurons further communicate electrically though action potentials whose information content possibly depends on the geometric shapes of the different neurons .    presently , there is little useful knowledge about how any measure of complexity scales with the number of different components in a dynamical system , nor is it even clear how to pose this problem in a productive way .",
    "three of the more famous unsolved problems in science are linked to this approach to increased complexity .",
    "one is the origin of life , which possibly arose spontaneously out of a prehistoric chemical soup made up of sufficiently many reacting chemicals @xcite .",
    "a second problem is the characterization and stability of biological ecologies , which consist of many species ( components ) interacting in some given environment @xcite .",
    "a third problem is how the computing ability of neural tissue arose ( or arises ) from the coupling of many neurons .",
    "the mathematical and computational challenges of dealing with many interacting components are sufficiently severe that many researchers try to avoid this regime by studying systems with few components .",
    "this is one reason why fluid dynamical experiments such bnard convection and taylor - couette flow continue to play such an important role in nonequilibrium physics research @xcite , since there is already plenty of interesting dynamics to explore with just one component , say water or a gas .",
    "a second route to complexity is that of a system being driven strongly from equilibrium , which other speakers at this workshop have talked about . for fluid dynamicists",
    ", this is the familiar and challenging territory of high reynolds - number flows , e.g. , fluids pushed through a pipe at high velocity .",
    "this route is actually less general than adding more components or by increasing the system size @xcite since many physical systems change their properties substantially when driven too far from equilibrium . for example , chemical gradients in reaction - diffusion systems can be increased only so far before some component may start to precipitate out .",
    "the pumping field of a laser can be increased only so far before a laser may be ruined by an electrical discharge .",
    "increasing the temperature gradient across a system can lead to phase changes or to chemical decomposition .",
    "if strong driving can be attained , then a common consequence is the creation of spatiotemporal structure on ever smaller length scales compared to the size of the experimental apparatus itself . as an example , for fluid flow characterized by a sufficiently large reynolds number  @xmath22 , the kolmogorov theory of homogeneous turbulence tells us that there is a length that scales as  @xmath23 , below which the dynamics is damped out by dissipation and so can be ignored ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 33 ) .",
    "more generally , cross and hohenberg have speculated that the range of length scales ( and so the fractal dimension ) will grow algebraically as  @xmath24 for sufficiently large  @xmath22 , where  @xmath22 is the parameter driving the system from equilibrium and  @xmath25 is some positive constant ( * ? ? ? *",
    "eq.(7.3 ) , page 941 ) .",
    "since in a fourier representation of fields , an increasing number of fourier components become active and coupled as the reynolds number increases , one might consider the limit of strong driving as a particular case of the previously discussed route involving many coupled components .",
    "but the situation here is different since the addition and interaction of new modes with increasing  @xmath22 corresponds to a parameter change of fixed known equations ( the navier - stokes equations ) while the increase in the number of components of a chemical or ecological system corresponds to changing the mathematical equations themselves",
    ".      the third route to complexity is perhaps the most widely occurring and arises from making a system large compared to certain natural length scales while keeping fixed the number of components and the magnitudes of thermodynamic gradients ( which sustain the system in a nonequilibrium state ) .",
    "this approach has been studied quantitatively in the laboratory and by theorists only relatively recently because only in the last decade or so have computers become sufficiently powerful , inexpensive , and widely available so as to allow careful control of large experimental systems , and the accumulation and analysis of large amounts of spatiotemporal data .",
    "what is meant by a `` large '' experimental system here ?",
    "for many experimental systems that are driven slowly out of equilibrium by increasing some thermodynamic gradient , there is a stable uniform state that becomes linearly unstable to a nonuniform spatiotemporal state with a cellular structure . with increased driving",
    ", the primary linear instability typically occurs first at a critical wavelength  @xmath26 so that one can initially say that an experimental system of size  @xmath5 is large when its aspect ratio  @xmath27 . in section  [ measures ] , we will come across other larger lengths ( correlation lengths ) , compared to which the system should also be large .    presently , experimentalists can attain aspect ratios of order  @xmath28 to  @xmath29 while maintaining fairly uniform boundary conditions of the earth s troposphere ( where weather occurs ) , as estimated by the ratio of the earth s radius , @xmath30 , to a typical depth of the troposphere , about  @xmath31 @xcite ) . ]",
    "@xcite . for certain model equations and using gigaflop - class computers",
    ", computational scientists can simulate one - dimensional aspect ratios of order  @xmath32 @xcite and two - dimensional aspect ratios of order  @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "as impressive as these achievements are , these aspect ratios are tiny compared to the effective aspect ratio of order  @xmath33 for a macroscopic equilibrium crystal , which may be one centimeter on a side compared to a atomic lattice spacing of a few angstroms .",
    "this observation raises concerns whether experiments on even the largest nonequilibrium systems are attaining dynamics that are independent of the size and shape of the experimental apparatus , or that are independent of the choice of boundary conditions such as conducting or thermally insulating lateral walls .",
    "some of the results discussed in section  [ measures ] concerning the dimension correlation length suggest that aspect ratios of  @xmath34 are , in fact , sufficiently large for the dynamics to be considered statistically homogeneous and independent of boundary conditions but further quantitative studies are needed .    a serious difficulty in studying the large - aspect - ratio limit , either experimentally or computationally , is the diverging time scale for transients to decay with increasing system size .",
    "thus in recent large - aspect - ratio reaction - diffusion experiments of ouyang and swinney concerning the onset of chemical turbulence @xcite , typical experimental observation times were about a week or less .",
    "yet the lateral size of their reaction cell , @xmath35 , combined with the typical diffusion constant of their reagents , @xmath36 , gives a lateral chemical diffusion time  @xmath37 and so their experiments are only on the edge of being nontransient .",
    "similarly , lateral thermal diffusion times in convection experiments can be of order days for large cells in which case weeks or more of observation may be required to establish that transients have sufficiently decayed .",
    "finding experimental systems with fast time scales is then an important goal .",
    "two leading candidates from fluid dynamics are crispation experiments ( parametrically forced surface waves excited by shaking a container of fluid up and down periodically @xcite ) and convection experiments of a fluid near its critical point , which allows for extremely thin layers of fluid to be studied without creating substantial non - boussinesq effects @xcite .",
    "electronic and laser systems can be found with faster time scales but so far are less useful for quantitative comparisons with theory since they lack a mathematical description as accurate or as well parameterized as the navier - stokes equations .",
    "in addition to the long time scales for transients to decay in large - aspect - ratio nonequilibrium systems , a related complication is the lack of good diagnostics to identify the presence or end of transient behavior . in some calculations @xcite ,",
    "the transients seem statistically stationary over long periods of time and then change abruptly to a nontransient regime . as mentioned in the footnote on page",
    ", experiments , simulations , and theory suggest that the slowest time scale for transients to decay in a nonequilibrium system is sometimes not set by diffusion over the largest lateral dimension  @xmath5 , but by even slower mechanisms that are not well understood .",
    "this slower - than - diffusive scaling is possibly a consequence of intricately winding basins of attraction in a high - dimensional phase space although a quantitative demonstration of this idea is so far lacking .",
    "in this section , a few experimental results are summarized to indicate the kinds of insights that experiments have provided about large nonequilibrium systems , especially from convection experiments .",
    "only a few highlights will be given here since cross and hohenberg have given an especially complete and detailed review of convection experiments ( as well as of other experimental systems ) , to which the reader should turn for more details and references @xcite .",
    "a key conclusion will be that spatiotemporal chaos is a common phenomenon in large - aspect - ratio nonequilibrium systems , even for weak driving in the sense of maintaining a system just above the onset of a primary bifurcation from a uniform to non - uniform state .",
    "visually , the time evolution of various fields involves the creation , annihilation , motion , and interaction of defects , which are regions where a local spatial periodicity can not be defined .",
    "once a goal of studying the scaling of complexity with size has been identified , the discussion of section  [ complexity ] suggests that one should try to find experimental systems that avoid the other routes to complexity .",
    "this can be done by choosing systems with as few components as possible ( to reduce the total number of coupled equations ) , by choosing systems that are driven out of equilibrium as weakly as possible ( so that nonlinearities are weak and more easily treated mathematically , and to reduce the range of length and time scales that need to be considered ) , and by choosing systems for which one can construct high - precision homogeneous large - aspect - ratio experiments with good visualization and good reproducibility .",
    "these are difficult goals and it is impressive that experimentalists have succeeded in approaching these idealizations for a variety of systems .    theorists would add another goal for experimentalists , which is to simplify the mathematical effort by identifying systems that can be quantitatively described by models with only one spatial variable . this has turned out to be more challenging to achieve than many researchers expected since boundary conditions that restrict an experimental medium to one - dimensional behavior often raise the threshold for the onset of chaos to strong levels of driving . because of the challenges of finding one - dimensional large - aspect - ratio systems with interesting dynamics near onset , many experiments continue to be done in @xmath38 dimensions , in which there are two large lateral directions and a short transverse direction .",
    "few experiments or simulations have been done in truly three - dimensional large - aspect - ratio systems , although there is growing interest in this topic , e.g. , for researchers studying excitable media who would like to know whether the onset of fibrillation depends on the three - dimensional structure of heart muscle @xcite .    somewhat by trial and error and for historical reasons , rayleigh - bnard convection ( fig .",
    "[ fig : convection - apparatus ] )     and the gap is filled with a fluid such as water .",
    "a spatially uniform and time - independent vertical temperature gradient is imposed on the fluid by heating the bottom plate to a fixed temperature  @xmath39 ( e.g. , by a variable current flowing through resistors ) and cooling the upper plate to a temperature  @xmath40 where  @xmath21 is the mean temperature of the fluid .",
    "the positive temperature difference  @xmath41 across the fluid is the bifurcation parameter for driving the system from equilibrium . *",
    "( b ) * cross - section of curved convection rolls .",
    "for light directed vertically into the fluid and reflected off the bottom plate , the alternating warm and cold regions of convecting fluid act as diverging and converging lenses , allowing the spatial pattern to be visualized by shadowgraphy as alternating light and dark bands ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : convection - patterns ] ) .",
    ", width=336 ]    has become a central paradigm for experimental and theoretical research in large - aspect - ratio nonequilibrium physics .",
    "convection does not quite involve the minimum number of components possible in a fluid experiment since there is a temperature field in addition to the usual velocity and pressure fields of the navier - stokes equations .",
    "but the presence of the temperature field has the important consequence of allowing a continuous bifurcation , from a uniform motionless conducting state to a state of finite - amplitude convection rolls in which warm fluid rises and cold fluid falls spatially over a characteristic wavelength that is basically twice the depth  @xmath42 of the fluid , @xmath43 . some other experimental advantages of rayleigh - bnard convection are the ease of building highly precise containers with static homogeneous boundaries , the ease of visualization throughout the interior of the fluid , the slow increase in complexity of the dynamics as the temperature gradient is increased , and the absence of a mean flow . as pointed out above , a drawback is the long time scale for transients to decay , a lower bound for which is given by the horizontal ( lateral ) thermal diffusion time .",
    "a convection experiment can be described by a minimum of three dimensionless parameters @xcite .",
    "the most important is the rayleigh number  @xmath44 where  @xmath45 is the thermal - expansion coefficient of the fluid , @xmath46  is the acceleration of gravity ( the source of buoyancy forces ) , @xmath42 is the depth of the fluid , @xmath41 is the vertical temperature difference across the plates , @xmath47 is the kinematic viscosity , and  @xmath48 is the thermal diffusivity . in a typical experiment or simulation , all of the parameters entering the rayleigh number",
    "are fixed except the temperature difference  @xmath41 , and so the rayleigh number is conveniently thought of as being proportional to the temperature difference across the plates .",
    "a linear stability analysis of the conducting fluid in a laterally infinite layer shows that convection begins when the rayleigh number increases beyond a critical value  @xmath49 , which corresponds to a temperature difference of a few degrees celsius in room - temperature water experiments with fluid depths of a few millimeters .",
    "since the bifurcation to convection is continuous , it is convenient to introduce a reduced rayleigh number , @xmath50[eps - defn ] which is a small parameter near onset .",
    "perturbative expansions in  @xmath51 near onset lead to the amplitude equation formalism @xcite which has made many successful quantitative predictions concerning pattern formation .",
    "a second dimensionless parameter is the prandtl number  @xmath52 , which is the ratio of the strengths of the two channels of dissipation .",
    "the prandtl number influences the types of secondary bifurcations which convection rolls undergo at higher rayleigh number , but weakly affects the dynamics sufficiently close to onset .",
    "it is a fluid property that is weakly dependent on temperature and is of order one for many gases .",
    "different experimental values can be selected by using different fluids such as large-@xmath53 oils , moderate-@xmath53 gases , and low-@xmath53 liquid mercury .",
    "a third dimensionless parameter is the aspect ratio  @xmath54 ( where  @xmath5 is the largest lateral distance ) , which determines how weakly the lateral boundaries influence the dynamics . for this review ,",
    "the aspect ratio is the interesting parameter since it provides a way to increase dynamical complexity .",
    "computational scientists can simulate three - dimensional convection with periodic lateral boundary conditions in which case only the parameters  @xmath22 , @xmath53 , @xmath55 , together with initial data , need to be specified . for experimentalists who require real walls to contain a fluid",
    ", other parameters must be considered such as the thermal boundary conditions on the lateral walls ( which often have a thermal conductivity comparable to the fluid ) and the shape of the container .",
    "experimentally and theoretically , the influence of these other parameters on dynamics is not well understood although some experiments show that the choice of lateral boundary conditions can strongly influence the spatiotemporal dynamics @xcite .",
    "how this influence varies with increasing aspect ratio is a key question to resolve with future research .",
    "the quantitative study of large - aspect - ratio dynamics began in  1978 , with a pioneering rayleigh - bnard convection experiment by guenter ahlers and robert behringer who were then at at&t bell laboratories @xcite .",
    "these researchers studied the onset of convection in liquid helium at cryogenic temperatures of a few degrees kelvin . using convection cells with three different aspect ratios of about  2 , 5 , and  57",
    ", they made the remarkable and unexpected discovery that the rayleigh number  @xmath56 at which turbulent or chaotic behavior was first observed ( as the rayleigh number was increased in small constant steps from below to above the onset of convection ) decreased with increasing  @xmath55 , and seemed to approach the onset of convection itself , @xmath57 , as the aspect ratio became large .",
    "in fact , within experimental error the ahlers - behringer experiment for  @xmath58 said that the onset of chaos coincided with the onset of convection , @xmath59 .",
    "this last point was a particularly exciting development since it showed for the first time that a turbulent state existed in a parameter range that might be quantitatively amenable to perturbation theory ( in the small parameter @xmath60 ) .",
    "the discovery of chaos close to the onset of convection in a large aspect - ratio cell was a big surprise at the time and is still not well understood today , eighteen years later .",
    "the reason for the surprise was that a linear stability theory of periodic two - dimensional roll solutions of the boussinesq equations in a laterally infinite container , had been developed over many years by fritz busse and collaborators @xcite .",
    "this theory predicted that stable time - independent periodic convection rolls should exist sufficiently close to onset , with the roll wavelengths lying in a known range that depends on both  @xmath22 and  @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "this prediction had been qualitatively confirmed by prior experiments in smaller aspect ratio cells and was therefore expected to be more quantitatively correct in the limit of large aspect ratio , which approached the theoretical assumption of a laterally infinite container .",
    "busse s theory further predicted that , with increasing  @xmath22 , _ all _ periodic two - dimensional rolls eventually became unstable above some rayleigh number  @xmath61 although some rolls may first become unstable for values of  @xmath22 smaller than  @xmath62 depending on their wavelength .",
    "what happens for @xmath63 ( all two - dimensional periodic rolls unstable ) is a long - time nonlinear effect not predicted by a linear analysis : the unstable rolls could evolve into a new stationary pattern ( e.g. , consisting of curved convection rolls ) or into a sustained time - dependent state . in any case , the linear stability theory together with prior experiments suggested that any time - dependent behavior , and certainly any chaotic behavior , would not be seen until the reduced rayleigh number  @xmath64 was of order one , and this result should hold especially in the limit of large aspect ratio .",
    "an irony of this pioneering experiment was that no visual information was available to indicate the spatial patterns of the convecting fluid .",
    "ahlers and behringer had obtained their conclusions by analyzing time series of the nusselt number , which is a dimensionless scalar measure of the total heat transported from the bottom plate to the top plate of the convection experiment . not until 1985 , with an innovative high - pressure gas experiment of pocheau , croquette , and le gal @xcite , did researchers succeed for the first time in visualizing large - aspect - ratio convection patterns .",
    "the details of that experiment largely exceeded the imagination of those who had tried to guess the mechanism of the time dependence in the ahlers - behringer experiment .",

    "we finish this section by coming back to one of the questions raised by the ahlers and behringer experiment : is it true that the onset of chaos approaches the onset of convection in the limit of infinite aspect ratio : @xmath57 as  @xmath71 ?",
    "this seems to be a delicate question that will be difficult to settle by experiment or by simulations , because of the diverging transient time as  @xmath55 becomes large . to some extent , interest in this question has been preempted by more recent theory and new experiments which show that , for a convection cell rotating at a constant angular frequency  @xmath72 , the onset of chaos should rigorously coincide with the onset of convection above a critical rotation speed  @xmath73 .",
    "this system thus seems to be particularly attractive for studying the thermodynamic limit since analytical progress should be possible near onset @xcite .",

    "[ fig : convection - patterns ] . in these cases",

    "this is utterly impractical for spatiotemporal data of the sort represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : convection - patterns ] since there is no known way of calculating many lyapunov exponents from time series recorded from high - dimensional systems .",
    "instead , one might hope to exploit the fact that  @xmath2 is an intensive quantity and so might depend only on information localized to some region of space .",
    "there have been two recent attempts to estimate the value of  @xmath2 from time series by generalizations of the procaccia - grassberger algorithm @xcite for low - dimensional systems @xcite but these efforts lack a rigorous justification and their numerical convergence is not convincing .",

    "while this approach can not quantitatively predict the value of  @xmath2 , calculations for the miller - huse model show that the length  @xmath173 behaves qualitatively like  @xmath2 as the coupling  @xmath46 is varied , and so might serve the purpose of an easily calculated , localized order parameter for characterizing large , weakly inhomogeneous , spatiotemporal chaotic systems .",
    "this survey article has discussed recent and ongoing efforts to understand how one particular mechanism  increase of system size  affects the complexity of nontransient homogeneous sustained nonequilibrium systems .",
    "perhaps the single most important idea from this discussion is that of _ extensive chaos _ : for sufficiently large homogeneous chaotic systems , the fractal dimension  @xmath0 ( effective number of degrees of freedom ) becomes proportional to the volume  @xmath1 of the system as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : extensive - chaos ] .",
    "this mathematical statement can be interpreted physically as saying that big homogeneous systems become complex in a simple way with increasing size , by replicating weakly - interacting and statistically similar subsystems of some characteristic size that we have defined as the dimension correlation length  @xmath2 .",
