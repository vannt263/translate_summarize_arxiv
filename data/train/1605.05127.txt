    "in the physics of relativistic heavy ion collisions , the determination of the initial collision geometry is one of the fundamental pieces to investigate the dynamics of the created matter such as quark - gluon plasma .",
    "then the information of the reaction plane is indispensable to study the anisotropic collective flows of the matter .",
    "such a geometry is deduced indirectly from , for example , the statistical average over an event ensemble by calculating the cumulant of the correlation functions of hadrons which are generated through very complex strong interactions @xcite . on the other hand , photons do not suffer from strong interactions , and the so - called direct photons are considered to carry the information of the early stage of the collisions .",
    "numerous works in this line have been done from the early days of the relativistic heavy ion program @xcite .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review on this subject and references therein .    among various mechanisms for producing the direct photons",
    ", we can consider bremsstrahlung radiations .",
    "this process is usually modeled as classical radiations from the decelerated protons of the incident nuclei @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors focused on the behavior of the higher energy ( @xmath1 gev ) of the photons which are dominantly produced by the incoherent sum of the bremsstrahlung radiations from individual decelerated protons , reproducing the spectrum of the observed one @xcite . in this case , any meaningful information for the initial geometry of the nuclear scale is expected to be washed out .    on the other hand , for the lower energies",
    ", electromagnetic fields may be generated _ coherently _ from each decelerating proton , when their spatial separation is the order of the corresponding wavelength of the radiations .",
    "if this occurs , we expect the following two effects .",
    "one is that the amount of the radiations increases as @xmath2 , instead of @xmath3 in the incoherent case , where @xmath4 is the effective number of the charges which contribute to the electromagnetic radiations in the collisions .",
    "the other is that the angular distribution of the radiated photons will reflect the geometric configuration due to the interference of radiations from the two incident nuclei .",
    "when we have a sufficient yield of the coherent photons in the very low transverse momentum @xmath5 region , the elliptic flow @xmath0 for the direct photons will be dominated by such coherent photons .    in this work",
    ", we study the photon spectrum and its angular distributions of the low energy photons , which are produced by the coherent radiations from two decelerated incidents nuclei .",
    "we first calculate the electromagnetic fields by introducing the simplified trajectories of the two incident nuclei .",
    "these nuclei are treated as point - like objects with an effective charge @xmath4 . from this",
    ", we obtain the phase space distribution of the photons with the help of the wigner function which expresses the photon spectrum and the angular distribution .",
    "we further show that the corresponding anisotropic parameter @xmath0 reveals a very enhanced nature in the lower @xmath5 .    in the following , we use @xmath6 and the fine structure constant",
    "is defined by @xmath7 in the si ( rationalized ) unit .",
    "let us consider a collision of two identical nuclei with the impact parameter @xmath8 . in the strong coherence limit",
    ", we can simplify the situation by replacing these nuclei with point - like particles which have an effective charge @xmath9 .",
    "one may expect that @xmath4 is the same as the number of participant protons @xmath10 from one of nuclei , but more generally , only a portion of the participant protons can contribute to the coherent radiations .",
    "then we have the restriction , @xmath11 .",
    "we further consider that the protons in each nucleus will be completely stopped by the collisions with other protons or neutrons , as is the initial condition of the landau hydrodynamic model .",
    "our geometrical coordinate is represented in fig .",
    "[ collision ] , where the @xmath12axis is chosen as the collision direction and the two incident nuclei collide at @xmath13 .",
    "in general , the deceleration by the collisions occurs in a finite time period , which is characterized by stopping time @xmath14 . for the ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions ,",
    "@xmath14 is given by the order of the lorentz contracted thickness of the projectile , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the nuclear radius and the lorentz factor , respectively . for relativistic limit @xmath18 , then the stopping time will be very small . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "we consider the infinitesimal limit of @xmath19 in this case , the deceleration is given by the dirac delta function in time .",
    "see also the discussion in appendix [ app : finite ] .",
    "then the trajectories of the nuclei @xmath20 and @xmath21 are , respectively , expressed in the cartesian coordinates as @xmath22 where @xmath23 represents the transverse distance between the two centers of mass of the respective participant protons ( see fig .  [ collision ] ) .",
    "this is usually smaller than the impact parameter , @xmath24 at infinite distance ( @xmath25 ) , the nuclei move with a constant speed @xmath26 which should be less than one .",
    "the solution of the maxwell equations for these trajectories is given by the linard - wiechert potential @xcite .",
    "since we are interested in the behaviors of the radiations at the detector position , we drop irrelevant contributions at infinite distance .",
    "then , the contributions from the charge @xmath27 are given by @xmath28where @xmath29 is a unit vector of the @xmath12axis and @xmath30all these quantities appearing on the right hand sides are evaluated at the emission time @xmath31 , defined by the causality equation , @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , eliminating the emission times , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are reexpressed as    @xmath35    [ e1b1 ]    where @xmath36 .",
    "the corresponding electromagnetic fields from @xmath37 can be obtained by replacing the two parameters , @xmath38 by @xmath39 in eq .",
    "( [ e1b1 ] ) .",
    "to extract the spectrum of the photons radiated from the classical electromagnetic fields , ref .",
    "@xcite employs an interpretation that the frequency distribution of the radiation energy as the energy distribution of photons with the help of einstein s relation . on the other hand",
    ", it is known that the classical electromagnetic field can be interpreted as the wave function of the corresponding photons @xcite . here",
    "we employ this approach to calculate the photon angular distribution .",
    "let us introduce a complex vector function as @xmath40then source - free maxwell s equations can be reexpressed in a similar form to the dirac equation as @xmath41with a constraint,@xmath42where @xmath43 is the spin-1 generator of @xmath44 .",
    "equation ( [ constraint ] ) constrains only the initial condition of @xmath45 . from the definition",
    ", one can easily see that the energy density and the poynting vector are expressed as @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "other properties of this quantum mechanical interpretation of the vector wave function , see ref .",
    "@xcite .    to discuss physical observables measured by a detector at a given location ,",
    "it is convenient to introduce the phase - space distribution function , known as wigner function . in the present case",
    ", we have@xmath48 where @xmath49 represents the contribution from the electric ( magnetic ) field .",
    "after some algebra , we find @xmath50 and@xmath51 here , @xmath52 .",
    "as is well - known , the wigner function does not correspond to the phase - space distribution , since , in general cases , it can take negative values .",
    "however , as shown below , the large distance behavior guarantees the non - negativity of the wigner function . since @xmath53 and @xmath54 are macroscopic quantities associated with the physical measurements by a detector , they are much larger than the magnitude of @xmath55 , where @xmath56 being the order of mev @xmath57 gev .",
    "thus , the significant contributions in the @xmath58 integrals in eq.([f0 ] ) come from the domain satisfying @xmath59 due to the exponential factor in the integrands . therefore we can safely expand them with respect to @xmath60 .",
    "the integrands contain the product of two delta functions with respect to @xmath54 , which is approximately reexpressed as @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the component of @xmath63 parallel to @xmath53 .",
    "then we have @xmath64where @xmath65 is the orthogonal component of @xmath66 to @xmath53 , and @xmath67 in the above , @xmath68 is the azimuthal angle of @xmath53 with respect to the @xmath69 axis ( see fig.1 ) . for @xmath70",
    ", we find @xmath71and @xmath72then the wigner function is finally expressed as @xmath73where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the solid angles for @xmath76 and @xmath77 respectively .",
    "the factor @xmath21 in the last term of the above equation comes from the two opposite directions contained in @xmath78 .",
    "equation ( [ wignerfinal ] ) clearly shows that @xmath79 is positive semi - definite .    from this wigner function , the energy distributions in the @xmath53 and @xmath80 spaces are given by @xmath81 and @xmath82 respectively .",
    "substituting eq .  ( [ wignerfinal ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ dedp ] ) , we obtain the momentum spectrum . because of the dirac delta functions in eq .",
    "( wignerfinal ) , note that this is equivalent to the sum of all energies of the incoming photons to a detector at @xmath83 , @xmath84where the integral for the solid angle @xmath85 is done within the domain @xmath86 corresponding to the aperture of the detector . in the above , we integrate all photon energies coming into the detector .",
    "reexpressing this with the photon number @xmath87 , we have @xmath88where @xmath89 represents the rapidity",
    ". see appendix [ app : rapidity ] . in the following calculations ,",
    "we choose @xmath90 .",
    "for example , let us take @xmath91 and @xmath92 fm as a near central au+au collisions . in this case , the order of the magnitude of the photon spectrum is@xmath93where @xmath94 is the bessel function of order @xmath95 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] , we show the behavior of the above rough estimate ( solid line ) together with the phenix data , just for the sake of comparison . although our calculation seems to be consistent with the experimental data , our idealization of full stopping is not well satisfied in rhic energies .",
    "rather , our model will be more suitable for the experiments of the lower energies such as nica or fair program @xcite where the large stopping power is expected .",
    "note that if we calculate the same spectrum assuming the incoherent radiations as is done in ref .",
    "@xcite , the magnitude of the spectrum decreases by one or two order .",
    "the angular distribution of the photons reveals an interesting behavior as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : angular ] . here",
    ", we plotted only the factor @xmath96 in the radial coordinate with respect to the azimuthal angle @xmath97 at the vanishing rapidity @xmath98 where @xmath99 , and we find that there are common dips at @xmath100 .",
    "these dips correspond to the direction of the normal vector to the reaction plane .",
    "if such a feature is measurable experimentally , we could determine the event plane unmistakably and even determine the parameter @xmath101 quantitatively .    .",
    "the solid , dashed and dotted lines represent the results of @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 mev , respectively . the axes @xmath105 and @xmath89 correspond to those in fig",
    ".  collision .",
    "]    however , unfortunately , the total yield of such low energy photons is very small @xmath106 even in a most favorable condition of our model .",
    "if we consider further experimental difficulties in the detection of the low energy photons , the determination of the event geometry in the ebye base seems to be unrealistic .    on the other hand ,",
    "the above peculiar behavior will be reflected in another tractable observables , the anisotropic parameter such as @xmath0 . in our model , @xmath107 is calculated as @xmath108a similar expression was calculated by ref .",
    "@xcite in a different context . in fig .",
    "[ fig : v2 ] , we plotted the above @xmath0 for @xmath109 fm as before .",
    "in contrast to the well - known behavior of @xmath0 , the coherent electromagnetic radiations show an increasing @xmath0 for the lower @xmath110 achieving its maximum value @xmath111 for @xmath112 , independently of the value of @xmath101 . therefore ,",
    "if such an increase of @xmath0 in the low energy photons @xmath113 is found experimentally , it can be considered as the genuine signal from the coherent electromagnetic radiations by the deceleration , although it will be affected by the incoherent radiations .",
    "see the discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] .",
    "such a behavior is not expected from the usual hydrodynamic , kinetic or microscopic pictures of the collective flow mechanism @xcite .",
    "in this short exercise , we investigated the behavior of the low energy photons radiated by the deceleration processes of the two incident nuclei in relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "we assumed that the coherent radiations are dominant , so that the two colliding nuclei are replaced by point charges , and the deceleration mechanism is simply characterized by the dirac delta function .",
    "we thus consider the full stopping scenario like the landau type initial condition , which may have better chance in lower energy heavy ion collisions such as coming nica and fair experiments @xcite .",
    "we found that the angular distribution of the low energy photons reveals well the initial geometric configurations at the deceleration processes .",
    "such a property is reflected in the anisotropic parameter @xmath0 , showing a very enhanced nature in the lower @xmath5 .",
    "if the angular distribution is measurable in the ebye basis , the initial geometry could be determined .",
    "however , the total photon multiplicity in our model is the order of @xmath114 in an optimistic situation , so that the ebye basis analysis seems to be improbable . on the other hand , since these signals have characteristic patterns for a given initial geometry , they may be still useful to improve the determination of the initial condition by using , for example , the correlations with other particles .",
    "another interesting possibility for the multiple soft photon emission mechanism was suggested in ref.@xcite , but the nature of the angular distribution of the produced photons would be different from ours .    in this work , we considered a very idealized model of the deceleration where the coherent electromagnetic radiations occur from the overall nuclear charges , and did not discuss a mechanism to maintain such a coherence by relativistic heavy ion collisions . to clarify these points and examine the above possibilities , it is important to apply the present approach to more realistic initial conditions and possible collective deceleration mechanisms , for example , shock wave formation @xcite . the wigner function approach described here will be useful for this purpose .",
    "we leave this as a future task .     from direct photons .",
    "squares denote the results with the effects of incoherent mechanism given by eq.([v2-incoherent ] ) with @xmath115 gev , filled circles indicate the experimental data from phenix@xcite . ]    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : v2 ] , our coherent radiations of the low energy photons exhibit an increasing @xmath0 as energy decreases , achieving its maximum value @xmath111 at @xmath116 .",
    "this is the case considering only the coherent radiations .",
    "as discussed , the coherence for higher momenta will be quickly destroyed and the incoherent photons should be dominant .",
    "we may roughly evaluate such an effect assuming that the coherent contribution vanishes exponentially with a characteristic scale @xmath117 as a function of @xmath118 while the incoherent contribution becomes dominant for @xmath119 .",
    "in such a case , the anisotropic parameter @xmath0 in eq .",
    "( [ v2 ] ) is replaced by@xmath120 in fig .",
    "[ fig : v2-incoherent ] , we show the results of eq .",
    "( [ v2-incoherent ] ) for @xmath121 gev with squares . for the sake of comparison",
    ", the phenix data are plotted together by filled circles @xcite .",
    "note that in the presence of the incoherent contribution , @xmath0 vanishes at @xmath116 and the maximum is shifted to a finite value of @xmath5 .",
    "current experimental measurements of @xmath0 of the direct photons are only from @xmath122 gev and above @xcite , and thus it is still difficult to see whether the coherent radiation mechanism is present or not .",
    "however , it is interesting to note that the experimental data seems to show the beginning of such an increase for @xmath123 gev as is shown in fig .",
    "fig : v2-incoherent , which is qualitatively in agreement with the behavior of @xmath0 calculated with the coherent radiation mechanism .",
    "of course , our deceleration scenario is not applicable to the rhic experiment , so that any direct comparison will not be appropriate .",
    "on the other hand , if this behavior of @xmath0 is attributed to the coherent radiations of the photons , we expect that such a signature should be enhanced in nica and fair . in this aspect ,",
    "the measurements of the lower energy direct photons are essential to clarify the presence of the coherent mechanism in relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
