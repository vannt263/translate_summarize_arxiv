    "most of our knowledge about the gamma - ray burst ( grb ) phenomenon is derived from their spectra and light curve profiles , but it is recognised that other observational probes ( e.g. , polarisation of the gamma - rays ) would give key information to the solution of the grb enigma . among these probes",
    ", it is recognised the importance of the erratic time variability of the grb time profiles .",
    "for example , in the grb internal shock model , not very variable radiation is expected to be produced at radii lower than the photosphere radius in which the shocks remain optically thin to pairs @xcite , while highly variable radiation is expected to be produced in shocks above this radius @xcite .",
    "also in the sub - jet model by @xcite , time variability is expected and its amplitude related to the viewing angle of the burst .",
    "a key objective of the study of grbs is to establish whether grbs can be reliably used as standard candles and to determine the optimal relationship between observed and intrinsic properties .",
    "the recent discovery of grbs with bright afterglows at redshifts @xmath10 highlights their power as probes of the high redshift universe @xcite , but spectroscopically - confirmed redshifts are only a fraction . in contrast , the characteristics of gamma - ray light curves , which are available for all grbs , offer a potentially independent estimate of luminosity distance for statistically - significant samples .",
    "an important problem , however , in deriving the intrinsic correlations is the interpretation of scatter in correlations , which may be produced by measurement methods , construction of samples with properties measured by satellites with differing response functions , small samples and different statistical analysis methods and intrinsic physical differences in the grb population @xcite . as sample sizes slowly increase , addressing these issues remains critical for the correct inference of intrinsic grb properties and thus their use as cosmological probes .    in this paper , we concentrate on a long - standing empirical relation that initially suggested a possible cepheid - like correlation between gamma - ray variability and peak luminosity of grbs @xcite .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter r01 ) , using a robust measure @xmath0 of the grb variability , for a sample of 13 grbs with known redshift , found that in the grb rest frame this measure is correlated with the grb peak luminosity @xmath1 . in the @xmath2@xmath3 plane",
    "the correlation was modelled with a linear function @xmath11 with the slope of the straight line @xmath12 and a sample variance along @xmath0 of @xmath13 , both parameters being obtained with the method described by @xcite ( hereafter called reichart method ) .",
    "this method was proposed to fit data sets affected by a sample variance in addition to the statistical variance ( called `` intrinsic variance '' ) of each data point .",
    "recently , first @xcite ( hereafter gfm05 ) and then @xcite ( hereafter g05 ) tested this correlation first using an extended sample of 32 grbs with known redshift ( gfm05 ) , and then with 551 grbs detected by _",
    "cgro_/batse @xcite for which a pseudo - redshift was derived by g05 exploiting the spectral lag - luminosity correlation @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the correlation was confirmed and in the @xmath14@xmath15 plane the slope of the straight line was found much lower than that derived by r01 ( @xmath5 derived by gfm05 ; @xmath6 derived by g05 ) .",
    "it was also found that , with the sample variance neglected , the straight line did not provide a good description of the data ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 for the samples considered by gfm05 and g05 , respectively ) . neglecting the sample variance",
    "was correctly questioned by @xcite ( hereafter rn05 ) , who however show that , also using the extended data set of gfm05 , the @xmath18 slope is given by @xmath19 , still in perfect agreement with the original value found by r01 and in strong disagreement with the value found by gfm05 .",
    "they attribute this disagreement to the fact that gfm05 do not include among the parameters of the fit the sample variance , which they estimate to be @xmath20 . in an unrefereed note",
    ", @xcite takes issue with the most recent paper by g05 , who confirms the results previously found by gfm05 .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss the reichart method and compare the results with those obtained following the treatment by @xcite ( hereafter called `` the dagostini method '' ) , which deals with the same problem of fitting data points affected by extrinsic scatter in addition the intrinsic uncertainties along both axes .",
    "we show with numerical simulations that the reichart method provides an inconsistent estimate of the @xmath18 slope in the specific case of the @xmath14@xmath15 data set , we discuss the likely reason for this inconsistency .",
    "we show that our original results are substantially confirmed by the dagostini method even taking into account the sample variance .",
    "finally we discuss the subsequent implications for the inferred physics of grb central engines and their relativistic outflows .",
    "the usefulness of the so - called variability / peak luminosity correlation is discussed in the broader context of recently discovered correlations between other observed and derived properties of grbs .",
    "the reichart method has as starting point the well known bayes theorem that , for inference of physical parameters , is widely discussed in several text books ( see , e.g. , dagostini 2003 ) .",
    "it states that the conditional probability that a set of parameters @xmath21 takes a particular value @xmath22 , given a data set @xmath23 , whose values depend on ( for instance , n independent observations of a quantity @xmath24 ) , is given by : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the available prior information , @xmath27 is the probability distribution of on the basis of the information @xmath26 , and @xmath28 is the conditional probability of getting the measured data set given the value @xmath22 and the information @xmath26 . the probability distribution @xmath27 is called prior probability , while the probability distribution @xmath28 is called likelihood function .",
    "the probability @xmath29 is introduced as normalization factor . in the case",
    "that no prior information is known , @xmath30 is generally assumed to be a uniform distribution and the range of the possible values of are those logically allowed . in this case",
    "the posterior probability and the likelihood function are equivalent .",
    "reichart ( 2001 ) concentrates on the derivation of the prior probability @xmath30 in the special case in which for two of the @xmath31 parameters , @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( in our specific case @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) , we have a set of @xmath31 pairs of measurements , from which it appears that the two are correlated with @xmath36 , were @xmath37 , with @xmath38 ,  , @xmath39 , are m intermediate parameters that describe the curve @xmath40 ( in our case @xmath41 , @xmath42 )",
    ". correctly the scatter of the parameter values @xmath32 and @xmath33 around the curve is assumed to be due partly to the measurement errors ( intrinsic scatter ) and partly due to weaker dependences of either parameters @xmath32 or @xmath33 on other , yet unmeasured , and even yet unknown , parameters ( extrinsic scatter or sample scatter ) .",
    "both the scatters for @xmath32 and @xmath33 , are assumed by reichart to be normally distributed and uncorrelated , with unknown standard deviations @xmath43 and @xmath44 of the extrinsic scatter of @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "the conditional probability of the values of the parameters @xmath37 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 given the measured set of data points and their uncertainties is thus derived under simplifying assumptions ( see section 2.2.2 of reichart 2001 ) , among which that the curve @xmath36 can be approximated by a straight line ( @xmath45 ) .",

    "also with the fitexy algorithm @xcite , the slopes obtained are much shallower than the correspondent obtained with the reichart method .",
    "in order to test the consistency of the estimate of the @xmath18 parameter obtained with each method , we performed various numerical simulations .    assuming the existence of a linear correlation between @xmath85 and @xmath86 with prefixed parameters ( @xmath18 , @xmath68 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) , using random number generators , proper data sets were produced and the data analysis was performed following both the reichart and the dagostini methods .",

    "@xcite interpreted the @xmath9 correlation as due to the effects of this pair - forming photosphere and the jet opening and/or viewing angles , when breaks are observed in the optical consistent with the jet interpretation .",
    "the power - law @xmath18 derived by those authors is @xmath145 , where they assumed @xmath146 , @xmath147 ( @xmath148 can be either the jet opening angle or the viewing angle for a universal jet pattern ) , @xmath149 ( @xmath150 is the minimum value of the lorentz factor distribution of the shells ) . following @xcite , if one takes @xmath151 , the expected power - law index is @xmath152 , which is consistent within 90% cl with the value we derived with the dagostini method .",
    "@xcite assumed @xmath153 and @xmath154 to explain the value originally found by @xcite and by @xcite of @xmath155 .",
    "@xcite started from similar assumptions : @xmath156 , i.e. a wider jet has a lower lorentz factor , equal mass colliding shells , a uniform @xmath157 distribution in logarithmic spaces in the interval 1  ms1  s ( @xmath23 is the separation between shells ) . using a simplified version of the @xcite variability they tried to reproduce the @xmath9 correlation with numerical simulations and found that @xmath158 seems to better account for @xmath18 values in the range of 34 , as found by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , from the same numerical results it turns out that smaller values of @xmath18 , compatible with the results obtained with the dagostini method , are given by assuming @xmath154 . as already pointed out by @xcite , this is more consistent with the value @xmath159 derived by @xcite , based on the study of the anticorrelation between peak luminosity and jet break time .",
    "from the results of @xcite , we infer that the results of the dagostini best - fitting parameter @xmath18 imply a stronger dependence of the lorentz factor on the opening angle as well as a smaller lorentz factor normalisation .",
    "likewise , @xcite studied the effects of varying the energy per unit solid angle in the collimated outflow on the correlations between variability , peak luminosity and spectral peak energy @xcite .",
    "they found that these correlations are accounted for if luminosity per unit solid angle @xmath160 ( where @xmath148 can be either the viewing angle for a structured jet pattern or the jet opening angle ) , strongly depends on the lorentz factor @xmath161 .",
    "while the effect of changes in the baryon loading of the wind is less relevant , as it does not account for the range of variability observed . in their figure  3 ,",
    "@xcite show the results in the @xmath9 space of some numerical simulations for different bulk lorentz factors : values for @xmath18 in the range 1.52 , i.e. like those found by gfm05 and those derived in this work with the dagostini method , are clearly compatible with the results of these simulations .",
    "the smaller value of @xmath18 we found with the dagostini method than with the reichart constrains differently the parameters @xmath18 depends on .",
    "moreover , the bigger extrinsic scatter of @xmath162 , 0.34 with the dagostini , 0.24 with the reichart method , means a bigger scatter in the distribution of some of these parameters .      after the discovery of the @xmath9 correlation by @xcite and @xcite , a number of papers used it as a luminosity estimator for several studies .",
    "@xcite applied it to derive the luminosity distribution @xmath163 and the grb formation rate as a function of redshift @xmath164 .",
    "@xcite studied the bivariate distribution of luminosity and redshift @xmath165 using the pseudo - redshifts obtained from a parametrisation of the @xmath9 correlation with @xmath133 .",
    "they found a correlation between luminosity and redshift parametrised as @xmath166 .",
    "different values of @xmath18 from @xmath167 to @xmath168 do not change their results qualitatively @xcite .",
    "@xcite exploited the @xmath9 correlation to study the rest - frame power spectral density ( psd ) in time domain for hundreds of batse bursts .",
    "in particular , the goal was to study the effect of photon scattering on variability .",
    "a correlation between the break frequency in the rest - frame psd and variability was found , based on @xmath169 .",
    "a smaller value of @xmath18 would mean that a grb with a given variability , whose dependence on @xmath170 is small , would be less luminous , i.e. nearer , thus with a corresponding smaller break frequency in the rest - frame psd .",
    "this relation would have to be rescaled consequently .",
    "more recently , other tighter correlations became popular , such as between the rest - frame peak energy @xmath171 and the isotropic - equivalent gamma - ray released energy @xmath172 , @xmath173 @xcite , between @xmath171 and the collimation - corrected gamma - ray released energy @xmath174 , @xmath175 @xcite .",
    "another relation between @xmath171 , @xmath172 and the rest - frame break time @xmath176 of the optical afterglow light curve has been discovered recently @xcite , which requires fewer assumptions than those of the ghirlanda relationship .",
    "the same relation as the amati holds with the same index of @xmath1340.5 when @xmath172 is replaced by the peak luminosity @xmath177 , or simply @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "recently , the amati relation has been confirmed for a sample of 53 long grbs and a fit with the dagostini method gives an extrinsic logarithmic scatter of 0.15 over 3 orders of magnitude over @xmath171 @xcite . in this case",
    "both methods give compatible results and this is consistent with the fact that @xmath178 .",
    "summing up , in the case of the amati relation , truncation effects are negligible .",
    "interestingly , @xcite studied the correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath171 before the discovery of the amati relationship . assuming different alternative values for @xmath18 , ranging from 2.2 to 5.8 , as originally found by @xcite",
    ", they found a correlation , @xmath179 , with @xmath180 ranging from 0.4 to 1.15 .",
    "the amati relation , whose extrinsic scatter is small with respect to that of the @xmath9 correlation , is more reliable as a luminosity estimator .",
    "hence , from the amati relation we should expect @xmath181 , so in the range 0.82.3 , which is consistent with the results of the dagostini method as well as those of gfm05 and g05 .",
    "we applied both reichart and dagostini methods to the samples of 32 grbs with known redshift and 551 batse grbs with pseudo - redshift considered by gfm05 and g05 , respectively .",
    "the goal was to estimate the slope @xmath18 as well as the scatter of the power law describing the correlation between variability and peak luminosity originally presented by @xcite .",
    "both methods account for an extra variance in addition to the intrinsic affecting each single point . from simulations",
    ", we found that when the sample variance @xmath90 is comparable with the total scatter along the same axis , @xmath91 , the reichart method tends to overestimate @xmath18 , while the dagostini still estimates it correctly . when the sample variance is negligible with respect to the total variance , the two methods give consistent results . in the specific case of the @xmath9 correlation , the two variances are comparable : in the case of the 32 grbs of gfm05",
    ", it is @xmath182 , @xmath122 ( reichart ) or @xmath183 ( dagostini ) .",
    "this explains the discrepancy between the two methods .",
    "we showed that the dagostini method is a reliable estimator of @xmath18 in this regime , whereas the reichart is no more .",
    "in particular , the best - fitting value for @xmath18 obtained with the dagostini method is @xmath184 and @xmath185 at 90% confidence level for the 32 grbs of gfm05 and for the 551 grbs of g05 , respectively .",
    "these values are significantly smaller than those obtained with the reichart method , which are consistent with previous results of r01 and rn05 .",
    "these results hold as far as the definition of variability given by r01 is assumed .    alternatively , from other definitions of variability based on different kinds of filter used to smooth the light curves",
    ", it seems to be possible to obtain a range of values for @xmath18 from @xmath1341 to @xmath1343 @xcite .",
    "one of the possible implications of a smaller value of @xmath18 than originally found by r01 on the interpretation of the @xmath9 correlation is that , in the jet emission scenario , we would expect a stronger dependence of the lorentz factor of the expanding shells on the jet opening angle @xcite .",
    "finally , other more recent and tighter correlations , such as the amati , ghirlanda , liang & zhang relations appear to be more reliable luminosity estimators than the @xmath9 one .",
    "in particular , our results of values of @xmath18 in the interval 12 obtained with the dagostini method , appear to be consistent with two independent relations : @xmath179 ( @xmath186 ) @xcite , and the equivalent version of the amati relation with the isotropic - equivalent peak luminosity instead of the isotropic - equivalent total released energy , @xmath187 . by combining the two , one expects @xmath181 , in agreement with the results reported here as well as those reported by gfm05 and g05 .    finally , the increasing number of grbs with spectroscopic redshift detected by _ swift _ @xcite will help extend the range in @xmath0 and better constrain the power - law fit of the @xmath9 correlation , with the benefit of a homogeneous data set of light curves all detected with the burst alert telescope ( bat ) onboard _ swift_. a thorough test of the @xmath9 correlation with bat data",
