    "in the underground located experiments , the cosmic muons are one of the main sources of background , which made their study a crucial step . when they are moving through a medium , such as rock or water , these highly energetic particles are initiating electromagnetic and hadronic showers before reaching the detector , and once they enter the detector they start showering again .",
    "therefore ; the showering process not only in the detector , but also in the environment of the detector is important and has to be taken in account when making simulation as it will be discussed in the following .",
    "+ for several years different monte carlo codes have been developed , and two of the most used in particle physics studies are fluka @xcite and geant4 @xcite .",
    "the models used in these codes were intensively tested and validated before they have been released for each monte carlo code .",
    "various studies were made to investigate the muon - induced neutron production in the liquid scintillator @xcite , but the simulations showed a discrepancy of at least @xmath0 when compared to the data .",
    "this article presents a point of view on doing the monte carlo studies , aiming to reconcile the simulations with the measurements .",
    "the monte carlo code used in this study is geant4 ( release 9.0 patch 02 ) , the physics processes selected for the simulations are similar to these described in ref .",
    "@xcite except for the gamma interactions where a standard electromagnetic package is used instead of `` low energy '' one .",
    "to evaluate the muon - induced neutron yield in the liquid scintillator , the simulations described in the refs .",
    "@xcite considered only the case of the muons showering within a volume of scintillator . moreover , in them , either a mono - energetic muons beam or a real underground muons spectrum were fired directly into a bloc of scintillator , but in all cases the predicted neutron yield was smaller by approximately at least 30@xmath1 than the measured data . since this observation was made with two different monte carlo codes- fluka and geant4- this discrepancy can not be inferred to the models implemented in these codes .",
    "especially , if the cross sections of the different physics processes in these codes agree well with the data as mentioned in the different references cited through this article .",
    "+ the idea investigated in this article is in order to explain the deficit noticed in the simulations , we have to consider the contribution of the muon - induced shower particles produced in the rock around the detector .",
    "the cosmic muons never cross alone over the detector .",
    "however , they are accompanied by their shower particles .",
    "these secondary particles will initiate different interactions , in the liquid scintillator , producing by the same way neutrons and radioactive isotopes .",
    "the use of shield can minimize the magnitude of the muon - induced shower particles entering the detector , but never can suppress them . on the other hand , the shield can also play the role as a target , and then be a source for the production of other secondary particles as described in ref .",
    "@xcite . + to evaluate the muon - induced neutron yield , the simulations described in the refs .",
    "@xcite used a very large volume of scintillator to let the muons develop their showers , the analysis was made within a smaller volume of scintillator . for the purpose of the work presented in this article and to be close to the experimental conditions , but at the same time to keep the generic aspect of the simulations , a different approach is used",
    "the size of the target scintillator was chosen to be comparable to the size of the different scintillator detectors used in the underground experiments .",
    "the bloc scintillator used as a target is a 10 meters cube of dodecane ( i.e. @xmath2 ) , with density @xmath3 .",
    "the bloc scintillator was surrounded by 1 meter of the rock , with a standard chemical formula @xmath4 and density @xmath5 . as mentioned in refs .",
    "@xcite , for a medium as the rock , the size of 1 meter is enough to develop the muons showers .",
    "different beams of @xmath6 mono - energetic @xmath7 were fired one at a time through the rock into the target , the energy of the muons beam was taken within the interval of 10 to 380 gev .",
    "a care was given to not double count the neutrons inelastically scattered .",
    "also , the neutrons penetrating the target after they have been created in the rock , were not counted .",
    "the neutrons created in the external rock constitute another aspect of the background studies , the refs .",
    "@xcite give a good perspective and a detailed study of their case .",
    "+ the fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the neutron yield obtained in the target scintillator from the geant4 simulations and compared to the available measurements .",
    "the agreement between the simulations and the data is better than that is obtained in the other simulations cited above",
    ". an excellent agreement is noticed between the actual simulations and the measurements reported by the kamland collaboration in the ref .",
    "@xcite , while the fluka and geant4 simulations described in the same reference and made in similar way as in the refs .",
    "@xcite , gave a neutron yield in the liquid scintillator lower by at least @xmath8 than the data .",
    "the agreement is also very good at low muon energy , with respect to the error bares .",

    "in the same study , the production of some relevant radioactive isotopes was investigated , too . at the sps experiment @xcite the energy dependence of the total cross - section of the cosmogenics radioactive isotopes",
    "was evaluated following the power law @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the muon energy . the tab .",
    "1 shows their yield dependence exponent on the incident muon energy .",
    "the result of the geant4 is compared with the data obtained from the sps experiment .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the main physics processes of the production of this kind of radioactive isotopes . at low muon energy ,",
    "the real photo - nuclear reaction is the dominant process . with increasing muon energy ,",
    "the contribution of the neutron inelastic scattering becomes more important , but the real photo - nuclear reaction remains dominant .",
