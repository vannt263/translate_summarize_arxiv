    "the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) provides an elegant solution to the @xmath2 problem of the mssm by the addition of a gauge singlet superfield @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the superpotential of the higgs sector then has the form @xmath4 .",
    "when @xmath3 acquires a vacuum expectation value , this creates an effective @xmath2 term , @xmath5 , which is automatically of the right size , _",

    "in the nmssm the electroweak scale originates entirely from the susy breaking scale .",
    "the addition of the singlet field leads to a larger particle spectrum than in the mssm : in addition to the mssm fields , the nmssm contains two extra neutral ( singlet ) higgs fields one scalar and one pseudoscalar as well as an extra neutralino , the singlino .",
    "owing to these extra states , the phenomenology of the nmssm can be significantly different from the mssm ; not at least because the usual lep limits do not apply to the singlet and singlino states .",
    "the nmssm has recently become very popular .",
    "most of the feynman rules are given in @xcite .",
    "the nmssm higgs phenomenology has been investigated extensively in @xcite ( a model variant without a @xmath6 term is discussed in @xcite ) .",
    "detailed studies of the neutralino sector are available in @xcite .",
    "the relic density of ( singlino ) dark matter has been studied in @xcite .",
    "the sfermion sector , on the other hand , has so far received very little attention , although here , too , one may observe differences as compared to the mssm . in this letter we therefore investigate the decays of squarks and sleptons in the framework of the nmssm and contrast them to the mssm case .",
    "we concentrate on the third generation ( stops , sbottoms and staus ) where we expect the largest effects , but also consider decays of selectrons , smuons and 1st/2nd generation squarks .    in the mssm",
    ", squarks and sleptons can decay via @xmath7 , @xmath8 with @xmath9 ( or @xmath10 in case of no mixing ) and @xmath11 .",
    "squarks can also decay into gluinos , @xmath12 , if the gluino is light enough .",
    "in addition , sfermions of the third generation ( @xmath13 ) can have the bosonic decay modes @xmath14 and @xmath15 @xcite . in the nmssm",
    ", we have additional decay modes into singlinos and singlet higgs states : @xmath16 with @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "pure singlets and singlinos couple in general very weakly to the rest of the spectrum .",
    "there are hence two potentially interesting cases : a ) large mixing of singlet and doublet higgs states and/or large mixing of singlinos with gauginos - higgsinos and b ) ( very ) light singlet / singlino states . in case",
    "b ) @xmath19 and @xmath20 are almost pure singlets with masses well below the lep bound of @xmath21  gev , and the singlino is the lsp .",
    "we investigate these cases in this letter and show that they can markedly influence the sfermion phenomenology .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    "we explain our notation , the potential and the relevant feynman rules . in section",

    "it is worth noting that the couplings between sfermions and singlinos only occur via the neutralino mixing .",

    "the corresponding bounds for the third generation are much lower because the yukawa couplings contribute to the rg running with opposite sign as the @xmath26 gauge coupling .",
    "we refrain , however , from imposing any such rg - inspired constraint in our analysis for two reasons : firstly because it is our aim to discuss the weak - scale phenomenology in the most general way using just one illustrative benchmark scenario , and secondly because the actual scale of susy breaking is unknown and may well be much lower than @xmath129 ( see e.g.  the nmssm variants of the models presented in @xcite ) .",
