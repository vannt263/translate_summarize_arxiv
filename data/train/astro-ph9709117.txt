    "rcw86 ( also g315.4 - 2.3 and msh 14 - 63 ) was for some time regarded as the historical remnant of the supernova ( sn ) of ad 185 ( clark & stephenson 1977 ) .",
    "recently , however , chin & huang ( 1994 ) presented convincing evidence that the event recorded by the chinese was not a sn at all .",
    "this makes rcw86 just one of many other galactic supernova remnants ( snrs ) .",
    "nevertheless , the asca x - ray spectra show that rcw 86 has some very special properties .",

    "the spectral resolution of the sis instruments is better than that of the gis ( 2% vs. 8% fwhm at 6  kev ) , but the latter have the advantage of better sensitivity at high energies .",
    "sis observations were made in 4 ccd faint and bright modes .",
    "we reduced the data with the nasa / heasarc  package v3.6 using standard screening criteria .",

    "[ image ] shows that the x - ray emission extends beyond the main shell .",
    "this was not seen in the hri image by pisarski et al .",
    "in particular the north_west _ of the remnant shows faint emission outside the main shell . this can not be an effect of the point spread function or interstellar scattering , because then one would expect a similar effect for the north_east _ of the remnant , where the main shell is as bright as in the northwest .",
    "furthermore interstellar scattering takes place preferentially at lower energies ( the photon cross section scales as @xmath19 , see predehl & schmitt 1995 ) , whereas fig",
    ".  [ ratio ] shows that the faint emission in the northwest is rather hard .",

    "the ratio map shows that we can identify two distinct regions in the southwest ( sw ) .",
    "for obvious reasons we will call spectra from these regions sw hard and soft",
    ". the sw soft region correlates very well with the emission ( smith 1997 ) , whereas the sw hard region shows a rough correlation with the radio map ( kesteven & caswell 1987 ) . the sw soft region is essentially the same as the bright boomerang - shaped shell in fig .",
    "[ image ] , although the sw hard region has some overlap with this shell , suggesting a projection effect .    in the fainter northeastern ( ne ) part of the remnant we also find hardness variations .",

    "[ spectra ] shows the spectra are distinctively different , but all have a characteristic peak arising from helium - like ne around 0.9  kev .",
    "the ne spectra are in general harder than the sw spectra .",
    "the correlation between faintness and hardness ( the softest emission comes from the brightest regions ) suggests that the shock has decelerated in the densest region compared with the fainter regions such as the northeast .    as noted above asca",
    "has a fairly large point spread function with broad wings making that the half power diameter is 3  ( tanaka et al . , 1994 , serlemitsos et al . 1995 ) .",
    "one might wonder how this affects the spectra in fig .",
    "[ spectra ] .",
    "most serious is the contamination of the sw hard spectrum by emission from the sw soft region for energies around 1  kev . for higher energies ( @xmath20 2  kev )",
    "it is the other way around . as an example , based on the pspc image and spectra we estimate that the contribution of the emission from the soft region on the spectrum of the hard region is less than 25% at 1  kev .",
    "such differences are much smaller than the overall differences between both spectra ( fig .",
    "[ spectra ] ) .",
    "we fitted the spectra from all regions with one and two temperature component nei models using the spectral code spex ( kaastra et al .",
    "the free parameters were : the emission measure ( em )  ( where @xmath21 is the distance , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , the hydrogen and electron number densities and @xmath24 the volume occupied by the plasma ) ; the ionization parameter ( @xmath25 being the time since the plasma was heated ) ; the electron temperature ; the interstellar column density  and the abundances of n , o , ne , mg , si , s , ar and fe . since in some cases the fe abundance can be estimated from both the fe - l and fe - k emission , we left the fe abundance of the hot ( i.e. fe - k emission ) and cool component free .",
    "in most cases the temperature of the hot component was not very well determined ; in order to prevent temperatures much in excess of what was found by ginga ( kaastra et al .",
    "1991 ) we set an upper limit to the temperature of @xmath26  kev .",
    "we have used the interstellar extinction model of morrison & mccammon ( 1983 ) .",
    "table  [ parameters ] lists the results .",
    "[ [ abundances . ] ] abundances .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + +    there are two remarkable things to be noted about the best fitting models .",
    "first , the  values are very low , in some cases as low as @xmath27m@xmath3s , one of the lowest value ever reported (  values a factor ten lower were recently reported for some regions of the vela snr based on rosat pspc spectra , bocchino et al . , 1997 ) .",
    "second , the abundances are peculiar . in general , the abundances are low , except for some cases of ar and fe .",
    "the high fe abundance is not simply an artefact of the model , which is clear from fig .",
    "[ ironk ] .",
    "it shows that the centroid of the fe - k complex is at 6.4  kev , indicating a fluorescent origin .",
    "the ar fluorescent emission at 3  kev is present in both the sis ( fig .",
    "[ spectra ] ) and the gis spectra .",
    "note that fluorescence caused by irradiance is very unlikely in view of the large column densities and the large radiation field needed .",
    "so are the low abundances real",
    "? what could possibly be the origin of the abundance pattern ?",
    "an approach to these problems is to analyze the assumptions made in fitting the spectra .    in the spectral code abundances",
    "are essentially determined by the line to continuum ratios .",
    "the continuum is supposed to be mainly bremsstrahlung from electron - ion collisions , assuming a maxwellian electron energy distribution .",
    "furthermore , the assumption is made that the plasma can be approximated by a simple one or two component plasma model assuming constant temperature , although in reality temperature and density gradients must be present . for most snrs",
    "such a model works reasonably well . a possible extra source of continuum radiation can originate from synchrotron radiation arising from shock accelerated electrons with energies of the order of a few tev .",
    "such a model has been proposed for sn 1006 ( koyama et al .",
    "however , in our case this explanation does not work .",
    "first of all , the sw soft spectrum is too soft to be dominated by a synchrotron component which is usually assumed to have a power law behaviour .",
    "the second reason is even more compelling : a power law component makes it even harder to understand why we see such a relatively strong fe - k complex around 6.4  kev .",
    "another way to deal with underabundances , dust depletion , is very unlikely in this case because the abundance pattern we find is not what one expects it to be in case of dust depletion .",
    "for instance ne is underabundant , whereas it can not be depleted in grains .",
    "nevertheless , although it does not explain our overall results , dust depletion may give an additional effect for some metals ( o , mg , si , fe ) .",
    "one might also think that an increased he / h ratio with respect to the solar value results in a stronger continuum emission and thus in a smaller line to continuum ratio .",
    "however , this is not the case . to see this , consider two plasmas , one with a solar he / h ratio and one for which part of the h has been used to make he ( mostly @xmath28he ) . because 4 h ions provide more electrons than one he ion , the plasma with the solar he / h ratio will emit more bremsstrahlung continuum .",
    "so we probably need a modification of the standard model .",
    "a possibility is that the electron distribution is not maxwellian .",
    "the continuum emission may partly result from a ( non - thermal ) tail to a relatively cool ( @xmath29  kev ) electron distribution . as a result",
    ", metals should be in a lower ionization stage than implied by the model fits .",
    "such a model does at least qualitatively explain why fluorescent emission indicates different ( i.e. high ) abundances .",
    "we have tried to model such a distribution by calculating the ionization stages of o for a mix of a high ( @xmath30  kev ) and low temperature electron distribution ( @xmath31  kev ) .",
    "this crude model indicates that we can hide an appreciable amount ( 40% ) of metals as long as  is low ( e.g. @xmath32m@xmath3s for a cool to hot ratio of 4 to 1 ) . note that an appreciable amount of cool electrons is not unlikely in the light of recent uv observations of sn 1006 ( laming et al .",
    "1996 ) , which indicated @xmath33 . as an indication : a shock velocity for rcw 86 of 700  km / s ( long & blair 1990 ) without electron  ion equilibration gives @xmath34  kev ; laming et al.s result suggests @xmath35  kev .",
    "clearly the effects of a non - maxwellian electron distribution need further modeling .",
    "it is furthermore unclear why all the spectra of rcw 86 share so many characteristics , whereas they are taken from very different regions .    up to now",
    "we did not address the issue how projection or contamination effects may be responsible for the unusual asca rcw 86 spectra . in our opinion",
    "it is very hard to explain the near absence of line emission solely by projection effects without invoking an unconventional interpretation . in a model that uses projection effects",
    "the observer should see a superposition of a spectrum with a `` normal '' line to continuum ratio and a spectrum with an almost complete absence of lines .",
    "so the difficulty of how to suppress line emission remains unaltered in such a model .",
    "in fact we can not exclude that the asca sis spectra are superpositions of two opposite cases , but we want to point out that it is remarkable that such extremely smooth spectra exist .",
    "[ [ evidence - for - a - cavity - explosion . ] ] evidence for a cavity explosion .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    pisarski et al .",
    "1984 and claas et al .",
    "1989 reported that there is a large density contrast between the north and south . in agreement with their results",
    "we find a ( post shock ) electron density of @xmath36   for the sw soft region and @xmath37  for the ne region ( @xmath38 is the distance in kpc ) .",
    "the range in densities for the sw soft region comes from the uncertainty in the emitting volume , which can be anything within a factor of 10 of @xmath39m@xmath40 .",
    "the estimate for the ne region was based on a filling factor of 0.25 , a coverage by the northeastern sis pointing of 0.2 and a total em of @xmath41m@xmath3kpc@xmath8 .",
    "the optical emission tells an even more interesting story : observations of non - radiative shocks in the north give a pre - shock density of @xmath42   ( long & blair 1990 ) , whereas spectra taken from the southwest indicate densities of more than 10@xmath43  ( leibowitz & danziger 1983 ) .",
    "the density contrast may have an accidental cause , but for a number of reasons we think that rcw86 makes a strong case for being the result of a cavity explosion .",
    "in particular we think that the cavity wall has not been reached by the shock wave all over the remnant . with a cavity we mean here a tenuous region in the ism blown by one or more stellar winds ( weaver et al . , 1977 ) , such a cavity is surrounded by a denser region , the cavity wall , consisting of swept - up material .",
    "the reasons for our hypothesis are : ( 1 ) the low density in the north , given the fact that rcw 86 is situated near the galactic plain ; ( 2 ) the faint emission outside the main shell in fig",
    ".  [ image ] , most notably in the northwest , implying that the wall of the cavity has not been reached in all directions ( see fig .",
    "[ sketch ] ) ; ( 3 ) fig .",
    "3 in claas et al .",
    "( 1989 ) shows that the radial x - ray profile of the northeastern part of the remnant has too much emission coming from the shell of the snr as compared to the sedov model ; ( 4 ) the more or less egg - shape reminds one of a cavity made by a star which was moving from north to south with respect to the interstellar medium ( weaver et al .",
    "1977 , see their fig .",
    "7 ) , or alternatively the cavity may have been blown by several stars ; ( 5 ) the gap in the northern shell recalls the breakouts seen in numerical simulations of cavity snrs by franco et al .",
    "this is even more striking in the picture by smith ( 1997 ) where ahead of the gap there is an enhancement in the emission ; ( 6 ) a recent encounter of the blastwave with the cavity wall makes it more likely that complete electron heating has not yet occured and may also explain why the  values are rather low : most of the matter has only recently been shocked when the blastwave hit the cavity wall .    in order to clarify point 2 we made a sketch of the structure of rcw 86 as we envision it ( fig .",
    "[ sketch ] ) .",
    "note that the figure gives a side view and that we do not know the inclination , so it might also be the southwestern region that is closer to us .",
    "it is clear from our sketch that we do not know the exact shape of the cavity , because we only see those parts of the cavity wall that are lit up by the blastwave .",
    "however , it is also clear that if the cavity has an egg - like shape , the remnant will also have an egg - like shape , but possibly less elongated .",
    "[ sketch ] also clarifies the relativily low emission from the center of rcw 86 ( point 3 ) : along the line of sight the cavity wall has not yet been reached by the blastwave .",
    "we have presented an analysis of asca spectra of rcw86 , which we modeled by nei models . in general",
    "these models fit the data rather well , but indicate an underabundance of metals . on the other hand , we need over - abundances to explain the fluorescent emission of ar and fe in some parts of the remnant .",
    "the fitted models indicate a very low  value .",
    "we suggest that the peculiarities of the spectra may be the result of a non - maxwellian electron distribution",
    ". if the bulk of the electrons has a very low temperature , most of the ions should be in a low ionization stage ( e.g. the li - like stage ) , whereas a supra - thermal tail may dominate the x - ray continuum and explain the ar - k and fe - k fluorescent emission .",
    "note that our density calculations underestimate the true densities if the electron distribution is non - thermal .",
    "other snrs may exhibit similar effects , although perhaps to a lesser extent . in that respect",
    "it is interesting that miyata et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and miyata ( 1996 ) report similar underabundances for the cygnus loop .",
    "we suggest that rcw86 is the result of a cavity explosion .",
    "the morphology of the remnant is a good indication for that and even suggests that the cavity may have been blown by more than one star .",
    "this is interesting in view of the new distance estimate by rosado et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , placing rcw86 at the distance of an ob association at 2.5  kpc ( westerlund 1969 ) .",
