    "the experimental development of magnetic superlattices , by using molecular beam epitaxy technique [ 1 - 3 ] , has increased the interest in the study of these systems .",
    "although they are three - dimensional systems , there is a predominance of the one - dimensional behaviour in their properties , and this is the main reason for studying one - dimensional superlattices .",
    "therefore , interest has been considerably increased in the study of spin systems on these lattices .    among the spin systems the xy - model ( @xmath6=1/2 ) , introduced by lieb et al . [ 4 ] , occupies a special place , since it can be solved exactly for the homogenous lattice .",
    "although almost all static and dynamical properties are known for the model on the homogeneous lattice ( see [ 5 ] and references therein ) , the known results for non - homogeneous periodic one - dimensional systems are restricted to the alternating chain [ 6 - 8 ] and to the excitation spectrum of the general alternating superlattice [ 9 ] , and its critical behaviour , which has been obtained by using the position space renormalization group approach [ 10 ] .",
    "in this paper we consider the isotropic xy - model in a transverse field on the one - dimensional alternating superlattice ( closed chain ) .",
    "we solve the model by introducing a generalized jordan - wigner transformation [ 9 ] and by using the green function equation of motion tecnhique .",
    "in section 2 we determine the relevant green functions and present a detailed discusssion of the excitation spectrum . in section 3",
    "we obtain the internal energy and the specific heat .",
    "the induced magnetization is studied in section 4 , and in section 5 we calculate the two - spin correlation function . finally ,",
    "in section 6 , we summarize the results and present the main conclusions .",

    "the agreement is more remarkable in the very low temperature limit , since in this limit the structure is analogous to a superlattice .",
    "although this material is described by a heisenberg type hamiltonian , this result suggests that the lattice structure is a predominant factor in defining the magnetic properties of the material .",
