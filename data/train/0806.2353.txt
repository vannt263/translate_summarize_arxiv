    "interest in the relativistic harmonic oscillator has either focused on its mathematical and physical characteristics @xcite or on analytic approaches of solving its non - linear equation of motion , given non - dimensionally as @xmath4 the latter is motivated by the general significance of the study of strongly non - linear oscillators , particularly in developing efficient approximation methods to treat them @xcite .",
    "recently , the non - perturbative methods of harmonic balance @xcite and homotopy @xcite have been succesfully applied to give analytic approximations of the oscillation period and periodic solution of eq.[harmonic ] . unlike traditional perturbation theory",
    ", these asymptotic techniques do not rely on any linear term or physically small parameter .",
    "hence their results are unrestricted by a radius of convergence .",
    "for both methods , the approximations had minimal error over the entire domain of the particle s maximum velocity , @xmath5 . , where eq.[harmonic ] reduces to the linear oscillator .",
    "while in the limit @xmath6 , the oscillator is energetic enough to reach relativistic speeds , which describes a highly non - linear system .",
    "] however , the applicability of these approaches has thus far been restricted to the linear potential .    in this work",
    "we contribute a novel method for computing analytic approximations of the period of strongly anharmonic oscillations described by @xmath7 for an even polynomial potential @xmath8 of general form .",
    "we adopt a non - perturbative approach that has been developed and applied by amore et al . in computing periods of non - linear oscillators @xcite and formally equivalent systems such as the deflection angle in gravitational lensing @xcite .",
    "the method operates by converting the relevant integral into a series carrying a variational parameter @xmath9 , which can be chosen using the principle of minimal sensitivity ( pms ) @xcite . in our case the standard procedure for choosing @xmath9 is modified by treating the existing harmonics as free parameters . these are then assigned values by imposing the ultrarelativistic limit of the period as a boundary condition",
    ". although the necessary computations are simple , the resulting approximations are compact and accurate over the whole solution domain .",
    "as applied to the relativistic harmonic oscillator @xcite , the qualitative analysis of ordinary differential equations detailed in ref.@xcite can be used to show that the solution to eq.[coordtime ] is indeed periodic .",
    "that is , the phase space trajectories given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 , are closed and have the strip structure : @xmath12    the period of this system can be derived from the generalized energy - momentum relation @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the total energy and @xmath15 is the relativistic momentum . in all our equations",
    "the rest mass and speed of light are set to unity .    by noting that the total energy is the sum of the potential energy at the amplitude @xmath16 and the rest mass , i.e. @xmath17 , it can be shown from eq.[energymom ] that @xmath18 which leads to the following expression for the period : @xmath19[\\pa-\\px+2]}}. \\label{coordperiod}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "since the period is a function of the oscillation amplitude , it would be useful to express the physical regimes described by @xmath20 in terms of this parameter . setting @xmath21 in eq.[rel1 ] gives @xmath22}}{1+\\pa}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this relation maps the domain @xmath5 unto @xmath23 .    for an even potential @xmath8 , the period from eq.[coordperiod ] can be written as @xmath24}}. \\label{coordperiod2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we approximate @xmath25 with the solvable harmonic potential @xmath26 , in a manner that is essentially a linear delta expansion @xcite : @xmath27[\\w^2+\\delta(\\rx-\\w^2)]}}. \\label{lde}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above equation , when @xmath28 we have the case of simple harmonic motion , while for @xmath29 the system reduces to the original potential of eq.[coordperiod2 ] .    with a change of variable @xmath30 ,",
    "the above equation becomes @xmath31 where the substitution @xmath32 has been made .",
    "a binomial expansion of the integrand in powers of @xmath33 then gives    @xmath34    where we have set @xmath29 .",
    "evaluating the above series to a finite order will leave an explicit @xmath9-dependence that should be eliminated .",
    "indeed this is the basis of the pms , requiring that @xmath35 .",
    "as shown in ref.@xcite , the condition is equivalent to choosing @xmath9 such that @xmath36 for an nth order optimization . to first order ,",
    "the above criterion is equivalently @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes the mean value of @xmath39 .    for classical oscillators eq.[pms2 ]",
    "is implemented easily , yielding remarkable results @xcite . in the case of relativistic oscillators",
    "however , the expressions not only become cumbersome but are divergent at large oscillation amplitudes even with higher order computations .",
    "for example , we find that the resulting @xmath9 computed for the relativistic quartic oscillator approaches unity as @xmath40 .",
    "this marks an ineffective variation since the choice @xmath41 gives the exact untreated series .",
    "hence for any order of calculation , the error of approximation increases rapidly beyond @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) .    the alternative criterion given by eq.36 of ref.@xcite is also found to be problematic because the resulting @xmath9 goes to infinity as @xmath40 .",
    "since all terms in eq.[series ] are proportional to powers of @xmath44 , then any finite order approximation incorrectly goes to zero in the ultrarelativistic limit @xmath40 .",
    "the correct large amplitude behavior can be verified by noting from eq.[rel1 ] that @xmath45 in this regime .",
    "hence , eq.[coordperiod ] simplifies to what is expected for a photon bouncing in a box of width @xmath46 : @xmath47 the preceding limit will serve as the asymptotic boundary condition that determines our variational parameter .",
    "we begin constructing our solution by noting that the zeroth order truncation of the series in eq.[series ] is @xmath48 we then assume the form of @xmath9 that directly satisfies eq.[pms ] , namely @xmath49 in the above equation @xmath9 is still dependent on the variable of integration @xmath50 since harmonics of the form @xmath51 are present . to remove this , we treat the harmonics as free parameters , denoting @xmath51 as @xmath52 .",
    "next , we look at the limit of @xmath9 as @xmath40 . it can be shown that for an even potential with leading order @xmath53 , the large amplitude behavior is @xmath54 substituting eqs.[uperiod ] and [ wlarge1 ] in the limit @xmath40 of eq.[approx ] will yield a relation between all orders of free parameters that exist in @xmath55 .",
    "this relation can be used recursively to provide @xmath3 equations .",
    "however for a non - linear potential , the system of equations is under - determined since there are a total of @xmath56 free parameters .",
    "we remedy this problem by factoring out @xmath57 from the numerator and denominator in eq.[wlarge1 ] , giving us @xmath58 thus the large amplitude limit of eq.[approx ] yields the relation @xmath59 under the ansatz of setting the lowest order free parameter to be its trigonometric average , i.e. @xmath60 , the @xmath61 case of the above equation determines @xmath62 .",
    "these values are then used in the @xmath63 equation to solve for @xmath64 and so on , effectively building the whole set of @xmath3 free parameters from the bottom up .",
    "this iterative computation yields that for integers @xmath65 the free parameters are given by @xmath66 we use these values in @xmath55 and determine @xmath9 by eq.[pms3 ] . then by eq.[approx ] the resulting approximation is @xmath67",
    "as a first example we apply the method to the linear potential . plugging in @xmath68 in eq.[coordperiod ] and following the general derivation previously outlined yields @xmath69 in calculating the free parameters present in @xmath55 we utilize the relation given by eq.[wlarge1 ] since for @xmath70 the system is not under - determined .",
    "accordingly , the ultrarelativistic limit of eq.[approx ] gives the relation @xmath71 by using @xmath60 in the above equation , we determine @xmath72 .",
    "we then substitute these values into eq.[harmr ] and use eq.[approx2 ] , giving us the compact expression for the period @xmath73    we compare this with the exact period given by @xmath74 - 8 \\text{k}\\left[\\frac{a^2}{4+a^2}\\right]}{\\sqrt{4+a^2 } } , \\label{exact}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath75 $ ] and @xmath76 $ ] are the elliptic integrals of the first and second kind , respectively .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the relative error of eq.[harmperiod ] along with those of the results of harmonic balance @xcite and homotopy @xcite . despite the simplicity of our calculation , the third order approximations of both these methods are only more accurate by @xmath77 over a finite range of @xmath16 .",
    "our solution is the only approximation whose error goes to zero at the ultrarelativistic limit .",
    "an advantage is also apparent in the resulting expression itself , that it is compact and mathematically elementary , while those of harmonic balance and homotopy are lengthy and even require the evaluation of elliptic integrals .",
    "the most note - worthy point of our method is its extensive applicability . for our second example",
    "we calculate a general approximation for the periods of relativistic oscillators with the potential @xmath78 .",
    "as we have done previously , we obtain the function @xmath55 by following the derivation starting from eq.[coordperiod ] .",
    "the result is @xmath79 where @xmath80 note that this expression has been factored in a manner compatible with eq.[wlarge2 ] so that the existing free parameters are defined by eq.[free ] .",

    "for such large values of @xmath3 the period exhibits a sharp jump from what is characteristically harmonic at amplitudes @xmath86 to the ultrarelativistic limit for @xmath87 .    as a third example",
    ", we derive a general approximation for the periods of relativistic oscillators with the potential @xmath88 .",
