    "convenience of wireless mobile communication has revolutionized the way we access information services and interact with the physical world . beyond enabling mobile devices to access information and data services ubiquitously ,",
    "wireless technology is widely used in cyber - physical systems such as air - traffic control , power plants synchronization , transportation systems , navigation systems and human body implantable devices .",
    "this pervasiveness has elevated wireless communication systems to the level of critical infrastructure .",
    "nevertheless , security issues of wireless communications remain a serious concern .",
    "physical layer in wireless networks is a broadcast medium that is subjected to adversaries . among the many security threats that the wireless networks are subject to , jamming at the physical layer",
    "is one of the most prominent and challenging threats .",
    "physical layer jamming not only can lead to service interruption / degradation or denial of service , but it is often a prelude to other upper layer attacks such as spoofing , man in the middle and downgrade attacks  @xcite .    furthermore , many modern wireless networks such as sensor , ad - hoc and mesh networks often operate in a decentralized , self - configurable fashion .",
    "network nodes are governed by a distributed protocol which allows the nodes to choose an action , i.e. , make a _ decision _ , from a set of available actions based on their evaluation of the network conditions ( possibly relying on the information provided by the other nodes ) .",
    "these decisions not only have impact on the performance of individual nodes but may have impact on the overall performance of the entire network .",
    "nodes may seek the _",
    "greater good _ of the network that is , they seek actions that optimize the overall performance of the entire network , or they can act _ selfishly _ and compete with other nodes to optimize their individual performance . additionally , nodes may act _ maliciously _ , i.e , seek actions that result in performance degradation of the individual nodes or the entire network .",
    "all these examples have many of the characteristics that would lead to a natural game theoretic formulation as these problems can not be completely modeled by the traditional optimization tools . moreover , as software defined radios ( sdrs ) and cognitive radios ( crs ) become more capable of implementing more sophisticated and complicated adaptation algorithms , the assumptions of game theoretic models become an even better match for future wireless networks .",
    "game theory has been used to solve problems in numerous aspects of wired and wireless communication systems  from security at the physical and mac layer ( e.g. , jamming and eavesdropping ) to routing and intrusion detection systems ( e.g. , collaborative ids s ) at upper layers of the protocol stack . @xcite and the references therein provide a structured and comprehensive overview of the game - theoretic approach to security and privacy in computer and communications networks . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors use a layered approach to survey applications of game theory in wireless networking and game models that are most suitable for each problem .",
    "reference @xcite presents a classification of applications of game theory in network security based on the game model that is used to approach the problem .",
    "the survey covers both cooperative and non - cooperative games ( see table i in @xcite ) . in what follows ,",
    "we briefly review some of the applications of game theory in wireless communications .",
    "we limit our focus to the physical layer applications , for applications of game theory in other network layers we refer the reader to  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "addresses the issue of how to allocate the limited available spectrum among multiple wireless devices .",
    "this problem has two important aspects , spectrum usage efficiency and fairness to wireless users and can be modeled as a cooperative or non - cooperative game .",
    "cooperative models such as _ bargaining games _ and _ coalition games _ are often used where cooperation between spectrum users can result in an equilibrium that is more efficient and fair  @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "when collaboration between network nodes is not possible or permitted for instance , when secondary users compete for channel or spectrum access in cognitive radio networks , non - cooperative frameworks ( e.g. _ auction - based games _ ) are used to model this problem  @xcite . in cognitive radio networks",
    ", the wireless spectrum is shared between primary users ( users that are licensed to operate in that spectrum band ) and secondary users ( unlicensed users ) where the secondary users access the spectrum in an _",
    "opportunistic manner_. in this scenario , the secondary users compete with each other to access the bandwidth offered by the primary users and therefore ; spectrum sharing in better modeled under the non - cooperative framework @xcite .",
    "is another example that has been studied by game theoretic approaches  @xcite . in cdma power control problem ,",
    "a player s utility function is usually defined such that it increases with the signal to interference plus noise ratio ( sinr ) but decreases with transmission power  @xcite .",
    "this assumption is well justified since an increase in the sinr results in lower error probability and hence would increase the quality of service . assuming all network nodes operate at fixed transmission power , an increase in a node s transmission power , results in higher sinr for that node . however , increasing transmission power results in lower sinr for other users . because most wireless nodes are battery - operated",
    ", energy management is an important consideration and if a node s power is too high , not only it reduces other nodes sinr but it also wastes valuable battery life .      game theory has also been used to study power control in orthogonal frequency devision multiple access ( ofdma ) networks . in ofdma networks ,",
    "the objective is to minimize the overall transmission power under rate and power constraints by allocating users rates and powers to the available sub - channels .",
    "this problem has been studied in the literature in non - cooperative @xcite and cooperative frameworks @xcite . in non - cooperative framework network nodes",
    "use local and selfish power control strategies to maximize their individual performances while in the cooperative framework , network nodes use distributed and ( possibly ) selfless power control strategies to optimize the overall performance and fairness of the system .",
    "it has been shown that game theoretic power control strategies can achieve significant individual and/or overall performance improvements over traditional power control algorithms  @xcite .      among the many security threats that the wireless networks are subject to , jamming at the physical layer",
    "is one of the most prominent and challenging threats .",
    "jamming at the physical layer is often modeled as a zero - sum game , a special class of non - cooperative games  @xcite .",
    "in a zero - sum game , for all strategy profiles the sum of players payoffs is zero and as a result , if a player gains a payoff , that payoff must have been lost by other player(s ) .",
    "jamming in wireless communication is one such case as the players , the communicating nodes and the jammer , have completely conflicting goals .    in zero - sum game framework",
    ", it is usually assumed that the players have _ perfect knowledge _ of the game and the actions that are available to the other players , and they use this knowledge to compute their respective optimal strategies .",
    "in such a case , the zero - sum framework fully captures the conflicting goals of the players .",
    "moreover , the equilibrium solution of the zero - sum game guarantees a minimum payoff regardless of the other player s strategy  @xcite .",
    "however , in some jamming scenarios , having perfect knowledge of the system parameters ( or available actions ) may not be a feasible option or too costly for a player .",
    "in addition , players may have objectives that are not exactly the opposite of each other , for example , the transmitter may wish to minimize the average error probability while the jammer wishes to minimize the average throughput of the system ( as opposed to maximizing the average error probability ) .",
    "in such scenarios , a more appropriate framework to model the communication system under jamming would be a _",
    "bimatrix _ game instead of a zero - sum game . in bimatrix games",
    "it is no longer required that the sum of the players payoffs to be zero ( or a constant value )  @xcite . as a result",
    ", players can have different objectives and the respective payoffs can be defined based on the players goals and their knowledge of the game ( which in general may be imperfect ) .",
    "such a formulation , encompasses a variety of situations from full competition to full cooperation .",
    "additionally , in standard zero - sum and bimatrix games there are no additional restrictions on players mixed - strategies , i.e. , players may choose any probability distribution over their respective action sets ( pure - strategies ) .",
    "however , there exist scenarios where , due to practical reasons , not all mixed - strategies are permitted and/or feasible .",
    "such scenarios demand for a more general framework to study them . in this paper , we study a _ constrained bimatrix _ game to overcome these limitations . in constrained games , the players mixed - strategies not only have to be a probability distributions but they must satisfy some additional constraints too ( figure  [ fig_bimatrix_and_zerosum_relation ] shows the classification of standard and constrained games ) .",
    "we study the necessary and sufficient conditions under which the existence of the nash equilibrium is guaranteed as well as a systematic approach to find the ne .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows , in section  [ sec_2_constrained_bimatrix_games ] we will introduce the _ constrained bimatrix _ framework and provide the necessary and sufficient conditions under which the existence of a constrained ne solution is guaranteed .",
    "in section  [ sec_3_quadratic_programming ] we show that the solution of the this constrained game corresponds to the global maximizers of a _",
    "quadratic program_. in section  [ sec_4_case_study ] we will use the framework that we developed to study a typical jamming problem . finally , we conclude the paper in section  [ sec_5_conclusion ] .",
    "we start by introducing the concept of the nash equilibrium ( ne ) for standard bimatrix games .",
    "then , we generalize the standard bimatrix framework by adding linear constraints on the players strategies and formulate the _ constraint bimatrix _ framework .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite and the references therein for an introduction to some of the most fundamental concepts of non - cooperative game theory .",
    "this tutorial is specifically written for wireless network engineers and uses intuitive examples that are focused on wireless networks .",
    "@xcite provides a more comprehensive review of non - cooperative game theory and its applications in wireless communications and networking . throughout the rest of the paper",
    ", we refer to player one ( row player ) as the _ transmitter _ and refer to player two ( column player ) as the _",
    "jammer_. nevertheless , applications of our framework is not limited to jamming in wireless communications .",
    "consider a bimatrix game where transmitter s action set ( for instance , transmission rates ) is given by @xmath0 without loss of generality assume @xmath1 is a sorted set , i.e. , @xmath2 .",
    "transmitter s vector of possible actions ( simply , _",
    "action vector _ ) is the column vector @xmath3 defined as @xmath4_{1\\times m}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 indicates matrix transposition .",
    "similarly , we define the jammer s action set and action vector as @xmath6 and @xmath7_{1\\times n}\\ ] ] where wlog we assume , @xmath8 .",
    "a _ standard bimatrix game _",
    "( also known as two - player general sum game ) is defined by a pair of @xmath9 matrices @xmath10 and @xmath11 such that , if player one plays row @xmath12 and player two plays column @xmath13 , the elements at row @xmath12 and column @xmath13 of the matrices @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( i.e. , @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) would be the payoffs received by players one and two , respectively .",
    "if we let the players randomize their actions ( i.e. , allow them to use mixed - strategies ) , the expected payoffs of the game for the mixed strategy profile @xmath16 are @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are mixed - strategy vectors of players one and two , respectively .",
    "player one s goal is to find an optimal strategy , @xmath20 , that maximize his expected payoff ( given by payoff matrix @xmath10 ) against player two s strategy , @xmath21 , i.e. , player one wants to solve the following problem @xmath22 while player two s goal is to maximize his own payoff ( given by payoff matrix @xmath11 ) by solving the following problem @xmath23 the strategy profile @xmath24 is said to be an equilibrium pair ( or equivalently the nash equilibrium , ne ) if @xmath25 satisfies and simultaneously .",
    "that is , @xmath26 maximizes   for @xmath27 and @xmath27 maximizes   for @xmath26 , and therefore , no player benefits by unilaterally changing his strategy .    [ theorem_1 ] every finite bimatrix game in its standard form has at least one equilibrium pair ( nash equilibrium ) in mixed - strategies",
    ".    see theorem 1 in @xcite .",
    "[ cols= \" < , > , < , > \" , ]     consider a bimatrix game for which , due to practical reasons , not all mixed - strategies are permitted and/or are feasible .",
    "for instance , assume maximizing the average throughput of a wireless link .",
    "maximizing the average throughput requires using higher transmission rates ; but to maintain an acceptable error rate at the receiver , higher rates must be transmitted at higher transmission power . because of battery limitation ( internal limitation ) or the fcc regulations ( external limitations ) , the transmitter must keep its average transmission power below a certain value .",
    "consequently , the wireless user can not use certain actions that are more preferable to him ( such as transmitting at the highest rate all the time ) .",
    "he may only choose actions that result in an average transmission power less than or equal to a predetermined value .",
    "assume the mixed - strategy pair @xmath20 and @xmath21 must be chosen from some hyperpolyhedron defined by linear inequalities , @xmath28 and @xmath29 we denote this constraint game by @xmath30 @xmath31 where @xmath32 are the payoff matrices for player one and two , respectively , and weight vectors @xmath3 and @xmath33 are given by and , respectively and @xmath11 completely define the game . ] .",
    "it is easily verified that for @xmath34 and @xmath35 the constrained game simplifies to the bimatrix game in its standard form ; hence , the unconstrained game can be viewed as a special case of the constrained games ( see figure  [ fig_bimatrix_and_zerosum_relation ] ) .",
    "therefore , in the following we assume that at least one of the following inequalities holds @xmath36    by introducing and , and assuming that holds , we are eliminating some mixed - strategies that could have been otherwise selected .",
