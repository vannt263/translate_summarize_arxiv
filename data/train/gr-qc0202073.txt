    "in quantum gravity , as treated by the combined approaches of the dirac canonical quantization and its dual , the feynman path integral @xcite , one studies ( for example ) the amplitude for @xmath7 disconnected compact three - surfaces to have given spatial three - metrics , respectively @xmath8 the amplitude is given formally by a path integral .",
    "in the simplest case @xmath9 , with only one connected three - surface , which could then be regarded as a spatial cross - section of a cosmological model , the amplitude is given by the ` no - boundary ' or ` hartle - hawking ' state @xcite @xmath10 ) , \\label{1}\\ ] ] where the integral is over riemannian four - geometries @xmath11 on compact manifolds - with - boundary , where the three - metric induced on the boundary agrees with the prescribed @xmath12 above . here",
    "@xmath13 denotes the euclidean action @xcite of the four - dimensional configuration , as in eq.([29 ] ) below .",
    "naturally , in considering semi - classical approximations to this integral , one is led first to study the classical riemannian boundary - value problem : namely , to find one ( or more ) riemannian solutions to the classical einstein field equations , possibly including a cosmological constant @xmath14 obeying @xmath15 which are smooth on the interior manifold , and which agree with the spatial three - metric @xmath12 at the boundary .",
    "below , we shall see examples in which ( different ) such classical solutions exist , for a class of choices of the three - metric @xmath12 on a boundary diffeomorphic to the three - sphere @xmath0 , on a manifold - with - boundary with the simplest possibility of a four - ball topology .    here",
    ", the boundary - value problem is studied within the class of biaxial bianchi - ix models @xcite , which may be written locally in the form @xmath16 here @xmath17 denote the left - invariant one - forms on @xmath0 ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the boundary 3-metric at a given value @xmath18 of @xmath19 is then a berger three - sphere @xcite , with intrinsic three - metric @xmath20 subject to condition ( [ 2 ] ) , the metrics ( [ 3 ] ) are known in a closed form ",
    "they are the well - known family of riemannian taub - nut-(anti)de sitter metrics @xcite . for the topologically simplest case that we are studying in this paper ,",
    "we insist that the @xmath0 with the given intrinsic metric ( [ 4 ] ) bound a four - ball with smooth four - metric ; this corresponds to requiring the taub - nut-(anti)de sitter metrics to close with a regular `` nut '' and to have half - flat weyl curvature .",
    "we find that the problem can be translated into an algebraic system of degree three which can be solved exactly to find the possible infilling geometries of this type and their actions for _ any _ boundary data @xmath21 .",
    "depending on @xmath22 one may therefore have three real roots , or one real root together with one complex conjugate pair , for this third - degree equation .",
    "a similar study was carried out in @xcite , for large three - volume and small anisotropy , assuming a positive cosmological constant .",
    "however , we have been able to find all complex- and real - valued self - dual taub - nut-(anti)de sitter solutions on the 4-ball and their actions for arbitrary values of @xmath23 for both positive and negative cosmological constants",
    ". the case of zero cosmological constant can be obtained by taking the cosmological constant to zero ( equivalently ) from either the positive or the negative direction .",
    "self - dual riemannian einstein spaces with a negative cosmological constant and of biaxial bianchi - ix type have also been studied , for example , by pedersen @xcite , in connection with the conformal boundary - value problem with a three - sphere ( topologically ) at infinity .",
    "the more general case of generic ( non - biaxial ) bianchi - ix models has been treated in this context by hitchin @xcite and by tod @xcite .    since",
    "a strictly negative cosmological constant @xmath24 is needed to have any hope of incorporating gauge theories of matter with local supersymmetry in a four - dimensional field theory @xcite , we have given a more detailed analysis for @xmath25 ; the real and complex solutions have been classified completely in terms of the boundary values @xmath21 , and the numerical behaviour of the solutions and euclidean action @xmath13 has been investigated in greater detail .",
    "the general form of a biaxial bianchi - ix four - metric is given by eq.([3 ] ) .",
    "such metrics are invariant under the group action of @xmath26 , whose lie algebra is isomorphic to that of @xmath27 .",
    "when one further imposes the einstein equations with a @xmath28 term , one arrives at the two - parameter taub - nut-(anti)de sitter family @xcite : @xmath29 where @xmath30 here @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the two parameters and @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 ( @xmath36 is a natural number ) .",
    "when @xmath37 , the surfaces of constant @xmath38 are topologically @xmath0 . the general form ( [ 5 ] ) , however , is only valid for a coordinate patch for which @xmath39 . in general @xmath40 will have four roots . at the roots the metric degenerates to that of a round @xmath41 , and each such root therefore corresponds to a two - dimensional set of fixed points of the killing vector field @xmath42 . however , if a root occurs at @xmath43 , the fixed - point set is zero - dimensional ( as the two - sphere then collapses to a point ) .",
    "such two- and zero - dimensional fixed point sets have been given the names `` bolts '' and `` nuts '' respectively @xcite .",
    "the coordinate @xmath38 ranges continuously from a root of @xmath40 until it encounters another root of @xmath40 , if there is any ; otherwise @xmath38 ranges from the root to infinity . in general , the bolts of the above taub - nut family of metrics are not regular points of the metric . for them to be regular",
    ", the metric has to close smoothly at the bolts , for which the condition is @xcite : @xmath44 for finite @xmath45 and @xmath37 , condition ( [ 7 ] ) leads to the self - dual taub - nut-(anti)de sitter metric ( see below ) and the taub - bolt-(anti)de sitter metric @xcite , which reduce to the euclidean taub - nut @xcite and the taub - bolt metrics @xcite respectively for @xmath46 . for the limiting cases @xmath47 and @xmath48 , for which ( [ 5 ] ) is not well - defined , one can obtain regular solutions by suitable coordinate transformations and assigning correct periodicities to the coordinate parametrizing the @xmath49 fibre .",
    "for example , for @xmath46 , the eguchi - hanson metric @xcite and the schwarzschild metric can be obtained from ( [ 5 ] ) in these limits @xcite . in the next section",
    "we will encounter more examples of bianchi - ix metrics that arise at these limits as we discuss the self - dual taub - nut-(anti)de sitter solutions .",
    "for a recent discussion on obtaining different biaxial bianchi - ix metrics as various limits of ( [ 5 ] ) see @xcite .",
    "it will become evident below that the regular , positive - definite geometries of this type on a four - ball interior are weyl half - flat , that is , having either self - dual or anti - self - dual weyl curvature @xcite which requires : @xmath50 for either sign , such metrics are often called ( by physicists ) half - flat  a name which we will be using in this paper .",
    "it is easy to check that , when the metric has a nut  or equivalently @xmath40 has a ( double ) root at @xmath51 ( or @xmath52 )  then the two parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 are related by @xmath53 which is precisely the condition above for self - duality of the weyl tensor .",
    "one can further check that eq.([7 ] ) is automatically satisfied at the nut of the metric ( [ 5 ] ) .",
    "therefore , within the taub - nut-(anti)de sitter family , self - duality of the weyl tensor will imply regularity at the origin . without loss of generality",
    ", we will work with the positive sign of eq.([8 ] ) ( and ( [ 9 ] ) ) .",
    "the condition ( [ 8 ] ) of half - flatness ( or condition ( [ 9 ] ) of nut - regularity ) implies that @xmath40 simplifies : @xmath54 one can note that the terms involving @xmath28 vanish as @xmath55 , and that the metric near the origin is that of the @xmath46 case , namely hawking s ( taub - nut ) solution @xcite : @xmath56 apart from the double root at @xmath57 , @xmath40 has two more roots or `` bolts '' at @xmath58 .",
    "beyond these two roots @xmath40 is negative .",
    "so , the permissible range of @xmath38 is from @xmath31 to @xmath59 ( when @xmath31 is positive ) or from @xmath31 to @xmath60 ( when @xmath31 is negative ) . for a complete nonsingular metric",
    ", we have to check whether such points are regular , i.e. , whether @xmath61 which is identically satisfied at the nut ( at @xmath57 ) as we have seen already .",
    "however , for @xmath62 , which is positive definite and greater than @xmath31 , this would require : @xmath63 which can only happen for @xmath31 negative ( @xmath64 ) and hence we find a contradiction .",
    "( in other words , this would give a regular bolt at @xmath65  on the `` other side '' of @xmath57 which is negative , and hence can not be reached continuously starting from @xmath31 . ) the same argument applies for the other root at @xmath66 .",
    "therefore , for positive cosmological constant , the half - flat ( equivalently , regular - nut ) solution , has a singular bolt at finite @xmath38 which exists and can not be made regular for any finite value of the parameter @xmath45 .",
    "however , in the limit @xmath67 , one can obtain the standard round metric on @xmath68 by suitable coordinate transformations ; this is regular everywhere and has a regular nut at each of the two poles . for the @xmath69 limit , on the other hand",
    ", one can obtain the regular fubini - study metric on @xmath70 .",
    "this is regular everywhere and has a regular nut at the origin and a regular bolt at infinity @xcite .",
    "the case with a negative cosmological constant is different . writing @xmath71 ( @xmath72 is positive ) , one has @xmath73 @xmath40 now has two roots at at @xmath57 and two others at @xmath74 , which are beyond the permissible range of @xmath75 ( @xmath31 positive ) and @xmath76 ( @xmath31 negative ) .",
    "so , for a fixed negative @xmath28 , the one - parameter family of half - flat solutions of the taub - nut - anti de sitter type are necessarily regular for @xmath77 for any finite , non - zero value of @xmath31 . using similar",
    "coordinate transformations as in the case of positive cosmological constant , one can obtain the canonical metric on @xmath78 and the bergman metric on @xmath79 in the limits of @xmath67 and @xmath80 respectively , both of which are nut - regular at the origin .",
    "so , for both @xmath81 and @xmath82 , in this half - flat taub - nut-(anti ) de sitter family any hypersurface of constant @xmath38 ( which is a berger sphere with a given 3-metric ) bounds a four - ball with a regular 4-metric .",
    "the singular bolt at @xmath83 , in the case of @xmath84 , poses no problem as the berger sphere lies between the ( regular ) nut and the ( singular ) bolt when we are interested in filling the berger sphere with positive - definite regular metrics .",
    "it remains to see which classical 4-metrics of taub - nut-(anti)de sitter type can be given on the four - ball inside a given berger sphere .",
    "in other words , how many members in this one - parameter ( @xmath31 ) family of metrics are there for which a given berger sphere is a possible hypersurface at some constant @xmath38 ?    in addressing this question we can include complex solutions in the interior of the 3-sphere .",
    "for this we let @xmath38 and @xmath31 and hence the 4-metric be in general complex - valued as long as the 4-metric induces the prescribed positive - definite 3-metric on the boundary and is non - singular in the interior .",
    "we will return to this issue in the next section .",
    "real positive - definite infilling 4-metrics therefore form a subclass of the complex - valued solutions to this boundary - value problem and do not necessarily exist for arbitrary boundary data .",
    "however , it is possible to find the necessary and sufficient condition on the boundary data for the existence of real positive - definite solutions as we will see in sections 4 and 5 .",
    "following the discussion above , the problem of finding classical infilling regular/(anti)self - dual einstein metrics of taub - nut-(anti)de sitter type on the four - ball bounded by a typical berger sphere with two radii @xmath23 can be translated into solving the following two equations in @xmath38 and @xmath31 : @xmath85 and @xmath86 these are polynomial equations of degree two and six in the variables @xmath38 and @xmath31 and hence , by bzout s theorem ( see , for example , @xcite ) , would intersect at at most twelve points in @xmath87 . however , trying to solve eq.([15])-([16 ] ) explicitly for @xmath38 and @xmath31 is not very easy and not to be recommended . however , there is a more `` symmetric '' approach , which will enable us to find explicit solutions , and first of all enables us to count the number of infilling geometries .",
    "* theorem : * _ for any boundary data @xmath23 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the radii of two equal and one unequal axes of a berger 3-sphere ( squashed 3-sphere with two axes equal ) respectively , there are precisely three ( modulo `` orientation '' ) self - dual taub - nut-(anti)de sitter geometries which contain the 3-sphere as their boundary . for which ( [ 5 ] ) is well - defined , self - dual metrics of biaxial bianchi - ix type ( admitting @xmath88-foliations ) arising as limiting cases ( @xmath67 and @xmath47 ) of the self - dual taub - nut-(anti)de sitter  as discussed in section @xmath89  are precluded from the considerations here . depending on two radii of the berger sphere , possible infilling solutions of such metrics",
    "can easily be included when one considers the larger class of ( self - dual ) bianchi - ix type metrics on the four - ball . ]",
    "_ + * proof : * note that the system of equations ( [ 15])-([16 ] ) admits the discrete symmetry @xmath90 .",
    "( this is what we mean by `` orientation '' ) .",
    "make the substitution : @xmath91 the problem now reduces to solving @xmath92 and @xmath93 note that this preserves the discrete symmetry , @xmath90 in @xmath94 .",
    "substitution of @xmath95 in eq.([19 ] ) now gives the univariate equation : @xmath96 which is a cubic equation in @xmath97 .",
    "the six solutions for @xmath98 therefore will appear in pairs of opposite signs .",
    "since @xmath99 is positive , this implies that the six corresponding solutions of @xmath100 are of the form @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 .",
    "since the set of solutions have the symmetry @xmath107 , by applying the transformation @xmath108 , we would obtain no new solutions for @xmath100 ( hence for @xmath109 ) and would reproduce the same set .",
    "therefore there are six points in @xmath87 where the two polynomials meet , i.e. , six solutions for @xmath110 which are related by the reflection symmetry @xmath90 .",
    "hence the number of geometries modulo orientation for any given boundary data @xmath111 is three .",
    "@xmath112      it is more convenient to rewrite eq.([20 ] ) for @xmath113 in the form @xmath114 where we have denoted @xmath115 by @xmath116 .",
    "it is easy to see that the real solutions for @xmath100 ( and hence for @xmath109 ) come from the _ positive _ roots of eq.([21 ] ) .",
    "depending on the boundary data @xmath116 , the number of positive solutions for @xmath117 can range from zero to three .",
    "however , a positive solution of @xmath117 and , hence a real solution @xmath118 , would not necessarily correspond to a _ real positive - definite infilling geometry_. for it to qualify as a regular real solution in the interior , the metric should be well - defined for @xmath38 taking values on the real line from @xmath119 to @xmath120 . as we discussed in section @xmath121 , this can happen if and only if @xmath120 and @xmath119 have the same sign and @xmath122 .",
    "the latter condition is automatically satisfied as a consequence of @xmath123 being positive irrespective of whether the signs of @xmath120 and @xmath119 are similar or not .",
    "if @xmath120 and @xmath119 have opposite signs , the metric will not be positive definite for values of @xmath38 within the interval @xmath124 on the real line , and will be singular at @xmath125 .",
    "therefore , it would not qualify as a real positive - definite solution . such solutions for @xmath118 should be considered to correspond to complex metrics where @xmath38 is generally complex - valued in the interior and real - valued on the given @xmath0 boundary and at @xmath119 .",
    "( one can choose contours for @xmath38 in the complex plane which avoid the singularity on the real line at @xmath126 and ensure regularity at @xmath119 ; see discussions in @xcite . )",
    "we will discuss the dependence of positivity ( and complexity ) of @xmath117 on the boundary data @xmath116 in detail for @xmath25 in section @xmath127 to explore the structure of ( real ) solutions and their actions and shall return to this issue .",
    "we will show that for a given boundary data @xmath116 the real regular infilling solution is unique and exists when a certain inequality holds between @xmath128 and @xmath129 .    for negative or complex roots of eq.([21 ] ) , the interior metrics are necessarily complex - valued .",
    "we now write down explicit solutions for our boundary - value problem .",
    "rewrite eq.([21 ] ) with the conformal rescaling @xmath130 so that @xmath131 are now dimensionless . for positive cosmological",
    "constant , this gives @xmath132 and , for negative cosmological constant , @xmath133 since we will be more interested in the case of negative cosmological constant , we only write down the solutions of @xmath134 .",

    "it is important to note here that , the appearance of explicit factors of @xmath140 in the expressions ( [ sol1])-([sol3 ] ) for the roots may not be an accurate guide as to whether a root is real or complex . in section @xmath141",
    ", we will see how to analyse the roots of @xmath142 ( in a way that would enable one to determine whether the roots are complex or real , for different values of @xmath143 ) without invoking the explicit solutions ( [ sol1])-([sol3 ] ) .",
    "however , we do need the explicit solutions in order to calculate the action for such geometries .",
    "the euclidean action is given by @xcite : @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the riemannian 4-manifold with boundary @xmath146 , and the 4-geometry @xmath147 agrees with the specified three - metric @xmath12 on the boundary , i.e. , @xmath148 .",
    "@xmath149 is the trace of the extrinsic curvature @xmath150 of the boundary .    for a classical solution , obeying the euler - lagrange equations of the action ( [ 29 ] )",

    "the action is a quadratic function of @xmath117  the solution of the third - degree equation  and hence would , in general , be complex ( real ) for @xmath117 complex ( real ) . corresponding to every solution of eq.([23 ] ) or eq.([24 ] ) , one can calculate the action merely by substitution in eq.([37 ] ) or eq.([38 ] )  one does _ not _ need to find @xmath98 ( or @xmath95 ) at all to evaluate the action . as we discussed in section @xmath163 ,",
    "not all positive solutions for @xmath117 correspond to real positive - definite solutions in the interior .",
    "therefore all real- and complex - valued solutions in the interior corresponding to the positive solutions for @xmath117 have real - valued euclidean actions .",
    "this is because the two limits ( here @xmath120 and @xmath119 ) of the integral ( [ 31 ] ) of @xmath38 lie on the real - line . interestingly , for negative solutions for @xmath117 , which correspond to @xmath120 and @xmath119 being purely imaginary , the actions are real as well",
    "this is not surprising given that the middle expression of ( [ 31 ] ) is a quartic polynomial in @xmath38 and @xmath31 . only the complex solutions for @xmath117 would in general have complex actions .",
    "before embarking on solutions with non - zero cosmological constant , it is desirable to understand the @xmath46 case",
    ". this will also provide us with an example and illustrate the utility of the method developed so far .",
    "for this case , the regular taub - nut metrics are given by the hawking solution ( [ 11 ] ) .",
    "the corresponding ( quadratic ) polynomial equation and actions are obtained by simply setting @xmath46 in eq.([21 ] ) and eq.([36 ] ) respectively .",
    "the two solutions and their actions are @xmath164 and @xmath165 following the discussions in section @xmath163 , it is easy to check that the negative - sign solution of ( [ solvac ] ) corresponds to a real positive - definite metric on the four - ball provided that @xmath166 this can be confirmed by solving for @xmath38 and @xmath31 directly ( which is possible in this case ) . for the negative and positive signs of eq.([solvac ] ) they are @xmath167 and @xmath168 ( two other solutions are obtained by changing orientation . ) note that , in contrary to the statement made in @xcite , positive - definite real infilling solutions do not exist for arbitrary boundary data although the actions ( [ actvac ] ) are real - valued for any value of @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "the issue of positive - definite real solutions on the four - ball will be made clearer in the following sections where we discuss the case of non - zero cosmological constant ( which includes @xmath46 as a special case ) .",
    "we now treat the case of a negative cosmological constant in greater detail and systematically discuss the structure of the solutions of @xmath169 as functions of boundary data @xmath116 .",
    "recall that @xmath109 can have a real solution only when @xmath117 is positive .",
    "therefore , by studying the solutions of eq.([44 ] ) , we are able to see the real and complex solutions of this boundary - value problem quite readily . however , before doing so we discuss the possibility of real positive - definite infilling solutions .      for",
    "a given boundary data @xmath116 , let the infilling solutions be denoted by @xmath118 .",
    "recall from our discussion in section @xmath163 that a real positive - definite infilling solution exists if @xmath120 and @xmath119 have like signs ( and if latexmath:[$|\\tilde{\\rho| } >    generality , that both @xmath120 and @xmath119 are positive , the equivalent requirement in the variables @xmath95 , @xmath98 is @xmath171 .",

    "note that the requirement ( [ neweq1 ] ) is independent of the size or sign of the cosmological constant .",

    "( in the case of a positive @xmath28 , we are not fortunate enough to have this particular advantage  the corresponding analysis is therefore just a step lengthier , although the methodology developed in this section equally applies .",
    "possible positive - definite real solutions are unique as in the case of negative cosmological constant . )",
    "we now discuss how the roots of eq.([44 ] ) change as the boundary data is varied .",
    "since for real ( complex ) roots the action is real ( complex ) this would enable us to study the real ( complex ) actions .",
    "in fact , as we will see below , regions of physical interest are covered by real solutions of eq.([44 ] ) .    as is apparent from the previous discussions",
    ", we must look carefully at the two different cases , for which the constant term is positive or negative .",
    "the condition determining the reality of the roots of @xmath142 is following ( see , for example , @xcite ) : @xmath204 however , for the discussion below one further needs to know descartes rule @xcite : _ the equation @xmath134 can not have more positive roots than @xmath142 has changes of sign , or more negative roots than @xmath205 has changes of sign_. ( it is also convenient to remember the elementary fact that the product of the roots of a polynomial equation of odd degree is minus the constant term . )      in this case @xmath208 is negative and hence @xmath142 has three changes of sign and @xmath205 has none .",
    "therefore , there will be either @xmath209 three positive roots of @xmath142 or @xmath210 two complex and one positive roots , depending on which condition of ( [ realcon ] ) @xmath116 satisfies .",
    "one of the positive roots in the former case and the positive root in the latter case will correspond to real positive - definite regular solutions in the interior .      in this case , @xmath208 is positive and hence @xmath142 has two changes of sign and @xmath205 has one .",
    "so @xmath142 has either @xmath209 two positive roots and one negative or @xmath210 two complex and one negative , depending on which condition of ( [ realcon ] ) @xmath116 satisfies .      for this special case @xmath214 and hence",
    "the valid roots are the solutions of @xmath215 which will have either two positive or two complex roots .",
    "( the other root is @xmath216 which is not physically meaningful . )",
    "however , neither of the positive roots , which exist if @xmath217 , will be less than @xmath128 and hence there is no real infilling solution in the interior .",
    "+ we now combine descartes rule with the conditions of ( [ realcon ] ) ( fig .",
    "1 ) . we plot the    curves @xmath213 ( green line ) and @xmath218 ( blue line ) . for physical interest ,",
    "we have also plotted the line @xmath219 which represents isotropy .",
    "the two curves divides the @xmath220 plane in four regions .",
    "this is the region bounded between the two curves on the left - hand side of their intersection point , with the green line included .",
    "one root is negative and two others positive .",
    "the positive roots become equal on the blue line and the negative root become zero on the green line .",
    "none of the positive roots corresponds to a real infilling solution in the interior of the berger sphere .",
    "this is the region above the intersection point of the two curves .",
    "so there is one pair of complex roots and a negative root . on the green line",
    "there are only a pair of complex roots , the real one being zero .",
    "two roots are complex and one is real and positive .",
    "the positive root corresponds to a real positive - definite infilling solution in the interior .",
    "as above , on the green line , the real root is zero .",
    "this is the region bounded by the two lines below their point of intersection , with the blue line included .",
    "all roots are positive and one of them corresponds to a real infilling solution .",
    "two roots are equal on the blue line .      in the previous section",
    "we have studied the general behaviour of the roots systematically .",
    "although @xmath129 appears only in the constant term of @xmath142 , its role is rather crucial in determining the sign and reality of the roots . in this section",
    "we will study the roots of @xmath142 and their corresponding actions numerically , and demonstrate an interesting connection with catastrophe theory .",
    "first we study the roots and actions for fixed values of @xmath128 , as functions of @xmath129 . from the analysis in the previous section ( and from fig .",
    "1 ) , one would expect to study three distinct generic cases , determined by the value of @xmath128 less than , equal to and greater than its value where the two curves meet , i.e. , at @xmath221 ( and @xmath222 ) .      for a fixed @xmath223 , by varying @xmath129 one moves continuously from region iv ( three positive roots ) to the green line where one of the roots become zero ( two still being positive ) , then into region i , where two roots continue to be positive , but the other is now negative , and then to the blue line where the positive roots become equal , and then to region ii where they turn complex ( the other still being negative ) .",
    "the behaviour of the three roots and the corresponding euclidean actions are plotted in figs . 2 and 3 ( as long as they remain real ) , as functions of @xmath129 for @xmath224 and @xmath225 respectively .",
    "( the same colour is used to show the correspondence . )",
    "( @xmath224),title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]     ( @xmath225),title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]      for the special value of @xmath221 , all roots are positive in region iv , where , on the point that the green and blue lines meet two become equal and the other becomes zero . on entering region ii",
    "the two equal roots become a complex - conjugate pair and the other turns negative .",
    "the behaviour of the three roots is therefore similar to the previous behaviour , except that they all turn complex and become negative at the same value ( @xmath222 ) ( fig .",
    "@xmath141 ) .",
    "the corresponding actions also have a structure similar to those in @xmath223 .",
    "( @xmath221),title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]      for @xmath226 one starts in region iv with three positive roots , two of which become equal on the blue line and then turn complex and remain so in region ii .",
    "the other root remains positive in region iii and becomes zero on the green line to become negative in region ii .",
    "@xmath127 ( @xmath227 ) and fig .",
    "@xmath228 ( @xmath229 ) .",
    "when @xmath226 ( @xmath227),title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]     for large @xmath128(@xmath229),title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]      one can see that certain patterns emerge for both @xmath142 and @xmath13 . for fixed values of @xmath128 , the real solutions of @xmath142 form a two - fold pattern as functions of @xmath129 .",
    "one can check that this occurs for all @xmath128 , large and small .",
    "the upper and lower folds turn over at @xmath230 and at @xmath231 respectively .",
    "this is easily understood with the help of fig .",
    "@xmath206 : the curves ( of two roots ) in the upper fold meet when the two roots become equal at @xmath232 , i.e. , before entering the combined region of ii and iii where they turn complex . on the other hand , on @xmath231 , @xmath142 has a double root equal to @xmath128 ( the other root is @xmath233 )  therefore the lower folds turn over around the @xmath231 line .",
    "the surface @xmath134 thus formed by placing such images successively ( fig .",
    "@xmath234 ) is similar in structure to a cusp catastrophe manifold familiar in dynamical systems driven by a quartic potential with two control parameters ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the minima of a quartic potential occur when its derivative ( a polynomial of degree three ) is set to zero and hence the catastrophe manifold represents the equilibrium points of the system .",
    "the `` catastrophe map '' is then the part of projection of the catastrophe manifold onto the plane of the control variables bounded between the lines along which the folds turn over  in our case this is the region bounded between @xmath231 and @xmath232 curves in fig .",
    "@xmath206 , i.e. , the union of region i and iv .",
    "however , one may wonder why a cusp does not appear in this case .",
    "this is because of the ( particular ) way in which @xmath128 and @xmath129 combine in the coefficients of @xmath142 and also because they are constrained to be positive  both facts are dictated by the physical configuration .",
    "one can obtain a cusp , however , by working with the new variable @xmath235 instead of @xmath129 .",
    "a cusp will appear at @xmath236 , which is obviously outside the range of our physical interest .",
    "it is not difficult to see that @xmath13 has the same catastrophe map , namely the union of region i and iv .",
    "however , the more important observation is that the relative orientation of the folds of @xmath13 is the same as that of the corresponding roots of @xmath142 , i.e. , they do not cross each other .",
    "this pattern persists even when one gets very close to @xmath237 as shown in fig . @xmath238 .",
    "for very small values of @xmath128 the green and blue lines nearly overlap and coincide completely for @xmath237 .",
    "they therefore meet the red line at infinity . for higher values of @xmath128 one",
    "gets a persistent behaviour as in figs .",
    "therefore the `` catastrophe manifold '' of @xmath13 is `` diffeomorphic '' to the one found above for @xmath117 , i.e. , the surface @xmath13 is obtainable from that of @xmath117 by a deformation which preserves the catastrophe map .",
    "this is not automatic or obvious given the form of @xmath13 which is a quadratic function of @xmath117 .",
    "note , however , that the surface of @xmath13 is not smooth where the upper fold occurs .    the two - dimensional catastrophe map in a dynamical system with a quartic potential demarcates the regions of three stable minima and one stable minimum . in our case",
    "they indicate a demarcation between the regions where there are three real @xmath13 and one real @xmath13 for the boundary - value problem .",
    "( @xmath241),title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=28.0% ]     ( @xmath242),title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=28.0% ]     ( @xmath243),title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=28.0% ]     ( @xmath244),title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=28.0% ]      the observations that the space of @xmath13 is diffeomorphic to that of @xmath117 and that it does not intersect itself have immediate physical implications .",
    "this means that the dominant contribution will always come from _",
    "one _ solution , namely the one represented by the green curve in figs .",
    "@xmath89-@xmath240 ( and the meshed surface in fig .",
    "@xmath234 ) . note that this is the solution which gives a positive - definite infilling solution as long as @xmath245 .",
    "one can verify from figs .",
    "@xmath89-@xmath228 that this solution always takes values within the interval @xmath184 .    in cosmology ,",
    "one is more interested in regions where @xmath4 is not greatly different from @xmath3 and usually when they are both large .",
    "all three roots are positive in this latter region .",
    "taking @xmath219 , the roots of @xmath142 are @xmath246 it is easy to check that only @xmath247 and , hence , @xmath248 corresponds to the positive - definite real infilling solution in the interior .",
    "the dominant contribution to the path integral ( [ 1 ] ) will therefore come from @xmath248 ( which can also be checked explicitly in this case ) .",
    "the action of this solution is given by @xmath249 so becoming more negative as @xmath128 grows .",
    "actions for @xmath250 and @xmath251 are positive and become more positive as @xmath128 grows , as can be checked explicitly by direct substitution .",
    "we have shown that , for a given boundary which is a berger sphere ( a squashed @xmath0 with two axes equal ) , there are in general three distinct ways in which one can fill in with a self - dual taub - nut-(anti)de sitter metric . with suitable choice of variables ,",
    "the problem of finding explicit solutions for such infilling metrics can be translated into a univariate algebraic equation of degree three and hence can be solved exactly .",
    "the euclidean action @xmath13 is a quadratic function of the solutions of this third - degree equation and hence , corresponding to every solution of this equation , the action can be found purely in terms of the boundary data  the two radii @xmath23 of the berger sphere , for both positive and negative cosmological constants .",
    "the positive and negative roots of this equation correspond to metrics for which actions are real  only complex solutions correspond to complex - valued actions in general .",
    "in the case of a negative cosmological constant , we have further discussed systematically the ranges of @xmath3 and @xmath4 where the solutions of the algebraic system lead to real- and complex - valued solutions in the interior and have studied the structure of the three roots .",
    "we found that one of the roots corresponds to a positive - definite infilling solution if and only if @xmath252 . for small squashing , i.e. , when @xmath3 and @xmath4 are of the same order and not too small , all three roots are positive .",
    "when @xmath3 and @xmath4 are exactly equal , this holds for small radius as well .",
    "we therefore investigated the roots and their corresponding actions numerically in this range ( i.e. , until two of them turn complex ) as functions of the boundary variables @xmath3 , @xmath4 .",
    "we found that both the roots and the actions have structures similar to those of the cusp catastrophe in dynamical systems .",
    "the `` catastrophe manifold '' of @xmath13 does not intersect itself which implies that the the dominant contribution will come from the positive - definite infilling solution .",
    "further , the classical actions for large values of the radii @xmath23 in their isotropic limit ( of particular interest for cosmology ) have been discussed . the ( dominant ) contribution coming from the positive - definite solution",
    "has an action proportional to @xmath253 , thereby favouring large radii .",
