    "first passage time ( fpt ) processes are ubiquitous in physics , chemistry , and biology , with numerous examples of applications ranging from enzymes searching for specific dna sequences to animal foraging @xcite .",
    "the problem of finding the fpt distribution has direct implications in the fields of neutron or light scattering @xcite and in biological modelling .",

    "the role of the confining domain on the fpt distribution of a regulation protein to a specific dna site can account for the bursting dynamics in gene regulation @xcite .",
    "when a target is located on the boundary of a confining domain , the fpt can be understood as the first exit time from the domain through an opening ( e.g. , a `` hole '' ) on the boundary .",
    "hitherto most studies have focused on the mean first passage time ( mfpt ) of a brownian particle to a small exit , which is called the narrow escape problem @xcite . for a starting position which is far enough from the boundary ,",
    "the fpt distribution was shown to be dominated by its exponential tail in the limit of a large confining volume : hence the mfpt was sufficient to characterize the whole fpt distribution , except for the very short  times region @xcite .",

    "we address the following question : what is the distribution of the first passage time to an arbitrarily large exit ?",
    "to answer this question , we consider a particle diffusing in a confined spherically symmetric two - dimensional domain @xmath0 which is periodic along the angular coordinate @xmath1 and bounded in the radial coordinate @xmath2 . examples of such domains are disks , angular sectors , and annuli .",
