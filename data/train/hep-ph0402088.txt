    "so far the existence of the dark matter ( dm ) is our best _ experimental _ evidence for new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "the most recent wmap data @xcite confirm the standard cosmological model and precisely pin down the amount of cold dark matter as @xmath0 , in accord with earlier indications .",
    "nevertheless , the exact nature of the dark matter still remains a mystery , as all known particles are excluded as dm candidates .",
    "this makes the dark matter problem the most pressing phenomenological motivation for particles and interactions beyond the standard model ( bsm ) .",
    "the weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) represent a whole class of particle dark matter candidates which are well motivated by both particle physics and astrophysics . on the particle physics side , many bsm theories predict stable wimps . on the astrophysics side",
    ", the result from the calculation of the wimp thermal relic density falls in the right ballpark .",
    "wimps also offer excellent opportunities for detection : since they must have been able to annihilate sufficiently fast in the early universe , they should also produce observable signals in direct and indirect dark matter detection experiments .    generally speaking",
    ", it is rather easy to cook up bsm dark matter .",
    "the main steps in model - building are the following :    1 .   enlarging the particle content of the sm ; 2 .   introducing a symmetry which guarantees that one of the newly introduced particles is stable ; 3 .   fudging the model parameters until the lightest new stable particle is neutral and has the proper thermal relic density .    in the next three sections",
    "i will illustrate this model - building recipe with three generic examples of bsm theories with good dm candidates . section  [ sec : susy ] is devoted to supersymmetry  @xcite in its most popular version ( minimal supergravity ) , where the dm candidate is the lightest superpartner . in section  [ sec : ued ]",
    "i consider the model of universal extra dimensions  @xcite where the lightest kaluza - klein mode is the dm particle .",
    "then in section  [ sec : lh ] i discuss dm in little higgs theories  @xcite . in each case , after a brief introduction to the theory i will discuss why the dm particle is stable , what is its preferred mass range and what are the discovery prospects for its direct detection . the potential discovery and discrimination of these alternatives at high energy colliders is the subject of section  [ sec : colliders ] while section  [ sec : conclusions ] contains a comparative summary and conclusions .",
    "the subject of distinguishing these scenarios in astroparticle physics experiments in space is covered in j. feng s contribution to these proceedings .",
    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is a theory with extra dimensions described by new _ anticommuting _ coordinates @xmath1 .",
    "the theory is defined in terms of superfields living in _",
    "@xmath2 : @xmath3 where the pair @xmath4 is a sm particle and its superpartner .",
    "supersymmetry thus predicts a host of new particles , offering a potential solution to the dm problem .",
    "a robust prediction of susy is that each superpartner has couplings identical to and spin differing by @xmath5 from the corresponding sm particle .",
    "unfortunately , the superpartner mass spectrum is very model dependent as it is related to the details of susy breaking .",
    "all superpartners are charged under a discrete symmetry called @xmath6-parity , which is a remnant of translational invariance along the @xmath7 coordinates .",
    "the @xmath6-parity assignments are @xmath8 for sm particles and @xmath9 for their superpartners . in many models",
    "one requires that @xmath6-parity is conserved , which provides a simultaneous solution to the proton decay problem . as a bonus",
    ", @xmath6-parity conservation guarantees that virtual supersymmetric contributions only arise at the loop level , thus avoiding constraints from precision electroweak data . as a result of @xmath6-parity conservation ,",
    "the lightest superpartner ( lsp ) , being odd under @xmath6-parity , is absolutely stable and becomes a dm candidate . in the remainder of this section",
    ", we shall restrict ourselves to the case of minimal supergravity ( msugra ) and describe the cosmologically preferred parameter space with a wimp lsp .",
    "the desired wimp in supersymmetry is the lightest neutralino @xmath10 , which is a mixture of the superpartners of the hypercharge gauge boson ( @xmath11 ) , the neutral @xmath12 gauge boson ( @xmath13 ) , and the two neutral higgs bosons ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) : @xmath16 in large regions of the msugra parameter space , @xmath10 indeed turns out to be the lsp .",

    "the ( green ) shaded regions are excluded from the requirement that the lsp be neutral ( left ) and the chargino mass bound from lep ( bottom and right ) .",
    "the light ( yellow ) shaded region in between corresponds to the pre - wmap preferred range of @xmath24 .",
    "the red ( dark ) shaded region is the remaining parameter space after wmap . from ref .",
    "@xcite . ]    the pre - wmap ( post - wmap ) preferred parameter space is also shown in yellow ( red ) .",
    "we easily see two regions where @xmath10 is a good dm candidate .",
    "the `` coannihilation '' region at low @xmath25 exhibits a gaugino - like lsp , whose relic density is diluted due to coannihilation processes involving @xmath26 sleptons  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , at large @xmath25 one finds the so called `` focus point region ''",
    "@xcite , where the lsp has a non - negligible higgsino component , and annihilation is enhanced due to a complementary set of diagrams proportional to gaugino - higgsino mixing  @xcite . unlike the coannihilation region , the focus point region is characterized by heavy scalar superpartners , and as a result all virtual supersymmetric effects are suppressed  @xcite . in the absence of any significant discrepancies from the sm , the focus point region tends to be preferred in global fits to the data  @xcite .     for spin - independent @xmath10 scattering on protons from two different codes ( circles and crosses ) for the 13 benchmark points of @xcite .",
    "projected sensitivities for cdms ii  @xcite ( solid line ) and genius  @xcite ( dashed line ) are also shown . from ref .",
    "@xcite . ]    , for spin - dependent @xmath10 scattering on protons .",
    "the solid line is the projected sensitivity of a 100 kg naiad array  @xcite . from ref .",
    "@xcite . ]      the prospects for direct detection of susy wimps in experiments sensitive to spin - independent ( spin - dependent ) wimp - nucleon interactions are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : scalar ] ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spin ] ) @xcite , for the set of 13 susy benchmark points from @xcite .",
    "we see that spin - independent scattering offers the best possibilities for detection  about half of the benchmark points fall within the sensitivity range of the upcoming experiments .",
    "unfortunately , we also see that due to accidental cancellations , one can not place a firm lower bound on the predicted signal ( see , e.g. points d and k ) .",
    "regarding spin - dependent scattering , the prospects are less optimistic , as all 13 benchmark points fall far below the experimental sensitivity .",
    "therefore , a likely signal in the spin - independent channel will still leave open the question of the exact nature of the dm particle , and its spin , in particular . in the next two sections",
    ", we shall describe alternative dm candidates whose main difference from susy wimps is their spin .",
    "universal extra dimensions  @xcite is an extra dimension theory with new _ bosonic _ coordinates @xmath27 ( in the simplest case of only one extra dimension , @xmath27 spans a circle of radius @xmath6 ) : @xmath28 each sm field @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) has an infinite tower of kaluza - klein ( kk ) partners @xmath31 and @xmath32 with identical spins and couplings and masses of order @xmath33 . in order to obtain chiral fermions , the extra dimension is compactified on an @xmath34 orbifold .",
    "fields which are odd under the @xmath35 orbifold symmetry do not have zero modes ( @xmath36 ) , which allows us to project out the zero modes of the fermions with the wrong chiralities and the 5th component of the gauge fields .",
    "the remaining zero modes are just the standard model particles in 3 + 1 dimensions .",
    "a peculiar feature of ued is the conservation of kk number at tree level , a simple consequence of momentum conservation along the extra dimension .",
    "however , bulk and brane radiative effects @xcite break kk number down to a discrete conserved quantity , the so called kk parity : @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the kk level .",
    "kk parity ensures that the lightest kk partner ( lkp ) at level one , being odd under kk parity , is stable and can be a dm candidate .",
    "similar to the susy case , new physics contributions to various precisely measured low - energy observables only arise at the loop level and are small .      including the one - loop radiative corrections , the mass spectrum of the level 1 kk - partners ( see fig .",
