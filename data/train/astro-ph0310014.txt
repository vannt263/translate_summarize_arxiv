    "the epoch of cosmic reionization is one of the most important epochs to understand in the investigation of the history of the universe , because it contains the imprint of important information on cosmic structure formation and evolution .",
    "this is because the reionization of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) occurs promptly ( e.g. gnedin & ostriker 1997 ) and the cosmic ionizing background radiation can penetrate the dense hi condensations of virialized objects ( miralda - escud , haehnelt , & rees 2000 ; barkana & loeb 1999 ) .",
    "the epoch of the reionization observationally relates to the gunn - peterson trough ( gunn & peterson 1965 ) .",
    "the significantly ionized igm in the observed spectra of qsos at @xmath2 ( dey et al .",
    "1998 ; hu , cowie , & mcmahon 1998 ; spinrad et al . 1998 ; weymann et al . 1998 ) implies that most of the intergalactic hydrogen in the universe has been reionized before @xmath3 .",
    "some standard cosmological models predict that reionization takes place around a redshift of @xmath4 .",
    "however , according to the results of the wmap project , kogut et al .",
    "( 2003 ) may have discovered the high redshift reionization of the universe ( @xmath5 ) . to resolve this discrepancy",
    ", the direct detection of the emission from the first objects is very important .",
    "this is because that emission reflects the physical and chemical properties of the first star clusters ( shchekinov 1991 ; kamaya & silk 2002 ) and/or protogalaxies .",
    "once we know the origin of the first emission , the ionization rate at that time is investigated . therefore , new detailed studies and confirmation of the previous studies of the first emission in another way are important for the subsequent progress of the research fields .",
    "it is interesting to detect just the first ly@xmath0 photons since the star formation rate and/or the ionization structure of the interstellar medium are examined from that intensity . using standard cosmological models",
    ", cosmic recombination takes place at @xmath6 .",
    "after that epoch , the universe becomes predominantly neutral .",
    "when the first galaxies and/or star clusters form , they are surrounded by the neutral igm .",
    "one might naively expect the damping wing of the ly@xmath0 trough to eliminate any trace of a ly@xmath0 emission line in the observed source spectra .",
    "however , the ly@xmath0 photons are scattered and diffused redward in frequency owing to the hubble expansion of the surrounding hi igm ( loeb & rybicki 1999 ; hereafter lr99 ) .",
    "when the cumulative frequency - shift becomes significantly large , they can escape and travel freely toward the observer .",
    "although we investigate a similar problem to that in lr99 , the radiative transfer model is improved in the two ways : ( 1 ) formulation of the geometrical scattering ( i.e. test photons scatter spatially three dimension ) ; and ( 2 ) formulation of the ly@xmath0 opacity .",
    "thanks to these two improvements and the confirmation of the previous studies , we can study more complex physical conditions in the expanding hi gas .",
    "since the large scale structure ( lss ) forms filaments , this suggests the initial stage of the gravitational deceleration for the lss favors an asymmetrical expansion of the hi halo .",
    "indeed , the inhomogeneity of the self - gravitating system can grow in a free - fall time ( e.g. lin , mestel , & shu 1965 ) .",
    "as long as the expansion time - scale is comparable to the free - fall time scale , the asymmetrical deceleration of the igm occurs in the time - scale of the hubble expansion , although the initial asymmetry is obviously very weak . as the first and the simplest hypothesis to investigate the effect of the inhomogeneity via the gravitational deceleration for the lss formation , we adopt the aspherical expansion model of hi igm .",
    "the physical implication drawn from the current analysis will suggest to us further research projects for the first ly@xmath0 .",
    "since the lumpiness and/or small - scale irregularity may be important for a realistic treatment of the first ly@xmath0 , we will investigate these effects in subsequent papers .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in  2 we describe the formalism of the ly@xmath0 line transfer problem commenting on the differences between our approach and lr99 . in ",
    "3 we outline our monte carlo simulation method . in  4 we discuss our numerical results including the effects of a more complete representation of the ly@xmath0 opacity , the effect of asphericity in the expanding igm , and the sensitivity of our results to redshift and cosmological parameters . in  5 we summarize our study .",
    "we formulate the problem according to lr99 , while the hi igm is hypothesized to expand aspherically . in general",
    ", the exactly spherical expansion is not expected as long as the igm decelerates to form lss .",
    "this is recognized because the free - fall time , @xmath7 , is comparable to the hubble expansion time , @xmath8 , as explained in  1 .",
    "then , to find the effect of the asymmetry , we shall set the most simple assumption to the recession velocity , _ spheroidal expansion _ : @xmath9^{1/2}$ ] , where @xmath10 is recession velocity , @xmath11 is the hubble expansion rate at the source redshift of @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is _ ellipticity _ or decreasing rate of the recession velocity to the pure hubble expansion .",
    "we shall estimate the allowed order of @xmath13 .",
    "the ratio of the two time - scales is denoted as @xmath14 here , @xmath15 is the ratio of the density of the halo to the mean density of the universe at @xmath16 .",
    "of course , this ratio must not be different from unity very much as long as igm expands .",
    "since the density of the aspherically decelerating hi halo is larger than that of the spherically expanding halo , we find @xmath17 with mass conservation .",
    "fixing the ratio of eq.(1 ) to be unity and postulating @xmath18 , for example , we estimate @xmath19 for @xmath20 .",
    "thus , we recognize that order of @xmath13 is about 0.1 .",
    "the case of @xmath21 is considered as an extreme case .",
    "obviously , @xmath22 corresponds to lr99 .",
    "although @xmath13 should approach to unity differentially from small scale to large scale , we assign @xmath13 a single value for simplicity .",
    "fortunately , the size of the concerned region , @xmath23 , which is a characteristic distance from the ly@xmath0 photon source as defined later , is @xmath24 mpc as estimated in lr99 .",
    "that is , @xmath25 corresponds to the size of groups of galaxies and the region at @xmath25 can be regarded as decelerating region although the allowed deceleration should be small ( but not zero ) .",
    "expansion law of the spheroid approaches to that of the spherical model at larger scale than @xmath25 .",
    "properties of test photons are also determined at @xmath23 .",
    "hence , the single value hypothesis for @xmath13 can present the physical insight into the effect of the deceleration for the lr halo . in realistic condition , by the way , @xmath13 inside @xmath25 should decrease toward the center differentially . then",
    ", our finding characteristic effect of the deceleration may be enhanced because the number of scattering can increase owing to the deceleration as shown in this paper .",
    "let @xmath26 be the specific intensity ( in photons @xmath27 ) , where @xmath28 is comoving frequency , @xmath29 is the radial vector from the source galaxy , and @xmath30 is the scattering direction .",

    "the scattering opacity @xmath36 was approximated as @xmath42 . in the current paper",
    ", we formulate the opacity in the following more complete form : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the ly@xmath0 frequency , @xmath45 is the rate of spontaneous radiative decay from @xmath46 to @xmath47 energy levels of hydrogen , @xmath48 is the oscillator strength , @xmath49 is the wavelength of the ly@xmath0 line , and @xmath50 is @xmath51 @xmath52 hz@xmath53 ( eq . ( 5 ) in lr99 ) . in the initial scattering phase , eq.(4 )",
    "is important since the frequency shift can be smaller than @xmath54 .",
    "when the photon diffuses and the frequency shift is comparable to @xmath34 , eq.(7 ) must be adopted as @xmath36 .",

    "lr99 solved a dimensionless transfer equation in the diffusion regime , which is valid in the region @xmath76 .",
    "they also studied the numerical solution of the transfer equation using a monte carlo technique and found that it agreed with the diffusion equation in the low frequency shift region .",
    "we also solve the transfer equation numerically by using a monte carlo method very similar to lr99 .",
    "the number of test photons is @xmath77 , the same as in lr99 , and permits us to compare our results directly to theirs . during the calculation two photon decay",
    "is always neglected since it is difficult to destroy the lyman @xmath0 photons transferred in the surrounding hi .",
    "this is because the event rate of two photon decay is determined by the process of a transition between @xmath78 - @xmath46 owing to the radiative collision with an electron ( breit & teller 1940 ; spitzer & greenstein 1951 ) . as long as the relic electron number density is very small , the event rate of two photon decay should be negligible .",
    "lr99 adopted the initial shift method in the first step of each simulation .",
    "that is , the initial shift of @xmath69 is 0.01 and @xmath79 is determined stochastically by means of the diffusion solution of lr99 .",
    "we have confirmed independently that the initial shift method is very reasonable .",
