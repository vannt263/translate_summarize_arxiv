    "the subject of hamiltonian circuits and walks plays an important role in mathematics and physics alike . given a connected undirected graph @xmath7 , a _",
    "hamiltonian circuit _ ( or cycle ) is a cycle ( i.e. , a closed loop ) through @xmath7 that visits each of the @xmath8 vertices of @xmath7 exactly once @xcite .",
    "in particular , a hamiltonian circuit has length @xmath8 .",
    "similarly , a _",
    "hamiltonian walk _",
    "( or path ) is an open non - empty path ( i.e. , with two distinct extremities ) of length @xmath9 that visits each vertex exactly once .",
    "note that a hamiltonian circuit can be turned into a hamiltonian walk by removing any one of its edges , whereas a hamiltonian walk can be extended into a hamiltonian circuit only if its end points are adjacent in @xmath7 .    .",
    "]    we add now to this list of well - known definitions the set @xmath10 of _ hamiltonian chains _ of order @xmath0 .",
    "each member in @xmath10 is a set of @xmath0 disjoint paths whose union visits each vertex of @xmath7 exactly once ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : chain ] ) .",
    "the set of hamiltonian walks is then @xmath11 , and by convention we shall let @xmath12 denote the set of hamiltonian circuits .",
    "note that if @xmath8 is even , @xmath13 is the set of dimer coverings of @xmath7 .",
    "the hamiltonian chain problem has been studied earlier by duplantier and david on the manhattan lattice @xcite , but never to our knowledge on an undirected lattice .",
    "determining whether @xmath7 contains a hamiltonian circuit is a difficult ( np - complete ) problem .",
    "an even more difficult problem is to determine _ how many _ distinct hamiltonian circuits are contained in @xmath7 . in this paper",
    "we shall present an algorithm that efficiently enumerates hamiltonian circuits , walks , and chains for regular low - dimensional graphs .",
    "the motivation for studying such hamiltonian structures is by no means limited to graph theory . indeed , under appropriate solvent conditions",
    ", biopolymers such as proteins may fold to form compact conformations , the study of which is currently at the centre of an intense activity in the biophysics community .",
    "while real biopolymers contain complicated interactions which can probably not be fully accounted for within any simple lattice model , the study of hamiltonian walks has been advocated as a first approximation for understanding qualitatively the excluded - volume mechanisms at work behind such problems as polymer melting @xcite and protein folding @xcite .",
    "our extension to hamiltonian chains permits to study polydisperse models of several polymers .",
    "another interest stems from the study of magnetic systems with o(@xmath14 ) symmetry in physics .",
    "these can modelled on the lattice as self - avoiding loops ( each having the weight @xmath14 ) @xcite , which , in the limit of vanishing temperature @xmath15 , are constrained to visit all the vertices @xcite .",
    "coupling such systems to a magnetic field @xmath16 amounts , in a perturbative expansion around @xmath17 , to inserting pairs of loop end points @xcite . in the limit @xmath18 , the partition function @xmath19 of the o(@xmath14 ) model at @xmath20 in a weak magnetic field @xmath16",
    "can thus be expressed in terms of the number of hamiltonian chains as @xmath21    finally , the exact enumeration of configurations is useful for settling issues of ergodicity when developing algorithms that provide unbiased sampling of hamiltonian walks in two @xcite and three @xcite dimensions .",
    "in section  [ sec : alg ] we present our enumeration algorithm and discuss some aspects of its implementation . results in dimensions @xmath22 and @xmath23 are given in section  [ sec : res ] . for convenience ,",
    "we limit the discussion to the simplest lattices ( square and cubic ) , although the construction extends straightforwardly to any regular lattice .",
    "our results are strongest in @xmath22 where we determine all @xmath10 for @xmath3 square lattices up to @xmath4 , @xmath24 up to @xmath5 , and @xmath12 up to @xmath6 . in @xmath23 the largest lattice that we were able to access has size @xmath25 .",
    "finally , we show in section  [ sec : app ] how to extract physically interesting quantities from our data .",
    "we first present our algorithm in dimension @xmath22 and then discuss the necessary modifications for @xmath23 .",
    "for convenience , we limit the presentation to the simplest lattices , viz .  an @xmath26 square lattice and an @xmath27 cubic lattice , although the construction extends straightforwardly to any regular lattice .",
    "the boundary conditions are free ( non - periodic ) , although it will be clear that it is easy to introduce periodic boundary conditions along _ one _ of the lattice directions .",
    "the algorithm is based on the transfer matrix principle , according to which the lattice is cut into two parts by means of a conveniently chosen @xmath28 dimensional oriented surface @xmath29 .",
    "the part of the lattice above ( resp .  below ) @xmath29 is called the future ( resp .",
    "the past ) .",
    "the surface @xmath29 cuts the lattice only at mid points of edges .    .",
    "the lattice is shown in solid line style , with the dotted lines representing lattice edges beyond the bounds of the lattice .",
    "the surface @xmath29 is shown as a dashed line . ]    at the initial ( resp .",
    "final ) step of the enumeration the whole lattice belongs to the future ( resp .",
    "past ) , so the algorithm consists in sweeping @xmath29 over the entire lattice .",
    "this is done by gradually pushing @xmath29 towards the future , so that in any one step of the algorithm a _ single _",
    "vertex is transferred from the future to the past . a few subsequent steps for a @xmath30 lattice",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : transfer ] .",
    "square . ]    in any step , the configuration of the system is described by some information about the edges cut by @xmath29 , and by the number @xmath0 of chains which have already been completed .",
    "the information refered to is the connectivity of the cut edges with respect to the part of the lattice which belongs to the past , and is best illustrated by an example ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : config ] ) . the complete description of the configuration reads in this case @xmath31 , where the first @xmath32 entries refer to the state of the cut edges which are parallel to the 2-direction ( vertical ) , and the next entry refers to the state of the one cut edge which is parallel to the 1-direction ( horizontal ) .",
    "the last entry is the number @xmath2 of completed chains . in the connectivity part of the information , we use the following coding :    1 .",
    "a zero entry means an empty edge .",
    "two equal positive entries mean a pair of edges which are connected in the past by part of a chain .",
    "each of these edges will eventually have to be linked to a chain end point in the future , so as to form a complete chain .",
    "3 .   an unpaired positive entry means an edge which forms part of a partially completed chain , one end point of which has already been fixed in the past .",
    "the edge will eventually be linked to another end point in the future , leading to the formation of a complete chain .",
    "it is important to avoid any redundancy in this connectivity information .",
    "a unique coding is obtained by requiring that the positive entries ( i.e. , unpaired entries , or the leftmost member of a pair of equal entries ) be arranged in increasing order ( @xmath33 ) when reading through the coding from left to right .    in step @xmath34 of the enumeration",
    ", the configurations are transfered from `` time '' @xmath34 to time @xmath35 .",
    "more precisely , each configuration at time @xmath34 is examined in turn , and all its descendent configurations at time @xmath35 are generated by exhausting the possible arrangements of the chain at the vertex which is transfered from the future to the past .",
    "the information described above is necessary and sufficient for deducing the connectivity information at time @xmath35 from that at time @xmath34 .",
    "note that since the transfered vertex is not allowed to be empty , there are four possible arrangements if it accommodates a chain end , and six arrangements if a chain passes though it .",
    "each configuration generated at time @xmath35 is inserted in an appropriate date structure  a hash table  which also keeps track of its weight ( here an integer ) .",
    "the weight of a descendent configuration is the sum of the weights of all the parent configurations that generated it .",
    "some of the generated descendent configurations are however _ rejected _ before insertion in the hash table ( see below ) .",
    "once step @xmath34 has been completed , the hash table storing the configurations at time @xmath34 is erased , and one can move on to step @xmath35 . in this way , only two hash tables ( at times @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) are needed in the entire process .",
    "note that the choice of data structure is essential for the feasibility and the efficiency of the algorithm .",
    "a hash table permits to store the configurations via a key which is obtained by reading its coding as one large integer , modulo a suitably chosen prime . storing and retrieving configurations can be done in constant time , i.e. , independently of the number of configurations being stored in the hash table .",
    "the hash table also allows to keep track of the weight of each configuration , according to the above rule .",
    "namely , when a descendent configuration is generated with weight @xmath36 , we first make an attempt of looking it up in the hash table at time @xmath35 .",
    "if it is not there , it is inserted with weight @xmath36 .",
    "if it is already there , @xmath36 is added to the weight of configuration already present .    if in the transfer process the two ends of the same chain ( coded by two equal positive entries ) join up , the resulting configuration is rejected , since this would mean forming a cycle rather than a chain .",
    "( we make an exception to this rule when the very last vertex is added , since this permits to enumerate @xmath12 . )",
    "if an unpaired positive entry gets left behind in the past it means that a chain has been completed , and so @xmath37 .",
    "denote now a general configuration as @xmath38 . at step @xmath39 ,",
    "the initial state is @xmath40 and has weight @xmath41 .",
    "when a row of the lattice is completed , any configuration with @xmath42 gets rejected . when transfering the @xmath43th vertex of the last row , any configuration with @xmath44 gets rejected .",
    "this trick allows us to avoid having to deal with a lot of special cases when a boundary vertex is transfered  and also makes it much easier in practice to implement the algorithm correctly .",
    "after step @xmath45 the lattice belongs completely to the past , and all the configurations are of the form @xmath46 .",
    "their respective weights are precisely the @xmath10 that we wanted to compute .    the maximum lattice size that we can attain is essentially limited by the number of different intermediate configurations generated in the transfer process .",
    "this number attains its largest value after transfering the next last vertex in the next last row . in practice",
    "we could store at most @xmath47 configurations .",
    "as usual in enumeration studies , the coefficients @xmath10 are much larger than the integers which are usually represented by a computer ( @xmath48 for an unsigned integer on a 32-bit machine ) .",
    "we therefore repeat the enumeration several times , computing each time the result modulo different coprime integers ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 ,  ) , and reconstruct the true result in the end by using the chinese remainder theorem .",
    "note that the use of modular arithmetics is possible because the weights of configurations are constructed only by successive additions of positive integers .",
    "the counts for systems of size @xmath26 and @xmath52 should of course coincide .",
    "verifying that this is indeed the case is however a very strong check of the algorithm , since permuting @xmath32 and @xmath53 ( with @xmath54 ) leads to a completely different transfer process in terms of the propagation of the surface @xmath29 .",
    "we have performed such checks both for @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "we now describe briefly how the algorithm can be adapted to a @xmath55-dimensional hypercubic lattice of size @xmath56 . the surface @xmath29",
    "is pushed though the lattice by means of @xmath55 nested loops , of which the innermost loop ( at nesting level @xmath28 ) moves @xmath29 along the 1-direction , etc .",
    ", and the outermost loop ( at nesting level @xmath57 ) moves @xmath29 along the @xmath55-direction .",
    "in general the loop at nesting level @xmath58 moves @xmath29 along the @xmath59-direction .",
    "a configuration is given by @xmath60 , where the space @xmath61 describes the edges cut by @xmath29 which are parallel to the @xmath58-direction and consists of @xmath62 entries .",
    "when the loop at nesting level @xmath63 is executed for the last time , the entry in @xmath61 corresponding to the position of the loops at nesting levels @xmath64 must be zero ; otherwise the configuration is rejected .    at each vertex",
    "there are @xmath65 possible local arrangements if the vertex contains a chain end , and @xmath66 arrangements if it does not .",
    "we have implemented the algorithm for @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "it is of course most efficient in low dimensions when the number of entries necessary to describe a configuration is small , and the configurations themselves are strongly constrained by topology .",
    "we were however able to obtain useful results as well for @xmath23 ( see below ) .",
    "we first present our results in two dimensions .",
    ".number @xmath10 of hamiltonian chains of order @xmath0 ( i.e. , consisting of precisely @xmath0 chains ) on a @xmath67 square lattice . [ cols=\">,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     in two dimensions , the @xmath68 for @xmath3 square can be computed from tables  [ tab : walks][tab : circuits ] .",
    "the resulting numerical values are displayed in table  [ tab : adjacent ] .",
    "note that @xmath68 vanishes for odd @xmath69 ( as it does on any bipartite lattice having an odd number of vertices ) .",
    "the values in table  [ tab : circuits ] have been used in @xcite to test that a certain monte carlo algorithm for producing hamiltonian walks did indeed give unbiased results .",
    "physically , on may argue that @xmath68 is proportional to the probability that the two ends of an open polymer ( walk ) join so as to form a ring polymer ( circuit ) .",
    "it is tempting to try similarly to construct from the ratio of @xmath11 and @xmath70 the probability that the conformation of two chains is such that one end point of each are adjacent on the lattice .",
    "unfortunately , this is not possible , since certain two - chains ( more precisely those in which an end point of one chain is adjacent to both end points of the other chain ) can be obtained from more than one one - chain by removing an internal edge in the latter .      the study of phase transitions through the location of partition function zeroes in the complex magnetic field plane was initiated by yang and lee @xcite . in particular , these authors established that for the ising model these zeroes lie on the unit circle in terms of the variable @xmath71 , i.e. , they correspond to purely imaginary values of the field @xmath16 .",
    "the zero closest to the positive real axis is denoted @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the so - called lee - yang edge . at the critical temperature , @xmath74 in the thermodynamic limit , and",
    "its finite - size scaling permits to access a critical exponent .",
    "another possible approach is to study the density of zeroes @xmath75 .",
    "creswick and kim @xcite have shown that at the critical temperature @xmath76 for @xmath77 .",
    "we have studied the zeroes of the partition function ( [ partfunc ] ) in terms of the variable @xmath78 for @xmath3 squares with @xmath79 . for odd @xmath69",
    "there is one trivial zero at @xmath80 ( since @xmath81 ) , and for even @xmath69 the two zeroes closest to @xmath80 form a complex conjugate pair with an imaginary part that tends to zero as @xmath82 . disregarding these `` exceptional '' zeroes , all the remaining zeroes ( for @xmath69 of any parity )",
    "are found to lie on the positive real axis in the complex @xmath83-plane , corresponding to purely imaginary @xmath16 as in the lee - yang theorem .",
    "we now define a finite-@xmath69 approximation to the density of zeroes in the point @xmath84 as @xmath85 , where we have arranged the zeroes of @xmath86 in increasing order @xmath87 .     of partition function zeroes in the variable @xmath78 for the hamiltonian chain problem on @xmath3 squares . ]",

    "one observes a clear crossover near @xmath90 , separating two regimes of power law behaviours .",

    "the naive application of the standard scaling laws @xmath93 ( josephson ) and @xmath94 ( rushbrooke ) , and the results @xmath95 and @xmath96 for the critical @xmath80 system @xcite , leads to @xmath97 , which is clearly off the mark .",
