    "heavy - ion collisions at the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) offer a unique window to study the physics of strongly interacting matter in the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) phase .",
    "an interesting fundamental property of the qgp is its viscosity which , in combination with the expansion rate of the fireball created in the heavy - ion collision , controls its fluidity .",
    "specifically , the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio @xmath0 controls the efficiency with which spatial inhomogeneities and anisotropies of the initial pressure gradients in the fireball are converted to anisotropies in the final collective flow pattern @xcite .",
    "spatial anisotropies in the initial pressure distribution ( related to the initial energy density profile through the equation of state ( eos ) ) are typically characterized in terms of a set of initial eccentricity coefficients @xmath1 ( defined below as fourier coefficients of the initial energy density distribution in the plane transverse to the beam direction ) , while the final flow anisotropies are quantified through coefficients @xmath2 obtained from a fourier decomposition of the final transverse momentum distribution of the emitted hadrons .",
    "large shear viscosity tends to smooth out flow anisotropies and thus suppress the conversion efficiency @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the experimental observation of large flow anisotropies at both rhic @xcite and lhc @xcite indicates that the qgp has very low specific shear viscosity @xmath0 @xcite close to its quantum limit @xcite .",
    "however , since the extraction of @xmath0 from experimental data goes through the conversion efficiency @xmath3 @xcite , it requires , in addition to a measurement of @xmath2 , a knowledge of the initial eccentricity spectrum @xmath1 . as the initial density profile of the fireball created in the collision fluctuates from event to event , so do its initial eccentricity and final flow power spectra , @xmath1 and @xmath2 . at finite impact parameter",
    "the eccentricity spectrum @xmath1 receives contributions from both collision geometry and event - by - event density fluctuations .",
    "in ultra - central collisions , on the other hand , overlap geometry and associated model uncertainties can be largely eliminated as a contributing factor @xcite , focussing attention on the initial spectrum of quantum fluctuations of the strongly interacting quantum fields within the colliding nuclear wave functions .",
    "these are notoriously difficult to compute theoretically , making experimental studies of ultra - central heavy - ion collisions @xcite particularly valuable for improving our quantitative understanding of heavy - ion collision dynamics .",
    "it bears pointing out that a measurement of the final flow power spectrum @xmath2 in ultra - central collisions between equal - size nuclei provides access to both this initial fluctuation spectrum @xcite ( the `` little bang temperature power spectrum '' @xcite ) and the qgp transport coefficients , especially its shear viscosity @xcite . since the specific shear viscosity @xmath0 controls the anisotropic flow response of the expanding liquid to the initial density fluctuations , and neither the specific shear viscosity nor the initial fluctuation spectrum are theoretically known with any precision , a phenomenological analysis of anisotropic flow fluctuations must be sufficiently comprehensive to be able to constrain both simultaneously .",
    "the cms collaborations at the lhc has measured @xcite the anisotropic flow coefficients of charged hadrons in ultra - central pb+pb collisions at @xmath4@xmath5tev , using events from the tail of the charged multiplicity distribution corresponding to @xmath6 centrality .",
    "implementing such tight multiplicity cuts is a challenge for theoretical simulations which have typically much smaller event samples than the experimental measurements . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] of this work , we investigate how different ways of cutting centrality bins can affect the initial - state eccentricity spectrum , and show how to faithfully mimic the experimental centrality selection procedure without the need for evolving astronomically large numbers of initial configurations . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we show the charged hadron particle spectrum and its anisotropic flow coefficients . in sec",
    ".  [ sec4 ] we check the flow factorization ratios in ultra - central pb+pb collisions at the lhc .",
    "we summarize our findings in sec .",
    "experimentally , the ultra - central collision events are defined as those with the highest measured final charged multiplicities . however , in theoretical calculations , using final charged multiplicities to determine the event centrality is numerically very expensive . especially for the narrow 0 - 0.2% centrality bin ,",
    "the numerical effort spent on evolving the remaining 99.8% of the simulated events is wasted .",
    "so we would like to determine ( at least estimate ) the event centrality of each initial profile before evolving them through viscous hydrodynamics .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the next section , we will evolve these initial conditions using viscous hydrodynamics with four different specific shear viscosities , @xmath7 .",
    "for each set of runs we generate 1000 events which is sufficient for a statistical analysis of anisotropic flows .",
    "in fig .  [ fig3 ] we show the transverse momentum spectra of charged hadrons from the mc - glauber and the mc - kln models , hydrodynamically evolved with different @xmath0 values . in ultra - central collisions ,",
    "we find that the shear viscosity has only minor effects on the slope of the charged hadron spectra .",
    "-spectra from the mc - glb and mc - kln models , for different specific shear viscosities as indicated , for pb+pb collisions of 0 - 0.2% centrality at @xmath4@xmath5tev . ]        the mc - glauber initial conditions , which include @xmath8 multiplicity fluctuations , result in slightly flatter ( harder ) charged particle spectra compared to the mc - kln model .",
    "this is because the additional collision - by - collision multiplicity fluctuations increase the bumpiness of the initial density profiles and thereby the initial pressure gradients , which drives the system to develop more radial flow . in table",
    "[ table1 ] we summarize for the eight cases shown in fig .  [ fig3 ] the total charged hadron yields and their mean @xmath9 in 0 - 0.2% ultra - central pb+pb collisions at the lhc .",
    "ideal hydrodynamic simulations result in a larger mean @xmath9 than the viscous ones . due to the lack of viscous entropy production in an ideal fluid",
    ", the system needs to start with a higher peak temperature in order to produce the same final multiplicity .",
    "this results a larger pressure gradient and a @xmath10 longer fireball lifetime , which both lead to the development of stronger radial hydrodynamic flow compared to viscous evolution .",
    "because of the large system size in pb+pb collisions , viscous effects on the fireball expansion are not as pronounced as in smaller collision systems .",
    "a growth of @xmath0 by a factor 2.5 is seen to increase the charged hadron mean @xmath9 by just over 1% .    due to fluctuations , the @xmath9 distributions of individual events",
    "are azimuthally anisotropic even for zero impact parameter .",
    "these anisotropies can be characterized by a series of ( @xmath9 and rapidity dependent ) harmonic flow coefficients @xmath2 and associated flow angles @xmath11 : @xmath12 in the absence of non - flow effects , the `` 2-particle cumulant flow '' @xmath13 is the root mean square of the fluctuating flow @xmath2 in an event ensemble : @xmath14 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we show the charged particle @xmath9-integrated @xmath13 as a function of its harmonic order @xmath15 for both the mc - glauber and the mc - kln models , for 0 - 0.2% ultra - central pb+pb collisions at the lhc .",
    "the mc - glauber initial conditions account for @xmath8 multiplicity fluctuations .",
    "the top and bottom panels compare calculations based on two different approaches for including repulsive 2-nucleon correlations within the nuclei , as described in the figure caption .",
    "the differences between them are seen to be small and within the experimental uncertainties of the measured @xmath9-integrated @xmath13 values . for the @xmath9-differential flow observables discussed below",
    ", the corresponding differences are typically less than the line widths in the plots . in the rest of the paper",
    "we therefore show only calculations based on the more realistic modeling of repulsive nn - correlations described in @xcite .",
    "since the initial eccentricities are small on average ( @xmath16 for mc - kln and @xmath17 for the mc - glauber model ) , non - linear mode couplings @xcite in the higher order ( @xmath18 ) anisotropic flow coefficients @xmath2 , involving the product of multiple @xmath1 @xcite , are suppressed .",
    "we expect a dominantly linear response between the initial @xmath19 and the final @xmath13 . that is driven by a different radial moment @xmath20 of the initial triangularity .",
    "still , the response to the linear superposition of these two dominant drivers is linear @xcite . ]",
    "the conversion efficiency @xmath21 is controlled by the specific shear viscosity of the medium , as seen in fig .",
    "whereas all simulations capture the general trend of increasingly strong suppression of @xmath2 for higher harmonics @xmath15 , which is caused by the non - zero shear viscosity of the medium , both initial condition models fail to quantitatively reproduce the measured @xmath13 spectrum ( @xmath13 as a function of @xmath15 ) .",
    "this statement holds for all the @xmath0 values explored in the simulations .    in the cms data ,",
    "the magnitude of @xmath22 is very close to @xmath23 , which can not be reproduced , neither with mc - glauber nor with mc - kln initial conditions./@xmath23 in ultra - central multiplicity bins of increasing width , from a value @xmath24 at 0 - 0.2% centrality to @xmath25 at 0 - 2.5% centrality , rising to almost 1.5 at 2.5 - 5% centrality @xcite , remains unexplained . ] in hydrodynamic simulations , the conversion efficiency from initial @xmath19 to final @xmath13 is expected to decrease with increasing order @xmath15 @xcite , roughly as @xmath26{\\,\\propto\\,}{-}\\frac{\\eta}{s}n^2 $ ] @xcite . given this expectation and the hydrodynamic results shown in fig .",
    "9 of ref .",
    "@xcite and fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] here , an observed ratio of @xmath27 in ultra - central pb+pb events would require a ratio of the corresponding initial eccentricities @xmath28 , depending on @xmath0 .",
    "this is clearly inconsistent with the predictions from the mc - glauber and mc - kln models shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]b . starting with an initial fluctuation spectrum featuring @xmath29 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]b , for reasonable values of @xmath0 the final @xmath22 from hydrodynamic simulations will always be about 30% larger than @xmath23 .",
    "any theoretical calculation using such initial conditions will therefore overestimate the measured @xmath30 ratio ( at least as long as only shear viscous effect are included ) . within the current hydrodynamic framework , to reproduce a @xmath2 hierarchy similar to the one observed by cms , we need an initial condition model that provides a triangular deformation @xmath31 that is significantly larger than @xmath32 in these ultra - central collisions .        comparing the overall magnitudes of the predicted @xmath13 values with the cms data @xcite in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we find that the data prefer a relatively large specific shear viscosity , for both mc - glauber ( @xmath33 ) and mc - kln ( @xmath34 ) initial conditions . in the mc - glauber case ,",
    "this conclusion differs from that drawn from earlier studies that did not include @xmath8 multiplicity fluctuations .",
    "the increased initial r.m.s .",
    "eccentricities caused by multiplicity fluctuations generate larger r.m.s .",
    "flow anisotropies unless tempered by a larger shear viscosity . since our mc - kln initial conditions currently do not yet include the effects of @xmath8 multiplicity fluctuations , the @xmath0 values required by that model may further increase once this model deficiency is repaired .",
    "next , we study the @xmath9-differential anisotropic flows , @xmath35 . since for ultra - central collisions",
    "the anisotropic flow coefficients are dominated by the fluctuating bumpiness of the initial energy density distributions , the associated flow angles are randomly oriented relative to the ( very small ) impact parameter and correlated with each other only through the density fluctuations and not by overlap geometry . in such fluctuation - dominated situations ,",
    "the flow angles @xmath36 feature particularly strong @xmath9-dependence , oscillating around their @xmath9-averaged values in patterns that strongly fluctuate from event to event @xcite .",
    "different flow observables correspond , in general , to different moments of the probability distribution that governs the event - by - event fluctuations of @xmath2 and @xmath11 .",
    "the specific flow extraction method used in the cms measurements determines the following @xmath9-differential analog of the two - particle cumulant flow of charged hadrons : @xmath37\\rangle }                            { v^\\mathrm{ref}_n\\{2\\}}.\\ ] ] here @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the @xmath9-_integrated _ @xmath15-th order flows obtained from a set of reference particles , taken from a different sub - event ( usually a neighboring rapidity bin ) to eliminate non - flow and self - correlations . as done in the cms analysis , we choose all charged hadrons with transverse momenta between 1 and 3 gev as the reference particles ; in the experiment , this choice optimizes the sensitivity for the measurement of higher order @xmath2 .",
    "since the theoretically calculated momentum distributions are free of non - flow effects and continuous , corresponding to effectively infinite statistics in a single event , self correlations can be neglected , avoiding the need for different sub - events for signal and reference particles .    in figs.[fig5 ] and",
    "[ fig5b ] we show the @xmath9-differential flows @xmath40 at 0 - 0.2% centrality from the mc - glauber and mc - kln models , compared with the cms data .",
    "we find that the direct flow @xmath41 is insensitive to the @xmath0 value used in the simulations .",
    "it flips from negative to positive at @xmath42gev due to global momentum conservation . comparing @xmath43 through @xmath44 with the cms data @xcite , our results using the mc - glauber model with @xmath45",
    "provide a fairly good description , except for the differential elliptic flow @xmath43 which is overestimated by the calculation .",
    "the mc - kln initial conditions with @xmath45 can describe @xmath43 better but underestimate @xmath46 .",
    "although neither model describes all the data equally well , the overall picture seems to favor a qgp shear viscosity in the hydrodynamic simulations that lies at the upper end of the explored range , @xmath47 .",
    "in a single event , hydrodynamic flow effects on two - particle correlations factorize into a product of single - particle flow coefficients @xcite . due to event - by - event flow fluctuations this factorization",
    "is broken in measurements that are based on event averaged observables @xcite .",
    "the factorization breaking effects can be quantified by the `` flow factorization ratios '' @xmath48\\rangle }                  { \\sqrt{\\la v_n^2(p_\\mathrm{t1})\\ra\\la v_n^2(p_\\mathrm{t2})\\ra}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 are the two - particle differential flow coefficients @xcite characterizing the correlation between a  trigger particle \" at transverse momentum @xmath50 and an `` associated particle '' from the same event at @xmath51 .",
    "a deviation of this ratio from one indicates that flow factorization is broken .",
    "in fact , if @xmath52 is larger than one , factorization must be broken by non - flow effects  hydrodynamic flow fluctuations always lead to @xmath53 @xcite .    in figs .",
    "[ fig6 ] - [ fig6c ] we show the flow factorization ratios @xmath54 at 0 - 0.2% centrality , for different values of @xmath0 . for the given ranges of trigger particle transverse momentum ,",
    "these ratios are shown as a function of @xmath55 and compared with the cms measurements @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] reveals that in ultra - central pb+pb collisions the ratio @xmath56 exhibits a large breaking of flow factorization at large @xmath55",
    ". this breaking is not due to the onset of non - flow effects at large @xmath9 as originally suspected @xcite , but due to flow fluctuations caused by initial - state fluctuations and very well described by hydrodynamic evolution of the latter .",
    "we have checked that about half of the factorization breaking arises from the flow angle fluctuations @xcite while the other half comes from fluctuations of the magnitudes the anisotropic flows .",
    "the figure shows that @xmath0 affects the ratio @xmath56 non - monotonically , and we found that this is associated with a change in the relative contribution of @xmath2 and @xmath11 fluctuations to the breaking of flow factorization .",
    "this may indicate a non - trivial interplay of viscous damping effects on the fluctuations in flow magnitude and flow angle .",
    "indeed , our studies showed that increasing the shear viscosity suppresses @xmath2 fluctuations but strengthens flow - angle correlations @xcite .    comparing the upper panels with the lower ones in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , we find that , irrespective of the choice of @xmath0 , the ratio @xmath56 deviates from 1 more strongly when we use mc - kln initial conditions than for mc - glauber profiles . similar statements , but with the opposite sign , hold for @xmath57 and @xmath58 , shown in figs .  [ fig6b ] and [ fig6c ] : in their case ,",
    "the factorization breaking effects are weaker for mc - kln initial conditions than for mc - glauber ones , again with little sensitivity to @xmath0 .",
    "this implies that @xmath52 actually responds more strongly to changes in the initial fluctuation spectrum than to variations of the shear viscosity .",
    "the cms @xmath59 factorization breaking data in ultra - central collisions , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , favor mc - glauber - like initial - state fluctuations over the mc - kln ones , but figs .",
    "[ fig6b ] and [ fig6c ] lead to the opposite conclusion : while the flow factorization breaking effects for triangular ( @xmath57 ) and quadrangular flow ( @xmath58 ) are smaller than for elliptic flow ( @xmath60 , and therefore harder to measure , they seem to be slightly better described by hydrodynamics with mc - kln initial conditions than for mc - glauber initial profiles . while the sensitivity to @xmath0 is small ,",
    "@xmath57 and @xmath58 appear to give a slight preference to larger @xmath0 values , consistent with the qualitative conclusion drawn in the preceding section from the overall trend of the @xmath2 power spectrum .    in summary ,",
    "flow factorization breaking effects appear to open a window on the initial fluctuation spectrum that is only slightly blurred by uncertainties in the shear viscosity during the dynamical evolution from initial to final state .",
    "this observable therefore complements the @xmath15-dependence of the magnitudes of the @xmath9-integrated flow coefficients @xmath13 for which shear viscosity effects dominate over variations in the initial - state fluctuation spectrum .",
    "while neither the mc - glauber nor the mc - kln initial fluctuation spectrum allows to quantitatively reproduce all available data simultaneously , this observation suggests that , by using the full complement of experimentally accessible flow and fluctuation observables , it will in the future be possible to identify the correct initial - state model _ and , at the same time , _ quantify the quark - gluon plasma transport properties .",
    "in this paper , we presented anisotropic flow studies for 0 - 0.2% ultra - central pb+pb collisions at the lhc , using the mc - glauber and the mc - kln initial condition models and evolving the system hydrodynamically with @xmath61 , and @xmath62 . in the mc - glauber model ,",
    "we implement multiplicity fluctuations in the initial state , which boost the initial eccentricities @xmath19 for @xmath63 by 15 - 45% .",
    "a comparison with cms data reveals that both mc - glauber and mc - kln models fail to reproduce the @xmath9-integrated @xmath2 hierarchy , especially the @xmath64 ratio .",
    "further comparisons with the @xmath9-differential @xmath2 tend to favor a relatively large average value of @xmath65 for the medium .",
    "we found a large breaking of flow factorization for the elliptic flow coefficient in ultra - central collisions .",
    "both the fluctuations of the flow magnitude and of the flow angle are important contributors to this breaking .",
    "although our simulations can not fully reproduce the measured @xmath2 spectrum , calculations of the @xmath52 agree overall quite well with the cms measurements .",
    "all qualitative features and trends of the cms data are correctly reproduced by the hydrodynamic model .",
    "consistent with the conclusion from the @xmath2 comparison , the cms @xmath52 data again slightly favor @xmath66 over smaller values of the average specific shear viscosity during the dynamical evolution .",

    "<S> we find that both the monte carlo glauber ( mc - glb ) and monte carlo kharzeev - levin - nardi ( mc - kln ) models produce initial fluctuation spectra that are incompatible with the measured final anisotropic flow power spectrum , for any choice of the specific shear viscosity . in spite of this failure </S>",
    "<S> , we show that the hydrodynamic model can qualitatively explain , in terms of event - by - event fluctuations of the anisotropic flow coefficients and flow angles , the breaking of flow factorization for elliptic , triangular and quadrangular flow measured by the cms experiment . for elliptic flow </S>",
    "<S> , this factorization breaking is large in ultra - central collisions . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the bulk of the experimentally observed flow factorization breaking effects are qualitatively explained by hydrodynamic evolution of initial - state fluctuations , but that their quantitative description requires a better understanding of the initial fluctuation spectrum . </S>"
