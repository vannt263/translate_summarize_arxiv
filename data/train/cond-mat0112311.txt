    "in recent years many experiments @xcite , simulations @xcite and theoretical approaches @xcite have been devoted to the study of propagation of forces through granular aggregates .",
    "one of the interesting features that rise from these studies is the formation of strong inhomogeneities in the spatial distribution of contact forces ( formation of force chains ) , where a small fraction of the grains carries most of the total force ( see fig.[f.chains ] ) .",
    "these chains typically extend on space scales much larger than the grain dimensions and are associated with broad stress distributions @xcite .",
    "moreover , simulations and experiments show strong rearrangements of the force - chains under small changes in the compression axes suggesting a ` fragile ' behavior associated with the force chain structure @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we show that the formation of force chains , the broadening of the force distribution and the ` fragile ' behavior are direct consequences of the topological disorder in the granular packing structure .    in order to study the static stress distribution",
    ", we use a scalar model where the force balance is considered in the vertical direction only and torques are neglected .",
    "this approach is similar to several theoretical works already proposed in the literature @xcite and in particular to the well known @xmath0 model @xcite . in our model",
    "however , we explicitly consider a _",
    "disordered _ arrangements of grains ( instead of placing the grains on a regular array and introducing randomness in the transmission term , as for the @xmath0 model ) .",
    "this leads to strong differences and some important , novel consequences ( see also [ a1 ] ) .",
    "the complete description of a granular structure in 2 and 3 dimensions requires in general the information about the positions , sizes and shapes of all the grains .",
    "but , to describe the propagation of the weight ( vertical forces ) , one can use only the topological information about the neighbors and the contacts among grains combined with the knowledge about the direction and intensity of the transmission among neighboring grains ( see fig.[f.1 ] ) .    to univocally define the neighboring structure we use the ` navigation map ' @xcite , which consists in the construction of space - filling cellular structure with generalized vorono @xcite cells where the faces are made by the set of points equidistant to the surfaces of the grains . from this construction",
    "two grains are first neighbors if they share a common face .",
    "the neighboring structure is topologically defined by the matrix @xmath1 : @xmath2 which is symmetric with zeros on the diagonal .",
    "this matrix describes the neighboring structure of the packing .",
    "but , by construction , two neighboring grains @xmath3 ( with @xmath4 ) might not be in contact , whereas two grains which are in contact are surely neighbors .",
    "since the force propagates only through grains which are in contact , it follows that to study the force - propagation one must also take into account the topological structure of the inter - grain contacts ( dodds network ) @xcite .",
    "this can be done by defining the ` kissing ' matrix @xmath5 : @xmath6 ( with @xmath7 , and @xmath8 ) . the number of grains which are in contact ( ` kiss ' ) with a given grain @xmath9 is @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the total number of grains in the system .",
    "an upper bound on the number of adjacent grains @xmath12 , comes from geometrical considerations : it is indeed known that no more that 6 equal disks and no more than 12 equal spheres can stay in touch with a central one ( kissing numbers ) @xcite . on the other hand , when the sizes can fluctuate and the grains can assume different shapes",
    ", these numbers might change dramatically .",
    "but , for grain sizes distributed in a finite range , one can always find an upper bound on the number of neighbors in contact with a given grain .",
    "for instance , when the grain sizes are homogeneous and the shapes isotropic , these upper bounds are very close to the above values of 6 and 12 , in 2 and 3 dimensions respectively . a lower bound on @xmath12 is given by the mechanical stability condition , as we will see shortly .",
    "we study the propagation of the vertical component of the forces ( weights ) from grain to grain .",
    "this is a conservative system : the total weight on the bottom of the stack is equal to vertical force applied on the top plus the proper weights of the grains in the stack ( we neglect the presence of walls that we put at the infinite ) .",
    "we describe the propagation of the vertical component of the forces inside the granular structure in term of following equation : @xmath13 with @xmath14 being the vertical force applied at the barycenter of grain `` @xmath9 '' .",
    "the quantities @xmath15 are the elements of the _ weight transmission matrix _ @xmath16 ; they are associated with the kissing matrix through the relation @xmath17 , where the quantities @xmath18 take values between 0 and 1 .",
    "these quantities are asymmetric : if @xmath19 then @xmath20 ( but not vice versa ) , giving in this way the orientation of the force network .",
    "the symbol @xmath21 indicates the proper weight of grain @xmath9 with an exception for the top layer of the granular stack where one can apply an external force . in this case",
    ", the symbol @xmath21 indicates the proper weight of grain @xmath9 plus the portion of external force acting on this grain .",
    "equation [ w ] is a rather general expression : it assumes only that -as it is- the vertical force propagates only through grains which are in contact .",
    "equation [ w ] can also take into account non - linear effects if one supposes that the quantities @xmath15 are dependent on the force @xmath14 .",
    "however , in eq.[w ] the vectorial nature of the forces and the tensorial nature of the stresses have been completely neglected .",
    "nevertheless , we will show that the scalar description given by eq.[w ] is very powerful and can take into account complex phenomena like the formation of force chains and arches or the fragility .    in eq.[w ] the whole information about the granular packing is contained in the weight transmission matrix @xmath22 which must therefore be consistent with a real connection network in a physically - realizable granular packing .",
    "this gives some constraints on @xmath23 .",
    "the conservation of the total weight implies that the sum over each column of the matrix @xmath16 must be equal to 1 , i.e. @xmath24    the stability under gravity imposes that each grain must lay on at least 3 other grains in 3 dimensions or 2 grains in two dimensions , therefore @xmath25 with @xmath26 the dimensionality of the space and @xmath27 the step function ( @xmath28 when @xmath29 @xmath30 when @xmath31 ) .",
    "the grain @xmath9 receives the vertical force from a number @xmath32 of neighbors , and shares its total weight @xmath14 through @xmath33 neighbors .",
    "clearly , @xmath34 is the number of grains adjacent to @xmath9 and , from the stability condition ( eq.[wcons2 ] ) , it must be : @xmath35 , giving therefore a lower bound on this quantity .",
    "we now seek for solutions of eq.[w ] .",
    "let first consider the special case where the elements @xmath36 of the weight transmission matrix depend on the granular packing structure only ( i.e. the @xmath36 do nt depend on @xmath37 ) . in this case eq.[w ]",
    "is a linear equation , and its solution can be written straightforwardly .",
    "indeed , an equivalent way to write eq.[w ] , is : @xmath38 with @xmath39 the kroneker s delta .",
    "when the @xmath15 are independent of @xmath37 , eq.[wlin ] is a set of @xmath11 linear equations with @xmath11 unknowns .",
    "if the determinant of @xmath40 is different from zero , this system will admit a unique solution .",
    "physically this condition corresponds to impose that in the force network there are no closed oriented rings . in terms of the elements of the force transmission matrix",
    "this implies that , for any given @xmath9 , and for any arbitrarily chosen set of sites indexes @xmath41 , it must hold @xmath42    note that this condition implies @xmath43 for any @xmath44 .",
    "indeed it is impossible to make a non - intersecting path with a length larger than the number of grains in the system .    equation [ wlin ] can be also written in a vectorial notation@xmath45 and , when the determinant of @xmath40 is different from zero , its solution is @xmath46    although eq.[wmatsol ] is formally trivial , its solution can not be easily pursued analytically in the general case and it might become numerically untreatable for large samples .",
    "therefore , in the following we develop an alternative approach which considers the system as structured into a set of layers and makes possible to solve eq.[w ] recursively .",
    "any granular packing can be formally reduced into a stacking of layers where the vertical force components are transmitted downward from layer to layer .",
    "the elements of these layers can be single grains or sets of grains that collectively behave as a single element that receives the weight from the layer above and transmits it to the layer below .    in order to construct such a layered system ,",
    "let first label all the grains at the top of the stacking ( on which -eventually- the external load is applied ) as belonging to the layer zero ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "let also consider as belonging to @xmath47 all the grains which transmit some weight to grains already labelled as belonging to @xmath47 .",
    "once defined @xmath47 , the first layer ( @xmath48 ) is made by the set of grains which are neighbors of grains in @xmath47 and do nt belong to @xmath47 .",
    "moreover , are belonging to @xmath48 all the grains which are not yet classified in @xmath47 and that transmit some force to grains already classified in @xmath48 .",
    "analogously , in general , the layer @xmath49 is constituted of grains ( @xmath9 ) that are neighbors of grains ( @xmath50 ) in layer @xmath51 and do nt belong to any already classified layer ( @xmath52 if @xmath53 with @xmath54 , and if exists at least one @xmath55 such that @xmath4 ) . in addition , to @xmath56 belong all the non - classified grains which transmit some force to grains which have been already classified in @xmath56 ( @xmath52 if @xmath53 with @xmath54 , and if exists at least one @xmath57 such that @xmath58 ) .    in the system of layers that we have now constructed we have two kinds of grains : * ( i )",
    "* some grains receive the weight from the layer above only , and transmit it only to the layer below ; * ( ii ) * other grains receive or transmit weight to grains in the same layer .",
    "we want to reduce the packing to a set of ` elements ' where every element @xmath59 ( which belongs to some layer , @xmath60 ) receives the weight from elements ( @xmath50 ) in layer above ( @xmath55 ) and transmits the weight to elements @xmath61 in the layer below ( @xmath62 ) . to this purpose",
    "we identify as single _",
    "elements _ of the layered structure the grains of type * ( i ) * , and the clusters of grains of type * ( ii)*.    a schematic graphical representation of the procedure to identify the granular layers and their elements is given in figure [ f.layers ] .",
    "in the layered system that we have constructed in the previous section the weight is transmitted layer by layer from the top of the staking ( layer @xmath47 , which receives the external load ) down to the bottom layer @xmath63 ( layer at distance @xmath64 from the top one ) .    in analogy with eq.[w ] , it follows that the weight on a given element in layer @xmath49 ( @xmath65 ) is given in terms of the weights of the elements on the layer above @xmath51 through the following equation @xmath66 note that in this case the indices ` @xmath9 ' and ` @xmath50 ' refer to _ elements _ of the packing instead of _ grains_. the definition of @xmath36 is identical to the one given before , but it refers to a granular structure which has been reduced to a system of elements disposed into layers which make an ssi network @xcite ( see fig.[f.layers]c ) .",
    "the forces on the top layer are known : @xmath67 ( for @xmath68 ) .",
    "therefore , by using recursively eq.[wl - l ] , one can calculate step by step the forces @xmath14 from the first layer to the bottom .",
    "this recursive strategy can be applied to solve eq.[wl - l ] even in the non - linear case , with the only assumption that the quantities @xmath15 must depend only on the forces applied from the layers above .",
    "in experiments and computer simulations of force propagation through granular matter an important fact is observed : only a small part of grains carries the most part of the weight .",
    "the force propagates through ` chains ' , and these chains generate ` arches ' .",
    "the formation of these chains implies that there are some region of the packing where the weight tends to _ concentrate in _ , and there are other regions where the weight tends to _ diffuse out_.    in order to understand this mechanism in term of our layered structure , let us consider the shape of these layers . in a crystalline - ordered packing ( an fcc stacking of balls , for instance )",
    "the layers are made of sets of elements disposed on flat surfaces which are parallel to each other ( or straight lines in 2d packings ) .",
    "when disorder is introduced , these surfaces start to bend and become rough .",
    "the global curvature will rest zero , but locally ` valleys ' and ` mountains ' will make a dimpled landscape .",
    "these rough surfaces are staked one upon the other and therefore the roughening of neighboring layers must be _ similar _ and the local curvature is expected to be preserved for a few layers ( see fig.[f.rough ] )    any given element of the layered packing receives the weight from the elements in the layer above and distributes it among the neighbors in the layer below . because of the disorder , some elements have more neighbors in the layer above than others . clearly , if we had no structural correlation among the layers , we expect that the elements that receive the weight from more elements will result -in average- with a larger weight than the others with fewer neighbors above .",
    "this mechanism would be amplified layer after layer if this property of abundance / deficiency of neighbors would locally propagate through the layers .",
    "this is indeed the case in granular packings where , for geometrical reasons , the roughening of the layers must be persistent through a certain number of layers .",
    "the persistence length is strictly related with the average chain length and gives the measure of the amplification effect . in particular , we have that elements in ` valleys ' tend to dissipate the force ( _ defocalizing effect _ ) by propagating it to a larger number of neighbors with respect to the number from which they receive it . whereas , elements in the ` mountains ' tend to concentrate the weight ( _ focalizing effect _ ) by transmitting the force to a smaller number of elements with respect to the number from which they receive it ( see fig.[f.rough ] ) .",
    "the formation of arches in an ` hands - on ' simple experiment @xcite made with photoelastic material between two polarizing filters , is shown in fig.[f.chains ] .",
    "the result of a computer simulation of weight propagation trough an ssi structure is shown in fig.[f.simul ] @xcite .",
    "as one can see , most of the stress propagates through _ force - chains _ which make _ arches _ by self - interconnecting into an intricate network .",
    "the readjustment of a few grains or a changement in the point or direction of the applied force strongly affects the layered structure .",
    "indeed , a local changement modifies locally the composition and curvature of the layer .",
    "this modification propagates through the whole system by changing the roughening and the set of grains in the layers .",
    "the final effect is a modification in the whole structure of the force - chain network .",
    "this long - range propagation associated with the focalizing / defocalizing effects , is responsible for some of the critical effects in granular matter and it is at the origin of the fragility in these systems .",
    "in this section we calculate analytically , in the linear case , the probability distribution for the vertical force components . the probability @xmath69 to find a force @xmath70 at the site @xmath71",
    "is related to the probability that the grains at sites @xmath50 have weights @xmath37 , and that the propagation of these weights through the contact matrix @xmath72 produces exactly @xmath70 , which formally writes ( from eq.[w ] ) : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the dirac delta function and the quantity @xmath75 is the probability of a given force transmission matrix @xmath22 .",
    "let us introduce the fourier transform of @xmath76 and its inverse @xmath77with @xmath78 a constant which takes into account the normalization to 1 . by using this transformation , eq.[pw ]",
    "becomes @xmath79 where the dirac delta function has been written as @xmath80 equation [ pw1 ] can be re - written as : @xmath81 where the integral over the @xmath82 s is restricted only to the set @xmath83 of elements which are adjacent to the element @xmath71 and are transmitting the force to this element ( i.e. @xmath84 ) .",
    "the integration over @xmath37 yields    @xmath85    from eq.[fp ] , its fourier transform is @xmath86 the integration over @xmath70 gives finally @xmath87    if we assume that @xmath75 factorizes : @xmath88 eq.[pw5 ] reduces to @xmath89",
    "when the force propagates downward in a layered system , an element in a layer @xmath90 will receive the weight only from a set of elements in the layer above ( @xmath91 ) and will transmit it to a set of elements in the layer below ( @xmath92 ) . let us suppose that the probability distribution of the force depends only on the layer number @xmath90 .",
    "this allows to substitute into eq.[pw6 ] the quantity @xmath93 with @xmath94 @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the proper weight of the elements in layer @xmath90 .    supposing that the load on a given element in the layer @xmath97 is uniformly distributed among the @xmath98 neighbors in the layer @xmath90 , the term @xmath99 becomes : @xmath100 .",
    "this simplifies eq.[pw7l ] to @xmath101^{n^-_{\\alpha } }   \\;\\;\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath102 is the number of grains in layer @xmath91 from which an element in layer @xmath90 receives the force .",
    "one can directly verify that eq.[pw8l ] is satisfied by choosing @xmath103 in the form @xmath104 with @xmath105 and @xmath106 arbitrary numbers and @xmath107 for @xmath108 or @xmath109 arbitrary for @xmath110 .",
    "the other parameters in eq.[pw10l ] are : @xmath111 and @xmath112    expression [ pw10l ] might seem complicated , but it is a broadly studied expression : it is the fourier transform of a symmetric lvy - kintchine stable distribution @xcite .",
    "it describes a probability distribution which is peaked around the value @xmath113 .",
    "it has a width proportional to @xmath114 , and it is asymmetric with a skewness proportional to @xmath115 $ ] ( @xmath109 positive distribution skewed to the right , @xmath109 negative distribution skewed to the left ) . the parameter @xmath116 $ ] is called characteristic exponent . for instance , when @xmath117 the distribution is a gaussian , whereas for @xmath108 and @xmath118 it is a lorentzian .",
    "these distributions are stable with respect to the sum of a set of stochastic variables and therefore appear naturally in the context of the central limit theorem .",
    "for @xmath119 they have tails which decrease as power laws with exponents that tend to @xmath120 for very large deviations . in general the moment of order @xmath121",
    "becomes infinite when @xmath122 , it turns out therefore that the variance is only defined when @xmath117 , whereas the average is defined for @xmath123 .    from eqs.[pw10l ] , [ sigma ] and [ pwc ] two opposite scenarios come naturally out depending on the values of the parameters @xmath124 and @xmath125 through the layered structure .",
    "let first consider the case where @xmath126 ( the elements receive the weight from a number of elements which is _ larger _ than the number of elements to which the force is transmitted ) . from eqs .",
    "[ sigma ] and [ pwc ] it follows that in this case the sum @xmath113 tends to diverge with @xmath90 and consequently the value of @xmath127 tends to infinite .",
    "this is the mathematical description of the _ formation of a force chain _ where , layer after layer the force in the chain increases ( _ focalization effect _ ) with an associated broadening in the force distribution which becomes a power law with average and spread that tend to infinite .",
    "the opposite scenario corresponds to the case when @xmath128 ( the elements receive the weight from a number of elements which is _ smaller _ than the number of elements to which the force is transmitted ) . in this case , eqs .",
    "[ sigma ] and [ pwc ] yield to a force - distribution which has @xmath129 and concentrates around the proper weight of the elements .",
    "the elements receive zero weight from above and diffuse their weights outward from this region ( _ defocalizing effect _ ) .",
    "these are the uncharged grains that stay in the regions below the arches .",
    "we have presented a study of the weight propagation through a granular staking which is based on a realistic geometrical - topological description of the packing structure . the guiding idea was to analyze the disordered packing as structured in _",
    "layers _ made of _ elements _ which receive the weight from the layer above and transmit it to the layer below .",
    "this system is an ssi packing and the equation for the vertical forces can be solved recursively .",
    "we show that the appearance of inhomogeneous force distributions into networks of _ force - chains _ and _ arches _ are naturally found as a geometrical consequence of the rough shape of the layers in disordered packings .",
    "the force is _ focalized _ into chains or diffused out and _ defocalized _ depending on the local curvature of the layered structure .",
    "strong changements in the force - network structure can be generated by small rearrangements in the packing which are amplified by the geometrical correlations through the layered system .",
    "this leads to an intrinsic fragile behavior of these systems .",
    "we find a class of solutions for the distribution of forces which falls in the class of lvy - kintchine stable distributions .",
    "the focalizing / defocalizing effects are analytically retrieved for these solutions and associated with the local topological properties ( @xmath130 , @xmath131 ) of the layered structure .",
    "many thanks to mario nicodemi for fruitful discussions .",
    "acknowledges many discussions with n. rivier and c. oguey .",
    "in the literature several models have been presented for the force propagation in granular matter .",
    "most of these models assume that the granular packing is stacked in an ordered lattice - like structure and the disorder is introduced by supposing an inhomogeneous propagation of the force among neighboring grains .",
    "this is -for instance- the working - framework of the well - known q - model @xcite",
    ". it might be important to point out that equation [ w ] becomes identical to the one of the q - model if :    * the equation is linear ( @xmath36 independent on @xmath37 ) ; * the granular packing is structured in layers ; * the force propagates only downward from layer to layer ; * the constraint given by eq.[wcons2 ] is satisfied with the equality .    therefore , the approach presented in this paper is applicable to the q - model , but not vice versa .",
    "in particular , in the framework of the q - model , the layer roughening ( which is the mechanism that leads us to the formation of force chains and arches ) is associated with the probability that some neighboring grains transmit no force , whereas the geometrical correlations between successive layers must be taken into account by imposing some ` propagation ' of these broken bonds . these are indeed the mechanisms , proposed in the literature , which allow , within the framework of a lattice - based models ( as the q - model ) , to obtain the formation of arches and critical force distributions @xcite . in our approach",
