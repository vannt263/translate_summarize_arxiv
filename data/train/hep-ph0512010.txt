    "thanks to the worldwide collaborative endeavor for @xmath0 factories and neutrino experiments , our understanding of the flavor mixing phenomena in quark sector as well as in lepton sector has been dramatically improved over the past few years .",
    "even though discoveries of neutrino oscillations in solar , atmospheric and reactor experiments gave a robust evidence for the existence of non - zero neutrino masses , we do not yet understand mechanisms of how to generate the masses of neutrinos and why those masses are so small .",
    "the most attractive proposal to explain the smallness of neutrino masses is the seesaw mechanism @xcite in which super - heavy singlet particles are introduced .",
    "one of the virtues of the seesaw mechanism is to provide us with an elegant way to achieve the observed baryon asymmetry in our universe via the related leptogenesis @xcite .",
    "however , the typical seesaw scale is of order @xmath9 gev , which makes it impossible to probe the seesaw mechanism at collider experiments in a foreseeable future .",
    "moreover , the leptogenesis at such a high energy scale meets a serious problem , the so - called gravitino problem , when it realizes in supersymmetric extensions of the standard model .",
    "thus , it may be quite desirable to achieve the seesaw mechanism as well as the leptogenesis at a rather low energy scale . in these regards , scenarios of the resonant leptogenesis , in which singlet neutrinos with masses of order @xmath10 tev are introduced ,",
    "have been recently proposed @xcite interestingly enough , the amplitudes of some flavor violating processes , which are highly suppressed in usual seesaw models with super - heavy singlet neutrinos , may be enhanced with such low scale singlet neutrinos .",
    "thus , it is worthwhile to examine how we can probe a seesaw model with low scale singlet neutrinos at collider experiments and to find some experimental evidence for the seesaw model via probe of lepton flavor violating processes .    in this paper , within the context of a low scale seesaw model based on @xmath11 @xcite , we study quark and lepton flavor violating ( qlfv ) rare decay processes such as @xmath1 and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 denote heavy and light charged leptons , respectively . after the quark flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) @xmath15 had been discovered in @xmath0 factories @xcite , it has been naturally expected that the next generation experiments could probe well the lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) processes @xcite , which may eventually uncover the mechanism for the generation of small neutrino masses and the leptogenesis as well .",
    "therefore , the precise predictions for those processes based on well motivated scenarios are very useful to find out if such scenarios can describe the nature correctly or not . here",
    "we focus on the seesaw model motivated by the resonant leptogenesis scenario with two almost degenerate singlet neutrinos at tev scale . in the context of the seesaw mechanism ,",
    "lowering the singlet mass scale leads to an undesirable enhancement of the light neutrino masses unless the dirac neutrino couplings are guaranteed to be naturally small .",
    "however , as shown in @xcite , despite of the low mass scale of singlet majorana neutrinos we can obtain light neutrino mass spectrum consistent with the current neutrino data by tuning the phase of the yukawa - dirac mass terms so that the two degenerate singlets contribute to the low energy effective majorana mass terms destructively and the lepton number is approximately conserved .",
    "interestingly enough , in such a scenario the sizable lfv processes and the suppression of the lepton number violation required in the effective majorana mass for light neutrinos may coexist . we will show that the amplitudes of quark fcnc and lfv processes can be enhanced by considering some specific structure of yukawa - dirac and singlet majorana mass matrices which are required to achieve the resonant leptpogenesis .",
    "we will obtain rather stringent constraints on qlfv processes by taking the constraints arisen from the invisible decay of @xmath7 boson , neutrino mass - squared differences and lepton flavor mixings measured at neutrino experiments and the experimental constraints of lfv processes such as @xmath16 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we present the lepton flavor mixings of seesaw models with arbitrary number of singlet majorana neutrinos .",
    "the analytical expressions for the branching fractions of the qlfv rare @xmath0 decays are presented and the model independent bound on the branching fractions is obtained . in section 3 ,",
    "we study the low mass scale scenarios for singlet neutrinos and build the models in which the quark fcnc and lfv processes are enhanced .",
    "we give the predictions for the qlfv processes by taking into account the various constraints . in section 4 ,",
    "we summarize the results .",
    "the lepton favor mixings of seesaw model are described in detail in refs .",
