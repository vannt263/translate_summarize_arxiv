    "parameter estimation is a widely used process in modeling of dynamic systems , where systems exhibit unknown but desired dynamics . in real world applications , many dynamical systems ,",
    "including systems which belong to the fields of biology , chemistry , physics , engineering and many more @xcite , may ( and mostly do ) have partial or all unknown parameters .",
    "knowledge about the parameters of the underlying dynamics is the prerequisite to analyze , control , and predict their characteristic behaviors .",
    "hence , this topic has drawn great attention in various areas due to its theoretical and practical significance .",
    "while estimating unknown parameters in dynamic systems could be a daunting task , study of parameter estimation , especially in nonlinear systems that exhibit time - varying behavior , remains an open field of research . in this area ,",
    "an important effort is the application of adaptive control and synchronization methodologies by designing an adaptive controller to estimate the uncertainties as well as minimize the synchronization error @xcite .",
    "however , adaptive control based methodologies highly depend on the assumption that parameters are constant or slowly time - varying . in practice",
    ", the time - varying feature of system parameters can have significant impact on the performance of the underlying systems @xcite , and canot be underestimated .    on the other hand , especially with the improvements in microprocessors and increased computational capabilities , receding horizon control ( rhc ) based methodologies gained significant momentum in the last two decades @xcite .",
    "rhc is a formulation which is widely used to obtain an optimal feedback control law by minimizing the desired performance index for a given finite horizon .",
    "the performance index of a receding - horizon control problem has a moving initial time and a moving terminal time , and the time interval of the performance index is finite . since the time interval of the performance index is finite , the optimal feedback law can be determined even for a system that is not stabilizable .",
    "one advantage of receding horizon optimal control formulation is that it can deal with a broader class of control objectives other than asymptotic stabilization .",
    "moreover , nonlinear receding horizon control ( nrhc ) has made a significant impact on industrial controls and is being increasingly applied in process controls @xcite .",
    "various advantages are known for nrhc , including the ability to handle time - varying and nonlinear systems , input / output constraints and plant / parameter related uncertainty .",
    "there are many existing valuable works related to the use of different methodologies in nonlinear systems for parameter estimation procedures .",
    "one of the conducted studies concentrates on parameter identification using differential evolution algorithms @xcite , while another study provides a bio - geography based parameter estimation for nonlinear systems @xcite .",
    "other important studies include kalman filtering based parameter estimation @xcite , adaptive estimation with invariant manifolds @xcite , estimation through identical or non - identical structures @xcite , chaotic ant - swarm models @xcite , time series approach @xcite , via particle swarm optimization @xcite , recursive identification via incremental estimation @xcite .",
    "the main goal in this approach remains as the parameter estimation of nonlinear time varying systems , but the fundamental difference of this study with respect to the existing literature is that in this paper it is desired to demonstrate the connection ( and applicability ) of real - time nonlinear receding horizon control algorithms as an effective parameter estimation procedure .",
    "here , we provide a framework which is able to cope with nonlinear time - varying systems . for this purpose ,",
    "the estimation procedure is reduced to a family of finite horizon optimization problems .",
    "in addition , a non - iterative optimization algorithm is employed to avoid high computational complexity and large data storage . with this formulation",
    ", we also provide the closed - loop asymptotic stability guarantees of the synchronization error system . obtained results from two example problems",
    "demonstrate the applicability of the real - time nrhc as a parameter estimation routine on the nonlinear systems with unknown time - varying parameters .",
    "this approach also serves as a minimization routine the synchronization errors , as well .",
    "the paper is organized as the following : problem formulation is defined in section-[sec : prob_formulation ] . in section-[sec : backward_sweep ] , backward - sweep method is iterated and stability proof is provided . in section-[sec : results ] , we discuss the findings of such approach , and with the conclusions section , we finalize the paper .",
    "for this study , we consider the following nonlinear system with unknown time - varying parameters : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the state vector , @xmath2 is the the linear coefficient matrix and @xmath3 is the nonlinear part of system in .",
    "@xmath4 is a known function vector and @xmath5 denotes the unknown time - varying parameters .    in order to estimate the unknown parameters ,",

    "is considered as the drive system and system in eq .",
    "is considered as the response system .",
    "the synchronization error between the drive and the response system becomes an important part of this analysis , and in this study it is defined as @xmath14 with this definition , it is possible to define the _ synchronization error system _ as @xmath15 where the estimation error is denoted by @xmath16    from this point on , for the estimation of unknown time - varying parameters , we propose and establish a finite horizon cost function which is associated with the synchronization error and the estimated parameter , as :    @xmath17{\\rm d}\\tau,\\ ] ]    where weighting matrices @xmath18 and @xmath19 . with the construction of the synchronization cost function , as given in eq . , the estimation problem is converted into a parameter optimization procedure , where the unknown parameter(s ) can be estimated through this process . for this purpose",

    "if @xmath32 is a smooth function of time @xmath20 , the solution of @xmath33 can be tracked with respect to time . in this formulation ,",
    "the ordinary differential equation of @xmath34 can be solved numerically , in real - time , without any need of an iterative optimization routine . however , numerical errors associated with the solution may accumulate as the integration proceeds in practice , and therefore some correction techniques are required to correct such errors in the solution . to address this problem ,",
