    "the majority of spiral galaxies have a warped plane , as has been revealed in the neutral gas extended component , through hi-21 cm observations ( e.g. bosma 1981 , briggs 1990 ) , and in a lesser extent through optical observations ( sanchez - saavedra et al . 1990 ,",
    "reshetnikov & combes 1998 ) .",
    "this dynamical feature raises the problem of its origin and maintenance , and the numerous mechanisms that have been proposed and explored have not yet given a definitive and satisfactory answer ( e.g. the review by binney 1992 ) .",
    "differential precession should be very quick to wrap up any warp perturbation even in the outer parts of the galaxies ( kahn & woltjer 1959 ) , unless the potential is nearly spherical ( tubbs & sanders 1979 ) . but",
    "most warps are observed while the disk is still a significant part of the potential , which can not therfore be spherical .",
    "it has been shown that coherent bending modes can not be sustained , since the oscillations spectrum is continuous , for realistic disks that have no sharp edges ( hunter & toomre 1969 ) .",
    "models then tried to consider a non - spherical dark halo , misaligned with the inner visible disk of the galaxy ( sparke 1984 , sparke & casertano 1988 , dubinski & kuijken 1995 ) .",
    "however , these structures can only be transient , since the inner disk is bound to align with the dark halo ( new et al .",
    "1998 , binney et al . 1998 ) . alternatively",
    ", the warp could be the consequence of continuous accretion of gas with a slewed angular momentum , due to cosmic infall , as suggested by ostriker & binney ( 1989 ) and binney ( 1992 ) .",
    "it is not excluded either that a large part of warps are due to interactions or mergers : the prototypical warped galaxy ngc 5907 ( sancisi 1976 ) that was long thought isolated , might have experienced a minor merger recently ( lequeux et al .",
    "1998 ) , and is currently interacting with two dwarf companions ( shang et al .",
    "1998 ) .    to progress about the puzzle of the origin of warps , it is important to have a sample of optically strongly warped galaxies , to perform new observations and statistical studies .",
    "recently , we have presented a survey of optical warps in a sample of 540 galaxies , about 5 times larger than the previous samples ( reshetnikov & combes 1998 ) .",
    "the galaxies were selected from the flat galaxy catalogue of karachentsev et al .",
    "( 1993 ) ( fgc ) and we studied their optical images extracted from the digitized sky surveys .",
    "we identified three classes of galaxies , those without observable warps ( 30% ) , and those with u - shaped ( 37% ) and s - shaped ( 33% ) warps .",
    "we have considered the artefacts due to projection effects , that could be severe in nearly edge - on galaxies , when there are spiral arms or @xmath0 perturbations . through numerical simulations , it was found that the u - shape are more affected by projection effects , but that no more than 15% of s - shape warps could be geometrical artefacts . on the other hand",
    ", intrinsic warps could be missed through projection effects ( but no more than 20% ) .",
    "we therefore select a sample of 60 s - shape warped galaxies , the strongest and clearest among the 174 found .",
    "the selection is subjective , based on isophotal maps from the dss .",
    "this sample should be a suitable material for future detailed hi and optical works on galaxy warps .",
    "table 1 presents extraction from the southern extention of fgc ( karachentsev et al .",
    "1993 , fgce ) for the galaxies with large s - type warps .",
    "the sample is limited by coordinates @xmath1 , @xmath2 .",
    "the columns are as follows : galaxy fgce , pgc and eso number ; right ascension and declination for the epoch 1950.0 ; @xmath3 magnitude ( ned ) ; heliocentric radial velocity ( ned ) ; major and minor diameters measured on blue films ( in arcmin ) ; morphological type ; warp angle @xmath4  angle measured from the galaxy centre , between the plane and average line from centre to tips of outer isophotes ( see reshetnikov & combes 1998 ) ; position angle of average line passing through the tips of outer contour ( measured from n to e ) ",
    "p.a . ; direction of warp : clockwise ( + ) or counter - clockwise (  ) .    in the appendix ,",
    "we present the dss images of all galaxies ( in the @xmath5 passband ) , rotated to horizontal .    fig .",
    "[ hist ] presents the distribution of the sample galaxies according to warp angle @xmath4 .",
    "the distribution is truncated for @xmath6  4@xmath7 since we selected only galaxies with clearest warps to avoid selection effects .",
    "the mean value of @xmath4 is 4.@xmath78@xmath81.@xmath73(@xmath9 ) that is comparable with the amplitudes of optical warps found by sanchez - saavedra et al . (",
    "1990 ) , reshetnikov ( 1995 ) , and de grijs ( 1997 ) .",
    "dashed line in fig.[hist ] shows the @xmath10 law proposed by reshetnikov & combes ( 1998 ) to fit the observed distribution .",
    "a naive extrapolation of this law to @xmath4=0@xmath7 suggested that outer parts of all disk galaxies are warped with typical amplitudes of a few degrees .    in fig .",
    "[ pa ] we compare our measurements of the position angles of the sample galaxies with the fgce data .",
    "the agreement is quite good .",
    "the mean difference is @xmath11p.a .",
    "p.a.(fgce)@xmath12=0.@xmath76@xmath81.@xmath78(s.e.m . ) .",
    "excluding two most deviating galaxies ( fgce  333 , 981 ) we have @xmath11p.a . p.a.(fgce)@xmath12=+0.@xmath76@xmath80.@xmath74(s.e.m . ) .",
    "it is evident in figs .",
    "[ map ] that the projected spatial distribution of strongly warped galaxies and the distribution of their position angles are quite homogeneous ( at least in the first order approximation ) .",
    "the large `` void '' in figs.[map ] is due to absorption in the plane of milky way .",
    "comparison of the distributions for the galaxies with s - shaped and u - shaped warps shows that both distributions are statistically undistinguishable .",
    "there is no evidence of any significant large - scale alignment effect .",
    "the number of galaxies with clockwise warps ( 18 ) is smaller than counter - clockwise galaxies ( 42 ) .",
    "but , within our relatively poor statistics , the difference is not significant ( both numbers are consistent within 3@xmath9 ) .",
    "reshetnikov ( 1995 ) found that disks of more massive and luminous galaxies are somewhat less warped .",
