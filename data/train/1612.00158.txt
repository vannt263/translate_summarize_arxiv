    "( 2016 ) is that the current model of the crab - like pulsars takes into account emission from the pairs created outside the outer gap .",
    "the x - rays produced by the synchrotron radiation of the secondary pairs become the target soft - photon field for the photon - photon pair - creation process occurring outside the gap .",
    "one important difference in the circumstellar conditions between the crab - like pulsars and other fermi - lat pulsars is the mean - free path of the pair - creation process between a @xmath49gev photon and a background soft photon produced by the secondary pairs .",

    "the optical depth of the crab - like pulsars is usually larger than unity with @xmath56 . for the crab - like pulsars ,",
    "therefore , most of the primary gamma - rays with an energy @xmath49gev are absorbed by the pair - creation process and the secondary particles will emit the x - rays via synchrotron emission .",

    "are explained by the emission process of tev primary pairs and/or secondary pairs that were produced by the pair - creation process of the tev photons from the inverse - compton scattering process of the primary pairs .",

    "figure  [ intrinsic ] shows the intrinsic spectra for the curvature radiation ( solid line ) and inverse - compton scattering process ( dashed line ) inside the gap .",
    "as we can see in figure  [ j0540spe ] , the emissions ( dashed line ) from the low - energy secondary pairs explain the observed emissions in the 100ev-1gev energy bands .",

    "the fermi - lat observations found that the efficiency , @xmath89 , of psr  j0540 - 6919 is about a factor of ten larger than the crab pulsar , and this result is incompatible with the empirical relation @xmath90 of the fermi - lat pulsars ( abdo et al .",
    "2013 ) . here",
    "we suggest the smaller magnetic inclination of psr  j0540 - 6919 causes the larger radiation efficiency than the crab pulsar , whose magnetic inclination angle will be relatively large .",
    "figure  [ lumi ] shows the calculated gamma - ray luminosity as a function of the inclination angle . in the figure",
    ", the vertical axis is normalized by the calculated luminosity at @xmath86 .",
    "we find in the figure that the calculation luminosity tends to decrease as the inclination angle increases . in the current model ,",
    "this dependency was caused by the dependency on ( 1 ) the position of the null charge surface of the goldreich - julian charge density and on ( 2 ) the maximum gap current on the inclination angle .",
    "the gap power depends on the thickness of the gap in the poloidal plane , and it decreases with decreasing of the thickness .",
    "the electrodynamics of the conventional gap models expects the relation that @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is defined by the ratio between the size of the outer gap measured on the stellar surface and the polar cap size ( takata et al .",
    "for the crab - like pulsars , the outer gap size may be controlled by the mean - free path of the pair - creation process between the curvature photons and soft x - rays from the neutron star surface ( wang et al .",
    "since the null charge surface on the last - open field lines approaches to the stellar surface with the increase of the inclination angle , the location of the outer gap is closer to the stellar surface for larger inclination angle .",
    "since the number density of x - rays from the stellar surface is inversely proportional to the square of the radial distance , the pair - creation mean - free path inside the gap is shorter for the outer gap closer to the stellar surface .",
    "hence , the outer gap becomes thinner and as a result the gap radiation power decreases with the increasing of the inclination angle .    in the current calculation , the pair - creation process inside the gap is occurring due to collision between gev gamma - rays and surface x - rays . in this case , the mean free path of the pair - creation process at around the light cylinder is estimated as @xmath93 . with this mean - free path and the injection rate @xmath94 ,",
    "the gap thickness is determined so as to produce @xmath95 curvature photons inside the outer gap by one particle injected at the outer boundary , and thus to make @xmath96 of pairs by the pair - creation process inside the gap ( see section  [ discuss ] ) . with a constant mean - free path @xmath97 , we find that the gev photons have to travel a distance of @xmath98 inside the gap to screen the gap .",
    "the mean - free path actually depends on the position as @xmath99 .",
    "for a smaller inclination angle , because the null charger surface is close to the light cylinder , a constant mean - free path with @xmath100 is a good approximation . for a larger inclination angle , on the other hand",
    ", the null charge surface is closer to the stellar surface and the radial dependency of the mean - free path becomes more important , indicating the average mean - free path is shorter .",
    "therefore , the required travel distance of the gamma - rays to create @xmath96 pairs becomes shorter than @xmath98 of the lower inclination case , and therefore the gap thickness reduces .",
    "it has been suggested that the inner boundary of the middle part of the outer gap tends to be shifted toward the stellar surface as the gap current increases .",
    "the model suggests that the inner boundary will touch on the stellar surface if the gap current is @xmath101 in units of the goldreich - julian value ( takata et al .",
    "2004 ) , which decreases with increasing inclination angle .",
    "this is because the charge density that is created by the gap current at the inner boundary should match with the local value of goldreich - julian charge density , which on the polar cap region is @xmath102 .",
    "one may expect that if the inner boundary of the outer gap once touches on the stellar surface , the latter supplies copious particles to close the outer gap .",
    "therefore , the gap luminosity decreases with increasing inclination angle .",
    "as described in section  [ fit ] , the smaller magnetic inclination angle of psr  j0540 - 6919 preferentially explains the observed small separation of the two peaks in the pulse profile . for a larger magnetic inclination angle @xmath103 and a viewing angle @xmath6 , the phase - separation between two peaks is @xmath104 , as shown in figure  [ j0540light ] , and this would be the case for the crab pulsar .",
    "we emphasize , therefore , that the smaller inclination magnetic angle of psr  j0540 - 6919 can explain both the higher radiation efficiency and the narrower phase separations of the two peaks than those of the crab pulsar .",
    "fermi - lat resolved the gamma - ray emissions from the high spin - down powered pulsar , j0537 - 6910 , in the lmc with a flux level of @xmath105 .",
    "however , the pulsed emissions in fermi - lat data have yet to be confirmed , and the observed spectrum fitted by a single power - low function indicates the emissions to be from the pulsar wind nebula and/or a supernova remnant ( ackermann et al .",
    "2015 ) . since psr  j0537 - 6910 has the largest spin - down power ( @xmath106 ) and the strongest magnetic field at the light cylinder ( @xmath107 g ) among the known pulsars ( see the atnf pulsar catalog , manchester et al .",
    "2005 ) , it is likely that this pulsar produces gamma - rays in the magnetosphere , and but they are buried under the background emission , or the gamma - ray beam is out of the line of sight .",
    "the observed emission properties of psr  j0537 - 6910 are very different from those of the crab and j0537 - 6910 ; ( 1 ) the pulsed emissions have been discovered only in the x - ray bands , ( 2 ) the observed radiation efficiency in the x - rays is very low @xmath108 , and ( 3 ) the pulse width , @xmath109 , in the x - ray bands ( marshall et al .",
    "1998 ) is narrower than those of the other pulsars .",
    "no detection of the pulsed emissions by the fermi - lat makes if difficult for us to discuss the electromagnetic spectrum in the wide energy bands , and to constrain the magnetic inclination and the earth viewing angle .",
    "however , we may expect that the radiation process of psr  j0537 - 6910 is similar to those of the crab and j0540 - 6919 , and we may assume that the flux level of the pulsed gamma - rays measured on the earth is @xmath110 , which is the case for the crab and psr  j0540 - 6919 .",
    "under those assumptions , the observed radiation efficiency will be of the order of @xmath111 , which is about two orders of magnitude smaller than that of j0540 - 6919 .",
    "as expected from figure  [ lumi ] , we would say that it is difficult to explain @xmath112 by the effect of the inclination angle . if both psrs j0537 - 6910 and j0540 - 6919 have a viewing angle @xmath6 , it is also difficult to explain the difference in the pulse width with the difference in the inclination angle .",
    "we suggest therefore that the earth viewing angle is very different between the two pulsars .",
    "our model suggests that the earth viewing angle of psr  j0540 - 6919 is close to @xmath6 measured from the spin axis , which is also suggested by a study of the pulsar wind ( ng & romani 2004,2008 ) . since most of the pairs inside the gap are created around the null charge surface , the outer gap emission is stronger for an earth viewing angle of @xmath6 .",
    "as the viewing angle deviates from the @xmath6 , therefore , the observed gap emission rapidly decreases and hence the apparent radiation efficiency decreases ( see figures  3 and 4 in takata et al .",
    "2011 ) ; at the same time , the pulse width becomes narrower . on these grounds ,",
    "we speculate that the main reason for difference in the observed efficiencies and in the observed pulsed widths between psrs  j0540 - 6919 and  j0537 - 6910 is the difference in the earth viewing angle .      in figure  [ j0540spe ]",
    ", we assumed the same particle injection rates at the inner and outer boundaries .",
    "the assumption of equal injection rates at the gap boundaries is arbitrary , and it is not necessary for the real case . in the current",
    "_ local _ model , however , it would not be possible to consistently solve the injection particles at the gap boundaries , for which we would have to solve the global structure including the polar cap activities , outer gap activities , and pulsar wind region . to see the dependency on the choice of the injection current",
    ", we examined the case for @xmath113 and @xmath114 , that is , no particles enter into the gap from the inner boundary ( star side ) or outer boundary ( light cylinder side ) , respectively .",

    "we find in the figure that the calculated spectra become harder for @xmath114 ( dashed line in figure  [ j0540spe2 ] ) .",
    "this is related to the fact that most of the pairs are created by the inwardly propagating gamma - rays .",
    "collision with the x - rays from the surface is a head - on process for inwardly propagating gamma - rays , while it is tail - on process for outwardly propagating gamma - rays .",
    "hence , the mean - free path of the former is shorter than that of latter , and most of the pairs are created by the inwardly propagating gamma - rays .",
    "this indicates that the gap size is mainly controlled by the pair - creation process of the inwardly propagating gamma - rays . for @xmath114 ,",
    "therefore , the outer gap has to be thick to create enough pairs , and as a result the calculated spectrum becomes harder .        in our calculation , the gap structure is controlled by the magnitude of @xmath46 , except for the case @xmath119 .",
    "we quantitatively discuss how the gap size depends on the injection rate @xmath46 . since the gap thickness of the crab - like pulsar is about 10% of the light cylinder radius , we can approximate that the propagation direction of the gamma - rays is the same as the direction of the particle s motion . under this approximation ,",
    "the evolution of the number density of the inwardly moving particles ( electrons ) and gamma - rays in the pair - creation region is described by @xmath120 and @xmath121 respectively , where @xmath122 is the distance from the outer boundary , and @xmath123 and @xmath124 are number density and photon number density normalized by the goldreich - julian density , respectively .",
    "we ignore the effect of the pair - creation by the gamma - rays propagating outward .",
    "in addition , @xmath125 and @xmath126 are the mean free path of the photon - photon pair - creation process and the rate of the curvature radiation . in the present calculation ,",
    "since we assume the surface temperature @xmath127k , the mean - free path inside the gap at the light cylinder is estimated as @xmath128 , where we used @xmath129 and @xmath130 with @xmath131 being stefan - boltzmann constant .",
    "the rate of the curvature radiation is estimated as @xmath132 , where @xmath133 being the curvature radius , and @xmath134 the lorentz factor of the accelerated particles .    to solve the equations  ( [ dn ] ) and ( [ dg ] )",
    ", we impose the boundary conditions as @xmath135 and @xmath136 , where @xmath137 represents the outer boundary .",
    "we assume that the rate of the curvature radiation process , @xmath126 , is constant along the magnetic field line . by assuming that mean free path is constant along the distance @xmath122 from the outer boundary ( @xmath138 )",
    ", we find the solution that @xmath139 where @xmath140 .",
    "since we consider the surface x - ray emission as the soft - photon field for the photon - photon pair - creation process inside the outer gap , the mean - free path will decrease as @xmath141 . to take into account this effect",
    ", we explore the solution with the mean - free path in the form @xmath142 .",
    "the solution becomes @xmath143 ,      \\label{sol2}\\ ] ] where @xmath144 with @xmath145 .",
    "figure  [ pair ] shows the evolution of the ratio of the local number density and that at the outer boundary of the inwardly moving particles , @xmath146 , as a function of the distance from the outer boundary .",
    "the solid and dashed lines are solutions given by equations  ( [ sol2 ] ) and  ( [ sol1 ] ) , respectively ; here we adopted @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "we can find in the figure that the multiplicity of the particles injected at the outer boundary becomes @xmath96 if the gamma - rays travel @xmath98 from the outer boundary .",
    "this suggests that if the injection rate at the boundary is 1% of the goldreich - julian value ( that is , @xmath94 ) , the number density becomes the goldreich - julian value after the gamma - ray travels @xmath98 in the outer gap and the created pairs will significantly screen the accelerating electric field .",
    "this is consistent with the gap structure solved in this paper .",
    "figure  [ pair ] also indicates that for a smaller injection rate , the gamma - rays have to travel a greater distance to achieve the goldreich - julian number density of the pairs by the pair - creation , and hence the gap size becomes larger .",
    "as figure  [ j0540spe ] shows , the current model with using constant injection rate @xmath149 predicts that the residual curvature radiation of the primary particles and/or the emissions from the high - energy secondary pairs can explain the observed emissions above 1gev .",
    "takata et al .",
    "( 2016 ) , on the other hand , argued that sub - exponential decays of the gev spectra of the fermi - lat pulsars reflect the time - dependent emission process of the outer gap .",
    "they proposed that the injection rate at the gap boundaries is time - dependent variable and the observed gamma - ray spectrum is emitted from different gap structures with different injection rates . in the model , the observed spectrum was fitted better as the superposition of several power - law plus exponential cut - off functions with varying the cut - off energy , for which the different components are produced at the different injection rates at the gap boundaries .",
    "we discuss the shape of the observed gev spectrum of psr  j0540 - 6191 by the fermi - lat with the dynamics model in takata et al .",
    "we find however that the calculated gev spectra do not greatly affect the assumed extent of injection rate at the gap boundaries .",
    "this is because the gev gamma - rays observed on the earth do not come from the primary pairs in the gap , but the secondary pairs that are decelerated by the radiation process .",
    "figure  [ j0540spe1 ] shows the spectra of the emissions from the low - energy secondary pairs calculated with different injection rates ; @xmath150 ( solid line ) , @xmath151 ( dashed line ) and @xmath152 ( dotted line ) .",
    "we can see that the hardness ( peak energy ) of the `` synchrotron emissions '' ( low - energy component ) increases with decreasing of the injection rate .",
    "this is because the gap thickness increases and hence the electric field in the gap becomes stronger as the injection rate decreases . as a result ,",
    "the energy distribution of the low - energy secondary pairs that emit synchrotron photons becomes harder for a gap with a smaller injection rate .",
    "on the other hand , the energy peak of the spectra by `` inverse - compton scattering '' ( high - energy component ) does not greatly depend on the injection rate .",
    "this is because the synchrotron cooling is more important for the particles with a lorentz factor @xmath153 than the radiation cooling , due to the inverse - compton scattering .",
    "as figure  [ j0540spe1 ] shows , therefore , the energy peak of the inverse - compton scattering of low - energy secondary pairs always appears around @xmath96mev , regardless of the injection rates . as a result , it is obvious from figure  [ j0540spe1 ] that even if we superpose the emissions calculated with different injection rates , the combined spectrum decays faster and still has a large discrepancy with the fermi - lat spectrum above 1gev . on these grounds ,",
    "we conclude that the residual curvature photons and/or the emissions from the high - energy secondary pairs contribute to the observed emissions above 1gev .    in summary",
    ", we discussed the gamma - ray emissions from the crab - like pulsars , psrs  j0537 - 6910 and  j0540 - 6919 , in the lmc .",
    "the pulsed emissions from psr  j0540 - 6919 is observed to have an efficiency that is a factor of ten larger than that of the crab pulsar . by solving the electrodynamics of the outer gap accelerator",
    ", we concluded that the difference in the radiation efficiencies of psr  j0540 - 6919 and the crab pulsar is caused by the difference in the inclination angle .",
    "inferred from the observed x - ray emissions , the radiation efficiency of psr  j0537 - 6910 is about two orders of magnitude smaller than that of psr  j0540 - 6919 .",
    "because of the very narrow x - ray pulse and low radiation efficiency of psr  j0537 - 6910 , we suspect that the earth viewing angle of psr  j0537 - 6910 greatly deviates from @xmath6 , which is the case for the crab and psr  j0540 - 6919 .",
