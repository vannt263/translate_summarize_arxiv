    "in the last decade , the validity of the non relativistic many - body theory in the description of nuclear systems , has been well established .",
    "the idea is to describe the nucleus as a set of mutually interacting nucleons with a hamiltonian of the type @xmath6 where the two- and three - body interactions , @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively , are fixed to reproduce the properties of the two- and three - body systems .",
    "quantum monte carlo calculations solve the many - body schrdinger equation without approximations @xcite and have been applied with success to describe nuclei up to twelve nucleons @xcite .",
    "the only limitation of this approach is related to the available computing power , which , at present , does not allow its straightforward application to medium and heavy nuclei .",
    "the good results obtained by the quantum monte carlo calculations have renewed the interest in nuclear structure calculations with realistic , or microscopic , interactions .",
    "for this reason , many - body techniques , which are not approximation free , have been formulated , or reconsidered , and applied to the study of medium and heavy nuclei , or more in general , to nuclear systems with a@xmath94 .",
    "the oldest , and most commonly used , technique is the brueckner hartree - fock approach recently applied to calculate the properties of @xmath2o @xcite . in the last years , no - core shell model calculations @xcite have used microscopic interactions to calculate some property of nuclei up to @xmath1c .",
    "the coupled cluster method has been used to evaluate @xmath2o properties @xcite .",
    "more recently a technique called unitary correlation operator method has been developed to produce effective interactions used in mean - field and shell model calculations , and it has been applied with success to a variety of nuclei up to @xmath5pb @xcite .    in the early nineties , we started a project aimed to apply to finite nuclei the correlated basis function ( cbf ) theory , originally developed for infinite systems @xcite .",
    "the idea was to use the fermi hypernetted chain ( fhnc ) resummation technique , well tested in nuclear matter , to describe finite systems .",
    "we first tested the validity of our approach in model nuclei with degenerate proton and neutron states , and in @xmath10 coupling scheme @xcite .",
    "then , by using central interactions and scalar correlation functions , we applied the theory to describe nuclei with different single particle bases for protons and neutrons , with different number of protons and neutrons and with the more realistic @xmath0 coupling scheme @xcite .",
    "more recently , we have treated two - body interactions containing tensor and spin - orbit terms and this implies the use of state dependent correlations @xcite .",
    "this was not a straightforward extension of the formalism because the non commutativity of the different operators requires the use of the single operator chain ( soc ) approximation in the fhnc resummation .",
    "the fhnc / soc computational scheme has been extended to include spin - orbit and three - body interactions of urbana and argonne type @xcite . in these last calculations protons and neutrons",
    "single particle wave functions were distinguished only by the third component of the isospin , and they were treated in the @xmath10 coupling scheme .",
    "this choice allowed us to treat only systems saturated in spin and isospin .",
    "this paper represents a step forward in our project .",
    "the fhnc / soc formalism has been extended to treat nuclei with different proton and neutrons wave functions , and in a @xmath0 coupling scheme in spherical basis . with this single particle basis",
    "we obtained results for the @xmath1c , @xmath2o , @xmath3ca , @xmath4ca and @xmath5pb nuclei .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present the results we have obtained by using the two - body argonne @xmath11 @xcite and the urbana @xmath12 @xcite interactions , where we have considered all the channels up to the spin - orbit ones . in our calculations we have implemented these two - body interactions with the urbana ix @xcite and the urbana vii @xcite three - body interactions respectively .    in sect .",
    "[ sec : for ] we briefly discuss the basic ideas of the formalism pointing out the main differences with respect to what has been presented in @xcite and @xcite . the detailed presentation of the heavy formalism , which is given in @xcite , is beyond the scope of this article .",
    "our approach is based on the variational principle , i.e. we search for the minimum of the energy functional @xmath13= \\frac{<\\psi|h|\\psi>}{<\\psi|\\psi > } \\label{eq : efun}\\ ] ] we used the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hami ] ) in our calculations , and we express the two - body interaction in the form @xmath14 where we have defined the operators @xmath15 as : @xmath16\\otimes[1,{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\tau$}}_i\\cdot{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\tau$}}_j ]   \\label{eq : operator}\\ ] ] and where we have indicated with @xmath17 the tensor operator @xmath18 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vij ] ) we have limited the sum to the first 8 channels which are those used in our calculations . in reality",
    "modern two - body interactions have been parametrized by using up to 18 different channels @xcite .",
    "the three - body interaction @xcite is composed by two parts . a first one describes the process where two pions are exchanged with the intermediate excitation of a @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "this term describes the long - range part of the three - body interaction and , usually , gives an attractive contribution .",
    "the second part of the three - body interaction is a shorter range , repulsive , spin and isospin independent term .",
    "this term is supposed to simulate dispersive effects obtained when the @xmath19 degrees of freedom are integrated out .",
    "the search for the energy minimum ( [ eq : efun ] ) is done in the subspace of the many - body wave functions @xmath20 which can be expressed as : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a many - body correlation function and @xmath23 is a slater determinant composed by a set of single particle wave functions @xmath24 . in our calculations",
    "we describe the many - body correlation function as a symmetrized product of two - body correlation functions : @xmath25\\ ] ] and we use two - body correlation functions @xmath26 which have an operator dependence analogous to that of the nucleon - nucleon interaction ( [ eq : vij ] ) , but without the spin - orbit terms : @xmath27      the evaluation of the multidimensional integrals necessary to calculate the energy functional ( [ eq : efun ] ) is done by performing a cluster expansion and by applying the fhnc resummation techniques .",
    "our work is based on the formalism developed in @xcite .",
    "the two basic quantities used in the cluster expansion of eq .",
    "( [ eq : efun ] ) are the one- and the two - body density matrices respectively defined as : @xmath28 where we have indicate with @xmath29 the coordinate fully characterizing the particle @xmath30 , i.e. position @xmath31 , 3-rd components of the spin , @xmath32 , and of the isospin , @xmath33 .",
    "the evaluation of the expectation values of one- and two - body operators can be obtained by making the operators acting on the densities ( [ eq : obdc ] ) and ( [ eq : tbdc ] ) and integrating on the free variables .    in the uncorrelated case , @xmath34 ,",
    "the expressions ( [ eq : obdc ] ) and ( [ eq : tbdc ] ) become : @xmath35 where we have indicated with @xmath36 the single particle wave functions . in the above equations ,",
    "the sum is done on all the occupied states , and we have used the notation @xmath37 to indicate the diagonal part of the one - body density function .    we construct the single particle wave functions by using a spherical mean field potential containing a spin - orbit term .",
    "protons and neutrons wave functions are generated by different potentials .",
    "the single particle wave functions are classified in terms of the angular momentum @xmath38 and of the third component of the isospin @xmath33 .",
    "they can be written as : @xmath39 where we have indicated with @xmath40 the spherical harmonics , with @xmath41 the pauli spinor / isospinor and with @xmath42 the clebsch - gordan coefficient .    in the calculations of refs .",
    "@xcite , the radial part of the single particle wave function was independent on the isospin .",
    "this , joined to the fact that we studied doubly closed shell nuclei on @xmath10 coupling with the same number of protons and neutrons , allowed us to separate the spatial part from the spin and isospin dependent parts in @xmath43 . because we restricted our investigation to finite systems saturated in spin and isospin , we could use the trace techniques developed in @xcite to deal with state dependent correlations .    in the present case , as pointed out in @xcite , the choice of the single particle basis ( [ eq : spwf ] ) requires to consider the spin dependence of the radial part of the one - body density matrix : @xmath44 therefore the factorization between spatial and spin - isospin dependence of the one - body density matrix is lost .",
    "we consider two radial terms of the one - body density matrix . a first one , @xmath45 , related to the parallel spin terms , and the other one , @xmath46 , to the antiparallel spin terms .",
    "we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhossp ] ) as : @xmath47 the explicit expressions of @xmath45 and @xmath46 , in terms of single particle wave functions , are given in @xcite .",
    "the study of ref .",
    "@xcite has shown that the main contribution to the one - body density matrix is given by @xmath45 , which is the only term surviving in spin saturated systems having degenerate spin - orbit partners .",
    "the similarity of this term to the one appearing in the @xmath10 coupling scheme , allows us to use some simplifications in the calculations of the correlated distributions ( [ eq : obdc],[eq : tbdc ] ) following the procedure adopted in @xcite .",
    "even though the contribution of the @xmath46 terms are much smaller than those of @xmath48 , they can not be neglected , as it is indicated by the sum rule results .",
    "for this reason , we had to calculate new kinds of spin traces .    in the calculation of the one - body density matrix and of the two - body density function ( [ eq : obdc ] ) and ( [ eq : tbdc ] ) we consider the scalar terms of the correlations at all the orders of the cluster expansion .",
    "this part of the calculation follows step by step that presented in @xcite .",
    "the two - body densities are written in terms of the scalar correlation @xmath49 , of the _ nodal _ , or _ chain _ , diagrams @xmath50 , of the non nodal ( composite ) diagrams @xmath51 and of the _ elementary _ , or _",
    ", diagrams @xmath52 . here",
    "the two sub - indexes @xmath53 and @xmath54 identify the exchange character of the external points @xmath55 and @xmath56 , as classified in @xcite .",
    "the situation becomes more complicated when state dependent correlations are introduced , essentially because the various terms of the correlations do not commute with the hamiltonian and among themselves . at present ,",
    "a complete fhnc treatment for the full , state dependent cluster expansion of the two - body densities is not available . in our calculations we adopted the single operator chain ( soc ) approximation @xcite consisting in summing those operator chains containing scalar dressing at all orders , but only a single operator @xmath57 element .",
    "the different kind of diagrams : nodal , non - nodal and elementary ones , are characterized by an index @xmath58 denoting the operator ( [ eq : operator ] ) associated to the correlation function . in order to treat nuclei with different number of protons and neutrons ( @xmath59 )",
    "we separate the isospin dependence of the correlation operators from that of the other operators : @xmath60 with @xmath61 .    with respect to the treatment presented in @xcite",
    ", now we have to consider that the various diagrams depend on the third isospin component of the nucleons located in the two external points . as a consequence ,",
    "the number of cluster diagrams to be calculated is four that of the previous cases . in reality , for symmetry reasons , we had to calculate separately only three different types of diagrams .",
    "in addition , we should take into account also the contribution of the uncorrelated two - body densities with antiparallel spins , the terms related to @xmath46 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhossp1 ] ) .",
    "the contributions of these two - body densities are not zero only for the scalar , @xmath62 , and isospin , @xmath63 , operators .",
    "as we have already mentioned in the introduction , a detailed presentation of all the expressions used in our calculations can be found in @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the energy expectation value has been done along the lines of refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "we used the jackson - feenberg identity to calculate the kinetic energy , since this expression allows us to eliminate terms of the type @xmath64 involving three - body operators @xcite . following the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite , we express the kinetic energy by separating those terms where the @xmath65 operator acts on the correlation function @xmath66 only , from those where it acts on the uncorrelated many - body wave function @xmath67 .",
    "@xmath68 where we have defined @xcite : @xmath69 and @xmath70   \\phi \\rangle ,   \\label{eq : tf}\\ ] ] the operator structure of the @xmath71 terms is similar to that obtained by inserting the two - body interaction term of the hamiltonian .",
    "for this reason , we found convenient to calculate the joint contribution of the @xmath72 operator , called _ interaction energy _ in @xcite . in this calculation",
    "we have considered all the interaction terms up to @xmath73 .",
    "the expectation value of @xmath74 can be expressed in terms of @xmath75 where the @xmath76 labels refer to the type of operator and can assume values from 1 to 6 .",
    "following what has been done in @xcite , we found convenient to split @xmath74 in four parts identified by the different topology of the various links , @xmath77 the @xmath78 term is the sum of the diagrams having only scalar chains between the interacting points , connected by @xmath79 .",
    "we indicate with @xmath80 the sum of the diagrams with a single operator ring ( sor ) touching the interacting points and scalar chains .",
    "the @xmath81 term contains diagrams with a single operator chain ( soc ) between the interacting points and @xmath82 contains both sor and soc between the interacting points .",
    "the expressions we obtain for the contributions of the various @xmath74 terms are more involved than those presented in @xcite .",
    "this because we have to sum on all the isospin indexes and , in addition , we must consider also the contribution of the exchange links with different spin projections .",
    "the detailed expressions are given in @xcite .",
    "in reality , we calculate explicitly the @xmath78 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 contributions , while for the @xmath82 we used the approximation @xmath83 $ ] whose validity is discussed in @xcite .    as an example of the differences between the present calculations and those of @xcite",

    "we have indicated with @xmath91 the direct part of the two - body density function which includes all the diagrams where the two external particles , 1 and 2 , do not belong to the same statistical loop .",
    "( [ eq : w01 ] ) has only one exchange part of the two  body density function , @xmath92 . on the contrary eq .",
    "( [ eq : w02 ] ) contains two terms depending weather the spin of the external particles are parallel , @xmath93 , or antiparallel , @xmath94 .    while the two - body density functions are isospin independent in eq .",
    "( [ eq : w01 ] ) , in the present calculations we have to distinguish the cases when the external particles are protons or neutrons . this isospin dependence obliges us to isolate the isospin traces from those related to the other operators .",
    "these traces can be written in terms of @xmath95 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : w01 ] ) the isospin trace is included in the @xmath96 matrices , defined in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath97 matrices of eq .",
    "[ eq : w02 ] are the spin traces of the products of operators , therefore , they are included in @xmath96 . as we have already mentioned , the presence of a new statistical link in the exchange part of eq .",
    "( [ eq : w02 ] ) requires the evaluation of spin traces absent in the @xmath10 coupling case .",
    "the differences pointed out in the previous discussion are present in all the terms of the kinetic energy . to simplify the calculations ,",
    "we have calculated the contribution of @xmath94 only in the @xmath78 and @xmath80 parts of the interaction energy . in these two terms",
    "the contribution of @xmath94 is about two orders of magnitude smaller than that of @xmath98 .",
    "we have estimated that this relation between the two exchange terms is not going to be modified in @xmath99 .",
    "the calculation of the kinetic energy contribution requires the evaluation of the @xmath100 term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : tphi ] ) .",
    "also in this case , in analogy to what we have done in @xcite , we separate the term in three parts : @xmath101 where the term @xmath102 corresponds to the contributions where the kinetic energy operator acts on a nucleon not involved in any exchange , the term @xmath103 when it belongs to a two - body exchange loop , and @xmath104 to a many - body exchange loop .",
    "the expression obtained for @xmath105 is the same as that given in @xcite .",
    "the other terms are more involved because of their dependence on the isospin indexes , the presence of new isospin traces and of the exchange links with the @xmath106 uncorrelated densities @xcite .    the evaluation of the _ interaction energy _",
    "( [ eq : hjf ] ) , allows us to calculate all the two - body interaction channels up to @xmath73 .",
    "the contribution of the remaining terms of the two - body interaction , the @xmath107 spin - orbit channels , has been calculated following the procedure and the approximations discussed in @xcite .",
    "we calculate only the @xmath78 term with the @xmath108 correlation function .",
    "again , the expressions we have obtained are more involved than those given in @xcite since we have isospin dependent terms , and we have considered the contribution of the leading @xmath106 in the exchange terms .    the above discussion can be extended to describe our treatment of the three - body interaction .",
    "we have used the nuclear matter results of ref .",
    "@xcite to select the relevant diagrams to be evaluated .",
    "we followed the lines of calculations presented in @xcite and we took care of the new aspects caused by the @xmath0 coupling and @xmath109 @xcite .",
    "the fhnc / soc formalism presented above , has been applied to calculate binding energies and matter distributions of @xmath1c , @xmath2o , @xmath3ca , @xmath4ca , and @xmath5pb doubly magic nuclei .",
    "a complete variational calculation would imply the search for the energy minimum by modifying both the set of single particle wave functions forming @xmath67 , and the correlations function @xmath66 .",
    "these calculations are numerically very involved since the number of the free parameters to be modified is rather large , about ten . to reduce the computational effort in our calculations we kept fixed the single particle wave functions and we made variations on the correlation function only . at first sight",
    "this can appear a severe limitation , however we have shown in @xcite that large changes of the mean field wave functions produce small variations of the value of the total energy of the system .",
    "for this reason , by extrapolating the findings of @xcite we are confident that our results are only few percent above the minimum obtained with a full minimization .    in our calculations we adopted the same set of single particle wave functions used in @xcite .",
    "they are generated by a woods - saxon central potential containing a spin - orbit term .",
    "different potentials have been used for protons and neutrons .",
    "the parameters of these potentials , given in @xcite , have been taken from the literature where they have been fixed to reproduce , at best , the single particle energies close to the fermi energy , and the charge density distributions .",
    "the other fixed input of our calculations are the nucleon - nucleon interactions . in this article",
    "we discuss mainly the results obtained with the two - body argonne @xmath110 interaction @xcite implemented with the urbana ix ( @xmath111 ) three - body force @xcite . as a comparison",
    ", we discuss also results obtained with the urbana @xmath12 two - body interaction @xcite but considering only the first eight channels . together with the @xmath12 two - body interaction interaction we used the urbana vii ( @xmath112 ) @xcite three - body interaction .",
    "the hamiltonian and the single particle basis are fixed input of our calculations and the variations have been done on the correlation function @xmath66 .",
    "the two - body correlation functions @xmath113 are the functions we have modified in order to find the minimum of the energy functional .",
    "we fixed these functions by using the technique we have defined as _",
    "euler procedure _ in our previous works @xcite .",
    "we solve the fhnc / soc equations up to the second order in the cluster expansion by forcing the asymptotic behaviour of the two - body correlation functions @xmath113 .",
    "more specifically we imposed that , after certain asymptotic distances , that we call _ healing distances _ , the scalar two - body correlations ( @xmath62 ) must be equal to one , while the other correlation functions must be zero .",
    "the values of the _ healing distances _ are our variational parameters .    in the actual calculations , in order to reduce the number of variational parameters , we used only two _",
    "healing distances_. a first one , @xmath114 , for all the central channels , @xmath115 , and a second one , @xmath116 , for the two tensor channels @xmath117 .",
    "nuclear matter @xcite and finite nuclei @xcite calculations indicate that tensor and central correlations _",
    "heals _ at different distances .",
    "minima are found for tensor _ healing distances _ larger than the central ones .    in tab . [",
    "tab : heal ] , we present the values of the healing distances giving the energy minima for each nucleus , and for both interactions @xmath11 with @xmath111 and @xmath12 with @xmath112 .",
    "it is remarkable the similarity of these values for all the nuclei but the @xmath1c nucleus .",
    "the values of @xmath114 for the two interactions are the same , with the usual exception of @xmath1c , while the @xmath116 values for @xmath12 plus @xmath112 are slightly larger than those obtained with @xmath11 plus @xmath111 .",
    "the two - body correlation functions obtained for the @xmath11 plus @xmath111 interaction are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : corr ] for each channel . in the figure",
    ", we also show with the diamonds the nuclear matter correlations .",
    "these last correlations are obtained with the euler procedure by using the same healing distances used for finite nuclei but with constant density value of the nuclear matter the saturation point .",
    "analogous results have been obtained for the @xmath12 plus @xmath112 interaction .",
    "we would like to point out two features of these results .",
    "the first one , is that the various correlations are rather similar for all the nuclei considered .",
    "only the @xmath1c results are out of this general trend .",
    "this fact indicates that the correlation functions are more sensitive to the characteristics of the nucleon - nucleon interaction than to the shell effects .",
    "the second point we want to mention is the difference between the _ healing distances _ of the central and tensor channels . in the two - body interaction ,",
    "the tensor channels are active at larger distances with respect to the central channels , and this produces the consequences on the correlation functions we have just pointed out .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the _ healing _ for the tensor channels appears at distances larger than the experimental charge radius of the deuteron .    in this discussion",
    "the @xmath1c nucleus remains an anomaly .",
    "the @xmath118 correlation is rather similar to those of the other nuclei , all the other two - body correlations are remarkably different , especially @xmath119 and @xmath120 related to the spin and spin - orbit dependent terms .",
    "also the nuclear matter results are not on the band formed by the correlations found for the @xmath2o - @xmath5pb nuclei .",
    "the differences are not so large as those of the @xmath1c , but still rather evident .",
    "it is remarkable the similarity in the @xmath118 channel and in the @xmath121 channel , while all the other channels show noticeable differences .",
    "our calculations are organized in such a way that we first solve the fhnc equation for the scalar correlation only , and in a second step we solve the fhnc / soc equations with the other state dependent correlation terms .",
    "the validity of our solution techniques , from both the theoretical and numerical points of view , can be appreciated by observing the convergence in the density sum rules shown in tab . [",
    "tab : sumr ] . in this table",
    "we give the normalization of the one- and two - body densities ( [ eq : obdc ] ) and ( [ eq : tbdc ] ) . the @xmath122 and @xmath123 sum rules have been defined in such a way that all of them are normalized to unity .",
    "the results of the table show that the jastrow - fhnc calculations , those with @xmath118 only , produce densities deviating by few parts on a thousand from the correct normalization .",
    "the inclusion of state dependent terms in the correlations , the fhnc / soc calculations , is responsible for an increase of these deviations up to a maximum value of 5.5 % . in many - body systems saturated in spin and isospin",
    "one can also test spin and isospin density sum rules . in the systems we are investigating these sum rules are not any more valid .",
    "the main result of our paper is summarized in tab . [",
    "tab : bene ] where we give the values of the binding energies per nucleon for all the five nuclei considered , and we compare them with the experimental binding energies @xcite . in the table we present the various terms contributing to the total energy : the kinetic energy @xmath124 , the two - body interaction , where the the contribution of the first six channels @xmath125 and that of the spin - orbit interaction @xmath126 are separately given , the coulomb interaction @xmath127 and the three - body force @xmath128 . in the kinetic energy term",
    "the contribution of the center of mass motion , calculated as discussed in @xcite , has already been subtracted .",
    "the various terms show some saturation properties .",
    "for example the values of kinetic energies per nucleon @xmath124 increase up to @xmath3ca and then they remain almost stable around a value of about 40 mev .",
    "an analogous behaviour is shown by the @xmath125 terms .",
    "the contribution per nucleon increases with increasing number of nucleons up to @xmath3ca .",
    "after that it is evident that saturation appears in heavier systems .",
    "we have already mentioned the fact that the spin - orbit terms are not treated consistently in the fhnc / soc computational scheme , but they are evaluated by using some approximation . in any case , in all the nuclei considered , their contributions are of the order of few percent with respect to the @xmath125 contributions . as a further test , we have done calculations in @xmath2o and @xmath3ca switching off the spin - orbit terms in the mean field potential . in this case",
    "the spin - orbit partner single particle wave functions are identical . the differences in the total spin - orbit contributions , with respect to the values given in tab .",
    "[ tab : bene ] are within the numerical uncertainty .",
    "the contribution of the coulomb term @xmath127 is evaluated within the complete fhnc / soc computational scheme . as expected",
    ", the behaviour with increasing size of the nucleus does not show saturation because of the long range nature of the interaction .",
    "the coulomb terms behave as expected , their contributions increase with increasing number of protons .",
    "the apparent inversion of this trend from @xmath3ca to @xmath4ca is due to the representation in terms of energy per nucleon , which in this case is misleading , since the proton number is the same for the two nuclei . in this case",
    "it is better to compare the total values of the coulomb energies , 78.40 mev for @xmath3ca and 75.36 for @xmath4ca .",
    "the 3.8% difference between these to values is due to the different structure of the two nuclei .",
    "the inclusion of the coulomb repulsion reduces the nuclear binding energies . to simplify the reading of the table we give in the raw labeled @xmath129 the intermediate energy value obtained with the two - body force only , coulomb interaction included .",
    "the total binding energies without the three - body forces are all above the experimental values .",
    "in addition to that , there is the contribution of the three - body force . as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "the two terms composing this interactions provide contributions of different sign , the fujita - miyazawa term is attractive , while the other term is repulsive . in our calculations",
    "the total contribution of the three - body forces is always globally repulsive .",
    "the comparison with the experimental energies indicates a general underbinding of about 3 - 4 mev per nucleon . in the general behaviours we have discussed so far , the anomaly of the @xmath1c nucleus emerges . in all our calculations",
    "the attractive contribution of the @xmath130 is relatively smaller than for the other nuclei . as a consequence",
    ", this nucleus results barely bound in our calculations . some crucial physics ingredient relevant in @xmath1c while negligible for the other other nuclei is missing in our approach .",
    "probably this has to do with soft deformations of the @xmath1c nucleus which we are unable to treat .",
    "the comparison between the two interactions indicates that the @xmath12 plus @xmath112 is more attractive than the @xmath11 plus @xmath111 .",

    "the situation is enhanced by the three - body force , more repulsive for the @xmath111 case than for the @xmath112 one .",
    "the contributions of the spin - orbit term in the two cases have different sign , they are attractive for @xmath11 and slightly repulsive for @xmath12 .",
    "the differences in the total energies calculated with the two sets of interactions go from a minimum of 5% ( @xmath2o ) to a maximum of 18% ( @xmath5pb ) .    despite the remarkable differences in the energy , the two interactions produce",
    "very similar results in the observables related to the density distributions . for this reason , henceforth , we shall present results obtained with the @xmath11 plus @xmath111 interaction only .    in figs .",

    "@xcite where a first - order cluster expansion has been used .",
    "it is evident the scarce relevance of short - range correlations in reducing the occupation probability of the 3s1/2 proton state in @xmath5pb . as pointed out in @xcite , the effect of long - range correlations",
    "seems to be main reduction mechanism .    in order to investigate the relative effects of the various correlations on the protons and neutrons distributions we studied the ratio : @xmath131 where , as it has been defined in eq .",

    "the @xmath133 ratios are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : densd ] for all the nuclei under investigation .",
    "the behaviour of the various lines indicates more similarity between results obtained with the same type of correlation than between protons and neutrons .",
    "this result is quite remarkable because of the large difference between proton and neutron distributions , especially for @xmath4ca and @xmath5pb .",
    "a direct comparison with the empirical charge density distributions is not very meaningful since the mean - field potential has already been fixed to reproduce , at its best , these distributions .",
    "the only statements we can make is whether the inclusion of the correlations improves or not the agreement with the data .",
    "for this reason we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : chd ] the ratios @xmath134 where the experimental charge distributions have been taken from @xcite .",

    "this joint probabilities are obtained as product of the uncorrelated one - body densities .",
    "this definition of the uncorrelated two - body density can be meaningful from the probabilistic point of view , but it is misleading in our framework , since it corresponds to use only the first , direct , term of eq .",

    "the correlations reduce the values of the two - body densities at short internucleon distances .",
    "the exchange term of the uncorrelated density , already contributes to this reduction , but the major effect is produced by the short - range correlations , and mainly by the scalar correlations .",

    "[ fig : tbdpp ] and [ fig : tbdnn ] . when the pair of nucleons is composed by different particles the situation slightly changes . beside to the strong reductions at small distances ,",

    "( [ eq : soctbdm ] ) for @xmath145 we have @xmath146 , since @xmath147 for every value of @xmath148 . for this reason , in fig .",
    "[ fig : tbdpp ] , we present only the p=3 and p=5 two - body densities for both proton - proton and neutron - neutron cases . in the proton - neutron case",
    "the two - body densities are different in every channel .",
    "we first notice that tensor two - body densities , p=5 , and also p=6 in fig .",
    "[ fig : tbdpn ] , are different from zero only in the full fhnc / soc calculations .",
    "this occours because in order to get a spin trace different from zero in eq .",
    "[ eq : otbdm ] at least two tensor operators are needed . in fig .",
    "[ fig : tbdpn ] also the p=3 spin density is different from zero only in the fhnc / soc case .",
    "the reason is that , in the calculation of this density , for the uncorrelated and the jastrow cases , the first term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : tbdu ] ) , the direct one , is zero because of the spin trace , while the exchange term is zero because of the different isospin third component .",
    "we observe from figs .",
    "[ fig : tbdpp ] and [ fig : tbdpn ] that the effects of the correlations are analogous to those already discussed for the scalar two - body densities : the values of the densities is strongly reduced at short internucleonic distances .",
    "in addition to that it is worth to mention the change of sign in the isospin , p=2 , densities in the proton - neutron case .",
    "the most remarkable feature is the range of the various densities .",
    "the scalar densities of figs .",
    "[ fig : tbdpp ] , [ fig : tbdpn ] and [ fig : tbdnn ] and the isospin densities , p=2 , extend up to relative distances comparable to the dimensions of the nucleus , 15 fm . on the contrary , all the other two - body densities have much smaller ranges , of the order of 3 - 4 fm .",
    "these features are present in all the nuclei considered @xcite .",

    "@xcite we have applied for the first time the fhnc / soc computational scheme to nuclei with different number of protons and neutrons and in the @xmath0 coupling scheme .",
    "we have used two different sets of microscopic interactions : the argonne @xmath11 implemented with the urbana ix three - body force , and the truncated urbana @xmath12 plus the urbana vii three - body force .",
    "binding energies have been presented in tab .",
    "[ tab : bene ] and this is the main result of our work . with the noticeable exception of the @xmath1c nucleus ,",
    "our binding energies are about 3 - 4 mev / nucleon above the experimental ones , consistently with our previous results @xcite and with those obtained in nuclear matter .",
    "in our calculations we did not include the contributions of the spin - orbit terms of the correlation and of the p@xmath9 8 terms of the two - body potential , which in @xcite have been estimated by means of a local density interpolation of the nuclear matter results .",
    "these contributions are attractive and of the order of 1 mev / nucleon .",
    "this produces differences with the experimental values of the order of those presented in @xcite where only the @xmath2o and @xmath3ca nuclei were considered .",
    "a number of possible sources of the remaining disagreement should be investigated such as the three - body correlations and perturbative corrections of the two - body correlations .",
