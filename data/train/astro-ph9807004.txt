    "hence , any abundance of deuterium measured at any metallicity should provide a lower limit to the primordial deuterium abundance ( reeves _ et al .",
    "deuterium is thus a key element in cosmology and in galactic chemical evolution ( _ e.g. _ , steigman , schramm & gunn 1977 ; audouze & tinsley 1976 ; vidal - madjar & gry 1984 ; boesgaard & steigman 1985 ; olive _ et al .",

    "the primordial abundance of deuterium is indeed the best probe of the baryonic density parameter of the universe @xmath9 , and the decrease of its abundance with galactic evolution traces , amongst other things , the amount of star formation .",
    "the first , although indirect , measurement of the deuterium abundance of astrophysical significance was carried out through @xmath10he in the solar wind , leading to @xmath11 ( geiss & reeves 1972 ) , a value representative of an epoch 4.5 gyrs past .",
    "the first measurements of the interstellar  ratio , representative of the present epoch , were reported shortly thereafter ( rogerson & york 1973 ) .",
    "their value of @xmath12 has not changed ever since .",
    "the most accurate measurement of the interstellar  ratio was reported by linsky _",
    "( 1993 , 1995 , hereafter l93 , l95 ) in the direction of capella , using hst - ghrs , @xmath13 ( statistical + sytematic ) .    up",
    "to a few years ago , these measurements were used to constrain bbn in a direct way .",
    "the situation has changed , as measurements of the  ratio in metal - deficient quasars absorbers , at moderate and high redshift , have become available ( _ e.g. _ , carswell _ et al .",

    "however , these observations have not provided a single definite value of the primordial  ratio . at the present time",
    ", it is not known whether the higher estimates of the primordial  ratio reported are artifacts due to the mimicking of the  line by an  interloper , or whether the ratios reported ( low or high ) are discrepent due to errors in interpreting the velocity structure , or whether substantial fluctuations ( a factor @xmath14 ) actually exist .    on similar grounds ,",
    "it turns out that determinations of the interstellar ratio do not generally agree on a single value , even in the very local medium ( vidal - madjar _ et al .",

    "_ 1981 ) , the above measurements are still unaccounted for . despite the high quality of the data , it may nevertheless be possible that even better data is required to overcome systematic effects .",
    "the only way to derive a reliable estimate of the interstellar   ratio is to observe the atomic transitions of d and h in the far - uv , in absorption in the local ism against the background continuum of cool or hot stars .",
    "these observations have been performed using the copernicus and iue satellites , and now the hubble space telescope .",
    "both types of target stars present pros and cons .",
    "the main advantage of observing cool stars is that they can be selected in the vicinity of the sun .",
    "this results in low hi column densities , and simple lines of sight .",
    "a difficulty inherent to the cool stars approach is that the detailed structure of the line of sight can be obtained only through the observation of the feii and the mgii ions , which are unfortunately not proper tracers of . in particular , species like ni and oi could not be observed .",
    "moreover , the estimate of the  column density always depends strongly on the modeling of the chromospheric lyman @xmath17 emission line .",
    "the capella target of l93 , l95 is a double system with two cool stars : it provided a line of sight with a single absorbing component ( see however sec.5 ) , and allowed a very accurate estimate of the  ratio , as the emission line could be modeled by observing the binary system at different phases .",
    "hot stars are unfortunately located further away from the sun , so that one always has to face a high hi column density and often a non - trivial line of sight structure . in these cases , di could not be detected at ly@xmath17 , and one has to observe higher order lines , _ e.g. _",

    "the stellar continuum is however smooth at the location of the interstellar absorption and , moreover , the ni triplet at 1200    as well as other ni lines are available to probe the velocity structure of the line of sight .",

    "it fulfills all the criteria for a good candidate to measure the  ratio .",
    "apart from  and  at lyman @xmath17 , we obtained the spectra of the lines ( 1199 , 1200 , 1201 ) , ( 1206 ) , ( 1302 ) and ( 1304 ) using echelle - a .",
    "the observation at high spectral resolution of  and  should allow us to resolve possible different  absorbing clouds on the line of sight , while the observation of  and  should allow the detection of possible  gas . from the comparison of the @xmath30  values of different atomic weights ,",
    "an estimate of the temperature and turbulent velocity in the different clouds is also possible , while the analysis of the  and  lines should determine the ionization structure of the line of sight . in particular ,",
    "the observed lines of ,  and  are not saturated , and should therefore provide accurate estimates of the column densities .",
    "the  1302  line is slightly saturated in this low  column density environment , and should thus offer a reasonable estimate of the column densities , as well as of the @xmath30-values . at the end , we expect to obtain a sufficient number of constraints on all parameters involved in the analysis of the lyman @xmath17 lines of  and , but the  ratios of the different components .",
    "our data were reduced with the image reduction and analysis facility ( iraf ) software , using the stsdas package . during the observations , we used the fp - split mode which splits the total exposure time into successive cycles of 4 sub - exposures , each corresponding to a slightly different projection of the spectrum on the photocathode .",
    "we used the `` quarter stepping '' mode , which provides a sample of 4 pixels per resolution element .",
    "this oversamples the spectrum ( since for instance the ssa does not fulfill the nyquist sampling criterion ) , and allows to correct for the granularity of the photocathode .",
    "indeed , the effect of the photocathode on each diode being the same for the four sub - exposures , it is possible to evaluate this granularity from the comparison of the 4 sub - exposures where a constant granularity effect mixes with a non - constant photon statistical noise .",
    "we found that the standard method for correcting for the granularity , which is available in the iraf - stsdas package , was not efficient as a result of the impact of the geomagnetic field on the photocathode .",
    "the geomagnetic field deflects the incident electron beam on the diodes in a way depending on the location of the hst on its orbit , thus making the granularity pattern non - constant from sub - exposure to sub - exposure . as a result",
    ", the standard iterative method leads to the appearance of noisy features whose intensity increases with the number of iterations .",
    "we therefore developed a different procedure based on the use of simple statistical filters .",
    "we first cross - correlate the different spectra corresponding to the same spectral ranges , _",
    "i.e. _ the different sub - exposures of a same exposure , and shift them accordingly so that real absorption or emission features correspond to the same pixel values in each spectrum .",
    "we next compute the median and the standard deviation with respect to that median at each pixel , our statistical sample being the set of intensities of the different spectra at that pixel . finally , we compute the average intensity value at each pixel , rejecting the intensities of the different spectra deviating from the median by more than , say , 3 standard deviations .",
    "we found that this simple treatment resulted in good signal - to - noise ratios ( fig .",
    "[ hi ] ) while avoiding any residual ghost feature ( see bertin _",
    "_ 1995 for more details ) .",
    "we chose to rebin our spectra to two pixels per diode in all cases but , _",
    "i.e. _ two pixels per resolution element approximately , which is the standard sampling mode , using the iraf - stsdas procedure . in the case of the very sharp edges of the line contain most of the information , and we thus decided to keep four pixels per resolution element so as to take advantage of the oversampling available in these observations .    in the case of lyman @xmath17 ,",
    "the spectral signature is not as sharp , and , moreover , the s / n ratio is significantly lower at the bottom of the line , and we thus developed a second approach to check the consistency of our procedure .",
    "we re - align the sub - exposures using the deuterium line , which is clearly detected in each of the sub - exposure , as a reference .",
    "this procedure means we are unable to correct for the photocathode granularity .",
    "nonetheless , it appears that no such defect is present at . in effect , such defects are of order @xmath2610% , and are thus easily detected when adding the sub - exposures corresponding to _ a priori _ the same spectral instrument shift , thereby improving the s / n ratio and building four different shifted spectra where the photocathode defects appear at fixed positions .",
    "this process allowed us to show that the amplitude of photocathode defects in the central region does not exceed a few percent .",
    "one clearly sees such defects in fig .",
    "[ hi ] in the far wings of the  profile , around 1213.4  and 1217.5  ( these defects were not perfectly corrected through the first approach ) .",
    "thus the final  line profile is well represented in the region from 1213.6  to 1217.3 , and the region that we use in our data analysis is even further reduced to 1214.5 - 1217.0 , where the spectral information lies .    as a second consistency check",
    ", we measure the width of the geocoronal emission line .",
    "spurious shifts in the co - adding procedure would degrade the spectral resolution .",
    "the geocoronal emission line should be a very narrow feature , only slightly broader than the nominal instrument spectral resolution .",
    "we find , fitting the emission line with a gaussian , an equivalent doppler width @xmath31 , corresponding to a temperature @xmath32k , after deconvolution from the instrumental profile . at this point",
    ", one should note that the geocorona fills up the ssa , so that its width results from the convolution of the intrinsic width with the spectrograph instrumental profile , and with the profile of a point source broadened by the projection of the ssa on the spectral scale ; this latter effect amounts to broadening the ssa instrumental profile by 4 pixels .",
    "the above measured width thus corresponds to an intrinsic temperature @xmath33k , which is a very plausible average value for the earth exosphere temperature .",
    "we note that this consistency test is all the more significant as the geocoronal emission line only shows up in the final co - added sub - exposures .",
    "therefore , the procedure used for co - addition produces a sharp line profile in which the echelle - a spectral resolution is kept at its highest nominal value .",
    "each exposure was preceded by a special platinum lamp calibration which allowed us to calculate the residual shift left by the standard cal - hrs calibration procedure .",
    "together with the oversampling mode , this correction allowed us to reach an absolute calibration accuracy of @xmath341.5  in radial velocity .",
    "hereafter , the radial velocities will be given in the heliocentric rest frame .",
    "the different spectral lines were normalized to a continuum of unity by a polynomial whose degree , typically @xmath35 , was chosen according to a cross - validation statistical procedure .",
    "the normalized spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ ni ] , fig .",
    "[ oi ] , fig .",
    "[ siii ] and fig .",
    "[ siiii ] .",
    "since the continuum level is determined to high precision , we do not need to take into account any continuum fitting parameters in the line fitting .",
    "the  line was not normalized in this way , as the stellar continuum is a lorentzian profile , with a deep core ; the stellar continuum at  is described at length later .",
    "finally , in the case of the  line ( 1206 ) , we decided to keep in the spectrum the nearby signature of the photospheric   stellar line on the red wing of the interstellar  line ( see fig .",
    "[ siiii ] ) .",
    "this photospheric line was thus fitted along with the interstellar features as an additional component .",
    "this gave access to an independent evaluation of the intrinsic shift of the white dwarf photospheric features , a parameter that is also involved in our final analysis of the deuterium and hydrogen  profiles .",
    "we first evaluate the number of components present on the line of sight .",
    "this number represents a minimum number of components since blends are always possible .",
    "figure  [ components ] illustrates all species ( excluding  and ) observed with the echelle - a spectrograph .",
    "it is clear , from the  and  profiles , that at least two clearly resolved components are present . in the  line",
    ", the strongest component falls in between the other two seen in  and .",
    "this can not be due to an incorrect absolute calibration of one of the spectral ranges , as we observed the  line at 1206  together with the  line at 1201  in the same exposure . the relative shift between these two species , from one end of the detector to the other , should certainly be less than 0.5  .",
    "this  component is thus real , and obviously more ionized than the other two .",
    "a broad component is also detected in  at the edge of the observed spectral range . when fitted with a single absorption feature , assuming that the broadening is thermal ,",
    "the corresponding temperature is of order 30000  k , _",
    "i.e. _ much broader than clouds usually seen in the local ism .",
    "because its heliocentric velocity is @xmath36 , it is reasonable to assume that this line is of photospheric origin . indeed , as shown in vidal - madjar _ et al . _",
    "( 1994 ) , photospheric features in g191-b2b  are relatively broad and their observed heliocentric velocities are @xmath37 .",
    "predictions of the strength of the  photospheric line are also in agreement with the observations .",
    "we thus do not include this feature in our study .",
    "the  profile confirms , through profile fitting , the need for a third insterstellar component , located in between the two components seen in  and .",
    "the  signature of this third component is mainly the flatness of the absorption in the saturated core .",
    "we also note that there is no component around 29 in the other lines , consistent with the photospheric interpretation of the broad  feature .      in order to properly evaluate the strength of the different ism components contributing to the observed absorption ,",
    "it is extremely important to evaluate the level of the zero flux which may be slightly erroneous in an echelle spectrograph , due to the diffuse light produced from the adjacent spectral orders .",
    "the case of  is obvious as the broad saturated core allows us to accurately determine for the zero level .",
    "we corrected the  region for this zero level by subtracting the flux in the  core from the whole line profile .",
    "correcting for the zero level in the ghrs data reduction pipeline is indeed difficult for other species , as it depends on instrumental parameters as well as on the ( unknown ) spectrum shape in adjacent orders .",
    "thus , for species other than , we determined the zero level as the best fit value , _",
    "i.e. _ the one corresponding to a minimum @xmath38 , of all , , , and  lines fitted simultaneously . in each @xmath38 calculation as a function of the zero level , the same zero level value was adopted for the  and  lines , and for the  and  lines , since these pairs were observed in the same sub - exposures . in each case , only the  and  lines contributed significantly to determining the zero level values , as the lines of  and  are too weak .",
    "the  lines are sensitive to the zero level as the strongest line is almost saturated , and because these lines form a triplet and their measured relative strengths depend on the zero level . for our data normalized to unity , the value and the error bar of the  and  zero levels is : @xmath39 , _ i.e. _ consistent with zero level within the accuracy of our measurement . since the  line is saturated , the zero level position is sharply defined .",
    "the measured value of the zero level , for both  and  lines , is : @xmath40 .",
    "theses values will be used from now on in our analysis and their impact on the evaluated parameters will be considered as minor in the forthcoming study and checked in few specific cases .",
    "it is well known that the limiting factor of an accurate  ratio measurement is generally the measurement of the  column density itself , as the  line at  is not saturated for n()@xmath412 . in the present case , n ( ) can be measured with good accuracy from the damping wings of the  profile . however , we first need to model the stellar continuum , as the lorentzian shape of the intrinsic  photospheric line may mimic interstellar damping wings , and affect the n ( ) measurement .",
    "we thus calculated  profiles from lte atmosphere models using the appropriate stellar parameters .",
    "another lte profile , as well as nlte calculations , both using codes completely different from ours , were kindly provided by stefan dreizler .",
    "a qualitative difference between these profiles is that lte profiles are not as sharp and deep as nlte profiles .    in our analysis ,",
    "the different possible continuum were considered ( see fig .",
    "[ lyadatacont ] ) in order to evaluate the possible systematic error one could make on the total  evaluation .    the heliocentric radial velocity of g191-b2b  photospheric lines ( including gravitational redshift ) is known to be @xmath42  from ground based observations ( reid and wegner 1988 ) . from our cycle 1",
    "observations , we measured a differential velocity @xmath43  compared to the nearby interstellar lines ( vidal - madjar _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 ) ; this shift was however evaluated from medium resolution data in which the ism components were not resolved . in the present high resolution",
    "echelle - a data , the photospheric  line falls at a radial velocity @xmath44 .",
    "this line is however located at the end of our spectral range , and the profile shape may be partially distorted , inducing a shift in the measured velocity .",
    "we also tentatively identified six fe  v and six ni  v photospheric lines in the 13001306  region , whose average location gives a radial velocity @xmath45 .",
    "all these measurements are in good agreement , and their weighted least square average results in a radial velocity ( including gravitational redshift ) : @xmath46 . with a gravitational redshift of order @xmath47  ( finley _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) , the radial velocity of g191-b2b  itself is thus of order @xmath48 a typical value for an object in the local galactic environment .    with this information",
    ", we produced different data sets for the  line , each corresponding to the normalization of the observed data by a theoretical stellar continuum .",
    "from now on , we fix the radial velocity of the stellar profile at 29 . finally , we defined an additional ``  photospheric profile '' with a second order polynomial , in order to circumvent any assumption made about the shape of the profile itself .",
    "this polynomial continuum is derived by fitting to the far wings of the interstellar line in the ranges 1213.6 - 1213.9   and 1217.0 - 1217.3   ( see fig .",
    "[ lyadatacont ] ) .",
    "in fact , we found that the best solution ( minimum 2 ) was obtained for this second order polynomial further corrected by a fourth order polynomial in the core of the line , the latter being fitted together with the interstellar  line .",
    "we now have four different profiles , hence four normalized data sets . from these",

    "several comments can be made at this stage .",
    "we note that the theoretical continua have very well defined shapes , with abrupt features in their profile at various points near the core .",
    "when the interstellar absorption is superimposed , mismatches could be introduced in the resulting final profile . however , as shown in fig .",

    "this means that the @xmath97 , of order 100 , in favor of the @xmath51 order continuum , is mostly intrinsic to the lte29 profile .",
    "the above fits also reveal that lte continua are generally favored ( in terms of 2 ) when compared to nlte continua .",
    "this is illustrated by the fact that a 4@xmath66 order correction plus the nlte profile tends to the lte continuum ( see fig .  [ lyacont1 - 4 ] ) .",

    "may partly be due to the fact that we compare pure hydrogen models only .",
    "g191-b2b is well - known to contain significant amounts of heavy metals , which are visible in high - resolution uv spectra and which even completely dominate the euv spectrum ( _ e.g. _ , wolff _",
    "1998 ) . taking into account the blanketing effect of these metals",
    "leads to a decrease of the effective temperature by about 5000 k , and may also lead to a better agreement of nlte profiles with the observations .",
    "these details are , however , inconsequential for the present study .    in summary ,",
    "these 2  analyses give two main results : the @xmath98 order polynomial is largely favored over the theoretical continua ; it is also supported by the absolute 2  value , with a reduced 2  close to unity .",
    "we can thus conclude that this continuum offers a very good approximation to the actual stellar continuum of g191-b2b , and we adopt this for our determination of the ( d / h ) ratio .",
    "when we include all other species in the profile fitting , we obtain the same result , namely that the @xmath98 order polynomial continuum is very largely favored over the other theoretical continua .",
    "although all subsequent profile fittings were also carried out for these continua , we will not refer to them any more .",
    "finally , we also checked that the presence of more than 3 components on the line of sight does not change these results . indeed , repeating the same procedure with 4 components led to results that are nearly identical to those of the 3 cloud solution , in terms of total  and  column densities .",
    "given these considerations , we study the relative variation of the 2  as a function of the total  ratio , in order to derive confidence intervals on this quantity , according to the so - called @xmath97 method . strictly speaking",
    ", this method is exact for gaussian quantities , and , more generally , correct up to second order in the variation of the parameters . the @xmath99 confidence level around a given parameter",
    "should then be reached when the 2  of the fit with the parameter fixed to this @xmath100 value becomes equal to @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is the total best - fit 2 with the parameter left as free .",
    "the @xmath103 level is obtained for @xmath104 , _ etc .. _. however , this assumes that the quantities are gaussian , that the data points ( pixel values ) are uncorrelated , and that their error bars are accurately known . we prefer to relax these assumptions , and set the threshold for an `` effective '' @xmath99 level at @xmath105 .",
    "this provides a _ very _ conservative and _ very _ safe range of errors . in particular",
    ", we note that this procedure has the great advantage of including in the error bars so - derived all errors on other parameters that would have to be propagated and projected on the parameter under study . in effect",
    ", when looking for a 2  value for a given value of the parameter , away from the best fit value , the profile fitting tends to accomodate the values of the other parameters so as to obtain the smallest 2 hence the smallest @xmath97 .",
    "this is especially important when different parameters are strongly correlated , _",
    "e.g. _ column densities anti - correlated with broadening parameters , or column densities correlated with other column densities .",
    "however , we note that , strictly speaking , this method can only be applied to statistical errors , and not to systematic errors , which tend to add linearly , rather than quadratically .",
    "since this method is cpu time expensive , we only use to determine error bars on  ratios .",
    "for other quantities , that do not constitute our primary concern , we will quote error bars estimates obtained through trial and error .",
    "here , from the variations of the 2  as a function of the  ratio , we obtain , for three components , and a unique  ratio :    ( ) @xmath106  =  @xmath107 .    in the above , uncertainties arising from the choice of the stellar continuum are included in the quoted error bars , because of the simultaneous fitted @xmath108 order correction to the continuum .",

    "this means , more precisely , that we define one velocity , one temperature , and one turbulent broadening for each cloud ; the column densities of the various species are also free parameters .",

    "i.e. _ they represent a rough estimate of the actual error bar ; this is however sufficient for our present purpose .    among these physical parameters , the radial velocities and",
    "the column densities are the best determined , as would be expected .",
    "the temperature and turbulent broadening are indeed slightly degenerate as the mass separation between these species is insufficient .",
    "we note that the radial velocities are determined to a high degree of confidence in the spectral regions where they are resolved , _ e.g. _  for component 2 , and , , and  for components 1 and 3 , due to the large number of sampling points on the profile .",
    "( we recall that the components are numbered from 1 to 3 in order of increasing radial velocity ) .",
    "the error on the estimate of their radial velocity is dominated , in a given spectral region , by the calibration accuracy @xmath131 . when averaged over all spectral regions ,",
    "the accuracy should thus be of order @xmath132 .",
    "the relative shifts in radial velocity between the various components are not affected by the absolute calibration accuracy ; their error bars are however of order @xmath133but will be greatly improved later .",
    "we obtained these error bars by performing fits to all species but one , each species being excluded in turn , and averaging the resulting radial velocities and their shifts .",
    "it is especially important to note the radial velocity of the third component , @xmath134 .",
    "this component is identified with the local interstellar cloud ( lic ) in which the sun is embedded ( _ e.g. _ , lallement & bertin 1992 ; bertin _ et al . _ 1995 ) .",
    "this cloud has been detected in the direction of nearly all nearby stars , and its velocity vector relative to the solar system was found to be :    v@xmath135 l@xmath136(lic)@xmath137    b@xmath136(lic)@xmath138 .",
    "this component is actually the only absorbing cloud detected toward capella , whose line of sight is only separated by @xmath139 from the g191-b2b  line of sight .",
    "the projections of the lic velocity on the capella and g191-b2b  lines of sight are respectively 21.96 , and 20.26 .",
    "we therefore obtain a radial velocity in excellent agreement with the prediction .",
    "this value is of importance as it allows us to check the consistency of our approach : we expect to detect this component , and we know its predicted velocity within the calibration internal error @xmath132 .",
    "taking into account the appearance of the lic in four spectral domains ( , , , and ) , we conclude that we actually well detected and correctly identified it with component 3 . from now on ,",
    "we thus refer to this component as the lic .",
    "finally , we note that the column density ratios between the components are relatively close to 1 .",
    "this is illustrated in the following table ( from the blue to the red the components are noted 1 , 2 and lic ; component 1 is used as the reference ) :    [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      +    this also provides another consistency check .",

    ", we adopted a unique s / n ratio for the whole continuum ( calculated as the average over all pixels in the continuum ) , and derived error bars for all pixels using this value of the s / n ratio in the continuum , weighted by the flux of the pixel , and combined quadratically with the background noise .",
    "therefore , the variation of the s / n ratio in the continuum , from pixel to pixel , renders our 2  analysis less meaningful in this case . in any case",

    "these two components may however constitute differents parts of a shocked structure , with a velocity separation of @xmath255  as projected on the g191-b2b  line of sight .",
    "this will be discussed somewhere else .",
    "it is interesting to note that the n()/n ( ) ratio of the lic has also been evaluated by gry & dupin ( 1998 ) in the direction of @xmath21  cma .",

    "more observations are needed to clarify this point .",
    "on the basis of a simple model that calculates the ionization equilibrium between  and  ( dupin and gry 1998 ) , and assuming @xmath257()=@xmath258 , we converted the /  ratios listed in table 7 into hydrogen ionization ratios , n()/n ( ) , using the most recent value of n()@xmath259 ( puyoo & benjaffel 1998 )",

    "apparently , this estimate of the electron density of the lic is much lower than a measurement obtained toward capella using the ground and excited state lines of cii ( wood & linsky 1997 ) : @xmath267@xmath266 .",
    "this discrepancy could be explained by arguing that the ionization in the lic is far out of equilibrium , due for example to a shock ionizing event , which would tend to enhance the current electron density ( lyu & bruhweiler 1996 ) .    we can also use silicon to probe the degree of depletion in the three components , as it is more sensitive than oxygen or nitrogen .",
    "we find a total nitrogen to neutral hydrogen ratio averaged over the three components of @xmath268 , _",
    "i.e. _ a factor two smaller than the cosmic value , @xmath269 ( per @xmath241 hydrogen atoms ) .",
    "therefore , provided the ionization of hydrogen is small , as our calculations seem to indicate , depletion remains relatively weak .",
    "this conclusion can be seemingly applied to the three components individually , or at least for 1 + 2 and the lic , as inspection of table  [ species ] reveals .",
    "this low depletion is similar to the one observed in hot ism clouds or in the galactic halo ( see _ e.g. _ spitzer and fitzpatrick , 1993 , 1995 ; fitzpatrick and spitzer , 1994 , 1997 ; jenkins and wallerstein , 1996 ; savage and sembach , 1996 ) as well as in the so called `` cma tunnel '' ( gry _ et al .",

    "the comparison between the measured radial velocities of the components and the systemic radial velocity of g191-b2b , @xmath270 , shows that none of these clouds seems to be associated with the star .",
    "in particular , the association of any of these clouds with an expansion shell centered on the star is precluded as the clouds have larger radial velocities than g191-b2b .",
    "a detailed discussion of the physical properties is clearly beyond the scope of the present work",

    "( 1990 ) comes through the modeling of the atmosphere of g191-b2b  with homogeneous atmosphere models .",
    "their analysis might thus be questioned in view of the recent detection of non - negligible amounts of highly ionized metallic species ( nv , fev , siiv ) in this photosphere ( see vidal - madjar _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 ) , although trace of metallic species are not believed to contribute significantly to the absorption over 500 .",
    "we find a total  column density in perfect agreement with that found by bruhweiler & kondo ( 1982 ) , and the difference between the n ( ) values is directly related to the difference found in the relationship n()n ( ) between our observations and that of ferlet ( 1981 ) on different lines of sight .",
    "our results lead us to the following statement : either the  ratio is constant in the local ism , its value is 1.12@xmath275 , and the estimate made in the direction of capella by l95 is incorrect ; or , the  ratio does vary in the local ism .",
    "if this latter hypothesis is verified , we need to check whether the  ratio can vary within a same cloud , the lic , which is common to both the capella and the g191-b2bline of sight , or whether it varies on larger spatial scales , from cloud to cloud .",
    "it thus seems reasonable to re - analyze the evaluation made by l93 , l95 with the same techniques that we used to derive the  ratio toward g191-b2b .",
    "this we do now .",
    "the capella high resolution ghrs echelle - a data are of high quality , with a spectral resolution @xmath276 , and a signal - to - noise ratio s / n@xmath277 at the interstellar  line continuum . for this star ,",
    "the accuracy on the estimate of the  ratio is limited by the ability to reconstruct the  stellar emission profile of capella , all the more since it is composed of the combined profiles of the two cool stars of the binary system .",
    "l95 circumvented this problem by observing capella at two different phases , and were thus able to reconstruct , at least partly , both stellar continua .",
    "as our paper is not dedicated to the study of this line of sight , we only summarize our study of the capella data set , and jump to the conclusions . in order to model the stellar continuum , we used two different approaches , in the same spirit as section 3.1 : in the first approach , we used the stellar continuum produced by l95 , and in the other , we constructed a stellar profile in a very naive manner , by interpolating the far wings of the emission profile with a @xmath278 degree polynomial .",
    "this latter polynomial would then be further corrected in the core by a @xmath108 order polynomial . in all our fits",
    ", we found that the continuum found by l95 was the most appropriate in terms of 2  statistics , and hence we will not refer to this @xmath279 order polynomial continuum anymore .",
    "l95 detected only one component on the line of sight , from the analysis of the narrow metal lines of mgii and feii .",
    "we followed these authors and proceeded to the profile fitting with only one component on the line of sight .",
    "a first analysis gave results in agreement with their work , although we find n()@xmath2802 , in disagreement with the original estimate of l95 , n()@xmath2812 .",
    "it probably results from a slight mismatch in the radial velocity of the  and  lines , with a shift of @xmath282  for the  line away from the expected position , to be compared with an error on the radial velocity of only @xmath283 . whereas our  and  lines automatically have the same radial velocity , l95 did not link the radial velocities of the  and of the  absorbers",
    "nevertheless , this seems to point to the existence of another component , that would perturb the line but not the  line .",
    "wood & linsky ( 1998 ) did mention that such a perturbation should be present , and due to the absorption by the hydrogen atoms in the earth geocorona , which , at the time of the observations , was located in velocity space a @xmath284 .",
    "this absorption is shown in fig .",
    "[ cap3cloud ] .",
    "when we attempt a fit with a two component solution , we obtain a better 2  with a @xmath285 , a dramatic improvement indeed . in this two component solution , we left both components entirely free .",
    "interestingly enough , we obtained two kinds of solution : in both cases , the main component was extremely similar to the single component ( lic ) of l95 ; in one case , however , the extra absorption was caused by a cold , _",
    "i.e. _ small broadening component , located around @xmath286 ; in a second case , slightly favored over the previous one , in terms of 2 , we obtained a hot component , with @xmath287k , located around @xmath288 .",
    "our profile fitting algorithm indeed works by random minimization , and can therefore find different degenerate solutions for a same dataset . since both of these extra components fall at smaller radial velocities than the lic , they produce a shift of the  absorption , and reconcile the overall radial velocities of both  and  lines .",
    "since we know that the geocorona has to be present , we performed a three cloud solution , with all parameters free .",

    "the third absorber , to be understood in terms of increasing radial velocity , at a heliocentric velocity @xmath302 , is identified with the local interstellar cloud in which the sun is embedded .",
    "the network of constraints on these clouds , that results from the profile fitting of the different interstellar lines , is such that we can derive the temperature and the turbulent velocities in the different interstellar components , as well as the column densities of the various observed species .",

    "however , this comes at the expense of a much smaller average  ratio in components 1 and 2 , of order @xmath7 , in such a way that the  ratio averaged over all three components remains at the above value @xmath305 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the ratio indeed varies in the local ism over a few parsecs and at least from interstellar cloud to interstellar cloud . although we do not detect variations of the ( d / h ) ratio within the local interstellar cloud itself , such variations may become clear as more data are analyzed . here",
    ", we note that both clouds 1 and 2 are more like  regions while the local interstellar cloud could be identified with an  region ; this ionization difference might point to the cause of this ( d / h ) variation .",
    "these large variations of the ism  ratio in so small scales can not be due to any nuclear processes ( spallation processes induced by cosmic rays or by huge gamma ray fluxes ) occuring in that medium .",
    "we mention here two other possibilities :    ( i)- given the fact that the column density is only of the order of a few @xmath3062  the lowest  value could be due to the admixture of a comparable amount of d - free , pure h remnant of a material within the considered cloud .      as a rule ,",
    "it is much easier to deplete than to create deuterium . in this case , just as in the two possibilities mentioned above , the lowest ism  values would be due to a secondary effect , and the highest value would be more representative of an actual ism  ratio .",
    "however , nothing precludes the capella value from being itself affected by such a secondary effect .",
    "moreover , we point out that the deuterium abundance may be locally enhanced ( or depleted ) when the radiation flux is anisotropic , as the radiation pressure acts differently on  and  ( vidal - madjar _ et al . _ 1978 ; bruston _ et al .",
    "_ 1981 ) .    to sum up the consequences of the present investigation , the question concerning the existence or not of variations of the ratio in the ism has now an answer : variations do exist within the local ism of order @xmath307 within a few parsecs , and/or within a given cloud , the local interstellar cloud . to be more precise ,",
    "our observations show that the average ( d / h ) ratio on the line of sight to g191-b2b  ( averaged over three interstellar components ) , is significantly different from the ( d / h ) ratio measured toward capella .",
    "although the local interstellar cloud is common to both lines of sight , we do not find conclusive evidence for variation of the ( d / h ) ratio in this particular component .",
    "the comparisons between the theoretical predictions of standard big - bang nucleosynthesis combined with those coming from the recent models of chemical evolution of deuterium and the measured  ratios in the different components of these lines of sight appear to be more complex to establish .",
    "forthcoming analyses will have now to take into account these  variations and should discuss more thoroughly some of the possibilities envisaged above .",

    "( i ) _ further observations of the interstellar deuterium abundance on other nearby lines of sight . in this respect ,",

    "<S> we re - analyze the ghrs data of the capella line of sight , and confirm their estimate , as we find ( ) @xmath5 in the local interstellar cloud in which the solar system is embedded . </S>",
    "<S> this shows that the  ratio varies by at least @xmath6 within the local interstellar medium .    </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the local interstellar cloud is also detected toward g191-b2b , and we show that the  ratio in this component , toward g191-b2b , can be made compatible with that derived toward capella . </S>",
    "<S> however , this comes at the expense of a much smaller value for the  ratio as averaged over the other two components , of order @xmath7 , and in such a way that the  ratio as averaged over all three components remains at the above value , _ i.e. _ ( ) @xmath8 .    </S>",
    "<S> we thus conclude that , either the  ratio varies from cloud to cloud , and/or the  ratio varies within the local interstellar cloud , in which the sun is embedded , although our observations neither prove nor disprove this latter possibility . </S>"
