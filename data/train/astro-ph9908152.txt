    "<S> we investigate the hypothesis that the scalar field is the dark matter and the dark energy in the cosmos , wich comprises about 95the universe . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this hypothesis explains quite well the recent observations on type ia supernovae .    </S>",
    "<S> 2    there are really few questions in science more interesting than that of finding out which is the nature of the matter composing the universe . </S>",
    "<S> it is amazing that after so much effort dedicated to such question , what is the universe composed of ? , it has not been possible to give a conclusive answer . from the latest observations </S>",
    "<S> , we do know that about 95% of matter in the universe is of non baryonic nature . </S>",
    "<S> the old belief that matter in cosmos is made of quarks , leptons and gauge bosons is being abandoned due to the recent observations and the inconsistences which spring out of this assumption @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> now we are convinced on the existence of an exotic non baryonic sort of matter which dominates the structure of the universe , but its nature is until now a puzzle .    </S>",
    "<S> recent observations of the luminosity - redshift relation of ia supernovae suggest that distant galaxies are moving slower than predicted by hubble s law , that is , an accelerated expansion of the universe seems to hold @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , measurements of the cosmic background radiation and the mass power spectrum also suggest that the universe has the preferable value @xmath0 there should exist a kind of missing anti - gravitational matter possessing a negative pressure @xmath1 @xcite which should overcome the enormous gravitational forces between galaxies </S>",
    "<S> . moreover , the interaction with the rest of  the matter should be very weak to pass unnoticed at the solar system level . </S>",
    "<S> these observations are without doubt among the most important discoveries of the end of the last century , they gave rise to the idea that the components of the universe are matter and vacuum energy @xmath2 models such as the quintessence ( a slow varying scalar field ) imply @xmath3 and the one using a cosmological constant , requiring @xmath4 appear to be strong candidates to be such missing energy , because both of them satisfy an equation of state concerning an accelerated behavior of the universe @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> observations in galaxy clusters and dynamical measurements of the mass in galaxies indicate that @xmath5 , ( see for example @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> observations of ia supernovae indicate that @xmath6 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these observations are in very good concordance with the preferred value @xmath7  everything seems to agree . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the matter component @xmath8 decomposes itself in baryons , neutrinos , etc . and  </S>",
    "<S> dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> it is observed that stars and dust ( baryons ) represent something like @xmath9 of  the whole matter of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> the new measurements of the neutrino mass indicate that neutrinos contribute with about the same quantity as matter . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> say @xmath10 , where @xmath11 represents the dark matter part of the matter contributions which has a value @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> this  value of the amount of baryonic matter is in concordance with the limits imposed by nucleosynthesis ( see for example @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> but we do not know the nature neither of the dark matter @xmath11 nor of the dark energy @xmath13  we do not know what is the composition of @xmath14 , @xmath15 , the @xmath16 of the whole matter in the universe .    in a previous work two of us have shown that the scalar field is a strong candidate to be the dark matter in spiral galaxies @xcite . using the hipothesis that the scalar field is the dark matter in galaxies </S>",
    "<S> , we were able to reproduce the rotation curves profile of stars going around spiral galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> in fact the scalar potential arising for the explanation of rotation curves of galaxies is exponential . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , by using a monte carlo simulation , hurterer and turner have been able to reconstruct an exponential potential for quintessence which brings the universe into an accelerating epoch @xcite . in this last work </S>",
    "<S> there is no explanation for the nature of dark matter , it is taken the value @xmath12 without further comments . </S>",
    "<S> recently , there are other papers where the late time attractor solutions for the exponential potential are studied@xcite . if we are consistent with our previous work , this dark matter should be also of scalar nature representing the @xmath17 of the matter of the universe . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we show that the hypothesis that the scalar field is the dark matter and the dark energy of the universe is consistent with ia supernovae observations and it could imply that the scalar field is the dominant matter in the universe , determining its structure at a cosmological and at a galactic level . in other words , in this letter we demonstrate that the hypothesis that the scalar field represents more than @xmath16 of the matter in the universe is consistent with the recent observations on ia supernovae .    </S>",
    "<S> we assume universe is homogenous and isotropic , so we start with the frw metric @xmath18\\ ] ]    the equations governing a universe with a scalar field @xmath19 and a scalar potential @xmath20 are    @xmath21    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the density of the scalar field , @xmath24 is the density of the baryons , plus neutrinos , plus radiation , etc , and @xmath25 . in order to write the field equations ( [ cphi ] ) and ( [ fried ] ) in a more convenient form , we follow @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we define the function @xmath26 such that @xmath27 using the variable @xmath28 , we can find a first integral of the field equation ( [ cphi ] )    @xmath29    being @xmath30 an integration constant . when the scale factor is considered as the independent variable , it is possible to integrate the field equations up to quadratures @xcite    @xmath31 ^{1/2 } \\label{quad}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in order to compare the data obtained from the ia supernovae observations with a scalar field dominated universe , we write the magnitude - redshift relation @xcite    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the `` hubble - constant - free '' luminosity distance and @xmath34 is the `` hubble - constant - free '' b - band absolute magnitude at the maximum of a ia supernovae . </S>",
    "<S> the luminosity distance @xmath35 depends on the model we are working with . in what follows </S>",
    "<S> we compare the observational measurements obtained for @xmath36 with a theory defining a scalar field dominated universe . </S>",
    "<S> using equation ( [ firint ] ) , the luminosity distance which depends on the geometry and on the contents of the universe in the frw cosmology ( see for example @xcite ) , reads for our case    @xmath37    where    @xmath38    and    @xmath39    where @xmath40 labels for b ( baryonic ) , @xmath41 ( neutrinos ) , r ( radiation ) , etc . </S>",
    "<S> with equations of state @xmath42 for each component . if we rescale @xmath43 today , then @xmath44 , being @xmath45 the redshift . </S>",
    "<S> let us now compare the expression ( [ dl ] ) with the function used to fit sne ia measurements @xcite , with an equation of state @xmath46 for the unknown energy . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the luminosity distance is given by the equation ( [ dl ] ) with @xmath47 in place of @xmath48 where    @xmath49    observe that both expressions ( [ up ] ) and ( [ ux ] ) are very similar , the only differences are the integral term and the one containing the constant @xmath50 thus , this comparison extremely suggest that @xmath51 and @xmath52 , with @xmath53a constant .    within a good approximation </S>",
    "<S> , we can neglect the present contribution of density of baryons , neutrinos etc.,@xmath54 because their contribution represents less than @xmath55 of the matter of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> the next step is to determine which is the scalar field potential . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately a flat universe dominated by scalar field with the function @xmath56 has a very important property . </S>",
    "<S> we can enunciate this property in the following theorem :    * theorem 1 . </S>",
    "<S> * _ let @xmath57 with @xmath58 in a flat universe dominated by a scalar field . </S>",
    "<S> then the scalar field potential @xmath20 , is essentially exponential in the regions where the scalar energy density dominates . _    </S>",
    "<S> * proof : *    _ if the universe is flat , @xmath59 . from equation ( [ quad ] ) it follows that _    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath60    thus , if the scalar field dominates ( @xmath61 ) , this implies @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> then , it follows @xmath63 .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath64    this result strongly states that the scalar potential can only be exponential when the scalar field dominates with no other posibilities like `` power - law '' or `` cosine '' .    </S>",
    "<S> the theorem fulfills very well the present conditions of the universe with the hypothesis we are investigating . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we will take an exponential potential for the model of the universe , which implies an extraordinary concordance with the scalar potential used to explain the rotation curves of galaxies @xcite .    with the conditions @xmath51 and @xmath65 equations ( [ solll ] ) and ( [ firint ] ) are easily integrated for a flat universe . </S>",
    "<S> one obtains @xcite    @xmath66    where @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> the important quantities obtained from the solution in terms of the parameter @xmath68 are : the scalar field and the scalar potential    @xmath69    the energy density of the scalar field    @xmath70    the state equation of the scalar field    @xmath71 where @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> the scale factor    @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a normalization constant . the hubble parameter    @xmath75    and the deceleration parameter    @xmath76    according to the solution ( [ solution1 ] - [ solution2 ] ) , the expression for the luminosity distance now reads    @xmath77 ^{-\\frac{1}{2}}% \\left [ 1-(1+z)^{\\left ( 1-\\frac{1}{\\lambda } \\right ) } \\right ]   \\label{dist}\\ ] ]    where @xmath78 and we have rescaled @xmath43 today , for @xmath79 . fitting ( [ dist ] ) with the data of ia supernovae @xcite we find @xmath80 and @xmath81 for @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the critical density ( @xmath84 ) ( see fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : snia ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> now , we can calculate the deceleration parameter . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath85 , which really implies that the universe is accelerating . for the density of the scalar field </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath86 and for its equation of state @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> currently , we are investigating the cmbr and the mass power spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> see@xcite for a scalar field with equation of state @xmath88 and @xmath89 up to @xmath90 , where it is concluded that the scalar field fits all the required observations . </S>",
    "<S> if we use @xmath91 , we find :    @xmath92 @xmath93 would be the age of a universe that was always dominated by the scalar field , which is not our case .    </S>",
    "<S> the great concordance of our hypotheses with experimental results , suggests that the universe lies at this moment in a scalar field dominated epoch . </S>",
    "<S> this permits us to speculate about the behavior of the universe for red - shifts greater than @xmath94 as restricted by snia observations . </S>",
    "<S> observe that our results do not imply that the universe has been dominated by a scalar field during all its evolution . </S>",
    "<S> instead , our model accepts the possibility of a universe dominated by radiation or matter before the epoch we have analyzed . in order to draw a complete history of the universe , we consider the periods of radiation and matter dominated eras . </S>",
    "<S> a general integration of the conservation equation for a perfect fluid made of radiation ( dust ) , indicates that the density scales as @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) , with @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) . in the frw standard cosmology , </S>",
    "<S> the universe was radiation dominated until @xmath99 , the time when the density of radiation equals the density of matter . recalling our result @xmath100 , </S>",
    "<S> the universe changed to be matter dominated until @xmath101 , when the density of the scalar field equals the density of matter . at this time </S>",
    "<S> , the density of radiation is negligible . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to redshifts @xmath102 . </S>",
    "<S> the implications of this model are very strong . since this time ( approximately @xmath103 yr . </S>",
    "<S> ago for this model ) , the scalar field began to dominate the expansion of the universe and it enters in its actual acceleration phase , which includes most of the history of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> then we wonder if the scalar field is the responsible for the formation of structure too . </S>",
    "<S> according to @xcite , the formation of galaxies started at a few redshifts , from approximately 4.5 to 2 , just when the scalar field began to be important .    some final remarks . with our values , </S>",
    "<S> the solution is singular , i.e. , @xmath104 vanishes at some finite time . moreover , the solution has no particle horizon @xcite as can be seen from the expression ( [ solll ] ) because @xmath105 . </S>",
    "<S> the question why nature uses only spin 1 and spin 2 fundamental interactions over the simplest spin 0 interactions becomes clear with our result . </S>",
    "<S> this result tells us that in fact nature has preferred the spin 0 interaction over the other two and in such case , the scalar field should thus be the responsible of the cosmos structure . </S>"
