    "the importance of episodes of mass transfer in a semidetached binary on a thermal timescale has recently been emphasized in a number of contexts .",
    "such episodes can arise in either of two ways :    \\(i ) the donor star fills its roche lobe while already undergoing thermal expansion across the hertzsprung gap , or    \\(ii ) the donor fills its roche lobe with a mass ratio @xmath0 ( @xmath1 denotes the donor mass , @xmath2 the accretor mass ) large enough that the roche lobe radius @xmath3 shrinks on mass transfer more rapidly than the thermal equilibrium radius @xmath4 ( where this exists ) appropriate to the donor s current mass @xmath1 .    in case ( i )",
    "the thermal  timescale episode will end once the donor attains a new thermal equilibrium radius , e.g. at some point after reaching the hayashi line . in case ( ii )",
    "the donor is continually trying to expand thermally beyond @xmath3 in order to reach @xmath5 , so mass is transferred on a thermal timescale while this condition holds .",
    "generally this case involves shrinkage of the orbit to some minimum roche lobe size , followed by orbital expansion as the mass ratio @xmath6 reverses .",
    "the thermal  timescale episode ends only when @xmath7 ( cf .",
    "[ fig : rrm2 ] ; see also van den heuvel 1992 and references therein ) .",
    "thereafter normal mass transfer continues driven either by systemic angular momentum losses ( descreasing @xmath3 ) or nuclear evolution of the donor ( increasing @xmath8 ) .",
    "case ( i ) arises in the formation of intermediate  mass x ",
    "ray binaries with black  hole accretors , such as gro  j165540 ( kolb et al . , 1997 ; kolb , 1998 ) .",
    "( in similar systems with neutron ",
    "star accretors , such as cyg x2 , the condition for case ( ii ) may hold simultaneously  king & ritter , 1999 ; podsiadlowski & rappaport , 2000 , kolb et al . , 2000 ; tauris et al . , 2000 ) . in this paper",
    "we are mainly concerned with case ( ii ) .",
    "this has received most attention in connection with the supersoft x  ray binaries ( van den heuvel et al . , 1992 ) .",
    "timescale mass transfer from a donor initially on or close to the main sequence , on to a white dwarf accretor , offers a way of driving accretion rates @xmath9 high enough to allow steady nuclear burning . as well as potentially explaining the observed supersoft systems , this process allows the white dwarf mass @xmath2 to grow .",
    "if one can arrange that @xmath2 reaches the chandrasekhar mass @xmath10 this suggests a way of making type ia supernovae .",
    "however the difficulty of computing mass transfer on these timescales meant that early studies of this process simply used the assumption that mass transfer occurred on a thermal timescale , and were therefore unable to predict the evolution of the binary parameters ( masses , period , mass transfer rate ) .",
    "detailed calculations of these have only recently begun to emerge ( deutschmann , 1998 ) but are not yet exhaustive .",
    "( full line ) and @xmath3 ( broken line ) versus @xmath1 for case a mass transfer , after giannone , kohl & weigert ( 1968 ) . while the roche lobe curve varies significantly with initial wd mass @xmath11 and the specification of mass transfer ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) , @xmath8 depends only very little on the evolutionary state along the main sequence ( indicated by the central hydrogen content @xmath14 ) .",
    "timescale mass transfer may occur until the two curves intersect which happens at different @xmath1 depending on a particular choice of @xmath3 . ]",
    "discussion of the evolution of supersoft x  ray binaries would be greatly eased if observation provided reliable masses .",
    "however this is very difficult for several reasons .",
    "for example greiner et al .",
    "( 2000 ) suggest rather low masses @xmath15 for the short  period system rx  j0537.77034 we shall discuss extensively in this paper . but these and similar estimates use the assumption that the donor is close to the main sequence . by definition",
    "this can not be true in thermal  timescale mass transfer , since the star is not in thermal equilibrium ; although it may be quite close to its main  sequence radius , it can also be considerably smaller than this ( cf .",
    "deutschmann , 1998 ) .",
    "moreover greiner et al.s mass function uses the heii emission line , and thus may not reflect the dynamical motion of the accretor .",
    "since mass information is so hard to come by , a crucial test for the thermal  timescale model for the supersoft x  ray binaries is provided by the discovery of systems with fairly short orbital periods . in particular rx  j0537.77034",
    "( greiner et al . , 2000 ) has a period of about 3.5  hr , and 1e0035.4 - 7230 (= smc13 ) ( schmidtke et al . , 1996 ) has a period of 4.126  hr .",
    "since the initial mass ratio @xmath16 must be @xmath17 for this type of evolution ( see below ) , one expects initial donor star masses @xmath18 for a typical white dwarf accretor , and thus an initial orbital period @xmath19  hr ( see section 3 and fig .",
    "[ fig : mpm1 ] ) . evidently considerable orbital shrinkage would be needed for such systems to reach the periods of rx  j0537.77034 and 1e0035.4 - 7230 .",
    "this is unlikely if the mass transfer is conservative , as we shall show .",
    "however it is probable that much of the transferred mass is not accreted by the white dwarf , but blown away from it as a wind ( e.g. li & van den heuvel , 1997 ) , allowing greater orbital shrinkage .",
    "mass loss induced in some way by the mass transfer process is probably the only way of significantly increasing the orbital shrinkage , as other angular momentum loss processes such as magnetic braking or gravitational radiation generally take place on timescales far longer than the @xmath20  yr characteristic of mass transfer in the supersoft x  ray binaries .    in this paper",
    "we consider thermal  timescale mass transfer and investigate how much mass loss from the accretor is required if rx  j0537.77034 and 1e0035.4 - 7230 are products of the standard picture of the supersoft binaries .",
    "our method is to compute the minimum orbital period analytically for specified rates of mass and angular momentum loss from the binary .",
    "we consider the orbital evolution of a semidetached binary in which a fixed fraction @xmath21 of the mass transferred from the donor ( star 2 ) is lost from the accretor ( star 1 ) with @xmath13 times the specific angular momentum of the latter .",
    "( the quantity @xmath21 is called @xmath22 by king & kolb , 1995 in their general treatment of such ` consequential angular momentum loss ' [ caml ] mechanisms ; the use of @xmath12 allows more compact formulae in what follows . ) following the general method of van teeseling & king ( 1998 ) , setting their quantities @xmath23 , we find @xmath24 so that @xmath25 these definitions give @xmath26 with @xmath27 .",
    "kepler s 3rd law links angular momentum @xmath28 and period @xmath29 of the orbit as @xmath30 the evolution of the orbital period then obeys @xmath31 from ( [ m ] ) we have @xmath32 , with @xmath33 , where @xmath34 are the initial values of the two masses . thus ( [ rldot ] ) integrates to @xmath35 for @xmath36 , the corresponding expression for @xmath37 being given by the limit of this expression as @xmath38 , while we get the well  known result @xmath39 for conservative mass transfer , i.e. @xmath40 . in terms of the mass ratio @xmath0 we can express the relation between @xmath1 and @xmath2 as @xmath41 leading to @xmath42 thus with @xmath43 , etc , ( [ p0 ] ) gives finally @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the initial period .    as a check",
    "we note that if all the transferred mass is blown away from star 1 , with the specific angular momentum of that star , we have @xmath46 ; we take the limit of ( [ p ] ) as @xmath47 by noting that @xmath48 $ ] and using lhpital s rule on the exponent to give the limit as @xmath38 as @xmath49 .",
    "we then get @xmath50 or @xmath51 $ ] , as found by e.g. king & ritter ( 1999 ) for this case .",
    "we are interested in the minimum orbital period attained during the binary evolution .",
    "regarding @xmath29 in ( [ p ] ) as a function of @xmath6 , i.e. with @xmath52 fixed , we find @xmath53 so that @xmath29 is an extremum at @xmath54 from ( [ dp ] ) we can show that @xmath55 at @xmath56 , so @xmath29 has a minimum there , assuming @xmath57 .",
    "hence for given @xmath52 , the smallest orbital period which can be attained in evolution with mass loss is given by ( [ p ] ) with @xmath56 . for a given initial period",
    ", we still have the freedom to vary the initial mass ratio @xmath16 .",
    "( this corresponds to the fact that the period @xmath45 essentially determines the donor s mean density , almost independently of the primary mass .",
    "so a donor of given initial mass @xmath58 may initiate mass transfer at various @xmath45 , depending on its evolutionary state , with different @xmath16 , determined by @xmath11 . ) for fixed @xmath45 , the minimum value of @xmath29 clearly has a _ maximum _ , regarded as a function of @xmath16 , at @xmath59 ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : pmpi_con ] which shows the special case @xmath60 ) .",
    "in other words , @xmath61 } < 0 $ ] .",
    "since @xmath6 decreases from its initial value @xmath16 through the evolution this means that given an initial period @xmath45 , the smallest value of the minimum period is given by the largest possible value @xmath62 of @xmath16 .",
    "hence given an initial period @xmath45 , the minimum possible orbital period @xmath63 is given by @xmath64 with @xmath65 given by ( [ qm ] ) , and @xmath62 the largest possible value of the initial mass ratio @xmath16 .",
    "although @xmath13 is of course irrelevant in the conservative case ( @xmath66 ) , larger angular momentum losses in the wind allow even smaller ratios @xmath67 for the same @xmath16 .",
    "it is likely that thermal",
    " timescale mass transfer is still going on at the minimum orbital period , since by roche geometry we have @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a slowly increasing function of @xmath6 given e.g.  by the approximation from eggleton ( 1983 ) .",
    "thus @xmath70 which tells us immediately that the period reaches its minimum value at larger mass ratios than @xmath3 as @xmath71 .",
    "in general @xmath3 initially shrinks much more rapidly than @xmath8 .",
    "thus the condition @xmath72 signalling the end of thermal  timescale mass transfer is reached only once @xmath3 is increasing after passing through its minimum value , i.e.  thermal timescale mass transfer usually stops only _",
    "after _ the minimum orbital period is reached .",
    "however it is conceivable that in some cases @xmath8 shrinks very rapidly on mass loss , and individual cases must be checked .",
    "for the purposes of this paper we note than the true minimum period for thermal  timescale could if anything be longer than the values of @xmath73 we find here .",
    "in what follows we will assume that @xmath60 , i.e. that the mass lost from the accretor has the same specific angular momentum as this star .",
    "this for example includes any form of mass loss from orbits with circular symmetry about the accretor , as might occur from an accretion disc . in this case",
    "( [ pm ] ) simplifies to @xmath74 with @xmath75 now given by @xmath76 and @xmath62 the largest possible value of the initial mass ratio @xmath16 .",
    "figure [ fig : pmpi_con ] shows the ratio @xmath67 as a function of @xmath16 for the two extreme cases @xmath77 .",
    "the work of the last section , especially eqn ( [ pm ] ) , shows that to compute the ratio @xmath78 of minimum to initial period we need to specify the largest possible value @xmath62 of the initial mass ratio .",
    "for a white  dwarf accretor the short observed periods of rx  j0537.77034 and 1e0035.4 - 7230 then constrain the mass  loss parameter @xmath12 . clearly to reach such short periods it is preferable to start from the shortest initial periods @xmath45 , which in turn are given by assuming that the donor is still very close to the zams when it initiates mass transfer .",
    "we can easily show that the initial donor mass @xmath58 must be @xmath79 in order to explain the 3.5  hr period of rx  j0537.77034 , by iterating the formula ( [ pm0 ] ) , using the fact that we must clearly have @xmath80 .",
    "for the lowest  mass white dwarf we consider ( @xmath81 ) this implies @xmath82 .",
    "thus in the conservative case @xmath66 we have @xmath83 , and fig .",
    "[ fig : mpm1 ] shows that @xmath84  hr for a zams star of this mass .",
    "we can now use fig .",

    "figure [ fig : mpm1 ] now shows that @xmath88  hr , and we may iterate using fig .",
    "[ fig : pmpi_con ] to get @xmath89 .",
    "further iteration fails , as figure [ fig : mpm1 ] shows that the new higher estimate for @xmath58 does not increase the estimate for @xmath45 . in a similar way we find @xmath90 for the other extreme case @xmath91",
    "this argument essentially fixes the minimum value of @xmath45 at about 10  hr ( see figure [ fig : mpm1 ] ) , so the orbital shrinkage required to explain the 3.5  hr period of rx  j0537.77034 has @xmath92 .",
    "given an initial white dwarf mass @xmath11 and mass ratio @xmath62 we can predict the period ratio @xmath67 for any given @xmath12 .",
    "the initial mass ratio @xmath62 must obey two constraints ( added as vertical lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : pmpi_con ] ) :     as a function of @xmath16 for @xmath77 according to ( [ pm0 ] ) .",
    "additional constraints for various initial wd masses resulting from the chandrasekhar limit are indicated by dashed lines in the conservative case .",
    "they mark the critical values of @xmath16 where the wd mass has grown to @xmath93 precisely upon reaching @xmath73 .",
    "an upper limit at @xmath94 due to delayed dynamical instability ( ddi ) is also indicated . ]     versus @xmath58 for different wd masses , where the lines indicate the main sequence boundaries",
    ". for initial donor star masses in the expected range between @xmath95 the short period edge (= zams ) lies at about 10  hr , and is fairly constant for @xmath96 .",
    "the additional line marks the terminal main sequence ( tms ) , more precisely the point of minimum @xmath97 ( where applicable ) . ]",
    "\\(i ) the system must avoid the ` delayed dynamical instability ' ( ddi ; see webbink , 1977 ; hjellming , 1989 ) , which occurs when sustained thermal ",
    "timescale mass transfer exposes inner layers with a flat entropy gradient , and    \\(ii ) the white dwarf mass can not exceed @xmath93 before the minimum period @xmath73 is reached .    in practice",
    "the first of these constraints requires @xmath98 . hjellming ( 1989 ) found this value for a donor with @xmath99 near the terminal main sequence ( tms ) , whereas kalogera & webbink ( 1996 ) seem to prefer even smaller limiting ratios around @xmath100 .",
    "kolb et al .  ( 2000 ) used mazzitelli s stellar code to calculate a test sequence with constant primary mass @xmath101 where mass transfer starts from a @xmath102 near  tms star .",
    "a ddi occured at donor mass @xmath103 , in perfect agreement with hjellming s prediction . the critical maximum mass ratio @xmath104 depends on the stellar structure , and therefore on the stellar input physics .",
    "in particular , @xmath104 is probably sensitive to the degree of convective core overshooting , as this determines the size of the convective core .",
    "this is highlighted by the fact that kolb et al .",
    "( 2000 ) find @xmath105 for early massive case b mass transfer , while tauris et al .",
    "( 2000 ) find @xmath106 , using an updated eggleton code .",

    "each panel of this figure shows :    \\1 . the horizontal line @xmath116 , i.e.  the upper limit required by rx  j0537.77034 .",
    "only those curves which actually manage to cross this line for @xmath117 .",
    "in particular we plot the curve for the limiting value of @xmath16 such that the curve just crosses @xmath116 at @xmath91 .",
    "this gives a lower limit on @xmath16 which is the same for each mass of the wd .",
    "\\3 . at some of the extreme solutions ,",
    "i.e. wherever the line @xmath116 is crossed before a sn occurs , the current values of @xmath118 are given .",
    "note that with growing @xmath11 the donor mass has to go up as well for the same @xmath16 . furthermore @xmath2 at the minimum period comes closer and closer to the chandrasekhar mass as we increase @xmath12 .",
    "figure [ fig : pmpi ] shows already that the short orbital period of rx  j0537.77034 poses very severe constraints if this system results from thermal  timescale mass transfer . in particular    \\(a ) conservative evolution ( @xmath40 ) is possible only for initial mass ratios @xmath119 which probably make the system vulnerable to the delayed dynamical instability .",
    "full evolutionary calculations are required to check if there are any evolutionary tracks which avoid it .",
    "if such tracks exist , the initial white dwarf mass in rx  j0537.77034 must have been low ( @xmath120 ) , but the current system masses must be fairly high ( e.g. @xmath121 requires @xmath122 ) .",
    "these are of course in conflict with the mass estimates of greiner et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , but this may not by itself be fatal ( see the remarks in the introduction ) .     and @xmath16 needed to obtain @xmath116 .",
    "the allowed range is limited to the small area above the curved line and below the horizontal ddi limit at @xmath94 .",
    "additional constraints are shown for various @xmath11 ( dashed lines ) .",
    "the upper limits to @xmath123 ( or @xmath124 ) result from the wd growing beyond its chandrasekhar mass before reaching @xmath73 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : pmpi ] and text for details .",
    "initially massive wds with @xmath125 restrict the allowed range to @xmath126 independently of ddi . ]",
    "\\(b ) non  conservative evolution ( @xmath127 ) does allow tracks with @xmath128 which probably avoid the delayed dynamical instability .",
    "however the ranges of @xmath12 and @xmath16 are still very tightly constrained .",
    "figure [ fig : pmpi ] shows that @xmath129 , @xmath130 , with @xmath12 and @xmath16 correlated as in figure [ fig : eta_q_rel ] . for @xmath131 @xmath12 has to be even lower , and generally upper limits on @xmath16 are given for each @xmath11 in addition to ddi .",
    "note that for the largest values of @xmath12 the white dwarf in rx  j0537.77034 is predicted to be close to the chandrasekhar limit unless the ddi limit imposes a more severe restriction than the lowest possible wd mass ( as is the case in fig .",
    "[ fig : eta_q_rel ] for @xmath132 ) .    even given these tight constraints ,",
    "the evolutions discussed above require the system to have come into contact with the donor still very close to the zams .",
    "as orbital angular momentum losses ( e.g. via magnetic braking ) are probably negligible for the likely initial masses @xmath133 , this also requires the initial orbital separation to lie in an extremely narrow range . evidently to make a system like rx  j0537.77034 or 1e0035.4 - 7230 by the thermal",
    " timescale route is a very rare event . in line with this , deutschmann ( 1998 ) found no orbital periods shorter than about 6  hr in his detailed calculations with solar metallicity .",
    "furthermore these requirements have been derived assuming that rx  j0537.77034 and 1e0035.4 - 7230 are just at the minimum period @xmath73 , so the conditions might be even harder to meet .",
    "the probability of observing such a system is larger near the end of the thermally unstable phase because the mass transfer rate decreases ( in both deutschmann s and our own full computations ) .",
    "we have so far neglected the effect of tidal interactions on the orbital evolution of the binary .",
    "tauris & savonije ( 2000 ) show that these can be important in low  mass x",
    " ray binaries by translating spin angular momentum losses ( via e.g. magnetic stellar wind braking ) into orbital losses when tidal synchronization occurs .",
    "however for the binaries we consider here , any effect before the beginning of mass transfer simply allows a shorter @xmath45 for a wider range of systems .",
    "once synchronism is achieved , the angular momentum of a lobe  filling donor is less than about 10 per cent of the orbital angular momentum ( because the gyration radii of typical donor stars is small , @xmath134 ) . even transferring all of this to the orbit in the course of the evolution would lead to only a marginal shift towards longer minimum periods , leaving our conclusions unchanged .",
    "the work of this paper suggests that while the thermal  timescale mass transfer model for the supersoft x  ray binaries has many desirable features , it may not be possible to use it to describe all of the supersoft binaries , as well as sne ia progenitors .",
    "for example , if highly non  conservative mass transfer is as common as seems to be required to explain rx  j0537.77034 or 1e0035.4 - 7230 , this would make building up the white dwarf mass to produce a type ia supernova highly problematical .",
    "it may therefore be necessary to consider other possibilities ( e.g. van teeseling & king , 1998 ; king & van teeseling , 1998 ) .",
