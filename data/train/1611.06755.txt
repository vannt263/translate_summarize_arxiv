    "the hyperbolic conservation laws arise in many applications such as in gas dynamics , magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) and shallow water flows .",
    "it is well known that even if the initial conditions are smooth , the hyperbolic conservation laws may develop discontinuities in its solution , such as shocks , contact discontinuities etc .",
    "godunov @xcite was first to propose a first order upwind scheme for the solution of these equations in the year @xmath4 which turned out to be a stepping stone for the development of various upwind schemes in the following years . in order to construct a higher order scheme harten",
    "@xcite introduced the concept of total variation diminishing ( tvd ) , which says that the total variation to the approximation of numerical solution must be non - increasing with time .",
    "later it was shown that the tvd schemes are having at most of first - order accuracy near smooth extrema @xcite .",
    "harten et al .",
    "@xcite derived the higher order schemes with the property of relaxing the tvd condition and allowing the occurrence of spurious oscillations in the numerical scheme but the @xmath5 gibbs - like phenomena is essentially prevented , which is termed as essentially non - oscillatory ( eno ) property and the schemes are known as eno schemes .",
    "these are the first successful higher order schemes for the spatial discretization of the hyperbolic conservation laws , in a finite - volume formulation .",
    "the eno schemes adopts a strategy of choosing the interpolation points over a stencil which avoids the induction of oscillations in the numerical solution through a smoothness indicator of a solution . and based on this idea the smoothest stencil is chosen from a set of candidate stencils . as a result",
    ", the eno scheme obtains information from smooth regions and avoids spurious oscillations near discontinuities .",
    "further , these schemes were studied in a finite - difference environment by shu and osher @xcite .",
    "the weighted eno ( weno ) schemes are set forth by liu et al .",
    "@xcite , in a finite - volume frame of reference up to third - order of accuracy .",
    "later , jiang and shu @xcite have put forward these weno schemes in a finite - difference setup to a higher order accuracy with the new smoothness indicators .",
    "these smoothness indicators are measured in the scaled @xmath6 norm , that is , they are the sum of the normalized squares , of all derivatives of the local interpolating polynomials .",
    "this scheme is referred as weno - js in the content to follow . for more details on eno and weno schemes",
    ", one can refer to the articles @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a very high order schemes are constructed in a similar manner of weno - js in @xcite , which we mention them here as weno - bs schemes .",
    "seventh order weno - bs scheme is revised in @xcite and inspected the scheme in the presence of critical points .",
    "henrick et al .",
    "@xcite examined that the actual convergence rate of the fifth - order weno - js scheme is less than the desired order , for the problems where the first and third order derivatives of the flux do not vanish simultaneously .",
    "in addition , it was ascertained that the convergence rate of the scheme is sensitive to the parameter @xmath7 employed in the evaluation of smoothness indicators to overcome from vanishing denominator .",
    "the authors revived the weno - js scheme by using a mapping function on the nonlinear weights such that the scheme , named as mapped weno , satisfies the sufficient condition where weno - js fails and achieves an optimal order of convergence near simple smooth extrema .",
    "subsequently , a very high order weno schemes were developed based on the mapping function in @xcite .",
    "borges et al .",
    "@xcite reviewed the fifth - order weno schemes , entitled as weno - z scheme , by initiating a global smoothness indicator , which measures the smoothness of the larger stencil utilized in the construction of nonlinear weights .",
    "it was numerically validated that weno - z scheme is less dissipative than weno - js scheme and more efficient than mapped weno scheme .",
    "weno - z scheme retained the convergence order as four at the first - order critical points , degrade to two when higher order critical points are encountered .",
    "these thoughts are extended by castro et al .",
    "@xcite to higher order schemes and produced a closed - form formula for the global smoothness indicators .",
    "the authors also assessed the dominance of the parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 to retain the desired order of accuracy .",
    "the parameter @xmath8 is set up in the formulation of nonlinear weights to ascertain that these nonlinear weights converge to the ideal weights at a fast enough convergence rate .",
    "the convergence analysis of weno - js scheme explored by arandiga et al .",
    "@xcite is based on the value of @xmath7 proposed that @xmath9 value is proportional to the square of mesh size @xmath10 , instead of a constant value so that the scheme achieves @xmath11 order of accuracy at smooth regions regardless of neighboring extrema , while this is of order @xmath12 when the function has a discontinuity in the stencil of @xmath13 points and is smooth in at least one of the @xmath14point stencil .",
    "a question about the behavior of weno - z scheme when the @xmath9 value is taken in accordance with the value mentioned in @xcite , is examined by don and borges @xcite .",
    "the authors made the accuracy analysis of the weno - z scheme and suggested a condition on the value of @xmath9 to achieve the full global - order of accuracy as similar to that of @xcite .",
    "further the authors have shown that the numerical oscillations can be attenuated by increasing the parameter @xmath8 value from @xmath15 to @xmath16 .",
    "an alternate to the smoothness indicators of fifth order weno - js scheme were formulated by fan et al .",
    "@xcite with the help of lagrange interpolation polynomials , accordingly a very high order schemes were derived by fan in @xcite .",
    "these schemes are based on the idea of constructing higher order global smoothness indicators , due to which less dissipation occurs in the solution near discontinuities .",
    "very recently , another version of a smoothness indicators were proposed by ha et al .",
    "@xcite , measured in @xmath0-norm , hereafter referred as weno - ns scheme .",
    "the authors introduced a higher - order approximation to the first derivative in the formation of local smoothness indicators which yields an improved behavior relative to other fifth - order weno schemes .",
    "the global smoothness indicator for the weno - ns scheme is preferred as an average of the two measurements , the smoothness information of the five point stencil and the middle three point stencil .",
    "kim et al .",
    "@xcite perceived that , the three sub - stencils of the fifth - order weno - ns scheme provides an unbalanced contribution to the flux at an evaluation point along the interface and an additional contribution term which measures the smoothness of the middle stencil in the formation of global smoothness indicator .",
    "the authors made a balanced tradeoff among the sub - stencils through a parameter @xmath17 and a global smoothness indicator is figured out which does nt depend on the smoothness information of the middle three point stencil anymore .",
    "these modifications lead to better results than the weno - ns as well as other fifth - order weno schemes , this scheme is pointed out as weno - p scheme in the later part of this article .    a simple analysis verifies that the weno - ns and weno - p schemes attain the fifth - order accuracy at first order critical points but fails to achieve the accuracy at the points where second derivative vanishes .",
    "we have suggested a modified weno - p scheme in @xcite based on the idea of the linear combination of second - order derivatives , leading to a higher - order derivative information , is used in the construction of a global smoothness indicator .",
    "the modified smoothness indicator satisfies the sufficient condition , assert the requirement to achieve desired order of accuracy , even in the case of second order derivative vanishes .    in this article ,",
    "a seventh order weno scheme is derived in the lines of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the smoothness indicators are obtained from the generalized undivided difference operator .",
    "each of this operator is up to fourth - order of accuracy at the evaluation point , so the resulting scheme is seventh order accurate .",
    "introduced parameters @xmath18 , @xmath19 to balance the tradeoff between the accuracies around the smooth to the discontinuous regions .",
    "the global smoothness indicator so earned satisfies the sufficient condition to get the optimal order of convergence rate , unvarying in the presence of critical points . utilized strong stability preserving runge - kutta schemes introduced in @xcite to advance the time .",
    "these are detailed out in the following sections , briefly they are :    section @xmath15 , deals with the preliminaries about weno reconstruction to the one - dimensional scalar conservation laws and section @xmath20 introduces the proposed weno scheme where a new global measurement and local smoothness indicators are derived , which estimates the smoothness of a local solution in the construction of a seventh - order weno scheme .",
    "numerics for one - dimensional scalar test problems such as linear advection , burger s equation , the examples pertaining to the system of euler equations such as shock tube problems , 1d shock - entropy wave interaction problem and 2d riemann problem of gas dynamics are reported in section @xmath21 , to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed weno scheme . finally , concluding remarks are in section @xmath22 .",
    "this part accounts to the construction of the seventh order weighted essentially non - oscillatory scheme in a finite difference framework for approximate the solution of hyperbolic conservation laws @xmath23 with initial condition @xmath24 here @xmath25 is a @xmath26dimensional vector of conserved variables defined for space and time variables @xmath27 respectively , @xmath28 is a flux function which depends on the conserved quantity @xmath29 the system @xmath30 is called hyperbolic if all the eigen values @xmath31 of the jacobian matrix @xmath32 of the flux function are real and the set of right eigen vectors are complete .    for numerical approximation",

    "weno scheme prefers @xmath13 points global stencil , @xmath71 to achieve @xmath11 order of accuracy .",
    "the stencil @xmath72 is subdivided into @xmath12 sub - stencils with each sub - stencil bearing @xmath12 cells .",
    "in particular , seventh - order weno scheme accounts to a @xmath73points stencil , which is subdivided into four @xmath21-points sub - stencils @xmath74 in accordance with cell @xmath75 each sub - stencil encloses four grid points , specified as @xmath76 a third degree interpolating polynomial @xmath77 is formulated in each sub - stencil @xmath78 and evaluating it at the cell boundary @xmath79 we retain @xmath80 where the coefficients @xmath81 are the lagrange interpolation coefficients , independent of the values of the flux function @xmath82 but depends on the left shift parameter @xmath83 the equation ( [ f^kjph ] ) on each stencil takes the form @xmath84 the fluxes @xmath85 can be fetched through shifting the index to the left by one in ( [ f^kjph ] ) .",
