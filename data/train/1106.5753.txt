    "one explanation for the existence of closely orbiting extrasolar giant planets is through the mechanism of orbital migration . induced through the gravitational interaction with the protostellar disc ( e.g. lin & papaloizou 1986 ) .",
    "notably this mechanism is expected to produce planets in circular orbits that are coplanar with the the stellar equator .",
    "however , the presence of high orbital eccentricities amongst extra solar planets is indicative of a strong orbital relaxation or scattering process .",
    "this led weidenschilling & mazari ( 1996 ) and rasio & ford ( 1996 ) to consider planet - planet scattering of planets initially on nearby circular orbits that resulted in one planet being scattered onto a highly eccentric orbit that had a close approach to the central star .",
    "subsequent tidal interaction with the central star was then postulated to lead to the formation of a hot jupiter .",
    "papaloizou & terquem ( 2001 ) investigated the strong dynamical relaxation of a planetary system with 5 to 100 planets starting on closely packed circular orbits .",
    "this type of relaxation also readily produced planets in a highly eccentric orbits with close enough approaches to the central star for stellar tides to lead to orbital circularisation .",
    "the evolution of the planet orbit due to combined action of planet - planet scatterings and tides has also been considered ( e.g. nagasawa et al 2008 , marchi et al 2009 ) .",
    "more recently measurements of the inclination of the orbital planes of transiting protoplanets through the rossiter - mclaughlin effect has led to the discovery of a significant number of close orbiters on highly inclined or even retrograde orbits ( see eg .",
    "winn et al .",
    "2010 , hebrard 2011 , and references therein ) .",
    "this indicates that a planet - planet interaction that can lead to high inclination orbits with high eccentricity that are subsequently circularised has been active in some cases at least .",
    "thus tidal circularisation of orbits with arbitrary inclination with respect to the central star need to be considered .",
    "tides induced in the planet are expected to be independent of orbital inclination because of the rapid attainment of pseudo synchronisation ( see ivanov & papaloizou 2007 ) .",
    "however , this is not the case for tides induced on the star .",
    "for example in a frame rotating with the star , tidal forcing from a retrograde orbit will appear to have a higher forcing frequency than tidal forcing from a prograde orbit .",
    "accordingly the tidal response will differ .",
    "this leads to a larger transfer of energy from the planet orbit to the star during a single periastron flyby ( see also lai 1997 ) this type of phenomenon may modulate the distribution of observed hot jupiters on inclined circular orbits that may have been circularised with tides acting on the central star playing a significant role .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to study the tidal interactions of planets on highly eccentric orbits , with orbital planes arbitrarily inclined to the stellar equatorial plane , taking account of tides induced on the central star and estimating their contribution to the circularisation process . in making these studies",
    "we follow the approach of previous papers ( ivanov & papaloizou 2004 , 2007 ; papaloizou & ivanov 2010 ) and approximate the initial stages of orbital circularisation as being through a sequence of encounters of the planet on a parabolic orbit with the star .",
    "we find typical time scales , @xmath0 , of evolution of the planet s semi - major axis @xmath4 due to dynamic tide exerted in the planet and in the star , as a function of the period @xmath1 , which the planet has after the circularisation has been completed and the planet has settled on a low eccentricity orbit .",
    "this period can be obtained from observations .",
    "it is important to note that the aspects of dynamical tides considered in this paper can only efficiently decrease the planet s semi - major axis when either the so - called stochastic instability ( see e.g. kochanek ( 1992 ) , kosovichev @xmath5 novikov ( 1992 ) , mardling ( 1995)a , b , ivanov @xmath5 papaloizou ( 2004 ) , ( 2007 ) ) operates in the dynamical system consisting of the orbit and tidally perturbed normal modes of the planet and the star , or when the normal modes are able to dissipate the energy transferred from the orbit during a time of order of or smaller than one orbital period .",
    "as we discuss below both processes can be effective when the semi - major axis of the orbit is sufficiently large , of the order of several @xmath6 therefore , in general , the time @xmath0 characterises only the orbital evolution at such scales . at smaller scales ,",
    "nonlinear effects not considered here , such as wave breaking , or frictional processes acting on quasi - static tides can further decrease @xmath4 thus completing the process of circularisation and leading to the formation of close - in giant planets with small @xmath1 and eccentricities ( e.g. barker @xmath5 ogilvie 2009 and references therein ) .",
    "provided that typical time scale of orbital circularisation due to these processes is smaller than @xmath7 this characteristic time scale may be considered as giving an overall time for the planet to circularise from an initially large semi - major axis @xmath8 in the opposite limit the overall time scale is obviously given by the time scale associated with the later evolution .    in order to evaluate @xmath0",
    "we have to know the dependence of the stellar angular velocity , @xmath9 , on time @xmath10 . in what follows we use the simplest possible form of such a dependence assuming the so - called the skumanich ( 1972 ) law for stellar rotation @xmath11 , where the coefficient of proportionally is chosen in such a way that the star has a period of rotation of one month at an age of @xmath12 corresponding to that of the sun .",
    "we find @xmath0 to be different for prograde and retrograde orbits , with the difference increasing with planet mass .",
    "the ratio of the evolution time scale corresponding to a prograde orbit to that corresponding to a retrograde orbit is of order @xmath13 for a one jupiter mass planet with a typical @xmath14 , and it is of order @xmath15 for a five jupiter mass planet with the same period .",
    "this difference gets more pronounced in a situation where tides exerted in the planet are not taken into account . since conditions determining the long term effectiveness of the transfer of energy from the orbit to modes of pulsation can be different for the planet and star , such a situation may indeed occur .",
    "the results reported in this paper may be directly used in numerical experiments involving planet - planet scattering which also include tidal interactions between planets and the host star .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "we develop an analytic theory for calculating the tidal response of a slowly rotating star due to close the passage of a planetary perturber in a parabolic orbit in section [ sec:1 ] .",
    "the orbital plane is allowed to have an arbitrary inclination to the stellar equatorial plane and corrections to stellar normal mode frequencies correct to first order in the stellar angular velocity are taken into account .",
    "we give expressions for the energy transferred to the star in section [ energytr ] and the analogous expressions for the transferred angular momentum in appendix b. in section [ numerical ] we describe numerical solutions of the linear tidal encounter problem . following our previous work ( papaloizou & ivanov 2010 ) we take account of coriolis forces ,",
    "but not centrifugal forces so that the tidally undisturbed model was spherical .",
    "however , apart from this , the stellar angular velocity may take any value .",
    "we perform calculations for a polytrope of index @xmath16 and unlike in our previous work we include a treatment of the self - gravity of the star .",
    "results for the energy and angular momentum transferred to the star as a consequence of prograde encounters , retrograde encounters and encounters with orbital plane perpendicular to the equatorial plane are then given in section [ numres ] .",
    "we then go on to compare numerical and analytic results in section [ numanalcomp ] . in both approaches",
    "the tidal transfers are significantly larger for retrograde encounters as compared to prograde encounters .",
    "we use our results to estimate the initial time scale for tidal circularisation for an orbit with an initial semi - major axis of @xmath17 that circularises in a short period orbit in section [ circtime ] for planets of one and five jupiter masses .",
    "we give estimates with and without contributions arising from tides induced in the planet obtained from our previous work ( eg .",
    "ivanov & papaloizou 2007 ) .",
    "the central star is taken to be a solar mass star with angular velocity determined by the skumanich ( 1972 ) law .",
    "we find that tides induced in the star and planet may separately account for the initial circularisation of orbits down to periods of a few days . finally in section",
    "[ discuss ] we summarize and our discuss our results and their application to the tidal circularisation of prograde and retrograde hot jupiters .",
    "we develop the theory of the tidal interaction of a planet on a parabolic orbit with a central star .",
    "when the star is not rotating the tidal interaction excites @xmath18 @xmath19 and @xmath20 modes .",
    "a slow rotation approximation is then adopted in which the first order corrections to the mode frequencies due to rotation is taken into account in calculating the tidal response for an orbit with arbitrary inclination .",
    "we calculate the energy transfer occurring as a result of the action of dynamic tides induced in a rotating star by a planet moving in a highly eccentric orbit in a plane that is inclined with respect to the stellar equatorial plane .",
    "the eccentricity is taken to be very close to unity so that to a good approximation the planet may be viewed as undergoing a sequence of parabolic encounters with the central star .",
    "for such a configuration , there are two natural cartesian coordinate systems with origin at the centre of the star .",
    "the first , @xmath21 is such that the @xmath22 plane coincides with the orbital plane .",
    "the second , @xmath23 is such that the @xmath24 plane coincides with the equatorial plane of the star .",
    "it is assumed that the the line of nodes which coincides with the y axis makes an angle @xmath25 with the @xmath26 axis and lies in the interval @xmath27.$ ] the direction of orbital motion is assumed to be correspond to a rotation about the @xmath28 axis when viewed in the @xmath22 plane with the apsidal line coinciding with the @xmath29 axis and pericentre such that @xmath30 .",
    "thus the @xmath22 plane coincides with the orbital plane with the orbit being symmetric with respect to the @xmath29 axis .",
    "the @xmath24 plane coincides with the star s equatorial plane with the @xmath31 axis directed along the star s rotation axis .",
    "the line of intersection of the @xmath22 plane and the @xmath24 plane is chosen to define the @xmath32 axis .",
    "the angle @xmath33 between the @xmath34 and @xmath31 axes is called the inclination angle .",
    "its values lie in the range @xmath35 $ ] .",
    "clearly , @xmath36 corresponds to a situation when the planet s orbit lies in the equatorial plane of the star but the direction of orbital motion is opposite to the direction of stellar rotation .",
    "it is easy to see that the mutual orientation of the coordinate systems defined in this way corresponds to the angles @xmath33 and @xmath25 being the usual euler angles that are adopted to define the relative orientation of two coordinate systems convention .",
    "another way of defining the angles would be to perform the first rotation about the @xmath37 axis and the second one about the @xmath31 axis .",
    "the so - defined euler angles @xmath38 and @xmath39 correspond to the frequently used @xmath40 convention . they are related to the angles used in this paper as @xmath41 and @xmath42 . ] . additionally , we make use of two spherical polar coordinate systems with spherical angles @xmath43 and @xmath44 respectively .",
    "the pairs of angles @xmath43 and @xmath45 are defined in the usual way , but with respect to the coordinate systems @xmath46 and @xmath23 respectively .",
    "the quantity that determines the energy and angular momentum transferred between planet and star is the tidal potential , @xmath47 .",
    "when the @xmath46 system is used the tidal potential has the standard form ( see e.g. press @xmath5 teukolsky 1977 , hereafter pt ) @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the gravitational constant , @xmath50 is the planet s mass and @xmath51 is the spherical polar radial coordinate .",
    "@xmath52 and @xmath53 are the distance between the planet and the star and the angle between the position vector of the planet and the @xmath54 axis measured in the orbital plane respectively .",
    "the time @xmath55 corresponds to a passage through periastron by the planet .",
    "the prime above the summation sign implies hereafter that the summation is performed over @xmath56 , @xmath57 only . for @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , with @xmath61 being the usual spherical functions .",
    "when we consider the tidal potential in the @xmath46 coordinate system with orientation determined by the stellar rotation axis , its form is modified . in order to find the new form of @xmath47 we can use the transformation law of spherical functions under a rotation of the coordinate system .",
    "this may be written @xmath62 where @xmath63 are the so - called wigner @xmath64 functions , see e.g. varshalovich et al ( 1989 ) . here",
    "the summation is performed over all integers , @xmath65 such that @xmath66.$ ] note that the @xmath64 functions depend only on the inclination angle , @xmath67 and satisfy the condition @xmath68 .",
    "their explicit forms are given in appendix a.    substituting equation ( [ e2 ] ) in ( [ e1 ] ) we get @xmath69 where @xmath70 note that from the requirement that @xmath47 is a real quantity and the properties of the spherical functions that @xmath71 , where @xmath72 stands for the complex conjugate it follows that @xmath73    in order to evaluate the effects of a single encounter of the planet with the star , we introduce the fourier transform in time of any quantity of interest , say @xmath74 , @xmath75 , by the relations @xmath76 from equations ( [ e5 ] ) and ( [ e6 ] ) it follows that the fourier transforms of the amplitudes @xmath77 obey the symmetry relations @xmath78    as follows from equations ( [ e1 ] ) and ( [ e3 ] ) the time dependence of the tidal potential is determined by the quantities @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the periastron distance . assuming that the orbit is formally parabolic , @xmath52 and @xmath81 can be obtained from the parametric representations @xmath82",

    "using equations ( [ e4 ] ) and the definition of @xmath93 we obtain as explicit expression for @xmath94 , @xmath95      as has been discussed in our previous papers ( ivanov @xmath5 papaloizou 2004 , papaloizou@xmath5ivanov 2005 , ivanov@xmath5papaloizou 2007 , ivanov @xmath5 papaloizou 2010 , papaloizou@xmath5ivanov 2010 ) for the case of coplanar encounters a perturber moving on eccentric orbit excites normal modes of a rotating body after the periastron passage .",
    "we must , accordingly , solve equations of motion of stellar perturbations associated with the modes under the forcing determined by the tidal potential in order to find the transfers of energy and angular momentum from the orbit to the modes .",
    "as we discuss above in this paper we would like to relax the assumption of coplanarity of the orbital and equatorial planes treating , however , the effect of stellar rotation in a simplest possible way and assuming that the angular frequency of the star , @xmath9 , is much smaller that angular frequencies of the normal modes , @xmath96 , mainly excited in course of the tidal encounter , @xmath97 . in this case the normal modes frequencies are close to the ones of non - rotating star , @xmath98 , where the index @xmath4 labels different types of normal modes of a non - rotating star ( e.g. p - modes , g - modes and the fundamental mode ) . in the linear approximation in small parameter",
    "@xmath99 only the modes frequencies acquire corrections of order of @xmath9 due to rotation while other quantities remain the same as in the non - rotating case . in the same approximation",
    "the total energy and angular momentum transfers can be represented as a direct sum of partial contributions corresponding to modes of different type , and , therefore , we derive below these expressions for a mode of one particular type , omitting , for simplicity , the index @xmath4 below , thus e.g. @xmath100 , etc ..    the stellar perturbations can be described in terms of the lagrangian displacement vector , @xmath101 . since the tidal potential is represented as a sum of the spherical harmonics @xmath102 having @xmath103 and @xmath104 ( see equation ( [ e3 ] ) ) in order to solve the response problem for a mode having in the non - rotating limit a frequency @xmath105 and @xmath103 we should consider the vector @xmath101 as a linear combination of the eigen vectors with the same values of @xmath106 , @xmath107 where @xmath108 @xmath109 is unit vector in the radial direction , the functions @xmath110 and @xmath111 can be found by solving the eigenvalue problem for a non - rotating star , see e.g. pt , lee @xmath5 ostriker 1986 .",

    "during the planet s flyby of the star the energy is deposited in the star at a rate determined by work done by the tidal force @xmath134 and , accordingly , the total energy transfer , @xmath135 , is obtained by integration of ( [ e17 ] ) over time @xmath136 where the limits of integration are formally extended to @xmath137 since the integral over time in ( [ e18 ] ) is highly peaked near @xmath55 corresponding to the periastron passage .",

    "here we describe numerical solutions for tidal encounters of a planet with a star when the orbit is not coplanar with its equatorial plane .",

    "this in turn can be related to the rate of orbital circularisation starting from high eccentricity ( papaloizou & ivanov 2007 ) .",
    "the numerical procedures follow closely those described in papaloizou & ivanov ( 2010 ) that were applied to tidal encounters with a polytrope of index @xmath168 but with appropriate modifications to consider a polytrope with @xmath169 these are described below .",

    "we simplify the problem by noting that we consider solutions the tidal problem by combining solutions of equation ( [ eq p3 ] ) where the angular dependence of @xmath47 is through a single spherical function . to evaluate @xmath185",
    "we retain only the spherical function associated with the forcing in the decomposition of @xmath195 this is an exact procedure in the non rotating case and should be a reasonable approximation in the rotating case as the potential perturbations associated with high order spherical functions are expected to be small .",
    "it amounts to retaining only the quadrupole components of the gravitational potential for the problem on hand , a procedure that has been used successfully in problems of stellar dynamics ( eg .",
    "allen et al .",

    "this corresponds to encounters with @xmath204 and @xmath205 giving the same results for these quantities .",
    "the above tidal potentials consist of a sum of terms with different azimuthal mode number @xmath206 these can be considered independently and the energy and angular momentum transferred as a result of the action of each term evaluated as the canonical energy and angular momentum obtained after the encounter is over ( see below ) .",
    "the results can then be added to get the total .",

    "the origin of the deviation at large values of @xmath287 is unclear at present .",

    "thus they are approaching the so called inertial regime for which eigenfrequencies are less than @xmath292 in magnitude .",
    "it is possible that the overlap integrals become significantly modified in such a situation .",
    "this issue will be explored in future work .        in principle , the results reported above can be used in numerical experiments in which a system of gravitationally interacting planets is considered , it being assumed that once a planet has obtained a sufficiently small value of its orbital angular momentum as a result of planet - planet gravitational scattering , it can lose orbital energy due to tidal interaction with the central star during successive periastron passages . if the effect of tidal interaction on changing the orbital energy becomes much larger than residual effects associated with planet - planet scattering , the planet is said to be tidally captured by the star . after being tidally captured , the planet interacts mainly with the central star due to dynamic and quasi - static tides exerted in itself and in the star . under certain conditions discussed in the next section the orbital energy decreases , either systematically or on average , while the orbital period and orbital eccentricity also decrease . in this way it is possible to account for at least some of the so - called `` hot jupiters '' - giant planets with orbital periods ranging from a fraction of a day to several days .",
    "the central star can rotate , with its rotation axis inclined with respect to the normal to the orbital plane by an angle @xmath293 after the tidal capture .",
    "this angle is determined by the particular sequence of planet - planet interactions that led to the tidal capture . since retrograde tidal interactions that transfer energy to the star",
    "are stronger than prograde ones , while the angle @xmath33 may be random or have a weak correlation with the direction of stellar rotation , this property of the tidal interaction may influence the observed relative number of hot jupiters on retrograde and prograde orbits .",
    "thus it is important to estimate the potential magnitude of this tidal effect .",
    "as hot jupiters may have been formed when the star was young , in making such an estimate it is very important to account for the fact that the angular velocity of the star , @xmath294 is a function of stellar age . this function can be a rather complicated and is expected to be different for stars with different masses and formation histories ( e.g. scholz 2009 ) . in this paper",
    "we make only preliminary qualitative estimates of the importance of tides exerted in a rotating star on the formation of hot jupiters .",
    "accordingly , we use the simplest plausible form of this function known as the skumanich law ( skumanich 1972 ) , which states that the angular velocity is inversely proportional to square root of the stellar age .",
    "thus we adopt the following expression for the stellar angular velocity : @xmath295 here @xmath248 is normalised so that the star has a rotation period of one month at an age of @xmath296 .",
    "in this paper we do not consider the planet - planet interaction stage , leaving this for a future work .",
    "here we assume that tidal capture has happened and the planet interacts only with the star .",
    "it supposed to be initially on a highly eccentric ( essentially parabolic ) ) stellar radii , while its semimajor distance would be of order of a few ( say , @xmath297 ) astronomical units ( e.g. nagasawa et al 2008 ) . for such parameters",
    "orbital eccentricity @xmath298 is of order of @xmath299 and approximation of tidal encounters as happening on parabolic flybys is well justified . ]",
    "orbit with well defined values of the angles @xmath33 and @xmath25 and have a value of the orbital angular momentum corresponding to a given value of the parameter @xmath165 defined in equation ( [ e27 ] ) .",
    "the orbital energy , eccentricity and period are gradually changing their values due to tidal interactions on some characteristic evolution time scale , @xmath0 , specified below . as discussed in e.g. ivanov @xmath5 papaloizou ( 2004,2007 ) , orbital evolution as a result of tides acting in the planet approximately conserve orbital angular momentum because the planet spins up ( or slows down ) by tides to a state of rotation corresponding to the so - called pseudo - synchronisation , where the angular momentum exchange between the orbit and pulsational modes of the planet is absent .",
    "this happens on a quite short time scale due to a small moment of inertia of the planet compared to that of the orbit .    in the case of tides exerted in the star we have an opposite situation where the stellar moment of inertia is typically much larger than the orbital one",
    "therefore , the star can not be brought by action of tides to the state of pseudo - synchronisation during the evolution of the system , and some amount of angular momentum is transferred from the orbit to the star in the course of it thus decreasing the value of the orbital angular momentum .",
    "we would like to estimate this value assuming that tides are effective all the way down to smallest values of the orbital eccentricity .",
    "let us stress again that the dynamic tides discussed in this paper are effective only at sufficiently large values of the eccentricity @xmath300 ( see the next section ) .",
    "however , it seems plausible to suppose that processes not considered here , such as the nonlinear breaking of excited waves , critical latitude phenomena in the planet , or friction , resulting from for example turbulence , acting on quasi - static tides could be important when the eccentricity is moderate and small , and that they can eventually bring the system to the state having a low eccentricity @xmath301 typical for the hot jupiters ( e.g. barker @xmath5 ogilvie 2009 ) .",
    "it is well known that the mode energy , @xmath302 , is related to the mode angular momentum , @xmath303 , as @xmath304 , see e.g. friedman @xmath5 schutz ( 1977 ) .",
    "accordingly , the total amount of energy and angular momentum , @xmath305 and @xmath306 , transferred from the orbit to the star obeys a similar relation , where , in general , we should sum over all modes of the star . in our case of a slowly rotating star only @xmath237 @xmath20-modes of sufficiently high order give a significant contribution to the sum . for our problem the corresponding eigenfrequencies of these modes can be roughly estimated as @xmath307 , and we obtain @xmath308 after the tidal circularisation has happened assuming that the tides induced in the star dominate over those in the planet we can equate the total mode energy @xmath305 to the orbital binding energy of the planet after the circularisation , @xmath309 , where @xmath310 is the final value of the orbital semi - major axis , and we suppose that @xmath311 , and , accordingly , the orbital angular momentum @xmath312 . from these expressions",

    "it is also important to note that the threshold value of the energy @xmath381 for our case can be estimated to be @xmath382 for a star with solar values of mass and radius and rotational period of order of a few days to be approximately @xmath383 , where @xmath105 is a typical eigen frequency of a mode undergoing parametric instability and @xmath384 is the stellar thermal time .",
    "taking @xmath385 and @xmath386 we get @xmath387 . ] at sufficiently large values of @xmath379 ( see below ) the amount of energy transferred during one periastron flyby of a planet moving on a prograde orbit is significantly smaller than @xmath381 making the non - linear dissipation of the mode energy impossible .",
    "this can further amplify the difference between the capture probabilities .",
    "interestingly , the values of @xmath367 for retrograde orbits are of the order of the orbital periods of planets with semimajor axes of order @xmath17 - the scale , where the processes of tidal capture are expected to operate .    in order to calculate @xmath388 as shown in fig .",
    "[ nfig3 ] , for simplicity we set @xmath343 in ( [ eqn5 ] ) .",
    "one can see from this figure that when the attenuation effect is taken into account , dynamic tides can explain the initial stages of tidal circularisation up to @xmath389 in contrast to the simpler case considered in the previous section , where the beginning of effective circularisation is expected up to @xmath390 see fig .",
    "[ fign1 ] .",
    "we also checked that typical values of @xmath135 used to calculate @xmath0 are approximately equal to @xmath366 when @xmath391 thus , at larger values of @xmath392 non - linear dissipation of mode energy is likely to be unimportant .",
    "the results discussed in this section confirm our previously made assertion that dynamic tides can lead to an efficient decrease of semimajor axis on scales corresponding to tidal capture both as a result of the stochastic instability and the possibility of non - linear dissipation of energy stored in normal modes excited in the star .",
    "however , at smaller scales , the evolution of @xmath4 due to the processes we have discussed clearly stalls , necessitating the consideration of different nonlinear effects , such as wave breaking ( e.g. barker @xmath5 ogilvie ( 2010 ) , barker ( 2011 ) ) , operating on normal modes , or other phenomena such as turbulent friction operating on quasi - static tides to be able to describe later stages of orbital evolution .",
    "in this paper we have developed an analytic theory for calculating the tidal response of a slowly rotating star resulting from a fly by of a planetary perturber in a parabolic orbit , with orbital plane at an arbitrary inclination to the stellar equatorial plane .",
    "expressions for the energy transferred to the star were presented in section [ energytr ] ( see equations ( [ e22])-([e28 ] ) ) . in order to develop these expressions only the first order corrections to the normal mode eigenfrequencies appropriate to the non rotating star were incorporated .",
    "this implicitly assumes that these modes only change slightly and continue to dominate the tidal response in this form . in order to confirm these results numerical solutions of the linear tidal problem",
    "were considered in [ numerical ] . in these calculations",
    "coriolis forces , but not centrifugal forces , were taken into account .",
    "thus the equilibrium model was spherical . beyond this",
    "no assumption of slow rotation was made . in practice",
    "the calculations were done for a polytrope of index @xmath169 detailed results for prograde encounters , retrograde encounters and encounters with orbital plane perpendicular to the equatorial plane were presented in section [ numres ] .",
    "these were compared with results obtained from the analytic treatment in section [ numanalcomp ] . in general the agreement between the two approaches was good .",
    "both agreed that the tidal interaction was significantly more effective for retrograde encounters .",
    "the energy exchanged between the orbit and the star was about one order of magnitude larger for retrograde rotation with @xmath393 compared to prograde rotation with the same angular velocity when @xmath394 with the deviation becoming larger as @xmath288 increased . nonetheless the numerically obtained results showed an increasing deviation from the analytically determined ones for increasing angular velocity of retrograde rotation .",
    "the maximum departure was about a factor of two for @xmath395 and @xmath396 increasing to a factor of @xmath278 when @xmath288 was increased to @xmath397 however , due to the very rapid decline in the strength of tidal effects with increasing pericentre distance , we note that such deviations are scarcely significant for practical applications .",
    "the time scale for the initial stage of tidal circularisation inferred from our results for an orbit with initial semi - major axis of @xmath17 was given in section [ circtime ] for planets of @xmath398 and @xmath399 the rotation of the star , taken to be one solar mass , was assumed to follow the skumanich ( 1972 ) law .",
    "when tides from both the planet were included , initial circularisation down to circular orbits of periods @xmath400 could be readily accounted for both masses .",
    "when the effects of tides in the planet were neglected , our results indicated that tides acting in the star alone could be capable of producing a significant change in the planet s semi - major axis for final periods @xmath401 for both masses .",
    "provided that some additional processes such as quasi - static tides are sufficiently efficient at smaller scales our time scales may give an estimate of a characteristic time of the whole stage of circularisation .",
    "the discovery of hot jupiters in orbits highly inclined to the stellar equatorial plane with some orbits even being retrograde has given support to the idea that at least some of these objects were scattered into highly elongated orbits that were the circularised by tidal effects .",
    "the process of the excitation of oscillations by tides acting on the planets and the consequent circularisation has been discussed by ivanov & papaloizou ( 2004 , 2007 , 2010 ) and papaloizou & ivanov ( 2010 ) . here",
    "this work has been extended to consider tides excited in the star .",
    "these may be significant because in contrast to tides acting on the planet , they are not equally effective for prograde and retrograde rotation .",
    "this feature should be borne in mind when considering the distribution of objects as a function of inclination .",
    "hebrard et al .",
    "( 2010 ) point out that of the @xmath402 systems for which the inclination between the orbital and stellar equatorial planes has been measured at the time of writing , about one third are strongly misaligned with the distribution of inclinations being dependent on the planet mass such that retrograde systems only appear for @xmath403 our results indicate that under the assumptions we made about the stellar angular velocity , circularisation times for prograde and retrograde orbits should differ by a factor of two at least initially , for a typical period after circularisation of the order of four days , and that systems should be seen up to the same limiting period in both types of system .",
    "there would thus be some asymmetry produced by the effect of tides in this case though this claim should be confirmed by numerical n - body experiments incorporating planet - planet scattering together with tidal effects that take account of effects resulting from stellar rotation .",
    "the asymmetry may be more pronounced for masses @xmath404 however , at present there are relatively few objects with measured orbital inclinations with respect to the stellar rotation axis measured in this mass range . future observations may clarify this issue . similarly results may differ for different histories of the stellar rotation frequency and/or different stellar masses .",
    "winn et all ( 2010 ) point out that there is an increase in the fraction of planets on inclined orbits for stars with larger masses .",
    "these may have been rotating more rapidly in the past , thus increasing the asymmetry between the prograde and retrograde tidal interactions .",
    "it is clear that the result for the energy transfer obtained in this paper can also be directly applied to a general situation where two rotating stars of comparable mass with misaligned directions of rotational axes tidally interact with each other .",
    "therefore , our results may be of interest for the problem of tidal capture of stars in young stellar clusters .",
    "our results can also be generalised in several ways .",
    "firstly , expressions for the transfer of angular momentum can be obtained by a calculation similar to what is made in this paper for the energy transfer .",
    "note that all three components of the angular momentum ( with respect to the coordinate system defined with respect to the stellar rotation axis ) are transferred in the case of a general inclined encounter .",
    "secondly , a more realistic stellar model should be used to calculate the eigenfrequencies , overlap integrals and the frequency splitting coefficients @xmath264 .",
    "thirdly , in order to reach better agreement between the theory and the numerical calculations , a better theory of the tidal excitation of high order @xmath20-modes in a rotating star should , in principle , be developed . in the framework of such a theory one may try to relax the assumption of smallness of the stellar angular velocity in comparison to the mode eigenfrequencies .",
    "these issues will be addressed in future investigations .",
    "we are grateful to m. nagasawa and a. v. tutukov for useful remarks .",

    "here we consider the energy exchange associated with an orbit of high eccentricity where the mode damping rate may be small . in this case",
    "the orbit is assumed to be quasi - periodic and so the system undergoes multiple close approaches in contrast to the single encounter considered in parabolic limit that applies when the mode decay time is shorter than the orbital period .",
    "the orbital period is assumed short enough so as to avoid the stochastic regime ( see ivanov & papaloizou 2004 ) .",
    "we obtain an estimate for the factor by which results for the parabolic case need to be multiplied in order to apply to this case .",
    "we begin by writing down equation ( [ e13 ] ) governing the response of a single mode amplitude allowing for mode damping ( see ivanov @xmath5 papaloizou 2004 ) in the form @xmath449 where @xmath450 is the mode damping rate . noting that the problem is very similar to that of a forced , damped harmonic oscillator",
    ", we identify the mode energy as @xmath451 its rate of dissipation through mode damping follows from ( [ ac1 ] ) as @xmath452 see e.g. ivanov @xmath5 papaloizou 2004 .",
    "we consider forcing in a periodic orbit with period @xmath453 the potential @xmath47 will then have a discrete fourier series representation in the form @xmath454 where the fourier amplitudes are given by @xmath455 note that as the period tends to @xmath456 or @xmath457 with @xmath458 remaining finite , @xmath459 approaches the continuous fourier transform associated with a parabolic orbit .    because we consider an essentially linear response , equations ( [ ac1])-([ac4 ] ) may be applied to each fourier component separately and then the results combined . denoting by @xmath460 the quantity @xmath122 evaluated for the corresponding term in the fourier expansion for @xmath461 and the associated mode response amplitude by @xmath462 we have @xmath463 as we discuss below only contributions in summation series over @xmath464 , where @xmath465 are important for our purposes .",
    "this means that the term proportional to @xmath466 in the expression for @xmath467 in ( [ ac7 ] ) is much smaller than other terms as long as @xmath468 .",
    "it is neglected below . in the same approximation",
    "the term proportional to @xmath9 in ( [ ac41 ] ) can be neglected as well ( in fact these terms could be retained in the analysis but little is gained ) .    note that in order to get ( [ ac7 ] ) we assume that the mode damping rate is approximately constant .",
    "this is not formally the case when the dissipation is determined by non - linear processes considered in the text and @xmath450 is a function of mode amplitude .",
    "however , from equation ( [ ac41 ] ) it follows that the characteristic time of mode amplitude decay is long compared with typical periods @xmath469 when @xmath470 which corresponds to the case of interest .",
    "then we can approximately consider @xmath450 to be constant and to correspond to the initial rate of of mode decay , @xmath471 when dealing with the fourier harmonics with high value of @xmath464 that have frequencies corresponding to those of the excited normal modes .",
    "we now evaluate the rate of energy dissipation by applying equation ( [ ac4 ] ) for each fourier component and summing over @xmath464 to give @xmath472 ^ 2 + 4\\gamma_n^2k^2\\omega_{orb}^2 ] } .",

    "as the important values of @xmath464 differ in sign , these can be dealt with separately and the results summed . without loss of generality , we shall restrict attention to the positive frequency mode for which values of @xmath464 near @xmath475 are expected to dominate the sum ( we recall that @xmath476 ) . assuming other quantities vary smoothly with @xmath477 we replace @xmath464 by @xmath478 being the closest integer to @xmath479 everywhere except in the first bracket in the denominator of ( [ ac8 ] ) to obtain @xmath480 } .",

    "<S> we use the simple skumanich law to characterise the rotational history of the star assuming that the star has its rotational period equal to one month at the age of 5gyr . </S>",
    "<S> the strength of tidal interactions is characterised by circularisation time scale , @xmath0 , which is defined as a typical time scale of evolution of the planet s semi - major axis due to tides . </S>",
    "<S> this is considered as a function of orbital period @xmath1 , which the planet obtains after the process of tidal circularisation has been completed .    </S>",
