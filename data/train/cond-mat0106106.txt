    "electron and hole dynamics in the bulk as well as at the various surfaces of a solid play a key role in a great number of physical and chemical phenomena@xcite .",
    "these range from photon - induced surface reactions at metals to device - physical applications in semiconducting nanostructures .",
    "it is evident that both reliable experimental information and detailed theoretical understanding are necessary prerequisites for any future application - oriented tailoring of dynamical electronic properties .",
    "seen from theory any excitation of an electron - hole quasiparticle reflects basic properties of the solid as a correlated many - electron system , which must necessarily be described with inclusion of the very details of band structure , symmetry and dimensionality , and also the various excitation and decay channels . from the experimental point of view , additional contributions to experimental spectra result from effects like coupling of electrons and holes to phonons and their scattering with structural defects , and it is a sometimes tedious task to distinguish these effects unambiguously@xcite .    at present our quantitative understanding of the excitation mechanisms and their relaxation channels is far from being complete : there is ample experimental evidence from experiments at copper surfaces@xcite that hot - electron lifetimes @xmath2 probed by time - resolved two - photon photoemission ( tr - tppe ) techniques do not follow an inverse quadratic dependence @xmath3 , which would result from simple phase - space considerations@xcite .",
    "in contrast , an analysis of the standing - wave patterns observed by scanning tunneling spectroscopy on cu(111 ) has been shown to yield an accurate quadratic behaviour in the same energy range , i.e.  up to about @xmath4 above the fermi level @xmath5 @xcite . in this tunneling experiment electrons",
    "are injected into a well - defined surface state band , and the coherence length @xmath6 is then derived from the spatial damping of the standing - wave pattern produced by repeated reflections between parallel steps .",
    "simple and reliable model assumptions connect @xmath6 with @xmath2 and allow the determination of @xmath7 .",
    "tr - tppe , however , uses femtosecond pump - probe techniques to monitor the time - dependent occupation of the intermediate energy levels .",
    "these may have decay and excitation channels which differ from those of the tunneling experiment .",
    "one aspect appears particularly important : photons with typical energies of @xmath8 do not only probe @xmath1-like bulk and surface electrons , but in some cases also electrons from occupied @xmath0-bands are excited@xcite .",
    "regarding the above mentioned tr - tppe - experiments on copper , where the upper edge of the @xmath0-bands is located @xmath9 below the fermi level , a still ongoing debate considers whether@xcite or not@xcite auger recombination of long - lived @xmath0-holes contributes significantly to the hot - electron generation .",
    "since neither the magnitude nor the energy dependence of @xmath0-hole lifetimes is precisely known , we consider this subject to be of significant current interest .",
    "the new experimental data for copper presented in this paper were obtained using one - photon photoemission spectroscopy@xcite .",
    "this technique allows to determine lifetimes only from a detailed analysis of linewidths@xcite , and requires simultaneously low temperatures , excellent energy as well as angular resolution and in general tunable photon energy .",
    "this expense is more than compensated by the very detailed understanding of the one - photon excitation channel and the possibility to locate a photo - hole exactly with respect to both initial - state energy @xmath10 and wave vector @xmath11 .",
    "recent calculations have shown that any reliable theory of hot - electron and hole lifetimes in metals must go beyond a free - electron description of the solid @xcite . in sec .",

    "the sample is mounted on a manipulator cryostat having five degrees of freedom : @xmath12 translation , rotation around the manipulator axis and rotation around the surface normal , the latter one being particularly useful for polarization dependent suppression of individual photoemission lines .",
    "the sample temperature could be varied between @xmath13 and room temperature .",
    "a sample load lock system with a transfer rod allows to decouple the sample from the manipulator for preparation by argon ion bombardment and annealing .",

    "the angular resolution of @xmath16 is sufficient for normal emission spectra taken at flat bands . the experiments with cu(100 )",

    "the spectra reported below were excited using monochromatized heii radiation ( @xmath17 ) from a gammadata microwave light source .",
    "the angular resolution was estimated to be about @xmath18 ; the energy resolution was better than @xmath19 .",
    "the copper samples were oriented to better than @xmath20 , polished first mechanically and then electrochemically .",
    "after insertion into the uhv chamber they were cleaned and prepared by repeated cycles of argon ion bombardment and an extended annealing procedure at @xmath21 . the high surface quality had been verified experimentally : in these measurements we obtained very sharp leed spot profiles of about 1% of the surface brillouin zone diameter and , even more significant , sharp photoemission peaks : the shockley - type surface state on cu(110 ) , residing at @xmath22 around the @xmath23-point@xcite , shows a linewidth of less than @xmath24 ( fwhm ) at room temperature .",
