    "the ability of the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ to resolve knots and hot spots in radio jets has opened a new chapter in jet research @xcite .",
    "the radio emission in the extended jets on multi - kpc  mpc size scales is almost certainly nonthermal synchrotron radiation , but the origin of the x - ray emission is controversial . in many knots and hot spots ,",
    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) at x - ray energies is a smooth extension of the radio and optical fluxes , so that a synchrotron origin of the x - ray emission is implied . in other cases ,",
    "the x - ray flux exceeds the level implied by smoothly extending the radio / optical sed .",
    "but even in these cases , a one - component synchrotron interpretation may be possible @xcite , and a two - component synchrotron model can be preferred on energetic and spectral grounds @xcite .    besides the synchrotron mechanism , two other nonthermal processes are often considered to account for the x - ray fluxes observed from the knots and hot spots of radio jets , namely the synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) and the external compton ( ec ) processes @xcite .",
    "the target photons for the ec model can be cmbr photons @xcite , or nuclear jet radiation @xcite . the ec model involving cmbr target photons",
    "is the currently favored interpretation for quasar x - ray knots and hot spots where the x - ray spectrum is not a smooth extension of the radio / optical spectrum @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the x - ray emission from knots such as wk7.8 of pks 0637 - 752 is argued to be due to cmb photons that are compton - upscattered by nonthermal electrons from kpc - scale emitting regions in bulk relativistic motion at distances up to several hundred kpc from the central engine .    in a recent paper @xcite",
    ", we have addressed difficulties of the x - ray ec model to explain the opposite behaviors of the x - ray and radio spatial profiles .",
    "this model requires large energies , particularly in debeamed cases where the observer is outside the doppler beaming cone .",
    "here we concentrate on radiation from the extended x - ray jets , and provide equations suitable for observers to interpret multiwavelength x - ray data of knot and hot - spot emission with synchrotron , ec and ssc models , and evaluate jet powers .",
