    "<S> a complete knowledge of the kind of noise present along the channel is not available , and sometimes noise can be completely unknown . </S>",
    "<S> it is then important to develop efficient means to establish whether in these situations the channel can still be profitably employed for information transmission . a standard method to establish </S>",
    "<S> this relies on quantum process tomography , where a complete reconstruction of the cp map describing the action of the channel can be achieved , and therefore all its communication properties can be estimated . </S>",
