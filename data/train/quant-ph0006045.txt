    "a pure quantum state of two systems @xmath7 and @xmath8 is said to be entangled if it is not a product of a state for @xmath7 and a state for @xmath8 .",
    "two systems in an entangled state are correlated , and these correlations are intrinsically quantum mechanical @xcite .",
    "for example , one must use entangled states in order to produce violations of bell inequalities or in the test of local realism proposed by hardy @xcite .",
    "entangled states also play a key role in quantum information , in particular they are essential in quantum teleportation @xcite and in superdense coding @xcite . in quantum computers entanglement",
    "is one of the features of quantum mechanics which give these machines their power @xcite .",
    "here we would like to consider the problem of how to produce entanglement .",
    "in particular , if we are given particles , or systems , @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the pure states @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively , we would like to produce the state @xmath11 in what follows , where possible we omit explicit subscripts @xmath7 and @xmath8 . the order in which the vectors are written in the tensor products implicitly denotes to which system they belong ( i.e. the left vector corresponds to the system @xmath7 , while the right vector corresponds to the system @xmath8 ) .",
    "we assume that the two quantum systems ( e.g. , qubits ) are physically distinguishable .",
    "for instance they could be located in different regions of space .",
    "the task is to entangle their internal degrees of freedom .    that the symmetrization can not be done perfectly via a unitary transformation",
    "can be shown by the following argument .",
    "we consider the case in which @xmath0 and @xmath12 are both qubits .",
    "a perfect transformation would have to transform the basis vectors as @xmath13 where the @xmath14 , for @xmath15 , are normalized `` machine '' vectors , i.  e.  we assume that the entangler itself has its own degrees of freedom .",
    "in addition , it is assumed that the entangler is always initially in the same state , @xmath16 .",
    "unitarity requires that @xmath17 .",
    "now let us consider the case where the input vectors are @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( i.e. the state of the qubit @xmath7 is unknown , while the qubit @xmath8 is in a known state ) .",
    "the transformation ( [ 1.2 ] ) gives us @xmath20 whereas what it should produce is a vector proportional to @xmath21 , which in the basis @xmath22 , @xmath23 reads @xmath24 the vectors in the right - hand sides of eqs.([1.3 ] ) and ( [ 1.4 ] ) are clearly not the same , no matter what choice is made for @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , we need to search for devices which will produce approximate versions of the desired state or will produce this state but with a probability which is less than one .",
    "one way of creating a symmetrized state out of two independent systems is by means of a measurement - that is the two systems are optimally measured and their states are estimated .",
    "based on this estimation a two - particle entangled state is prepared .",
    "if we begin with two qubits prepared so that one of the states is known ( @xmath1 ) while the other is unknown ( @xmath0 ) , we need only estimate the state of one of the particles and this can be performed with a fidelity equal to 2/3 @xcite .",
    "the information gained from the optimal measurement is then used in the preparation procedure .",
    "this is discussed in section [ sec2a ] .",
    "we shall present quantum mechanical entangling transformations which generate entangled states with much higher fidelity than can be achieved by measuring the input particles . in section [ sec2b ] we briefly discuss a _ probabilistic _",
    "symmetrization ( entanglement ) which can be realized via a controlled - swap gate .",
    "the probability of success in this procedure is input - state dependent . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we present the optimal input - state independent quantum entangler and we also study the inseparabity of the outputs of this entangler . in section [ sec4 ] we show that the universal - not gate @xcite can also serve as a very interesting entangling device .",
    "we shall first look at two examples of processes which produce entangled states , for which the quality of the output depends on the input state .",
    "that is , these procedures work better for some states than for others .",
    "the first is perhaps the most obvious method , we simply measure the input state .",
    "we shall consider a more limited problem in this case , entangling an unknown with a known state .",
    "the output state resulting from this procedure is only an approximation to the desired one .",
    "the second is a probabilistic method ; the output when it is produced is ideal , but the probability of successfully producing it is less than one . in this case",
    "we shall consider the full problem of entangling two unknown states .",
    "our task is to entangle an input qubit in an unknown state with a reference qubit in a known state @xmath1 .",
    "that is , we want to realize the symmetrization map @xmath27 with the output parameterized as |^(id)__ab= , [ 1.1.2 ] the approach we will discuss here is as follows : firstly , the unknown single - qubit state @xmath4 is measured and then using the information gained thereby an approximate version of the desired output is constructed . in order to specify this procedure in more detail , we must describe what measurement is to be made and how its results will be used to construct the output state .",
    "the quality of the output will be determined by calculating the fidelity between the actual output and the desired output .",
    "we shall first examine a specific strategy and then find an upper bound on the fidelity for a wide class of measurement - based procedures .",
    "our first measurement - based scenario can then be realized in the following way . in the case of a single input qubit",
    "the _ optimal _ way to estimate the state , is to measure it along a randomly chosen direction in the two - dimensional hilbert space@xcite .",
    "therefore , the first step in implementing the measurement - based procedure is choosing a random vector @xmath28 , where |= |0 + e^i^|1 , [ 1.1.5 ] and measuring @xmath0 along it .",
    "if the result is positive , then the output is taken to be @xmath29 , and if negative , the output is @xmath30 , where |__ab & = & + & = & [ 1.1.6 ] and |__ab & = & + & = & [ 1.1.7 ] where the state @xmath31 is the state orthogonal to @xmath32 , |^= e^-i^ |0 -|1 . [ 1.1.8 ]    for a particular orientation of the measurement apparatus , i.e. for the particular choice of the state @xmath32 this measurement - based scenario gives the two - qubit output density matrix @xmath33 to get the final output density matrix one averages this over all possible choices of the measurement ( i.e. over all vectors @xmath28 ) @xmath34 finally , the fidelity can be found by computing the matrix element of this density matrix in the ideal output state , @xmath35 , @xmath36 this fidelity depends on the input state , and this dependence can be eliminated if we average over all input states @xmath37 this is the proper fidelity to use to judge how well our proposed strategy performs if we assume that all input states are equally probable .",
    "a more explicit expression for it is & = & _ 0 ^ 2 d_0 ^ 2 d^_0^d _",
    "0^ ^d^ + & & , [ 1.1.13 ] explicitly evaluating this integral we find = 54 + 112 ( 2)^2 - 154.5 20.719 [ 1.1.16 ] which is a bit larger than @xmath38 , the fidelity of the estimation of a state of a single qubit .",
    "let us now generalize this procedure .",
    "we shall again begin by choosing a random vector @xmath28 , but now according to a distribution @xmath39 , which we shall leave unspecified for now .",
    "the output density matrix is taken to be either @xmath40 if the measurement result is positive or @xmath41 if it is negative , where @xmath42 with @xmath43 , and |(^,^ ) _ _ ab = |00_ab + e^i^|+_ab .",
    "the conditional probabilities @xmath44 will also be left unspecified ; this allows us to consider a wide class of measurement - based strategies .",
    "the output density matrix , for a particular @xmath28 is then @xmath45 averaging over @xmath28 gives us the final output density matrix @xmath46 and the fidelities for a specific input state and averaged over all input states are given by eqs .",
    "( [ fidsp ] ) and ( [ fidgen ] ) , respectively , but with @xmath47 computed from eq .",
    "( [ outgen ] ) instead of eq .",
    "( [ 1.1.10 ] ) .",
    "in particular we have that @xmath48 where @xmath49 for @xmath43 , and @xmath50 , for any distribution of the vector @xmath28 and any prescription for using the result of the measurement along @xmath28 to manufacture the entangled state .",
    "we note that for @xmath43 @xmath51 which implies that @xmath52 where the supremums are taken over the range @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "our first task is to find explicit expressions for the functions @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "we have that    ' '' ''    ' '' ''    @xmath57    2 where @xmath58 from the above equations it is clear that in order to maximize @xmath55 we need to choose @xmath59 and to maximize @xmath56 we need to choose @xmath60 . making these choices and simplifying the resulting expressions",
    "we find that @xmath61 \\nonumber \\\\ f_{1}(\\vartheta^{\\prime\\prime},0;\\vartheta^{\\prime},0 ) & = & \\frac{1}{4}[1+c_{1}\\cos\\vartheta^{\\prime\\prime}+c_{2}\\cos \\vartheta^{\\prime\\prime}\\cos\\vartheta^{\\prime } \\nonumber \\\\   & & + c_{3}\\sin\\vartheta^{\\prime\\prime}\\sin\\vartheta^{\\prime}],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 these functions can now be maximized .",
    "the maximum of @xmath55 occurs at @xmath63 and @xmath64 , and the maximum of @xmath56 occurs when @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the maximum values of both functions are the same and are approximately equal to @xmath67 .",
    "this implies that the fidelity for this kind of a measurement - based strategy must satisfy @xmath68 as we shall see , a method which maintains quantum coherences at all stages of the process can do better than this .",
    "we now begin with systems @xmath7 and @xmath8 of the same physical origin .",
    "their pure states are described by vectors in the @xmath69-dimensional hilbert space @xmath70 , so that both together are described by @xmath71 .",
    "let @xmath72 be an orthonormal basis for @xmath70 .",
    "system @xmath7 is in the state @xmath73 and system @xmath8 is in the state @xmath74 our objective is to produce the ( entangled ) symmetrized state [ see eq .",
    "( [ 1.1 ] ) ] @xmath75 ) can be performed when the two input qubits interact via a controlled - swap ( fredkin ) gate with an ancilla initially prepared in a specific state .",
    "the entanglement is achieved when a conditional measurement is performed on the ancilla .",
    "exactly the same scenario can be used not only for qubits but for arbitrary quantum systems . to show this we briefly review the operation of the controlled - swap gate .",
    "this gate has three inputs .",
    "the first , the control bit , is a qubit .",
    "the second and third are for @xmath69-dimensional systems .",
    "the control bit is unaffected by the action of the gate .",
    "if the control bit is @xmath1 , then the gate does nothing , i.e.  the output state is the same as the input state .",
    "if the control bit is @xmath76 , then the two @xmath69-dimensional states are swapped .",
    "this can be accomplished by the following explicit unitary transformation : @xmath77 summarizing , the action of our controlled - swap gate is , @xmath78    we now define the qubit states @xmath79 and take the input state of the controlled - swap gate to be @xmath80 . using the swap transformation ( [ 2.5 ] )",
    "we find that the output state is @xmath81 if we now measure the qubit in the @xmath82 basis we obtain the states @xmath83 , respectively . as we see",
    "the probability of generation of a particular entangled state explicitly depends on the ( unknown ) states of the two systems .",
    "in particular , let us assume we begin with two orthogonal qubits , @xmath4 and @xmath84 .",
    "then either of the maximally entangled state , @xmath85 .",
    "we stress that the probability of the success in this entanglement ( symmetrization ) procedure is input - state dependent . in what follows",
    "our task will be to find a `` machine '' which entangles the input with a _ constant _",
    "( i.e. input - state independent ) fidelity .",
    "this covariance property of the entangler with respect to unitary transformations performed on the input qubits makes the entangler universal .",
    "suppose we again consider the problem of constructing a device which will entangle a qubit in an arbitrary unknown state @xmath86 with a qubit in a known , reference state , which we shall take to be the basis state @xmath1 .",
    "before we proceed further we have to specify properties of the entangling map .",
    "in fact , we can consider two maps .",
    "the symmetrization map : |0__a|__b |^(id)__ab= n_s(| |0+|0| ) , [ 3.1 ] and the anti - symmetrization map : |0__a|__b |^(id)__ab= n_a(| |0-|0| ) , [ 3.2 ] where @xmath87 are corresponding normalization factors . as we have shown in the introduction perfect entanglers for arbitrary unknown states can not be constructed .",
    "so the task of the physically realizable symmetric ( anti - symmetric ) entangler is to produce outputs as close as possible to the ideally entangled states @xmath35 ( @xmath88 ) . in what follows",
    "we will quantify the quality of the performance of the universal entangler with the help of the fidelity @xmath89 we shall impose the condition that the value of this fidelity does not depend on the input .",
    "the fidelity ( [ 3.3 ] ) is a good measure of the accuracy with which the entangler produces the desired output state , but we would also like to evaluate the degree of entanglement of the actual output state . here , however , we have a problem which is due to the fact that it is still not clear how to quantify the entanglement of a quantum system which is in a mixed state .",
    "when a bipartite system is in a pure state , then the von neumann entropy of subsystems can serve as a measure of entanglement . in the case of impure states",
    "more sophisticated measures are required ( see for instance @xcite ) .    in terms of the basis vectors , the input state is @xmath90 , and the ideal output state in the case of symmetrization is @xmath91 while in the case of the anti - symmetrization we have @xmath92 where @xmath93",
    "are symmetric and anti - symmetric bell states in the given basis @xmath94 in what follows we will briefly discuss the anti - symmetric entangler and then we will concentrate on the symmetric entangler .",
    "recently alber @xcite studied a quantum entangler which takes as an input a quantum - mechanical system prepared in an _ unknown _ pure state @xmath95 and a reference ( known ) state ( let us say @xmath96 ) and at the output generates a two particle entangled state @xmath97 which is optimally entangled .",
    "alber imposed two constraints on the output of the universal quantum entangler _ _",
    "a= tr__b= [ 3.7 ] and s. [ 3.8 ] where @xmath69 is the dimensionality of the hilbert space of the system @xmath7",
    "( @xmath8 ) and @xmath98 is the von neumann entropy @xmath99 associated with a given density operator @xmath100 .",
    "the first condition corresponds to the requirement that the subsystems at the output are in the maximally mixed state while the second conditions guarantees that the whole system is as close as possible to a pure two - particle state .",
    "alber has found the solution for this problem .",
    "it turns out that the two - particle state which is produced by the optimal ( with respect to the above conditions ) , universal entangler is _ independent _ of the input state @xmath0 and is equal to a maximally disordered mixture of all possible anti - symmetric bell states . in the case of qubits ( @xmath101 )",
    "there is only one possible anti - symmetric bell state @xmath102 .",
    "that is , alber s machine realizes the anti - symmetric entangler .",
    "we see that the universality of alber s entangler means that all inputs are mapped to a single output ( the anti - symmetric bell state @xmath102 ) , so the ideal output state is _ a priori _ known , and one could instead build a device which just prepares the known output state . in the antisymmetric entangler",
    "the information initially encoded in the qubit @xmath7 is completely lost .",
    "but our task is different , we want to redistribute the initial _ unknown _ information encoded in the state of the qubit @xmath7 , into the entangled state of two qubits . therefore we will analyze universal entanglement via symmetrization , because the ideal state ( [ 3.4 ] ) directly contains information about the initial state of the qubit @xmath7 .",
    "in other words , we consider the entangling procedure not only as the way to generate the state with highest possible entanglement but also we require that this state contains as much information about the input(s ) as possible .",
    "let us now construct a machine which entangles an unknown state with the known state @xmath1 .",
    "taking into account the basic features of the symmetrization transformation ( [ 3.1 ] ) we can assume that the basis vectors transform as @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 are states of the entangler itself .",
    "the entangler is initially always prepared in the state @xmath107 .",
    "we want to impose the condition that the fidelity between the actual output state and the ideal output state be _ independent _ of the state @xmath0 , but before doing so let us state the restrictions which unitarity places on the machine vectors .",
    "these are @xmath108 where @xmath109 .",
    "we now calculate the output two - qubit density matrix @xmath47 by using the transformation in eq .",
    "( [ 3.9 ] ) to find the full output density matrix and then tracing out the machine degrees of freedom .",
    "we then find the fidelity ( [ 3.3 ] ) by taking the matrix element of this density matrix in the ideal output state .",
    "our task is to find the machine vectors @xmath110 and @xmath111 ( @xmath43 ) such that the fidelity @xmath112 does not depend on the input state @xmath4 and simultaneously is as close as possible to unity .",
    "we find that if we choose @xmath105 to be orthogonal to each of the other machine vectors and @xmath104 to be orthogonal to @xmath105 and @xmath113 , then the output fidelity will be independent of the phases of @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "making these choices we find that @xmath116\\right\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath117 .    in order for this expression to be independent of @xmath118 and @xmath119",
    "it is necessary that the expression in the curly brackets be proportional to @xmath120 comparing this expression to eq .",
    "( [ 3.11 ] ) we see that @xmath121 if these conditions are satisfied , then the fidelity is simply equal to @xmath122 , so that we want to make this quantity as large as possible .",
    "if we now make use of the unitarity conditions and the two equations above , we find that @xmath123 where @xmath124 from eq .",
    "( [ w00 ] ) we see that @xmath122 will be a maximum when @xmath125 , which implies that @xmath113 and @xmath106 are parallel .",
    "when this condition is satisfied , we find that @xmath126 which gives @xmath127 as the approximate value of the fidelity .",
    "this means that the output state @xmath47 is indeed very close to the ideal state , and it should be remembered that this fidelity is the same for all input states .",
    "we can summarize our results for the machine vectors as follows . from the above analysis",
    "we see that we can take the machine state space to be _ three _ dimensional .",
    "define @xmath128^{1/2 } ; \\qquad \\sin\\theta = \\left [ \\frac{5 - 3\\sqrt{2}}{14}\\right]^{1/2 } , \\label{3.17}\\ ] ] and let @xmath129 be an orthonormal basis for the machine vector space .",
    "we then have @xmath130 by construction this is the _ optimal _ entangling transformation which entangles an unknown pure state with a known reference state .    alternatively ,",
    "for @xmath131 we can rewrite this transformation in the form @xmath132 when the trace over the entangler is performed we obtain the density operator @xmath133 describing the two qubits @xmath7 and @xmath8 at the output of the quantum entangler @xmath134 it is important to stress that the fidelity ( [ 3.3 ] ) associated with the output state ( [ 3.20 ] ) is input state independent .      throughout this paper",
    "we have utilized the fidelity ( [ 3.3 ] ) as the measure of the performance of the quantum entangler .",
    "the universality ( covariance ) of the entangler is expressed in the fact that the value of the fidelity @xmath135 is equal for all input states .",
    "we note that this covariance constraint is equivalent to the requirement that the bures distance @xcite defined as @xmath136 between the ideal state @xmath137 and the output of the entangler @xmath97 is constant . in our particular case",
    "we find the bures distance to be d_b= 2 ( /2 ) 0.0541 , [ 3.23 ] for all inputs .",
    "this distance is very small indeed .",
    "it is important to note that the hilbert - schmidt norm d_hs(_1,_2)=^1/2 , [ 3.24 ] which in our case can be expressed as d_hs=^1/2 , [ 3.25 ] is _ not _ input - state independent because @xmath138 depends on the initial state .",
    "this is closely related to the fact that the von neumann entropy of the state @xmath97 is state dependent ( see below ) .",
    "we note that the entanglement between the two qubits prepared in the state @xmath137 depends on the particular form of the state @xmath139 . because @xmath137 is a pure state we can quantify the degree of entanglement via the von neumann entropy @xmath98 of one of the two qubits under consideration , i.e. @xmath140 $ ] ( obviously @xmath141 ) . for @xmath142",
    "the entropy is equal to zero , which corresponds to a completely disentangled state ( we note that in this case @xmath143 ) .",
    "the entropy takes the maximal value @xmath144 for @xmath145 when @xmath146 .",
    "we plot this entropy in fig .",
    "[ ent_fig1 ] ( see line 1 ) .",
    "the entropy of the individual particle ( qubit ) at the output of the entangler , i.e. @xmath147 is always larger than in the ideal case ( see line 2 in fig .",
    "[ ent_fig1 ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , for the case @xmath145 we have in this case @xmath148 , i.e. this entropy is very close to the entropy of a qubit in the ideal case .",
    "unfortunately , this entropy in the case of an impure two - particle state can not be used as a measure of entanglement .",
    "it is interesting to find the entropy of the two - particle state @xmath133 at the output of the entangler as a function of the initial state ( in the ideal case the two - particle system is always considered to be in a pure state with @xmath149 ) .",
    "we plot this entropy in fig .",
    "[ ent_fig2 ] .",
    "we see that the total entropy of the output is state - dependent and it takes the minimal value for @xmath150 .",
    "therefore the entropy of the subsystems does not indicate whether they are entangled .",
    "we need to check whether the two qubits @xmath7 and @xmath8 at the output are indeed quantum - mechanically entangled .",
    "quantum - mechanical entanglement of two qubits formally means that the density operator of these two qubits is represented by an inseparable matrix ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it follows from the peres - horodecki theorem that @xcite the necessary and sufficient condition of inseparability of the two - qubit density matrix @xmath151 is that the corresponding partially transposed matrix @xmath152 has at least one negative eigenvalue .    for instance",
    ", let us consider the state @xmath139 with real amplitudes @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "the partially transposed matrix corresponding to the state @xmath137 given by eq.([3.4 ] ) has one negative eigenvalue @xmath153 we plot this eigenvalue in fig .",

    "the minimal value of the eigenvalue is achieved for @xmath145 when the two qubits are in the maximally entangled state @xmath154 .",
    "now we utilize the peres - horodecki theorem to check whether the state @xmath97 given by eq .",
    "( [ 3.21 ] ) describes an entangled state of two qubits .",
    "firstly , we find that the partially transposed matrix corresponding to the density operator ( [ 3.21 ] ) has one eigenvalue which is negative for all values of @xmath114 ( here we assume @xmath114 and @xmath115 to be real ) . in particular , this eigenvalue for @xmath145 is @xmath155 , \\label{3.27}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is the minimal value ( @xmath156 ) of the negative eigenvalue . on the other hand the maximal value ( @xmath157 )",

    "[ ent_fig3 ] . from this figure",
    "we clearly see that the output density operator is inseparable for an arbitrary input considered in this section .",
    "we note , that if the entanglement is measured in terms of the tangle as introduced by wootters @xcite then the negative eigenvalues @xmath160 of the partially transposed density operators perfectly reflect the degree of entanglement between the two qubits in our cases .    by construction",
    "the fidelity of the entangler in this case is constant but the actual degree of entanglement is state - dependent .",
    "this suggests that it would be interesting to find an entangler , whose output states have the same degree of entanglement irrespective of the input , yet still carry information about the input .",
    "even though the negative eigenvalue of the partially transposed density matrix can not be directly used as the measure of entanglement , we see that the degree of entanglement between two qubits generated in the entangler ( [ 3.19 ] ) depends on the input state . in what follows",
    "we describe a different type of the entangler , which out of a single qubit @xmath4 generates a two - qubit state as close as possible to the state @xmath161 we will present an entangler which not only produces the state which is as close as possible to the ideal state @xmath162 but also has the property that the fidelity does not depend on the input state . in addition , the degree of entanglement also does not depend on the input .",
    "this type of the entangler implicitly assumes creation of the state @xmath163 from the input @xmath0 .",
    "that is , we face the problem of creating an orthogonal state from unknown input .",
    "it is not a problem to complement a classical bit , i.e. to change the value of a bit , a @xmath164 to a @xmath165 and vice versa .",
    "this is accomplished by a not gate . complementing a qubit",
    ", however , is another matter .",
    "the complement of a qubit @xmath0 is the qubit @xmath166 which is orthogonal to it .",
    "but it is not possible to build a device which will take an _ arbitrary _ ( unknown ) qubit and transform it into the qubit orthogonal to it . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite the ideal universal - not ( u - not ) operation corresponds to the _ inversion of the bloch ( poincar ) sphere_. this inversion preserves angles ( related in a simple way to the scalar product @xmath167 of rays ) , so by wigner s theorem the ideal u - not must be implemented either by a unitary or by an anti - unitary operation .",
    "unitary operations correspond to proper rotations of the poincar sphere , whereas anti - unitary operations correspond to orthogonal transformations with determinant @xmath168 .",
    "clearly , the u - not operation is of the latter kind , and an anti - unitary operator @xmath169 ( unique up to a phase ) implementing it is @xmath170 the difficulty with anti - unitarily implemented symmetries is that they are not completely positive , i.e. , they can not be applied to a small system , leaving the rest of the world alone .",
    "because we can not design a perfect universal - not gate , we have introduced in ref.@xcite an approximate _ optimal _ u - not gate ( an analogous spin - flip operation has recently been introduced by gisin and popescu @xcite ) .",
    "this device takes as an input the qubit @xmath7 in the state @xmath0 and generates at the output a qubit in a mixed state as close as possible to the orthogonal state @xmath163 .",
    "the role of the u - not gate is played by two additional ( ancilla ) qubits @xmath8 and @xmath171 .",
    "so , all together the transformation involves three qubits and it can be explicitly written as @xmath172 where @xmath173 is the initial state of the u - not gate ; @xmath174 and @xmath175 . in this particular transformation",
    "the qubit @xmath171 at the output is in the state which is as orthogonal as possible to the input state .",
    "the fidelity of this transformation is input - state independent and is equal to @xmath176 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the two - qubit state @xmath97 at the output of the u - not gate ( [ 4.2 ] ) has the form @xmath177 the mean fidelity between the state @xmath97 and the ideal output ( [ 4.1 ] ) is input - state independent and takes the value @xmath178 .",
    "this again corresponds to the fact that the bures distance between the actual output of the entangler and the ideal output is input state independent and equal to @xmath179 .",
    "we can easily check that the partially transposed matrix corresponding to the density operator ( [ 4.3 ] ) has one negative eigenvalue @xmath180 which is constant and does not depend on the initial input state @xmath4 .",
    "we note that the universal not gate ( [ 4.2 ] ) acts also a quantum cloner , i.e. the two qubits @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the optimal clones of the input ( for details see refs.@xcite ) .",
    "it is the optimality of the transformation ( [ 4.2 ] ) with respect to cloning and the generation of the optimally orthogonal state ( i.e. the universal not gate ) which indicates that the transformation ( [ 4.2 ] ) also serves as the optimal universal entangler .",
    "our proof of the optimality of the entangler ( [ 4.1 ] ) via the u - not gate is based on the recent idea of gisin @xcite that the impossibility of instantaneous signaling generates upper bounds on the fidelity of particular quantum - mechanical processes . to be more specific ,",
    "we have shown earlier that the impossibility of the ideal ( perfect ) entangler is due to the linearity of quantum mechanics .",
    "on the other hand , another consequence of the linearity of quantum mechanics is the fact that the entangled quantum - mechanical states can not be used for super - luminal communication .",
    "gisin @xcite has shown that this no - signaling constraint implies bounds on the fidelity of universal cloning and the universal u - not gate . in the case of cloning the bound on fidelity",
    "is @xmath181 , while in the case of the u - not gate the bound is @xmath176 .",
    "we note that the transformation ( [ 4.2 ] ) achieves both these bounds when used as the cloner or the u - not gate , respectively .",
    "recently alber @xcite used this idea of gisin to prove that the upper bound in the fidelity of the anti - symmetric entangling is equal to unity .",
    "the no - signaling constraint can also be used to derive an upper bound on the fidelity of the entangling operation given in eq .",
    "( [ 4.1 ] ) @xcite .",
    "we will present a proof , which is based on the methods developed in reference @xcite , that this upper bound is @xmath178 , which means that the u - not gate ( [ 4.2 ] ) serves as the _ optimal _ universal entangler in the sense of eq .",
    "( [ 4.1 ] ) .",
    "we consider a process in which a single particle input state is mapped into a two particle output state .",
    "the input state can be represented as @xmath182 where @xmath183 is a real vector whose length is less than or equal to unity .",
    "the most general two - particle output state , which is hermitian and has a trace equal to one , can be expressed as ^(out ) ( ) & = & [ + + + & + & _ j , k = x , y , z t_jk_j_k ] , where @xmath184 , @xmath185 , and @xmath186 are functions of @xmath183 .",
    "the requirement that the reduced density matrixes of the two output particles be the same , which we shall impose , implies that @xmath187 .",
    "we now want to impose the requirement of covariance .",
    "this means that if @xmath188 is mapped onto @xmath189 , and if @xmath190 is a matrix in @xmath191 , then the input state @xmath192 will be mapped onto the output state @xmath193 .",
    "another way of stating this condition is obtained by noting that if we express @xmath190 as @xmath194 where @xmath195 is a unit vector corresponding to the rotation axis and @xmath196 is the rotation angle , then @xmath197 where @xmath198 .",
    "the rotation matrix , @xmath199 , is the @xmath200 matrix which rotates a vector about the axis @xmath195 by an angle @xmath196 , and it is given explicitly by @xmath201 where @xmath202 we have that @xmath203 which will be mapped to @xmath204 , so that the covariance condition can now be expressed as @xmath205    now let us examine the consequences of this relation .",
    "we shall first consider the terms linear in @xmath206 and let @xmath207 be a rotation about @xmath183 by a very small angle @xmath196 .",
    "we have that @xmath208 which for our choice of rotation becomes @xmath209 or @xmath210 where @xmath211 is a unit vector in the direction of @xmath183 .",

    "( [ ra ] ) and consider a general rotation @xmath207 , we have that @xmath215 this implies that @xmath216 is a constant , which , following @xcite , we shall denote by @xmath217 .",
    "now let us see what covariance implies about the terms quadratic in @xmath206 .",
    "application of the covariance condition , eq . ( [ cov ] ) , to these terms gives @xmath218 if we again choose @xmath207 to be a rotation about @xmath183 by a small angle @xmath196 , we find the condition @xmath219 if we choose @xmath183 to be in the @xmath220 direction , in particular @xmath221 , we find , as did gisin , that @xmath222 , @xmath223 , and @xmath224 , where all of these are evaluated at @xmath221 .",
    "we now want to impose the no signaling condition @xmath225 and to do so we need to find all of the density matrixes in the above equation in terms of @xmath226 .",
    "this can be done by applying the covariance condition , eq .",
    "( [ cov ] ) , to @xmath227 and making the proper choice of @xmath207 . when these results are substituted into eq .",
    "( [ nosig ] ) we find that @xmath228 , and we shall designate this common value by @xmath229 .",
    "we then have that @xmath230 the basis in which the matrix is expressed is @xmath231 , where @xmath232 .",
    "this matrix must be positive , which implies that the eigenvalues @xmath233 must be nonnegative .",
    "for an input state @xmath234 our desired output state is @xmath235 , and this implies that the fidelity of @xmath47 is @xmath236 this",
    "is clearly maximized when @xmath237 is as large as possible , and examining the eigenvalues of @xmath47 , this happens when @xmath238 and @xmath239 . substituting this into the expression for the fidelity",
    ", we see that the maximum fidelity is @xmath240 .",
    "this means that the no - signaling constraint specifies the upper bound on the fidelity of the symmetric entangling which is exactly the same one as achieved by the u - not gate .",
    "this proves that the entangling via the u - not gate is optimal .",
    "we note that using the universal not gate one can also produce an entangled state of the form ( [ 3.1 ] ) .",
    "specifically , the u - not gate allows charlie ( c ) to produce an entangled state , consisting of @xmath4 and one of two known states , which is shared by alice ( a ) and bob ( b ) . in order to see how",
