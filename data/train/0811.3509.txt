    "an open classical system in contact with a heat bath can often be modeled in terms of a langevin dynamics with constant friction and white gaussian noise sources obeying a fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xcite .",
    "a remarkable feature then is the circumstance that the equilibrium statistics of the open classical system turns out to be _ independent _ of the coupling strength between the system and the heat bath . in other words ,",
    "the canonical equilibrium for a classical damped langevin dynamics agrees with the canonical equilibrium of the isolated system .",
    "this feature is rooted in the fact that in this case the so termed `` hamiltonian of mean force '' is still given by the bare system hamiltonian @xcite . in clear contrast , this property in general no longer holds true for open systems in the quantum regime beyond the weak - coupling limit @xcite .",
    "in particular , the canonical equilibrium state of an open quantum system then typically involves an explicit dependence on the system - bath coupling strength .    motivated by this fact ,",
    "the study of the specific heat beyond the weak - coupling limit has recently received considerable attention , in particular in view of the validity of the third law of thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "apart from fundamental thermodynamical questions the study of the specific heat in the quantum regime is also of interest because it can be related to entanglement properties @xcite .",
    "recently , two different routes towards the evaluation of a specific heat were proposed and discussed @xcite .",
    "one possibility is based on the thermal expectation value of the hamiltonian describing the isolated system .",
    "another approach , on which we will focus in this paper , starts out from the thermodynamic partition function of the dissipative system @xcite @xmath0 }       { \\mathrm{tr}_\\mathrm{b}[\\exp(-\\beta h_\\mathrm{b})]}\\ ] ] where the total hamiltonian @xmath1 consists of terms describing the system , the bath , and the system - bath coupling , respectively . in the absence of a coupling between system and bath",
    ", @xmath2 reduces to the partition function of the system .",
    "the partition function ( [ eq : partitionfunction ] ) appears naturally in the feynman - vernon approach to dissipative systems @xcite and can be related to equilibrium properties of the system @xcite .    from ( [ eq : partitionfunction ] )",
    ", one obtains by means of standard thermodynamic relations a specific heat @xcite , reading @xmath3 here , @xmath4 is the boltzmann constant and the temperature @xmath5 appears through @xmath6 .    in the following , we will assume the bath to consist of harmonic oscillators and the coupling to be bilinear in system and bath coordinates @xcite .",
    "in such a framework ref .",
    "@xcite found for the damped free particle , that under certain circumstances the specific heat ( [ eq : specificheat ] ) can become negative . in the case of the drude model , for example , where the laplace transform of the damping kernel",
    "is given by @xmath7 the specific heat exhibits negative values at low temperatures if the damping constant @xmath8 exceeds the cut - off frequency @xmath9 , i.e. @xmath10 .",
    "this behavior is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : c ] . for a general damping kernel",

    "note that in contrast to ref .",
    "@xcite , temperature is given in units of the cutoff frequency @xmath9 instead of the damping strength @xmath8 . ]    in this paper , we will elucidate the origin of the negative specific heat for the case of the free damped particle and its absence for the damped harmonic oscillator by considering two minimal models . before doing so ,",
    "a general comment on the appearance of a negative specific heat is appropriate .",
    "the rationale behind the definition of a specific heat based on the thermodynamic partition function ( [ eq : partitionfunction ] ) is that this partition function should be associated with an effective description of an open system . from this point of view",
    ", a negative specific heat may appear disturbing because it raises doubts as to the thermodynamic stability of the system .",
    "however , the meaning of the thermodynamic partition function ( [ eq : partitionfunction ] ) of the open system can be better understood from the point of view of its finite coupling to the heat bath . the specific heat ( [ eq : specificheat ] ) can in fact",
    "be expressed as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the specific heat of system and heat bath while @xmath15 is the specific heat of the heat bath alone .",
    "therefore , @xmath16 describes the change of the specific heat when the heat bath is enlarged by coupling it to system degrees of freedom .",
    "this difference expression in ( [ c_diff ] ) must be expected on physical grounds when dealing with an _ open _ system that is not heat - isolated from its environment .",
    "for example , take a certain amount of an agent within a container : the established experimental procedure to determine the specific heat of this agent is first to measure the specific heat of the empty container and to subtract this value from the measured specific heat of the combined system to finally arrive at the specific heat of the agent alone . for a macroscopic amount of the agent",
    "this value is truly agent specific , i.e. independent of the particular nature of the container and its interaction with the agent ( provided the interaction of the agent with the container is short ranged ) . for a nanoscopic system , however , the energy that is contained in the system - bath coupling typically can not be neglected and consequently will influence the specific heat of such a system .",
    "notably the thermodynamic internal energy of the open system also typically differs from the thermal expectation of the bare system hamiltonian @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the values of the specific heat evaluated along such different routes then differ as well @xcite .",
    "the coupling can thus result in a negative specific heat of the open quantum system .",
    "however , the involved specific heats , i.e. those of system plus bath on the one hand and of the bath alone on the other hand , are each positive so that no issues concerning the thermodynamic stability arise @xcite .",
    "such physical situations are not uncommon as evidenced by recent discussions in the context of the casimir effect @xcite , the multichannel kondo effect @xcite , or the physics of mesoscopic superconductors that contain magnetic impurities @xcite .",
    "in order to elucidate the appearance of a negative specific heat ( [ eq : specificheat ] ) it is sufficient to consider a stylized , minimal model where the `` bath '' consists of only a single degree of freedom described by the hamiltonian @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the spring constant . in the following",
    ", we will study a system governed by the hamiltonian @xmath19 both in the cases of a free particle ( spring constant @xmath20 ) and of a harmonic oscillator ( @xmath21 ) .",

    "the difference in the behavior of the free particle and the harmonic oscillator can be traced back to the specific heat of the uncoupled system which for the free particle is smaller by a factor of two .",
    "all those quantities that are obtained from the logarithm of the partition function by means of a linear operation can be interpreted as differences between the corresponding quantities of the total system plus bath and of the bath alone .",
