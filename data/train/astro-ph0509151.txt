    "in this paper we explore implications of data on c , o , and si in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) for the `` metal '' sources . in earlier works ( wasserburg & qian 2000 ; qian & wasserburg 2002 ;",
    "see also qian , sargent , & wasserburg 2002 ) , we proposed that very massive ( @xmath0 ) stars ( vmss ) formed from big bang debris produced a prompt metal inventory in the igm at the level of [ fe / h]@xmath20 , where ( fe / h ) is the number ratio of fe to h. this was based on observations of metal - poor stars in the galactic halo that showed a sudden jump in the production of heavy rapid - neutron - capture ( @xmath21-process ) elements such as ba and eu relative to fe at [ fe / h ]  @xmath22 ( e.g. , mcwilliam et al .",
    "1995 ; burris et al .",
    "we inferred that the jump was due to the onset of major production of the heavy @xmath21-process elements by a class of supernovae associated with normal stars , which could predominantly form only after vmss had provided a metallicity at the level of [ fe / h]@xmath23 to the igm .",
    "this is supported by theoretical models of star formation , which suggested that a critical metallicity of @xmath24 times the solar value is required for sufficient cooling of gas clouds to form low - mass protostellar aggregates ( bromm et al .",
    "2001 ; see also bromm & loeb 2003 )",
    ". using vms yields of heger & woosley ( 2002 , hereafter hw02 ) , oh et al .",
    "( 2001 ) showed that there would be sufficient hard uv photons emitted from vmss to reionize the universe if these stars were to provide [ si / h]@xmath25 ( e.g. , cowie & songaila 1998 ; ellison et al .",
    "2000 ; see also aguirre et al .",
    "we here consider both early vmss and later galactic outflows for metal enrichment of the igm .",
    "it is argued that vmss ( @xmath2@xmath3 ) associated with pair - instability supernovae ( pi - sne ; hw02 ) are the dominant source of si and also made substantial contributions to c and o. the dominant contributions to c and o are from later galactic outflows governed by type ii supernovae ( sne ii ) .",
    "we then show that for a plausible initial mass function ( imf ) , the metal ( particularly si ) inventory in the igm due to pi - sne is coupled with production of black holes by vmss with @xmath26 .",
    "thus , there is concomitant production of both metals and massive black holes at early epochs .",
    "the present study is an extension of our previous work ( qian & wasserburg 2005 , hereafter qw05 ) , where we sought to explain the data on c , o , and si in the igm using a number of vms and sn ii models and considering a wide range of imfs for vmss . in that work",
    ", we showed from detailed arguments that vmss associated with pi - sne are required to account for the si / c ratio in the igm and that the preferred scenario for metal enrichment of the igm is a combination of contributions from early vmss and later galactic outflows . in the present paper , we assume the basic conclusions of that work and adopt the same input and formalism to develop the general self - consistent implications of the chemical evolution model used there .",
    "the new results to be presented include the constraint on the redshift for termination of vms contributions and the relationship between metal production by pi - sne and the early inventory of massive black holes .",
    "we first review the issues .",
    "there is a substantial inventory of metals in the general igm over a wide range of redshift , @xmath275.5 ( e.g. , songaila 2001 ; pettini et al . 2003 ) .",
    "detailed studies of quasar absorption spectra have established abundances of the ionic species , , , , and in the ly@xmath28 forest ( see schaye et al . 2003 ; aguirre et al . 2004 ; and simcoe et al .",
    "2004 for recent analyses ) .",
    "the corresponding elemental abundances have been determined using models of the uv background ( uvb ; haardt & madau 1996 , 2001 ) to account for the fraction of an element in a specific ionization stage .",
    "two typical uvb models are model q , which has a harder uvb provided by quasars only , and model qg , which has a softer uvb provided by both quasars and galaxies . for both models ,",
    "schaye et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and aguirre et al .",
    "( 2004 ) found that c and si abundances are quite variable over different regions .",
    "for a given density of the ly@xmath28 forest , the abundance of , say c , appears to follow a lognormal distribution . the net inventory of c over the density range ( 0.32 to 63 times the cosmic mean ) covered by the data is [ c / h]@xmath29 for uvb model q and @xmath30 for model qg .",
    "for either model , schaye et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and aguirre et al .",
    "( 2004 ) found that neither [ c / h]@xmath31 nor [ si / h]@xmath31 show evidence of evolution in the range @xmath324.1 . using the data at @xmath33 and similar uvb models , simcoe et al .",
    "( 2004 ) also found lognormal distributions for c and o abundances .",
    "the results of the above groups for [ c / h]@xmath31 are in good agreement for either uvb model .",
    "the observed variability of abundances in different regions must be a result of varying degrees of mixing .",
    "however , there is no apparent variation of the si / c or c / o ratio ( aguirre et al .",
    "2004 ; simcoe et al .",
    "2004 ) . in the models presented below ,",
    "we will focus on the net igm inventory and the associated elemental ratios .",
    "the distribution of metals is not treated .    from the observations",
    "there is no apparent evolution of the igm inventory over @xmath324.1 .",
    "thus , this inventory must have been produced prior to @xmath6 .",

    "are potential diagnostics of the sources .",
    "these ratios are sensitive to the uvb model . as both of these ratios are available for models q and qg , we discuss these two uvb models first .",
    "while model q gives [ si / c]@xmath37 and [ c / o]@xmath38 , model qg gives much lower values of [ si / c]@xmath39 and [ c / o]@xmath40 ( aguirre et al .",
    "2004 ; simcoe et al . 2004 ) . for both models [",
    "si / c]@xmath31 is quite high and points to vms sources ( schaerer 2002 ; aguirre et al .",
    "2004 ) . for uvb model",
    "qg , [ si / c]@xmath31 is well above the yield ratio of sn ii sources but below that of pure vms sources ( see table 2 of qw05 ) .",
    "the value of [ si / c]@xmath31 for model q is so high that it can be barely matched by the yield ratio of a pure vms source .",
    "we have shown earlier ( qw05 ) that the values of [ si / c]@xmath31 and [ c / o]@xmath31 for uvb model q can not be accounted for simultaneously by any existing stellar models .",
    "however , both elemental ratios for model qg can be matched using a combination of vms and sn ii sources .",
    "results on [ si / c]@xmath31 only were also given by aguirre et al .",
    "( 2004 ) for models qgs and qgs3.2 , both of which have an even softer uvb than model qg .",
    "model qgs gives [ si / c]@xmath41 while model qgs3.2 gives [ si / c]@xmath42 .",
    "these [ si / c]@xmath31 values are consistent with the yield ratio of sn ii sources but significantly below that of pure vms sources ( see table 2 of qw05 ) .",
    "consequently , were the composition of the igm characterized by these [ si / c]@xmath31 values , there would be no requirement of vms contributions .",
    "however , schaye et al . ( 2003 ) showed that for uvb model qgs , the c abundance strongly decreases with time for all densities , which is clearly unphysical .",
    "furthermore , model qgs3.2 predicts a jump in the optical depth of relative to due to the sudden transition in its uvb at @xmath43 .",
    "this is disfavored by the observations ( aguirre et al .",
    "in contrast , uvb model qg appears compatible with all the observations so far and also gives physical results regarding the evolution of metallicity with time and density ( schaye et al .",
    "2003 ; aguirre et al .",
    "therefore , it seems unlikely that this model could be seriously in error ( aguirre et al .",
    "the results on the igm inventory for uvb model qg ( see table 1 ) will be used in the subsequent presentation . as shown by qw05",
    ", vms contributions are required to match [ si / c]@xmath31 for this model and both [ si / c]@xmath31 and [ c / o]@xmath31 for this model can be accounted for by a blend of vms and sn ii contributions .",
    "insofar as [ si / c]@xmath31 is approximately at or above the value given by this model , these results appear robust . the high value of [ si / c]@xmath31 was not discussed in the recent critique of vms models by tumlinson , venkatesan , & shull ( 2004 ) or in another study by daigne et al .",
    "in particular , daigne et al .",
    "( 2004 ) concluded that `` there is no evidence , nor any need , for a hypothesized primordial population of very massive stars in order to account for the chemical abundances of extremely metal - poor halo stars or of the intergalactic medium . ''",
    "we consider that further improvements in measurements and analyses of the igm abundances , as well as further theoretical studies of the conditions under which stars of extremely low metallicity can form , will clarify the choice between the metal enrichment scenarios with and without vmss .",
    "based on the high value of [ si / c]@xmath31 for uvb model",
    "qg , we use the vms model of hw02 and the low - metallicity sn ii model of woosley & weaver ( 1995 , hereafter ww95 ) to quantify vms contributions to the igm .",
    "the vmss relevant for metal enrichment are in the mass range @xmath2@xmath3 and produce pi - sne ( hw02 ) .",
    "a salpeter imf is assumed for both vmss and sne ii and the corresponding yield ratios are given in table 1 ( models 2a and 6 in table 2 of qw05 ) . using these yield ratios",
    ", we can find mixtures of vms and sn ii contributions that can account for [ si / c]@xmath31 and [ c / o]@xmath31 simultaneously . as both [ c / o]@xmath44 and [ c / o]@xmath45 are within 0.1 dex of [ c / o]@xmath40 , the appropriate mixture is determined by matching [ si / c]@xmath31 .",
    "the required fraction @xmath46 of si contributed by vmss can be calculated from @xmath47 with [ si / c]@xmath48 and [ si / c]@xmath49 , @xmath50 is required to match [ si / c]@xmath39 exactly and @xmath51 gives [ si / c ]  @xmath52 .",
    "therefore , vmss must be the dominant source of si .",
    "this result does not depend on the specific stellar models adopted here .",
    "in fact , as other sn ii models have lower values of [ si / c]@xmath53 ( see table 2 of qw05 ) , using them only strengthens the above result .",
    "we conclude that a minimum value of @xmath54 is required to account for the observed elemental ratios in the igm . for the stellar models adopted here",
    ", @xmath54 corresponds to @xmath55 and @xmath56 , so sne ii are the dominant source of c and o. this conclusion can be generalized to all stellar models as well .",
    "we now discuss metal enrichment of the igm by vmss .",
    "the formation of these stars is supposed to precede that of lower - mass stars and occur in halos where big bang debris can cool by h@xmath19 molecules ( see abel et al . 2002 ; bromm & larson 2004 for reviews ) .",
    "this requires a minimum halo mass of @xmath4 .",
    "the efficiency of vms formation in such low - mass halos determines how early vmss could provide substantial enrichment to the igm . for a simple estimate",
    ", we consider that all halos with mass @xmath57 are formed from `` building - block '' halos with mass @xmath58 .",
    "we assume that a vms would have formed in every `` building - block '' halo and ejected all its nucleosynthetic products into the igm .",
    "then at redshift @xmath59 , the abundance of element e in the igm would be @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the average mass yield of e per vms event , @xmath62 is the fraction of all matter residing in halos with @xmath57 at redshift @xmath59 , @xmath63 is the solar mass fraction of e , and @xmath64 is the baryonic fraction of the halo mass . consider si as an example . using @xmath65 ( hw02 ) , @xmath66 ( anders & grevesse 1989 ) , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 , we obtain @xmath69 .",
    "the function @xmath70 can be estimated using the press - schechter formalism ( press & schechter 1974 ) and ranges from @xmath71% to 3% for @xmath72 to 17 .",
    "thus , if vmss are to provide 50% of the measured inventory of [ si / h]@xmath73 ( aguirre et al .",
    "2004 ) , this requires that a vms form in every `` building - block '' halo by @xmath72 or more plausibly , in @xmath74% of such halos by @xmath75 .    for a formal and self - consistent model of the chemical evolution of the igm using the rate of occurrence of a vms event in a halo",
    ", we consider a large reference region of the universe and treat it as a closed homogeneous system ( qw05 ) .",
    "the evolution of ( e / h)@xmath31 in the system as a function of time @xmath76 is governed by @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the net rate for ejection of e atoms into the igm and ( h)@xmath31 is the number of h atoms in the igm .",
    "the rate @xmath78 depends on the rate of occurrence of a vms event and the efficiency of gas expulsion by the vms explosion .",
    "we consider that a vms may form in a halo when the virial temperature @xmath79 of the gas reaches a minimum value of @xmath80  k for h@xmath19 cooling . for @xmath81 , @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the mean atomic weight and @xmath84 or 0.6 for a neutral or ionized gas , respectively , with a primordial composition of h and he .",
    "we assume that all the gas would be expelled from the halo by the vms explosion if the gravitational binding energy of the gas @xmath85 is less than the vms explosion energy @xmath86 ( e.g. , bromm , yoshida , & hernquist 2003 ) and retained for @xmath87 . for @xmath81 , @xmath88 for a given @xmath59 , a halo associated with an @xmath89 density fluctuation ( an @xmath89 halo ) would have the mass @xmath90 corresponding to @xmath91 for the onset of vms formation , while an @xmath92 halo would have the mass @xmath93 corresponding to @xmath94 for the onset of gas retention .",
    "then we have @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the total number of halos with a specific @xmath97 value in the system and @xmath98 is the number production rate of e in a single @xmath99 halo .",
    "the rate @xmath98 is related to the rate of occurrence of a vms event @xmath100 in an @xmath99 halo .",
    "we assume that these rates are proportional to the number ( h)@xmath101 of h atoms in the gas of the halo and write @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the average number yield of e per vms event corresponding to the mass yield @xmath61 and @xmath104 is a rate constant .",
    "the above prescription of @xmath105 is meant to imply that it is more probable for a vms to form in a larger halo , and we will discuss the limit on the occurrence of a vms event in a typical halo below . substituting @xmath78 in equation  ( [ dehdt ] ) and noting that for @xmath81 the majority of the h atoms of the system resides in the igm and the majority of the h atoms in a halo resides in the gas , we obtain @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the fraction of all matter residing in @xmath99 halos with @xmath108 as given by the press - schechter formalism and @xmath109^{3/2}$ ]  gyr for the adopted cosmology ( see discussion in barkana & loeb 2001 ) .",
    "the evolution of @xmath110 is thus only dependent on @xmath104 and @xmath111 .",
    "as @xmath110 scales with @xmath104 , we will use @xmath112  gyr@xmath17 as a reference value ( for elements produced by sne ii only , the average galactic value of @xmath113 is @xmath114  gyr@xmath17 over a period of @xmath74  gyr prior to solar system formation ; qw05 ) . to determine @xmath111",
    ", we use @xmath80  k ( @xmath84 ) to find @xmath90 and a typical vms explosion energy of @xmath115  erg ( hw02 ) to find @xmath93 for which @xmath94 .",
    "the relevant range of @xmath99 halos with @xmath116 ( @xmath108 ) corresponds to @xmath117 ( @xmath118 ) at @xmath119 and @xmath120 ( @xmath121 ) at @xmath122 .",
    "although the range @xmath116 is rather wide , the integral for @xmath111 is dominated by the contributions from @xmath99 halos with @xmath123 ( @xmath124 ; see eq .",
    "[ [ f0bi ] ] ) .",
    "thus , a typical halo relevant for metal - enrichment of the igm has @xmath125 for @xmath520 and an exact treatment of halos of much higher masses , which requires a detailed description of their merger history , is not crucial to our model .",
    "[ in particular , @xmath111 is not sensitive to @xmath86 for @xmath126  erg as halos with @xmath127  erg are extremely rare for @xmath81 ] .",
    "the evolution of [ e / h]@xmath129 for @xmath112  gyr@xmath17 is shown as the dot - dashed curve in figure  1 .",
    "this gives [ e / h]@xmath130 at @xmath122 .",
    "thus , to provide 50% of the measured inventory of [ si / h]@xmath131 by @xmath122 ( point a ) requires @xmath132  gyr@xmath17 , which corresponds to @xmath133 vms event over @xmath134  gyr for a halo with @xmath135 and @xmath136  gyr@xmath17 ( eq .  [ [ rn ] ] ) . in figure",
    "2 we show the values of @xmath137 necessary to achieve [ si / h ]  @xmath138 ( solid curve ) or @xmath139 ( dashed curve ) by a given @xmath59 as calculated from equation  ( [ zigm ] ) .",
    "the dot - dashed curve indicates formation of @xmath140 vms by time @xmath141 in a halo of mass @xmath135 and is taken as a bound .",
    "it is evident that a major part ( @xmath142% ) of the si in the igm , which must come from vmss , can only be provided for @xmath59 substantially below 19 and with plausible production rates , for @xmath143 .",
    "we consider @xmath132  gyr@xmath17 a reasonable rate and show the corresponding evolution of [ si / h]@xmath31 for @xmath144 as the solid curve in figure  1 .",
    "the evolution of [ c / h]@xmath31 and [ o / h]@xmath31 is fixed by the yield ratios of the vms model ( see table  1 ) and shown as the dot - dashed and short - dashed curves , respectively .",
    "figure  1 shows that for a reasonable formation efficiency , vmss would provide [ c / h ]  @xmath145 and [ o / h ]  @xmath146 to the igm by @xmath122 .",
    "this is consistent with the proposal by bromm & loeb ( 2003 ) that vmss can no longer be formed when [ c / h ]  @xmath147 and [ o / h ]  @xmath148 are reached in the igm .",
    "they showed that for these metallicities , gas clouds initially cooled by h@xmath19 molecules could continue to cool by c and o atoms and fragment into smaller clumps .",
    "however , the termination of vms formation is a complex matter",
    ". the soft uv radiation from vmss would dissociate h@xmath19 molecules in low - mass halos , thus suppressing later vms formation .",
    "the history of h@xmath19 dissociation is not well known but a theoretical study by ciardi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) suggested that universal dissociation has not yet occurred for @xmath149 .",
    "the uvb produced by vmss may also play an important role in reionization , which could have taken place at @xmath75 ( kogut et al .",
    "2003 ) . as shown by oh et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , there should be sufficient hard uv photons emitted from vmss to reionize the universe if these stars were to provide [ si / h]@xmath150 ( see tumlinson et al .",
    "2004 ; daigne et al .",
    "2004 for a different view ) .",
    "the above estimates for the onset of c and o cooling , universal h@xmath19 dissociation , and reionization appear to roughly coincide .",
    "clearly , there must be a transition region in which ongoing vms formation increases the soft uvb for h@xmath19 dissociation and begins to suppress further vms formation , thus resulting in a global decrease in @xmath104 .",
    "there will also be an accompanying increase in the hard uvb that begins to initiate reionization and raise the igm temperature .",
    "the balance between these processes is not well understood and can not be addressed here .",
    "it is possible that both effects are operating to end the regime of h@xmath19 cooling at roughly similar @xmath59 to reionization . combining the consideration of the increasing uvb with the metallicity condition for termination of vms formation proposed by bromm & loeb ( 2003 )",
    ", we will assume that vms contributions to the igm will cease at @xmath5 and transition to formation of lower - mass stars will occur universally .",
    "for simplicity we assume that vms production stops sharply at @xmath122 and take vms contributions to the igm as shown in figure  1",
    ". then the bulk of the c and o and the remainder of the si must be provided by sne ii at @xmath151 .",
    "the formalism resulting in equation  ( [ dzdt ] ) can be modified to treat the chemical evolution of the igm in this regime , where formation of regular stars including sn ii progenitors requires @xmath152  k ( @xmath153 ) for cooling by atomic species .",
    "this corresponds to halos with @xmath154 and @xmath85 far exceeding the typical sn ii explosion energy of @xmath155  erg .",
    "thus only a fraction @xmath156 of the debris from an sn ii will be ejected into the igm .",
    "while the dependence of @xmath156 on the halo mass may be complicated , we will treat it as a constant for halos below some cut - off mass @xmath157 .",
    "our goal is to estimate how efficient sn ii - driven galactic outflows must be in order to provide a substantial part of the igm inventory at @xmath151 .",
    "equation  ( [ dzdt ] ) may be rewritten in this regime as @xmath158 where @xmath159 is the igm inventory of e at @xmath122 resulting from just vms production .",
    "note that @xmath160 scales with @xmath161 . for convenience",
    "we use @xmath162  gyr@xmath17 as a reference value .",

    "the value of @xmath165 is consistent with observations of outflows from lyman break and dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , pettini et al . 2001 ; martin et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the results will not change much if @xmath157 is varied from this value by a factor of several either way ( qw05 ) . as can be seen from figure  1",
    ", galactic outflows can only provide [ e / h]@xmath166 by @xmath167 for @xmath162  gyr@xmath17 . to provide [ si / h ]  @xmath138 ( 50% of the igm inventory ) by @xmath167",
    "would require @xmath168  gyr@xmath17 .",
    "this corresponds to a rather high outflow efficiency of @xmath169 for intermediate - mass ( @xmath170@xmath171 ) halos with a galactic production rate .",
    "if galactic outflows are to provide [ si / h ]  @xmath138 by @xmath172 , then @xmath173  gyr@xmath17 is required and @xmath174 is sufficient for a galactic production rate .",
    "figure  1 shows an example of a self - consistent model for the chemical evolution of the igm with contributions from vmss for @xmath144 and galactic outflows for @xmath175 .",
    "the overall evolution of [ si / h]@xmath31 , [ o / h]@xmath31 , and [ c / h]@xmath31 is shown assuming that vmss provided 50% of the si inventory by @xmath122 ( point a ) and galactic outflows the other half by @xmath167 ( point b ) and using the yield ratios of the sources ( see table  1 ) . it can be seen that galactic outflows can not provide significant contributions until @xmath176 .",
    "thus , the model implies that there should be very little change in the net igm inventory between @xmath122 and @xmath176 .",
    "the respective contributions to c , o , si , and fe from vmss and galactic outflows associated with sne ii are given in table 1 .",
    "in considering metal enrichment of the igm at high @xmath59 we have focused on vmss with @xmath2@xmath3 in low - mass halos using the yields of hw02 .",
    "these workers showed that this narrow range of stellar masses produce pi - sne , which would efficiently eject the associated nucleosynthetic products into the igm .",
    "they also showed that all vmss with @xmath26 would form black holes and therefore not contribute any metals .",
    "thus , the first stellar sources contributing metals are restricted to pi - sne . however ,",
    "if one considers any plausible imf , the occurrence of pi - sne implies the production of more massive stars that will thus give massive black holes ( mbhs ) .",
    "it follows that the igm inventory of metals that is attributable to pi - sne must be coupled with the production of mbhs .",
    "this then relates the metal ( particularly si ) content of the igm to the inventory of mbhs at early epochs .    before discussing the coupling between the amount of metals in the igm and the total mass of mbhs produced in epochs prior to galaxy formation",
    ", we note the work by madau & rees ( 2001 ) , who estimated the inventory of mbhs based on considerations other than metal enrichment .",
    "motivated by simulations of bromm , coppi , & larson ( 1999 ) and abel , bryan , & norman ( 2000 ) , which suggested that the first stars may have been very massive , madau & rees ( 2001 ) recognized the significance of possible early production of mbhs in an episode of pregalactic star formation using earlier stellar models ( bond , arnett , & carr 1984 ; fryer , woosley & heger 2001 ) , which showed that vmss could produce mbhs .",
    "in particular , they found that if one mbh of mass @xmath177 formed in each @xmath178 halo ( with @xmath179 in dark and baryonic matter ) collapsing at @xmath180 , then a fraction @xmath181 of all baryonic matter would be in mbhs , where @xmath182 is the hubble parameter in units of 100  km  s@xmath17  mpc@xmath17 and we take @xmath183 throughout this paper .",
    "this estimate is comparable to the total mass fraction of the central supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) found in most nearby galaxies ( see eq .  [ [ fsmbh ] ] below ) .    in the earlier sections of the present paper",
    ", we have inferred that vmss with @xmath2@xmath3 provided [ si / h]@xmath184 ( @xmath12% of the si in the igm ) and we have derived the rate of vms formation required to achieve this .",
    "we now explore the implications of this metal production for the inventory of mbhs that would be produced in low - mass halos at the same epoch and show that it is in accord with the possibility considered by madau & rees ( 2001 ) . for a quantitative estimate",
    ", we consider a large reference region of the igm with a total mass @xmath185 and use a salpeter imf for vmss . to enrich this igm with [ si / h]@xmath186 , the required number @xmath187 of vmss with @xmath2@xmath3 is @xmath188 as the total baryonic mass of a hosting halo is @xmath189 , we take the upper mass limit for vmss to be @xmath8 . we have checked that our results are not sensitive to this assumed upper mass limit .",
    "the number @xmath190 of mbhs resulting from vmss with @xmath191@xmath8 is @xmath192 where @xmath193 is the vms mass in units of @xmath194 .",
    "the average mass of these mbhs is @xmath195 where @xmath1961 is the average mass fraction of a vms progenitor in the relevant mass range that ends up in the mbh ( fryer et al .",
    "the fractional contribution of mbhs to the baryonic mass of the universe can be estimated as @xmath197    the above estimate ) for vmss . for a steeper imf of the form @xmath198 , the numerical coefficient in eq .",
    "( [ fmbh ] ) for @xmath199 is reduced by a factor of @xmath200 .",
    "] of @xmath199 may be compared with the fraction @xmath201 of all baryonic matter contributed by smbhs in the present universe , @xmath202 where @xmath203  mpc@xmath204 is the present mass density of smbhs obtained from galactic observations ( see the recent analyses by marconi et al .",
    "2004 ) , @xmath205  mpc@xmath204 is the present critical density , and @xmath206 is the fractional contribution of baryons to @xmath207 .",
    "it can be seen that the mass fraction of mbhs calculated from the si abundance in the igm of the early universe ( eq .  [ [ fmbh ] ] ) and that of smbhs determined for the present epoch by observations ( eq .",
    "[ [ fsmbh ] ] ) are in remarkably good accord .",
    "the possibility considered by madau & rees ( 2001 ) is now shown to be supported by the required vms contribution to produce the si in the igm .",
    "we note that schneider et al .",
    "( 2002 ) derived a wide range of formation efficiency for vmss with @xmath2@xmath3 using @xmath208 and other constraints .",
    "their results can be easily accommodated by the rate of vms formation derived here .",
    "we also note that accreting mbhs may contribute to the soft x - ray background ( sxrb ) .",
    "based on the unaccounted sxrb flux , salvaterra , haardt , & ferrara ( 2005 ) estimated that @xmath199 can not exceed @xmath209 .",
    "this is consistent with our result . during the epoch of vms formation at @xmath15 ,",
    "the rate of occurrence of an mbh - producing vms event is @xmath210  gyr@xmath17 for a halo of @xmath4 ( eq .  [ 7 ] with @xmath132  gyr@xmath17 and eq .",
    "[ [ nmbh ] ] ) . this rate can be used to calculate the contribution from mbhs to the sxrb .",
    "the remarkable accord between the mbh inventory calculated from the si content of the early igm ( eq .  [ [ fmbh ] ] ) and the present global mass budget of smbhs obtained from galactic observations ( eq .  [ fsmbh ] ] ) can not be easily dismissed as an accident .",
    "it is expected that the early - formed mbhs would cluster near galactic centers ( madau & rees 2001 ) . as a fraction @xmath13@xmath14 of all baryonic matter",
    "is in mbhs ( eq .  [ [ fmbh ] ] with @xmath1961 ) , a typical galaxy with a baryonic mass of @xmath211 would have a total mass of @xmath13@xmath212 in mbhs .",
    "this is close to the mass of @xmath213 for the smbh at the galactic center ( e.g. , ghez 2004 ) .",
    "it is possible that the central smbhs in typical galaxies of the present universe are formed by simply merging the mbh seeds without much gas accretion .",
    "this would explain why the total mass of smbhs observed at the present epoch corresponds approximately ( within a factor of @xmath214 ) to that of the mbh seeds .",
    "however , there appears to be an obvious conflict .",
    "it is widely accepted that quasars are powered by gas accretion onto smbhs . the total gas mass accreted by all optical quasars is inferred to be also comparable to that of the smbhs observed at the present epoch ( e.g. , yu & tremaine 2002 ; marconi et al .",
    "this is supported by the simulations of hopkins et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , who proposed a unified model for producing smbhs , quasars , and galaxy spheroids . in their model ,",
    "smbhs were formed predominantly by gas accretion .",
    "both the global mass budget and the relative distribution of smbhs over the mass range @xmath215@xmath171 given by their model are in agreement with those derived by marconi et al .",
    "( 2004 ) from galactic observations .",
    "it appears that the model of hopkins et al .",
    "( 2005 ) is rather satisfactory .",
    "however , within the uncertainties of their model , it is still plausible to consider that the more common smbhs of @xmath216 might represent aggregates of the mbh seeds without much gas accretion but large amounts of gas accretion must occur to explain the rarer smbhs of @xmath217 .",
    "thus , in accounting for the approximate agreement between the global smbh mass budget determined from galactic and quasar observations and the mbh inventory , there appears to be a `` rule '' that only the rarer higher - mass smbhs can efficiently accrete gas but the more common lower - mass ones can not .",
    "this matter clearly requires attention . in the model of hopkins",
    "( 2005 ) , mergers of halos enhance the infall of gas toward the smbhs .",
    "however , as mergers must have also occurred to form galaxies hosting smbhs of @xmath216 , which constitute @xmath218% of the global smbh mass budget ( marconi et al .",
    "2004 ) , there seem to be some other processes that inhibit gas accretion onto such lower - mass smbhs .",
    "the complex problem of forming smbhs from mbh seeds was studied by volonteri , haardt , & madau ( 2003 ) .",
    "however , the total mass of mbhs in their scenarios is only a small fraction ( typically @xmath219 ) of that of the smbhs at the present epoch as cited above .",
    "we urge that the problem of forming smbhs from mbh seeds be revisited with the initial conditions presented here . for a formation rate of @xmath18",
    "gyr@xmath17 in each halo of @xmath4 , an mbh with an average mass @xmath9@xmath10 ( eq .  [ [ mmbh ] ] with @xmath1961 ) should have been produced in @xmath220% of such halos by @xmath122 .",
    "if the amount of gas accretion onto black holes in galactic centers is typically comparable to or smaller than the total mass of the original inherited mbhs , then there would not be a serious difficulty in reconciling the global smbh mass budget determined from galactic observations with that from quasar observations and with the inventory of mbhs calculated from the vms contribution to the si in the igm .",
    "the evolution of an initial distribution of mbh seeds was studied extensively by islam , taylor , & silk ( 2003 , 2004 ) using a semi - analytical model to follow the hierarchical merging of halos .",
    "these authors focused on the dynamics of the mbh inventory and presented a clear analysis of what might be expected from assemblage of mbhs without gas accretion . amongst their conclusions",
    "are : ( 1 ) hierarchical merging of mbh seeds that formed in @xmath221 halos collapsing at @xmath222 can contribute @xmath223% of the present global mass budget of smbhs",
    ". a central smbh of @xmath224 in a galaxy like ours could be the result of seed accumulation without gas accretion .",
    "however , gas accretion is necessary for higher - mass smbhs .",
    "( 2 ) for a present - day galaxy of @xmath225@xmath226 ( mostly in dark matter ) , the total mass of the inherited mbhs in the galactic halo is comparable to or greater than the mass contributed by mbhs to the central smbh .",
    "it would be of interest to see what a new calculation of the type presented by hopkins et al .",
    "( 2005 ) would give if the mass and production history of mbhs as provided here were used .",
    "if the majority of mbhs are stored in galactic halos but not bulges , then we might expect gas accretion to account for the growth of central smbhs while the mbhs in the low - density halos might not accrete . in this case",
    ", it is accidental that the total mass of mbhs calculated from the vms contribution to the si in the igm is close to the present global mass budget of smbhs .",
    "a two - stage model for the chemical evolution of the igm is proposed considering vmss in low - mass ( @xmath4 ) halos during early epochs ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "this early stage ends when universal h@xmath19 dissociation and reionization occur and is followed by an extended quiescent period of little metal production until sufficient sne ii could occur in intermediate - mass ( @xmath170@xmath171 ) halos to drive significant outflows .",
    "galactic outflows contribute mainly at @xmath66 .",
    "the requirement of early vms contributions follows from the high value of [ si / c ]  @xmath1 inferred for the igm ( aguirre et al . 2004 ; see discussion therein regarding possible uncertainties ) and model yields of vmss and sne ii ( e.g. , hw02 ; ww95 ) .",
    "the bulk ( @xmath142% ) of the si must come from vmss , while the c and o are predominantly from the later galactic outflows .",
    "the required vms formation efficiency corresponds to @xmath227 vms per low - mass halo .",
    "the requirement on galactic outflows implies efficient ( @xmath228% ) loss of sn ii debris from intermediate - mass halos with a galactic sn ii rate .",
    "contributions from galactic outflows would be diminished as the halo masses and the amount of baryonic matter stored in low - mass stars increase .",
    "this may explain the lack of evolution of the igm inventory for @xmath324.1 .",
    "the vms contributions are consistent with the level of metallicities at which vms formation would be suppressed ( bromm & loeb 2003 ) .",
    "they also correspond to a sufficient number of uv photons from vmss to reionize the universe ( oh et al .",
    "however , how the increasing photon production by vmss leads to h@xmath19 dissociation and reionization , which then terminates vms formation , is a complex issue and not addressable here .",
    "there is a hint that all these events occur at similar @xmath59 .",
    "it would be a useful test if h@xmath19 dissociation and reionization could be modeled with the vms formation rates proposed here .",
    "in producing [ si / h ]  @xmath138 , vmss also provide [ fe / h ]  @xmath146 to the igm ( see table 1 ) . this fe abundance",
    "was considered by us ( e.g. , wasserburg & qian 2000 ; qian & wasserburg 2002 ) as the onset of regular star formation based on observations of low - metallicity galactic halo stars .",
    "there is a basic issue regarding the metallicity at which regular stars may be formed . as c and o atoms provide the important cooling , bromm & loeb ( 2003 ) proposed conditions for regular star formation in terms of threshold c and o abundances .",
    "these abundances coincide with the vms contributions in our model . in this sense",
    "the threshold fe abundance proposed by us is equivalent to the threshold c and o abundances .",
    "the low - mass star he  01075240 can not be explained by our scenario .",
    "this special star has [ c / h ] well above and [ o / h ] at or below the threshold but [ fe / h ]  @xmath229 ( christlieb et al . 2004 ; bessell , christlieb , & gustafsson 2004 ) . whether some low - mass stars such as this may form along with vmss remains an open issue .",
    "a number of galactic halo stars are observed to have @xmath230}<-3 $ ] .",
    "if they formed at @xmath231 , this would pose a problem as our model gives a high value of [ fe / h]@xmath29 ( see table 1 ) .",
    "however , the fe abundances of these stars may be explained if they formed at @xmath232 .",
    "the igm then would have a net inventory of [ fe / h ]  @xmath233 but the fe abundances in different regions would follow a lognormal distribution with a scatter of @xmath234  dex ( schaye et al .",
    "2003 ; simcoe et al .",
    "this leads us to suggest that some parts of the galaxy formed from under - enriched regions of the igm .    in conjunction with the required metal production by vmss in the narrow mass range @xmath2@xmath3 , there would also be mbhs produced by more massive stars ( hw02 ) .",
    "both of these processes should occur in low - mass halos for @xmath15 .",
    "this leads to a relationship between the metal ( particularly si ) content of the early igm and the inventory of mbhs ( @xmath9@xmath10 ) at the same epoch .",
    "the total mass of mbhs calculated from the vms contribution to the si in the early igm using a salpeter imf is in remarkable agreement with that of smbhs observed at the present epoch .",
    "these early - formed mbhs could cluster near galactic centers during the later epochs of galaxy formation when galactic outflows contributed to the igm .",
    "such a cluster of mbhs would , if coalesced , form an smbh of @xmath13@xmath212 in a typical galaxy with a baryonic mass of @xmath211 .",
    "there is a hint of quasi - conservation of black hole masses , which implies that only the rarer smbhs of @xmath217 can efficiently accrete gas but the more common ones of @xmath216 can not .",
    "it remains to be investigated whether a mechanism exists to inhibit gas accretion onto lower - mass smbhs .",
