    "ever since the establishment of statistical mechanics , a unified theory of nonequilibrium steady state ( ness ) is the goal of theoretical physicists . according to second law of thermodynamics , a macroscopic isolated system will eventually relax to thermal equilibrium .",
    "but if the system is infinitely large , it may take infinitely long time to remove the imbalances in the initial state .",
    "the system then can never reach thermal equilibrium . instead",
    ", it will relax to a nonequilibrium steady state , in which exist currents that continuously produce entropy , but the local observables are stationary everywhere .",
    "for example , a system composing of two infinite reservoirs at different temperatures will relax to ness , in which the heat persistently flows from the hotter reservoir to the colder one .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the theory of ness in quantum systems .",
    "ness in classical systems is also an active area of research  @xcite . nevertheless , the microscopic mechanical law is quantum .",
    "various approaches have been developed for studying ness  @xcite .",
    "kubo formula  @xcite is valid if the deviation from thermal equilibrium is infinitesimal .",
    "the nonequilibrium green s functions technique  @xcite was employed in the irreversible processes starting from an equilibrium state .",
    "landauer - bttiker formula  @xcite was specifically designed for a scattering region coupled to multiple thermal reservoirs .",
    "hershfield  @xcite derived an expression for the density matrix of ness .",
    "these approaches all depend on an explicitly defined initial state .",
    "but statistical mechanics reminds us that the initial memory is lost in the thermalization process .",
    "and a thermalized state depends only upon very few parameters like the total energy and particle number .",
    "the idea of lost memory is at the heart of maximized entropy principle , which lays a foundation of the unified description of equilibrium states .",
    "similarly , one expects that some redundant information in the initial state should be lost in the evolution to ness .",
    "and a unified description of ness emerges once if the surviving information can be distinguished from the lost information .",
    "the lost information in the thermalization process has been well addressed , thanks to the development of quantum chaos theory . according to this theory ,",
    "generic ( i.e. chaotic ) systems with complicated interactions between particles must be distinguished from integrable systems .",
    "the former can thermalize , but the latter can not  @xcite . the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis ( eth )",
    "was proposed  @xcite . it explains why an isolated system loses its memory in spite of the fact that the wave function follows a unitary evolution .",
    "eth states that the matrix elements of physical observables in the eigenbasis of hamiltonian can be expressed as  @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote the average of and the difference between two eigenenergies , respectively .",
    "the diagonal element @xmath12 is a smooth function of energy . while the off - diagonal elements are exponentially small with @xmath13 denoting the thermodynamic entropy .",
    "@xmath14 is related to the density of many - body states by @xmath15 .",
    "the off - diagonal elements are the product of a smooth function @xmath16 and a random number @xmath17 with zero mean and unit variance .",
    "starting from a typical initial state , the long time limit of observables depends only upon the main diagonal of the initial density matrix  @xcite which is sometimes called the diagonal ensemble .",
    "the diagonal ensemble is not necessarily an equilibrium ensemble . but according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : eth ] ) , one can not distinguish the values of observables with respect to different eigenstates whose energies are the same . therefore , the diagonal ensemble and the equilibrium ensemble predict same results for the observables .",
    "in this sense a chaotic quantum system thermalizes .",
    "the loss of memory is caused by the averaging out of the off - diagonal elements .",
    "if a chaotic system evolves into ness , one expects that the initial memory should be lost in a similar way .",
    "but eth can not explain the existence of ness by itself .",
    "to address the nature of ness , we propose the nonequilibrium steady state hypothesis ( nessh ) .",
    "this hypothesis provides a unified description of ness , and makes it clear which information in the initial state is lost in the evolution to ness .",
    "and the thermodynamic limit @xmath18 are noncommutative . ]",
    "let us first discuss the definition of ness in isolated systems .",
    "some authors are used to talking about ness in open systems .",
    "nevertheless , an open system can always be treated as part of a larger isolated system .",
    "we notice next facts :    \\(1 ) the exclusive characteristic of ness is the existence of `` nonequilibrium '' currents .",
    "these currents are distinguished from the circular currents that may exist in some equilibrium states , e.g. , the persistent current in a mesoscopic ring  @xcite .",
    "nonequilibrium currents result from the tendency to remove the particle ( energy ) distribution imbalance .",
    "the system returns to thermal equilibrium by removing these imbalances .",
    "therefore , nonequilibrium currents produce entropy . for example",
    ", the heat flow from the hotter part of a system to the colder part is a nonequilibrium current .",
    "integrable systems after a quench will relax to non - thermal states  @xcite in which there is no current or entropy production .",
    "we distinguish these non - thermal states from ness .",
    "the system is in ness if and only if there exist stationary nonequilibrium currents , which is denoted by @xmath19 .",
    "( 2 ) in a * finite * isolated system , eigenstates do not carry nonequilibrium currents . because if there exist nonequilibrium currents , the particle ( energy ) distribution must change with time due to the conservation law .",
    "this contradicts the fact that physical observables keep invariant in an eigenstate .",
    "especially , let us consider a bipartite system with the number of particles in the left and right part being @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "the nonequilibrium current from @xmath22 to @xmath23 is @xmath24 $ ] .",
    "it is straightforward to prove @xmath25 for an eigenstate @xmath1 .",
    "note that eigenstates in finite systems can carry circular currents , since they do not change the particle ( energy ) distribution .",
    "\\(3 ) in a finite system , if an observable relaxes to its stationary value in the long time limit , it must be determined by the diagonal ensemble  @xcite : @xmath26 ,   \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the diagonal ensemble .",
    "@xmath0 is the initial density matrix .",
    "nonequilibrium currents must be zero in the diagonal ensemble due to fact  ( 2 ) . therefore",
    ", diagonal ensemble is distinguished from ness .",
    "due to facts  ( 1 - 3 ) , ness should be a quasistationary state . in a finite system",
    ", this state survives for a while , but finally relaxes to the diagonal ensemble .",
    "but if the system s size goes to infinity , i.e. the thermodynamic limit , the lifetime of this quasistationary state goes to infinity .",
    "it then becomes a real steady state .",
    "ness exists if and only if the thermodynamic limit @xmath18 and the long time limit @xmath28 are noncommutative : @xmath29 according to fact  ( 3 ) , the left hand side equals zero .",
    "therefore , the right hand side is nonzero , that is a stationary nonequilibrium current survives .",
    "we define ness as follows : * if the thermodynamic limit and the long time limit are noncommutative for a specific initial state of an isolated system , taking @xmath18 before taking @xmath30 results in a ness .",
    "* it is worth emphasizing that in ness the two limits are noncommutative for arbitrary observables , but not only for the current .",
    "an example is helpful for understanding the noncommutativity of the two limits .",
    "let us consider two reservoirs at different water levels which are connected by a pipe ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] ) .",
    "water flows from left to right to remove the level imbalance .",
    "the flow stops after the left and right levels reach the same .",
    "but if the reservoirs are infinitely large , the flow never stops , since the level imbalance can not be removed within finite period .",
    "let us start from the schrdinger equation and see why eq .",
    "( [ eq : noncommutative ] ) is possible .",
    "the time - dependent current is expressed as @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the initial density matrix and the current matrix , respectively . @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the eigenstates of the hamiltonian . @xmath3 and @xmath4 are their eigenenergies , respectively .",
    "notice that terms with @xmath36 are excluded from the sum , because the diagonal elements of @xmath37 are zero .",

    ", the pairs of eigenstates with energy difference @xmath43 do not contribute to @xmath44 .",
    "we say that the phase coherence between these pairs is lost .",
    "if the system s size is finite , the level spacing has a minimum , therefore , there always exists sufficiently large @xmath42 when all the eigenstate pairs satisfy @xmath43 .",
    "the phase coherence is totally lost , and the stationary current must be zero .",
    "but if the system s size is infinite , the level spacing goes to zero . for arbitrarily large @xmath42",
    ", there exist eigenstate pairs that satisfy @xmath45 . the phase coherence between these pairs survives .",
    "the superposition of these neighbor eigenstates may carry a finite nonequilibrium current as @xmath46 . in above we",
    "do not consider the degeneracy , which is broken in a chaotic system .",
    "ness is essentially a partially - coherent state , which exists in thermodynamic limit . in a finite system with the averaged level spacing @xmath47",
    ", the phase coherence between all the eigenstate pairs is lost at the time scale @xmath48 . while the current usually relaxes to its stationary value at a much shorter time which is denoted as @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath50 is determined by the interaction strength or the bandwidth of the system . during the time @xmath51 ,",
    "the current is quasistationary .",
    "this quasistationary current gradually approaches the stationary current in ness as the system s size increases .",
    "one can study the properties of ness by doing a proper scaling in finite systems  @xcite .    in integrable systems the characteristics of the matrix @xmath52 or @xmath53 vary from model to model  @xcite .",
    "ness in integrable systems shares no common feature .",
    "but it is not the case in chaotic systems . according to eth  ( [ eq : eth ] )",
    ", the current matrix has indeed a general expression in arbitrary chaotic systems , which is @xmath54 note that @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "we then guess that the off - diagonal elements of the density matrix have a similar expression : @xmath55 ansatz  ( [ eq : ansatz1 ] ) is distinguished from eth . because the density matrix is not a few - body operator , and then must be distinguished from physical observables .",
    "the diagonal element @xmath56 is not necessarily a smooth function of @xmath3 .",
    "notice that ansatz  ( [ eq : ansatz1 ] ) stands for a generic state , but not for a fine - tuned one such as eigenstates .",
    "we note that , to the best of our knowledge , ansatz  ( [ eq : ansatz1 ] ) has not been clearly written down before , but the idea behind it is not new . in random matrix theory ( rmt ) , it was proved that the eigenstates of random matrices in any basis are random unit vectors  @xcite . due to the similarity between random matrices and quantum chaotic systems , a generic state in the eigenbasis of a chaotic system",
    "should also be a random vector . correspondingly , the off - diagonal elements of a generic density matrix are random numbers",
    ". ansatz  ( [ eq : ansatz1 ] ) goes further by proposing an envelop function @xmath57 .",
    "the randomness of @xmath52 and @xmath58 can be understood as follows .",
    "choose two real numbers @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "if the system s size is large enough , there should be many eigenstate pairs @xmath61 whose averaged energy @xmath62 and energy difference @xmath63 fall within the thin shells centered at @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "the value of @xmath64 or @xmath58 fluctuates within these pairs like a random number with some proposed distribution .",
    "notice that in thermodynamic limit , the number of pairs within a finite shell goes to infinity .",
    "and we should set the shell width to infinitesimal for obtaining the distribution of @xmath52 or @xmath58 . because the distribution may change with @xmath59 or @xmath60 .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that @xmath65 and @xmath66 are two random numbers with zero mean and unit variance .",
    "it is reasonable to suppose that their correlation is independent of @xmath59 or @xmath60 : @xmath67 or at least @xmath68 changes very slowly with @xmath59 or @xmath60 .",
    "since the entropy @xmath69 is real , the hermitianity of @xmath70 and @xmath37 requires @xmath71 let us consider a popular situation - a real hamiltonian together with a purely imaginary current operator .",
    "this corresponds to a system with time - reversal symmetry .",
    "for example , let us consider a fermionic lattice model with the hamiltonian @xmath72 where @xmath73 .",
    "the current operator from site @xmath74 to @xmath75 is @xmath76 .",
    "since @xmath52 is real but @xmath58 is purely imaginary , we suppose @xmath77 and @xmath78 to be real symmetric matrices .",
    "and we suppose @xmath79 to be real but @xmath80 to be purely imaginary functions .",
    "now let us discuss the condition of @xmath81 under which the nonequilibrium current survives in the steady limit .",
    "substituting eq .",
    "( [ eq : currenteth]-[eq : corr ] ) and ansatz  ( [ eq : ansatz1 ] ) into eq .  ( [ eq : current ] ) , we obtain @xmath82 where @xmath83 denotes the density of many - body states . to get eq .  ( [ eq : currexp ] ) we used @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "the latter approximation is due to the fast decay of @xmath86 as @xmath87 increases .",
    "therefore , most contribution to @xmath88 comes from a shallow window of @xmath60 in which @xmath89 almost keeps a constant .",
    "it was already observed that the off - diagonal elements of observables decay quickly as @xmath87 increases  @xcite .",
    "( [ eq : currexp ] ) is surprisingly simple .",
    "the detail of the model and the initial state is hidden behind the random matrices @xmath77 and @xmath78 . their contribution to @xmath90",
    "is simplified into a constant @xmath68 .",
    "@xmath91 is equivalent to @xmath92 , that is the fourier transformation of @xmath93 has a nonzero limit as @xmath94 .",
    "according to riemann - lebesgue lemma  @xcite , @xmath93 can not be an integrable function .",
    "instead , @xmath95 must be the product of @xmath96 and an integrable function",
    ". then , the nonequilibrium current obeys @xmath91 but @xmath97 ( the proof is present in follows ) .",
    "the existence and stationarity of nonequilibrium current require a factor @xmath96 in either @xmath81 or @xmath98 .",
    "@xmath96 can not be a factor of @xmath99 .",
    "otherwise , @xmath100 for arbitrary @xmath81 , which contradicts the fact that most initial states thermalize .",
    "therefore , @xmath96 must be a factor of @xmath81 .    according to the above argument",
    ", we propose our second ansatz .",
    "initial states can be classified into typical and atypical states .",
    "typical initial states thermalize in the long time limit in which @xmath101 .",
    "the envelop function @xmath81 of typical density matrices is an integrable function of @xmath60 . on the other hand ,",
    "atypical initial states evolve into ness in which @xmath102 .",
    "the corresponding envelop function scales as @xmath96 in the limit @xmath103 .",
    "one can express the atypical envelop function as @xmath104 where @xmath105 is an integrable function and converges in the limit @xmath103 .",
    "the denominator is @xmath87 because the hermitianity requires @xmath106 to be even .",
    "ansatz  ( [ eq : ansatz1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : ansatz2 ] ) combine into our nonequilibrium steady state hypothesis : * the off - diagonal elements of an initial density matrix that evolves into ness can be expressed as * @xmath107 nessh means that the off - diagonal elements of atypical density matrices are random numbers .",
    "and their variance scales as @xmath108 in the diagonal limit .    according to ansatz  ( [ eq : ansatz2 ] ) , if @xmath109 is real but @xmath110 is purely imaginary , the expression of stationary current can be further simplified into @xmath111 where @xmath112 .",

    "this meets our definition of ness .",
    "@xmath118 can be divided into @xmath117 and @xmath119 .",
    "the latter comes from the off - diagonal elements of initial density matrices .",

    ", we have @xmath120 with @xmath121 .",
    "let us study the expression of @xmath122 , in which the integral with respect to @xmath60 is the fourier transformation of @xmath123 .",
    "but @xmath70 and @xmath124 are both integrable functions . according to riemann - lebesgue lemma , in the limit @xmath94",
    ", @xmath122 vanishes and then @xmath125 must approach a stationary value .",
    "and this stationary value is nonzero since the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ eq : one ] ) is not integrable with @xmath87 appearing in the denominator .",
    "the limit of @xmath119 is just the commutator between the thermodynamic limit and the long time limit : @xmath126 notice that , if @xmath123 has a real part , we can not get a simple expression for @xmath127 like eq .",
    "( [ eq : currsimexp ] ) . because the integral @xmath128 is divergent .",
    "but this does not indicate that @xmath119 is also divergent .",
    "one should not forget that we actually deal with a finite system ( otherwise , the density of states @xmath129 is infinite and eq .",
    "( [ eq : one ] ) makes no sense ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath60 has indeed an infrared cutoff - the level spacing between neighbor eigenstates @xmath47 . and",
    "one must keep @xmath130 for obtaining the correct nonequilibrium steady limit .",
    "we leave the problem of calculating @xmath127 in future research .",
    "nessh clarifies how the initial memory is lost in the evolution to ness .",
    "the density matrix always follows a unitary evolution : @xmath131 in the thermalization process , all the information contained in the second term is lost .",
    "ness keeps more information than thermalized states .",
    "the stationary current depends on the value of @xmath132 .",
    "but all the off - diagonal elements with @xmath133 average out in the evolution to ness .",
    "ness only keeps memory of the off - diagonal elements with infinitesimal energy difference .",
    "furthermore , @xmath56 is insensitive to the change of @xmath34 once if @xmath3 is fixed ( eth ) .",
    "this explains why thermalization happens .",
    "similarly , the detail of the initial state is contained in the matrix @xmath66 . but @xmath66 contributes to the value of an observable through its correlation with @xmath134 .",
    "physical observables are then insensitive to the detail of @xmath66 .",
    "this is the reason why ness looks `` universal '' .",
    "we test nessh ( ansatz  ( [ eq : ansatz1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : ansatz2 ] ) ) in a few chaotic models .",
    "let us first consider a bipartite structure as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] .",
    "the system composes of two weakly - coupled reservoirs ( the meaning of `` weakly - coupled '' will be discussed below ) .",
    "the hamiltonian of each reservoir is a random matrix or to be specific , a gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe )  @xcite . in detail , goe is a real symmetric matrix . its diagonal ( off - diagonal )",
    "entries are independent random numbers , and each follows the gaussian distribution with zero mean and variance @xmath135 ( @xmath136 ) .",
    "we have two reasons for choosing random matrices .",
    "first , random matrices are believed to have the same properties as quantum chaotic systems .",
    "second , nessh should in principle be tested in thermodynamic limit . while random matrices of small dimensions already display thermodynamic properties . to see these properties in `` real '' models , the dimensions of the hamiltonian have to be very large , therefore , numerical calculation is more difficult .",
    "anyway , we also test nessh in a `` real '' model .",
    "the results will be discussed in next section .",

    ", the rescaled coupling between left and right levels must have an extra factor @xmath149 . or @xmath137 times the coupling strength is a constant .",
    "this condition guarantees that the coupling energy does not increase with the system s size . the energy flow between reservoirs",
