    "biased random walks in inhomogeneous environments are a natural setting to witness trapping phenomena . in the case of supercritical galton - watson trees with leaves ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) or the supercritical percolation cluster on @xmath0 ( see @xcite ) , for example , it has been observed that dead - ends found in the environment can , for suitably strong biases , create a sub - ballistic regime that is characteristic of trapping .",
    "more specifically , for both of these models , the distribution of the time spent in individual traps has polynomial tail decay , and this places them in the same universality class as the one - dimensional heavy - tailed trapping models considered in @xcite . indeed , although the case of a deterministically biased random walk on a galton - watson tree with leaves is slightly complicated by a certain lattice effect , which means it can not be rescaled properly @xcite , in the case of randomly biased random walks on such structures , it was shown in @xcite that precisely the same limiting behaviour as the one - dimensional models of @xcite and @xcite occurs .",
    "moreover , there is evidence presented in @xcite that suggests the biased random walk on a supercritical percolation cluster also has the same limiting behaviour .",
    "the universality class that connects these models was previously investigated in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , and is characterised by limiting stable subordinators and aging properties .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate biased random walks on critical structures . to this end",
    ", we choose to study the biased random walk on a critical galton - watson tree conditioned to survive . with the underlying environment having radically different properties from its supercritical counterpart",
    ", we would expect different limiting behaviour , with more extreme trapping phenomena , to arise .",
    "it is further natural to believe that some of the properties of the biased random walk on the incipient infinite cluster for critical percolation on @xmath0 , at least in high dimensions , would be similar to the ones proved in our context , as is observed to be the case for the unbiased random walk ( compare , for instance , the results of @xcite and @xcite ) . nevertheless , our current understanding of the geometry of this object is not sufficient to extend our results easily , and so we do not pursue this inquiry here .",
    "in particular , we anticipate that , as indicated by physicists in @xcite , for percolation close to criticality there is likely to be an additional trapping mechanism that occurs due to spatial considerations , which means that , even without taking the effect of dead - ends into account , it is more likely for the biased random walk to be found in certain regions of individual paths than others ( see @xcite for a preliminary study in this direction ) .",
    "our main model  the biased random walk on critical galton - watson trees conditioned to survive  is presented in the next section , along with a summary of the results we are able to prove for it .",
    "this is followed in section [ onedsec ] with an introduction to a one - dimensional trapping model in which the trapping time distributions have slowly - varying tails .",
    "this latter model , which is of interest in its own right , is of particular relevance for us , as it allows us to comprehensively characterise the universality class into which the galton - watson trees we consider fall .",
    "furthermore , the arguments we apply for the one - dimensional model provide a useful template for the more complicated tree framework .      before presenting the galton - watson tree framework , we recall some classical results for sums of random variables whose distribution has a slowly - varying tail .",
    "let @xmath1 be independent random variables , with distributional tail @xmath2 satisfying : @xmath3 , @xmath4 for all @xmath5 , @xmath6 for any @xmath7 , and @xmath8 as @xmath9 .",
    "a typical example is when the distribution in question decays logarithmically slowly , such as @xmath10 for some @xmath11 , where throughout the article @xmath12 will mean @xmath13 as @xmath14 .",
    "a first scaling result for sums of the form @xmath15 was obtained in @xcite , and this was subsequently extended by @xcite to a functional result . in particular , in @xcite",
    "it was established that if @xmath16 , then @xmath17 in distribution with respect to the skorohod @xmath18 topology ( as an aid to the reader , we provide in the appendix a definition of the skorohod @xmath18 and @xmath19 topologies , the latter of which is applied in several subsequent results ) , where @xmath20 is an extremal process . to define @xmath21 more",
    "precisely , suppose that @xmath22 is the symmetric cauchy process , i.e. , the lvy process with lvy measure given by @xmath23 for @xmath24 , and then set @xmath25 where @xmath26 .",
    "( observe that @xmath27 is thus the maximum process of the poisson point process with intensity measure @xmath28 . )",
    "we will prove that , in addition to appearing in the limit at ( [ mlim ] ) , this extremal process arises in the scaling limits of a biased random walk on a critical galton - watson tree and , as is described in the next section , a one - dimensional directed trap model whose holding times have a slowly - varying mean .",
    "we continue by introducing some relevant branching process and random walk notation , following the presentation of @xcite .",
    "let @xmath29 be a critical ( @xmath30 ) offspring distribution in the domain of attraction of a stable law with index @xmath31 $ ] , by which we mean that there exists a sequence @xmath32 such that @xmath33-n}{a_n}\\buildrel{d}\\over{\\rightarrow } x,\\ ] ] where @xmath34 $ ] is the sum of @xmath35 i.i.d .",
    "copies of @xmath29 and @xmath36 for @xmath37 . note that , by results of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapters xiii and xvii ) , this is equivalent to the probability generating function of @xmath29 satisfying @xmath38 where @xmath39 is slowly varying as @xmath40 , and the non - triviality condition @xmath41 holding .",
    "we point out that the condition @xmath42 is sufficient for the previous statements to hold with @xmath43 .",
    "denote by @xmath44 the corresponding galton - watson process , started from @xmath45 .",

    "* lemma 2 ) that if @xmath46 , then @xmath47 as @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the function appearing in ( [ genfun ] ) .",
    "it is also well known that the branching process @xmath44 can be obtained as the generation size process of a galton - watson tree , @xmath50 say , with offspring distribution @xmath29 . in particular , to construct the random rooted graph tree @xmath50 , start with a single ancestor ( or root ) , and then suppose that individuals in a given generation have offspring independently of the past and each other according to the distribution of @xmath29 , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3 ) for details .",
    "the vertex set of @xmath50 is the entire collection of individuals , edges are the parent - offspring bonds , and @xmath51 is the number of individuals in the @xmath35th generation of @xmath50 . from ( [ probdecay ] ) , it is clear that @xmath50 will be a finite graph @xmath52-a.s .",
    "however , in @xcite , kesten showed that it is possible to make sense of conditioning @xmath50 to survive or ` grow to infinity ' .",
    "more specifically , there exists a unique ( in law ) random infinite rooted locally - finite graph tree @xmath53 that satisfies , for any @xmath54 , @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a bounded function on finite rooted graph trees of @xmath35 generations , and @xmath57 , @xmath58 are the first @xmath35 generations of @xmath50 , @xmath53 respectively . we will write @xmath59 to represent the shortest path graph distance on @xmath53 .",
    "given a particular realisation of @xmath53 , we will denote by @xmath60 the discrete - time biased random walk on @xmath53 , and define this as follows .",
    "first , fix a bias parameter @xmath61 , and assign to each edge connecting a vertex @xmath62 in generation @xmath63 to a vertex @xmath64 in generation @xmath65 a conductance @xmath66 .",
    "the transition probabilities of @xmath67 are then determined by @xmath68 where the notation @xmath69 means that @xmath62 and @xmath64 are connected by an edge in @xmath53 .",
    "thus , when at a vertex @xmath62 that is not equal to the root of @xmath53 , the probability of jumping to a neighbouring vertex further away from the root than @xmath62 is @xmath70 times more likely than jumping towards the root .",
    "using the usual terminology for random walks in random environments , we will say that @xmath71 is the quenched law of the biased random walk on @xmath53 started from @xmath62 .",
    "moreover , we introduce the annealed law for the process started from @xmath72 , the root of the tree @xmath53 , by setting @xmath73 it will be this law under which we investigate the rate at which the process @xmath67 , which we call the biased random walk on a critical galton - watson tree conditioned to survive , escapes from the root .    the main result we prove for the process @xmath67 concerns the time it takes to progress along the backbone . to be more specific , as is described in more detail in section [ strucsec ] , @xmath52-a.s .",
    "the tree @xmath53 admits a unique backbone , that is , a semi - infinite path starting from the root , @xmath74 say .",
    "we define @xmath75 by setting @xmath76 to be the first time the process @xmath67 reaches level @xmath35 along this path . for this process",
    ", we are able to prove the following functional limit theorem .",
    "[ dngrowth ] let @xmath77 $ ] .",
    "as @xmath48 , the laws of the processes @xmath78 under @xmath79 converge weakly with respect to the skorohod @xmath18 topology on @xmath80 to the law of @xmath81 .",
    "it is interesting to observe that this result is extremely explicit compared to its supercritical counterparts .",
    "indeed , notwithstanding the fact the lattice - effect that was the source of somewhat complicated behaviour in @xcite does not occur in the critical setting , the above scaling limit clearly describes the @xmath70-dependence of the relevant slowdown effect .",
    "note that , unlike in the supercritical case where there is a ballistic phase , this slowdown effect occurs for any non - trivial bias parameter , i.e. for any @xmath61 .",
    "furthermore , we remark that the dependence on @xmath82 is natural : as @xmath82 decreases and the leaves get thicker ( in the sense that tree s hausdorff dimension of @xmath83 increases , see @xcite ) , the biased random walk moves more slowly away from its start point .",
    "as suggested by comparing theorem [ dngrowth ] with ( [ mlim ] ) , the critical galton - watson tree case is closely linked with a sum of independent and identically - distributed random variables where @xmath84 is asymptotically equivalent to @xmath85 .",
    "although the logarithmic rate of decay is relatively easy to guess , finding the correct constant is slightly subtle , particularly for @xmath86 . this is because , unlike in the supercritical case and the critical case with @xmath43 , when @xmath86 it can happen that there are multiple deep traps emanating from a single backbone vertex . as a result",
    ", we have to take special care which of these have actually been visited when determining the time spent there , meaning that the random variable which actually has the @xmath85 tail behaviour is not environment measurable ( see lemma [ ttail ] ) . to highlight the importance of this consideration , which is also relevant albeit in a simpler way for @xmath43 , in theorem [ edngrowth ]",
    "we show that the constant that appears differs by a factor @xmath82 when @xmath87 is replaced by its quenched mean @xmath88 .",
    "theorem [ dngrowth ] readily implies the following corollary for the projection , @xmath89 , of the process @xmath90 onto the backbone ( roughly , @xmath91 is the vertex on the backbone from which the trap @xmath92 is located in emanates , see section [ rwsec ] for a precise definition ) . to state",
    "this , we define the right - continuous inverse @xmath93 of @xmath94 by setting @xmath95    [ treecor ] let @xmath77 $ ] . as @xmath48 ,",
    "the laws of the processes @xmath96 under @xmath79 converge weakly with respect to the skorohod @xmath19 topology on @xmath80 to the law of @xmath93 .",
    "since the height of the leaves in which the random walk can be found at time @xmath97 ( see the localisation result of lemma [ localtree ] ) will typically be of order @xmath35 , some further argument will be necessary to deduce a limit result for the graph distance @xmath98 itself .",
    "another characteristic property that we are able to show is that the random walk also exhibits extremal aging .",
    "[ extagingtree ] let @xmath77 $ ] .",
    "for any @xmath99 , we have @xmath100    although regular aging has previously been observed for random walks in random environments in the sub - ballistic regime on @xmath101 ( see @xcite ) , as far as we know , this is the first example of a random walk in random environment where extremal aging has been proved . as already hinted at , this kind of behaviour , as well as that demonstrated in theorem [ dngrowth ] and corollary [ treecor ] , places the biased random walk on a critical galton - watson tree conditioned to survive in a different universality class to that of the supercritical structures discussed previously . in the class of critical galton - watson trees we have instead the spin glass models considered in @xcite and @xcite , and the trap models with slowly - varying tails we introduce in the next section .      in this section",
    ", we describe the one - dimensional trap model with which we want to compare to our main model , and the results we are able to prove for it . to start with a formal definition ,",
    "let @xmath102 be a family of independent and identically - distributed strictly positive ( and finite ) random variables whose distribution has a slowly - varying tail , in the sense described by ( [ svartail ] ) , built on a probability space with measure @xmath52 ; the sequence @xmath102 will represent the trap environment . for a fixed bias parameter @xmath61 ,",
    "the directed trap model is then the continuous - time markov process @xmath103 with state space @xmath101 , given by @xmath104 and with jump rates @xmath105 and @xmath106 otherwise . to be more explicit , for a particular realisation of @xmath107 we will write @xmath108 for the law of the markov chain with the above transition rates , started from @xmath62 ; similarly to describing @xmath71 in the previous section , we call this the quenched law for the directed trap model",
    ". the corresponding annealed law @xmath109 is obtained by integrating out the environment similarly to ( [ annealedlaw ] ) , i.e. @xmath110    in studying the rate of escape of the above directed trap model , it is our initial aim to determine the rate of growth of @xmath111 that is , the hitting times of level @xmath35 by the process @xmath67 .",

    "* remark 2.4 ) , we note that the proof of the above result may be significantly simplified in the case when @xmath84 decays logarithmically .",
    "the reason for this is that , in the logarithmic case , the hitting time @xmath115 is very well - approximated by the maximum holding time within the first @xmath35 vertices , and so the functional scaling limit for @xmath75 can be readily obtained from a simple study of the maximum holding time process . for general slowly varying functions ,",
    "the same approximation does not provide tight enough control on @xmath115 to apply this argument , and so a more sophisticated approach is required .    as a simple corollary of theorem [ onedhit ]",
