    "the past several decades have witnessed a considerable scientific effort within the condensed matter community to unravel the true origin of high temperature superconductivity ( hts ) @xcite . due to the proximity of antiferromagnetic order and hts in the doping phase diagram , as shown in fig .",
    "[ intro](a ) , the relationship between magnetism and superconductivity has been discussed extensively .",
    "this even includes postulating that superconducting pairing is driven by the exchange of magnetic excitations , although putting such a scenario on firm theoretical footing remains very challenging @xcite .",
    "what is clear , however , is that the coulomb repulsion , @xmath5 , plays a dominant role in the formation of the anti - ferromagnetic ( afm ) insulating state in the cuprate parent compounds and that this leads to the emergence of well - defined spin wave or magnon excitations @xcite .",
    "these disperse up to very high energies ( about 300  mev ) along the anti - nodal direction in the brillouin zone [ @xmath6 in commonly used tetragonal notation ] and up to comparable but somewhat lower energies along the nodal [ @xmath7 direction .",
    "such a large energy scale would naturally be expected to play a central role over a large fraction of the phase diagram .",
    "there have consequently been extensive efforts to characterize the nature of magnetism across the cuprate phase diagram @xcite , which have demonstrated that substantial magnetic spectral weight persists to at least optimal doping ( i.e.  a hole concentration @xmath8 ) .",
    "a more controversial issue is what happens for the overdoped cuprates with hole concentration @xmath9 . in this doping range inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) indicates that the energy , @xmath10 , and wavevector , , integrated magnetic spectral weight is strongly reduced @xcite .",
    "this even encompasses discussions of whether magnetism might effectively disappear completely in the overdoped regime and whether this might be the reason that hts is suppressed at a similar doping level @xcite .",
    "more extensive studies of the overdoped cuprates , and how their excitations relate to the magnons in the parent compounds , are therefore desirable . in recent years",
    "resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( rixs ) @xcite has emerged as a complementary tool to ins in the investigation of magnetic excitations in the cuprates @xcite . in particular ,",
    "rixs offers the possibility to probe very small sample volumes @xcite and to perform more extensive doping dependence as the large single crystal samples required for ins are often highly challenging to produce for overdoped cuprates .",

    "@xcite , this constitutes an extensive characterization of the high energy magnetic excitation spectrum throughout the lsco phase diagram .",
    "we find a gradual softening and broadening of the paramagnon feature with doping .",
    "the high - energy magnetic excitations studied here do not show any strong changes that correlate with the suppression of superconductivity in the overdoped regime , consistent with previous work asserting that these modes have a marginal role in hts @xcite .",
    "this is notably different from the low - energy afm correlations around @xmath13 which _ are _ strongly modified in the overdoped regime .",
    "qualitatively similar differences between the nodal and anti - nodal directions are captured by calculations of the magnetic excitation spectrum based on itinerant quasi - particles , which is discussed in terms of conceptualizing magnetism in the overdoped cuprates @xcite .",
    "thin film lsco samples were synthesized on single - crystal lasralo@xmath2 substrates with atomic layer - by - layer molecular beam epitaxy @xcite .",
    "typical surface root - mean - square roughnesses , as determined by atomic force microscopy , were about 3   , which helps to reduce the contribution of diffuse elastic scattering to the rixs spectra .",

    "the rixs data presented were collected using the saxes spectrometer @xcite at the adress beamline @xcite of the swiss light source at the paul scherrer institute .",
    "further checks were performed at the ags - agm spectrometer @xcite at bl05a1  the inelastic scattering beamline at the national synchrotron radiation research center , taiwan .",
    "energy resolution measurements carried out on carbon tape immediately before sample measurements gave an overall energy resolution of @xmath15  mev full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) and served as a reference for the zero energy loss calibration .",

    "this model provides a good description of the spectral lineshape for the @xmath14 insulator below 1  ev .",
    "the broader features at higher dopings makes it impossible to convincingly separate the multi - magnon and the phonon features from the paramagnon and we perform fits in which a single peak accounts for all these features to allow for direct comparison with previous work @xcite .",
    "we also note that a recent report discussed the appropriateness of this widely used scheme in the case of heavily overdamped modes @xcite .",
    "we examined this issue in detail as described in the supplemental material , concluding that the functional form we use is adequate for the damping rates found in this study @xcite .",

    "a dispersive magnon is observed with a maximum energy transfer of @xmath34  mev around the brillouin zone boundary consistent with spin wave theory predictions based on ins @xcite and previous rixs studies @xcite .",
    "the magnetic continuum feature is challenging to unambiguously separate from the magnon , but , as expected , it lies at higher energies and is less dispersive than the magnon .",
    "the 90  mev feature has negligible -dependence ( @xmath35  mev ) , limited by the errorbars , consistent with it being an optical phonon @xcite .",
    "we now discuss the doping evolution of the nodal excitations plotted as a colormap in fig .",
    "[ 2d_plots ] .",
    "low energy spectral features are visible for all studied dopings . detailed incident energy dependence has confirmed the magnetic nature of these spectral features @xcite , consistent with theoretical calculations @xcite and the smooth evolution of these features with respect to the unambiguously magnetic feature in la@xmath29cuo@xmath2 .",
    "future experiments that explicitly resolve the scattered x - ray polarization would be a valuable addition to this issue @xcite . in comparison to the parent compound ,",
    "the magnetic spectral weight is broadened and appears to be softened .",
    "both these effects appear to occur continuously as the doping spans the phase diagram from the pseudogap ( @xmath36 ) , underdoped ( @xmath37 ) , nearly optimal ( @xmath38 ) , and all the way to the overdoped phase ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "this phenomenology is consistent with previous examinations of the nodal dispersion in bi@xmath29sr@xmath29ca@xmath39cu@xmath40o@xmath41 @xcite and lsco ( @xmath4 , @xmath42 ) @xcite . the present data , alongside ref .",

    "the characteristic energy of the excitations was addressed in more detail by fitting analysis as shown in fig .",

    "as can be seen , the fitting procedure is able to reliably reproduce the experimental curves despite the significant broadening at higher dopings .",

    "[ dis_wid_int](a ) is very apparent , with the overdoped sample in particular showing a significant drop of around @xmath43  mev , with respect to @xmath14 , at high .",
    "the paramagnon energy also becomes progressively less -dependent with doping .",

    "[ dis_wid_int](b ) ] , fitting the @xmath14 spectrum yields a value of around 75  mev , which is likely to come from difficulties separating contributions from phonons and the magnetic continuum from the magnetic pole @xcite and should be thought of as an upper limit on the width . upon doping the average width",

    "a comparison between the nodal and anti - nodal dispersions , and how they relate to the dispersion in the parent compound , is presented in fig .",

    "the dashed line represents the dispersion from spin - wave theory for la@xmath29cuo@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "both the nodal and anti - nodal directions are shown , with the results for the same samples from a previous work displayed as purple circles @xcite .",
    "dispersive magnetic excitations are clearly present for all dopings , albeit with strongly reduced dispersion particularly in the nodal direction .",
    "this extends the discussion of the behavior of the magnetic excitations in the anti - nodal direction @xcite to the nodal direction within the brillouin zone .",
    "it is clear that the overdoped cuprates do not become trivial , completely non - magnetic , fermi - liquids .",
    "rather the effects of @xmath5 still appear to be present in the form of strongly damped high energy magnetic excitations within the region in reciprocal space we have studied [ shown in fig.[intro](c ) ] .",
    "these results help constrain theoretical models of magnetism in the cuprates . the hubbard model , in either its one or three band variants , is often considered to be the best - justified starting point for modeling magnetism in the cuprates ( and strongly correlated materials more generally ) @xcite .",
    "calculations of the hubbard model indeed capture the persistent high energy magnetic excitations in good accord with experiments @xcite .",
    "however , such calculations are typically confined to small lattices and there is significant interest in conceptualizing magnetism in terms of either local moment @xcite or ( renormalized ) itinerant quasiparticle methods @xcite . a local moment based approach is well justified in la@xmath29cuo@xmath2 and has been used a lot in terms of describing stripe physics in the underdoped regime @xcite .",
    "such an approach also naturally explains why the intensity of the excitations in the doped cuprates is of a comparable magnitude to those in the insulator .",
    "itinerant quasi - particle pictures , in which correlations are treated within several different approximate schemes , are also popular .",
    "these have a significant advantage in terms of allowing predictions with high -resolution @xcite .",
    "they also capture the fact that the nodal excitations are more strongly doping dependent than the anti - nodal excitations , as observed here .",
    "it is also important to consider the data presented here in the context of previous ins measurements @xcite .",
    "spin wave theory for afm la@xmath29cuo@xmath2 implies that the dispersion around @xmath45 and @xmath13 should be symmetric . on this basis , it is tempting to compare rixs and ins data on doped cuprates assuming this symmetry .",
    "figure  [ recipspace ] shows that for @xmath46 the magnetic excitations at wavevectors accessed by rixs around @xmath45 have a significantly lower energy scale than excitations seen by neutrons around @xmath13 @xcite suggesting that this symmetry breaks down in the doped cuprates and such a comparison appears invalid .",
    "unfortunately , there is very little directly comparable rixs and ins data taken at the same , however , the one available study suggests that both methods provide similar access to magnetic dispersions @xcite .    in the context of hts",
    ", we note that the high energy excitations studied here show minimal changes in going from the optimally doped to the overdoped regime . as such , they further support previous assertions that the high - energy magnetic excitations observed here are marginal to superconducting pairing @xcite .",
    "this hypothesis tallies with a simple consideration of how a repulsive interaction might contribute to @xmath47-wave pairing in the cuprates via transitions between different states near the fermi level .",
    "in such a scenario the excitations around @xmath13 would be expected to have a stronger contribution than excitations elsewhere in and excitations far from @xmath13 can even lead to pair breaking and reduction of @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "the paramagnon dispersion along the nodal direction in the brillouin zone is reported for samples spanning the lsco phase diagram from the afm insulator to the overdoped superconductor .",
    "we found a gradual softening and damping of the paramagnon excitation with doping as predicted by hubbard model calculations @xcite .",
    "the character of the excitations indicates that magnetic correlations in the cuprates have both localized and itinerant character .",
    "these findings further support suggestions that the high energy magnetic excitations studied here have a marginal role for hts @xcite . likely , the destruction of other pairing interactions , such as the low energy magnetic excitations , is instead culpable for the drop in @xmath48 with overdoping .",
