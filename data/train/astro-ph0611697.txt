    "multiple spectral observations for each source were then median - combined after scaling the individual spectra to match the highest signal - to - noise observation .",

    "corrections for dr effects in the spectrum of the fainter component , both in terms of slit losses and contamination from the bright primary , were determined by simulating the light throughput for both sources as a function of wavelength .",
    "we first created a model of stacked @xmath27-band guiding images ( acquired at one dither position during the spectral observations ) using two symmetric gaussian surfaces and a box - car slit profile .",

    "both effects were calculated using our model images by shifting the centers of the gaussian profiles in accordance with the dr shifts ( keeping the seeing and relative flux ratios constant ) , and calculating the total light throughput for both components in the slit .",

    "contamination from the primary was removed by subtracting a spectrum of 2mass  j1520@xmath54422a scaled by the wavelength - dependent contribution of its light through the slit relative to the secondary from the dr model .",
    "figure  [ fig_corrected ] shows the spectrum of 2mass  j1520@xmath54422b before and after these effects have been accounted for .",
    "the corrected spectrum is significantly redder , as both slit losses and light contamination suppress @xmath27-band light from this component .",
    "similar simulations were used to calculate dr slit losses for the spectrum of the primary assuming it to be centered on the slit at @xmath27-band .",
    "these were smaller ( @xmath43 10% slit loss for @xmath44 1 @xmath39 ) , due to the large size of the seeing disk relative to the slit width .",
    "light contamination from the secondary was found to be negligible .",
    "the reduced prism spectra ( including dr and contamination corrections ) of the two 2mass  j1520@xmath54422 components are shown in figure  [ fig_prism ] .",
    "these spectra are qualitatively similar to jh spectra presented in @xcite .",
    "both components have spectral energy distributions consistent with early - type l dwarfs , including red optical and near - infrared spectral slopes ; deep h@xmath45o absorption bands at 1.4 and 1.9  @xmath39 ; strong co absorption at 2.3  @xmath39 ; feh and crh bands at 0.86 , 0.99 , 1.2 and 1.6  @xmath39 ; a notable absence of tio and vo features shortward of 1 @xmath39 and unresolved and atomic lines at @xmath24-band @xcite .",

    "xd data were reduced using the spextool package , following similar procedures but using a line shape kernel derived from the 1.005 @xmath39 pa @xmath47 line in the a0  v calibrator spectra .",
    "after telluric and flux calibration , the five orders spanning 0.822.43 @xmath39 were scaled and combined using the prism spectrum of 2mass  j1520@xmath54422a as a relative flux template .    the reduced xd spectrum for 2mass  j1520@xmath54422 is shown in figure  [ fig_sxd ] .",
    "while these data have lower overall signal - to - noise than the prism data ( particularly shortward of 0.98 @xmath39 and in the telluric bands ) , many of the small wiggles observed in this spectrum are real , arising largely from h@xmath45o and feh transitions and numerous atomic metal lines .",
    "the strongest atomic features are the and doublet lines at @xmath24-band , which are shown in detail in the inset of figure  [ fig_sxd ] .",
    "in addition , there are several lines from and feh , and broader feh bands , in this spectral region .",
    "co bandheads at 2.299 , 2.328 , 2.357 and 2.388 @xmath39 are clearly discerned , but the 2.206/2.209 @xmath39 doublet is notably absent .",
    "the absence of this feature provides further evidence that 2mass  j1520@xmath54422 is composed of l dwarfs @xcite .",
    "similarly , the absence of the 1.314 @xmath39 line is consistent with an l spectral type , while the presence of the 1.189 @xmath39 line suggests a composite spectral type of l3 or earlier @xcite .",
    "equivalent widths ( ew ) of the 1.169 , 1.178 and 1.253 @xmath39 lines and 1.189 line were measured using gaussian fits to the line profiles and linear fits to the nearby pseudocontinuum ( the 1.244 @xmath39 was not measured as its blue wing is blended with an feh band ) .",
    "values of 6@xmath22 , 8.3@xmath21.8 , 8.0@xmath21.6 and 0.5@xmath20.2  , respectively , were derived and are comparable to other early - type l dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the resolved prism spectra of the 2mass  j1520@xmath54422 components allow us to derive individual spectral types .",
    "however , while a robust classification scheme for l dwarfs exists at optical wavelengths @xcite , there is as yet no well - defined scheme in the near - infrared ; i.e. , following the tenets of the mk process @xcite .",
    "we therefore determined subtypes for these sources using a variety of spectral indices from the literature that are applicable to low resolution near - infrared spectral data .",
    "@xcite have defined several indices measuring the strengths of h@xmath45o and co bands , as well as color ratios , for late - type m and l dwarf spectra .",
    "they provide linear spectral type calibrations anchored to optical classifications for their h@xmath45o - a and h@xmath45o - b indices ( sampling the 1.1 and 1.4  @xmath39 h@xmath45o bands ) and the @xmath48 index of @xcite over spectral types m8 to l6 .",

    "finally , @xcite utilized several near - infrared indices to classify late - type m , l and t dwarfs , two of which ( h@xmath45o 1.5@xmath39 and ch@xmath49 2.2@xmath39 ) are applicable in the l dwarf regime ( for spectral types l0l9 and l3l9 , respectively ) . unlike the other near - infrared schemes , @xcite tie spectral types to their indices with predetermined numerical ranges set by measurements for a large sample of vlm dwarf spectra .",

    "this is consistent with the types derived by @xcite , l2 and l4 , within the stated uncertainties .",
    "the xd spectrum is classified l2.5@xmath20.8 , as expected for contributions from both components to the combined light spectrum .    to confirm these classifications , we compared the prism spectra to an array of equivalent data for previously classified field l dwarfs with similar optical and/or near - infrared subtypes , as shown in figure  [ fig_classify ] .",

    "the agreement of the near - infrared spectra of 2mass  j1520@xmath54422a and b with those of optically - classified sources suggests that the derived subtypes could be adopted as their optical classifications .",
    "however , a number of studies @xcite have found that optical and near - infrared spectral types can not be assumed to be identical for mid- and late - type l dwarfs due to the complexity of their atmospheres .",

    "the spectral indices used above yield mean near - infrared subtypes of l1 , l2.5 and l4 for ssspm j0829 - 1309 , kelu  1 and sips j0921 - 2104 , respectively ( see also knapp et al .",
    "2004 and lodieu et al .",
    "2005 regarding the near - infrared spectrum of kelu  1 ) .",
    "such classification disagreements have been attributed to a variety of causes , including variations in photospheric dust content @xcite , unresolved multiplicity @xcite and gravity effects @xcite .",
    "these complexities emphasize the need for a robust , independent and multi - dimensional near - infrared classification scheme for l dwarfs .    assuming that the derived near - infrared spectral types for 2mass  j1520@xmath54422a and b are at least suitable proxies for their optical classifications , spectrophotometric distance estimates for each component were computed using measured photometry and absolute 2mass magnitude / spectral type relations from @xcite ; and @xcite .",

    "the absence of any distinct low metallicity features in the near - infrared spectra of the 2mass  j1520@xmath54422 components that characterize l subdwarfs @xcite also indicates that this system is likely an old member of the galactic disk population .",
