    "the two - photon hong - ou - mandel ( hom ) dip has been demonstrated first in 1987 @xcite . in their experiment ,",
    "hong , ou and mandel sent two identical photons simultaneously through the separate input ports of a @xmath1 beam splitter .",
    "each output port contained a photon detector .",
    "surprisingly , no coincidence detections within the temporal coherence length of the photons , i.e.  no simultaneous clicks in both detectors , were recorded .",
    "crucial for the observation of this effect was the identicalness of the pure quantum states of the input photons , which differed only in the directions of their wave vectors .",
    "this allowed the photons to become indistinguishable and to interfere within the setup .",
    "the detectors could not resolve the origin of each observed photon .    due to the nature of this experiment ,",
    "the hom dip was soon employed for quantum mechanical tests of local realism @xcite and for the generation of postselected entanglement between two photons @xcite .",
    "linear optics bell measurements on photon pairs rely intrinsically on the hom dip @xcite , which has also been a building block for the implementation of linear optics gates for quantum information processing with photonic qubits @xcite .",
    "shor s factorisation algorithm @xcite , for example , relies on multiple path interference to achieve massive parallelism @xcite and multiphoton interference has to play a crucial role in any implementation of this algorithm using linear optics .",
    "since it requires temporal and spatial mode - matched photons , observing the hom dip for two photons is also a good test of their indistinguishability .",
    "hom interference has been applied to characterise recently introduced sources for the generation of single photons on demand by testing the identicalness of successively generated photons @xcite . another interesting test based on the hom dip",
    "has been studied by bose and home , who showed that it can reveal whether the statistics of two identical particles passing through a @xmath2 beam splitter is fermionic or bosonic @xcite .    motivated by the variety of possible applications of the two - photon hom dip , this paper investigates generalised hom experiments .",
    "we consider a straightforward generalisation of the scattering of two particles through a @xmath1 beam splitter , namely the scattering of @xmath0 particles through a symmetric @xmath3 bell multiport beam splitter . while numerous studies on @xmath0 photon interference in the _ constructive _ sense , i.e.  resulting in the enhancement of a certain photon detection syndrome ,",
    "have been made ( see e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite ) , not much attention has been paid to multiple path interference in the _ destructive _ sense .",
    "recently walborn _",
    "_ studied so - called multimode hom effects for photon pairs with several inner degrees of freedom , including the spatial and the polarisation degrees of freedom @xcite . a notable example for",
    "destructive hom interference has been given by campos @xcite , who studied certain triple coincidences in the output ports of an asymmetric @xmath4 multiport beam splitter , which is also known as a tritter .",
    "possible realisations of the @xmath3 bell multiport for photons , behaving like bosons , are shown in figure [ scheme ] .",
    "they may consist of a network of beam splitters and phase plates @xcite but can also be made by splicing @xmath0 optical fibers @xcite .",
    "such spliced fibre constructions are commercially available and can include between @xmath14 and @xmath15 input and output ports .",
    "the main feature of the symmetric bell multiport is that a photon entering any of the input ports is equally likely redirected to any of the possible output ports .",
    "it can therefore be used to produce higher dimensional epr correlations @xcite and for the generation of so - called noon states with special applications in lithography @xcite . moreover",
    ", the @xmath3 bell multiport can be used to prepare a great variety of multiphoton entangled states @xcite and to maximise the success probability when teleporting photonic qubits @xcite .",
    "furthermore , bell multiport beam splitters exist for a wide variety of fermions and bosons .",
    "for example , multiports for bosonic or fermionic atoms can consist of a network of electrode wave guide beam splitters on an atom chip @xcite .",
    "multiports for electrons , who behave like fermions , can be realised by fabricating a network of quantum point contacts @xcite , split gates @xcite or semiconductor multiterminal nanostructures @xcite acting as two - electron beam splitters and can be used , for example , to detect two - electron bell states @xcite .",
    "specially doped optical fibres have recently been introduced in the literature and are expected to constitute beam splitters for  fermion - like \" photons @xcite .    as in the original hom experiment @xcite",
    ", we assume in the following , that a particle detector is placed in each output port of the scattering beam splitter array . the incoming particles should enter the different input ports more or less simultaneously and such that there is one particle per input port .",
    "moreover , we assume that the particles are identical .",
    "it is shown , that it is impossible to observe a particle in each output port for even numbers @xmath0 of bosons .",
    "we denote this effect of zero coincidence detection as the _ generalised hom dip_. it is also shown that fermions always leave the setup separately exhibiting perfect coincidence detection . since the interference behaviour of both types of particles is very different ,",
    "the bell multiport can be used to reveal their quantum statistics .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section",
    "[ scatter ] we introduce the theoretical description of particle scattering through a symmetric bell multiport .",
    "section [ two ] describes the scattering of two particles through a @xmath16 beam splitter as an example . in section",
    "[ many ] , we derive the condition for the generalised hom dip for bosons and analyse the scattering of fermions through the same setup for comparison .",
    "finally we conclude our results in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "let us first introduce the notation for the description of the scattering of @xmath0 particles through a passive setup .",
    "we proceed in close analogy to the scattering of photons through a linear optics network @xcite .",
    "suppose each input port @xmath7 is entered by a particle with creation operator @xmath6 .",
    "then the input state of the system equals @xmath17 is the vacuum state with no particles in the setup .",
    "moreover , @xmath18 denotes the unitary scattering matrix , which connects the input state to its output state @xmath19 ) and the relation @xmath20 then yields @xmath21 since @xmath22 for the considered passive setup . as long as no particles enter the system , it remains in its vacuum state .",
    "the bell multiport beam splitter directs each incoming particle with equal probability to all output ports . to describe this",
    ", we introduce the matrix elements @xmath23 , which give the amplitude for the distribution of a particle from input port @xmath7 to output port @xmath13 .",
    "especially , for an @xmath3 bell multiport one has @xcite",
    "@xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the @xmath0-th root of unity @xmath26 the corresponding matrix @xmath27 is also known as the discrete fourier transform matrix and has been widely considered in the literature @xcite . proceeding as in section ii.d of ref .",
    "@xcite , it can easily be verified that @xmath27 is unitary as well as symmetric .",
    "if @xmath28 denotes the creation operator for a single particle in output port @xmath13 , the definition of the scattering matrix @xmath27 implies that @xmath29 inserting this into eq .",
    "( [ fin2 ] ) , we obtain latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }   \\label{output1 }    this equation describes the independent redirection of the incoming particles to their potential output ports .",
    "conservation of the norm of the state vector is provided by the unitarity of the transition matrix @xmath27 .",
    "note that up to now , we have not invoked any assumptions about the nature of the particles .",
    "the formalism in this section applies to bosons and fermions equally .",
    "before analysing the general case , we motivate our discussion by considering two identical particles entering the different input ports of a @xmath16 beam splitter . for @xmath31 ,",
    "the transition matrix ( [ fourier ] ) becomes the hadamard matrix @xmath32 and the input state ( [ in ] ) becomes @xmath33 .",
    "note that local measurements on this input state can not reveal any information about the bosonic or fermionic nature of the two particles .",
    "however , using eq .",
    "( [ output1 ] ) , we find that the beam splitter prepares the system in the state @xmath34 ) .",
    "their quantum statistics can now be revealed using local measurements .",
    "bosons obey the commutation law ( [ boson ] ) .",
    "using this , the output state ( [ n2 ] ) becomes @xmath35 |0 \\rangle \\ , , \\ ] ] which implies a zero - coincidence count rate at the output ports .",
    "the particles bunch together in the same output port and exhibit the famous hom dip ( see figure [ hom](a ) ) .",
    "in contrast , fermions obey the anticommutation relation ( [ fermion ] ) and their output state @xmath36 implies perfect particle coincidence .",
    "this means that the fermions always arrive in separate output ports and never bunch together ( see figure [ hom](b ) ) .",
    "a @xmath16 beam splitter can therefore indeed be used to distinguish bosons and fermions @xcite .",
    "we now consider the general case of @xmath0 particles passing through an @xmath3 bell multiport beam splitter . as in the @xmath31 case",
    ", the setup redirects each incoming particle with equal probability to any of the possible output ports , thereby erasing the information about the origin of each particle and making them indistinguishable by detection . for even numbers of bosons , this results in the generalised hom dip and zero coincidence detection .",
    "in contrast , fermions leave the setup always separately , thus demonstrating maximum coincidence detection . observing this extreme behaviour can be used , for example , to verify the quantum statistics of _ many _ particles experimentally .      in order to derive the necessary condition for the appearance of the generalised hom dip for even numbers of bosons , we calculate the output state ( [ output1 ] ) of the system under the condition of the collection of one particle per output port .",
    "each term contributing to the projected conditional output state @xmath37 can be characterised by a certain permutation , which maps the particles in the input ports @xmath38 to the output ports @xmath38 . in the following ,",
    "we denote any of the @xmath39 permutations by @xmath40 with @xmath41 being the @xmath7-th element of the list obtained when applying the permutation @xmath40 onto the list @xmath42 . using this notation",
    ", @xmath37 equals up to normalisation @xmath43 is the probability to detect one particle per output port .",
    "it is therefore also the probability for observing coincidence counts in all @xmath0 detectors .    up to now",
    ", the nature of the particles has not yet been taken into account .",
    "using the commutation relation ( [ boson ] ) for bosons , the conditional output state ( [ pro ] ) becomes latexmath:[\\[\\label{properm }    with the permanent of the matrix @xmath27 defined as @xcite @xmath45 the permanent of a matrix is superficially similar to the determinant .",
    "however , there exist hardly any mathematical theorems that can simplify the calculation of the permanent of an arbitrary matrix .",
    "to derive a condition for the impossibility of coincidence detections , we have to see when the probability ( [ suc ] ) equals zero . using eq .",
    "( [ properm ] ) , we find @xmath46 the key to the following proof is to show that the transition matrix @xmath27 of the bell multiport possesses a certain symmetry such that its permanent vanishes in certain cases .",
    "suppose the matrix @xmath27 is multiplied by a diagonal matrix @xmath47 with matrix elements @xmath48 this generates a matrix @xmath49 with @xmath50 we now introduce the modulus function defined as @xmath51 , if @xmath52 is dividable by @xmath0 and @xmath53 . since @xmath54 , the matrix elements ( [ ma ] ) can be expressed as @xmath55 note that the function @xmath56 maps each element of the list @xmath57 respectively to the list @xmath58 . a comparison with eq .",
    "( [ fourier ] ) therefore shows that @xmath59 in other words , the multiplication with @xmath47 amounts to nothing more than a cyclic permutation of the columns of the matrix @xmath27 .",
    "taking the cyclic permutation symmetry of the permanent of a matrix ( see definition ( [ perm ] ) ) into account , we obtain @xmath60 however , we also have the relation @xmath61 with the permanent of the diagonal matrix @xmath47 given by @xmath62 for @xmath0 being even , a comparison of eqs .",
    "( [ proof1 ] ) - ( [ relative ] ) reveals that @xmath63 as a consequence , eq .",
    "( [ almost ] ) implies that @xmath64 .",
    "coincidence detection in all output ports of the setup is impossible for even numbers of bosons .",
    "this is not necessarily so , if the number of particles is odd .",
    "for example , for @xmath65 one can check that there is no hom dip by calculating @xmath66 explicitly .",
    "campos showed that observing a hom dip for @xmath65 is nevertheless possible with the help of a specially designed asymmetric multiport beam splitter @xcite .",
    "fermions scattering through a bell multiport beam splitter show another extreme behaviour .",
    "independent of the number @xmath0 of particles involved , they always leave the setup via different output ports , thereby guaranteeing perfect coincidence detection .",
    "as expected , particles obeying the quantum statistics of fermions can not populate the same mode .",
    "again , we assume that each input port is simultaneously entered by one particle and denote the creation operator of a fermion in output port @xmath7 by @xmath67 . proceeding as in section [ bos ] ,",
    "one finds again that the output state of the system under the condition of the collection of one particle per output port is given by eq .",
    "( [ pro ] ) . to simplify this equation",
    ", we now introduce the sign function of a permutation with @xmath68 , depending on whether the permutation @xmath40 is even or odd .",
    "an even ( odd ) permutation is one , that can be decomposed into an even ( odd ) number of integer interchanges . using this notation and taking the anticommutator relation for fermions ( [ fermion ] ) into account",
    ", we find @xmath69 a closer look at this equation shows that the amplitude of this state relates to the determinant of the transformation matrix given by @xmath70 since @xmath27 is unitary , one has @xmath71 and therefore also , as eq .",
    "( [ suc ] ) shows , @xmath72 this means , that fermions always leave the system separately , i.e.  with one particle per output port . in the above",
    ", we only used the unitarity of the transition matrix @xmath27 but not it s concrete form .",
    "perfect coincidence detection therefore applies to any situation where fermions pass through an @xmath3 multiport , i.e.  independent of its realisation .",
    "we analysed a situation , where @xmath0 particles enter the @xmath0 different input ports of a symmetric bell multiport beam splitter simultaneously .",
    "if these particles obey a fermionic quantum statistics , they always leave the setup independently with one particle per output port .",
    "this results in perfect coincidence detection , if detectors are placed in the output ports of the setup . in contrast to this , even numbers @xmath0 of bosons have been shown to never leave the setup with one particle per output port .",
    "this constitutes a generalisation of the two - photon hom dip to the case of arbitrary even numbers @xmath0 of bosons .",
    "the generalised hom dip is in general not observable when @xmath0 is odd .",
    "the proof exploits the cyclic symmetry of the setup .",
    "we related the coincidence detection in the output ports to the permanent or the determinant of the transition matrix @xmath27 describing the multiport , depending on the bosonic or fermionic nature of the scattered particles .",
    "although the definition of the permanent of a matrix resembles that of the determinant , there exist almost no theorems to simplify their calculation @xcite .",
    "in fact , the computation of the permanent is an np - complete problem and much harder than the calculation of a determinant , which is only a p problem in complexity .",
    "experimental setups involving the scattering of bosons through a multiport therefore have important applications in quantum information processing .",
    "for example , part of the linear optics quantum computing scheme by knill , laflamme and milburn @xcite is based on photon scattering through a bell multiport beam splitter .",
    "in contrast to this , the scattering of non - interacting fermions through the same corresponding circuit , can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer @xcite .",
    "moreover , the quantum statistics of particles has been used for a variety of quantum information processing tasks such as entanglement concentration @xcite and entanglement transfer @xcite .",
    "completely new perspectives might open when using setups that can change the quantum behaviour of particles and convert , for example , photons into fermions @xcite .    finally , we remark that observing hom interference of many particles is experimentally very robust .",
    "our results can therefore also be used to verify the quantum statistics of particles experimentally as well as to characterise or align an experimental setup .",
    "testing the predicted results does not require phase stability in the input or output ports nor detectors with maximum efficiency .",
    "the reason is that any phase factor that a particle accumulates in any of the input or output ports contributes at most to an overall phase factor of the output state @xmath73 .",
    "however , the coincidence statistics is sensitive to the phase factors accumulated inside the multiport beam splitter as they affect the form of the transition matrix ( [ fourier ] ) .",
    "the case , where the input ports of the setup are not entered by perfect one - particle states but by mixtures containing also a vacuum component can be analysed , in principle , using the methods introduced by berry _",
