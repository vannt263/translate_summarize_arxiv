    "the fact of considering the discovered scalar particle at the cern - lhc as the higgs particle of the standard model ( sm ) , with very similar properties and a measured mass of @xmath3 gev  @xcite and @xmath4 gev  @xcite , has at present reached a broad consensus .    on the other hand ,",
    "there is also a major consensus about the fact that the sm must be modified to include the neutrino masses and oscillations in agreement with present data  @xcite , which are nowadays quite impressive and call for an explanation from a theoretical framework beyond the sm . in that sense , we consider here one of the simplest and most appealing extensions of the sm , the inverse seesaw model ( iss )  @xcite , which extends the sm particle content by adding pairs of right - handed ( rh ) neutrinos with opposite lepton number . the seesaw mechanism that produces the small light physical neutrino masses in the iss",
    "is associated to the smallness of the majorana mass model parameters and it allows for large yukawa neutrino couplings while having at the same time moderately heavy rh neutrino masses at the @xmath5 energies which are reachable at the present colliders , like the lhc .",
    "in addition , these rh neutrinos can produce non - negligible contributions to processes with lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) via radiative corrections that are mediated by the sizable neutrino yukawa couplings , therefore leading to some hint of these rare processes , which are totally absent in the sm .",
    "combining higgs physics with lfv , we study , within the iss context with three extra pairs of rh neutrinos , the higgs decays into lepton - antilepton pairs @xmath6 with @xmath7 ( lfvhd ) , which are being currently explored at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to our main article  @xcite for more information and details about the full one - loop computation of the lfv partial decay widths , the complete set of references and our full numerical results .",
    "the iss supplements the sm with pairs of rh neutrinos , denoted here by @xmath8 and @xmath9 , with opposite lepton number . we consider a generic model containing three pairs of fermionic singlets , extending the sm lagrangian with the following neutrino yukawa interactions and mass terms : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the sm lepton doublet",
    ", @xmath12 is the sm higgs doublet , @xmath13 , with @xmath14 the corresponding pauli matrix , @xmath15 is the @xmath16 neutrino yukawa coupling matrix , @xmath17 is a lepton number conserving complex @xmath16 mass matrix , and @xmath18 is a majorana complex @xmath16 symmetric mass matrix that violates lepton number conservation by two units .",
    "after electroweak symmetry breaking , the @xmath19 neutrino mass matrix reads , in the electroweak interaction basis @xmath20 , @xmath21 with the @xmath16 dirac mass matrix given by @xmath22 , and the higgs vacuum expectation value taken to be @xmath23 .    in the one generation case , which allows us to illustrate more simply the dependence on the seesaw parameters , there would be just three iss model parameters , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath15 , and there would be just three physical eigenstates : one light @xmath24 and two heavy @xmath25 and @xmath26 . in the limit @xmath27",
    ", the mass eigenvalues are given by : @xmath28 with the light neutrino mass @xmath29 being proportional to @xmath18 , thus making it naturally small , and the two heavy masses @xmath30 being close to each other .",
    "as a consequence in this @xmath27 limit , these two nearly degenerate heavy neutrinos combine to form a pseudo - dirac fermion .",
    "a similar pattern of neutrino mass eigenvalues occurs in the three generation case , with one light and two nearly degenerate heavy neutrinos per generation .",
    "we will consider first the simplest iss scenarios with diagonal @xmath18 and @xmath17 matrices ( case i ) . in order to implement easily the compatibility with present neutrino data in these scenarios , we use here the helpful casas - ibarra parametrization  @xcite that can be directly applied to the iss case , giving : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a unitary matrix that diagonalizes @xmath33 according to @xmath34 and @xmath35 is a complex orthogonal matrix that can be written in terms of three arbitrary complex angles @xmath36 .",
    "the input iss parameters that have to be fixed in this case i are the following : @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath36 and the entries of the @xmath40 matrix .    on the other hand , given the interesting possibility of decoupling the low energy neutrino physics from the lfv physics in this iss model by the proper choice of the input parameters , we will take into account specific iss scenarios with non - diagonal @xmath18 while keeping diagonal @xmath17 ( case ii ) which can provide the largest lfv higgs decay rates .",
    "once some specific inputs are provided for @xmath15 and @xmath17 , the proper @xmath18 matrix that ensures the agreement between low energy neutrino predictions and data can be easily obtained by solving iss equations , which leads to : @xmath41 with @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "it should be noted that for a generic @xmath15 texture , this @xmath18 will be in general non - diagonal .",
    "therefore , the most relevant input iss parameters in the case ii are @xmath15 and @xmath17 ( in addition to the input parameters that are relevant for low energy neutrino physics , @xmath29 and @xmath44 ) .",
    "in our one - loop computation of the lfv rates we work in the mass basis for all the particles involved , with diagonal charged leptons , and take into account the contributions from all the nine physical neutrinos . as for the gauge choice , we choose the feynman - thooft gauge .",
    "the full set of contributing one - loop diagrams can be found in  @xcite , and we have adapted the complete one - loop formulas for the @xmath45 partial decay width , taken from  @xcite , to the iss case .",
    "we have focused on the decays @xmath46 and have not considered their related @xmath47 conjugate decays @xmath48 which , in the presence of complex phases , could lead to different rates .",
    "all the formulas for the lfvhd have been implemented into our private mathematica code .",
    "for the numerical predictions of the br@xmath49 rates , we use @xmath50 and its corresponding sm total width is computed with feynhiggs  @xcite including two - loop corrections .    in order to ensure the validity of the casas - ibarra parametrization",
    ", we have imposed that the error on the light neutrino masses estimated with it , meaning the differences between the input @xmath37 and the output @xmath51 masses , was below @xmath52 and that the @xmath53 rotation matrix exhibited the required unitarity property .",
    "furthermore , since a given set of input parameters can generate arbitrarily large yukawa couplings , we enforce their perturbativity by setting an upper limit on the entries of the neutrino yukawa coupling matrix , given by @xmath54 for @xmath55 .    at the same time that we analyze the lfvhd",
    ", we also compute the one - loop @xmath56 decay rates within this same iss framework ( using the analytical formulas provided in  @xcite and  @xcite ) and for the same input parameters , and check that these radiative decay rates are compatible with their present experimental @xmath57 cl upper bounds : @xmath58    regarding the higgs total width , we focus on the scenario where the new fermionic singlets have a mass above @xmath59 , thus they do not contribute to new invisible decays . to avoid potential constraints from lepton electric dipole moments , we assume that all mass matrices are real , as well as the pmns matrix .",
    "additional constraints might also arise from lepton universality tests  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in the scenario that we consider where the sterile neutrinos are heavier than the higgs boson , points that would be excluded by lepton universality tests are already excluded by @xmath60 . at the end , we found that the most stringent constraints for our study are by far @xmath60 and the yukawa coupling perturbativity limit of eq .",
    "( [ yuk - pert ] ) .",
    "we study first the lfv rates as functions of the most relevant iss parameters within the case i , trying to localize the areas of the parameter space where the lfvhd can be both large and respect the constraints on the lfv radiative decays .",
    "the results will be presented in two generically different scenarios for the heavy neutrinos : 1 ) the case of ( nearly ) degenerate heavy neutrinos , and 2 ) the case of hierarchical heavy neutrinos .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]",
    "in the line of thinking of increasing @xmath1 and @xmath2 rates , while reducing the predictions of @xmath61 rates , which is the most restrictive constraint together with the yukawa perturbativity , we propose in this section more general scenarios with non - diagonal @xmath18 and diagonal and degenerate @xmath17 . in order to localize the class of scenarios leading to large and allowed lfvhd rates",
    ", we first make a rough estimate of the expected maximal rates for the @xmath2 channel by using our approximate formula of eq .",
    "( [ fithtaumu ] ) which is given just in terms of the neutrino yukawa coupling matrix @xmath15 and @xmath17 .",
    "the most constraining observables in our study are the lfv radiative decays , which limit the maximal value of the non - diagonal @xmath62 entries . by using our approximate formula of eq .",
    "( [ approxformula ] ) and the present bounds in eq .",
    "( [ taumugmax ] ) , we obtain : @xmath63 then , in order to simplify our search , and given the above relative strong suppression of the 12 element , it seems reasonable to neglect it against the other off - diagonal elements . in that case , eq .",
    "( [ fithtaumu ] ) for the @xmath2 decay mode reads as @xmath64 \\right|^2 \\ , .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this equation clearly shows that the maximal br(@xmath65 ) rates are obtained for the maximum allowed values of @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 . by setting the maximum allowed value for @xmath69 to that given in eq .",
    "( [ 23max ] ) and fixing the values of @xmath67 and @xmath68 to their maximum values allowed by eq .",
    "( [ yuk - pert ] ) , @xmath70 we obtain our approximate prediction for the maximal rates : @xmath71 the same procedure can be applied to the @xmath1 channel , leading to similar results on its maximal branching ratios .",
    "these maximal @xmath2 and @xmath1 rates are much more promising than the ones obtained in the previous section under the simple hypothesis of diagonal @xmath18 and @xmath72 since they are closer to the expected lhc sensitivity for these channels ( see for instance  @xcite ) which will be surely improved in the forthcoming runs of the lhc .    assuming this kind of yukawa matrix which gives rise to the maximal br(@xmath2 ) and br(@xmath1 ) , the issue now would be to find the possible @xmath18 matrices that keep the agreement with neutrino data .",
    "this fact will be always possible by means of eq .",
    "( [ muxtexture ] ) and because of the possibility of decoupling the low energy neutrino physics from the lfv physics in the iss model .",
    "this means that , for a given input @xmath15 , eq .  ( [ muxtexture ] )",
    "tells us which @xmath18 keeps the agreement with neutrino data .",
    "we address the reader to our main article  @xcite for more details on this case ii and for some illustrative examples of yukawa textures producing these maximal lfvhd rates .",
    "we have studied the lfvhd within the context of the iss where three additional pairs of massive rh singlet neutrinos are added to the sm particle content .",
    "the most relevant iss parameters have been found to be @xmath17 and @xmath15 .",
    "we have required that the input iss parameters be compatible with the present neutrino data and other constraints , with the perturbativity of the neutrino yukawa couplings and the present upper bounds on the lfv radiative decays being the most restrictive ones .",
    "the largest maximum lfvhd rates are br(@xmath1 ) and br(@xmath2 ) and under the hypothesis of diagonal @xmath18 and @xmath17 they can reach at the most values of @xmath73 for the degenerate heavy neutrino case and @xmath74 for the hierarchical case . going beyond this simple hypothesis , we find more general iss scenarios with non - diagonal @xmath18 in which br(@xmath61 ) is extremely suppressed and br(@xmath1 ) or br(@xmath2 ) are larger while respecting the br(@xmath75 ) and br(@xmath76 ) upper bounds .",
    "these rates reach maximal values of @xmath0 , being very promising for lfvhd searches at the lhc .",
