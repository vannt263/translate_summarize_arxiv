    "with the ocuurence of a new generation of teraflop parallel supercomputers , we will be able to simulate lattice qcd with smaller and smaller statistical errors .",
    "it is now of increased importance to gain control of various kinds of systematic errors which either affect the numerical results directly or affect the way in which physical quantities are extracted .",
    "one of the most important systematic errors comes from the finite lattice spacing @xmath0 which generates errors of the order of @xmath3 . for the present lattice computation",
    ", this corresponds to the corrections of the order of @xmath4 .",
    "another important systematic error comes from the choice of lattice operators .",
    "there exist a variety of lattice operators which approach the same continuum operator in the limit @xmath5 . however , many of these operators differ from the continuum limit at @xmath1 , and a systematic formalism is needed to improve the lattice operators so as to remove these @xmath1 corrections .    for the case of wilson fermions ,",
    "the standard lattice action differs from the continuum quark action by a term of @xmath1 .",
    "so , both the action and the operators need corrections at order @xmath0 . applying the improvement program of symanzik@xcite to wilson fermions , a procedure was proposed in ref.@xcite @xcite to reduce the systematic errors due to the finiteness of the lattice spacing , from terms of @xmath1 to ones of @xmath6 , and it was numerically demonstrated in ref.@xcite that this procedure can reduce the finite @xmath0 corrections from @xmath7 to around @xmath8 .",
    "the meaning of the statement that there is no term of order @xmath0 in the staggered fermion action is not clear .",
    "let us use the free staggered fermion action as an example : @xmath9 + m\\sum_xa^4\\bar{\\chi}(x ) \\chi(x).\\ ] ] following golterman and smit @xcite , we denote the fourier components of the fields @xmath10 and @xmath11 as @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and decompose momentum space as @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , in which @xmath18 .",
    "if we define the fermion fields as @xmath19 where @xmath20 we can write the action as : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the lattice volume . it is clear that there is no order @xmath0 term in the action , hence the free staggered action is accurate to @xmath23 . however , the coordinate fields corresponding to @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) are non - local superpositions of the @xmath10 s ( @xmath11 s ) over all the lattice sites .",
    "on the other hand , if we define the local hypercubic fermion fields as in ref.@xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 then the action in the momentum space can be written as : @xmath28 + m      \\}\\tilde{q}(p).\\ ] ] it is obvious that there are order @xmath0 terms in the action and in the propagator for the fields @xmath29 and @xmath30 . in this case",
    ", we say that the fields @xmath31 and @xmath32 need to be improved .",
    "there exists a set of improved fields @xmath33 where @xmath34,\\ ] ] such that @xmath35 note those improved fields are still local and superior to the nonlocal fields both computationally and theoretically when gauge couplings are included .",
    "so , if we use the improved fields which remove the order @xmath0 terms from the action to construct a lattice fermion operator , there will be no @xmath1 corrections to its free field matrix elements .",
    "for landau gauge , sharpe @xcite proposed the following smeared operator : @xmath36).\\ ] ] it is easy to show that @xmath37    the full staggered fermion action including gauge couplings is much more complicated . in section 2 , we will give a set of improved fermion field variables in terms of which the action has no explicit order @xmath0 terms at tree level . in section 3 , we will expand upon the argument given by sharpe in ref @xcite to prove that there are no @xmath1 terms which can be added to the staggered fermion action .",
    "based on these two arguments , we conclude that staggered fermion action is already accurate to @xmath23 , and that we should use the improved field variables to construct fermion operators to reduce order @xmath0 corrections from their matrix elements .",
    "we apply this program to the case of @xmath38 and @xmath2 as examples",
    ". we will also determine the additional operators that must be added to improve the standard staggered fermion currents to define operators whose matrix elements are accurate to @xmath23 .",
    "we list the lattice symmetry transformation properties of the fermion fields needed in this paper in the appendix a.",
    "working with the even position variable @xmath39 of eq.([y ] ) , the lattice gauge - covariant derivative is defined as follows : @xmath40.\\ ] ] following ref.@xcite , we define the gauge covariant fermion fields as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the average of link products along the shortest paths from @xmath39 to @xmath43 .",
    "the classical continuum limit of action can be written as : @xmath44 \\stackrel{a\\rightarrow0 }      { \\longrightarrow } \\int_y \\sum_{ab } \\bar{\\varphi}_a(y )       \\ { \\sum_{\\mu } \\overline{(\\gamma_\\mu \\otimes i)}_{ab } d_\\mu       + m\\delta_{ab } -a [ \\sum_\\mu \\overline{(\\gamma_5 \\otimes        \\xi_{5\\mu})}_{ab}d^2_\\mu }          \\nonumber \\\\     & & + \\frac{1}{4 } \\sum_{\\mu\\nu}(\\overline{(\\gamma_\\mu-\\gamma_\\nu )         \\otimes i } + \\frac{i}{2}g_0\\overline{\\gamma_5 [ \\gamma_\\mu ,         \\gamma_\\nu ] \\otimes \\xi_5(\\xi_\\mu + \\xi_\\nu)})_{ab }         f_{\\mu\\nu}(y)]\\ } \\varphi_b(y )     \\nonumber \\\\     & & + o(a^2).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the continuum covariant derivative . at first sight ,",
    "the action contains order @xmath0 terms .",
    "likewise , it is clear that the fermion propagator for the hypercubic fields @xmath46 and @xmath47 deviates from the continuum propagator by terms of order @xmath0 . however , if we introduce the following improved field variables @xmath48 and replace @xmath10 , @xmath11 in eq.[cov_field ] by @xmath49 and @xmath50 , then the classical continuum limit of the action can be written as @xmath51 =       \\int_y \\sum_{ab } \\bar{\\varphi}^i_a(y )        [ \\sum_\\mu \\overline{(\\gamma_\\mu \\otimes i)}_{ab } d_\\mu +       m\\delta_{ab } ] \\varphi^i_b(y ) + o(a^2),\\ ] ] we see the feynman rules of the improved fields differ from those of the continuum theory by terms of @xmath23 . in ref.@xcite",
    "it was proven that if the matrix elements of the tree level improved operators differ from the continuum ones only by terms which are of @xmath23 , then in the full theory there are no terms of @xmath1 nor terms of @xmath52 .",
    "we restate their argument here .",
    "since the lowest order correction to the propagator and vertices are of order @xmath53 , a term proportional to @xmath54 from an n - loop diagram can only occur if one of the loop integrals diverges like @xmath55 .",
    "if this is true , there will be at most @xmath56 logarithmically divergent loop integrals which will result in a term of @xmath57 which behaves like @xmath6 as @xmath58 .",
    "so we conclude that there are no terms of @xmath52 , and therefore the matrix elements differ from their continuum ones by terms at most of @xmath6 .    using the new fermion fields",
    ", we can construct improved fermion operators .",
    "for example , the improved fermion bilinears have the following form : @xmath59   \\nonumber    \\\\      & & -\\frac{a}{2}\\sum_\\nu \\bar{\\chi}_a(y )         [ \\overline{(\\gamma_{5\\nu s } \\otimes \\xi_{5\\nu f})}_{ab }          -\\overline{(\\gamma_{s5\\nu } \\otimes \\xi_{f5\\nu})}_{ab } ]         d^l_\\nu \\chi_b(y )     \\nonumber    \\\\     & & + o(a^2).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "in contrast to the calculation of matrix elements , the action is already accurate through order @xmath0 to all orders in @xmath60 , as we will now discuss .",
    "thus physical quantities that depend only on the form of the action ( for example , particle masses determined from correlation functions ) will have no corrections of order @xmath61 .",
    "this can be demonstrated by recognizing that if there were a correction of order @xmath62 , we must necessarily be able to add some dimension-5 operators @xmath63 which must be invariant under the lattice symmetry transformations to cancel this order @xmath62 correction(see ref.@xcite @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "however , following ref.@xcite , we will now prove that there exists no dimension-5 operator ( for the definition of the dimension of lattice operators , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) which is invariant under the lattice symmetry group ( rotations , axis reversal , translations , @xmath64 , charge conjugation ) , and therefore , no order @xmath0 term can be added to the staggered fermion action .    following standard notation ,",
    "we rewrite the staggered fermion action as @xmath65\\chi_c(y')^b               u(y+a , y'+c)^{ab},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath66 @xmath67 in which @xmath68,\\ ] ] @xmath69,\\ ] ] for convenience , we will not write out the @xmath70 links explicitly in the remainder of this section unless there would otherwise be confusion .",
    "given an operator , the reader can write out the full form very easily . for example , starting with the operator @xmath71 we would construct the corresponding gauge invariant operator by the following substitution : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the average of the products of link matrices corresponding to each of the shortest paths from point @xmath43 to @xmath74 .    using the transformation properties of the staggered fermion action ( see appendex a in detail ) , we try to construct all symmetrical dimension-5 operators which have the general form @xmath75 where @xmath76 is a homogenous real polynimial of degree 2 .",
    "invariance under @xmath77 requires that @xmath78 is odd , so only the following combinations of @xmath79 are valid : @xmath80 @xmath81    under reflection with respect to a hyperplane normal to the @xmath82 direction , we have the following transformation : @xmath83 and @xmath84    using the transformation formulae of @xmath85 listed in eq .",
    "(  [ apend:2 ] ) of the appendix , we deduce that axis reversal invariance and @xmath77 invariance allow only the following terms : @xmath86 @xmath87 @xmath88 \\otimes \\xi_5(\\xi_\\mu +          \\xi_\\nu ) [ d_\\mu , d_\\nu],\\ ] ] @xmath89 \\otimes \\xi_5(\\xi_\\mu -          \\xi_\\nu ) \\{d_\\mu , d_\\nu\\}.\\ ] ] where @xmath90 can be replaced by @xmath91 without affecting these operators up to order @xmath53 .    under a rotation around the center of a hypercube , we have the following : @xmath92    combining the transformation properties listed in eq .",
    "(  [ apend:3 ] ) of the appendix , the rotational invariance will further eliminate the term in eq.([term:1 ] ) but allows the remaining three terms eq.([term:2 ] - [ term:4 ] ) .",
    "finally , let s discuss invariances under translation by one lattice unit : @xmath93 where @xmath94 \\right .",

    "so , we conclude that there is no dimension-5 fermion operator which is invariant under the lattice symmetry group , and therefore no dimension-5 operator can be added to the staggered fermion action .",
    "as we argued above , actual numerical simulation should use the improved fermion field variables .",
    "however , in most situations , we can use the improvement program proposed in this paper to remove the @xmath1 corrections without increasing the computational work . here",
    ", we apply this program to the calculation of the matrix element @xmath38 which gives @xmath96 in the continuum , and the calculation of @xmath2 .",
    "we will show that the former differs from its continuum counterpart by @xmath97 , but @xmath2 has no @xmath1 corrections .",
    "we also apply the improvement program to the matrix elements of lattice currents .",
    "the axial current used in the ( landau gauge ) numerical simulation is : @xmath98 from the continuum expression @xmath99 we define , on the lattice , @xmath100 and put the wall source that creates the @xmath101 on the time slice at @xmath102 .",
    "then we will have @xmath103 where @xmath104    if we do nt consider @xmath105 terms , we can take only the term @xmath106\\ ] ] in eq .",
    "(  [ improved_bilinear ] ) because other terms contribute zero `` flavor '' trace at the tree level .",
    "so , we have @xmath107 and @xmath108 so , we get @xmath109    the numerical data ( from the full qcd simulation on a @xmath110 lattice with the cubic wall source , at the quark mass @xmath111 , see ref.@xcite ) for the unimproved and improved matrix elements are shown in figure [ fig.1 ] ,    from which we see that @xmath112 and @xmath113 is much smaller .    from this simple example",
    ", we can see that if we do not consider @xmath114 corrections , the improved operator is eqivalent to the extrapolation : @xmath115      the formula for calculating @xmath2 is : @xmath116 where @xmath117 the improved numerator is ( omitting the @xmath6 terms ) : @xmath118 since @xmath119 is a plateau ( i.e. time independent ) within the statistical error , there is no @xmath1 corrections to the numerator .",
    "since @xmath120 the denominator @xmath121 also has no @xmath1 corrections even if no attention is paid to an accurate definition of @xmath96 .",
    "hence , we showed that there is neither @xmath1 nor @xmath122 corrections to @xmath2 .",
    "sharpe @xcite has examined this question in greater detail and argued that in fact there are no corrections of @xmath123 also . however ,",
    "if we calculated the denominator only in one time direction and took the square of @xmath124 ( or @xmath125 ) , there would be an error of order of @xmath97 .",
    "the lattice currents can be written as @xmath126 and according to ref@xcite , their renormalized continuum forms can be written as @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the usual ( divergent ) renormaliation constant and @xmath129 is a finite lattice renormalization constant . using the method developed in this paper",
    ", we can explicitly determine the improved currents accurate to @xmath23 .",
    "for example , the conserved vector current and axial vector current corresponding to the @xmath130 lattice symmetry can be written as follows : @xmath131   \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\qquad              -\\frac{a}{2}\\partial_\\mu               [ \\bar{\\chi}_a ( \\overline{\\gamma_\\mu \\otimes              i})_{ab } \\chi_b ]   \\nonumber \\\\",

    "the third term whose effect is to shift in the @xmath133 s direction occurs here because the currents are non - local operators which involve an overlap between two nearest hypercubes .",
    "the forth term is a mixing of a different spin - flavor operator and is necessary to remove all order @xmath0 effects from a general matrix element .",
    "in this paper , based on the demonstration of that there is no dimension-5 fermion operator which is invariant under all lattice symmetry transformations and that there exists a set of improved fermion fields with respect to which the tree - level action has no order @xmath0 terms , we concluded that the staggered fermion action is already in fact improved to @xmath23 .",
    "we argued that to remove order @xmath0 corrections from the matrix elements , the first step is to use the proposed improved fermion field variables to construct fermion operators so that they differ from the continuum ones by order of @xmath53 at the tree level .",
    "then we showed that to all orders of perturbation theory treating @xmath134 , the correction is at most of @xmath6 .",
    "furthermore , for the on - shell quantities , they are accurate to @xmath23 .",
    "we applied our program to the matrix element @xmath38 and found that the unimproved one differs from the continuum by a factor of @xmath97 . at the same time",
