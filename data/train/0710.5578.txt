    "broad iron lines observed from many black hole systems most likely originate from the innermost regions of an accretion disc and their profiles are shaped by gravitational redshift and doppler shifts .",
    "modelling of the lines observed in several objects requires strongly enhanced fluorescent emission from a few gravitational radii ( e.g. , wilms et al .",

    "; see review in reynolds & nowak 2003 ) , which in turn indicates that a primary source of hard x - ray emission must also be located close to the black hole .",
    "thus , both the primary and reflected emission should be subject to strong gravity effects .",
    "these effects are also tentatively considered as an explanation of the complex variability pattern characterising radiation reflected from disc , including the iron line , and the primary hard x - ray continuum emission .",
    "namely , weak variability of the reflected component , uncorrelated with the variability of the primary emission , has been reported in a number of sources ( e.g. , vaughan & fabian 2004 ; see review in fabian & miniutti 2005 ) .",
    "this is contrary to expectations from a simple geometrical model of a hard x - ray source located close to the reflecting disc , where a strict correlation between variations of the primary and reflected emission should be observed .",
    "fabian & vaughan ( 2003 )  first argued that such a reduced variability may be explained by relativistic effects , in particular by light bending and focusing the primary emission towards the accretion disc .",
    "qualitatively , variations of the reflected emission should be much weaker as changes of the height of the x - ray source cause variations of its observed luminosity at infinity , while changes of the flux received by the disc ( enhanced by the gravitational focusing ; e.g. , matt et al .  1992 ; martocchia & matt 1996 ; petrucci & henri 1997 ) are much weaker . however , for a static primary source located on the symmetry axis , the illuminating radiation is focused into the innermost part of the disc and the reflected emission is subject to similar light bending as the primary . as a result ,",
    "similar variability characterises the primary and reflected emission , at least for observers with low inclination angles .",
    "miniutti et al .  ( 2003 ) and miniutti & fabian ( 2004 ) have developed further this model to include rotation of the primary source around the axis and the resulting beaming of its emission toward outer regions of the disc .",
    "then , variations of the reflected emission are reduced because of the more extended region it is produced . predictions of their model are found to be consistent with observations of black - hole systems , e.g.  by miniutti et al .  (",
    "2003 ) , miniutti , fabian & miller ( 2004 ) , fabian et al .",
    "however , a number of important effects were not systematically studied . in particular , a specific pattern of motion of a primary source is assumed ( including both location relative to the symmetry axis and azimuthal motion ) but it is not discussed how strongly the resulting properties depend on these assumptions .",
    "for example , corotation of the primary source with the disc is assumed by miniutti & fabian ( 2004 ) , which is likely close to the disc surface , but at most approximate at high latitudes . as the azimuthal motion of the primary source relative to the disc may affect significantly the reflected emission ( see e.g.  reynolds & fabian 1997 ) ,",
    "it is not clear whether predictions of this model are specific to the underlying assumptions or generic to models involving the light bending .    in this paper",
    "we systematically analyse the light bending model , concentrating on strong gravity effects .",
    "we neglect some other effects which may contribute to the original variability problem , for example , ionization of the disc surface ( nayakshin & kazanas 2002 ) .",
    "we focus here on the iron k@xmath0 line ; an analysis of reflected emission including the compton reflected radiation will be presented in our next paper .",
    "we study in details a number of geometrical scenarios of the source location and motion .",
    "we point out certain inadequacies in the original computations of miniutti & fabian ( 2004 ) , and how they influence their quantitative results .",
    "we find also a novel scenario in which reduction of the line variability follows directly from properties of photon transfer in the kerr metric .",
    "namely , we find that a source located close to the disc surface , with a varying radial distance from a kerr black hole , gives rise to both an approximately constant illumination of the surrounding disc and a very strong variability of the primary emission observed at infinity . some aspects of variability in similar models have been considered recently e.g.  by czerny et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and pechcek et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , however , these studies considered only emission emerging locally from the region under the source . on the other hand , we find that transfer of primary emission to more distant regions of the disc is crucial for variability effects in such a model .",
    "we concentrate on low inclination objects , with application to seyfert 1 galaxies in mind . obviously , the doppler shifts are more pronounced at high inclinations , but observational studies of high inclination objects are less advanced , either because they are obscured ( as seyfert 2 galaxies ) , or because the studies on dynamical time scale are not possible ( as in stellar mass black hole systems ) .",
    "furthermore , we consider only emission averaged over at least an orbital period .",
    "effects resulting from varying azimuthal location of an off - axis source , with respect to observer , are studied , e.g. , in ruszkowski ( 2000 ) , yu & lu ( 2000 ) and goyder & lasenby ( 2004 ) .    in section 3",
    "we analyse various physical effects relevant to formation of relativistic line profiles and variability effects ; in section 4 we apply our results to a seyfert 1 galaxy mcg6 - 30 - 15 which is the best studied object with clear signatures of strong gravity effects .",
    "we consider an accretion disc , surrounding a kerr black hole , irradiated by x - rays emitted from an isotropic point source ( hereafter referred to as the source of primary emission ) .",
    "the black hole is characterised by its mass , @xmath1 , and angular momentum , @xmath2 .",
    "we use the boyer - lindquist ( bl ) coordinate system @xmath3 .",
    "we also make use of locally non - rotating ( lnr ) frames ( bardeen , press & teukolsky 1972 ) , which are particularly convenient for studying processes in the kerr geometry ( in the schwarzschild metric the lnr frame is equivalent to the rest frame of a local static observer ) .",

    "a large number of photons are generated from the primary source with isotropic distribution of initial directions in the source rest frame .",

    "we take into account effects due to reflected photons which return to the disc giving rise to fluorescence ( section [ sec : bend ] ) .",
    "furthermore , in section [ sec : ew ] we take into account the compton reflected component for computing the equivalent width of the fe line .",
    "we study properties of the iron line , in particular effects related to azimuthal motion and returning radiation , for two extreme locations of the primary source , represented by models @xmath45 and @xmath46 , defined below , with the source located close to the symmetry axis and close to disc surface , respectively . in these models , location of the primary source is given by its bl coordinates , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "we illustrate effects resulting from varying distance of the source by changing @xmath47 at constant @xmath49 , which seems appropriate for the innermost part of the flow ( e.g.  numerical simulations typically show conical coronae or outflows rather than plane parallel structures ) .",
    "we consider also a recently popular variability model with position of the primary source parametrised by @xmath50 , defined as model @xmath51 below , in which the polar position of the source covers the whole range of values of @xmath49 .",
    "specifically , model @xmath51 is equivalent to model @xmath46 for small @xmath52 and to model @xmath45 for high @xmath52 .      in model @xmath45 we consider a primary source located close to the axis .",
    "all model @xmath45 spectra in this paper correspond to @xmath53 rad .",
    "our model @xmath45 with @xmath22 is virtually equivalent to models with on - axis source , e.g.  matt et al .",

    "our assumption of location being slightly displaced from the axis allows us to study the impact of azimuthal motion in the polar region .",
    "in model @xmath46 we consider a source located close to the disc surface .",
    "all model @xmath46 spectra shown in this paper correspond to @xmath55 rad , i.e.  @xmath56 .",
    "we discuss the dependence of model @xmath46 on @xmath21 , but in section [ sec : mcg ] we focus on a scenario with the primary source rigidly coupled to the underlying disc and corotating with keplerian velocity , @xmath57 .",
    "this specific case is denoted as model @xmath54 .",
    "for @xmath7 we consider only @xmath58 .",
    "all variability effects in this model are studied for varying distance , @xmath47 , and a constant polar angle @xmath49 .",
    "we also introduce another model , @xmath13 , for a non - rotating black hole , @xmath8 , but assuming a quasi - keplerian velocity of accreting matter in the plunging region below @xmath10 : @xmath59 and @xmath60 ( instead of the usual free fall assumption ) .",
    "such a velocity field is very similar to the velocity field of an accretion disc around an @xmath7 black hole , in the region @xmath61 ( where @xmath62 ; @xmath63 increases from @xmath64 at @xmath65 to @xmath66 at @xmath67 ) .",
    "this model can thus serve as a comparison model to study effects specific to space - time around rapidly rotating black hole , which are significant for @xmath68 .",
    "we emphasise that we do not consider this as a likely scenario , we are not aware of any results supporting such a rotating flow within @xmath10 [ although e.g.   agol & krolik ( 2002 ) argue that distant regions of the flow may be linked through magnetic tension , which presumably could affect motion of the flow in the plunging region ] .",
    "we consider model @xmath13 only to separate effects due to gravitational energy shift and bending of trajectories from kinematic effects .",
    "following miniutti & fabian ( 2004 ) we consider a model with a cylindrical - like motion of the primary source , referred to as model @xmath51 , with the source located at constant projected radial distance @xmath69 and changing the height , @xmath70 , above the disc surface .",
    "furthermore , model @xmath51 assumes that at each @xmath52 the source has the same angular velocity , equal to the keplerian velocity at @xmath71 , @xmath72 .",
    "this yields the following velocity of the source rest frame relative to the lnr frame ( bardeen et al .  1972 )",
    "@xmath73 all spectra for model @xmath51 shown in this paper are for @xmath74 .",
    "note that equation ( [ v ] ) yields , for constant angular velocity , a peculiar dependence of @xmath21 on source location .",
    "namely , @xmath21 increases with increasing @xmath52 at small heights , achieves a maximum value at @xmath75 and then decreases .",
    "e.g.  for @xmath76 : @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "these changes of @xmath21 , with @xmath70 , appear to be crucial for properties of model @xmath51 . to illustrate impact of kinematic assumptions , we show in section [ sec : var ] variability in a model with primary source changing @xmath52 at constant @xmath71 , as in model @xmath51 , but with constant angular _ momentum _ equal to angular momentum on a keplerian orbit in the equatorial plane at @xmath71 , @xmath80 [ yielding @xmath81 .",
    "suebsewong et al .  ( 2006 ) study effects of changing @xmath71 at constant @xmath52 , keeping parametrisation of the source motion introduced by miniutti & fabian ( 2004 ) .",
    "again , we note that for small @xmath52 , which are most relevant for such scenario , the assumed pattern of motion yields velocity field strongly affecting the derived properties .",
    "e.g. , for @xmath82 , @xmath83 for @xmath84 , i.e.  achieves values much larger than those of a keplerian motion in the equatorial plane .",
    "furthermore , results of both miniutti & fabian ( 2004 ) and suebsewong et al .",
    "( 2006 ) for large @xmath85 or @xmath52 are strongly affected by the assumed value of @xmath86 , see section [ sec : var : c ] .      in all models",
    "we assume that the primary emission has a power - law spectrum , with a photon spectral index @xmath87 , and an exponential cut - off at @xmath88 kev [ this cut - off energy is ( marginally ) relevant for the fluorescent line only due to effect of returning radiation ] .",
    "units for spectra , presented in section 3 , are arbitrary but all have the same normalisation , with intrinsic luminosity , @xmath89 , yielding the energy flux of primary emission , per unit solid angle in the rest frame of the source , @xmath90 , normalised to unity at 1 kev .",
    "assumption of constant intrinsic luminosity is released in two cases : ( i ) in model @xmath91 which adopts kinematic assumption of model @xmath54 , but assumes intrinsic luminosity changing with @xmath47 according to dissipation rate per unit area in a keplerian disc ( page & thorne 1974 ) ; ( ii ) in models @xmath92 ,",

    "we present spectra averaged over azimuthal angle .",
    "although in models defined above the axial symmetry is broken , the orbital periods are much shorter ( with one exception , see below ) than the timescale , 10 ks , over which variability properties are investigated in the highest quality data .",
    "note that , for high @xmath96 , azimuthal averaging is justified also for a source with @xmath22 , which rotates with respect to a distant observer with angular velocity @xmath97 , comparable to @xmath98 at small @xmath99 , e.g.  @xmath100 at @xmath101 .    for a black hole with",
    "@xmath102 the orbital period exceeds 10 ks in model @xmath54 with @xmath103 .",

    "2004b ) in a model equivalent to our @xmath54 with large @xmath47 .",
    "note , however , that this range of parameters is not relevant to effects considered in our paper . in particular , gr effects are weak and effects of black hole rotation are completely negligible for such distances .",
    "we analyse variability effects averaged over an orbital period for such large @xmath47 for potential applicability to lower mass systems .    finally , we ignore time delays between the primary and reprocessed radiation , related to light - travel times between the source and various parts of the disc . for a central source illuminating the ring of radius @xmath104 , these delay times are between @xmath105 and @xmath106 . for @xmath107 ,",
    "the minimum and maximum delay is @xmath108 s and @xmath109 s , respectively .",
    "then , for @xmath102 and @xmath110 , the delays exceed typical times , @xmath111 ks , for high quality spectra .",
    "we emphasise that in most cases these delays are not important to variability effects studied here , regardless of the value of @xmath1 , as the major part of reprocessed radiation originates from @xmath112 and the fraction of fe photons coming from @xmath113 is smaller than 1 per cent . significant irradiation of disc at @xmath114 occurs only for @xmath115 in model @xmath51 . in this case",
    "the delays may affect variability for large @xmath1 , we discuss this issue further in section [ sec : var : c ] .",

    "then , reduction of observed variability requires enhanced illumination of disc beyond a few @xmath152 , which can be achieved in the kerr metric for small @xmath47 as a result of bending _ toward the equatorial plane_. interestingly , the same mechanism reduces variations of the line for a source at small heights at the axis , through the effect of returning radiation , as this radiation illuminates the disc at distances larger than the source height .",

    "the reflected component is correlated with the primary power - law at low flux values and becomes more constant at higher fluxes ( fabian et al .",

    "( iii ) change of the distance , within @xmath471 , gives rise to a decline in the rms spectrum at 6.5 kev .",
    "( iv ) primary emission from a source located at @xmath467 produces a strongly reflection dominated spectrum , consistent with that observed in the lowest flux states ; moreover , the line profile for such location is similar to the average profile for larger @xmath206 .",
    "( v ) rather significant changes of the line profile occur when the distance of a single source changes at @xmath472 ; the resulting , systematic residuals in the difference spectra are , however , relatively small ( @xmath473 per cent level ) and the model reproduces reasonably well a power - law like difference spectrum .",
    "some details of the model , e.g.  modelling of the blue peak or the ew value , depend on the angular emission law .",
    "note that model @xmath54 , with some modifications , could explain a smoothed red wing even without superposition , i.e.  for a single source at @xmath474 .",
    "moreover , such model could account for small changes of the line profile corresponding to the change of @xmath47 .",
    "namely , photons forming the variable , bumpy part of the red wing may be depleted due to ionization of the disc surface , neglected in this paper .",
    "qualitatively , the strongest ionization should occur under the source , where the photons forming the redshifted horns originate .",
    "we emphasise that if future observations confirm that the line profile remains strictly unchanged at any flux level , applicability of model @xmath46 would indeed require strong reduction of fluorescent emission from the region under the source , involving ionization of that region .",
    "another possibility to suppress the bumps in the red wing involves generation of x - rays at a slightly larger @xmath52 , for which a more extended area under the source is illuminated and the wing does not posses a pronounced feature , compare figs .  [",
    "fig : f7](e ) and [ fig : f7](f ) .",
    "our model @xmath91 represents most closely a model with flares occurring randomly at various distances . in a realistic scenario ,",
    "the x - rays would be always generated by flares distributed over a range of @xmath47 and the observed fe profile would correspond to the superposition of profiles for a single @xmath47 .",
    "variability effects would then result from changes of the distance of the strongest activity .",
    "these changes of @xmath47 giving the dominating contribution should result in changes of the line profile described above .",
    "we note , however , a caveat for the model with flares .",
    "namely , the model involving compact sources corotating with the disc predicts quasi - periodic modulation of the primary emission because of doppler effect as the source circles around the centre ( see ycki & niedwiecki 2005 ) . this signal would appear on the keplerian time scale , which is shorter than time scales considered in this paper",
    "however , such a signal is not observed in the _ xmm - newton _ data from mcg6 - 30 - 15 ( vaughan , fabian & nandra 2003 ) .",
    "this may imply a continuous spacial distribution of the hard x - ray source , e.g.  an extended corona covering the disc surface or a small hot torus replacing the disc , in both cases within a few innermost @xmath152 ( as needed for the variability effects ) .",
    "we have extended the model , formulated by miniutti & fabian ( 2004 ) , relating reduced variability of the reflected emission to changing magnitude of relativistic effects as location of the primary x - ray source changes .",
    "we find that original computations of miniutti & fabian ( 2004 ) - for a model involving a vertically moving source - overestimate the reduction effect by assuming a value of the outer radius of the disc which is too small for the range of the source heights considered in that model .",
    "on the other hand , we find a significant reduction of the variability of reflected emission in a model with a rapidly rotating black hole and a source moving radially , low above the disc surface .",
    "the reduced variability occurs then for the innermost range of radial distances , @xmath475 .",
    "we find also that - only in this range of parameters - the gr effects give rise to a significant decline around 6.5 kev in rms spectra .",
    "note that generation of strong x - ray emission at these distances ( @xmath476 ) is consistent with the condition of a high value of @xmath96 , as - for a rapidly rotating black hole - most accretion power is dissipated within a few innermost @xmath152 .",
    "determination of the value of black hole spin or , even more fundamentally , verification of effects predicted by the kerr metric solution of gr equations - remains a major issue of black hole astrophysics . in this context",
    ", several effects are taken into account for x - ray spectroscopy .",
    "strong redshift of photons forming the observed red wings , at @xmath477 kev , is considered as evidence of rapid rotation of a black hole ( e.g. , brenneman & reynolds 2006 ) .",
    "however , similar redshift can be obtained for @xmath8 if emission from @xmath478 is taken into account ( reynolds & begelman 1997 ) .",
    "then , the derived high value of @xmath96 relies on assumption of no neutral iron emission from within the radius of marginal stability .",
    "response of the line to increase of primary emission has been suggested for future studies . in particular , reynolds et al .",
    "( 1999 ) indicate a bump occurring in the line profile and progressing to lower energies , with proceeding time , as a feature characteristic for a rapidly rotating black hole .",
    "again , a similar - redshifted and shapiro delayed - bump should appear for a non - rotating black hole if fluorescence inside @xmath10 was taken into account .",
    "a straightforward analysis of the space - time metric could be performed for systems observed close to edge - on , for which effects due to lensing by a black hole would be directly seen in the line profile ( e.g. , zakharov & repin 2003 ) . however , as noted in narayan & mcclintock ( 2005 ) , there seems to be a selection effect preventing such systems from being observed .",
    "then , we point out that a ( largely unambiguous ) analysis of imprints of the space - time metric would be possible in profile of the line resulting from irradiation by a strong flare just above the disc surface . if such a flare occurred at @xmath224 , properties of the space - time related with the black hole rotation would result in @xmath181 per cent in magnitude effects in the line profile .",
    "the effects related to the value of @xmath96 are rather subtle but in principle possible to establish observationally . a compact flare dominating total emission",
    "would be required to make such an analysis feasible and viability of such scenario is uncertain .",
    "such flares are indeed occasionally observed ( e.g. , ponti et al .",
    "interestingly , however , the fe k@xmath0 line was actually very weak during the flare analysed by ponti et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , and a strong line appeared in the spectrum with significant time delay after the flare .",
    "finally , we emphasise that the reduced variability of reflected component - basing on mechanism advocated in this paper - is itself a direct manifestation of the nature of the kerr space - time .",
    "note that another effect resulting from properties of the kerr metric , namely anisotropic emission of hard x - rays generated close to a rotating black hole , is qualitatively consistent with inclination - angle dependence of intrinsic spectra of seyfert galaxies ( niedwiecki 2005 ) . in support for the tentative relation of these two effects to properties of the kerr metric ,",
    "note also that comparison of the total mass in black holes in the local universe with the total luminosity produced by active galactic nuclei indicates that most supermassive black holes should rotate rapidly , e.g.   elvis , risaliti & zamorani ( 2002 ) .      as discussed above , detection of photons with @xmath479 kev",
    "is considered as the evidence of rapid rotation of the black hole .",
    "such strongly redshifted photons were revealed in the fe line profiles observed in mcg6 - 30 - 15 and several other objects ( e.g. , miller et al .  2004 , miniutti et al .  2004 ) . when fitted by models assuming a power - law radial emissivity , the observed profiles require @xmath360 within @xmath480 . considering physical scenarios for generation of such profiles",
    ", we find that they ( i ) can be produced as a result of illumination by a hard x - ray source located close to a black hole ( preferably at @xmath4813 ) and rather close to the disc surface ( @xmath482 ) ; ( ii ) can not be explained by models involving a source at a height of several @xmath152 , or higher , close to the axis ; if they are to come from a disc , with small inclination , surrounding a rotating black hole . regarding ( ii ) we find , in agreement with previous studies , that such location of the source yields a steep @xmath122 , with @xmath483 , in the innermost part of the disc .",
    "however , this steep @xmath122 occurs only within @xmath484 ( and due to gravitational blueshift rather than light bending ) .",
    "the majority of emission from this region of the disc is either captured or bent toward the disc plane ; moreover , the observed photons are strongly redshifted . as a result",
    ", this emission gives only a minor contribution to the line profile and it is not relevant to the shape and strength of the observed red wings .",
    "this conclusion is not affected by effects related with azimuthal motion of the source , returning radiation or angular emission law of fluorescence ; these effects influence mostly the strength of the blue peak . on the other hand ,",
    "the red wing is primarily related with position of the x - ray source .      a further challenge for modelling certain line profiles results from illumination of the surrounding disc ( i.e. beyond a few @xmath152 ) by returning radiation .",
    "we find that this effect may be strong for the range of parameters ( small @xmath47 and @xmath21 ) previously not explored . a similarly strong enhancement of compton reflection by returning radiation , for very small distances ( @xmath153 ) of primary source ,",
    "was noted recently by suebsewong et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .",
    "another effect , related to bending of photon trajectories to the disc plane , affects models relating the fe radial profile to some physical processes .",
    "these models typically assume that the radial profile of fe emission is the same as some physically motivated profile of energy dissipation .",
    "e.g. , reynolds et al .",
    "( 2004 ) make such assumption in their analysis of the _ xmm _ observation of mcg6 - 30 - 15 , applying model of the torqued - disc emission ( where emission results mostly from extraction of rotational energy of the black hole and thus is very centrally concentrated ) .",
    "moreover , they assume that there is no dissipation , and thus no reprocessing , beyond rather small ( several @xmath152 ) outer radius .",
    "we emphasise that even for x - rays generated very low above the disc surface , a significant illumination of more distant regions of the disc should occur .    both the returning radiation and the non - locality of irradiation result primarily in enhancement of the blue peak of the line .",
    "impact of strong gravity is usually studied under specific assumptions on the x - ray source motion .",
    "typically , angular velocity of the source is related to that of the disc ( e.g. ruszkowski 2000 ; miniutti & fabian 2004 ) , while dabrowski & lasenby ( 2001 ) assume a static primary source .",
    "we note that change of @xmath21 significantly affects flux and profile of the iron line through combination of sr and gr effects .",
    "moreover , the kerr metric terms yield a non - trivial dependence between @xmath21 and @xmath485 ( equation ( [ v ] ) ) .",
    "then , the assumed parametrisation of motion may be crucial for derived properties , e.g.  in some variability models .",
    "obviously , additional effects may result from relativistic vertical or radial motion of the source ( e.g.  yu & lu 2001 ) , which were neglected in this paper .",
    "we focused above on mcg6 - 30 - 15 , for which several observed properties may be explained by our model .",
    "similar effects , including reduced variability of reflection , pronounced red wings or strongly reflection dominated spectra , have been revealed in some narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies ( e.g. fabian et al .",
    "2004 , ponti et al .",
    "2006 ) , as well as in stellar mass black - hole systems ( e.g.  miniutti et al.2004 ) and in galactic nuclei with much higher black hole masses ( fabian et al .",
    "note that our scenario implies that the x - ray luminosity is underestimated by an order of magnitude . in these objects .",
    "on the other hand , most black - hole systems do not show signatures of such extreme effects .",
    "then , similar reduction of the x - ray flux does not necessarily characterise any low inclination system .",
    "note , however that such property would be inevitable for rapidly rotating black holes , where major fraction of accretion power is dissipated at very small @xmath47 , if this power is converted into hard x - rays in situ .    as in",
    "virtually all previous studies of that subject , we analysed impact of gr effects for the simplest case of an isotropic point source of hard x - ray emission , which approach follows from our lack of understanding of the x - ray source nature .",
    "the derived properties result from transfer of radiation from source to disc and observer and from disc to observer .",
    "additional ( but smaller in magnitude ) effects may occur in more realistic models .",
    "e.g. , comptonization close to a kerr black hole gives rise to anisotropic emission , cf .",
    "niedwiecki ( 2005 ) , therefore radiation with different spectral index may irradiate various parts of the disc , while the transfer effects affect only normalisation and cut - off energy of the primary emission .",
    "the simplified description of x - ray source considered in this paper approximates most closely scenario with magnetic flares above the disc surface .",
    "then , our results may be directly applicable to a model with flares occurring randomly at various radial distances . qualitatively",
    ", we may assess similar variability effects for continuous spacial distributions of the hard x - ray source , e.g.  an extended corona covering the disc surface or a small hot torus replacing the disc within a few innermost @xmath152 .",
    "varying size of such an extended , hot plasma , in the kerr metric , should give rise reduced variability of reflected component . in particular , a decline of direct emission from a shrinking corona or torus would be observed , even if its intrinsic luminosity remained unchanged , while increasing fraction of its emission would be bent to the disc plane giving rise to strong reflection component .    the major shortcoming in our study results from the neglect of ionization effects .",
    "the strongest ionization should occur below the source , especially in models with low height above the disc surface . in general , strong ionization of this region should suppress the redshifted doppler horns formed in the red - wing .",
    "on the one hand , this would make studies of effects related to value of @xmath96 less feasible . on the other hand ,",
    "such depletion of the variable contribution to the red wing would reduce variations of the line profile at various flux states .",
    "however , details of ionization structure , and of the related reduction of the variable contribution to the lien , depend on additional assumptions , in particular , on azimuthal distribution of flares . obviously , a strong single flare would give rise to stronger ionization than many weak flares uniformly distributed at a given @xmath47 .      if attributed to strong - gravity effects , both the time - averaged line profile and the variability pattern",
    "observed in mcg6 - 30 - 15 by _ xmm - newton _ independently indicate that a primary hard x - ray source must be located very close ( @xmath486 ) to a black hole , i.e.  in the region where kerr metric effects become crucial",
