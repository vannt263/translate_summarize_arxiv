    "the basis of the radiative return method , proposed in @xcite , is an observation that one can extract the hadronic cross section ( @xmath1 ) from the measurement of the cross section of the reaction @xmath2 , where the photons are emitted from the initial leptons .",
    "this is possible due to the factorization @xmath3 , where the function @xmath4 is fully calculable within qed and @xmath5 is the invariant mass of the hadronic system .",
    "the radiative return method has been used by meson factories daphne , babar and belle and allows for the measurement of the hadronic cross section from the nominal energy of these experiments down to the production threshold .",
    "the traditional way of measuring of the hadronic cross section via the energy scan needs dedicated experiments , while using the radiative return one can profit from the existing meson factories . the smaller cross section of the radiative process ( by a factor of @xmath6 as compared to the process without photons emission ) has to be compensated by higher luminosities of factories .    to obtain the hadronic cross section using the radiative return method in a realistic experimental situation",
    ", one needs a monte carlo event generator of the measured process . to provide such a tool to the experimental groups phokhara event generator was constructed .",
    "the construction of the phokhara event generator started from the eva @xcite generator , where structure function method was used to model multi - photon emission .",
    "the physical accuracy of the program was however far from the demanding experimental accuracy . to meet this ever growing demands ,",
    "the event generator phokhara @xcite was constructed .",
    "it is based on the complete calculation of radiative corrections to the next - to - leading order for the isr emission and relevant next - to - leading order corrections to the final state emission . in this paper",
    "the latest updates of the four - pion channels @xcite are briefly outlined ( section 2 ) and preliminary results for the narrow resonances implementation are presented ( section 3 ) .",
    "the four - pion production in @xmath9 annihilation was implemented in the generator eva @xcite a long time ago and recently it was reanalyzed in @xcite .",
    "there are altogether four different channels accessible for 4@xmath10 production :    @xmath11    @xmath12 ( a ) ,    @xmath13 ( b ) ,    @xmath14 .",
    "assuming isospin symmetry , the amplitudes of either ( a ) @xcite or ( b ) @xcite are sufficient to determine all four amplitudes .    in eva and phokhara a choice of @xcite was adopted and a function @xmath15 ( symmetric under the interchange of @xmath16 and @xmath17 and antisymmetric under the interchange of @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) is used to model the two @xmath9 four pion channels : @xmath20 the other matrix elements : @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 can be expressed as sum of @xmath24 functions with permuted arguments @xcite .    for @xmath9 annihilation",
    "the current @xmath15 contains the complete information about the hadronic cross section through @xmath25 where @xmath26 .",
    "similarly for @xmath0 decay we have @xmath27 where @xmath28 can obtained from the differential @xmath0 decay rates .    from the isospin relations between the matrix elements of the four pion hadronic",
    "current one obtains the relations between @xmath0 decay rates and @xmath9 annihilation cross sections @xmath29    they allow for direct tests of the isospin symmetry provided all @xmath30 functions were measured .",
