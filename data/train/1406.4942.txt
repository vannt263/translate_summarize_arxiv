    "the most accurate distance measurements are used in gravitational wave detectors , where advances in accuracy provide an entirely new way of observing the universe @xcite .",
    "quantum mechanics imposes limits on the possible accuracy , but by taking advantage of the exotic features of quantum mechanics it is possible to obtain far better accuracy than would otherwise be possible @xcite .    in particular , in optical interferometers one could use an effectively classical approach , where the photons are independent of each other .",
    "using @xmath0 independent photons , the phase uncertainty scales as @xmath1  a scaling known as the standard quantum limit ( sql ) .",
    "the sql can be beaten using nonclassical states where the photons are correlated ; for example by using squeezed states @xcite or two - mode entangled states @xcite .",
    "this leads to an ultimate limit of @xmath2 for the phase uncertainty , often called the heisenberg limit @xcite .",
    "one particular type of nonclassical state that has been widely considered is the noon state @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "these states give heisenberg scaling for the phase uncertainty , in the sense that they give phase information on a scale of @xmath2 .",
    "however , the phase information obtained is highly ambiguous , and additional phase information is needed to resolve this ambiguity .",
    "this can be achieved , for example , by using sequences of noon states with different values of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "noon states are also highly sensitive to photon loss @xcite ; loss of even one photon destroys all phase information . on the other hand ,",
    "combining single photon states with low - photon - number noon states can beat the sql in the presence of loss @xcite .",
    "more generally , one can consider states that are optimized to be robust to photon loss @xcite . nevertheless , even using optimized states , when there is photon loss the lower limit to the phase uncertainty is just a constant factor improvement over the sql in the limit of large @xmath0 @xcite .    in considering optimized states for two - mode interferometry",
    ", they can be taken to be of the form @xmath4 .",
    "the total photon number can be taken to be a single value @xmath0 ; there is no advantage to using a superposition over different total photon numbers , because the detection process will destroy any such superposition . in the case of noon states , one has only two nonzero values of @xmath5 , whereas general optimized states would , in general , require all values of @xmath5 to be nonzero .",
    "this raises a challenging state engineering problem @xcite .",
    "such a general state could , for example , be produced by using @xmath0 independent single photons @xcite .    however , the standard method to produce single photons is to use down - conversion , and post - select on detection of a single photon to obtain a single photon in the other output .",
    "this means that such a scheme would be very wasteful , because @xmath6 photons would need to be produced to obtain a state with @xmath0 photons .",
    "here we consider the question of the types of states that can be produced by using all photons output by the down - conversion .",
    "our two - photon states are similar to the states proposed in @xcite , but the scheme proposed here is also able to produce states with larger numbers of photons .",
    "moreover , we consider how to use sequences of such states with different total numbers of photons in order to obtain unambiguous phase estimates , in much the same way as has been done for noon states @xcite .",
    "we start with an @xmath7-port linear optical device ( lod ) shown in fig .",

    "the two spdc input states can be simplified to one . ]",
    "our aim here is to propose an lod scheme to generate two - mode multi - photon entangled states in the output which are resistant to photon loss .",
    "the most general two mode @xmath0-photon state can be written as @xmath14 where the quantities @xmath5 are the probability amplitudes of the photon number components .",
    "optimal states for phase estimation are symmetric between the paths @xcite , so we aim to have @xmath15 in our output state .",
    "we post - select vacuum in the other @xmath16 output modes of the lod in order to maximize the number of photons in the output .",
    "spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) is the most common source of photon pairs used in experiments . in order to make our state preparation scheme experimentally feasible",
    ", we consider the output from spdc as the input to the lod .",
    "the spdc state can be written as @xcite @xmath17 where the subscripts @xmath18 and @xmath19 stand for signal and idler ; these will be omitted from this point on for brevity .",
    "we also use the proportional to symbol to indicate that a normalization constant has been omitted . the quantity @xmath20 depends on the interaction time between the optical nonlinear crystal and pump laser , the strength of the nonlinearity in the crystal and the power of the pump laser .",
    "probability amplitudes of each term in the above spdc state can be controlled by the power of the pump laser .",

    "if vacuum is post - selected in all but two of the output modes , we again obtain the state given in eq .  .",
    "similarly , if we were to consider an arbitrary number of spdc sources , we would again obtain the same form of state .",
    "therefore there is no advantage to considering larger numbers of spdc sources , and we consider an lod fed with only one spdc source and vacuum to the remaining modes . as we aim for a symmetric state we set @xmath32 .",
    "it is also convenient to denote @xmath33 , which makes it clear that the states are parametrized by just one real number .",
    "thus we consider an @xmath7-port lod in which all but two of the input modes are vacuum and also all but two of the output modes are post - selected as vacuum , but we are allowing a potentially large number of modes . the scheme can be simplified to a four - port lod in the following way .",
    "figure  [ 53port](a ) shows a five - port lod with three vacuum input modes and post - selection of vacuum at three modes in the output , with the lod simplified to a triangular array of beam splitters and phase shifters @xcite .",

    "our proposed states still have some ambiguity in phase estimation , but by combining them with single photon states the ambiguity can be removed .",
    "by adjusting the reflectivities of the beam splitters and phases of the phase shifters we can choose the value of @xmath65 and optimize for phase measurement with loss .    in the case of two - photon states ,",

    "when using nonclassical states in optical interferometers , photon loss is the most important source of decoherence .",
    "a standard way to model photon loss in these systems is to introduce fictitious beam splitters in the arms of the interferometer @xcite .",
    "here we consider the same amount of loss in both arms .",
    "the transmissivity , @xmath72 , of the fictitious beam splitters determines the efficiency of the system .    the loss - resistant states in eq .",

    "considering the fictitious beam splitters after the phase shifts in the arms of the interferometer we define @xmath74 .",
    "the effect of the fictitious beam splitters is to change the creation operators of the upper and lower arms , @xmath75 , to @xmath76 and @xmath77 , where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the loss modes .",
    "thus , after loss the state @xmath80 becomes @xmath81 where the third and fourth modes in the state are the loss modes and @xmath82 is the binomial coefficient .",
    "if we denote the total number of photons lost as @xmath83 , and trace over loss modes , the density operator can be written as @xmath84 where @xmath85    after loss , a 50/50 beam splitter acts on the state . calculating the output density operator , its diagonal elements give the output detection probabilities @xmath86    where @xmath87 is the total number of photons lost and @xmath88 is the number of photons detected in one of the output ports ( which can be from @xmath89 to @xmath90 ) .",
    "for the two - photon input state , eq .  , there are six different output probabilities :    * if no photons are lost ( @xmath91 ) , then we can detect zero , one and two photons in output mode 2 ( @xmath92 ) , * if one photon is lost ( @xmath93 ) , then we can detect zero or one photon in output mode 2 ( @xmath94 ) , and * if both photons are lost ( @xmath95 ) , then the only possible detection result is vacuum ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "similarly for the four - photon state , eq .  , there are fifteen output probabilities .",
    "the larger number of output probabilities in comparison to the lossless case makes the calculations more computationally difficult .",
    "because the probabilities depend on the @xmath97 coefficients , which in turn contain exponentials of the phase @xmath98 , the probabilities @xmath99 can be written as a fourier series @xmath100 when updating the phase probability by bayes theorem , the probability can be represented by a finite number of the fourier coefficients .    in the following section",

    "<S> we consider the optimization of parameters in order to minimize the final phase variance , and find that the optimum parameters are different from those that maximize the fisher information . </S>"
