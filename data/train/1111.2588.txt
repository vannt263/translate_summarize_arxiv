    "studies of antideuteron and deuteron production in heavy - ion collisions are attractive for many reasons .",
    "enhanced antimatter production in central nucleus - nucleus collisions relative to @xmath8 was proposed as one of the experimental signatures for formation of a new state of strongly interacting nuclear matter - the quark - gluon plasma .  @xcite .",
    "if antibaryon abundances are not in equilibrium or not strongly affected by annihilation after chemical freeze - out , some of the initial enhancement may survive till the final stage of the collision process .",
    "however , at sps energies baryon rich nuclear matter is created at high temperatures ( @xmath9  mev and @xmath10  160  mev in central pb+pb collisions at 158  @xcite ) . in a hadronic medium of such temperature and baryon",
    "density , reaction rates involving antibaryons will be high due to annihilation and multi - pion fusion processes  @xcite .",
    "thus any antimatter enhancement from the partonic phase or its transition to the hadronic phase is likely to survive only if freeze - out occurs right after the phase transition .    at the late stage of the fireball evolution ,",
    "when the hadronic matter is diluted enough such that secondary inelastic collisions cease , the observed clusters are formed from nucleons .",
    "the process of nucleosynthesis in strongly interacting systems heated to more than 100  mev was extensively studied over the past years for species ranging from a=2 to a=7  @xcite .",
    "recently , the formation of ( anti)hypernuclei was observed in au+au collisions by the e864 experiment at ags energies  @xcite and by the star collaboration at rhic  @xcite .    in a simplified coalescence approach  @xcite ,",
    "( anti)nucleon bound states are formed from ( anti)nucleons which are close in momentum and configuration space .",
    "their production is usually characterized by the coalescence factor @xmath11 which relates the invariant yield of a cluster of size @xmath12 to the @xmath13 power of the proton yield .",
    "the @xmath6 parameter for deuterons was found to be approximately constant in heavy - ion collisions at beam energies below 1  as well as in all proton - induced reactions .",
    "however , at higher collision energies ( more than several gev per nucleon ) the diameter of the source created in central collisions is much larger than the deuteron size due to expansion of the reaction zone , and the cluster production process becomes sensitive to the details of the phase - space distribution of the constituents .",
    "in particular , a strong collective radial flow ( the average transverse velocity is about 0.5@xmath14 at sps energies  @xcite ) produces correlations between the production point in space - time and the momentum of the clusters .",
    "thus , an interplay between the flow velocity profile and the nucleon density distribution may result in different shapes of transverse momentum spectra for composites and single nucleons  @xcite .",
    "a comparative analysis of the production of clusters made of nucleons and antinucleons might therefore provide insight into the details of the fireball evolution and the nucleon phase - space distribution at kinetic freeze - out .",
    "the production rate of composites should depend on the spatial distribution of their constituents .",
    "if the @xmath15 suffer from annihilation in the dense baryonic matter , this could therefore be reflected in the impact parameter dependence of the @xmath1 yield  @xcite .",
    "moreover , because of the additional annihilation cross section , @xmath1 are expected to decouple from their source at much lower hadron density than @xmath2 and therefore their freeze - out volume is expected to be larger . in summary , the study of @xmath1 and @xmath2 production provides an alternate method for extracting information about the source size  @xcite which is complementary to the femtoscopy approach .",
    "recently , na49 reported  @xcite on @xmath15 production at midrapidity in centrality selected pb+pb collisions at 158 . in the following we extended this study of antimatter to the investigation of heavier systems",
    ". this paper reports our measurement of @xmath1 and @xmath2 invariant yields around midrapidity in the same reaction .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next section gives an overview of the na49 experimental set - up .",
    "details of the data analysis procedure are described in section  iii . in section",
    "iv we present and discuss the results on @xmath1 and @xmath2 production in mid - central pb+pb collisions .",
    "a summary is given in the last section .",
    "the na49 apparatus was designed as a large acceptance magnetic spectrometer to study nucleus - nucleus collisions in the sps energy range .",
    "the na49 setup covers about 50% of the final state phase space for pb+pb reactions at a beam energy of 158 .",
    "the detector provides precise tracking and robust particle identification .",
    "a full description of the apparatus components can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the primary lead beam was extracted from the cern super proton synchroton ( sps ) and delivered to na49 through the h2 beam line in the sps north area .",
    "the intensity of the beam ( delivered in spills 4.8  s long ) was typically @xmath16/s .",
    "the beam was defined within the experiment by a set of cherenkov and scintillation counters placed along 35  m of the beam path upstream from the nominal target position .",
    "the transverse diameter of the beam spot on the target , as measured by three multi - wire proportional beam position detectors ( bpds ) , was about 1  mm .",
    "the target was a lead foil of 337  mg/@xmath17 thickness ( 1.5% of a pb interaction length ) .",
    "the interaction trigger required a valid beam signal plus a collision centrality tag based on the measurement of projectile spectator energy registered in the zero - degree calorimeter vcal which was placed 23  m downstream of the target .",
    "charged reaction products originating from the interaction vertex are recordeed by four gas time projection chambers ( tpcs ) .",
    "two vertex tpcs ( vtpc ) , serving mainly for momentum analysis , are located inside two superconducting dipole magnets , which provide a magnetic field with a total bending power of about 9  tm .",
    "the two main tpcs ( mtpc ) , with about 27  m@xmath18 gas volume each , are positioned behind the magnets on each side of the beam line .",
    "these tpcs are optimized for energy loss ( @xmath19 ) measurements with a precision of 4% for minimum ionizing particles",
    "( _ mip _ ) .",
    "two time - of - flight ( tof ) arrays ( walls ) , positioned behind the mtpcs at @xmath20  14  m from the interaction vertex , are the main detector systems used in this analysis for the identification of charged hadrons of momenta up to 10  .",
    "the tof setup provides rapidity coverage of about 0.8 units in the mid - rapidity region and transverse momentum coverage up to @xmath7  =  2.5  .",
    "each wall consists of 891 pixels made of 2.5  cm thick plastic scintillators with transverse dimensions of 6 , 7 and 8  cm  ( horizontal ) by 3.4  cm  ( vertical ) .",
    "each pixel is viewed by one phototube of 1.4 inch diameter glued to the side of the pixel .",
    "the phototube outputs ( typically 1.5  volts high for a charge  =  1 _ mip _ passing through the pixel ) are divided into two equal parts and digitized by tdcs and adcs for time - of - flight and energy loss measurements , respectively .",
    "the least count of the fastbus lecroy tdcs was set to 25  ps .",
    "pixels are assembled in groups of 11 ( as stacks in the vertical direction ) in light - protected cassettes .",
    "a 0.5 mm thick quartz cherenkov counter @xmath21 placed 34  m upstream of the target provided the common start signals and the gates to the tdcs and adcs , respectively . for a beam of lead nuclei @xmath22",
    "has an intrinsic time resolution about 30  ps .",
    "the overall time resolution achieved with the tof system was @xmath23  ps and allows for a 5@xmath24 @xmath25 separation up to a momentum of @xmath26  =  10  .",
    "a high statistics sample of pb+pb collisions at beam energy of 158  was collected during the year 2000 run period .",
    "a total of @xmath27 events were recorded with an online event trigger selecting the 23.5% most central collisions .",
    ".[table : tab1 ] summary of the data sets used in the analysis .",
