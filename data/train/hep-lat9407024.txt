    "there has been a considerable amount of both analytical and numerical work on the ising model living on dynamically triangulated random surfaces and the dual @xmath0 ( and also @xmath1 ) graphs in the past few years , largely motivated by the interest of the model for string theory and two - dimensional gravity .",
    "the partition function of the model for a fixed number of points @xmath3 is @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the connectivity matrix for a given graph or triangulation and the sum over graphs @xmath6 means that we are , in effect , looking at annealed connectivity disorder in such models .",
    "the model was solved in the planar limit in @xcite by noting that a grand canonical partition function could be obtained as the free energy of a zero dimensional @xmath7 hermitian matrix model @xcite @xmath8 in the limit @xmath9 .",
    "the matrix propagator in the above is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 , and the potentials for @xmath0 and @xmath1 graphs are given by @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively .",
    "we have suppressed the external field dependence for clarity , though unlike the case of a fixed 2d lattice an exact solution is still possible even in the presence of an external field .",
    "the diagrams generated by the matrix model integral are `` fat '' graphs because the two indices carried by the matrix fatten the propagators into ribbons .",
    "this gives enough structure to build surfaces with the trace round internal loops and the initial factors in the coupling and propagator producing just the right factor of @xmath14 to count the genus .",
    "the matrix model solution has been pushed as far as toroidal topology @xcite , and both the toroidal and planar results for the ( non - onsager ) critical exponents are in agreement with continuum derivations in lightcone and conformal gauge liouville theory @xcite .",
    "there is now a gratifyingly large body of numerical evidence supporting the dynamical lattice exponents for both ising and potts models @xcite .    divorcing the ising model calculations and simulations from their origins in string theory and regarding them as an exercise in statistical mechanics , it is natural to ask if the methods employed might also be applicable to _ quenched _ disorder .",
    "in such a case the free energy @xmath15 is calculated on each graph before summing over the random graphs @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the partition function for the ising model on a particular random graph .",
    "the logarithm can be dealt with by using the replica trick @xcite @xmath18 at the expense of having to calculate with @xmath3 replicas of the original matter system . on a fixed lattice",
    "this is not a problem , but the @xmath19 barrier in 2d gravity means that it is nt possible to calculate with more than 2 ising replicas .",
    "ignoring the problem and simply taking the limit @xmath20 in the formulae of @xcite for the critical exponents , does however give apparently reasonable results that are close to the dynamical lattice exponents , which is what is seen in a direct simulation of a quenched set of @xmath0 fat graphs @xcite .",
    "it would obviously be better to have a more trustworthy formalism for investigating quenched problems where such troubles did not arise and one could confidently calculate with an arbitrary number of replicas .",
    "such a formalism is actually inherent in the matrix model approach in a limit that is opposite in a sense to that usually considered , namely @xmath21 @xcite . in this limit",
    "the fat graphs that build the surfaces or their duals in the matrix model integrals degenerate to `` thin '' graphs - in other words zero dimensional feynman diagrams .",
    "such graphs have in fact been considered before in the context of spin glass theories @xcite , without utilizing the methods of field theory and large order expansions of @xcite .",
    "the generic problems in the matrix model approach for @xmath22 can be traced to the difficulty in evaluating angular integrals that arise from diagonalizing the matrices , and these disappear for @xmath23 . consequently the difficulties in applying the replica formalism also vanish . as the regular surface interpretation",
    "is lost the continuum limit is taken by forcing the number of points @xmath24 rather than tuning the cosmological constant as for @xmath9 .",
    "in the remainder of the paper we discuss the behaviour of the ising model on such thin graphs . in the next section we review the analytical calculations of @xcite for ferromagnetic couplings , which serve as a test of the method . in this context",
    "we also discuss the saddle point solution for higher @xmath25 interactions and @xmath26 state potts models and their close correspondance with bethe lattice results .",
    "we then describe in section 3 simulations of the ferromagnetic ising model on @xmath0 and @xmath1 graphs , carried out essentially as a test of the formalism and the simulation programs , which are in agreement with these results . in section 4",
    "we discuss the _",
    "anti_-ferromagnetic ising model on thin graphs and describe our simulations of both the ising and three and four state potts models with purely negative couplings on quenched ensembles of feynman diagrams .",
    "the calculations of @xcite suggest that the antiferromagnetic model may have a spin glass phase at sufficiently negative coupling , and we investigate this numerically by histogramming the overlaps between replicas . in sections 5 and 6",
    "we discuss briefly some exploratory simulations of the ising antiferromagnet on quenched fat graphs and of potts antiferromagnets on thin graphs respectively , largely to compare the results with those for the ising model . finally in section 7",
    "we present our conclusions and discuss the various loose ends that have been left untied by the current work .",
    "the ( annealed ) average of the partition function over all the thin graphs with @xmath27 vertices can be expressed as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the number of undecorated graphs with @xmath27 points , @xmath30 for @xmath0 graphs , and the action is identical to that of the matrix model in equ.(2 ) .",
    "if we rescale the fields @xmath31 and drop the overall factors that are not germane to the discussion then the large @xmath3 limit can be evaluated by calculating the saddle points of the action @xmath32 a non - trivial phase structure can appear if there is a crossover in the dominant saddlepoint values , and this is what does in fact occur . in the @xmath0 model",
    "the solution to the saddle point equations are @xmath33 ( along with a trivial zero solution , and a solution exchanging @xmath34 in the second case ) .",
    "the first set of solutions above is the high temperature unmagnetized phase and the second , which becomes dominant for @xmath35 is the low temperature magnetized phase , with the magnetization being given by @xcite @xmath36 if we denote the deviation from the critical coupling @xmath37 by @xmath38 then we see that we have mean - field like behaviour @xmath39 .",
    "the same is true for the other exponents which can easily be calculated using the results of @xcite .",
    "the saddle point equations can also be readily solved for the case of the ising model on @xmath1 graphs , to give @xmath40 which indicate a phase transition at @xmath41 , again with mean field exponents .",
    "if we pause for a second , and look back over the results we can see that we have reproduced the behaviour of the ising model on bethe lattices with 3 and 4 neighbours @xcite with these results including , remarkably , the relevant critical temperatures .",
    "the correspondence between the bethe lattice results and those on feynman diagrams is unexpected because the bethe lattice contains no loops , whereas the number of loops in the feynman diagrams which can be calculated using standard methods is extensive @xcite , being @xmath42 for @xmath0 graphs with @xmath27 points for instance .",
    "the correspondance is not a fluke , it persists for the ising model on @xmath43 graphs and the corresponding bethe lattices .",
    "indeed , it remains true for the 3 and 4 state potts models also , where we have @xmath44 for the critical value of @xmath45 in a @xmath46-state potts model on a bethe lattice with @xmath47 neighbours @xcite .",
    "the action for the 3 state potts model on @xmath0 graphs is just @xmath48 where @xmath49 is now given by @xmath50 with @xmath51 .",
    "this gives the following high and low temperature saddle point solutions @xmath52 ( along with permutations ) which again display a transition at the bethe lattice value of @xmath53 ( ie @xmath54 ) . at the risk of belabouring the point",
    "the high and low temperature solutions for the 4 state potts model on @xmath0 graphs @xmath55 where two of the signs are to be taken positive and two negative in the second low temperature set , also fall into the pattern with @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "it is thus clear that , at least for ferromagnetic bonds where there is no frustration , the feynman diagrams offer an effective way of calculating with a closed version of the bethe lattice .",
    "in fact , they might even be considered as more respectable than the bethe lattice itself where one has to throw away the terms in the outermost shells to get a phase transition @xcite .",
    "the correspondance between the diagrams and the bethe lattice is underlined by the following observation , due to h. hilhorst @xcite : we can construct one of our feynman diagrams in a bethe - lattice - like manner by picking a seed point and following the standard procedure for constructing a bethe lattice , but also allowing ourselves the possibility of joining branches to other branches at any step .",
    "this then gives the correct loop counting of @xmath42 in the @xmath0 model with @xmath27 vertices , once all the branches have been closed .",
    "as a warmup exercise for simulations of the antiferromagnetic ising model on feynman diagrams we did some smaller scale simulations of the ferromagnetic model on @xmath0 and @xmath1 graphs .",
    "the generation of the graphs is a much easier exercise than generating the planar @xmath0 graphs used in @xmath58 gravity simulations as the absence of a constraint on the topology obviates the need to perform gymnastics with tutte s algorithm .",
    "the simulation itself used standard finite size scaling techniques to determine the critical exponents .",
    "the absence of frustration in the ferromagnetic model allowed the use of the wolff algorithm to give effective spin updating .",
    "we simulated on @xmath0 and @xmath1 graphs of sizes @xmath59 and @xmath60 points for various @xmath61 values , performing 20,000 measurements ( after a suitable number of metropolis equilibration sweeps ) with the number of wolff sweeps per measurement being determined by the inverse of the mean cluster size . with ferromagnetic couplings and no frustration the quantities we use to characterize the transition , such as",
    "the energy and magnetization are all self - averaging , so we might expect to be able to obtain the correct critical behaviour using a _ single _ graph of each size , provided our graphs are not too small and we pick a representative graph .",
    "we shall see that this is , in fact , the case .",
    "we commence our analysis of the results by looking at the crossing of the ( unnormalized ) binder s cumulant for the magnetization @xmath62 to locate the critical point .",
    "this provides a good test that we have managed to generate our graphs correctly .",
    "if we consider @xmath0 graphs first , the critical value of @xmath63 translates to @xmath64 and the crossing of the cumulant gives the estimate @xmath65 .",
    "similarly on @xmath1 graphs @xmath41 translates to @xmath66 and the crossing of the cumulant gives the estimate @xmath67 .",
    "the quoted errors are the differences in the crossing points for different ratios of graph sizes . as a check we have done two complete sets of simulations with a different random graph of each size , and used all the possible combinations in the cumulant analysis .",
    "there was no appreciable variation between different graphs of the same size .",
    "the crossing of the cumulant is shown in fig3.1 for three of the graph sizes used .",
    "the value of the specific heat critical exponent @xmath68 for the mean field ising model is zero , signifying a discontinuity between a finite value at @xmath69 and zero at @xmath70 rather than the logarithmic divergence of the onsager solution .",
    "if we look at fig3.2 we see clear signs of this mean field behaviour in the form of the specific heat curve and a direct fit to the data is also consistent with @xmath71 .",
    "we can verify this by looking at the scaling of the maximum slope of the magnetization cumulant which is expected to behave as @xmath72 for a graph with @xmath3 vertices .",
    "this gives @xmath73 which , using the hyperscaling relation @xmath74 , is again consistent with @xmath71 .",
    "the value of @xmath75 can also be fed into the finite size scaling relation for the vanishing of the magnetization at the critical point @xmath76 to extract a value for @xmath61 .",
    "we find that @xmath77 , so @xmath78 which is the mean field value .",
    "similarly , the scaling of the linear susceptibility @xmath79 at the critical point @xmath80 can be fitted to extract the exponent @xmath81 , giving @xmath82 which is in respectable agreement with the mean field value of 1 .",
    "we spare the reader the extraction of further exponents and the analysis of the @xmath1 results in a similar vein , as it is clear from the results already presented that the ising model exhibits a mean field transition ( as expected ) .",
    "the cumulant analysis also confirms that the transition occurs at the corresponding bethe lattice transition points .",
    "fortified by the good agreement between the analytical calculations and our simulations , we can now proceed to the case that really interests us , the antiferromagnet , to look for spin glass behaviour .",
    "in the absence of a @xmath19 barrier , we are at liberty to calculate with as many replicas as we can manage on thin graphs . it was pointed out in @xcite that the saddle point equations for @xmath83 replicas of the ising model on @xmath0 graphs admitted a factorized solution of the form @xmath84 where the @xmath85 are individual solutions of the annealed , @xmath86 , equation .",
    "the @xmath87 quenched free energy was equal to the annealed free energy , modulo finite size corrections .",
    "however , the entropy per spin calculated with this solution became negative for @xmath88 and higher moments of the partition function showed that the factorized solution no longer dominated @xmath89 with the changeover point apparently converging to a finite value for @xmath83 increasing .",
    "spin glass transitions are often signalled by the breakdown between quenched and annealed averages so , while this is not conclusive evidence for such a transition , it is certainly suggestive .    despite the fact that only antiferromagnetic couplings are present in the model , there is certainly frustration due to the loops .",
    "indeed , a variational calculation by de seze some years ago @xcite noted that an ising antiferromagnet with dilute bond disorder _ would _ have a spin glass phase if the undiluted version of the model did not allow antiferromagnetic order at @xmath90 .",
    "the hamiltonian in this case was @xmath91 where the sum was over all @xmath92 and the @xmath93 were distributed ( in a quenched ensemble ) according to @xmath94 which has the effect of killing a fraction @xmath95 of the bonds in any given realization .",
    "the model we consider on feynman diagrams could be cast in rather similar form , as we have some probability that two vertices are connected for a given graph , so viewed in this light spin - glass like behaviour is not so surprising .",
    "although we would no longer expect such close similarity with the standard bethe lattice as frustration has highlighted the role of the loops , there have been previous simulations of `` closed '' versions of the bethe lattice @xcite that might be expected to be a closer approximation .",
    "these considered mixed ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic bonds on a bethe lattice where the branches were closed in two ways - either with fixed boundary conditions , where no spin glass behaviour was seen , or with pairing between different branches in a given shell , which did display signs of a spin glass phase .",
    "unfortunately purely antiferromagnetic couplings were not considered , which would have allowed a more direct comparison with our results as the feynman diagrams are effectively a multi - shell generalization of the paired closure .",
    "our tactics for simulating the antiferromagnet were rather similar to those in @xcite .",
    "we took an explicitly quenched average by generating @xmath96 different feynman diagrams for each of the sizes that we simulated , @xmath97 and @xmath98 points .",
    "the number of lattices simulated is justified _ a posteriori _ by checking that the results for non - self averaging observables , such as the overlap described in the next paragraph , look reasonable .",
    "we used a massively parallel processor ( the intel paragon ) to run the different lattices concurrently and perform the requisite quenched averaging over the observables during the course of the simulation .",
    "for the sake of simplicity we made no attempt to use either multi - canonical , simulated tempering , or replica cluster simulation schemes which are applicable , usually with some effort , to frustrated systems such as ours @xcite but stuck to the metropolis algorithm . at each @xmath61 point we employed 500,000 simulated annealing sweeps to cool the system followed by 200,000 production sweeps with a measurement every 10th sweep .",
    "each sweep consisted of a complete metropolis update of the lattice .",
    "in addition to all of the standard thermodynamic variables that we measured in the ferromagnetic case we paid particular attention to the overlap between two replicas of the ising model on a given graph , as non trivial behaviour in the overlap distribution is often the sign of a spin glass phase .",
    "the overlap is defined in the standard fashion by putting two independent replicas on _ each _ graph in the ensemble @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the spin at site @xmath101 in one replica , and @xmath102 is the spin at site @xmath101 in the other .",
    "we then measure @xmath103\\ ] ] where @xmath104 $ ] denotes the quenched graph average and @xmath105 the thermal average , to get a histogram of the overlap probability .",
    "@xmath106 is known to be strongly non - self - averaging in soluble models such as the sherrington kirkpatrick ( sk ) model @xcite",
    "so the quenched average is vital , given the strong variation between individual graphs . a useful heursitic check in the simulations in to make sure that @xmath106 is symmetric about @xmath107 as @xmath108 analytically .",
    "if this is not the case the data is almost certainly not equilibrated .",
    "we have also measured the autocorrelation times in the measurements of @xmath106 in order to help judge their reliability .",
    "it is known in the sk model that @xmath106 is related to the parisi order parameter by @xmath109 @xcite , but in principle there are an infinite number of order parameters generalizing the overlap in short range models @xcite .",
    "it has also been observed that @xmath106 can produce misleading results in short range spin glasses , which might not exhibit the coexistence of infinitely many pure states that is seen in the mean field solution of the sk model @xcite , but rather have a two phase `` droplet '' structure .",
    "recent numerical work @xcite on the nearest neighbour four dimensional @xmath110 ising spin glass , however , seems to support a mean field like picture so the question is far from settled . in any case ,",
    "given that the genuine spin glass with nearest neighbour @xmath110 couplings on the bethe lattice behaves in an sk like way with the appropriate boundary conditions @xcite , it is not unreasonable to expect that @xmath106 may be an appropriate tool to use for the feynman diagrams we consider here .",
    "in addition , observables such as the spin glass susceptibility @xmath111 \\label{csg1}\\ ] ] may be calculated from the moments of @xmath106 @xmath112 we also measured directly the binder s cumulant associated with @xmath113 @xmath114 whose crossing points for differently sized lattices might be expected to pinpoint any spin glass transition point , in a similar manner to the cumulant for the magnetization in ferromagnetic transitions .    as in the ferromagnetic case , we commence our analysis by looking for the crossing point of the appropriate cumulant , @xmath115 .",
    "the results for this are much less accurate than for the ferromagnetic transition , both because of the smaller lattice sizes simulated and the non - self averaging nature of quantities that concern the overlap .",
    "nonetheless , we obtain a crossing for three of the four lattice sizes , indicating that there is a spin glass transition with @xmath116 , where the error is again from the different intercepts for different ratios of lattice sizes .",
    "this translates to @xmath117 , which is rather smaller than the value indicated by the negative entropy in @xcite ( @xmath88 or @xmath118 ) .",
    "however , using the high temperature solution to extract the entropy in the sk model @xcite gives an expression that becomes negative _ inside _ the spin glass phase rather than at the transition point as in the random energy model @xcite . in @xcite the entropy changes sign in what seems to be the paramagnetic phase from our simulations , but the apparent inversion here with respect to the sk model may be due to the purely antiferromagnetic couplings .",
    "we show the crossing of the cumulant in fig4.1 , where we have dropped the results from the @xmath119 lattices that ( narrowly ) failed to cross the others in the plot .",
    "it is known that the specific heat displays a cusp at @xmath37 in the sk model corresponding to an exponent @xmath120 , but if we look at our data in fig4.2 we see that , although there is a cusp it appears to be in the region of @xmath121 .",
    "however , the specific heat estimations of the critical coupling need to be extrapolated to infinite volume to compare with the cumulant results . to do this",
    "we need to extract a value for the combination @xmath75 from our data may be rather ill - defined on our diagrams , the combination is not . ] which can be done by regarding the scaling of the maximum slope of @xmath115 which , just as for @xmath122 , is expected to behave as @xmath123 we find @xmath124 , which is consistent with the cusp displayed by the specific heat as the hyperscaling relation @xmath125 still holds .",
    "it is also compatible with the mean field sk value @xmath120 .",
    "if we now use our value of @xmath75 to extrapolate the @xmath37 s for the specific heat to infinite volume we find @xmath126 , which is less negative than the value from the cumulant crossing .",
    "the quoted error for the critical coupling determined from the specific heat cusp is probably too optimistic , given it is the result of a fit first to @xmath75 followed by a linear interpolation of the estimated cusp positions , so the cumulant crossing value is certainly more reliable .",
    "the linear susceptibility @xmath127 does not diverge at a spin glass transition point , but is expected to display a cusp similar to that in the specific heat . in fig4.3",
    "we plot @xmath79 and see clear evidence of a cusp although it is noteworthy that this is considerably displaced from @xmath128 .",
    "the finite size scaling does not give such a convincing shift back towards this value as in the specific heat case , but the quality of the data is poorer . from the spin glass point of view",
    "the more interesting susceptibility is @xmath129 defined in equ.([csg1 ] ) , which we measured both directly and using using equ.([csg2 ] ) .",
    "the data from the direct measurements is plotted in fig4.4 .",
    "@xmath129 is expected to diverge at a spin glass transition , in contrast to @xmath79 , so there will be a finite size scaling relation of the form @xmath130 analogously to equ.([cm ] ) . fitting the data from both ways of extracting @xmath129 we find @xmath131 , where the error bar does not take account of the uncertainty in determining the critical point .",
    "this value is still marginally compatible with the sk value of 1 .",
    "looking directly at the histograms of @xmath106 also gives indications of a transition around @xmath132 . in figs4.5 - 4.6",
    ", we show the histograms for @xmath133 , deep in the paramagnetic phase and at @xmath134 , below the transition point .",
    "we have plotted the histograms without the error bars coming from the quenched average ( which are not particularly large ) for clarity .",
    "the histograms in fig4.5 are clearly gaussian in shape , as expected for a paramagnetic phase and the width of the gaussians for differently size graphs is in reasonable agreement with `` delta - function '' like behaviour , namely @xmath135 . as the region around @xmath128 is approached the histograms broaden considerably and begin to show signs of a dip at the origin .",
    "once we are in the putative spin glass phase the histograms look generically like that in fig4.6 for @xmath134 .",
    "comparing with histograms for the different lattice sizes shows that the peak at @xmath136 is sharpening with increasing lattice size and that the `` tail '' stretching down to @xmath107 remains stable .",
    "these results suggest that the behaviour is strikingly similar to the sk spinglass , with a delta function at finite @xmath113 adjoined to a continuous tail down to @xmath107 in the infinite volume limit .",
    "this also means that the distribution of @xmath106 takes on a form very similar to that seen on a bethe lattice spin - glass with closed boundary conditions in the simulations in @xcite .",
    "once we are some distance below @xmath128 the autocorrelation times for the overlap become very large and the histograms begin to lose their symmetry and roughen , suggesting that the data has failed to equilibrate , a behaviour often seen in spin glass simulations .    from these results",
    "the ising antiferromagnet on feynman diagrams would appear to possess a spin glass phase at sufficiently negative @xmath61 with similar properties to the sk model .",
    "it is thus behaving in a mean field like manner and all the paraphernelia of replica symmetry breaking might be expected to be applicable .",
    "as we indicated in the introduction there is nothing to stop us simulating the ising model on a quenched ensemble of fat graphs , even though such a system is currently not accesssible to reliable analytical calculations .",
    "the simulations of an ising ferromagnet on such an ensemble in @xcite encountered no obvious pitfalls and gave results that were very similar to the annealed ensemble of dynamical graphs .",
    "one might expect quenched and annealed averages to give rather similar results when frustration is not playing a major role , so the antiferromagnet may well be a different story entirely .",
    "a simulation of an ising antiferromagnet on quenched fat graphs is of interest because the graphs involved are no longer of an `` infinite - dimensional '' mean field type .",
    "indeed , it appears that the fractal dimension of the graphs is 3 or 4 ( depending on the method of definition ) @xcite , and 3 may be the lower critical dimension of the spin - glass transition .",
    "it might be possible to look analytically at the change , if any , from the mean field behaviour on @xmath23 thin graphs as the size of the matrices @xmath14 is increased to fatten the graphs .",
    "such an approach has already provided surprisingly good values for critical exponents and couplings in the one matrix model by extrapolation from quite small @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "we are less ambitious here and simply conduct a trial simulation of the ising model on @xmath96 planar @xmath0 graphs with 250 vertices in each .",
    "the loop distribution is calculable using the methods of @xcite and is strongly peaked at small ( 3,4 .. ) loops .",
    "this means that by comparison with the thin graphs , where the loops are in general rather large and the local structure tree - like , frustration is likely to play a stronger role .",
    "we use the same number of graphs and simulated annealing sweeps in the simulation as in the thin graph simulations of the preceding section .",
    "we find that the histograms of @xmath106 begin to deviate strongly from a gaussian shape in the region of @xmath137 and become very irregular and assymetric for @xmath138 .",
    "this is a signal either that we have not equilibrated the system or failed to include enough graphs in the quenched average for these @xmath61 values .",
    "increasing the simulated annealing steps by a factor of four makes little difference to the roughness of the @xmath106 .",
    "the associated autocorrelation times for the measurements of @xmath113 also rapidly become astronomical below @xmath137 .    in the region of @xmath137",
    "the observed histograms are rather similar to those in the region of @xmath139 on thin graphs , being perhaps more irregular .",
    "this would mean that one has to work harder on fat graphs than on thin graphs to obtain reliable numerical results .",
    "one of the histograms for @xmath106 at @xmath140 for the fat graph is shown in fig5.1 , where we have included a histogram of @xmath106 at @xmath141 on a thin graph of 250 vertices for comparison . allowing for the differing `` distances '' from the apparent critical values and remembering that a size of 250 on a fat graph may not be equivalent to a size of 250 on a thin graph ,",
    "the two distributions are very similar in form .",
    "as we have only simulated a single graph size , we make no attempt to conduct a serious scaling analysis with our current fat graph data and content ourselves with some qualitative observations : the non - trivial distribution of @xmath106 that has been observed , and the large autocorrelation times suggest that something non - trivial is still going on for the antiferromagnet on fat graphs for sufficiently negative @xmath61 . if the form of @xmath106 persisted on larger graphs it would be suggestive of mean field like behaviour , given its similarity to the thin graph distribution and hence that of the sk model .",
    "we have thus seen that the ising antiferromagnet on @xmath0 graphs displays a non - gaussian @xmath106 for sufficiently negative couplings , which strongly resembles those seen in @xcite for the ising spin glass on a bethe lattice with closed boundary conditions , and those for the sk model .",
    "it would appear that the model is closer to these mean - field systems than short range spin glasses .",
    "given this it is of interest to enquire whether higher state potts models also display non - trivial @xmath106 on feynman diagrams for purely negative couplings .",
    "it is not immediately obvious that they will , as it is easier to `` unfrustrate '' a given loop if we have more colours .",
    "in addition , genuine potts glasses ( @xmath110 or gaussian distributed couplings ) have a completely different order parameter distribution to the ising spin glass in both infinite range models and on bethe lattices @xcite . in the infinite range ( mean field )",
    "case they display two transition temperatures , with a @xmath106 that is still a delta function below the first and two delta functions joined by a continuous portion below the second . on the bethe lattice the form of @xmath106 depends on the bond distribution and the number of neighbours , for @xmath110 bonds in the 3 state potts model for instance there is a delta - function when the number of neighbours @xmath142 and a continuous distribution for @xmath143 . for the 4 state potts model",
    "there is only a delta function @xcite . for more than four states in both cases",
    "the phase transition displays some first order properties .    for p - state potts models",
    "the overlap can be defined as @xmath144 which is arranged to be zero in the uncorrelated case @xmath145 .",
    "this can be measured just as in the ising simulations .",
    "a quick test simulation of the 3 state model on @xmath0 graphs reveals that the distribution of @xmath106 does not appear to change from the paramagnetic form even for large negative couplings , suggesting there is no spinglass phase at all .",
    "the intuition that there is now enough liberty to relieve the frustration can , be substantiated by brook s theorem from graph theory @xcite : if g is a connected graph with maximal vertex valency @xmath146 , and if g is not complete , then the chromatic number @xmath147 , earlier ! ] the minimum number of colours it takes so that no adjacent vertices are the same colour , of g is @xmath47 . in this language",
    "we have a 3-regular graph that is not complete , so @xmath148 and we can avoid frustration completely with 3 colours . by the same token , we would not expect any spinglass like behaviour on @xmath149 graphs for @xmath150 state potts models with purely negative couplings as @xmath151 for these .",
    "chromatic numbers for more general random graphs are rather large , though some asymptotic bounds are known , that are in accordance with simulations of antiferromagnetic potts models @xcite .",
    "there are of course , particular cases such as the solution of the celebrated four colour problem , which states that @xmath152 for any planar map @xcite .",
    "@xmath153 trivially for a planar square lattice and a three colouring algorithm also exists as a consequence of the solution of the six vertex model @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , another quick test simulation for a 3 state potts model with purely negative couplings on @xmath1 feynman diagrams ( so neither brooks theorem nor the four - colour theorem apply ) also produced distributions that did not change from the paramagnetic form with decreasing beta .",
    "it would be interesting to confirm this behaviour and explore it further for different @xmath46 and graphs .    a brief summary of whether or not a spin glass transition appears to occur in the cases discussed above ( @xmath154 ) or not ( @xmath155 ) is given in the table below .",
    "we have left the @xmath51 model on thin @xmath1 graphs undecided .",
    "@xmath154 + @xmath156 & fat & @xmath0 & @xmath154 + @xmath51 & fat , thin & @xmath0 & @xmath155 + @xmath51 & thin & @xmath1 & ?",
    "+ @xmath157 & fat & any & @xmath155 + @xmath150 & fat , thin & @xmath149 & @xmath155 +    * table 1 * : summary of whether a spin glass transition appears @xmath154 or not @xmath155 .",
    "we have seen analytically in section 2 that both ising and higher state potts models on feynman diagrams reproduce the bethe lattice mean field behaviour , even down to the same critical couplings for bethe lattices with the same number of nearest neighbours . in section 3",
    "we saw that the self averaging nature of the quantities that characterize the transition , such as the energy and the magnetization , meant that we could obtain numerically respectable results with a single graph .",
    "these were in good accord with the analytical calculations .",
    "the net conclusion is thus that , at least as far as ferromagnetic couplings are concerned , the ising and potts models do not `` see '' the loops that make the difference between the bethe lattice and the feynman diagrams .",
    "these loops _ do _ , however , play a role once antiferromagnetic couplings are introduced .",
    "the calculations of @xcite , suggesting a spinglass phase in the ising model for sufficiently negative coupling , are supported by the non - trivial @xmath106 s that were observed in section 4 .",
    "the quenched average over different feynman diagrams was obligatory in this case because of the non - self - averaging properties of @xmath106 .",
    "the results seen on the feynman diagrams are strongly reminiscent of the bethe lattice with closed boundary conditions that was simulated in @xcite .",
    "the form of the @xmath106 for the ising antiferromagnet suggests that we are closer to a mean field picture of spin glass behaviour than a droplet one on feynman diagrams , again much like the bethe lattice , and in accordance with earlier calculations for finite connectivity random lattices .",
    "the critical exponents we extracted were also all in reasonable agreement with those in the mean field sk model .",
    "in section 5 we looked briefly at the ising antiferromagnet on planar or fat graphs , finding that the distribution of @xmath106 was rather similar to that on a thin graph of a similar size .",
    "the antiferromagnetic higher state potts models that we also briefly looked at in section 6 show interesting behaviour , and there are some intriguing links with colouring problems in graph theory .",
    "the utility of feynman diagrams as a tool in analytical calculations with random graphs of finite connectivity is thus clear .",
    "the close connection between the feynman diagrams and the bethe lattice is somewhat unexpected at first sight , but persists even for the antiferromagnet and closed versions of the bethe lattice .",
    "both the ferromagnet and antiferromagnet have displayed essentially mean field behaviour on thin graphs .",
    "the simulations of @xcite suggest that this is _ not _ the case for the ferromagnet on fat graphs , so it would be worth pursuing the simulations of the antiferromagnet on fat graphs to look for non mean field behaviour and exponents .",
    "we have not explored issues such as the scaling of @xmath106 , the ultrametricity ( or otherwise ) of the distribution of states and the response to external fields for the antiferromagnet in the current work , but we hope to return to these in future .",
    "there are also various direct generalizations that we have not had the time to explore in the current paper .",
    "a first is to look at `` real '' spinglasses with either @xmath110 or gaussian couplings on the feynman diagrams to compare with previous bethe lattice results for such models .",
    "a second obvious extension is to look at other models such as the @xmath158 model on thin graphs , for which some analytical results already exist in the unfrustrated case @xcite",
    ". it might also be worthwhile to implement some of the more advanced simulation algorithms on the models described here .",
    "there are clearly plenty of interesting questions to be addressed regarding quenched disorder on both thin and fat graphs .",
    "the ferromagnetic simulations reported in this paper were carried out on workstations at heriot - watt university , lpthe orsay and the university of colorado .",
    "the antiferromagnetic simulations were carried out on the front range consortium s 208-node intel paragon located at noaa / fsl in boulder .",
