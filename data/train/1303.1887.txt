    "observation of high - energy gamma - rays from molecular clouds can be used to study the sources of cosmic rays ( crs ) , the cr density , and the distribution of the interstellar medium ( ism ) in such systems .",
    "gamma - rays are produced in the ism by interactions of high - energy cr protons and electrons with the interstellar gas or the interstellar radiation field , via nucleon - nucleon collisions , electron bremsstrahlung , and inverse compton ( ic ) scattering . since the gamma - ray production cross section is almost independent of the thermodynamic state of the ism , gamma - rays",
    "have been recognized as a powerful probe of the distribution of interstellar matter ( e.g. , stecker 1970 , lebrun et al .",
    "1983 and blemen et al . 1984 ) if the gas column densities are estimated with good accuracy by observations in other wavebands such as radio and infrared , the cr spectrum and density distributions can be examined as well .",
    "molecular clouds that are within 1 kpc from the solar system ( namely nearby molecular clouds ) and have masses greater than a few 10@xmath10 _ m_@xmath11 are well suited for an analysis of their gamma - ray emission to investigate the distribution of cr densities and interstellar gas since they are observed at high latitudes and therefore largely free from confusion with the strong emission from the galactic plane .",
    "study of such nearby molecular clouds in gamma - rays can be dated back to the cos - b era ( bloemen et al .",
    "1984 ) and was advanced by the egret on board _ compton gamma - ray observatory _",
    "( e.g. , hunter et al . 1994 ) .",
    "although some important information has been obtained on properties of crs and the ism by these early observations , detailed studies have only been performed on giant molecular clouds with masses greater than @xmath0  10@xmath12 _ m_@xmath11 such as the orion complex ( e.g. , digel et al . 1999 ) . the large area telescope ( lat ) ( atwood et al . 2009 ) on board the _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _ has improved the situation significantly thanks to its unprecedented sensitivity . in addition , recent developments in studies of the ism ( e.g. , kalberla et al . 2005 , dame et al .",
    "2001 and grenier et al .",
    "2005 ) allow us to investigate the cr spectra and density distribution with better accuracy .    here , we report an analysis of _ fermi _ lat observations of the chamaeleon , r  coronae australis ( r  cra ) , and cepheus and polaris flare molecular clouds .",
    "they are among the nearest ( @xmath0 300 pc from the solar system ) molecular clouds .",
    "no detailed study of cr and matter distributions for the chamaeleon and r  cra regions had been performed before since they have rather small masses ( @xmath13 10@xmath14 @xmath15 ) and consequently small gamma - ray fluxes .",
    "we also analyzed in detail the region of the cepheus and polaris flares which was included in the _ fermi _ lat study of the second galactic quadrant ( abdo et al .",
    "details of this proceedings are presented in a published paper ( ackermann et al .",
    "for this analysis , we have accumulated events obtained from 2008 august 4 to 2010 may 9 . during this time interval",
    "the lat was operated in sky survey mode nearly all of the time and scanned the gamma - ray sky with relatively uniform exposure over time ( within 10% in regions studied ) .",
    "we used the standard lat analysis software , science tools version v9r16p0 and the response function p6_v3_diffuse , which was developed to account for the detection inefficiencies due to pile - up and accidental coincidence of events ( rando et al .",
    "we set the lower energy limit at 250 mev to utilize good angular resolution ( 68% containment radius is @xmath13 1.5@xmath16 above 250 mev ) and the upper energy limit at 10 gev because of limited photon statistics .",
    "the gamma - ray count maps obtained ( @xmath17 @xmath18 250 mev ) in the three regions are shown in figure [ fig : cham_r_cra_cepo_image ] . point sources with high significance ( test statistic , ts , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the maximum likelihoods obtained with and without the source included in the model fitting , respectively ; see ( mattox et al . 1996)],greater than 50 ) are also plotted .",
    "ll             +         +    we modeled the gamma - ray emission as a linear combination of maps tracing the column density of the interstellar gas .",
    "this approach has been successfully applied in recent studies of diffuse gamma - rays by the lat ( e.g. , abdo et al .",
    "2010a and ackermann et al .",
    "2011 ) . with the usual assumptions of optical thinness and",
    "that crs uniformly thread the ism , gamma - ray intensity ( s@xmath3 @xmath7 sr@xmath3 mev@xmath3 ) at a given energy can be modeled as    @xmath21    where @xmath22 labels the regions along the line of sight separated in the analysis ( 1 for the gould belt and 2 for the rest ) .",
    "@xmath23 ( s@xmath3 sr@xmath3 mev@xmath3 ) and @xmath24 ( s@xmath3 @xmath7 sr@xmath3 mev@xmath3 ( k km s@xmath3)@xmath3 ) are the emissivity per h  atom ( traced by the 21 cm line of atomic hydrogen ) and per @xmath9 unit ( as a tracer of molecular gas ) , respectively .",
    "@xmath25 ( s@xmath3 @xmath7 sr@xmath3 mev@xmath3 mag@xmath3 ) is the emissivity per @xmath26  magnitude which accounts for the gas not traced well by h  and co : we constructed visual extinction ( @xmath27 ) maps providing an estimate of the total column densities on the assumption of a constant gas - to - dust ratio , and obtained map by the fitting a linear combination of the @xmath28 and @xmath9  maps . @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the ic model and isotropic background intensities ( s@xmath3 @xmath7 sr@xmath3 mev@xmath3 ) , respectively .",

    ", we also tried to fit the data with maps obtained by assuming _",
    "t_@xmath40 = 100 k and under the approximation that the gas is optically - thin .",
    "we evaluated the uncertainty of the isotropic component to be @xmath3410% by comparing the model we adopted and those derived in other lat studies of mid - latitude regions ( abdo et al .",
    "2009a and abdo et al .",
    "we thus reran the analysis assuming a 10% higher and lower intensity for the fixed isotropic component .",
    "we also investigated the effect on the systematic uncertainty due to the ic component by using different ic model maps which are constructed under different assumptions about the distribution of cr sources and intensity of the interstellar radiation field ( e.g. , ackermann et al .",
    "the effects of the uncertainty of the _",
    "t_@xmath40 , isotropic component , and ic models are quite comparable , therefore we added them .",
    "the resultant peak - to - peak uncertainty of the local h emissivity is less than @xmath0 20 % across the energy range for three regions investigated .",
    "we then compared the obtained h  emissivity spectra among the three regions , and model spectra for the local interstellar spectrum ( lis ) as shown in figure [ fig : hiemissivity_xco ] ( left ) . whereas the spectral shapes for the three regions studied here agree well with the lis model , the absolute emissivities differ among the three regions .",
    "we note that the systematic uncertainty of the lat effective area ( 5% at 100 mev and 20% at 10 gev ; ( rando et al .",
    "2009 ) does not affect the relative value of emissivities among these regions .",
    "the effect of unresolved point sources is small , since we have verified that the obtained emissivities are robust against the lower threshold for point sources between ts @xmath33 50 and 100 .",
    "although the emissivities of the r  cra region and the cepheus and polaris flare region are comparable , that of the chamaeleon region is lower by @xmath0 20% , even if we take the systematic uncertainties into account . therefore , the lat data point to variations in the cr densities within @xmath0 300 pc in the gould belt",
    "if the cr density has a variation by a factor of @xmath0 1.2 in the neighborhood of the solar system , this requires a serious reconsideration of a smooth cr density often adopted for simplicity , and may have an impact on the study of the cr source distribution and diffuse gamma - ray emission .",
    "we note that cr sources are stochastically distributed in space and time , and this may produce a cr anisotropy depending on the propagation conditions ( e.g. , blasi & amado 2012a and blasi & amato 2012b ) .",
    "study of other regions and more detailed theoretical calculations are needed for further investigating this issue . on the other hand ,",
    "we need to further investigate possible systematic uncertainties due to variations in @xmath8  ( see the next paragraph ) or dust - to - gas ratio we assumed in the construction of the @xmath26  map .      under the hypothesis that the same cr flux penetrates the h  and",
    "co phases of an interstellar complex , we can calculate the molecular mass calibration ratio , @xmath8 , as @xmath41 .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : hiemissivity_xco ] ( right ) , we derived the @xmath8  values from a linear fit of the ( @xmath42 , @xmath24 ) points .",
