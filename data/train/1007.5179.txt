    "if a spin-1/2 particle passes through a region of uniform magnetic field , it is well known that the time evolution of the spin of the particle undergoes what is commonly known as larmor precession .",
    "for example , if the particle with an initial spin orientation along the @xmath0 axis passes through a magnetic field oriented along the + @xmath1 axis , the spin precesses in the x - y plane with a frequency determined by the strength of the magnetic field and the magnetic moment of the particle .",
    "this frequency is known as the larmor frequency - a topic which is not only commonly discussed in any undergraduate quantum mechanics course , but also has wide applications , particularly in the analysis of experiments involving neutron , electron and atomic interferometry .",
    "one of the important applications of larmor precession is its use in calculating the tunneling time through a potential barrier where the time during which the particle passes through the barrier can be predicted via the larmor precession relation that provides a correspondence between the transit time and the angle of rotation of the spin orientation of the spin-1/2 particles @xcite .    however , surprisingly , the treatments given in all the standard text - books@xcite on the subject are fundamentally inadequate because none of them considers the solution of the full schrodinger equation in this problem involving both the spin and the space parts .",
    "in particular , the usual treatments ignore the spatial part altogether and write the hamiltonian only in terms of the potential energy arising out of the spin - magnetic field interaction .",
    "for example , cohen - tannoudji et al.@xcite provide their treatment of larmor precession by considering only the spin dynamics of the system in the presence of the uniform magnetic field . on the other hand",
    ", bohm@xcite gives a semi - classical argument as the basis for larmor precession .",
    "another line of justification for this procedure assumes that the particle is at rest while it interacts with the magnetic field , an obviously untenable premise that violates the uncertainty principle as the spatial extent of the magnetic field is not infinite@xcite .",
    "a specious argument for ignoring the kinetic energy term in the hamiltonian would be to take this term to be much smaller in magnitude as compared to the spin - magnetic field potential energy term . to check whether this assumption is valid or",
    "not , it is important to note that most experiments involving larmor precession are done at or near room temperature . at this ambient temperature ,",
    "the average kinetic energy of the particles under study is of the order of @xmath2 . at room temperature",
    "the value of @xmath2 is about @xmath3 .",
    "let us now look at a typical value of the spin - magnetic field interaction energy .",
    "a magnetic field of @xmath4 is achievable in laboratory conditions and is the typical value of the magnetic field in the relevant experiments . for this strength of the magnetic field",
    ", the interaction energy arising due to the interaction of the field with the spin magnetic moment of a neutron is of the order of @xmath5 . comparing this with the value of the kinetic energy , obviously , the assumption that the kinetic energy of the particle is negligible compared to the spin - magnetic field interaction energy in typical experiments does not hold good .",
    "in fact , under such conditions , the kinetic energy term is much larger than the potential energy term .    here",
    "we note that all the treatments of calculating tunneling time through a barrier based on larmor clock @xcite pertain to a spatial region within which a constant magnetic field and an external potential @xmath6 are both confined .",
    "it is essentially due to the presence of the external potential that both spin - up and spin - down particles see potential barriers , but of different heights .",
    "interestingly , if one takes the limit of the external potential @xmath7 , the usual larmor precession relation can not be recovered even in the presence of high magnetic field . on the other hand , in our treatment",
    ", we do not consider any external potential so that while a spin - up particle sees a potential well , a spin - down particle sees a barrier .",
    "hence , our treatment is completely different from all the prevalent treatments pertaining to tunneling time calculation using larmor clock .",
    "we begin by considering a wave function whose space part is a plane wave and is spin polarized in the @xmath8 direction . by examining closely the time evolution of the entire wave function , that is , both the spin and the space parts , caused by the interaction of the spin of the particle with the magnetic field , we find an interesting feature - due to the specifics of this spin - magnetic field interaction , it is possible to derive the time evolution of the entire wave function by solving the schrodinger equation for only the spatial part .",
    "then , from the time - evolved entire wave function , one can find the change in the spin part of the wave function ; this is shown in section ii .",
    "subsequently , in section iii , the limit in which the result of our treatment matches the result of the standard larmor precession as well as the limit in which there is an appreciable departure from larmor precession are discussed .",
    "this treatment reveals that it is , in fact , the limit where the kinetic energy is much higher than the potential energy due to the spin - field interaction that the standard expression for larmor precession holds true . in section",
    "iii numerical estimates of departure from the standard larmor precession are presented . in section",
    "iv we generalize the treatment given above to the case of an incident wave packet rather than a plane wave .",
    "let us consider that the total initial wave function of a particle is represented by @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the spatial part taken to be a plane wave with wave number @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the spin state polarized in the @xmath8 direction with @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the eigenstates of @xmath15 .",
    "now , we consider that the particle passes through a bounded region containing constant magnetic field directed along the @xmath16-axis .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian is @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the magnetic moment of the neutron , @xmath19 is the inhomogeneous magnetic field and @xmath20 is the pauli spin matrices vector .",
    "then the time evolved total wave function at @xmath21 after the interaction of spins with the uniform magnetic field is given by @xmath22 \\label{timeevolved}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the two components of the spinor @xmath25 which satisfies the pauli equation .",
    "the homogeneous magnetic field is written as @xmath26 .",
    "the two - component pauli equation can then be written as two coupled equations for @xmath27 and @xmath28 , given by    @xmath29    @xmath30    eqs.(2 ) and ( 3 ) imply that while a neutron having spin - up interacts with the spin rotator containing constant magnetic field , the associated spatial wave function @xmath31 evolves under a _ potential well _ that has been generated due to the spin - magnetic field interaction ; the associated spatial wave function @xmath32 of a spin - down neutron evolves under a _ potential barrier_. before proceeding to focus on the solutions of eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , we revisit in the next section the usual textbook treatment of this problem purporting to derive the larmor precession relation for the rotated spin state after the spin - magnetic field interaction within the spin - rotator .      the behaviour of the wave function after it starts interacting with the spin rotator is usually described by taking into account _ only _ the spin part of the wave function , while the space part is completely left out of the analysis . neglecting the kinetic energy , the hamiltonian of the system inside the spin rotator is taken to be @xmath33 .",
    "the spin up and spin down parts of the wave function evolve according to the schroedinger equation in the following way @xmath34 -0.5",
    "cm @xmath35 the solutions of the above two first order differential equations are @xmath36 where @xmath37 , and @xmath38 is the time over which the spin - magnetic field interaction takes place . putting these solutions in eq.(1 ) , we finally obtain @xmath39 eq.([psitauusual ] ) can be written as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the well - known larmor precession relation and @xmath42 is the larmor frequency and , @xmath43 is the global phase .",
    "the spin state after the interaction is given by @xmath44 .    in the above treatment @xmath38",
    "is taken to be the transit time through the spin rotator , given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the spatial extension of spin - rotator containing the uniform magnetic field , and @xmath47 is the initial velocity of particle .",
    "however , the above treatment has an intrinsic incompleteness because it does _ not _ take into account the evolution of spatial part , and hence the kinetic energy associated with the wave function .",
    "the detailed analysis of this problem should include the evolutions of both the spin and space parts of the total initial wave function . in the following section we fill this gap by giving a rigorous analysis of this problem .",
    "here we begin by recalling that eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) imply that in this problem , we effectively have a situation where the spin up part of the wave function faces a _ potential well _ while the spin down part of the wave function faces a _",
    "potential barrier_. this , in turn , entails that the information about the spin part of the wave function enters the space part of the wave function through this potential , and thus solving the schroedinger equation for only the space part of the wave function suffices to get complete information about the time evolution of the combined spin - space wave function . here",
    "we may stress once again that this method of treatment of the quantum mechanical problem of spin precession in a uniform magnetic field has remain unexplored .",
    "therefore , instead of equations ( [ so+ ] ) and ( [ so- ] ) , one needs to solve eqs.(2 ) and ( 3 ) explicitly .    the solutions to these equations , given our initial state , consist of a reflected part traveling in the @xmath48-direction and a transmitted part of the wave function , traveling in the @xmath8-direction .",
    "we should note here that the reflected part of the wave function exists _ only _ to the left of the spin rotator , and the transmitted part exists _ only _ to the right of the spin rotator .",
    "our ultimate objective is to calculate the observable rotation of the spin part of the wave function caused by evolution of the state due to the spin - magnetic field interaction within the spin rotator .",
    "+ for this , we need to look only at that part of the wave function which pertains to those neutrons which have actually passed through the spin rotator , or in other words we focus only on the transmitted part of the wave function . therefore , using the solutions of equations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , we will finally end up with the following state @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the normalized constant can be written as @xmath51 .",
    "+ note that , eq.([fitra ] ) is an entangled state between the spin and spatial degrees of freedom of the transmitted part .",
    "the expressions for the reflected and transmitted parts of a wave function at a potential well or barrier are well known . however , from an empirical perspective , we note that if in the above setup , even if we use low energy or ultra - cold neutrons , having kinetic energy of the order of @xmath52 , for the potential energy term ( @xmath53 ) to exceed the kinetic energy term ( @xmath54 ) , we will need a field of the order of @xmath55 .",
    "magnetic fields of such high intensity are difficult to produce in laboratory conditions , and therefore for all practical purposes , we should consider the situation where @xmath56 .    now , since @xmath57 evolves under a potential barrier confined between @xmath58 and @xmath59 the reflected and tranmitted ports are respectively given by @xmath60    @xmath61    where @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath46 is the width of the spin rotator arrangement which contains the uniform magnetic field .",
    "the wave function @xmath64 evolves under a potential well , the expressions for the transmitted and the reflected part by replacing all the @xmath65 s in eqs.([psi - r ] ) and ( [ psi - t ] ) by @xmath66 where @xmath67 . @xmath68    @xmath69    then ,",
    "in the regime @xmath56 , we now rewrite equation ( 7 ) in the following form , which is the modified formula for larmor precession calculated by the explicit time - evolved solution of the spatial parts , @xmath64 and @xmath57 @xmath70 here @xmath71 @xmath72",
    "@xmath73 @xmath74    where , by using equations ( [ psi - t ] ) and ( 13 ) , we find that @xmath75 @xmath76    @xmath77    @xmath78",
    "let us now examine in what limit the above expressions do indeed reduce to the standard expressions for larmor precession .",
    "as already mentioned , we are working in the range @xmath56 .",
    "let us now consider the stronger limit where @xmath79 . in this limit ,",
    "the kinetic energy term of the hamiltonian is appreciably larger than the potential energy term , and then , effectively , the time evolution of the entire wave function occurs due to a very shallow well and a very low barrier .",
    "this situation would correspond to the entire wave being transmitted , but picking up a phase . from the expressions for @xmath80 , in the limit @xmath79 , we find that @xmath81 . + in order to get the standard expression for larmor precession , we will first set @xmath82 in eqs.([repsi - t]),([impsi - t ] ) , ( [ repsi+t ] ) , and ( [ impsi+t ] ) except when they appear inside sine or cosine functions , since the latter terms are much more sensitive to the differences in values of @xmath80 . eqs .",
    "( [ repsi - t ] ) and ( [ impsi - t ] ) then simplify to @xmath83 @xmath84 using the above expressions in eqs .",
    "( [ c ] ) and ( [ d ] ) , we find that @xmath85 and @xmath86 . similarly , rewriting equations ( [ repsi+t ] ) and ( [ impsi+t ] ) , and using it in eq.([finalwfn ] ) and ( [ d ] ) , we get @xmath87 and @xmath88 . therefore eq.(14 ) now has the form @xmath89 since we have already stipulated the condition @xmath81 , we can binomially expand @xmath65 and @xmath66 around @xmath11 and keep terms to the order of @xmath90",
    ". then @xmath91 . using the relations @xmath62 and @xmath47 , we can write @xmath92 . similarly , @xmath93",
    ". therefore , we can write eq.([psiwfn1 ] ) as @xmath94 which is exactly the equation we get from the spin - only treatment of the problem .    the above treatment brings out the curious feature that while the standard treatment ignores the kinetic energy term of the hamiltonian , on solving the problem in a more complete manner , the same expression can be derived in the other extreme limit where the kinetic energy term is much higher than the spin - magnetic field interaction energy term .",
    "in the previous section we have shown that it is only when the kinetic energy associated with the wave function is much larger than the potential energy term in the hamiltonian , in other words , the height of the potential barrier , or the depth of the potential well , we get back the standard expression for larmor precession",
    ". however , when the kinetic energy term becomes comparable to the potential energy term due to the spin - magnetic field interaction , the standard expression no longer holds . in this section",
    "we calculate the effect of this deviation in terms of an observable , given by , in our case , the number of particles measured to be along @xmath95 when the state emerging from the region of the magnetic field is passed through a stern - gerlach arrangement which is oriented at an angle @xmath96 with respect to the @xmath0 axis .",
    "the state @xmath95 is defined in the following manner @xmath97 the spin part of our original wavefunction is given by @xmath98 . according to the standard treatment of larmor precession ,",
    "the final spin state is given by latexmath:[$\\chi ( \\phi)=1/{\\sqrt{2}}~\\left(|\\uparrow { \\rangle}_z + e^{i \\phi }    the particles with @xmath95 is given by    @xmath100    however , in the light of the complete treatment presented in the last section , the final spin part of the wave function is given by eq .",

    "we shall study the condition when they will be same . in the table given below , we compare the values of @xmath103 and @xmath104 for @xmath105 for different regimes of the velocity of the incident neutrons and the strength of the applied magnetic field .",
    "we can see clearly from the results given in the tables 1 and 2 that when the incident velocity of the neutrons , or their kinetic energy is large , and the magnetic field is weak , @xmath103 and @xmath106 are the same .",
    "however , on increasing the strength of the magnetic field , or decreasing the velocity of the incident neutrons , there is an empirically verifiable difference between @xmath103 and @xmath106 .    .",
    "table 1 : this table shows the numerical values of @xmath103 and @xmath106 for a fixed magnetic field , in this case , 2 t , while decreasing the velocity of the incident neutrons . for thermal neutrons , we see that the two are the same , while differences start arising for cold neutrons and this difference is appreciable for ultra - cold neutrons .

    "cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we will now use the results derived above to analyse the spin distribution which arises due to spin - magnetic field interaction when a wave packet passes through the spin rotator arrangement . for this purpose",
    ", we use a gaussian wave packet as the space part of our initial wave function , instead of a plane wave as was used in sections ii and iii .",
    "we choose the spin - polarization of the initial wave function to be in the @xmath8 direction , and the magnetic field to be pointing along the @xmath16 direction .",
    "thus our initial wave function is given by @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the initial peak of the wavepacket , @xmath109 is the peak wave - number and @xmath110 is the width of the initial wavepacket . in the previous section",
    "we have seen that the precession of spin caused by interaction with the magnetic field within a spin rotator of given parameters is a function only of @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , while dealing with the gaussian wave packet , it is convenient to use the fourier transform of the initial wave function , given by @xmath111 using results from the previous section , we can then write the final wave function in the fourier basis to be @xmath112 where @xmath113 are as defined in eqs .",
    "( 15),(16),(17 ) , and ( 18 ) , and hence have different values for different values of @xmath11 . from the above equation ,",
    "it becomes clear that we have a spin distribution which occurs as a result of the spin - magnetic field interaction of different wave - number components of the original wave packet .",
    "we will now find the distribution of spins along @xmath114 or the @xmath8 direction .",
    "the projection of the spin of the final wave function along this direction is given by @xmath115 therefore , the probability of finding spins along the @xmath8 direction will be given by @xmath116 such a spin probability function can be measured by a stern gerlach arrangement for the particles emerging from the spin rotator . a crucial feature to be stressed here is that the above spin probability function given by eq .",
    "( 33 ) has been obtained from our complete treatment of the problem of time evolution of the spin of a particle passing through a region of uniform magnetic field . on the other hand",
    ", the counterpart of such a spin probability distribution can also be obtained from the standard treatment of larmor precession .",
    "a comparison between the results obtained from these two different approaches for various values of the magnetic field and velocity of the incident neutrons is illustrated in figures 1 and 2 .",
    "as similar to the case of the plane wave , we notice that the distributions from the two different approaches overlap when the incident velocity of the neutrons is high and the magnetic field is weak , whereas a noticeable divergence appears upon either decreasing the incident velocity or increasing the strength of the magnetic field .",
    "in a nutshell , the central result of the present paper is that the standard expression for larmor precession holds true only in the regime where the kinetic energy of the system is much greater as compared to the potential energy term arising out of the interaction between the spin of the particle and the magnetic field .",
    "it is essentially when these two terms become comparable that the departure from the standard expression for larmor precession becomes appreciable to the extent of being empirically observable - such a departure can indeed be tested by choosing appropriate conditions of high magnetic field and low velocity of incident neutrons ; for example , in the experiments using cold neutrons .    an important application of the above treatment is that it enables the construction of an effective transit time distribution for a spin - polarised wave packet passing through a region of uniform magnetic field , of course , subject to the constraint of choosing the relevant parameters appropriately such that the rotation of spin pertaining to any wave - number component of the wavepacket does not exceed @xmath117 .",
    "a rigorous derivation of the spin probability distribution emerging from a spin rotator is , therefore , a key ingredient for using larmor precession in the context of its applicability as a model for quantum clock @xcite that can be used for measuring arrival / transit time distributions , and for making a quantitative study of the possible differences in the predictions obtained from the different quantum mechanical schemes suggested for computing arrival / transit time distributions@xcite .",
    "further studies along this line using the exact formula for larmor precession derived in this paper are thus called for , the results of which could also be useful for comparing with other models for quantum clock suggested in the literature@xcite .    among other possible uses of the exact formula for larmor precession in the context of recent significant experiments , here we may mention , for example , the neutron ineterferometric experiment@xcite testing single particle bell s inequality @xciteinvolving entanglement between the path and the spin degrees of freedom of a spin-1/2 particle . in such an experiment , the spin flipper that is placed in one of the two paths of the interferometer plays a crucial role for generating the path - spin entangled state , in the sense that the spin flipper is ideally required to flip all the neutrons passing through it , so that the flipped state and the unflipped spin state in the respective two paths are completely orthogonal .",
    "in order to ensure this condition , the choice of the relevant parameters has to be carefully made on the basis of an appropriate formula for larmor precession .",
    "usually this is done by using the standard larmor formula , as in the above mentioned experiment@xcite .",
    "it is in this context that the exact formula for larmor precession obtained in this paper should be of particular significance .",
    "for example , in the analysis of the above experiment , one needs to study the quantitative impact on the amount of violation of single particle bell s inequality arising from the rigorous treatment of larmor precession given in this paper .",
