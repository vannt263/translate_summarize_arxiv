    "international linear collider ( ilc )  @xcite is a future @xmath5 collider experiment for the precise measurement and the validation of the standard model ( sm ) physics , especially for the measurement of the higgs boson property , even the discovery of the higgs boson will be realized in large hadron collider ( lhc ) experiment . in the sm , light higgs boson mass ( @xmath6 )",
    "is predicted the range of @xmath7 from the study in large electron positron collider ( lep ii )  @xcite and recently tevatron experiments exclude the higgs mass range around @xmath8 with the 95% confidence level  @xcite . from these results ,",

    "since hadron collider experiments have large qcd multi - jet backgrounds , the measurement of the light mass higgs will not prefer in terms of the signal to noise ratio , ilc experiment has an advantage for precise measurement of light higgs boson with large signal yield of multi - jet final state in lower background environment .",
    "therefore , precise measurement of the light mass higgs ( @xmath11 ) will be a primary target of the ilc experiment . at the lower center - of - mass energy ( @xmath12 ) range around the production threshold , as shown in fig  [ fig : zh_xsec ] , sm higgs boson is mainly produced through the higgs - strahlung ( @xmath13 ) process , which associated with the @xmath14 boson as shown in fig .",
