    "<S> an attempt to study the feasibility of a new experiment to search for double beta decay in @xmath0sn and @xmath1sn was carried out by using ultra - low background hpge detector ( 244 @xmath2 ) inside the gran sasso national laboratory ( lngs ) of the infn ( italy ) . </S>",
    "<S> a small sample of natural sn was examined for 2367.5 h. the radioactive contamination of the sample has been estimated . </S>",
    "<S> the data has also been considered to calculate the present sensitivity for the proposed search ; half - life limits @xmath3 @xmath4 years for @xmath5ec and ec - ec processes in @xmath0sn and @xmath3 @xmath6 years for @xmath7 transition in @xmath1sn were measured . in the last section of the paper </S>",
    "<S> the enhancement of the sensitivity for a proposed experiment with larger mass to reach theoretically estimated values of half - lives is discussed .    </S>",
