    "solutions to the einstein field equations with anisotropic matter , where the radial component of the pressure is not the same as the tangential component , have been studied by a variety of investigators in recent years .",
    "such solutions are important in physics as they may be used to model anisotropic stars where a static spherically symmetric interior is matched to the schwarzschild exterior model .",
    "these include the treatments of dev and gleiser @xcite , herrera _",
    "@xcite , ivanov @xcite , mak and harko @xcite and sharma and mukherjee @xcite . as pointed out in these analyses anisotropy can not be neglected when studying the critical mass and redshift of highly compact bodies , and may be an intrinsic component of boson stars and strange stars .    in generating exact models describing anisotropic matter distributions",
    "ad hoc assumptions are normally made about the forms of the matter variables or gravitational potentials . in an attempt to systematically generate exact solutions maharaj and maartens",
    "@xcite proposed an algorithm in which the field equations are written as a first order system of differential equations .",
    "the energy density and radial pressure are then chosen on physical grounds ; the remaining variables then follow from the field equations .",
    "the maharaj and maartens algorithm has been used by gokhroo and mehra @xcite , chaisi and maharaj @xcite amongst others to produce physically reasonable anisotropic stars .",
    "however these models have the feature that the anisotropy factor is nonzero in the interior of the star and an isotropic solution can not be regained .",
    "the objective of this paper is to provide a new algorithm that may be used to systematically produce anisotropic solutions to the einstein field equations from a given isotropic solution .",
    "this solution generating algorithm has the desirable property of yielding a new exact anisotropic model which includes an isotropic solution , unlike the earlier algorithm of maharaj and maartens .",
    "the new solutions obtained are members of a one parameter family containing the isotropic case .",
    "we illustrate the utility of the algorithm with two examples that are physically relevant , the isothermal sphere and the constant density schwarzschild sphere .",
    "the principal objective of this paper is to show that we can generate anisotropic relativistic stars from a specified seed isotropic star . in section [ sec : fieldeqns ]",
    ", we describe the basic features of the model for a relativistic anisotropic star , and present the differential equations , as a first order system , governing the gravitational field . the algorithm that produces a new anisotropic solution from a seed isotropic solution",

    "the details of the integration process for the second example is given in the appendix for convenience .",
    "for both examples we study in brief the profile of the anisotropy factor . in section [ sec : disc ] , we briefly indicate that the solutions found can be related to stellar models used in astronomy .",
    "we utilise a representation of the field equations in which only first order derivatives appear .",
    "this helps to simplify the integration process as pointed out by chaisi and maharaj @xcite whose notation and conventions we follow .",

    "suppose an explicit solution to ( [ efes ] ) is known where @xmath24 and the functions @xmath25 are explicitly given .",
