    "chirality , the breaking of mirror symmetry , occurs at many length scales , from nanometer - sized dna to the coiled form of gastropod snails at various sizes  @xcite . in soft matter",
    ", microscopic chirality can alter numerous macroscopic properties of materials .",
    "for example , in chiral smectic liquid crystals grain boundaries form above a critical temperature to alleviate the frustration between the layer formation and the twist tendency of the chiral molecules  @xcite .",
    "this is analogous to the penetration of magnetic field lines into superconductors by creating a lattice of parallel vortices  @xcite .",
    "based on this analogy , smectic @xmath1 samples maintain twist- and bend - free molecular orientations within each layer by the expulsion of these deformations to the edges or around isolated defects , similar to the well - known meissner effect in superconductors  @xcite .",
    "one realization of this analogy is a model system of two dimensional colloidal membranes composed of aligned rods , which behave as a single layer of a chiral smectic a ( sm-@xmath3 ) liquid crystal .",
    "monodisperse suspensions of the 880 nm long , rodlike wild - type @xmath0 viruses are spontaneously condensed into these one rod length thick colloidal monolayers with free edges by attractive depletion forces  @xcite .",
    "the penetration of twist at the monolayer edge could be directly observed , allowing for the confirmation of the de gennes theory  @xcite .",
    "recently , it was reported that the line tension of the monolayer edge , an important variable relevant to the formation energy of the free boundaries , can be controlled _ in situ _ by the chirality of rods  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it was found that monolayers which consist of achiral rods still possessed twist deformations at the edge .",
    "a curved edge profile was observed , which was robust for the entire range of measured line tension values .    by changing the line tension ,",
    "colloidal sm-@xmath3 membranes can easily be induced to exhibit morphological transitions  @xcite .",
    "one way to achieve this is the coalescence of two or more membranes .",
    "when two membranes are surrounded by the edges with same handedness , the molecular twist localized at the edge poses a problem for the coalescence , as the direction of twist will be in opposite directions where the two edges meet .",
    "the final structure adopts a one - dimensional line defect between the two coalesced membranes when the sizes of the two membranes are comparable to each other . in order for the molecular arrangement across the defect to be continuous",
    ", the rods must twist by @xmath2 radians .",
    "henceforth we will refer to these lines of twist as @xmath2-walls .",
    "these can also be imprinted in the monolayers using optical forces  @xcite .",
    "@xmath2-walls resemble various other phenomena observed in condensed matter systems .",
    "for instance , they are analogous to a laminar model of an array of alternating normal metal and superconducting regions , which was replaced by the abrikosov flux - lattice phase in type - ii materials  @xcite . furthermore , the pitch associated with the helicity of a cholesteric sample can be unwound by electric and magnetic fields , creating similar twist walls in the vicinity of the critical field  @xcite .",
    "another example is magnetic systems , where the rotation of spin magnetic moments in space cause resembling domains called bloch walls  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we extend the analysis of the theory , first proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath2-walls , to the free edge of the colloidal monolayer .",
    "our approach treats the monolayers as a binary liquid of sm-@xmath3 , where the rods are aligned parallel to the layer normal , and a cholesteric ( chiral nematic ",
    "@xmath4 ) region , which the sm-@xmath3 order melts into both at the monolayer free edge and the @xmath2-wall . by introducing an order parameter field which is proportional to the local sm-@xmath3 concentration , this framework couples the smectic order within the monolayer and the orientation of the nematic director field of the constituent molecules where the elastic distortions are pronounced .",
    "our approach is reminiscent of the landau - ginzburg formalism of smectics put forward by de gennes  @xcite , although in the colloidal membranes there is no discrete translational symmetry as in a layered sm-@xmath3 material .",
    "thus , we replace the conventional smectic order parameter , which preserves the translational symmetry via a complex number , by a real order parameter in our analysis , which solely accounts for the local concentration of the regions of perfectly aligned rods within the monolayer .",
    "henceforth , a chiral smectic @xmath1 monolayer , which lacks the mass - density wave of a layered smectic , shall be understood by the abbreviation `` sm-@xmath3 . '' in the present work , the effect of the depleting agent , _",
    "i.e. _ the nonadsorbing polymer , is modeled by appropriate surface tension terms , and plays a crucial role in determining the structure of the monolayer edge and the @xmath2-walls .",
    "we perform a mean - field analysis of our model to calculate the thickness , tilt angle , and the smectic order parameter profiles of the @xmath2-walls and the free edges .",
    "these profiles reveal a sm-@xmath3-to-@xmath4 transition at both types of interfaces , as observed in experiments .",
    "we examine the effect of the dimensionless parameters in our model on the profiles , in order to determine the relevant parameters which induce pronounced changes in the results .",
    "overall we find that our theory is robust within a reasonable range of all free parameters .",
    "this allows us to obtain the best fit of the tilt angle profile and the thickness to the experimental measurements at the free edge and the @xmath2-wall .",
    "furthermore , we calculate the line tension of the membrane edge and the @xmath2-wall as a function of the molecular chirality , or equivalently temperature  @xcite , in order to match them with experimental measurements . accordingly , we investigate the thermodynamic stability of these structures with respect to each other .    the present study is organized as follows : in the next section , based on experimental evidence , we explain the hypothesized structures of the membrane edge and the @xmath2-wall ( sec .",

    "[ subsec : experimentalcomparison ] is devoted to the comparison of the theoretical profiles with the experimental analysis of the interfacial structure .",
    "in addition , we calculate the line tension of the free edge and the @xmath2-wall as a function of temperature and discuss the relative thermodynamic stability of the @xmath2-walls with respect to the monolayer edge . concluding remarks are offered in the final section of the paper .",
    "disk - shaped assemblages of @xmath0-viruses typically reach mesoscopic sizes in diameter  @xcite . because of the tendency of monodisperse hard rods to build a one - rod - length thick flat monolayer , sm-@xmath3 membranes do not support molecular twist and bend deformations and thus expel them to the edge ( figs .",
    "[ fig : monolayer]a ,  [ fig : monolayer]b )  @xcite .",
    "this constraint is mediated by the depletion interactions between the rods and the depletant polymer . by contrast , in a conventional smectic-@xmath1 material , the exclusion of twist and bend deformations in the ground state is a natural consequence of constant distance everywhere between two adjacent layers . in general , bend deformations of the molecules localized at the edge are negligible as the rod length is much smaller than the monolayer radius .",
    "when @xmath5 and @xmath6 , the contribution @xmath7 of molecular bend to the line tension scales as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the bend elastic constant , @xmath10 is the average membrane thickness where the bend distortions occur , @xmath11 is the penetration depth of the bend deformations at the edge , and @xmath12 is the radius of the monolayer . since the rods are perfectly aligned in the bulk , the membrane interior appears black when viewed under 2d lc - polscope , corresponding to no birefringence ( fig .",
    "[ fig : monolayer]c )  @xcite . towards the edge , however , optical anisotropy arising from the twist deformations results in a bright , birefringent region characterized by a retardance , r , which is given by ( fig .",
    "[ fig : monolayer]d )    @xmath13    here @xmath14 is the local membrane thickness . @xmath15ml / mg is the specific birefringence of a fully aligned bulk sample at unit concentration  @xcite .",
    "the nematic order parameter @xmath16 was measured to be 0.95 at a rod concentration @xmath17 of 100 mg / ml in the bulk monolayer  @xcite .",
    "therefore we assume that @xmath18 , namely there is perfect orientational order  @xcite .",
    "@xmath19 is the tilt angle of the molecules with respect to the layer normal .    to quantify the retardance ,",
    "a simple model focusing on the spatial variation of the nematic director was proposed  @xcite .",
    "this model neglects the variation of the thickness and smectic order across the monolayer . for chiral membranes",
    ", the theory accurately reproduces the experimental retardance profile .",
    "however , as evidenced by their retardance map , achiral monolayers exhibit twist at the edge as well , spontaneously breaking the chiral symmetry at the membrane edge  @xcite . furthermore , electron micrographs of the membrane edge cross - section reveal a curved thickness profile and melting of the smectic order into a narrow @xmath4 band at the edge . in fig .",
    "[ fig : monolayer]e , the rods are seen to be perfectly aligned in the @xmath20-direction in the bulk of the monolayer . towards the edge , the rods tilt rapidly such that they point perpendicular to the image plane , forming a @xmath4 region with a hemi - toroidal curved shape at the edge .",
    "this @xmath4 band constitutes the core of the @xmath2-wall as well , since a @xmath2-wall is formed from two free edges of same handedness ( fig .",
    "[ fig : linedefect]a ) . therefore , we model the @xmath2-wall by a @xmath4 region sandwiched between two semi - infinite sm-@xmath3 monolayers ( figs .  [",
    "fig : linedefect]c ,  [ fig : linedefect]d ) .",
    "@xmath2-walls are linear defects , thereby their liquid crystalline order does not possess any bend deformations .",
    "the in - plane curvature of a @xmath2-wall is always vanishingly small compared to the edge curvature of a monolayer membrane  @xcite .",
    "thus , the contribution of the bending term to the line tension of the @xmath2-walls is negligible , thereby not affecting their stability .",
    "as for their cross - sectional shape , the effect of the thickness variation is anticipated to be more prominent at the @xmath2-walls : an intensity profile having a local minimum located between two peaks is extracted from retardance measurements ( figs .",
    "[ fig : linedefect]b ,  [ fig : linedefect]e ) .",
    "we hypothesize that this local minimum indicates a significant variation of the membrane thickness across the @xmath2-wall .",
    "the presence of the depleting agent results in an effective surface tension over the membrane surface .",
    "when a single molecule protrudes from the monolayer , it reduces the accessible volume of the surrounding depletant polymer .",
    "both in experiments and simulations , it was found that protrusion fluctuations are significant in sm-@xmath3 membranes , and stabilize this phase against the configuration where single disks stack up on top of each other and form a layered sm-@xmath3 structure  @xcite .",
    "in addition , spontaneous twist at the edge of achiral monolayers is understood as an outcome of the surface tension : compared to an untilted edge configuration , the monolayer may reduce the rod - polymer interfacial area despite resulting in an elastic energy associated with twist deformations  @xcite .",
    "this configuration lowers the total surface energy of the membrane , especially if the surface tension continuosly varies throughout the monolayer and becomes bigger at the edge than in the bulk , due to the changing rod orientation .",
    "this scenario will be discussed below .",
    "hence , a curved edge shape is favored when surface tension becomes dominant in determining the structure of the monolayer edge . in previous theories ,",
    "the thickness variation , as well as the @xmath4-band formation , were not taken into account , resulting in a line tension which is low by an order of magnitude in comparison to experimental results  @xcite .",

    "these recent experimental findings are beyond the scope of the simple model proposed in ref .",
    "thus , in addition to the spatial change of the molecular tilt @xmath19 , a detailed theory should account for the local thickness variation @xmath14 and the crossover from sm-@xmath3-to-@xmath4 behavior @xmath22 across the monolayer and the @xmath2-wall , in order to correctly predict their structure as well as the magnitude and the behavior of the line tension .    for a bulk sm-@xmath3 sample ,",
    "@xmath22 is defined as the thermodynamic average of the amplitude of a periodic mass - density wave , which preserves the discrete translational symmetry in the direction locally parallel to the normal vector of the layers .",
    "a colloidal monolayer composed of rod - like particles lacks this symmetry .",
    "however , towards the edge monolayers exhibit a clear transition from an ordered phase where the molecules are aligned along the layer normal , to a @xmath4 region in which the molecules satisfy the chiral interactions",

    "<S> monodisperse suspensions of rodlike chiral @xmath0 viruses are condensed into a rod - length thick colloidal monolayers of aligned rods by depletion forces . </S>",
    "<S> twist deformations of the molecules are expelled to the monolayer edge as in a chiral smectic @xmath1 liquid crystal , and a cholesteric band forms at the edge . </S>",
    "<S> coalescence of two such isolated membranes results in a twist wall sandwiched between two regions of aligned rods , dubbed @xmath2-walls . by modeling the membrane as a binary fluid of coexisting cholesteric and chiral smectic @xmath1 liquid - crystalline regions , </S>",
    "<S> we develop a unified theory of the @xmath2-walls and the monolayer edge . </S>",
    "<S> the mean - field analysis of our model yields the molecular tilt profiles , the local thickness change , and the crossover from smectic to cholesteric behavior at the monolayer edge and across the @xmath2-wall . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we calculate the line tension associated with the formation of these interfaces . our model offers insights regarding the stability and the detailed structure of the @xmath2- wall and the monolayer edge . </S>"
