    "much progress has been made in recent decades in understanding the relationship between star formation rate ( sfr ) surface density ( @xmath5 ) and gas surface density ( @xmath6 ) in nearby star - forming spiral galaxies , and this work has been used to infer the physical basis of the star formation law ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "in contrast , less is known about the connection between @xmath10 and star formation in early - type galaxies . the good correlation between the morphologies of molecular gas , 24@xmath11 m emission , and radio continuum in local e / s0s hints that there is a relationship between @xmath12 and @xmath5 @xcite . in a single - dish survey of co emission in sauron e / s0s ,",
    "@xcite find that their galaxies follow the @xmath13 disk - averaged power law , characteristic of spirals @xcite .",
    "using multiple star - formation tracers , @xcite find a similar result for a sample of 12 e / s0s , although possibly at lower total - gas star formation efficiencies ( tsfe @xmath14 sfr/@xmath15 ) .",
    "@xcite update the @xcite results with spatially resolved maps , localizing both co emission and star formation in the central regions of the galaxies and finding @xmath5 , @xmath16 , and molecular - gas star formation efficiency ( msfe @xmath14 sfr/@xmath17 ) values similar to those of spirals . however , spatially resolved studies of the h@xmath4-star formation relation at sub - kpc resolution similar to the analyses of @xcite and @xcite have yet to be done for e / s0s .",
    "recent work has identified a local population of star - forming e / s0s that reside alongside spirals on the blue sequence in color vs. stellar mass space ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter kgb ) .",
    "the fraction of e / s0s on the blue sequence increases with decreasing mass , from @xmath18 at stellar mass @xmath19 , up to @xmath20 for @xmath21 ( 2% and 5% , respectively , of all galaxies in these mass ranges ; ) .",
    "high - mass blue - sequence e / s0s are often young major - merger remnants that will fade to the red sequence ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "low - mass blue - sequence e / s0s , in contrast , appear more settled , occupying low - density field environments where gas accretion is likely .",
    "this population may reflect the transformation of `` red and dead '' e / s0s into spirals via inner- and outer - disk regrowth .",
    "argue that many blue - sequence e / s0s occupy a `` sweet spot '' in @xmath22 and stellar concentration index , characterized by abundant gas and bursty , efficient ( when time - averaged over multiple bursts ) star formation , which may enable efficient disk building ( see also  [ section.discussion ] ) .",
    "@xcite confirm that blue - sequence e / s0s have fractionally large atomic gas reservoirs , comparable to those of spirals ( 0.11.0 , relative to @xmath22 ) .",
    "the ongoing star formation and large gas reservoirs of these galaxies make them ideal for probing the spatially resolved relationship between @xmath9 and @xmath5 in e / s0s , offering unique insight into whether / how some e / s0s may be actively evolving via bursty , efficient star formation .",
    "our parent sample of 32 galaxies consists of all e / s0s ( 14 blue- , 2 mid- , and 11 red - sequence ) with @xmath23 from the nearby field galaxy survey ( nfgs , @xcite ) , and an additional five blue - sequence e / s0s in the same mass range ( see ) .",
    "the sample was defined for _ spitzer _ and _ galex _ programs go-30406 and gi3 - 046012 ( pi kannappan ) , so all galaxies have new or archival fuv and 24@xmath11 m data for sfr estimation .",
    "of the parent sample , we observed 23 e / s0s in co(10 ) with the combined array for research in millimeter - wave astronomy ( carma ) , detecting 12 of 23 . in this letter , we focus on the 12 e / s0s with carma detections and 7 additional e / s0s with iram 30 m observations ( five detections , two limits ) in co(10 ) .",
    "these 19 e / s0s sample a large range ( table  [ table.global ] ) in color and stellar mass ( figure  [ fig.sample ] ) , h@xmath4/hi mass ratio ( 0.0063.2 ) , and total gas - to - stellar mass ratio ( 0.073.4 ) .",
    "the carma maps have beam sizes of 2@xmath244@xmath24 , with velocity coverage of 300450 @xmath25 and resolution of @xmath32.5 @xmath25 .",
    "we reduced the data with the miriad package @xcite , using natural weighting .",

    "the carma and _ galex _ data sets were convolved with a kernel that reproduce the mips 24@xmath11 m psf ( @xmath27 @xmath28 ; @xcite ) exactly in the carma/_galex _ images , including the airy ring , which is @xmath29 of the @xmath30 . for our pixel - to - pixel analysis in  [ section.pixels ] , we further convolve our data to a resolution of 750pc ( 6.1@xmath2415.3@xmath24 ) for comparison with @xcite .",
    "all maps are at least nyquist - sampled .",
    "we estimate @xmath31 and @xmath32 following @xcite :    @xmath33    @xmath34    assuming a co - to - h@xmath35 conversion factor ( @xmath36 ) of @xmath37 .",
    "our estimates of @xmath12 do not include helium ; however , helium is included in estimates of molecular gas depletion time .",
    "equation [ eq.sfr ] uses the broken power law initial mass function given by @xcite .",
    "our procedures for calculating @xmath31 and @xmath32 are identical to those of @xcite after their conversion from co(21 ) to co(10 ) ( @xmath38/@xmath39 ) , ensuring a fair comparison between the two data sets .",
    "agn contamination is not an issue for the 750pc resolution analysis , as any agn contribution in the infrared would be contained within the central resolution element .",

    ", irac color - color diagnostics @xcite suggest that ( possible ) agn contributions to the integrated infrared emission in our galaxies are relatively weak , as the removal of the central resolution element does not significantly affect their positions in the infrared color - color diagram .",
    "following @xcite , we estimate possible 24@xmath11 m emission contamination from passively evolving stellar populations to be @xmath408% for our e / s0s .",
    "figure  [ fig.ks_pixels ] plots the pixel - to - pixel relationship between @xmath5 and @xmath12 for the eight of our 19 galaxies resolved on 750pc scales .",
    "we also include the 750pc resolution data for the seven spirals observed by @xcite as light blue dots .",
    "the vertical dashed lines demarcate the three different star formation regimes discussed by @xcite : hi - dominated , giant molecular cloud ( gmc)/disk , and starburst .",
    "figure  [ fig.ks_pixels ] shows that all but two of the eight galaxies have some regions that fall within the gmc / disk regime , with two blue- and one mid - sequence e / s0s ( ngc  3032 , ugc  6570 , and ugc  7020a ) having the majority of their points in this regime .",
    "we fit the @xmath31@xmath32 relationship with a power - law of the form    @xmath41    in log - log space using the ordinary least - squares ( ols ) bisector method ( solid line in figure  [ fig.ks_pixels ] ) and list the fit parameters in table [ table.ksfits ] , using coefficient @xmath42 .",
    "note that we set the intercept of our fit at log@xmath43(@xmath44 ) , where @xmath44 is the median @xmath31 for each galaxy , to lessen the effect of the covariance between @xmath45 and @xmath46 . the power - law index _",
    "n _ ranges from 0.62 to 1.92 , with a median of @xmath47 .",
    "it is evident that the majority of e / s0s in figure  [ fig.ks_pixels ] exhibit a power - law relation between @xmath31 and @xmath48 , all the way down to the hi - dominated regime .",
    "figure  [ fig.ks_pixels ] also plots ( dotted ) lines of constant msfe with @xmath49 , defined as the inverse of the molecular gas depletion time @xmath17/sfr , and illustrates variations in @xmath45 and @xmath50/@xmath51 . for blue- and mid - sequence e / s0s , we find that as msfe increases , @xmath45 seems to steepen and @xmath50/@xmath52 seems to decrease .",
    "we find a wider range of msfes ( 4%70% ) compared to the 3%8% found by @xcite .",
    "we discuss whether msfe truly measures molecular - gas star formation _",
    "efficiency _ in  [ section.discussion ] .",
    "in figure [ fig.ks_global ] , we show the 18 kpc aperture - averaged relationship between @xmath53 and @xmath5 for the eight e / s0s of figure [ fig.ks_pixels ] plus 11 more blue - sequence e / s0s with carma detections and/or iram observations , as well as for normal spiral - disk and starburst galaxies @xcite and sauron e / s0s @xcite . with the exception of kennicutt s normal disk points ,",
    "all the other points in figure  [ fig.ks_global ] show the surface densities within regions of star formation or molecular gas .",
    "the starbursts were averaged over `` the radius of the starburst region '' determined from co / infrared imaging @xcite , and the sauron e / s0s were averaged over the extent of the star - forming region defined by 8@xmath11 m pah emission @xcite . for our 19 e / s0s ,",
    "we average @xmath50 and sfr over an area with radius ( @xmath54 ) twice the scale length of the 24@xmath11 m emission , where the flux drops by e@xmath55 from the peak .",
    "this area encompasses most of the flux in co , 24@xmath11 m , and fuv , and corresponds well to the visual impression of the extent of co emission for most galaxies .",
    "note that the dots from @xcite plotted in the background for reference are _ local _",
    "( 750pc ) measures of @xmath31 and @xmath32 as in figure  [ fig.ks_pixels ] .",
    "in contrast , the @xcite spiral disk points are averaged over @xmath56 , which may dilute the values of @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "we infer this from radial profiles of normal spirals in @xcite , which indicate that h@xmath4 typically extends out to only @xmath57 .",
    "thus the surface densities calculated by @xcite for spiral disks should for consistency move up along lines of constant msfe by @xmath30.62 dex ( grey arrow in figure  [ fig.ks_global ] ) .",
    "comparison of these data sets reveals that the aperture - averaged @xmath58 and @xmath32 for our 19 e / s0s overlap the range spanned by spiral disks , with six of the carma - detected e / s0s having sufficiently high surface densities to occupy the same space where @xcite finds the _ centers _ of spirals lie  between normal disks and starburst galaxies ( not shown in figure  [ fig.ks_global ] , as @xcite tabulates only combined hi+h@xmath4 data for galaxy centers ) .",
    "our e / s0s also appear to span the same range as the typically more massive sauron e / s0s .",
    "figure  [ fig.ks_global ] also shows a similarly large spread in aperture - averaged msfes as seen for local msfes in  [ section.pixels ] , with over half of the carma - detected and all of the 30@xmath59m - observed e / s0s ( all blue- or mid - sequence ) offset towards apparently higher msfes ( @xmath6010% ) compared to the typical spirals from @xcite .",
    "equivalently , the molecular gas depletion times for our e / s0s range from 2.3 down to 0.1gyr , with a median of 0.5gyr  lower than that of the @xcite spirals .",
    "additionally , the offset towards apparently higher msfes is seen in both the carma and iram 30 m galaxies in figure  [ fig.ks_global ] , so it is not specific to interferometric data .",
    "we have shown above that the relationship between molecular gas and star formation in low - mass e / s0s ( @xmath61 ) resolved at 750pc is similar to that for spirals , with a roughly linear correlation between @xmath31 and @xmath62 all the way down to the hi - dominated regime .",
    "this suggests that star formation occurs in h@xmath4 and not hi , similar to what @xcite find for spirals .",
    "one intriguing difference is the apparently elevated msfes of our e / s0s compared to the msfes of the bigiel spirals . _ star formation efficiency _",
    ", however , may be a misnomer in some cases , as other factors may contribute to the observed offsets .",
    "one possible cause for apparently elevated msfes is that the co may not trace all of the h@xmath4 in these galaxies , as many are low - mass systems where @xmath36 may be variable ( e.g. , @xcite ) . @xcite",
    "finds a similar scatter in msfes for low - luminosity ( @xmath63 ) disk galaxies , which he attributes to variation in @xmath36 , possibly due to low metallicities .",
    "recent _ herschel _ results support this , finding evidence for excess cold dust that is not well - traced by co in low - mass galaxies @xcite",
    ". however , metallicity measurements ( available for 5/6 carma - detected and 3/7 iram - observed galaxies offset towards higher msfes ) indicate that these galaxies are well within the range ( @xmath641/4@xmath65 ) where much work suggests that @xmath36 is similar to that assumed here ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a second explanation is that some of these galaxies are advanced , h@xmath4-depleted starbursts , where the delay between h@xmath4 exhaustion and fading of star - formation tracers associated with young , massive stars gives the _ appearance _ of elevated msfes .",
    "thus the possible correlation between elevated msfe , lower @xmath66/@xmath51 , and steeper ( higher @xmath45 ) slopes in the schmidt - kennicutt relation found in  [ section.pixels ] may reflect the depletion of h@xmath4 in the later stages of star formation , in good agreement with simulations that predict steeper schmidt - kennicutt relations and higher msfes as the molecular gas fraction decreases @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with studies of ngc  1569 , a post - starburst dwarf irregular ( e.g. , @xcite ) that also appears to have an elevated msfe @xcite .",
    "a third possibility is that the observed offsets may reflect truly enhanced msfes .",
    "@xcite , updating @xcite , find that the fractional gas content of galaxies abruptly rises below a gas - richness threshold mass of @xmath67@xmath68 , roughly corresponding to internal velocities of @xmath3120 kms@xmath69 ( see also ) .",
    "this is the same velocity threshold below which the physics of star formation may change due to possibly increased gas accretion , outflow , and metal loss from shallower potentials @xcite . while the _ total _ sfes of dwarf galaxies are low compared to those of normal star - forming spirals ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , recent simulations suggest that gas - rich and/or lower metallicity galaxies deviate from the schmidt - kennicutt relationship towards higher _ molecular _ sfes @xcite .",
    "these predictions are supported by observations of local dwarfs , which find high msfes in ic  10 and m33 compared to nearby spirals @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon could contribute to the scatter in msfes observed by @xcite , as @xmath70 roughly corresponds to the gas - richness threshold mass .",
    "similarly , the two sauron e / s0s in figure  [ fig.ks_global ] with the highest msfes are low - luminosity systems with @xmath71 .",
    "unlike previous studies of star formation in blue e / s0s , our sample focuses on galaxies below the gas - richness threshold mass ( 13 of our 19 e / s0s ) . at higher stellar masses , agn and strong starbursts",
    "are observed to dominate the blue e / s0 population ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is not inconsistent with the nature of our six higher - mass e / s0s ( three known / candidate agns and two likely starbursts due to their large distances and the resulting poor resolution of the central region , but their nuclear ew(h@xmath72 ) emission measurements ( 86 and 76 , respectively ) and very blue - centered color gradients suggest recent / ongoing central starbursts . ] ) .",
    "our results suggest that ( possibly milder ) bursts likely play a key role for lower - mass e / s0s as well .",
    "the variation of msfe in this scenario has implications for our understanding ( and theoretical simulations ) of low - mass galaxy evolution .",
    "the dynamical timescales for gas inflow typical for our sample ( 0.060.4 gyr ; @xcite ) are short compared to the molecular gas consumption times we find here ( 0.12.3 gyr ) , which suggests that refueling of h@xmath4 from the hi reservoir to sustain star formation is limited only by the frequency of minor mergers / interactions that trigger gas inflow . if apparently elevated msfes reflect advanced , h@xmath4-depleted bursts , the fact that 15 of our 19 e / s0s have msfe @xmath6010% suggests that low - mass e / s0s may experience frequent small starbursts ( with the caveat that we have sampled the most strongly star - forming examples by favoring blue - sequence e / s0s detected in co ) .",
    "therefore the tsfes of lower - mass galaxies , when time - averaged over many bursts , may be elevated  consistent with the finding that the concentration indices in blue - sequence e / s0s are similar to those identified by @xcite as optimal for peak time - averaged tsfe .",
    "our results support the picture of and @xcite that many blue - sequence e / s0s are in a `` sweet spot '' with abundant gas and bursty star formation enabling efficient disk building .",
