    "the main sources of experimental input for the parton distribution functions ( or structure functions ) include deep inelastic lepton  nucleon scattering and hard hadronic inclusive interactions with final states including high mass leptons pairs , high@xmath1 direct photons , high@xmath1 jets , @xmath7 , @xmath8 or heavy flavors .",
    "knowledge of the quark and gluon distributions of the proton has greatly increased in recent years .",
    "the first input has come from the high quality data on deep ",
    "inelastic structure functions in lepton ",
    "nucleon scattering @xcite .",
    "these experiments are generally most sensitive to valence quark distributions .",
    "they probe electromagnetically and are only directly sensitive to charged partons rather than gluons . the deep ",
    "inelastic scattering experiments have been less conclusive in the determination of the antiquark distributions .",
    "analyses of data to extract the antiquark distributions usually involve various assumptions @xcite .",
    "progress in determining the sea quark and gluon distributions in the proton have concentrated on fits to a variety of types of data .",
    "the @xmath9 collaboration @xcite and @xmath10 group @xcite have made global fits to available experimental data .",
    "but , the determination of the antiquark distributions with hadronic interactions using fit procedures has been difficult because most high@xmath1 hadronic reactions are either : dominated by contributions from valence partons and gluons ; involve too many contributing subprocesses to analyze unambiguously ; or have a very small cross section in the high@xmath1 region .",
    "furthermore , much of the recent high energy collider data involves @xmath11 interactions where the most probable interactions tend to involve gluons and valence quarks rather than non  valence quarks .",
    "it is unclear how well the antiquark distributions have been determined in the fits by the @xmath9 and @xmath10 groups .",
    "even when considering similar data sets , these groups find that their fits differ in the low @xmath12 region @xcite .",
    "for example , at @xmath13 the @xmath14 distribution from @xmath10 at @xmath15 is higher by @xmath16 than the same distribution of the @xmath9 collaboration . for the @xmath17 antiquark",
    "@xmath18 distribution , this difference increases up to @xmath19 at same region of @xmath12 and @xmath20 .",
    "it has been difficult to pin down the errors associated with these fits .    to verify and improve the results of these or other fits , measurements which are more directly dependent upon and more sensitive to the antiquark distributions are needed . in this paper , one such experiment and analysis procedure is proposed .",
    "a kinematic region is defined for high@xmath1 direct photon and jet production from @xmath2 interactions in which the @xmath21 annihilation process is uncharacteristically important .",
    "the region involves parton pairs with asymmetric momentum fractions and the analysis concentrates on the angular distribution of the parton  parton interaction .    in general , the dominant subprocess for high@xmath1 direct photon and jet production is the @xmath22 quark  gluon compton process .",
    "since the direct photon cross section is proportional to the square of the quark or antiquark charge , the @xmath17 and @xmath23 quark contributions are suppressed by a factor of four relative to that of the @xmath22 quarks .",
    "thus , @xmath24 is the primary subprocess and the next most important process is @xmath22 and @xmath5 quark annihilation , @xmath25 .",
    "the @xmath22 quark contribution to direct photon and jet production is enhanced over the @xmath17 or @xmath23 quark contributions both because of this factor of four and because of the reduced number of @xmath17 or @xmath23 quarks in the proton relative to @xmath22 quarks .",
    "while the annihilation parton cross section is comparable in magnitude to that of the compton process , the ratio of the distribution functions @xmath26 to @xmath27 is typically 1:10 in the region of @xmath28 .",
    "generally , the @xmath22 and @xmath5 annihilation contribution to the direct photon cross section is only about @xmath29 .",
    "these two types of parton cross sections do , however , have a different angular distribution .    in the parton model , the direct photon ",
    "jet cross section is the sum over subprocess terms , each term is the product of a parton level cross section and the two associated parton density functions .",
    "the lowest order partonic cross sections for annihilation and compton interactions are @xcite : @xmath30    @xmath31    where @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the mandelstam variables for the parton scattering subprocess .",
    "these two cross sections have very different angular distributions .",
    "the compton cross section becomes very large for scattering angles corresponding to the @xmath22 quark scattering backward relative to the incident @xmath22 quark direction , sending the photon forward .",
    "the annihilation cross section becomes large for the photon emerging in the forward or backward direction .",
    "the idea of this analysis procedure is to focus on @xmath35 production in the region of the parton center of mass angular distribution , where the annihilation process is enhanced because of the small @xmath33 singularity in the low order scattering graph .    the variables @xmath36 and @xmath37 are defined to be the momentum fractions for the `` first '' and `` second '' protons respectively , and @xmath38 as the angle between the photon and the `` first '' proton momentum direction in the center of mass of a partonic hard scattering subprocess .",
