    "the layer index of each electron defines a two dimensional hilbert space : it resembles the usual spin-(1/2 ) degree of freedom of electrons .",
    "we assume throughout that physical electron spin is completely polarised by the applied magnetic field . in the quantum hall state",
    ", we may work in a basis of localised orthogonal states in the lowest landau level .",
    "configurations in which two electrons occupy the same localised state represent quasiparticles , and have a large energy gap .",
    "therefore , a theory of discrete spins ( @xmath7 ) on a lattice is appropriate at low energies .",
    "the spins interact by an exchange interaction with an easy plane , and experience a field in the easy plane that arises from tunnelling between the layers .    in our calculations",
    ", we generalise the model to @xmath8 : this generalisation may be treated as a coarse - graining procedure .",
    "the limit of large @xmath9 is also the classical limit for the spin system .",
    "after coarse - graining , we replace the easy - plane exchange interaction by a combination of isotropic exchange and an on - site anisotropy term .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian is : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the spin operator on site @xmath12 of a square lattice with spacing @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the magnetic length .",
    "the interlayer exchange @xmath15 and the strength of the on - site repulsion @xmath16 were derived from microscopic considerations by moon _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite ( @xmath17 in the notation of that paper ) .",
    "the tunnelling between the layers enters the problem through @xmath18 : the splitting of the `` bonding '' and `` anti - bonding '' single - particle states in the double well .",
    "we use a hamiltonian with isotropic exchange purely for simplicity : the interlayer and intralayer exchange constants will differ in general .",
    "however , if we generalise to an exchange interaction that is anisotropic ( in the spin space ) , then only the interlayer part is relevant at the large lengthscales and small charge imbalances that are relevant to our calculations ( we require @xmath19 , and @xmath20 for all relevant wavevectors , @xmath21 ) . since these conditions are satisfied for the experimental comparisons that we make , we set both the interlayer and intralayer exchange constants to their interlayer value , @xmath15 .",
    "in our thought experiment , a gate is used to control the charge imbalance on the bilayer : this adds a term @xmath22 to the hamiltonian .",
    "typical values for the model parameters in physical bilayer systems are @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "hamiltonians of the form ( [ equ : h_spins ] ) permit both ferromagnetic and quantum disordered phases at zero temperature . at large @xmath16 ( or small @xmath9 ) , the uncertainty in @xmath27 associated with ferromagnetic order means that the paramagnetic phase with @xmath28 becomes energetically favoured .",
    "we interpret the observation of a linearly dispersing peak in the tunnelling conductance@xcite as evidence that the experimentally accessible states have ferromagnetic order  the peak arises from the goldstone mode of the system . in other words , we assume that the system is connected adiabatically to the large-@xmath9 limit of our model , ignoring the possibility of the quantum disordered phase that exists for @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "we seek a minimal theory of the bilayer .",
    "we therefore work in a clean system at @xmath30 .",
    "this allows us to calculate dissipation rates starting from purely microscopic considerations : this is distinct from the more phenomenogical approach of ref .   in which dissipation",
    "is added to the model in the form of damping terms in the classical equations of motion .",
    "simulations@xcite indicate that disorder may be relevant to the tunnelling at small bias voltages .",
    "while these effects are beyond the scope of this paper , we argue below that our framework may be suitable for further investigation of these effects .",
    "possible effects of topological defects such as merons@xcite are also neglected in our treatment , as are inhomogeneities in the order parameter associated with the spontaneous symmetry breaking@xcite .",
    "a feature of our framework is that we work on transport in an isolated bilayer .",
    "this means that our calculations are well - controlled .",
    "coupling the bilayer to leads , as in experiments , complicates the picture .",
    "we believe that the bulk effects that we study should dominate over boundary effects associated with the leads , such as those studied by park@xcite , especially in the ( experimentally relevant ) geometry where the current source and drain are separated by a distance of the order of the sample size .",
    "having reduced the system to a minimal model , we now proceed to discuss the behaviour of the spin system of equation  ( [ equ : h_spins ] ) .      in the ferromagnetic phase",
    ", we expect the qualitative behaviour of the system to be accessible through an expansion about the classical limit . in this limit ,",
    "an initially uniform configuration of the spins remains uniform forever .",
    "each spin precesses along one of the trajectories of constant energy shown in figure  [ fig : q0_spins ] .",
    "there are two qualitatively different types of trajectory in that figure : those which wind around the @xmath31-axis and those which wind around the @xmath32-axis .",
    "this distinction underlies the crossover in the tunnelling @xmath33 relation mentioned above .",
    "we now discuss the form of the trajectories and the classical properties of the spin system .",
    "trajectories with low energies are localised near the ground state , in which the spins are aligned along the @xmath31 axis .",
    "the spins precess around that axis with a frequency @xmath34 where @xmath35^{1/2 } \\label{equ : swgap}\\ ] ] is the energy gap for spinwave excitations .",
    "these excitations describe density waves of charge imbalance across the bilayer . for the case",
    "@xmath36 these excitations form the goldstone mode that appears when the symmetry around the easy plane is spontaneously broken . in that case",
    "they disperse linearly with a velocity @xmath37 . introducing the tunnelling",
    "@xmath18 breaks the symmetry explicitly , and the gap opens up . as the mean magnetisation precesses around the @xmath31-axis , the charge imbalance on the bilayer oscillates around zero .    for trajectories with much larger energies , the mean spin precesses around the maximal energy state , which is close to the @xmath32-axis of the spin sphere .",
    "this yields a josephson - like alternating current @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the voltage across the bilayer due to capacitative charging .",
    "we stress that this is valid only for large charge imbalance ( large @xmath39 ) .    a saddle point on the negative @xmath31-axis of the spin sphere marks the boundary between oscillations around the ground state and oscillations around the maximal energy state .",
    "the saddle point trajectory crosses the @xmath40-plane at the saddle point , and at @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the angle shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : q0_spins ] .",
    "it is given by @xmath43 .",
    "when the gate is used to induce a charge imbalance on the bilayer , the mean spin is tilted out of the easy plane by an angle @xmath44 , which satisfies : @xmath45 where @xmath39 is the gate voltage .",
    "the saddle point then corresponds to a voltage difference of @xmath46\\ ] ] across the layers .",
    "( we write @xmath3 in this form since the tunnelling energy scale set by @xmath18 , is much smaller than the charging energy scale set by @xmath16 . ) since the dynamics of this system depends strongly on whether the applied bias is above or below this threshold value , the calculations we describe below will treat these two regimes separately .",
    "we now turn to our thought experiment which will form the basic strategy behind our calculations .",
    "we imagine using a gate to induce a uniform charge imbalance on the bilayer . in the spin picture ,",
    "the magnetisation is tilted out of the easy ( @xmath47 ) plane with @xmath48 where @xmath39 is the voltage bias applied across the bilayer and the second approximate equality is valid to leading order in @xmath49 and @xmath50 , both of which will be small ( recall equation ( [ equ : v_theta ] ) ) .",
    "the magnetisation remains in the @xmath40-plane due to the tunnelling field .",
    "the bias is then instantaneously removed and the bilayer finds itself in a highly excited state . in this paper , we will calculate the quantum and classical dynamics of this highly excited system .    from the discussion of the classical dynamics , we expect the thought experiment to give different results according to whether the initial gate voltage @xmath39 is above or below the saddle point value @xmath3 .",
    "for small initial energy , @xmath6 , the charge imbalance oscillates around zero : the effect of any dissipation will be to damp this oscillation ( lower trace in figure  [ fig : sz_t ] ) .",
    "conversely , if the initial charge is larger , the oscillation is about a finite charge imbalance : dissipation leads to a decay of that charge imbalance , and therefore a direct current ( upper trace in figure  [ fig : sz_t ] ) .",
    "the link between dissipation and transport is clear in this case , since dissipative processes lead directly to a direct current .    in our calculations",
    ", we will treat these two regimes in separate perturbation theories .",
    "common to both calculations , we will expand around the classical limit using spinwave theory in a @xmath51 expansion . in a quantum theory of the spin system",
    ", the coherent oscillations of the charge imbalance do not remain coherent forever .",
    "this is different from the classical case and is consistent with the mixing between modes with different wavevectors observed in the exact diagonalisations of nakajima@xcite .",
    "dissipation is possible because the tunnelling term breaks the global spin rotation symmetry so that the long - wavelength modes are no longer protected from decay by goldstone s theorem .",
    "we will find that the leading terms in the expansion about the classical limit result in the leading terms in the relations between the dissipation rate and the initial gate voltage , @xmath39 .",
    "in this section , we calculate the dissipation rates out of the coherent classical oscillation of the spin system . as shown in figure  [ fig : sz_t ] , the effect of the dissipation is different , depending on the initial charge on the bilayer .",
    "however , in both cases , the dissipation rate , @xmath52 is given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 measures the energy in the bosonic mode with momentum @xmath55 and @xmath56 is an initial state for the system .",
    "the procedure used to calculate the dissipation rate is different in each case .",
    "the smallest energy scale in the physical bilayer systems is @xmath18 , so it seems natural to treat this parameter perturbatively .",
    "however , the tunnelling term breaks a continuous symmetry of the hamiltonian , so care must be taken in the limit @xmath57 .",
    "it is clear from figure  [ fig : q0_spins ] that the trajectories with energies above the saddle point energy are perturbatively connected to the @xmath36 limit .",
    "conversely , trajectories with very low energies are qualitatively different to those in the limit of zero tunnelling : in this case perturbation theory in @xmath18 is not appropriate .",
    "instead , we treat the energy of the trajectory ( or equivalently the initial gate voltage ) perturbatively .",
    "we now calculate the extent to which quantum dissipative processes affect charge relaxation on the bilayer , or damping of charge oscillations ( recall figure  [ fig : sz_t ] ) .",
    "we begin by considering the situation for initial energies above the saddle point ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "this calculation was outlined in ref .  ; we review the method here since the calculation in the following subsection is a refinement of the same approach .",
    "evaluation of @xmath52 requires the choice of an initial state , and calculation of matrix elements between that state and final states with different values of @xmath54 .",
    "we use a bosonic representation of the spin algebra , which defines the basis for initial and final states .",
    "we then identify the initial state and the dominant process that leads to dissipation ; this allows calculation of @xmath52 .    to begin",
    ", we define our bosonic representation of the hamiltonian , by using the holstein - primakov representation of the spin algebra @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "we treat tunnelling perturbatively , so we begin by setting @xmath36 and expanding around @xmath60 .",
    "the quadratic part of the hamiltonian is then easily diagonalised in the fourier basis to give @xmath61 where the @xmath62 are bosonic operators ( @xmath63=\\delta_{\\bm{q},\\bm{q'}}$ ] ) describing the spinwave modes . the spinwave dispersion is given by @xmath64^{1/2}\\\\ \\gamma(\\bm{q})&=&4 - 2\\cos(q_x c_0 ) - 2\\cos(q_y c_0 ) .",
    "\\label{equ : swhighbias}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as discussed above , the tunnelling is being treated perturbatively .",
    "therefore , this dispersion relation is that of a model with spin rotational symmetry in the @xmath47-plane , and @xmath65 is gapless linear in @xmath21 at long wavelengths .",
    "the absence of an energy gap in this approximation does not affect our calculation for @xmath66 .",
    "observe that the @xmath67 mode has been singled out in the hamiltonian , and its energy is not given by the long wavelength limit of @xmath65 .",
    "the quanta of this mode carry @xmath68 while spin waves with finite wavevector have @xmath69 .",
    "thus the eigenspectrum of the system consists of multiple branches : each branch has an associated @xmath27 , and consists of a continuum of linearly dispersing collective modes .",
    "we use a basis @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the number of quanta in the @xmath67 mode ( which labels the branch ) , and the set of wavevectors indicate indicate the presence of collective modes with finite momenta .    the next step is to express the initial state of the system in this basis .",
    "the thought experiment stipulates an initial state with the expectation of the spin equal to @xmath72 : this is a coherent state .",
    "however , a choice of an eigenstate of @xmath27 with the same expectation of the energy leads to the same average rate .",
    "thus we use @xmath73 .",
    "the final step in the calculation is to identify the dominant process contributing to @xmath52 .",
    "the dissipation arises from the destruction of one quantum in the @xmath67 mode , and the generation of multiple spinwaves during tunnelling across the bilayer . to leading order in @xmath51 ,",
    "a pair of spin waves is excited , each with energy @xmath74 but with opposite momenta ( fig .  [",
    "fig : diag_asp]a ) .",
    "the relevant vertex in the interaction hamiltonian is : @xmath75\\ ] ] in which @xmath76 is a renormalised tunnelling amplitude , and the vertex factor is given by @xmath77 $ ] where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are coherence factors : @xmath80 with @xmath81 .",
    "the @xmath44-dependence arises because the @xmath31-component of the pseudospin depends on the angle @xmath44 of the spin with the easy plane , as well as the azimuthal angle @xmath82 around the plane .",
    "this dependence is weak for @xmath83 when the charge imbalance is small compared to the landau level filling .",
    "hence we calculate the power dissipation @xmath52 for a given initial voltage @xmath39 , using @xmath84 .",
    "the calculation proceeds according to fermi s golden rule .",
    "the steady - state tunnelling current density at a bias @xmath39 can then be computed from this dissipation by @xmath85 .",
    "we find : @xmath86 ^ 2 \\label{equ : i_asp}\\ ] ] where @xmath87 is small for a small charge imbalance ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "the dissipation saturates at small initial gate voltages , leading rise to an increasing current as the gate voltage is reduced .    as discussed in ref .",
    ", this form for the current is qualitatively consistent with the experiments of ref .",
    ", in that the region of negative differential conductance is observed for @xmath88 . from that experimental data",
    "it seems that the dissipation rate does increase with increased applied voltage rather than remaining constant : we attribute this increase to dissipative channels not captured within our approach .",
    "we also note that the current that flows in our thought experiment is the same current defined in ref .  , but that the calculations in that paper neglect the @xmath89 contribution to the current that we calculate .",
    "quantitative comparison between theory and experiment is complicated by the fact that the area of the sample over which tunnelling takes place remains an open question@xcite .",
    "it may depend on the experimental geometry and on spatial fluctations in the tunnelling amplitude .",
    "our calculation gives a current density per unit area of bilayer : in order to match this data with experiments we must assume tunnelling taking place over an area around @xmath90 , which is signicantly smaller than the total area , so consistent with tunnelling taking place over localised regions of the bilayer .",
    "the calculation leading to equation  ( [ equ : i_asp ] ) may be straightforwardly generalised to the case in which an aharonov - bohm flux is introduced in the plane of the bilayer .",
    "there is a momentum scale associated with the new flux , given by @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the spacing between the two quantum wells , and takes a value around @xmath93 . with an appropriate gauge choice",
    ", the effect of the flux is to introduce a spatial dependence to the tunnelling term in the hamiltonian : @xmath94 .",
    "the result is that a new dissipative process appears in which a single quantum of the @xmath67 mode decays into a single spinwave with momentum @xmath95 .",
    "this leads to a contribution to the current at order @xmath96 : in other words , even the purely classical spin system has a decaying oscillation in this case .",
    "evaluating the leading two terms in the @xmath97 expansion , we arrive at @xmath98 \\label{equ : i_finiteq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath99 is the step function .",
    "the second term is the two spinwave contribution that reduces to ( [ equ : i_asp ] ) at @xmath100 .",
    "the @xmath101-function in the first term indicates a resonance in the classical spin system when the capacitative energy released on transferring an electron across the bilayer matches the energy of the collective mode with momentum @xmath95 .",
    "this infinitely narrow form of the peak is clearly unphysical .",
    "this is because we are calculating a transition rate to a discrete level , by specifying both the momentum and the energy of the final one - spinwave state .",
    "the final state can itself decay at higher order in @xmath51 and so the delta function will be broadened .",
    "moreover , the delta function can be broadened by disorder or by finite temperature . in figure",
    "[ fig : i_finiteq ] we show the @xmath33 characteristic of ( [ equ : i_finiteq ] ) , where an uncertainty in the momenta of the collective modes has been introduced to mimic the effect of weak disorder .",
    "quantitative calculation of the broadening introduced by these effects is beyond the scope of this paper : the degree broadening also controls the peak height , which again frustrates a detailed comparison with experiment .",
    "however , we emphasised in ref .",
    "that the asymmetric lineshape of this peak arises from the quantum corrections that we have calculated : these are multi - spinwave decay channels .",
    "we now turn to initial charging voltages @xmath6 , in which the effect of dissipation is to damp oscillations in the charge imbalance on the bilayer .",
    "this behaviour was shown in the lower trace of figure  [ fig : sz_t ] .",
    "we note that this case is different from @xmath4 in that our thought experiment does not result in a state with a steady direct current .",
    "for that reason we can not directly address the @xmath33 relation at these small biases : the strong feature in the differential conductance observed experimentally@xcite at small @xmath39 is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "however , the coherent oscillations of charge between the layers that are predicted by the classical limit of the spin system are not observed in experiments",
    ". the intrinsic dissipation rate that we calculate sets a minimal decay rate for these oscillations",
    ". adding disorder or inelastic scattering to the model might increase this decay rate : we consider only the clean system in this paper , but the framework that we now describe could be extended to consider this case .",
    "the calculation of @xmath52 is slightly more complex than for @xmath6 , but proceeds along the same lines .",
    "the result is a slow ( power law ) decay of the oscillations predicted by the classical limit of the pseudospin system .    in order to obtain a bosonic theory",
    ", we again use the holstein - primakov representation . however , we may choose either the @xmath31 axis or @xmath32 axis as the principal axis for our bosonic theory . choosing",
    "the @xmath31 axis is natural since that is the direction of the mean magnetisation .",
    "on the other hand , choosing the @xmath32 axis has the advantage that no interactions arise from the anisotropy term in the hamiltonian .",
    "we have checked that the results we present below are independent of this choice .",
    "let us consider first the spinwave spectrum @xmath102 .",
    "the non - interacting part of the hamiltonian for the spinwaves takes the form @xmath103 where @xmath104 and @xmath105 are the creation and annihilation operators for a spinwave with momentum @xmath55 and @xmath106^{1/2}.   \\label{equ : swdispersion}\\ ] ] where @xmath107 was defined in section  [ sec : qu_asp ] , above .",
    "since we are treating the tunnelling non - perturbatively , the spinwaves now have an energy gap of @xmath108^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "the non - interacting eigenspectrum has multiple branches , labelled by the total number of spinwave quanta .",
    "this should be contrasted with the high - bias regime discussed in the previous section where there is a qualitative difference between the @xmath67 and finite-@xmath21 modes and the branches are labelled by the number of @xmath67 quanta .",
    "however , for consistency , we continue to use the notation in which @xmath109 describes a state with @xmath110 quanta in the @xmath67 mode , as well as a set of collective excitations with finite momenta .",
    "( we omit the set of finite momenta if it is empty . )    to set up the calculation for our thought experiment , the initial state of the system is chosen to be the ground state of the bilayer in the presence of the gate voltage @xmath39 . in terms of the creation operator @xmath111 for the @xmath67 spinwave , this is approximated by a coherent state , which can be written as @xmath112 | 0 \\rangle \\label{equ : initial_state}\\ ] ] where @xmath113 is a coherence factor , and @xmath114 $ ] enforces normalisation .",
    "the expectation of the occupancy of the @xmath67 mode in this state is @xmath115 we observe that the occupancy of the bosonic mode with @xmath67 is proportional both to the area of the system and to @xmath9 : the bosons in this mode are bose - condensed with areal density @xmath116 .",
    "we will see below that interactions within the condensate must be treated carefully .",
    "we can now discuss the hamiltonian for our calculation in this low - bias regime .",
    "our perturbative parameter for @xmath6 is @xmath117 .",
    "it is independent of @xmath9 and does not vanish in the classical limit .",
    "we will calculate the dissipation rate @xmath52 to leading order in this parameter .",
    "we give the full details of the hamiltonian in the appendix .",

    "the vertex factors , @xmath123 s , are functions of @xmath55 which depend on the choice of principal axis in the holstein - primakoff transformation .",
    "they are independent of @xmath124 and are finite in the large-@xmath9 limit .    before discussing the dissipative processes ,",
    "we note that we have isolated the interactions within the condensate in @xmath119 because these processes do not directly contribute to the dissipation of energy from the @xmath67 modes into finite - momentum spinwaves .",
    "however , at first sight , they do appear to contribute to the decay of our initial state .",
    "moreover , the rate for the process is apparently divergent in both the thermodynamic ( large @xmath124 ) and classical ( large @xmath9 ) limits ! for instance , for the process @xmath125 , fermi s golden rule would give a transition amplitude of @xmath126 this seems to suggest that the condensate with @xmath110 @xmath67 modes decays immediately without the generation of finite-@xmath21 modes .",
    "this divergence of the fermi s golden rule amplitude originates from the macroscopic occupation of the @xmath67 mode .",
    "in fact , these condensate interactions do not cause decay within the condensate .",
    "instead , they contribute to a coherent non - linear evolution of _ all _ the condensed @xmath67 bosons : this effect is beyond the perturbative framework of fermi s golden rule .",
    "we will see in the next section that this evolution is part of the semiclassical spin dynamics . to avoid divergences ,",
    "we need to modify the interaction - picture operators to take into account the condensate interactions : @xmath127 o \\exp[-i\\tilde{h } t]$ ] where @xmath128 contains the non - quadratic interaction terms in @xmath129 .",
    "this removes the divergent terms from the fermi s golden rule calculation , but we pay the price of a non - trivial time dependence for the interaction - picture operators . for details of the modifications , including some comments on its physical interpretation , see appendix  [ app : mod_int ] .",
    "the effect of the non - linear evolution of the @xmath67 mode is illustrated by the annihilation operator @xmath130 for the @xmath67 mode .",
    "for example , we have : @xmath131 thus @xmath130 has a finite amplitude for destroying more than one particle .",
    "( there is an analogous amplitude for particle creation as well . ) as a result of this non - trivial time dependence , the @xmath132 term in @xmath121 may now contribute to the decay of the initial state , giving rise to a contribution to the dissipation rate proportional to @xmath133 .",
    "we now have all the ingredients required to calculate the dissipation rate .",
    "we note that the dissipative part , @xmath121 , contains only terms of even order in the bosonic operators . together with energy - momentum conservation",
    ", we can see that the simplest transition in which energy is transferred out of the @xmath67 mode involves the annihilation of four quanta of that mode , combined with the creation of a pair of spinwaves with equal and opposite momenta : @xmath134 where the momentum @xmath55 has to satisfy energy conservation : @xmath135 .",
    "this kinematic constraint leads to an intrinsic dissipation which depends on the fourth power of the density of spinwaves . at low bias ,",
    "this density is small and so the intrinsic dissipation is rather weak .    as expected from kinematics ,",
    "the dominant processes contributing to dissipation are of the form shown in figure  [ fig : diag_bsp ] .",
    "the modified interaction picture yields an effective matrix element for the transition , given by @xmath136 where the coefficients @xmath137 were defined in equation ( [ equ : qu_gammas ] ) as the vertex factors for various processes involving spin wave quanta .",
    "the different terms in @xmath138 correspond to different coherent routes for destroying 4 @xmath67 spin wave quanta and generating a pair of finite-@xmath21 spin waves .",
    "this can be achieved with a direct vertex ( @xmath139 ) , or through an intermediate virtual state @xmath140 ( @xmath132 followed by @xmath141 ) .",
    "the @xmath132 term in @xmath121 also contributes to the decay through the non - linear component of @xmath129 from ( [ equ : nonlinearmode ] ) giving the term @xmath133 .",

    "hence the amplitude , @xmath151 , of the oscillating charge imbalance on the bilayer decays slowly in time , according to @xmath152    this is weak dissipation , but we believe that it is the first microscopic calculation of an intrinsic dissipation rate in these systems .",
    "the existence of such mechanisms is an important issue because coherent oscillations of the charge are not observed in physical bilayer systems .",

    "we work perturbatively around @xmath254 which is the limit of independent oscillators in which the coherent oscillation remains coherent for ever .",

    "further , we choose the relative phase between driven and driving oscillators such that the energy in the classical oscillators can never be reduced below the same zero point value ( since that would violate the uncertainty principle ) .",
