    "the latter will also be present in a+a collisions and a robust calculation of qgp signatures needs reliable understanding of initial - state interactions .    since the photon couples to the partons in the collision region only through electromagnetic interactions ( @xmath10 ) its mean free path is very large .",
    "hard photons leave the medium without rescattering and their production can provide valuable information to help constrain initial - state cnm effects .",
