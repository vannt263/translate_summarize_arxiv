    "we study single- and double - charge discrete optical vortices in non - square periodic photonic lattices  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "in the framework of the continuous nonlinear model of optically - induced lattices generated in saturable nonlinear media , we analyze the existence , stability and dynamical properties of discrete optical vortices for the case of _ hexagonal optical lattices_. we obtain the somewhat counter - intuitive result that double - charge discrete vortices in such lattices appear to be far more robust and structurally stable than single - charge vortices . we verify this finding by demonstrating numerically the generation of a double - charge vortex with realistic experimental parameters .",
    "it is particularly important to highlight that although our results will be given with a view towards applications in photorefractive crystals , they are not only relevant to that setting but also directly applicable to two - dimensional hexagonal waveguide arrays ( e.g. , in glass ) , showcased in recent experiments ( see e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "furthermore , they are likely to have direct implications to other areas of physics , such as bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) in triangular lattices , the first experiments of which have just been realized @xcite , or even debye crystals in dusty plasmas @xcite .",

    "a positive real part of an eigenvalue in the linear stability spectrum leads to exponential growth of the corresponding linear excitation mode , and therefore to instability of the vortex .",
    "somewhat surprisingly we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig2](top ) that the single - charge vortex has an eigenvalue with a positive real part across its entire region of existence , and therefore the single - charge vortex is _",
    "always unstable_.    in contrast we find that double - charge vortices may be _ stable _ ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) ) , and even where unstable the instability is weaker than the single - charge case ( see fig .  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "in fact , as we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig4](top ) the double - charge vortex has a wide parametric interval where it is completely stable ( from @xmath28 ) , while outside this range it is unstable due to weak oscillatory instabilities ( complex unstable eigenvalues , as evidenced by the spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) ) .",
    "we note that neither the single- nor double - charge discrete vortex families degenerate into a linear bloch mode , as one can observe from the saddle - node bifurcation that occurs close to the edge of the first band of the linear spectrum in both fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and fig .",
    "the various unstable single- and double - charge vortices which occur along the upper dashed branch in each figure are not discussed here .",
    "the typical evolution of the stable and unstable vortices is illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig5](a , b ) .",
    "even though the single - charge vortex is lower in power than the double - charge vortex , break - up of the former into single - site fundamental discrete solitons occurs around @xmath29 , while the double - charge vortex has been propagated to @xmath30 with no sign of instability .    to further our theoretical understanding ,",
    "we employ a discrete model . in the latter the analytically tractable anti - continuum limit",
    "can be used , for which discrete vortex solutions can be explicitly constructed and a detailed stability analysis can be performed , as has been done for square lattices  @xcite .",
    "in such a setting we consider the six site configuration with topological charge @xmath26 over the contour , which takes the form @xmath31 , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 for the six sites constituting the relevant contour .",
    "it is straightforward to see that this configuration yields non - trivial phase profiles for @xmath27 and @xmath34 . for these structures , according to the framework of @xcite , the fundamental vortex will be _ unstable _ due to two double real eigenvalue pairs and a single real eigenvalue pair whereas the @xmath34 configuration may be _",
    "these general results may also be physically understood as a consequence of the 1d modulational instability ( mi ) results  @xcite along the 1d ( with periodic boundary conditions ) six - site contour of the vortex .",
    "such mi considerations predict that configurations where adjacent sites have less than a @xmath35 phase difference ( i.e. a single - charge vortex ) will be unstable , while those with more than a @xmath35 phase difference ( the double - charge case ) will be stable .",
    "it is important to point out here that , as the above discrete 1d contour analysis suggests , our results can qualitatively be extended to other cases where there exists a six - site closed contour , as e.g. in the so - called _ honeycomb _ lattice in which each index maximum has three neighboring maxima instead of six .",
    "a typical example of a stable double - charge vortex in a honeycomb lattice is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . furthermore , extending our consideration of the 1d six - site contour to the case of a defocusing nonlinearity , one can apply a so - called _ staggering _ transformation _ along the contour _",
    ", @xmath36 .",
    "substitution of this expression in the discrete equation transforms the model from defocusing to focusing ( and vice versa ) .",
    "this amounts to translating the phase of every other node along the contour by @xmath37 and , hence , transforming an @xmath38 focusing vortex to an @xmath39 defocusing vortex respectively , suggesting a corresponding stability exchange .",
    "finally , we consider the generation of double - charge vortices and suggest parameters for their experimental observation . for our particular lattice parameters",
    "we find that generation of stable double - charge vortices is possible over a wide range of input beam intensities and profiles , at least within our isotropic medium approximation .",
    "we consider a laguerre - gaussian input beam with the profile shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , kept as constant as possible as the input phase is changed , with maximum intensity @xmath40 .",
    "in the subsequent evolution we see break up of the beam into single - site discrete solitons if the initial phase corresponds to a single - charge vortex ( fig .  [ fig7](b ) ) , while with an initial double - charge vortex phase we see stable generation of the discrete double - charge vortex ( fig .",
    "[ fig7](c ) ) .",
    "output at @xmath41 mm is shown , however we have seen no sign of instability in the generated double - charge vortex at a distance of @xmath42 mm .    based on the above considerations , we believe that inputs of the type associated with @xmath34 should be sustained during propagation not only by hexagonal crystals in photorefractive media , but also by two - dimensional hexagonal waveguide arrays ( e.g. , in glass ) , showcased in recent experiments  @xcite . importantly",
    "also , similar results are theoretically expected and have been numerically confirmed ( data not shown here ) to be valid in the case of honeycomb lattices in such media .",
    "we have studied the existence , stability , dynamics and generation of single- and double - charge discrete optical vortices in two - dimensional hexagonal optical lattices in the framework of a continuum nonlinear model for photorefractive nonlinearity .",
    "we have found that , in contrast to square lattices , double - charge vortices can be stable , while single - charge vortices are always unstable .",
    "our main finding constitutes a general result for both hexagonal and honeycomb lattices that we expect to be verified experimentally .",
    "there are numerous directions along which it would be interesting to continue the present study .",
    "for example , it would be relevant to extend our analysis to the defocusing case for which our discrete theory predicts that the results should be inverted ( i.e. , that the @xmath27 should be potentially stable , while the @xmath34 will be unstable ) .",
    "another direction of interest would be to attempt to generalize such studies to genuinely three - dimensional , non - square lattice settings ( e.g. , in fcc , bcc or hcp crystals ) and observe how realistic three - dimensional excitations may behave in these classes of models .",
    "some of these directions are under present consideration and will be reported in future publications .",
