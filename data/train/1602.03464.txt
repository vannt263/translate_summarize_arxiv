    "we assume that the classical limit of the massive gluons is represented by the equation of motion with a mass : - d _ f _ - m^2 a _ = 0 , [ eqm ] where f_^a = _ a_^a - _ a_^a + g f_abc a_^b a_^c , and @xmath0 is the covariant derivative .",

    "this solution may be interpreted as having two point charges placed at @xmath6 and @xmath7 with the opposite signs .",
    "this electric field has no divergence @xmath8 except for the points on the charges with the magnitude @xmath9 .",
    "the electric flux looks like that of magnetic field in superconducting material .",
    "the color of the magnetic field and the electric field are 90 degrees different in the space of color , and the magnetic flux keeps inducing the electric flux .",
    "the shape of electric flux and magnetic field are shown in figure [ fig : em4 ] .",
    "the electric flux looks like a tube elongated in @xmath10-direction .",
    "when we pull the electric charges apart , the tube will get longer but it wo nt get thicker and be about @xmath11 .",

    "this classical solution gives a picture that @xmath20 and @xmath21 are rotating within a color plane that includes @xmath22 and @xmath23 direction , and quark charges are rotating too .",
    "quantum mechanically , a quark must change its color after emitting a gluon .",
    "this should have been the reason why it was difficult to understand the static force between confined quarks in the analogy of electric force .",
    "further this picture clarifies why non - abelian nature is essential for confinement .    in the solution of massive yang - mills theory such as weak theory ,",
    "the solution does not form conserved flux tubes and its electric field vanishes at longer distance .",
    "the reason why we do nt have such a decaying solution is because we do nt have current conservation @xmath24 for the theory with broken global symmetry",
    ".    this confinement picture will be valid for all the theories that have the same equation of motion classically , including real qcd and lattice qcd .",
    "here we additionally present a toy but quantum model , in which the mechanism presented in the previous section holds and easier to analyze .",
    "we consider a theory with its lagrangian : ( f_^a)^2 + |_- ig a_^a ^a |^2 - ( ^)^2 + ^ , and with a spontaneous symmetry break of _",
    "ij , [ vev ] where @xmath25 is a complex valued @xmath26 matrix field , and its left index couples to the gauge field but its right index does not .",
    "the gauge symmetry is broken , but the global color - rotation symmetry would not be broken under the vacuum expectation value ( [ vev ] ) since the non - gauged ( right ) index of @xmath25 may be rotated together . using the faddeev - popov method ,",

    ". we may take the mass of the higgs particle large enough to make it physically irrelevant .",
    "it is easy to show existence of mass gap in this model . here",
    "@xmath27 is the full hamiltonian with @xmath28 shifted variables , and @xmath29 . for any eigenstate @xmath30 with its energy @xmath31 , we have e = e|h + h_m|e > e|h_m|e , and the right - hand side should be a positive value unless the number of the gluon is zero . in general , |e= |n_g = 0 + |n_g = 1 + |n_g = 2 + , where @xmath32 is a state with its gluon number @xmath33 .",
    "any energy eigenstate with quarks should include @xmath34 states .",
    "if it does not , ( h_0 + h_int + h_a)|e= e|e , where @xmath35 includes @xmath36 states and @xmath37 should only include @xmath38 and @xmath39 states but the right - hand side can not include @xmath34 states .    due to nonbreaking of the brst symmetry ,",
    "the quarks are confined in this model because no colored state may appear as follows .",
    "the color current is j_^a = f_abc a^b f_0^c(x ) + j_0^a + ( a_b)^a - i ( |cd_c ) + i ( _ |cc ) , where @xmath40 is the color current from the quarks and the higgs field @xmath41 , where @xmath42 . the maxwell equation d^f_^a + g j_^a = _ b^a - i g f_abc ( _ |c^b ) c^c , may be written as @xmath43 . under brst formalism , physical states must be annihilated by the generator @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "therefore @xmath45 for any physical states @xmath46 and @xmath47 , which means that ( ^f_^a + g j_^a ) |f= 0 inside the physical space . the operator on the left - hand side is the generator of color gauge transformation , and then this equation means that only color - neutral state can appear as a physical state .",
    "in this letter , we presented a new classical solution of qcd and discussed possible relation to confinement .",
    "further , we found that confinement and mass gap may occur in a model with a explicit mass introduction with higgs mechanism .",
    "dual meissner effect , i.e. massiveness of magnetic field , has mainly been considered to be the mechanism that confines color charged particles , i.e.  quarks .",
    "however , the picture presented here shows that mass acquisition of electric field is rather appropriate to show the confinement string if the vector particle could acquire mass without breaking the conservation of color current .",
    "this mechanism will be valid in the real qcd because the lattice qcd , which is equivalent to the real qcd , dynamically acquires mass from analytical and lattice studies@xcite .",
    "further , we have another possibility that some of higgsless massive vector field theories @xcite works . in that case , the analyses in the latter sections would be useful .",
