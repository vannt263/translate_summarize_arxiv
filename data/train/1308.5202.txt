    "the main goal of the cognitive radio technology is to improve the efficiency in the use of limited , temporally and spatially under - utilized licensed radio frequency spectrum .",
    "a cognitive radio was first introduced by mitola in @xcite as a smart wireless device , which senses the environment , learns and automatically adapts its transmission parameters without changing any hardware structure . through such cognition and the reconfigurability features , cognitive radio systems",
    "enable cognitive users ( unlicensed or secondary users ) to perform spectrum sensing and access the channels based on the sensing results .",
    "hence , the spectrum can be utilized opportunistically by allowing the cognitive users to either use the channel if there is no activity of primary users ( licensed users ) @xcite or share the spectrum with primary users under certain interference constraints .",
    "motivated by the concept of a cognitive radio for efficient spectrum management , ieee recently published ieee 802.22 standard for wireless regional area networks ( wran ) , which is the first cognitive radio based standard for using spectrum holes in tv broadcast bands by cognitive users @xcite .",
    "it is required that cognitive users transmission does not degrade the performance of primary users , such as tv users , through harmful interference .",
    "the performance of cognitive radio systems has been extensively studied in order to obtain more insights regarding their potential applications . in particular , the performance limits of spectrum - sharing schemes were studied in @xcite by deriving the capacity of non - fading awgn and fading channels under peak and average received - power constraints at the primary receiver .",
    "in addition to interference power constraints , peak and average transmit power constraints were taken into consideration in @xcite , where the authors determined the optimal power allocation strategies for the ergodic and outage capacity of a secondary user fading channel under spectrum sharing system subject to different combinations of these constraints .",
    "in practical scenarios , errors in channel sensing are inevitable because of uncertainties in a communication channel , e.g. , noise and fading .",
    "therefore , the authors in @xcite considered the impact of imperfect channel sensing results on the ergodic capacity subject to average interference and transmit power constraints .",
    "moreover , the outage capacity and truncated channel inversion with fixed rate ( tifr ) capacity were studied in the presence of sensing errors in @xcite .",
    "the work in @xcite investigated the optimal sensing duration that maximizes the achievable throughput of the secondary users . on the other hand , to overcome the problem of sensing - throughput tradeoff , the authors in @xcite proposed a novel cognitive radio system in which spectrum sensing and data transmission are performed at the same time by using the novel receiver structure based on perfect cancellation of the secondary signal . recently , the authors in @xcite proposed optimal power allocation schemes to minimize the average bit error rate subject to peak / average transmit power and peak / average interference power constraints in spectrum sharing systems .",
    "all of the above works assume the availability of perfect channel side information ( csi ) of the interference channel between the secondary transmitter and primary receiver as well as the transmission channel between the secondary transmitter and the secondary receiver .",
    "however , in practice it is not an easy task to obtain perfect knowledge of the fading realizations .",
    "therefore , the authors in @xcite@xcite consider the capacity of cognitive radio systems under imperfect channel side information . in @xcite ,",
    "ergodic capacity was analyzed under average - received power and peak - received power constraints in the presence of only channel estimation error of the link between the secondary transmitter and primary receiver .",
    "another capacity metric , namely secondary user mean capacity , was investigated in @xcite with partial csi knowledge of the interference channel under a peak interference constraint .",
    "recently , the authors in @xcite provided unified expressions of the ergodic capacity for different csi level of the transmission link between the secondary transmitter and secondary receiver , and the interference link between the secondary transmitter and primary receiver subject to an average or a peak transmit power constraint together with an interference outage constraint .",
    "different from these works , the authors in @xcite also considered a minimum signal - to - interference noise ratio ( sinr ) constraint for the primary user and the interference from the primary transmitter on the secondary user mean capacity under different level of channel knowledge of the link between the primary transmitter and the primary receiver , and the link between the secondary transmitter and the primary receiver .",
    "another important consideration for cognitive radio systems especially in streaming and interactive multimedia applications is to support quality - of - service ( qos ) requirements of secondary users in terms of buffer or delay constraints . in this respect , the authors in @xcite obtained the optimal power adaptation policy to maximize the effective capacity subject to a given qos constraint in multichannel communications . in @xcite ,",
    "the optimal rate and power allocation strategy for the ergodic capacity in nakagami fading channels was investigated under statistical delay qos constraints . moreover",
    ", the recent work in @xcite mainly focused on the impact of adaptive @xmath0-qam modulation on the effective capacity of secondary users under interference power and delay - qos constraints .",
    "notably , in most studies as also seen in the aforementioned works , it is implicitly assumed that channel codes with arbitrarily long codewords can be used for transmission and consequently the well - known logarithmic channel capacity expressions of gaussian channels are employed for analysis . in this paper , we depart from this idealistic assumption and assume that finite blocklength codes are used by the cognitive secondary users for sending messages .",
    "hence , in our setup , transmission rates are possibly less than the channel capacity and errors can occur leading to retransmission requests .",
    "we further assume that the cognitive users operate under qos constraints imposed as limitations on the buffer violation probability .",
    "the secondary users first detect the primary user activity , which is modeled as two - state markov chain with busy and idle states .",
    "subsequently , depending on the sensing result , the secondary user adapts its transmission power and rate and sends the data .",
    "channel between the secondary users is assumed to be a block - fading channel in which the fading coefficient remains constant within each frame during the transmission .",
    "we first consider the scenario with perfect csi at the secondary receiver and no csi at the secondary transmitter . in this case",
    ", transmission is performed at two constant rate levels , depending on the sensing decision . in the second scenario ,",
    "csi is assumed to be available at both the secondary transmitter and receiver , enabling the secondary user to adapt its transmission rate according to the channel conditions . under these assumptions ,",
    "we analyze the throughput in the presence of buffer constraints by making use of the effective capacity formulation @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and the recent results in @xcite .",
    "the analysis described above is conducted for a cognitive radio system model in which we have a single secondary transmitter , a single secondary receiver , and one or more primary users .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : we introduce the system model in the next section .",
    "section [ sec : preliminaries ] provides preliminaries regarding the channel capacity with finite blocklength codes and effective throughput under statistical qos constraints . in section [ sec : effective_throughput ] , we study effective throughput under the following two assumptions : csi is known perfectly by either the receiver only or both the transmitter and receiver .",
    "the numerical results are presented and discussed in section [ sec : sim_results ] , followed by conclusions in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in the cognitive radio model we consider , secondary users first determine the channel status ( i.e. , idle or busy ) through spectrum sensing and then enter into data transmission phase with rate and power that depend on the sensing decision .",
    "secondary users are allowed to coexist with primary users in the channel as long as their interference level does not deteriorate the performance of primary users .",
    "we also assume that channel sensing and data transmission are performed in frames of @xmath1 seconds .",
    "duration of first @xmath2 seconds is allocated to channel sensing in which the secondary users observe either primary users faded sum signal plus gaussian background noise or just gaussian background noise , and make a decision on primary user activity . in the remaining @xmath3 seconds , data transmission is performed over a flat - fading channel with additive gaussian background noise and possibly additive interference arising due to transmissions from active primary users .",
    "it is assumed that the primary users activity in the channel remains the same during the frame duration of @xmath1 seconds . on the other hand ,",
    "activity from one frame to another or equivalently the channel being busy or idle is modeled as a two - state markov chain depicted in figure [ fig : transtion_primary ] .",
    "the busy state indicates that primary users are active in the channel whereas idle state represents no primary user activity . in fig .",
    "[ fig : transtion_primary ] , @xmath4 , with @xmath5 , denotes the transition probability from state @xmath6 to state @xmath7 , satisfying @xmath8 .",
    "note that we set @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "given the above two - state markov chain , we can easily determine the prior probabilities that the channel is busy and idle , denoted by @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively , as follows : @xmath13 with notations @xmath14 and @xmath15 described below .",
    "channel sensing is performed in the first @xmath2 seconds .",
    "the remaining duration of @xmath16 seconds is reserved for data transmission . as in @xcite",
    ", we formulate channel sensing as a binary hypothesis testing problem : @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes complex circularly symmetric background gaussian noise samples with mean zero and variance @xmath19 , i.e. , @xmath20 . @xmath21 denotes the primary users faded sum signal at the cognitive secondary receiver and can , for instance , be expressed as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the number of active primary transmitters , @xmath24 is the @xmath25 primary user s transmitted signal and @xmath26 denotes the fading coefficient between the @xmath25 primary transmitter and the secondary receiver .",
    "therefore , hypothesis @xmath14 above corresponds to the case in which primary users are inactive in the channel whereas hypothesis @xmath15 models the presence of active primary users . above",
    ", @xmath27 denotes the bandwidth of the system and therefore we have @xmath28 complex signal samples in the sensing duration of @xmath2 seconds .",
    "we further assume that @xmath29 is an independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "sequence of circularly symmetric , complex gaussian random variables with mean zero and variance @xmath30 , i.e. , @xmath31 .",
    "the optimal neyman - pearson energy detector is employed for channel sensing , and under the above - mentioned statistical assumptions , the test statistic is the total energy gathered in @xmath2 seconds , which is compared with a threshold @xmath32 : @xmath33 above , @xmath34 is the sum of @xmath28 independent @xmath35-distributed complex random variables and hence is itself @xmath35-distributed with @xmath36 degrees of freedom . with this characterization ,",
    "the false alarm and detection probabilities can be expressed as @xmath37 @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the regularized gamma function ( * ? ? ?",
    "6.5.1 ) , @xmath40 is the lower incomplete gamma function ( * ? ? ?",
    "6.5.2 ) , and @xmath41 is the gamma function ( * ? ? ?",
    "additionally , @xmath42 and @xmath43 denote busy and idle sensing decisions , respectively .",
    "we further express the rest of the conditional probabilities of channel sensing decisions given channel true states , i.e. , @xmath44 , in terms of @xmath45 and @xmath46 , as follows : @xmath47 combining ( [ false_alarm_probability ] )  ( [ eq : sensing_condprobs ] ) and applying the bayes rule , we can obtain the probabilities of channel being sensed to be busy and idle as @xmath48    finally , we would like to note that channel sensing can be performed by either the secondary receiver or transmitter , and we have implicitly assumed that the secondary receiver performs this task . in such a case , we further assume that the binary sensing decision made by the secondary receiver is reliably fed back to the secondary transmitter through a low - rate control channel .        following channel sensing , secondary users initiate the data transmission phase in the remaining @xmath16 seconds . they adapt transmission rates and power levels depending on the channel sensing decision and availability of channel side information ( csi ) .",
    "more specifically , in the absence of csi at the secondary transmitter , fixed - rate transmission is performed with constant power level while in the presence of perfect csi , data is sent at a variable rate . additionally , the average power is @xmath49 and transmission rate is @xmath50 in the case of channel being sensed to be busy , and average power is @xmath51 and transmission rate is @xmath52 in the case of channel being sensed to be idle .",
    "the two - level transmission scheme described above is adopted to limit the interference inflicted on the primary users .",
    "therefore , we in general have @xmath53 .",
    "if cognitive users are not allowed to transmit when the primary user activity is detected in the channel , then we set @xmath54 . in general",
    ", power @xmath55 should be below a certain threshold in order to limit the interference inflicted on the primary users .",
    "note that when the transmission power is @xmath55 , the average interference experienced by a primary user is @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the fading coefficient of the channel between the secondary transmitter and primary receiver .",
    "then , an upper bound on the transmission power @xmath55 can be expressed as @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the maximum average interference power that the primary users can tolerate and @xmath60 is the channel gain between the secondary transmitter the and @xmath25 primary receiver . however",
    ", this may not provide sufficient protection in the presence of sensing errors since primary receivers are disturbed with average transmission power of @xmath61 in the case of miss - detections . therefore , as an additional mechanism to control the interference , an upper bound on the probability of miss detection or equivalently a lower bound on the detection probability should be imposed in cognitive radio systems so that miss - detections occur rarely .    yet , another method to limit the average interference power experienced by the primary users is to impose the following constraint on the transmission powers : @xmath62 together with possibly peak constraints @xmath63 and @xmath64 . above , @xmath45 is the detection probability in channel sensing . note that primary receiver is disturbed with transmissions of power @xmath55 and @xmath61 with probabilities @xmath45 and @xmath65 , respectively , which are the probabilities of correct detection and miss - detection events .",
    "hence , average interference power is proportional to @xmath66 .",
    "we note that such an average interference power constraint was , for instance , considered in @xcite .",
    "finally , we remark that the analysis in section [ sec : effective_throughput ] is conducted for given average power constraints and given signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "therefore , any of the interference constraints discussed above can be easily be accommodated in the subsequent throughput analysis .",
    "next , we describe the channel model . the channel between the secondary users is assumed to experience flat fading .",
    "we also consider the block - fading assumption in which the fading coefficients are constant within the frame of @xmath1 seconds and change independently between the frames . under these assumptions ,",
    "the complex input - complex output relationship is @xmath67    above , @xmath68 is the circularly - symmetric complex fading coefficient with a finite variance , i.e. , @xmath69 . @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the @xmath72dimensional complex channel input and output vectors , respectively . since we assume that transmissions are power constrained by @xmath55 or @xmath61 , the average energy available in the data transmission period of @xmath73 seconds is @xmath74 for @xmath75 , and hence @xmath76 . with energy uniformly distributed across input symbols ,",
    "the average energy per symbol becomes @xmath77 is imposed in the data transmission period rather than an average power constraint , the average energy per symbol becomes @xmath78 .",
    "this leads to the scaling of the signal - to - noise ratio by a factor of @xmath79 .",

    "we again assume that the components of @xmath82 are i.i.d .",
    "gaussian random variables with mean zero and variance @xmath83 .",

    "equivalently , we can also conclude from ( [ eq : codingratef ] ) that transmission with a given fixed rate @xmath90 can be supported with error probability @xmath93 where the dependence of the error probability on fading is made explicit by expressing @xmath85 with subscript @xmath94 .    , and @xmath95 .",

    "indeed , as noted in @xcite , by the strong converse , when @xmath99 , probability of error goes exponentially to 1 as the blocklength increases .",
    "therefore , we have the sharp cutoff at the instantaneous capacity in fig .",
    "[ fig : e_vs_r ] for the asymptotic scenario of codewords of infinite length .",
    "close inspection of ( [ eq : errorprob ] ) leads to the same conclusion as well .",

    "on the other hand , for finite - length codewords , when we plot ( [ eq : errorprob ] ) , we see that we have a relatively smooth transition .",
    "this behavior indicates that for transmissions with rates less than the instantaneous capacity , we can still have errors , albeit with relatively small probabilities , while transmission rates above the instantaneous capacity can lead to successful transmissions but again only with small probability .      in @xcite , wu and negi",

    "@xmath114 will be referred as the effective rate rather than the effective capacity since we study the performance in the finite blocklength regime .      before a detailed analysis",
    ", we in this subsection briefly describe the impact of considering finite - blocklength regime in the throughput analysis of cognitive radio channels in the presence of buffer constraints .",
    "as pointed out in section [ subsec : finiteblocklength ] , the critical difference from the studies with infinite - blocklength codes is that we now have non - zero error probabilities even if the transmission rates are less than the instantaneous capacity .",
    "moreover , we observe from ( [ eq : errorprob ] ) that error probabilities , for fixed - rate transmissions , fluctuate depending on the channel conditions . in general , such error events",
    "will be reflected in the subsequent analysis by the presence of off states in which reliable communication is not achieved due to errors and consequently retransmissions are required .",
    "this potentially has significant impact in buffer - limited systems as frequent communication failures and retransmission requests can easily lead to buffer overflows .",
    "therefore , coding rates and error probabilities in the finite - blocklength regime should be judiciously analyzed and optimal transmission parameters should be identified .",
    "situation is further exacerbated in cognitive radio systems in which channel sensing is performed imperfectly and interference constraints are imposed .",
    "firstly , time allocated to channel sensing results in reduced transmission duration , leading to reduced codeword blocklength with consequences on both the rates and error probabilities . additionally , false - alarms and miss - detections , experienced due to imperfect sensing , cause over- or underestimations of the channel , and resulting mismatches cause transmission rates and/or error probabilities to exceed or be lower than required or target levels ( for instance , as will be discussed in section [ sec : state_transition_perfectcsi ] ) .",
    "in this section , we first construct an eight - state markov chain in order to model the cognitive radio channel , and then derive the corresponding state transition probabilities when csi is assumed to be perfectly known either at the receiver only or at both the receiver and transmitter .",
    "subsequently , we analyze the throughput achieved with finite blocklength codes in the presence of buffer constraints under these two assumptions .",
    "it is assumed that perfect knowledge of fading realizations is available at the secondary receiver , but not at the secondary transmitter .",
    "therefore , the transmitter performs data transmission with constant rate of @xmath50 or @xmath52 based on the sensing decision about the channel occupancy by the primary users .      before analyzing the throughput achieved by the secondary users with finite blocklength codes under buffer constraints ,",
    "we construct a state transition model for the cognitive radio channel .",
    "first , we list the four possible scenarios , together with corresponding signal - to - noise ratio expressions , arising as a result of different channel sensing decisions and the true nature of primary users activity :    * _ scenario slowromancap1@ _",
    "( correct - detection denoted by joint event @xmath115 ) : + busy channel is sensed as busy and @xmath116 . * _ scenario slowromancap2@ _ ( miss - detection denoted by @xmath117 ) : + busy channel is sensed as idle and @xmath118 . * _ scenario slowromancap3@ _ ( false - alarm denoted by @xmath119 ) : + idle channel is sensed as busy and @xmath120 . * _ scenario slowromancap4@ _",
    "( correct - detection denoted by @xmath121 ) : + idle channel is sensed as idle and @xmath122 .    additionally , transmission rate is @xmath50 bits / s / hz in scenarios 1 and 3 above , and is @xmath52 bits / s / hz in scenarios 2 and 4 .",
    "when codewords of length @xmath72 are used to send the data at these fixed rates , we know from the discussion in section [ subsec : finiteblocklength ] that information is received reliably with probability @xmath123 while errors occur and retransmission is needed with probability @xmath124 as formulated in ( [ eq : errorprob ] ) .",
    "more specifically , the error probabilities in scenarios 1 and 3 are @xmath125 for @xmath126 and 3 , respectively .",
    "similarly , we have @xmath127 in scenarios 2 and 4 for @xmath128 and 4 , respectively . above",
    ", we see that error probability is a function of the fading coefficient @xmath129 and snr . from this discussion , we conclude that the channel can be either in the on state ( in which information is reliably received ) or the off state ( in which erroneous reception occurs ) in each scenario .",
    "hence , we have eight states in total in the markov model for the cognitive radio channel as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : transtion_cognitive ] .        note that since reliable communication can not be achieved in the off states , the transmission rate is effectively zero and the data has to be retransmitted in these states .",
    "therefore , the service rates ( in bits / frame ) in four scenarios can be expressed , respectively , as @xmath130 for @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "next , we identify the transition probabilities from state @xmath6 to state @xmath133 denoted by @xmath134 in the eight state transition model of the cognitive radio channel .",
    "we initially analyze in detail @xmath135 , the probability of staying in the topmost on state .",
    "@xmath136    ' '' ''    we can first express @xmath135 as in ( [ main_probability ] ) shown at the top of the next page .",
    "subsequently , we can write ( [ seperated_probability ] ) by noting that channel being actually busy in the current frame depends on its state in the previous frame due to the two - state markov chain , and channel being detected as busy in the @xmath137 frame depends only on the true state of the channel being busy or idle in the @xmath137 frame and not on previous true states and sensing decisions since channel sensing is performed in each frame independently .",
    "moreover , channel being on does not depend on the sensing decisions and channel being on or off in the previous frames due to the block - fading assumption .",
    "finally , we have ( [ separated_probability4 ] ) by observing that the first probability in ( [ seperated_probability ] ) is @xmath138 in the markov chain , the second probability is the correct detection probability @xmath45 in channel sensing , and channel is on with probability @xmath139 as discussed above .",
    "+ by following the same steps , transition probabilities from all eight states to state 1 can be found as @xmath140 the channel is busy in the first four states and we see that the transition probabilities from these four states to the first state are the same .",
    "the channel is idle in the last four states and similarly their transition probabilities are equal .",
    "hence , ( [ eq : prob1 ] ) shows that we can group the transition probabilities into two with respect to the true nature of the channel , i.e. , busy or idle .",

    "<S> in this paper , throughput achieved in cognitive radio channels with finite blocklength codes under buffer limitations is studied . </S>",
    "<S> cognitive users first determine the activity of the primary users through channel sensing and then initiate data transmission at a power level that depends on the channel sensing decisions . </S>",
    "<S> it is assumed that finite blocklength codes are employed in the data transmission phase . </S>",
    "<S> hence , errors can occur in reception and retransmissions can be required . </S>",
    "<S> primary users activities are modeled as a two - state markov chain and an eight - state markov chain is constructed in order to model the cognitive radio channel . </S>",
    "<S> channel state information ( csi ) is assumed to be perfectly known by either the secondary receiver only or both the secondary transmitter and receiver . in the absence of csi at the transmitter , fixed - rate transmission is performed whereas under perfect csi knowledge , for a given target error probability , the transmitter varies the rate according to the channel conditions . under these assumptions , </S>",
    "<S> throughput in the presence of buffer constraints is determined by characterizing the maximum constant arrival rates that can be supported by the cognitive radio channel while satisfying certain limits on buffer violation probabilities . </S>",
    "<S> tradeoffs between throughput , buffer constraints , coding blocklength , and sensing duration for both fixed - rate and variable - rate transmissions are analyzed numerically . </S>",
    "<S> the relations between average error probability , sensing threshold and sensing duration are studied in the case of variable - rate transmissions .    </S>",
