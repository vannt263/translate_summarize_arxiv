    "in recent years , several research groups @xcite are involved in the investigations of nanoparticle spinel oxides because of their potential applications in magnetic devices , in micro wave technology @xcite , in high density magnetic recording media @xcite , in magnetic fluids as drug carrier etc .",
    "@xcite . various types of nanoparticle materials such as , metal : fe , co , ni @xcite , metallic alloys : fe - cu @xcite , and metallic oxides : mnfe@xmath2o@xmath3 @xcite and znfe@xmath2o@xmath3 @xcite , are under current research activity .",
    "while metal and inter metallic nanoparticles suffer from stability problems in atmospheric condition , metallic oxides are highly stable under ambient conditions @xcite . various factors such as ,",
    "particle size distribution @xcite , inter - particle interactions @xcite , grain ( core ) and grain boundary ( shell ) structure @xcite and metastable structure of the system @xcite control the properties of nanoparticles .",
    "some of the specific properties of the nanoparticles which are of interest are quantum magnetic tunneling @xcite , various magnetic order like ferrimagnet / ferromagnet , spin glass / superparamagnet and spin canting effects @xcite . + the interesting aspect of magnetism in spinel oxides is that the magnetic order is strongly dependent on the competition between various superexchange type interactions i.e. , j@xmath7 ( a - o - b ) and j@xmath8 ( b - o - b ) , where a : tetrahedral ( a ) sites moments and b : octahedral ( b ) sites moments , o : is o@xmath9 ions @xcite .",
    "certain amount of site disorder _",
    "i.e. _ , the cations redistribution between a and b sites is sufficient to change the super - exchange interactions in nanoparticles spinel @xcite .",
    "hence , the magnetic properties of the nanoparticle spinels can be drastically different from their bulk counterpart . in this light",
    ", we investigated co@xmath0zn@xmath1fe@xmath2o@xmath3 spinel oxide system .",
    "+ the cation distribution of the bulk sample is ( zn@xmath10fe@xmath11)@xmath12[co@xmath13fe@xmath14@xmath15o@xmath3 ( a= tetrahedral sites , b= octahedral sites ) @xcite .",
    "the a site is strongly diluted with respect to b site and b site moments contribute to different size clusters .",
    "the spins inside the clusters form canted structure due to short range ferrimagnetic interactions .",
    "the total magnetization m (= m@xmath15cos@xmath16-m@xmath12 ) of such type of canted system depends not only on the sublattice ( site ) magnetization m@xmath15 and m@xmath12 but also on the canting angle @xmath16 between the b site spins .",
    "the b site spin canting is strongly related with the amount of a site moments .",
    "if more number of a site moments exist in as milled co@xmath0zn@xmath1fe@xmath2o@xmath3 sample , the canting angle between b site spins is expected to be reduced and a drastic change in cluster glass properties of bulk sample @xcite is expected .",
    "unfortunately , most of the reports in literature concern only on the long range order system , such as znfe@xmath2o@xmath3 @xcite and nife@xmath2o@xmath3 @xcite , and the magnitudes of a and b site moments but not on the short range interacting cluster glass system where change of spin canting inside the clusters plays an important role @xcite . in this presentation , we show that for as milled co@xmath0zn@xmath1fe@xmath2o@xmath3 sample , the magnetization enhancement is related with the reduction of b site spin canting and an enhancement of ordering temperature occurs which is related with the cation redistribution and strain induced anisotropy .",
    "stoichiometric amounts of zno ( 99.998% from johnson matthey ) , fe@xmath2o@xmath17 ( 99.998% from johnson matthey ) and co@xmath17o@xmath3 ( 99.5% from fluka ) oxides for the composition co@xmath0zn@xmath1fe@xmath2o@xmath3 were mixed and ground for 2 hours .",
    "then , the mixture was pelletized and sintered at 950@xmath18c for 12 hours and slowly cooled to room temperature .",
    "the pellet was again ground and pelletized and finally sintered at 1000@xmath18c for 12 hours .",
    "the heat treatment was carried out under atmospheric condition with heating and cooling rate of 2 - 3 @xmath18c / minute .",
    "the xrd spectra of the as prepared bulk sample ( s@xmath19 ) confirm formation of well crystalline cubic spinel phase .",
    "the as prepared sample was milled for 24 hours in a spex 8000 mixer / mill using a set of six balls , two of diameter 1/2 inch and four of diameter 1/4 inch with ball to powder weight ratio 5:1 .",
    "the as milled sample ( s@xmath20 ) was heat treated in air at 300@xmath6c for various durations , ranging from 2 hours to 575 hours , to study the temporal phase evolution .",
    "the 6 hours heat treated as milled samples are denoted as s@xmath21 ( for 300@xmath18c ) , s@xmath22 ( for 600@xmath6c ) and s@xmath23 ( for 1000@xmath6c ) .",
    "the heating and cooling rates were maintained at 2 - 3@xmath18c / minute during the heat treatment process .",
    "the x ray diffraction ( xrd ) data ( fig .",
    "1a ) were taken using philips pw1710 diffractometer with cuk@xmath24 radiation in the 2@xmath16 range 10@xmath6 - 90@xmath6 with a step size 0.02@xmath18 .",
    "the xrd data of as prepared bulk sample show narrow crystalline lines with estimated particle size of a few micrometers .",
    "after 24 hours milling of the bulk sample , the xrd peak lines become significantly broad and no other phases are seen , except the cubic spinel structure .",
    "the broadening in xrd lines suggest nano structure or non - uniform micro strain introduced in the lattices during milling process @xcite .",
    "the width of @xmath25 xrd peak line gives average particle size @xmath4 20 nm for the as milled sample ( s@xmath20 ) .",
    "when the as milled sample is heat treated , the xrd lines ( fig.1b - c ) become sharp , which indicates recrystallization process in the system . the average particle size increases with annealing temperature as 23 nm , 28 nm and 62 nm for the samples s@xmath21 , s@xmath22 and s@xmath23 , respectively .",
    "eventhough the xrd spectrum of the s@xmath23 sample is very similar to that of s@xmath19 sample , the average particle size @xmath4 62 nm suggest that complete restoration of crystallinity close to s@xmath19 sample is yet to be reached .",
    "we have determined the chemical composition of s@xmath20 sample by x - ray fluorescence ( xrf ) technique .",
    "the fluorescence spectrum was detected using ortec hpge detector and finally recorded in a pc based multichhanel analyzer . the xrf spectrum ( fig .",
    "2 ) shows the characteristic k@xmath24 and k@xmath26 lines of fe , co and zn elements .",
    "no extra lines have been found that correspond contamination from hardened steel balls with composition fe@xmath27cr@xmath28ni@xmath29 .",
    "the peak integrals of the k@xmath24 lines of all the elements are obtained using the standard peak fitting programme to get the relative percentage .",
    "this program uses the principle of fundamental parameter method @xcite .",

    "i.e. _ fe = 63.53% , co = 6.71% and zn = 29.76% for co@xmath0zn@xmath1fe@xmath2o@xmath3 system .",
    "the maximum error of the fitted values are within 5% .",
    "the low field dc magnetization ( t = 20k to 320k , h= 10 oe to 100 oe ) and ac susceptibility ( t= 60k to 330k , h@xmath30 @xmath4 1 oe and frequency ( f ) = 337 hz and 7 khz ) measurements have been performed using home made magnetometer @xcite . in zfc condition , the sample has been cooled from room temperature to 20k in the absence of dc magnetic field , then the field was applied at 20k and magnetization data were recorded while increasing the temperature . in fc condition ,",
    "the sample was cooled from room temperature to 20k in presence of dc magnetic field ( same magnitude which was applied during zfc measurement ) and the magnetization data were recorded with increasing temperature and keeping the field on .",
    "high field magnetization , hysteresis experiments were performed using vsm magnetometer in the fields upto @xmath3112 tesla in the temperature range 10k to 300k .",
    "+ mssbauer spectra were recorded at 300k without applying external magnetic field , using a constant acceleration spectrometer in transmission geometry mode .",
    "the spectra were recorded using a 5 mci @xmath32co in rh matrix source .",
    "the hyperfine magnetic field ( hmf ) distribution at the @xmath32fe nuclei was evaluated from the mssbauer spectra using the method of le car and dubois @xcite . in this model",
    "a linear relationship between hmf ( h ) and isomer shift ( is ) is assumed in the form is = _",

    "3 shows the real ( @xmath34 ) and imaginary ( @xmath35 ) components of ac susceptibility for sample s@xmath20 .",
    "it shows a broad @xmath34 maximum at t@xmath15 @xmath4 320k ( for h@xmath30 @xmath4 1 oe , f= 337 hz ) and the corresponding @xmath35 maximum at @xmath4 290k .",
    "the broadness of the ac susceptibility maxima suggest a cluster size distribution in the as milled sample s@xmath20 .",
    "the temperature where @xmath34 shows maximum is defined as the average blocking temperature ( t@xmath15 ) of the clusters . from the frequency dependence of ac susceptibility measurements ( fig .",
    "3a ) , a positive frequency shift of t@xmath15 is observed in the @xmath34 as well as in the @xmath35 maximum in the measurement frequency range .",
    "this is a characteristic of superparamagnetic blocking of the ferromagnetic clusters in different metastable states @xcite . in the low temperature region ,",
    "the @xmath34 data show a small shoulder at @xmath5 100k ( designated as t@xmath36 ) and @xmath35 data show ( fig .",
    "3b ) increasing tendency below t@xmath36 .",
    "this type of behaviour of t@xmath36 can be attributed due to the disordered surface or grain boundary spins in a nanoparticle system @xcite .",
    "+ in order to check the effect of heat treatment on magnetic properties , we have carried out the ac susceptibility measurements for the s@xmath23 sample .",
    "this heat treated sample shows mixed magnetic phases .",
    "the @xmath34 and @xmath35 data of s@xmath23 sample ( fig .",

    "the frequency shift of t@xmath39 follows vogel - fulcher law @xmath40 with characteristic frequency @xmath41 @xmath4 10@xmath42 hz , activation energy e@xmath43 @xmath4 379 ev and constant t@xmath19 @xmath4 47k .",
    "the corresponding frequency shift per decade of _ f _ ( @xmath44/t@xmath45 ) is @xmath4 0.05 , which characterizes spin glass like ordering at t@xmath37 @xcite .",
    "the ordering temperature at t@xmath38 does not show significant frequency shift ( not shown in fig .",
    "4 ) , suggest ferrimagnetic ordering temperature at t@xmath38 @xmath4 280k .",
    "the spin glass transition temperature t@xmath37 @xmath4 70k and ferrimagnetic ordering temperature at t@xmath38 @xmath4 280k of s@xmath23 sample are slightly different with respect to the cluster spin glass freezing temperature t@xmath37 @xmath4 110k and short range ferrimagnetic ordering temperature t@xmath46 @xmath4 260k for bulk sample @xcite .",
    "but it is clear that the mixture of two magnetic phases ( spin glass / cluster spin glass plus ferrimagnetic phase ) of s@xmath23 sample is very similar to the bulk sample s@xmath19 .",
    "the zfc magnetization of s@xmath20 sample ( fig .",
    "5 ) shows a broad maximum at the cluster blocking temperature t@xmath15 @xmath4 320k ( h @xmath5 30 oe ) with a thermomagnetic irreversibility between zfc and fc magnetization below t@xmath15 .",
    "the decrease of zfc magnetization below t@xmath15 is due to the blocking of ferromagnetic clusters in different metastable states , whereas the fc magnetization increases below t@xmath15 due to the orientation of these ferromagnetic clusters in metastable states which give rise to more magnetic contribution @xcite .",
    "it is observed ( fig.5a and fig .",
    "5b ) that the t@xmath15 is highly applied field dependent ( _ i.e. _ , t@xmath15 @xmath4 320k , 280k and 50k for applied field 30 oe , 100 oe and 1 tesla , respectively ) as expected for superparamagnetic blocking of the clusters @xcite . the superparamagnetic behaviour of the as milled sample ( s@xmath20 ) can be further identified from the temperature dependence of field cooled thermoremanent magnetization ( trm ) data ( fig .",
    "5b inset ) that the trm value reduces to zero at t@xmath4 t@xmath15 .",
    "the zero trm value indicate that the effective inter - cluster interactions are also negligible and the clusters behave as a non - interacting small particle above t@xmath15 @xmath4 320k .",
    "+ an interesting feature is observed when we compare the magnetization data at 100 oe of as prepared bulk sample , as milled sample and heat treated samples ( fig .",
    "the magnetization is enhanced when the bulk sample is milled for 24 hours . on heat treating the as milled sample , it is observed that magnetization further increases for s@xmath21 sample",
    ". then magnetization decreases for the s@xmath22 sample .",
    "if the as milled sample is heat treated at higher temperature ( s@xmath23 ) , the magnetization increases . but compared to the bulk sample s@xmath19 , s@xmath23 sample has a higher magnetization value at low temperature and lower value at temperatures @xmath47 200k .",
    "similar non - equilibrium magnetic behaviour as a function of annealing temperature has been observed for nife@xmath2o@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the superparamagnetic blocking temperature t@xmath48 ( indicated in fig .",
    "6 ) decreases to 270k and 120k for s@xmath21 and s@xmath22 , respectively , in comparison with t@xmath48 @xmath4 280k for s@xmath20 sample at h= 100 oe .",
    "the 100 oe magnetization data of the s@xmath23 sample indicate a mixture of two magnetic ordering at t@xmath37 @xmath4 70k and t@xmath38 @xmath4 225k , respectively , very similar to the cluster spin freezing temperature at t@xmath37 @xmath4 100k and short range ferrimagnetic ordering temperature at t@xmath38 @xmath4 230k , respectively , for bulk sample @xcite .      the field dependence of magnetization data ( fig .",
    "7 ) under zfc condition is similar to that of ferromagnetic isotherms but the magnetization lacks saturation even upto 12 tesla at any temperature .",
    "this , we attribute to the spin canting effects at grain boundary @xcite or superparamagnetic contribution of nanoparticles @xcite .",
    "we note from fig .",
    "7a ( inset ) that the s@xmath20 sample has a better ferromagnetic behaviour in terms of saturation with respect to magnetic field which indicates that the strong spin canting behaviour of s@xmath19 sample @xcite has decreased for the nanoparticle s@xmath20 sample .",
    "importantly , we also note ( fig.7a , inset ) that the saturation magnetization of nanoparticle sample s@xmath20 is significantly increased at room temperature with respect to the bulk sample s@xmath49 .",
    "however , the higher value of m for s@xmath19 at 10k for h @xmath47 4 t compared to s@xmath20 can be understood by assuming two types of magnetic interactions in the system .",
    "one is ferromagnetic and second one is antiferromagnetic . in s@xmath19 sample",
    "the b site antiferromagnetic interactions are dominant which causes spin canting in b site and shows non - saturation in magnetization @xcite .",
    "the reduction of antiferromagnetic interactions between the b site moments gives rise the better ferromagnetic behaviour , yet having a reduced saturation moment at 10k , for s@xmath20 sample .",
    "it is observed from the hysteresis loop ( fig .",
    "7b ) that isothermal remanent magnetization ( m@xmath50 ) , coercive field ( h@xmath51 ) where m@xmath50 is zero , and irreversible field ( h@xmath52 ) , where the hysteresis loop closes , decrease with temperature .",
    "there is no hysteresis loop at t @xmath53 290k .",
    "this suggest that the thermal energy close to the blocking temperature ( @xmath54 ) is sufficient to reduce the coercive field to zero value @xcite .",
    "the saturation magnetization ( m@xmath55 ) values , obtained from m vs 1/h plot , are small in comparison with the bulk sample as seen in nanocrystalline nife@xmath2o@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this is possible if the b site intra - cluster spin canting decreases or if there is a redistribution of cations between a and b sites when the bulk sample is mechanically milled @xcite .",
    "8 shows the room temperature mssbauer spectra in absence of any external magnetic field for the samples ( s@xmath19 ) , s@xmath20 , s@xmath21 , s@xmath22 and s@xmath23 .",
    "the spectrum of s@xmath19 sample consists of a lorentzian doublet arising from the fe@xmath56 ions at octahedral ( b ) site and a lorentzian singlet arising from the fe@xmath56 ions at tetrahedral ( a ) site .",
    "the most probable cations distribution of bulk sample ( s@xmath19 ) obtained is ( zn@xmath1fe@xmath0)@xmath12[co@xmath0fe@xmath57@xmath15o@xmath3 . the isomer shift ( is ) and quadrupole splitting ( qs ) of fe@xmath56 ions at [ b ] site are @xmath4 + 0.29 mm / sec and 0.35 mm / sec respectively .",
    "the is value of fe@xmath56 ions at ( a ) site is @xmath4 -0.056 mm / sec @xcite .",
    "the mssbauer spectrum of the bulk sample therefore confirm that zn@xmath58 ions occupy a site , co@xmath58 ions prefer b site and fe@xmath56 ions prefers both a and b sites .",
    "the mssbauer spectrum of the s@xmath20 sample clearly indicates a hyperfine magnetic field splitting in addition to a central paramagnetic doublet .",
    "this spectrum of s@xmath20 sample represents the appearance of spontaneous magnetization of ferromagnetic clusters mixed with superparamagnetic fluctuation effect due to nano meter size of the particles @xcite . as the annealing temperature increases , the hyperfine magnetic field splitting decreases for s@xmath21 sample and the s@xmath22 and s@xmath23 samples show paramagnetic spectra .",
    "the mssbauer parameters of s@xmath23 sample ( is= + 0.27 mm / sec and qs = + 0.43 mm / sec for b site fe@xmath56 ions and the is = + 0.25 mm / sec of a site fe@xmath56 ions ) differ from that of the as prepared bulk sample which suggests that duration of heat treatment ( @xmath5 6 hours ) is not enough to achieve 100% equilibrium state of the bulk samples .",
    "these results confirm that the enhancement of magnetic ordering and magnetization observed in s@xmath20 sample is intrinsic property of the material .",
    "these also further indirectly confirm the hypothesis of the presence of non - equilibrium cation distribution in the as milled sample .",
    "+ to check the recovery of cation distribution from non - equilibrium state to equilibrium state , we recorded the mssbauer spectrum of s@xmath20 sample as function of duration of heat treatment at 300@xmath6c .",
    "9 shows the mssbauer spectra and corresponding hyperfine magnetic field ( hmf ) distribution ( p(h ) ) .",
    "the presence of multiple hyperfine fields at a and b site fe@xmath56 ions can be expected due to various super transferred hyperfine fields ( sth ) from neighbouring ions .",
    "the hmf acting on the b site fe@xmath56 ions is due to non - uniform environment , consisting of different number of zn@xmath58 and fe@xmath56 ions at the nearest neighbour a sites .",
    "the hmf experienced by the a site fe@xmath56 ions is due to nearest neighbour b site configuration @xcite .",
    "it is clear from the p(h ) distribution that the changes brought about by 2 hours heat treatment is not very significant but the peak intensities of hyperfine field components are decreasing and intensities of paramagnetic components are increasing for annealing time @xmath53 16 hours . indirectly , it gives the information that more and more number of zn@xmath58 ions stabilizing in a site with the compromise of more fe@xmath56 ions in b site .",
    "this reduces the reduction of super transferred hyperfine magnetic field via inter - sublattice superexchange interactions @xcite .",
    "10 shows the temporal evolution of the average hmf for 300@xmath6c heat treated sample .",

    "_ b_(1-exp(t / t@xmath19 ) ) where _ a _ , _ b _ and t@xmath19 are constants .",
    "f(t ) represents average hmf as a function of time .",
    "the fit gives a measure of the reaction kinetics through atomic diffusion as the sample gets annealed .",
    "usually nano materials lead to the decrease in magnetization and ordering temperature as the particle size decreases @xcite .",
    "this is already observed in co@xmath0zn@xmath1fe@xmath2o@xmath3 with particle size @xmath5 6 nm to 70 nm , prepared by coprecipitation method @xcite .",

    "t@xmath15 @xmath4 320k with an enhancement of magnetization . because of the weak inter - sublattice interactions j@xmath7 ( due to low a site fe@xmath56 population ) , the b site spins form canted structure in bulk co@xmath0zn@xmath1fe@xmath2o@xmath3 sample .",
