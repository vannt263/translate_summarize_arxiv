    "the abundance of high @xmath3 processes at lhc energies will provide large samples of high @xmath4 jets , large @xmath5 hadrons , and jets produced opposite to gauge bosons ( @xmath6).@xcite the strong interest in these observables in heavy - ion collisions stems from the concept that high @xmath4 quark and gluon jets can be used to probe the hot and dense medium produced in the collision , because they are affected by the properties of the medium as they propagate through this dense environment .",
    "partons with high transverse momentum are predicted to suffer radiative and collisional energy loss in the created medium , suppressing the yield of jets and particles found with high transverse energy in a heavy - ion collision , compared to the p+p collision case ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "early results obtained at rhic indeed showed suppression of the hadron yield at @xmath7  gev/@xmath2 and the disappearance of back - to - back correlations of high-@xmath5 particles.@xcite these indirect measurements of jet properties suggest a significant in - medium energy loss of fast partons , which will be experimentally accessible at the lhc also by observing fully formed and reconstructed jets .",
    "the performance of the cms detector for pb+pb events was extensively studied in full simulations with realistic assumptions for particle multiplicity , jet and hadron spectra.@xcite the charged particle reconstruction capabilities using the cms silicon tracking system are evaluated using a full detector simulation , assuming a charged particle density in central pb+pb collisions of @xmath8 . in this high multiplicity environment ,",
    "an algorithmic tracking efficiency of about 80% is achieved , with less than 5% fake track rate for @xmath9  gev/@xmath2 and excellent momentum resolution , @xmath10 ( for @xmath11  gev/@xmath2 ) .",
    "@xcite    the high level trigger of the cms data acquisition system is sufficiently powerful to allow the inspection of all minimum bias pb+pb events individually , where the full event information will be available for the trigger decision.@xcite jets are reconstructed in the calorimeters using an iterative cone algorithm , which is modified to subtract the underlying soft background , and can be included in the hlt .",
    "the lower limit of transverse energy needed for efficient and clean reconstruction is about 50 gev .",
    "the energy resolution for jets with 100 gev transverse energy at @xmath12 is about 16%.@xcite",
    "the nuclear modification factor , @xmath13 , and the central to peripheral ratio , @xmath14 , provide quantitative information on the amount and energy - dependence of the energy - loss of hard - scattered partons that traverse the medium created in the heavy - ion collision .",
    "they are defined as :    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions in the geometrical glauber picture , averaged over the events that belong to a given centrality class .",
    "@xmath13 quantifies the suppression ( or enhancement ) of hadron production with respect to p+p collisions .",
    "the invariant cross section of charged particles at high @xmath5 is expected to scale with @xmath16 if no nuclear effects take place , in which case the value of @xmath13 at high @xmath5 would be unity .",
    "@xmath14 does not require a p+p reference , as it compares central and peripheral heavy - ion collisions .",
    "it is not equivalent to @xmath13 , since even the most peripheral heavy - ion collisions are influenced by nuclear effects .    the @xmath17 and @xmath18 for charged hadrons thus provide important information on the properties of the created medium , like the initial gluon rapidity density , @xmath19 , or the transport coefficient , @xmath20.@xcite",
    "for both @xmath13 and @xmath14 , triggering on jets will be essential to extend the measurable @xmath5 range . using the cms calorimeter towers ,",
    "it is possible to quickly reconstruct these energetic jets with a good energy resolution .",
    "the jet reconstruction algorithm can be included in the high level trigger , and will record events containing a high energy jet with high efficiency.@xcite the increase in the number of recorded jets using the jet trigger is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ rates ] .    charged hadrons at @xmath21  gev/@xmath2",
    "originate mainly from the fragmentation of high @xmath4 jets : they are typically the leading hadrons of the energetic jets .",
    "the jet trigger is useful to collect sufficiently large jet statistics to study fragmentation functions , jet correlations , and other observables , among which we will present here the charged particle nuclear modification factors . to provide",
    "adequate and fast monte carlo tools to simulate jet quenching , the monte carlo event generator hydjet ( hydrodynamics plus jets ) has been developed and is used to produce heavy - ion collisions at lhc energies.@xcite final state particles in nuclear collisions from hydjet are obtained as a superposition of soft hydro - type particle production and multiple hard parton - parton collisions .",
    "within the 15% of the full bandwidth assigned to minimum bias events , 13.5 million events are expected to be taken in one month .",
    "the jet triggers with 50 , 75 and 100 gev @xmath22 thresholds will be able to sample 0.35 , 1.9 and 3.9 billion events , respectively .",
    "it is possible to generate the amount of minimum bias events with our generator - level tools .",
    "however , triggering enhances the number of jets at high @xmath4 by more than two orders of magnitude .",
    "thus , instead of generating one hundred times more minimum bias heavy - ion events to conduct our study , we have implemented a `` trigger '' at the generator level . this way , we only store simulated events which are likely to produce a large @xmath4 jet when the jet finder is run on the calorimeter towers .",
    "thus , more events are sampled than stored and the necessary scaling factors between the different trigger samples are not immediately available .",
    "figure  [ jetettrig ] shows the distribution of the highest @xmath4 jet within @xmath23 per event , the `` leading '' jet , for minimum bias ( black histogram ) , and for jet - triggered events with 50 , 75 and 100 gev thresholds ( grey histograms ) .",
    "the scaling factors between consecutive data sets are determined by joining them with scaling factors determined by fitting the combined leading jet @xmath24 spectrum with a power law in the joining regions .",
    "this way , the optimal scaling factors can be determined from the data distribution , without any prior assumptions on the spectrum .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fitproc ] : the left panel shows the data sets before merging while the right panel shows the same data sets after scaling , together with the power law fit .",
    "the minimum bias @xmath4 spectrum is recovered with significantly increased statistics at high @xmath4 .    using this method to merge data sets with different thresholds ,",
    "triggered data sets were generated with the number of jets with @xmath4 above the thresholds expected from one month of pb+pb data taking at design luminosity .",
    "the statistical errors on the charged particle @xmath5 spectrum in the merged data set reflects , hence , the real experimental situation after one month of data taking , with the four different trigger thresholds .",
    "the obtained @xmath13 is shown in fig .",
    "[ raa ] . in the present study ,",
    "the pythia event generator was used to simulate the p+p reference for @xmath13 .",
    "the @xmath14 ratio , which uses peripheral pb+pb collisions as reference , instead of p+p collisions , is shown in fig .",
    "[ rcp ] , for one month of data taking at nominal luminosity . comparing the results for the minimum bias data ( left panels of figs .",
    "[ raa ] and  [ rcp ] ) to the results for the jet triggered data ( right panels ) , we see that triggering on jets significantly extends the @xmath5 range of @xmath13 and @xmath14 , from @xmath25100 to @xmath25250  gev/@xmath2 in @xmath26 and from @xmath2550 to @xmath25150  gev/@xmath2 in @xmath27 .",
