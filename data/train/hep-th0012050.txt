    "d - branes at singularities give rise to low energy effective field theories of phenomenological interest .",
    "the idea behind geometric engineering @xcite is to look at the gauge theories that arise on branes at singularities .",
    "another approach is to study the gauge theories that result from the intersection of branes at angles @xcite ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) .    the quiver construction of douglas and moore @xcite provides a diagrammatic tool to visualize the field content of supersymmetric gauge theories on branes at orbifold singularities , @xmath4 .",
    "the technique involves enumerating the irreducible representations of @xmath5 and determining how the matter fields transform . in many cases ,",
    "this procedure is difficult as it involves calculating the full ( projective ) representation theory of some group which might be large .",
    "here we find a technique whereby the quiver can be constructed without knowing the full details of the representation theory of @xmath5 .",
    "such a method should be useful to model builders .",
    "we present a systematic technique for obtaining quivers of low energy gauge theories corresponding to string orbifold singularities .",
    "for the simplest orbifolds , based on the abelian discrete groups , our methods reduce to known results .",
    "they are most useful for orbifolds with discrete torsion @xcite and for orbifolds involving non - abelian discrete groups .",
    "the technique we present may also be generalized to other types of singularities .",
    "we consider a number of examples of supersymmetric orbifolds of @xmath6 by a group @xmath7 , which is a discrete subgroup of @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath5 is taken to act linearly on the coordinates of @xmath9 in a particular representation of @xmath7 .",
    "many of the discrete subgroups of @xmath8 are ( semi- ) direct product groups . because of this",
    ", the groups fit into exact sequences of the form @xmath10 for @xmath11 a normal subgroup of @xmath7 .",
    "we are particularly interested in studying the case where the group @xmath12 is abelian , as here the technique we present is most directly applicable .",
    "the orbifolding procedure can be thought of as the quotient @xmath13 that is , as an orbifold of an orbifold .",
    "since @xmath14 are smaller groups than @xmath7 , we expect that the construction of the quiver diagram for @xmath7 using ( [ eq : quot ] ) may be simpler .",
    "indeed , it is well known that the representation theory of a group @xmath5 may be organized in terms of the representation theory of a normal subgroup .",
    "consider the abelian case @xmath15 , for example .",
    "there are various possible quiver diagrams corresponding to this orbifold , depending on the choice of discrete torsion .",
    "it was realized that discrete torsion acts via projective representations of the orbifold group @xmath5 @xcite ( for related work , see for example @xcite ) . in the orbifold of an orbifold",
    "approach , the discrete torsion is encoded as a choice of @xmath16 action on the quiver of @xmath17 .",
    "this can also be seen as choices of monodromies of nodes in the quiver @xmath3 under the orbifold group @xmath12 as encountered in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "less is known about the details of how discrete torsion acts in the non - abelian case .",
    "an orbifold of @xmath18 by the ordinary tetrahedral group @xmath19 was recently analyzed @xcite .",
    "subsequently , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite calculated the discrete torsion for a number of non - abelian groups and examined the ordinary dihedral groups @xmath20 in detail .",
    "we extend these results by looking at several discrete groups that fit into exact sequences with abelian @xmath12 .",
    "one interesting fact that comes out of this analysis is that many orbifold theories are on the same moduli space of couplings of the low energy field theory .",
    "that is , unrelated orbifolds may give the same quiver diagram ; the gauge theories differ only in their superpotentials .",
    "the organization of our paper is as follows . in section [ sec : two ] , we present the orbifold of an orbifold  construction without discrete torsion and provide a simple diagrammatic prescription .",
    "section [ sec : introex ] provides two introductory examples .",
    "we obtain the quivers of some non - abelian subgroups of @xmath21 by employing exact sequences of the form ( [ eq : exact ] ) , and we study the quiver of @xmath22 to illustrate a subtlety in our approach . in section [ sec : prodgrp ]",
    "we build in discrete torsion .",
    "we concentrate in this section on direct product groups @xmath23 . in section [ sec : manyex ] , we consider a number of examples which are discrete subgroups of @xmath24 . section [ sec : dualities ] examines the different superpotentials that correspond to the @xmath25 quiver depending upon the details of how that quiver is obtained .",
    "to begin , we disregard the possibility of discrete torsion and focus on understanding the orbifold @xmath26 in terms of the orbifold @xmath27 . first , we must construct the quiver diagram of @xmath3 and then consider the action of the abelian group @xmath28 as an automorphism of this quiver .",
    "later we will specialize to the case @xmath12 abelian where the construction simplifies .",
    "we first construct the quiver diagram of @xmath3 using standard methods @xcite .",
    "the nodes are given by the irreducible representations of @xmath29 , which may be deduced from the group algebra of @xmath29 .",
    "the underlying vector space of the group algebra @xmath30 is that of the regular representation of @xmath29 .",
    "if @xmath31 , then the group algebra of @xmath29 consists of linear combinations of the form @xmath32 with @xmath33 .",
    "each irreducible representation determines a projector in the group algebra which belongs to the center of the algebra , and the linear span of these projectors generates the center of the group algebra itself .    the center of the algebra is straightforward to calculate . indeed , for @xmath34 to commute with the generators @xmath35 @xmath36 we need that the coefficient of @xmath37 on both sides be the same .",
    "thus @xmath38 whenever there exists a @xmath35 such that @xmath39 , that is , whenever @xmath37 and @xmath40 belong to the same conjugacy class @xmath41 $ ] of @xmath29 .",
    "thus the center of the group algebra @xmath42 is generated by the conjugacy classes of elements of the group @xmath29 .",
    "the relation between the idempotents and the conjugacy classes is a discrete fourier transform .",
    "consider now the group @xmath7 .",
    "as @xmath29 is a normal subgroup of @xmath7 , then conjugation by elements of @xmath7 leaves @xmath29 invariant .",
    "indeed , conjugation by an element of @xmath7 induces a group automorphism of @xmath29 and thus also an automorphism of the algebra @xmath30 to itself .",
    "any automorphism of the algebra will leave the center fixed , and thus the action of @xmath7 will act as a linear transformation on @xmath42 . in particular , the action will take idempotents to idempotents , so it will permute the irreducible representations of @xmath29 .",
    "if @xmath43 , then conjugation by @xmath44 with @xmath45 will produce the same action on the conjugacy classes of @xmath29 as @xmath35 .",
    "conjugation thus factors on @xmath28 .",
    "since the nodes of the quiver diagram denote representations of @xmath29 , @xmath28 will act on the quiver by permuting nodes .",
    "the action will also permute the arrows of the quiver with a twisting by some representation of the group @xmath28 .    to understand the quiver for @xmath7",
    ", we must then study the irreducible representations of the group @xmath28 , the irreducible representations of @xmath29 , and the action of @xmath28 on the quiver of @xmath29 .",
    "denote by @xmath46 the projectors for the irreducible representations of @xmath29 .",
    "we need to understand the algebra generated by @xmath46 and the group algebra of @xmath28 .",
    "let @xmath47 be the list of elements of @xmath28 . from the above discussion , we have @xmath48 which is a tensor algebra twisted by the action of @xmath28 on @xmath49 .",
    "any element of the algebra @xmath50 can be written in the form @xmath51 and we want to know which linear combinations are in the center of this algebra .",
    "elements of the center must commute with all the @xmath52 : @xmath53    in the case where @xmath12 is abelian , we obtain @xmath54 elements of the center must also commute with @xmath55 .",
    "we then find @xmath56 thus elements of the center can have non - zero @xmath57 only when @xmath47 acts trivially on @xmath58 .",
    "for each @xmath59 the group @xmath12 will generate an orbit of irreducible representations . in the above result",
    ", we get one element of the center for each of these orbits and for each @xmath60 which leaves the @xmath46 fixed .",
    "the orbit of @xmath61 is a representation of the group @xmath12 , and the elements which leave the @xmath61 fixed is a ( normal ) subgroup of @xmath12 .",
    "the projectors built out of the @xmath62 are in one to one correspondence with the irreducible representations of this subgroup of @xmath12 .",
    "if the orbit of @xmath46 has @xmath63 elements , we get @xmath64 irreducible representations , each of dimension @xmath65 . in particular ,",
    "if a @xmath61 is fixed under @xmath12 , the node associated to the representation splits into @xmath66 nodes , and if no element of @xmath12 leaves @xmath61 invariant , then the orbit of @xmath61 contracts to a single node .",
    "the result above determines the nodes of the new quiver diagram .",
    "we also need to find the arrows of the diagram corresponding to the matter fields . in a standard orbifold ,",
    "the arrows are determined by representations of @xmath5 on the normal directions to the orbifold and on the fermions . on a supersymmetric quiver these",
    "two are related , and the arrows are determined by the action of @xmath5 on the directions which are transverse to the orbifold .    in our case , the quiver of @xmath29 is given , and we have to understand the action of @xmath12 on the arrows of the quiver @xmath29 .",
    "if we permute the nodes , we also permute the arrows between the nodes , but there might be some extra action of @xmath12 on the arrows .",
    "as the original action of @xmath5 on the variables normal to the orbifold is linear , we expect @xmath12 to act linearly on the arrows of the quiver @xmath29 .",
    "if two nodes are connected in the original quiver diagram , this means that the two are connected by a representation of @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath29 is still a subgroup of @xmath5 , and the representations of @xmath5 can be split into representations of @xmath29 .",
    "it follows that if two orbits are connected in @xmath29 , the new nodes of the two orbits are connected in some way by arrows in @xmath5 .",
    "now , the orbifold action assigns an associated representation of @xmath12 to each transverse field . given a pair of nodes corresponding to two different orbits , we can decide if there is an arrow connecting them by looking at the tensor product of the corresponding representations of the subgroup of @xmath12 with the representation associated to a transverse field .",
    "these considerations give us the following rules .",
    "the nodes of the new quiver diagram are obtained by splitting and joining nodes in the old quiver diagram according to the counting given by the orbit of the node under @xmath12 .",
    "all the nodes in the orbit have the same rank .",
    "two orbits which are connected by arrows in the quiver of @xmath29 are connected by arrows in the quiver of @xmath5 .",
    "if the orbits have splitting nodes , then the arrows connect nodes that are split according to the representation of @xmath12 on the arrows .",
    "the above rules also work if the linear action of @xmath12 closes only up to gauge tranformations .",
    "the technical point which is distinct is that we do nt use representations of @xmath12 on the arrows , but representations of the lift of @xmath12 in @xmath67 , the group of automorphisms of the quiver . on the arrows of @xmath29",
    "is only well defined up to gauge transformations .",
    "gauge tranformations correspond to inner automorphisms @xmath68 of the quiver , and thus the action of @xmath12 is an _",
    "automorphism of the quiver diagram , @xmath69 .",
    "] this lift is still finite , but the group is larger than @xmath12 , and it is not true that the fields are representations of @xmath12 in general .",
    "some still might be , whereas some others might not be .",
    "the best way to understand the application of these rules is to consider a number of examples .",
    "first , we will consider the @xmath70 singularity .",
    "a seemingly trivial second example is provided by @xmath22 .",
    "however , there is an important subtlety that arises here which is important for our later discussions .",
    "we consider the binary dihedral group @xmath70 , which is the @xmath72 extension of the ordinary dihedral group @xmath73 .",
    "@xmath70 has no discrete torsion ( _ i.e. _ @xmath74 ) and thus there is only one choice of orbifold .    consider the exact sequence @xmath75 this means that @xmath70 has a normal subgroup @xmath76 .",
    "we want to show that the quiver for the binary dihedral group may be obtained from the @xmath76 quiver in a natural way .",
    "in other words , the exact sequence ( [ eq : dk - exact ] ) permits us to think about the orbifold @xmath71 in terms of a @xmath72 action on the orbifold @xmath77 ( _ i.e. _ @xmath78 ) .",
    "the only irreducible representations of the cyclic group @xmath16 are @xmath79-th roots of unity , @xmath80 , where @xmath81 and the index @xmath82 .",
    "the quiver for the orbifold @xmath83 is the @xmath84 quiver in the @xmath85-@xmath86-@xmath87 classification .",
    "the binary dihedral group @xcite is generated by two elements satisfying @xmath88 this group , of order @xmath89 , has four one - dimensional irreducible representations , which we label @xmath90 : @xmath91 and @xmath92 two - dimensional irreducible representations , which we label @xmath93 .",
    "a particular choice of basis for the @xmath94s is @xmath95 with the index @xmath96 .",
    "all other representations of @xmath70 are either reducible or are @xmath97 equivalent to the ones listed here .",
    "( in particular , @xmath98 and @xmath99 are @xmath97 equivalent . ) the quiver for this theory is shown in figure [ fig : dkquiver.eps ] .",
    "( here we use @xmath100 notation , so a line corresponds to a hypermultiplet ( a pair of arrows ) . )",
    "now let us reproduce these results using the techniques that we have discussed above .",
    "first we must identify the action of @xmath72 on the @xmath84 quiver .",
    "it is easily seen that the @xmath72 acts by identifying a root of unity with its inverse .",
    "thus , the node for @xmath101 is identified with @xmath102 for @xmath103 .",
    "note that under this @xmath72 action the nodes corresponding to @xmath104 and @xmath105 map to themselves .",
    "the nodes which are in a 2-orbit of @xmath72 combine to form a 2-node of the new quiver ; a node that is in a 1-orbit splits into two 1-nodes .",
    "thus , we get a total of @xmath106 two - dimensional irreducible representations and four one - dimensional irreducible representations .",
    "the lines connecting nodes are inherited from the @xmath76 quiver : each pair of @xmath107s connects to one of the @xmath94s , while the @xmath94s connect to each other along a line .",
    "thus we reproduce the @xmath70 quiver , figure [ fig : dkquiver.eps ] .",
    "the same prescription applies for the binary polyhedral groups can not be obtained in this way , as there is no such useful exact sequence . ]",
    "@xmath108 and @xmath109 since we have the exact sequences @xcite @xmath110 diagramatically , the quivers of these are obtained in figures [ fig : d2hatz3.eps ] and [ fig : e6hatz2.eps ] , where orbits are denoted by the dotted lines .",
    "since @xmath72 is a normal subgroup of @xmath22 , we have the exact sequence @xmath112 this is one of the examples where one can choose the lift of @xmath72 to the automorphisms of the quiver to involve gauge transformations .",
    "if the left @xmath72 subgroup is generated by @xmath62 , the right @xmath72 action in the @xmath72 quiver must square to give @xmath113 so that we obtain a @xmath22 action .",
    "thus we see that we must consider here an action of the right @xmath72 which is a representation only up to a gauge transformation .",
    "the quiver diagram of @xmath72 consists of a pair of nodes , @xmath114 and @xmath115 connected by a pair of bifundamentals .",
    "the group @xmath116 acts trivially on @xmath117 by sending each node to itself .",
    "rule ( 1 ) tells us that the quiver for @xmath22 contains four nodes of rank 1 .",
    "rule ( 2 ) tells us that each of the nodes that formed from the splitting of the node @xmath114 connects to each of the nodes that formed from the splitting of the node @xmath115 via hypermultiplets .",
    "notice that in the quiver of @xmath72 we have two hypermultiplets , each corresponding to two arrows between the same two representations running in opposite directions .",
    "we have four @xmath118 superfields , two going from node one to node two @xmath119 , @xmath120 and two going backwards @xmath121 .",
    "the @xmath72 generated by @xmath122 takes @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "notice that @xmath125 takes @xmath126 for all @xmath127 , and this can be interpreted as an action by multiplying all the superfields by @xmath115 , which is a gauge transformation on one of the nodes by @xmath128 .    by this construction ,",
    "the nodes corresponding to @xmath129 transform differently than the nodes coresponding to @xmath130 .",
    "in particular the arrows @xmath131 and @xmath132 will join different representations . straightening out the crossed lines , we obtain the @xmath133 quiver .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig : babyex.eps ] .",
    "the orbifold @xmath111 is an orbifold of an orbifold , @xmath134 .    of course",
    ", these quivers may be obtained in the standard way without difficulty .",
    "the techniques are more powerful , however , when discrete torsion is involved",
    ". we shall now provide a derivation of the quiver rules listed above before analyzing these examples and others , which include discrete torsion , in greater detail .",
    "in the general case one wants to understand how to add discrete torsion .",
    "the purpose of this section is to address this issue",
    ". we will begin by considering in particular the orbifold @xmath135 where the @xmath136 act by linear transformations on the generators of @xmath9 . in later sections we consider a series of examples , generally of non - abelian groups with discrete torsion .",
    "all of these examples may be thought of as ( semi- ) direct products , and thus it is important to study the general case in detail .",
    "since the orbifold group is a direct product , we clearly have an exact sequence @xmath137 and so , from the discussion of the previous section , we can consider @xmath138 the general question we want to answer now is the following : what is the quiver diagram for this orbifold given a choice of discrete torsion of the group @xmath139 ?    to answer the question , first we note that there is a formula for the discrete torsion of @xmath140 @xcite : @xmath141.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] alternately , by a theorem of yamazaki @xcite , we may write @xmath142 where we have @xmath143 $ ] , the commutator subgroup of @xmath5 .",
    "thus , discrete torsion has several sources . in light of the structure ( [ eq : prodbrk ] ) , if @xmath144 , this should be taken into account for the quiver corresponding to @xmath145 .",
    "we will concentrate on the case where @xmath146 ; this is an important simplifying assumption , and in any case is true for all of the examples that we consider .",
    "the remaining source of discrete torsion is the `` interaction '' term @xmath147 .",
    "the group @xmath148 is the group of one - dimensional irreducible representations of @xmath5 , with multiplication given by the tensor product of representations .",
    "generally , we will refer to elements of this group by @xmath149 .",
    "the case of abelian @xmath151 is particularly simple .",
    "if @xmath150 is the cyclic group @xmath16 , we have @xmath152 , the group of characters of @xmath150 .",
    "in this case we have @xmath153 a choice of discrete torsion amounts to a choice of subgroup of the characters of @xmath154 .",
    "we now need to consider representations of the group algebra of @xmath155 with the choice of discrete torsion",
    ".    we will write @xmath62 as the generator of @xmath150 .",
    "the group algebra @xmath50 will be generated by @xmath62 and the generators of @xmath156 .",
    "because @xmath7 is a product group , @xmath157 and @xmath158 can differ only by a phase , and in fact @xmath159 for any @xmath160 and @xmath161 . as a result",
    ", we can think of @xmath62 as acting on the elements ( [ eq : grpalgrel ] ) of the group algebra @xmath162 and this is an outer automorphism of @xmath163 .",
    "in particular , the action of @xmath62 leaves the center @xmath164 invariant .",
    "we conclude that it acts on the representations of @xmath156 by permutations . because of ( [ eq : distor ] )",
    ", @xmath62 takes a representation @xmath165 to @xmath166 , which is irreducible and has the same dimension as @xmath165 .    a first step then in constructing the quiver of @xmath167 is to decide on how @xmath62 permutes the nodes of the @xmath168 quiver .",
    "the bottom line is that different choices of discrete torsion correspond to different sets of orbits of nodes .",
    "we will discuss the representations of @xmath156 in terms of projectors @xmath58 , as in section [ sec : two ] . in the present case",
    ", every element of the center of the algebra can be written as @xmath169 where @xmath170 .",
    "we also have @xmath171 for all @xmath172 .",
    "that is , only if @xmath173 acts trivially on the orbit of @xmath174 , can we have @xmath175 .",
    "thus for each orbit of representations of the group @xmath156 of order @xmath176 , we get @xmath177 distinct representations , which appear as nodes in the new quiver .",
    "note that a given value of @xmath178 is a multiple of @xmath176 .    to be more specific ,",
    "we implement the action of @xmath62 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : distor ] ) .",
    "choose a basis @xmath179 for the vector space where @xmath156 acts block diagonally .",
    "then @xmath180 transforms under @xmath156 as @xmath181 .",
    "consider a matrix representation for @xmath62 ; we can write this in terms of an invertible matrix @xmath182 as @xmath183 if we think of elements of @xmath156 as block diagonal @xmath184 then @xmath62 takes the form @xmath185 here , we have a set of @xmath176 @xmath63-dimensional representations @xmath186 that are permuted by @xmath62 ( that is , @xmath187 ) .",
    "by @xmath188 transformations , we can set the determinants of each submatrix @xmath189 to unity , leaving an overall phase @xmath190 in @xmath62 .",
    "since @xmath191 , we must have @xmath192 . by acting with @xmath173",
    ", we get an element which belongs to the center of the twisted group algebra . on an irreducible represention",
    "this is proportional to the identity .",
    "thus @xmath193 .",
    "without loss of generality , we can take @xmath194 , and thus @xmath195 .",
    "since @xmath190 is an @xmath79-th root of unity it might appear that we get @xmath79 distinct representations this way .",
    "however , there is an @xmath196 transformation that takes @xmath197 , where @xmath198 .",
    "thus , we reproduce the result that there are @xmath177 distinct irreducible representations of dimension @xmath199 of the group for each of these orbits",
    ".    notice that if we sum the square of the dimensions of the representations over all orbits we get @xmath200 each orbit is made of exactly @xmath176 distinct irreducible ( projective ) representations of @xmath156 , so the sum over orbits covers the sum over irreducible representations of @xmath156 .",
    "thus @xmath201 with a given cocyle .",
    "thus we have obtained all of the nodes of the quiver in this way .",
    "if @xmath150 is non - abelian it is not true in general that @xmath202 is equivalent to @xmath150 ; there is an exact sequence of groups @xmath203 with @xmath204 the kernel of the group map .",
    "in such a case , an orbifold @xmath205 may be understood as @xmath206 ; this reduces the non - abelian quotient to an abelian one , provided we understand how the discrete torsion behaves for a sequence of groups as above . in general this particular problem is complicated , but we can apply the same ideas as before to build representations .",
    "discrete torsion in orbifolds of the abelian product groups has been extensively studied @xcite , so we utilize the tools we have developed for constructing quivers to analyze several non - abelian ( semi- ) direct product groups .",
    "the dedicated reader may find it instructive to apply our methods to the @xmath207 case . here , we will focus on some of the non - abelian discrete subgroups of @xmath24 .",
