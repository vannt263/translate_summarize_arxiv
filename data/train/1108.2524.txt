    "nuclear reactions form one of the most important probes for the limits of stability and the role of the underlying fundamental interactions .",
    "transfer reactions offer a plethora of opportunities for studying shell structure because one can access ground as well as excited states ( including resonances ) , and by choosing appropriately the kinematic conditions , one can explore peripheral properties as well as the nuclear surface . for this reason",
    ", they constitute an important part of the science program of many rare isotopes facilities worldwide .",
    "examples of recent studies include @xmath2sn@xmath3sn  @xcite , @xmath4c@xmath5c  @xcite , and @xmath6ar@xmath7  @xcite .",
    "the increased interest in using transfer reactions as a tool to study these exotic nuclei has called for reaction - theory developments  @xcite .",
    "whereas in the sixties the standard approach to one - nucleon transfer was to rely on the first - order distorted - wave born approximation ( dwba ) , it is now well understood that in @xmath0 reactions , breakup is important and first - order perturbation is insufficient to describe the process . a practical method for including deuteron breakup was introduced by johnson and soper  @xcite within a zero - range approximation , usually referred to as the adiabatic wave approximation ( adwa ) .",
    "in addition to including deuteron breakup to all orders , the adwa depends exclusively on nucleon optical - potentials rather than the more ambiguous deuteron optical - potential as in dwba .",
    "adwa was later extended by tandy and johnson  @xcite to include finite - range effects ( fr - adwa )",
    ". a recent systematic study of @xmath0 reactions within fr - adwa  @xcite has shown the importance of finite - range effects in considering deuteron breakup in @xmath0 reactions .",
    "the method explored in refs .",
    "@xcite is based on the truncation of a weinberg expansion . in ref .",
    "@xcite a systematic comparison between @xmath0 angular distributions for fr - adwa and those from the exact full faddeev solution is performed .",
    "the results from fr - adwa  @xcite are within 10% of the full solution at forward angle , for a wide range of beam - energies  @xcite . while the exact full solution is computationally intensive and expensive , fr - adwa calculations are clearly of practical use .",
    "the work in @xcite determines the level of accuracy of fr - adwa concerning the solution of the three - body @xmath8 dynamics in the reaction .",
    "for the ( d , p ) reactions on @xmath9ca at 19 mev and 56 mev effects are 6% and 3% respectively @xcite . with this level of accuracy",
    "it is now essential to have good control over the ingredients to the problem , namely the effective interactions .",
    "all applications of fr - adwa so far have relied on global optical potentials for the nucleon - target interactions and `` standard single - particle parameters '' for the effective interaction that determines the final neutron bound state . so far , these two types of input have been disconnected .",
    "future extraction of nucleon properties in rare isotopes will require presently unavailable knowledge of nucleon - target interactions in the continuum as well as bound - state information .",
    "an attractive feature of the recently implemented dispersive optical - model ( dom )  @xcite is that it intrinsically connects the scattering and bound states .",
    "the method , first introduced by mahaux and sartor  @xcite , and also known as the dynamic polarization potential ( dpp ) , relies on the dispersion relation between the imaginary and real parts of the nucleon self - energy . the work of ref .  @xcite concentrated on the interaction between protons and ca isotopes and found larger correlations near the fermi surface with increasing nucleon asymmetry .",
    "neutrons were included in the fits reported in ref .",
    "that analysis raised questions concerning the standard parameterization of the imaginary part of the nucleon potentials as a function of asymmetry @xmath10 , particularly for neutrons .",
    "more recently , a non - local extension of the dom has been introduced that allows for a broader application to calculate observables below the fermi energy  @xcite .",
    "insight from _ ab initio _ calculations of the nucleon self - energy are expected to provide further guidance on the details of non - locality  @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we will use only the local version of the dom .",
    "its most recent implementation  @xcite yields an accurate representation of a wealth of data in several locations of the chart of nuclides , including nuclei with @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( fit1 ) , nuclei with @xmath13 , with @xmath14 ( fit2 ) , and finally @xmath15 ( fit3 ) .",
    "when several isotopes or isotones are included in the fit , the observed nucleon asymmetry dependence of the potentials allows for an extrapolation to nuclei that are more exotic  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding predictions can thus be probed with future experiments that may allow further refinements .",
    "this feature of data - driven extrapolations to the respective drip lines and its capacity to link both reaction and structure information make the dom an excellent framework to study rare isotopes",
    ".    in dom fits  @xcite , nucleon elastic , total and reaction cross section data , as well as bound - state properties inferred from @xmath1 measurements , are all included simultaneously .",

    "the neutron and proton coordinates , which are taken at the center of mass of the target @xmath26 , are given by @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "we take @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 to be the neutron - target , proton - target , and neutron - proton interactions . in this work ,",
    "we use the reid potential  @xcite for @xmath32 and dom potentials for @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( see sect .",
    "[ theory - dom ] ) .    in this three - body approach ,",
    "the solution of eq .",
    "( [ 3b - eq ] ) is inserted into the exact transfer matrix element : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the bound state of the neutron - target system , and @xmath37 is a proton scattering distorted wave in the outgoing channel .",
    "the remnant operator is @xmath38 .",
    "contributions from this term are often small except for the lighter systems .",
    "johnson and tandy  @xcite noted from eq .",
    "( [ t - eq ] ) that the exact three - body wavefunction @xmath39 is only needed within the range of the @xmath32 interaction , whenever the remnant contributions are negligible . for this reason ,",
    "the weinberg states , which form a complete square integrable basis within the range of @xmath32 , offer an excellent representation for the three - body scattering wavefunction : @xmath40 here @xmath41 denote weinberg states , normalized by @xmath42 and satisfying : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the deuteron binding energy and @xmath45 are the eigenvalues . inserting eq .",
    "( [ weinberg1 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ 3b - eq ] ) one arrives at a non - trivial coupled - channels scattering equation .",
    "however , if only the first term in the weinberg expansion of eq.([weinberg1 ] ) is necessary to describe transfer , then eq.([3b - eq ] ) becomes a single - channel optical - model - type equation : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the normalization coefficient defined as @xmath48 .",

    "one important advantage of adwa over dwba , is that adwa depends on nucleon optical - potentials rather than the deuteron optical - potential , which is far more ambiguous .",
    "adwa also depends on the nucleon binding potential , as does the dwba .",
    "since these nucleon optical and binding potentials are connected by a dispersion relation in the dom approach , it is interesting to test how the dom potentials perform in describing transfer angular distributions for a wide range of energies and targets . in the next subsection",
    "we give a brief summary of the recent developments with dom nucleon optical - potentials .",
    "the dispersive optical - model  @xcite develops a practical representation of the irreducible nucleon self - energy @xmath54 from the greens - function approach to the many - body problem  @xcite .",
    "the real part of the nucleon self - energy or optical - model potential can be decomposed into an energy - independent non - local part and a dynamic contribution ( energy - dependent ) , that can also be non - local , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath55where @xmath56 is the fermi energy .",
    "the second term , referred to as the dispersive correction , can be obtained from the imaginary part through the subtracted dispersion relation @xmath57where @xmath58 stands for the principal value and we note the convention to employ the same sign for the imaginary part of the self - energy above and below the fermi energy  @xcite . by definition in eq .",
    "( [ eq : self ] ) , the dispersive correction is zero at the fermi energy .",
    "the dispersive correction varies rapidly around @xmath59 and causes the valence single - particle levels to be focused towards the fermi energy .    following a long tradition  @xcite ,",
    "the non - local energy - independent term @xmath60 is approximated by a local energy - dependent form , generally designated as the hartree - fock ( hf ) potential @xmath61 . while it does describe mean - field properties , it is not strictly a hf contribution , since it involves the complete self - energy at one particular energy .",
    "the energy derivative of @xmath62 encodes a measure of the non - locality , which is related to the momentum - dependent effective mass @xmath63where @xmath64 is the nucleon mass .    the local approximation of the hf potential necessitates a scaled imaginary potential given by @xmath65 and a similarly scaled dispersive correction . for lack of detailed theoretical input , the imaginary part of the self - energy is also approximated by a local potential in keeping with a long - standing tradition of empirical optical potentials .",
    "we note that the dispersive correction is correspondingly local . the nucleon self - energy , as typically represented in the dom ,",
    "can then be written as @xmath66    the fermi energy is defined as @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 represent the binding energy for adding or removing a nucleon , or alternatively , the single - particle energies of the valence particle and hole states .",
    "since the current implementation of the dom includes scattering data up to 200 mev , a lowest - order relativistic correction is employed in solving the radial wave equation  @xcite @xmath70   u\\left ( \\rho \\right ) = 0   \\label{eq : radial}\\]]with @xmath71 , where @xmath72 , @xmath73 is the laboratory kinetic energy , @xmath74 is the total energy in the center - of - mass frame , and @xmath75 is the target mass .",

    "( [ eq : radial ] ) .",
    "it should be emphasized that these corrected wave functions correspond to overlap functions for adding or removing particle from the target nucleus  @xcite , _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath82 where @xmath83 is normalized to one and @xmath84 represents the spectroscopic factor ( norm of the overlap function ) .",
    "the solutions @xmath85 therefore still need to be normalized by the spectroscopic factor which is obtained in the dom from : @xmath86where the energy - dependent effective mass determines the reduction of strength from the mean - field value and is given by @xmath87 the result for the spectroscopic factor in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sf ] ) was derived in ref .",
    "@xcite and was shown to be an excellent quantitative approximation to the corresponding solution of the dyson equation that incorporates a non - local hf in ref .",
    "we will also include results for the root - mean - square ( rms ) radius given by @xmath88 in the dom analysis .    in the present work , we will extract the normalization of the overlap functions from the analysis of the transfer reactions by scaling the theoretical cross section to match the data .",

    "these wave functions will be referred to as @xmath91 .",
    "an important additional experimental constraint on the overlap function at large distances ( when available ) is provided by an asymptotic normalization constant ( anc ) .",
    "the single particle anc @xmath92 is defined through the asymptotic behavior of the single particle state @xmath93 @xmath94 where @xmath95 , @xmath96 is the corresponding reduced mass and @xmath97 is mormalized to one .",

[ cols=\"^,<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     most of the reactions studied in this work are not sensitive to details of the overlap function in the interior , but rather to the anc  @xcite .",
    "for completeness , in table [ anc ] we present the square of the many - body ancs obtained directly from the spectroscopic factors presented in table [ sfact ] , multiplied by the square of the single - particle anc ( @xmath103 ) .",

    "the analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite shows that with that large anc , there is no consistency between the expected spectroscopic factor for @xmath104ca and the @xmath16ca@xmath17ca data above the coulomb barrier . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is also shown that to obtain consistency between sub - coulomb and above coulomb energies one needs an anc about half that value .",
    "this work solves the discrepancy seen for @xmath104ca in ref .",
    "the anc for @xmath107ca was determined in ref .",
    "@xcite from a dwba analysis of sub - coulomb @xmath0 data to be @xmath108 @xmath106 .",
    "this value is consistent with the values we obtain using ch89+ws . using the dom instead , the anc in ref .",
    "@xcite should be significantly reduced .",
    "an analysis of the @xmath2sn@xmath3sn reaction around the coulomb barrier  @xcite using fr - adwa and the ch89 optical potentials generates an anc for the ground state of @xmath109 @xmath106 .",
    "this value would significantly be reduced if dom were used instead . finally , in ref .",
    "@xcite an anc for @xmath110pb is extracted from heavy ion reactions @xmath111 @xmath106 using dwba .",
    "this value is close to the dom theoretical prediction .",
    "the transfer results for @xmath19pb are problematic for two reasons : i ) there is a very large discrepancy between the spectroscopic factors obtained at @xmath112 mev and @xmath113 mev , and ii ) for the sub - coulomb barrier energy , this value is much larger than unity .",
    "no issues arose in the dom fitting for this nucleus and therefore the dom fits can be considered reliable for the elastic and total cross - section data .",
    "even though the transfer angular distributions are well described within fr - adwa , we can not exclude the possibility of target excitation . in order to test whether the cause for inconsistency is the reaction mechanism , we performed exploratory calculations including the low - lying @xmath114 and @xmath115 states in @xmath19pb and the strong octupole and quadrupole couplings between these states and the ground state within a coupled - channel born approximation ( ccba ) , using a global optical potential for the deuteron @xcite .",
    "one should keep in mind that , within a ccba approach , the extraction of the spectroscopic factor for a single orbital is obscured by other components .",
    "we found the effects to be strong for @xmath19pb(d , p ) at 20 mev but rather weak at the lower energy .",
    "we also performed coupled reaction channel calculations , iterating the transfer coupling , but again found the effects to be weak at the lower energy while significant at higher energy .",
    "these results suggest that at least for the higher energy , the reaction mechanism goes beyond the present implementation of adwa .",
    "the unrealistic sf obtained at the lower energy could indicate the failure of adwa . at present , for reactions involving such large coulomb fields , we can not verify the validity of adwa through the comparison with exact faddeev calculations .",
    "the present techniques used in solving the faddeev equations are limited to targets with @xmath116 .",
    "if the reaction mechanism for @xmath19pb@xmath0 at 20 mev necessitates the inclusion of target excitation , could this mechanism also play a role in our other test cases , even if the angular distributions are well described in our present formulation ? in ref .",
    "@xcite a study of target excitation in @xmath16ca@xmath17ca at low energy shows strong effects .",
    "however we expect these to be small at @xmath117 mev .",
    "the @xmath9ca nucleus has a very weak transition to its first excited state , and therefore no significant effect of target excitation is expected .",
    "target excitation was tested for the reaction on @xmath2sn and found to be negligible . nevertheless , the present results for @xmath19pb do call for an extension of the fr - adwa to include target excitation and deuteron breakup in a consistent framework .",
    "we have tested the performance of the dispersive optical - model potentials and corresponding overlap functions in @xmath0 reactions .",
    "we performed finite - range adiabatic calculations for a range of closed - shell nuclei covering a wide range of beam energies . within this description",
    ", the dom provides all necessary ingredients apart from the deuteron @xmath32 interaction , _",
    "i.e. _ nucleon optical - potentials and the mean - field binding the neutron in the final state .",
    "we compare the results obtained with the dom to those obtained using a global parameterization of the nucleon optical - potential and a standard geometry for the neutron single - particle overlap .",
    "we find that the dom performs as well as the ch89 parameterization in the description of the angular distributions .",
    "while spectroscopic factors extracted within the standard approach can be strongly dependent on the energy at which the @xmath0 data were obtained , this dependence is strongly suppressed when dom potentials are employed .",
    "the exception is @xmath19pb , a case for which coupled - channel calculations demonstrate the importance of target excitation .",
    "overall , we find that the extracted spectroscopic factors using dom are significantly reduced when compared to the standard approach , bringing the values more in line with those obtained from @xmath1 measurements .    because dom potentials can be extrapolated to rare isotopes and separate checks of their quality can be made by performing elastic nucleon ( proton ) scattering experiments in inverse kinematics , the present framework of the dom in which reaction and structure data are incorporated on the same footing , provides an excellent platform to analyze transfer reactions involving rare isotopes .",
