    "catalytically activated reactions ( cars ) involve particles which react only in the presence of another agent acting as a catalyst , and remain chemically inactive otherwise . usually , the catalyst is part of a solid , inert substrate placed in contact with fluid phases of the reactants , and the reaction takes place only between particles adsorbed on the substrate forming a ( dilute ) monolayer .",
    "these processes are widespread in nature and used in a variety of technological and industrial applications @xcite .",
    "the work of ziff , gulari , and barshad ( zgb ) @xcite on the `` monomer - dimer '' model , introduced as an idealized description of the process of @xmath7 oxidation on a catalytic surface , as well as the subsequent studies of a simpler `` monomer - monomer '' reaction model @xcite , represent an important step in the understanding of cars properties by revealing the emergence of an essentially collective behavior in the dynamics of the adsorbed monolayer . on two - dimensional ( 2d ) substrates , first- and second - order non - equilibrium phase transitions involving saturated , inactive phases ( substrate poisoning , i.e.",
    ", most of the adsorption sites are occupied by same - type particles ) and reactive steady - states have been evidenced and studied in detail @xcite .",
    "most of these available studies pertain to idealized homogeneous substrates .",
    "in contrast , the equilibrium properties of the adsorbed monolayer in the case of cars are much less studied and the understanding of the equilibrium state remains rather limited .",
    "moreover , actual substrates are typically disordered and generically the catalyst is an assembly of mobile or localized catalytic sites or islands @xcite ; the recently developed artificially designed catalysts @xcite involve inert substrates which are decorated by catalytic particles .",
    "theoretical studies which have addressed the behavior of cars on disordered substrates have been so far focused on the effect of site - dependent adsorption / desorption rates because natural catalysts are , in general , energetically heterogeneous @xcite ; only few studies , in particular some exactly solvable 1d models of @xmath8 reactions and a smoluchowski - type analysis of @xmath9-dimensional cars @xcite , have addressed the case of spatially heterogeneous catalyst distribution .",
    "recently , we have presented a simple model of a monomer - monomer @xmath2 reaction on a 2d inhomogeneous , catalyst decorated substrate , and we have shown that for the case of _ annealed _ disorder in the placement of the catalytic bonds the reaction model under study can be mapped onto the general spin @xmath10 ( gs1 ) model @xcite with effective , temperature dependent couplings @xcite .",
    "this allows us to exploit the large number of results obtained for the gs1 model @xcite in order to elucidate , within a mean - field description @xcite , the equilibrium properties of the monolayer binary - mixture of reactive monomers on a 2d substrate randomly - decorated by a catalyst .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model ] we briefly present the model for a binary - mixture monolayer with an @xmath11 reaction on a 2d inhomogeneous , catalyst decorated substrate and the mapping to a gs1 model ; in sec .",
    "[ mean_field ] we present the mean - field ( mf ) approximation .",
    "section  [ q0_and_q1 ] is devoted to a discussion of the mf phase diagram for the particular cases of a completely catalytic substrate , i.e. , @xmath12 , and of an inert substrate , i.e. , @xmath13 , respectively . in sec .",

    "[ summary ] .",
    "we consider a 2d regular lattice ( coordination number @xmath14 ) of @xmath15 adsorption sites ( fig .  [ fig1 ] ) , which is in contact with the mixed vapor phase of @xmath0 and @xmath1 particles .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 particles can adsorb onto @xmath16 sites , and can desorb back to the reservoir .",
    "the system is characterized by chemical potentials @xmath17 maintained at constant values and measured relative to the binding energy of an occupied site , so that @xmath18 corresponds to a preference for adsorption .",
    "both @xmath0 and @xmath1 particles have hard cores prohibiting double occupancy of the adsorption sites and nearest - neighbor ( nn ) attractive @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath19 interactions of strengths @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "the occupation of the @xmath23-th site is described by a `` spin '' variable @xmath24 we assign , at random , to some of the lattice bonds ( solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) `` catalytic '' properties such that if an @xmath0 and a @xmath1 particle occupy simultaneously nn sites connected by such a catalytic bond , they instantaneously react and desorb , and the product ( @xmath25 ) leaves the system ; @xmath0 and @xmath1 particles occupying nn sites not connected by a catalytic bond harmlessly coexist , and we assume that the reverse process of a simultaneous adsorption of an @xmath0 and a @xmath1 on a catalytic bond has an extremely low probability and can be neglected .",
    "the `` catalytic '' character of the lattice bonds is described by variables @xmath26 , where @xmath27 denotes a pair of nn sites @xmath23 and @xmath28 , @xmath29 and we take @xmath30 as independent , identically distributed random variables with the probability distribution @xmath31 note that the probability @xmath4 that a given bond is catalytic equals the mean density of the catalytic bonds .",
    "the two limiting cases , @xmath13 and @xmath12 , correspond to an _ inert _ substrate and to a _ homogeneous catalytic _ one , respectively .",
    "we further assume that the condition of instantaneous reaction @xmath11 together with negligible simultaneous adsorption of an @xmath0 and a @xmath1 particle on a catalytic bond is formally equivalent to allowing a nn @xmath19 repulsive interaction of strength @xmath32 , followed by the limit @xmath33 , for @xmath19 pairs connected by catalytic bonds .    as shown in ref.@xcite , in thermal equilibrium and for situations in which the disorder in the placement of the catalytic bonds is _ annealed _ ,",
    "i.e. , the partition function , rather than its logarithm , is averaged over the disorder , the model under study is mapped exactly onto that of a gs1 model .",

    "this model reduces to the original blume - emery - griffiths ( beg ) model @xcite in zero magnetic field @xmath41 .",
    "the mean - field analysis follows closely the presentation in ref.@xcite and thus here we only briefly outline the main steps .",
    "the starting point is the variational principle for the free energy @xmath42 ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite ) @xmath43 : =   \\tr(\\rho \\mathcal{h}_{e } ) + k_b t \\tr(\\rho \\ln \\rho)\\ , \\label{variational}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is any trial density matrix , i.e. , @xmath45 ; the equality holds for @xmath46 $ ] , where @xmath47 and @xmath48 denotes the sum over all spin configurations .    within the mean - field approximation the trial density @xmath44",
    "is chosen from the subspace of products of single - site densities , i.e. , @xmath49 ; furthermore restricting to the case of translationally invariant states , i.e. , @xmath50 being independent of @xmath23 , leads to trial densities of the form @xmath51 .",
    "note that this last restriction implies that within the present approximation the analysis can not account for the occurrence of staggered states ( i.e. , splitting in ordered sub - lattices ) and the emphasis is put on the disordered and ordered homogeneous states .",
    "the single site density @xmath52 minimizing the functional @xmath53 , subject to the constraint @xmath54 , is @xmath55\\,,\\nonumber\\\\ h & = -j ' m \\sigma_1 + ( \\delta - k ' q ) \\sigma_1",

    "this leads to the following approximation @xmath61 of the free energy per - site : @xmath62/n =   \\frac{1}{2}(j ' m^2 + k ' q^2 ) - \\frac{1}{\\beta }   \\ln\\left[1 + 2 e^{-\\beta \\delta } e^{\\beta k ' q}\\cosh(\\beta j ' m)\\right]\\ , .",
    "\\label{f_minimize}\\ ] ] note that in the binary mixture language the values of the magnetization and of the quadrupolar moment [ eq.([m_and_q ] ) ] represent the difference and the sum ( total coverage ) of the average densities @xmath63 and @xmath64 of @xmath0 and @xmath1 species , respectively : @xmath65    for given values of the temperature @xmath34 and of the field @xmath66 [ eq.([param ] ) ] , the order parameters @xmath59 and @xmath60 are obtained by solving eqs.([rho_min ] ) and ( [ m_and_q ] ) .",
    "the pair @xmath67 characterizing the state of the system is selected from the possible solutions as the one which minimizes @xmath61 in eq.([f_minimize ] ) above .",
    "explicitely , the equations determining @xmath59 and @xmath60 are : @xmath68 @xmath69 note that there is always a solution of these equations with @xmath70 , i.e. , a disordered state ( or , in the language of binary mixtures , a mixed state ) .    alternatively , one may search directly for the absolute minimum of the per - site free - energy function with respect to @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the values @xmath59 and @xmath60 at the minimum ( minima in case of phase equilibria ) will define the thermodynamically stable phase(s ) . while the first formulation is more useful for analytical work , reduced to analyzing the number of solutions of two coupled algebraic equations , the latter is advantageous for numerical calculations . in the following",
    "we shall use both of them . before proceeding we",
    "note that @xmath71 [ eq . ( [ f_minimize ] ) ] is an even function of @xmath59 ( i.e. , invariant under the change @xmath72 ) , and thus in the following we shall restrict the discussion to the case @xmath73 ; the states with @xmath74 are immediately obtained via a change of sign .",
    "this is a consequence of the symmetry in the chemical potentials ( @xmath75 ) or , in the magnetic language , of a vanishing magnetic field @xmath38 . in other words , in the space spanned by @xmath76 the phase diagrams in the plane @xmath38 along the @xmath77 side and any equilibrium state characterized by @xmath78 have corresponding phase diagrams and states @xmath79 located on the @xmath80 side .",
    "the case of a homogeneous , completely catalytic substrate can be studied analytically because of the particular form of the interaction parameters @xmath81 and @xmath82 . in the limit @xmath83 ,",
    "( [ param ] ) implies : @xmath84 while @xmath85 remains finite in this limit .",
    "the analysis of eqs.([eq_m ] ) and ( [ eq_q ] ) proceeds as follows . from eq.([eq_q ] ) , the solutions with @xmath70 , i.e. , disorder states , have the quadrupolar moment @xmath86 for any finite temperature and finite chemical potential @xmath87 .",
    "this corresponds to an empty lattice state .    taking the ratio of eqs.([eq_m ] ) and ( [ eq_q ] ) we find that the ordered states , @xmath88 , satisfy @xmath89 in this limit the substrate is occupied by a single species , either @xmath0 or @xmath1 with equal probability . with @xmath90 , for any finite temperature and finite chemical potential @xmath59 is determined from @xmath91 it is easy to see that eq.([mord_q1 ] ) has a solution @xmath92 for any @xmath93 and any @xmath87 .",
    "thus , in virtue of eq.([qord_q1 ] ) , the lattice is occupied , with equal probability , either by @xmath94 particles of species @xmath0 or by @xmath95 particles of species @xmath1 .      in the case of a catalytically inert substrate ,",
    "@xmath13 , we have @xmath96 and thus the model reduces to the classical beg model , whose mean - field approximation has been analyzed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the following we",
    "briefly summarize the main aspects of the phase diagram of the beg model such that in the general case @xmath97 we can isolate the effects solely due to the disordered distribution of the catalyst .",
    "moreover , as will be shown in the next section , the equilibrium properties of the adsorbate in the general case @xmath97 can be easily rationalized from the ones on the inert substrate .",
    "first we note that for non - interacting particles , i.e. , for @xmath98 so that @xmath99 , eq.([eq_m ] ) implies that @xmath70 , and thus eq.([eq_q ] ) leads to @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the fugacity , rendering the classical langmuir adsorption result .    for the case of non - zero interaction parameters @xmath28 and @xmath22 , only the qualitative features of the phase - diagram can be analytically derived ( for details see ref.@xcite ) ; here we shall present phase diagrams obtained via direct numerical minimization of the free energy function @xmath61 [ eq.([f_minimize ] ) ] . using @xmath102 as energy scale ,",

    "the reason for the latter restriction is that for sufficiently negative values @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is a threshold value , it is known that the system will split into ordered sub - lattices @xcite .",
    "however , such states are not captured by the present formulation of the mean - field equations which assume translational invariance .    before proceeding with the numerical analysis , we list several general features of the phase diagram that can be obtained from the analysis of eqs.([eq_m ] ) and ( [ eq_q ] ) . + * ( i ) * for @xmath88 , eq.([eq_m ] ) can be written as @xmath111}_{\\hspace*{1.cm}:=g_1(x;t ) }   + \\underbrace{t x \\exp(-u / t )   \\exp(-\\kappa_0 q / t)}_{\\hspace*{1.3cm}:=g_2(x;t , u ) }   = 0\\ , , \\label{eq_t}\\ ] ] where @xmath112 .",
    "since @xmath113 is a strictly increasing function of @xmath114 , it follows that @xmath115 ; moreover , one has @xmath116 , from which one can conclude that for @xmath117 eq.([eq_t ] ) has only the solution @xmath118 , i.e. , there are no ordered states for @xmath117 .",

    "this is an intuitive result : @xmath123 corresponds to a preference for desorption ; thus at low negative chemical potential the substrate is covered by a low density two - dimensional gas ( which is a mixed phase ) . + * ( iii ) * for @xmath124 and finite temperatures , @xmath125 , and thus eq.([eq_t ] ) reduces to @xmath126 which is equivalent to @xmath127 .",

    "increasing the chemical potential @xmath105 at fixed temperature @xmath147 , the system undergoes a first - order phase transition at @xmath148 ( the white dashed line located at @xmath149 ) upon which the density of the monolayer increases abruptly to almost one [ as indicated by the dark blue color in fig .",
