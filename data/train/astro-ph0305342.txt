    "provides a direct probe of the primordial power spectrum and the overall cosmological parameters .",
    "this technique has been applied most cleanly to galaxy clusters , whose number densities and evolution provide strong constraints on the overall matter density ( eg . , eke , cole , & frenk 1996 ; bahcall , fan , & cen 1997 ; carlberg , yee , & ellingson 1997 ) .    similarly , because the density peaks in which objects form are more clustered than the underlying mass distribution , the clustering of virialized structures provide a wealth of information .",
    "this `` geometrical bias '' is a systematic function of the mass of these structures , an effect that has been well - studied analytically and numerically ( kaiser 1984 ; bardeen et al .",

    "; jing 1999 ; scannapieco & barkana 2002 ) .",
    "perhaps the most famous measurement of this biasing has been in the large sample of @xmath2 galaxies made available by the lyman - break color - selection technique ( adelberger et al .",
    "1998 ; steidel et al .  1998 ) .",
    "early papers pointed out that if the mass of these lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) could be determined , their clustering would serve as a sensitive test of cosmology ( mo & fukugita 1996 ; adelberger et al.1998 ; giavalisco et al .",
    "later efforts inverted this approach , using a wide range of cosmological constraints to compute the bias of lbgs and relate this to their overall mass ( eg .  coles et al .  1998 ; giavalisco & dickenson 2001 ; shu , mao , & mo 2001 ; wechsler et al.2001 ; porciani & giavalisco 2002 ) .",
    "such comparisons have shown that the clustering of lbgs brighter than @xmath3 is roughly that expected from the geometrical bias of @xmath4 objects in the currently favored cosmological model .",
    "furthermore , the theoretical number density of @xmath4 objects at @xmath5 is consistent with the observed densities of lbgs , roughly @xmath6 mpc@xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the hubble constant in units of 100 km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 . thus counting and correlating",
    "suggest a one - to - one correspondence between lbgs and @xmath4 objects .",
    "yet there are problems with this simple picture .",
    "lbgs are extremely luminous in their rest - frame uv , implying star formation rates on the order of @xmath0 per year ( eg .  adelberger & steidel 2000 ) .",
    "thus a one - to - one correspondence means that _ all _ @xmath4 objects must be forming stars at an enormous rate at @xmath5 .",
    "furthermore , the linewidths measured from the nebular emission of a spectroscopic sample of the brightest of such galaxies gives projected velocity dispersions of @xmath9 km / s ( pettini et al .",
    "2001 ) , which correspond to total masses @xmath10 , if interpreted as circular velocities .    in this _",
    "letter _ we explore an alternative possibility .",
    "we associate lbgs with a limited subset of objects that experience an appreciable increase in mass , which we naturally associate with a starburst . through a detailed numerical simulation",
    "we show that such accreting groups are more clustered than the general population , mimicking the properties of higher - mass halos , and modifying the mass scales that are most naturally associated with lbgs .",
    "this `` temporal biasing '' has never before been measured in simulations , and is not dependent on any merger criteria or properties of the accreted material .",
    "however the idea that lbgs correspond to merger induced starbursts has been proposed ( eg .  kolatt et al .",
    "1999 ) , and several authors have conducted numerical studies of the bias of mergers , obtaining mixed results .",
    "kauffmann & haehnelt ( 2002 ) analyzed the cross - correlation between objects undergoing major - mergers and the general population , finding weak enhancement at small distances .",
    "gottber et al .",
    "( 2002 ) found that applying a merger criterion at @xmath11 can effect the bias of objects at @xmath12 finally , percival et al .",
    "( 2003 , hereafter p03 ) applied a set of merger criteria at @xmath13 yr intervals , failing to obtain enhancement as discussed in detail below .",

    "4 we present our results for the correlation functions of these samples , and a discussion is given in  5 .",

    "( 1986 ) transfer function was used with an effective shape parameter of @xmath24 .",
    "the two competing desires of achieving high mass resolution while simulating a large sample of halos led us to use a box size of @xmath25 comoving mpc on a side , populated with @xmath26 dark matter particles .",
    "the mass of each particle was @xmath27 , which gives a nominal minimum mass resolution for our group finding of @xmath28 as we select only groups with 80 or more particles .",
    "the simulation was started at an initial redshift of @xmath29 , and a fixed physical plummer softening length of 5.7 kpc was chosen .",
    "the simulations used a parallel openmp - based version of the hydra code ( couchman et al .",
    "1995 , thacker & couchman 2000 ) , with 64-bit precision being used throughout .",
    "group finding is a widely studied topic in cosmology since it can lead to ( small ) systematic differences ( eg jenkins et al .",
    "2001 ) . to demonstrate the robustness of our results we have chosen two distinct group finding approaches ; the friends - of - friends approach ( davis et al .",
    "1985 , fof ) and the hop algorithm ( eisenstein & hut 1998 ) .",
    "although it remains popular , the fof masses estimates are known to have significant scatter due to a linking problem that can occur as small strings of particles fall within the linking length .",
    "the hop algorithm works by using the local density for each particle to trace ( ` hop ' ) along a path of increasing density to the nearest density maxima , at which point the particle is assigned to the group defined by that local density maximum . as this process assigns all particles to groups , a ` regrouping ' stage",
    "is needed in which a merger criterion for groups above a threshold density @xmath30 is applied .",
    "this criterion merges all groups for which the boundary density between them exceeds @xmath31 , and all groups thus identified must have one particle that exceeds @xmath32 to be accepted as a group ( see eisenstein & hut 1998 for explicit details ) .    beginning from @xmath33 , we saved particle positions every 50 million years up to the final output at @xmath34 .",
    "for the final 5 outputs we found fof groups using a linking parameter of @xmath35 , and hop groups using the parameters : @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 .",
    "visual inspection showed strong similarities between the two halo populations , with a small amount of unavoidable noise coming from groups around the 80 particle resolution limit ( a group found by fof at this limit may not be found by hop and vice versa ) .",
    "the group index of each particle was stored at each output to enable tracing between outputs .",
    "p03 investigated the clustering of mergers within simulations using the fof algorithm , finding no evidence for bias in a series of populations defined using different selection criteria . to test their conclusions we reconstructed their samples within our simulation . to give a rough  1.comparison of halo growth .",
    "the fof algorithm exhibits a significant amount of scatter in mass estimates between outputs .",
    "only 67% of groups grow from one output to another , compared to 82% for hop .",
    "+   estimation of the accuracy of the group finding methods in fig .  1 we plot the mass of the most massive progenitor at @xmath42 , versus the mass at @xmath43 , such that @xmath44 yr .",
    "clearly hop identifies groups that are more likely to be more massive at later outputs , while fof groups show considerable scatter about the mean .",
    "the effect of this difference is significant .",
    "using the p03 definition of ` new ' groups , namely , those for which 50% of constituent particles were not in a progenitor of equal or higher mass at the previous time , we find a large difference between the total number of groups identified : 9367 versus 12129 for fof and hop respectively ( from 16330 and 16831 total groups , respectively ) .",
    "however , neither of these populations has stronger clustering than the complete halo population as measured by their correlation functions in mass bins of 0.5 dex .",
    "notably the p03 halo subsets , corresponding to 3:1 and 17:3 mass ratio mergers , we significantly different between the fof and hop populations .",
    "this can partially be attributed synchronization problems , and as the time difference between outputs is increased the identified subsets become more similar .",
    "further scatter is also introduced by hard selection criteria , such as requiring progenitors fit a certain mass threshold . for the 3:1 and 17:3 merger ratios",
    "we find only 171(226 ) groups between @xmath45 and @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "the correlation functions of these halo populations , co - added over the final five outputs , show no clear bias , confirming the conclusions of p03 , however better statistics are necessary for a definitive result .",
    "our definition of accreting groups is similar to the p03 criteria , except that we select the subset of halos that grew by 20% from output to output , which implicitly includes mass accretion via smooth infall and results in 545(980 ) hop(fof ) groups if @xmath46 note that the mass of each halo is that at the end of each time interval , such that we tag all halos that _ experienced _ appreciable infall .",
    "the 20% value is arbitrary , but we selected it primarily because it appears to lie outside the central ` noise ' band in the fof data ( see fig  1 ) .",
    "the number of halos corresponding to this cut is also illustrated fig  1 , as points to the right of the dashed lines .",
    "in figure [ fig : xi ] we show the correlation function of the groups selected by both the hop and fof algorithms and compare them with @xmath47 of the accreting groups . in the accreting case we co - added the correlation functions calculated from the differences from the last four @xmath44 year intervals and the last two @xmath48 year intervals .",
    "radial bins of 1/80 the simulation size , corresponding to @xmath49 mpc , were taken throughout .    for comparison , in each panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : xi ] we also show the correlation function of all the groups in the next largest mass bin .",
    "the @xmath50 values ( where @xmath51 is the linear growth factor ) for each of these bins are 1.38 , 1.58 , and 1.83 which result in geometrical bias factors of @xmath52 of 1.53 , 1.89 , and 2.39 respectively .",
    "the amplitudes of the correlation functions obtained using all the hop groups are in good agreement with these bias values , and likewise , the correlation functions of the full set of hop and fof groups agree with each other to within statistical uncertainties .    the upper row of plots demonstrate a clear enhancement of the clustering of accreting groups at both the @xmath53 and @xmath54 mass scales , with their correlation functions roughly matching those of objects three times greater in mass ( no conclusion can be drawn from the high mass bin as the sample is too small ) .",
    "this `` temporal biasing '' arises from the fact that _ both _ objects accreting substructure as well as those experiencing considerable smooth infall tend to be found in the densest regions of space , which are themselves highly clustered .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the fact that the average local overdensity of groups in the @xmath55 mass bin is 0.82(0.87 ) ( measured in 4 mpc ( comoving ) spheres , corresponding to a mass scale of @xmath56 @xmath57 ) , where as the same mass bin for the entire population exhibits an overdensity of 0.60(0.73 ) .    in the second row of fig .",
    "[ fig : xi ] we take a longer interval of @xmath58 yr .",
    "this has a slight dampening effect on temporal bias , as groups in less dense regions are able to sustain this level of infall .",
    "nevertheless a detectable enhancement is still seen , particularly in the @xmath59 bin , which contains the most common objects , with @xmath60 the smallest . in the @xmath61 yr case , however , only a very weak enhancement of @xmath47 was measured .    in the lower two rows of this figure ,",
    "we repeat our analyses using the fof group finder .",
    "although this approach is more susceptible to statistical noise , the same trends are apparent as in the hop case . if @xmath44 yr , this temporal bias is roughly equal to the geometrical bias of the groups three times more massive , while if @xmath58 yr , @xmath47 is boosted to a slightly lesser degree .",
    "besides the comparisons shown , we have also studied the effect of varying a number of parameters : @xmath32 , @xmath31 and @xmath30 in the hop method , the linking length of the fof groups , and the fractional value we used to define `` appreciable '' accretion .",
    "again , the same bias trends were visible , and our results remained robust over a wide range of reasonable choices for these quantities .    finally , to quantify our results , we have computed the effective temporal bias in each mass bin , @xmath62 , and group finder .",
    "we define @xmath63 as the ratio of the correlation function of the accreting groups to the overall correlation function , weighted by the number of points in each bin in the overall function ; @xmath64 , where the sum is carried out over all bins within @xmath65 comoving mpc .",
    "these values are labeled in each panel , and in the @xmath61 yr case , @xmath66 1.1(1.0 ) in the @xmath67 hop bins and 1.1(1.3 ) in the respective fof bins .",
    "from the tests presented above , it is clear that if small time intervals are chosen , the clustering of accreting groups is robustly enhanced with respect to the underlying populations . to relate this to lbgs we plot the spatial correlation function of @xmath68 lbgs , as derived by wechsler et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , in the center column of fig .",
    "[ fig : xi ] .",
    "although there are significant uncertainties involved in computing this quantity , since comparisons are more naturally conducted in angular coordinates , the shaded regions provide a guide to the range of @xmath47 values consistent with observations . in these panels",
    ", we see that if @xmath69 yr is chosen , then temporal bias boosts the correlation function of @xmath70 halos into reasonable agreement with observations .",
    "this mass is marginally consistent with the upper mass bound inferred from the rotation curves of a somewhat bright ( @xmath71 ) spectroscopic subset of lbgs ( pettini et al .",
    "furthermore , only @xmath72 of all groups exhibit appreciable accretion in each @xmath44 year time interval and the density of @xmath70 halos is @xmath73 mpc@xmath74 , at @xmath5 in our assumed cosmology . thus associating such objects with @xmath75 year starbursts results in a density @xmath76 mpc@xmath74 , comparable with that observed . while this time interval is small , taking the mean gas and dark matter ratio , and an overall star formation efficiency of @xmath77 , results in a star formation rate of @xmath78 = @xmath79 yr@xmath1 .",
    "this is less than the observed values of @xmath80 yr@xmath1 , perhaps implying that an even shorter time interval is appropriate .",
    "while quite suggestive , these comparisons are not meant as a complete model , and may not prove to be the final explanation of the discrepant mass estimates of lbgs .",
    "kinematic models have been explored , for example , in which the observed velocity dispersions of lbgs are much less than the circular velocities of the halos in which they are contained ( eg .  mo , mao , & white 1999 ) .",
    "what is clear however , is that this bias can not be ignored and must be carefully considered when interpreting the clustering of these objects . while perhaps only part of the story , temporal biasing represents an important factor that must be taken into account when studying the properties of lyman break galaxies .",
