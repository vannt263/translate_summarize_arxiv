    "\\(101955 ) bennu is an apollo - type near - earth asteroid ( nea ) given its orbital characteristics .",
    "bennu is a potential earth impactor with a relatively high impact probability of approximately @xmath7 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* milani et al . , 2009 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chesley et al . , 2014 ) ) .",
    "recently , @xcite showed that the semimajor axis of bennu drifts at an averaged rate @xmath8 due to the yarkovsky effect , and further predicted dozens of potential impacts for this asteroid from 2175 to 2196 . since its orbit makes it especially accessible for the spacecraft , bennu is considered as one of the potentially hazardous asteroids ( pha ) and was chosen as a suitable target for nasa s osiris - rex sample return mission ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lauretta et al . , 2012 ) ) .",
    "the osiris - rex spacecraft is scheduled to be launched in 2016 .",
    "several researchers investigated the thermophysical features of bennu .",
    "@xcite derived bennu s thermal inertia of @xmath9 @xmath10 with thermophysical model , based on observations from herschel / pacs , eso - visir , spitzer - irs and spitzer - pui .",
    "recently , @xcite showed an update thermal inertia of bennu approximately @xmath11 from a thermophysical analysis of spitzer - irs spectra and a multi - band thermal lightcurve .",
    "there are two main different aspects between the work of ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* emery et al . , 2014 ) ) and ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* m@xmath0ller et al , 2012 ) ) : first , the former considered a 3d radar - derived shape model by ( ( * ? ? ? * nolan et al . , 2013 ) ) in the modeling process , whereas the latter adopted a simple spherical shape model ; second , the mid - infrared observations they used were not idenfical , in that irac and irs peak - up data were included in @xcite , but not utilized in ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* m@xmath0ller et al , 2012 ) ) .    in this paper , we adopt independently developed thermophysical simulation codes from ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* yu , ji & wang 2014 ) ) based on the advanced thermal physical model ( atpm ) ( ( * ? ?",
    "* rozitis & green 2011 ) ) , to investigate the surface thermophysical characteristics of bennu . in our modelling process",
    ", we utilize bennu s radar - derived shape model given by ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* nolan et al . , 2013 ) ) rather than a spherical approximation shape ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* m@xmath0ller et al , 2012 ) ) .",
    "moreover , we added the mid - infrared data gathered from four groups of observations , at various phase angles , by spitzer - pui , spitzer - irac , herschel / pacs and eso vlt / visir ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* m@xmath0ller et al , 2012 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* emery et al . , 2014 ) ) . by fitting all observations",
    ", we obtain a thermal inertia of bennu that is slightly lower than that of ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* emery et al . , 2014 ) ) , which indicates an important evidence of the fine - grained regolith on bennu s surface ( for details see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* yu & ji 2015 ) ) . moreover , using the derived thermal inertia , we estimate the grain size of the regolith from a thermal conductivity model of ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gundlach & blum 2013 ) ) .",
    "figure [ chi2contour ] shows a contour of @xmath12 in the 2-dimensional parameter space ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) , where the increase of @xmath12 is shown by color bar from blue to red .",
    "the black + corresponds to the minimum @xmath15 . and",
    "in this case , we have @xmath16 and @xmath17 , as best fit solutions to the observations .",
    "the blue curve is the profile of @xmath18 , which is assumed as the 1@xmath19 limit of the free fit parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the blue profile forms a closed region in the ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) space .",
    "thus , we can simultaneously constrain thermal inertia and roughness fraction in 2-dimensional space , considering the 1@xmath19 limit . however , the contour curves of @xmath12 above 1@xmath19 can not froms closed regions , suggesting that the degeneracy of thermal inertia and roughness fraction can not be removed so well like the 1@xmath19 level , thus thermal inertia and roughness fraction may be simply separated at the 1@xmath19 level based on the atpm calculations . therefore ,",
    "if the 1@xmath19 limit is reliable , we may safely conclude that the roughness fraction is possible in the range of 0@xmath90.3 , and the thermal inertia may be in the range of @xmath20 .",
    "our results agree with both earlier investigations of ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* m@xmath0ller et al , 2012 ) ) and ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "the color ( from blue to red ) relates to the increase of profile of @xmath12 .",

    "* emery et al . , 2014 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* bevington & robingson 2003 ) ) . ]    with the above derived thermal inertia , the grain size of bennu can be estimated according to the method of ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gundlach & blum 2013 ) ) .",
    "a mean surface temperature @xmath22  k is assumed in our computation .",
    "the other parameters are taken from ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gundlach & blum 2013 ) ) . based on the thermal inertia @xmath16 ,",
    "the grain radius is likely to be in the range @xmath23  mm .",
    "in addition , the grain radius may be estimated as ranging from @xmath5 to @xmath24  mm considering 1@xmath19 range of thermal inertia . on the basis of this estimation of grain radius",
    ", we infer that boulders or rocks may be few on the surface of bennu , suggesting that the touch - and - go sample acquisition mechanism ( tagsam ) designed by the osiris - rex team should find an accessible environment to operate successfully .",
