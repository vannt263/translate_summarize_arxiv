    "since @xmath3 is weakly mixing , @xmath207 is ergodic , therefore @xmath351 .",
    "this proves that @xmath352 _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath3 is mixing .",
    "we finish this presentation by a long - standing open question in ergodic theory , and some of its relationships with joining theory .",
    "recall that the property of ( strong ) mixing is also called _",
    "2-fold mixing _ , because it involves only two subsets of the space .",
    "a strengthening of this definition involving 3 ( or @xmath353 ) sets gives rise to the property of _ 3-fold mixing _",
    "( respectively _ @xmath83-fold mixing _ ) :    the dynamical system @xmath3 is said to be _ 3-fold mixing _",
    "if @xmath354 , @xmath355    again , this definition can easily be translated into the language of joinings : @xmath3 is 3-fold mixing when the sequence @xmath356 converges in @xmath357 to @xmath358 as @xmath161 and @xmath359 go to infinity , where @xmath360 is the obvious generalization of @xmath206 to the case of self - joinings of order 3 .",
    "whether 2-fold mixing implies 3-fold mixing was asked long ago by rohlin @xcite , and the question is still open today .",
    "however , some important results have been established around this problem .",
    "some of them could make us think that this implication is false , by exhibiting counterexamples to the same question but in a generalized context . in this category",
    ", we must in particular cite ledrappier s example in @xcite of a @xmath361-action which is 2-fold but not 3-fold mixing .",
    "more recently , it was noticed in @xcite that if we consider the property of being mixing relatively to a factor @xmath15-algebra ( roughly speaking , this means that we replace the measure by the conditional expectation with respect to this @xmath15-algebra ) , then we can find examples of 2-fold but not 3-fold mixing . on the other hand ,",
    "there are also many results which go in the opposite direction . we know that 2-fold mixing implies 3-fold mixing in many cases : for example when @xmath3 has singular spectrum ( host , @xcite ) , when @xmath3 is rank one ( kalikow , @xcite ) or even for finite rank systems ( ryzhikov , @xcite ) , when @xmath3 is generated by a gaussian system ( leonov , @xcite ; see also totoki  @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , in many of these works it is shown that a stronger result holds for the respective class of systems under consideration , and this result concerns joining theory : for finite rank systems , as well as for singular spectrum systems , it is proved that any ergodic self - joining @xmath62 of order  3 which has pairwise independent marginals is necessarily the product measure . as far as gaussian systems are concerned",
    ", this property has been established for an important subclass of the zero - entropy gaussian processes , called gag  @xcite .",
    "it is not known whether it can be extended to all zero - entropy gaussian processes .",
    "more generally , we may ask the following important question :    [ pairwise - independent - question ] does there exist a zero - entropy dynamical system @xmath3 and an ergodic joining @xmath362 for which the coordinates are pairwise independent but which is different from @xmath358 ?    why a negative answer to this question would solve rohlin s multiple mixing problem is explained by the following remarks : first , if we had a 2-fold mixing but not 3-fold mixing dynamical system @xmath3 , the sequence @xmath356 would have a cluster point @xmath363 .",
    "since @xmath3 is 2-fold mixing , the coordinates would be pairwise independent for @xmath62 .",
    "and we could find an ergodic joining satisfying those two properties by taking an ergodic component of @xmath62 .",
    "second , thouvenot proved that if we could find a counterexample to rohlin s question , then we could find one in the zero - entropy category .",
    "this restriction to zero entropy is crucial since we can easily construct examples answering question  [ pairwise - independent - question ] if we drop it : start from the @xmath364 bernoulli shift @xmath3 generated by the i.i.d .",
    "process @xmath365 , taking its values in @xmath316 .",
    "take an independent copy @xmath366 of this process and set @xmath367 then the three processes @xmath13 , @xmath274 and @xmath273 have the same distribution , are pairwise independent , but the self - joining of @xmath3 of order 3 that we get in this way is not the product measure .",
    "observe also that a negative answer to question  [ pairwise - independent - question ] would imply another important result in joining theory : it would show that 2-fold msj implies @xmath83-fold msj for all @xmath215 .",
    "indeed , any 2-fold msj but not 3-fold msj would have an ergodic joining @xmath62 of order 3 for which the coordinates would be pairwise independent , but not independent .",
    "the purpose of the following is to show that , if ever we could find some system satisfying the requirements of question  [ pairwise - independent - question ] , it must be of a different nature than the construction of ledrappier for an action of @xmath361 , or than the relative example given in @xcite .",
    "indeed , each of these two constructions leads to some `` joining '' @xmath62 , for which we get 3 pairwise independent coordinates @xmath368 , @xmath369 and @xmath370 , and for which the global independence is denied by the following property : we have some random variable @xmath13 defined on @xmath4 , taking its value in @xmath316 ( each value being taken with probability @xmath319 ) , and satisfying @xmath371    there are two ways of interpreting equation  : first , the random variable @xmath13 takes its values in a finite alphabet @xmath5 , and there exists a function @xmath372 such that @xmath373 second , the random variable @xmath13 takes its values in a compact abelian group @xmath162 , and we have @xmath374    we want to show now that there can not exist an example answering question  [ pairwise - independent - question ] of either of those types , by proving the following two propositions .",
    "[ first - proposition]suppose that there exist some joining @xmath362 , with pairwise independent coordinates , and some random variable @xmath375 ( finite alphabet ) such that @xmath376 then    * either the factor of @xmath3 generated by @xmath13 is periodic , * or this factor has an entropy at least @xmath377 .",
    "[ second - proposition ] the dynamical system @xmath3 is assumed to be ergodic .",
    "suppose that for some joining @xmath362 with pairwise independent marginals , there exists some measurable map @xmath378 ( compact abelian group ) which is not @xmath2-a.e .",
    "constant , and such that @xmath379 then @xmath3 has positive entropy .",
    "[ first - lemma ] let @xmath380 , @xmath381 and @xmath382 be 3 random variables taking their values in the finite alphabet @xmath5 , identically distributed , pairwise independent , and such that there exists a function @xmath372 satisfying @xmath383 then their common probability law is the uniform law on the set of values which are taken with positive probability .",
    "taking a subset of @xmath5 instead of @xmath5 if necessary , we can assume that for all @xmath384 , @xmath385 for all @xmath296 and @xmath83 in @xmath5 , there exists a unique @xmath386 such that @xmath387 .",
    "moreover , we have @xmath388 in other words , @xmath389 where @xmath390 and @xmath391 is the bistochastic matrix whose entries are @xmath392 . taking the limit as @xmath393 in the equality @xmath394",
    ", we get that @xmath143 has to be the uniform law on @xmath5 .    from the preceding lemma , we know that @xmath13 is uniformly distributed on the subset of values which are taken with positive probability .",
    "but for any @xmath395 , lemma  [ first - lemma ] also applies to @xmath396 let @xmath397 in @xmath5 be such that @xmath398 then , the conditional probability law of @xmath399 knowing the above event is uniform on the set of values to which it assigns a positive mass .",
    "moreover , we easily check that the cardinal @xmath400 of the support of this conditional probability law does not depend on the choice of @xmath397 , and satisfies @xmath401 .",
    "thus ,    * either the sequence @xmath402 reaches 1 , and in this case the factor generated by @xmath13 is periodic ; * or @xmath400 is always greater than or equal to 2 , and then the entropy of the factor generated by @xmath13 is at least @xmath377 .",
    "[ second - lemma ] let @xmath380 , @xmath381 and @xmath382 be 3 random variables taking their values in the compact abelian group @xmath162 , identically distributed , pairwise independent , and satisfying @xmath403 then their common probability law is the haar measure on some compact subgroup of @xmath162 .",
    "denote by @xmath36 the probability law of @xmath380 on @xmath162 . for @xmath36-almost",
    "every @xmath404 , @xmath36 is invariant under the addition of @xmath129 , since knowing @xmath405 , both @xmath380 and @xmath406 are distributed according to @xmath36 .",
    "let us define @xmath407 this is a closed subgroup of @xmath162 containing the support of @xmath36 .",
    "thus @xmath36 is a probability law on @xmath408 , invariant under every translation on @xmath408 : @xmath36 is the haar measure on @xmath408 .    let us consider @xmath409 defined by @xmath410 from lemma  [ second - lemma ] , the probability law of @xmath411 is the haar measure on some compact subgroup @xmath408 of @xmath412 .",
    "moreover , @xmath408 is invariant by the shift , denoted by @xmath15 , on @xmath412 .",
    "the restriction of @xmath15 to @xmath408 is therefore an ergodic endomorphism of @xmath408 , which is a factor of @xmath3 ( this is the factor generated by @xmath13 ) .",
    "a theorem by juzvinskii @xcite tells us that any such ergodic group endomorphism has to be a @xmath289-system ; hence @xmath3 has positive entropy .",
    "observe that the two situations exposed in propositions  [ first - proposition ] and  [ second - proposition ] can be seen as particular cases of a third one , from which i do not know whether some similar conclusion can in general be derived .",
