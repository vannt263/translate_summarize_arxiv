    "each water molecule has two hydrogen arms and two lone pair arms .",
    "interaction between water molecules is via these oppositely polarized bond arms and when a hydrogen arm of one molecule bonds with lone pair of a neighboring molecule , it results in  hydrogen bond \" .",
    "so , for any number of water molecules ( @xmath0 ) the number of hydrogen bonds ( hb ) and number of dangling bonds ( db ) i.e. , lone - pair and hydrogen arms which are not hydrogen - bonded , satisfy a  sum rule \" .",
    "it states that the arms of water molecule are either hydrogen - bonded or not i.e. , @xmath1    now , if we consider a bulk of water molecules the above equation still holds when db , hb and @xmath0 are appropriately defined per unit volume . in other words ,",
    "the local topology of molecular interactions implies a sum rule which is also true in the bulk for any thermodynamic conditions such as temperature , pressure , volume .",
    "furthermore , this is also independent of other interactions in the dynamical system such as van der waals ( vdw ) , coulombic etc .",
    "these facts are not surprising since eq.([sumrule ] ) is a topological constraint which is insensitive to many details of the dynamics .    in most descriptions of solid phase ( ice or glasses ) , by design",
    ", the above sum rule is maintained explicitly . in the gas phase where the density of hydrogen bonds is negligible",
    "the sum rule is again trivially satisfied .",
    "if there are significant hb then the system can be analyzed by introducing appropriate density of dimers which still satisfy the sum rule thermodynamically .",
    "liquid phase is typically studied using molecular dynamics ( md ) and monte carlo ( mc ) simulations of popular models @xcite where in again the sum rule is maintained at every step of the dynamics and many bulk and other correlation properties @xcite are well reproduced and are consistent with experiments @xcite .",
    "liquid phase is also described phenomenologically by a mean field which invariably is taken to be density field and fluctuations there of are then postulated to obey ornstein - zernike ( oz ) equation @xcite .",
    "furthermore , all molecular interactions have the property that they can not approach each other closer than certain minimum distance , usually incorporated as hard sphere repulsion in the interaction potential between the molecules .",
    "this in the liquid phase gives us the well known vdw term in the equation of state , often referred to as density saturation effect @xcite .",
    "phenomenologically , such saturation effects can be incorporated in the oz equation and thereby understand important components of density fluctuations namely coordination shell peaks using approximations like percus - yevick , hypernetted - chain etc @xcite .",
    "but these descriptions are not as successful as md simulations , primarily because by design in the construction of phenemonological models one does not envisage fluctuations in hb or db densities .",
    "consequently , they can not satisfy the sum rule in large subvolumes where surface effects are negligible .",
    "the sum rule argument suggests that to describe water we need atleast two fluctuating fields to be self - consistent .",
    "some important developments in the past on systems with hydrogen - bond like interactions are discussed below .",
    "wertheim s work on statistical thermodynamics of fluids with directional interactions consists of systematic graph - theoretic expansions of n - mer tree - like configurations and provides oz - like operator equation in terms of total density and singlet - density fields of the system @xcite .",
    "another significant work on associating fluids was by andersen who provided a mayer - like density expansion technique to deal with directional interactions @xcite .",
    "both the descriptions work very well at high temperatures and also at densities corresponding to liquid - vapor coexistence .",
    "an extension to wertheim s theory was proposed as saft @xcite wherein the equation of state is phenomenologically extended to include contributions from complex geometries of constituent molecules which interact through directional forces . another phenomenological description aimed at describing mainly the low temperature anamolies in fluids with characterstic orientation - dependent interactions was given by truskett et al @xcite . here in again , the equation of state is approximated with vdw like terms which are then phenomenologically supplemented with hydrogen - bonding contribution that captures certain high - density features .    in this paper",
    "we propose to study a simple model hamiltonian which incorporates the molecular hydrogen - bonding interactions .",
    "to accomodate the hard sphere repulsion we envisage the system on a hypercubic lattice and the model is essentially a slight generalization of the pauling s model of water @xcite .",

    "we study the equation of state and various mean field fluctuations in terms of correlation functions .",
    "we also considered long range coulomb interaction and studied its consequences .",

    "for example , to carry out simulations at a fixed temperature and a range of chemical potentials an initial run carried out at low densities and equilibriated over long time is used as a ` seed ' i.e. , input configuration for the successive run .",
    "this is repeated to reach higher densities .",
    "this procedure accelerates equilibration considerably compared to any random seed configuration .",
    "furthermore , since a range of chemical potentials are explored the step size in the parameter value is appropriately adjusted such that a quench - like situation is avoided .",
    "thereby , the system evolves smoothly in configuration space without any unwanted domains persisting .",
    "the end averages remain unchanged when the seeding procedure is carried out in an alternative parameter space , for example , instead of chemical potential temperature can be varied in small steps .",
    "this confirms the absence of any possible bias created by our successive seeding procedure in most part of the parameter space ( except near first order phase transitions where hysteresis exists ) .    in order to obtain equation of state using mc",
    "we employed fixed temperature simulations , followed by application of gibbs - duhem procedure to obtain pressure versus density curves @xcite . in the @xmath151 ensemble temperature",
    "is fixed and a range of chemical potentials are explored starting from zero density where pressure can be normalized to the value zero . employing the successive seeding procedure",
    "we obtain various thermodynamic averages as functions of chemical potential .",
    "the gibbs - duhem procedure involves integrating the @xmath0 @xmath29 curve so that pressure can be obtained from the following relation : @xmath159 where the @xmath160 corresponds to @xmath161 and @xmath162 and @xmath163 to that of the desired @xmath0 .",
    "a set of representative @xmath0 vs. @xmath29 curves are shown in fig.([fig_rhomu ] ) .",
    "each such curve has two prominent shoulders where considerable slope change occurs . at very high @xmath29 values",
    "no more equilibriated configurations could be traced and the density starts shooting up to the saturation value .",
    "we also made preliminary investigation in studying phase transitions in the model .",
    "as shown in fig.([fig_rhomu ] ) the model exhibits discontinuity in @xmath164 for temperatures @xmath165 ( in units of hydrogen - bond energy ) .",
    "for instance , at @xmath166 the system jumps from a low dense ( @xmath167 ) to higher density ( @xmath168 ) where @xmath169 is average number of hydrogen - bonds per molecule .",
    "hysteresis is also observed when the system progresses first from low - dense to high - dense state upon increasing @xmath29 and then retracing the path by decreasing @xmath29 .",
    "this indicates the presence of first - order phase transition in the region .",
    "we interpret this as liquid - gas transition in the model .",
    "one of the important expositions of the mmf theory is the  equation of network \" , a functional relationship between total water density and hb density . from eq.([equationofnetwork ] ) , at @xmath90 , the mean field equation of network is given by , @xmath170 in mc simulation we identify the liquid - gas transition for temperatures @xmath165 .",
    "as shown in fig.([fig_rhomu ] ) , for @xmath171 at @xmath172 water density jumps from @xmath173 to @xmath174 .",
    "the jump gap increases with @xmath30 , so does the higher density state to which system jumps . within our limited exploration of the phase diagram",
    "we identify that water densities @xmath175 correspond to liquid phase , only above which mmf theory is self - consistent ( eq.[networkequation ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the linear relationship between @xmath0 and hb is accurate at high pressures as confirmed by mc simulation . as noted earlier , mmf approximation complies with the sum rule of the system ; the same is exactly satisfied by mc simulation at every configurational move and hence over ensemble average .",
    "thus , the agreement between mean field ( zeroth order and one loop correction ) and mc over the equation of network is inescapable . however",
    ", since the mean field description holds forte in thermodynamic limit , the hb density in the above equation corresponds to lowest free energy ( or high pressure ) states for each water density .",
    "next , we compare the mmf computation of equation of state with that of mc simulation . from theory , at @xmath90 , @xmath176 the comparison is put forth in fig.([fig_equationofstate ] ) .",
    "it shows that the locus of high pressure states at each density in mc simulation has the same profile as in mmf theory ( both in zeroth order and one - loop ) .",
    "further , the qualitative agreement is good only in the high density regime where the equation of network too is accurate .",
    "a quantitative comparison of equation of state between mmf and mc is unreliable because mmf pressure absurdly vanishes at @xmath177 whereas , physically , the pressure is zero in this model only at @xmath161 .",
    "as discussed earlier , mmf approximation fails for small densities .",
    "therefore , a consistent normalization between various schemes of calculation is not present .",
    "thus , the qualitative picture obtained from mmf calculation is only indicative , nevertheless consistent with mc results .",
    "the spatial correlation functions are also computed from the mc simulation and compared with that of analytical expressions obtained within the mean field approximation .",
    "firstly , we note that the underlying hyper - cubic lattice dominates all correlations especially at short distances",
    ". then , to extract the rotational invariant part of any function @xmath178 we implement the following projection procedure :    [ projectionequation ] @xmath179    where @xmath180 and @xmath181 is heaviside step function defined as @xmath182 for @xmath183 and @xmath28 for @xmath184 .",
    "the important correlations in the model are @xmath185 and @xmath186 .",
    "the @xmath114-space integrals in eqs.([wwcorrelation ] , [ qqcorrelation ] ) are computed numerically and the mmf correlation functions are compared with those of mc simulation .",
    "the positions of coordination peaks in both are in agreement .",
    "in addition , charge correlations show similar exponential fall - offs asymptotically .",
    "fluctuations are seen to increase as we approach saturation density in both cases , however they are higher in simulation .",
    "mmf theory predicts correlation length of charge fluctuations i.e. , in @xmath187 correlation function eqs.([phicorrelation],[qqcorrelation ] ) .",
    "these fluctuations could give rise to long distance correlations in other charged fields in the system such as in dipole , as seen in md simulations ( wherein two correlation lengths of order @xmath188  and @xmath189  have been observed , former being @xmath190 times larger than the latter in strength ) @xcite . to relate to mmf",
    "we make the following observations . water molecule on average participates in @xmath191 hydrogen - bonds in ambient conditions",
    "@xcite i.e. , @xmath192 . using this value in @xmath193 of eq.([phicorrelation ] )",
    "the correlation length turns out to be approximately @xmath194 lattice constant in mmf .",
    "we next estimate the lattice constant in physical units by comparing the position of highest coordination peak in @xmath195 correlation obtained from mmf to that of experimental data .",
    "this procedure gives a lattice constant equal to @xmath196  .",
    "hence in physical units mmf predicts a correlation length of about @xmath197  for liquid water . it should be noted that these predictions are not robust as the coefficients such as @xmath198 in eq.([phicorrelation ] ) might vary with topology of the underlying lattice .",
    "we also pursued a preliminary comparison of the equation of network from experiments and md simulations .",
    "the density of hydrogen bonds is indirectly probed and inferred in various experiments @xcite and also computed in md and mc simulations under varying external conditions @xcite .",
    "the latter works used different definitions for hydrogen - bond computation such as energy - based , geometry - based or hybrid .",
    "the data is put in the perspective by converting the mass densities to number densities using known radius of a water molecule . as shown in fig.([fig_equationofnetwork_expt ] ) , in the region of high molecular density i.e. , corresponding to liquid water we find that hb density and water density are linearly related to each other .",
    "a linear fit function is used for hb vs. @xmath0 curve and compared with that of the mmf equation eq.([equationofnetwork ] ) .",
    "we find that the dangling bond fugacity @xmath47 is in the range @xmath199 , implying that the corresponding energy @xmath200 is positive and large compared to thermal energy i.e. , dangling bonds are highly disfavored in liquid water .",
    "another useful quantity namely fraction of water molecules with @xmath201 hydrogen bonds can also be calculated .",
    "consider a water molecule in a configuration where its @xmath201-number of arms are hydrogen - bonded to neighboring molecules and its other @xmath202 arms remain dangling type .",
    "a weight can be associated with each such configuration defined in terms of appropriate site fields and summed over all possible orientations of the molecule .",
    "we denote this weight averaged with respect to the full partition function for each @xmath201 as @xmath203 .",
    "for instance , the averaged weight assigned to a molecule which is hydrogen - bonded to only two other molecules is given by : @xmath204 the prime over summation means dissimilar @xmath18 .",
    "the probability for a @xmath201-bonded molecule at any site @xmath3 is probability that any two directions around central site have zero arms , each denoted by @xmath205 , that @xmath201 other directions have a hydrogen - bond denoted by @xmath206 and that remaining @xmath207 sites are of dangling bond denoted by @xmath208 .",
    "the summation over the set @xmath209 implies summing over all possible rearrangements of hydrogen - bonds , dangling bonds among all the directions . with @xmath210 $ ] ways of choosing empty site , @xmath51 $ ] ways for two hydrogen bond sites the @xmath211 , to the leading order ,",
    "is given by : @xmath212   \\left [ 4 \\atop 2 \\right ]   \\text{(hb)}^{2 } \\text{(db)}^{2 }   = 15 ( 6 ) \\rho^{4 } { h}^{2 } ( 2 - h)^{2}\\ ] ] where @xmath169 is average number of hydrogen bonds per molecule .",
    "similarly , other @xmath203 s can be enumerated and computed upto leading order . for @xmath213 , @xmath214 \\rho^{4 }   { h}^{i } ( 2 - h)^{4-i}\\ ] ] thereupon , @xmath215 which is fraction of @xmath201-bonded molecules can be calculated from the relation , @xmath216   h^{i } ( 2-h)^{4-i }      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the above expression is obtained to zeroth order approximation within the model . there",
    "exist one - loop corrections to it that can be calculated from the mmf theory , but numerically they are small .",
    "these distributions agree very well with md simulations @xcite .",
    "further , probabilities for various cluster configurations ( n - mers ) can also be calculated within the mmf theory along the same lines as above .",
    "liquid water is known to form molecular clusters such as trimers , tetramers , pentamers @xcite .",
    "we analyzed the statistical mechanics of molecules with attractive bonding interactions .",
    "we argued that these systems typically have sum rules built - in which have to be respected in the analysis .",
    "in addition , there are other constraints , such as those shown in fig.([disallowedconfigs ] ) for water , all of which are captured by defining fields such as @xmath14 and @xmath15 as in eq.([bqdefinition ] ) .",
    "the analysis yields ultimately a functional integral in terms of auxiliary fields @xmath32 , @xmath33 which are conjugates of the discrete fields @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively . a simple - minded mean field analysis of the auxiliary fields is shown to reproduce all major thermodynamic properties of the system , which are verified to be reasonably accurate in liquid phase and near saturation density .",
    "principally , ",
    "equation of network \" which is another manifestation of the  sum rule \" plays an important role .",
    "we showed that all these consequences are known to be qualitatively true in experiments and md simulations as well .",
    "the mmf approximation is shown to be the leading order in a formal feynman loop expansion of the functional integral with necessarily small parameters called reduced fugacities .",
    "correlation functions and their properties have been computed and shown to qualitatively agree with mc simulation .",
    "it is however observed that many of the details in correlation functions do depend upon the underlying lattice , but the analytic structure is amenable to interpretation in the continuum as well .",
    "pressure and correlation lengths have large contribution from the fluctuations of db and @xmath0 in the form @xmath217 .",
    "we note that any long range interactions such as coulombic have very little quantitative effect on our results .",
    "the mmf theory is seen to be inconsistent at low densities , consequently fails to describe the gas phase of the model and the corresponding liquid - gas phase transition . in the explicit model considered here",
    "we do not have a crystalline solid phase , but we may have a glassy phase .",
    "namely , at zero temperature the lowest energy configuration is infinitely degenerate . in this region mmf theory",
    "does not show any liquid - glass first order phase transition , however it does indicate a second order transition as seen from @xmath15 correlator . in eq.([phicorrelation ] ) for @xmath82 : @xmath83 , @xmath218 implying @xmath219 . in mc simulation we did observe dynamical slowing down as we reach saturation density , perhaps indicative of a phase transition .",
    "the mmf technique can be applied to associating liquids which may constitute variety of molecules and hence with variety of sum rules .",
    "therefore , we expect a variety of dangling bond fluctuations contributing to pressure and correlation lengths .",
    "indeed , there may even be variety of phase transitions .",
    "essentially , the mmf technique is amenable to analysis of all such systems .",
