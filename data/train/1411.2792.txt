    "the evidence for a rho - like state in the @xmath0-wave amplitudes in @xmath17 dates back to 1960 s  @xcite and was confirmed later in cern measurements on polarized targets in @xmath17 at 17.2 gev / c  @xcite and in @xmath3 at 5.98 and 11.85  @xcite .",
    "additional evidence came from the itep data on @xmath2 on polarized target at 1.78 gev / c  @xcite .",
    "these findings were controversial because the measurements of @xmath8 at cern in 1972  @xcite and at bnl in 2001  @xcite found no evidence for the rho - like meson in the @xmath0-wave amplitudes .",
    "using three different methods we show in a recent work  @xcite that the rho - like resonance in the @xmath0-wave transversity amplitudes arises entirely from the contribution of the @xmath11 resonance .",
    "in addition , there is a dip at the @xmath18 mass in the @xmath1-wave aplitude @xmath19 .",
    "these results present evidence for a @xmath4 mixing in @xmath17 .",
    "since there is no @xmath1-wave in @xmath8 this explains why there is no rho - like resonance observed in this process .",

    "@xcite .    in this work",
    "we strengthen the evidence for the @xmath4 mixing in two ways .",
    "first , we show that the observed mixing is not generated by the admixture of small @xmath5-wave amplitudes in the input data .",
    "the spin mixing effect is consistent with the presence of the @xmath5-wave amplitudes at low as well as at high momentum transfers .",
    "second , we show that the @xmath4 mixing is consistent with the isospin relations between the observed amplitudes in @xmath2 and @xmath8 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section ii .",
    "we define the observables @xmath20 measured in @xmath2 on polarized target when the polarization of the recoil nucleon is not observed . in section iii .",

    "analyses the @xmath4 spin mixing effect is clearly consistent with the presence of the @xmath5-wave amplitudes provided they are not too large below 750 mev . in section v. we derive isospin relations between @xmath0-wave intensities in @xmath2 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 processes and present experimental evidence for the consistency of the @xmath4 mixing with these relations .    in section vi .",
    "we survey the results for the moduli of the @xmath0-wave transversity amplitudes and for @xmath0-wave intensities from all amplitude analyses of five measurements of @xmath27 on polarized targets and compare the latest results for relative phases .",
    "all analyses are in a remarkable agreement that shows a clear evidence for a resonant structure at @xmath11 mass in the @xmath0-wave moduli and intensities in a broad confirmation of @xmath4 spin mixing .    in section vi .",
    "we also comment on our recent joint @xmath12 phase - shift analysis of @xmath13 and @xmath14 production data  @xcite .",
    "our solutions ( 1,1 ) joint and ( 2,2 ) joint for the phase - shift @xmath15 are in excellent agreement with the solutions `` up - flat '' and `` down - flat '' from the cracow analysis  @xcite , respectively .",

    "in fact , a detailed histogram analysis in steps of @xmath332 showed that below @xmath333 all degree bins for the solution 2 of the phases @xmath334 and @xmath335 are empty for all mass bins except for just several events in a few mass bins below 800 mev .",
    "the results of the @xmath135 fits are in tension also with our new analysis  @xcite using the spin mixing mechanism  @xcite which shows even a clearer non - zero structure of @xmath336 at all dipion masses .",

    "while the resonant structure at @xmath337 mass clearly peaks at 770 mev in the solution ( 2,2 ) it peaks at a lower value of the intensity at 790 mev in the solution `` down '' . despite this difference at 770 mev both solutions `` down '' and ( 2,2 ) communicate the convincing evidence for a @xmath11 structure in the solution 2 of the transversity amplitudes @xmath175 seen in figures 16 and 17 .",
    "while the solutions `` up''/(1,1 ) show a pronounced @xmath11 structure this structure is less pronounced in the solutions `` down''/(2,2 ) due to a broad structure near 930 mev originaing in the same structure in the solution 2 for the amplitude @xmath175 in figures 16 and 17 .",
    "this structure is absent in solution 2 for the amplitude @xmath175 in our new analysis  @xcite using spin mixing mechanism in which the observed amplitudes are a certain mixture of @xmath0-matrix amplitudes with different spins  @xcite .",

    "the sudden drop of @xmath213 and the sudden rise of @xmath319 at and above @xmath18 mass is due to a strong mixing at these masses of @xmath0-wave and @xmath1-wave @xmath0-matrix amplitudes .",

    "we have compared the two solutions for @xmath0-wave transversity amplitudes @xmath324 and @xmath175 from the cracow 1997 amplitude analysis @xmath135 @xmath338 with our amplitude analysis i. the two analyses are nearly identical but make different assumptions about the helicity amplitudes .",

    "@xcite we perform two different @xmath12 phase - shift analyses .",
    "the first analysis assumes elastic @xmath291 scattering below the @xmath189 threshold .",
    "there are two analytical solutions for the phase shift @xmath15 for each input helicity amplitudes labeled ( 1,1)1 , ( 1,1)2 and ( 2,2)1,(2,2)2 . the physical solution ( 2,2)1 is remarkably consistent with the 1997 cracow solution `` down - flat '' in klr @xmath338 .",
    "the second analysis is a joint @xmath291 phase shift analysis of the cern @xmath13  @xcite and e852 @xmath14  @xcite data .",
    "we obtain unique analytical solutions for the phase - shift @xmath15 and inelasticity @xmath351 for both input helicity amplitudes labeled ( 1,1 ) joint and ( 2,2 ) joint .",
    "our results for @xmath15 in solutions ( 1,1 ) joint and ( 2,2 ) joint are in excellent agreement with the 2002 cracow solutions `` up - flat '' and `` down - flat '' klr @xmath345 , respectively .",
    "both our joint solutions have inelasticities @xmath352 in contrast to many unphysical values in klr @xmath345 .",
    "the remarkable agreement of our elastic and joint solutions with the `` down - flat '' solutions klr @xmath338 and klr @xmath345 , respectivey indicates that the differences in the relative phase @xmath342 play a minor role in the determination of the phase - shift @xmath15 but can affect the determination of the inelasticity .",
    "our central observation is that all these solutions for phase - shift @xmath15 are fully consistent with the evidence for @xmath4 spin mixing in the measured transversity amplitudes from which all these phase - shifts ultimately arise .",
    "we have studied the response of the analytical solutions of the @xmath0- and @xmath1-wave subsystem in @xmath2 on polarized target to the presence of @xmath5-wave amplitudes .",
    "we have found that the @xmath4 mixing is consistent with the presence of @xmath5-wave amplitudes with helicities @xmath6 ( response analysis a ) as well as with helicities @xmath7 ( response analysis b ) provided the @xmath5-wave amplitudes are not too large below 750 mev , as expected from the cern measurements on unpolarized and polarized targets . above 750 mev",
    "the spin mixing effect is consistent with larger @xmath5-waves amplitudes .",
    "this result is in agreement with the amplitude analysis of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath5 wave subsystem at high momentum transfer @xmath44 below 960 mev . the observed @xmath4 mixing is thus a real effect not generated by the small @xmath5-wave contamination of the input data .",
    "we have also shown that the spin mixing @xmath0-wave amplitudes in @xmath2 are consistent with isospin relations between the @xmath0-wave amplitudes in @xmath13 , @xmath269 and @xmath259 channels and thus with the data on @xmath353 and @xmath354 .",
    "next we have presented a complete survey of evidence for @xmath4 mixing .",
    "we conclude that all amplitude analyses of all five measurements on polarized targets show a clear evidence for the @xmath4 mixing in the @xmath0-wave moduli and intensities . apart from the tension in the zero structure of relative phases @xmath355 near 700 - 800 mev in our analysis i  @xcite and the analysis  @xcite the relative phases in these analyses have similar magnitudes .",
    "the tension in the zero structure of @xmath355 may reflect the fact that while in our analysis the cosine conditions are imposed on solutions for the amplitudes for every monte carlo sampling of the data error volume they are not imposed on the amplitudes by the @xmath135 minimization program .",
    "this difference appears significant only near 700 - 800 mev .",
    "finally , we have commented on our elastic and joint @xmath12 phase - shits analyses of the @xmath13 and @xmath14 data  @xcite and their agreement with the cracow solutions  @xcite . all solutions for @xmath15",

    "the consistency of @xmath4 mixing with the presence of @xmath5-wave amplitudes , with the amplitude analysis of @xmath356 bnl data and the mutual consistency of all amplitude analyses on polarized target and all @xmath12 phase - shift analyses are results that significantly strengthen the experimental evidence for @xmath4 spin mixing  @xcite .",
    "this evidence is further supported by our new amplitude analysis  @xcite using spin mixing mechanism developed in ref .",
