    "the solar neutrino puzzle , which has lasted nearly 40 years , has finally been resolved by kamland @xcite after invaluable contributions by numerous solar neutrino experiments , especially recently by sno@xcite and super - kamiokande@xcite . the large - mixing - angle ( lma ) region of the mikheev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) @xcite triangle @xcite",
    "has now been uniquely selected .",
    "this resolution to the solar neutrino puzzle has opened the door to the experimental exploration of cp violation in the lepton sector .",
    "together with the existing evidence for neutrino oscillation that has been obtained by the pioneering atmospheric neutrino observations @xcite and the long - baseline accelerator experiments @xcite , it lends further support to the standard three - flavor mixing scheme of neutrinos .    the remaining task toward the goal of uncovering the complete structure of the lepton flavor mixing",
    "would be a determination of the ( 1 - 3 ) sector of lepton mixing matrix which is now called as the maki - nakagawa - sakata matrix ( mns)@xcite . a full determination of the ( 1 - 3 ) sector includes a determination of @xmath1 , the cp or t violating phase @xmath2 and the sign of @xmath3 .",
    "( we define @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the mass of the @xmath6-th eigenstate . )",
    "the sign of @xmath3 signals which pattern of neutrino masses nature has chosen , the normal hierarchy , @xmath7 , or the inverted hierarchy , @xmath8 .",
    "this hierarchy must certainly carry interesting information on the , yet undiscovered , underlying principle of how nature organizes the neutrino sector .",
    "while the hierarchy question is of great interest , at this moment , there is no experimental information available .",
    "one possible exception is a hint from the neutrino data from supernova sn1987a @xcite , however the basis of this hint is under discussion@xcite .    to design the experiments to measure cp or t violating phase @xmath2",
    "we must know in advance @xmath1 , or at least its order of magnitude .",
    "there have been many proposals for experiments which may be able to measure @xmath1 .",
    "they can be classified into two categories , long - baseline ( lbl ) accelerator experiments @xcite , and reactor experiments @xcite .",
    "while @xmath1 may be eventually measured by some of these experiments it was recognized that this measurement suffers from a problem of parameter degeneracy @xcite .",
    "it stems from the fact that the determination of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and the sign of @xmath3 are inherently coupled with each other .",
    "a complete solution to the parameter degeneracy would require extensive measurement at two different energies and/or two different baselines @xcite , or to combine two different experiments @xcite . we , however , seek an alternative strategy in this paper .",
    "that is , we propose to solve it one by one .",
    "we pursue the possibility that determination of the sign of @xmath3 may be carried out with only a limited set of measurement .",
    "it is similar in spirit to the one employed in @xcite in which we proposed a way to circumvent at least partly the problem of ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) degeneracy .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the line of thought of comparing measurement at two different energies and/or combining two different experiments to determine the sign of @xmath3 and @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , it is of concern to us how to combine the jhf @xcite and numi off - axis @xcite experiments .",
    "apart from possibility of earlier detection in minos , opera or reactor experiments , the effect of nonzero @xmath1 is likely to be determined by observing electron appearance events in these lbl experiments .",
    "hence , it is of great importance to uncover ways by which these two experiments can compliment one another .",
    "we discuss in this paper which combination of modes of operation ( @xmath9 or @xmath10 channels ) and which neutrino energies divided by baseline ( @xmath0 ) have better sensitivity for determining the sign of @xmath3 and/or measuring @xmath1 .",
    "while our treatment applies to wider context beyond application to the particular experiments , finding a way of optimizing the jhf - numi interplay is , we believe , a very relevant and urgent question for both of these projects .",
    "it is likely that the jhf experiment in its phase i operates in neutrino mode @xcite . given the state of the other projects , numi is the one which is most likely to become a reality . therefore , it is important to find the most profitable mode of operation of the numi off - axis project .",
    "we start by giving a general formalism of comparing two different measurement .",
    "it is to illuminate the analytic structure of the problem of two experiments comparison , and it would be of help in understanding the physical characteristics behind the observations we will provide . instead of engaging an intensive @xmath11 analysis we prefer to illuminate the global chart of the two experiment comparison . to carry this out we rely heavily on a generalized version of the cp / t bi - probability plot that was introduced and developed in refs .",
    "@xcite . our discussion in this paper , while not the complete story , it is sufficient to enable us to understand the key physics points .",
    "the experimental issues that need to be addressed to complete the picture are beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the reader who wants to focus on the physics conclusions , in particular on our key observations in jhf - numi comparison , can go directly to sec .",
    "iii , skipping sec .",
    "then , they might want to come back to read the sec .",
    "ii for a deeper understanding .",
    "let us combine two measurements , either @xmath9 or @xmath10 , for two different energies and/or baselines .",
    "for example , one measurement could come from jhf and another measurement from numi , with both @xmath9 ( or @xmath10 ) or one @xmath9 and the other @xmath10 .",
    "all combinations can be treated in the universal formalism presented here .",
    "we can start with two basic equations as in @xcite for small @xmath12 : @xmath13 where @xmath14 , and the superscripts @xmath15 and @xmath16 label the process and the experimental setup .",
    "the value of the parameters @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 depend on the process ( specified by @xmath20 ) , the energy and path length of the experiment as well as sign of @xmath3 and the density of matter traversed by the neutrino beam . in table",

    "some crucial properties of the functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 which allow this unified notation are summarized in appendix a.    the basic equations ( [ basicequations ] ) can be solved for either sign of @xmath3 as : @xmath33 where we have ignored terms of order @xmath34 . the right equality can be used to solve for both @xmath35 and @xmath36 from which @xmath37 is then determined .",
    "this is a straightforwardly generalization of the method used in @xcite to obtain , analytically , the degenerate set of solutions and to elucidate the relationships between them . here",
    ", we will present the result of such a general analysis in the appendix a. an important point , however , is that once the solutions for @xmath2 are known , @xmath37 is easily obtained using left hand equality in eq .",
    "( [ basicsolution ] ) .",
    "experimentally the most likely channels to be realized in the near future are @xmath38 and @xmath39 , therefore in the next two subsections we will specialize to these channels with both beams being neutrinos ( or anti - neutrinos ) and one beam of neutrinos and one beam of anti - neutrinos . in the following section we will consider the specific experimental situations presented by the jhf@xcite and numi@xcite proposals .",
    "we apply the general formalism developed in the previous section to an explicit example of a @xmath9-@xmath9 comparison of two experiments with different energies and baseline distances . at the end of this subsection",
    "we will give the relationship to the @xmath10-@xmath10 comparison .",
    "we will label the two experiments j and n in reference to jhf and numi .",
    "however , in spite of the reference to specific two projects , our general discussions are valid for any pair of the lbl experiments on the globe and can also be used to discuss other processes but here we will concentrate on @xmath38 .    we start by introducing some convenient notation .",

    "we define @xmath41 the signs and the subscript assignment come from table 1 .    by solving ( [ basicsolution ] ) with these definitions , it is easy to derive ( see appendix a ) , for positive @xmath3 , the allowed values of @xmath42 which we assign subscripts 1 and 2 ; @xmath43 ,   \\nonumber \\\\",

    "however , one can ask the question , can we obtain some useful relationships between cp phases of the mixed - sign degeneracy in an approximation of small difference in the matter effect between jhf and numi ?",
    "the answer is yes and we will derive such relations in appendix b where we formulate such perturbative treatment .    the solutions for @xmath37 can easily be obtained by substituting appropriate values of @xmath35 and @xmath36 into eq.([basicsolution ] ) . for positive @xmath3 ,",
    "the values of @xmath49 are obtained by using the @xmath50 and @xmath51 in eq.([basicsolution ] ) and for negative @xmath3 , the values of @xmath52 are obtained by using @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",

    "we want to treat the @xmath9-@xmath10 comparison in an entirely analogous fashion as the @xmath9-@xmath9 comparison in the previous subsection . toward this goal",
    "we introduce a similar notation : @xmath61 where the subscript @xmath40 in ( [ jnmixed ] ) denote the sign of @xmath3 and here @xmath62 is for anti - neutrinos .",
    "the signs and the subscript assignment come from table 1 . these definitions are almost identical to the @xmath9-@xmath9 definitions but not quite , the @xmath40 labels on the left hand side are different and these difference lead to markedly different outcomes .",
    "it is easy to verify that by using the above notation @xmath63 as well as @xmath64 are given by exactly the same expressions as in the previous sections , e.g. , ( [ delta+nunu ] ) and ( [ delta - nunu ] ) , apart from replacement @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and so on .",

    ". it must be the case since the bi - probability trajectories shrink to straight lines.the straight - line cp trajectory can be achieved even when energy distribution of neutrino flux times cross section is taken into account @xcite .",
    "in this section we will discuss explicitly the jhf and numi possibilities .",
    "jhf will have a baseline of 295 km , and the neutrino energy at which oscillation maximum occurs is @xmath78 for our figures we will use this energy plus 0.8 gev which is 33% higher and near the peak in the event rate for @xmath79 appearance due to the rising cross section but falling oscillation probability assuming the same flux can be maintained .",

    "the allowed regions are very broad and there is significant overlap between the allowed regions for the two signs of @xmath3 .",
    "however , the size of @xmath1 can be determined with reasonable accuracy in such a comparison .",

    "in particular , we are interested in how the slopes of the two `` pencils '' change in fig .  1 . to this goal",
    "we compute the slope ratio of the central axis of positive @xmath3 to the negative @xmath3 .",
    "since the central axis of the `` pencil '' is obtained by equating lhs of eq .",
    "( [ p^j - p^n ] ) to zero , the slope of @xmath85 line in fig .",
    "1 is simply given by @xmath86 .",
    "thus the slope ratio can be written as @xmath87 therefore , the behavior of the slope ratio is controlled by a single function @xmath88 .    to have a qualitative understanding",
    "we perform perturbation expansion assuming matter effect is small , @xmath89 . noting that @xmath90 for both jhf and numi we obtain , to first order in matter effect , @xmath91 ( al ) |_{numi } -   2 \\left [ \\frac{2}{\\delta_{13}^j } - \\cot{\\left(\\frac{\\delta_{13}^j}{2 } \\right ) } \\right ] ( al ) |_{jhf } \\label{app_slratio}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , the slope of positive-@xmath3 `` pencil '' is larger than negative-@xmath3 `` pencil '' because of the larger matter effect in numi .    to understand the energy dependence of the slope ratio we note that @xmath92 is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath93 in @xmath94 .",
    "let us first examine the case of @xmath95 . when the neutrino energy is increased from the oscillation maximum ( which means lowering @xmath26 s ) the slope ratio decreases , in agreement with the behavior in fig .  1 , from 1(a ) to 1(d ) .",
    "we have checked that lowering the energy ( larger @xmath26 s ) in fact leads to larger slope ratio . however at energies below oscillation maximum the probabilities and event rates rapidly get smaller .    the behavior of slopes of `` pencils '' in other parts in fig .",
    "1 can also be understood in a similar manner . from fig .",
    "1(a ) to 1(b ) the slope ratio decreases , whereas from fig .",
    "1(a ) to 1(c ) it increases . the change in 1(a ) to 1(b ) is obtained by lowering @xmath96 while keeping @xmath97 fixed . since the second term in the rhs of ( [ app_slratio ] ) decreases as @xmath96 decreases , and hence the slope ratio decreases , in agreement with figs .",
    "1(a ) and 1(b ) .",
    "similarly , from fig .",
    "1(a ) to 1(c ) @xmath97 decreases while keeping @xmath96 is kept fixed .",
    "it should lead relatively small amount of increase in the slope ratio , again in agreement with figs .",
    "1(a ) and 1(c ) .",
    "however the slope of these `` pencils '' is not the total story , the width of the `` pencils '' is also important . although the ratio of slopes is slightly larger in fig .",
    "1(c ) than fig .",
    "1(a ) the width of the `` pencils '' is significantly larger for fig .",
    "1(c ) than fig .",
    "1(a ) such that the separation of the allowed regions is smaller for fig .",
    "1(c ) than fig .",
    "the square of the width of the `` pencils '' is controlled by the quantity @xmath98 for @xmath99 , the width equals @xmath100 and is very small .",
    "this smallness follows from the fact that , at the same @xmath26 , the identity @xmath101 holds ( @xmath102 depends only on vacuum parameters ) , and ratio of @xmath103 to @xmath104 is close to unit . if @xmath105 , then @xmath106 and the width of the pencil grows rapidly as the cancellation that occurs for the same @xmath26 no longer holds .",
    "thus the width of the `` pencils '' in fig .",
    "1(b ) and fig .",
    "1(c ) are approximately equal and are much larger than the width in fig .",
    "1(a ) and fig .",
    "the conclusion to be gained from these results and figures is that if you are making a comparison of a jhf neutrino experiment and a numi neutrino experiment to determine the sign @xmath3 then the best separation occurs when @xmath107 i.e. the same @xmath108 for both experiments .",
    "smaller values of the @xmath109 are slightly preferred so that we expect the optimum value , once all experimental issues are included , to be near oscillation maximum ( fig .",
    "1(a ) and 1(d ) ) .",
    "away from the same @xmath108 for both experiments the separation between the allowed region becomes worse , apart from special ranges of the cp or t violating phase @xmath2 when @xmath110 ( fig .",
    "whereas for the choice @xmath111 ( i.e @xmath112 ) there is significant overlap between the two different sign of @xmath3 allowed regions ( fig .",
    "( if one moves further , say , to @xmath113 gev and @xmath114 gev , the two pencils overlap almost completely . ) in these regions no matter how accurate the experiment the sign of @xmath3 can not be determined by this comparison .",
    "( for jhf anti - neutrinos versus numi anti - neutrinos the conclusion is the same . )    in summary , for the comparison jhf neutrinos to numi neutrinos to be useful in the determination of the sign of @xmath3 , choosing @xmath115 is of great importance with the preference for equal @xmath116 .",
    "for @xmath117 there is significant overlap between the narrow allowed regions so that this is not a good choice for this comparison .",
    "contrary to advantage of @xmath9-@xmath9 comparison in determination of the sign of @xmath3 , measurement of @xmath1 suffers from large uncertainty in this channel .",
    "the bi - probalitity trajectory , for a given @xmath37 , moves nearly along the direction of the `` pencil '' as one varies @xmath2 , thus any measurement of the oscillation probabilities with finite resolution can not pinpoint the value of @xmath37 . to indicate this point we have plotted in fig .  1 by numbers in % beside thin arcs the fractional difference @xmath118 , where @xmath119 and @xmath120 here indicate the maximal and the minimal values of @xmath1 along each arc . the numbers are large , typically 30 % or even larger .    in fact",
    ", it is easy to do analytical estimate of the fractional difference .",
    "suppose that we have measured an appearance probability @xmath121 or @xmath62 .",
    "we assume for simplicity that we know the sign of @xmath3 , and restrict ourselves into the case of oscillation maximum , @xmath122 .",
    "the measured probability allows a range of @xmath1 @xcite and one can easily calculate the maximal value of @xmath123 within the range , which leads to @xmath124 since @xmath125 is a few % level , it leads to a few tens in % of the fractional difference , in agreement with the numbers in fig .  1",
    ".      we now turn to the comparison for jhf neutrinos and numi anti - neutrinos or vice versa with flipped signs of @xmath3 .",
    "again one can write a simple formulae relating the two oscillation probabilities similar to eq .",
    "( [ p^j - p^n ] ) @xmath126   \\theta \\cos{\\delta }   \\nonumber \\\\ & & - \\left [ \\frac { y^n_{\\mp}}{x^n_{\\mp } }   \\sin { \\left(\\frac{\\delta_{13}^n}{2}\\right ) } -   \\frac{y^j_{\\pm}}{x^j_{\\pm } }   \\sin { \\left(\\frac{\\delta_{13}^j}{2}\\right ) }   \\right ]   \\theta \\sin{\\delta }   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & 2 \\left ( c_{\\pm } \\cos{\\delta } \\pm s_{\\pm } \\sin{\\delta }   \\right)\\theta \\label{p^j - pbar^n}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the square of the rhs of this equation controls the square of the width of the allowed region and is given by @xmath127 apart from an overall factor of @xmath128 .",
    "as @xmath129 varies from @xmath130 ( both experiments at energies twice the oscillation maximum energy ) to @xmath68 ( both experiments at the oscillation maximum energy ) this squared width grows from @xmath131 note that the later width is larger than the first width since @xmath132 has opposite sign to @xmath133 ( no cancellation occurs here ) .",
    "thus the width of the allowed region grows as you lower the energies of the experiments to oscillation maximum .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "2 ; 2(d ) has the smallest width whereas 2(a ) has the largest in accordance with the above statement .",
    "there is significant overlap between the allowed regions of positive and negative @xmath3 contours .",
    "hence , the @xmath9-@xmath10 comparison does not appear to be the right way for determining the sign , unless @xmath2 turns out to be close to @xmath134 and @xmath135 for @xmath7 and @xmath8 cases , respectively @xcite .",
    "however , this comparison may be better to measure @xmath1 if jhf operate only in neutrino channel , as planned , and if numi off - axis is running with significant overlap with jhf phase i. for this purpose , the best way of measuring @xmath1 would be to tune the energy at oscillation maxima for both jhf and numi .",
    "this is just an extension of the kmn strategy@xcite .",
    "the reader may be curious as to why the slopes of the shrunken trajectories at @xmath136 are positive in @xmath9-@xmath9 comparison whereas they are negative in @xmath9-@xmath10 comparison .",
    "this can be easily understood as follows : the slopes of shrunken trajectories in @xmath9-@xmath9 comparison are given by @xmath137 ( @xmath138 ) for positive ( negative ) @xmath3 .",
    "on the other hand , the slopes in @xmath9-@xmath10 comparison are given by @xmath139 ( @xmath140 ) for positive ( negative ) @xmath3 .",
    "since @xmath25 differ in sign , as in eq .",
    "( [ y ] ) , the latter slopes are negative definite , whereas the former are positive definite .",
    "the fact that the @xmath9-@xmath9 trajectory is along the `` pencil '' and @xmath9-@xmath10 trajectory is perpendicular to axis of the `` cigar '' can be understood by a similar argument .",
    "when we have access to @xmath79 and @xmath141 beams then a comparison of a @xmath38 experiment with @xmath142 experiment will be possible .- beams @xcite . ]",
    "this comparison is interesting because it directly compares two cpt conjugate processes .",
    "if cpt is conserved , then at the same e / l the only difference between the oscillation probabilities for @xmath38 and @xmath142 can come from matter effects .",
    "thus this comparison is even more sensitive to the mass hierarchy , i.e. the sign of @xmath3 , than the neutrino - neutrino comparison discussed earlier in the previous section .    for this comparison",
    "the bi - probability figure looks similar to fig .  1 but the difference in slope between the `` pencils '' is enhanced because the sign of the matter effect is opposite for @xmath142 compared to @xmath38 and the cp or t violating terms are identical in sign and magnitude .",
    "therefore this comparison provides an excellent way to separate the two signs of @xmath3 .",
    "if we label the two experiments as j and n as before then the ratio of slopes is given by @xmath143 ( al ) |_{n } +   2 \\left [ \\frac{2}{\\delta_{13}^j } - \\cot{\\left(\\frac{\\delta_{13}^j}{2 } \\right ) } \\right ] ( al ) |_{j}. \\label{app_slratio2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this expression differs from that of eq.([app_slratio ] ) by the sign of the third term . here",
    "the matter effects for both experiments enhance the ratio of the slopes whereas in the neutrino - neutrino comparison early there was a partial cancellation .",
    "although at present the comparison of this section is purely academic it is instructive and useful for understanding the general nature of the comparison of neutrino oscillation experiments and will be important to test the possibility of cpt violation in the future .",
    "we have presented a general formalism for comparing two or more long baseline neutrino oscillation experiments and applied this formalism to the jhf and numi experiments . the combination of modes that will be important depends on the question one is asking and what other information is available at the time .",
    "the use of bi - probability diagrams like the ones presented in this paper will be important for understanding the physics issues and making trade offs at the time decisions are made regarding neutrino energies and modes of operation .    in general , the both neutrino or",
    "both anti - neutrino comparison is useful for determining whether the mass hierarchy is normal or inverted , i.e. the sign @xmath3 .",
    "however , it is important here that the experiment with the larger matter effect ( longer baseline - numi ) have a smaller or equal neutrino energy over baseline , e / l , than the experiment with smaller matter effect ( shorter baseline - jhf ) .",
    "if the jhf experiment runs first then numi should also run at a similar or smaller e / l to provide the best sensitivity to the different mass hierarchies .",
    "the separation between the different mass hierarchies is reduced if the numi e / l is higher than the jhf e / l .",
    "the size of the small mixing angle , @xmath1 , can not be determined to better than about 30% with this comparison alone .",
    "the one neutrino - one anti - neutrino comparison is in general most useful for determining the size of the small mixing angle , @xmath1 and the cp or t violating phase @xmath2 .",
    "it could also be useful in determining the mass hierarchy provided nature does not choose the large overlap region in the bi - probability plot .",
    "for this comparison , the uncertainty in @xmath1 from the degeneracy issue is not important until the experimental resolution in @xmath1 is better than 10% .",
