    "efficient and reliable transmission of information in noisy environment plays a central role in modern information society .",

    ", claude shannon @xcite proved that error - free transmission is possible as long as the code rate @xmath0 ( the ratio between the number of bits in the original message and the number of bits in the transmitted message ) doesnot exceed the capacity of the channel ( shannon s bound ) .",
    "more explicitly , for the binary symmetric channel ( bsc ) where each transmitted bit is flipped independently with flip rate @xmath1 , the shannon bound is expressed as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the binary entropy in the information theory literature @xcite . this celebrated channel encoding theorem forms the core of information theory .",

    ", the statistical mechanics analysis of sourlas codes has been successfully generalized to other types of error - correcting codes including low - density parity - check ( ldpc ) codes , mackay - neal codes , turbo codes , etc .",
    "methods of statistical physics , complementary to those used in information theory , enable one to attain a more complete picture of decoding process by analyzing global properties of the corresponding free energy landscape .",
    "they also allow one to optimize the performances of various codes by changing some construction parameters .",
    "the procedure of constructing a sourlas code is very simple . to infer which bit",
    "is flipped by noise at the receiving end of transmission , one has to introduce redundancy to the original message at the sending end . as for the sourlas code ,",
    "the redundancy is introduced by the boolean sum of randomly selected message bits . through the transformation @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the boolean bit and",
    "@xmath6 the ising spin , the original bit sequence @xmath7 can be regarded as an ising spin configuration @xmath8 . in this way , the modulo @xmath9 addition is equivalent to spin multiplication ; and then the sourlas code can be mapped to a many - body spin glass problem @xcite . in a general scenario ,",
    "the original message is an n - dimensional vector @xmath10 , @xmath11 sets of interactions are constructed by taking the product of randomly sampled @xmath12 bits from the sequence of the original message , i.e. , @xmath13 @xmath14 .",
    "then they are fed into the noisy channel . at the destination , @xmath15 corrupted interactions @xmath16 , some of which being different from those at the sending end , are received .",
    "the arising problem is how to infer the original bits from the knowledge of channel outputs , statistical properties of the channel and of the source . in the presence of weak noise , searching for the ground state of the corresponding spin glass model with given outputs @xmath17 will lead to successful decoding .",
    "this decoding scheme is nothing but maximum _ a posterior _ probability ( map ) decoding .",
    "when the noise becomes strong , the finite temperature decoding or marginal _ posterior _ maximizer ( mpm ) scheme should be adopted since the ground state would probably contain no information about the original message @xcite .",

    "however , the shannon s bound couldnot be achieved for finite @xmath12 despite its practical significance .",
    "all the aforementioned investigations rely upon the replica method developed initially for solving the sherrington - kirkpatrick model of spin glass @xcite .",
    "moreover , they are restricted to the replica symmetry ( rs ) assumption due to the emerging more complicated saddle point analysis of replica symmetry breaking .",
    "nevertheless , recent developments in the study of ldpc codes @xcite showed that the one - step replica symmetry breaking ( 1rsb ) type algorithm is able to shift the dynamical phase transition @xcite to a higher value as compared with rs type algorithms .",
    "similar results were obtained on the finite connectivity sourlas code system from the dynamic point of view @xcite . in this work",
    "we study the equilibrium properties of the finite connectivity sourlas code system by using the cavity method of statistical physics @xcite .",
    "the cavity method has its own advantages over the replica method .",
    "the latter is based on a saddle point analysis of @xmath20-dimensional integral in the limit @xmath21 .",
    "this analytic continuation in the number of replicas hasnt been confirmed to hold generally , neither has the validity of the exchange of the order of two limits ( @xmath22 and @xmath21 ) . on the other hand",
    ", the cavity method adopts a direct probabilistic analysis , which makes it applicable to single problem instances . in this paper , it is expected that the cavity method reproduces results obtained by replica theory . within the cavity framework ,",
    "the entropic contribution in the zero temperature limit can be taken into account by means of first order corrections in temperature @xmath23 , which has led to interesting insights on the ground state solution space properties of several disordered systems such as the random vertex cover problem and the random matching problem @xcite .",

    "[ mpmvsecfp ] . in order to validate the mean field results",
    ", we run the ecfp decoding algorithm on a single instance .",
    "the comparison is shown in fig .",
    "the size of the graph is set to be @xmath164 and the code rate @xmath138 . for one iteration step ,",
    "messages from each bit on the graph are updated one time on average .",
    "we also set the maximal number of iteration steps @xmath165 to be @xmath166 .",
    "the decoding result on single graph is averaged over ten individual simulations for each flip rate @xmath1 . as observed in our simulations , the number of iteration steps , around @xmath167 , exceeds the preset value on most of the presented instances , which manifests the ecfp starts to lose the convergence on a single graph .",
    "however , the agreement with the mean field result is indeed remarkable .      as defined above",
    ", the irregular sourlas code is a combined system with various values of @xmath12 .",
    "it takes well the trade - off between excellent convergence property of low-@xmath12 codes and high decoding performance of high-@xmath12 codes . from the algorithmic point of view",
    ", the irregular code is also termed cascading code put forward in ref .",
    "@xcite and further studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this section ,",
    "we report results on typical properties of the combined system based on the cavity analysis presented in sec .",
    "[ subsec : disc ] .    to retain the same code rate @xmath138 ,",
    "we choose @xmath168 as code construction parameters .",
    "population dynamics recipe is used to solve eq .",
    "( [ bp_irre ] ) , and the size of population is assumed to be of order @xmath156 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ irregular ] , the combined system exhibits a first order phase transition as the @xmath129 case , which was also observed in ref .",
    "@xcite where the cascaded encoding / decoding scheme was employed . after this transition ,",
    "the free energy crosses over to a lower value",
    ". however , as the flip rate @xmath1 increases to a high enough value , the rs entropy will be negative and the rs assumption is then incorrect , indicating replica symmetry should be broken . as observed in fig .",
    "[ irregular ] , the finite temperature ( nishimori s temperature ) decoding is superior to the zero temperature one when the noise level becomes no longer low .",
    "compared with the regular code of @xmath129 , the boa for the combined system becomes larger thus we only need to take the initial bias @xmath169 .",
    "additionally , the overlap of decoding for the combined system is higher than that of @xmath128 . therefore , results demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ irregular ] provide us an opportunity to construct an optimal code . as has been stated in refs .",
    "@xcite , one can use multiple values of @xmath12 in the interactions . as a first step , belief propagation or 1rsb algorithm",
    "is run on a partial system with only low @xmath12 ( @xmath128 ) interactions since the low-@xmath12 code has perfect convergence properties .",
    "the end overlap at the first stage is expected to be well within the boa of the combined system .",
    "once higher body ( e.g. , @xmath129 ) interactions are invoked , an end overlap higher than the one obtained by the initial step will be resulted in .",
    "in this work , we have studied the finite connectivity sourlas code based on the cavity method .",
    "conventional replica results on the regular code are cross - checked .",
    "moreover , this cavity analysis is extended to the irregular case .",
    "typical properties of the combined system are investigated .",
    "it is shown that the decoding for the combined system exhibits a first order phase transition as occurs in the regular case ( @xmath129 ) .",
    "the combined system is of two striking features , one is the initial bias required for convergence is degraded , the other is the final performance is enhanced .",
    "actually , this does mean that the good dynamical properties ( large boa ) and high decoding performance should be compromised in the algorithmic implementation .",
    "thus introducing gradually higher @xmath12 interactions seems to be an effective way to take advantage of this trade - off .    as for the regular codes system ,",
    "the evanescent cavity fields propagation equation is proposed for the first time . and",
    "it is capable of extracting the entropic information in the zero temperature limit , thus the decoding performance is considerably enhanced compared with the traditional case where only the hard field is taken into account .",
    "numerical simulations on single instances are compatible with the mean field results .",
    "the cavity methodology , applied in our work , is very promising . unlike replica trick",
    ", it formulates assumptions in a more explicit manner , even opens the way to algorithmic implementations on one single instance . in this work",
    ", we also discovered that the system shows negative entropy in the presence of low enough decoding temperature and high enough flip rate , therefore 1rsb is needed for further investigation on the finite connectivity sourlas code .",
    "fortunately , the cavity method can be easily generalized to 1rsb case . meanwhile , the 1rsb frozen spin glass scheme we have adopted in sec .  [ sec_rsc ] could be also cross - checked . on the other hand ,",
    "further study is required for the combined system to elucidate under what conditions the channel capacity is achieved @xcite .",
    "finally , the methodology is expected to be applied to more practical codes like ldpc codes .",
    "these lines of research are currently under way and these further investigations are anticipated to provide deeper insights into a variety of codes with low density nature of constructions .",
