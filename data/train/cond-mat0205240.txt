    "when a magnetic field is applied , it is well known that the superconductivity properties collapse , e.g. ( i ) the critical temperature @xmath0 decreases @xcite , ( ii ) the critical current density decreases @xcite , ( iii ) the electrical resistance and ( iv ) the thermo - electrical power become finite below @xmath0 @xcite , ( v ) the thermal conductivity behaves anomalously @xcite ... indeed a magnetic field is known as a cooper pair breaker .",
    "in fact the behavior of the mean free path of electricity and heat carriers in e.g. high - t@xmath1 superconductors materials is a widely discussed problem particularly in presence of a magnetic field .    without a magnetic field ,",
    "the thermal conductivity of these materials exhibits a hump below the critical temperature .",
    "the cause is not wholly clear nor really understood : there are different view points , based on the prominence of an increase of the mean free path of phonon , thus with reduced scattering @xcite or from an increase of the mean free path of electrons @xcite , or a complicated combination of both due to the chemistry @xcite .",
    "note that the previously quoted references are only a microsample of a huge literature on the subject , but not all reports ( more than 300 ) can be quoted here .",
    "on the other hand , in presence of any @xmath2 applied magnetic field , this mean free path apparently decreases as indicated by the lowering of the thermal conductivity hump amplitude .",
    "the discussion of the findings pertain to the understanding of the mixed state properties for d - wave ( or s - wave as sometimes thought ) superconductors , and the role of phonons and electrons in a magnetic field ( see above references in appropriate cases , and also @xcite ) .",
    "if they are more or less well understood at high field and low temperature , their interpretation is not so trivial in the regions where the various phase transition lines merge into each other , thus near @xmath0 and at low field @xcite .",
    "since the thermal diffusivity is related to the thermal conductivity , the same fundamental questions arise here , - less studies are found .",
    "the thermal diffusivity is known to be a good probe for measuring the heat carrier mean free path @xcite and even find out the relevance of van hove saddle points in high @xmath0 superconductors @xcite .",
    "discussing the thermal diffusivity behavior below and above @xmath0 in absence of a magnetic field has recently allowed us to distinguish the contribution of electrons and phonons in the dissipation process . on the other hand ,",
    "comparison of the thermal diffusivity behaviors with and without magnetic field below @xmath0 should allow for extracting the contribution of the magnetic field .",
    "this would give interesting informations about electron - vortex interactions .. ] here we show that such a contribution can be extracted , even close to @xmath0 , and at rather low field .",
    "the experimental data are our own measurements on a polycrystalline bi-2212 sample . despite its polycrystalline morphology ,",
    "the advantage of such a sample resides in the possibility to obtain it as a long bar out of a pellet , whence allowing a fine sensitivity of the measurements even at small field .",
    "this compound and sample are expected to be representative of most high - t@xmath1 superconductor materials , in particular of their anisotropic ( 2d ) nature .    in a simple kinetic model formalism",
    ", the thermal diffusivity @xmath3 is defined as the ratio between the thermal conductivity @xmath4 and the volumic specific heat @xmath5 , and can be thus expressed through @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the velocity of the heat carriers and @xmath8 the mean free path .",
    "assuming @xmath7 to be a constant in a restricted range of temperature of interest , as here , the thermal diffusivity is thus an adequate ( or direct ) probe for measuring the mean free path of heat carriers .",
    "when a magnetic field is applied , @xmath8 may be rewritten as usual within the linear superposition approximation as @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the mean free path of heat carriers respectively without and with the influence of an applied magnetic field . from eq.([diff ] ) and eq.([ell ] ) @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath3 are the thermal diffusivities without and with magnetic field respectively and @xmath14 is the magnetic contribution to the thermal diffusivity .",
    "these formulae serve as a basis for the discussion of the vortex - heat carrier interaction in the mixed phase near t@xmath1 . after a description of the synthesis and of the characterization of the sample in sect.2 ,",
    "the measurements of the thermal diffusivity of the bi-2212 sample are presented in sect.3 . the magnetic contribution to the mean free path is extracted and the results are then discussed .",
    "powders of bi@xmath15o@xmath16 , srco@xmath16 , caco@xmath16 , cuo and pbo@xmath15 were mixed mechanically together using an agathe mortar starting from a 2234 stoichiometry in order to obtain a 2212-bscco ( bi-2212 ) stoichiometric composition .",
    "this mixture was decarbonated at 800@xmath17c for 20h and melted in an alumina crucible at 1075@xmath17c for 30 minutes in air .",
    "the liquid was quenched between two room temperature copper blocks to form a glass .",
    "the pellets were heated in oxygen atmosphere on a barium zirconate substrates at 860@xmath17c for 50h @xcite . despite its polycrystalline morphology ,",
    "the advantage of such a sample is that it can be long .",
    "this allows a better sensitivity for the measurement and the effect of a small field can be as such observed .",
    "the electrical resistivity curve is represented on fig.1 .",
    "the superconducting midpoint transition occurs around 85 k. at high temperature , the resistivity is linear with a 10m@xmath18.m resistivity at 0k and about 40m@xmath18.m at 225 k. when a magnetic field is applied , the resistivity transition midpoint is shifted towards lower temperature , ca .",
    "80 k for a 1.0 t field .",
    "the thermal diffusivity has been measured as described in @xcite and the technique is briefly recalled here .",
    "a rod is first cut out from one of the chemically characterized bi-2212 pellet .",
    "one of the extremities of the bar is fixed to a heat sink , whilst the other is linked to a heather .",
    "three thermocouples are set along the sample at equal distances from each other . a heat pulse is sent through the sample from one end and the change of temperature is recorded by one of the thermocouples .",
    "this operation is renewed 3 times , namely once per thermocouple .",
    "the signals recorded by the two extreme thermocouples give the limit (  boundary  ) conditions so as to compute the shape of the signal from the heat diffusion equation , at the middle thermocouple , for different _ a priori _ values of the thermal diffusivity .",
    "the results of such calculations are compared to the measured signal at the middle thermocouple .",
    "the best fit allows us to deduce the value of the thermal diffusivity at this temperature .",
    "in fig.2 , the thermal diffusivity is shown between 20 and 160 k. the black bullets ( @xmath19 ) represent the thermal diffusivity @xmath13 without any magnetic field . as for the circles ( @xmath20 )",
    ", they symbolize the results with a 1.0 t magnetic field applied perpendicularly to the heat flux , @xmath3 .",
    "the two curves are seen to be superposed on each other at high temperature .",
    "such a magnetic field is indeed too small to create any visible effects on thermal properties in the normal state . on the other hand",
    ", the thermal diffusivity differently behaves below the critical temperature with and without the magnetic field : in presence of a magnetic field the diffusivity is slightly lower .",
    "thus the magnetic field shows its expected pair breaker role . in the framework of the electronic model for heat transport , @xcite that means that the electron - electron scattering is enhanced , or in other words that electrons have a decreasing mean free path .",
    "the inset of the fig.2 is the thermal diffusivity with and without the 1.0 t magnetic field in a log - log plot .",
    "this plot emphasizes that a break in the slopes occurs at 85k , the critical temperature of the bi-2212 phase .",
    "this should be expected from our previous report @xcite .",
    "the change in magnitude is due to the sudden increase of the mean free path of electrons below @xmath0 .",
    "they are indeed less scattered by their counterparts since some electrons belong to condensed cooper pairs in this temperature range .",
    "thus the visible deviation between the thermal diffusivity with and without a magnetic field shows that even a small magnetic field ( 1.0 t here ) markedly acts on the thermal transport in superconducting phase .    the magnetic contribution to the mean free path can be obtained from eq.([alpha ] ) .",
    "the results are shown in fig.3 , i.e. @xmath21 versus the reduced temperature @xmath22 .",
    "notice that some numerical smoothening data is necessary in order to reduce error bar propagation .",
    "it is seen that the normalized value @xmath21 behaves as a power law with an exponent found to be equal to @xmath23 .    this power law behavior and the exponent value itself",
    "remind us of the azlamazov - larkin law @xcite for the paraconductivity in its mean field regime .",
    "the law is usually studied between the onset temperature @xmath24 and @xmath0 , thus above @xmath0 .",
    "however the azlamazov - larkin law holds also below @xmath0 because of the scaling hypothesis universality .",
    "the temperature region which is here above studied extends much below the critical temperature and the precision of the data near @xmath0 can not be expected to lead to critical fluctuations studied _ per se _ , but the mean field exponent of superconductivity fluctuations might be probed .",
    "it can be shown that the same type of contribution exists in the electrical ( @xmath25 ) and thermal ( @xmath26 ) paraconductivity @xcite . with the trivial change of variables on the temperature axis @xmath27 and @xmath24 @xmath28 @xmath0 respectively , we can write @xmath29 , for the @xmath30 @xmath31 , the @xmath32 notation indicating in both cases the deviation form the normal state behavior . remembering that    @xmath33    for a @xmath34 type of fluctuations @xcite , and assuming that 1 t is a low field such that the azlamazov - larkin law is still obeyed we can from the amplitude obtain an estimate of the shortening of the zero temperature coherence length @xmath35 between zero and 1 t field",
    ". a simple numerical calculation leads to @xmath36 .",
    "as e.g. for neutron scattering processes in disordered 2d ( magnetic ) systems @xcite the total inverse correlation length can be assumed to be the sum of a strictly thermal term and a geometrical term linked ( in that case ) to the disordered network , i.e. a relation similar to eq.([ell ] ) for @xmath35 .",
    "this analogy indicates that the found power law behavior can be interpreted as resulting from a percolation process of heat carrier through a complicated vortex state @xcite , and further justifies the analogy with the azlamazov - larkin law _ for heat carriers in the mixed state _ at low fields .",
    "one might also wonder why a @xmath34 behavior ( and exponent is found rather that the exponent , i.e. @xmath37 corresponding to a @xmath38 behavior , since bi-2212 is expected to have an effective dimensionality closer to 2 than 3 .",
    "the argument stems from the anisotropy itself . at the critical temperature itself",
    ", the coherence length diverges and one expects a @xmath34 behavior . when departing from @xmath0 the effective dimensionality signature should appear , thus leading here to a @xmath39 behavior .",
    "however this lasts as long as the temperature is in the temperature range limited by the onset of the true critical regime , i.e. the ginzburg - levanyuk temperature , @xcite and by the lawrence - doniach temperature , in anisotropic systems @xcite .",
    "away from the lawrence - doniach temperature , up to the onset temperature , or at low temperature down to the temperature at which the coherence length saturates , one should recover a @xmath34 regime @xcite .",
    "in bi-2212 , this [ ginzburg - levanyuk ; lawrence - doniach ] temperature range is estimated to be 50k , @xmath40 mev @xcite the exchange integral along the c - axis .",
    "the data where the exponent @xmath41 is found is far away from the critical regime , and thus is the signature of the geometrical disorder intrinsic to the polycrystalline system .",
    "the mixed state of high @xmath0 superconductors still has to reveal many features and to be understood .",
    "electrical and transport properties contain the signature of the various vortex phases , and to distinguish them is not so trivial . here the magnetic contribution to the mean free path of heat carriers in a high - t@xmath1 superconductor has been extracted in the low field and in the near @xmath0 region .",
    "it has been found to increase below @xmath0 as a power law characterized by a @xmath41 exponent .",
    "this behavior is linked to a percolation process of the electron scattering in the vortex network characterizing the mixed state .",
    "we should emphasize that the above ( temperature , field ) conditions are not rather usual ones for probing the mixed state . if the diffusivity was not so hard to measure , its sensitivity to physical phenomena would be a bonus for interesting conclusions .",
    "such a remark may suggest new ways of probing whence understanding the ( @xmath42 ) phase diagram .",
