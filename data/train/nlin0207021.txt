    "nonlinear time series analysis based on the theory of deterministic chaos has turned out to be a powerful tool in understanding complex dynamics from measurements and observational time series . in particular it can provide descriptions and interpretations for irregular times series , which nevertheless might not be governed by a stochastic physical process and which are only poorly understood by linear methods .",
    "a number of recent reviews and conference proceedings shows the great interest in the field of nonlinear time series analysis ( see , for instance , grassberger et al .",

    "since the development of chaos theory , it is well known that even simple dynamical systems , described by few nonlinear differential equations , can reveal a complex and quasi - irregular behavior . a central concept to characterize such systems",
    "is the so - called _",
    "attractor_. under the dynamics of a deterministic system the trajectories do not cover the whole phase space , but , after all transient phenomena have faded out , converge to a subset of the phase space , the attractor .",
    "the attractor itself is invariant to the dynamical evolution .",
    "simple examples of attractors are fixed points and limit cycles . however , when the related dynamical system is _ chaotic _ , the attractor can have a complex geometry with a _ fractal _",
    ", i.e. , non - integer , dimension .",
    "different invariant parameters exist to describe the geometry and the dynamics of an attractor , such as dimensions , lyapunov exponents and entropies . besides the fractal geometry",
    ", chaotic systems have the striking property that initially neighboring trajectories diverge exponentially under the dynamics , and the growth rate is given by the _",
    "lyapunov exponent_. this phenomenon results from the folding and stretching of the trajectories under the dynamics , the folding leading to the convergence of the trajectories to the attractor and the stretching to the divergence in certain directions . while the average stretching rate is given by the lyapunov exponent , the loss of information due to the folding is quantified by the _",
    "entropy_. lyapunov exponents and entropies characterize the dynamics on the attractor , and the _ dimension _ characterizes its geometry .",
    "the physical meaning of the dimension of an attractor is that it corresponds to the degree of freedom of the related dynamical system , i.e. , in a deterministic case , the minimum number of ordinary differential equations needed to fully describe the system .",
    "deterministic systems are characterized by a finite dimension .",
    "deterministic chaotic systems have the additional characteristic that their dimension is fractal .",
    "contrary to that , a stochastic system is characterized by an infinite dimension , indicating its infinite degree of freedom .",
    "therefore , the determination of the dimension of an attractor enables to discriminate whether a dynamical system is deterministic or stochastic .",
    "previous papers exist concerning the investigation of fractal dimensions of solar radio bursts .",
    "it has to be noted , that the time series used by the different authors are not directly comparable as they represent different types of radio events .",
    "kurths & herzel ( @xcite , @xcite ) , kurths & karlick@xmath0 ( @xcite ) , and kurths et al .",
    "( @xcite ) analyzed decimetric pulsations and ascertained finite dimension values .",
    "contrary to that , isliker ( @xcite ) and isliker & benz ( @xcite , @xcite ) investigated different types of solar radio bursts in the metric  ( m ) and decimetric  ( dm ) wavelength range ( type  i storms , type  ii bursts , type  iii bursts , type  iv events , and narrowband spikes ) , which did not reveal any hints for low - dimensional determinism .",
    "however , these investigations rely all on the correlation dimension method .",
    "the present paper additionally introduces a complementary dimension analysis , motivated by the fact that solar radio bursts represent real - world systems , which implies some major restrictions .",
    "first , the time series can not be expected to be stationary , and second , pure determinism is rather unlikely to be realized .",
    "therefore we do not only concentrate on the usual way of looking at the problem :  does the analyzed time series represent a deterministic or a stochastic system ? \" but in particular focus the question :  what statistical description can be extracted from a dimension analysis of the time series ? \" with such refined formulation of the problem , we try to make use of the concepts and tools of nonlinear time series analysis even in cases in which the determination of invariants of the dynamics , as , e.g. , attractor dimensions , possibly fails .",

    "generally , not all relevant parameters of the dynamics of a system are measured during an observation but only a one - dimensional time series is given . to reconstruct the phase space of the related dynamical system",
    ", techniques have to be applied to unfold the multi - dimensional attractor from a scalar time series . by the technique of time delayed",
    "coordinates ( takens @xcite ) , from a given one - dimensional time series  @xmath1 an @xmath2-dimensional phase space  @xmath3 is built up by the prescription @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the time delay .    according to the embedding theorem of takens ( @xcite ) ,",
    "the embedding of the attractor in the @xmath2-dimensional reconstructed phase space can be ensured if , with  @xmath6 the dimension of the original phase space . for time series of infinite length and accuracy , @xmath5 can be chosen in a more or less arbitrary way without affecting the results .",
    "however , in practice not every value for the time delay  @xmath5 will be suitable .",
    "too small  @xmath5 will build up coordinates which are too strongly correlated , while for large  @xmath5 the vector components show no causal connection .",
    "the choice of the time delay  @xmath5 in the reconstruction of the phase space usually strongly affects the quality of the analysis , and different procedures have been worked out to ensure a proper choice of  @xmath5 .",
    "the most prominent methods use the auto - correlation time ( @xmath7  decay time , first zero crossing , first minimum ) or the first minimum of the mutual information ( fraser & swinney @xcite ) .",
    "one advantage of the _ mutual information _ over the auto - correlation function is that it takes into account nonlinear properties of the data .",
    "the mutual information is based on the shannon entropy ( shannon & weaver @xcite ) , and gives the information about the state of a system at time @xmath8 that we already possess if we know the state at time  @xmath9 .",
    "the choice of the first minimum of the mutual information for the time delay  @xmath5 is motivated by the fact that two successive delay coordinates should be as independent as possible without making  @xmath5 too large .",
    "the correlation dimension is one out of many definitions of fractal dimensions , and was introduced by grassberger & procaccia ( @xcite , @xcite ) to determine fractal dimensions from time series .",
    "the correlation dimension is based on distance measurements of points in phase space . therefore , as first step , from the time series  @xmath1 the phase space vectors  @xmath3 have to be constructed . with the reconstructed vectors , the correlation integral  @xmath10 can be calculated , which is given by the normalized number of pairs of points within a distance  @xmath11 . as the correlation dimension is based on spatial correlations in phase space",
    ", it is an important precaution to exclude serially correlated points in counting the pairs ( for details see sect .  [ temporalcorrelations ] ) , and the length of the window ,  @xmath12 , should at least cover all points within the auto - correlation time ( theiler @xcite ) . with this correction ,",
    "the correlation integral is given by @xmath13 @xmath14 where n denotes the overall number of data points , and @xmath15 is the heaviside step function . for small distances  @xmath11",

    "the local pointwise dimension is a locally defined variant of the correlation dimension .",
    "its definition is based on the probability  @xmath21 to find points in a neighborhood of a point  @xmath22 with size  @xmath23 : @xmath24 where @xmath25 gives the actual number of pairs of points in the sum . for small distances  @xmath11",

    "since the @xmath26 are local functions and defined for each point , they are , on the one hand , a function of the position  @xmath27 on the attractor , characterizing its local geometry . on the other hand ,",
    "the local dimensions can be interpreted as a function of time , @xmath33 , since they reflect the temporal evolution , in which the points  @xmath27 on the attractor are covered by the dynamics ( mayer - kress @xcite ) .",
    "based on this fact , local dimension estimations have the interesting property that they enable to cope with non - stationary data .    an example is shown in fig",
    ".  [ 9066_f1 ] , which illustrates the local pointwise dimensions calculated for a simulated time series , made up of three sections related to different attractors , the lorenz , a limit cycle and the rssler attractor . the evolution of the local pointwise dimensions  @xmath33 detects the different attractors successively operating in time .",
    "the averaged pointwise dimensions  @xmath30 in the respective sections deviate less than 10% from the true values . as for the calculation of the local dimension at point  @xmath27 the distances to _ all _ points of the time series , even those related to a different attractor , are taken into account , it is a quite striking feature that the different attractors can be disentangled by the method .",
    "moreover , for this exemplary analysis the length of the time series was taken rather short in order to mimic the conditions of observed time series .",
    "such a behavior reveals that the reference point  @xmath27 , which is equivalent to a time  @xmath34 of the dynamical evolution of the system , dominates the local dimension calculation .",
    "however , we want to stress that small changes of the attractor dimension , as , e.g. , in the case of the lorenz and the rssler attractor ( see fig .  [ 9066_f1 ] ) , can not be detected .",
    "the determination of fractal dimensions from time series , characterized by finite length and accuracy , includes many pitfalls , which can lead to quite spurious results . in this chapter",
    "the most prominent problems will be discussed and the strategies used by the authors to avoid such pitfalls .",
    "a brief but quite dense review with respect to critical points in the determination of the correlation dimension can be found in grassberger et al .",

    "[ pointdim1 ] for the probability  @xmath21 , respectively , a scaling behavior is expected for @xmath35 .",
    "however , for real time series , which are contaminated by noise and which are of finite length , the scaling behavior is expected to occur at intermediate length scales .",
    "noise is acting at small scales and therefore dominating the scaling behavior for small  @xmath11 .",
    "deviations from ideal scaling at large length scales are due to edge effects caused by the finite length of the time series .    fig .",
    "[ 9066_f2 ] shows such typical scaling behavior for a time series of finite length and accuracy . for better illustration",

    "however , it is typical for observational time series that at least three different parts in the @xmath37 curves are distinguishable , described in the caption of fig .",

    "[ testalgo ] ) .",
    "the correlation integral  @xmath10 and the probability  @xmath21 are a measure of spatial correlations on the attractor .",
    "they are basically calculated by counting pairs of points which are closer to each other than a given distance  @xmath11 .",
    "however , at small scales successive points of the time series give an additional contribution , since they are close in time . nevertheless , such points do not reflect spatial correlations , i.e. , a clustering of points in phase space , but are correlated by the temporal order of the time series . to avoid the spurious contribution of serially correlated points , which can cause strong artificial effects , especially for data recorded with a high sampling rate , at least all pairs of points closer than the auto - correlation time have to be excluded ( theiler @xcite ) : @xmath40    a similar phenomenon can occur when the analyzed time series is rather short .",
    "if the time series is too short to ensure that the attractor is well covered with points , then most of the points of the series are serially correlated , which again might result in spurious dimensions .",
    "different relations have been derived for the minimum length of a time series needed for dimension estimations , as the one by eckmann & ruelle ( @xcite ) : @xmath41 with n the length of the time series . however , not only the length of the data series is of relevance but also the length with regard to the sampling rate .",
    "applications to different kind of time series , from known chaotic attractors as well as measured time series ( brandstater & swinney @xcite ; kurths et al .",

    "we define the structures by the first minimum of the auto - correlation function , @xmath42 where @xmath43 gives the number of structures , n the length of the time series , @xmath44 the temporal resolution , and @xmath45 the auto - correlation time .      as shown by osborne et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and osborne & provenzale ( @xcite ) , the determination of the correlation dimension from non - stationary stochastic processes , can erroneously lead to finite dimension values . to take into account that problem",

    "burst time series , and only to such stationary subsections the correlation dimension analysis was applied .",
    "however , with the concept of local dimensions it is possible to cope with non - stationary data .",
    "one important advantage of the local dimension method is that it can enable to detect dynamical changes in a time series . to make use of this potentiality , we calculated the local pointwise dimensions from the whole time series instead of using stationary subsections .",
    "moreover , since the statistics in the calculation of the local pointwise dimensions grows linearly with the length of the time series , whereas the correlation dimension grows with the square of the number of points , for the local pointwise dimension analysis the time series should be kept as long as possible .",
    "however , to avoid spurious results due to non - stationarities , we applied a surrogate data test ( sect .",
    "[ surrogate ] ) .",
    "intermittency describes the phenomenon that a time series is interrupted by quiet phases or phases of very low amplitudes .",
    "such a phenomenon is quite typical for chaotic systems , but can cause problematic situations when calculating fractal dimensions from limited time series . in phase space",
    "the intermittent sections represent regions , which , in the context of the global attractor scale , degenerate to a point .",
    "this would trivially result in an erroneously low dimension value .",
    "one way to cope with this problem is just to discard intermittent phases from the analyzed time series . since the dimension of an attractor is a geometric descriptor , which means a static quantity , it is not influenced by the serial order of points , and therefore discarding subsections is a valid strategy .    as an example , the top panel of fig .",
    "[ 9066_f3 ] shows the subsection of a type  i burst series .",
    "the middle and bottom panels show the results of the correlation dimension analysis , calculated from the whole time series ( middle panels ) and the time series after the intermittent section was eliminated ( bottom panels ) .",
    "a comparison of the middle and bottom panels reveals that the intermittent phase causes a deformation in the curves of the correlation integral and the related local slopes . eliminating the intermittent section ,",
    "these deformations disappear . however , we want to stress that the used algorithm for the automatic detection of the scaling region does not identify the sink - region as a scaling region , which could result in spurious finite dimensions .",
    "therefore , by the set up of the scaling algorithm we avoid erroneous low dimensions caused by intermittency effects .",
    "the practical computation of the local pointwise dimensions turns out to be more difficult than the correlation dimension , particularly as for _ each _ reference point the scaling region has to be determined and the related  @xmath47 , which are calculated in the scaling region , have to be checked for convergence with increasing embedding dimension  @xmath2 . for this purpose , an automatic and fast procedure is needed .",
    "moreover , such an automatic procedure can also be used in the correlation dimension analysis to avoid subjective influences on the scaling and convergence judgement .",
    "we implemented such an algorithm , based on the one used by skinner et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , but modified in order to reach higher stability and significance .",
    "this automatic procedure searches for the scaling region , defined as the longest linear range in the @xmath48 curves , tests if the scaling region is of significant length , and finally checks if the  @xmath47 are converging with increasing  @xmath2 . only for points  @xmath27 , which pass the scaling and the convergence test ,",
    "a local pointwise dimension  @xmath26 is accepted . in the following we give a description of the algorithm .    according to eq .",
    "[ pointdim0 ] , for each reference point  @xmath27 and each considered embedding dimension  @xmath2 , we calculate the cumulative histogram of the  @xmath21 , dividing the @xmath11-range into 100  equidistant points in the logarithmic representation , which cover the whole range from the smallest to the largest actual distance .",
    "the local slopes of the @xmath48 versus @xmath49 curves , given by @xmath50 calculated in the scaling region , represent the  @xmath47 .",
    "for the determination of the location of the scaling range , we shift a window with length 10  points through the overall @xmath11-range , and for each of these windows a least squares linear fit is applied to the @xmath48 versus @xmath51 curves .",
    "the slope of the linear fit corresponds to the average value of the local slopes in the corresponding @xmath11-range , denoted as @xmath52 . starting with the first window ,",
    "successive  @xmath52 are compared with the corresponding quantity in the first window , until the difference is larger than a certain threshold value , chosen as 20% of the initial  @xmath52 . in this case , the position of the first point of the start window and the last point of the actual window are stored , and the procedure continues with the second window as start window . if the new positions determined cover a larger range than the old ones , the old values are overwritten by the new ones , and so on .",
    "the two stored values remaining at the end give the location of the scaling region , in which we calculate  @xmath47 . if the determined scaling region is smaller than 20% of the overall length , it is interpreted as not significant and rejected . to avoid spurious results at large  @xmath11 , which usually correspond to small @xmath52  values , in the whole procedure we suppress values @xmath53 .",

    "this fact we infer from the distinctly slower increase of the dimension values with increasing embedding dimension than expected for fully stochastic processes , which always fill the whole phase space , i.e. @xmath87 . moreover , the surrogate data analysis suggests that the time series do not represent linear stochastic processes .",
    "3 .   for most of the analyzed data sets we have evidence that nonlinearity in the time series is present ( given on a @xmath77  level by means of a surrogate data test ) .",

    "we find evidence for the spike events analyzed , that they do not represent a purely stochastic phenomenon in their temporal order either , even if the degree of freedom of the related physical system is expected to be quite high .",
    "interpreting this result in the frame of the scenario suggested by schwarz et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , it might give indications that the triggering of successive spikes by a localized source is not caused by a fully stochastic process , but reveals some ( possibly weak ) kind of nonlinear causal connection .",
    "however , this inference is restricted to the assumption that the spikes time series rather reflect the physical conditions of the triggering mechanism than those of the emission .",
    "pulsations , although a rather marginal phenomenon in the course of solar flares , have reached a wealth of attention , especially due to the very regular features they sometimes reveal ( for a review see aschwanden @xcite ) . in previous investigations of the dimensionality of solar pulsations ( kurths & herzel @xcite , @xcite ; kurths & karlick@xmath0 @xcite ; kurths et al .",

    "the inferred high - dimensionality and the nonlinear structures detected do not match with linear mhd oscillation models for pulsations ( e.g. , rosenberg @xcite ; roberts et al .",
    "@xcite ) , in which only a few eigenmodes are excited , but rather favor models of self - organizing systems of plasma instabilities , which comprise periodic as well as low- and high - dimensional chaotic behavior . such a self - organizing model for the electron - cyclotron maser instability , based on a lotka - volterra type equation system , is discussed in aschwanden & benz ( @xcite ) , however restricted to limit cycle solutions .",

    "<S> we present a dimension analysis of a set of solar type  i storms and type  iv events with different kind of fine structures , recorded at the trieste astronomical observatory . </S>",
    "<S> the signature of such types of solar radio events is highly structured in time . </S>",
    "<S> however , periodicities are rather seldom , and linear mode theory can provide only limited interpretation of the data . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we performed an analysis based on methods of the nonlinear dynamics theory .    additionally to the commonly used correlation dimension </S>",
    "<S> , we also calculated local pointwise dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> this alternative approach is motivated by the fact that astrophysical time series represent real - world systems , which can not be kept in a controlled state and which are highly interconnected with their surroundings . in such systems </S>",
    "<S> pure determinism is rather unlikely to be realized , and therefore a characterization by invariants of the dynamics might probably be inadequate .    </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the outcome of the dimension analysis does not give hints for low - dimensional determinism in the data , but we show that , contrary to the correlation dimension method , local dimension estimations can give physical insight into the events even in cases in which pure determinism can not be established . in particular , in most of the analyzed radio events nonlinearity in the data is detected , and the local dimension analysis provides a basis for a quantitative description of the time series , which can be used to characterize the complexity of the related physical system in a comparative and non - invariant manner .    </S>",
    "<S> in this frame , the degree of complexity we inferred for type  i storms is on the average lower than that relevant to type  iv events . for the type  iv events </S>",
    "<S> significant differences occur with regard to the various subtypes , whereas pulsations and sudden reductions can be described by distinctly lower values than spikes and fast pulsations . </S>"
