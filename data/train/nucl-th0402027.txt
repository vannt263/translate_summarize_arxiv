    "low  energy meson ",
    "nucleon reactions are of great theoretical interest for they are one of the best tools to deepen our understanding of the nuclear many - body problem .",
    "the production and scattering of the lightest member of the goldstone nonet , i.e. the pion , on nuclei is the subject of special experimental and theoretical interest since they allow to test predictions of chiral perturbation theory and  within this scheme  quantify the effect of isospin violation in the strong @xmath4 interaction .",
    "in addition , pion - nucleus reactions can be used to get information on the elementary pion  neutron interactions .",
    "detailed knowledge of the latter is important to fix the isoscalar pion ",
    "nucleon scattering length .",
    "the calculation of the production and scattering processes for heavier mesons on nuclei is more difficult but not less interesting .",
    "for instance , the reactions involving the @xmath5 meson can be used to explore the possibility of the formation of the @xmath5-nucleus bound state , whereas the @xmath6-scattering allows to extend our knowledge about the strange sector .",
    "it is well known that rescattering effects , where the intermediate meson being scattered on one nucleon of the nucleus then rescatters on another one , are potentially large and need to be evaluated in a controlled way in order to , for example , extract information on the the neutron amplitudes . how to do this within an effective field theory weinberg described in one of his classic papers @xcite .",
    "in this paper nucleons are treated rigorously as static , as long as the diagram is two  nucleon irreducible , leading to largely simplified nuclear matrix elements .",
    "this framework has been subsequently extended to higher orders and consistent wave functions based on chiral nuclear effective field theory have been used , see @xcite .    in this note",
    "we investigate under what circumstances the static approximation is justified and also identify reactions where the recoil corrections are to play a significant role . on the example of the calculation of the @xmath0 scattering length",
    "we show that cancellations amongst different one  body and two  body amplitudes have to occur in order to make the pauli principle also hold for two  nucleon states while there is a pion in flight simultaneously .",
    "similar arguments were recently presented by rekalo et al .",
    "@xcite for neutral pion photo- and electroproduction on the deuteron at low energies . however , these authors argue that in case of a pauli forbidden intermediate state the pion rescattering contribution has to be canceled completely in order to allow the nucleons to obey the pauli principle . in this paper",
    "we critically reexamine this claim .",
    "especially we find that it is not the full rescattering amplitude that vanishes in case of the pauli forbidden s - wave intermediate two  nucleon state , but only the part stemming from the nucleon recoils , leaving the static exchange as a good approximation to the full result . note that the interference pattern discussed was already observed numerically in the phenomenological approach of refs .",
    "in addition , we will show that , at least for @xmath0 scattering near threshold , for cases where the s - wave intermediate two ",
    "nucleon state is pauli allowed , the net effect of the ( then important ) recoil corrections is that the corresponding rescattering contributions ( i.e. the static term + the corrections occuring due to the finite nucleon mass ) are numerically irrelevant .    historically the presence of sizable cancellation in calculation for the @xmath0 scattering length was raised first in the papers by kolybasov et al .",
    "@xcite and independently by fldt @xcite where it was claimed that the naive static term is a good approximation for rescattering effects ( see also discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . however , the effect in ref .",
    "@xcite was traced to a quite unnatural numerical cancellation of the diagrams shown in fig .",
    "1 b ) and c ) with the corresponding diagrams where the intermediate nucleons are rescattered off each other .",
    "moreover in ref .",
    "@xcite rescattering effects are approximated by the static term for both types of the s - wave @xmath4-potential , i.e. for isoscalar and isovector .",
    "this is indeed correct for the isovector @xmath4-interaction but not for the isoscalar one as we will prove below . due to the smallness of the isoscalar @xmath4-scattering length",
    "the wrong interpretation of rescattering effects in this case does not affect the full result of the calculation of the @xmath0-scattering length , however , for other processes where this term is not small one would get the incorrect result .    note that arguments based on the pauli principle for the intermediate nucleons are very general and therefore can be applied for different processes with any intermediate meson exchanges",
    "several examples will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ results ] .",
    "to be concrete , this discussion will be carried out for the reaction @xmath7 and we will restrict ourselves to a rather simplified @xmath4 interaction that , however , allows us to address all relevant issues .    in fig .",
    "[ dia ] we show typical single nucleon diagrams a ) and b ) as well as the corresponding two  nucleon contribution c ) .",
    "we will concentrate on the isolation of the one  body ( isoscalar ) amplitude ( as it would be also measured in a @xmath4 scattering experiment or extracted from a partial - wave analysis ) from that related to nuclear effects .",
    "in general , two ",
    "nucleon states in any subsystem have to obey the pauli principle .",
    "thus , when looking at diagram c ) , where the relevant intermediate state is marked by a perpendicular line , the pauli principle demands the two nucleons to show a particular behavior under their exchange .",
    "however , if we would exchange the two nucleons in the intermediate state of diagram c ) we come automatically to diagram b ) .",
    "thus , we should expect some destructive interference between b ) and c ) if the intermediate state is forbidden by the pauli principle and a constructive one if the intermediate state is allowed .",
    "the interference pattern depends on the particular structure of the @xmath8 transition potential . at the threshold",
    "it may be written as ( the factor 1/@xmath9 was introduced for convenience since this way we will get results symmetric in @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) @xmath12 where the strength of the isoscalar ( isovector ) interaction is denoted by @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) is the isospin index of the initial ( final ) pion . for our study",
    "we assume both @xmath10 and @xmath11 as constant .",
    "the conclusions do not change by this simplification , but the formulas simplify largely .",
    "as was shown by weinberg @xcite , tomozawa @xcite and others , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 denotes the typical hadronic scale of order 1 gev and @xmath18 is the pion mass .",
    "thus , in @xmath0 scattering the isoscalar rescattering contribution is largely suppressed . however , for illustration we will keep both @xmath10 and @xmath11 in the calculation . lets us now analyze more closely the structure of the matrix element corresponding to diagram [ dia]c ) .",
    "the deuteron is an isoscalar .",
    "thus , when a scalar ( vector ) operator in isospin space operates on this state , the resulting two  nucleon state is in an isoscalar ( isovector ) state . at threshold the @xmath4 interaction is spin and momentum  independent and therefore the two  nucleon state after the @xmath4 interaction is in both scenarios in a spin triplet @xmath19wave state .",
    "the pauli principle allows this only for isoscalars and thus , if the @xmath4 interaction is given by the @xmath10 term , the contributions of diagrams c ) and b ) to the @xmath0 scattering length due to @xmath20 recoil should interfere constructively and , if it is given by the @xmath11 term , they should interfere destructively .    within our simplified model",
    "the @xmath0 scattering length is given by @xmath21 where the superscripts denote the isospin structure of the @xmath22-interaction and the subscripts refer to the diagrams as shown in fig .",
    "[ dia ] . since the deuteron is an isoscalar state , only @xmath10 contributes to diagram a ) , and we get @xmath23 we also give the expressions for diagram b ) @xmath24 and for diagram c ) @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the deuteron wave function and p ( q ) is the relative nucleon momentum before the @xmath4 interaction ( the intemediate pion momentum ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath27^{-1}$ ] , @xmath28 , with @xmath29 and @xmath30 for the deuteron binding energy and the pion energy , respectively , and @xmath31 is the nucleon mass . to come to these expressions terms of order @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) were dropped in the denominator ( numerator ) , since they lead only to the complication of the formulae but are irrelevant for this study .",
    "the piece linear in @xmath33 that appears in the denominators is the recoil correction of interest . in ref .",
    "@xcite as well as many multiple scattering formalisms ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) the structure given in eq .",
    "( [ rescat ] ) with @xmath34 is given for the rescattering contribution .",
    "however , when straightforwardly evaluated the inclusion of @xmath33 decreases the value of @xmath35 approximately by a factor of 2 @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite where the recoil corrections were estimated for the first time and found to be important ) .",
    "the reason for this relatively large effect of the recoil corrections on the amplitude is the proximity of a three  body singularity : the fact that for @xmath36 the intermediate states can become real leads to a contribution non  analytic in the nucleon mass that can not be simply dropped .",
    "the goal of our study is two - fold : we want to split the @xmath0 amplitude into its contribution from the @xmath4 amplitude and the nuclear corrections  the so  called rescattering contributions  and",
    "secondly we want to understand the role of the nucleon recoil in the latter .",
    "the former issue was previously addressed within chiral perturbation theory in refs .",
    "@xcite , but this separation is much more transparent in our simplified approach and thus allows to discuss the various contributions more directly .",
    "thus , after adding and subtracting appropriate terms , we decompose the expression for the @xmath0 scattering length in the following way @xmath37 here the one  body piece is given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 and a particular regularization prescription is to be given to render the loop integral finite ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . note that within our model the full expression given in eq .",
    "( [ 1bodydef ] ) is the expression for the isoscalar @xmath4 scattering length .",
    "it is therefore this piece that we need to isolate , if we want to extract single nucleon amplitudes from nuclear reactions .",
    "the rescattering contribution ( or nuclear corrections ) we split without any further approximations into the leading order static piece given in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath40 with @xmath41 and the corrections occuring due to the finite nucleon mass which are again separated on two parts , namely the 3body singularity correction ( or the recoil term ) which is not analytic in @xmath42 and the term @xmath43 which is regular in @xmath42 .",
    "these corrections can be expressed as @xmath44 with @xmath45 where we used the symmetry of @xmath46 to replace @xmath47 by @xmath48 and @xmath49 with @xmath50 note that @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath43 are finite .",
    "we numerically evaluated @xmath46 and @xmath53 using the deuteron wave functions from the bonn potential @xcite and found @xmath54 both given in units of @xmath53 .",
    "we checked that the numbers do not depend on the type of the deuteron wave function used .",
    "the results reflect the interference pattern discussed above , i.e. that the 3body correction due to the nucleon recoil is much smaller in the case when the s - wave @xmath20 intermediate state is forbidden by the pauli principle compared to that when it is allowed ( @xmath55 ) . to make it even more clear that the interference pattern in @xmath46 indeed reflects what is demanded by the pauli principle let us express the integrals explicitly in terms of the two  nucleon relative momentum , @xmath56 , for the @xmath20 intermediate state .",
    "then the first term of the integrant in eq .",
    "( [ idef ] ) reads @xmath57 for the upper ( lower ) sign this combination is symmetric ( antisymmetric ) under the transformation ] @xmath58 .",
    "thus , in case of @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) this term projects on the pauli allowed even ( odd ) two  nucleon spin triplet states in the @xmath61 intermediate state ",
    "a statement that holds for both the imaginary part as well as the real part !",
    "note also that the contributions of diagrams 1 b ) and c ) to the imaginary part of the @xmath0 scattering length ( e.g. due to charge exchange process ) can appear only from the recoil term , i.e. from @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) . in case of the calculation of the imaginary part of @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) one has to integrate over the momenta in the narrow region restricted by the 3body phase space , i.e. over the region where the contribution of the p - wave @xmath20 state is small .",
    "this leads to a rather small value of @xmath62 .",
    "we stress that @xmath59 is large and negative .",
    "therefore when adding the terms proportional to @xmath63 in @xmath64 and @xmath51 , they largely cancel .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath60 is much smaller than @xmath53 and therefore the nuclear contributions to the @xmath0 scattering amplitude proportional to @xmath65 are basically given by @xmath51 .",
    "thus , we find that if the s - wave two  nucleon intermediate state that occurs while the pion is in flight is allowed by the pauli principle , the net effect of the rescattering contribution is quite small .",
    "on the other hand , if the s - wave two  nucleon intermediate state is pauli forbidden , the rescattering effects are large , however , can be well approximated by a static exchange .",
    "the corrections to this are found to be of order @xmath66 of the static term .",
    "however , one should also not forget about the nlo correction to the static term .",
    "this correction is not related with the pauli principle and it is regular in @xmath67 . moreover , in distinction from the 3body recoil correction , which is only weakly dependent on the mass of the exchanged meson , the nlo correction to the static term linearly depends on the mass .",
    "it turned out that for the @xmath0 scattering the integral @xmath68 is equal to @xmath69 ( in the same units ) , thus making the conclusion about the role of rescattering effects presented above even stronger . indeed , this term interferes destructively with @xmath60 ( constructively with @xmath59 ) resulting in the total correction to the static term ( eq .",
    "( [ stat ] ) ) to be equal to @xmath70 thus , the total rescattering contribution is @xmath71 , i.e. it is basically negligible for the isoscalar part of the @xmath4 interaction and it almost equals to the static term for the isovector one .",
    "however , this particular cancellation seems to be specific to @xmath0 scattering and the result might be different for exchange mesons heavier than the pion .    as one might expect intuitively , pauli principle arguments do not apply to the static piece , for it describes the instantanous exchange of a pion that does not allow for any two  nucleon intermediate state . however , one comment is necessary at this place",
    ". it might be that there is still a potentially sizable cancellation between the terms proportional to @xmath65 in @xmath72 and @xmath73 , simply because these terms are of different signs .",
    "however , the goal of the present study is to properly isolate the one  body piece from the rescattering piece  this is the precondition to , for example , extract neutron amplitudes from deuteron observables .",
    "the isoscalar @xmath4 scattering length , however , is proportional to the full expression given in eq .",
    "( [ 1bodydef ] ) and not just its first term .",
    "as mentioned above , in reality the isovector @xmath4 interaction is significantly stronger than the isoscalar one in the near threshold regime .",
    "therefore , for this case we may drop all terms proportional to @xmath63 and find , that indeed the static approximation is justified to calculate the rescattering corrections .    the same kind of selection rules as discussed here for @xmath0 scattering obviously also apply to other meson  nucleus scattering reactions .",
    "the first example we will discuss here is coherent @xmath74 photo- and electroproduction on the deuteron . for this reaction",
    "the reasoning is basically identical .",
    "although the leading @xmath75 vertex of kroll  rudermann type contains both a spin and an isospin operator and thus can lead to the @xmath76 intermediate @xmath20 state , the rescattering vertices again are of the type given in eq .",
    "( [ pinpot ] ) . based on this observation in ref .",
    "@xcite it was concluded that the pauli principle leads to a vanishing of all rescattering contributions .",
    "however , given the discussion at the end of the previous section , we now understand that this conclusion is based on an improper separation of one  body and rescattering terms and indeed a static pion exchange is a good approximation for the leading rescattering contribution",
    ". therefore the quite elaborate calculations of neutral pion photo- and electroproduction based on chiral perturbation theory with static nucleons @xcite give accurate results .",
    "however , the picture changes when we look at incoherent pion production reactions like @xmath77 and for this reaction large effects from the recoils are to be expected . in this context",
    "it is interesting to note that the existing data for this reaction are well described by the one  body terms alone , however , the inclusion of rescattering contributions , estimated in the static approximation , lead to a visible deviation of the calculation from the data ( see the review @xcite and references therein ) . a possible solution to this",
    "is that the recoil corrections strongly diminish the rescattering piece , as discussed above , leaving the one  body piece as a good approximation to the full result .",
    "we will check this conjecture by an explicit calculation in a subsequent publication .",
    "another case of interest is @xmath5nucleus scattering .",
    "for example in a recent analysis of the world data set on @xmath78he indications were found that the imaginary part of the @xmath79he scattering length might be significantly smaller than three times the imaginary part of the elementary @xmath80 amplitude @xcite , contrary to what is expected from many multiple scattering approaches .",
    "given the findings of above , this should no longer come as a surprise : the @xmath3he wave function is dominated by a quasi ",
    "deuteron together with an additional proton in an @xmath81wave @xcite .",
    "in addition , the dominant piece of the @xmath82 transition amplitude close to the @xmath5threshold is spin and momentum  independent , for it is driven by the resonance @xmath83 , but is isospin  dependent .",
    "consequently , all the reasoning given above applies and to a good approximation the imarinary parts that originate from the one  body amplitudes have to be cancelled by those from the rescattering and therefore there is no connection between the imaginary part of the @xmath79he scattering length and that for @xmath80 scattering .",
    "in this letter , we have studied the role of recoil corrections in low  energy meson  nucleus reactions . in a simplified model of @xmath0 scattering ,",
    "we have shown how to separate the one  body contribution , that embodies the pertient information on the elementary pion - nucleon amplitude , from the rescattering ( two - body ) corrections , paying particular attention to the constraints from the pauli principle .",
    "our results are opposite to those of ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was argued that rescattering contributions are negligible when pauli forbidden intermediate states occur whereas they are large for pauli allowed states .",
    "the difference was traced to an improper separation of one  body and nuclear contributions in ref .",
    "our findings indicate , that , if the s - wave @xmath20 intermediate state is pauli forbidden , the static meson exchange is a good approximation to the full amplitude , whereas in case of the pauli allowed s - wave intermediate state the ( then significant ) recoil corrections strongly suppress the nuclear corrections . in this paper",
    "the consequences of these insights for other reactions were discussed .",
