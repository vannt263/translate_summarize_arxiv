    "the fundamental property of the squeezed state is that the quantum fluctuations in one quadrature component of the field can be reduced heavily .",
    "followed the early works @xcite , much attention has been given to this specific state .",
    "the first experimental result for the generation of the squeezed state was reported by slusher _",
    "et al_.@xcite with the scheme of 4-wave mixing in an optical cavity .",
    "currently a successful scheme for generating squeezed light can also be based on a parametric oscillator or parametric down converter @xcite .",
    "recently , due to its potential applications in the fields of quantum measurement , optical communication , and quantum information , the squeezed vacuum state has been extensively studied @xcite .",
    "a natural problem is what effect on physical systems can be induced by the squeezed vacuum .",
    "the squeezed light field will generally be characterized as a non - stationary reservoir which contains phase dependent features in the correlation function between pairs of photons .",
    "when the bandwidths of the squeezed lights are not too small , they can be treated as markovian reservoirs , and the master equations of the reduced system can be obtained based on markovian approximation .",
    "master equations are of fundamental importance in the treatment of dissipation and decoherence of open quantum systems .",
    "the common feature of the quantum master equations is the existence of the sandwich terms of the liouville operators where the reduced density matrix of the system is in between some quantum excitation and de - excitation operators .",
    "so it is very difficult to get the exact analytical solution of the master equation , only simple cases such as a single mode of cavity field coupled to a vacuum state reservoir ( @xmath0 ) or stationary regime properties are the ones analytically treated @xcite .",
    "instead , the master equations are normally converted into c - number equations in the coherent state representation  the fokker - planck equation @xcite . on the other hand , with the development of the so called quantum engineering , the man - made nonautonomous quantum systems where the system parameters set by people for controlling of the system are time - dependent ,",
    "become more and more important .",
    "it would be very desirable to get the analytical solution of the corresponding master equation of such a system .",
    "further , even if the total hamiltonian of an open system - a system plus an environment , is time - independent , the master equation of the reduced density matrix of the investigated system still becomes nonautonomous under the non - markovian dynamics @xcite .",
    "therefore , quantum master equation of the reduced density matrix , in general , should be nonautonomous .    in the previous works @xcite , we have proposed and developed an algebraic method to treat the sandwich terms in the liouville operator for the nonequilibrium quantum process .",
    "this method is just a generalization of the algebraic dynamical method @xcite from quantum mechanical systems to quantum statistical ones . according to the characteristic of the sandwich terms in the liouville operator ,",
    "the left and right representations @xcite of the relevant algebra have been introduced and the corresponding composite algebra has been constructed . as a result , the master equation has been converted into a schrdinger - like equation and the problems can be solved exactly in the framework of algebraic dynamics .",
    "this method is very effective to treat the nonautonomous quantum system which contains time - dependent parameters for control of the system .    in this paper , using the algebraic dynamical method , we shall solve the problem of two - level atom interacting with the squeezed vacuum field reservoir and investigate what effect on the system can be induced by the squeezed vacuum field reservoir .",
    "as is well known , when the environment is ordinary thermal equilibrium fields , the model , either be autonomous or be nonautonomous , has been investigated very well @xcite . when the environment is the squeezed vacuum field ,",
    "some work have been done on this field @xcite .",
    "different to ref .",
    "@xcite , where two - level atoms with a time - dependent external classical driven field in the squeezed vacuum field reservoir were investigated , in this paper , we will concentrate on the behavior of a two - level atom in a time - dependent squeezed vacuum field reservoir . with the help of the algebraic dynamical method , the @xmath1 dynamical symmetry of the nonautonomous master equation for the two - level atom is found .",
    "the analytical solutions , both the steady solutions and the time - dependent solutions of the system are obtained exactly , and the decay property of the atom is investigated . for the asymptotic behavior of the system , it is proven that any time - dependent solution of the system approaches its unique steady equilibrium solution .",
    "based on the analytical solution , the different response behaviors of the system to the time - dependent squeezing parameter @xmath2 , linear and nonlinear , are investigated numerically .",
    "we noticed that in the nonlinear response regime , the expectation of one of the squeezed components of the system , @xmath3 , is much enhanced , and the squeezed property of the system , i.e. , the asymmetry of the decay of the expectation of @xmath4 and @xmath3 , can also be manifested even when the initial values of @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) are zero .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , the model hamiltonian of the system is presented and the master equation for the reduced matrix of the atom is deduced . in section iii , the dynamical @xmath7 algebraic structure of the liouville operator of the master equation is found and the dynamical symmetry of the system is thus exposed .",
    "section iv is devoted to obtain the analytical non - equilibrium solution of the nonautonomous master equation , and the approach to the unique steady equilibrium solution asymptotically is proved . in section",
    "v , numerical results are presented for illustration of non - equilibrium process of some physical quantities .",
    "discussions and conclusions are given in the final section .",
    "the hamiltonian of a two - level atom interacting with a squeezed vacuum field reservoir is @xmath8since the squeezed vacuum field reservoir is kept fixed , the total density operator of the system can be written as @xcite@xmath9 is the squeezing operator and reads as@xmath10with @xmath11 and @xmath12 , @xmath2 being the squeezing parameter and @xmath13 being the reference phase for the squeezed field .",
    "then the master equation for the reduced density matrix @xmath14  of the atom interacting with the squeezed vacuum reservoir can be obtained with the standard markovian approximation scu , @xmath15where @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is very large .",
    "here we have assumed that the vacuum field reservoir is the ideal squeezed one , that is , @xmath19 .",
    "when @xmath20 , @xmath21 , the master equation ( [ tlmaster ] ) reduces to the familiar form of the master equation @xcite describing an two - level atom coupling to the ordinary thermal equilibrium radiation field .",
    "the last two terms of the above equation exhibit the phase - sensitive nature of the investigated system .",

    "the new results of our paper compared to the previous ones are : ( 1 ) the dynamical symmetry of the nonautonomous master equation has been established and the master equation has been converted into a schrdinger - like equation . based on the dynamical symmetry we have obtained the most general non - equilibrium solutions of the nonautonomous master equation analytically ; and as a special case , our solutions recover all the results of the autonomous case .",
    "( 2 ) we have proven that any time - dependent and non - equilibrium solution of the nonautonomous master equation approaches its unique steady equilibrium solution asymptotically . ( 3 ) the non - equilibrium solution of the nonautonomous master equation is analysed numerically and the different response behaviors of the system to the squeezing parameter is exposed , and nonlinear effect is exhibited .",
    "the works of dissipative system combined with the research of control theory were extended in some publications @xcite , how to connect our approach with this investigate is a interesting and challenge problem .",
