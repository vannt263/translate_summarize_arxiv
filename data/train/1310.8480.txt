    "* lemma 2.1 ) .",
    "it is convenient to extend the domain of @xmath21 to @xmath22 and so we let @xmath23 for @xmath24 . here",
    "the pressure is defined without the need for a limit as the determinant is multiplicative .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath21 is continuous on @xmath22 and convex on each interval @xmath25 , with @xmath26 , and on @xmath27 .",
    "moreover , it is easy to contruct examples where the pressure is not convex on an interval containing an integer ; see section [ examplessection ] .",
    "it is a simple consequence of piecewise convexity that @xmath21 is differentiable at all but at most countably many points and semi - differentiable everywhere .",
    "the main focus of this article is to study real analyticity of the pressure and our main application is that the pressure is always piecewise real analytic for products of matrices which are simultaneously triangularisable , see corollaries [ mainanalytic ] and [ mainanalytictri ] .",
    "moreover , the number of phase transitions , and therefore points where the pressure is not smooth , can be bounded in terms of the spatial dimension and the number of matrices .",
    "we also provide examples showing that the pressure can have phase transitions at non - integer values .",
    "phase transitions in the interval @xmath28 have previously been exhibited by kenmki and vilppolainen ( * ? ? ?",
    "* example 6.5 ) .",
    "+   + we say a real valued function on some domain @xmath29 is _ piecewise real analytic _ if @xmath30 can be written as the closure of the union of a finite collection of open ( possibly unbounded ) intervals with the function being real analytic on each interval .",
    "the boundary points of the open intervals which are in the interior of @xmath30 are called _ phase transitions _ , provided that the function is not real analytic on any neighbourhood of the point .",
    "note that if a piecewise real analytic function is continuous , then it is completely defined by its values on the open intervals where it is real analytic .",
    "+   + one of the main applications of the subadditive pressure function discussed in this paper is in the study of self - affine fractals . in particular ,",
    "if the matrices @xmath31 are chosen to be contractions and to each matrix we associate a translation vector @xmath32 , then we have an iterated function system @xmath33 , which has a unique non - empty compact attractor @xmath34 , called the self - affine set for the system . alternatively ,",
    "assuming some separation conditions , one can view @xmath34 as the repeller of a uniformly expanding map defined by the inverse branches of the contraction mappings . in either case",
    ", the pressure is related to many interesting geometric properties of @xmath34 and the associated dynamical system .",
    "perhaps most notably the unique zero of the pressure gives an upper bound for the hausdorff dimension of @xmath34 and a ` best guess ' for the actual hausdorff dimension .",
    "these ideas date back to douady - oesterl @xcite and falconer @xcite . in @xcite falconer",
    "proved that the zero of the pressure gives the hausdorff dimension of @xmath34 for lebesgue almost all choices of @xmath35 provided the matrices all have singular values strictly less than @xmath36 , which was relaxed to the optimal constant @xmath37 by solomyak @xcite .",
    "since then the subadditive pressure , and several related functions , have received a lot of attention in the literature on self - affine fractals and non - conformal dynamics .",
    "there have also been several extensions of these ideas to nonlinear systems , see falconer @xcite and barreira @xcite . due to their focus on upper triangular systems ,",
    "the papers of falconer - miao @xcite , falconer - lammering @xcite , manning - simon @xcite and brny @xcite are particularly relevant to our study .",
    "+   + it is worth remarking that _ additive pressure functions _ associated to uniformly hyperbolic dynamical systems and self - conformal fractals were studied before the more complicated subadditive analogues , see @xcite .",
    "the additive setting is rather simpler and if the associated potential is taken to be the appropriate analogue of the singular value function , then the pressure is real analytic on its whole domain .",
    "this is a special case of a more general result of ruelle @xcite .",
    "the proof relies on a transfer operator approach , which does not apply in the non - conformal ( or self - affine ) setting .",
    "+   + one of the reasons the analyticity ( or differentiability ) of the pressure is interesting is that it is related to the number of ergodic equilibrium measures for the pressure ( this was drawn to our attention by pablo shmerkin ) .",
    "indeed such links have been investigated by feng - kenmki @xcite and guivarch - le page @xcite , albeit in a slightly different context .",
    "suppose the matrices @xmath1 are all diagonal and write @xmath38 for the absolute values of the diagonal entries of @xmath39 .",
    "note that the sets @xmath40 and @xmath41 are equal but one can not say anything about the relative ordering .",
    "indeed , once one starts composing diagonal matrices , the order in which the singular values appear down the main diagonal of the matrix can change , which is one of the main difficulties in computing the pressure . for @xmath42 write @xmath43 for the diagonal entries of @xmath8 , noting that @xmath44 for each @xmath45 .",
    "let @xmath46 be the symmetric group on @xmath47 and for each @xmath48 and @xmath11 we define the _ @xmath49-ordered singular value function _ @xmath50 by @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the unique non - negative integer satisfying @xmath15 .",
    "the key advantage of these ordered singular value functions is that they are multiplicative in @xmath18 instead of only submultiplicative , i.e. @xmath53 for all @xmath20 and @xmath48 .",
    "this allows us to define the associated pressure by means of a closed form expression , without taking a limit .",
    "more precisely , we define the _",
    "@xmath49-ordered pressure _ @xmath54 by @xmath55 and observe that @xmath56 for all @xmath57 .",
    "we extend the domain of each @xmath58 to @xmath22 as before by setting @xmath59 for @xmath24 , since the ordering of the diagonal entries of a diagonal matrix does not change the determinant .",
    "again , it is easy to see that @xmath58 is continuous on @xmath22 and convex on each interval @xmath25 , with @xmath26 , and on @xmath27 .",
    "moreover , it is immediate that @xmath58 is piecewise real analytic , with the only possible phase transitions occurring at the points @xmath47 .",
    "[ mainmax ] for all @xmath60 we have @xmath61    we will prove theorem [ mainmax ] in section [ mainmaxproof ] . in the case of @xmath62 matrices , where the pressure is the maximum of two functions ,",
    "this can be found in @xcite .",
    "in fact @xcite dealt with certain nonlinear maps corresponding to upper triangular matrices .",
    "the key point of this result is that we have a closed form expression for the pressure , which is very useful for computational purposes and for analysing differentiability and analyticity , since differentiating a function defined by a limit is awkward .",
    "first and foremost , by identifying phase transitions in the pressure with zeros of dirichlet polynomials , we can deduce the following result .",
    "[ mainanalytic ] for products of non - singular diagonal matrices , the pressure is piecewise real analytic",
    ".    we will prove corollary [ mainanalytic ] in section [ mainanalyticproof ] .",
    "we are able to bound the number of phase transitions ( and therefore the number of ` pieces ' in the piecewise decomposition of @xmath21 ) in terms of the number of matrices @xmath63 and the spatial dimension @xmath64 , however we defer discussion of the explicit bound until sections [ mainanalyticproof ] and [ questions ] .",
    "it is now possible to give various sufficient conditions for @xmath21 to be real analytic on the whole interval @xmath25 , however , we refrain from stating a myriad of different examples because in practice one would simply plot the different ordered pressures and observe which is the maximum . then on any interval where one ordered pressure is bigger than or equal to all the others , @xmath21 is real analytic .",
    "however , we do state one sufficiency result which we find particularly intuitive .",
    "[ mainanal ] let @xmath14 .",
    "if there exists @xmath48 such that for all @xmath65 @xmath66 and @xmath67 then @xmath68 for all @xmath69 $ ] and , in particular , the pressure is real analytic on @xmath25",
    ".    we will prove corollary [ mainanal ] in section [ mainanalproof ] .",
    "notice that ( especially for large @xmath70 ) the sufficient condition for analyticity given above is weaker than requiring @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "however , in that more restrictive setting , we get the following precise corollary .    if there exists @xmath48 such that for all @xmath65 and @xmath45 @xmath75 then @xmath68 for all @xmath60 and , in particular , the pressure is real analytic on each interval @xmath25 with @xmath14 .    in light of theorem [ mainmax ] , non - trivial phase transitions ,",
    "i.e. , phase transitions occurring at non - integer values , can only happen at points when the maximum of the ordered pressures ` changes hands ' between two different ordered pressures .",
    "it is not immediately obvious that this is possible , but it does not take long to find such examples .",
    "we will present some examples of non - trivial phase transitions in section [ examplessection ] , as well as a simple example where corollary [ mainanal ] can be applied to certain intervals .",
    "+   + we conclude this section with the combinatorial observation that , despite there being @xmath76 different ordered pressures , there are significantly fewer distinct ones . in particular , we choose the first @xmath70 entries in the ordered singular value functions , with the ordering irrelevant , and then choose the @xmath77th entry from the remaining @xmath78 choices .",
    "as such , if we are interested in analysing the pressure in the interval @xmath79 , for some @xmath14 , then we have to take the maximum of @xmath80 ( possibly ) distinct functions .",
    "in this section assume that @xmath1 are all contracting upper triangular matrices and as before write @xmath81 for the absolute values of the diagonal entries of @xmath39 .",
    "an interesting , and perhaps surprising result , of falconer and miao @xcite is that the pressure in this setting only depends on the diagonal entries . moreover , they gave a closed form expression for the pressure in the interval @xmath79 for @xmath14 as the maximum of functions of the form @xmath82 over all independent choices of subsets @xmath83 and @xmath84 of @xmath85 , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.5 ) .",
    "in particular , in the interval @xmath79 , one takes the maximum of @xmath86 functions . for related results",
    "see @xcite .",
    "since the pressure does not depend on the non - diagonal entries of the matrices , we can apply theorem [ mainmax ] also in the upper triangular setting , simply by ignoring the non - diagonal entries .",
    "as such and in view of ( [ numberof ] ) we can reduce the number of functions needed in the interval @xmath79 by a factor of @xmath87 which grows exponentially in @xmath64 in the central intervals .",
    "more precisely , applying stirling s formula , the above factor is larger than @xmath88 for @xmath89 and choosing @xmath70 to be the integer part of @xmath90 .",
    "the rest of the results in the previous section carry over to the upper triangular case , or indeed any set of matrices which are simultaneously triangularisable , i.e. there exists a basis with respect to which all of the matrices are either upper or lower triangular .",
    "most notably we have the following general result .",
    "[ mainanalytictri ] for products of contracting non - singular simultaneously triangularisable matrices , the pressure is piecewise real analytic .",
    "let @xmath91 and let @xmath92 and @xmath93 be @xmath94 upper triangular matrices with non - zero positive diagonal entries @xmath95 and @xmath96 respectively . theorem [ mainmax ] and ( [ numberof ] ) show that the pressure corresponding to this system is given by the maximum of three functions in the interval @xmath97 , six functions in the interval @xmath98 and three functions in the interval @xmath99 . by choosing the diagonal entries appropriately , we can create a phase transition in each of these intervals .",
    "choosing @xmath100 gives the pressure a phase transition at the point @xmath101 with @xmath102 .",
    "choosing @xmath103 gives the pressure a phase transition at a point @xmath104 with @xmath105 .",
    "finally , choosing @xmath106 gives the pressure a phase transition at a point @xmath107 with @xmath108 .",
    "$ ] for each of the three examples described above .",
    "the permutations ( written as cycles ) corresponding to each colour are as follows : black : ( 1 ) , blue : ( 23 ) , green : ( 12 ) , red : ( 132 ) , pink : ( 123 ) , yellow : ( 13 ) .",

    "[ lemma1 ] for all @xmath11 and @xmath115 , we have @xmath116 .",
    "let @xmath117 and suppose @xmath118 for some @xmath26 .",
    "clearly @xmath119 is equal to @xmath120 for some @xmath49 and so @xmath121 .",
    "also , in trying to maximise @xmath120 over @xmath49 , one must choose a permutation for which @xmath122 i.e. a permutation which ` uses ' the largest @xmath77 singular values and excludes the other ( smaller ) values .",
    "fix such a permutation @xmath49 .",
    "since @xmath120 is symmetric in the values @xmath123 , the ordering of the first @xmath70 terms is irrelevant , and so the only question is which singular value to choose as @xmath124 .",
    "suppose @xmath49 is such that @xmath125 .",
    "cancelling common terms we have @xmath126 since @xmath127 and @xmath128 , which gives @xmath129 and completes the proof .",
    "[ lemma2 ] for all @xmath11 , we have @xmath130    observe that by lemma [ lemma1 ] @xmath131 since the ordered singular value functions are multiplicative .",
    "this yields the left hand inequality in the statement of the lemma . to obtain the right hand inequality ,",
    "observe that @xmath132 for some @xmath49 and so @xmath133 again using multiplicativity of the ordered singular value functions .",
    "theorem [ mainmax ] now follows easily by applying lemma [ lemma2 ] to obtain @xmath134 and @xmath135      to prove that @xmath21 is piecewise real analytic it suffices to show that for a given @xmath14 and two given permutations @xmath136 , if the ordered pressures @xmath58 and @xmath137 are not equal on the entire interval @xmath25 , then their graphs can only intersect a finite number of times .",
    "this is equivalent to showing that the function @xmath138 has at most finitely many zeros in the interval @xmath25 , assuming it is not identically zero .",
    "however , this is quickly seen to be true since @xmath139 is a ( generalised ) dirichlet polynomial and therefore can have at most @xmath140 zeros in @xmath141 . recall that dirichlet polynomials are functions of the form @xmath142 with @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "a classical result , which can be proved by applying rolle s theorem , is that such functions have at most @xmath145 zeros , provided they are not identically zero . for further information on zeros of dirichlet polynomials and related topics ,",
    "see jameson @xcite .",
    "+   + if we are interested in bounding the number of phase transitions explicitly , then the following crude estimate can be deduced .",
    "we can have trivial phase transitions at the points @xmath47 .",
    "for non - trivial phase transitions in the interval @xmath25 for @xmath14 , we know that each distinct pair of ordered pressures can give rise to at most @xmath140 phase transitions by the above argument and using ( [ numberof ] ) there are at most @xmath146 distinct pairs of ordered pressures .",
    "this yields the following upper bound for the total number of phase transitions : @xmath147 we can simplify the summation as follows : @xmath148 as @xmath149 , where the final line giving the asymptotic value was obtained by applying stirling s formula to the binomial coefficient .",

    "we have proved that the pressure is piecewise real analytic for products of diagonal matrices and simultaneously triangularisable matrices . however , this falls significantly short of proving this in general and we therefore ask the following question .      in our setting",
    "we can bound the number of phase transitions by @xmath153 however , this is very crude . for a fixed spatial dimension ,",
    "( [ boundd ] ) grows linearly in the number of matrices , which seems reasonable , but for a fixed number of matrices it grows as @xmath154 as the spatial dimension @xmath149 , which seems far too fast and gives poor estimates .",
    "for example , for 2 matrices in dimension 5 the explicit bound is 2510",
    ". it would be interesting to search for optimal bounds or to just improve ( [ boundd ] ) .",
    "it would certainly be possible to reduce the bound ( [ boundd ] ) via a more careful application of rolle s theorem or descartes rule of signs , to the dirichlet polynomial @xmath139 , but we omit further details .",
    "we emphasise that the purpose of this paper is to prove piecewise analyticity and not to study combinatorial issues concerning the sharpness of the bound on the possible number of phase transitions .",
    "another possible problem to consider is the existence and nature of _ higher order phase transitions _ , i.e. points for which the pressure is @xmath155 but not @xmath156 for some @xmath157 .",
    "we have only been able to exhibit 0th order phase transitions , i.e. points where the pressure is continuous but not differentiable .",
    "since our main result gives an explicit formula for the pressure , it should provide a useful tool in searching for higher order phase transitions , but we have not pursed this here .",
