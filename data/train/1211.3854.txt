    "capillarity is one of the most interesting subjects to teach in condensed matter physics , as its detailed understanding involves three otherwise separated domains : macroscopic thermodynamics@xcite , fluid mechanics and statistical physics@xcite .",
    "the microscopic origin of surface tension lies in the intermolecular interactions and thermal effects@xcite , while macroscopically it can be seen as a force acting along the interface or an energy per unit surface . in the present article",
    "we discuss the link between these three aspects of capillarity , on the basis of simple academic examples .",
    "we first discuss the standard problems faced by students   and many researchers   in the understanding of surface tension .",
    "we will see that the difficulty of understanding surface tension forces is often caused by the improper or incomplete definition of a system on which the forces act .",
    "we bring up four basic questions , such as the one raised in the title , which are answered in the rest of the article .",
    "contrary to many textbooks on the subject , this provides a picture that reconciles the microscopic , thermodynamic and mechanical aspects of capillarity .        following the pioneering work of gibbs@xcite , we introduce surface tension as the excess free energy due to the presence of an interface between bulk phases .",
    "let us consider a molecule in the vicinity of an interface , for example near a liquid - vapor interface .",
    "the environment of this molecule is manifestly different from the molecules in the bulk .",
    "this is usually represented schematically by drawing the attractive bonds around molecules , as shown in fig .",
    "[ missingbounds ] .",
    "one clearly sees from this picture that approximately half of the bonds are missing for a molecule at the interface , leading to an increase of the free energy .",
    "one thus defines the surface tension from the free energy @xmath0 per unit area : @xmath1 for a system of volume @xmath2 containing @xmath3 molecules at temperature @xmath4 .",
    "hence , @xmath5 is the energy needed to increase the interfacial area by one unit .",

    "it is instructive to estimate the magnitude of surface tension , which must be of the order of the bond energy @xmath9 divided by the cross section area @xmath10 of a molecule ",

    "this gives rise to an increase in free energy per unit area , i.e. the surface tension . ]      in fluid mechanics , the surface tension is not defined in terms of a surface energy but rather as a force per unit length . in the bulk of a fluid at rest ,",
    "two sub - parts of a fluid exert a repulsive interaction on one another , which is called the pressure .",
    "if the surface separating these two subsystems crosses the liquid - vapor interface , an additional force needs to be taken into account : surface tension . as shown in fig .",
    "[ forcepicture ] , the surface tension is a force tangent to the surface and normal to the contour separating the two subsystems .",
    "the total force is proportional to the width of the contour , which we will call @xmath17 throughout the paper .",

    "the force is parallel to the interface and perpendicular to the dividing line .",
    "]    the link between mechanics and thermodynamics is provided by the virtual work principle .",
    "if one moves a contour of width @xmath17 by a length @xmath18 , the area of the interface of the subsystem considered increases by @xmath19 .",
    "consequently , the free energy is increased by @xmath20 .",
    "the free energy should equal the work done by the surface tension force , which means that this force must be parallel to the interface , normal to the contour and have a magnitude @xmath21 . per unit length ,",
    "the tension force is thus @xmath5 .    on the other hand ,",
    "the link between mechanics and statistical physics is much less obvious for students .",

    "[ missingbounds ] that the molecule at the interface is submitted to a net force ( which would be represented by the sum of the vectors ) along the direction perpendicular to the interface .",
    "however , we just argued from the mechanical point of view , that the force is _ parallel _ to the interface .",
    "this leads to the first key question of this article : + _ @xmath22 q1 : why is surface tension a force parallel to the interface while it is so obvious that it must be perpendicular to it ? _        a standard experimental method for determining the liquid - vapor surface tension is to measure the force required to pull a metallic plate ( usually made of platinum ) out of a liquid bath .",
    "this force is related to the liquid - vapor surface tension @xmath5 , as is usually explained by the diagram of fig .",
    "[ young]a .",
    "imagine that the plate is moved vertically by a distance @xmath18 .",
    "the area of the liquid - vapor interface does not change by this motion , so the corresponding interfacial energy is unaffected .",
    "however , the motion does lead to a decrease of the immersed solid - liquid interface area , by @xmath23 , while the solid - vapor interface increases by the same amount .",
    "in other words , part of the wetted surface is exchanged for dry surface .",
    "this leads to a variation of the free energy @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the solid - vapor and solid - liquid surface tensions respectively .",
    "this energy is provided by the work done by the experimentalist , due to the force required to displace the plate by @xmath18 .",
    "hence , this force must be equal to @xmath27 .",
    "( a ) experimental method to determine the liquid - vapor surface tension .",
    "the force per unit length needed to pull a plate from a bath of liquid is equal to @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the equilibrium contact angle .",
    "( b ) a classical way to interpret young s law as a force balance of surface tensions . question 2 : why is there no force balance in the normal direction ?",

    "when the three interfaces ( between solid , liquid and vapor ) join at the contact line , the liquid makes contact with the substrate at an angle @xmath29 given by@xcite : @xmath31 with this , the force exerted on the plate can be expressed as @xmath32 , and can thus be used to design a tensiometer .      from the mechanical point of view , we can interpret this force as the surface tension acting parallel to the liquid - vapor interface . by symmetry ,",
    "the total force exerted on the solid is vertical ( the horizontal components add up to zero ) . projecting the surface tension force on the vertical direction and multiplying by the length @xmath17 of the contact line , one indeed gets @xmath33 .    by",
    "a similar argument one usually interprets young s law for the contact angle as the balance of forces at the contact line ( fig .",
    "[ young]b ) . by projection along the direction parallel to the solid substrate , one obtains @xmath34 , which is the same as equation  ( [ young ] ) .",
    "this force interpretation is a common source of confusion for students : + _ @xmath22 q2 : from fig .",
    "[ young]b , there seems to be an unbalanced force component in the vertical direction @xmath35 .",
    "what force is missing to achieve equilibrium ? _ + _ @xmath22 q3 : why does one draw a single force acting on the contact line in the case of the plate ( fig .",
    "[ young]a ) , while for young s law we need to balance all three forces ( fig .",
    "[ young]b ) ? _",
    "actually , when measuring a surface tension using the plate technique , one often uses a platinum plate to be sure that the liquid completely wets the solid . in that case , however , @xmath36 and young s law does not apply ! then , the thermodynamic and mechanical approaches give conflicting answers : + _",
    "@xmath22 q4 : in the situation of complete wetting , is the force on the plate given by @xmath5 or by @xmath37 ? _      before addressing these points in detail , we start with a short overview of the answers to the questions raised above .",
    "we emphasize that the thermodynamic result ( i.e. from the virtual work principle ) always gives the correct total force . if one wants to know the _ local _ force distribution , which can not be extracted from thermodynamics , it is imperative that the system on which the forces act is properly defined .",
    "confusion regarding the forces is often caused by an improper or incomplete definition of such a system .",
    "@xmath22 a1 : the schematic of fig .  [ missingbounds ] represents only the attractive intermolecular forces .",
    "the real force balance requires both repulsive and attractive interactions between liquid molecules .",
    "_    to answer the questions related to the contact line it is crucial to specify the system of molecules on which the forces are acting : + _ @xmath22 a2 : in young s law , the system _ on which the forces act _ is a corner of liquid bounded by the contact line .",

    "the interaction is strongly repulsive for intermolecular distances @xmath42 , where @xmath11 reflects the ` hard - core ' of the molecules . at large distances the molecules",
    "are attracted to one another .",
    "the gray arrow points to the presence of thermal fluctuations , which , in a liquid , lead to substantial variations of the intermolecular distance . ]    to address the origin of capillarity , we first have to understand how a liquid phase and a vapor phase can coexist .",
    "this goes back to the work of van der waals who derived an equation of state for fluids that can account for a liquid - gas phase transition@xcite : @xmath43 here @xmath44 is the pressure , @xmath45 the volume per molecule , and @xmath4 the temperature .",
    "this equation of state corrects the ideal gas law to incorporate the effect of intermolecular forces .",
    "the constant @xmath46 introduces repulsion between molecules as an excluded volume effect : the pressure diverges when the total volume per molecule reaches a minimal size @xmath46 . in this limit the molecules are densely packed and constitute a liquid phase . in this phase , the volume per molecule no longer depends on pressure , which means that the liquid phase is incompressible .",
    "ultimately , this effect comes from the repulsion of the electron clouds of the molecules , due to pauli exclusion principle in quantum mechanics .",
    "the constant @xmath47 represents the long - range attraction between molecules which finds its origin in the dipole - dipole interaction ( van der waals attraction ) .",
    "van der waals s equation of state ( [ vdw ] ) explains how a low density gas phase can coexist with a high density liquid phase .",
    "this coexistence requires the pressures to be identical on both sides of the interface , despite the striking difference in density . in a gas , where @xmath48 is large ,",
    "most of the energy is of kinetic origin ( @xmath49 ) : the pressure is @xmath50 . in the liquid phase the volume per unit molecule is almost in the incompressible limit : @xmath51",
    "this strong repulsive effect ( @xmath52 ) , however , is counterbalanced by the presence of attractions ( @xmath53 ) so that , for the same temperature , the pressure in the liquid phase can be in equilibrium with the pressure in the gas phase .",
    "this gives rise to a stable liquid - vapor interface .",
    "how can a liquid at the same time be repulsive and attractive ?",
    "a single pair of atoms can of course only attract or repel each other , depending on the distance separating their two nuclei .",
    "this interaction is shown schematically in fig .",
    "the steep potential reflects the short - range repulsion , while the negative tail of the potential represents the long - range attraction .",
    "this means that the balance of attractive and repulsive interactions in ( [ vdw ] ) only has a statistical meaning : some particles are in an attractive state while others are in a repulsive state .",
    "this property of ` simultaneous ' repulsion and attraction is what makes a liquid very different from a solid : in an elastic solid , molecules in the same region are either all compressed ( if the solid is submitted to an external compression ) , or all attracted to each other ( if the solid is submitted to an external tension ) . this point is briefly discussed in the appendix .    the difference between a solid and a liquid can be traced back to the importance of thermal fluctuations , i.e. the kinetic energy of the molecules . in the solid phase ,",
    "these fluctuations are relatively small with respect to the potential energy , i.e. @xmath54 , where @xmath9 is the energy scale for the intermolecular forces . as a consequence the system only explores a small region of the potential . hence the solid is either in the compressed or in the tensile state . on the other hand ,",
    "the liquid phase is characterized by large fluctuations , for which @xmath55 . a broad range of the potential is therefore sampled by molecules in the same region of space ( fig .  [ lj ] ) .",
    "finally , the case @xmath56 corresponds to a gas phase of weakly interacting particles that is dominated by kinetic energy .         the liquid - vapor interface .",
    "the vertical axis is in units of the molecular scale @xmath11 .",

    "( b ) time - averaged normalized density profile @xmath57 across the interface .",
    "( c ) tangential force per unit area exerted by the left part on the right part of the system . technically speaking ,",
    "the plot shows the difference @xmath58 between the normal and tangential components of the stress tensor . ]",
    "let us now consider the liquid - vapor interface in more detail .",
    "figure  [ liquidvapor]a shows a snapshot of the interface obtained in molecular dynamics simulations of molecules that interact through a lennard - jones potential  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding time - averaged density profile is plotted in fig .",
    "[ liquidvapor]b .",
    "the transition from the high density liquid to the low density gas takes place in a very narrow region that is a few molecules wide . in order to determine the capillary forces we need to divide the system along the direction normal to the interface into two subsystems ( see fig . [ liquidvapor]a ) .",
    "one considers the force per unit area , called the stress , exerted by the left subsystem on the right subsystem as a function of the vertical position @xmath59 .",
    "this stress can be decomposed into two contributions : the pressure @xmath44 , which we recall to be the same in the vapor and the liquid bulk , plus an extra stress @xmath60 acting along the direction parallel to the interface , plotted in fig .",
    "[ liquidvapor]c .",
    "the profile of this stress anisotropy shows that there is a force localized at the interface , acting in the direction parallel to the interface .",
    "this force spreads over a few molecular scales , which is also the typical thickness of the density jump across the interface .",
    "the integrated contribution of this force is indeed equal to @xmath5 per unit length , the surface tension .",
    "this shows that surface tension really is a mechanical force .",
    "having seen that in our simulations there is a parallel force localized at the interface , let us turn to question 1 .",
    "why is the tension force parallel and not normal to the interface ?",
    "first , we note that fig .",
    "[ missingbounds ] only depicts the attraction between molecules .",
    "a more complete picture also incorporates the repulsive forces in the internal pressure , as sketched as dashed arrows in fig .",
    "[ missingboundscorrect ] . away from the surface",
    "there is perfect force balance due to the symmetry around the molecule . near the interface ,",
    "however , the up - down symmetry is broken . to restore the force balance in the vertical direction , the upward repulsive arrow ( dashed ) has to balance with the downward attractive arrow ( solid ) . in the direction parallel to the interface",
    "the symmetry is still intact , thus automatically ensuring a force balance parallel to the interface .",
    "this means that along the direction parallel to the interface , there is no reason why the attractive forces should have the same magnitude as the repulsive forces .",
    "as described above , we find that in practice , the attractive forces are stronger , which indeed give rise to a positive surface tension force .",
    "sketch showing repulsive ( dashed black arrows ) and attractive ( gray arrows ) forces in the bulk and at the surface . ]",
    "however , we still need to explain why these intermolecular forces give rise to such a strong tension along the surface .",
    "this question was previously addressed by berry@xcite , who noted the separate roles of attraction and repulsion .",
    "the key observation is that , to a good approximation , the repulsive contribution to the pressure is isotropic while attraction is strongly anisotropic .",
    "this is because the repulsion is very short ranged due to the hard core of the molecules , and can therefore be thought of as a  contact force \" . as such",
    ", repulsion is not very sensitive to the changes in molecular structure near the interface and is equally strong in all directions@xcite .",
    "by contrast , the long - range nature of the attractive forces make them very susceptible for the molecular structure .",
    "this is the origin of the observed pressure anisotropy near the interface that generates the surface tension force .    to see how this works out in detail it is useful to divide the liquid into two subsystems using control surfaces parallel to the liquid - vapor interface , as shown in fig .",
    "[ interfacelv]a .",
    "the force exerted on the dotted subsystem by the rest of the liquid results from the superposition of attractive ( vertical gray arrows ) and repulsive ( dashed black arrows ) interactions ( fig .",
    "[ interfacelv]a ) .",
    "as the subsystem is at equilibrium , these attractive and repulsive components must balance each other .",
    "the magnitude of the attractive force increases with the size of attracting region  this is because the density increases as one moves from the vapor towards the liquid phase .",
    "the magnitude of the attraction saturates to the bulk value when the control surface is a few molecular sizes from the interface .",
    "we then divide the liquid into two subsystems using a control surface perpendicular to the liquid vapor interface ( fig .",
    "[ interfacelv]b ) .",
    "one can now use that the repulsive short - range forces are isotropic .",
    "this means that the magnitude of repulsion ( dashed black arrows ) exerted by the left side on the subsystem ( dotted region ) increases with depth in a way analogous to that in fig .",
    "[ interfacelv]a .",
    "by contrast , the strength of attraction has a much weaker dependence on depth  for the sake of simplicity we draw it at a constant magnitude that equals the attraction in the bulk . as a result",
    ", there indeed is a net attraction of the subsystem by the rest of the liquid ( dark gray arrow in fig .",
    "[ interfacelv]c ) .",
    "forces exerted on a subsystem of liquid ( dotted region ) by the rest of the liquid ( gray region without dots ) ( a ) the subsystem considered is the lower part of the liquid and is separated from the interfacial zone by a line parallel to the liquid - vapor interface .",
    "the subsystem ( dotted region ) is submitted to an attractive force ( gray arrows ) and a repulsive force ( dashed black arrows ) exerted by the rest of the liquid ( gray region without dots ) .",
    "they must balance each other .",
    "( b ) the liquid is now divided along a line perpendicular to the interface .",
    "the subsystem considered ( dotted region on the right ) is submitted to an attractive force ( gray arrows ) and to a repulsive force ( dashed arrows ) exerted by the rest of the liquid ( gray region without dots).as the repulsive force is isotropic , it has the same magnitude as in ( a ) and therefore decays close to the surface . on the contrary ,",
    "the attractive force is nearly constant and remains almost unchanged close to the surface .",
    "( c ) this leads to a net attractive force from one side on the other . ]",
    "we now consider the liquid - solid interface ( see fig .  [ interfacels ] ) . here , two effects superimpose .",
    "first , due to the presence of the solid , there is a lack of liquid in the lower half - space ( hatched region in fig .",
    "[ interfacels ] ) .",
    "this missing liquid induces an anisotropy of the attractive liquid - liquid force in the same way as it does in the case of the liquid - vapor interface .",
    "therefore , as in fig .",
    "[ interfacelv]c , the left hand side of the liquid exerts a net attractive force @xmath5 per unit length on the right hand side subsystem .",
    "the second effect is due to the liquid - solid interaction . in the same way as with the liquid - vapor interface",
    ", we divide the liquid into two subsystems using a control surface parallel to the interface , as shown in fig .",
    "[ interfacels]a .",
    "the attraction by the solid ( gray arrow ) decreases with the distance and is perfectly balanced by a short range liquid - liquid repulsive force ( dashed arrows ) .",
    "now , we divide the liquid into two subsystems using a control surface _",
    "perpendicular _ to the liquid solid interface ( fig .",
    "[ interfacels]b ) .",
    "assuming once more that the liquid - liquid repulsion is isotropic , the left part of the liquid exerts a net repulsive force on the right subsystem ( dotted region ) .",
    "this force is induced by the influence of the solid and , perhaps surprisingly , it is not equal to @xmath26 . instead",
    ", it has been shown@xcite that this force is equal to @xmath61 , and this will be motivated in more detail below .",
    "to combine these two effects , we subtract the unbalanced attractive force due to the absent liquid ( @xmath5 ) from the repulsive force due to the solid ( @xmath61 ) to find the net repulsive force between the subsystems : @xmath37 .",
    "forces exerted by the solid ( dashed line ) on a subsystem of liquid ( dotted region ) . on these schematics , the attractive liquid - liquid interactions already treated in fig .",
    "[ interfacelv ] , are not considered .",

    "it is delimited by a line parallel to the liquid - solid interface , at different distances above it . the subsystem ( dotted region )",
    "is submitted to an attractive force ( gray arrows ) exerted by the solid and to a repulsive force ( dashed arrows ) exerted by the rest of the liquid ( gray region without dots ) .",
    "as the subsystem is in equilibrium , they must balance each other .",
    "( b ) the liquid is now divided along a line perpendicular to the interface .",
    "only the horizontal force components are shown .",
    "the solid exerts no horizontal attraction .",
    "as the repulsive interactions are isotropic , this results into an horizontal repulsive force exerted by one side on the other . ]",

    "( a ) to split a liquid volume into two semi - infinite volume , one has to create two liquid - vacuum interfaces .",

    "joining the liquid - vacuum and solid - vacuum interfaces yields an energy reduction @xmath64 due to the solid - liquid attraction . ]",
    "let us motivate why the strength of the solid - liquid interaction does not couple directly to the solid - liquid surface tension @xmath26 , but to the combination @xmath61@xcite .",
    "note that this feature will also be crucial for understanding the wetting phenomena discussed in the following section .",
    "the solid - liquid surface tension represents the free energy needed to create a solid - liquid interface . to make such an interface ,",
    "one first has to  break \" a bulk solid and a bulk liquid into two separate parts , and then join these solid and liquid parts together .",
    "this breaking of liquid is depicted schematically in fig .",
    "[ sl]a ( it works similarly for the solid ) .",
    "the corresponding energy is the  work of adhesion \" @xmath65 due to liquid - liquid attractions ( @xmath66 for the solid ) .",
    "this gives rise to a surface tension @xmath67 ( 2@xmath68 ) , since the liquid ( solid ) is connected to a vacuum at this intermediate stage .",
    "when joining the solid - vacuum and liquid - vacuum interfaces , the attractive solid - liquid interaction will reduce the surface energy by the solid - liquid work of adhesion @xmath69 ( fig .",
    "hence , the resulting solid - liquid surface tension becomes    @xmath70    from this one finds that , indeed , the strength of the solid - liquid adhesion reads    @xmath71    in the last step we used young s law for the equilibrium contact angle . as a consequence",
    ", the capillary forces induced by solid - liquid attractions will have a magnitude @xmath72 and not @xmath26 .",
    "the question of the force balance is even more intricate in the vicinity of the contact line , where the liquid - vapor interface meets a solid .",
    "it is crucial to note that _ the contact line itself does not represent any material _ : it is a mathematical line that marks the separation between wetted and dry parts of the solid .",

    "let us consider the forces on the wedge - shaped liquid corner in the vicinity of the contact line , as shown in fig .",
    "[ youngcorrect ] . choosing this subsystem",
    ", we will now explain young s force construction from fig .",
    "[ young]b and answer question 2 : what happens to the force balance normal to the solid - liquid interface ?",
    "there are two types of forces acting on the liquid molecules inside the subsystem : interactions with the solid and interactions with other liquid molecules outside the subsystem .",
    "we first consider the solid - on - liquid forces .",
    "one can immediately see that , since the solid spans an infinite half space , every liquid molecule experiences a resultant force that is oriented purely normal to the solid - liquid interface : the left - right symmetry of the solid ensures that there is no force component parallel to the interface .",
    "far from the contact line at the solid - liquid interface , this attractive force is balanced by a repulsive force , as discussed in fig .",
    "[ interfacels ] .",
    "however , since the repulsive force is continuous and zero outside the droplet , the repulsive force must decay close to the contact line .",
    "this means that there is an unbalanced attractive force that is strongly localized in the vicinity of the contact line .",
    "it has been shown@xcite that this force per unit length is equal to @xmath73 .",
    "the existence of this force has recently been challenged@xcite . to show that this force indeed must exist to achieve equilibrium , we consider the droplet shown in fig .  [ laplace ] .",

    "this provides the answer to question 2 : the downward solid - on - liquid force is not drawn in fig .",

    "since the solid can only exert a normal force on the liquid , all parallel force components drawn in young s construction are purely due to the liquid molecules outside the corner .",
    "the force drawn along the liquid - vapor interface can be understood directly from the tension @xmath5 inside the liquid - vapor interface ( cf .",

    "[ youngcorrect]a .",
    "in fact , one can easily verify that even the resultant torque ( or force moment ) is zero for this force construction .",
    "as such , it provides a more physical alternative to the classical picture of young s law .      the measurement of surface tension in fig .",
    "[ young]a directly relies on the force exerted by the liquid on the solid plate .",

    "the situation is thus very different from the forces on the liquid corner , which are in equilibrium and experiences a zero resultant force .",
    "this _ difference between systems _ provides the key to question 3 . in fig .",

    "the repulsion ( dotted arrows ) arises from the contact force at the solid - liquid interface .",

    "once again , we turn to the microscopic description of the forces in the vicinity of the contact line .",
    "it turns out that the normal component of the force exerted on the solid is equal to @xmath79 , consistent with the macroscopic picture of a tension along the liquid - vapor interface .",
    "however , the parallel component of the liquid - on - solid force does not have the expected magnitude @xmath81 , but @xmath82 .",
    "this can be understood as follows .",
    "[ forcesolid]a illustrates that the tangential force component originates from the long - range attraction between solid and liquid molecules . in the previous section we already demonstrated the strength of this solid - liquid adhesion to be @xmath83 .",
    "hence , there is no reason why the total force on the solid should be @xmath81 .",
    "indeed , the dft calculation confirms a tangential liquid - on - solid force of magnitude @xmath83@xcite .    the physics of this surprising result is nicely illustrated by fig .  [ forcesolid ] .",
    "the macroscopic intuition that the resultant surface tension force is pulling along the liquid - vapor interface would predict a force to the left whenever the contact angle @xmath84 .",
    "however , it is clear from the sketch of the attractive forces that the sum of all parallel components must be oriented towards the liquid ( right side in the figure ) .",
    "this stems from the asymmetry between the amount of liquid attracting the solid molecules on both sides of the contact line : there are always more liquid molecules on the right side of the contact line in this figure .",
    "this is consistent with a parallel force @xmath85 , but not with a force @xmath28 ( which changes sign at @xmath86 ) .",
    "note that when considering the force exerted by the solid _ on the liquid _",
    ", this asymmetry does not occur since the solid is left - right symmetric , therefore there is no tangential component .",
    "this once more illustrates that a detailed force interpretation crucially relies on the definition of the system .",

    "( a ) without liquid , there is neither repulsion nor attraction .",
    "( b ) when liquid is present there is repulsion and attraction .",
    "however , the repulsion is not completely balanced in this curved interface , as there is more liquid than in a plane geometry .",
    "( c ) the resulting force per unit surface is @xmath87 where @xmath75 is the curvature of the liquid ( positive in this case ) , equivalently to the laplace pressure .",
    "it only shows a dependency on the liquid - liquid interactions as it is only the absence of liquid that is relevant to the curvature . ]",
    "to solve this apparent discrepancy with the thermodynamic result one has to consider all the forces exerted by the liquid on the solid , i.e. not just the forces near the contact line .",
    "the key point is that the submerged solid bodies can not be flat everywhere and must have curved pieces of liquid - solid interface .",
    "if the interface separating the solid from the liquid is flat , the net normal force is locally zero as repulsion balances attraction ( far away from the contact line ) .",
    "however , when this interface is curved , a repulsive force inside the liquid is enhanced due to the curvature of the solid - liquid interface , in a way similar to the laplace pressure . as shown in fig .",
    "[ laplacesolid ] , the presence of a curved half - space of liquid acts on the solid , and creates an unbalanced liquid - on - solid force @xmath87 per unit area . here",
    "@xmath75 is the local curvature ( inverse radius of curvature ) of the solid .",
    "interestingly , dft calculations@xcite show that the resultant pressure couples only to @xmath5 and not to @xmath26 . as we show below , this is exactly what is needed to restore consistency between microscopic and thermodynamic forces .",

    "( e ) pin floating at the surface of a liquid under gravity .",
    "the upward thick gray arrows are the resultants of capillary forces .",
    "they balance the effect of gravity ( corrected by the archimedes force ) , shown as the downward black arrow . ]",
    "an excellent demonstration of this effect is the long debated case of a ` floating - pin ' under zero - gravity , as shown in fig  [ pin ] . whereas a floating pin in a system with gravity leaves a visible depression in the liquid - vapor interface near the contact line ( cf .",
    "[ pin]e ) , the zero - gravity condition ensures that the interface has a constant curvature , i.e. it is straight everywhere .",
    "this means that the vertical position depends on the equilibrium contact - angle alone , and not on the density ratio of the involved materials . as discussed in fig .",
    "[ forcesolid ] , the liquid - on - solid force near the contact line is not oriented along the liquid - vapor interface , but points towards the interior of the liquid .",
    "this creates a resultant downward force that has to be compensated to restore equilibrium .",
    "additionally , the curvature of the solid - liquid interface creates a normal force distributed over the whole immersed surface of the solid of magnitude @xmath87 per unit surface ( cf .",
    "[ pin]a ) . integrating over the curvature of the submerged surface from one contact line to the other",
    "then gives the resultant of the laplace pressure : @xmath91 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 are the unit vectors tangential to the pin , pointing upwards .",
    "therefore , the resultant is orientated upwards and is equal to @xmath92 per unit depth ( see fig .",

    "the same principle applies to the partially wetted plate of fig .",
    "[ young]a : the force exerted by the fluid on the plate results from two contributions , as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ platepartialtotal]c .",
    "first , there is the vertical force component ( per unit length ) due to the vicinity of the contact line : @xmath93 ( cf .",
    "[ forcesolid ] ) .",
    "second , there are submerged surfaces of the plate where a localized curvature exists at the corners .",
    "this curvature induces a laplace force on the pin ( see fig .",
    "[ pin]d ) which results into a net upward force @xmath5 per unit length of contact line which means the total force ( per unit length of contact line ) on the plate is @xmath28 , in agreement with the thermodynamic result .",
    "( a - b ) force per unit length of the contact line needed to keep a plate in equilibrium in a bath in partial ( a ) and complete wetting ( b ) .",
    "( c ) partial wetting .",
    "the vertical force at the contact line , equal to @xmath94 , is balanced by the laplace pressure induced by the curvature of the plate .",
    "note that any plate shape would lead to the same resultant force as the integral of the curvature over the surface reduces to the local tangents at the contact line ( see fig .",
    "[ pin]d ) .",
    "( d ) complete wetting case . due to the mesoscopic pre - wetting film , of which",
    "the thickness is exaggerated in the picture , there is no contact line , thus there is no force located near the apparent macroscopic contact line .",
    "the forces are related only to the laplace pressure : the curvature of the solid gives a zero resultant force , as it is completely immersed in the liquid , and the curvature of the liquid is acting on the solid only in the pre - wetting zone  as it is compensated by gravity in the meniscus .",
    "the resultant force per unit length is then equal to @xmath5 . ]    in the case of complete wetting , young s law for the contact angle is no longer applicable .",
    "instead , the apparent contact angle @xmath29 vanishes because the three surface tensions do not balance each other : @xmath95 physically , there is no real contact line in this configuration ( fig .",
    "[ platepartialtotal]b ) , but there is a meniscus where the liquid - vapor interface approaches the solid . beyond the meniscus",
    ", there exists a mesoscopic liquid film called a pre - wetting film , which covers the solid completely ( fig .",
    "[ platepartialtotal]d ) . the existence of an _ apparent _ contact line is only due to the effect of gravity : on a flat surface , the liquid would simply spread . the interface between the liquid and vapor phases consequently presents two regions . in the lower region ,",
    "the meniscus can be described by the balance between the laplace pressure and the gravity potential @xmath96 where @xmath59 is the height above the bath ( thus , no additional constant needed ) and @xmath75 the curvature of the interface . introducing the capillary length @xmath97 this equation",
    "can be written as : @xmath98 . in the upper region",
    ", there is the pre - wetting film whose thickness @xmath99 is determined by the balance between the gravity potential and the disjoining pressure @xmath100 .",
    "the disjoining pressure is by definition the potential energy per unit volume at the surface of a liquid layer of thickness @xmath101 , therefore the balance reads@xcite : @xmath102 as the pre - wetting film is very flat , the contribution of laplace pressure can be neglected ( @xmath103 ) in this regime .",
    "the disjoining pressure scales as : @xmath104 for films where @xmath105 , where @xmath11 is a length on the order of the molecular size .",
    "the disjoining pressure vanishes in the limit case @xmath106 , which can be interpreted as the situation for which the interaction is the same with the liquid and with the solid .",
    "then , one indeed does not expect any influence of the thickness @xmath101 on the energy .",
    "equating gravity and disjoining pressure ( eq . [ prewetpressurebalance ] ) , we obtain the thickness profile in the pre - wetting region : @xmath107^{1/3}\\ ] ] in the vicinity of the apparent contact line , where the two zones must match , the thickness is thus of order @xmath108 . as @xmath109 is millimetric and @xmath11 nanometric , @xmath101 is mesoscopic ( @xmath110  nm ) . from the microscopic point of view , the solid is then completely surrounded by a semi - infinite layer of liquid ( @xmath111 )",
    ". therefore , the only forces acting on a solid in complete wetting are normal contact forces , such as laplace pressures .",
    "there are no contact line forces such as those described in fig .",
    "[ forcesolid]b .",
    "the forces exerted by the liquid on the solid are then related , as previously , to the curvature of the liquid - solid interface but also , inside the pre - wetting film , to the curvature of the liquid - vapor interface ( fig  [ platepartialtotal]d ) .",
    "integrated over the whole submerged solid , the curvature of the solid gives a zero resultant force , whereas the curvature of the liquid is only integrated where the pre - wetting film exists . as a result ,",
    "the resultant force is vertical and has an amplitude @xmath5 per unit length of the apparent contact line .",
    "this result is indeed consistent with the thermodynamic perspective .",
    "since the solid is covered by a liquid layer much thicker than the molecular size the surface tension above the apparent contact line is not @xmath25 but @xmath112 : the plate is always completely submerged .",
    "in essence , this means that the plate never leaves the liquid bath when the plate is pulled upwards .",
    "when moving , there is no change of the solid - vapor interfacial area ( it remains zero ) or of the solid - liquid interfacial area ( which is simply the total area of the plate ) .",
    "the only change occurs at the liquid - vapor interfacial area , which is increased , and the required pulling strength is thus @xmath5 per unit length of the apparent contact line .",

    ", we were able to provide answers to these questions , and also reconcile thermodynamics and statistical physics .",
    "we have provided a mechanical perspective about why there exists an attractive force parallel to interfaces : surface tension .",
    "the absence of liquid creates an attractive anisotropic force within a few molecular lengths from the interface whereas the repulsion remains isotropic and scales with the local density of the fluid .",
    "the attractive anisotropy leads to a strong localized stress parallel to the interface called surface tension .",
    "this occurs at liquid - solid interfaces as well , where there is also a half - space of liquid missing .",

    "[ young]b ) .",

    "when looking at the force that is exerted by the liquid on the solid near the contact line we find that , surprisingly , this force is _ not _",
    "@xmath81 , but @xmath113",
    ". moreover , a normal stress is exerted in all the regions of any curved solid - liquid interface : the liquid pulls the solid when the latter is convex .",
    "this force is equivalent to the usual laplace pressure .",
    "one has to take _ both _ these forces into account , to obtain the net force from the thermodynamic result .",
    "the advantage of this microscopic force description is that it provides a simple answer to an academic problem which has become controversial in the last decade : the floating pin paradox@xcite .",
    "the drawings and several relations presented in this article are based on results obtained using the density functional theory in the sharp - kink approximation@xcite , which allows to make quantitative predictions of the force distributions in the liquid and in the solid . .",
    "we realize that the detailed picture of microscopic forces is not necessarily the most accessible for teaching purposes . in particular when introducing the basic concepts of capillarity , it is much simpler to work from the thermodynamic perspective : energy minimization naturally yields the equilibrium conditions , while the resultant forces can be computed from the virtual work principle .",

    "* the surface tensions @xmath26 and @xmath25 do not pull on the solid .",
    "* the global force exerted on the solid by the liquid can be computed by adding the contributions of ( laplace ) pressure inside the liquid and a localized tension force @xmath5 parallel to the liquid - vapor interface .",
    "while this gives the correct answer , it does not reflect the true microscopic distribution of liquid - on - solid forces .",
    "* by contrast , the resultant force on the liquid near the contact line _ does _ involve the three surface tensions @xmath114 and @xmath25 . * the classical construction of fig .",

    "a complete picture is provided in fig .",

    "[ youngcorrect]a will find its way to the classroom to explain young s law ( [ young ] ) .",
    "it is conceptually simple , it clarifies the  system \" to which forces are applied , and represents a perfect mechanical equilibrium .",
    "namely , besides a balance of normal and tangential components , the forces also exert a zero torque .",
    "finally , we note that the virtual work principle yields the correct resultant force on a solid , but that it can not recover the true microscopic force distribution .",
    "the knowledge of such a force distribution is crucial when one wants to take into account how a solid is elastically deformed by the contact line@xcite .",
