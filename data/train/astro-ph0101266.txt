    "for all cosmic objects , we would ideally like to know the flux density over the entire electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "this goal is now almost achieved , at least for the brightest objects in each important class .",
    "the obvious next goal is to map out each object s structure in as much detail as possible .",
    "the best available angular resolution is in the radio band : it is currently @xmath0 arc sec from vlbi techniques , and will further improve with space - based interferometry .",
    "it also , for a given baseline , improves as it becomes feasible to operate at shorter wavelengths .    even sharper angular resolution in the radio band ",
    "better than @xmath1 arc sec  is achieved via the monitoring of interstellar scintillation .",
    "such scintillations offer the only probe we have of , for instance , the emitting region in pulsar magnetospheres . another impressive recent inference from interstellar scintillation related to the interpretation of gamma - ray burst afterglows . the weak radio emission triggered by the burst 970508 displayed violent fluctuations during the first month , but became steadier thereafter ( frail et al .",
    "this implied that after one month it had become larger than the characteristic scale of interstellar fluctuations , 3 - 5 mass , just as would have been expected for a cosmologically distant object that had been expanding at an apparent transverse speed of @xmath2  a rate consistent with blast wave models for the afterglow .    in the visible band , adaptive optics",
    "allows the resolution of single ground - based telescopes to approach the diffraction limit , and to surpass that of the the hubble space telescope .",
    "optical interferometers , on the ground and then in space , will soon achieve further improvement by several powers of ten .",
    "resolution in the x - ray band is now better than 1 arc sec .",
    "there are already studies for x - ray interferometers , though the implementation of this technique remains futuristic",
    ".      it will be a long time before the most compact sources are resolved , but in the meantime a complementary type of information is available : time - variations in the flux .",
    "variability is of course routinely studied : on timescales of milliseconds in pulsars and compact stellar - mass x - ray sources ; hours , days and years in binary and pulsating stars , supernova remnants , and agns .    in most instances we can study either spatial structure or variability , but not both : variable objects are generally too compact to be spatially resolved ; conversely , variability is too slow to be discernible in structures large enough to be mapped .",
    "( this is exemplified , for instance , by the demarcation between spectroscopic binaries and visual binaries . )",
    "there are nearby objects within our galaxy which are of course exceptions .",
    "but there are only two classes of extragalactic objects where we already have both types of data , at least in the radio band :    \\(i ) jets with relativistic outflow display superluminal apparent velocities that can be spatially resolved even out to the hubble radius : changes in structure and flux can both be monitored .",
    "\\(ii ) slower speeds , of order the virial velocity , are of course harder to detect .",
    "vlbi has succeeded , however , in mapping the h@xmath3o maser emission from moving blobs in a disc orbiting the nucleus of the peculiar spiral galaxy ngc 4258 .",
    "( as we shall hear later in the meeting , our own galactic centre is sufficiently close that the orbital motions of stars are being tracked in the near infrared with ever - improving precision . )",
    "the power output from active galactic nuclei ( agns ) emerges over the entire electromagnetic spectrum , and on a range of scales spanning almost ten orders of magnitude  from the dimensions of the central ` engine ' itself , up to the megaparsec scale of giant radio lobes .",
    "it seems that the ` engine ' involves a supermassive hole , which also generates the relativistic jets that energise strong radio sources .",
    "the demography of these massive holes has been clarified by studies of relatively nearby galaxies : the nuclei of most of these display only low - level activity , but nonetheless they harbour dark central masses . how did these supermassive bodies form ? and are they indeed black holes with schwarzschild / kerr metrics , thereby offering real prospects of testing our theories of strong - field gravity ?",
    "there are now two spectacularly - convincing cases of massive collapsed objects in nearby galaxies .",
    "the first , in ngc 4258 , has been revealed by amazingly precise mapping of gas motions via the 1.3 cm maser - emission line of h@xmath3o ( miyoshi et al .",
    "1995 ; watson & wallin 1994 ) .",
    "the spectral resolution of this microwave line is high enough to pin down the velocities with accuracy of 1 km / sec .",
    "the very long baseline array achieves an angular resolution better than 0.5 milliarc seconds ( 100 times sharper than the hst , as well as far finer spectral resolution ! ) .",
    "these observations have revealed , right in ngc 4258 s core , a disc with rotational speeds following an exact keplerian law around a compact dark mass of @xmath4 .",
    "the second utterly convincing candidate lies in our own galactic centre .",
    "an unusual radio source has long been known to exist right at the dynamical centre of our galaxy , probably interpretable as low - level accretion onto a massive hole ( rees 1982 ; narayan , yi & mahadevan 1995 ) .",
    "direct evidence used to be ambiguous because intervening gas and dust in the plane of the milky way prevents us from getting a clear optical view of the central stars , as we can in , for instance , m31 .",
    "a great deal was known about gas flows , from radio and infrared measurements , but these were hard to interpret because gas does not move ballistically like stars , but can be influenced by pressure gradients , stellar winds , and other non - gravitational influences .",
    "the situation was transformed by remarkable observations of stars in the near infrared band , where obscuration by intervening material is less of an obstacle .",
    "these are presented by ekhart and by ghez at this meeting .",
    "the speeds scale as @xmath5 with distance from the centre , consistent with a hole of mass @xmath6 .",
    "the volume enclosed by the resolved orbiting material in these two systems  the gas in ngc 4258 , and the fast - moving stars in our galactic centre  is small enough that one can rule out such a high concentration of dark matter in any ` conventional ' form ( eg a dense cluster of faint stars ) .",
    "it is important to note , however , that the scale being probed is still very much larger than the putative black holes themselves .",
    "the observed molecular disc in ngc 4258 has an orbital speed is of order 1000 km / s .",
    "this corresponds to radii @xmath7 times larger than the gravitational radius @xmath8 .",
    "the stars closest to our galactic centre likewise lie so far out from the putative hole ( their speeds are less than 1 percent that of light ) that their orbits are essentially newtonian .",
    "the non - newtonian domain , where the distinctive features of black holes would show up , has dimensions tens of thousands of times smaller .",
    "we can infer from the high luminosity and rapid variability of agns and compact x - ray sources that , of they are powered by gravitational energy , then ` gravitational pits ' exist , deep and compact enough to allow several percent of the rest mass of infalling material to be radiated from a region that can vary on timescales as short as a few times @xmath9 .",
    "but we still lack quantitative probes of the relativistic region .",
    "we believe in general relativity primarily because it has been resoundingly vindicated in the weak field limit by high - precision observations in the solar system , and in the binary pulsar  not because we yet have evidence for black holes with the precise kerr metric .",
    "what are the prospects of probing further in and testing the strong - field predictions of einstein s theory ?",
    "optical spectroscopy tells us a great deal about the gas in agns .",
    "however , the line - emission in the visible band originates quite far from the hole .",
    "this is because the innermost regions would be so hot that their thermal emission emerges as more energetic quanta .",
    "x - rays are a far more direct probe of the relativistic region .",
    "the appearance of the inner disc around a hole , taking doppler and gravitational shifts into account , along with light bending , was first calculated by bardeen & cunningham ( 1972 ) and subsequently by several others .",
    "there is of course no hope ( until x - ray interferometry is developed ) of actually ` imaging ' these inner discs .",
    "however , the large frequency - shifts could reveal themselves spectroscopically  substantial gravitational redshifts would be expected , as well as large doppler shifts ( see , for instance , white et al .",
    "( 1989 ) ) .    until recently",
    ", the energy resolution and sensitivity of x - ray detectors was inadequate to permit spectroscopy of extragalactic objects .",
    "the asca x - ray satellite was the first with the capability to measure emission line profiles in agns .",
    "it revealed a convincing example ( tanaka et al .",
    "1995 ) of a broad asymmetric emission line indicative of a relativistic disc , and others should soon follow .",
    "the angular momentum parameter in the kerr metric can in principle be constrained too , because the emission is concentrated closer in , and so displays larger shifts , if the hole is rapidly rotating , and there is some evidence that this must be the case in mcg6 - 30 - 15 ( iwasawa et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "the chandra and xmm / newton x - ray satellites should be able to extend and refine these studies ; they may offer enough sensitivity , in combination with time - resolution , to study flares , and even to follow a ` hot spot ' on a plunging orbit .",
    "the swing in the polarization vector of photon trajectories near a hole was long ago suggested ( connors , piran & stark 1980 ) as another diagnostic ; but this is still not feasible because x - ray polarimeters are far from capable of detecting the few percent polarization expected .",
    "the spin of a hole affects the efficiency of ` classical ' accretion processes , and determines how much energy is in principle extractable by the blandford - znajek ( 1977 ) effect .",
    "moreover , the typical amount of spin possessed by supermassive holes could tell us how they formed and grew .",
    "spin - up is a natural consequence of prolonged disc - mode accretion : any hole that has ( for instance ) doubled its mass by capturing material that is all spinning the same way would end up with a / m being at least 0.5 .",
    "a hole that is the outcome of a merger between two of comparable mass would also , generically , have a substantial spin . on the other hand ,",
    "if it had gained its mass from capturing many low - mass objects ( holes , or even stars ) in randomly - oriented orbits , a /",
    "m would be small .",
    "most of the literature on flows around kerr holes assumes axisymmetry .",
    "this assumption is motivated not just by simplicity , but by the expectation that lense - thirring precession would impose axisymmetry close in , even if the flow further out were oblique and/or on eccentric orbits .",
    "plausible - seeming arguments , dating back to the pioneering paper by bardeen & petterson ( 1975 ) suggested that the alignment would occur , and would extend out to a larger radius if the viscosity were low because there would be more time for lense - thirring precession to act on inward - spiralling gas .",
    "however , later studies , especially by pringle , ogilvie , and their associates , have shown that naive intuitions can go badly awry .",
    "the behaviour of the ` tilt ' is much more subtle ; the effective viscosity perpendicular to the disc plane can be much larger than in the plane . in a thin disc ,",
    "the alignment effect is actually weaker when viscosity is low .",
    "what happens in a thick torus is a still unclear , and will have to await 3-d gas - dynamical simulations .",
    "there is now evidence for changing orientations .",
    "the orientation of a hole s spin and the innermost flow patterns could have implications for jet alignment . an important paper by natarajan & pringle ( 1998 ) shows that ` forced precession ' effects due to torques on a disc can lead to swings in the rotation axis that are surprisingly fast ( i.e. on timescales very much shorter than the timescale for changes in the hole s mass ) .    these effects could be elucidated by images that were able to resolve the region , maybe 10100 times larger than @xmath10 , where the effective axis of symmetry tilts from that determined by the hole s spin to that determined by the angular momentum of gas in the core of the host galaxy .      in round numbers ,",
    "the angular sizes corresponding to the gravitational radius @xmath11 are :    the monster holes such as the one in m87 have the same angular scale as the one in our galactic centre  the latter is about 1000 times closer , but also 1000 times less massive . (",
    "note that even the closest stellar - mass holes ( cf section 2.6 ) have still smaller angular sizes . )",
    "unfortunately the emission in the band where resolution is currently best  the radio band  comes from regions far larger than the hole itself .",
    "it is the optical non - thermal continuum , and the x - rays , that come from the region where strong - gravity effects are significant .",
    "clues to the strong - gravity regime are , at least in the near - term , likely to be less direct ( and are discussed further by roger blandford ) .",
    "evidence for a hole s presence does not require such extreme resolution , because stars are affected by the gravitational field of a supermassive hole out to radii of order @xmath12 .",
    "the integrated light from the stellar cusp is resolvable by ground - based optical telescopes as well as the hst , and it is measurements of this cusp that have revealed so many holes in quiescent galaxies . improved optical resolution will obviously be able to probe a larger sample , as well as pinning down some of the current uncertainties about stellar dynamics within the cusp .",
    "as other speakers will discuss , there is a crude proportionality between the hole s mass and that of the central bulge or spheroid in the stellar distribution ( which is of course the dominant part of an elliptical galaxy , but only a subsidiary component of a disc system like m31 or our own galaxy . )    to understand and clarify this relationship , we need evidence for ( or against ) black holes in small galaxies , and also in galaxies at high redshifts .",
    "such information would help to test the popular scenario according to which galaxies form via a process of successive mergers .",
    "issues include :    \\(a ) how much does a black hole grow ( and how much electromagnetic energy does it radiate ) in the aftermath of each merger ? and    \\(b ) how far up the ` merger tree ' did the first massive holes form ?",
    "a single big galaxy can be traced back to the stage when it was in dozens of smaller components with individual internal velocity dispersions as low as 20 km / sec .",
    "did central black holes form even in these small and weakly bound systems ?",
    "two galactic x - ray sources , believed to involve black holes , have double radio structures that resemble miniature versions of the classical extragalactic strong radio sources .",
    "their jets display apparent superluminal motions across the sky , indicating that , like the extragalactic radio sources , they contain plasma in relativistic bulk motion ( eg mirabel & rodriguez 2000 ) .",
    "there is no reason to be surprised by these resemblances between phenomena involving black holes with very different masses .",
    "indeed , the physics is exactly the same , apart from very simple scaling laws .",
    "if we define @xmath13 and @xmath14 , where @xmath15 , then for a given value of @xmath16 , the flow pattern may be essentially independent of @xmath17 .",
    "linear scales and timescales , of course , are proportional to @xmath17 , and densities in the flow scale as @xmath18 .",
    "the physics that amplifies and tangles any magnetic field may be scale - independent , and the field strength b scales as @xmath19 .",
    "so the bremsstrahlung or synchrotron cooling timescales go as @xmath17 , implying that @xmath20 is insensitive to @xmath17 ; so also are ratios involving , for instance , coupling of electron and ions in thermal plasma .",
    "therefore , the efficiencies and the value of @xmath21 are insensitive to @xmath17 , and depend only on @xmath16 .",
    "moreover , the form of the spectrum depends on @xmath17 only rather insensitively .    the kinds of accretion flow inferred in , for instance , m87 ,",
    "giving rise to a compact radio and x - ray source , along with a relativistic jet , could operate just as well if the hole mass was a few solar masses rather than a few billions .",
    "so we can actually study the same processes involved in agns in microquasars close at hand within our own galaxy . and",
    "these miniature sources may allow us to observe a simulacrum of the entire evolution of a strong extragalactic radio source , speeded up by a similar factor .",
    "for example , grs 1915 + 105 , one of the stellar - mass objects with superluminal radio jets , displays quasi - periodic oscillations , at around 60 hz , which may be due to unstable flow patterns near the hole ( morgan , remillard & greiner 1996 ) .",
    "the simple scaling arguments given above imply that the agns which it resembles might equally well display oscillations with the same cause .",
    "however , the periods would be measured in days , rather than fractions of a second .",
    "it would of course be fascinating if we could ` image ' a black hole sharply enough to map the extreme - relativistic regime , detect the apparent distortions caused by the dramatic deflection of ray - paths by strong gravity , and watch the flow patterns vary . but this will have to await optical or x - ray interferometers with sub - microsecond resolution .",
    "however , in the meantime interesting phenomena can be probed on a range of larger scales .",
    "the broad line region ( blr ) is typically at @xmath22 .",
    "it varies on timescales down to the light - crossing time , in response to changes in the ionizing continuum emitted closer in .",
    "the ` reverberation mapping ' technique has already yielded clues to the size of the blr and its internal dynamics , but it would obviously help greatly if its time - varying spatial structure could be imaged .",
    "even more interesting would be optical imaging of the inner parts of jets , and of the non - thermal ` coronae ' in which the blr gas is embedded .",
    "self - absorption restricts the brightness temperature of synchrotron emission .",
    "this has the well - known consequence that any strong radio source emitting by the synchrotron process should be big enough to be resolvable by earth - based interferometers .",
    "it also implies that only rather weak synchrotron sources would be small enough to exhibit interstellar scintillations .    some quite strong blazars ( idvs ) have , however , been found to exhibit intraday variability .",
    "( kedziora - chudczer et al . 1997 ; dennett - thorpe & de bruyn 2000 ) .",
    "according to standard models for interstellar scintillation , these sources would seem to have a brightness temperature too high to be compatible with synchrotron radiation .",
    "( for a relativistic jet , this depends on the bulk lorentz factor , but only via a power @xmath23 . )    if an agn displayed ( for instance ) intrinsic variability on timescales less than an hour at low radio frequencies , then the implied brightness temperature would be @xmath24 , which would obviously imply some coherent mechanism .",
    "some such process of course happens in pulsars ( and is very poorly understood ) ; however , few of the suggested mechanisms would scale to the weaker fields in agns .",
    "( moreover , the high - temperature emission would also have to evade attenuation by ( ordinary ) synchrotron self - absorption or by induced compton scattering : these are serious constraints on tenable models and geometry . )",
    "the brightness temperature implied by the idvs seems at most a factor of 10 higher than the synchrotron limit .",
    "perhaps there is some atypical turbulence in the interstellar medium along the line of sight to these particular objects which induces scintillations even for sources whose angular size exceeds the usual estimate , in which case these sources would not pose a distinctive problem",
    ". however , if a new emission mechanism is indeed operating , possibilities would include :      _ cyclotron maser action in a kilogauss field_. whereas a synchrotron maser can not exist except under unrealistic conditions , cyclotron masers occur more readily , and are operative in ( for instance ) jupiter s magnetosphere .",
