    "the structure and properties of exotic short - living nuclei are usually studied through their reactions with stable targets . on the theoretical side ,",
    "the reliability of the extracted information depends on the validity of the assumed interaction model and on the accuracy of the theoretical methods used to solve the respective few- or many - body problem . among the standard tools for the analysis of breakup reactions",
    "are the distorted wave born approximation , the eikonal approximation @xcite , time - dependent models @xcite , and the more sophisticated continuum - discretized coupled - channels ( cdcc ) method @xcite . for reactions involving effective two - cluster systems like deuteron or one - neutron halo nuclei that are treated as three - body problems ( two - cluster nucleus plus a target ) also the exact faddeev - type formalism @xcite in the momentum - space framework has successfully been applied . within this approach ,",
    "once numerically well - converged results are obtained , all discrepancies with the experimental data can be attributed to the shortcomings of the used three - body model .",
    "however , practical applications of the faddeev - type formalism are limited so far to light projectiles and targets .    on the other hand , faddeev - type calculations can be used to check the accuracy of the traditional approximate nuclear reaction methods .",
    "indeed , the comparison @xcite of faddeev - type and cdcc results revealed that cdcc is a reliable method for deuteron - nucleus elastic scattering and breakup but fails for the breakup of a one - neutron halo nucleus , assumed to be a bound state of an inert nuclear core ( @xmath2 ) and a neutron ( @xmath3 ) , on a proton ( @xmath4 ) target .",
    "more specifically , the peaks of the differential cross section in energy and angular distributions of the core @xmath2 are underpredicted by cdcc .",
    "those peaks are due to @xmath1 quasi free scattering ( qfs ) , i.e. , only the neutron interacts with the proton and is knocked out from the @xmath5 nucleus whereas the momentum and energy transfers to the core @xmath2 vanish and , as a consequence , the core keeps the velocity of the incoming beam .",
    "thus , near the @xmath1 qfs the reaction dynamics is dominated by the @xmath1 interaction which is very difficult to describe well when the three - particle cdcc wave function is expanded using the @xmath6 bound and selected continuum states as done in standard cdcc ( the transfer - to - continuum cdcc @xcite is more successful , but so far it is only available for three - body systems ) .",
    "for the same reason one may expect the failure of cdcc for the breakup of a core and two - neutron nucleus @xmath7 on a proton target near @xmath1 qfs kinematics , especially at higher energies relevant for the analysis of present day and future experiments .",
    "although four - body cdcc @xcite and eikonal approximation @xcite calculations for breakup of two - neutron halo nuclei exist , to the best of our knowledge , they were not applied in the @xmath1 qfs regime .",
    "furthermore , additional technical difficulties arise in cdcc if two - body bound states @xmath5 exist @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the rigorous treatment of the four - particle scattering problem within the faddeev - type framework was successfully performed only for the four - nucleon system so far @xcite .",
    "the extension of the faddeev - type method to distinguishable particles and high energies is very difficult technical challenge , although in principle it may be feasible . on the other hand , such a huge effort may be unnecessary for the description of particular breakup reactions where the cdcc is expected to fail , i.e. , for @xmath8 breakup near @xmath1 qfs kinematics .",
    "the studies of @xmath9be breakup on a proton target at 200 mev / nucleon reaction energy @xcite around the @xmath1 qfs kinematics revealed that the single scattering approximation ( ssa ) reproduces quite accurately the results of the full faddeev - type calculations for not too small neutron scattering angles .",
    "thus , one may expect the ssa to be reasonable also in the four - particle system at similar kinematical conditions .",
    "we therefore aim at developing the four - particle ssa to study the breakup reactions @xmath10 and @xmath11 at higher energies .",
    "the numerical results use @xmath12c reactions as example .",
    "unfortunately , no experimental data is available . in the present work",
    "we will concentrate on theoretical aspects of the three - cluster breakup where one may create effective three - body model @xmath13 with @xmath14 .",
    "physically such a model is inadequate for weakly bound @xmath5 , but it allows to perform full three - body faddeev - type calculations and , by comparing with the respective ssa , identify the kinematical regimes where the ssa is reasonable , and estimate its accuracy .    in sec .",

    "the ags equations are equivalent to the faddeev - yakubovsky equations @xcite but are formulated for the four - particle transition operators @xmath17 , i.e. , @xmath18 the components of the operators are distinguished by the two - cluster partition and by the three - cluster partition ; 18 different combinations are possible .",

    "a detailed investigation of the ms-3b contributions reveals that , depending on @xmath193 and @xmath192 , its difference to ssa-3b is dominated by 2nd order terms @xmath197 or @xmath198 .",
    "we also note that at the qfs peaks the relative @xmath1 energy is around 150 mev ; thus , it is still in the regime where the underlying @xmath1 potential is well constrained by the experimental data .",
    "the oia as given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : t3oi ] ) results in higher values of the energy @xmath84 at which the @xmath1 transition operator @xmath103 is evaluated as compared to the original ssa ( [ eq : e3 ] ) .",
    "this might lead to smaller @xmath103 values in oia since the matrix elements of @xmath103 in average decrease with increasing energy much like the total @xmath1 cross section does .",
    "this may explain why the oia-4b in most cases underestimates the ssa-4b predictions .",
    "furthermore , we conjecture that the use of the overlap integrals in many - body reaction models would have qualitatively similar effect , i.e. , would reduce the predicted cross sections .",
    "a kinematically complete measurement of the four - cluster breakup requires the detection of three - clusters at least .",
    "as this is extremely difficult , semi - inclusive observables like momentum distributions are usually measured . nevertheless , here we present results for the fully exclusive differential cross section that serves as a intermediate step for the calculation of semi - inclusive cross sections . with this goal in mind",
    "it is advantageous to choose the relative momenta as kinematical variables , i.e. ,    [ eq : jacobi1 ] @xmath199    where the subscripts @xmath200 and @xmath201 distinguish between the two neutrons and @xmath202 .",
    "the associated relative energies are @xmath203 , @xmath204 , and @xmath205 with reduced masses @xmath206 ,",
    "@xmath207 , and @xmath208 . for example , @xmath209 and @xmath210 are the momentum and energy of the nuclear core @xmath2 in the four - particle center - of mass ( c.m . ) system , while @xmath211 and @xmath212 are the two - neutron relative momentum and energy .",
    "owing to momentum and energy conservation there are eight independent kinematic variables ; we choose them as the polar and azimuthal scattering angles @xmath213 with @xmath214 and two energies @xmath212 and @xmath215 . in this representation the spin - averaged eightfold differential cross section is @xmath216 where , as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : d5s ] ) , the sum runs over all initial and final spin states . the single - particle cross section for the core @xmath2 in the c.m",
    "frame can simply be obtained as @xmath217     ( color online ) differential cross section for @xmath0c@xmath218c reaction at @xmath166 mev as a function of the relative @xmath112 energy @xmath212 for selected values of @xmath215 near @xmath1 qfs kinematics and angles @xmath219 , @xmath220 , and @xmath221 whereas @xmath222 . ]",
    "the @xmath1 qfs implies @xmath223 and @xmath224 but also vanishing relative momentum @xmath225 and relative energy @xmath226 ( here for simplicity we assume that @xmath200 is knocked out , but in practical calculations the amplitudes are antisymmetric with respect to the two neutrons ) .",
    "thus , due to low relative @xmath6 energy the ssa is expected to be less accurate than for the three - cluster breakup in suitable kinematics . nevertheless , in fig .",
    "[ fig : q300 ] we show the results for the fully exclusive differential cross section ( [ eq : d8s ] ) of the @xmath12c@xmath227c reaction at @xmath166 mev .",
    "we fix the azimuthal angles @xmath222 and vary the polar angles near a pronounced qfs peak at @xmath228 , @xmath229 , and @xmath230 . the cross section is shown as a function of the relative @xmath112 energy @xmath212 for selected values of @xmath215 around @xmath231e_\\rho^i$ ] .",
    "the results demonstrate that the differential cross section decreases rapidly whenever kinematical conditions deviate from qfs .",
    "finally , we note that the reliability of the ssa predictions for the semi - inclusive cross section ( [ eq : d3sa ] ) may be even more limited .",
    "the integration in eq .",
    "( [ eq : d3sa ] ) unavoidably includes regions of phase space with low relative @xmath118 energy where the higher order terms omitted in the ssa may be significant .",
    "starting with full four - particle ags equations for the transition operators we derived three- and four - cluster breakup amplitudes in the single - scattering approximation .",
    "numerical calculations were performed for @xmath0c breakup on a proton target with the @xmath107c core and two - neutron model for the @xmath0c nucleus .",
    "breakup reactions at 200 and 300 mev / nucleon energy near @xmath1 qfs conditions were studied . in the case of the three - cluster breakup an additional three - body model , although being physically inadequate , allowed to estimate the accuracy of the ssa and thereby identify the kinematical regimes where the ssa is reliable .",
    "these regimes correspond to higher reaction energies and to higher relative energies between the composite cluster and any of the nucleons and are realized at proton or neutron scattering angles around @xmath188 .",
    "there the accuracy of the ssa becomes as good as 6% .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that an additional approximation in the energy dependence of the @xmath1 transition operator is needed to factorize the ssa of the three - cluster breakup amplitude into @xmath103 and the overlap integral of two- and three - particle bound states .",
    "this approximation usually reduces the cross section , in some cases even up to 10% .",
    "no ssa reliability test was possible for the four - cluster breakup but , given the conclusions drawn in the three - cluster case , it is expected to be less accurate .",
    "an extension of the present calculations to include also the double - scattering terms , especially those between the core and neutron at low relative energy , would be highly desirable .",
    "the obtained three- and four - cluster breakup results demonstrate that the differential cross section is sharply peaked at @xmath1 qfs point and decreases rapidly whenever kinematical conditions deviate from @xmath1 qfs .",
    "the present numerical calculations are limited to @xmath12c reactions .",
    "however , the formalism is applicable also to other nuclei like @xmath232be , @xmath233c , and @xmath234o , and , in the case of the four - cluster breakup , also to @xmath235he , @xmath9li , and @xmath236c .",
