    "zero - point field energy density is a simple and inexorable property of a quantum field , such as the electromagnetic field , which is a representation of the lorentz group of transformations of special relativity .  for a quantum field ,",
    "the canonical position and momentum variables do not commute and consequently the lowest state of the field has a non - zero energy , just as the ground state of a quantum mechanical harmonic oscillator is non - zero .  for the electromagnetic field ,",
    "if we assume the shortest wavelength photon to be included in the ground state spectrum has the planck length of 10@xmath1 m , then the predicted quantum vacuum energy density is enormous , about @xmath2 j / m@xmath3 or , in terms of mass , @xmath4 g/@xmath5  such an enormous energy density is clearly a puzzling embarrassment to physicists , who for years routinely discarded this nearly infinite result in renormalization procedures .    however , there are measurable consequences of the zero point energy which arise because the ground state vacuum electromagnetic field has to meet the usual boundary conditions for the electromagnetic field .",
    "it is the effect of boundaries on the vacuum field that leads to the appearance of vacuum stresses , so called casimir forces .",
    "the term casimir force  @xmath6 most commonly refers to the attractive vacuum force per area ( pressure ) that exists between two parallel , infinite , uncharged , perfectly conducting plates separated by a distance @xmath7 @xcite@xcite@xmath8    where @xmath9  this force arises from the change in energy density @xmath10 from the free field vacuum density that occurs between the parallel plates : @xmath11    this attractive force @xmath6  , which is normal to the surface , arises because the surfaces change the mode distribution of the ground state quantized electromagnetic field .  in the region between two parallel perfectly conducting plates , no modes with wavelengths larger than twice",
    "the separation can exist .",
    "we can also view this force as arising from radiation pressure , the transfer of momentum from the vacuum to the surfaces@xcite .",
    "the casimir effect was first predicted in 1948 , but was not measured accurately until the last few years@xcite@xcite .",
    "corrections for finite conductivity and surface roughness have been developed for the parallel plate geometry ,  and the agreement between theory and experiment is now at the 1% level or better for separations of about  0.1 - 0.7 @xmath12 @xcite .  in actual practice ,",
    "the measurements are most commonly made with one surface curved and the other surface flat , and using the proximity force theorem to account for the curvature .",
    "this experimental approach eliminates the difficulties of trying to maintain parallelism at submicron separations .",
    "mohideen and collaborators have made the most accurate measurements to date in this manner , using an afm ( atomic force microscope ) that has a metallized sphere about 250 @xmath12 in diameter attached to the end of a cantilever about 200 @xmath12 long , capable of measuring piconewton forces .",
    "the deflection of the sphere is measured optically as it is moved close to a flat metallized surface@xcite .",
    "the more difficult measurement between two parallel plates has been made and shown to give results that are consistent with theory@xcite .",
    "measurements of the force between two parallel surfaces each with a small ( 1 nm ) sinusoidal modulation in surface height , have showed that there is a lateral force as well as the usual normal force when the modulations of the opposing surfaces are not in phase @xcite .",
    "recent measurements have confirmed the predictions , including effects of finite conductivity , surface roughness , and temperature , uncertainty in dielectric functions , to the 1 - 2% level for the range from 65 - 300 nm@xcite .",
    "there is a small uncertainty in the temperature corrections , particularly at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "casimir forces occur for all quantum fields and can arise from the presence of surfaces as well as choices of topology of the space .",
    "initially casimir forces for plane surfaces were obtained by computing the change in the vacuum energy with position .",
    "two decades after casimir s initial predictions , a method was developed to compute the casimir force in terms of the local stress - energy tensor using quantum electrodynamics@xcite .",
    "many innovations have followed .",
    "several approaches to computing electromagnetic casimir forces have been developed that are not based on the zero point vacuum fluctuations directly .",
    "these approaches appeal to scientists who are uncomfortable with the quantum electrodynamical model of energy in empty space .",
    "in the special case of the vacuum electromagnetic field with dielectric or conductive boundaries , various approaches suggest that casimir forces can be regarded as macroscopic manifestations of many - body retarded van der waals forces , at least in simple geometries with isolated atoms@xcite , @xcite .",
    "casimir effects have also been derived and interpreted in terms of _ source _ fields in both conventional @xcite and unconventional @xcite quantum electrodynamics , in which the fluctuations appear within materials instead of outside of the materials .",
    "lifshitz provided a detailed computation of the casimir force between planar surfaces by assuming that stochastic fluctuations occur in the tails of the wavefunctions of atoms that leak into the regions outside the surface , and can lead to induced dipole moments in atoms in a nearby surface , which leads to an a net retarded dipole - induced dipole force between the planar surfaces@xcite .",
    "these various approaches differ in how they visualize the fluctuations of the electromagnetic field , but give consistent results in the few cases of simple geometries which have been computed@xcite",
    ".  it may be that these diverse approaches will display differences for computation of geometries with curvature , or for computations of the forces between separated , curved surfaces@xcite .",
    "parallel plate casimir forces go inversely as the fourth power of the separation between the plates .",
    "the casimir force per unit area @xmath6 between perfectly conducting plates is equivalent to about 1 atm pressure  at a separation of 10 nm , and so is a candidate for actuation of mems ( microelectromechanical systems ) .  in mems , surfaces may come into close proximity with each other , particularly during processes of etching sacrificial layers in the fabrication process .  in 1995 the first analysis of a dynamic mems structure that used vacuum forces",
    "was presented by serry et al@xcite .",
    "they consider an idealized mems component resembling the original casimir model of two parallel plates , except that one of the plates is connected to a stationary surface by a linear restoring force and can move along the direction normal to the plate surfaces .",
    "the casimir force between the two plates , together with the restoring force acting on the moveable plate , results in a bistable system with two equilibrium separtions .",
    "the larger separation is a stable equilibrium and the smaller one is unstable , leading to the collapse of the movable surface into stationary plate .",
    "the analysis demonstrates that the casimir effect could be used to actuate a switch , and might be responsible in part for the stiction `` phenomenon in which micromachined membranes are found to latch onto nearby surfaces .",
    "if the movable surface is vibrating , then an anharmonic casimir oscillator '' ( aco ) results .",
    "to explore stiction in common mems configurations , serry et al computed the deflection of membrane strips and the conditions underwhich they would collapse into nearby surfaces@xcite .",
    "measurements were done by buks et al on cantilever beams to investigate the role of casimir forces in stiction@xcite .",
    "an experimental realization of the aco in a nanometer - scale mems system was recently reported by chan et al @xcite . in this experiment",
    "the casimir attraction between a 500 @xmath13m - square plate suspended by torsional rods and a gold - coated sphere of radius 100 @xmath13 m was observed as a sharp increase in the tilt angle of the plate as the sphere - plate separation was reduced from 300 nm to 75.7 nm .",
    "this quantum mechanical actuation `` of the plate suggests new possibilities for novel actuation schemes in mems based on the casimir force '' @xcite .  in a refinement of this experiment ,",
    "a novel proximity sensor was demonstrated in which the plate was slightly oscillated with an ac signal , and the deflection amplitude observed gave an indication of the precise location of the nearby sphere@xcite .",
    "a measurement using a similar torsion oscillator was recently reported using gold on the sphere and chromium on the plate@xcite .",
    "mems currently employed in sensor and actuator technology generally have component separations on the order of microns , where casimir effects are negligible .",
    "smaller distances between mems components are desirable in electrostatic actuation schemes because they permit smaller voltages to be used to generate larger forces and torques .",
    "casimir effects will be of increasing significant in microelectromechanical systems ( mems ) as further miniaturization is realized @xcite .",
    "the parallel plate geometry ( and the approximately equivalent sphere - plate geometry or sphere - plate with small deviations geometry ) is essentially the only geometry for which experimental measurements have been conducted and the only geometry for which the vacuum forces between * two separate surfaces * ( assumed to be infinite ) have been computed .",
    "vacuum forces are know to exist in other experimental configurations between separate surfaces , but rigorous calculations based on qed ( quantum electrodynamics ) are very difficult and have yet to be completed@xcite .",
    "since it is experimentally possible to measure forces between various separate surfaces , with the improvement in experimental techniques , theoreticians may soon see the need for such computations .",
    "calculations of vacuum stresses for a variety of geometric shapes , such as spheres , cylinders , rectangular parallelepipeds , and wedges are reviewed in @xcite@xcite@xcite .  in general ,",
    "calculations of vacuum forces become very complex when the surfaces are curved , particularly with right angles .",
    "divergences in energy appear , and there are disagreements about the proper way to deal with these divergences@xcite .",
    "the material properties , such as the dielectric constant and plasma frequency of the metal and the surface roughness also affect the vacuum forces .",
    "in addition , in the usual calculations only a spatial average of the force for a given area for the ground state of the quantum vacuum field is computed , and material properties , such as binding energies , are ignored , a procedure which barton has questioned recently@xcite@xcite@xcite .    computation has shown that the vacuum stress on a spherical metal shell , a cubical shell , or a solid dielectric ball is a repulsive uniform force , or directed outward .  because of the very special nature of the parallel plate geometry and the high degree of symmetry of the cube and sphere , it is not reliable to make generalizations about the behavior of vacuum forces based on these special geometries .",
    "the vacuum forces on the faces of conductive rectangular boxes or cavities show very different features compared to those of the parallel plate , the cube , and the sphere",
    ".  for a rectangular parallelepiped cavity , the total force on a given face ( the differential force integrated over the entire face ) can be positive , zero , or negative depending on the ratio of the sides of the box@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "in fact there are cavities that have zero force on two sides and a positive or negative force on the remaining side .",
    "there are boxes for which the change in the vacuum energy is negative ( or positive ) and the forces on some walls are attractive while the forces on the remaining walls are repulsive .",
    "indeed it is difficult to get an intuitive picture of the meaning of these results .    from  a technological viewpoint , it would be useful to be able to  generate repulsive vacuum forces as well as attractive vacuum forces .  from a fundamental viewpoint ,",
    "it is unclear how one can have a repulsive force in vacuum if the force can be correctly modeled as a dipole - induced dipole force .",
    "thus there is great interest in measuring the vacuum forces in different geometries that are predicted to be repulsive .  however , there is no easy way to measure vacuum forces on spheres or rectangular cavities@xcite .",
    "one might consider applying a stress to the spherical shell , and observe the deformation .",
    "this is a difficult experiment since the sphere would probably have to be submicron in diameter for the casimir force to be large enough to be measurable .",
    "further , the deflection measured would depend on the properties of the material of which the sphere was made , and such properties are not included in the usual calculations of the casimir force@xcite .",
    "alternatively one might contemplate cutting a sphere in half , and measuring the force between the two hemispheres using an atomic force microscope .",
    "however , the question arises : if we cut a spherical cavity into two hemispheres , will we find a repulsive force between the two separate surfaces ?  or will an attractive force between the edges dominate ?",
    "no computations have yet been done for this situation for real materials .  for optically thin materials barton",
    "shows the net force will be attractive@xcite@xcite .",
    "vacuum forces computed for a perfectly conducting cube with thin walls are also repulsive or outward , and experimentalists have the same conundrum regarding the meaning of this calculated vacuum force .  to measure the force one might imagine freeing one face of the cube , and then moving it very slightly normal to its surface , in the spirit of the principle of virtual work de =- fdx .",
    "unfortunately no one has computed the force between a cube with one side removed and a nearby surface which is parallel to the missing face .",
    "we have attempted to measure the force between an array of open cavities ( wall thickness about 150 nm , cavity width about 200 nm ) and a metallized sphere 250 @xmath13 m in diameter on an afm cantilever , and to date have only observed diminished attractive forces@xcite .",
    "another limitation of the calculations to date for the rectangular cavity , is that only the total force on each face is computed .",
    "the differential vacuum stress in not uniform on each wall , and , in order to avoid issues with divergences , the differential force is integrated over the face .",
    "how these nonuniformities might affect experiments is unknown .",
    "the sign of the casimir force depends on the magnetic and electric properties of the materials .",
    "if it were possible to arbitrarily choose material properties , repulsive forces could be obtained in a parallel plate geometry , for example , by choosing one plate to be a perfect conductor ( @xmath14 and the other plate as a perfect magnetic material ( @xmath15  for all frequencies , real and imaginary , with a vacuum in between@xcite .",
    "other choices have also been suggested , however , none have been implemented experimentally , and it appears they all violate fundmental requirements about @xmath16  and @xmath13  for real materials that arise from causality.conditions@xcite .",
    "it has been suggested but not verified that in curved space - time , atoms in certain intense electric fields may exhibit repulsive forces@xcite .",
    "we consider a variety of systems whose function is based on existing calculations of the properties of the ground state of the quantum vacuum .",
    "several different potentially interesting applications are considered in @xcite  no experimental investigations have yet been conducted on most of these systems .",
    "we consider the forces and energy balance in several simple structures with : 1 . moving parallel plates ; 2 . moving plates inserted in rectangular cavities , and 3 .",

    "no net work is done , and there is no net change in the vacuum energy .",
    "consider an alternative cycle that several investigators have proposed in order to extract energy from the vacuum fluctuations : after the plates have reached the point of minimum separation , slide the upper plate laterally until it no longer is opposite the lower plate @xmath26 , eliminating the normal casimir force , then raise the upper plate to its original height , and slide it laterally over the lower fixed plate @xmath17 .",
    "finally we allow the plates to come together as before , extracting energy from the vacuum fluctuations and doing mechanical work .",
    "if no energy were expended in moving the plate laterally , then this cycle would indeed result in net positive work equal to the energy extracted from the vacuum .",

    ", the lateral force would be an easily measurable 31 nanonewtons .",
    "this structure is analogous to the electrostatic comb drive that is used extensively in mems ( microelectromechanical systems ) devices .",
    "one key operational difference between the casimir and electrostatic drives is that the casimir force drive always yields an inward or attractive force , whereas the voltage on the electrostatic comb drive can be reversed in polarity , reversing the direction of the force .",
    "another difference is that the casimir force comb drive requires no electrical actuation .",
    "the mechanical behavior of the parallel plate comb configurations is determined by the negative energy density that arises when @xmath20 .",
    "if we consider cavities that have dimensions in orthogonal directions that are within about a factor of about 3 of each other , then we can have regions with positive or negative energy density and can obtain both attractive and repulsive average forces on sliding plates .",

    "we can compute the average force required to insert this moveable plate . if we assume that no energy is dissipated within the perfectly conducting plate during insertion and that the vacuum energy density is altered only in the region within the cavity as we insert the plate , then the change in vacuum energy is equal to minus the average force @xmath44 present during insertion of the movable plate times the distance @xmath18 . defining @xmath45 as the vacuum energy of a rectangular cavity with sides @xmath46",

    "inserting a plane into a cavity is an interesting operation since it does manifest , at least in theory , a repulsive force on the movable element .",

    "whenever there is an inhomogeneous vacuum energy density , there will a net force on a polarizable neutral particle given by @xmath76  local changes in mode density and therefore vacuum energy density are induced by the presence of curved surfaces , and , depending on whether the curvature is positive or negative , the force between the surface and the particle may be repulsive or attractive @xcite .",
    "the simplest example of a surface altering the vacuum modes is a perfectly conducting , infinite wall .  the change in the vacuum field energy due to the wall produces in this case the well - known casimir - polder interaction : for sufficiently large distances @xmath7 from the wall .",
    "the interaction potential is @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the static polarizability of the ( ground - state ) atom .",
    "this effect has been accurately verified in the elegant experiments of sukenik _ et al _ in which he measured the deflection of an atomic beam near a surface@xcite .  in this experiment ,",
    "the particles are actually passed between the surfaces of a wedge consisting of two conducting planes that intersect at an angle @xmath79 radians .",
    "the stress - energy tensor @xmath80 is not constant in this region , as it is between two parallel plates , but @xmath81 increases as one moves closer to the point of intersection , at which there is a singularity .  in the experiment , only the effect of the force approximately normal to the surfaces was measured .",
    "as one might expect , there is also a radial force on a particle at a distance @xmath82 and at an angle @xmath83 from the intersection that tends to accelerate the particle toward the intersection provided the static polarizability @xmath84 is positive@xcite:@xmath85 for the case of @xmath86 we have a particle near a plane and recover the usual casimir - polder force .",
    "the tangential force in the @xmath87 direction vanishes along this midline .",
    "note that there would be a torque on a permanent dipole in this wedge .",
    "there are many geometries for which the stress - energy tensor has not been computed as a function of position , and we do not know what the forces on a charged or polarizable particle in the vacuum might be .",
    "consider for example , the forces on a particle within a closed rectangular cavity , where the kinetic energy of the particle is much less than the change in vacuum energy due to the surfaces .  very near any surface , away from edges and other walls",
    ", one might expect the particle to experience the usual casimir - polder force .",
    "in other regions of the cavity , the forces are not know since calculations of the stress - energy tensor have not been done without averaging over the entire volume .",
    "what is the equilibrium state of a group of atoms or particles in a region of altered vacuum energy ?",
    "for example , assume we have a number of particles in a metal sphere or a metal box in which the vacuum modes have been altered from the free field modes .",
    "what is the equilibrium distribution of these particles ?  since there is a non - homogeneous vacuum field , the particles will experience forces .",
    "will there be some vacuum damping that gives them a terminal velocity ?  will the particles congregate in a region of the lowest energy ?",
    "will they bounce off the walls and give some kind of force on the walls .",
    "are these vacuum forces negligible , except at very low temperatures ?",
    "the motion of one particle inside a box or sphere would be interesting .",
    "does the interaction provide a window into vacuum energy so that we can make two reservoirs to operate an engine ? ?  if a hole is put in one of the sides of the box , what happens ?",
    "there is one calculation that suggests that very high energy particles observed in space may derive their kinetic energy from a long term acceleration due to the stochastic vacuum field@xcite .",
    "consider the conditions for which we would expect a medium , such as a dielectric slab , to experience a torque in the vacuum .",
    "if we view the origin of a vacuum torque as the transfer of the angular momentum of zero - point photons to the medium , then it is clear that  to have a torque we need to have a geometrical configuration in which the vacuum energy depends on the angular orientation of the medium .",
    "this requirement can not be met with a single object , even if it is not isotropic .",
    "however , two plates separated by a distance @xmath7 that are birefringent would break the rotational symmetry of the vacuum and be expected to experience a torque .",
    "this torque has indeed been calculated , and compared to the attractive casimir force between the plates@xcite .  from dimensional grounds the torque  between two thick plates ( thickness@xmath88@xmath88separation ) of area @xmath71 goes",
    "as @xmath89 where enk has derived an expression for the dimensionless number @xmath90 which is determined by the square of the difference of the refractive indices , and has a typical value of about @xmath91  the torque , which appears measurable , varies as @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the angle between the two optic axes .",
    "the dielectrics tend to rotate in opposite directions so the total angular momentum transfer from the vacuum is zero .",
    "one of the potentially most important configurations from the technological viewpoint involves vacuum forces on semiconductor surfaces .",
    "the casimir force for a conducting material depends on the plasma frequency , beyond which the material tends to act like a transparent medium .  for parallel plates separated by a distance @xmath7 the usual casimir force",
    "is reduced by a factor of approximately @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the wavelength corresponding to the plasma frequency of the material@xcite .  since the plasma frequency is proportional to the carrier density , it is possible to tune the plasma frequency in a semiconductor , for example , by illumination or by temperature , or by the application of a voltage bias .  in principle",
    "it should be possible to build a casimir switch that is activated by light , a device that would be useful in optical switching systems .",
    "a very interesting measurement of the casimir force between a flat surface of borosilicate glass and a surface covered with a film of amorphous silicon was done in 1979 by arnold et al@xcite  they observed an increase in the casimir force when the semiconductor was exposed to light .",
    "this experiment has yet to be repeated with modern methods and materials .  as a first step , chen et al",
    "have measured used an afm to measure the force between a single si crystal and a 200 @xmath12 diameter gold coated sphere , and found good agreement with theory using the lizshitz formalism@xcite .",
    "it is possible , albeit impractical , to conceive of a vacuum spacecraft that operates by pushing on the quantum vacuum@xcite .  with a suitable trajectory",
    ", the motion of a mirror in vacuum can excite the quantized vacuum electromagnetic field with the creation of real photons .",
    "this possibility was first noticed in 1970 , when moore considered the effect of an uncharged one dimensional boundary surface in vacuum that moved , with the very interesting prediction that it should be possible to generate real photons from a suitable motion@xcite@xcite .",
    "this effect , referred to as the dynamic or adiabatic casimir effect , has been reviewed but not verified experimentally @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "energy conservation requires the existence of a radiation reaction force working against the motion of the mirror @xcite , and this force can result in a net acceleration of the mirror .",
    "the vacuum field exerts a force on the moving mirror that tends to damp the motion .",
    "this dissipative force may be understood as the mechanical effect of the emission of radiation induced by the motion of the mirror .",
    "the energy expended moving the mirror against the radiative force goes into electromagnetic radiation .",
    "the casimir drive spacecraft is not suggested as practical way to build a spacecraft , but to illustrate another potential role of the quantum vacuum .",
    "perhaps a more clever quantum drive will some day become practical or other uses of the dynamic casimir effect will arise .",
    "physicists have explored various means of locomotion depending on the density of the medium and the size of the moving object .",
    "it would be interesting to find an optimum method for moving in the quantum vacuum .",
    "unfortunately we currently have no simple way to mathematically explore various simple possibilities .",
    "the are many potential ways in which the ground state of the vacuum electromagnetic field might be engineered for use in technological applications , a few of which we have mentioned here .",
    "as the technology to fabricate small devices improves , as the theoretical capability of calculating quantum vacuum effects increases , it will be interesting to see which possibilities prove to be useful and which just remain curiosities , and which limit the performance of mems .  in a way the situation is reminiscent of electricity in the 1600s , when faraday was asked of what use is electricity ? , and answered `` of what use is a new born baby ? '' .",
    "we are not very good at predicting the development of technology .  in the 1980 s many thought",
    "ai would revolutionize the world , but it did nt .  in the 1960s ,",
    "manufacturers were hard put to think of any reason why an individual would want a home computer and today we wonder how we ever survived without them .",
