    "the hard spectrum of the x - ray background , which peaks at @xmath9@xmath10  kev , implies the existence of a large population of obscured active galactic nuclei ( agn ) @xcite . finding and understanding these obscured agn is crucial to understanding the accretion history of the universe .",
    "these agn are predicted to be particularly bright in the mid  infrared , as soft x - ray and ultraviolet emission is absorbed by the intervening material and re - emitted by dust . with _ iso _ , @xcite reported elevated mid  infrared emission from obscured agn , and @xcite found the majority of _ iso_detected agn to be obscured .    _",
    "spitzer _ can test these ideas about the obscuration of agn and the interplay of the infrared and x - ray backgrounds . in this letter , by studying the chandra deep field south ( cdfs ) , we present a first look at the _ spitzer _ mid  infrared properties of agn .",
    "we present deep new observations of the cdfs at @xmath0  obtained with the multiband imaging photometer for spitzer ( mips ) @xcite .",
    "these data were obtained with guaranteed time under program 81 ; the relevant aors are 8950528 , 8951296 , 8954112 , 8957696 , 8958208 , 8958464 , 8958976 , 8959488 , 8960000 , 8960512 , 8961024 , and 8961536 .",
    "slow scan  map mode was used , achieving an average integration of @xmath11  s. the data were reduced using the dat package of the mips instrument team @xcite .",
    "the resulting mosaic completely overlaps the @xmath12  by @xmath13  chandra field .",
    "the @xmath14 completeness limit , determined by adding artificial sources , is @xmath15  mjy @xcite .",
    "this flux limit is comparable to the @xmath16 noise , which , scaling from @xcite , is @xmath17  mjy at the cdfs exposure depth ( accounting for detector and confusion noise @xcite . )",
    "thus , the full mosaic is one of the deepest , widest ",
    "field @xmath0   maps yet obtained .",
    "sources were extracted from the @xmath0  mosaic as described by @xcite . in the @xmath18  arcmin@xmath19 region having x - ray exposure times exceeding @xmath20  megaseconds , we detect @xmath21 @xmath0  sources brighter than the @xmath14 completeness limit . in the @xmath22  arcmin@xmath19 region",
    "having @xmath23  ms x - ray coverage , we detect @xmath24 such @xmath0  sources .",
    "( the x - ray depth of coverage varies across the field because the @xmath25 observations comprising the full chandra exposure have different roll angles . )",
    "two papers currently in preparation will publish @xmath0  fluxes for @xmath26 x - ray sources in cdfs @xcite ; most of these sources are within the main sample of this letter .",
    "the chandra 1  megasecond cdfs is one of the deepest x - ray observations to date .",
    "two reductions and source catalogs exist in the literature .",
    "the first is by the cdfs team , who find @xmath27 sources detected jointly by sextractor and wavdetect ( giacconi et  al .",
    "2002 , hereafter g02 ) .",
    "the second is the cdf north team s reduction , using the same processing and source extraction as for the north ( alexander et  al .",
    "2003 , hereafter a03 ) .",
    "their source catalog has @xmath28 sources .",
    "a03 compare these two catalogs , finding @xmath29 sources in common . because the _ spitzer _ cosmological surveys will also target the cdf north , in this paper we use the a03 catalog , to facilitate future comparisons between the north and south fields .",
    "the astrometry of the cdfs chandra catalogs is excellent .",
    "a03 registered their astrometry to the frame of the r - band eso imaging survey @xcite ; the median separation between x - ray and r  band positions is @xmath30  ( a03 ) . using the same r  band catalog , we registered our @xmath0  mosaic to their astrometric frame by adding a @xmath31  global shift .",
    "the other catalog used in this paper is that of szokoly et  al .",
    "2004 ( hereafter s04 ) , who present secure spectroscopic redshifts for @xmath32 x - ray  selected sources in the cdfs .",
    "they classify their sources in two ways : based on optical spectra , and based on x - ray luminosity and hardness .",
    "we select hard band ( @xmath2@xmath3  kev ) detections in the cdfs from the catalog of a03 ; there are @xmath33 . selecting hard band detections ( rather than soft or any - band detections )",
    "reduces contamination from non  active galaxies . to further maximize the agn fraction",
    ", we require the hard  band flux to exceed @xmath34  erg  s@xmath5  @xmath6 , which reduces the sample to @xmath1 sources .",
    "this is our main sample .",
    "none of these sources is classified by s04 as a star or a non  active galaxy .",
    "almost all of these sources are likely to be agn ( see figure  2 of @xcite ) ; 65 have been identified as agn by their x - ray hardness and luminosity ( which requires a known redshift ) , and 39 have been identified as agn by optical spectroscopy .    because the soft band of chandra ( @xmath20@xmath2  kev ) is more sensitive than the hard band , sources in our main sample generally have a well  measured soft - band flux or a well  constrained limit .    for the main sample ,",
    "we seek redshifts as available from s04 .",
    "s04 targeted optical counterparts to x - ray sources from the g02 catalog ( and thus associate redshifts with g02 x - ray sources ) , whereas we use the a03 x - ray catalog . as a result , it is necessary to associate the a03 and s04 catalogs , which we do by matching sources whose coordinates are separated by less than @xmath2 .",
    "such a large separation is necessary to match sources at large off  axis angles , where chandra centroiding is difficult .",
    "since the only spectra in the s04 catalog are counterparts to x - ray sources , the source density is small ( @xmath35 arcmin@xmath36 ) , so the probability of false matches with the a03 x - ray catalog is small . in the main sample ,",
    "@xmath37 agn have secure redshifts and optical classifications .    for each x - ray source in our main sample , we search for a @xmath0  counterpart from our catalog .",
    "to claim detection , we require the fractional flux uncertainty to be @xmath38 and the coordinates ( x - ray and @xmath0  ) to be offset by @xmath39 .",
    "( this small separation is sufficient to match sources over most of the field , and is necessary to prevent false matches , since the @xmath0  source density is high . )",
    "no x - ray source has multiple @xmath0  sources within the permitted offset .",
    "given the @xmath0  source density reported above , for the main sample of @xmath1 x - ray sources , by chance we expect @xmath40 false @xmath0  counterpart using the p - statistic ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the result of the counterpart search is that @xmath41 of the @xmath1 sources in the main sample have @xmath0  counterparts . for sources not detected at @xmath0  ,",
    "we take the flux upper limit to be the @xmath14 completeness limit ( @xmath15  mjy ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : plate ] displays the section of the @xmath0  mosaic that overlaps the chandra field , with the main sample x - ray positions overlaid .",
    "agn are traditionally classified by optical spectroscopy .",
    "however , for distant sources , nuclear emission can be overwhelmed by stellar emission , especially for low ",
    "luminosity agn @xcite .",
    "obscuration or lack of the narrow lines may also play a role @xcite .",
    "consequently , @xmath42 of x - ray selected agn in the cdfs are not classified as active by optical spectroscopy ( s04 ) .",
    "because of this , many authors have argued that x - rays are a better way to _",
    "select _ agn than optical spectroscopic surveys .",
    "further , x - rays may be a more effective way to _ classify _ agn @xcite .",
    "agn with harder x - ray spectra are generally measured to have thicker columns of absorbing gas than do x - ray  soft agn .",
    "similarly , in unification models , optical type  2 agn are drawn from the same population of objects as type  1 agn , but they are viewed through thicker columns of obscuring gas and dust . thus , x - ray hardness can estimate the obscuration of agn when optical spectroscopy can not .",
    "figure  [ fig : optxray ] compares optical and x - ray classification of the cdfs agn .",
    "the x - axis is an indicator of spectral hardness : the ratio of the @xmath2@xmath3  kev  flux to the @xmath20@xmath2  kev  flux , which we define as h / s @xmath43 @xmath44[flux(@xmath2@xmath3  kev)/flux(@xmath20@xmath2  kev ) ] .",
    "sources with broad emission lines ( optically  selected type  1 seyferts and qsos ) cluster toward the x - ray  soft side of the figure .",
    "these objects are well  separated in x - ray hardness from the sources with optical high  excitation narrow emission lines ( optically  selected type  2 agn ) , which span a range of higher x - ray hardness .",
    "this clear separation validates the use of the hard / soft x - ray flux ratio h / s as a tool to classify agn , as also found by @xcite .",
    "indeed , s04 also used x - ray hardness to classify these cdfs agn , using the same chandra data and very similar energy bands to this work , but a counts ratio rather than a flux ratio ; their division between type  1 and type  2 agn lies at h / s@xmath45 in our figure  [ fig : optxray ] , and agrees well with the boundary between optically classified type  1 and 2 agn .    in figure  [ fig:24hs ] , we now examine how h / s affects the behavior of the @xmath0  to x - ray flux ratio , defined as 24/x @xmath46[(@xmath0  flux density , mjy)/(@xmath2@xmath3  kev  flux , erg  s@xmath5  @xmath6 ) ] .",
    "there is a factor of @xmath47 spread in both the h / s and 24/x flux ratios .",
    "the spread in h / s reflects the range of x - ray hardness found in agn .",
    "the reasons for the spread in the 24/x flux ratio we discuss below .",
    "the horizontal line in figures  [ fig : optxray ] and  [ fig:24hs ] is the 24/x color of a source with hard x - ray flux at the sample cutoff , and @xmath0  flux at the @xmath14 completeness limit .",
    "since the sample is x - ray selected , we are reasonably complete to colors above the line , while we may be missing sources with colors below the line ( because the @xmath0  flux may fall below the detection limit . )",
    "figures  [ fig : optxray ] and  [ fig:24hs ] show that overall , the @xmath0  @xmath48-@xmath3  kev  flux ratio does * not * depend on the hardness of the agn .",
    "there is no global trend of the 24/x flux ratio with h / s . nor does the 24/x ratio differ significantly between the x - ray  classified hard and soft agn in figure  [ fig:24hs ] , nor between the optically  classified type  1 and type  2 agn in figure  [ fig : optxray ] .",
    "@xcite found that @xmath7@xmath49  kev xmm sources were twice as likely to have @xmath50  counterparts compared with @xmath20@xmath2  kev  sources ; however , this result was based on just @xmath51 ir  detected hard x - ray sources .",
    "the authors used the ir / x - ray spectral slope to classify sources as type  1 or type  2 agn or dominated by star formation , and then applied these classifications to estimate the agn contribution to the ir background .",
    "( they did find some x - ray ",
    "soft agn with high ir / x ratios , which they attributed to host galaxy contamination . ) as discussed above , our full sample ( figure  [ fig:24hs ] ) contradicts the @xcite result that the mid  ir flux of agn is a strong function of hardness .",
    "to understand the behavior of the 24/x flux ratio , in figure  [ fig : templates ] we present the flux ratios predicted by local agn templates with a range of obscuration @xcite .",
    "these templates were obtained by interpolating nuclear infrared photometric data of a sample of 33 seyferts .",
    "each infrared sed was normalized to the absorption  corrected hard x - ray luminosity , and then averaged within bins of absorbing n@xmath52 . using these empirical templates , @xcite derived the contribution of agn to the mid - ir background and successfully matched the observed fraction .    in figure",
    "[ fig : templates ] , at @xmath53 as the obscuring column increases , the predicted 24/x ratio increases ( since the @xmath0  flux rises due to reprocessing and the @xmath2@xmath3  kev  flux falls dramatically due to absorption . )",
    "this effect grows weaker with increasing redshift because of k - corrections : as the @xmath2@xmath3  kev  band samples progressively higher rest  frame energies , it is less absorbed for a given column .",
    "generally in the deep x - ray surveys , type  1 agn have @xmath44n@xmath54  , whereas type  2 have @xmath55n@xmath56  @xcite .    a basic conclusion from figure  [ fig : templates ]",
    "is that local agn with @xmath57  can not produce 24/x @xmath58 for @xmath59 . when x - ray ",
    "soft agn are observed to have such high 24/x ratios ( as seen for a minority of sources in figure  [ fig:24hs ] ) , this suggests that the @xmath0  flux is dominated by star formation in the host galaxy , not by accretion .",
    "( some of the harder sources with high 24/x may also be star ",
    "formation dominated . ) using this rule of thumb , we see that star formation does not dominate most of the sources in figure  [ fig:24hs ] ; their 24/x ratios are consistent with agn power .",
    "( see also @xcite . )    to disentangle the effects of redshift and compare the distant agn to local templates , in figure  [ fig : z7 ] we plot all hard ",
    "band detected agn in the redshift range @xmath60 .",
    "this range encompasses the prominent @xmath61 and @xmath62 redshift spikes ( s04 ) , which allows us to restrict the redshift range ( and thus the spread in k - correction ) while maximizing the sample size .",
    "we first examine the x - ray ",
    "soft agn in figure  [ fig : z7 ] .",
    "their 24/x ratios agree well with the local templates , which predict 24/x@xmath63 for agn with @xmath44 n@xmath64  at this redshift .",
    "the spread in template seds predicts a scatter in the flux ratio of about @xmath65 in log units , which is consistent with the data .",
    "we now examine the 24/x ratio for the hard ( h / s@xmath66 ) agn .",
    "we propose two possible interpretations of the trends in figure  [ fig : z7 ] :    * there is no trend of 24/x with x - ray hardness in figure  [ fig : z7 ] .",
    "the distribution simply reflects the scatter seen in figure  [ fig:24hs ] .",
    "* the 24/x ratio does indeed increase with hardness in this subsample , as expected from reprocessing : h / s@xmath67 have higher 24/x than the h / s@xmath68 agn .",
    "however , there are several strange exceptions : agn with very hard x - ray flux ratios and very low 24/x .",
    "this population of x - ray  hard agn with low 24/x is also seen in the full redshift sample ( figure  [ fig:24hs ] ) , where there are @xmath69 such sources .",
    "their 24/x ratios are @xmath20@xmath70 dex lower than predicted by the templates .",
    "these sources are surprising within the unification paradigm : the hardness ratios indicate large column density , which unification scenarios associate with a dusty molecular torus ; this column should absorb the x - ray radiation , thus increasing the 24/x ratio relative to lower ",
    "column agn .",
    "additionally , dust in the torus should absorb a large fraction of the uv continuum and re - emit that energy in the mid  infrared , further increasing 24/x . in the x - ray ",
    "hard @xmath0  faint sources in question , this expectation is not observed .",
    "thus , these sources merit further investigation ; there may be a real difference between these agn and local agn ( for example in their dust properties or absorbing geometries . ) though the average 24/x value for the x - ray  hard agn may be higher than it appears in figure  [ fig:24hs ] due to selection effects , the sources with low 24/x still beg explanation .    while the h / s x - ray flux ratio is a useful diagnostic ,",
    "the more fundamental parameter is the amount of obscuring column . for the very hard ( h / s@xmath71 ) agn with known redshifts",
    ", we examine the x - ray spectral information derived by @xcite .",
    "ten of the @xmath72 spectra are fit by @xmath44n@xmath73  , while only @xmath7 fits require @xmath74n@xmath75  .",
    "those five nearly compton  thick agn have 24/x values spanning @xmath76 to @xmath77 , which is the same range populated by the other agn ( soft and hard ) .",
    "could we have missed the majority of the highly obscured , high 24/x agn ? since compton ",
    "thick agn should be fainter at @xmath2@xmath3  kev  than less obscured agn , it is quite possible that the most obscured agn are the faintest in our survey .",
    "the faint ( hard flux @xmath78  erg  s@xmath5  @xmath6 ) agn are less likely to have known spectroscopic redshifts and reliable x - ray spectral fits .",
    "since they are faint in the hard band and undetected in the soft , they have lower limits on h / s that permit but do not require extreme hardness .",
    "several such objects have high 24/x .",
    "thus , these agn are good candidates for being highly obscured .",
    "if they are , they would populate the high h / s , high 24/x region of figure  [ fig:24hs ] where obscured agn are expected , but not seen .",
    "we present the first look at the @xmath0  to x - ray colors of x - ray  selected agn .",
    "the expectation that harder agn should be relatively brighter at @xmath0   is not confirmed .",
    "rather , there is large scatter and no trend in 24/x color with x - ray hardness in our sample of @xmath1 agn ( with dynamic range of 100 in both flux ratios ) .",
    "in addition , the 24/x colors of optically - identified type  1 and  2 agn are indistinguishable . in a narrow redshift slice ( picked to minimize differential k - corrections )",
    ", we see hints that 24/x may increase with x - ray hardness ( though this effect is not seen in the full sample ) .",
    "however , in both the restricted  redshift and full samples , we identify agn with unusual colors : very hard x - ray flux ratios and surprisingly low 24/x ratios . these agn merit further investigation .",
    "x - ray spectral fits to @xmath72 of the x - ray  hard agn find column densities of @xmath79  , most toward the lower end of this range .",
    "thus , only a handful are nearly compton  thick ( n@xmath80 ) .",
    "even these sources do not distinguish themselves in 24/x color from the lower  column agn .",
    "thus , while this initial survey has not yet confirmed expectations for a population of x - ray  obscured , infrared  bright agn , we have raised new questions : what explains the factor of @xmath81 range in @xmath0  to @xmath2@xmath3  kev  flux ratio ?",
    "why do many of the hardest agn have very low 24/x ratios compared with local templates ? and if hard x - ray selection and @xmath0  follow ",
    "up finds few compton  thick agn , what is a better way to search ? future surveys and follow  up observations are clearly needed to address these questions .",
    "we thank all who made _ spitzer _ a reality .",
    "we also thank the cdf north team for making available chandra fits images of the cdfs .",
