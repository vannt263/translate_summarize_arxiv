    "one of the major results of the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( iras ) mission came from its low resolution spectrometer ( lrs ) with the detection of a new broad feature around 21  @xmath0 m @xcite in the spectra of stars that have gone through the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase .",
    "the existence of this feature was not recognized at once , because it is weak in the first object in which it was observed , iras  22272 + 5435 , which was listed in the lrs atlas as having a low - temperature continuum and silicate absorption @xcite . in the first paper about this feature ,",
    "four sources are listed ( namely iras 07134 + 1005 , 23304 + 6147 , 22272 + 5435 , and 04296 + 3429 ) ; subsequent ground - based ( united kingdom infrared telescope ) , airborne ( kuiper airborne observatory ) , and space - based ( infrared space observatory ) observations confirmed those detections and also added new members to the group of 21-@xmath0 m emitters .",
    "observations with the _ infrared space observatory _ ( iso ) led to conclude that the feature actually peaks around 20.1  @xmath0 m @xcite , although it is still today commonly referred to as the 21  @xmath0 m feature .",
    "the feature has been detected almost exclusively in c - rich proto - planetary nebulae ( ppne ) , intermediate - mass stars ( 18 m@xmath1 ) transiting from the agb to the planetary nebula ( pn ) stage .    during the agb phase ,",
    "stars lose most of their initial mass , with mass loss rates ranging from 10@xmath2 up to 10@xmath3  m@xmath1  yr@xmath4 .",
    "the agb stellar atmospheres are subject to periodic he - flashes , which imply that enriched material produced by nucleosynthesis in the bottom layers is carried to the surface . if this dredge - up of the star is efficient enough , the chemistry of the cooled material in the circumstellar envelope ( cse )",
    "will be based on c rather than o , as normally expected .",
    "depending on their @xmath5c@xmath6/[$]o@xmath6 $ ] ratio , we can then distinguish between o - rich and c - rich cses .",
    "when the star has evolved past the tip of the agb , the intense mass loss that characterizes the agb has ceased , but the dust and gas in the cse is typically so thick that the star can not be detected at optical wavelengths .",
    "the expansion and subsequent dilution of the envelope leads to the optical detection of a post - agb star , which typically has a double - peaked spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , as the result of the radiation from the central source and its cse .",
    "the central star then evolves towards hotter temperatures , while its cse continues to expand and dilute .",
    "if the central star does not evolve too slowly , a few thousand years after the agb phase it is hot enough to ionize its cse ( t@xmath7 @xmath82030@xmath9 k ) , which can lead to the destruction of molecules and even dust grains .",
    "the point at which the ionization of the cse occurs is in fact considered as the beginning of the planetary nebula phase .",
    "all of the objects showing the 21  @xmath0 m feature are c - rich and metal poor with enhanced abundances of s - processed elements @xcite , and typically with f ",
    "g spectral type . besides the unidentified feature",
    ", their mid - ir spectra typically show a broad feature around 30  @xmath0 m that is usually attributed to mgs @xcite and has been found to consist of two features centered at 26 and 33 @xmath0 m , though such a distinction is not observed in all sources @xcite .    as of this writing",
    ", 16 ppne are known to exhibit the unidentified 21-@xmath0 m feature @xcite . besides these sources , the feature has been detected weakly in three pne @xcite and three agb stars @xcite . it has not been observed in iras 01005 + 7910 @xcite , a c - rich ppn with a hot central star ( b0 i ) that has already started to ionize its circumstellar shell @xcite .",
    "other hot post - agb stars showing features of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pah ) in their mid - ir spectra and therefore likely to be c - rich do not exhibit the feature either @xcite .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that the carrier must form during the agb phase or very early afterwards , and is probably easily destroyed as the radiation field of the central star hardens .",
    "since its first detection , many different molecules have been considered as possible carriers of the 21-@xmath0 m feature .",
    "the connection with the c - rich nature of the envelopes makes it obvious to take into account c - bearing molecules , for instance tic , doped - sic , pah , hydrogenated amorphous carbon ( hac ) , and fullerenes . yet , non c - bearing molecules have been indicated as possible carriers as well , for example sis@xmath10 , feo , fe@xmath10o@xmath11 , and fe@xmath11o@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the main issues that arise with almost all of the proposed carriers are the presence of secondary features that are not detected in the astrophysical spectra , or the anomalous abundances necessary to account for the observed intensity of the feature .    in this paper , we present observations obtained within a program aimed at characterizing the dust emission in objects transiting from the agb to the pn stage with a ",
    "g spectral types , as a follow - up to our project presented in @xcite , which focused on sources with hot central stars ( b spectral type ) .",
    "while the whole sample of transition targets will be presented in a separate paper along with data from other spitzer programs ( hart et al , in preparation ) , here we will focus on three new sources that show the unidentified 21-@xmath0 m feature .",
    "these are the only targets in our sample , where we find evidence for this feature .",
    "the new observations presented in this paper were carried out with the infrared array camera ( irac ; * ? ? ? * ) and the infrared spectrograph ( irs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on - board the spitzer space telescope @xcite , within program 50116 ( pi : g. fazio ) in march and april 2009 .",
    "the irs had four modules with different spectral resolutions .",
    "the short - low ( sl ) and long - low ( ll ) modules covered the 5.214.5 and 14.038.0 @xmath0 m ranges respectively , with spectral resolution r@xmath860120 .",
    "the short - high ( sh ) and long - high ( lh ) modules covered the 9.919.6 and 18.737.2 @xmath0 m ranges with r@xmath8600 .",
    "our spectral data were typically acquired in low resolution mode .",
    "targets with iras fluxes that would imply saturation with the irs at longer wavelengths were observed in low resolution only between 5 and 14  @xmath0 m ( sl modules ) , while the 1038  @xmath0 m range was observed in high spectral resolution ( sh and lh modules ) . in the latter case ,",
    "a dedicated background observation was also performed for each target .",
    "for the three sources presented here , low resolution observations were performed for iras 13245 - 5036 and 15482 - 5741 , while low and high resolution data were collected for iras 14429 - 4539 .",
    "iras 13245 - 5036 was not centered on the sl slit , therefore only ll data are available for this target .",
    "basic calibrated data were retrieved from the spitzer web archive .",
    "the observations of iras 13245 - 5036 were processed with the 18.7.0 pipeline by the spitzer science center ( ssc ) , while version 18.18.0 was applied to 14429 - 4539 and 15482 - 5741 .",
    "the data were reduced following the standard recipe in the on - line irs cookbook : the background subtraction was performed from the off - target observations for low resolution data ( i.e. , when one module is on the target , the other one is observing off - source ) and from the dedicated background observation for the high resolution data sets .",
    "the spectra were cleaned using irsclean , extracted and averaged together in smart @xcite .",
    "the high spectral resolution data were extracted over the full slit , while the optimal extraction algorithm @xcite was applied to the sl and ll observations .",
    "the irac observations were performed in high dynamic range mode with a small dither pattern , as very extended emission was not expected . in this observing mode ,",
    "two sets of bcds are created by default , corresponding to a long and a short exposure ; in our case the exposures were respectively 12s and 0.6s long .",
    "all of the irac bcds retrieved from the spitzer archive were processed with the s18.18.0 pipeline .",
    "the bcds were treated for artifact correction with the idl code available from the ssc web site and then multi - frame aperture photometry was performed with the mosaicker and point source extractor ( mopex ) using a 10-pixel aperture and 12 - 20 pixel annulus , which is the standard for the irac calibration . as the irac",
    "absolute flux calibrators are known to about 23% , and irac repeatability is at about the 1.5% level , we assume in the following 5% as our photometric error . since our targets are quite bright for irac , the photometry extraction was performed on the short frames , to avoid any saturation effect , which was evident in iras 14429 - 4539 at 8.0  @xmath0 m even in the short frames .",
    "the flux densities are listed in table  [ tab : irac ] .",
    ".photometry of our targets obtained with irac .",
    "the absolute accuracy is about 5% . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the continuum obtained as a combination of gray bodies is typically unable to properly isolate the feature at 21  @xmath0 m , because of the substantial contributions from the features in the 2633 @xmath0 m range , which are often blended together .",
    "emission in the 5.518  @xmath0 m range is present in all of the targets , as shown in the _ left - side _ close - ups in figures  [ fig : old1 ]  and  [ fig : old2 ] . after converting the spectra into w  m@xmath13  @xmath0m@xmath4 ,",
    "we integrated the continuum - subtracted spectra to estimate the flux in the 5.518  @xmath0 m and 18.523.5  @xmath0 m ranges ( the exact edges of the ranges were adapted to the emission in each source , turning out in differences of about 0.3  @xmath0 m ) . to assess the emission in the 21-@xmath0 m feature",
    ", a straight baseline was fitted to its red and blue edges and then subtracted before performing the integration , as shown in two examples in figure  [ fig : baseline ] .",
    "the emission in the 518  @xmath0 m range is mostly due to pahs but contributions from hacs are possible , while the 18.523.5  @xmath0 m range is obviously dominated by the 21-@xmath0 m feature . in figure",
    "[ fig : intensity ] , we plot the flux estimated in the 5.518  @xmath0 m bands , indicated as the sum of the pah 7 and 11  @xmath0 m bands , versus that in the 21-@xmath0 m feature .    as can be seen in the plot , a correlation between the fluxes in the two wavelength ranges is evident ; we can calculate a linear correlation coefficient of 0.79@xmath140.07 .",
    "an explanation for the correlation may be that the abundances of the hydrocarbons and of the carrier of the 21-@xmath0 m feature are linked together , possibly because of a common formation process and therefore the correlation would just reflect the different amounts of hydrocarbons and 21-@xmath0 m carriers produced in the cses .",
    "the colors of the dots in figure  [ fig : intensity ] are proportional to the temperatures of the central stars , as derived from their spectral classifications , and range from red ( coldest ) to blue ( hottest ) .",
    "no clear correlation is observed between the intensity of the features and the stellar temperature .    in principle , if the observed correlation were due only to a common excitation process for the molecules involved and then essentially to the hardening of the radiation field , we would expect to find a correlation with the temperature of the central star",
    ". there may be several reasons for this lack of correlation .",
    "for example , extinction effects can play a role .",
    "also , one of the explanations for the existence of the 21-@xmath0 m feature implies radiation - induced decomposition of large hac grains into smaller pahs @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the carrier of the 21-@xmath0 m feature would be a short - lived decomposition product .",
    "the efficiency of the processing of large grains would depend on both t@xmath15 and the location of the dust layer .",
    "a massive star will be hot enough to cause processing earlier than a low - mass star , with its dust still close to the central star .",
    "a low - mass star will reach the same temperature at a later age , with its dust farther away and will therefore need an even larger temperature to attain comparable processing .",
    "one of the main results of the iras mission was its discovery of the existence of a broad mid - ir feature around 20  @xmath0 m .",
    "the feature has been detected almost exclusively in the circumstellar envelopes of c - rich proto - pne , with a few weak detections in their precursors ( agb stars ) and successors ( pne ) .",
    "the nature of the feature is still unclear today , but it must be linked to the c - rich nature of the sources : its carriers are likely to be produced towards the very end of the agb and are easily destroyed by uv radiation .    in this paper",
    "we report about the detection of three new c - rich proto - pne that exhibit this unidentified feature through observations performed with the irs instrument on - board spitzer . besides the 21  @xmath0 m feature",
    ", our targets also show mid - ir bands from pahs and a broad feature around 30 @xmath0 m commonly attributed to mgs .",
    "as the dispersion of the dust formed during the agb creates a very extended shell around the central star , it can be expected that evidence for such large dust regions can be found in infrared images , but our irac observations do not point to any extended emission . by a combination of catalog data and our new observations , we reconstruct the seds of our targets and model them with the code dusty . with a r@xmath13 density distribution ,",
    "a good match of the observational points is possible , if the model assumes a circumstellar environment where the mass loss process has not been constant with time .",
    "the use of feo as carrier of the 21-@xmath0 m feature does not accurately reproduce the spectral shape of the feature .",
    "we have retrieved the infrared spectra of the other 21-@xmath0 m sources available in the iso and spitzer archives .",
    "a gray - body continuum has been subtracted from the spectra to enhance the features . after continuum subtraction",
    ", we have calculated the flux in the features from 5 to 18 @xmath0 m , due to hydrocarbons , and that in the 21-@xmath0 m feature , finding a clear correlation between them .",
    "we have not found any correlation with stellar temperatures .",
    "the correlation found between the 518 and 21-@xmath0 m fluxes can point to a common origin of the carriers of the features .",
