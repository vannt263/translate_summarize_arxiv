    "in the digital revolution , people are now employing various signal processing techniques and new sensing systems in general electronic products with ever - increasing resolution and fidelity .",
    "the conventional manners of sampling signals , images , videos , or other data obey the celebrated shannon s theorem , that requires to sample a signal at a sampling rate at least twice the highest frequency present in a signal ( so - called nyquist rate ) to retain signal information intact @xcite .",
    "the shannon s theorem solves the problem in theory perfectly , yet unfortunately it is not omnipotent . in many applications such as remote surveillance or spectroscopy , sampling in the result with nyquist rate",
    "is expensive , or even physically impossible .",
    "so as long as the recovery performance achieves an acceptable level , people want to build devices which are capable of acquiring samples at a necessary rate as low as possible . in some other applications , such as imaging system or video processing , sampling",
    "a large number of measurements seems feasible .",
    "however , because of the limited storage space and using of advanced compression techniques , people often discard the most received data , and just save a small amount of the compressed data ( e.g. , jepg ) .",
    "apparently it will waste lots of valuable sensing resources since the entire data are sampled at first .    aiming at solving above problems , the compressed sensing ( short for cs )",
    "theory @xcite has become one of the hottest research areas in signal processing since 2006 .",
    "the research of cs has been growing very fast and it focuses on acquiring and reconstructing sparse or compressible signals . by using cs , compressed measurements can be acquired directly and one may recover the original sparse or compressible signal faithfully even when the sampling rate is much lower than the nyquist rate .",
    "an @xmath0-length signal @xmath1 is regarded as sparse if @xmath1 has @xmath2 nonzero values and @xmath3 .",
    "compressible @xmath1 means that @xmath1 can be well - approximated by another sparse signal @xmath4 in certain domain @xmath5 by using only @xmath2 nonzero coefficients : @xmath6 .",
    "normally the traditional compression techniques preserve the values and locations of the largest coefficients , such as jpeg , jpeg2000 , mpeg . while cs has more efficient sensing or sampling protocols that capture the essential information content embedded in the original signal and",
    "obtain the condensed data straightforwardly .",
    "more precisely , these protocols are nonadaptive linear transforms , which can be represented by well - designed matrices , called _ sensing matrices _ @xmath7 . these matrices should be incoherent to the sparsifying matrix @xmath5 of the compressible signal . with the measurements and the sensing matrix , the process of exact reconstructing signals from a subset of measurements can be implemented by solving a nonlinear optimization problem . the approaches to solving the nonlinear problems are named _ reconstruction / recovery algorithms_. from a mathematical point of view , compressed sensing is also deemed as a technique of finding sparse solutions to underdetermined linear systems .    the cs theory is a revolution in both the theory of reliable signal sampling and physical design of sensors . since the original signal can be sensed from fewer linear projections rather than acquired in its initial domain , the _ sensing matrices _ play an important role in the cs framework .",
    "the property of the sensing matrices affects the number of necessary measurements and the recovery performance directly .",
    "early researchers proved that a random projection is one of the best solutions @xcite .",
    "the projection matrices are generated by orthogonalizing measured vectors uniformly and independently on a unit sphere .",
    "in addition , sensing matrices consisting of independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d ) entries drawn from a gaussian or bernoulli distribution also perform well in both theory and practice @xcite . though the problem has been solved in mathematics ,",
    "there still exist many obstacles to overcome .",
    "one main drawback of the pure random sensing matrices is that they require huge storage - memory , namely @xmath8 entries to recover a length-@xmath0 signal , and high computational cost for signal reconstruction .",
    "moreover , the difficulty of hardware implementation also makes them expensive in practice .    to simplify the sensing scheme , many structured sensing matrices have been proposed in recent years . in this paper , after explaining some terminologies such as restricted isometry property and coherence , we give an introduction to couples of existing structured sensing matrices , including subsampled incoherent bases , random toeplitz matrices , random demodulator matrices , random convolution matrices , structurally random matrices , convolutional matrices using sequences and some other structured sensing matrices .",
    "these matrices have special structures which equip them efficiency in the construction , calculation or hardware implementation . for many of them ,",
    "corresponding fast recovery algorithms have been developed by exploiting their specific structures .",
    "here we put our emphasis on how the structured matrices are generated and what are their recovery performances . based on these ,",
    "the number of measurements and the universality of different structure matrices are compared .",
    "the paper will help readers to understand the characteristics of popular sensing matrices well and may inspire them to explore or pursuit more efficient sensing schemes in the cs area .",
    "the remaining paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we describe the core concepts of this paper : sensing matrices , and introduce two prevalent criteria that examine the effectiveness of sensing matrices : restricted isometry property and coherence . in section 3 ,",
    "couples of structured sensing matrices are analyzed .",
    "the overview of applications is discussed in section 4 .",
    "finally , the prospects of structured sensing matrices are discussed in section 5 followed by the conclusions in section 6 .",
    "in our real world , normally the useful signals are not random .",
    "images , videos or voices often contain specific structures and strong correlation among pixels , frames or samples .",
    "these structures and correlations are the assumptions behind the sparse representation theory . given an @xmath0-dimensional signal @xmath1 , @xmath5 denotes the sparsifying transform basis for @xmath1 , where throughout this paper we assume that @xmath9 is an @xmath10 normalized unitary matrix satisfying @xmath11 .",
    "so @xmath1 can easily be decomposed by means of a linear superposition of @xmath2 elementary components : @xmath12 which can be rewritten in the form of matrix multiplication as @xmath13 where @xmath4 is a length @xmath0 sparse vertical vector with @xmath2 nonzero values , @xmath14 .",
    "typical transforms @xmath5 include discrete fourier transform ( dft ) , discrete cosine transform ( dct ) and discrete wavelet transform ( dwt ) . sometimes the number of nonzero values in @xmath4 is larger than @xmath2 .",
    "in this case people usually encode the most significant @xmath2 non - zero entries of @xmath4 and disregard the rest , which is also the core principle of the image compression standard jpeg ( using dct ) and jpeg2000 ( using dwt ) .    now assuming a length-@xmath0 signal @xmath15 as defined in ( [ eq : x = psif1 ] ) , the data acquisition process can be described as @xmath16 where the measurement @xmath17 represents an @xmath18 sampled vector , @xmath19 is an @xmath20 measurement / sensing matrix , @xmath21 .",
    "( [ eq : cs - measure - basic1 ] ) is the kernel equation of the sensing process .",
    "the sensing process with a random gaussian measurement matrix @xmath7 and a dct matrix @xmath5 is illustrated in figure [ fig : cs - diagram ] , in which there are four columns of @xmath5 that correspond to nonzero @xmath22 coefficients ; the measurement vector @xmath23 is a linear combination of these columns .",
    "the cs theory considers problems based on the fundamental equation ( [ eq : cs - measure - basic1 ] ) .",
    "these problems can be summarized as how to design efficient sensing matrix @xmath7 , and how to recover @xmath1 given @xmath23 and @xmath7 .",
    "+     here we focus on the problem of designing proper sensing matrices .",
    "conventionally , if @xmath2 entries in @xmath23 are more important than other entries , people may capture the signal energy roughly and recover the original signal from @xmath2 measurements , like what we do for recovering natural image from its frequency spectrum .",
    "however , in the cs framework the entries of @xmath1 are assumed sparse and randomly distributed , which means people do not know where the large entries locate . in this circumstance @xmath1",
    "is able to be recovered by exploiting the sparsity from @xmath24 measurements , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "because only partial @xmath24 measurements are captured to recover the original signal , a good sensing scheme should spread out the information of the non - zero entries into every measurement @xmath27 evenly , in case of losing significant information . follow this intuitive idea , people found that random projection is one of the best candidates as a sensing matrix @xcite .",
    "besides , if @xmath28 represents a gaussian or bernoulli random operator , @xmath15 can also be faithfully recovered from @xmath29 using nonlinear optimization approaches provided that @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "these early works made by d. donoho , e. cands , t. tao and romberg established the foundation of the cs theory .    from eq .",
    "( [ eq : cs - measure - basic1 ] ) an essential question might be raised instinctively : apart from the general random operators , what kinds of sensing matrices @xmath7 are capable to recover @xmath1 uniquely from measurements @xmath23 ?",
    "fortunately , two important criteria for evaluating proper operators were created to provide fundamental insights into the geometry of sensing matrices .",
    "the most well - known one is often referred as the restricted isometry property ( rip ) :    [ deft : rip ] an @xmath20 matrix @xmath31 is said to satisfy the rip with parameters @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) if @xmath34 where @xmath35 represents the set of all length-@xmath0 vectors with @xmath2 non - zero coefficients .    generally speaking ,",
    "rip requires the sensing matrix to act as a near isometry on the set of all @xmath2-sparse signals .",
    "it is consistent with the thought of spreading energy behind random sensing matrices .",
    "so measurement @xmath23 preserves the energy that does not shrink or expand too much comparing with the original signal @xmath1 .",
    "if @xmath36 satisfies the rip , many reconstruction algorithms can be used to recover any @xmath2-sparse signal @xmath4 from @xmath24 measurements @xmath37 , such as basis pursuit ( bp ) or matching pursuit recovery algorithms @xcite .",
    "in addition , rip guarantees the uniqueness of the reconstruction result @xmath4 , which does not hold automatically for some other rip - related property , such as the weaker statistical restricted isometry property ( strip ) @xcite .    because there is no existing algorithm for efficiently verifying whether a matrix satisfies rip",
    ", people also need the coherence property to examine the  quality \" of @xmath38 :    the coherence @xmath39 is the largest absolute inner product between any two normalized columns of @xmath38 @xmath40 where @xmath41 represent two columns of @xmath38 .",
    "if @xmath42 , the coherence can also be quantified by calculating the maximal correlation among all rows of @xmath43 and all columns of @xmath5 @xmath44 note that for a unitary matrix @xmath7 with @xmath45 , the mutual coherence coefficient @xmath46 is bounded by @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "when @xmath7 is chosen as the dft or the walsh - hadamard transform and @xmath5 is an identity matrix , @xmath48 . if @xmath7 is a matrix of random basis vectors or a matrix of i.i.d .",
    "gaussian entries @xmath49 , the mutual coherence between @xmath7 and any orthonormal matrix @xmath5 is on the order of @xmath50 with very high probability , far from the lower bound @xcite .",
    "coherence @xmath46 is a core concept in constructing cs matrix , and it will be frequently used in the sensing matrix analysis .",
    "the initial work of cs focused on randomized sensing matrices , in which the entries of matrices are independently generated from standard probability distributions .",
    "for instance , with overwhelming probability , all matrices satisfying random gaussian / bernoulli distribution obey the rip could be uniquely recovered from number of measurements @xmath24 and @xmath51 where @xmath52 is some constant depending on each instance @xcite . as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "pure random matrices are not easily applicable to real implementations due to its large storage and heavy computation . in recent years",
    "some structured sensing matrices have been proposed .",
    "unlike pure random matrices , special constructions make structured sensing matrices suitable for various applications , and we will introduce them chronologically and analyze their performances respectively .      for subsampled incoherent base matrices ,",
    "the most famous examples are random subsampled fourier and walsh - hadamard matrices .",
    "an @xmath8 sensing matrix is constructed by random selecting rows from an @xmath53 square dft ( or fft ) matrix @xmath54 or a walsh - hadamard transform ( wht ) matrix @xmath55 , respectively .",
    "specifically , @xmath56,\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is a primitive @xmath0th root of unity in which @xmath58 and @xmath59,\\ ] ] with an initial matrix @xmath60 $ ] .",
    "the oversampling factor for partial dft matrix was proved as @xmath61 at first in @xcite , then was improved to @xmath62 in @xcite .",
    "generally speaking , the rip property of sampled unitary matrix is summarized as following theorems .",
    "[ ther : rip_unitary ] suppose that the @xmath20 matrix @xmath36 is a randomly subsampled unitary matrix , i.e. , it can be written as @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is a normalizing coefficient , @xmath65 is a random sampling operator which selects @xmath24 samples out of @xmath0 ones uniformly at random , and @xmath66 is an @xmath10 unitary matrix satisfying @xmath67 .",
    "then @xmath68 satisfies the rip with high probability provided that    @xmath69    where @xmath70 denotes the restricted isometry constant in definition [ deft : rip ] .",
    "theorem [ ther : rip_unitary ] implies that the rip bound of a randomly subsampled unitary matrix depends on @xmath71 .",
    "note that for a unitary matrix @xmath72 with @xmath73 , @xmath74 .",
    "when @xmath72 is chosen as the fft or the walsh - hadamard transform , @xmath75 and by eq .",
    "( [ eq : rippartialbound ] ) , one has @xmath76",
    "all above bounds are for the uniform reconstruction , which means that once the sampling operator @xmath77 is constructed , all sparse signals in a certain basis @xmath78 can be recovered as long as @xmath24 is sufficiently large .",
    "if one fixes @xmath1 and wants to recover it specifically , the problem turns to a non - uniform one and this weaker assumption leads to less measurements . in detail :    [ ther : non - uniform ] assume that @xmath36 is a randomly subsampled unitary matrix that follows the same definition as in theorem  [ ther : rip_unitary ] . let @xmath79 in ( [ eq : cs - measure - basic1 ] ) be a fixed arbitrary @xmath2-sparse signal . then @xmath79 can be faithfully recovered from @xmath29 using @xmath80 norm optimization , if @xmath24 satisfies    @xmath81    in addition , if we fix @xmath82 and suppose that the coefficient sequence @xmath4 of @xmath1 is @xmath2-sparse in the basis @xmath5 ; select @xmath24 measurements in the @xmath7 domain uniformly at random , then if @xmath83 for some positive constant @xmath52 , its @xmath80 norm minimization solution is exact with overwhelming probability @xcite . for the cases of dft and wht matrices , @xmath84 or @xmath55 , the bound of @xmath24 holds for @xmath85 .",
    "the theorems listed here are also very useful to prove the feasibility of other structured sensing matrices .",
    "although partial fft ( or wht ) has near - optimal theoretical guarantee , easy hardware implementation and fast - computable recovery , its major shortcoming is the lack of the _ universality _ property . a universal sensing matrix means that the matrix can handle signals that are sparse in any domain .",
    "if @xmath19 is a gaussian random matrix , the matrix @xmath86 will remain gaussian for any unitary transform @xmath9 .",
    "however , if @xmath87 is randomly sampled from a fft , it will not be universal , as @xmath88 can not be @xmath89 for all bases @xmath9 , eg . when @xmath90 , @xmath88 will be large .      because all elements in random matrices are required to satisfy the i.i.d .",
    "random distribution , it becomes natural to raise a question one step further : can we reduce the randomness a little and achieve a similar reconstruction performance ?",
    "al . first followed this thought to propose random toeplitz matrices ( rtm ) in 2007 @xcite . in rtm ,",
    "the entries are independence distributed in one row , while reserve certain structure among other rows . specifically , if a probability distribution @xmath91 yields an i.i.d .",

    "the proof of rip of rtm used the celebrated hajnal - szemeredi theorem on equitable coloring of graphs to partition an @xmath98 toeplitz - structured submatrix @xmath99 into roughly @xmath100 i.i.d .",
    "submatrices having dimensions approximately equal to @xmath101 . by using random toeplitz matrices ,",
    "only @xmath102 independent random variables are required to generate .",
    "multiplication with toeplitz matrices can be more efficiently implemented using fast fourier transform , resulting in faster acquisition and reconstruction algorithms .",
    "in addition , toeplitz - structured matrices meet the naturally requirement for certain application areas such as system identification .",
    "later haupt et .",
    "al . and rauhut improved the bound of @xmath24 to @xmath103 @xcite and @xmath104 @xcite , respectively .",
    "meanwhile , random toeplitz matrices also have disadvantages .",
    "for example , rtm are proved to be able to recover signals sparse only in the time domain .",
    "their strong structures make them not suitable for processing signals sparse in other bases , such as dct domain .",
    "+     the random demodulation ( rd ) matrix was proposed by tropp et .",
    "al . in 2010",
    "pseudorandom binary sequence are often used to modulate the input signal .",
    "similar implementations include bernoulli or rademacher random variables .",
    "the random demodulator is a sampling system that can be used to acquire sparse , bandlimited signals in an analog model .",
    "[ fig : rd - diagram ] displays a block diagram for the rd system @xcite .",

    "al . modulated the signal by multiplying the signal with a high - rate pseudonoise sequence , which smeared the tones across the entire spectrum .",
    "then a low - pass anti - aliasing filter was applied to capture the signal @xmath1 by sampling @xmath1 at a relatively low rate .",
    "simulations suggested that the rd requires just @xmath107 samples per second to stably reconstruct the original signal .    in mathematics ,",
    "the random demodulator can be seen as a linear system that maps a continuous - time signal to a discrete sequence of samples . to express the system in matrix form ,",
    "let @xmath108 be the chipping sequence in a diagonal matrix @xmath109 , @xmath55 is an @xmath110 accumulate - and - dump sampler matrix , where @xmath111 is the sampling rate .",

    "the main advantage of the rd system is it bypasses the need for a high - rate analog - to - digital converter ( adc ) .",
    "it is typically much easier to implement demodulation rather than sampling , thus a low - rate adc is allowed to use and a more robust system with low - power can be achieved . in theory , the rd guaranteed the recovery of random general signals with the sampling rate of @xmath123 in the noiseless case and @xmath124 in the noisy case , where @xmath52 is a positive constant .",
    "the random convolution ( rc ) model was first proposed by romberg in 2007 @xcite . in the rc ,",

    "random convolution is significant since it is deemed as an efficient data acquisition strategy that can recover noiseless @xmath0-length signals in any fixed representation from @xmath136 measurements , which is relatively small for structured cs matrices .",

    "when the phases can only be modulated as @xmath159 and should be determined in advance for hardware reasons , convolutional cs matrices using deterministic sequences are recommended with the price of more number of measurements @xmath24 comparing with that of random convolution . if fixing the entire sensing scheme , the sensing matrices will be deterministic and there is no randomness in construction . in this case",
    "deterministic matrices constructed from coding theory are the only candidates , and usually they are with strict size constraints . in general , there is a tradeoff between randomness and number of measurements @xmath24 .",
    "less randomness facilitates the sensing scheme , however it often leads to more measurements and consequently longer sensing time .",
    "essentially cs theory can be recognized as a data processing technique that recovers sparse data from under - determined equations .",
    "the advantage of cs is to process sparse signals that can not be processed appropriately before , or obtain the compressed data using proper physical instruments directly .",
    "fortunately most of the signals in the real world that people are interest in belong to sparse signals or can be approximated in certain domain .",
    "so from its emergence cs has been implemented in numerous applications including communications , machine learning , imaging , geophysical data analysis , radar , remote sensing , data streaming , quantum state tomography , and so on .",
    "for instance the matrices mentioned previously , the toeplitz matrices are quite suitable for communication channel estimation @xcite ; random demodulators are designed for sampling of sparse wideband analog signals@xcite ; random convolution matrices can be exploited in radar imaging @xcite ; also , the validity of srms has been verified in image processing@xcite ; convolutional matrices using sequences have widely applications in communication and signal processing @xcite .",
    "apart from these works , here we simply introduce two celebrated applications of cs , in medical imaging and single pixel camera .    a promising application for compressed sensing is in reducing the sampling rate in magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) @xcite .",
    "the main motivation of cs mri is that , mri scanners sequentially sample the human s body in the 2-d continuous fourier domain , and sensed coefficients satisfy the sparse property which is also the prerequisite of the theory of cs .",
    "moreover , mri is very time costly . in order to obtain a clearer image ,",
    "one often needs a long time to collect the data .",
    "however , the speed of data collection is limited by physical and physiological constraints . applying",
    "the cs technique may accelerate the scanning process with the same accuracy due to fewer cs measurements being required .",
    "the schematic diagram of mri using cs is shown fig .",
    "[ fig : appli1 ] ( a ) .",
    "another category of the application involves the design of new acquisition hardware that is able to acquire projections of a signal against a class of vectors . in this case , the sensing process is accomplished by physical optical instruments , and the research normally focuses on the problem of how to design sensing matrices whose entries belong to some patterns / bases that can be easily implemented on the hardware .",
    "one example is the framework of recovering an image based on optical modulators , known as the single pixel camera shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : appli1 ] ( b ) @xcite . the digital micromirror device ( dmd ) is a reflective spatial light modulator that selectively redirects parts of the light beam @xcite .",
    "the dmd is comprised of an array of bacterium - sized , electrostatically actuated micro - mirrors , and each mirror rotates about a hinge and can swing between two stages @xmath160 or @xmath161 .",
    "the state of each mirror depends on the bit loaded in the corresponding position of the programmable sensing matrix , and many structured sensing matrices may be implemented in this scenario .",
    "people have tested that the system works well when matrix entries are drawn randomly from a fast transform such as a walsh hadamard transform @xcite .",
    "many advanced imaging hardware architectures based on the single pixel camera model have been developed after these techniques mature , e.g. in terahertz imaging @xcite . with regard to real applications , actually it is not trivial to decide which strategy or structured sensing matrices we shall use . because different matrices have their own features and performances , we have to investigate the practical scenarios and make the tradeoff between number of measurements @xmath24 , universality or not , hardware constraints , computation and so on .",
    "( a )        ( b )",
    "as the key research area of the encoding part of the compressed sensing theory , the research of structured sensing matrices is really important and has attracted more and more attention in recent several years .",
    "although in literatures people have proposed many structured sensing matrices , matrices with special structures are deadly needed with regard to special settings or hardware requirements .",
    "generally speaking , the future development of sensing matrices will focus on two aspects .",
    "the first one is to use less randomness and less memory storage .",
    "for instance , comparing with full random matrices , more sparse sensing matrices with certain structure have and will be exploited to reduce the calculation in cs @xcite .",
    "the structure of a network also can be embodied in a matrix revealed by a one - to - one correspondence with an expander graph @xcite .",
    "the second aspect is to design sensing matrices satisfying certain structure in reality",
    ". this will be the main motivation for developing more structured sensing matrices .",
    "take several examples to illustrate it . in the communication system",
    "the convolution process is equivalent to a toeplitz matrix consisting of the transmitting signals multiplying the system impulse response function .",
    "that s the reason why toeplitz cs matrices could be utilized in sparse channel estimation @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the authors proposed a practical sampling system called modulated wideband converter ( mwc ) by adopting periodic waveforms , a low - pass filter and a low rate sampler .",
    "they proved that perfect recovery of multi - bandlimited signals from the proposed samples can be achieved under certain necessary and sufficient conditions . in mathematics ,",
    "the sampling process can be reformed as a structured sensing matrices @xmath162 , where @xmath163 represent the sign pattern matrix , reorder fourier matrix and diagonal matrix , respectively .",
    "this matrix structure comes from the hardware design , and it performs well in practice @xcite .",
    "in addition , the structured sensing matrices were also implemented in statistical physics , such as the seeding matrix with coupling block diagonal structure .",
    "this work was proposed in @xcite for a framework named seeded compressed sensing .",
    "krzakala et .",
    "al . proved that in their model the experimental recovery results approached the theoretical limit for large systems . to sum up",
    ", people will continue to work on pursuing various structured sensing matrices with less randomness / measurements , better performances and hardware friendly property cooperating knowledge from other fields such as coding theory , communication , random matrix theory etc .",
    ", subject to specific requirements based on real settings .",
    "after explaining the fundamental knowledge of sensing matrices , rip and coherence , we reviewed couples of existing structured sensing matrices , including subsampled incoherent bases , random toeplitz matrices , random demodulator matrices , random convolution matrices , structurally random matrices and other structured sensing matrices .",
    "for each of them , we concentrated on the structure of the matrix , the measurement bounds and its scope of application . though it is difficult to cover all of the developments in structured sensing matrices area , here we aim to explain the main idea and demonstrate a few well - known examples that are representatives of a wider class of the cs problem .",
    "this work was partially supported by the swedish research council , the linnaeus center access at kth , the european research council under the advanced grant learn , contract 267381 , and the china national key basic research program under grant no .",
