    "the solutions of the strong @xmath0 problem proposed by peccei & quinn in 1977 ( @xcite , pq hereafter ) leads to one of the accepted models of dark matter ( dm ) .",
    "pq consider the lagrangian term @xmath7 ( @xmath8 : strong coupling constant , @xmath9 and @xmath10 : gluon field tensor and its dual ) , yielding @xmath0  violations in strong interactions , and show that its effects are suppressed by making @xmath11  a dynamical variable ,  approaching zero in our cosmic era , its residual oscillations appearing as dm @xcite .",

    "here we explore the possibility of replacing it by a potential with a tracker solution @xcite . instead of taking a value @xmath24 soon",
    ", @xmath17 evolves over cosmological times . as in the pq case ,",
    "the potential shall involve a complex field @xmath3 and be @xmath14 invariant . while @xmath17 rapidly settles on the tracker solution ( apart of residual fluctuations ) in almost any horizon ,",
    "the symmetry is broken soon by the values taken by @xmath11 , which suffers no dynamical constraints and is therefore random , in different horizons .",
    "later on , when a mass term arises because of the chiral symmetry break , dynamics becomes relevant also for the @xmath11 degree of freedom , as in the pq case .",
    "here this happens while @xmath17 still evolves over cosmological times . finally , in the present epoch , @xmath17 accounts for dark energy ( de ) .",
    "hence , besides of yielding dm through its phase @xmath11 , the @xmath3 field , introduced to solve the strong @xmath0 problem , accounts for de through its modulus @xmath17 .    within this model , dm and de will be weakly coupled .",
    "if we take a generalization of the sugra potential @xcite as tracking potential , with an energy scale @xmath25gev , we find reasonable values for today s dm and de densities , while @xmath11 is driven to values even smaller than in the pq case , so that @xmath0 is apparently conserved in strong interactions . in turn",

    "in particular , this law holds at @xmath54 , and then @xmath55 so that the usual behavior @xmath56 is modified by the energy outflow from dm to de .",
    "let us now assume that the potential reads @xmath57 and does not depend on @xmath11 ; in the radiation dominated era , it admits the tracker solution @xmath58 with @xmath59 .",
    "this solution holds until we approach the quark ",

    "1(a ) shows the transition between these tracking regimes .",
    "1(b ) then shows the low@xmath62 behavior ( @xmath67 ) , since de density exceeds radiation and then gradually overcomes baryons ( at @xmath68 ) and dm ( at @xmath69 ) .",
    "1(c ) is a landscape behavior of all components , down to @xmath70 .",

    "( [ eq : m8 ] ) . in fig .  2     ( radiation , baryons , dm , de ) vs.  the scale factor @xmath30.,title=\"fig : \" ] -0.8truecm    we show the related behaviors of the density parameters @xmath72 ( @xmath73 , i.e. radiation , baryons , dm , de ) .    in general ,",
    "once the density parameter @xmath74 ( at @xmath75 ) is assigned , a model with dynamical ( coupled or uncoupled ) de is not yet univocally determined . for instance , the potential ( [ eq : l1 ] ) depends on the parameters @xmath76 and @xmath5 and one of them can still be arbitrarily fixed .",
    "other potentials show similar features .    in the present case such arbitrariness no longer exists .",
    "let us follow the behavior of @xmath71 , backwards in time , until the approximation @xmath45 no longer applies .",
    "this moment must approximately coincide with the time when @xmath11 enters the oscillation regime .",

    "( [ eq : l2 ] ) , yields the scale factor @xmath81 when fluctuations start and the value of @xmath5 in the potential ( [ eq : l1 ] ) , as soon as @xmath82 ( the present density of dm ) is assigned .",
    "0.1truecm    the plots shown in the previous section , drawn for @xmath83 , are obtained for @xmath84gev , as is required by eqs.@xmath80([eq : k1]),([eq : k2 ] ) . in this case",
    "when @xmath86 goes from 0.2 to 0.4 , @xmath87 ( almost ) linearly runs from 10.05 to 10.39@xmath80 and @xmath81 steadily lays at the eve of the quark ",
    "hadron transition .",
    "a model with de and dm given by a single complex field , based on sugra potential , therefore bears a precise prediction on the scale @xmath5 , for the observational @xmath86 range . in turn",
    ", we can say that , if the soft breaking of super  symmetries occurred at a scale slightly above @xmath88gev , @xmath89 is a natural consequence .",
    "besides of predicting fair ratios between the world components , a viable model should also allow the formation of structures in the world .",
    "this matter will be treated in detail in a forthcoming paper .",
    "let us however outline that the model treated here belongs to the class of coupled de models treated by amendola @xcite , with a time ",
    "dependent coupling .",
    "in fact , for small @xmath11 s , the r.h.s . of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : m4 ] ) , after averaging over cosmological times , reads @xmath90 with @xmath91 .",
    "similarly , in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : m7 ] ) , which are already averaged , the r.h.s . are @xmath92 ( @xmath93 is the de  dm coupling introduced in @xcite ) .",
    "let us also outline that fig .",
    "2 shows a @xmath17@xmath94 phase , typical of this class of models , after matter  radiation equivalence , as the kinetic energy of de is non ",
    "neglegible during the matter  dominated era .    by solving the fluctuation equations in @xcite , with the above @xmath95",
    ", we find the behavior shown in fig .  3  ( top ) .",
    "cdm ( dot - dashed ) , coupled de ( dashed).,title=\"fig : \" ] -0.8truecm    figs .",
    "3  ( bottom ) compare fluctuation evolutions in this model ( solid curves ) , with those in an analogous @xmath5cdm model ( dot  dashed curves ) and in a coupled de model with constant coupling @xmath96 ( dashed curves ) .",
    "these plots show that the linear growth factor , from recombination to now , is significantly smaller than in coupled de models with constant coupling and , more significantly , is quite close to @xmath5cdm .",
    "the essential differences from @xmath5cdm are that : ( i ) objects should form earlier ; ( ii ) baryon fluctuations keep below dm fluctuations until very recently .",
    "the first evidences of dm date 70 years ago , but its non  baryonic nature became compulsory in the seventies , when bbns and cmbr anisotropies were studied .",
    "de is younger , but is now required both by snia data @xcite , as well as by cmbr and deep galaxy data @xcite .",
    "axions have been candidate dm since the late seventies , although various studies , as well as the occurrence of the sn 1987a , have finally constrained the pq scale around values @xmath97gev .",
    "contributions to dm from topological singularities ( cosmic string and walls ) have also narrowed the constraints to @xmath98 @xcite .",
    "here they were disregarded and could cause shifts in quantitative predictions .",
    "we shall deepen this point in further work .",
    "the fact that scalar fields can yield both dm or de , just changing an exponent in the potential , stimulated the work of various authors .",
    "a potential like ( [ eq : l1 ] ) was considered in _ spintessence _",
    "models @xcite . according to the choice of parameters , @xmath3 yields either dm or de .    on the contrary , in this note we deal with the possibility that @xmath3 accounts for _ both _ de and dm , and that the strong@xmath0 problem is simultaneously solved .",
    "as in the pq model , the angle @xmath11 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : n1 ] ) is turned into a dynamical variable , i.e. into the phase of a complex scalar field @xmath3 , and is gradually driven to approach zero , by our cosmic epoch .",
    "residual @xmath11 oscillations , yielding axions , account for dm .",
    "the critical time for the onset of coherent axion oscillations occurs at the eve of the quark ",
    "hadron transition , because of the rapid increase of @xmath37 .",
    "here @xmath17 replaces the constant @xmath98 scale .",
    "this stage is illustrated by figs .",
    "4(a ) , 4(b )        the novel features of this model arise because the expectation value of @xmath17 is not a constant @xmath98 , but evolves over cosmological times ; in a sense , we let @xmath98 evolve so to yield de . such evolution modifies the friction term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : m3 ] ) .",
    "the damping of @xmath11 oscillations is therefore greater and @xmath11 oscillations are smaller today .",
    "further , accordingly to eq .",
    "( [ eq : m2 ] ) the axion mass ( or the oscillation frequency ) , which varies fairly rapidly during the formation of @xmath102 condensate , continues to evolve , over cosmological scales , due to the evolution of the @xmath17 field .",
    "the ( low)@xmath62 dependence of @xmath39 is shown in fig .",
    "constraints on pq axions came from @xmath75 observations , which must be fulfilled by the same @xmath98 scale , fulfilling also cosmological requirement . here , @xmath17 attains values @xmath103 today , so that most these constraints should be naturally satisfied .",
    "this matter , as well as the question of a direct axion detection , will be deepened in further work .",
    "let us outline that the choice of a sugra potential is arbitrary and could be replaced by other potentials , perhaps better approaching data at @xmath75 . however , using this potential allows to appreciate the conceptual echonomy in this approach . in the pq approach , the @xmath98 scale is assumed . here ,",
    "once @xmath5 is set in a physically significant range , around the quark ",
    "hadron transition , @xmath17 naturally passes through values enabling to solve the strong@xmath0 problem and later naturally grows to values providing fair amounts of dm and de .",
