    "in recent years , systems consisting of arrayed single - domain ferromagnetic nanoparticles receive much attention of many researchers because of its possibility as a high storage density  @xcite . in such array systems",
    "the dipole - dipole interaction is considered to play an important role on their magnetic properties .",
    "the interaction not only intrinsically involves frustration , i.e. , the competition between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions , but also it connects the anisotropy in the the spin space with that in the real space . in finite systems the latter is expected to yield a vast variety of ground - state spin configurations depending on shapes of the systems .",
    "various ordered spin patterns have been actually observed , for example , in infinite  @xcite or finite  @xcite systems only with the dipole - dipole interaction , which we call _ dipolar systems _ , on the triangular lattice . in dipolar systems",
    "such a peculiar phenomenon as the from - edge - to - interior freezing has been also found recently  @xcite . in the present study",
    "we investigate a dipolar hexagonal plate cut out from a piled triangular lattice of three layers with fcc - like structures and with uniaxial compression in the direction of layer - piling .",

    "appear three kinds of patterns , i.e. , in - plane - vortex , convex - flow , in - plane - af - fmc ( see fig .",
    "[ gs](c ) below ) patterns depending on a value of @xmath0 . the freezing temperature , @xmath1 , depends on a spin pattern of the corresponding ground state .",
    "especially , @xmath1 of the convex flow state is much lower than those of other states .",
    "because of this @xmath0-dependence of @xmath1 , we expect the peculiar spin melting and refreezing driven by uniaxial compression , say , at @xmath2 . in the present study",
    "we perform simulated annealing of the dipolar hexagonal plate by the monte carlo ( mc ) method .",

    "each layer contains about 100 sites .",
    "the @xmath8-direction is set in perpendicular to the layers .",
    "we perform typically 8 cooling runs with a fixed cooling rate , in which we use different sets of random numbers generating their initial configurations as well as spin - renewing for each mc step . for each cooling run , temperature @xmath9",

    "at each temperature , states are sampled over @xmath12 5 @xmath13 10@xmath14 mc steps .",
    "the results described below are insensitive to this cooling rate in the sense that values of the freezing temperature @xmath1 , for example , do not change significantly even when the cooling rate is set faster by several times .    in the present paper we examine a freezing parameter , @xmath15 , in order to study freezing characteristics of the dipolar plate .",

    ", @xmath15 is measured during cooling processes for the dipolar hexagonal plate whose inter - layer distance @xmath0 is set from @xmath21 to @xmath22 , with @xmath22 being the inter - layer distance of the fcc structure .",

    "as @xmath0 further deceases up to around 0.7@xmath22 , @xmath1 slowly increases .",
    "after @xmath0 passes 0.7@xmath22 , @xmath1 stays nearly constant up to @xmath0 of about 0.5@xmath22 where @xmath1 starts to increase rapidly .",

    "let us first discuss the spin patterns of the ground state ( or the state reached by the present analysis at the lowest temperatures ) of the plates with @xmath31 .",
    "the one of @xmath24 is shown in fig .",
    "[ gs](a ) .",
    "spins are confined in the @xmath32-@xmath33 plane and they form a single vortex . such an in - plane vortex state is often observed in 2d dipolar systems  @xcite . in the present dipolar hexagonal plate the vortex state",
    "consists of six ferromagnetic domains extended from all the edges of the plate . in the cooling process to this ground state",
    "the from - edge - to - interior freezing  @xcite is observed .",
    "both the energetics of the ground state and the origin of this freezing characteristics have been discussed in our previous paper  @xcite . in a whole range of @xmath25 this vortex state",
    "is observed at lowest temperatures .",
    "when @xmath0 becomes close to @xmath34 , however , the in - plane vortex state are gradually broken from around the center of every hexagonal layer , which is indicated by the gray region in fig .",
    "[ gs](a ) . in this region",
    "spins possess an out - of - plane component .",
    "( in - plane vortex ) , ( b ) @xmath26 ( convex flow ) , and ( c ) @xmath27 ( c ) ( in - plane - af - fmc ) . in each schematic picture ,",
    "spin configurations are shown by arrows . the symbols",
    "a , b , and c in ( c - ii ) denote sites on the top , intermediate and bottom layers , respectively . ]    the ground state of the dipolar plate with @xmath26 is found to be a convex - flow state schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ gs](b - i ) . the @xmath8-component pattern of spins on the middle layer of the plate with @xmath35 is shown in fig .",
    "[ gs](b - ii ) , where a stripe pattern of ferromagnetic orders is clearly seen .",
    "in fact the absolute magnitudes of these @xmath8-components are close to unity .",
    "spins on the first ( top ) and third ( bottom ) layers lie almost within the layers and align to connect smoothly with the neighboring ferromagnetic orders , yielding a convex - flow pattern as a whole . at @xmath36 , the stripe pattern is destabilized to the one shown in fig .",
    "[ gs](b - iii ) .",
    "we may call the latter as a randomly - distributed convex - flow state . whether the range of @xmath0 , where this state appears , is finite or not has not been confirmed , but so far it has not been observed at the other end of the convex - flow state , i.e. , at @xmath37 .    for further compressed systems such as",
    "the one with @xmath38 , an in - plane state again appears as shown in fig .",
    "[ gs](c ) .",
    "each on - layer pattern of this state , however , has not the vortex structure but the anti - ferromagnetic ferromagnetic - chain ( af - fmc ) order shown in fig .",
    "[ gs](c - i ) ; spins on one lattice axis align ferromagnetically directed to the axis , and this ferromagnetic chain order alternates in the direction perpendicular to the axis .",
    "it is similar to one of the ( continuous ) ground states of the bulk dipolar system on the 2d square lattice  @xcite . in the present hexagonal plate ,",
    "the on - layer af - fmc orders align ferromagnetically in the @xmath8-direction as shown in fig .",
    "[ gs](c - ii ) .",
    "spins on two sides of the plate direct within the side plane keeping the af - fmc order with the interior spins , while those on the other four sides align to connect continuously between the af - fmc pattern on the top layer and that on the bottom layer .",
    "the present in - plane - af - fmc ground state is confirmed in the range @xmath39 at least .",
    "we expect one more change of the ground state at a further shorter @xmath0 than @xmath40 as shown in fig .",
    "[ spd ] , because at @xmath41 the system is a 2d triangular lattice layer whose density of spins is tripled as compared with the original one and so the vortex state is naturally expected .",
    "in our recent work  @xcite the same dipolar hexagonal systems but with the numbers of layers , @xmath7 , up to 15 and with @xmath42 were studied .",
    "we observed the in - plane - vortex ground state in systems with @xmath43 for all @xmath7 s ( @xmath44 ) , and the convex - flow ground state for @xmath45 in systems with @xmath46 . in a bulk system with @xmath47 ,",
    "i.e. , the fcc lattice , the ferromagnetic order has the global @xmath48 symmetry  @xcite .",
    "therefore , when the hexagonal boundary is introduced , there appear the in - plane - vortex ground state which gains the boundary - induced anisotropic energy including that from all edges .",
    "when the fcc structure is compressed in the @xmath8-direction , the magnetization prefers to align to this direction , and the competition with the boundary - induced anisotropic energy takes place .",
    "an important finding of the present work is that the critical distance , @xmath49 , at which the ground state changes from the in - plane - vortex to the convex - flow ones , is given as @xmath50 for @xmath51 .",
    "more interestingly , the spin melting phenomenon is observed at low temperatures , such as @xmath52 , as @xmath0 decreases around @xmath49 , correspondingly to the ground state transition .",
    "furthermore , when @xmath0 is further decreased , the spin refreezing phenomenon is found .",
    "it corresponds to the ground state change to the in - plane - af - fmc one .",
    "the occurrence of the latter is certainly related to the fact that the present system with @xmath53 is just a simple cubic lattice whose one of the bulk ground states is the af - fmc one  @xcite , though details of the shape effect are not completely understood yet .",
    "the results so far described are obtained for the hexagonal dipolar plate by varying @xmath0 but with @xmath54 and a size of the plate fixed .",
    "although we have not completed mc simulations with systematic change of the other parameters , nor have analyzed effects of the boundary roughness , the present results are enough to demonstrate that the dipolar systems of a finite size have a vast variety of magnetic phenomena , which are hardly thought of for ordinary spin systems only with simple exchange - type interactions .",
    "the present work is supported by the naregi nanoscience project of the ministry of education , culture , sports , science , and technology .",
    "the numerical simulations have been partially performed also by using the facilities at the supercomputer center , institute for solid state physics , the university of tokyo .",
