    "non - standard gravity models provide an alternative possibility towards understanding the accelerated expansion of the universe ( see @xcite and references therein ) . the physical mechanism which is responsible for the present accelerating stage of the universe",
    "can be driven by a modification of the einstein - hilbert action , while the matter content of the universe remains the same ( relativistic and cold dark matter ) . in the literature",
    "there are plenty of modified gravity models proposed by different authors , such as the braneworld dvali , gabadadze and porrati @xcite model , @xmath6 gravity @xcite , scalar - tensor theories @xcite , gauss - bonnet gravity @xcite , hoava - lifshitz gravity @xcite , nonlinear massive gravity @xcite etc .",
    "another gravitational scenario which has recently gained a lot of attention is the so called @xmath0 gravity .",
    "the intrinsic properties of this scenario are based on the rather old formulation of the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity ( tegr ) @xcite .",
    "specifically , instead of using the torsion - less levi - civita connection of the classical general relativity ( gr ) one utilizes the curvature - less weitzenbck connection in which the corresponding dynamical fields are the four linearly independent _ vierbeins .",
    "_ therefore , all the information concerning the gravitational field are included in the torsion tensor . within this framework ,",
    "considering invariance under general coordinate transformations , global lorentz - parity transformations , and requiring up to second order terms of the torsion tensor , one can write down the corresponding lagrangian density @xmath7 @xcite by using some suitable contractions . a natural generalization of tegr gravity is @xmath0 gravity which is based on the fact that we allow the lagrangian to be a function of @xmath7 @xcite , inspired , of course , by the well - known extension of @xmath6 einstein - hilbert action .",
    "however , @xmath0 gravity does not coincide with @xmath6 extension , but it rather consists a different class of modified gravity .",
    "it is interesting to mention that the torsion tensor includes only products of first derivatives of the vierbeins , giving rise to second - order field differential equations in contrast with the @xmath6 gravity that provides fourth - order equations which potentially may lead to some problems , for example in the well - position and well - formulation of cauchy problem @xcite .    despite the fact that tegr coincides completely with gr , both at the background and perturbation levels",
    ", it has been shown that @xmath0 gravity provides different structural properties with respect to gr as well as different black - hole solutions and cosmological features @xcite .",
    "an important question here is what classes of @xmath0 extensions are allowed . from the phenomenological viewpoint , the aforementioned cosmological and spherical analysis lead to a variety of such expressions . using cosmological @xcite and solar system @xcite observations",
    ", one can show that the deviations from tegr must be small .",
    "in this work , we use a model - independent selection rule based on first integrals , due to noether symmetries of the equations of motion , in order to identify the viability of @xmath0 gravity in the context of flat friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) cosmologies . actually , the idea to use noether symmetries in cosmology is not new and indeed there is a lot of work in the literature ( see @xcite ) along this line . in this context , recently we have shown ( see basilakos et al .",
    "@xcite ; paliathanasis et al .",
    "@xcite ) that the existence of noether symmetries can be used as a selection criterion in order to distinguish the scalar dark energy models @xcite as well as the @xmath6 gravity models @xcite . inspired by the above works in the current article",
    ", we would like to estimate the noether symmetries of the @xmath0 gravity .",
    "the aim here is @xmath8 to identify the @xmath0 functional forms which accommodate extra noether symmetries , and @xmath9 for these models , to solve the system of the resulting field equations and derive analytically the main cosmological functions ( the scale factor , the hubble expansion rate , deceleration parameter and growth factor ) and finally to compare with other cosmological patterns which are outside and inside gr .",

    "the symmetric part @xmath80 of @xmath81 depends on all fields .",

    "this misunderstanding has important consequences because the effects one will observe in an unholonomic frame will be frame dependent and not covariant effects . therefore all conclusions made in a specific unholonomic frame must be restricted to that frame only .",
    "with the above considerations in mind , let us consider tegr and its straightforward extension @xmath0 .",
    "teleparallelism uses as dynamical objects the _ vierbiens _ as unholonomic frames in spacetime .",

    "the deceleration parameter is given by @xmath236 from eq.([ahe ] ) it is evident that this cosmological model has no inflection point .",
    "therefore , the main drawback of the @xmath1 gravity model is that the deceleration parameter preserves sign , and therefore the universe always accelerates or always decelerates depending on the value of @xmath2 . indeed ,",
    "if we consider @xmath237 ( tegr ) then the above solution boils down to the einstein de sitter model as it should . on the other hand ,",

    "the basic equation which governs the evolution of the matter fluctuations in the linear regime is given by @xmath240 where @xmath241 is the matter density and @xmath242 is the effective newton s parameter which is written as @xcite @xmath243 note , that @xmath244 denotes newton s gravitational constant . on the other hand , using eqs .",
    "( [ modfri ] ) and ( [ rhot ] ) one can easily write @xmath245 therefore , inserting eqs.([h.50 ] ) , ( [ geff ] ) and ( [ reff ] ) into eq.([odedelta ] ) we have the following general equation @xmath246 we focus now on the @xmath1 gravity model .",
    "first of all for gr ( @xmath237 ) we have @xmath247 and thus , without losing the generality , we can set @xmath248 then the newton s constant is just rescaled to be @xmath249 which is also constant in time .",
    "this result comes directly from the action ( [ action ] ) ( see also @xcite ) . ] .",

    "interestingly , the above differential equation modifies that of the einstein de - sitter model in which @xmath237 ( gr ) . from the mathematical point of view , eq.([odedelta2 ] ) is of euler type whose general solution is @xmath251 or @xmath252 where @xmath253 and @xmath254 . in the case of",
    "@xmath255 we have two growth factors while for @xmath256 the only growth factor is @xmath257 .",
    "it is interesting to mention that if we write the growth factor as a function of the scale factor then mathematically it coincides with that of the einstein de - sitter model @xcite .",
    "this result means that the growth rate of clustering @xmath258 remains constant and equal to unity for every scale factor , implying that the present growth data disfavor the @xmath1 gravity . indeed ,",
    "in fig.1 we plot the growth data as collected by basilakos et al .",
    "( see @xcite and references therein ) with the estimated growth rate function , @xmath259 [ see @xmath0 - solid line and @xmath141cdm - dashed line ] .",

    "it has been found by paliathanasis ( see appendix in @xcite ) that the corresponding scale factor obeys eq.([ahe ] ) , where @xmath265 .",
    ", where @xmath266 is the ricci scalar . for @xmath237",
    "the solution of the euler - lagrange equations is the einstein de - sitter model [ @xmath267 as it has to be .",
    "note , that for @xmath268 one can find a de - sitter solution ( @xmath269 , see @xcite ) . ] in @xcite , it has been shown that the particular model @xmath270 has the cosmological solution @xmath271 capable of addressing both dark - energy and dark - matter dominated phases .",
    "however , despite of the analogies , we have to point out that @xmath6 gravity is a fourth - order theory while @xmath0 gravity remains of second order .    on the other hand , considering a spatially flat flrw metric in the context of gr ,",
    "the combination of the friedmann equations with the total ( matter+vacuum ) energy conservation in the matter dominated era provides ( for more details see @xcite ) @xmath272 solving eq.([llaa ] ) for @xmath4 ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) we end up with @xmath273 now , comparing eqs.([he ] ) and ( [ he11 ] ) and connecting the above coefficients such as @xmath5 , we find that the @xmath1 and the flat @xmath4 models can be viewed as equivalent cosmologies as far as the hubble expansion is concerned , despite the fact that the current time varying vacuum model adheres to gr . however , if the @xmath4 cosmological model is confronted with the current observations provides a poor fit@xcite .",
    "since the current time varying vacuum model shares exactly the same hubble parameter with the @xmath1 gravity model , this fact implies that the latter is also under observational pressure when we compare against the background cosmological data ( snia , baos and cmb data ) . the same observational situation holds also for @xmath3 modified gravity .",
    "in this paper , we present a general study of noether symmetries for @xmath0 gravity and discuss the role of torsion and unholonomic frames in the context of teleparallel gravity and its straightforward extension . in particular , we point out the misunderstanding that when one works in an unholonomic frame , the torsion is introduced showing that this statement is not correct .",
    "the misunderstanding consists in the fact that the effects one observes in an unholonomic frame are frame dependent and not covariant effects .",
    "therefore all conclusions made in a specific unholonomic frame must be restricted to that frame only .",
    "coming to the specific _ noether symmetry approach _ , this article extends the works by basilakos et al .",
    "@xcite , paliathanasis et al .",
    "@xcite and wei et al .",
    "we confirm the result of @xcite that amongst the variety of @xmath0 modified gravity theories , @xmath1 gravity admits noether symmetries ( integrals of motion ) .",
    "however , we provide here a more general family of noether integrals with respect to that of @xcite . from the mathematical viewpoint",
    "the existence of extra integrals of motion points out the existence of further analytical solutions .",
    "based on the @xmath1 models , we derive analytical solutions and thus we find the evolution of the main cosmological functions , namely the scale factor of the universe , the hubble parameter , the deceleration parameter and for the first time to our knowledge the growth of matter fluctuations in the linear regime .",
    "furthermore , we discuss the linear matter fluctuations from these background solutions .",
    "the analysis of the deceleration parameter points out that the @xmath1 gravity models include an intrinsic problem namely , the fact that the expansion of the universe always accelerates or always decelerates without spanning the different trends of cosmic evolution .",
    "another basic problem is related to the fact that the growth rate of clustering is constant and always equal to unity which means that the present growth data can not accommodate the @xmath1 gravity . as shown in @xcite , a robust cosmographic reconstruction of @xmath0 cosmology",
    "needs more complicated models to address data .",
    "finally , we find that flat @xmath1 cosmologically models are perfectly equivalent to the cosmic expansion history of the flat @xmath3 modified gravity and the flat time varying vacuum model @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 ) , despite the fact that the three models live in a completely different geometrical background .",
    "this fact is a further indication of the high degeneracy problem affecting cosmological models capable of addressing the dark energy issue .",

    "<S> the existence of extra noether integrals can be used in order to simplify the system of differential equations ( equations of motion ) as well as to determine the integrability of the @xmath1 cosmological model . within this context </S>",
    "<S> , we can solve the problem analytically and thus we provide the evolution of the main cosmological functions such as the scale factor of the universe , the hubble expansion rate , the deceleration parameter and the linear matter perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the @xmath1 cosmological model suffers from two basic problems . </S>",
    "<S> the first problem is related to the fact that the deceleration parameter is constant which means that it never changes sign , and therefore the universe always accelerates or always decelerates depending on the value of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , we find that the clustering growth rate remains always equal to unity implying that the recent growth data disfavor the @xmath1 gravity . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we prove that the @xmath1 gravity can be cosmologically equivalent with the @xmath3 gravity model and the time varying vacuum model @xmath4 ( for @xmath5 ) because the above cosmological scenarios share exactly the same hubble expansion , despite the fact that the three models have a different geometrical origin . </S>",
    "<S> finally , some important differences with power - law @xmath6-gravity are pointed out . </S>"
