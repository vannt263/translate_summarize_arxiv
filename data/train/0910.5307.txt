    "most materials have positive permittivity .",
    "if such a material is placed in an electric field , then the direction of the field induced inside the material will have the same orientation as the applied field . whereas the field inside a material with negative permittivity would be oriented in the opposite direction to the applied field .",
    "the most popular substances with negative permittivity are gaseous plasmas and solid - state plasmas veselago , skobov . in a plasma with no magnetic field , the permittivity @xmath0 ( @xmath1 -vacuum permittivity )",
    "is given by@xmath2 where @xmath3 is the plasma frequency , @xmath4 is the concentration of the carriers , @xmath5 is their charge , and @xmath6 is their mass .",
    "it is not hard to check that when the frequency @xmath7 is smaller compared to the plasma frequency @xmath8 , then @xmath9 is negative .",
    "it has been shown that wire structures with lattice spacing of the order of a few millimeters behave like a plasma with a resonant frequency , @xmath10 , in the ghz regions .",
    "these metamaterials gain their properties from the structure rather than the composition @xcite .",
    "such materials attract growing interest for the last decade from theoretical and experimental perspectives .",
    "the presence of simultaneously negative permeability and permittivity in these materials @xcite lead to many unusual effects which find various applications in areas such as perfect and hyper lenses pendry2,melville , fang , taubner , jacob , liu , smolyaninov , suppression of spontaneous emission of an atom in front of a mirror made by metamaterial @xcite , magnification of objects that are smaller than the wavelength @xcite and creation of second - harmonic generation @xcite .",
    "veselago made a theoretical study of materials with negative electrical permittivity , @xmath9 and negative magnetic permeability , @xmath11 in his seminal paper @xcite .",
    "the conclusion of his article is that this type of materials support electromagnetic waves description , but the energy flow , directed by the poynting vector , is in the opposite direction to the wave vector .",
    "this means that rays travel in the opposite direction to waves .",
    "the most important result of vaselago s work is that when both @xmath12 and @xmath11 are negative , the refraction index , defined by the equation @xmath13 , is negative @xmath14the key experimental consequence is the rather unusual manifestation of snell s law . in the passage of a ray of light from one medium with positive refraction index @xmath15 into another , with @xmath16",
    "the snell s law is satisfied but @xmath17 is negative . in materials with negative refraction index",
    "the cherenkov effect is reversed , just like the doppler effect @xcite .",
    "the veselago theory is focused on the optical properties of materials with negative permittivity and permeability . in the present paper",
    "we consider the electric forces in the presence of material with negative permittivity .",
    "we explore theoretically the force acting on a single charged particle and the interaction between two charged particles placed next to a material with negative permittivity .",
    "our examination relies on the pendry s criterion for validity of electrostatic limit in the present problem @xcite : the wavelength , corresponding to the frequency @xmath18 in eq.[omega ] , should be longer compare with the distance of the charged particles to the material with negative permittivity .",
    "we show , using the method of images @xcite , that for negative permittivity of the material , the force between the material and the charged particle can be attractive or repulsive and can even have a bigger value compared to the conventional materials .",
    "furthermore , the repulsion force between two equally charged electric particles in a vacuum , stated by the coulomb law , turn into the attraction force between the same electric charges when they are placed next to a material with negative permittivity and the distance between them is larger than some critical distance . as a result the two equally charged particles  crystallize \" occupying equilibrium states .",
    "initially we start our examination with the simplest possible case of a single point charge @xmath19 , which is embedded in a semi - infinite dielectric with permittivity @xmath20 at a distance @xmath21 away from a plane interface that separates the first medium from another semi - infinite dielectric with permittivity @xmath22 ( fig.[single point charge ] ) .",
    "we want to find what the force acting on the charge @xmath19 is . from the point of view of mathematics",
    "our problem is to solve poisson s equation in a region with permittivity @xmath20 , and a point charge @xmath19 , subject to the boundary conditions at the plane interface that separates the first medium from the second .",
    "the solution of this problem is easily found by the method of images @xcite .",
    "this method is a powerful and easy way to handle solutions of differential equations , in which the domain of the sought function is extended by the addition of its mirror image with respect to a symmetry hyperplane . in our case",
    "the electrical potential will be fully reconstructed in the space occupied by the dielectric @xmath20 if we place an image of @xmath19 with a charge magnitude@xmath23at a distance @xmath21 away from a plane in the space occupied by the dielectric @xmath24 @xcite ( fig.[single point charge ] ) .",
    "therefore the net force acting on the charge @xmath19 is @xmath25which force could be attractive or repulsive depending on the ratio @xmath26 . the maximal attraction force for conventional materials ( @xmath27 ,  @xmath28 ) is @xcite @xmath29we are interested in the case when the first media is a vacuum , but the second media is a material with negative permittivity ( @xmath30 ) . in this case",
    "the net force acting on the charge @xmath19 is@xmath31if the permittivity @xmath22 of the material satisfies @xmath32 then the force from eq.([metamaterial electrical force ] ) has a positive sign , therefore the charge is repelled from this material .",
    "the force from eq.([metamaterial electrical force ] ) is attractive if @xmath33    obvious singularity happens in eq.([metamaterial electrical force ] ) when @xmath34 .",
    "one might make a mistake thinking that this singularity leads to an infinite force , but one should note that dispersionless material is an abstraction and a finite positive imaginary component of the permittivity always exists @xcite .",
    "the imaginary component of the permittivity can no longer be neglected when the difference between the real parts of the two dielectric permittivities is a small number , which resolve the paradox with the infinite force .",
    "an important case is when we can neglect the imaginary part of the permittivity @xmath22 .",
    "then the force from eq.([metamaterial electrical force ] ) could be repulsive and bigger compared to the module of the force from eq.([conductor force ] ) .",
    "for example if @xmath35 , then the net force acting on the charge @xmath19 is @xmath36which is a repulsive force and three times stronger than the module of the force that the same charge @xmath19 , placed at the same distance @xmath21 , feels from the plane interface of a metal ( see eq.([conductor force ] ) ) .",
    "even a more interesting situation with a counterintuitive result is the case when two charged particles are placed in a vacuum next to a material with negative permittivity @xmath9 ( fig.[two point charges ] ) .",
    "to examine the situation in more details , we consider the case when the two charged particles @xmath37 and @xmath38 are in a vacuum at a distance @xmath21 away from the material with negative permittivity @xmath9 .",
    "the method of images states that the system is described equivalently by two images for each charge @xmath37 and @xmath38 placed at a distance @xmath21 away from the surface of the material @xmath9 ( fig.[two point charges ] ) with charges @xmath39 for convenience let us represent the force in two components : @xmath40@xmath41where @xmath42 or @xmath43 and @xmath44 is the distance between the charged particles .",
    "the perpendicular to the material component of the force can be thought of as an effective force between the charged particles and the material , while the parallel component as an effective interaction between the particles .",
    "the expression in the brackets in eq.([parallel component ] ) is positive when @xmath45 for arbitrary values of @xmath21 and @xmath44 .",
    "this means that the character of the interaction ( attractive or repulsive ) is the same as that stated by the coulomb low .    when @xmath46 and @xmath47 there is a critical distance between the particles @xmath48 at which the interaction is zero @xmath49 @xmath50 )",
    "it follows that : when the two particles are closer @xmath51 , the second term in the brackets is smaller than the first one and the interaction between the charges is the same as stated by the coulomb law .",
    "but when the distance between the particles is larger than the critical one @xmath52 , the expression in the brackets of eq.(parallel component ) is negative and the force has an opposite sign compared to the force given by the coulomb law .    the total perpendicular component of the force can be zero @xmath53 if a symmetric geometry is realized .",
    "for example this is the case when the charged particles are placed in a vacuum sandwich with two identical semi - infinite materials with negative permittivity @xmath9 ( fig.[the symmetric geometry ] ) . in the particular case",
    "when the two particles have equal charges @xmath54 and @xmath55 , the interaction between them is @xmath56the factor @xmath43 in the brackets in eq ( [ parallel component2 ] ) is owing to the geometry of the system .",
    "it changes when the geometry of the system is altered .",
    "the critical distance at which the force between particles eqs ( parallel component2 ) is zero @xmath57 depends on the geometry too @xmath58    the force , eq ( [ parallel component2 ] ) , between two equal charged particles is repulsive when they are closer than the critical distance @xmath59 , and it is attractive when the distance is larger than the critical one . as a result",
    "the particles  crystallize \" occupying equilibrium positions at a distance equal to the critical distance @xmath60 .",
    "the scheme could be extended to many particles . by increasing the number of the particles , the critical distance decreases . in this way we can make an array of equally charged particles situated at a very small distance from each other .",
    "this permits us to construct a new type of equally charged particles trap .    by making the permittivity @xmath61 to vary from negative to positive",
    ", we release the particles and they will have a kinetic energy depending on the critical distance between them .",
    "this enables us to accelerate the charges in a new fashion .",
    "the examined force between a charged particle and a material with negative permittivity has the potential to be not only a curious and intriguing example of what the artificial material can do , but also a useful technique to levitate small objects with charges and therefore to make frictionless devices .",
