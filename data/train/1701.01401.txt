    "after cleaning the chips for 7 hours in a 1:1:1.3 mixture of nitric : perchloric : sulfuric acids at 200 @xmath42c ( from now on referred to as triacid cleaning ) , each diamond chip was mounted flat on a silicon substrate .",
    "the chip was surrounded by four 0.5-mm - thick stainless - steel sheets flush with the diamond surface to avoid edge beading during spin coating .",
    "a thin film of i - con 16 was used as an adhesive to stick the diamond and the steel sheets to the silicon substrate because it does not outgas or reflow during baking .",
    "the next step was to spin - coat i - con 16 as an anti - reflection coating ( arc ) on top of the diamond ( 4000 rpm , 150 @xmath42c oven bake for 5 minutes ) , followed by spin - coating with a uv negative photoresist ( nr-7 500p , 4000 rpm , 150 @xmath42c hot plate bake for 1 minute ) .",

    "most of the samples used in this work had approximately 50% duty cycle .",

    "liftoff was performed by immersing the chips in a sonicating acetone bath for 10 minutes to leave only cr / au grating structures on the diamond surface .",

    "ideally , the mask would remain thick enough ( @xmath93 ) to block ions from penetrating the tops of the nanogratings during implantation .",
    "this is because ions incident on the nanograting tops would travel on average @xmath716 times deeper than those incident to the sidewalls due to the large difference in angles of incidence ( see below ) . at such a large depth",
    "these nv centers will hardly register any nmr signal , reducing the overall nmr signal contrast .",
    "we found that the 40 minutes of etching used in the chips in this work was longer than optimal , and the mask had eroded over large regions of the chips prior to implantation .",
    "we have since optimized the process to use a slightly thicker metal mask such that the mask remains largely intact after 35 minutes of etching .",

    "this annealing procedure was selected to give a high nv@xmath98 yield while minimizing the abundance of other paramagnetic impurities @xcite .",
    "after annealing , the diamond chips were again cleaned in triacid for 10 hours to remove residual graphite on the surfaces and mounted in the microscope setup .",
