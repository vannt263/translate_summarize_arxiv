    "in the near term , the future of ultraviolet space astronomy is reasonably bright .",
    "the _ galex _ satellite was well - ranked in nasa s recent senior review and will continue its programs of broad - band spectral imaging in the ultraviolet . for uv spectroscopy , the space shuttle is scheduled to install the _ cosmic origins spectrograph _ ( cos ) on the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) in mid-2009 .",
    "although delayed , the cos far - uv ( fuv ) spectrograph will provide an order - of - magnitude increase in throughput for moderate resolution ( @xmath0 or 15 km  s@xmath1 ) spectra between 11501775  .",
    "however , beyond the lifetimes of _ galex _ and hst / cos , there may be a hiatus in ultraviolet - optical ( uv / o ) space astronomy . following a successful hubble servicing mission 4 ( may 2009 ) ,",
    "we anticipate an additional 510 years of _ hubble _ lifetime .",
    "however , after mission completion of the two great observatories , _ hubble _ and _ chandra _ , we might expect a gap of perhaps 10 years in both uv / o and x - ray space astronomy until after 2025 , when major new missions could be approved and built . in this talk , i will briefly describe some of the scientific projects enabled by cos , then turn to strategies for filling this 10-year gap with new missions in the uv / o spectral bands .",
    "some key issues are :    * what should be the science drivers for new uv / o missions ?",
    "* what is the correct distribution of small , medium , and large missions ?",
    "* how should the uv / o community advocate the best science ? * what are tradeoffs in aperture , wavelength band , and other capabilities ?",
    "the _ cosmic origins spectrograph _ ( cos ) was designed to provide high - throughput ( @xmath2 @xmath3 ) , moderate - resolution ( @xmath0 ) point - source spectroscopy in the far - ultraviolet ( @xmath4   ) .",
    "this capability would provide a factor - of - ten increase in throughput over previous uv spectrographs on _ hubble _ over the range 11501775  .",
    "in addition , a near - ultraviolet ( nuv ) channel ( 17503200  ) was added , although with only a moderate improvement ( factors of 23 ) in effective area over stis .",
    "the capabilities and pre - launch performance of cos were described by froning & green ( 2008 ) , excerpted in table 1 below .",
    "the proposed science objectives were given by morse et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and updated briefly in this section .",
    "+       however , nasa rarely operates with long - range budgets , as they are constantly facing cost overruns and budget shortfalls .",
    "one of the important tasks for us , and for nasa administrators , is to convince everyone  the public , our profession , and congress  that space astrophysics is an exciting area in which to invest .",
    "the problems are compelling , they excite the public , they stimulate education and technology , and they deserve more than the $ 1b / year currently devoted to the astrophysics division of nasa",
    ". a rising tide will raise all ships ( and many wavelength bands ) .",
    "travel funding to annapolis was generously provided by nasa / gsfc .",
    "our group s research support at the university of colorado for uv studies of the igm and galactic halo gas comes from cos grant nnx08-ac14 g and stsci spectroscopic archive grants ( ar-10645.02-a and ar-11773.01-a ) . i would also like to express appreciation for many years of nasa support from the fuse data analysis program , which enabled so many new ism and igm discoveries through far - uv spectroscopy ."
