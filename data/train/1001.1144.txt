    "entanglement plays a very important role in quantum information processes @xcite ( see also references therein ) .",
    "even if different parts of the quantum system ( quantum register ) are initially disentangled , entanglement naturally appears in the process of quantum protocols .",
    "this `` constructive entanglement '' must be preserved during the time of quantum information processing . on the other hand ,",
    "the system generally becomes entangled with the environment .",
    "this `` destructive entanglement '' must be minimized in order to achieve a needed fidelity of quantum algorithms .",
    "the importance of these effects calls for the development of rigorous mathematical tools for analyzing the dynamics of entanglement and for controlling the processes of constructive and destructive entanglement .",
    "another problem which is closely related to quantum information is quantum measurement .",
    "usually , for a qubit ( quantum two - level system ) , quantum measurements operate under the condition @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the temperature , @xmath2 is the transition frequency , @xmath3 is the planck constant , and @xmath4 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "this condition is widely used in superconducting quantum computation , when @xmath5 and @xmath6 . in this case",
    ", one can use josephson junctions ( jj ) and superconducting quantum interference devices ( squids ) , both as qubits @xcite and as spectrometers @xcite measuring a spectrum of noise and other important effects induced by the interaction with the environment .",
    "understanding the dynamical characteristics of entanglement through the environment on a large time interval will help to develop new technologies for measurements not only of spectral properties , but also of quantum correlations induced by the environment .    in this paper",
    ", we develop a consistent perturbation theory of quantum dynamics of entanglement which is valid for arbitrary times @xmath7 .",
    "this is important in many real situations because ( i ) the characteristic times which usually appear in quantum systems with two and more qubits involve different time - scales , ranging from a relatively fast decay of entanglement and different reduced density matrix elements ( decoherence ) to possibly quite large relaxation times , and ( ii ) for not exactly solvable quantum hamiltonians ( describing the energy exchange between the system and the environment ) one can only use a perturbative approach in order to estimate the characteristic dynamical parameters of the system .",
    "note , that generally not only are the time - scales for decoherence and entanglement different , but so are their functional time - dependences .",
    "indeed , usually the off - diagonal reduced density matrix elements in the basis of the quantum register do not decay to zero for large times , but remain at the level of @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is a characteristic constant of interaction between a qubit and an environment @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , entanglement has a different functional time dependence , and in many cases decays to zero in finite time .",
    "another problem which we analyze in this paper is a well - known cut - off procedure which one must introduce for high frequencies of the environment in order to have finite expressions for the interaction hamiltonian between the quantum register and the environment .",
    "generally , this artificial cut - off frequency enters all expressions in the theory for physical parameters , including decay rates and dynamics of observables . at the same time",
    ", one does not have this cut - off problem in real experimental situations .",
    "so , it would be very desirable to develop a regular theoretical approach to derive physical expressions which do not include the cut - off parameter .",
    "we show that our approach allows us to derive these cut - off independent expressions as the main terms of the perturbation theory , which is of @xmath8 .",
    "the cut - off terms are included in the corrections of @xmath10 . at the same time , the low - frequency divergencies still remain in the theory , and need additional conditions for their removal .",
    "we describe the characteristic dynamical properties of the simplest quantum register which consists of two not directly interacting qubits ( effective spins ) , which interact with local and collective environments .",
    "we introduce a classification of the decoherence times based on a partition of the reduced density matrix elements in the energy basis into clusters .",
    "this classification , valid for general @xmath11-level systems coupled to reservoirs , is rather important for dealing with quantum algorithms with large registers . indeed , in this case different orders of  quantumness \" decay on different time - scales .",
    "the classification of decoherence time - scales which we suggest will help to separate environment - induced effects which are important from the unimportant ones for performing a specific quantum algorithm .",
    "we point out that all the populations ( diagonal of density matrix ) always belong to the same cluster to which is associated the relaxation time .",
    "we present analytical and numerical results for decay and creation of entanglement for both solvable ( integrable , energy conserving ) and unsolvable ( non - integrable , energy - exchange ) models , and explain the relations between them .",
    "this paper is devoted to a physical and numerical discussion of the dynamical resonance theory , and its application to the evolution of entanglement .",

    "they can be calculated explicitly in concrete models .",
    "we have therefore a simple approximation of the true dynamics , valid homogeneously in time .",
    "this is an _ advantage _ of the resonance representation .",
    "limitation _ is that this method can not describe the evolution of quantities ( averages of observables ) which are of the order of the square of the coupling parameters , since the error in the approximation is of the same order .",
    "an illustration of this limitation of the method is the large - time behaviour of off - diagonal matrix elements .",
    "generically , all off - diagonals decay to a limit having the size @xmath99 , as @xmath100 @xcite .",
    "as soon as a matrix element is of order @xmath99 , the resonance approximation ( [ 42 ] ) can not resolve its dynamics , since it is of the same order as the remainder .",
    "one of our goals is to describe the evolution of entanglement of the qubits ( see sections [ sectentcre ] , [ numres ] ) . from the above explanations , it is clear that the resonance approximation is well suited to describe decay of initial entanglement of qubits ( if the initial entanglement is much larger than @xmath99 ) .",
    "on the other hand , an initially unentangled qubit state will typically become entangled due to the interaction with reservoirs .",
    "it is expected that the entanglement created may be of the same order as the error in the approximation ( [ 42 ] ) , and hence the question arises if it is possible to describe this process using the resonance approximation .",
    "the answer is positive , as we show numerically in section [ numres ] : indeed we see that the amount of entanglement created is _ independent _ of the coupling strength .",

    "the main dynamics partitions the reduced dynamics into independent clusters of jointly evolving matrix elements , according to ( [ 32 ] ) . depending on the energy level distribution of the two isolated qubits and on the interaction parameters ,",
    "each cluster has its associated decay rate .",
    "it is possible that some clusters decay very quickly , while some others stay populated for much longer times .",
    "the resonance dynamics furnishes us with a very concrete recipe telling us which parts of the matrix elements disappear when .",
    "this reveals a pattern of where in the density matrix quantum properties are lost at which time .",
    "the same feature holds for an arbitrary @xmath11-level system coupled to reservoirs , @xcite , and notably for complex systems ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "in particular , this approach may prove useful in the analysis of feasibility of quantum algorithms performed on @xmath11-qubit registers .",
    "we point out that that _ the diagonal belongs always to a single cluster _ ,",

    "if the energies of the @xmath11-level system are degenerate , then some off - diagonal matrix elements belong to the same cluster as the diagonal as well .",
    "the sum in ( [ 42 ] ) alone , which is the main term in the expansion , preserves the hermiticity but not the positivity of density matrices . in other words , the matrix obtained from this sum may have negative eigenvalues .",
    "since by adding @xmath99 we do get a true density matrix , the mentioned negativity of eigenvalues can only be of @xmath99 .",
    "this can cause complications if one tries to calculate for instance the concurrence by using the main term in ( [ 42 ] ) alone .",
    "indeed , concurrence is not defined in general for a ` density matrix ' having negative eigenvalues .",
    "see also section [ numres ] , numerical results .",
    "it is well known that the time decay of matrix elements is not exponential for all times .",
    "for example , for small times it is quadratic in @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "how is this behaviour compatible with the representation ( [ 42 ] ) , ( [ 35 ] ) , where only exponential time factors @xmath103 are present ?",
    "the answer is that _ up to an error term of @xmath99 _ , the `` overlap coefficients '' ( scalar products in ( [ 35 ] ) ) mix the exponentials in such a way as to produce the correct time behaviour .",
    "since the coupled system has an equilibrium state , one of the resonances @xmath104 is always zero @xcite , we set @xmath105 .",
    "the condition @xmath106 for all @xmath107 except @xmath102 , @xmath78 is equivalent to the entire system ( qubits plus reservoirs ) converging to its equilibrium state for large times .    as we have remarked above",
    ", the decay of matrix elements is not in general exponential , but we can nevertheless represent it ( approximate to order @xmath108 ) in terms of superpositions of exponentials , for all times @xmath7 . in regimes where the actual dynamics has exponential decay ,",
    "the rates coincide with those we obtain from the resonance theory ( large time dynamics , see section [ sectcomp ] and also @xcite ) .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to define the thermalization rate by @xmath109 and the _ cluster decoherence rate _ associated to @xmath98 , @xmath110 , by @xmath111 the interpretation is that the cluster of matrix elements of the true density matrix associated to @xmath110 decays to zero , modulo an error term @xmath99 , at the rate @xmath112 , and the cluster containing the diagonal approaches its equilibrium ( gibbs ) value , modulo an error term @xmath99 , at rate @xmath113 .",
    "if @xmath114 is any of the above rates , then @xmath115 is the corresponding ( thermalization , decoherence ) time .",
    "it should be understood that characterizing the dynamcs via the cluster decoherence and relaxation times corresponds to a ` coarse graining ' : matrix elements are grouped into clusters and the dynamics of clusters is effectively given by a decoherence ( or the relaxation ) time .",
    "expression ( [ 42 ] ) gives much more detail , it gives the dynamics of each single matrix element .",
    "the breakup of the density matrix into individually evolving clusters may be advantageous especially in complex systems , where instead of two qubits , one deals with @xmath11-qubit registers .",
    "* remark on the markovian property .",

    "let us first consider the case of purely energy conserving collective interaction , namely @xmath257 and only @xmath258 .",
