    "the experimentally extracted parameter in the rectification measurement is the optical frequency potential difference , @xmath10 , experienced by the tunnelling electrons . to go from this potential difference to an estimate of the enhanced electric field within the tunnelling gap , it is necessary to estimate the distance over which this voltage is dropped . in the main manuscript we use @xmath17 ,",
    "the interelectrode spacing inferred from the ( low frequency ) tunnelling conductance .",
    "the question arises , is this reasonable given that @xmath10 is oscillating at optical frequencies ?",
    "there are two relevant issues : the local character of the tunnelling process , and the penetration of electric field ( and hence voltage drops ) into the metal electrodes .",
    "the rectification process is sensitive to the chemical potential difference experienced by precisely the tunnelling electrons . because of the local nature of the tunnelling process",
    ", the chemical potential difference we infer experimentally is measured between the `` initial '' and `` final '' positions of the tunnelling electrons .",
    "the inferred @xmath10 is the voltage difference that drives the ( extremely local ) tunnelling process .",
    "it is self - consistent to use the gap size extracted from tunnelling conductance as the relevant distance scale , since the local character of the tunnelling electrons is not expected to be frequency dependent ( that is , there is no expectation that tunnelling takes place over longer distances at higher frequencies ) .",
    "additional voltage drops on longer scales within the metal electrodes are perfectly allowed , but not relevant to the inferred @xmath10 since the local tunnelling process is not sensitive to them",
    ". the observed consistency between @xmath9 and @xmath75 over the whole bias range would be very difficult to understand if the local nature of the tunnelling process was fundamentally different between low and optical frequencies .",
    "this is certainly a subtle issue .",
    "the definition of local electrostatic potential and its relationship with chemical potential in nanoscale junctions is not simple@xmath76 , since electronic distributions are driven out of equilibrium on a distance scale comparable to the inelastic scattering length .",
    "a full treatment of optical - frequency tunnelling with realistic electronic structure of the contacts ( well beyond the scope of the present work ) would be needed to resolve this issue unambiguously .",
    "the experimentally determined quantities in the main manuscript ( tunnelling conductance , @xmath10 ) could be compared with more sophisticated calculations in the future .",
    "regarding field penetration into the metal , care is also required .",
    "the skin depth , which describes the characteristic attenuation length for the electric field of a plane wave normally incident on a metal surface , is related to the complex dielectric function at the incident frequency . for gold at the incident wavelength of 785  nm , the skin depth is approximately 25  nm .",
    "however , the skin depth calculation ignores collective electronic response such as plasmons .",
    "in fact , in plasmonic nanostructures , while the field due to the incident radiation does penetrate the metal on length scales comparable to the skin depth , the total electric field _ including that produced by the plasmon response of the electron fluid _ can be confined much more strongly than this .",
    "supplemental figures [ fig : fieldsfig1]-[fig : fieldsfig3 ] demonstrate this explicitly .",
    "these figures show the results of a finite element simulation ( using the commercial package comsol ) of a model nanogap structure illuminated at the nanogap plasmon resonance .",
    "the figures show top views of the metal structure at three different magnifications indicated by the scale bars .",
    "the metal is modeled as au ( using the commonly employed johnson and christy dielectric function@xmath77 ) 25  nm in thickness ( chosen for computational efficiency ) .",
    "the nanogap separation is 10  nm , except in the center of the device , where a protrusion on the left - hand electrode reduces the gap to 5  nm .",
    "no dielectric substrate is included , but other models including such a substrate give qualitatively identical results .",
    "the incident radiation is assumed to be a plane wave at normal incidence with a free space wavelength of 850  nm and a polarization directed along the line connecting the two electrodes ( left - right in the figures ) .",
    "upper figures show the magnitude of the total electric field ( normalized by the incident amplitude ) on a linear color scale , while lower figures use a ( natural ) logarithmic color scale .",
    "it is immediately clear that the vast majority of the potential drop between the two electrodes takes place across the vacuum at the center of the nanogap .",
    "electric field does extend into the metal , but it is smaller than the nanogap field , by a factor of more than 50 in this case , a larger difference than one would expect based on a skin depth analysis that ignores plasmonic effects . for smaller electrode separations , this disparity grows even further , with essentially 100% of the ( plasmon - dominated ) optically induced potential difference dropping across the vacuum .",
    "the situation is , of course , complicated in the real devices by the true electronic structure of the metal surfaces at the atomic scale , and tunnelling conduction .",
    "for very small gaps and distance scales , one must not trust the quantitative accuracy of finite - element or finite - difference time - domain calculations based on idealizations ( infinitely sharp dielectric interfaces ; bulk - like dielectric functions for the electrons and background charges at interfaces ) .",
    "however , in plasmon resonant structures such as these , the fact remains that a very large fraction of the potential drop takes place between the electrodes , and the skin depth is _ not _ the relevant length scale to describe electric field confinement .",
    "the excitation of plasmon collective modes strongly perturbs the charge density extremely local to the surface , leading to field distributions that can differ greatly from those inferred in the absence of such collective effects .",
    "for example , liebsch@xmath78 shows that the presence of a surface plasmon excitation in a silver film or nanoparticle dynamically leads to surface charge density within a couple of atomic radii of the surface , with a length scale determined by quantum mechanical electronic structure effects and _ not _ by macroscopic electrodynamic effects such as the classical skin depth .",
    "here we describe in more detail the theoretical methods used for the computation of the structural , electronic , and electrical properties of gold nanocontacts . moreover , we present an analysis of the geometry dependence of the conductance decay with interelectrode distance .      for the determination of the electronic structure and geometry of the gold contacts we employ density functional theory ( dft ) as implemented in the ri - dft module of the quantum chemistry package _ turbomole",

    "total energies are converged to a precision of better than @xmath82 atomic units , and structure optimization is carried out until the maximum norm of the cartesian gradients has fallen below values of @xmath39 atomic units .",
    "an example of the contact geometries considered in this work is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : au - contact]a , which corresponds to the junction of fig .  4 in the manuscript .",
    "in this case , a single - atom contact is modeled by means of the extended central cluster ( ecc ) with 63 atoms displayed in fig .  [ fig : au - contact]b .",
    "it consists of two pyramids grown along the @xmath71 direction of a fcc lattice , which contain , beside a common tip atom , four layers with 3 , 6 , 10 , and 12 atoms .",
    "we formally divide the contact geometry into left ( @xmath83 ) , central ( @xmath84 ) , and right ( @xmath85 ) parts , and relax the atomic positions of the atoms in the @xmath84 region , i.e.  those of the tip atom and the neighboring layers with three atoms .",
    "in contrast , the atoms in the @xmath83 and @xmath85 regions are kept fixed , and the lattice constant is set to @xmath86  , the experimental bulk value for gold .    in order to simulate what happens when the wires are broken and when one enters the tunnelling regime , we stretch the ecc ( fig .",

    "( @xmath87  ) .",
    "after every stretching step , the geometries are reoptimized by relaxing the @xmath84 region .      to compute the charge transport properties we apply a method based on standard green s function techniques and the landauer formula expressed in a local nonorthogonal basis , as described in ref .",
    "briefly , the local basis allows us to partition the basis states into @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 ones , according to the division of the contact geometry ( fig .",
    "[ fig : au - contact ] ) .",
