    "the first step in this direction is to identify which are the most detrimental ones in each specific implementation scheme .",
    "this problem has been amply investigated in recent years and it is considered as completely understood in the first generation of superconding qubits @xcite .",
    "those implementations were severely affected by low - frequency fluctuations of control variables of different physical origin .",
    "considerable improvement has been reached by operating the systems at working points naturally protected from low - frequency fluctuations  @xcite or by new architectures implementing schemes of cavity qed in the solid state , the so called circuit - qed schemes  @xcite .",
    "research along these lines also requires considering innovative materials @xcite .    in the present article",
    "we consider a particular superconducting qubit , the double squid tunable qubit @xcite , where coherent oscillations between flux states are obtained by simply applying fast flux pulses ( with respect to the typical qubit timescales ) in the absence of microwaves @xcite-@xcite . here",
    "we report measurements of coherent oscillations at different frequencies obtained by acting on the bias conditions , in particular by modifying the pulse height .",
    "interestingly , modifying the oscillation frequency also affects its decay time and in particular the shape of the decay envelope . with increasing oscillation frequency a crossover between two distinct decoherence regimes",
    "is observed : an exponential quadratic decay followed by an algebraic behavior . in this last regime a working point of minimal decoherence is identified .",
    "the existence of two decoherence regimes can be explained considering a model system including low - frequency fluctuations of the qubit bias and intrinsic parameters .",
    "in particular the existence of an optimal point of reduced sensitivity to defocusing processes is predicted .",
    "our analysis also suggests the possible existence of additional low frequency noise sources not included in our model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 the double squid qubit and",
    "its manipulation with flux pulses are described .",
    "the experimental measurements of the coherent oscillations are reported in section 3 where we also discuss which phase of the manipulation is expected to be more severely influenced by noise sources . in the following section 4 we introduce a theoretical model of decoherence processes during the manipulation phase of the experiment and predict the existence of optimal points in the present setup .",

    ", we need to identify the phases of the manipulation which are presumably more severely affected by noise sources .",
    "the various parts of the experiment can be addressed separately as follows :    * 1 .",
    "initial phase `` w '' : * during the initial `` w '' phase , when the barrier is very high and the system is rigorously prepared in one of the two states , any possible transition between wells is blocked by the high barrier .",
    "the system remains in an eigenstate to high accuracy .",
    "`` w - u - v '' transition : * the effect of noise during this rapid transition is a very difficult problem , involving an out - of - equilibrium dynamics . however , for the present experiment , noise during this phase is presumably irrelevant .",
    "in fact , any noise source acting during this transition should affect the oscillations amplitude independently on the pulse duration .",
    "therefore we expect that it merely produces a net reduction of the visibility of the oscillation at the start time .",
    "since we are able to observe oscillations with high visibilities , up to @xmath84 ( fig.2 ) , we conclude that the effect of noise during this phase is small .",
    "this fact can be tentatively explained by considering that the critical region where the change of the potential shape occurs ( `` u '' region ) is crossed over in a very short time ( of the order of picoseconds ) , shorter than the typical time of coupling with the environment ( few nanoseconds ) .",

    "phase `` v '' : * on the contrary , relaxation and decoherence will act heavily during the single well condition `` v '' , with an effect depending on the time @xmath55 of permanence in this phase .    *",
    "`` v - u - w '' transition : * for the return transition from the single to the double well potential ( `` v - u - w '' ) the same considerations of the `` w - u - v '' transition hold ( based on the initial visibility of the oscillation ) , so that one can conclude that also in this case the effect of noise is rather small .    *",
    "final phase `` w '' : * finally , when the barrier is raised again in the final condition before the readout ( `` w '' ) , transitions between the two wells are again blocked by the barrier . in this case",
    "the final state will be a superposition of the left / right states and the effect of dephasing can be quite strong .",
    "however , since we are just interested on the final population of one of the localized states , the information on the relative phase between the two states can be disregarded .    in conclusion",

    "according to the analysis of the previous section , whereas for @xmath72 we may expect an agreement between eq . and experimental data",
    ", we expect that eq .",
    "for @xmath73 has to be supplemented by an additional contribution of different origin .",
    "therefore , in order to extract @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath155 from the experimental data we fit the envelopes of the experimental curves in considering them as _ independent _ parameters .    indeed , the experimentally estimated @xmath72 for the different oscillation frequencies @xmath82 can be fitted with eq . , giving a remarkable agreement with fitting parameters @xmath156 and @xmath157 , corresponding to @xmath158 and @xmath159a , see ( left panel , blue line ) .",
    "the noise on the flux @xmath22 in addition to the @xmath74 behavior , possibly is also influenced by low frequency noise components due to the room temperature instrumentation .",
    "for the estimated noise variances , fluctuations of the critical current are almost always dominating except for the optimal point at @xmath77ghz where the effect of flux noise emerges .",
    "the existence of this optimal point is evident from the decays in , where a crossover between two decay regimes is observed : a fast decay at lower frequencies is followed by a slower decay at higher frequencies .     ( blue ) and @xmath160 ( red ) as a function of @xmath82 for variances extracted from the fit of @xmath72 , @xmath161 , @xmath162.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    on the other side , the value of @xmath101 obtained form the fit is much larger than the values reported in other superconducting qubits @xcite .",
    "an independent check of this quantity in the present setup is not possible , since measurements of the low - frequency power spectrum of critical current noise are not available at present .",
    "one possible explanation of the quite high value of @xmath163 is related to the materials used for the qubit fabrication .",
    "in fact other superconducting qubits based on the same materials and fabrication technology and displaying coherence times similar to the ones reported in our experiment ( few nanoseconds ) @xcite presented a considerable enhancement of these times by improving the used materials , for example by introducing @xmath164 dielectric films instead of standard @xmath165 for the crossover wiring @xcite .",
    "the full understanding of this point requires the repetition of the experiment with the use of different materials and technologies .",
    "another possible source of this inconsistency stems from the assumed gaussian distribution for the critical current fluctuations , @xmath90 .",
    "evaluating possible deviations from the gaussian approximation requires considering a microscopic model of critical current fluctuations .",
    "this is another possible extension of the present analysis .",
    "the values of @xmath73 extracted from the fit of the oscillations in are scattered around an average value @xmath166 , as shown in .",
    "equation for @xmath73 with @xmath167 and @xmath157 predicts @xmath168 , in contrast with the observations .",
    "however , including a constant ( frequency independent ) noise contribution in the second order terms , i.e. defining an effective @xmath169 , the crossover from exponential to algebraic decay where @xmath170 visible in can be quantitatively reconstructed , as illustrated in .",
    "finally , the reported measurements do not allow for a reliable estimate of the effect of quantum noise , included in the exponential decay term with @xmath85 .",
    "the observations are compatible with a decoherence time @xmath85 with a lower limit of tens of nanoseconds , which is reasonable in this type of qubits @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we considered the manipulation of a double squid qubit by fast flux pulses , and observed the decay envelope of the obtained oscillations for different control conditions , corresponding to different oscillation frequencies .",
    "the shapes of the decay envelopes show a peculiar behaviour with a crossover between two distinct regimes .",
    "these behaviors can be attributed to various sources of adiabatic noise affecting the system .",
    "the effect of high frequency noise is negligible , and this indicates a correct filtering and shielding of the system .",
    "we observed a crossover between an exponential and an algebraic decay regime , with an optimal point where decay is algebraic .",
    "we demonstrated that this behavior is due to the interplay of first order effects of low - frequency flux and critical current noise .",
    "in general , intrinsic fluctuation of the critical current dominate except at the optimal point where the weaker effect of flux bias fluctuations springs up . the existence of the optimal point is an interesting characteristic for possible applications .",
    "the effect of second order fluctuating terms is still misunderstood and will require further investigation . to this end",
    "we plan to repeat the experiment with different , improved materials .",
    "the ensuing noise characterization may possibly provide new insights into the low - frequency noise sources in this kind of setup .",
