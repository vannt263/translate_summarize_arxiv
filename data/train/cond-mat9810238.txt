    "in addition , even to leading order the spin conductance for @xmath14 invariant systems is suppressed further by the usual constructive interference between paths and their time reverse which explains the larger suppression in that case .",
    "having established the presence of a singular suppression of the density of states in perturbation theory , we now consider the opposite limit of strong disorder when the system is localized .",

    "this may be performed , as usual , by regularizing the sigma model on a lattice .",
    "the leading term in the strong coupling expansion is the zero dimensional limit of the sigma model which is equivalent to the random matrix theory of hamiltonians with these symmetries . in the random matrix limit ,",
    "it is known@xcite that the density of states vanishes in the manner disussed above .",
    "these results on the localized phase can be verified in great detail in one spatial dimension for systems without @xmath14 .",

    "we arrive , as usual , at a one dimensional dirac theory with various sorts of randomness .",
