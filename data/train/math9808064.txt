    "we say a foliation @xmath3 of a compact @xmath0manifold @xmath4 is _",
    "@xmath1covered _ if the pulled back foliation @xmath5 of the universal cover @xmath6 of @xmath4 is topologically the standard foliation of @xmath7 by horizontal @xmath8 s .",
    "the first step in our construction is to produce a manifold @xmath4 with an @xmath1covered foliation @xmath3 which is not uniform .",
    "the condition that a foliation be @xmath1covered is a somewhat elusive one , and in particular it does not seem to be sufficient to find a cover @xmath9 of @xmath4 so that the leaf space of @xmath10 is @xmath1 .",
    "this is related to the question of when an infinite braid in @xmath7 is trivial .",
    "a taut foliation @xmath3 of @xmath4 is @xmath1covered iff @xmath3 has no spherical or projective plane leaves , and for every arc @xmath11 between two points @xmath12 there is an arc @xmath13 homotopic to @xmath11 rel .",
    "endpoints which is either contained in a leaf of @xmath3 or which is everywhere transverse to @xmath3 .    if @xmath3 is @xmath1covered , lift @xmath11 to some @xmath14 in @xmath6 and make it transverse there .",
    "if @xmath3 is not @xmath1covered , either @xmath4 is covered by @xmath15 or the leaf space @xmath16 of @xmath5 is a non - hausdorff simply connected @xmath17manifold .",
    "this follows from a theorem of palmeira , which says that the foliation of @xmath7 by the universal cover of a taut foliation is topologically equivalent to a product of a foliation on @xmath8 and @xmath1 , and therefore such a foliation of @xmath7 by planes whose leaf space is @xmath1 is a product foliation ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , there are distinct leaves @xmath18 which can not be joined by an immersed path in @xmath16 .",
    "that is , the topology of @xmath16 provides an obstruction to finding such a @xmath13 as above .",
    "note that one does not have an analogue of palmeira s theorem for arbitrary open @xmath0manifolds  that a foliation with leaf space @xmath1 should be a product  and in fact this is not true .",
    "for example , remove from @xmath7 foliated by horizontal @xmath8 s a properly embedded bi - infinite transverse curve which does not intersect every leaf .",
    "this is where the difficulty resides in showing that a foliation is @xmath1covered by investigating an intermediate cover .",
    "many ( most ? ) taut foliations of @xmath0manifolds are not @xmath1covered . in particular , by a theorem of fenley , an @xmath1covered foliation of a hyperbolic @xmath0manifold has the property that in the universal cover , every leaf limits to all of @xmath19 .",
    "however , any compact leaf of a taut foliation which is not a fiber of a fibration over @xmath20 lifts to a quasi - isometrically embedded plane in the universal cover , and its limit set is a quasicircle ( see @xcite for a fuller discussion ) .",
    "a taut foliation @xmath3 of a compact @xmath0manifold @xmath4 is _ uniform _ if in the pullback foliation @xmath5 of the universal cover @xmath6 , every two leaves @xmath21 are a bounded distance apart .",
    "that is , there is some @xmath22 depending on @xmath21 so that @xmath23 is contained in the @xmath22neighborhood of @xmath24 , and vice versa .",
    "a foliation @xmath3 is obtained from a _ slithering over @xmath20 _ if there is a fibration @xmath25 such that @xmath26 acts as bundle maps of this fibration , and such that the foliation of @xmath6 by components of the fibers of @xmath27 agrees with @xmath5 .",
    "we will also refer to such a foliation , perhaps ungrammatically , as a slithering .    for additional details and definitions , see @xcite .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that a uniform foliation with every leaf dense is obtained from a slithering .",
    "it is almost tautological from the definition of a slithering over @xmath20 that the action of @xmath26 on the leaf space @xmath16 of @xmath5 is conjugate to a representation in @xmath28 , the universal central extension of @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath0manifold topologists will be familiar with the short exact sequence @xmath30 this sits inside the short exact sequence @xmath31 informally , @xmath32 is the group of homeomorphisms of @xmath1 which are periodic with period @xmath17",
    ".    let @xmath33 be the generator of the center of @xmath28 .",
    "then @xmath33 acts on @xmath16 by translations , and by choosing an invariant metric on @xmath16 for this action , the action of every element of @xmath26 on @xmath16 is periodic with some period equal to the translation length of @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath33 is known as _ the slithering map_.    the condition that a foliation be uniform is reflected in the action of @xmath26 on @xmath16 in the following way : since leaves do not converge or diverge too much at infinity , holonomy can not expand or contract the leaf space too much .",
    "every compact interval in @xmath16 can be included in a larger compact interval which is `` incompressible '' : no element of @xmath26 takes it to a proper subset or superset of itself .",
    "if every leaf is dense , @xmath16 can be tiled with a countable collection of these incompressible intervals laid end to end , so that the slithering map @xmath33 acts on this tiling as a permutation .",
    "note that a foliation @xmath3 may come from a slithering in many different ways .",
    "for instance , if @xmath3 admits a nonsingular transverse measure then the leaf space of @xmath5 inherits an invariant measure making it isometric to @xmath1 .",
    "then for any real @xmath34 there is a slithering @xmath35 defined by the composition @xmath36 where the last map is reduction mod @xmath37 .",
    "since the action of @xmath26 on @xmath16 preserves the property of points being integral multiples of @xmath37 apart , this map is a slithering .",
    "however _ generic _ foliations come from a slithering in essentially at most one way . the slithering map @xmath33 commutes with the action of every element of @xmath26",
    "so , for instance , if an element @xmath11 acts on @xmath16 with isolated fixed points , the map @xmath33 must permute this fixed point set .",
    "if , further , the action of @xmath26 on @xmath16 is minimal ( ie every leaf of @xmath3 is dense ) , the map @xmath33 is determined uniquely up to taking iterates .",
    "that is , there is a _ minimal _",
    "slithering @xmath25 with the property that for every other slithering @xmath38 determining the same foliation , there is a finite cover @xmath39 so that @xmath40 .",
    "this theory is developed in @xcite .",
    "following @xcite we define some auxiliary structure that will be used to show that certain foliations are uniform or @xmath1covered .",
    "let @xmath41 transverse to @xmath3 be a vector field .",
    "then @xmath41 is _ regulating _ if the lifts of the integral curves of @xmath41 to @xmath6 intersect every leaf of @xmath5 .    these lifts determine a one dimensional foliation of @xmath6 . a leaf in this foliation and a leaf in @xmath5 intersect in exactly one point , and",
    "consequently one can identify the leaf space of the one dimensional foliation with any fixed leaf of @xmath5that is , with @xmath8 .",
    "such one dimensional foliations are called _ product covered _ in @xcite . the main point for our purposes of this structure is the following theorem :    [ excise_loop ] suppose @xmath3 is uniform ( respectively @xmath1covered ) and @xmath41 is a transverse regulating vector field with a closed trajectory @xmath11 .",
    "then the restriction of @xmath3 to @xmath42 is also uniform ( respectively @xmath1covered ) .",
    "the universal cover @xmath6 of @xmath4 is foliated as a product by @xmath5 and the integral curves of @xmath41 give this the structure of a product @xmath43 in such a way that @xmath26 acts by elements of @xmath44 .",
    "let @xmath45 be obtained from @xmath6 by removing the lifts of @xmath11 .",
    "then @xmath45 is the cover of @xmath42 corresponding to the subgroup of @xmath46 normally generated by the meridian of @xmath11 .",
    "one sees from the structure of @xmath41 that @xmath45 is foliated as a product by infinitely punctured disks and therefore that @xmath47 is @xmath7 foliated by horizontal @xmath8 s . if @xmath3 was uniform , any two leaves in @xmath45 would be a finite distance apart . but",
    "leaves in @xmath47 correspond bijectively with leaves in @xmath45 under the covering projection and therefore the same is true in @xmath47 ; that is , the restriction of @xmath3 to @xmath42 is uniform .",
    "notice from the construction that if @xmath3 came from a slithering , then the restriction of @xmath3 to @xmath42 comes from a slithering which agrees with the restriction of the slithering map on @xmath6 to the complement of the lifts of @xmath11 .",
    "let @xmath48 denote the surface of genus @xmath49 with @xmath50 punctures .",
    "then @xmath51 is the punctured torus , and @xmath52 .",
    "let @xmath53 be standard generators for @xmath54 .",
    "then we can choose a representation @xmath55 of @xmath56 by sending @xmath57 to translation through length @xmath37 and @xmath58 to some monotone element perhaps with a periodic collection of fixed points , each distance @xmath17 apart .",
    "let @xmath59 be the trivial circle bundle @xmath60 over the punctured torus , and pick a flat @xmath29 connection on this bundle whose holonomy realizes the representation @xmath55 . note that after fixing a trivialization of the product , the representation is well - defined in @xmath28 and not just @xmath29 .",
    "the distribution determined by this connection is integrable , by flatness , and integrates to give a foliation @xmath61 .",
    "geometrically , there is a foliation of @xmath62 by leaves @xmath63 .",
    "@xmath54 acts on this space by @xmath64 which preserves the foliation .",
    "this foliation therefore descends to a foliation on @xmath65 transverse to the @xmath20 fibers .",
    "this foliation of @xmath59 comes from an obvious slithering @xmath66 which is just projection onto the second factor followed by the covering map @xmath67 corresponding to the circles in @xmath59 .",
    "the action of @xmath68 on the leaf space is exactly given by the representation @xmath55 in @xmath69 thought of as sitting in @xmath70 .",
    "then the curve @xmath71 sits in @xmath59 transverse to @xmath61 , and there is also a foliation on @xmath72 which we also denote by @xmath61 .",
    "it is easy to see that for irrational choice of @xmath37 the foliation @xmath61 has every leaf dense .",
    "furthermore we have the following lemma :    [ regulates ] the foliation @xmath61 of @xmath72 comes from a slithering .",
    "furthermore , this slithering can be taken to be the restriction of @xmath73 to the complement of the lifts of @xmath57 in @xmath74 .",
    "moreover , by choosing @xmath75 suitably generic , this slithering is minimal as defined above .    by theorem  [ excise_loop ] it suffices to show",
    "there is a regulating vector field of @xmath59 which agrees with @xmath76 when restricted to @xmath11 . since @xmath59 is topologically just @xmath77 it has a projection map to @xmath51 .",
    "let @xmath78 be the torus foliated by circles that is the preimage of the curve @xmath11 on @xmath51 under this projection .",
    "then @xmath79 has an obvious codimension @xmath80 foliation by @xmath20 fibers .",
    "we extend this foliation over @xmath81 , which can be parameterized as @xmath82 $ ] , by foliating each @xmath83 with parallel lines which rotate continuously from vertical ( parallel to the @xmath84 direction in @xmath59 ) on the boundary to horizontal ( parallel to @xmath11 ) on @xmath78 , always staying transverse to @xmath61 .",
    "it is obvious that this is a foliation by regulating curves , and we denote its associated unit tangent vector field by @xmath85 .",
    "if we choose @xmath75 to be generic and close to the identity with isolated fixed points , the slithering defined in the statement of the theorem is minimal .    on another punctured torus with basis for @xmath86 given by @xmath87",
    "we pick another representation @xmath88 in @xmath32 so that @xmath89 is translation through @xmath90 , where again @xmath90 is irrational and incommensurable with @xmath37 , and @xmath91 is some random element which commutes with @xmath33 but not with @xmath92",
    ". then we can form @xmath93 foliated as above , and remove @xmath92 from @xmath94 to produce another foliated manifold with a slithering .",
    "let @xmath4 be obtained by gluing @xmath95 and @xmath96 along the torus boundaries of neighborhoods of @xmath57 and @xmath92 respectively .",
    "denote this torus in the sequel by @xmath97 .",
    "each piece @xmath72 , @xmath96 admits a regulating vector field @xmath98 as constructed in lemma  [ regulates ] .",
    "we perform this gluing in such a way that the foliations of the boundary tori by meridional circles agree .",
    "if we like , we can perform the gluing so that the restriction of the slithering maps for the left and the right foliations commute , when restricted to their action on the leaf space of the universal cover of @xmath99 .",
    "then @xmath100 acts on @xmath1 by the amalgamated action of each piece on the leaf space of its respective universal cover , each canonically identified with the leaf space of the foliation of @xmath101 .",
    "topologically , @xmath4 is a graph manifold obtained from four copies of @xmath102 . to see this ,",

    "also , observe that @xmath104 $ ] in many different ways , including a way in which @xmath11 is @xmath105 .",
    "it follows that @xmath106 is topologically also @xmath102 .",
    "however , these foliations by circles can not be made to agree on the boundary tori of different pieces , and @xmath4 is not a seifert fibered space .",
    "let @xmath3 denote the induced foliation of @xmath4 .",
    "is @xmath3 @xmath1covered ? to establish that it is indeed @xmath1covered , it will suffice to show that each piece is uniform and admits a regulating transverse vector field @xmath98 which agree on the gluing torus to make a global regulating vector field @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath3 is an @xmath1covered foliation of @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath9 foliated by @xmath10 be the cover of @xmath4 obtained by taking copies of the universal covers of @xmath59 and @xmath94 , drilling out countably many copies of the lifts of @xmath57 and @xmath92 , then gluing along the boundary components . then the regulating vector fields @xmath98 lift to @xmath9 to give a global trivialization of this manifold as a product of an infinite genus riemann surface with @xmath1 .",
    "this implies that the universal cover of @xmath9 is the standard @xmath7 foliated by @xmath8 s , and we see therefore that @xmath3 is @xmath1covered .",
    "since every leaf of @xmath3 is dense in @xmath4 , if @xmath3 were uniform it would come from a slithering by @xcite .",
    "however , we have seen that the action of @xmath26 on the leaf space of the universal cover is the amalgamation of the actions of @xmath107 and @xmath108 along their gluing @xmath109 .",
    "it follows that there is no single translation @xmath110 ( ie an element without fixed points ) which commutes with both @xmath58 and @xmath111 for sufficiently generic choice of @xmath91 and @xmath75 , since the periods of the left and right slithering maps are incommensurable .",
    "more explicitly , let us fix a lift @xmath101 of the torus @xmath99 to @xmath6 which divides a piece of @xmath6 which is a lift of @xmath72 from a piece which is a lift of @xmath112 .",

    "the only translations in @xmath116 that commute with @xmath75 are multiples of @xmath114 , whereas the only translations that commute with @xmath91 are multiples of @xmath115 .",
    "it follows that no translation commutes with both elements , and @xmath3 does not come from a slithering .",
    "we have therefore proved the following theorem :    @xmath3 as above is @xmath1covered but not uniform .",

    "are discussed in @xcite , and shown to exist for all uniform foliations .",
    "we show that the example constructed in the previous section admits a regulating cone field .",
    "each piece @xmath72 , @xmath124 admits a regulating cone field @xmath125 which is degenerate along the boundary torus , coming from the restriction of the regulating cone fields on @xmath126 which are tangent to @xmath57 and @xmath92 .",

    "@xmath119 as defined above is a regulating cone field for @xmath3 .",

    "let @xmath133 denote the metric on @xmath16 , the leaf space of @xmath10 , given by the transverse measure on @xmath134 scaled so that the curves @xmath135 have period @xmath17 and so that the left and right slithering maps act by translations of this measure , as measured in the cylinder @xmath132 .",
    "then we claim the following lemma :    if @xmath132 and @xmath136 are separated by @xmath50 cylinders @xmath137 then for any two leaves @xmath18 , @xmath138    the proof follows immediately by induction once we show the result for @xmath139 . if @xmath132 and @xmath136 bound a single @xmath140 or @xmath141 , then the fact that the pieces @xmath140 and @xmath141 slither over @xmath20 implies that @xmath142 and @xmath143 differ by at most one period of the slithering , which in terms of the measure on the boundary torus , is either @xmath117 or @xmath118 depending on whether we are in an @xmath140 or an @xmath141 .",

    "in particular , it is regulating .",
    "after re - ordering indices , any such infinite curve in @xmath9 , starting on some leaf @xmath146 , can be broken up into segments @xmath147 where each @xmath148 is contained in @xmath140 or @xmath141 ( according to sign ) .",
    "it is clear that if there are only finitely many @xmath148 ( ie @xmath145 crosses only finitely many separating annuli ) then eventually @xmath145 can be seen to be regulating , since it is supported by some lift of @xmath128 or @xmath127 .",

    "the points @xmath181 and @xmath182 in the universal cover are on leaves which are one period of the slithering apart .    for a point @xmath183 in @xmath74",
    "given in co - ordinates by @xmath181 , let @xmath184 be the leaf of @xmath185 through @xmath183 , and @xmath186 the leaf of @xmath185 through @xmath182 .",
    "then the leaves @xmath184 and @xmath186 differ by a translation parallel to the @xmath187-axis of length @xmath17 .",

    "@xmath186 will be a small perturbation of the horizontal plane through @xmath183 , and the intersection of the light cone of @xmath174 through @xmath183 with @xmath186 will also be a compact region .",
    "now , @xmath72 is not compact , but we can consider its double @xmath45 , foliated by the double of @xmath172 , and equipped with a transverse lorentz cone field obtained by doubling @xmath174 which is degenerate along the boundary components of @xmath72 .",
    "the compactness of @xmath45 implies that for a sufficiently small perturbation @xmath172 of @xmath61 , the intersections as above will be compact for all @xmath183 .",
    "this implies that a curve supported by @xmath174 will need to go only a bounded distance before traveling a full period of the slithering .",
    "in particular , any bi - infinite curve supported by @xmath174 will travel through infinitely many periods of the slithering in either direction and will therefore be regulating , which is what we wanted to show .",
    "what is really essential to notice in the above set up is that the leaves passing through @xmath181 and @xmath182 in the universal cover were one period of the slithering away from each other for _ all _ @xmath61 . in some sense",
    ", all the slitherings are determined by the structure of the seifert fibration where they originated . for a generic perturbation of a uniform foliation ,",
    "one has no control over how the slithering map may vary , or even whether the perturbed foliations are uniform at all .",
    "since for a transversely measured foliation , _ any _ transverse lorentz cone field is regulating , we can choose our curve @xmath145 to be any curve transverse to a measured foliation @xmath172 with hyperbolic complement which is sufficiently steep near the separating torus , and then choose the representation @xmath75 to be sufficiently close to a translation that @xmath145 stays in a regulating cone field .    since @xmath188 is hyperbolic , for sufficiently large",
    "@xmath50 an @xmath50fold branched cover of @xmath4 over @xmath145 is hyperbolic .",
    "one can not be sure that an @xmath50fold branched cover will always exist , but at least one has a hyperbolic orbifold structure on @xmath4 with cone angle @xmath189 along @xmath145 , and by selberg s lemma ( see @xcite ) one knows this is finitely ( orbifold ) covered by a genuine hyperbolic manifold which is a branched cover of @xmath4 along @xmath145 .    by the discussion above",
    ", the induced foliation is @xmath1covered but not uniform .",
    "moreover , by choosing @xmath75 and @xmath91 sufficiently close to translations , the foliation @xmath3 is as close to a transversely measured foliation as we like . passing to a branched cover preserves this fact .",
    "since transversely measured foliations of @xmath0manifolds are arbitrarily close ( as @xmath80plane fields ) to surface bundles over @xmath20 , we have proved :    there exist foliations of hyperbolic @xmath0manifolds which are @xmath1covered but not uniform .",
    "they can be chosen arbitrarily close to surface bundles over circles .",
    "it is clear that the construction outlined above can be made in some generality .",
    "one can construct @xmath1covered but not uniform foliations by plumbing together uniform foliations along boundary tori in numerous ways . in a great number of cases",
    ", these will admit regulating transverse cone fields , and by branching as above one can produce many atoroidal examples .",
    "one can easily arrange for these examples to be closed ; for instance , by doubling @xmath4 before removing a curve with atoroidal complement in the examples constructed above .",
    "another construction , explained in detail in @xcite , involves choosing a train track with integer weights supported by a regulating cone field , then plumbing the leaves along the train track with a surface of genus given by the track weight .",
    "these plumbed surfaces can be `` twisted '' by a surface automorphism under the monodromy around loops of the train track .",
    "thurston expects that these examples are sufficiently flexible to allow one to prescribe the homology of @xmath4 .",
    "we show in @xcite that the circles at infinity of each leaf in the universal cover of @xmath4 can be included in a topological _ cylinder at infinity",
    "_ @xmath190 on which @xmath26 acts by homeomorphisms .      with notation as above , there is a global trivialization of @xmath190 as @xmath191 so that the action of @xmath26 preserves the horizontal and vertical foliations of @xmath190 by @xmath192 and @xmath193 .    in @xcite it is suggested that _ all _ taut foliations should have a pair of essential laminations @xmath194 transverse to each other and to the foliation which intersect each leaf in a ( @xmath17dimensional ) geodesic lamination . in the case of @xmath1covered foliations , these laminations should come from a pair of @xmath17dimensional laminations @xmath195 of the universal @xmath20 described in the theorem above which are invariant under the action of @xmath26 .",
    "let the universal @xmath20 bound a hyperbolic plane @xmath196 , and let @xmath195 be the associated geodesic laminations in @xmath196 . then since each circle at infinity is canonically associated with this @xmath20 , each point in @xmath197 determines a unique point in each leaf of @xmath5 .",
    "similarly , each segment of @xmath198 between points of intersection determines a unique geodesic segment in each leaf , and each complementary region determines a unique geodesic polygon in each leaf .",
    "if one fixes some canonical geometric parameterization of the family of convex geodesic polygons of a fixed combinatorial type , this parameterization gives rise to a canonical identification of each leaf with each other leaf , preserving the stratification outlined above .",
    "the fibers of this identification give a one - dimensional foliation transverse to @xmath5 , and the tangent vectors to this foliation are a regulating vector field .",
    "it is easy to see that non - quadrilateral complementary regions in @xmath196 give rise to solid cylinders in @xmath6 which cover solid tori in @xmath4 , since their cores are isolated .",
    "the cores of these solid tori are necessarily regulating , and therefore define elements of @xmath26 which act on the leaf space by translation .",
    "in fact , thurston has communicated to this author a sketch of a proof that an @xmath1covered foliation admits _ some _ transverse lamination which intersects every leaf in geodesics ( though not necessarily a pair of such ) . in @xcite",
    "we can show by methods slightly different to those above that this assumption is enough to imply that there exists a regulating vector field transverse to @xmath3 which can be chosen to have closed orbits . in short , we have the following theorem :    let @xmath3 be an @xmath1covered foliation . then there exists a regulating vector field transverse to @xmath3 which can be taken to have closed orbits .",
    "these orbits determine elements @xmath199 which act on the leaf space of @xmath5 without fixed points . branched",
    "covers of @xmath4 over these closed orbits give new @xmath1covered foliations .",
    "one hopes these results are all pieces of a unified picture tying the intrinsic geometry of @xmath1covered foliations to the extrinsic geometry of the foliated manifolds containing them .",
    "not all the details of this picture are yet visible .",
    "nevertheless , it seems worthwhile to make this picture as explicit as possible .",
    "let @xmath4 be a hyperbolic surface bundle over a circle with fiber @xmath200 and pseudo - anosov monodromy @xmath201 .",
    "let @xmath3 be the induced foliation by surfaces .",
    "let @xmath145 be a simple closed curve on @xmath200 so that @xmath202 .",
    "note that it is easy to show that there exist such examples , by first choosing any @xmath203 and then using the fact that surface groups are lerf to lift to a finite regular cover where @xmath145 and its image are disjoint .",
    "let @xmath9 be the @xmath204cover of @xmath4 defined by the circle direction .",
    "topologically , @xmath9 is @xmath205 foliated by closed surfaces @xmath206 .",
    "let the group @xmath204 generated by the deck translation , which we denote @xmath207 , act by @xmath208 .",
    "let @xmath209 be the annulus @xmath210 $ ] . then by construction , @xmath209 and its translates are disjoint .",
    "let @xmath211 \\to [ -\\epsilon,1 + \\epsilon]$ ] be a homeomorphism close to the identity which moves every point except the endpoints up some small amount .",
    "then we can cut open @xmath9 along @xmath209 and its translates , and shear the foliation on one side by the translation @xmath212 to get a new foliation @xmath213 .",
    "this can certainly be done in such a way that @xmath213 is arbitrarily close to @xmath3 .",
    "let us suppose that by choosing a suitable path in @xmath213 , we can arrange that a curve starting at some @xmath214 can get to @xmath215 in length @xmath37 , as measured in @xmath213 , by winding sufficiently many times through @xmath209 .",
    "now , the curve can continue to wind around @xmath216 , and after moving a distance @xmath217 , it can reach @xmath218 , and so on .",
    "remember that there is a transverse regulating vector field @xmath41 to @xmath3 given by tangents to the curves @xmath175 .",
    "since @xmath219 is pseudo - anosov , when we compare arclength at @xmath220 and @xmath221 by projection along @xmath41 , we see that a vector of norm @xmath222 at @xmath220 might project to a vector of norm @xmath17 at @xmath221 , where @xmath23 is the multiplier of @xmath219 on the invariant transverse measure of the unstable lamination of @xmath200 .",
    "hence , as measured in @xmath213 , a curve @xmath145 beginning at @xmath221 could have length @xmath223 but its projection to @xmath224 could have length as little as @xmath225 .",
    "in particular , a curve in @xmath213 could `` escape to infinity '' while its projection to @xmath226 could move only a finite distance . by picking two points @xmath221 and @xmath227 sufficiently far apart , and moving them by curves in @xmath213 joined by integral curves of @xmath41",
    ", it seems plausible that one could find a path in @xmath213 where holonomy was not defined after some finite time , suggesting that @xmath213 was not @xmath1covered .    of course , there are problems with making this concrete : distances in @xmath213 are only magnified in the direction of the stable lamination as we go upwards ; perhaps to make the curves cross through @xmath209 and its translates sufficiently often , we need to go in both stable and unstable directions .",
    "moreover , even if one could show that holonomy failed to be defined for all time along integral curves of @xmath41 , it does not rule out the possibility that @xmath213 is still @xmath1covered and @xmath41 is merely not regulating , although the author understands that very recently s ' ergio fenley has shown that a pseudo - anosov flow transverse to an @xmath1covered foliation should always be regulating ( @xcite ) .",
    "a similar result is also proved in @xcite .      in writing this paper",
