    "r__@xmath18la @xcite .",
    "in fact , electrical resistivity measurements performed on polycrystalline and thin films of lanio@xmath13 revealed a metal - like behavior down to 1.5 k @xcite . however , in other members of this family , as prnio@xmath13 and ndnio@xmath13 , a very sharp mi transition is frequently verified @xcite .",
    "the temperature @xmath14 , in which the mi transition occurs , has been found to increase systematically as the size of the rare earth ion decreases being 130 k for prnio@xmath13 and reaching values as high as 480 k in eunio@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "these compounds crystallize , in the itinerant - electron phase , in an orthorhombically distorted perovskite structure ( space group @xmath8 )",
    ". a higher distortion of the perovskite structure is often observed when the rare - earth ion size is decreased due to the tilt of the nio@xmath19 octahedra and a consequent reduction of the superexchange ni - o - ni angle @xcite .",
    "these observed features seem to indicate that the mi transition is close related to both the degree of distortion of the ideal perovskite structure and the ni - o - ni bond angle @xcite .    high - resolution neutron powder diffraction ( npd )",
    "experiments performed on prnio@xmath13 , ndnio@xmath13 , and smnio@xmath13 compounds have revealed that the mi transition is accompanied by a small structural change on the unit cells @xcite .",
    "the data also indicate that the unit cell volume undergoes a subtle increase when the system evolves toward the insulator regime due to a slight increase in the average ni - o distance @xcite .",
    "this effect induces additional tilts of the nio@xmath19 octahedra , which also implies in a subtle decrease of the ni - o - ni bond angle .",
    "some recent results in smaller rare earth ions ( _ r _ = ho , y , er and lu ) suggested a change in the crystal symmetry , from orthorhombic @xmath8 to monoclinic @xmath20 , when the system evolves from the metallic to the insulating state , due to a charge disproportionation of ni@xmath21 cations @xcite .",
    "results of electron diffraction and raman scattering indicated a symmetry break also for ndnio@xmath13 @xcite . a direct observation of charge order in epitaxial ndnio@xmath13 films , using resonant x - ray scattering , was also reported @xcite .",
    "these results have led to the proposition that charge disproportionation and the structural phase transition from orthorhombic @xmath22 to monoclinic @xmath20 should occur for all the rare - earth family at @xmath14 , although it would be difficult to discriminate the two types of ni sites .",
    "this charge ordered state would also explain the unusual propagation vector observed in neutron experiments , and it would make models with orbital order obsolete @xcite . on the other hand , mssbauer spectroscopy measurements in the nd@xmath23fe@xmath24nio@xmath13 compound , performed by presniakov _ et al _ @xcite , have showed the existence of only one ni chemical specimen , indicating that there is no charge disproportionation in the insulating phase and , therefore , there is no change in the lattice symmetry for this compound at @xmath14 .    concerning the magnetic properties of these nickelates , muon - spin relaxation experiments carried out on _ _ r__nio@xmath13 perovskites ( _ r _ = pr , nd , sm , eu )",

    "such a behavior has been confirmed by neutron powder diffraction experiments @xcite . the magnetic ordering of the ni sub - lattice exhibits an unusual antiferromagnetic order @xcite that has been interpreted as the result of a spin density wave ( sdw ) phase @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a combination of transport and thermal characterizations have suggested that the character of the mi transition is of first order in compounds that display @xmath27 , and of second order for compounds with @xmath26 @xcite .",

    "et al _ @xcite have revealed two different electronic regimes for the _ _ r__nio@xmath13 compounds with @xmath27 and @xmath26 .",
    "however , a more profound discussion regarding this point requires consideration about the mechanism responsible for the mi transition , which is still a point of controversy in these nickelates .",

    "average ni - o distance @xmath98ni - o@xmath99 and ni - o - ni superexchange angle ( @xmath59 ) for samples of ( a ) ndnio@xmath13 and ( b ) nd@xmath15eu@xmath16nio@xmath13 obtained from rietveld refinements of the npd data.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the temperature dependence of the superexchange angle @xmath59 also exhibits a smooth contraction @xmath102 close to @xmath74 with decreasing temperature , as usually observed in other nickelates @xcite .",
    "an estimate of this angular change at @xmath14 yielded values of @xmath103 and @xmath104 for the samples of ndnio@xmath13 and nd@xmath15eu@xmath16nio@xmath13 , respectively .",
    "however , these changes in @xmath102 across the mi transition can be estimated by considering that such a change is due solely to steric effects , or more appropriately , to the decrease of the average ni - o distance at @xmath14 @xcite .    within this context , it is possible to relate the degree of distortion of the ideal perovskite structure , characterized by the tolerance factor @xmath105 , along with the superexchange angle @xmath59 .",
    "the tolerance factor is defined as    @xmath106    where @xmath107 is the average ( nd / eu)-o distance and @xmath93 is the average ni - o distance .",
    "therefore , a linear approximation which correlates @xmath59 and @xmath105 resulted in @xmath108 . differentiating this relation and the expression for the tolerance factor , and combining both results , the expected variation of the @xmath59 angle ( @xmath102 ) across the mi transition",
    "is given by    @xmath109    where @xmath110 is the variation of @xmath111 at temperatures close to @xmath14 .    by using such an approximation , @xmath102 values of @xmath4@xmath112 and @xmath113",
    "were estimated for the samples with @xmath51 and 0.30 , respectively .",
    "the very good agreement between the measured and estimated values of @xmath102 indicates that the expansion in the structural and geometrical parameters could be understood as a steric response to the increase of the ni - o distance caused by the electronic localization occurring at @xmath14 .",
    "the values here obtained for both samples were slightly smaller than @xmath114 obtained before for ndnio@xmath13 @xcite , but with the same sign and the same order of magnitude .",
    "the most striking feature displayed by this series is the occurrence of a metal - insulator ( mi ) transition in a wide range of temperature .",
    "such a transition is easily seen in the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity , @xmath6 , for the samples of nd@xmath0eu@xmath1nio@xmath13 ( @xmath3 ) , as shown in figure 7 .",
    "the overall behavior of the @xmath6 data is essentially the same for all samples and they exhibit four important features : ( 1 ) a continuous increase in the mi transition temperature with increasing eu content ; ( 2 ) a metallic - like behavior above @xmath14 , with a linear temperature dependence of @xmath6 ; ( 3 ) a fairly rapid increase of @xmath6 at @xmath74 , related to the temperature - driven mi transition ; and ( 4 ) a clear thermal hysteresis occurring in a temperature interval @xmath115 close to @xmath14 , which decreases appreciably as @xmath14 increases",

    "the inset displays the @xmath115 against @xmath54 curve.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the temperature in which the mi transition occurs is rather sensitive to eu concentration , as can be inferred from the data of figure 7 .",
    "the @xmath6 data reveal that @xmath14 increases continuously with increasing eu concentration , ranging from @xmath4@xmath29 k in ndnio@xmath13 to 336 k in nd@xmath116eu@xmath116nio@xmath13 sample .",
    "the computed @xmath14 values are displayed in table 3 .",
    "the ndnio@xmath13 sample was found to exhibit @xmath117 k , a value in excellent agreement with others listed in literature @xcite .",
    "increasing eu content resulted in a systematic increase of @xmath14 , a behavior consistent with intermediary values of @xmath14 ranging between @xmath118 k for ndnio@xmath13 and @xmath119 k for eunio@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6 data in the metallic regime , @xmath120 , was described as @xmath121 for all samples studied .",
    "such a behavior of @xmath6 is typical of electron - phonon scattering where @xmath122 is the residual electrical resistivity and @xmath123 is related to the electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath124 . assuming that the linear dependence of the electrical resistivity is due entirely to electron - phonon scattering , then @xmath124 can be obtained by using @xcite    @xmath125    considering the plasmon energy @xmath126 ev , the same value obtained for lanio@xmath13 @xcite , then @xmath124 can be estimated for all samples .",
    "it is also possible to estimate the mean free path @xmath127 by doing    @xmath128    where @xmath129 ( fermi velocity ) was assumed to be of the same magnitude of similar oxides ( @xmath130x@xmath131 cm / s for la@xmath132sr@xmath133cuo@xmath134 ) @xcite .    from fits of @xmath6 data",

    "et al _ @xcite ( 25 - 28 mev ) in the same compound with @xmath51 , although their results showed a smooth curvature in the lg@xmath50 against @xmath144 curves , indicating that a simple activated behavior is only a rough approximation of the insulating phase",
    ". there are indications that the activation energy is also strongly dependent on the preparation process , since a small oxygen nonstoichiometry affects deeply the behavior of the insulating phase @xcite .",
    "examining further the @xmath6 curves in figure 7 , one can note that the thermal hysteresis @xmath115 is noticeable only in samples with @xmath145 .",
    "in fact , it occurs in a temperature interval @xmath115 as large as 58 k in ndnio@xmath13 and is much less pronounced , or nearly absent , for the compound nd@xmath146eu@xmath147nio@xmath13 where @xmath148 2 k ( see inset of figure 7 ) .",
    "the hysteretic behavior observed here , at least for the parent compound , is certainly related to the first - order character of the mi transition and reflects the temperature interval @xmath115 in which both phases metallic ( disordered ) and insulating ( ordered ) coexist @xcite .",
    "the @xmath115 against @xmath54 plot shown in the inset of figure 7 also indicates that the width @xmath149 of this thermal hysteresis approaches zero for eu content @xmath150 .",
    "this strongly suggest that the partial substitution of nd by eu modifies the character of this transition from first to second order in samples with eu content higher than @xmath40.25 .",
    "similar behavior has been observed in nd@xmath116sm@xmath116nio@xmath13 which exhibited absence of thermal hysteresis in @xmath6 measurements , and the mi transition was characterized as a second order phase transition @xcite .",
    "this proposition has to be further explored since a decrease in @xmath149 is also expected as @xmath14 increases .",
    "it should be mentioned that nikulin _",
    "et al _ @xcite could not observe any noticeable thermal hysteresis in electrical resistivity measurements performed in smnio@xmath13 .",
    "this behavior was explained as a result of the kinetics of the m - i phase transition , since the phase transition for smnio@xmath13 occurs at temperatures much higher than that for ndnio@xmath13 .",
    "the kinetics of the phase transformation is believed to be much slower for the compound with nd than that for the compound with sm , resulting in a noticeable thermal hysteresis only for the ndnio@xmath13 compound .",
    "figure 8 shows the temperature dependence of the logarithmic derivative of the electrical resistivity curves , @xmath151 against @xmath46 taken upon heating .",
    "the peaks provide a better means of defining the value of @xmath14 , as opposed to the simple inspection of the @xmath6 curves @xcite . the mi transition is sharper for the parent compound , a feature that manifests itself in the width of the peak in @xmath152 .",
    "temperature dependence of the @xmath45 , obtained during heating process.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the broadening and the decrease of the peak intensity in @xmath45 with increasing eu content suggest a continuous transition from the metallic to the insulating state .",
    "in addition , the trend shown in figure 8 indicates that increasing substitution of nd by eu in ndnio@xmath13 moves the transition away from a well defined value of @xmath14 .",
    "this behavior is certainly related to the increase of disorder which is also responsible for the observed increase in the value of @xmath138 with increasing eu content ( see table 3 ) .",
    "such a partial substitution is analogous to an increase of the quenched bond randomness observed in systems as lamno@xmath2 @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the coexistence between the ordered and disordered phases at the phase transition disappears at a finite threshold amount of eu .",
    "in fact , neutron diffraction data have also suggested an increase of the crystalline disorder in the nd@xmath15eu@xmath16nio@xmath13 sample , as inferred from the temperature interval in which the mi transition occurs ( see figures 5 and 6 ) .",
    "magnetization measurements @xmath7 were performed in all samples of nd@xmath0eu@xmath1nio@xmath13 under magnetic fields @xmath153 up to 10 koe .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility @xmath31 was obtained by doing @xmath154 , where @xmath155 is the molecular mass and @xmath156 is the mass of the sample .    in order to understand better the magnetic behavior of these systems , specifically the behavior of the ni sublattice which orders antiferromagnetically ,",
    "the magnetic contribution of the rare earth ions to the susceptibility @xmath31 was subtracted from the original data .",
    "this subtraction was performed through measurements of magnetization in samples with similar crystal structure but without evidence for magnetic ordering of the metal . in this case ,",
    "samples of ndalo@xmath13 and eualo@xmath13 were prepared , where the ni ion has been fully replaced by al .",
    "once the corresponding @xmath31 curves for the al substituted samples were obtained , they were fitted to a curie - weiss law in the high temperature region ( @xmath157 k ) .",
    "hence , it was possible to obtain the magnetic susceptibility for each ion separately ( nd@xmath21 and eu@xmath21 ) .",
    "finally , the contribution of the ni ions ( ni@xmath21 ) to the total observed susceptibility @xmath31 could be written as    @xmath158    figure 9 displays a typical set of @xmath31 curves after performing the subtraction discussed above .",
    "the data belonging to the samples with @xmath51 , 0.10 , and 0.15 display a clear peak near @xmath4@xmath69 k , corresponding to the antiferromagnetic ordering of the ni@xmath21 sublattice . for samples with @xmath51 and @xmath159 , @xmath160 k and for @xmath161 , @xmath162 k.",
    "the curves of @xmath31 for the samples where @xmath25 is well defined ( @xmath51 , @xmath159 and @xmath161 ) were fit by the form @xmath163 , where @xmath164 is the curie constant , @xmath165 is the curie - weiss temperature and @xmath166 is a temperature - independent contribution to the susceptibility . by using the curie constant @xmath164 obtained in these fits ,",
    "the values obtained for @xmath167 were 1.75 , 1.73 , and 1.79 @xmath168 for the samples with @xmath51 , 0.10 , and 0.15 respectively .",
    "these values are in excellent agreement with @xmath169 expected for the free ni@xmath21 ion at @xmath170 .",
    "curves of @xmath31 for nd@xmath0eu@xmath1nio@xmath13 ( @xmath3 ) after the subtraction of the contribution of the rare earth ions .",
    "the inset shows the curves of @xmath171.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the expected peak of the magnetic order of the ni sublattice is hardly seen in curves belonging to samples with @xmath172 .",
    "this might be explained by the fact that increasing nd substitution by eu results in a stronger effect of the crystalline - electric field ( cef ) .",
    "therefore , higher values of @xmath31 are obtained , hiding the observation of the magnetic order of the ni sublattice . besides , the magnetic contribution of the cef of the eu@xmath21 is bigger than that of nd@xmath21 ions , which makes the separation of the ni sublattice contribution more difficult than the one performed above .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath173 increases monotonically when the temperature is decreased below @xmath25 .",
    "this indicates that the thermal behavior of the ni sublattice can not be understood within the framework of a conventional antiferromagnet .",
    "one possible explanation for this anomalous behavior would be the presence of a canted - spin ferromagnetism .",
    "in fact , a small irreversibility observed in our measurements in zfc and fc curves ( not shown ) would be an indication of weak ferromagnetism .",
    "however , the irreversibility was observed to be almost field independent , which seems to be inconsistent with the canted - spin picture .    on the other hand , the low temperature behavior of the magnetic susceptibility could be a result of two magnetic phases that coexist below @xmath25 : one antiferromagnetic phase , where the magnetic susceptibility decreases when the temperature decreases , and a paramagnetic phase , where the magnetic susceptibility increases further when the temperature decreases .",
    "this anomalous behavior in the magnetic susceptibility has been reported previously by zhou _",
    "et al _ @xcite in measurements performed in ndnio@xmath13 and nd@xmath116sm@xmath116nio@xmath13 and was attributed to a charge disproportionation in the ni sublattice , resulting into alternating diamagnetic and paramagnetic ni sites .",
    "this point needs to be better clarified , and experiments are under way to address that .",
    "in summary , we have produced high quality polycrystalline samples of nd@xmath0eu@xmath1nio@xmath13 ( @xmath3 ) . from xrd and npd results",
    "we have found single - phase samples that crystallize in the gdfeo@xmath13-type orthorhombically distorted perovskite structure ( space group @xmath8 ) .",
    "the thermal evolution of the structural parameters across the mi transition revealed small unit cell changes in temperatures close to the mi transition . within our experimental resolution",
    ", it was not possible to observe any kind of structural phase transition at @xmath14 through the analysis of the npd data .",
    "the mi transition temperatures from npd ( @xmath174 ) were in good agreement with those found through electrical resistivity ( @xmath14 ) measurements .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility data indicate , after subtracting the magnetic contribution of the rare earth ions , that @xmath173 increases below @xmath25 for all samples , suggesting a possible coexistence of two phases : a paramagnetic phase and an antiferromagnetic one .",
    "however , this point still needs to be better clarified .",
    "the substitution of nd by eu in the ndnio@xmath2 compound causes a broadening in the variation of the unit cell volume across the mi transition , which is also reflected in both the temperature dependence of the ni - o distance and the superexchange angle .",
    "it is also observed an increase of @xmath122 in the electrical resistivity curves , as the eu content increases , and that the transition becomes less defined .",
    "when the eu content is higher than @xmath40.25 , the thermal hysteresis observed in the electrical resistivity curves , between the heating and cooling process , is suppressed .",
    "these results indicate that crystalline disorder , induced by the progressive substitution of nd by eu , is changing the first - order character of the phase transition observed across the mi boundary .",
