    "the einstein field equations for a number of classes of cosmological models have been written as polynomial systems of ordinary differential equations . in recent investigations",
    "some authors look for new exact solutions of these differential systems due to their cosmological interest .",
    "most of these solutions araise either due to the existence of a symmetry , or under a restriction on the parameters of the cosmological model .",
    "homogeneous cosmological models have important applications in the theory of evolution of the universe .",
    "in particular they can be applied to the theory of explosions of stars , formation of galaxies , etc .",
    "the equations of general relativity are reduced to systems of a finite ( but quite large ) number of ordinary differential equations . in the last two decades",
    "these dynamical systems were and still are being analyzed by means of traditionals analytic and numerical methods . however the dynamical systems in question are so complex and the development of effective methods for their analysis becomes especially urgent .    in this paper we shall concentrate our attention to the diagonal @xmath0 cosmologies , i.e. those spacetimes which admit an abelian @xmath0 comprising two hypersurface - orthogonal killing vector fields ( see for instance  @xcite ) .",
    "in fact we only study spatially homogeneous diagonal @xmath0 cosmologies .",
    "it is assumed that the einstein field equations are satisfied and that spacetime admits a perfect fluid with linear equation of state @xmath2 where @xmath3 is an arbitrary parameter in the specified range of values which contains the physically significant values @xmath4 ( corresponding to dust ) and @xmath5 ( for which the fluid is interpreted as radiation ) . in all the paper we use geometrized units with @xmath6 and @xmath7 and the sign convention of maccallum  @xcite .    in section  2",
    "we describe the mathematical techniques used for the analysis of polynomial differential equations that we deal in this work .",
    "a summary is given about the darboux s theory in order to study ordinary differential equations in the complex projective plane @xmath1 and , in short , its utility for the analysis of the socalled _ degenerate infinity _ systems .",
    "this name is due to the fact that in the poincar compactification of these kind of differential systems all the equator of the sphere @xmath8 , i.e. the infinity of the affine plane , is filled up of critical points , see sotomayor  @xcite . in section  3 we show the equations that govern the spatially homogeneous diagonal @xmath0 cosmologies and the bianchi models . in section  4 we solve the bianchi  v models totally and , finally in the fifth and sixth sections we carry out a study of the bianchi vi cosmological models .",
    "first integrals are given in particular cases and a canonical form of the equations allows us to obtain the formal solution .",
    "in this section we consider the first order differential equation @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are polynomials which in the following we can suppose with coefficients in the complex field @xmath13 .",
    "we say that @xmath14 is the _ degree _ of polynomial differential equation ( [ bi21 ] ) .",
    "when we consider it necessary , we introduce a  time \" parameter  @xmath15 , which enables us to express ( [ bi21 ] ) as a first order autonomous system in the affine plane @xmath16    following darboux @xcite , we introduce the homogeneous coordinates @xmath17 of the complex projective plane @xmath1 such that @xmath18 which allow us to express differential equation ( [ bi21 ] ) in the form @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are homogeneous polynomials of degree  @xmath22 .",
    "note that @xmath23 is an invariant straight line of this equation .",
    "more generally ( see @xcite ) , we can consider a differential equation defined in @xmath1 as an equation of the form @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are homogeneous polynomials such that @xmath28 . introducing the auxiliary independent variable @xmath29 , we can also interpret equation  ( [ bi24 ] ) like a dynamical system @xmath30 over @xmath31 .",
    "such homogeneous system induces on @xmath1 the polynomial foliation given by  ( [ bi24 ] ) .",
    "in fact , differential equation  ( [ bi24 ] ) has not a unique expression .    * remark 1 . *",
    "if we take @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 instead of @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 respectively into equation ( [ bi24 ] ) , where @xmath38 is a homogeneous polynomial of degree @xmath39 , then differential equation ( [ bi24 ] ) remains invariant .",
    "* remark 2 .",
    "* one of the most obvious questions to ask is which is the relationship between the parameters @xmath15 and @xmath29 of the affine differential system ( [ bi21.1 ] ) and the projective differential system ( [ bi24.1 ] ) with @xmath40 .",
    "a straightforward differentiation shows that @xmath41 , \\qquad \\frac{d y}{d t } = z^{m-1 } \\left [ m(x , y,1)- y n(x , y,1 ) \\right].\\ ] ] on the other hand , by the chain s rule we have @xmath42 finally , identifying the last two previous expressions when @xmath40 we conclude that @xmath43    a polynomial differential equation ( [ bi21 ] ) , where @xmath44 and @xmath45 is the developement in homogeneous components of the polynomials @xmath11 and  @xmath12 is said to be _ degenerate infinity _ if it verifies the condition @xmath46 or equivalently @xmath47 and @xmath48 for some homogeneous polynomial @xmath49 of degree @xmath39 . in order to clarify this terminology , we write equation  ( [ bi21 ] ) in the complex projective plane as equation ( [ bi24 ] ) , where @xmath50 now , from remark 1 , we can take @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 obtaining @xmath51 and being @xmath52 from the above equation we conclude that the line of infinity @xmath23 is obviously an invariant straight line of ( [ bi25 ] ) and moreover this line is filled up in a dense sense of critical points since @xmath53 .    at this point",
    "we want to comment that it is more convenient , in order to obtain their critical points , write equation ( [ bi24 ] ) into the form @xmath54 being @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "we say that @xmath58 is a _",
    "critical point _ of equation ( [ bi26 ] ) if and only if @xmath59 .    finally , we recall that the complex projective plane @xmath1 is compact because it is obtained by adding a line at infinity to the plane @xmath60 . hence , when we extend the foliations from the affine plane to the projective plane and we study their integrability , this study is global in the above sense .",
    "homogeneous cosmological models are defined to be space - time manifolds thogether with a metric @xmath62 satisfying einstein s equations and invariant under some three - dimensional lie group of transformations of the manifold . in cosmology",
    "the most important models are spatially homogeneous models for which the orbits of the lie group are space - like ( restrictions of the metric @xmath62 to the orbits of the group are negative definite ) .",
    "let @xmath63 and @xmath64 be dimensionless shear components . in addition , the variables @xmath65 and @xmath66 are dimensionless measures of the isotropic and anisotropic curvature of the hypersurfaces which lie orthogonal to the fluid flow .",
    "it is easy to show ( see @xcite and @xcite for example ) that the einstein field equations for the spatially homogeneous diagonal @xmath0 cosmologies reduce to the following system of polynomial ordinary differential equations @xmath67 where the over dot denotes @xmath68 , i.e. , derivative with respect to a dimensionlees measure of time @xmath69 along the fluid flow lines ( see @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the deceleration parameter @xmath70 is given by @xmath71 and the density parameter adopts the form @xmath72    for this cosmological model it is known that the einstein field equations ( [ bi41 ] ) admit the particular solution @xmath73    the constraint equation ( [ bi44 ] ) allows the following possibilities ( each one of them gives rise to a bianchi model ) .    *",
    "if @xmath74 we have the model * b(i)*. * imposing @xmath75 the resultant model is * b(v)*. * from the last two equations of ( [ bi41 ] ) it is obvious that if @xmath76 , then system ( [ bi41 ] ) admits the first integral @xmath77 being @xmath78 a constant .",
    "therefore , constraint ( [ bi44 ] ) implies @xmath79 and the cosmological model is called * b(vi)*.    the bianchi i models * b(i ) * are expressed by the following system @xmath80 where @xmath70 is given by ( [ bi42 ] ) and @xmath81 .",
    "these models are easily integrated to yield either @xmath82 , where @xmath78 is an arbitrary constant or @xmath83 .",
    "therefore , in the phase portrait we only have singular points and straight lines .    in @xcite",
    "the author carries out a qualitative study of all these bianchi type models . on the other hand ,",
    "@xcite examine the different bianchi types and determine all of the linear and quadratic algebraic invariant curves which lie in the physical region of phase space .",
    "the bianchi v models * b(v ) * are given by the following cubic polynomial systems @xmath84 where the deceleration @xmath70 and the density @xmath85 are @xmath86    these models have been studied by many authors . in particular , it has been pointed out ( see @xcite and @xcite ) that the einstein field equations reduce to elliptic integrals for certain values of @xmath3 . moreover , in @xcite the following time invariant for @xmath87 is given @xmath88 where @xmath89 is an integration constant .    performing the change of variables @xmath90 ,",
    "@xmath91 we can reduce the degree of system ( [ bi51 ] ) obtaining the following quadratic system with degenerate infinity @xmath92 where @xmath93 . applying the arguments of second section , we write system ( [ b2 ] ) in the complex projective plane as @xmath94 where ,",
    "making the rescaling of time @xmath95 ( see remark 2 ) , we have @xmath96    from the first two equations @xmath97 and @xmath98 we obtain for equation ( [ b2.1 ] ) the following first integral @xmath99 which is a fourth degree homogeneous function . moreover , as @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath100 are linear homogeneous polynomials which only depend on the variables @xmath101 and @xmath102 , there exist constants  @xmath103 ,  @xmath104 and @xmath105 not all zero such that @xmath106 .",
    "hence , we have for equation  ( [ b2.1 ] ) the first integral @xmath107 . in short",
    "we have for instance the linear first integral @xmath108 .",
    "now , we consider for equation ( [ b2.1 ] ) the zero degree homogeneous first integral defined like @xmath109 .",
    "making the transformation @xmath110 in the above first integral we turn to the affine plane obtaining the first integral for system ( [ b2 ] ) @xmath111 finally , undoing the change of variables @xmath90 , @xmath91 we have for bianchi  v models  ( [ bi51 ] ) the following darboux first integral @xmath112    moreover , from the equations of @xmath97 and @xmath98 we obtain the time parametrization @xmath113 where @xmath114 and @xmath115 are real parameters .",
