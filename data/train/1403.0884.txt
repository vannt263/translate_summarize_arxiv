    "however , the thermal response of the accelerated detectors is only local . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , a spatially separated pair of particle detectors with the same proper acceleration @xmath1 has non - thermal temporal correlations of the detection events .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we established the importance of a distinction between probes and particle detectors , in any discussion of the response of the quantum vacuum to accelerated motion .",
    "in particular , probes are microscopic systems that interact with the quantum field through their accelerating motion .",
    "after the interaction has been completed , information can be extracted from a probe through a single measurement .",
    "the mathematical description of probes is very similar to that of particle scattering .",
    "in contrast , particle detectors are characterized by the macroscopic records of detection events .",
    "these macroscopic records are present _ throughout the detectors history _ , so that a detection rate that corresponds to directly measurable quantities can be defined .",
    "such a description of a particle detector is compatible with the standard use of the term in physics .",
    "our approach is distinguished from most existing studies of the issue which employ the word `` detector '' for systems that are best described as probes .",
    "the difference between probes and detectors is further analyzed in sec .",
    "2 : it leads to a different mathematical description and to different expressions for the particle detection rate .    in this article",
    ", we undertake a description of particle detectors moving along general spacetime trajectories , by incorporating explicitly the creation of macroscopic records into physical description .",
    "the key result is a _ real - time _ description of particle detection and the rigorous construction of the associated probabilities .    to this end",
    ", we employ a general method for the construction of quantum temporal probabilities ( qtp ) for any experimental configuration , that was developed in ref .",
    "the key idea is to distinguish between the roles of time as a parameter to schrdinger s equation and as a label of the causal ordering of events @xcite .",
    "this important distinction leads to the definition of quantum temporal observables .",
    "in particular , we identify the time of a detection event as a coarse - grained quasi - classical variable associated with macroscopic records of observation .",
    "besides the construction of particle detectors , the qtp method has been applied to the time - of - arrival problem @xcite , to the temporal characterization of tunneling processes @xcite and to non - exponential decays @xcite .    in sec .",
    "3 , we present a detailed construction of the detection probability for moving particle detectors using the qtp method .",
    "this generalizes the results of ref .",
    "@xcite derived for the case of constant proper acceleration .",
    "the detection probability is sensitive to a time - scale @xmath0 that characterizes the detector s degree of coarse-graining.that is , @xmath0 corresponds to the minimal temporal localization in time of a detection event .",
    "the time - scale @xmath0 is a physical parameter that is determined by a detailed knowledge of the detector s physics .",
    "the most important feature of the derived probability density is that it is local in time for scales of observation much larger than @xmath0 .",
    "this property significantly simplifies the calculation of the detection probability for a large class of spacetime paths .",
    "such calculations are presented in sec .",
    "4 . the most important results are ( i ) the derivation of the adiabatic approximation and of its corrections and ( ii ) the demonstration that the detection probability of fast periodic motions is constant .    finally , in sec .",
    "5 we summarize our results , discussing in particular their relevance to proposed experiments .",
    "in order to explain the difference between a probe and a detector , we consider the most common model employed in this context , the unruh - dewitt detector @xcite .",
    "this is a quantum system that moves along a trajectory @xmath3 in minkowski spacetime and that is characterized by a hamiltonian @xmath4 .",
    "the unruh - dewitt detector is coupled to a massless , free quantum scalar field @xmath5 through an interaction hamiltonian @xmath6 $ ] , where @xmath7 is an operator analogue of the dipole moment .",
    "assuming that the detector is initially at the lowest energy state @xmath8 and the field is at the vacuum state @xmath9 , the probability @xmath10 that a measurement of the detector will find energy @xmath11 _ at proper time @xmath12 _ is @xmath13 , \\label{refbad}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the projector onto the eigenstates of the detector with energy equal to @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the time - ordered product .",

    "( [ refbad2 ] ) one assumes that the detector - field interaction is switched on only for a finite time interval of duration @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the time derivative of @xmath10 is often identified with the transition probability @xmath22 , i.e. with a probability density function ( pdf ) such that @xmath23 equals with the probability that a transition to energy @xmath15 occurred at some time within the interval @xmath24 $ ] .",

    "( [ petbad ] ) can be made fully causal @xcite , i.e. , variables at time @xmath12 depend only on the trajectory at times prior to @xmath12 .",
    "however , eq . ( [ petbad ] )",
    "is highly non - local in time ; one needs to know the full past history of the detector in order to identify the transition probability at the present moment of time .",
    "there are two problems with the line of reasoning that leads to the consideration of eq .",
    "( [ petbad ] ) as a pdf for the detection rate .",
    "first , the above definition of a pdf is not probabilistically sound , because the derivative of @xmath10 with respect to @xmath12 does not , in general , define a probability measure .",
    "the time @xmath12 in @xmath26 is not a random variable ( unlike @xmath15 ) , but a _ parameter _ of the probability distribution .",
    "thus , the time derivative of @xmath26 does not define a pdf ; in general , it takes negative values . the fact that @xmath22 in eq .",
    "( [ petbad ] ) is positive - valued is an artifact of first - order perturbation theory .",
    "second order effects include the relaxation of the detector through particle emission , which render @xmath10 a decreasing function of @xmath12 at later times @xcite .",
    "thus , negative values of @xmath22 appear .",
    "second , eq .",
    "( [ refbad ] ) applies to experimental configurations at which information is extracted from the unruh - dewitt detector only once , at time @xmath12 .",
    "hence , eq . ( [ petbad ] )",
    "does not describe a system that actually _ records _ particles at times prior to @xmath12 ; it purports to define a detection rate for fictitious detection events .",
    "in fact , the physical system described by eq .",
    "( [ refbad ] ) can not be described as a detector , in any reasonable use of the word in physics .",
    "we usually think of a particle detector ( e.g. a photodetector ) as a physical system that outputs a time - series of detection events , each event being well localized in time .",
    "the quantum mechanical description of the detector ought to take into account the _ irreversible _ process of outputting information , namely , the creation of macroscopic records of observation .    however , the system described by eq .",
    "( [ refbad ] ) outputs information only once , at time @xmath12 , and its time evolution prior to @xmath12 is fully unitary . such a system is best described as a field _ probe _",
    ", in the sense of bohr and rosenfeld @xcite : a probe is a microscopic system that interacts with the quantum field ; information about the field in incorporated in the probe s final state and we extract this information through a single measurement .",
    "for such a system , eq . ( [ refbad ] ) provides a good approximation for times much earlier than the system s relaxation time @xmath27 .",
    "another key difference between detectors and probes is that in the former it is possible to determine _ temporal _ correlation functions for particle detection , by considering several detectors along different spacetime trajectories @xcite .",
    "measurements of such correlations ( for static detectors ) are well established in quantum optics @xcite .",
    "next , we proceed to the construction of models for particle detectors characterized by macroscopic records of observation .",
    "in this section , we derive the detection rate of an unruh - dewitt detector moving along a general trajectory in minkowski spacetime .",
    "first , we briefly review the qtp method for defining pdfs with respect to detection time .",
    "then , we construct explicitly a model for a macroscopic unruh - dewitt detector .",
    "we follow the general methodology for constructing detection probabilities with respect to time , that was developed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( the quantum temporal probabilities method ) .",
    "the reader is referred to this article for a detailed presentation .",

    "@xcite is the derivation of a general formula for probabilities associated with the time of an event in a general quantum system . here",
    ", the word `` event '' refers to a definite and persistent macroscopic record of observation .",
    "the event time @xmath28 is a coarse - grained , quasi - classical parameter associated with such records : it corresponds to the reading of an external classical clock that is simultaneous with the emergence of the record .",
    "let @xmath29 be the hilbert space associated with the physical system under consideration ; @xmath29 describes the degrees of freedom of microscopic particles and of a macroscopic measurement apparatus .",
    "we assume that @xmath29 splits into two subspaces : @xmath30 .",
    "the subspace @xmath31 describes the accessible states of the system given that a specific event is realized ; the subspace @xmath32 is the complement of @xmath31 .",
    "for example , if the quantum event under consideration is a detection of a particle by a macroscopic apparatus , the subspace @xmath31 corresponds to all accessible states of the apparatus given that a detection event has been recorded .",
    "we denote the projection operator onto @xmath31 as @xmath33 and the projector onto @xmath32 as @xmath34 .",
    "we note that the transitions under consideration are always correlated with the emergence of a macroscopic observable that is recorded as a measurement outcome . in this sense ,",
    "the transitions considered here are _",
    "irreversible_. once they occur , and a measurement outcome has been recorded , the further time evolution of the degrees of freedom in the measurement device is irrelevant to the probability of transition .",
    "once a transition has taken place , the values of a microscopic variable are determined through correlations with a pointer variable of the measurement apparatus .",
    "we denote by @xmath35 projection operators ( or , more generally , positive operators ) that correspond to different values @xmath36 of some physical magnitude .",
    "this physical magnitude can be measured only if the quantum event under consideration has occurred .",

    "such experiments are mostly concerned with microscopic systems rather than macroscopic detectors , as described here .    in order to identify what kind of physical system could play the role of a macroscopic detector that effectively records particle creation",

    "the ideal detector should have the minimum number of particles consistent with the formation of stable records of detection , and it should be prepared at temperatures close to zero .",

    "does not apply .",
    "however , a theoretical model that involves only the coupling of the probe to the field misses the fact that the records of observation corresponds to photon emitted by the probe after it has been excited .",
    "the non - equilibrium dynamics of an accelerating probe coupled to the field is , in general , non - markovian @xcite , so there is no obvious relation between the state of the probe and the recorded detection rate .",
    "furthermore , as shown here , the temporal coarse - graining inherent in the detection process may destroy the particle detection signal .",
    "for the reasons above , we believe that a complete theoretical analysis of such experiments requires not only the study of the non - equilibrium dynamics of the probe coupled to the field @xcite , but also a precise modeling of the detection process along the lines presented here .",
