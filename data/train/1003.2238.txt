    "topological insulators embody a new class of topological states which have attracted great attention recently@xcite .",
    "the key for this flourishing development is the understanding that spin orbit interactions can realize topological insulating phases@xcite .",
    "the theoretical prediction of such phases in real materials@xcite as well as their experimental observations@xcite are responsible for the success of this rapidly developing field .    a topological insulator exhibits a bulk energy gap ( like ordinary insulators ) while the edge ( or surface in three dimensions ) has gapless states which are protected by time reversal symmetry .",
    "the topological difference between a topological insulator and an ordinary band insulator is characterized by a @xmath0 invariant@xcite which is non - zero in the topological phase .",
    "the existence of this topological quantum number as well as the quantized spin hall conductivity inspired the field@xcite , in particular , it was shown that the topological insulator phase  or in two dimensions also called _ quantum spin hall _ ( qsh ) effect  is stable against weak disorder and weak interactions@xcite .",
    "inside a topological insualtor , maxwell s laws of electromagnetism are altered by an additional topological term with a quantized coefficient , which gives rise to interesting physical effects@xcite .",
    "a major role has been played by a simple model introduced by kane and mele@xcite consisting of a hopping and an intrinsic spin orbit term on the honeycomb lattice .",
    "mele model ( without the rashba term ) essentially consists of two copies with different sign for up and down spins of a model introduced earlier by haldane@xcite .",
    "haldane s pioneering work realizes the quantum hall effect without an external uniform magnetic field .",
    "it breaks , however , time reversal symmetry ( necessary for the quantum hall effect ) which can be restored by taking two copies with different signs for the spins together ( as kane and mele did ) .",
    "originally they proposed the model as realization of the qsh effect in graphene@xcite and today it should be seen as a paradigm , a perfect theoretical model for topological insulator phases in two dimensions .",
    "the honeycomb lattice is definitely interesting on its own due to the striking development within the graphene community@xcite but also more exotic phenomena like zero modes@xcite have been discovered , for example .",
    "the honeycomb lattice has also attracted some attention in relation with exotic phases of light and the jaynes ",
    "cummings lattice model@xcite .",
    "the additional spin orbit interactions now make the difference and are responsible for the existence of a topological insulator phase@xcite .",
    "consequently , real materials with ( strong ) spin orbit interactions have been attracted particular notice@xcite .",
    "it was also shown that strong nearest- and next - nearest neighbor repulsions can imitate the intrinsic spin orbit interactions such that qsh phases are stabilized in the absence of spin orbit coupling@xcite . beside mercury telluride quantum wells and the kane ",
    "mele model , topological insulating phases in two dimensions are found to exist in the kagome lattice@xcite and the decorated honeycomb lattice@xcite provided the presence of spin orbit interactions .",
    "other aspects of topological insulators are disorder induced topological phases as predicted for the hgte quantum wells@xcite and for three  dimensional systems@xcite and the proposed existence of axions on the surface of bismuth - tin alloys@xcite .",
    "axions were postulated more than 30 years ago in the context of the standard model@xcite and their effective action has now been recovered in topological insulators raising hope to detect this dynamical axion field experimentally . moreover ,",
    "a qsh phase in ferromagnetic graphene was predicted@xcite which is protected by the product of charge - conjugation and time reversal symmetry .",
    "most recently , a new family of topological insulators has been discovered@xcite in ternary heusler compounds .",
    "their additional open @xmath1-shell element might be the key for the realization of exotic topological effects .",
    "another promising path for the realization of topological phases and , in particular , qsh phases consists of cold atomic gases loaded into optical lattices@xcite which are subjected by a synthetic magnetic field .",
    "such a field has a similar effect on the neutral atoms as a magnetic field coupled to electrons and has been demonstrated experimentally@xcite . a possible experiment to realize a topological insulator",
    "was proposed recently@xcite . in this spirit , a realization of a topological band insulator seems to be feasible in the near future with possibly two major advantages : ( i ) tuning of the topological insulator band gap or of the details of the engineered hamiltonian and ( ii ) availability of onsite - interactions ( hubbard model ) with tunable interaction strength .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the hubbard model with intrinsic spin orbit interactions on the honeycomb lattice which corresponds to the kane ",
    "mele ( km ) model with interactions .",
    "some aspects of the interacting km model was studied in refs .. a general theory of interaction effects in topological insulators has been proposed introducing a topological order parameter in terms of the full green s function@xcite .",
    "we consider the half  filled case at zero temperature . while the ( non - interacting ) km model",
    "is known to realize a topological band insulator ( tbi ) phase , it is also expected that for sufficiently strong electron ",
    "electron interactions magnetic order will take place .",
    "therefore we want to clarify what happens and which phases are present when adding interactions  ranging from very weak to very strong .",
    "we focus on the dominant phases at finite spin orbit coupling .",
    "for very weak or no spin orbit coupling additional ( spin liquid ) phases might exist but are beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "first , we show that interestingly the tbi phase subsists up to quite strong interactions .",
    "then , applying the slave rotor mean - field procedure , we investigate the limit of stronger interactions where the charge degrees of freedom form a mott insulator whereas the spin degrees of freedom are described by a renormalized km model . in a mott phase , adding a particle at a given site costs the hubbard onsite energy @xmath2 ( in contrast , excitations carry a well - defined momentum in the tbi phase ) . at the mean - field level",
    ", this phase has all the properties of a spin liquid ( which preserves time - reversal symmetry ) with gapless spinon excitations at the edges and is characterized by a hidden order parameter in the spin sector similar to that in the original km model@xcite . on the other hand",
    ", one should not underestimate the effect of dynamical compact u(1 ) gauge fields , especially in two dimensions@xcite .",
    "+     +    in particular , one predicts@xcite that such a spin liquid phase ( with gapless edge spinons ) found at the mean - field level can only be stable beyond the mean - field limit if other gapless layers ( spinons ) are present to screen the gauge field and suppress the gauge fluctuations .",
    "potential candidates can be found in refs .. furthermore , mott physics will suppress the single - particle tunneling at the edges @xcite such that the lowest relevant coupling between layers is the usual spin - spin interaction which may remain irrelevant @xcite , then preserving the gapless edge spinons .",
    "phases exhibiting similar spin - charge separation were also reported in other systems@xcite and for topological insulators in the presence of a @xmath3 flux@xcite .",
    "in contrast , if the honeycomb layer is isolated then the proliferation of instantons will fatally result in a neel ordering in the xy plane@xcite .",
    "the two distinct scenarios at the mott transition are reported in fig.[fig : phasedia - sr ] and [ fig : phasedia - sr1 ] . following ref .",
    ", fractionalized ti refers to the spin liquid type mott phase with gapless spinons which preserves time - reversal symmetry and sdw in the two figures always refers to the occurrence of a spin density wave formed in the xy plane .",
    "for very large interactions , applying a conventional hartree  fock procedure and deriving an effective spin hamiltonian , we show that sdw phases with xy ordering are allowed on the honeycomb lattice when adding the spin - orbit term coupling next nearest neighbors .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sec : model ] we introduce the km model , re - derive some of its basic properties , and introduce the ( hubbard ) interaction we consider throughout the paper . in sec.[sec : hf ] we apply the hartree fock method in order to show that a conventional sdw phase with ordering in the xy plane appears at large @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , we derive an effective spin model .",
    "then , in sec.[sec : bhf ] , we use a mean field approach in momentum space as well as the slave rotor picture to argue that the tbi phase as present in the original km model is stable beyond renormalization group results@xcite up to moderate interactions .",
    "then , we apply the slave rotor theory of florens and georges@xcite and discuss the intermediate region and the gauge field effects more thoroughly .",
