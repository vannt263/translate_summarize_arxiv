    "recently , the examination and modeling of vehicular traffic has become an important subject of research  see @xcite-@xcite and references therein for a brief review . in the microscopic approach to the traffic flow problem ,",
    "the cellular automaton introduced in @xcite reproduces important entities of real traffic , like the flow - density relation or stop - and - go waves . beside the realization of some basic requirements to such a model",
    "it can be efficiently used in computational investigations and applications @xcite-@xcite .",
    "fundamental analytical and numerical examinations enclose exact solutions for certain limits and mean - field approximations @xcite , the jamming transition @xcite-@xcite or the effects of perturbations and the occurrence of meta - stable states @xcite-@xcite , e.g. we investigate the density waves and the separation in free - flow and dense regions by means of the density - autocorrelation function .",
    "it enables us to trace back the spatio - temporal evolution of jams which are stable during the measurement time , on condition that jams emerge .",
    "it should be noted that the probability for a jam to survive decreases with the simulation time @xcite in a system without a clear phase separation between congestion and free - flow .",
    "but the duration of a simulation is sufficiently shorter than these time periods . by this method",
    "it is superfluous to give an explicit definition of what a jam is and which cars are belonging to the jam .",
    "therefore this method can be theoretically used for every traffic flow model where density profiles are available . as an example we apply this method to cellular automaton models . in this context",
    "we will report and discuss several aspects of the underlying model and their slow - to - start modifications ( section  [ sec : model ] ) : the jamming transition shows up by varying both the global density @xmath0 and the global noise @xmath1 ; the jam velocity can be derived directly from the density - autocorrelation function and is closely related to the global flow - density relation ( section  [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "it is not the goal of the paper to discuss the jamming transition with regard to the criticality or the sharpness of this issue , but we apply the method of correlation function from a more practical point of view .",
    "within the framework of this paper we only consider a one - dimensional ring of cells . the cells are either vacant or occupied by a vehicle labeled @xmath2 .",
    "its position is @xmath3 and its discrete velocity is @xmath4 $ ] .",
    "the gap @xmath5 denotes the number of empty sites to its leading vehicle .",
    "the rules for a parallel update are    * acceleration with regard to the vehicle ahead : @xmath6 , * noise : with a probability @xmath1 do @xmath7 , * movement : @xmath8 .",
    "the investigated systems consist of @xmath9 cells and @xmath10 vehicles , the global density is @xmath11 .",
    "the flow is defined as @xmath12 with the mean velocity @xmath13 . in the following the nagel - schreckenberg cellular automaton model @xcite defined through the above set of rules",
    "is denoted by sca .",
    "we extend our studies on further modifications of the sca , namely on models with slow - to - start rules .",
    "for the model with velocity - depending randomization ( vdr ) @xcite we set @xmath14 ) .",
    "that leads to a reduced outflow from a jam .",
    "note that @xmath15 is the velocity before the first update step is performed .",
    "the other modified model under consideration is the t@xmath16-model introduced by takayasu and takayasu @xcite . here",
    "the headway @xmath5 of a vehicle @xmath2 controls the acceleration : standing vehicles with a headway @xmath17 only speed up with a probability @xmath18 with @xmath19 ) , whereas for all other ones the rules are unchanged . unlike the sca with similar parameters , both models exhibit a different behavior in the vicinity of the point of maximum flow ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "they are capable to generate metastable states in the adiabatic approach ( for details see @xcite ) , i.e.  one finds two branches of @xmath21 in a small density interval .",
    "additionally , for sufficient small @xmath1 one can found a clear separation of of dense and free - flow regions in a space - time plot .",
    "we summarize the effective deceleration probabilities of the applied models : @xmath22 actually , other definitions of @xmath23 are conceivable , but , for our purpose , we decided to use only the above notations .",
    "primarily , it was done for modeling moving vehicles with similar properties and to scan the parameter space by varying only @xmath1 .",
    "both @xmath24 and @xmath25 are of any value but fix .",
    "the density waves are moving upstream and can be easily observed in a space - time plot @xcite , one finds separation of dense and free - flow regions . for the measurements it is necessary to introduce the mean local density @xmath26 of the cell @xmath27 at time @xmath28 : @xmath29 with @xmath30 the parameter @xmath31 denotes the length of the interval on which the local density has to be computed .",
    "it should satisfy the condition @xmath32 @xcite with a characteristic length scale @xmath33 . for the determination of the jam velocity @xmath34 we use the generalized @xmath35-point - autocorrelation function of the density @xmath36 with the supposed jam velocity @xmath37 $ ] . by varying @xmath38",
    "one finds a largest @xmath39 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : autocorr ] ) .",
    "@xmath40 is the time interval between two single measurements which contributes to ( [ eq : corrfunct ] ) .",
    "sufficiently large values of @xmath40 are necessary to observe a macroscopic motion and to determine @xmath34 with an adequate accuracy . unless otherwise mentioned , we set @xmath41 and @xmath42 in order to exclude any finite size effects .",
    "usually , we are averaging over @xmath43 simulation runs with @xmath44 and @xmath45 .    as pointed out in fig .",
    "[ fig : autocorr ] one has to adjust thoroughly the parameters @xmath35 and @xmath40 . if @xmath35 is of the order of magnitude of @xmath40 then the uncertainty of the measurement covers the interesting signal and @xmath46 vanishes .",
    "this problem becomes more serious while approaching @xmath47 . in this region",
    "the calculations are complicated additionally due to large fluctuations of @xmath46 itself .",
    "the jam velocity @xmath34 depends on the deceleration probability @xmath1 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vj_model ] ) and is related to global quantities as it will be shown later .",
    "we checked this for a variety of parameters , but could not notice any remarkable deviations among the diverse sets of data .",
    "the modifications of the sca , vdr and t@xmath16 , yield a different behavior .",
    "the absolute values of the jam velocity in the models vdr and t@xmath16 are smaller than that of the sca implying that both modifications are characterized by a lowered outflow from a jam that , in turn , reduces the jam velocity .    the results of simulations using the vdr are basically shifted towards smaller @xmath48 s .",
    "@xmath24 can be recognized on the ordinate at @xmath49 and on the abscissa at @xmath50 , for large @xmath1 s a total deadlock occurs , i.e.  it is highly unlikely or even impossible that a stopped car speeds up again . in order to find out how @xmath34 is related to @xmath23 we investigate the mean waiting time @xmath51 for @xmath52 expressed through an infinite series : @xmath53    \\label{eq : vj_vdr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and is exact for @xmath49 . for large values of",
    "@xmath24 one obtains a good agreement , whereas for small @xmath24 the jam velocity is overestimated .",
    "this is due to the so - called sub - jams which emerge downstream a wider jams and cause a reduction of @xmath48 .",
    "the results drawn from simulations using the t@xmath16 model show no deadlock situation for any @xmath54 . starting with @xmath55",
    ", one can hardly distinguish between the simulation results of sca and t@xmath16 . especially , this is valid as long as @xmath56 . similar to ( [ eq : vj_vdr ] )",
    "one can estimate @xmath57 note that for small @xmath25-values @xmath34 is overestimated for all values of @xmath1 , which , in turn , can be traced back to the occurrence of sub - jams . with increasing @xmath25 even for small @xmath1 it is required to set @xmath58 .",
    "again , it is @xmath59 and two special cases can be described by @xmath60    obviously , the measurements reveals several density regimes . below @xmath47",
    "the vehicles move independently , i.e.  there are no correlations between them . for @xmath61 upstream moving density waves can be detected by means of ( [ eq : corrfunct ] ) . in the vicinity of @xmath47",
    "the jam velocity reveals large fluctuations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vj_rho ] ) , which are due to the recurrent emergence and dissipation of jams .",
    "but beyond @xmath47 @xmath34 is nearly constant . within the interval where density waves are to be expected",
    "it is obvious that @xmath34 is independent of @xmath0 , since the outflow from a jam is independent from the global density .",
    "so far , we applied the autocorrelation function ( [ eq : corrfunct ] ) to determine the jam velocity .",
    "but this quantity itself indicates the two different phases separated by noise @xmath62 or density @xmath47 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : corr_p ] and [ fig : corr_rho ] ) .",
    "varying @xmath1 leads to a transition while crossing @xmath62 .",
    "its clarity strongly depends on @xmath63 , for insufficient ratios a plateau at @xmath64 occurs . to elucidate it we used a modified autocorrelation",
    "@xmath65    the other transition takes place while crossing the density @xmath47 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : corr_rho ] ) . for @xmath66",
    "one finds empty regions on the road of the order of magnitude of @xmath31 , and therefore @xmath46 completely vanishes . on the other hand , for @xmath67 stable congestion emerge .",
    "the same jam can be detected at @xmath68 as well as at @xmath69 located at @xmath70 . in this context",
    ", @xmath47 can be denoted as the density , at which stable jams emerge and separates the density regime as it is to be seen in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : corr_rho ] . for a fixed density and a varying @xmath71 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : corr_vmax ] ) the relationship can be estimated as @xmath72 .",
    "nevertheless , the quality of these data does not allow a correct classification of the transition between the free - flow and the dense region .",
    "above all , the sensitive dependencies on the many adjustable parameters of this method seem to prevent a more accurate consideration of the interesting interval of density .",
    "how is the jam velocity related to other macroscopic quantities ? in the steady state the dynamics are characterized by an equilibrium of out - flowing vehicles and vehicles attaching the jam from behind .",
    "the more frequent vehicles join the jam the faster the jam moves upstream .",
    "if we neglect any effects due to meta - stability then the free - flow region can be assumed to be located in the vicinity of the point of maximum flow ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "hence , the velocity of attaching vehicles is @xmath74 .",
    "the mean distance between the upstream tail of the jam and the next vehicle is @xmath75 and the temporal distance therefore reads @xmath76 this is confirmed by the simulation results depicted in fig .  [ fig : expl ] .",
    "it means that @xmath34 is determined by the slope of the congested branch ( @xmath77 ) in the fundamental diagram .",
    "this can also be verified for the modifications vdr and t@xmath16 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : expl_all ] ) .",
    "the small deviations from the data rest upon a difference between the outflow of the jam and the maximum global flow in the considered systems , but also in the above made assumption of the equilibrium . actually , the lowered outflow from jams observed in the models vdr and t@xmath16 in comparison to the sca is also reflected by ( [ eq : vj_expl ] ) .    concluding , this knowledge enables a calibration of the sca .",
    "besides the approach of the fundamental diagram derived from empirical data a further point of interest is the velocity of upstream moving jams ( @xmath78 on german highways @xcite )  but according to ( [ eq : vj_expl ] ) all information is accumulated in the fundamental diagram , namely in the second characteristic slope of @xmath21 . for the sca one can set @xmath44 and @xmath79 to adapt the simulation to this empirical jam velocity .",
    "we investigated the cellular automaton model for vehicular traffic in order to get information about the density waves and their velocity . beside the standard nagel - schreckenberg cellular automata we also included two slow - to - start modifications ( vdr and t@xmath16 ) .",
    "both resemble the sca except the rules for standing vehicles .",
    "loosely spoken , they result in a lower flow downstream a jam and a clear phase separation for certain density regimes . for the determination of the jam velocity we used the density - autocorrelation function @xmath80 . despite the high computational efforts ( @xmath81 )",
    "this method was suitable to be applied for our calculations .",
    "moreover , a definition of jams is not necessary and therefore the method can be applied to every model that provides density profiles along the road .",
    "the quantity @xmath80 reflects the two different phases and depends on the global density @xmath0 .",
    "the density regime is separated by @xmath47 . for @xmath66",
    "no jams can be detected by the applied method , whereas for larger @xmath0 the system is dominated by sequences of dense and free - flow regions , where @xmath46 remains finite and permits to estimate @xmath47 . at this point",
    "a transition to the congested region takes place . both the local length @xmath31 and the number of calculations @xmath35 have large influence on @xmath46 .",
    "further statements regarding the transition can not be given due to the numerical insufficiencies and accuracy .",
    "the jam velocity can be derived directly from @xmath80 . for sufficiently large @xmath0",
    "the absolute value of @xmath34 is a continuous and descending function of @xmath1 , but depends on the considered model .",
    "the differences between the models , especially for @xmath82 and @xmath83 , could be explained by waiting time arguments .",
    "the jam velocity is essentially expressed through @xmath84 and @xmath85 , irrespective of the model considered here .",
