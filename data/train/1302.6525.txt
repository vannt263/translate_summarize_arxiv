    "the _ large yield radiometer _ ( lyra : ) , is an xuv to muv ( soft x - ray to mid = ultraviolet ) solar radiometer embarked on the european space agency proba2 mission that was launched on 2 november 2009 .",
    "it revolves on a sun - synchronous orbit with an altitude around 720 km , and faces the sun continuously .",
    "lyra acquires solar - irradiance measurements in four broad spectral channels , from soft x - ray to uv , that have been chosen for their relevance to solar physics , space weather and aeronomy .",
    "the objective of the instrument is twofold :    * providing time series of solar irradiance with a very high sampling cadence ( up to 100hz ) in spectral ranges complementary to other active radiometers , _",
    "e.g. _ _ geostationary operations environmental satellite / extreme ultraviolet sensor _ ( goes / euvs ) , _ solar and heliospheric observatory / solar extreme ultraviolet monitor _",

    "( premos : ) , _ solar dynamics observatory / euv variability experiment _ ( sdo / eve : ) . * testing an innovative kind of wide - bandgap diamond detectors .",
    "such detectors , being radiation - hard and visible - blind , are particularly well adapted to observe the wavelengths targeted by lyra .    the instrument and its pre - flight calibration were described by .",
    "here , we review the design of the instrument in section [ s : design ] .",
    "section [ s : data ] provides an overview of the data products that are distributed to the scientific community and details their calibration .",

    "lyra is a shoe - box size instrument ( 315 @xmath0 92.5 @xmath0 222mm@xmath1 ) composed of three quasi - redundant units , each equipped with an individual cover and hosting four spectral channels ( see figure [ fig : lyra ] ) .",
    "a channel consists of a collimator , an optical filter , a detector , and two leds on the side .",
    "leds are located between the filter and the detector and emit at 375 and 470 nm ( see figure [ fig : optics ] ) .",
    "they are used to estimate the impact of ageing on the detectors .",
    "the three units are essentially similar in terms of spectral coverage , but involve non - identical associations of filters and detectors ( table [ tab : channels ] ) .",
    "the four bandpasses are indicated in this table , as well as their purity ( _ i.e. _ the ratio of the flux in the defined bandwidth to the total output signal ) .",
    "purities have been computed considering a quiet - sun - type spectrum .",
    "they show that for all channels but lyman-@xmath2 , most of the detected signal actually comes from the defined bandpasses .",
    "the lyman-@xmath2 channel , however , is highly contaminated by out - of - band radiation .",
    ".summary of the characteristics of lyra channels .",
    "the purity is defined as the ratio of the flux in the nominal wavelength range ( defined bandwidth ) to the total output signal .",
    "purities correspond to a solar - minimum - type spectrum .",
    "thicknesses of aluminum and zirconium filter layers are indicated in the  filter label \" column , together with the acton reference for lyman-@xmath2 and herzberg filters . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this section , we briefly describe the main topics of the scientific exploitation of the lyra data .",
    "flares are one of the main scientific targets of lyra .",
    "comparing the flare profiles in lyra channels with observations of instruments acquiring at other wavelengths goes / xrs , sdo / eve@xmath3 ) allows one to determine a chronology of the temperature evolution in the flare and to confront it with the theoretical scenarios for energy release ( see figure [ fig : flares ] , panel ( a ) ) .",
    "in addition , the lyra high sampling rate allows one to detect short - timescale phenomena , such as quasi - periodic pulsations ( qpp ) ( figure [ fig : flares ] , panel ( b ) )  with periods from fractions of a second to a few minutes  that are observed in flares in many wavelengths ( see ; ) . here again , lyra can help with completing the picture when trying to understand the origin of these qpp .        * *      the sun s primary influence on earth is through its radiation , and monitoring and understanding its variations are of prime importance .",
    "it is now well accepted that monitoring the solar spectral irradiance over the long - term is necessary in order to understand the role of the sun in earth s climate change , especially the euv part of solar spectrum , which strongly affects the status of earth s ionosphere .",
    "such long - term monitoring exceeds the capabilities of one single space instrument .",
    "it can only be achieved by combining observations of different missions .",
    "together with goes / euvs , soho / sem , timed / see , sorce / solstice , and sdo / eve , lyra is part of the picture .",
    "in addition , most of its channels are interesting candidates to serve as proxies for reconstructing the whole solar irradiance in the euv ( see and ) .      lyra measurements of irradiance profiles during solar eclipses are a matter of special interest . the irradiance data acquired during solar eclipses allow us to assess the center - to - limb variations ( clv ) of the solar brightness . as the radiation from different disk positions originates at different heights ,",
    "the clv curves allow to sample the broad range of layers of the solar atmosphere .",
    "this provides useful information for testing and refining solar atmosphere models ( _ cf . _ ; ) .    up to mid-2012 , lyra observed seven solar eclipses : two in 2010 ( 15 january and 11 july ) , four in 2011 ( 4 january , 1 june , 1 july , and 25 november ) , and one in 2012 ( 20 may ) .",
    "the 15 january 2010 eclipse was the longest annular solar eclipse of this millennium .",
    "the radiative transfer code for solar irradiance (: and ) was used to model the clv of the solar radiation measured in the lyra herzberg channel and to model the light curves of the 15 january 2010 eclipse .",
    "the comparison of measured and calculated light curves is presented in figure [ fig : eclipse ] .",
    "one can see that the calculations with are in excellent agreement with the lyra measurements ; see for a more complete analysis of eclipses .      as the sun approaches the earth s shadow , lyra s line - of - sight crosses deeper layers of the earth s atmosphere .",
    "there , atmospheric constituents absorb part of the solar radiation in a range of wavelengths that is intrinsically dependent of their chemical nature ( figure [ fig : occultation ] ( a ) ) . analyzing the extinction curve of each lyra channel",
    "therefore provides information about the distribution of some of theses constituents as a function of altitude .",
    "the main molecules active in lyra bandpasses are o , o@xmath4 , o@xmath5 , n@xmath4 , and h@xmath4o . in figure",
    "[ fig : occultation ] ( b ) , we provide an example of the reconstruction of herzberg - signal extinction by o@xmath4 and o@xmath5 ( see , and references therein ) .",
    "[ h ! ]    * *    observing the extinction curves also allows one to detect the contamination of a spectral channel by longer wavelengths .",
    "monitoring the evolution of such a curve therefore provides a reliable way to track any spectral degradation of the channel and hopefully to correct for it .",
    "the solar euv flux informs us about the occurrence of solar events and forms a vital input for aeronomy models @xcite .",
    "consequences of such events might affect , among others , telecommunication or spacecraft trajectories @xcite . with its quasi - continuous visibility of the sun ( the above - mentioned short occultation periods excepted ) , its high - cadence and its approximately nine contacts with the ground per day",
    ", lyra constitutes a valuable space - weather monitor .",
    "after more than two years of operations , lyra demonstrated its ability to produce time series of solar irradiance in the xuv ",
    "euv  muv range with a very favorable sampling rate .",
    "uncalibrated and calibrated data products , as well as various quicklooks and a list of flares , are distributed via the instrument website ( http://proba2.sidc.be ) . among others",
    ", the instrument appears to be particularly well adapted to the analysis of flares , for which its spectral channels and sampling rate are ideal .",
    "high sampling rate also benefits other fields of research , of which some have been mentioned in section [ s : sc_opportunities ] ( analysis of the center - to - limb brightness variation , determining the composition of earth s upper atmosphere ) .",
    "finally , lyra finds its place in the long - term monitoring of solar irradiance in the euv ",
    "uv range .",
    "the authors acknowledge the support from the belgian federal science policy office through the esa - prodex programme .",
    "lyra is a project of the centre spatial de lige , the physikalisch - meteorologisches observatorium davos , and the royal observatory of belgium , funded by the belgian federal science policy offce ( belspo ) and by the swiss bundesamt fr bildung und wissenschaft .",
    "the authors want to acknowledge this consortium , as well as the whole lyra team for their investment and motivation .",
    "a special thanks goes to d. mcmullin and j. zender for their pertinent suggestions ."
