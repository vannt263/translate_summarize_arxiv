    "the ` merger hypothesis ' ( toomre & toomre 1972 ) suggests that an elliptical galaxy will eventually result from the merger of two spiral galaxies .",
    "a more generalised paradigm for elliptical galaxy formation is that of hierarchical clustering and merging ( hcm ) . under this framework",
    "both stellar and gaseous mergers may form an elliptical ( e.g. bender 1992 ) .",
    "other factors such as the progenitor structure , mass ratios , orbital parameters , subsequent star formation and feedback processes will also contribute to the nature of the final remnant .",
    "given this range of possible initial conditions it is remarkable that the eventual products  elliptical galaxies  are so homogeneous , with their properties scaling in a well defined manner .",
    "the primary scaling relation for elliptical galaxies involves three parameters which relate galaxy structure ( e.g. effective radius r@xmath2 and surface brightness within the effective radius @xmath3 ) to dynamics ( e.g. central velocity dispersion @xmath4 ) .",
    "this 3parameter relation is called the fundamental plane ( djorgovski & davis 1987 ; dressler 1987 ) .",
    "ellipticals do not fill this plane entirely but rather a band within it ( guzmn 1993 ) .",
    "the existence of the fundamental plane ( fp ) and its small scatter ( @xmath0 0.1 dex ) provide tight constraints on elliptical galaxy formation and evolution ( bender 1992 ; guzmn 1993 ; renzini & ciotti 1993 ; zepf & silk 1996 ; pahre 1995 , 1998 ) .",
    "although small , the fp scatter is about twice that expected from measurement errors alone ( j@xmath5rgensen 1996 ) .",
    "application of the fp for distance determination has provided a strong impetus to understand the scatter about the fp and its various projections ( e.g. guzmn & lucey 1993 ) .",
    "a number of studies ( e.g. gregg 1992 ; j@xmath5rgensen 1993 ; prugniel & simien 1996 ) indicate that variations in stellar populations are responsible for some of the scatter . by including the additional scaling relations involving color and metallicity , prugniel & simien ( 1996 )",
    "were able to confirm that blue , low metallicity ellipticals deviate systematically from the fp .",
    "such galaxies probably possess younger stellar populations than the norm .",
    "ellipticals with blue colors and relatively low mg@xmath1 line indices are structurally disturbed galaxies ( schweizer 1990 ) .",
    "furthermore the correlation of color and line strength with a disturbance parameter has been interpreted as due to star formation associated with a gaseous merger event ( schweizer & seitzer 1992 ) .",
    "thus evidence is accumulating that a galaxy s position relative to the fp is related to the time since its last major burst of star formation , which in turn is due to a gas  rich encounter with another galaxy . showing that the fp scatter varies systematically with post ",
    "merger age would help confirm this picture and provide a general consistency test of the merger hypothesis .    in this _",
    "letter _ we compare the residuals from the fp and other scaling relations with recent age estimates for 88 early type galaxies and find a strong correlation .",
    "we interpret the fp residual  age trend in terms of an ageing burst of star formation and make an initial empirical attempt at describing the evolution of elliptical galaxies in terms of their key observational parameters .",
    "a future paper ( forbes 1998 ) will further explore the evolution of merger ",
    "remnants and the implications for elliptical galaxy formation .",
    "the main dataset used in this study is the compilation of over 400 ( mostly non  cluster ) early type galaxies from prugniel & simien ( 1996 ) .",
    "they defined the residual from the elliptical galaxy fp as r(@xmath6 .",
    "we also use their distance modulus ( for h@xmath7 = 75 km s@xmath8 mpc@xmath8 ) ; total blue magnitude ( b@xmath9 ) ; average b  v color index ; magnesium line strength index ( mg@xmath1 ) and central velocity dispersion ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the typical galaxy in this sample has m@xmath10",
    "@xmath0 20.5 and lies at a distance of @xmath030 mpc .    estimating the age of elliptical galaxies from their stars has proved difficult due to the age ",
    "metallicity degeneracy of old stellar populations .",
    "recently however this degeneracy has been broken by the combination of stellar spectroscopy and new models from the santa cruz group ( e.g gonzalez 1993 ; worthey 1994 ) .",
    "using spectroscopic ages from the santa cruz group ( trager 1998 ) and other workers ( i.e. kuntschner & davies ( 1998 ) , tantalo ( 1998 ) and mehlert 1997 ) we have compiled a list of galaxy ages .",
    "random errors on the age estimates are @xmath0 20% .",
    "an alternative method for estimating galaxy age that does not use spectroscopy is that of schweizer & seitzer ( 1992 ) .",
    "they associated morphological disturbance , via a star formation model , to a merger age .",
    "when a spectroscopic age was nt available , we included morphological ages .",
    "we note that strictly speaking the spectroscopic ages are central luminosity  weighted ages presumably representing the last episode of star formation , whereas the ` disturbance ' ages are claimed to represent the time since the last merger event .",
    "our sample consists of 65 ellipticals and 24 s0s with age estimates ; all but two are also in the prugniel & simien ( 1996 ) list .",
    "these galaxies are mostly in non ",
    "cluster environments and have a similar average luminosity and distance to the prugniel & simien sample .",
    "in figure 1 , we show the fp residuals calculated by prugniel & simien ( 1996 ) plotted against galaxy metallicity and age . for the former ,",
    "we show the galaxy metallicity ( z / z@xmath11 ) derived by trager ( 1998 ) for their data , which consitutes 70% of our spectroscopic ages .",
    "figure 1a shows that the scatter about the fp is not strongly dependent on metallicity for this sample of mostly field ellipticals . on the other hand",
    ", figure 1b shows that _ the scatter about the fp is correlated with age .",
    "_ this is true for both the trager subsample and for all 89 galaxies .",
    "prugniel & simien have shown that fp residuals are probably due to stellar population differences , namely ellipticals with negative residuals ( i.e. young ellipticals ) tend to be brighter with a higher surface brightness .",
    "thus we can provide strong support for the idea that an elliptical s position relative to the fp is dependent on the time since its last starburst .",
    "the mean residual value for our sample is r(@xmath12 = 0.07 @xmath13 0.02 .",
    "this indicates that it is on average , slightly younger than the full prugniel & simien sample .",
    "we have included four galaxies ( ngc 2865 , 3156 , 3921 , 7252 ) in figure 1b which are good candidates for being the remnant of a gaseous merger about 1 gyr ago .",
    "the location of these late stage mergers close to young ellipticals in this figure suggests that this burst was induced by a gaseous merger event , which may have accompanied the formation of the elliptical itself .    in order to estimate",
    "how much of the fp scatter is due to age effects we have calculated a least ",
    "squares fit to the e and s0 galaxies in figure 1b .",
    "the variance about this fit is 0.025 , whereas the variance assuming no fp dependence on galaxy age would be 0.038 .",
    "this indicates that at least 35% ( it would be more if observational errors were nt present ) of the fp variance in the b band is due to age effects .",
    "if we exclude s0s , then 43% of the variance is due to age .",
    "thus the introduction of age as a fourth parameter can be used to better characterise any individual galaxy .",
    "this result has implications for using the fp for distance determination .",
    "in particular , any sample for which the mean age varies with galaxy redshift will be systematically biased .",
    "comparisons between field and cluster fps may also be affected by mean age differences .",
    "prugniel & simien ( 1996 ) found that stellar population , rotation support and mass profile effects can fully explain the tilt of the fp . in paper ii",
    "we show that the fp tilt includes a weak age dependence .",
    "this age dependence contributes to the stellar population component found by prugniel & simien .    from figure 1b",
    "it appears that as young ellipticals evolve they approach the fp . in principle",
    ", this could be due to a combination of reduced @xmath3 , increased @xmath4 or global fading . in order to understand which of these evolutionary changes are responsible we require additional information . in the next section ,",
    "we incorporate a galaxy s b  v color and mg@xmath1 line strength to trace the evolution of a merger  induced starburst .",
    "interestingly , ellipticals have zero residuals at about 10 gyr and continue towards positive residuals as they get older .",
    "this suggests that we should consider the fp as having an envelope defined by the oldest ellipticals , and that the current fp relation represents typical @xmath0 10 gyr ellipticals .",
    "we now examine the evolution of merger  remnants and young ellipticals in more detail by using the correlations of b  v and mg@xmath1 with galaxy mass . for elliptical galaxies ( with m@xmath14 and @xmath15 km s@xmath8 ) from the full prugniel & simien ( 1996 ) sample , we have determined the best linear fit to the scaling relations of b  v and mg@xmath1 with m@xmath10 and log @xmath4 .",
    "the residuals about these correlations take the form of @xmath16 .",
    "the coefficients from all four scaling relations are given in table 1 .",
    "the log residuals from these scaling relations , for our 88 sample galaxies are shown in figure 2 , again plotted against log galaxy age .",
    "young ellipticals tend to have negative residuals in the sense that they are bluer and have weaker line strengths for a given mass .",
    "figure 2 also shows that late stage mergers fit smoothly into the chronological trend .",
    "are the luminosity , color and line strength trends consistent with the fading of a merger ",
    "induced starburst ? to answer this question in detail would require a sophisticated model which includes not only properties of the starburst but also dynamical changes for a range of initial conditions .",
    "when created , such models could then be used to predict the evolution of @xmath3 and @xmath4 in a merger  remnant .",
    "however here we are interested in understanding the broad trends which are perhaps best illustrated by using a simple model with reasonable assumptions .",
    "we have chosen an instantaneous burst model from bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) , as the merger  induced",
    "starburst occurs over a very short timescale ( i.e. few myr ) compared to the merger timescale .",
    "the model has a salpeter imf with solar metallicity .",
    "we have assumed that the burst dominates the central region but contributes only 10% of the total galaxy mass ( e.g. hibbard & van gorkom 1996 ) .",
    "the remaining 90% of the galaxy is taken to be an old stellar population formed at high redshift , so that it has the same age for each galaxy in figure 2 .",
    "its properties are chosen to be appropriate for a typical old elliptical .",
    "unlike the global quantities b  v and m@xmath10 , mg@xmath1 is typically measured in the central region only and we assume a 100% contribution from the burst .",
    "we have held @xmath4 constant as merger simulations ( e.g. barnes 1992 ; navarro 1990 ) indicate that there is little or no internal dynamical evolution after the merger is complete .",
    "to summarise , the evolution of the burst magnitude , color and mg@xmath1 index are described by the bruzual & charlot model , while the old galaxy stars have a constant total magnitude , color and mg@xmath1 index .",
    "the central velocity dispersion is fixed .",
    "the final model has the following contributions : m@xmath10 10% burst by mass 90% fixed , b ",
    "v 10% burst 90% fixed and mg@xmath1 100% burst .",
    "these models can then be used to crudely track the evolution of an elliptical following a central starburst in the parameter space of b  v , mg@xmath1 , m@xmath10 and @xmath4 .",
    "thus we can form evolutionary tracks ( shown by solid lines ) in the residual plots of figure 2 . from figure 1b we found that a typical ellipticals have zero fp residuals at @xmath0 10 gyr .",
    "we have therefore chosen to normalise the models to zero residual at 10 gyr with respect to each of the scaling relations , thus defining the properties of the old stellar population .",
    "figure 2 shows that age effects the scatter in all four scaling relations presented .",
    "the data are consistent with the steady reddening , increasing line strength and global fading of an ageing burst of star formation .",
    "thus it appears that the color , luminosity and line strength trends can be understood purely in terms of evolving stellar populations .",
    "we have implicitly assumed in our models that the burst fraction and metallicity are both independent of post  merger age . at early epochs",
    "it is quite plausible that the progenitor galaxies would be more gas  rich than today .",
    "we would also expect this gas to be relatively metal  poor .",
    "these differences may however have little effect on the model track as they tend to work in opposite directions . increasing the burst strength steepens the model curve , while a lower metallicity for the burst population tends to flatten it .",
    "in this _ letter _ we have shown that the scatter about the fundamental plane ( fp ) , at least for non  cluster galaxies , is largely due to variations in galaxy age ( which probably reflects the time since the last major burst of star formation ) .",
    "this supports the view that field ellipticals span a wide range in age with only small differences in metallicity ( trager 1998 ) .",
    "on the other hand , galaxies in the fornax cluster appear to be roughly coeval but with a range of metallicities ( kuntschner & davies 1998 ) .",
    "we speculate that the fp scatter for cluster ellipticals may reveal a stronger metallicity rather than age dependence .",
    "starburst models with a wider range of parameters ( e.g. different metallicities , non ",
    "salpeter imf etc ) may provide additional insight into the evolution of merger ",
