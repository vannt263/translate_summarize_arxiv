    "the helical edge states appear in counterpropagating pairs , and the states with equal energy and opposite wave numbers , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , form a kramers pair .",
    "thus , elastic scattering from one helical edge state ( he s ) to the other one within a pair can not be induced by time - reversal invariant potentials e.g.  stemming from impurities.@xcite therefore , the transport through a 2d ti is to a large extend ballistic with a quantized conductance of @xmath4 per pair of hess .",
    "this highlights the central role of time - reversal symmetry in tis .",
    "quantized conductance have recently been measured in micron - sized samples in hgte quantum wells,@xcite which to date is the most important experimental demonstration of a 2d ti .",
    "evidence of edge state transport was found in both two - terminal@xcite and multi - terminal@xcite devices .",
    "moreover , clever experiments combining the metallic spin hall effect and a 2d ti in a hgte quantum well ( qw ) demonstrated the connection between the spin and the propagation direction.@xcite however , also deviations from perfect conductance have been observed in longer hgte devices,@xcite which could stem from e.g.  inelastic scattering mechanisms.@xcite the effect of external magnetic fields have also been considered.@xcite the ti state in hgte qws was predicted by bernevig , hughes and zhang ( bhz)@xcite by using a simplified @xmath5 model containing states with @xmath0- and @xmath1-like symmetry , respectively .",

    "most studies consider the so - called contact hf interaction,@xcite which is relevant for electrons in orbital states with @xmath0-like symmetry e.g.  the conduction band in gaas .",
    "however , for @xmath1-like orbital states  such as the valence band in gaas  the contact hf interaction is absent .",
    "nevertheless , other anisotropic hf interactions are present for @xmath1-like states such as the dipole - dipole - like hf interaction,@xcite which can play a significant role e.g. for the decoherence of a hole confined in a quantum dot.@xcite    hf interactions and dynamical nuclear spin polarization have also been investigated in the context of integer quantum hall systems,@xcite which contain unidirectional edge states . here",
    "hf - induced spin - flip transitions between the unidirectional edge states can create nuclear spin polarization locally at the boundary of the 2d sample.@xcite recently , we have predicted a similar phenomenon for a 2d ti , namely that embedded fixed spins such as the nuclear spins in a 2d ti can polarize locally at the boundary due to a current through the hess.@xcite interestingly , the 2d ti with localized spins remains ballistic,@xcite except if additional spin - flip mechanisms for the localized spins are present.@xcite however , combining localized spins and rashba spin - orbit coupling in the 2d ti can produce a conductance change.@xcite in the previous works,@xcite the interaction between the fixed spins embedded into the 2d ti and the hess were modelled phenomenologically .",
    "in contrast , here we pay special attention to the detailed forms of the hf interactions within a 2d ti .    in this paper , we find the different hf interactions within the bhz model for a hgte qw . to this end , we take into account both the @xmath0- and @xmath1-like states of the bhz model , which couple differently to the nuclear spins .",
