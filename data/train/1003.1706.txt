    "the recent wfc3/ir camera on the hubble space telescope ( kimble et al .",
    "2006 ) has completely revolutionized our ability to search for galaxies at @xmath4 due to its extraordinary imaging capabilities in the near - infrared  allowing for large areas to be surveyed to great depths .",
    "already some 40 credible @xmath21@xmath07 - 8 galaxy candidates have been identified in the first hundred orbits of observations ( oesch et al .",

    "2009a ) , only @xmath02.5 orbits of wfc3/ir observations are required to find a similar @xmath10 candidate .    despite these significant advances in our observational capabilities with wfc3/ir to reach deep and identify large numbers of faint @xmath4 galaxies , a full characterization of the galaxy population at @xmath10 requires that we identify large numbers of galaxies at _ both _ high and low luminosities .",
    "all but @xmath06 galaxies in early selections of @xmath21@xmath07 - 8 galaxies from early wfc3/ir observations over the ers / hudf09 fields have magnitudes faintward of 26.5 mag ( e.g. , oesch et al .  2010a ; wilkins et al .  2010a ; bouwens et al .",

    "we describe the selection of those @xmath4 candidates in detail , discuss the properties and layout of the nicmos observations , and summarize the properties of the sample .",
    "we also estimate the contamination rates and the selection volume for this sample .",

    "additional evidence for the source being spurious comes from its proximity to the edge of the nic3 field where it was found ( due to enhanced non - gaussianity of the noise there ) . to test the spurious hypothesis",

    "none of these exposures provided a dominant contribution to the cumulative @xmath5-band flux , leaving us with no compelling reason to flag this particular candidate as spurious .",

    "as we discuss in  3.6 , we would expect @xmath01 sn to be identified over our @xmath065 arcmin@xmath1 @xmath5-band observations as a @xmath4 galaxy candidate .",
    "besides these 2 formal @xmath6-dropout candidates , there were 3 other @xmath4 candidates identified in the nicmos @xmath5-band data for follow - up ( gns - sp1 , gns - sp2 , gns - sp3 in table  [ tab : candlist ] ) , but which were not detected in the later @xmath6-band observations .",
    "this would give these sources nominal @xmath53 colors @xmath93 mag ( @xmath17 ) and make them possible @xmath9 @xmath6-dropout candidates .",

    "such a selection yielded @xmath012 @xmath48-dropout candidates , but all of the candidates ( on the negative images ) could be eliminated due to an obvious association with defects or irregularities in the reduction . while this might suggest that spurious sources do not dominate our @xmath6-dropout selection , there were a modest number of formal @xmath3 detections on the negative images quite close to satisfying our @xmath6-dropout selection criteria , and so contamination from spurious sources here is certainly not impossible .",
