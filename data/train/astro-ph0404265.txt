    "one of the primary goals of the research consortium on nearby stars ( recons ) is to discover stars that are currently missing from compendia of the sun s nearest neighbors .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , we estimate that as many as 30% of the nearby star systems lurk undiscovered within 10 parsecs , the horizon of the recons sample .",
    "the recons team is using both of the methods typically used to reveal nearby stars  high proper motion and photometric distance estimates  to discover new nearby systems . here",
    "we report first results of a new initiative resulting in the discovery of five new high proper motion objects with @xmath4 @xmath6 1.0/yr in the region around the south celestial pole , along with an analysis of the newly revised sample of all similarly defined high proper motion stars in the same region .",
    "to date , luyten and giclas have provided the bulk of high proper motion star systems . the valuable _ lhs catalogue _",
    "* hereafter lhs ) is a compendium of stars that includes 3583 objects with annual proper motions greater than 0.5/yr .",
    "included in this list are 525 stellar systems that have motions greater than 1.0/yr .",
    "many of these systems were also reported by giclas and collaborators @xcite .",
    "both the luyten and giclas surveys were monumental undertakings in an era before extensive computer power was available and electronic data mining possible .",
    "moreover , not all parts of the sky were covered uniformly in those surveys .",
    "significantly lower completeness in the most southerly declinations is particularly noteworthy .",
    "there is no doubt as to the scientific usefulness of the monumental luyten and giclas surveys ; however there are two key shortcomings that have always dogged efforts to exploit those catalogues for quantifiably complete samples .",
    "first , the absolute astrometric accuracy of luyten s catalogue is poor by modern standards , making recovery of some of the catalogued objects very difficult ( eg .",
    "this is despite the availability of finder charts in the _ lhs atlas _ @xcite .",
    "second , and more significantly , the completeness of surveys produced using a variety of techniques ( including manual plate ` blinking ' ) has been difficult to establish .",
    "worries concerning the completeness of the lhs have been compounded over the past decade by a spate of new discoveries , for many of which there is no obvious reason as to why they were missed in the earlier surveys . adding further fuel to the firey completeness debates is the fact that invariably newly discovered objects turn out to be rather interesting , because completeness is chiefly an issue at relatively faint magnitudes and high proper motions where new types of intrinsically faint , high velocity and potentially nearby stars tend to be found ( eg .",
    "clearly , if there is a large and unquantifiable bias against certain classes of objects in the early surveys , then statistical corrections ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can never hope to recover an accurate estimate of the true numbers of all types of star .",
    "recently , however , the availability of homogeneous , multi  colour and multi  epoch schmidt survey plate collections along with fast , high precision scanning machines capable of digitising them has enabled significant progress .",
    "an example is the supercosmos sky survey ( hereafter sss , @xcite ; that paper also briefly describes some of the other major digitisation programmes ) .",
    "these newly digitised sky surveys have enabled much progress in systematic trawls for high proper motion stars ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "completeness questions can now be more accurately addressed ( eg .",
    "* ) and recovery of many of luyten s discoveries has become possible ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in addition to discovery of new objects .",
    "thus , recent astrometric efforts to reveal high proper motion stars are meeting with continued success . several studies investigating the southern sky have yielded new systems with @xmath4 @xmath6 1.0/yr .",
    "the large effort of wroblewski and collaborators ( @xcite and references therein ) has resulted in discovery of two systems ( wt 248 and wt 1827 ) .",
    "the calan - eso survey of ruiz and collaborators ( @xcite and @xcite ) has yielded three new systems ( er2 , er8 , and ce 89 ) . work by scholz and collaborators has used apm measurements of uk schmidt telescope survey plates ( eg .  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and the sss ( eg .  @xcite and references therein ) to reveal three systems ( apmpm j19574216 , apmpm j23304736 , and ssspm j22317514ab ) .",
    "the study of @xcite also used the sss , and found new white dwarfs ( eg .  wd0205053 , wd0351564 , and wd2214390 ) . furthermore , @xcite report a systematic high proper motion star survey employing sss data ; detailed follow - up of potentially interesting objects is underway by our group and others .",
    "astrometric searches of the northern sky also continue to yield high proper motion stars . in an innovative , systematic search of the sky north of declination @xmath02.8@xmath1 and within 25@xmath1 of the galactic plane ,",
    "@xcite have found 18 new systems with @xmath4 @xmath6 1.00/yr , by far the most productive recent effort , while @xcite have reported a remarkable system with @xmath4 @xmath7 5.06/yr by searching the skymorph database of near  earth asteroid tracking data @xcite .    in an effort to discover previously missed high proper motion objects in the southern sky , a new search by the recons team",
    "was initiated using sss data .",
    "the new objects have been dubbed scr sources , corresponding to the supercosmos recons search . in this paper",
    "we present the first results of this search , which includes five new objects with motions larger than 1.0/yr in only @xmath8% of the entire sky .",
    "we have extracted @xmath2 photometry from 2mass to provide an extended color baseline that permits accurate photometric distance estimates . in a follow  up paper @xcite",
    "we will present further optical photoelectric photometry , spectroscopy and analysis of accurate photometric parallaxes for the sample .",
    "the sss @xcite is ideally suited to systematic searches for high proper motion stars .",
    "the survey consists of multi ",
    "colour @xmath9 schmidt photographic observations with @xmath10 at two distinct epochs , but in general all four passbands ( plate magnitudes denoted by @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , and hereafter referred to as @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) were observed at different epochs separated by up to 50 years .",
    "data for the entire southern hemisphere are currently publicly available ( see @xcite for details ) and the survey programme is currently being extended into the northern hemisphere .",
    "as described above , there have been several searches for high proper motion stars using sss data .",
    "each has had a different emphasis , with different science goals .",
    "the survey of @xcite is an automated search primarily using the two @xmath10 band plates ( uk and eso schmidt surveys ) in each field of the sss south of @xmath19 @xmath7 @xmath020@xmath1 , aimed at cataloguing cool dwarfs to a lower proper motion limit of @xmath4 @xmath7 0.18/yr .",
    "the search methodology employs software  automated multiple  pass pairing between only two @xmath10 plates , and necessarily has rather stringent limits on image quality ( eg",
    ".  profile class , proximity to bright stars and general morphology ) to yield a clean catalogue of thousands of stars ; the intention was that no manual sifting of this automatically generated catalogue would be required .",
    "the chief limitations of the search method are general incompleteness resulting from the stringent quality constraints , restriction of sky area covered due to necessary avoidance of crowded regions and incompleteness at high proper motions  c.f .",
    "@xcite section  4  due to spurious pairing at large image displacement .",
    "the trawl employed by @xcite was similar to that of pokorny et al .  but was aimed at cool ( but relatively blue ) white dwarfs .",
    "detections therefore relied on presence on the @xmath15 plates as well as the two @xmath10 plates , and hence less stringent quality cuts could be used to obtain a clean sample .",
    "this survey was also generalised to use @xmath20 ` e ' ( @xmath21 @xmath10 ) data in the equatorial zone @xmath22 in lieu of @xmath12 material , but employed a proper motion threshold of @xmath4 @xmath7 0.33/yr . in this case",
    ", some visual checking of the available source image data was employed after selection of stars via colour and reduced proper motion .",
    "however , the @xcite survey also suffered from the same incompleteness problems at high proper motions , and inability to probe more crowded , lower latitude regions of sky .",
    "for the purposes of supplying candidates for recons , a new search strategy is being employed that attempts to circumvent the completeness problems of previous sss efforts by a combination of full use of all astrometric information between the four plates available in every field , and relaxed quality / morphology criteria along with a final step of manual sifting to produce clean target lists . in some ways",
    "this is an unsatisfactory return to the luyten ",
    "style approach by including a subjective human element to the process , but it seems that at least for surveys employing parameterised image detection lists this is the only way of ensuring high levels of completeness . ultimately , it is likely that a whole ",
    "sky application of a pixel  based process like the superblink algorithm of @xcite is the only way of attaining the highest possible completeness from digitised schmidt plate scans ; even then the problems of saturation and scattered light near bright stellar cores remain ( hence , areal completeness and completeness for close binaries will never be close to 100% ) .",
    "briefly , the new scr search starts with each individual set of parameterised detections ( the so  called image analysis mode data ",
    "see @xcite ) from all plates in the same field positionally error  mapped to a common co - ordinate system using a rigorous application of the @xcite error mapping algorithm .",
    "the default sss pairing @xcite is then used to exclude all images that appear on all four plates having astrometric solutions indicating proper motion less than the limit ( here , 0.4/yr ) along with goodness  of  fit parameter @xmath23 .",
    "then , all images that are either unpaired or have inconsistent astrometric solutions ( resulting from erroneous matching in the simple default sss scheme ) are processed one by one in all possible combinations amongst the available measurements out to a maximum displacement dictated by the upper proper motion limit chosen for the survey ( here , 10/yr ) and the maximum epoch difference between the set of plates .",
    "this ` brute force ' approach is made possible by modern computers and storage which are capable of processing large amounts of data at high io bandwidth .",
    "the other innovation in our latest sss trawl for recons is that single cuts in a range of quality / morphology parameters are not made ; rather a set of warning conditions is defined at levels set by maximising completeness with respect to the lhs ( at the same time endeavouring to minimise contamination by spurious detections to make the final manual sifting problem tractable ) .",
    "a violation threshold is set such that only when three quality conditions are violated for a four plate detection ( two for a three plate detection ) will a candidate be thrown away as certainly dubious .    the scr search is being carried out starting at the south celestial pole and is moving north .",
    "this paper describes the first phase of the search , which includes the region from @xmath19 @xmath7 @xmath24 to @xmath25 .",
    "figure  [ fields ] shows the fields currently surveyed .",
    "number labels in figure  [ fields ] are eso / src standard schmidt survey field designations ; black areas represent fields included while white areas indicate fields currently excluded due to crowding problems ( areas of low galactic latitude or areas within the magellanic clouds ) . in total ,",
    "@xmath8% of the sky has been searched in this first effort .",
    "the initial sift of the sss dataset for recons included sources with proper motions determined to fall between 0.4/yr and 10.0/yr , and magnitude @xmath26 .",
    "the primary goal is to discover objects moving faster than @xmath4 @xmath7 0.5/yr , but the lower boundary on @xmath4 was chosen to be 0.4/yr so that lhs objects with motions near 0.5/yr could be recovered if computed proper motion was slightly less than the cutoff due to measurement errors in either sss data or the lhs .",
    "the total number of candidate objects detected with @xmath4@xmath27 @xmath7 0.410.0/yr in this initial search was 897 .",
    "spurious high proper motion detections can arise due to plate defects , blended sources and halo ` sources ' around bright stars ( for example , we note that the list of  @xcite contains 8 apparently spurious sources having @xmath28/yr  one at more than 10/yr ) .",
    "a multi - step sifting process was used to vet the scr search candidates for true and false detections , including checks of magnitudes , colors , and image ellipticities .",
    "the @xmath16 and @xmath17 magnitudes were checked for consistency , and the colors were examined to determine whether they matched that of a real object , i.e. both @xmath29 and @xmath30 positive , or both negative . if the candidate passed both checks , it was passed on to the visual inspection stage .    in cases where a candidate failed the first two tests , the ellipticity quality flag was also checked .",
    "experience revealed that if two or more image ellipticities were larger than 0.2 , the object was spurious .",
    "detections that failed all three tests were classified as false without visual inspection . as a final check ,",
    "all of the 99 candidates found between @xmath19 @xmath7 @xmath090 and @xmath080 were inspected visually ( regardless of the checks ) , and all fell into the appropriate true or false detection bins .",
    "for the true detections , coordinates were cross - correlated with the simbad database and the nltt catalog .",
    "if the coordinates agreed to within a few arcminutes and the magnitudes and proper motions were consistent , the detection was labeled as previously known . for detections without known proper motion counterparts ,",
    "visual inspection definitively confirmed or refuted a real proper motion object . in a few cases , the coordinates agreed well , but the magnitudes did not .",
    "several of these near matches turned out to be new common proper motion companions to a previously known proper motion object .    in summary , these checks revealed 443 false detections ( 49% of the candidates ) ; additionally , 72 of the 897 candidates were duplicate detections resulting from the generous eso / src plate overlap regions .",
    "of the resulting 382 real , distinct objects , 262 were recoveries of previously cataloged objects , including many lhs / ltt objects and stars from the other surveys mentioned in section  1 .",
    "finally , 120 ( 13% of the initial candidate list ) were found to be new discoveries , including a handful of new common proper motion companions to already known primaries .",
    "of the 120 new objects discovered and the 262 known objects recovered in this phase of the scr effort , we concentrate here on the subsample of 28 stars with @xmath4@xmath27 @xmath5 1.0/yr , which are listed in table 1 .",
    "names for the five new scr stars are given in the first column ( finder charts are given in figure 2 ) , whereas the known names are given for the remaining 23 stars .",
    "also listed are the sss photographic astrometry and photometry for all 28 objects .",
    "coordinates are precessed and proper motion corrected to equinox and epoch j2000.0 , and are accurate to @xmath31  arcsec .",
    "proper motions ( and their errors ) and the position angles for each target are given .",
    "we quote photometry in table  [ photography ] from the uk schmidt r original survey plates ( @xmath17 ) because these data are , in general , of higher signal  to  noise and more uniformly calibrated than that from the eso ",
    "r copy plates ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "in addition , red objects sometimes do not have reliable detections at @xmath15 , while blue objects are often faint on @xmath18 plates .",
    "note that the absolute calibration of the individual passbands is subject to systematic errors that increase as the brightness of the source increases @xcite .",
    "however , because corrections to colours are applied to the data with respect to the @xmath15 plates , these systematic errors are not present in colour indices ( eg .  @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) .",
    "consequently , the relative accuracy of sss colour indices is much better than the absolute accuracy of individual passband photometry .",
    "as expected , the five new stars are fainter ( @xmath17 @xmath7 14.12 to 16.33 ) than nearly all of the known stars ( @xmath17 @xmath7 7.49 to 14.99 ) except the double white dwarf system ( @xmath17 @xmath7 15.82 and 16.21 ) found by @xcite using supercosmos data .",
    "we make no claim as to the absolute completeness of our new scr search at this preliminary stage .",
    "however , we note that in the area surveyed , there are 169 lhs stars ; we recover 127 of these . at first sight",
    ", this success rate of 75% seems rather poor , but this test requires closer examination .",
    "the lhs catalog is biased ( particularly so in the southern hemisphere ) towards brighter magnitudes , and the scr search employs deep , sky  limited schmidt survey plates upon which stars with @xmath34 have heavily saturated and large , extended images .",
    "moreover , the surveyed region in figure  [ fields ] is at generally low galactic latitude .",
    "lhs objects missed by our procedure are lost because of blending problems on the source plates and the consequent failure of the standard supercosmos image analysis software @xcite in unscrambling and/or accurately parameterising deblended components .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 2 , where the @xmath15 images of scr18456357 and scr18486855 are blended to such an extent as to render their @xmath15 parameters unusable ( eg .  table  [ photography ] ) .",
    "blending is particularly problematic for brighter images , and as already stated the deep sky  limited schmidt survey plates are not well suited to studies of stars brighter than @xmath35 .",
    "if we limit the lhs completeness comparison to magnitudes @xmath36 , we recover 112 out of 130 stars  a somewhat improved 86% success rate .",
    "if we further limit the comparison to stars with @xmath4 @xmath6 1.0/yr , we recover 18 out of 18 lhs stars  100% success .",
    "hence our search is most successful in the region of parameter space where the lhs is least complete : at fainter magnitudes and high proper motions .",
    "note that images of moving stars are more susceptible to crowding than non  moving stars .",
    "if a high proper motion star is irretrievably blended on one r plate or on two or more of any of the four sss plates , the scr trawl will not detect it .",
    "images of slow moving stars are , of course , likely to be isolated on all plates if they are isolated on one ; this is not the case for fast moving stars , especially when they are traversing a crowded field .",
    "if we compare scr success versus lhs for @xmath4 @xmath6 1.0/yr _ without _ a magnitude cut of @xmath36 , we recover 20 out of 29 stars  this low success rate of 69% illustrates the difficulty of finding bright , high proper motion stars using deep , sky  limited schmidt plates .",
    "these 20 stars are listed in table  [ photography ] with their lhs numbers .",
    "the sample of 127 recovered lhs objects provides a control against which the scr astrometric measurements were compared . in figures",
    "[ complhs ] and  [ compbsn ] we show a comparison of our astrometric results with those of the lhs as originally published and using revised data @xcite . in both cases",
    ", positions have been precessed and proper motion corrected to a common equinox and epoch ( j2000.0 for both ) . interestingly , although the bakos et al.positions are far superior to the original lhs values , their proper motion determinations are clearly inferior , even allowing for the objects labelled ` b ' or ` b ' in their list ( open circles in figure  [ compbsn ] ) .",
    "the scr and lhs proper motions are in much better agreement , indicating the quality of luyten s original measurements . while the bakos et al .",
    "positions are a vast improvement and enable easy recovery of lhs stars ( eg .  as has been done here ) , their proper motion estimates should not be used in place of the original lhs measurements .",
    "the infrared @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 photometry has been extracted from 2mass by oasis . because these objects are high proper motion stars , all of them were manually identified by comparison with finding charts instead of retrieving data by setting a search radius around a given ra and dec .",
    "the photometry is given in table  [ photometry ] for both the new scr stars and the known stars .",
    "the errors ( and here we adopt the @xmath40 errors where _ x _ is _ j _ , _ h _ , or _",
    "k _ ) that give a measure of the total photometric uncertainty , including global and systematic terms ) are 0.02 to  0.03 mag in most cases , and are less than 0.05 mag in all cases except scr20125956 ( 0.11 at @xmath38 and no given error at @xmath39 because it is at the limit of @xmath39 band detectability ) , j22317515 ( 0.06 at @xmath38 and 0.12 at @xmath39 ) , and j22317514 ( 0.06 at @xmath38 and 0.08 at @xmath39 ) .",
    "the 2mass frames have also been used to confirm the proper motion for all five newly discovered stars .",
    "the infrared photometry is useful because it permits a color extension from the optical @xmath15 band to @xmath39 , thereby spanning more than a factor of four in effective wavelength .",
    "diagnostics bridging the photographic and infrared bands are particularly good for the detection of blue and very red objects .",
    "@xmath41 is given in table  [ photometry ] as a color indicator because for the faintest red objects @xmath15 is not available .",
    "given that scr20125956 is a fast - moving , faint object , yet appears rather blue , with @xmath42 @xmath7 0.40 ( the value for @xmath43 @xmath7 0.22 is suspect because of the 2mass faint @xmath39 limit ) , it is almost certainly a white dwarf .",
    "computation of its reduced proper motion @xmath44 and ( @xmath45 places it firmly in the region of spectroscopically confirmed white dwarfs in figure  1 of @xcite .",
    "it is also evident that scr18456357 is a very red object @xmath46 @xmath7 7.82@xmath47 , and therefore likely to be quite close , given it s bright apparent magnitudes .",
    "in order to develop reliable color - m@xmath3 relations , both supercosmos and 2mass were searched for stars in the recons 10 pc sample .",
    "these stars are used because they generally have high quality trigonometric parallax values and have been vetted better than any other sample of stars for close companions that would corrupt flux and color measurements .",
    "photographic @xmath15 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 magnitudes were extracted for all stars south of the current declination cutoff of supercosmos ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "single stars with reliable ( unblended , unsaturated ) photographic magnitudes were then examined in 2mass , from which @xmath2 photometry was obtained .",
    "the final cut provided 54 main sequence , single , stars with reliable magnitudes in all six bandpasses .",
    "these were supplemented with one additional object , gj 1001 b @xmath7 lhs 102 b , an l dwarf found in all bands but @xmath15 ( the complete sample and magnitudes can be obtained from the authors upon request ) .",
    "in total , there are 15 possible color - m@xmath3 relations that can be derived from the six bandpasses . of these ,",
    "@xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 are not useful because in each case the range in color is quite restricted and does not predict reliable m@xmath3 values .",
    "the remaining 11 relations are used as an ensemble to generate up to 11 different distance estimates for each star , provided that the star s color falls within the valid range .",
    "each relation is locked to m@xmath3 because practically all undiscovered nearby stars ( and many brown dwarfs ) of interest will have a reliable @xmath53 in 2mass .",
    "four exemplary relations are illustrated in figure  [ relations ] .",
    "the @xmath54 and @xmath55 relations represent the largest range in color for photographic only and photographic / infrared colors .",
    "the @xmath55 relation , in particular , shows the great strength in combining optical and infrared data , spanning more than six full magnitudes in color .",
    "the less reliable @xmath56 and @xmath57 relations are also illustrated . in these cases ,",
    "the colors span only @xmath583.5 magnitudes , and the scatter in the photographic magnitudes compromises the relations .",
    "nonetheless , they still add weight to the final ensemble distance estimates .",
    "details for each fit , including the number of objects used to create the fit , its applicable range , the coefficients , and the rms in magnitudes , are given in table  [ details ] .    to provide a measure of the ensemble technique s reliability",
    ", the recons stars of known distance have been run back through the relations .",
    "each star has up to 11 different distance estimates that are combined to produce a mean distance estimate and error , represented by the standard deviation of the individual estimates .",
    "the average offset between the estimated and true distances is 26% , which is remarkable given the imprecise nature of the photographic magnitudes , and of course , the intrinsic cosmic scatter in the stars due to metallicity and age effects .",
    "these relations can be used within the stated ranges for single , main sequence stars with reliable magnitudes found in supercosmos and 2mass .",
    "the distances derived using these relations will , of course , not be reliable for subdwarfs . even for main sequence stars , in a few cases",
    "the effects of age and metallicity will be severe enough that the predicted and true distances will differ by more than 50% , as is the case for seven of the 55 stars used in the relations . in comparison , 14 of the 55 stars have estimated distances within 10% of their true distances .",
    "table  [ distances ] gives distance estimates and errors for the new scr discoveries and the previously known stars that were recovered during the scr search .",
    "two of the four red scr stars are likely to be within the 10 pc horizon of recons .",
    "scr18456357 is likely to be one of the nearest few dozen stars .",
    "based on preliminary ccd @xmath59 photometry and photometric distance relations for white dwarfs , we estimate a distance of @xmath581525 pc for scr20125956",
    ".    only 11 of the 23 previously known objects have trigonometric parallax measurements , as given in the yale parallax catalogue @xcite and from the hipparcos mission @xcite . in general those that have trigonometric distances",
    "match the distance estimates well , although lhs 128 and lhs 531 may be unresolved multiples because they are significantly further than predicted .",
    "all of the scr discoveries and previously known stars without trigonometric measurements that are predicted to be within 25 pc have been included in our cerro tololo interamerican observatory parallax investigation ( ctiopi ) , as indicated in the notes column .",
    "several of these stars will likely fall within the 10 pc horizon of the recons sample .",
    "it is useful to assess briefly the complete , whole ",
    "sky sample of high proper motion stars as it is currently known . at georgia state one of the authors of this work ( jao ) has compiled a comprehensive list of objects with @xmath4 @xmath6 1.0/yr .",
    "although this list is the subject of a future paper , we note here that the distribution of systems is , as expected , tipped to the north . as of january 1 , 2003 ,",
    "the counts of published systems in sky quartets of equal area are 143 from @xmath19 @xmath7 @xmath6090 to @xmath6030 , 153 from @xmath19 @xmath7 @xmath6030 to @xmath6000 , 127 from @xmath19 @xmath7 @xmath000 to @xmath030 , and 126 from @xmath19 @xmath7 @xmath030 to @xmath090 , yielding a total of 549 systems .",
    "the 8% overabundance in the north is an indicator that more fast moving systems are likely to be found at southern declinations .",
    "the five new objects reported here are another step toward rectifying this incompleteness in the southern sky .",
    "the five new stars reported here provide important new nearby star candidates , with proper motions ranking them in the top few hundred stellar systems .",
    "the two fastest movers , scr18456357 and scr11387721 , rank respectively as the 34th and 54th fastest proper motion systems known .",
    "these are merely the harbingers of a set of new high proper motion objects that remain to be discovered in the southern sky using supercosmos sky survey data . in a follow - up paper",
    "@xcite we present accurate optical photoelectric photometry and spectroscopy of high proper motion objects in this portion of the scr survey , thereby revealing their true nature and allowing us to refine the distance estimates .",
    "in addition to the five stars highlighted here , there are 116 additional new discoveries with @xmath4 @xmath7 0.41.0/yr that will also be the subjects of future efforts .",
    "such nearby stars are , of course , useful for bolstering the population statistics of the galaxy , and move us closer to an accurate census of the sun s neighbors .",
    "the momentum for discovering new nearby stars comes from many directions , including the identification of systems for stellar mass determinations , planet searches , the detection of signatures of life , and seti , simply because proximity is a key element in any search in which resolution is required or the intrinsic signals may be weak . the scr search reported here is merely in its initial phase and will undoubtedly reveal many new nearby stars as we continue to push northward .",
    "this astrometric search is complementary to photometric and spectroscopic searches for nearby stars , such as @xcite and @xcite .",
    "all of these searches continue to yield new nearby stars , bringing about a sort of nearby star renaissance , as large scale surveys and significant computer power are turned to the discovery of solar neighbors .",
    "funding for the supercosmos sky survey is provided by the uk particle physics and astronomy research council .",
