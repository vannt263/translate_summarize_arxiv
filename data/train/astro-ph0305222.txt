    "a large number of papers have been published lately on the determination of the distance to the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "this increased interest is attributed to the extreme values published after the analyses of the hipparcos data on cepheids ( feast & catchpole 1997 ) and to the application of the red clump stars of the lmc through the same type of galactic stars calibrated by hipparcos ( stanek et al . 2000 ) . along this line , there seems to exist a general belief that cepheids yield usually longer distances ( distance moduli of about @xmath3  mag and above ) , whereas rr  lyrae stars give shorter ones ( @xmath4  mag ) .",
    "this latter belief is based on statistical parallaxes ( popowski & gould 1998 ) , baade - wesselink ( bw ) analyses ( see clementini et al .",
    "1995 , and references therein , hereafter c95 ) and the application of the hipparcos data ( fernley et al .",
    "1998 ; see however groenewegen & salaris 1999 ) .",
    "it is important to note that distances derived from the statistical parallax method employ rather small sample of stars ( @xmath5 objects ) , whereas the hipparcos parallaxes for rr  lyrae stars are very inaccurate . actually , more precise hst parallaxes yield distances in good agreement with the `` canonical '' lmc value of @xmath3  mag derived from both prototype variables rr  lyr and @xmath6  cep ( benedict et al .",
    "2002a , b ) .",
    "it is also important to mention that all results based on the pulsation analyses of double - mode variables ( rr  lyrae , cepheids , both fundamental & first overtone and first overtone & second overtone ones ) give basically the canonical value for the lmc distance ( see kovcs 2002 and references therein ) .    in the light of the above ,",
    "it is important to address the question of consistency between the bw analyses of cepheids and rr  lyrae stars .",
    "previous works have been performed by different groups of researchers , often using different bw parameters ( e.g. , @xmath7 factors , the ratio of the observed and surface radial velocities ) and effective temperature relations ( surface brightness for cepheids ",
    "e.g. , laney & stobie 1994 , stellar atmosphere models for rr  lyrae stars ",
    "e.g. , liu & janes 1990 ) .",
    "in addition , there is a role of the somewhat delicate nature of the numerical method employed in the actual implementation of the bw analysis ( e.g. , computation of the surface acceleration ) .",
    "therefore , we decided to visit the problem by using the same bw algorithm for both groups of stars . in order to compute the lmc distance modulus ,",
    "the derived absolute magnitudes will be used in conjunction with currently published period - luminosity - color ( plc ) relations ( udalski et al .",
    "1999 ; kovcs & walker 2001 , hereafter u99 and kw01 , respectively ) .",
    "here we basically follow the standard methodology of the bw analysis as usually implemented in rr  lyrae studies ( e.g. , liu & janes 1990 ) . in brief",
    ", we use the observed @xmath8 light , @xmath9 color and @xmath10 radial velocity curves to compute the luminosity ( @xmath11 ) , effective temperature ( @xmath12 ) and radius ( @xmath13 ) variations . for any assumed value of the equilibrium test radius",
    "@xmath14 we compute the following quantities :    * _ temporal radius : _ * * @xmath15 , * * @xmath16d\\tau$ ] , * * @xmath17 , + where @xmath18 denotes the period , @xmath7 is the velocity projection factor , that we assume to be constant and set equal to @xmath19 .",
    "( we note that gieren , fouqu & gmez 1997 used a period - dependent @xmath7 factor .",
    "their values span the range of 1.351.37 in the period regime of our sample .",
    "the effect of using lower @xmath7 is minute , because an increase of @xmath20 in @xmath7 yields an absolute magnitude that is brighter only by @xmath20  mag . ) * _ temporal @xmath12 : _ * * @xmath21 } , \\log g]$ ] , + where @xmath22 $ ] denotes the interpolation polynomial of the stellar atmosphere models of castelli , gratton & kurucz ( 1997 ) with the zero point determined by the scale of blackwell & lynas - gray , ( 1994 ) ( hereafter blg94 ) .",
    "the models have been computed without convective overshooting .",
    "the microturbulent velocity has been fixed at 2  kms@xmath23 .",
    "the distribution of heavy elements follows that of the sun . in order to find the temperature zero point offset between the model values of castelli et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and the ones given by the infrared flux method of blg94 , the compilation of the observational data on non - variable stars by c95 is used .",
    "we get @xmath24(model)@xmath25(blg94)@xmath26 . +",
    "it is interesting to compare this temperature scale with the one implied by the surface brightness ( sb ) method of fouqu & gieren ( 1997 ) . rewriting their formula given for the apparent angular diameter , we get @xmath27 . by using the above mentioned compilation of c95",
    ", we get an average difference of @xmath24(sb)@xmath25(model & blg94)@xmath28 . by performing the same test on the bw samples ( see table  1 ) , the differences are positive , but less than @xmath29 for cepheids . for rr  lyrae stars , the differences are even smaller , with changing signs .",
    "the larger negative difference on the sample of c95 is due in part to the larger weight of the higher temperature stars . in conclusion",
    ", we may state that the present temperature scale in the temperature range of interest is very similar to the ones used in earlier bw studies of cepheids .",
    "+ for rr  lyrae stars , the iron abundance [ fe / h ] is computed from the fourier decompositions of the @xmath8 light curves as given by jurcsik & kovcs ( 1996 ) . for cepheids , we set [ fe / h]@xmath300 , which seems to be a reasonable first approximation ( see luck et al .",
    "2003 for the metallicity distribution of cepheids ) .",
    "the temporal gravity @xmath31 is computed by @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the gravitational constant , @xmath34 is the stellar mass , which is fixed at @xmath35 and @xmath36 for rr  lyrae stars and cepheids , respectively .",
    "since the contribution of @xmath37 to @xmath24 is relatively small when the @xmath9 color index is used , the exact value of @xmath34 is not crucial . in principle",
    ", we can compute a consistent value for @xmath34 by using the pulsation equation ( e.g. , van albada & baker 1973 ) .",
    "however , both the weak dependence of @xmath24 on @xmath37 , and the difference between the equilibrium and static stellar parameters ( see bono , caputo & stellingwerf 1995 ) make this procedure less straightforward and therefore , is left for the task of future studies .",
    "the dereddened color index @xmath38 is computed from the observed one by using @xmath39 reddening values either as given in the galactic cepheid database of the david dunlap observatory or by the corresponding formula of kw01 for rr  lyrae stars .",
    "because of the large reddenings of the galactic cepheids , we use the formulae for selective absorption ratios as given by the bw studies of cepheids ( see , e.g. , gieren , fouqu & gmez 1998 ) : * * @xmath40 , * * @xmath41 , * * @xmath42 , * * @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , + where the @xmath46 and @xmath47 colors are in the kron - cousins and standard johnson systems , respectively . for compatibility , these reddening relations are used also for rr  lyrae stars . *",
    "_ temporal absolute @xmath8 magnitude : _ * * @xmath48},\\log g)$ ] , * * @xmath49 , + where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the solar values . the latter one and the solar bolometric magnitude @xmath52",
    "are set equal to @xmath53  k and @xmath54  mag , respectively .",
    "the temporal bolometric correction @xmath55 is computed from stellar atmosphere models in the same way as @xmath24 above .",
    "the zero point of @xmath55 is set to a value which yields @xmath56 . * _ point - by - point and average distance moduli : _ * * @xmath57 , * * @xmath58 , * * @xmath59 ^ 2 $ ] , + where @xmath60 is the number of data points on the light curve .",
    "the best fit is obtained at the test radius @xmath14 which yields the smallest @xmath61 .",
    "usually the fits are fairly accurate , with @xmath62@xmath63 .",
    "it is also worth mentioning the following technical details :    * when straightforward fourier fitting does not work , smooth light and velocity curves are obtained through fourier decompositions of the high order polynomials fitted by least squares to the observed data points of the folded light curves . *",
    "tables of stellar atmosphere models are employed through quadratic interpolation . *",
    "all pulsation phases are used , including also the possibly shock - disturbed quick expansion phase . * in spite of the careful treatment of the numerical derivation of the radial velocity curve , the total gravitational acceleration occasionally reaches values which lie outside the tabulated values . in these brief moments of pulsation the closest extreme values as given in the tables are used .",
    "the same method is employed for filtering out the non - tabulated values of @xmath12 .",
    "we note that these out - of - range errors occur almost always out of the minimum of @xmath61 , where the assumed unphysical stellar radius further enhances the numerical problems related to @xmath37 .",
    "once the optimum equilibrium stellar parameters are computed by the above bw technique , we can evaluate the zero points of the corresponding plc relations . both for cepheids and for rr",
    "lyrae stars the plc relations have been derived from stellar populations different from the galactic bw samples . in the case of rr",
    "lyrae stars there is a reasonable large overlap between the metallicities of the present bw sample and the cluster variables used by kw01 to derive the empirical formula .",
    "therefore , we may assume that the formula may also be valid for most of the field variables used in the bw analysis .",
    "there is also a dispute on the possible metal dependence of the zero point of the cepheid plc relation .",
    "however , we think that there are more theoretical and empirical results which indicate the non - existence of such a dependence ( alibert et al . 1999 ; bono et al . 2002 ; turner & burke 2002 ) .    in the case of cepheids",
    "we need to evaluate @xmath64 in the following equation @xmath65 where @xmath66 denotes the kron - cousins colors , @xmath67 means intensity - averaged magnitudes .",
    "the above formula has been derived by u99 for lmc with @xmath68 . since the left - hand - side of eq .",
    "( 1 ) is reddening - free , the difference of @xmath64(lmc ) and the average of this constant for the bw stars will yield the true distance modulus for the lmc .",
    "the plc relation for the fundamental mode rr  lyrae stars is given by kw01 @xmath69 where the bars denote simple magnitude averages .",
    "the constant for lmc could be evaluated from the current @xmath8 , @xmath70 observations of fundamental mode rr  lyrae stars in the lmc by clementini et al .",
    "( 2003 , hereafter c03 ) . because they give intensity - averaged magnitudes , to retain compatibility with eq .",
    "( 2 ) , we transform these values to simple magnitude averages with the aid of the formulae of kovcs ( 2002 ) .",
    "the average of the @xmath71 fourier amplitude is set equal to @xmath72 , in accordance with the value obtained from the analysis of the rrab stars in the corresponding macho fields ( alcock et al .",
    "2003 ) . in this way",
    "we get @xmath73 and @xmath74 . with the observed average @xmath18 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 of @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 , respectively ,",
    "we get @xmath80 . however , the average magnitudes computed by c03 for their two fields @xmath81 & @xmath70 differ by as much as @xmath82  mag in @xmath8 , and @xmath83  mag in @xmath70 .",
    "they attribute this difference to the effect of differential extinction .",
    "we checked this difference by computing the averages in macho fields # 6 & # 13 , overlapping with fields @xmath81 & @xmath70 of c03 . with a @xmath84 clipping we got @xmath85 ( field # 6 , 317 stars ) and @xmath86 ( field # 13 , 262 stars ) . with these small standard deviations of the means",
    ", we can state that a difference in the order of @xmath87  mag is not probable between the two fields .    in order to get another estimate on @xmath88 for the lmc , we use the data of soszyski et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , which cover a large sample of rr  lyrae stars of the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) from the ogle database . by proceeding as above , from their average magnitudes and period of @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 ,",
    "we get @xmath94 and @xmath95 , depending on whether reddened or dereddened magnitudes are used .",
    "although eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) should , in principle be reddening - free , the above difference shows that the field - by - field reddening corrections applied by soszyski et al .",
    "( 2002 ) may not be completely consistent with our standard extinction ratio . since the method of their differential reddening correction",
    "has already proved to be successful ( at least in statistical sense , see u99 ) , we adopt the value obtained by the use of their dereddened magnitudes . in computing the value of @xmath88 for the lmc , we have to subtract the relative distance modulus between the lmc and smc . from the plc relations derived for cepheids in the two clouds , u99 got a difference of @xmath96  mag , which , with the above preliminaries , yields our finally adopted value of @xmath97 for the lmc .",
    "the necessary data on rr  lyrae stars have been gathered from the literature during our earlier investigations ( see kw01 and also c95 , for a full list of variables subjected to bw analyses in earlier studies ) . for cepheids we turned to the database of the mcmaster university and also to the radial velocity database of the moscow university ( see gorynya et al . 1998 ) .",
    "we utilized only the best data available on fundamental mode variables . when it was necessary , the cepheid @xmath46 light curves published in the johnson system were transformed to the kron - cousins system with the aid of the formula given by caldwell & coulson ( 1987 ) .",
    "occasionally , periods have been improved by using the program package mufran ( see kollth 1990 ) .",
    "the variables used in the present study together with their derived physical parameters are given in table  1 .",
    "( effective temperatures have been computed from the cycle - averaged @xmath9 and @xmath37 values . )",
    "three rr  lyrae stars ( w  crt , ss  leo and av  peg ) have been excluded from the above sample in the subsequent analysis , because of their discrepant positions in the plc relation . for similar reasons , we also excluded x  lac from the cepheid sample .",

    "we recall that the corresponding empirical values are @xmath279 and @xmath280 ( see kw01 and u99 ) .",

    "although these true distance moduli are magically close to each other , we have to keep in mind that they both have a statistical errors of @xmath283  mag .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear that the often cited @xmath284@xmath285  mag difference between the bw distances derived from the two groups of variables no longer exists .",

    "this considerable difference results in a proper shift in the rr  lyrae distance modulus and leads to a result which is consistent with the one derived from cepheids .",
    "the fact that gieren et al .",
    "( 1998 ) derives a @xmath292  mag lower distance for the lmc , in spite of the same average luminosity , is suspected to be caused by the difference between the plc we use and the pl they employ to compute the lmc distance .",
    "we find also a good agreement if we compare our radii with those of gieren et al .",
    "for the 18 common variables we get an average difference ( ours - theirs ) of @xmath293  @xmath50 with @xmath294  @xmath50 . in terms of the relative radii",
    "these figures become @xmath295% and @xmath296% , respectively .",
    "we can also make a comparison with the results of long - baseline interferometric measurements for cepheids .",
    "for the two variables @xmath6  cep and @xmath179  aql common with the samples of nordgren et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and lane , greech - eakman & nordgren ( 2002 ) , we find a rather close agreement between the radii . by applying the necessary corrections due to the different @xmath7 factors , from the interferometric / radial velocity results we obtain the radii of @xmath297 and @xmath298 for @xmath6  cep and @xmath179  aql , respectively .",
    "these values are very close to our corresponding figures ( see table  1 ) .",
    "it is important to note that although all direct estimates based on double - mode variables yield lmc distance modulus in agreement with the present result ( kovcs 2002 ) , the indirect distances derived from globular cluster double - mode rr  lyrae ( rrd ) stars become higher by @xmath299  mag , if we use the same plc for the lmc as in the present paper .",
    "nevertheless , these revised distance moduli computed from the rrd populations of m15 , m68 and ic4499 are still in the range of @xmath300@xmath301 , which range is consistent with the value based on the present bw analysis .",
    "we mention the recent effort of cacciari et al .",
    "( 2000 ) in revisiting the bw analysis of rr  lyrae stars with updated physics . from their analysis of two stars they concluded that the derived luminosities were in agreement with the earlier results ( meaning the continuance of the old discrepancy , however ,",
    "see c03 for a different conclusion from the same work ) .",
    "we have shown that by using exactly the same method and baade - wesselink parameters ( e.g. , velocity projection factor ) , fundamental mode rr  lyrae and cepheid variables yield the same distance modulus for the large magellanic cloud .",
    "this is in variance with the earlier common belief that the two groups of stars lead to significantly different distance estimates for the lmc .",
    "the higher luminosity obtained for the rr  lyrae stars in the present study is attributed to : ( a ) the more accurate consideration of phase - dependent bolometric correction , ( b ) the more precise computation of the temporal gravity , ( c ) the better numerical treatment of both the grids of stellar atmosphere models and the observed light and velocity curves .",
    "the good agreement between the cepheid luminosities obtained in this and in the earlier works suggests that the above conditions have already been met in those studies .",
    "although clarification of important theoretical problems ( such as the accurate conversion of the projected velocity to the photospheric value , or the application of dynamical atmosphere models rather than static ones ) are still needed , and better agreement between various photometric data on lmc is still demanded , we think that the present result is encouraging and indicates the possibility of making progress either by increasing the sample size by more precise data , or by building dynamical atmosphere models .",
    "we are grateful to fiorella castelli for consulting on the stellar atmosphere models and to andrzej udalski for clarifying notation in the plc relation .",

    "<S> by using the same algorithm in the baade - wesselink analyses of galactic rr  lyrae and cepheid variables , it is shown that , within @xmath0  mag @xmath1 statistical error , they yield the same distance modulus for the large magellanic cloud . by fixing the zero point of the color  temperature calibration to those of the current infrared flux methods and using updated period  luminosity  color relations , we get an average value of @xmath2 for the true distance modulus of the lmc .    </S>",
