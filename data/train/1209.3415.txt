    "the deceleration parameter , defined as @xmath5 , is a key quantity in describing the evolution of the homogeneous and isotropic universe .",
    "its importance lies in the fact that it tells us the rate at which the universe accelerates or decelerates its expansion .",
    "( here and throughout @xmath6 denotes the hubble function , and @xmath7 the scale factor of the friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) metric ) .",
    "unfortunately , at present measurements of @xmath1 suffer from non - small uncertainties that quickly grow with redshift ( @xmath8 with @xmath9 ) , though it is virtually certain that the universe is accelerating nowadays , i.e. , that @xmath10 ( the zero subscript means present time ) .",
    "expressions of @xmath0 provided by cosmological models are of not much help either because none of them rests on sufficiently convincing theoretical grounds .",
    "it is to be hoped that things will eventually turn for the better when a successful theory of quantum gravity is in place , though it may well take a long while .",
    "nevertheless , on the observational side the situation may improve comparatively soon given the variety and range of ongoing and planned major ambitious projects that involve bigger telescopes and advanced techniques -for a short review and a comprehensive list of references see  @xmath11 of @xcite . in view of the above , it seems reasonable to propose parametrized expressions of @xmath0 based not in any specific cosmological model but on practical and empirical reasons that lessen their wide latitude .",
    "they can be useful while we patiently wait for a theoretically sound model backed by observation at all scales .    thus far ,",
    "different parametrizations , such as @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and more complex than these , have been considered in the literature to reconstruct @xmath0 from observational data ( see e.g. @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "however , the first parametrization is adequate for @xmath17 only and the others are unsuitable to predict the behavior of the deceleration parameter in the far future ; in particular , they diverge as @xmath18 .",
    "parametrizations whose intended range of validity includes the far future are necessarily more involved and usually contain three or four free parameters @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we propose three model independent parametrizations , with just two free parameters , valid from the matter dominated epoch ( @xmath19 ) onwards ( i.e. , up to @xmath20 ) , based on practical and theoretical reasons and independent of any cosmological model . by construction",
    "they obey the asymptotic conditions , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and a further condition , @xmath21 , which is valid at least when @xmath22 .",
    "the first condition expresses the conviction that at sufficiently high redshift the universe was matter dominated ( otherwise it would be very hard to account for the observed cosmic structures ) . at first sight ,",
    "the other conditions are less compelling .",
    "as explained below , they are based on the second law of thermodynamics when account is made of the entropy of the apparent horizon .",
    "usually one parametrizes a function in any specific interval by interpolating it between two given points ( one at either end of the interval ) , modulo one first knows the value taken by the function at these two points . in actual fact , the parametrizations of @xmath0 proposed so far have just one fixed point : the asymptotic value at high redshift ( @xmath1 must converge to @xmath23 when @xmath19 ) . the other , @xmath24 , is not in reality a fixed point because the value of the deceleration parameter at @xmath25 is not very well known and therefore left free .",
    "the parametrizations proposed in this paper have two fixed points , one at the far past ( @xmath26 ) , and other at the far future ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the second fixed point conforms to the thermodynamical constraints imposed by the second law .",
    "we believe this means a clear advantage over previous parametrizations of @xmath0 , with just one fixed point . while it can be found in the literature parameterizations that also fix @xmath1 at @xmath20 they do so arbitrarily , i.e. , not grounded on sound physics .",
    "the aim of this paper is to propose three model - independent parametrizations of @xmath0 , from @xmath19 up to @xmath20 , that comply with the second law of thermodynamics and constrain their two free parameters with recent observational data .",
    "as it turns out , all of them predict that the present stage of accelerated expansion will never slow down and are consistent with the spatially flat @xmath28cdm model .",
    "section [ sec : thermo ] considers the properties the deceleration parameter must observe assuming the universe obeys the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "put otherwise if , in the long run , it tends to an equilibrium state , i.e. , of maximum entropy .",
    "section [ sec : statistics ] presents the statistical tools , to be employed later , that make use of observational data from supernovae type ia ( 557 data points ) , baryon acoustic oscillations combined with cosmic microwave background ( bao / cmb ) ( 7 data points ) , and the history of the hubble factor ( 24 data points ) .",
    "section [ sec : parm ] presents the three parametrizations , constrain them with the observational data , and discuss them .",
    "finally , section [ sec : remarks ] summarizes our work and introduces some final remarks .",
    "as is well known , physical systems tend spontaneously to some equilibrium state compatible with the constraints imposed on them .",
    "this summarizes the empirical basis of the second law of thermodynamics . very briefly",
    ", this law establishes that isolated , macroscopic systems , evolve to the maximum entropy state consistent with their constraints @xcite .",
    "as a consequence their entropy , @xmath29 , can not decrease at any time , i.e. , @xmath30 .",
    "further , in the last phase of the evolution @xmath29 has to be a convex function of the said variable , @xmath31 .    arguably , the entropy of friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) universes is dominated by the entropy of the causal horizon , at least at late times -see e.g. @xcite . as causal horizon",
    "we shall take the apparent horizon , the marginally trapped surface with vanishing expansion of radius @xmath32 @xcite , where @xmath33 denotes the spatial curvature index .",
    "interestingly enough , it has been shown that this horizon represents the appropriate thermodynamic boundary surface @xcite .",
    "leaving aside possible quantum corrections its entropy results proportional to area of the latter ( @xmath34 ) @xcite , @xmath35 therefore , so long as we can ignore the entropy within the horizon , the second law of thermodynamics imposes @xmath36 , at any time , as well as @xmath37 at late times -the prime meaning derivative with respect to the scale factor .",
    "both conditions are to be fulfilled if the flrw universe is to tend to thermodynamic equilibrium at late times @xcite .    bearing in mind the definition of the deceleration parameter , for spatially flat ( @xmath38 ) flrw universes we can write @xmath39 \\ , .",
    "\\label{aprimes}\\ ] ] the first equation implies @xmath40 .",
    "inspection of the second one reveals that when @xmath41 the middle term in the square parenthesis dominates .",
    "thereby , @xmath42 in that limit .",
    "thus , for the universe to tend to thermodynamic equilibrium at late times we must have @xmath43 and @xmath21 as @xmath18 .",
    "this section outlines the use of the observational data to fit the parametrizations of the deceleration parameter , @xmath0 .",
    "since the likelihood function is defined by @xmath44 the best fit to the data follows from minimizing the sum @xmath45 .",
    "as detailed below , the best fit values of the parameters can be obtained by contrasting the proposed parametrizations with the empirical data mentioned above and minimizing the @xmath46 by means of the markov chain monte carlo method .",
    "we compare the theoretical distance modulus @xmath47 where @xmath48 , with the observed distance modulus @xmath49 of the 557 supernovae type ia assembled in the union2 compilation @xcite .",
    "the latter data set is substantially richer than previous sn ia compilations and presents other advantages ; mainly , the refitting of all light curves with the salt2 fitter and an upgraded control of systematic errors . in ( [ modulus ] ) @xmath50 is the hubble - free luminosity distance , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 . here and throughout ,",
    "@xmath53 and @xmath54 denote the free parameters occurring in the parametrizations presented below in section iv ; @xmath55 is the hubble constant and @xmath56 its value in units of @xmath57 km / s / mpc .",

    "baryon acoustic oscillations can be traced to pressure waves at the recombination epoch generated by cosmological perturbations in the primeval baryon - photon plasma .",
    "they have been revealed by a distinct peak in the large scale correlation function measured from the luminous red galaxies sample of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) : at @xmath66 @xcite , as well as in the two degree field galaxy redshift survey at @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "more recently other peaks have been observed : at @xmath68 ( with the sdss @xcite ) , at @xmath69 ( in the six degree field galaxy redshift survey @xcite ) , and at @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 ( by the wigglez team @xcite ) .    from each peak the ratio of the comoving sound horizon @xmath73 at decoupling ( @xmath74 ) and at the drag epoch ( @xmath75 ) , the epoch at which the acoustic oscillations are frozen in , can be measured . here",
    "@xmath76 is the speed of sound .",
    "likewise , at each peak , a characteristic distance scale , the dilation scale @xmath77^{\\frac{1}{3 } } \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath78 is the comoving angular distance , can also be determined . to compute the drag epoch redshift we use the formula @xmath79 of eisenstein and hu in @xcite and get @xmath80 .",
    "multiplying the ratio , @xmath81 , taken from the bao peaks by the acoustic scale @xmath82 we get @xmath83 at each redshift of the seven bao data . here",
    "we use the value for @xmath84 derived from wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap)7-years data , namely , @xmath85 @xcite . if we also use the value of the ratio of sound horizon at the drag epoch and at recombination ( redshift @xmath86 ) , computed from the values reported in @xcite @xmath87 we obtain the new estimator @xmath88 , shown in table [ tab : baocmb ] , as done in @xcite . using this estimator",
    ", the dependence in the sound horizons at decoupling and the drag epoch is suppressed .",
    "thus we just use the ratio between them , which is almost model independent .",
    "this follows because both redshifts are rather close and the sound horizon at decoupling and drag essentially depend on the fractional difference between the number of photons and baryons @xcite .",
    ".values of @xmath81 ( reported in @xcite ) and the derived ratio @xmath88 . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     a direct and model - independent determination of @xmath0 in the redshift interval @xmath89 was carried out by daly and coworkers @xcite who applied the expression @xcite @xmath90 \\label{eq : q(z)daly}\\ ] ] to the 192 sn i data points of davis _ et al .",

    "figure [ fig : daly ] shows the best fit graphs of @xmath0 of each parametrization superimposed to experimental results of daly _ et al .",
    "as it is seen , these lines fall within the @xmath94 region of @xmath0 as determined in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "c    one may ask as to what extent the imposing of the thermodynamic - based , far future , constraint @xmath95 biases the parametrizations toward the @xmath28cdm model .",
    "we have studied this by letting the value of @xmath96 as an additional free - parameter and fitting it using solely the observational data .",
    "the results are : @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 for parametrizations i , ii and iii , respectively . except for the second one ,",
    "the quintessence cold dark matter ( cdm ) model is somewhat preferred but , in all the cases , the physically motivated choice @xmath3 results compatible within @xmath100 .",
    "the drawback of letting @xmath96 free , aside from violating thermodynamics , is that the other two free - parameters present a wide degeneracy .",
    "likewise , the derived values for the hubble constant ( first row in table [ tab : hoqoz ] ) differ from the recently obtained by riess et al .",
    ", @xmath101 km / s / mpc , @xcite , who used @xmath102 cepheids variables at @xmath103 , by about @xmath104 ( but they all agree with the latter at @xmath100 ) .",
    "we have considered this by repeating the analysis of subsection iiic but this time leaving aside the mentioned value of riess et al .",
    "the results now are : @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 km / s / mpc for parametrizations i , ii and iii , respectively .",
    "thus , both sets of results are essentially coincident ( they differ by less than @xmath108 ) .",
    "they also agree very well with the hubble constant value observationally derived by komatsu et al .",
    ", @xmath109 km / s / mpc @xcite , using wmap 7-year data .",
    "so , while there is a significant difference between the hubble constant value of riess et al . and ours , it is not a substantial one ; after all , they agree at @xmath100 confidence level . at any rate ,",
    "the root of the discrepancy may be rightly traced at the difference in methods employed . while riess et al .",
    "essentially used astrophysical data , we ( as well as komatsu et al . ) resorted to cosmological data instead .",
    "in this paper we proposed three different two - parameter parametrizations of @xmath0 valid from the matter era @xmath110 up to the infinite future ( @xmath111 ) , modulo @xmath112 .",
    "these rest in the following hypotheses : @xmath113 at cosmological scales the universe is homogeneous and isotropic , thereby well described by the flrw metric ; @xmath114 in the matter dominated era @xmath115 ; @xmath116 at least at late times the entropy of the universe is dominated by the entropy of the apparent horizon . the second an third hypotheses furnish two fixed points ( at @xmath19 and @xmath117 , respectively ) , thereby drastically reducing the ample latitude one faces in parameterizing @xmath0 . by smoothly interpolating between these two points",
    "one can obtain useful parametrizations , but with shrunk arbitrariness .",
    "except for the existence of a matter dominated era at early times , the parametrizations are independent on any specific cosmological model ; and , on the other hand , they are flexible enough to accommodate many homogeneous and isotropic models .",
    "we constrained the free parameters with the latest observational data ( sn ia , bao , cmb , and @xmath118 ) . accordingly",
    "if to accommodate a given cosmological model the free parameters , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , in the three parametrizations should take values widely apart from their respective best fits ( which are consistent within @xmath94 with the flat @xmath28cdm model ) , we may confidently discard the said model .",
    "thermodynamics in spatially flat ( @xmath38 ) flrw universes demands that @xmath3 .",
    "this provides us with an additional and very useful fixed point to parametrize @xmath0 in a model independent manner .",
    "note that in the absence of a physically - based guidance to figure out the value of the deceleration parameter at @xmath20 one is led to choose some or other random value .",
    "by contrast , in our case we have taken @xmath119 on solid thermodynamic grounds .",
    "albeit we have considered just the particular set of spatially flat flrw universes , it is not a big restriction at all . indeed , recalling that in the case of non - flat metrics the area of the apparent horizon is given by eq .",
    "( [ sa ] ) it follows that @xmath120 $ ] .",
    "when @xmath41 and @xmath121 , the last term on the right hand side is necessarily subdominant otherwise one would have @xmath122 , contrary to the second law . hence the condition @xmath123 in that limit",
    "reduces to the one in flat space , namely , @xmath40 . in the positively curved case , and",
    "again in the same limit , one can assume that @xmath124 , @xmath125 being some real number .",
    "as it can be straightforwardly checked , the aforementioned last term results , once more , subdominant provided that @xmath126 which is the case of most realistic cosmologies .",
    "thus , @xmath127 is an asymptotic fixed point not only for spatially flat universes but also for open universes and for a rather ample set of closed universes .",
    "our results suggest that from the era of matter domination onward @xmath1 decreases monotonously with expansion ( i.e. , @xmath21 ) , the transition deceleration acceleration occurred at a redshift of about @xmath128 , and that @xmath129 .",
    "they do not support recent claims that the cosmic expansion is today reverting to a decelerated phase ( i.e. , that @xmath130 ) @xcite , @xcite-@xcite . on the contrary , they show overall consistency with the findings of @xcite-@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , as well as with those of serra _ et al . , _",
    "the latter authors showed that the equation of state of dark energy has not varied noticeably in the redshift interval @xmath89 .",
