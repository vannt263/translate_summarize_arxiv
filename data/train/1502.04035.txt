    "[ fig - quenched - eb - higher]a . at small domain size @xmath65 the non - ergodic properties of the standard hdps",
    "are masked by the noise in the stratified spatial domains .    for superdiffusive hdps",
    "the particles tend to localize in the center of each domain , while for subdiffusive values @xmath10 they tend to spread towards regions of low diffusivity near the domain borders .",
    "in the long time limit the particles spread over many domains , establishing the shape of the probability density function @xmath18 presented in fig .",
    "[ fig - quenched - pdf ] .",
    "the local minima and maxima of @xmath18 correspond to the regions of low and fast diffusivity @xmath5 , respectively , see figs .",
    "[ fig - diff - coeff]c , d and [ fig - quenched - pdf ] . for relatively large domain size @xmath65 the probability density function of the noisy hdps",
    "becomes dominated by the contribution from the seed domain .",
    "the spreading of particles over superdiffusive hdp domains in the long time limit is symmetric and nearly gaussian , @xmath117 with the effective diffusivity @xmath118 . the mean particle displacement with respect to the center of the seed domain vanishes , @xmath119 .",
    "to compute @xmath118 analytically a homogenization procedure and generic concepts of diffusion in random and highly heterogeneous media would need to be applied @xcite .",
    "subdiffusive noisy hdps in the quenched scenario share a number of trends with the above descriptions of the cases @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "in particular , as the domain size @xmath65 decreases , the amplitude spread of individual time averaged msd traces @xmath77 decreases ( fig .",
    "[ fig - quenched - tamsd - spread]d , e ) .",
    "because of the sublinear scaling of the ensemble msd of the normal subdiffusive hdps ( @xmath10 ) the ensemble averaged msd approaches the time averaged msd @xmath122 from above",
    ". moreover , the scaling of the ensemble averaged msd of subdiffusive noisy hdps with quenched disorder turns from subdiffusive to brownian as the domain size @xmath65 decreases .",
    "the physical reason for this crossover behavior is the random character of hops between domains with a varying local exponent @xmath1 .",
    "we find that , similarly to superdiffusive noisy hdps , the ensemble averaged msd initially follows the scaling ( [ msd ] ) of normal hdps while at later times a nearly linear scaling is observed . for smaller periodicities @xmath65",
    "the linear scaling becomes dominant , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig - quenched - tamsd - spread]e from left to right .",
    "the probability density function of quenched noisy hdps in the long time limit is a combination of the superimposed local probability densities of the standard hdp . for large periodicities @xmath65",
    "the probability density function is again dominated by the contribution from the seed domain , as can be seen in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig - quenched - pdf]b .",
    "similar to superdiffusive noisy hdps we find that the time averaged msd is linear in the lag time , @xmath123 , while the amplitude spread of individual time averaged msds grows with the noise strength @xmath59 and becomes diminished for smaller medium periodicities @xmath65 .",
    "we also see that for subdiffusive noisy hdps the saturation of the ergodicity breaking parameter to the values of normal hdps occurs at much smaller values of @xmath65 as compared to superdiffusive noisy hdps ( fig .",
    "[ fig - quenched - eb - higher]a ) .",
    "we studied a stochastic process based on a combination of heterogeneous diffusion processes with multiplicative noise and additional disorder of the environment , distinguishing annealed and quenched scenarios .",
    "the environment was assumed to be structured into periodic domains of given periodicity .",
    "we investigated the diffusive and ergodic properties of these noisy heterogeneous diffusion processes .",
    "the superposition of the additional stochasticity onto the standard hdp with its deterministic variation of the diffusivity revealed a variety of new features , the scaling relations for the ensemble and time averaged msd of the noisy hdps being dramatically altered as compared to the normal hdp behavior .    for annealed disorder , the scaling exponent @xmath1 of the diffusivity profile switches in time and the gradient field of the particle diffusivity has a single origin at @xmath52 .",
    "we demonstrated how the gaussian spread @xmath57 of the scaling exponent gives rise to a strongly asymmetric scatter of individual time averaged msd traces .",
    "rapidly switching diffusivity profiles in such an annealed environment cause transient particle trapping in low - diffusivity regions . for superdiffusive motion",
    "the effects of the @xmath1 spread are more pronounced . in the case of a quenched environment ,",
    "a spatially stratified medium is modeled in terms of domains of width @xmath66 with a normal distribution of the local hdp exponent . upon particle diffusion ,",
    "the averaging is thus performed over ensembles of particle trajectories generated for different spatial distributions of the scaling exponents @xmath1 in the domains .",
    "one of the key findings is that for small periodicity @xmath65 the sub- and superdiffusive scaling of normal hdps cross over to a linear growth of the ensemble averaged msd as function of time .",
    "external noise thus progressively masks the statistics of the underlying hdp",
    ".    what could be the physical phenomena captured by the noisy hdp discussed here ? from a biological perspective , the diffusion of small molecules in assemblies of non - identical , interconnected cells is a relevant example .",
    "the cell - to - cell variations of the diffusivity are inherent to biological tissues , while every individual cell features a space dependent diffusivity in its cytoplasm @xcite . at cell - to - cell boundaries",
    "the diffusivity likely varies with a jump , as captured by our stratified model of the quenched disorder , with possibly discontinuous diffusivity across the system .",
    "we note that heterogeneous diffusivities can , for instance , play a role in the formation of gradients of morphogen molecules in a developing cell tissue @xcite , a process known to involve features of anomalous diffusion .",
    "it also features a division of fluxes of the molecules into fluxes through cells , across the outer cell membranes , and transport in extracellular spaces @xcite .",
    "heterogeneous diffusion of water molecules in brain tissues @xcite and strongly heterogeneous structures of cardiac muscle tissue with nontrivial cell - cell coupling @xcite could be another example .",
    "similarly , the domains in the noisy hdp could represent internal compartments in a single cell .",
    "the quenched case would correspond to static environments whereas the annealed scenario would stand for environments , which change rapidly compared to the typical crossing times between domains .",
    "our results for noisy hdps could also be useful for the description of nano - objects trapped in dynamical temperature fields @xcite and of particles in strong temperature gradients @xcite .",
    "another field of relevance is the tracer diffusion in heterogeneous assemblies of distributed obstacles @xcite mimicking features of the cell cytoplasm @xcite and diffusion on chemically and mesoscopically periodically patterned solid - liquid interfaces @xcite . on a macroscopic scale , water diffusion in subsurface hydrology applications is to be mentioned @xcite , as well as tracer motion in porous heterogeneous media @xcite . for the latter there",
    "likely exists a distance - dependent diffusivity within each pore constructing a network governing the diffusion of water and contaminants in soil specimen @xcite .",
    "finally , in statistical models of financial stock price variations @xcite the terms stochastic versus correlated volatility widely occur , representing the diffusivity in random walk models @xcite .",
    "some patterns of correlated or clustered volatility observed in financial data thus correspond to a systematically varying diffusivity in our model of quenched noisy hdps .",
    "some repeats of non - brownian up - and - down trends in stock price fluctuations @xcite can thus be considered as hdps repeatedly occurring in time .",
