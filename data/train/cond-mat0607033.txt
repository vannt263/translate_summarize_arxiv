    "f. bloch once argued that a persistent current might arise from the absence of the limit , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is an increase of the total energy when a momentum in one direction @xmath5 is increased by @xmath6.@xcite the momentum change @xmath6 is brought about by multiplying a function @xmath7 on the wave function @xmath8 as @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the coordinate of the center of gravity in the direction of @xmath5 .",
    "actually , the multiplied function is a wave function for the motion of the system as a whole .    in classical mechanics , the limit corresponding to eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) is given by @xmath11 which is zero at the minimum of the hamiltonian @xmath12 ; thus , a persistent current , @xmath13 , at the minimum is impossible .    according to bloch , however , in quantum mechanics , the limiting process in eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) may not be permissible because of the discreteness of the momentum .",
    "let us consider a system of @xmath14 electrons confined in a narrow loop of circumference @xmath15 , and take the @xmath16 coordinate along the loop .",
    "the single - valuedness requirement on @xmath7 after the increase of @xmath16 by @xmath15 demands that @xmath6 must be @xmath17 where @xmath18 is an integer . if @xmath15 is macroscopically large , @xmath6 is practically continuous , thus , a result similar to the classical one will be obtained . however ,",
    "if @xmath15 is a microscopic length ( for example , several atomic distance in a crystal ) , the discreteness is not negligible ; then a result different form the classical one may arise .",
    "the above argument suggests that a persistent current may arise in a system with cavity regions of microscopic sizes . in the present work",
    ", we deal with such a system , namely , a system composed of conduction electrons and small polarons with the condition that the hopping motion of the latter is much slower than that of the former , thus , the latter provide lattice spacing size cavities for the motion of the former .",
    "then , a macroscopic persistent current may be generated as a collection of circular currents around the small polarons .",
    "actually , for the persistent current generation , the existence of microscopic cavities is not enough .",
    "a condition that stabilizes a current carrying state over a currentless state is necessary .",
    "we will show that such a condition is provided if the conduction electrons form a background spin density wave ( sdw ) .",
    "thus , the system considered in this work is the inhomogeneous system composed of the conduction electrons that form an sdw background and the small polarons that provide microscopic cavities .",
    "the inhomogeneity considered in this work may be relevant to cuprate superconductors , where the parent compounds of the cuprate superconductors are half - filled insulators with an antiferromagnetic sdw - like correlation ; and doped holes are expected to form small polarons due to strong coulomb interaction and strong vibronic interaction.@xcite    when holes are doped in the cuprates , they are argued to become cores of merons ( vortices in the spin configuration with winding number @xmath0 ) or antimerons ( vortices in the spin configuration with winding number @xmath1 ) ; @xcite and the existence of such objects explains the peak splitting observed in the neutron scattering experiment very naturally .",
    "the formation of merons and antimerons around the small polarons is the key phenomenon that leads to the appearance of a persistent current , which will be shown by employing a mean field approximation that leads to an sdw state in a hubbard model .",
    "we will show that a spin current appears when the polarons become cores of merons and antimerons due to a spin berry phase from the spiral spin texture of the merons and antimerons . in this respect",
    "it is worth noting that dissipationless spin current generation was recently predicted and observed in systems with spin - orbit interaction,@xcite where the spin current is produced by a spin berry phase@xcite induced by spin - orbit interaction .    for the appearance of a persistent current , however , one more twist is necessary .",
    "although merons and antimerons generate a spin current , electric current is absent due to the exact cancellation of the up- and down - spin electron currents .",
    "this is an example of the so - called _ bloch s theorem _ which may be stated : `` the ground state of a time - reversal invariant hamiltonian is currentless '' .",
    "@xcite in the present work we argue that the bloch s theorem is circumvented through the fact that states with merons and antimerons are stabilized by an _",
    "imaginary _ magnetic flux that `` _ negates _ '' the fictitious magnetic flux from the berry phase ; namely , if a flux that counteracts the distructive interference of the wave function around each core of meron or antimeron caused by the spin berry phase ( note that the berry phase causes destructive interference due to @xmath19 flux through the cores ) , the total energy is significantly decreased .",
    "although the introduction of such an _ imaginary _ flux is artificial , it becomes a _",
    "one when the small polarons form side - by - side bipolarons ; this _ realization of the imaginary flux _ occurs because the vector potential for the imaginary flux which is written as @xmath20 ( @xmath21 is electron charge and @xmath22 is an angle - variable with periodicity @xmath23 ) , can be transfered from the hamiltonian to a phase factor on the wave function written as @xmath24 , where @xmath14 is the total number of electrons and @xmath25 is the coordinate of the @xmath26th electron . in other words ,",
    "the bloch s theorem is circumvented by the spontaneous generation of the motion of the system as a whole given by a wave function @xmath24 by itself . note that this current carrying state has a partner state that is connected by the time - reversal operation ; thus , the stability of the persistent current state depends on the tunneling life time to the partner state through the energy barrier between them .",
    "an interesting effect is predicted for the above current carrying state if the bipolarons move ; such a collective mode will give rise to a time - dependence of @xmath22 .",
    "since time variation of a phase of a wave function gives rise to a chemical potential shift,@xcite which for charged particles means an appearance of an electrostatic potential whose electric field is given by @xmath27 .",
    "then , the nernst effect is expected by the thermal diffusion of the bipolaronic cores of merons and antimerons .",
    "this may explain the anomalously large nernst signals observed in the pseudogap phase of the cuprates.@xcite    as will be shown later , the present model also gives qualitative explanations for the appearance of the drude - like peak in the optical conductivity measurement and the fermi arc observed in the angle - resolved photoemission spectra in the cuprates ; and suggests the appearance of the phase variable or `` nambu - goldstone '' mode for the superconductivity without the breakdown of the global @xmath2 gauge invariance in the cuprates .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in the next section we discuss merons and antimerons embedded in a spin density wave background in a two dimensional square lattice using a hubbard model . in section iii , it will be shown that a berry phase arises from the spin rotation of conduction electrons in the spiral spin texture of merons and antimerons , and generates a spin current . in section iv",
    ", we will add an imaginary magnetic flux that negates the fictitious magnetic flux from the spin berry phase , and show that such a flux significantly lowers the total energy of the state with merons and antimerons . in section",
    "v , we point out that imaginary flux added in section iv becomes a real one when side - by - side bipolarons are formed . in this case",
    ", the flux arises spontaneously from a wave function for the system as a whole , and circular electric currents around the bipolarons are produced .",
    "the appearance of the drude weight is also expected in such a situation . in section",
    "vi , we discuss the appearance of large nernst signals by the flow of bipolarons .",
    "lastly , in section vii , the relevance and implications of the present results in cuprate superconductivity are discussed .",

    "we employ a mean field approximation that gives rise to a spin density wave ( sdw ) ordered electronic state with spin polarization in the @xmath16-@xmath33 plane .",

    "@xcite    when holes are doped , we assume that they become small polarons due to strong electron - phonon interaction and the strong coulomb interaction , which seems to be relevant to the cuprates.@xcite further , we add the condition that the hopping motion of the polarons is so slow that polarons can be treated as static objects . in this situation , a part of the small polaron effects can be taken into account simply by setting the transfer integrals from and to polaron sites to zero .",
    "we will use this _ static approximation _ in the following .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the site energy for the polaron occupied site is such that the small polaron formation is energetically favorable ; i.e. , the polaron level is above the upper edge of the filled lower band .",

    "similarly , in an average sense , we denote the velocity of the flow by @xmath194 , and use @xmath195 as the average time duration for the movement of a bipolaron from @xmath191 to @xmath192 .    then , the voltage measured in the nernst experiment is calculated as @xmath196 where @xmath197 is the difference of the numbers for diamagnetic circular current cores ( @xmath198 ) and paramagnetic circular current cores ( @xmath199 ) of polarons , @xmath200 .",

    "finally , the electric field produced is calculated as @xmath201 where @xmath202 is the surface density of @xmath197 given by @xmath203 .",
    "since a loop current gives rise to a magnetic moment , circular currents around the bipolarons produce magnetization perpendicular to the two dimensional plane .",
    "if we assume that each meron or antimeron core in a bipolaron contributes to roughly the same magnetic moment , eq .",
    "( [ eq : nernst ] ) indicates that the nernst signal is roughly proportional to the magnetization .",
    "actually , the nernst signal proportional to the magnetization has been observed in the pseudogap phase of the cuprate superconductors.@xcite",
    "in this section , we shall discuss the relevance and implications of the present work in the cuprate superconductivity .",
    "we have been dealing with the inhomogeneous system composed of conduction electrons and small polarons ; the former constitute a background sdw order , and the latter become embedded bipolaronic cores of merons and antimerons . for lightly doped cuprates , the strong evidence of polaron formation exists;@xcite and the evidence of polaronic charge carriers also exits.@xcite    the single particle levels depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : levels ] show the splitting of the original band into the lower and upper hubbard bands , and between them are the in - gap states due to polarons . in the lightly doped cuprates ,",
    "the constant chemical potential with changing the hole concentration has been observed ; it is interpreted due to the presence of in - gap states that pin the fermi level.@xcite spectral weight transfer that appears to be between the in - gap states and the lower hubbard band has been observed .",
    "@xcite quite often , the charged stripes are argued to be responsible for the chemical potential pinning;@xcite and the splitting of peaks in the neutron scattering experiments has been taken as the evidence for the existence of them .",
    "@xcite in contrast to it the present work suggests that the chemical potential pinning is atributed to the small polaron formation ; those polarons form merons and antimerons around them and explain the neutron scattering peak splitting;@xcite thus , what has been considered to be due to charged stripes may be actually due to merons and antimerons whose cores are small polarons .    it has been though that a disconnected fermi surface like feature ( called `` fermi arc'')@xcite seen in the angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) and the drude - like peak observed in the optical conductivity measurement@xcite indicate that the charge carriers are not small polarons , thus , small polarons are thought to be not relevant to cupreate superconductivity",
    ". however , the present model explains those phenomena with the small polaron as an essential ingredient , although it is not the charge carrier .",
    "let us first simulate the arpes experiment : we calculate the arpes plot as a sum of the square of the absolute value of the fourier transform of single particle level wave functions given by @xmath204 where @xmath205 is the arbitrarily chosen lower limit of the occupied state , @xmath206 is the highest occupied state in the lower hubbard band , and @xmath207 is the @xmath32th single particle wave function . the results are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : arpes ] . a fermi arc which is similar to the one observed in arpes@xcite",
    "is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : arpes ] .",
    "the fermi arc is more arc - like when the circular currents are all in the same ( clockwise or counterclockwise ) direction and produce a large current region .",
    "therefore , the experimentally obtained fermi arc suggests the presence of bipolaronic cores of merons and antimerons with a large circular current area , which is in accord with the result in section iv that a larger current state is energetically favorable .",
    "next , we shall consider the drude peak problem . the drude weight of eq .",
    "( [ drude ] ) is expected to arise in states with circular currents around small polarons .",
    "low energy excitations associated with flipping of circular currents ( from clockwise one to counterclockwise one , or vise versa ) exist ; an estimate from the case depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : arpes ] is that it is of order of @xmath208 mev .",
    "therefore , the drude - like peak observed in the optical conductivity measurement@xcite is qualitatively explained in the present model .    in the cuprates , the anomalously large nernst signal and enhanced diamagnetism",
    "have been observed at temperatures well above @xmath209 .",
    "@xcite a large nernst signal is usually associated with the flow of abrikosov vortices , thus , it is tempting to regard the enhanced nernst signal as evidence for the spontaneous formation of moving abrikosov vortices . besides , it is also in accord with the scenario that the onset of superconductivity corresponds to the establishment of a long - range coherence of the order parameter phase.@xcite however , it has been argued that the presence of a supercurrent that is capable of forming abrikosov vortices seems to be implausible at such high temperatures since the sharp resistive and magnetic transitions at @xmath209 can not be explained by the fluctuation scenario.@xcite indeed , the scanning squid microscopy observed the disappearance of the abrikosov vortices above @xmath209.@xcite the origin of the large nernst effect is a very controversial issue.@xcite the present work provides a new explanation : it is due to the flow of the bipolaronic cores of merons and antimerons .",
    "the comparison of the experimental results@xcite and the formula in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nernst ] ) indicates that the magnitude of the magnetization increases exponentially with the increase of @xmath210 , which may be attributed to the increase of the number of the bipolarons ; if we assume each bipolaron contributes either an average up or down magnetic moment produced by the circular current around it , the magnetization will be proportional to the difference of the numbers of the up and down magnetic moments per volume .",
    "let us try a fit to the experimentally measured magnetization to the function @xmath211 , where @xmath70 and @xmath212 are fitting parameters ; the fit is very good as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ong ] . from the fit",
    ", the formation energy @xmath213 of the bipolaron is estimated to be 75 mev , which is close to the value where a kink is observed in the energy dispersion of angle resolved photoemission spectrum.@xcite note that this energy seems to be larger than that is expected for the flipping of the circular currents ; and may correspond to the formation energy of a bipolaron from two separate polarons .    in terms of the present model , the experimental fact that the observed nernst signal above @xmath209 smoothly connects to that by the abrikosov vortices below @xmath209@xcite implies a rather surprising conclusion : the flow of the bipolarons smoothly connects to the abrikosov vortex flow , thus , the phase that generates the supercurrent below @xmath209 ( the phase of the order parameter ) is actually the phase that generates a circular current around the bipolaron above @xmath209 ( the phase for the gauge potential @xmath156 ) .",
    "in other words , the cuprate superconductivity may be the superconductivity with the bipolarons serving not as the charge carriers , but as _ pumps _ for the supercurrent .",
    "one may think that in such a theory , the flux quantization in the units of @xmath214 , or the ac josephson effect with the frequency @xmath215 ( @xmath216 is the applied voltage ) will not be possible because the charge on the current carrier is not @xmath217 .",

    "it is known that the current given above leads to the meissner effect , which is in accord with the fact mentioned in section v that the state with the diamagnetic current becomes more stable when an external magnetic field is applied .",
