    "determining the main source of ionizing radiation and the star - formation rate ( sfr ) of galaxies are essential quests in the study of galaxy evolution . while optical diagnostic diagrams ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) allows a rather clear distinction between star - formation ( sf ) and accretion disk processes , they are limited to - by definition - visible components and are at this point extremely difficult to apply at high redshifts .",
    "the same caveats apply to the measurement of sfrs from optical lines .",
    "mid - infrared ( mir ) spectroscopy offers a potent alternative , much less sensitive to interstellar exinction .",
    "mir galaxy spectra exhibit an array of features arising essentially from ( 1 ) a continuous distribution of dust grains , the smallest of which ( vsgs for very small grains ) produce the continuum longward of @xmath2 @xcite while larger ones containing silicates produce absorption features at 9.7 and 18  @xcite ; ( 2 ) ionized interstellar gas producing fine - structure lines ; and ( 3 ) molecular gas producing most notably a series of broad emission features , most prominent in the @xmath3  range , which were previously referred to as `` unidentified infrared bands '' but are now commonly attributed to vibrational emission of large polycyclic aromatic hydocarbon ( pah ) molecules @xcite .",
    "rotational lines of molecular hydrogen are also detected ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as these calibrations and the resolving power of the various diagnostic diagrams vary with galaxy types , it is important to review the mir spectral properties of well defined classes of objects .",
    "the infrared spectrograph ( irs ) on board the _ spitzer _ satellite has allowed many such investigations , building on earlier fundamental results from the infrared space observatory @xcite .",
    "much attention has been devoted to extreme sources such as ulirgs @xcite , starburst galaxies @xcite , agns @xcite or qsos @xcite .",

    "whether vsg or pah emission can be used to trace sf in normal galaxies has been often debated in recent years @xcite . resolved observations of star - forming regions",

    "an additional source of uncertainty is the common occurence of agn in normal galaxies .",
    "pah molecules are also thought to get destroyed near the hard radiation fields of agns @xcite however not totally and as was shown recently from irs spectroscopy , preferentially at short wavelengths @xcite .",
    "there is in fact no a priori reason why pah emission could not be excited by uv photons from an agn @xcite .",
    "this further compromises the use of pah bands as sfr indicators , unless agns can be reliably detected in the mir spectra of normal galaxies .",
    "we have obtained irs spectra for a sample of 101 normal galaxies at @xmath4 with the goal to tackle the above issues , making use of additional multi - wavelength ( ultraviolet to far - infrared ) photometric data and optical spectroscopic data .",
    "the first results of this survey have been reported by @xcite who analyzed the dependence of the relative strength of pah emission features with optical measures of sf and agn activity .",
    "we are pursuing this study by comparing optical and mir diagnostic diagrams to detect agn presence in normal galaxies and by investigating the use of pah , mir continuum and emission line luminosities as tracer of the total ir luminosity and  derived sfrs .",

    "the pearson coefficients for the agn population alone at long wavelengths are -0.97 , -0.89 and -0.81 respectively from top to bottom , though admittedly they are boosted by the rightmost data point . a larger sample of agns is needed to confirm this correlation .",
    "pah strength remains largely independent of radiation field hardness for sf and composite galaxies .",
    "these results complement the analysis of @xcite who found a correlation between the long - to - short wavelength pah ratios and 3hb in agns .",
    "these trends are consistent with the selective destruction of pah molecules in the hard radiation fields of these sources ( 3hb @xmath83 ) .",
    "the ew trends or lack thereof in figure [ fig : ew - o3hb ] suggest that the smallest pah molecules effective at producing the short - wavelength pah features get destroyed first , near an agn , while the larger molecules producing the larger wavelength pahs require increasingly harder radiation fields for their pah strength to drop below that of sf galaxies . @xcite",
    "first suggested that the absence of pahs could be taken as evidence for the presence of an agn .",
    "weak pah emission has since often been used to discriminate between photoionization and accretion disk processes .",
    "however the common boundaries for a ` pure starburt ' , e.g. ew(7.7)@xmath84 @xcite or ew(6.2 ) @xmath79  @xcite are significantly too weak here , due to the different method we use to compute the equivalent widths as shown above . based on the pahfit decomposition",
    ", sf galaxies would be best isolated by ew(6.2 ) @xmath84 , ew(7.7 ) @xmath85or ew(8.6)@xmath861 , the latter two criteria being more accurately determined in our sample .",
    "those limits are shown as dotted lines in the left panel of figure [ fig : ew - o3hb ] .",
    "the two sf exceptions below the 7.7  and 8.6  ew limits ( # 32 and # 74 ) happen to have very strong silicate absorption parameters ( @xmath871.8 and 2.33 ) and still very distorted absorption - corrected continua compared to the rest of the sample .",
    "the dotted lines in the right panel are approximate lower limits for the sf population ( ew(11.3 ) @xmath88 , ew(12.7 ) @xmath89 and ew(17 ) @xmath90 ) .",
    "it is clear that the agn population becomes increasingly difficult to isolate based on ew alone in the red part of the spectrum .",
    "figures [ fig : ew - d4 ] and [ fig : ew - n2 ha ] show the ews of the main pah features as a function 4n  and 2 ha  respectively .",
    "the ews at short wavelengths show a mild downward trend with increasing age ( or decreasing sf activities ) while they become independent of it at long wavelengths .",
    "this again is consistent with the correlations between the long - to - short wavelength pah ratios and 4n  or  equivalent width found by @xcite .",
    "the short wavelength ews decrease more notably with increasing 2 ha  ratios , which of course are related to 4n  but appear to be the property that most uniformally and significantly affects the sample as a whole .",
    "metallicity and sf activity are known to affect pah strength , however , as mentionned earlier , previous studies have demonstrated the opposite effect , namely a decrease in pah strength at very low metallicity and in intense sf environment .",
    "these trends thus make normal blue sequence galaxies the sites of maximum pah strength .",
    "other than pah destruction , another cause of decreasing pah strength at low wavelengths may be a stronger continuum whose strength may depend on the above parameters . a short wavelength continuum ( 310 ) has been observed in agns , which is attributed to very hot dust heated by their intense radiation fields ( laurent et al .",
    "2000 and references therein ) , however the continuum slopes of agns in our sample largely overlap those of the sf population ( figure [ fig : slope - x ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : laurent ] shows the ew of the 7.7  feature as a function of continuum slope , a diagnostic diagram proposed by @xcite to distinguish agns from pdrs and  regions .",
    "a clear trend is seen for sf and composite galaxies , suggesting that decreased pah strength in normal sf galaxies may be at least partly due to an increased continuum at low wavelength , which is itself loosely correlated with 4n  ( figure [ fig : slope - x ] ) .",
    "however the ews of agns appear quite independent of their continuum slope , supporting the pah destruction scenario . in this diagram , agns are expected to populate the lower left side of the plot ( shallow slopes and weak pah features ) , pdrs the lower right corner ( shallow slopes and strong pah features ) and  regions the upper left corner of the diagram ( steep slopes and weak pah features ) .",
    "our sf sequence is qualitatively similar to the location of quiescent sf regions on the laurent et al .",
    "diagram ( their figure 6 ) , which are modeled by a mix of pdr and  region spectra , plus an agn component towards the lower left corner where composite galaxies are indeed most concentrated .",

    "the agn with no detected  line is plotted as an upper limit assuming an /line ratio based on the correlation between /  and 3hb  for other agns in figure [ fig : lineratios ] .",
    "we applied a cut in error bars to this plot for clarity ( @xmath91log(/ ) @xmath92 , roughly the scale of the @xmath93-axis ) , which excludes 1 agn , 1 composite galaxy and 1 sf galaxy .",
    "one other agn is found with no measurable ew .",
    "the dotted line represents a variable mix of agn and sf region ; the short solid lines perpendicular to it delineate the agn region on the left , the sf region at the bottom right , and in between a region of mixed classifications whose physical meaning remains unclear @xcite .",

    "the long - dashed line is an empiral boundary marking the region below which we do not find any sf galaxy : @xmath98    despite a mixed region of composite and sf galaxies , there is a clear sequence from the bottom left to the top right of the plots and 3 regions where each optical class is uniquely represented . in particular weak agns",

    "deep xmm observations are available only over a small region of the lockman hole and the first radio limits are too bright to reliably test the presence of faint agns .",

    "4 ) , with a standard deviation of 0.05 dex .",
    "this shows that the total ir luminosity really is driven by the mips points ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we note also that integrating the seds between 8 and 1000  ( sometimes called the fir luminosity ) would decrease the luminosity by @xmath104 dex in the present sample .",
    "figure [ fig : ltir - all ] shows the correlations between  and @xmath105 ratios where @xmath106 equals - from top to bottom - the luminosity of the pah complexes at 7.7 and 17 , the luminosity of the continuum at 8 and 16 , and the total restframe luminosities in the 8  irac band , 16  irs band and 24  mips bands .",

    "the rms and pearson coefficients of the correlations are also quoted for the sf population alone .",
    "it is striking that galaxies of all types follow the same tight , nearly linear correlations between  and the broadband luminosities in all 3 _ spitzer _ bands over 2 dex in luminosity .",
    "this implies that all the galaxies in our sample are assigned nearly the same sed from a few  to a thousand  and that the fir component can be well predicted from any one broadband luminosity in the mir .",
    "this in turn suggests a common heating source for the small and large dust grains responsible for the mir and fir emissions respectively @xcite .",
    "the same correlations apply whether this heating source is stellar or an agn .",
    "although this may result from the implicit stellar origin of the dust heating in the models , the source of ionizing radiation may not significantly affect the broad sed , at least for weak agns .",
    "many attempts have been made to derive calibrations between  and single mir broadband luminosities @xcite .",
    "our best fit slope at 16  (  @xmath111 ) is in good agreement with that of @xcite for the 15  iso fluxes . at 24  our correlation for sf galaxies (  @xmath112 )",
    "is more linear than found in other studies @xcite but the discrepancy with the first three calibrations @xcite disappears when including composite galaxies into the fit (  @xmath113 ) . on the other hand",
    "our correlation is in excellent agreement with the @xcite sample ( hereafter mk06 ) .",
    "the pah and continuum luminosities also correlate remarkably tightly and nearly linearly with , however with some distinctions between agns and sf galaxies and between the hot and cool parts of the spectrum .",
    "the scatter between  and pah luminosity for sf galaxies is larger for the 17  pah feature than for the 7.7  pah feature .",
    "agns and composite galaxies blend with the sf population in the 17  feature correlation whereas they tend to have lower pah luminosities at 7.7  and stronger 8  continua for the same .",
    "the residuals are shown in figure [ fig : residuals - ltir ] as a function of the corresponding equivalent widths .",
    "the relations between these residuals and ews are of course expected since the total flux at 8 and 16  can be nearly perfectly substituted for  for sf galaxies and agns alike in the left and right panels respectively ( the dotted lines show the predicted relations assuming these substitutions ) .",
    "the most scattered correlation is found with the continuum luminosity at 8 .",
    "this may be due to larger measurement errors since this continuum is faint and/or a stellar contribution unrelated to .",
    "a more speculative reason may be that this continuum originates from high intensity radiation fields only and is thus uncorrelated with the cold component of , unlike the pah emission .",
    "the scaling factors @xmath108 are listed in table [ table : coeffs ] for the main pah features and the _ spitzer _ band luminosities .",
    "we also add to our list of mir components the peak luminosity of the 7.7  pah feature , defined as @xmath114 , as it is a more easily measurable quantity at high redshift than the integrated flux of the pah feature @xcite . for galaxies with ew@xmath85  ( most sf galaxies ) ,",
    "the median ratio of this peak luminosity to the total luminosity of the pah complex , @xmath115 , is @xmath116 and the peak luminosity estimates the total pah luminosity to within @xmath26 20% .",
    "however the overestimate can be as large as 50% for other galaxy types in this sample , in particular galaxies containing an agn which may not be easily isolated in high redshift samples and may also have much smaller ews leading to yet larger errors .    for the calibration that shows the strongest deviation from linearity in figure [ fig : ltir - all ] , which is found for the 7.7  pah luminosity ( @xmath117 ) , the linear approximation @xmath118 ( where @xmath119 ) recovers  within a factor of 1.5 _ in this sample_. for starbursts and ulirg starbursts , @xcite found a mean log@xmath120 of 2.09 and 2.26 respectively , considerably larger than for normal galaxies .",

    "our mean logarythmic ratio for the 6.2  feature is 1.5 and 2.0 with and without aperture correction respectively while @xcite find a value of 2.4 for a sample of normal and starburst nuclei .",
    "this ratio is yet higher ( 3.2 ) in galactic  regions while highly embedded star - forming regions can lack pah emission altogether @xcite .",
    "these increased ratios for starburst regions compared to normal sf galaxies are generally attributed to pah destruction near the site of on - going sf due to intense radiation fields , making pahs poor tracers of sf ( peeters et al .",
    "2004 and references therein ) .",
    "the ew dependence of the log@xmath120 ratio is clearly seen within our sample in the upper left panel of figure [ fig : residuals - ltir ] .",
    "this cautions against the use of a single linear relation between pah luminosity and   for galaxies of unknown physical properties .",
    "however independently of galaxy type we expect to find lower values than these studies which all made use of interpolation methods to extract the pah features .",
    "using a lorentzian profile fitting method comparable to pahfit for a sample of starburst - dominated lirgs at @xmath121 , @xcite find mean log@xmath122 ratios of @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 for the 6.2 , 7.7 and 11.3  features respectively .",
    "these ratios are 2.6 , 1.8 , and 1.4 times larger than ours respectively , closer than previous studies despite the quite different galaxy type considered .",
    "the wavelength gradient can be explained in the context of selective pah destruction .",
    "finally we note that in our sample the total @xmath126  pah luminosity amounts to @xmath127 of the total ir luminosity for sf galaxies , @xmath128 for composite galaxies and @xmath129 for agns .",
    "the 7.7  feature alone accounts for @xmath130 of the total pah emission .",
    "these fractional contributions are in good agreement with those found in the sings sample ( s07 ) .",
    "the tir luminosity is a robust tracer of the sfr for very dusty starbursts , whose stellar emission is dominated by young massive stars and almost entirely absorbed by dust ( typically galaxies with depleted pah emission ) , but for more quiescent and/or less dusty galaxies such as those in the present sample , it can include a non negligible contribution from dust heated by evolved stars ( ` cirrus emission ' ) as well as miss a non negligible fraction of the young stars emission that is not absorbed by dust @xcite . for normal spiral galaxies the contribution of non ionizing photons may actually dominate the dust heating over  regions @xcite while low dust opacity makes these galaxies  and uv bright .",
    "the tight correlations between mir luminosities and  indicate that the same caveats apply from the mir to the fir @xcite .",
    "emission is a more direct quantifier of young massive stars - in the absence of agn - but inversely it must be corrected for the fraction that gets absorbed by dust .",
    "the sdss line fluxes are corrected for foreground ( galactic ) reddening using @xcite .",
    "the correction for intrinsic extinction is usually done using the balmer decrement and an extinction curve to first order , or more accurately with higher order hydrogen lines @xcite . here",
    "we correct the sdss  fluxes in the usual simple way using the stellar - absorption corrected /  ratio and a galactic extinction curve .",
    "we assumed an intrinsic /  ratio of 2.86 ( case b recombination at electron temperature @xmath131 and density @xmath132 ) and @xmath133 ( the mean value for the diffuse ism ) .",
    "the  attenuations range from 0.4 to 2.3 mag in the sf galaxy subsample with a median value of 1.1 mag , meaning that between 10 and 70% of the  photons do _ not _ get reemitted in the ir .",
    "the sdss  measurements also require fiber aperture corrections . here again we apply the usual method which consists in scaling the fiber - measured  fluxes using the @xmath15-band petrosian - to - fiber flux ratios @xcite .",
    "the mean value for these ratios is 3.5 .",

    "this may actually be a coincidence due to the fact that the cirrus emission and the unattenuated ionizing flux roughly cancel each other in massive spiral galaxies ( k09 and references therein ) .",
    "our @xmath139 ratio is also in good agreement with the mk06 sample ( @xmath140 ) . in recent years",

    "given the good agreement between our and the mk06 samples in the ir ( cf .",
    "the   @xmath141 correlation in the previous section ) , differences in  measurements must be responsible for the discrepancy in slopes .",

    "the optical spectroscopic data in particular allow us to classify these galaxies into star - forming , composite and agns , according to the standard optical `` bpt '' diagnotic diagram .",
    "the mir spectra were obtained with the low resolution modules of the _ spitzer _ irs and decomposed into unattenuated features and continuum using the pahfit code of @xcite .",
    "a notable feature of this decomposition method is to extract a much larger pah contribution ( and proportionally smaller continuum contribution ) from the total flux compared to standard spline fitting methods which anchor the continuum in the wings of the features where non negligible pah power remain . as a consequence , the pah equivalenth widths are not only larger but extend over a considerably larger dynamic range ( e.g. the equivalent widths of the 6.2 and 7.7  pah features in our sample extend to 15 and 32   respectively ) .",
    "we study the variations of the various mir spectral components as a function of the optically derived age ( as measured by the 4000  break index ) , radiation field hardness ( as measured by the 3hb  ratio ) and metallicity ( as measured by 2 ha  ratio ) of the galaxies .",
    "systematic trends are found despite the lack of extreme objects in the sample , in particular between pah strength at low wavelength and gas phase metallicity , and between the ratio of high to low excitation lines ( e.g. / ) and radiation field hardness .",
    "these trends confirm earlier results detected in sources with higher surface brightnesses such as ulirgs , strong agns and  nuclei .",
    "our results are consistent with the selective destruction in agn radiation fields of the smallest pah molecules efficient at producing the low wavelength pah features ( 6.2 to 8.6 ) .",
    "they also suggest that radiation fields harder than those in the present sample would also destroy larger pah molecules responsible for the longer wavelength features ( 11.3 to 17 ) .",
    "aging galaxies also tend to show weaker low wavelength pah features , consistent with their main origin in star - forming regions .",
    "we revisit the mir diagnostic diagram of genzel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) relating pah equivalent widths and /  emission line ratios .",
    "based on the strongest trends we observed between these measurements and optical emission line ratios and thanks to the extended range of equivalent widths provided by pahfit , we find this diagnostic to closely resemble the optical `` bpt '' diagram , with a much improved resolving power for normal galaxies than previously found based on spline derived equivalent widths .",
    "a mixed region of star - forming and composite galaxies remains , which may be revealing obscured agns in a large fraction of the optically defined ` pure ' star - forming galaxies .",
    "we find tight and nearly linear correlations between the total infrared luminosity of star - forming galaxies and the luminosity of individual mir components , including pah features , continuum , neon emission lines and molecular hydrogen lines .",
    "this implies that these individual mir components are good gauges of the total dust emission on galactic scale despite different spatial and physical origins on the scale of star - forming regions .",
    "following the approach of @xcite based on energy balance arguments , we show that like the total infrared luminosity , these individual components can be used to estimate dust attenuation in the uv and in the  lines .",
    "given the non negligible attenuation in these ir selected galaxies , the correlations between the mir and dust corrected  luminosities can also provide first order estimates of the sfr .",
