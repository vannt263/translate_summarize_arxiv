    "until recently most calculations performed with the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model@xcite have been restricted to tree - level in the mesons or , in other words , to leading order ( lo ) in the @xmath0 expansion .",
    "although the possible importance of quantum fluctuations of the mesons has been generally recognized ( see , for example , refs.@xcite ) , a satisfactory treatment of such effects has required the development of schemes that are faithful to the chiral invariance of the model .",
    "this is crucial , given that the most important motivation for studying the model is its description of the dynamical symmetry breakdown .",
    "schemes have been introduced on the basis of an effective action method@xcite , an appropriate selection of feynman diagrams@xcite and a bosonized approximation@xcite .",
    "calculations at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in @xmath0 are certainly more involved than at lo , both analytically and numerically . however , since @xmath0 is such a modest expansion parameter , it has rightly been seen as important to estimate the size of some nlo effects . even if the calculations were of interest for no other reason , a check on this perturbative approach would be very valuable .",
    "encouragingly , there seems to be a general consensus emerging from recent studies that nlo corrections are indeed relatively small for standard choices of the model parameters@xcite , at least for properties of the ground state and of the pion .",
    "a contrary view , however , has been expressed by kleinert and van den bossche@xcite .    the most compelling reason for a nlo analysis , however , is that the lo treatment of an njl - type model neglects physical processes that are expected to be qualitatively important .",
    "for instance , several of the particles described by such models ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) are broad resonances , yet the model meson propagators at lo are purely real . at nlo the particle widths are incorporated in a natural way , by including diagrams with two - meson intermediate states in the bethe",
    " salpeter equation ( bse ) .",
    "although these widths can be estimated from the lo decay amplitudes , the effects on the position of a resonance require a nlo treatment .",
    "such effects may well prove important in model descriptions of , for example , the @xmath5 meson@xcite .    a difficulty with the model at nlo concerns the specification of model parameters associated with regularization of the loop integrals . at",
    "lo the model contains three parameters : the current quark mass , a coupling constant and a cutoff parameter that regularizes quark loops .",
    "conventionally two of these parameters are fitted to the pion mass and decay constant , while the third is at least constrained by the value of the quark condensate . however , the regularization of the model must be further specified at nlo since meson and quark loop integrals can be regulated quite independently without affecting chiral symmetry relations@xcite .",
    "the parameter space can be limited to some extent because the nlo corrections produce instabilities for large values of the meson cutoff@xcite .",
    "nonetheless the freedom to introduce another cutoff parameter produces significant uncertainty .",
    "et al._@xcite have determined the meson cutoff by studying the pion electromagnetic form factor and find values well away from the region of instabilities .",
    "this is a promising result , but to put it on a firmer basis one would have to relax assumptions that were made in ref.@xcite for numerical reasons meson was included in the model but vector and axial - vector degrees of freedom were not included as intermediate states in the nlo diagrams .",
    "in addition , @xmath7 mixing was neglected , even though this is a lo effect . ] .",
    "an attractive alternative is to perform the regularization at the level of the model action rather than in the loop integrals . in this approach",
    "the regularization is specified from the outset and does not have to be imposed at each order of the expansion , a point which has been stressed by ripka@xcite .    in this paper , we make a nlo analysis of a model that was originally proposed in ref.@xcite .",
    "it has subsequently been studied at lo in the meson@xcite , baryon ( soliton)@xcite and quark matter@xcite sectors .",
    "the two - body interaction vertex is nonlocal and separable , a gaussian form factor being associated with each quark field .",
    "such a model successfully eliminates several of the traditional problems of the njl model whilst nevertheless retaining much of the simplicity that is its chief merit .",
    "the separable nature of the interaction is motivated in part by instanton liquid studies@xcite .",
    "the interaction form factors ensure the convergence of all loop integrals and so the nlo corrections are unambiguous .",
    "in addition , a practical advantage is conferred by the shape of the form factor , which allows complicated nlo diagrams to be evaluated efficiently with gaussian numerical techniques .",
    "such properties make this model a particularly convenient one with which to examine nlo effects .",
    "nlo quantum fluctuations of the quark condensate in a variant of this model were studied in ref.@xcite . here",
    "we investigate the nlo treatment of mesons .    in our approach",
    "we keep the full momentum dependence of all quark loop diagrams , and avoid expanding them in powers of meson momenta .",
    "such an expansion may be useful in the determination of pion properties , but it is not valid for heavy mesons , such as the scalar , isoscalar sigma .",
    "in this section we define the model used and recall some important aspects of its behaviour at lo .",
    "this is entirely standard@xcite and is included largely in order to establish our notation .",
    "the action of a quark model with a four - point interaction may be written @xmath8 @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes dirac , colour and isospin matrices .",
    "chiral symmetry constrains certain of the possible dirac and isospin structures to appear in particular combinations .",

    "the @xmath13 are simply constants",
    ". however , the use of a nonlocal interaction is appealing@xcite , not least because it enables one to avoid some of the ambiguities associated with regularization .",
    "moreover , a nonlocal interaction of separable form is suggested by studies of the instanton - liquid picture of the qcd vacuum@xcite . in this case , the momentum space form of the @xmath13 is @xmath14 with the @xmath15 being constants which , for the purposes of counting , we take to be @xmath16 . although the instanton - liquid model @xcite predicts a particular form for the form - factor function @xmath17 , other authors@xcite have considered a function which is a gaussian in euclidean space , @xmath18 the gaussian shape produces a good phenomenology of mesons and nucleons in the lo approximation@xcite and is used for the numerical results in this paper .    at leading order in the @xmath0 expansion",

    "one has to include additional nonlocal terms in the currents@xcite .",
    "these arise as a consequence of the nonlocality of the action .",
    "details of the nonlocal terms required in both vector and axial currents can be found in refs.@xcite .",
    "although the method developed in those papers is not unique and there is an ambiguity in defining the transverse parts of the currents , this does not affect the longitudinal components .",
    "as an example , consider the pion decay constant .",
    "the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ lo_pi - axial ] represent the contributions from the local and nonlocal pieces of the axial current .",

    "these can be constructed by first performing a fierz transformation on the action and then using the transformed action in just the same way that one uses the original action at lo .",
    "the fierz transformed action of this model contains the following colour - singlet terms : @xmath50 ( there are also colour - octet terms which we do not use here . )    the nonlocal terms in the symmetry currents of the model also involve four quark fields and so will also be subject to exchange effects at nlo .",
    "these fock pieces in the currents will introduce further ambiguity through the definition of their transverse parts .",
    "one way to construct the nlo current terms is to take the fierz transformed action and to apply the same method as was used in refs.@xcite to form the nonlocal currents from the original model action .",
    "this method leads to nonlocal nlo current terms of the same structures as those presented in ref.@xcite , with the appropriate coupling constants in the original terms replaced by the corresponding combinations of couplings from the fierz transformed action .",
    "for example , as well as a term @xmath51 in the nonlocal axial current constructed from the original action ( see eq .",
    "( [ lo_current_example ] ) ) , there is a fock term of the same structure where @xmath38 is replaced by @xmath52 .",
    "an alternative approach to constructing the fock terms of the model s currents is simply to fierz transform the lo currents of ref.@xcite .",
    "the differences between this procedure and the one outlined above ( where the noether - like method for deriving a symmetry current is applied after the fierz transformation ) lie in the combinations of form factors which are present in the currents .",

    "the equivalence of the longitudinal components has been checked explicitly@xcite . in practice ,",

    "at nlo these quantities depend not just on the nlo pieces of the quark condensate and pion - quark coupling , but also on the tadpole piece of the quark self - energy . the fact that this nlo tadpole energy is small is crucial to the smallness of the corrections to pion properties .",
