    "the standard model has enjoyed an impressive phenomenological success . its agreement with the precision measurement from lep",
    "has increased the general confidence on the @xmath0 structure of the model @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the fundamental question of how is the electroweak symmetry broken in nature has not been experimentally answered yet .",
    "in fact it is generally acknowledged that the standard symmetry breaking mechanism is unsatisfactory from the theoretical point of view due to the hierarchy and triviality problems .",
    "these reasons make it necessary to investigate new signatures for alternative models of electroweak symmetry breaking . in this paper",
    "we deal with dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking @xcite , not committing to any specific model but rather using some general features of realistic models , like non - minimal technicolor .",
    "many non - minimal technicolor models predict the existence of color non - singlet scalar and vector resonances . in a recent letter",
    "we have studied in detail the single production of a color octet isosinglet technipion ( technieta , @xmath1 ) at the tevatron run ii @xcite . in the present letter",
    "we extend our work by considering the production of a pair of technietas .",
    "this process was studied for the first time by eichten _",
    "@xcite in the context of the one - family technicolor model and by lane and ramana @xcite in the context of walking technicolor .",
    "they perform calculations for the production cross section and for the invariant mass distribution .",
    "they also correctly point out the fact that the production of a pair of technietas is enhanced by the mixing , in the s - channel , between a gluon and a color octet isosinglet vector resonance , the so called `` technirho '' ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "nevertheless , they do not take into account either the decay of technietas or realistic effects such as the smearing of final momenta .",
    "we also find their description of the gluon - technirho mixing incomplete as we shall see below .    in what follows",
    "we analyze critically the traditional description of the gluon - technirho mixing and we emphasize its failure with a simple example .",
    "we show how to construct a consistent gauge invariant model using physical fields in order to describe the interactions among technirhos , gluons , fermions and technietas . using this consistent approach",
    ", we perform a detailed simulation of double technieta production at the tevatron followed by their decay into three jets and a photon via the process @xmath3 .",
    "we finally perform a simulation of the irreducible qcd background and present our results .",
    "an important feature of technieta pair production is its enhancement due to gluon - technirho mixing through vector meson dominance , as shown in figure 1 .",
    "this approach is phenomenologically successful in describing photon - rho mixing.however , one must be careful when trying to implement the vector dominance principle in the presence of non - abelian interactions . as an illustrative example we consider technirho decay into two gluons .",
    "traditionally this process is represented only by fig .",
    "the technirho - gluon mixing is described by the lagrangian    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the strong coupling constant , @xmath6 is the mass of the technirho and @xmath7 is the relevant coupling constant of the process @xmath8 .",
    "one estimates @xmath7 by scaling from low energy dynamics as :    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the number of technicolors . with these ingredients one obtains the usual result for the invariant amplitude and the decay width :    @xmath11\\epsilon_1^{\\mu } \\epsilon_2^{*\\nu } \\epsilon_3^{*\\lambda}\\ ] ]    @xmath12    however , the technirho is a color octet particle and a three - point technirho vertex must exist , as shown in fig .",
    "2b . as we will show in the next section",
    ", this self - interaction must have the same dynamical origin as the @xmath8 decay and so the three - point technirho vertex must be proportional to @xmath7 ( in fact to @xmath13 due to normalization ) . as a consequence , the invariant amplitude for the diagram shown in fig .",
    "2b can be written as ( the extra ( @xmath14 ) factor comes from the addition of an extra propagator and an extra mixing term ) :    @xmath15\\epsilon_1^{\\mu } \\epsilon_2^{*\\nu } \\epsilon_3^{*\\lambda}.\\ ] ]    as we can see , when the technirho is on - shell ( @xmath16 ) the contribution from diagram 2b , which as far as we know has not been taken into account previously , exactly cancels diagram 2a .",
    "it is an indication that a more consistent and complete model for the gluon - technirho interaction is needed .",
    "we start by considering a general lagrangian which describes the mixing of two color octet vector fields    @xmath17    where    @xmath18    and    @xmath19    we propose the following transformation laws for the fields @xmath20 and @xmath21 :    @xmath22    and    @xmath23    imposing gauge invariance we find the relations :    @xmath24    notice that from equations ( [ eq : mix1]),([eq : l1 ] ) and ( [ g01mr ] ) we find that @xmath25 . on the other hand ,",
    "the lagrangian ( [ eq : l1 ] ) and the relations ( [ g01mr ] ) define the following mass matrix :    @xmath26    it is easy to see that the matrix @xmath27 is singular and so it has a null eigenvalue .",
    "the eigenstates can be written as :    @xmath28    where the mixing angle @xmath29 is defined by @xmath30 .",
    "remark that field @xmath31 represents a physical ( massless ) gluon and @xmath32 is a physical ( and massive ) technirho .",
    "it is instructive to note from equations ( [ eq : trans1],[eq : trans2 ] ) and equations ( [ eq : campfisicos1],[eq : campfisicos2 ] ) that the new ( physical ) fields transform according to @xmath33 ( where we have used the useful definition @xmath34 and we have omitted lorentz indexes ) .",
    "that means that the @xmath35 field transforms as a gauge field and @xmath36 as a matter field in the adjoint representation of su(3 ) .",
    "now we can analyze the @xmath37 interaction",
    ". it can be obtained from lagrangian ( [ eq : l1 ] ) and the definition of the physical fields .",
    "the result is    @xmath38    using the fact that @xmath39 we can see that the coupling constant of the @xmath37 interaction vanishes exactly .      because our main goal is to study the production of a pair of technietas , it is necessary to include in our model the gluon and technirho interactions with technietas . at this point",
    "we implement the vector dominance principle by assuming that the technieta only interacts with the field @xmath40 . using this hypothesis",
    "we can write the following lagrangian :    @xmath41    with    @xmath42    after the diagonalization of the gluon - technirho mass matrix , we arrive at    @xmath43      in a similar way , we assume that quarks only interact with the field @xmath44 so we write the lagrangian    @xmath45    after the diagonalization of the gluon - technirho mass matrix , we obtain    @xmath46",
    "now we can study the production of a pair of technietas in a consistent manner .",
    "the relevant feynman diagrams for this process are shown in figure 3 .",
    "note that , since the physical technirho does not couple to two gluons , the sub - process @xmath47 is not resonant .    in order to perform a realistic simulation , we take into account the technieta decay and the smearing of final momenta .",
    "we focus our attention on the complete process @xmath48 .",
    "we chose this specific process in order to maximize the signal over background ratio .",
    "we use the madgraph / dhelas @xcite package in order to estimate the background .",
    "we include all the leading order qcd processes that contribute to the @xmath49 final state , where the jets are originated by gluons and ( anti-)quarks of the first two generations only .",
    "the dominant process is @xmath50 .",
    "we make the convolution of the parton level processes with cteq structure functions @xcite .    during the event generation",
    "we use the following kinematical cuts :    @xmath51    @xmath52    @xmath53    @xmath54    where @xmath55 represents the pseudo - rapidity and @xmath56 is the angle between two jets .    in order to include the final momenta smearing effect ,",
    "we use the following detector resolution :    @xmath57    @xmath58    the background cross section obtained with the cuts presented above is @xmath59 .",
    "the cross section obtained for the signal is shown in table 1 , which is many orders of magnitude smaller ( we assume that all colored technipions have the same mass ) .    in order to improve our analysis",
    "we implement the following cuts :    @xmath60    @xmath61    and    @xmath62    where @xmath63 is the invariant mass of the photon and a jet system .",
    "figure 4 shows , as an example , the expected event distribution for signal and background , with @xmath64 gev and @xmath65 gev for the tevatron run ii , assuming an integrated luminosity of 2 fb@xmath66 .",
    "it also shows the improvement due to a better energy resolution of the detectors . in all the cases we analyzed ,",
    "the resulting significance was lower than 2 and we can not expect to observe the production of a pair of technietas at the tevatron .",
    "in this work we have performed a detailed analysis of the production of a pair of technietas . during our study",
    "we have shown that the traditional way to deal with the technirho - gluon mixing is inadequate due to the non - abelian interactions felt by the technirho .",
    "this fact led us to build a consistent model for the interactions among technirhos , gluons , technietas and quarks . unfortunately ,",
    "when we applied these results to the production of a pair of technietas we conclude that we have no hope of detecting such a process at the tevatron .",
