    "we consider a scenario in which a `` digital good '' is to be sold to many potential buyers , with the objective of maximizing the revenue .",
    "a digital good is assumed to be provided with unlimited supply and to have no cost of production .",
    "given a set of selfish buyers who may have diverse valuations for the good , a theoretical optimum for the revenue ( commonly denoted ) is given by the sum of the buyers valuations .    in a standard mechanism ,",
    "the allocation algorithm returns binary values so that a buyer would either win a copy of the good , or fail to do so .",
    "here we consider a more expressive class of mechanisms in which a buyer @xmath0 may be offered a probability @xmath1 of receiving the item ; assuming that buyers are risk - neutral , if @xmath0 has valuation @xmath2 for the item , then @xmath0 would have valuation @xmath3 for the probability @xmath1 to receive it .",
    "the general question we consider is , to what extent does the expressiveness of lotteries help us to design truthful mechanisms that better approximate ?      we consider a setting in which we want to auction lotteries for digital goods @xcite , i.e. , goods with unlimited supply and no production costs .",
    "a lottery @xmath4 ( for a specified item ) is defined by its win probability @xmath5 $ ] and its non - negative real - valued price @xmath6 .",
    "a bidder with valuation @xmath7 purchasing lottery @xmath8 has _",
    "@xmath9 , i.e. , his valuation for the item `` weighted '' by the win probability minus the lottery s price .",
    "the model is defined as follows .",
    "there are @xmath10 selfish bidders , with _ true _",
    "valuations @xmath11 , who bid @xmath12 respectively . a mechanism ( also called auction )",
    "is a pair @xmath13 : @xmath14 is an algorithm which on input @xmath15 returns a vector of @xmath10 win probabilities @xmath16 ; @xmath17 is a vector of @xmath10 payment functions , i.e. , how much each bidder is charged to buy the lottery .",
    "we focus on auctions which _ deterministically _ propose lotteries @xmath18 to each bidder @xmath0 ; bidders buy the lottery if their utility is non - negative , i.e. , the lottery satisfies _ voluntary participation_. given that win probabilities and payments are deterministic , @xmath0 s utility @xmath19 is also deterministic .",
    "( that is , if the auction was repeated with the same bids , each bidder would be offered the same lottery , and the auctioneer s revenue would be the same . for a buyer , there remains the uncertainty regarding the win / lose outcome of the lottery itself . )    as mentioned in the discussion below about related works , theoretical motivations for studying this model of lotteries are related to the ones in @xcite and @xcite . from a more practical point of view , the lotteries studied in the paper are perhaps better thought of as a model of uncertainty about what a buyer will receive .",
    "for example , in the context of tv advertising , advertisers pay to buy an ad slot for which the size of the exposed audience is uncertain but may be modeled with a probability distribution ( via e.g. data on programs audience shares ) . also of relevance",
    "is swoopo - style `` recreational shopping '' .",
    "we believe that this model may suggest new kinds of sponsored search products , akin to tv advertising ones , that differ from those currently used by search engines",
    ".    we aim to design _ truthful _ auctions ( where bidders maximize their utility when telling their true valuations ) . in this setting , from the definition of utility , it is immediate to see that we are dealing with one - parameter bidders @xcite .",
    "therefore , according to the characterization of truthful mechanisms for one - parameter bidders , we have to design _ monotone _ lotteries , i.e. , lotteries for which the win probability is non - decreasing in the bid .",
    "moreover , @xmath20 , the amount bidder @xmath0 must be charged , must be of the form  @xcite : @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the bid vector @xmath23 with all but the @xmath0-th entry and @xmath24 is any function depending on @xmath22 ( but not @xmath25 ) . a stronger requirement is to demand _ collusion - resistant _ auctions in which _ any _ coalition of bidders maximizes the sum of the utilities of its members when they are truthtelling .",
    "collusion - resistant lotteries are characterized in this context in terms of _ singular _ allocations .",
    "a monotone win probability function @xmath1 is singular if for all @xmath26 , we have @xmath27 .",

    "if bidders are known to have 2 possible types , represented by a high valuation @xmath43 and a low valuation @xmath8 , then  can not be approximated better than about @xmath44 by any deterministic `` classical '' auction selling goods and not lotteries . by contrast , if the auctioneer is allowed to sell lottery tickets with win probabilities of @xmath45 and @xmath46 respectively , then a bidder with valuation @xmath8 would be willing to pay @xmath47 to buy the first kind of ticket ; similarly , a bidder with valuation @xmath43 will pay @xmath48 to buy the ticket with win probability @xmath46 .",

    "our lower bounds measure the limitation of truthful mechanisms in terms of approximation guarantee to  independently of the number of bidders .",
    "surprisingly , the best one can achieve when requiring incentive - compatibility is in fact obtainable by mechanisms having the stronger property of collusion - resistance .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , this is the first known case in which collusion - resistant mechanisms are as strong as truthful ones .",
    "this represents , in a sense , a first positive result on ( deterministic ) collusion - resistant mechanisms which have otherwise very limited power , as shown by the strong negative results in @xcite .",
    "let us note that , regardless of the size of the domain , there always exists a bid vector for which @xmath64 ( e.g. , a vector of all @xmath8 for binary domains ) and therefore the approximation guarantees of our lotteries w.r.t .",

    "( nevertheless , this is not surprising as our lotteries are resistant to collusive behavior and not just truthful as the auctions designed to approximate @xmath41 . )",
    "we leave open the problem of devising incentive - compatible auctions tailored to approximate @xmath41 since our main aim here is different : firstly , using  as benchmark and , secondly , showing the equivalence between two notions of incentive compatibility at different ends of the spectrum .",
    "we use two different techniques to prove our results .",
    "the lower bound for continuous domains is obtained by adopting a probabilistic technique designed in @xcite to bound from below the revenue of _ universally truthful _ auctions",
    ". these are auctions defined as probability distributions over deterministic truthful auctions . to use the probabilistic technique of @xcite we prove that there is a bijection between truthful lotteries and universally truthful auctions .",
    "however , the technique of @xcite turns out to be not flexible enough to prove bounds which do not depend on the actual values in @xmath50-sized domains .",
    "therefore , theorem  [ thm : finite : lb ] needs the development of a new technique that we introduce in the simpler setting of two - value domains in the proof of theorem  [ thm:2value : lb ] .",
    "( the latter result can also be proved via the probabilistic proof technique given in @xcite . )",
    "our new lower bounding technique relies on the application of carver s theorem @xcite which characterizes inconsistent linear inequality systems in terms of certain linear combinations of the constraints of the system .",
    "requiring to approximate  within a given ratio gives rise to a linear system with a particular structure ; our proofs exploit this structure to define a suitable linear combination according to carver s theorem . in setting up the system of linear inequalities",
    "we are able to `` hide '' the details given by the values in the domain and we can only focus on the asymptotic behavior of lotteries . technically less involved proofs of theorems  [ thm:2value : lb ] and [ thm : finite : lb ] would suffice to obtain the corresponding results in the case of fixed number of bidders but would weaken the equivalence of truthful and collusion - resistant mechanisms to hold only in rather limited scenarios .    finally , let us note that due to the simplicity of our anonymous and singular lotteries , our upper bounds hold also in the online setting of @xcite , i.e. , they hold in a setting in which bidders come online and a decision on the lottery to offer has to be made before the next bidder arrives .",

    "section [ sec : conclusions ] contains some concluding remarks .",
    "this work is motivated by the results in @xcite .",
    "briest et al .",
    "@xcite show how lotteries help in maximizing the revenue when designing envy - free prices . here",
    "we address a similar type of question and aim at obtaining similar results for incentive - compatible lotteries .",
    "truthful lotteries defined above naturally relate to the truthful auctions for digital goods considered in @xcite .",
    "the authors of @xcite show that no deterministic truthful auction can guarantee a reasonable approximation of @xmath65 and therefore focus on universally truthful auctions .",
    "however , they also show that these auctions fail to guarantee any constant approximation of @xmath66 ( cf .",
    "lemma 3.5 in @xcite ) and therefore the benchmark of interest becomes @xmath41 .",
    "they define an interesting auction called random sampling optimal price ( rsop , for short ) and prove that rsop gives a ( quite weak ) constant approximation of @xmath35 ; they also conjecture the right constant to be @xmath67 .",
    "better bounds are then proved in @xcite ; the latter work proves the conjecture when the number of winners is at least 6 and in general for two - valued domains .",
    "our lotteries are deterministic , although a degree of randomness is given by the probabilistic nature of the allocation .",
    "this random aspect can be seen to imply that our truthful lotteries are in fact equivalent to universally truthful auctions ( e.g. , the lottery of the example above can be seen as an uniform probability distribution over a deterministic auction which charges @xmath8 and one which charges @xmath43 for the item ) .",
    "nevertheless , our equivalence proof also shows how lotteries can be seen as a ( arguably more intuitive ) reinterpretation of universally truthful auctions ( e.g. , the universally truthful counterpart of the lottery for @xmath63 $ ] domain involves a probability distribution over an infinite number of mechanisms ) .",
    "( see discussion at the end of section  [ sec : equivalence ] for details . ) because of the aforementioned equivalence , this research can also be seen as a continuation of @xcite studying to which extent the knowledge of the domain helps in approximating  ( e.g. , theorems [ thm:2value : ub ] and [ thm : finite : ub ] contradict the inapproximability result in @xcite , i.e. , lemma 3.5 therein breaks down for finite domains ) .",
    "another related work is @xcite which considers collusion - resistant mechanisms for bidders with domains similar to ours .",
    "a characterization in terms of allocation rules is given ( cf .",
    "proposition [ prop : singular ] ) for randomized mechanisms which define allocations , payments and then utilities in expectation over the random coin tosses of the mechanism . since in our lotteries",
    "we work with deterministic utilities ( even , when considering lotteries as universally truthful auctions ) this characterization holds also in our setting .",
    "a related concept is the _ responsive lotteries _ ,",
    "studied in  @xcite , in which a single agent reports his valuations of a set of alternatives , and is awarded one of them , using probabilities designed to incentivize him to report his true valuations ( up to affine rescaling ) .",
    "the difference here is that we have just one kind of item , and multiple agents .",
    "hart and nisan @xcite use a model similar to ours ( risk - neutral bidders and lottery offers ) in their study of the optimal revenue when selling multiple items .",
    "other benchmarks are defined in the literature to compare the revenue of incentive - compatible auctions , see , e.g. , @xcite . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "our work is the first in which revenue is compared to .",
    "in this section we assume that the bids belong to the interval @xmath63 $ ] .",
    "we begin by proving an upper - bound on the revenue guarantee by a collusion - resistant lottery .",
    "we define @xmath68 for any @xmath0 and @xmath23 . therefore , since @xmath69 we have @xmath70 setting @xmath71 ( the value of the functions @xmath24 has no consequence for the truthfulness of the auction given that it is independent of @xmath25 ) , we have that the utility of agent @xmath0 , when declaring @xmath25 , is @xmath72 which is maximized for @xmath73 .",
    "since each bidder pays a fraction @xmath74 of his bid , the revenue of this truthful auction is a @xmath75-approximation of .",

    "we understand how to define lambda functions that lead to truthful lotteries and maximize the revenue .",
    "it turns out that some simple lambda functions that correspond to anonymous , collusion - resistant mechanisms guarantee a good approximation of the optimal revenue .",
