    "non - equilibrium relaxations cause relaxation times to grow , and hence the glass becomes stiffer with the time since it was formed . since the age of a sample is often characterized by its relaxation times , the deformation - induced acceleration of the dynamics has been associated with `` mechanical rejuvenation '' of aging glasses @xcite . indeed , in the post - yield flow regime , all history dependence is erased .",

    "these events can not be disregarded as hops , as the displacement is often much larger than the cage size .",
    "the ambiguity in determining a hop from a single trajectory is related to the fact that the single particle hop is only a small part of a collective relaxation event . in this work ,",
    "we therefore identify hops through a threshold in the standard deviation of the displacement , rather than the mean ; that is , we define relaxation events by the _",

    "this is a good indication that the results discussed here apply quite generally to glassy materials , and the polymer - specific aspects of the dynamics are seen primarily in the displacements rather than the relaxation times .",

    "note that this does not imply that there are no residual effects of the step strain on the dynamics after the first hop has relaxed the local strain : the persistence time distribution @xmath22 is narrower than the first hop time distribution in an aging glass , therefore particles displaced by the deformation are more likely to hop again than those that have not . in the constant strain rate experiment",

    "account for the wide distribution of relaxation times @xcite , however the strain appears to be a better predictor of how these relaxation times are accelerated .    by tracking the individual particle relaxations ,",
    "our analysis permits direct observation of the narrowing of the relaxation time spectrum during creep and constant strain rate deformation , which previously was inferred only indirectly from stretched exponential fits to correlation functions @xcite .",
    "the strain - controlled acceleration factor also provides a simple , intuitive explanation for the narrowing : particles with long relaxation times experience more acceleration than particles that hop sooner simply because they experience more strain in the long period of time in between relaxations .",
    "alternatively , a step strain leads to a simple shift in the first hop times ( no narrowing ) , and no change at all to the persistence times .",
    "the fact that the persistence times are unchanged in the step strain protocol suggests that the strain at the microscopic level is released after a relaxation event , or reset to zero .",
    "this interpretation is further confirmed by the fact that the acceleration of the persistence times for the constant strain rate experiment is identical to that found for the first hop times if , instead of the total strain , the strain in between subsequent hops is taken to be the relevant mechanical parameter .",
    "our results do not imply that the average segmental dynamics in the glass should be monotonically increased with the strain . in their experiments measuring the segmental dynamics during creep at stresses above yield , lee et al",
    ".  found that the average segmental mobility increases with strain at first , becoming a maximum where the strain rate was largest , and then decreases again in the strain hardening regime @xcite .",

    "the advantage of molecular dynamics simulations is that the individual trajectories reveal exactly how much time has elapsed between local relaxations and thus how much strain has accumulated in each local region .",

    "the hop dynamics under deformation also provide some information about strain hardening in polymer glasses .",
    "we have tested two different chain lengths and find that the hop rate versus strain rate and the acceleration versus strain are identical for both chain lengths . even though strain hardening is significantly more pronounced in the long - chain glass",

    "this method requires throwing away most of the persistence time data , however , and is therefore only used to properly normalize the full distribution which includes all measured persistence times .",
