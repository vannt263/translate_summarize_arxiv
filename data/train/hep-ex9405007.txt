    "in this paper we show that the ratios of cumulant to factorial moments of the multiplicity distributions measured in @xmath0-collisions ( in the energy range from 22 to 91 gev ) and those given in @xmath1-collisions ( from about 24 to 900 gev ) exhibit , as a function of the rank , a peculiar behaviour which reproduces surprisingly well the qualitative features predicted by qcd calculations @xcite,@xcite for hard processes at asymptotic energies .",
    "the set of moments of the multiplicity distribution for particles produced in high energy collisions is as representative as the distribution itself .",
    "we shall use the normalized factorial moments @xmath2 defined as @xmath3 ( where @xmath4 is the probability of @xmath5-particle events , @xmath6 is the mean multiplicity ) and the cumulant moments @xmath7 related to factorial moments by @xmath8 with @xmath9 and @xmath10 . for the poisson distribution , factorial moments are identically equal to 1 and all cumulants vanish for @xmath11 ( but @xmath12 ) .",
    "experimental distributions are usually much wider and moments increase with their rank quite fast . for this reason it is useful to consider the ratio @xmath13 whose asymptotic behaviour must be flatter .    the minimum of that ratio has been predicted at @xmath14 5 in next - to - next - to leading perturbative gluodynamics @xcite and later it has been shown @xcite that this ratio should reveal a sequence of negative minima and positive maxima , as the ever higher order solution of the non - linear equation for the generating functions of multiplicity distributions in gluodynamics .",
    "the role of quark degrees of freedom has been shown @xcite , @xcite to be not very important for the qualitative features .",
    "they persist in the exact solution of the qcd equations in case of fixed coupling constant as well [ 4 ] .",
    "we point out that neither a lower order qcd approximation such as double logarithmic approximation ( dla ) nor negative binomial distribution ( nbd ) favour such a peculiar behaviour @xcite,@xcite . on the contrary",
    "both of them imply that @xmath15 is a decreasing positive function tending at large @xmath16 asymptotically to zero as a power - like function .",
    "such decrease is monotonous both in nbd and in dla qcd ; however , some additional wiggles could be imposed on it if preasymptotic terms are added to the asymptotic dla formulae @xcite ( this effect is related to the narrowing of multiplicity in higher order qcd noticed in @xcite ) .",
    "thus the existence of the minima , their positions and the value of @xmath17 at those points indicate the importance of non - leading terms in the qcd cascade development .",
    "let us note that the sets of numbers @xmath18 are , formally speaking , equivalent .",
    "in practice , however , the patterns reflecting different dynamics could be easier revealed by plotting the most suitable of them on the corresponding scale .",
    "one knows , e.g. , that the tail of @xmath19 is better reproduced on log - scale while its behaviour near maximum is clearly seen on linear scale .",
    "even more sensitive to that tail is the behaviour of factorial and cumulant moments at high ranks .",
    "nevertheless there is no clear qualitative distinction between the ever increasing factorial moments in higher order perturbative qcd results and nbd with properly chosen parameters even though the rate of increase and numerical values differ @xcite .",
    "the cumulant moments are much more sensitive to the tiny details of distributions and reveal qualitative difference between qcd and nbd predictions .",
    "their fast increase with the rank is somewhat damped if one uses their ratio to factorial moments .",
    "that is why it seems to be much more convenient to re - map the multiplicity distributions to the ratio @xmath17 .",
    "this ratio first appeared [ 1 ] quite naturally as a solution of the equation for the generating function in gluodynamics .",
    "it can be easily calculated from experimental data on multiplicity distribution @xmath19 by using ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) .",
    "therefore , we choose the ratio of cumulant to factorial moments @xmath17 as a more sensitive measure of multiplicity distributions and show its advantages in what follows .    in this paper the values of the ratios @xmath20 for multiplicity data from inelastic collisions covering @xmath0",
    "annihilation and hadron - hadron interaction at various energies are analyzed .",
    "a large representative sample of multiplicity data [ 6 - 16 ] has been collected from the wide available literature : due to the precision required to see the investigated features , the low statistics samples , yielding large error bars , have been disregarded and only papers reporting a detailed separation between elastic and inelastic data for low multiplicities have been taken into account .",
    "a list of the considered samples is given in table i. we do not attempt here the quantitative comparison with qcd predictions but focus our attention on the main qualitative features . for all the considered experimental multiplicity distributions , the ratio @xmath21 has been computed up to the 16-th order .",
    "comparisons with the nbd predictions have been done using the following relation obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath22    though the involved orders of magnitude of @xmath15 are interaction and energy dependent , the multiplicity distributions of both hadron - hadron collisions and @xmath0-annihilations give a qualitatively similar behaviour .    as a first example one may consider the outcomes of the @xmath0 91 gev delphi multiplicity distribution @xcite , plotted in fig.1 . due to the different order of magnitude involved here ,",
    "the low-@xmath16 and high-@xmath16 regions are plotted using different scales .",
    "the polyline in the upper right box displays , up to the fourth order , the abrupt descent of @xmath15 ( the scale is logarithmic ) . in the main reference frame two negative minima , ( at @xmath23 5 and 12 ) and two positive maxima ( at @xmath23 8 and 15 ) are shown .",
    "the @xmath15 value at the first minimum is @xmath24=@xmath25 .",
    "the nbd predictions are given by the dashed curve shown in fig .",
    "1 : the value used for the nbd parameter @xmath26 has been taken from ref .",
    "@xcite ( @xmath27=0.0411@xmath280.0012 ) .",
    "2 refers to the @xmath29 546 gev interaction outcomes from the ua5 collaboration @xcite .",
    "the main difference with respect to the previous case is the order of magnitude of minima and maxima , their absolute values are more than ten times larger ; for instance the value at the first minimum is @xmath30=@xmath31 .",
    "nonetheless , the same main characteristics found for the @xmath0 annihilation , i.e. the abrupt descent and the subsequent oscillations can be observed ( here minima are at @xmath23 6 and 12 , while maxima are at @xmath23 9 and 15 ) .",
    "again superimposed ( dashed curve ) are the nbd yields , here corresponding to the @xmath26 parameter given in reference @xcite ( @xmath26=3.69@xmath280.09 ) .",
    "the behaviour of the @xmath15 ratio vs. @xmath16 for the other @xmath0 and hadron - hadron experiments examined is reported in fig.s 3 and 4 respectively . in both the @xmath1 and @xmath0 outcomes , a steep descent , taking place at the lower moment orders and showing positive values ( @xmath32 positive ) ,",
    "is followed by a negative minimum ( for @xmath334 , 5 or 6 ) , then a sequence of oscillations begins .",
    "in all the cases at least two negative minima are shown .",
    "in all the outcomes with the exception of fig .",
    "3b , refering to the hrs collaboration data , the oscillations are slow and the distance between two subsequent minima is usually 5 to 8 ranks of moment .",
    "the close but not equal behaviour of the four lep experiments ( fig.s 3e-3h ) indicates the extreme sensitivity of the @xmath15 to slight differences among multiplicity distributions .",
    "though the features at different energies and for @xmath1 and @xmath0 interactions are qualitatively very similar , the order of magnitude of the oscillations differ of about a factor ten , being larger for the hadronic interactions .",
    "we performed this investigation prompted by the qcd prediction @xcite of the specific behaviour of the ratio @xmath15 of cumulant to factorial moments for multiplicity distributions , with a minimum at a well defined position which is uniquely determined by the qcd anomalous dimension [ 1 ] .",
    "early experimental outcomes , though not directly comparable with theory , raised the problem of the role in perturbative equations of higher order terms . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was proved that they could actually give rise to an oscillating behaviour .",
    "this peculiarity only appears in higher order approximations of qcd and is determined solely by the gauge theory parameters ( the value of the coupling constant and the number of active flavours ) and by the kernels of the equation for the generating functions .",
    "it has been confirmed by the exact solution of qcd equations for fixed coupling constant @xcite .",
    "we could expect such qualitative features to be appropriate for @xmath0-annihilation since the above prediction is valid for hard processes at high energies .",
    "our expectations have been confirmed .",
    "it is a surprise to observe similar features in soft @xmath1-collisions which are out of the scope of theoretical approximations of perturbative qcd for hard processes .",
    "we do not speculate whether this indicates the similarity of @xmath34- and @xmath35-channel cascading in both types of events and/or the early onset of the perturbative qcd regime but , at the same time , we are not able to conceal our thoughts along these lines .",
    "the quantitative difference between @xmath0 and @xmath1 distributions , however , should be studied more carefully . preliminary analysis of @xmath36-data ( which we do not discuss here ) implies new possibilities too .",
    "thus we must state that it is an initial stage of approach to the whole problem but the data presented here seem to suggest the following remarks : the proposed ratio @xmath15 is a sensitive measure of multiplicity distributions ; besides the observed minima in @xmath0 and @xmath1 processes it reveals some other peculiarities at higher @xmath16 which should be studied and helps distinguishing clearly various distributions which are hardly separated by considering factorial moments only . in particular nbd predictions for @xmath15",
    "are found to disagree from experimental data : to some degree such a failure was expected in full - phase space inclusive data ; to the comparison of the @xmath15 behaviour with nbd predictions in restricted phase - space regions and fixed jet multiplicity samples a dedicated work will be devoted @xcite .",
    "furthermore the qualitative behaviour of @xmath17 is conserved for different processes in wide energy intervals so that one can think of an approximate scaling of @xmath17 ; nonetheless quantitative differences in the size of minima are observed and the problem of asymptotics should be considered in more details .",
    "experimental data on @xmath15 in various processes seems to provide a guide for further theoretical investigations and developments .",
