    "an old idea of colliding of the electron beam from a linac with a beam stored in a ring [ 1 ] is widely discussed during the last decade with two purposes :    \\1 ) to achieve the tev energy scale in lepton - hadron and photon - hadron collisions ( see review articles [ 2 ] and references therein ) ,    \\2 ) to construct high luminosity particle factories , namely , b - factory [ 3 ] , @xmath7-factory [ 4,5 ] , @xmath8-factory [ 6 ] etc .    concerning the first direction , tesla@xmath9hera based @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 colliders",
    "are included in tesla project [ 7 ] . and , linac@xmath14lhc based @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath15 @xmath13 and @xmath16 colliders [ 8 ] can be considered as the next step . on the other hand ,",
    "linac - ring type b - factory lose its attractiveness with coming into operation of kek - b [ 9 ] and pep - b [ 10 ] colliders .    in this paper , we show that linac - ring type particle factories still is the matter of interest taking in mind @xmath17 charm and @xmath3 options . in section 2",
    ", we present a general consideration of beam dynamics aspects of linac - ring type colliders .",
    "proposed parameters for linac - ring type @xmath2 factory are given in section 3a where we also compare it with da@xmath18ne [ 11 ] .",
    "linac - ring type charm and @xmath3 factories are discussed in sections 3b and 3c respectively . in the final section ,",
    "we give some concluding remarks .",
    "from the point of view of particle physics there are two most important collider parameters : center of mass energy and luminosity .",
    "for ultra - relativistic colliding beams , center of mass energy is given by    @xmath19    in our case , e@xmath20 is the energy of electrons accelerated in linac and e@xmath21 is the energy of positrons stored in ring . for @xmath2 and charm factories ,",
    "it is important to have @xmath22 in order to use the advantage of resonant production of @xmath2 and @xmath23 mesons : @xmath24 mev  with @xmath25 mev and @xmath26 mev with @xmath27 mev [ 12 ] .",
    "this condition is not so crucial for @xmath3 factory because of pair production of @xmath3 leptons .",
    "the luminosity of @xmath0 collisions is given by    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is number of electrons per bunch , @xmath30 is number of positrons per bunch , @xmath31 are horizontal and vertical beam sizes , @xmath32 is collision frequency .",
    "luminosity enhancement factor which is calculated by using guinea - pig beam- beam simulation program [ 13 ] .",
    "the first restrictive limitation for electron beam is beam power    @xmath34    which determines the maximum value of @xmath35 in eq .",
    "the maximum number of electrons per bunch is determined by the beam - beam tune shift limit of the positron beam    @xmath36 where @xmath37 m is the classical radius of the electron , @xmath38 is the lorentz factor of the positron beam and @xmath39 is beta function at collision point .",
    "generally accepted beam - beam tune shift value for positrons in case of ring - ring colliders is @xmath40 this limit value can be a little bit larger for linac - ring type colliders .",
    "parameters of positron beams are constrained by the disruption d of electrons which is  defined as the ratio of the positron bunch length to the electron focal length    @xmath41    where @xmath42 is the lorentz factor of the electron beam and @xmath43 is the positron bunch length . in this study",
    "we consider the round beam case : @xmath44 and @xmath45 the analysis performed for linear colliders shows that @xmath46 is acceptable [ 14 ] .",
    "in order to make the linac - ring type @xmath2 factory feasible , its luminosity should exceed the luminosity of da@xmath18ne ( operating standard ring - ring type @xmath2 factory at frascati ) at least by one order .",
    "the design luminosity of da@xmath18ne is 5.3@xmath48 @xmath49 , however only @xmath501.8@xmath51@xmath49 has been achieved since start in 1999 [ 11 ] .",
    "therefore , @xmath505@xmath52 @xmath49 for linac - ring type machine will be quite enough , even if the design luminosity value would be achieved in da@xmath18ne . in table",
    "i , we present proposed parameters for a number of linac - ring type @xmath2 factory options . concerning the energy of e@xmath53 and e@xmath54 beams , we consider two options e@xmath55 mev and 260 mev ( according to eq .",
    "( 1 ) , e@xmath56  gev and 1 gev , respectively ) .",
    "as mentioned in section ii , in the case of @xmath2 and charm factories , it is important to obey condition @xmath57 the expected luminosity spectrum @xmath58 for option c in table i is plotted in figure 1 .",
    "we have used guinea - pig simulation program [ 13 ] with @xmath59 one can see that center of mass energy spread is well below @xmath60 mev . therefore , we can use the well known breit - wigner formula @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the branching fractions of the resonance into the entrance and exit channels . branching fractions for different decay modes of the @xmath2 meson",
    "[ 12 ] are given in table ii .",
    "according to eq .",
    "( 6 ) we expect about 4@xmath64events per working year ( 10@xmath65 s ) .",
    "number of events for different decay modes are presented in the last column of table ii .",
    "recently cleo - c ( see [ 15 ] and references therein ) proposal has been approved in order to explore the charm sector starting early 2003 . with a necessary upgrade , expected machine performance for cleo - c will be 3@xmath66@xmath49 at @xmath67 gev . in table iii ,",
    "we present proposed parameters for three different linac - ring type charm factory options .",
    "as one can see , @xmath68@xmath49 can be achieved which exceeds the cleo - c design luminosity by more than an order .    in figure 2",
    ", we plot expected luminosity spectrum for option c from table iii .",
    "it is seen that center of mass energy spread is well below @xmath69 mev . using the eq .",
    "( 6 ) with replacement of @xmath70 to @xmath71 and @xmath72 we obtain the expected number of @xmath23 per working year , which is about 10@xmath73 let us mentioned that @xmath74 mode is the dominant one for @xmath23 decays .",
    "an additional advantage of the proposed charm factory is the asymmetric kinematics",
    ". this feature will be important in investigations of @xmath75 oscillations and cp - violations in charmed particle decays .",
    "the cross section of the process @xmath77 for @xmath78 is given by    @xmath79    where @xmath80 and @xmath81 is the fine structure constant .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath82 nb is achieved at @xmath83 gev . in difference from @xmath2 and charm factories , in the case of @xmath3-factory we have consider the symmetric option ( e@xmath84e@xmath85 gev ) .",
    "proposed set of parameters is given in table iv .",
    "one can see that linac - ring type @xmath3-factory will produce  @xmath86 @xmath87 pair per working year , which exceeds by two order the statistics obtained at lep and cleo up to now .",
    "we have shown that linac - ring type machines will give an opportunity to achieve @xmath68 @xmath5s@xmath6 , which essentially exceeds the luminosity values of existing and proposed standard ( ring - ring type ) @xmath2 , charm and @xmath3 factories .",
    "this leads to an obvious advantage in search for rare decays .",
    "another important feature of linac - ring type @xmath2 and charm factories is the asymmetric kinematics .",
    "this will be important in investigation of oscillations and cp - violation in strange and charm sector of the sm .",
