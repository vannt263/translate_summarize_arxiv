    "in many protocols of quantum information processing , it is crucial to transmit the quantum state of qubits with high fidelity @xcite .",
    "while various schemes of quantum state transfer ( qst ) were proposed and demonstrated experimentally @xcite for the optical system even with atom ensemble @xcite , people have tried the best to implement this task based on the solid - state systems , which are believed as the best candidates for the scalable quantum computing @xcite .",
    "it was recognized that the quantum spin chain @xcite and the bloch electron system @xcite with the artificial nearest neighbor ( nn ) couplings can be used as quantum data buses to transfer quantum information perfectly . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we discovered that the spectrum - parity matching is responsible for the perfectness of most protocols of qst .",
    "however , these solid - state based schemes for implementing quantum data bus are too artificial with very specially designed nn couplings and only single - particle cases were considered .",
    "though it is believed that such an engineered quantum system will be realized in the future experiments , at least , this difficulty should be overcome in theoretical aspect . to this end , we have tried to employ the higher - dimensional system or the complicated quantum network , such as the spin ladder @xcite . though the spin ladder is not an ideal medium serving as a perfect data bus , it shows that the long - distance qst is possible via the multi - exciton system due to the existence of the spin gap , which is much larger than the coupling strength connecting two separated qubits to the two ends of the ladder respectively .",
    "a medium can be a robust quantum data bus if the fidelity of transferring a quantum state between two sites attached to it approaches unity at a finite temperature .",
    "these consideration motivates us to use more natural energy gapped materials to act as a quantum data bus . in this paper",
    ", we study the function of quantum data bus for the conducting polymers ( polyacetylene ) , modeled as a peierls distorted tight - binding chain ( pdtbc ) or the su - schrieffer - heeger ( ssh ) model  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that , taking the coupling between electron and photon into account , such a system exhibits an instability against the lattice distortion , which induces an energy gap for the spectrum in half - filled case as a result of dimerization .",
    "therefore , the ssh chain is a good candidate of quantum data bus for fermion , which is just similar to the spin ladder for spin @xcite .",
    "furthermore , such a practical system allows us to investigate the case with larger particle number by performing analytical analysis for the two distant separated probe points @xmath2 since the ssh model can be solved exactly .",
    "being ( b ) odd and ( c ) even . , width=6 ]    as a protocol for the quantum communication with always - on interaction , two points @xmath0 and @xmath1 are connected to two sites of the ssh chain ( see the fig .",
    "1(a ) ) . for the half - filled case ,",
    "when the connections of @xmath0 and @xmath3  with ssh chain are switched off , the ground states are two - fold degenerate due to the vanishing on - site chemical potential . when the connections switch on , the two degenerate levels split while the eigenstates remain nearly half - filled for the subsystem @xmath2  due to the energy gap of the ssh chain .",
    "it leads to the effective interaction between @xmath0  and @xmath1 .",
    "thus the level spacing of two lowest eigenstates directly corresponds to the effective hopping integral between @xmath0  and @xmath1  and determines the validity of quantum state transfer via such a medium . generally ,",
    "if the energy gap is large enough , an effective hamiltonian @xmath4  of these two sites is induced by this quantum data bus to perform perfect qst at low temperature .",
    "thus the validity of @xmath4  and the behavior of the effective hopping integral ( level spacing of two lowest eigenstates ) as the distance between @xmath5 and @xmath1  increases  are crucial for the quality of a quantum data bus . to demonstrate the properties of our scheme , we compare the eigenstates of @xmath6  with those reduced density matrices from the ground and the first excited states of the total system .",
    "* *  * * we find that the peierls energy gap of the ssh chain plays an important role in protecting the robustness of the qst .",
    "the main conclusions are achieved both with the analytical study and numerical calculation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , the model setup of our protocol and the spectrum of ssh chain are introduced . as a reasonable approximation up to second order , the effective hamiltonian @xmath4 with respect to the two separated points @xmath0 and @xmath1",
    "is deduced by using the frhlich transformation @xcite to remove  the degree of freedom of ssh model in sec .",
    "iii . in sec .",
    "iv , the density matrices of qubits @xmath0 and @xmath1 for the ground and the first excited states of the whole system are calculated to demonstrate the quantum entanglement of them over a long distance .",
    "the qst scheme is also investigated numerically in the region of the crossover between two types of dimerization .",
    "it shows that , at this transition point , the qst becomes fastest , but with the similar lost of fidelity to what has been discussed in the ref . @xcite . in sec.v , we  discuss the quantum decoherence problem due to the quasi - excitations of the ssh chain at finite temperature .",
    "the summary and remarks are presented finally in sec .",
    "in a polyacetylene , @xmath7-electrons , which are localized between the two bonded nuclei , connect one @xmath8 atom with the neighboring two @xmath8 and one @xmath9 atoms to form an elementary linear configuration ; @xmath10-electrons , which are less localized , behave as bloch electrons .",
    "such a system can be treated by using tight - binding approximation and @xmath10-electrons can be the candidate as a carrier of quantum information @xcite . here , we also consider the coupling between electrons and dispersionless phonons represented by local oscillators .",
    "let @xmath11 be the displacement of the @xmath12th @xmath13 ( the unit of a polyacetylene ) from the equilibrium position .",
    "then , the tight - binding hamiltonian reads as @xmath14where @xmath15\\]]describes the lattice motion . here , @xmath16 is the hopping integral and @xmath17 is the electron - lattice coupling constant .",

    "@xmath20 is the spring constant due to @xmath7-electrons , and @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) is annihilation ( creation ) operator of @xmath10-electrons on site @xmath23 with spin @xmath24 .",
    "this hamiltonian is proposed by su , schrieffer and heeger @xcite to describe the dimerization phenomenon of the polyacetylene in association with its conductivity .    in our scheme",
    ", we consider the qst between sites @xmath0 and @xmath1 connected to the two sites of the ssh chain .",
    "our purpose is to transfer a qubit state , which is in a superposition state of electron spin up and spin down , through the hopping of an polarized electron from the site @xmath0 to @xmath1 ( see the fig .",
    "since the hamiltonian ( [ hssh ] ) does not  contain spin dependent interaction , the spin polarization of every electron is conservative . in this sense",
    ", the spatial motion of electrons along the chain will carry a spin state from one location to another .",
    "thus , we can study the fidelity of spin state transfer by considering the fidelity of charge state transfer .",
    "the connection of sites @xmath0 and @xmath1 to the ssh chain is described by thehamiltonian @xmath25where @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) are annihilation ( creation ) operators of electrons on sites @xmath0 and @xmath1 with spin @xmath7 , while @xmath30 and @xmath31 denote the connecting sites in the ssh chain .     and @xmath1.,width=6 ]    in fig .",
    "2 , we intuitively demonstrate how the above hamiltonian can lead to the effective hopping of electron between the additional sites @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we will also show how the effective hopping integral depends on the distance between them .",
    "the original energy degeneracy at @xmath32 of the subsystem formed by @xmath0 and @xmath1 will be removed by the switching on @xmath33 and then split into two sub - levels with the level spacing @xmath34 .",
    "here , @xmath35 is the effective hopping integral , which can be obtained analytically as follows .    to consider how a ssh chain can be used as a quantum data bus to transfer a quantum state , we first summarize the known results about diagonalization of the ssh hamiltonian .",
    "the most important discovery is the prediction about the peierls transition happens when the polyacetylene is dimerized as @xmath36 .",
    "it minimizes the energy of the one - dimensional electronic gas when the lattice vibrates slowly  so that the born - oppenheirmer approximation can determine an instantaneous eigen energy of electron  for a fixed lattice configuration .",
    "after dimerization , the hamiltonian then  reads @xmath37 \\left ( c_{n+1,\\sigma } ^{\\dagger } c_{n,\\sigma } + h.c.\\right ) + e_{0}\\text{,}\\]]where @xmath38 denotes the distortion of the hopping integral  and @xmath39 is a constant .",
    "taking periodic boundary condition , it can be diagonalized as @xmath40with the dispersion relation @xmath41for the excitations described by the fermion operators @xmath42and @xmath43where @xmath44 is the number of @xmath13 in polyacetylene chain ( or the length of the chain ) , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 \\text{.}\\]]the single - particle spectrum ( [ dispersion ] ) is illustrated in the fig .",
    "2(a ) and the energy gap between the two bands is@xmath48    in next section , we will show that such an energy gap is necessarily required for a desirable robust quantum data bus for qst .",
    "usually , as illustrated in fig .",
    "2(b ) , the large energy gap above the lowest two levels can provide a kind of quantum protectfor the qst via the virtual excitations of the quantum data bus , which induce a long range hopping of electron between sites @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the low temperature .",
    "the dense continuity of spectrum above the gap ensures that the strength of the effective hopping integral across @xmath0 and @xmath1 is so strong that the fast entanglement can be generated . in the following",
    ", we will demonstrate that such a dimerized gap plays a same role for qst as the spin gap in spin ladder @xcite .",
    "to deduce the effective hamiltonian about the indirect coupling between two attached sites @xmath0 and @xmath1 , we utilize the frhlich transformation , whose original approach was used successfully for the bcs theory of superconductivity .",

    "when the lower quasi - band is filled fully , the next excitation should jump over the gap and then virtual excitations can effectively induce the effective coupling . to demonstrate the above result about the effective long range hopping induced by the ssh chain , we schematically  sketch the virtual process  in fig .",
    "3 , where the quanta of data bus between the two sites are exchanged . if the energy gap of the pdtbc is much larger than the connection couplings , @xmath66 , the virtual transition is essentially second order process .",
    "there are two kinds of virtual process for an initially half - filled state of the pdtbc .",
    "the first one happens via the exchange of the electron in the upper quasi - band , while the second one is based on the exchange of the hole in the lower quasi - band .",
    "we would like to remind that the two quasi - bands will become continuous in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "nevertheless , there still exists indirect interaction between @xmath0 and @xmath1 as the effective results of the second order process .     and the upper quasi - band and ( b ) holes between lower quasi - band and @xmath67 .",

    "obviously , the effective electron - phonon coupling @xmath205 can only lead to a phase shift in the spin qubit initially prepared in the quasi - spin states@xmath206it is also pointed out that the ground state ( an eigenstate of the quasi - spin @xmath207 ) of the effective hamiltonian  is a mode entanglement state .",
    "we consider the vibration mode initially prepared in a thermal equilibrium state @xmath208at the temperature @xmath209 , where the partition function is@xmath210and @xmath211 is the boltzman constant .",

    "this result shows that thermal excitation of the phonons will block a perfect qst to some extent and this effect becomes prominent as the distance between @xmath0  and @xmath1increases*. * to consider the extent of this influence about the qst scheme based on the ssh chain , we can calculate the fidelity or the purity @xmath227:$ ] @xmath228 \\label{qqq}\\]]with the ideal state@xmath229the eq .",
    "( [ qqq ] ) shows the intrinsic relation between the purity and the decoherence factor .",
    "actually the off - diagonal elements are responsible for the intrinsic physics of  qst , because the time evolution driven by @xmath4 for @xmath0 and @xmath1 will stop if off - diagonal elements vanish .",

    "in this paper we proposed a qst scheme based on a desirable quantum data bus , which can be implemented by a more practical system , the conducting polymers ( polyacetylene ) modeled as a ssh chain .",
    "this system serves as a quantum data bus with the following advantages .",
    "firstly , the strength of the induced effective hopping of a qubit between two distant sites does not decay rapidly over the distance between them , and thus it can realize a fast quantum entanglement to transfer quantum information with the always - on coupling and minimal control . secondly , there exists an energy gap to ensure the virtual excitation of the electrons in the ssh chain which induces the effective hopping of a qubit between two distant sites , but does not dissipate their energy .",
    "this shows the similar results to that of the spin ladder @xcite .",
    "thus a higher fidelity can be achieved for our qst scheme based on the virtual excitation of the ssh chain in lower temperature .",
    "technologically , the more natural and less artificial designs with practical modulation about coupling constants for our protocol push the studies of qst based on real physical solid state system .    furthermore , based on the analytical and numerical results",
