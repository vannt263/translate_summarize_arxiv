    "the discovery of the first  tev @xmath0-ray source ( the crab nebula ) in 1989 by the whipple collaboration @xcite initiated a fast development of ground - based @xmath0-ray astronomy .",
    "the imaging air cherenkov technique has been successfully used since the first source was discovered .",
    "imaging air cherenkov telescope ( iact ) measure the cherenkov light from extensive air showers ( eas ) .",
    "the cherenkov photons that are reflected by the telescope mirror are recorded by a matrix of photomultipliers ( the so - called telescope camera ) mounted in the focal plane of iact .",
    "the shower image that is formed in the camera is a two dimensional angular distribution of the cherenkov light .",
    "the number of the registered hadron induced events ( the so - called background ) is several orders of magnitude larger than the number of the registered @xmath0-rays events from a source . in 1985",
    "hillas proposed a method to select @xmath0 rays out of a hadron dominated event sample @xcite .",
    "this method is based on parametrization of the recorded shower image .",
    "the arrival direction of the primary particle is determined by the direction of the image main axis for the data taken with a single iact and by the intersection of the major axes of both recorded images for a stereo observation .",
    "main axes of the primary @xmath0-ray images from point - like source are directed to the source position on the camera , while the hadronic background is isotropically distributed .",
    "the @xmath0/hadron separation methods which are used now are more sophisticated ( such as @xcite ) , but most of them are still based upon the original hillas parameters .",
    "currently operating observatories , such as h.e.s.s .",
    "@xcite , magic @xcite and veritas @xcite use arrays of iacts with large mirror areas .",
    "the potential sources of the @xmath0 rays are observed in stereo mode , in order to improve the sensitivity of telescopes . the cherenkov telescope array ( cta ) collaboration @xcite plans to build arrays of telescopes with different sizes to measure the fluxes of @xmath0-ray sources in a large energy range from a few tens of  gev to hundreds of  tev .",
    "the detection of a low energy showers is possible by using very large telescopes , with a parabolic shape that avoid broadening of the time profile of the cherenkov signal .",
    "it has been shown , based on real data ( see e.g. @xcite ) , that the @xmath0/hadron separation in iacts becomes much more difficult below 100  gev .",
    "this is motivated by a few effects . at first",
    ", larger fluctuations of the cherenkov light density at ground are expected in a low energy region @xcite which results in larger fluctuations of the image parameters .",
    "second , the geomagnetic field influences the image parameters @xcite .",
    "thirdly , iacts can be triggered by a primary electron or positron initiated shower @xcite .",
    "there are no physical reasons for the differences between the images of a pure electromagnetic subcascade induced by a primary @xmath0 ray and by an electron",
    ". therefore this kind of background can not be rejected by using the hillas parameters describing the image shape .",
    "fourthly , it has been suggested in @xcite and shown in @xcite that a specific type of hardly reducible background occurs when observing the low energy region : telescopes can be triggered by light produced by electrons and positrons from only one or two electromagnetic subcascades , which are products of a single @xmath2 decay in the hadron initiated shower .",
    "shower images formed by cherenkov photons from a single electromagnetic subcascade can be called false @xmath0-ray events because they have a very similar shape to the primary @xmath0-ray images .",
    "these false @xmath0-ray images can be slightly narrower because they start deeper in the atmosphere than real @xmath0 rays .",
    "therefore a narrower angular distribution of secondary @xmath3 and @xmath4 is expected ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the efficiency of the @xmath0/hadron separation method , based on the parameters describing the image shape , deteriorate at low energy due to the occurrence of the false @xmath0-ray events .",
    "however , the orientation of the major image axis of the false @xmath0-ray events is randomly distributed .",
    "therefore parameters , that determine the shower direction , are still effective variables for the primary @xmath0-rays selection .",
    "the results presented in this paper are based on the monte carlo ( mc ) simulations for a system of four iacts .",
    "we investigate the impact of the occurrence of false @xmath0-ray events on the efficiency of the @xmath0/hadron separation .",
    "the results were obtained for : i ) two hadron interaction models ( gheisha and fluka ) ; ii ) two different altitudes of the observatory ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 a.s.l . ) ; iii ) three azimuth angles of @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 ; iv ) three different telescope areas ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) . in the following",
    "we present the mc study and show the fraction of the false @xmath0-ray candidates in the proton initiated showers for different multiplicities of triggered telescopes .",
    "the fraction of single electromagnetic subcascade in the total proton background is estimated for energy range larger than used in the simulations .",
    "this fraction is calculated for different trigger thresholds .",
    "we show how the contribution of single electromagnetic subcascade in the triggered proton events depends on the average of size ( this is the sum of all signals from pixels which belongs the image ) .",
    "the scaled width , scaled length @xcite and the height of the shower maximum are applied for the selection of @xmath0 rays out of the hadron induced showers .",
    "we calculate the quality factor ( qf ) in order to demonstrate the @xmath0-ray selection efficiency .",
    "the strong anti - correlation between qf and the contribution of the false @xmath0 rays was found for all simulated sets of the parameters of the iact system .",
    "therefore , the occurrence of the false @xmath0-ray events is an important reason of the reduction of the @xmath0/hadron separation efficiency in the range of small average sizes .",
    "finally in the conclusions , we compare the results which were obtained from different interaction models , altitudes of the observatory and telescope sizes .",
    "and @xmath6 , respectively.,width=264 ]    the investigated system of iacts contains four telescopes placed in the corners of a diamond having a side length of @xmath13 and diagonals of @xmath13 and @xmath14 and with the altitude of the observation equal to @xmath5 a.s.l .",
    "( see filled circles in figure 1 ) .",
    "both the altitude of the observatory and the distance between the two closest telescopes has been chosen as they are for the actual magic telescopes configuration @xcite .",
    "the strength and direction of the geomagnetic field is fixed to that at magic site ( la palma ) .",
    "the side length of the diamond and the distance between the two closest telescopes are reduced to @xmath15 for the simulated altitude equal to @xmath6 a.s.l .",
    "( see open circles in fig .  1 ) .",
    "each simulated telescope is very similar to the magic telescope @xcite .",
    "it has a parabolic shape with a focal length of @xmath16 .",
    "the mirror dish has a diameter of @xmath16 .",
    "the total reflector area covers approximately @xmath10 .",
    "the camera has hexagonal shape that covers in total almost @xmath17 .",
    "it consists of 1141 photomultipliers ( pmt ) with the diameter of @xmath18 .",
    "631  pixels ( in the inner part of the camera ) are used for the trigger .",
    "the trigger requires a time coincidence and neighbour logic .",
    "all four telescopes from the system are exactly the same .",
    "the simulations of telescopes smaller than @xmath10 were obtained by reducing only the mirror area of the described above iact . in reality ,",
    "smaller telescopes are designed with smaller focal length as the davies - cotton design @xcite ( e.g. @xmath19 iacts in h.e.s.s . ) to avoid the so - called coma effect , which is observed for a telescope with the parabolic shape . in cases of the davies - cotton design",
    "one may expect higher trigger rate and better hillas parameter determinations for both hadron and @xmath0-ray events .",
    "however , the assumption of smaller telescope area adopted in this paper leads to reducing of the coma effect .",
    "therefore , it is good approximation to demonstrate the impact of telescope size on single electromagnetic subcascade effects .",
    "the shower development in the atmosphere was simulated using the corsika code @xcite .",
    "two corsika versions 6.023 and 6.99 have been used . in the version 6.023",
    "the gheisha @xcite and venus @xcite interaction models have been applied for the low ( i.e. for particles with primary momentum below 80  gev / c ) and high energy ranges . in the version 6.99 fluka @xcite and qgsjet - ii @xcite",
    "have been used as the low and high energy interaction models , respectively .",
    "the standard corsika code has been adapted in order to study the single subcascade events in the proton initiated shower .",
    "the information about each subcascade that has been produced in the eas was kept in modified code .",
    "additionally , the type of the charged particle , which was responsible for the creation of cherenkov photons , was also saved in the output of the program .",
    "showers initiated by primary protons were simulated in the energy range between 30  gev and 1  tev with a differential spectral index of -2.75 ( which is the index of the primary proton spectrum @xcite ) .",
    "the impact parameter was distributed randomly within a circle of 1.2  km radius ( measured in the plane perpendicular to the shower axis ) around the geometrical center of the telescopes system .",
    "the proton induced showers were simulated within a cone with a half - opening angle of @xmath20 at a zenith angle of @xmath21 .",
    "the impact parameter was randomly distributed within a circle of @xmath22 radius for the simulations of showers induced by the primary @xmath0 rays that have an energy range between 10  gev and 1  tev .",
    "the differential spectral index was chosen to be equal to -2.6 ( which corresponds to the index of the crab spectrum @xcite ) .",
    "the direction of the @xmath0-ray showers was fixed to a zenith angle equal to @xmath21 that is also the direction of the axes of all telescopes .",
    "seven sets of simulations were performed : ( i ) one using fluka and qgsjet - ii as hadron interaction models ( code version from 2011 ) ; ( ii , iii and iv ) three for different azimuth angles ( @xmath7 - showers directed to the north , @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) using the gheisha and venus as the hadron interaction models ; ( v ) one for the altitude of the observatory equal to @xmath6 a.s.l . ; ( vi and vii ) two for smaller telescope sizes ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) .",
    "different azimuth angles were simulated in order to show how the geomagnetic field influences the occurrence of false @xmath0-ray events .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that the effects of geomagnetic field are scaled by the component of b that is perpendicular to the shower axis ( @xmath23 ) .",

    ". additionally in this program , rayleigh and mie scattering of cherenkov light in the atmosphere were taken into account according to the sokolsky formula @xcite .",
    "the camera properties , such as additional reflections in winston cones , photocathode quantum efficiency @xcite and its fluctuation , and the photoelectron collection efficiency were considered in the second part of detector simulations .",
    "the level of the night sky background ( nsb ) has been chosen to that measured at la palma @xcite .",
    "the nsb was included in the simulation for the trigger conditions only . in reality photoelectrons ( p.e . ) produced by light of the nsb are randomly distributed over all pixels of the camera . due to that",
    ", all pixels which contain only the signals from nsb should be subtracted before calculating the parameters of the shower image .",
    "the commonly used cleaning procedure neglects pixels with signals smaller than chosen values for the core and boundary pixels , which belong to the image .",
    "the efficiency of the separation between real and false @xmath0-ray events may depend on both nsb and cleaning levels .",
    "the results obtained without the nsb light and cleaning are more general because they do not depend on observation conditions and the particular cleaning procedure .",
    "a single telescope was triggered by a shower if the output signals in three next neighbouring pixels ( 3  nn ) exceed a certain threshold within a time window of 3 ns . 3  nn trigger logic was applied in all simulations presented in this paper . in reality , different trigger multiplicity might be used for observations with a large single iact .",
    "the simulated pulse of a single photoelectron has a full width at half maximum equal to 3 ns .",

    "finally the possible coincidences between triggers of 2 , 3 or 4 telescopes were also checked .",
    "in the results presented below we call false @xmath0-ray events ( or images ) that fulfilled conditions : i ) the light contribution from the hadronic and muonic part of the shower is less than 10@xmath1 of the image size , ii ) the rest of the image size is the light contribution from a single electromagnetic subcascade in the proton induced shower , regardless of the number of triggered telescopes . according to this definition , a single photoelectron from other electromagnetic subcascades can not give the contribution to recorded images .",

    "they are applied to the calculations of the width@xmath29 and length@xmath29 for the images of @xmath0-ray and proton initiated showers . as a result ,",
    "the width@xmath29 and length@xmath29 distributions of the @xmath0-ray initiated showers are gaussian distributions with mean equal to 0 and dispersion equal to 1 . for each shower which triggered the system , the mean width@xmath29 ( @xmath27width@xmath29@xmath28 ) and mean length@xmath29 ( @xmath27length@xmath29@xmath28 ) were calculated from scaled parameters obtained from each recorded image .",
    "the distributions of the @xmath27width@xmath29@xmath28 and @xmath27length@xmath29@xmath28 parameters are presented in figure 6a and 6b for at least two triggered telescopes at the trigger threshold equal to 3  p.e .. the results of mc set ii are plotted as an example .",
    "the histograms of all triggered events for primary @xmath0 ray ( dashed black ) and proton ( solid grey ) are normalized to  1 .",
    "appropriate factors were used to scale the histograms of the false @xmath0-ray events .",
    "the distribution of false @xmath0-ray images ( solid black ) is shifted towards lower @xmath27width@xmath29@xmath28 in comparison to the real @xmath0-ray events , because the detected false @xmath0-ray events are subcascades which begin deeper in the atmosphere .",
    "therefore , the observed parts of electromagnetic cascade are younger and the angular distributions of electrons and positrons are narrower than in the showers initiated by primary @xmath0 rays ( see e.g. @xcite )",
    ". it can be seen in figure 6 , that one can expect very low efficiency of the primary @xmath0-rays selection from false @xmath0-ray events if the width@xmath29 and length@xmath29 parameters only are used in the separation method .         the height of the shower maximum ( h@xmath30 ) can be used to separate @xmath0 rays from proton events @xcite .",
    "the distributions of the h@xmath30 parameter ( in km a.s.l . ) obtained from mc set ii are presented in figure 6c for at least two triggered iacts at the trigger threshold of 3  p.e .. the height of the shower maximum is a good parameter to use in the @xmath0/hadron separation .",
    "however , there is no clear separation between real and false @xmath0-ray results .",
    "therefore , the real and false @xmath0-ray events can not be effectively distinguished by using the height of the shower maximum .",
    "the occurrence of the false @xmath0-ray events affects the efficiency of the @xmath0/hadron separation . in order to estimate this effect quantitatively ,",
    "whole sample of triggered events was split into five intervals of @xmath27size@xmath28 .",

    "primary @xmath0-ray candidates are selected as events that fulfilled conditions : i ) have all recorded images with width@xmath29 and length@xmath29 in the range between -1.5 and 1.5 , ii ) have the height of the shower maximum above 9.5  km  a.s.l .. the estimated energy of primary @xmath0 rays ( e@xmath31 ) that correspond to each @xmath27size@xmath28 interval is given in the table 2 for different simulation sets .",

    "we have check that the qf obtained for different azimuth angles ( i.e. different @xmath23 ) do not differ in contrast to the results presented in @xcite .",

    "the ratio between qf and the maximal value of qf ( qf@xmath30 ) is shown as a function of the contribution of the false @xmath0-ray events ( see figure 7c ) .",
    "it can be seen , that the results of all mc sets contain the points with negligible contribution of false @xmath0-ray events ( points with coordinates close to ( 0,1 ) ) , except the altitude of the observatory equal to @xmath6 a.s.l .. therefore for this altitude , qf@xmath30 is underestimated because it was calculated from the sample of showers with the contribution of the false @xmath0-ray events approximately equal to 2@xmath1 .",
    "the most rapid reduction of a quality factor with the contribution of the false @xmath0-ray events is expected for iact system with the smallest telescopes ( diamonds ) . in this case",

    "correlation coefficient changes significantly with increase of the multiplicity of triggered telescopes from 1 to 4 . at the trigger threshold of 4  p.e .",
    "it varies from -0.95 to -0.5 and from -0.97 to -0.55 for the gheisha and fluka model , respectively . for the altitude of the observatory equal to @xmath6 ,",

    "calculated coefficient changed from -0.94 to -0.71 with decreasing the multiplicity of triggered telescopes from 1 to 3 .",

    "the occurrence of false @xmath0-ray events plays an important role in the observations using an imaging air cherenkov telescopes system .",
    "the study brought two important conclusions .",
    "first , this kind of background is mainly caused by proton induced showers with the primary energy below 200  gev .",
    "second , most of the false @xmath0-ray events have @xmath27size@xmath28 smaller 300  p.e .. both of those features do not depend on : the interaction model , altitude of the observatory and size of the telescope mirror .",
    "those conclusions are consistent with the results obtained for a smaller trigger area of the camera @xcite .",
    "the quality factor depends much stronger on the multiplicity of triggered telescopes than on the trigger threshold because the energy threshold of the iact system is more sensitive on the required number of triggered telescopes than on the trigger threshold .",
    "we have checked , that the effect of the false @xmath0-ray events does not depend on the geomagnetic field for @xmath23 in the range between 20 and 30 mt .",
    "the simulations presented in this paper allowed to compare the results obtained with two models of the hadron interactions .",
    "we have shown , that for the multiplicity of triggered iacts larger than 1 , there are not significant differences between results obtained using gheisha and fluka model . in case of at least one triggered iacts , both the estimated total trigger rate and the expected fraction of false @xmath0-ray events are larger for fluka than for gheisha model . in this case the contribution of the single electromagnetic subcascade events in each @xmath27size@xmath28 intervals is also slightly higher for the fluka model .",
    "comparison of the results for altitudes of @xmath5 and @xmath6 a.s.l .",
    "leads to the following conclusions .",
    "the system of iacts located at higher altitude can be triggered by protons at lower energies . due to that , the fraction of false @xmath0-ray events is significantly larger for altitude equal to @xmath6 than for @xmath5 , regardless on the multiplicity of triggered telescopes and trigger threshold .",
    "the contribution of single subcascade events in chosen interval of @xmath27size@xmath28 is also larger for iact system located at higher altitude . as a consequence ,",
    "the efficiency of the primary @xmath0-ray selection is lower for higher altitude of the observatory independently on the number of triggered telescopes .",
    "the system of iacts with smaller mirror areas can be triggered by proton showers at higher energies than in the case of a system with larger telescopes . as a result",
    "the fraction of single subcascade events also decreases significantly when the mirror area changes from @xmath10 to @xmath12 .",
    "however , for the multiplicity of triggered iacts lower than 3 the fraction obtained for @xmath10 at trigger threshold 5  p.e .",
    "is comparable with results for @xmath11 and @xmath12 at trigger threshold of 4  p.e . and 3  p.e .",
    ", respectively .",
    "the fraction of hardly reducible background for the observations with at least three or at least four triggered telescopes are not simply shifted in the trigger threshold level .",
    "the estimated fraction of the false @xmath0-ray events is negligible ( lower than 1@xmath1 ) for the multiplicity of triggered iacts larger than 2 and the mirror area equal to @xmath12 .",
    "telescopes with such mirror areas are proposed to be applied as the medium size telescopes ( mst ) in the cta project .",
    "the data taken by at least three msts should contain negligible fraction of the background caused by single electromagnetic subcascade events .",
    "we have shown that the efficiency of the @xmath0/hadron separation is strongly anti - correlated with the contribution of the false @xmath0-ray events in the proton induced showers . additionally , the occurrence of the false @xmath0-ray events has less influence on the data that are taken by at least 3 or 4 triggered telescopes because in this case , the system is triggered mostly by higher energy protons .",
    "the results presented in this paper were obtained using a basic reconstruction of the shower . a new , more sophisticated reconstruction algorithm may lead to better @xmath0/hadron separation .",
    "however , the occurrence of the false @xmath0-ray events is one of the main causes of the deterioration of both the @xmath0/hadron separation efficiency and as a result sensitivity of a system of iacts in the low energy range .",
