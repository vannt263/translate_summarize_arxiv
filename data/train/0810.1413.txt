    "the ability to maximize the spin - dephasing time @xmath0 of an electron spin ensemble is one of the key issues for developing semiconductor - based spintronic devices @xcite .",
    "however , in all iii - v semiconductor materials spin ensembles rapidly dephase due to the dyakonov - perel ( dp ) spin - dephasing mechanism @xcite . for the case of electron ensembles in a heterojunction two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) , two distinct contributions to dp spin - dephasing have to be considered : the inversion asymmetry of the confining potential ( structural inversion asymmetry ) and the bulk inversion asymmetry of the crystal lattice . the former results in an effective rashba field and the latter in an effective dresselhaus field , which includes linear and cubic contributions @xcite : @xmath1+\\hat{y}k_y[k_{z}^2-k_{x}^2]+\\hat{z}k_z[k_{x}^2-k_{y}^2]),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 , @xmath3 are the unit vectors along the [ 100 ] and [ 010 ] crystal directions , @xmath4 , @xmath5 are the components of the in - plane wave vector , and @xmath6 are the spin - orbit coupling parameters . the total effective spin - orbit field @xmath7 is the vector sum of all three contributions . for 2d and quasi-1d electron systems ,",
    "the direction and magnitude of these effective spin - orbit fields can be illustrated as arrows on the fermi circle .",
    "figure  [ 1 ] presents this for selected points in the 2d momentum space , for the rashba ( a ) and linear dresselhaus ( b ) field alone , and their sum ( c ) for the case of equal strength of rashba and linear dresselhaus field .",
    "in contrast to the individual cases ( figure  [ 1 ] ( a ) , ( b ) ) , the magnitude of the vector sum shows a strong anisotropy in momentum space ( figure  [ 1 ] ( c ) ) .",
    "-space , sketched for ( a ) the rashba field , ( b ) the linear dresselhaus field and for ( c ) the symmetric case of the sum of equal rashba and linear dresselhaus field .",
    "both the magnitude and direction are depicted as arrows on the fermi circle with radius @xmath8 in the ( @xmath9 , @xmath10)-plane.,width=302 ]    this already suggests that spin dephasing in very narrow wires in which electron motion is restricted to the [ 110 ] direction can be strongly reduced as compared free 2deg or such wires oriented along other crystal directions .",
    "however , it is harder to analyze whether such a dephasing anisotropy also occurs for wider quasi-1d wires , where the motion in the 2deg plane is still completely random and diffusive , but where the width of the wire is less than length scales as the spin precession length or the mean free path . for the latter case the transport regime",
    "could be named quasi - ballistic , but we consider the case of a large ensemble where transport along the wire is still diffusive , and where the width of the wire in the 2deg plane is much wider than the regime of quantum confinement .",
    "initial studies of such spin - dephasing anisotropy include a recent experiment @xcite on wires , and theoretical work on drifting ensembles in free 2deg @xcite .",
    "however , until now most emphasis was on work related to the spin field - effect transistor @xcite , using inas - based systems or highly asymmetrical heterojunctions , where structural inversion asymmetry dominates the spin - orbit interaction @xcite .",
    "+ we report here how the dyakonov - perel spin dephasing mechanism can be strongly suppressed in diffusive quasi-1d electron systems based on gaas heterojunction material , for which rashba and linear dresselhaus spin - orbit contributions can be indeed of comparable magnitude @xcite .",
    "the dephasing is studied for spin ensembles initially aligned perpendicular to the plane of the wire ( [ 001 ] direction ) .",
    "this situation reflects the method of preparing and interrogating a spin population via optical pump - probe techniques @xcite .",
    "our numerical calculation is first performed for conditions with equal rashba and linear dresselhaus contributions and the cubic dresselhaus term set to zero . for widths of the diffusive quasi-1d wires smaller than the spin precession length",
    "the dp spin - dephasing mechanism can be strongly suppressed and the spin - dephasing time @xmath11 is considerably enhanced if the wire is aligned along the direction of zero effective spin - orbit field .",
    "moreover , we want to point out that the value of our numerical tool lies in the opportunity to study such phenomena also for more realistic conditions .",
    "thus , we can study how breaking the equality of the rashba and linear dresselhaus spin - orbit fields , or adding the cubic dresselhaus term leads to a degradation of the spin - dephasing anisotropy .",
    "we apply a monte carlo method @xcite to study the temporal evolution of the normalized spin orientation ( average spin expectation value ) in an elongated quasi-1d wire .",
    "our numerical tool is based on a semiclassical approach .",
    "we use a classical description for the electron motion , and a quantum mechanical description of the dynamics of the electron spin .",
    "the wire is treated as a rectangular box of aspects 1 @xmath12 m and 200 @xmath12 m .",
    "the electron density and mobility are set to 4@xmath13 m@xmath14 and 100 m@xmath15/vs , which are typical values for a gaas / algaas heterojunction material .",
    "all electrons are assumed to have the same fermi velocity @xmath16 of 2.7@xmath17 m / s .",
    "this is a valid approximation for @xmath18 , @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 ( with respect to the bottom of the conduction band ) , where @xmath19 is the zeeman splitting due to the spin - orbit fields alone .",
    "electron - electron interaction and inelastic scattering mechanisms are neglected .",
    "+ the electron is regarded as a point particle which moves on a classical trajectory between scatter events on impurities ( randomly determined at a rate to obtain an average scatter time of 38 ps ) yielding diffusive behavior in the ensemble ( electron mean free path @xmath22 = @xmath23 = 10  @xmath12 m ) , and specular scattering on the edges of the wire . for each electron moving on such a ballistic trajectory",
    "we calculate the spin evolution in the effective spin - orbit fields quantum mechanically , and we then take the ensemble average on a set of electrons with random initial position and momentum direction .",
    "+ within a straight ballistic segment of an electron trajectory the spin rotates around @xmath7 over a precession angle given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the reduced planck s constant and @xmath26 the time of traveling through the segment . the spin rotation operator @xmath27 for rotation over the precession angle @xmath28 about the direction @xmath29 ( unit vector ) of the effective magnetic field @xmath7 is obtained by ( see e.g. @xcite )    @xmath30    where @xmath31 represents the vector of pauli spin matrices ( x , y , z components of the spin ) .",
    "@xmath27 acting on a spin state @xmath32 at the beginning of a ballistic trajectory yields the spin state @xmath33 at the end of the trajectory .",
    "thus , we can follow the spin state of each electron ( labeled @xmath34 ) , and we use this to define a semiclassical spin vector to present its orientation , @xmath35 from its spin expectation values in @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 directions .    for an electron experiencing multiple scattering events ,",
    "the orientation of the effective magnetic field is changed at each scatter event . for each trajectory",
    "a rotation is applied .",
    "once a scattering event takes place , the wave vector state is updated , @xmath7 is recalculated based on the new wave vector , resulting in a new rotation operator , and the evolution of the spin state will carry on .",
    "for spin ensembles , the randomization will bring a reduction of the normalized spin orientation ( average spin expectation value ) @xmath39 for the ensemble .",
    "@xmath40 is obtained by averaging over an ensemble of @xmath41 = 1000 spins , independent of their positions within the system , and calculated as a function of time .",
    "we choose to study the spin coherence in the ensemble here as @xmath40 .",
    "the advantage is that @xmath40 gives the magnitude of the residual spin orientation in the direction that is maximum ( automatically evaluating the envelope in case the ensemble average shows precession ) .",
    "however , in the present study without externally applied fields , there was no development of average spin orientation in the @xmath36 and @xmath37 directions , and the decay of @xmath40 always equaled the decay of ensemble average @xmath42 .",
    "the spin - dephasing time @xmath11 of the ensemble is defined as the decay time over which @xmath40 reduces to 1/e of its initial value .",
    "note , however , that decay traces of @xmath40 were not always mono exponential in our simulations .",
    "the temporal evolution of the normalized spin orientation @xmath43 is studied for out - plane initial spin states oriented along the [ 001 ] direction .",
    "the effective spin - orbit field resulting from equal magnitudes of the rashba and linear dresselhaus fields is always parallel to the [ 110 ] axis ( @xmath44 = @xmath45 = @xmath4610@xmath47 tm , @xcite ) .",
    "these values of the spin - orbit parameters give rise to an average spin precession length of about 3 @xmath12 m .",
    "the width of our wire of 1 @xmath12 m is chosen to be smaller than this length scale .",
    "of a spin ensemble is plotted as a function of the wire orientation with respect to the [ 100 ] lattice direction .",
    "the ensemble is initially oriented along the [ 001 ] direction .",
    "@xmath11 is strongly enhanced for a quasi-1d wire oriented in the [ 110 ] direction ( black ) as compared to an ensemble in a 2d system ( gray ) .",
    "the arrows ( in the top insets , horizontal axes span @xmath48 ) for data at 45@xmath49 and 225@xmath49 indicate that here @xmath11 is larger than could be calculated ( @xmath44 = @xmath45 = @xmath4610@xmath47 tm , @xmath50 = 0 ) .",
    "inset : ensemble spin expectation value @xmath40 as a function of time for different wire orientations.,width=302 ]    the inset of figure [ 5 ] shows the temporal evolution for five different orientations of the quasi-1d wire with respect to the [ 100 ] direction .",
    "a distinct anisotropy of the spin dephasing times is observed .",
    "the peak value of @xmath11 is reached when the wire is oriented exactly along the [ 110 ] direction .",
    "it is found to be in excess of 10@xmath51 ps , but the exact value could not be calculated in a reasonable computation time . yet , a deviation of only 5@xmath52 in the wire orientation with respect to the [ 110 ] direction leads to a reduction of @xmath11 of more than an order of magnitude towards a value of about 200 ps . for angles close to [ 110 ] @xmath53 15@xmath52 the spin - dephasing time drops already to 43 ps and it reaches a minimum of 9 ps for wires oriented along the [ @xmath5410 ] and [ 1@xmath540 ] direction .",
    "a detailed summary of these findings is presented in figure  [ 5 ] where the extracted spin - dephasing times are plotted as a function of the wire orientation .",
    "this plot reveals the strong anisotropy of @xmath11 with respect to the crystal axes .",
    "+ the anisotropy of @xmath11 is directly connected to the motion of single electrons within the ensemble .",
    "specular edge scattering implies that electrons with a solely transverse momentum component to the wire orientation ( traveling less than the spin precession length between scatter events ) almost do not contribute to the spin - dephasing because of motional narrowing .",
    "only electrons with a strong momentum component longitudinal to the wire orientation are contributing to the dephasing of the spin ensemble .",
    "this results in the strong enhancement of @xmath11 for wires in the [ 110 ] direction . + spin - dephasing times for non - confined spin ensembles ( wire width taken much wider than the mean free path and spin precession length ) are also calculated ( gray , figure  [ 5 ] ) .",
    "in contrast to the quasi-1d wire case , no spin - dephasing anisotropy is found .",
    "we investigated the crossover from 2d to quasi 1d behavior for a wide range of values for the spin precession length and mean free path ( with respect to the wire width ) , and found that the spin precession length is the crucial length scale which is governing this crossover .",
    "+ next , we discuss whether this distinct spin - dephasing anisotropy in quasi-1d wires ( with a strong enhancement of @xmath11 for wires in the [ 110 ] direction as a finger print ) can be maintained under more realistic circumstances .",
    "first we study the influence of adding the cubic dresselhaus term on the enhancement of @xmath11 .",
    "secondly , the influence of deviating strength of rashba and linear dresselhaus fields will be discussed . to avoid the difficulty that @xmath55 can not be calculated for 45@xmath52 with respect to the [ 100 ] direction within reasonable calculation time , we take 43@xmath52 as a test case , as this already shows a very strong @xmath55 enhancement , while @xmath55 is limited to nanoseconds .",
    "hence , the calculated spin - dephasing times in the following part can be seen as lower bounds .",
    "@xmath11 for the exact [ 110 ] direction is expected to be distinctively higher .",
    "+ the influence of the additional cubic dresselhaus term on the spin dephasing time in the quasi-1d wire is presented in figure  [ 6 ] ( a ) .",
    "again , the 2d case is plotted as a reference ( gray ) . without the cubic dresselhaus term",
    "the calculation results in a @xmath11 of 1.3 ns .",
    "however , the spin - dephasing time is decreasing rapidly with increasing dresselhaus parameter .",
    "for @xmath50 = -7@xmath5610@xmath57 tm@xmath58 , @xmath55 is already reduced to 78 ps . to estimate whether the spin - dephasing anisotropy is still present in a more realistic situation ,",
    "experimentally deduced parameters are applied for comparison with our calculations . in @xcite a value of @xmath50 = -1.18@xmath5610@xmath59 tm@xmath58",
    "is evaluated which results in a @xmath11 of only 40 ps . a value which is less than an order of magnitude higher than the value calculated for the 2d case .",
    "this points to the conclusion that the cubic dresselhaus term nearly annihilates the spin - dephasing anisotropy .",
    "however , @xmath50 depends strongly on the electron density of the system . for samples with lower densities",
    "@xmath50 is orders of magnitude smaller @xcite . considering those values , it turns out , that there is a much weaker decay of the peak value of the spin - dephasing time , even when the cubic dresselhaus term is included .",
    "enhancement of figure  [ 5 ] reduces when the cubic dresselhaus term is added and when the symmetry between @xmath44 and @xmath45 is lifted .",
    "the initial spin state is chosen to be along [ 001 ] direction and the quasi-1d wire is set at 43@xmath49 with respect to the [ 100 ] direction . the case of 43@xmath49 wire orientation ( rather than 45@xmath49 ) avoids the need to deal in calculations with extremely long @xmath11 for the symmetric case of @xmath44 = @xmath45 and @xmath50 @xmath60 0 , while still clearly showing the 1d @xmath11 enhancement . ( a ) the effect of the cubic dresselhaus term on @xmath11 is plotted for the 2d case ( gray ) and for the quasi-1d case ( black ) ( @xmath44 = @xmath45 = -1.57@xmath5610@xmath47 tm ) .",
    "( b ) @xmath11 is plotted here against the difference @xmath44 - @xmath45 , at the fixed value of @xmath45 = -1.57@xmath5610@xmath61 tm for the 2d case ( gray ) and for the quasi-1d case ( black ) ( @xmath50 = 0).,width=302 ]    finally , @xmath11 is investigated for deviating rashba and linear dresselhaus contributions .",
    "this dependence is summarized in figure  [ 6 ] ( b ) where @xmath11 is plotted as a function of the difference in strength of the rashba and linear dresselhaus parameter , @xmath62 , in the interval @xmath531@xmath5610@xmath47 tm for @xmath45 fixed at @xmath6310@xmath47 tm . at @xmath64 this results in the previously calculated @xmath11 of around 1.3 ns . with either increasing @xmath65 or increasing @xmath66 , @xmath11 is decaying equally fast . @xmath44 and @xmath45 taken from @xcite result in a difference @xmath67 of 0.4@xmath5610@xmath47 tm . for this value",
    "our calculated @xmath11 is already considerably reduced to about 110 ps . however ,",
    "this spin dephasing time is still an order of magnitude higher than the one resulting from the 2d case and in addition , @xmath44 can be tuned with a gate or heterostructure design to equalize it to the linear dresselhaus field .",
    "therefore , in summary , it can be stated that the spin - dephasing anisotropy which is very distinct for @xmath68 and @xmath45 exactly equal can still prevail under less ideal conditions .",
    "a useful numerical tool is developed for studying spin - dephasing in device structures due to the dyakonov - perel spin - dephasing mechanism . the rashba , linear and cubic dresselhaus contributions can be taken into account . with this tool is was demonstrated that quasi-1d wires ( narrower than the spin precession length , but with diffusive 2d motion for the electron ensemble ) can show very clear signatures of spin - dephasing anisotropy , with a strong suppression of spin dephasing for wires in the [ 110 ] crystal direction .",
