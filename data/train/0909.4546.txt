    "fluctuations are usually weak in three dimensions , and magnetic order is likely to set in at finite temperatures . however",
    ", despite its three - dimensional nature ,  combines a confluence of factors which favour the formation of a spin liquid : the ir atoms have spin-1/2 , leading to strong quantum fluctuations ; these atoms are arranged in an undistorted `` hyperkagome '' lattice , which gives rise to magnetic frustration ; and , perhaps most importantly , there are strong charge fluctuations in .",
    "these charge fluctuations lead to ring - exchange - type interactions of increasingly long - range between moments , and can prevent the formation of long - range order altogether@xcite .",
    "the strongest evidence for charge fluctuations in  comes from recent measurements on samples under pressure and on doped samples@xcite .",
    "application of hydrostatic pressure enhances the conductivity of the undoped samples by several orders of magnitude , indicating the proximity of  to a metallic phase .",
    "this is further corroborated by the fact that relatively small concentrations of dopants turn the system metallic @xcite .",
    "this indicates that  is a weak mott insulator , which can readily undergo bandwidth and doping - controlled transitions to the nearby metallic phase .    the weak mott insulator scenario for",
    "was first proposed in ref .  ,",
    "in which the bandwidth - tuned transition to a metal was studied in detail . in this theory , the electrons are factorized into fermionic spinons , which carry spin but no charge , and bosonic rotors , which carry charge but no spin @xcite . when a critical interaction strength is reached , the rotors become gapped , and the system becomes an insulator . on the other hand ,",
    "the spinons remain gapless even in the insulator , forming a neutral spinon fermi sea , responsible for the finite density of excitations seen in the specific heat .",
    "the spin - liquid states proposed so far , however , have ignored the sizeable spin - orbit coupling effects present in @xcite .",

    "thus , the situation is similar to the absence of spin - orbit coupling , but with two new ingredients : instead of carrying spin @xmath6 , the electrons carry pseudospin @xmath4 , and the hopping between sites does not necessarily conserve pseudospin . however , the fact that the system is still described by a one - band model is significant , as it justifies the general approach followed in ref .  .",
    "the importance of spin - orbit in  can be appreciated from recent studies on other transition metal oxides containing iridium @xcite .",
    "for example , one may expect that correlation effects in sr@xmath7ir@xmath8o@xmath9 would be weak due to the extended nature of the 5d ir orbitals . instead , spin orbit coupling gives rise to a narrow @xmath4 band in these materials@xcite . in sr@xmath10iro@xmath0",
    "this leads to an antiferromagnetic mott state , as demonstrated through angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy , optical conductivity , and x - ray absorption spectroscopy measurements , and also through first - principles electronic structure calculations @xcite .",
    "we find that a similar mechanism is responsible for enhancing correlation effects in .",
    "the inclusion of spin - orbit coupling may also help explain one of the outstanding experimental observations in . at low temperatures in the mott insulator phase ,",
    "the specific heat has a linear temperature dependence , with a finite coefficient @xmath11 , as in a metal .",
    "similarly , the magnetic susceptibility is constant at low temperatures , as in a metal",
    ". these results may be evidence for the existence of a spinon fermi surface in the insulator@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , in the experiments the wilson ratio between the susceptibility and the specific heat coefficient is much greater than one .",
    "this is often taken to be a signature of strong ferromagnetic fluctuations , but it seems to be at odds with the antiferromagnetic curie - weiss temperature @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of spin - orbit coupling gives an alternate way of generating a wilson ratio different from one@xcite , which we will explore below .",
    "our approach in this paper is partially phenomenological . after deriving an effective hubbard model based on microscopic considerations , we are left with a single free parameter @xmath12 that controls the ratio of direct ir - ir hopping to the hopping mediated by oxygens . since the outer 5d electrons in ir",
    "are extended and it is difficult _ a priori _ to make an estimate of @xmath12 , instead we follow a phenomenological approach and estimate @xmath12 by requiring a large wilson ratio and a small @xmath13 .",
    "however , many of our qualitative results are independent of the precise value @xmath12 . for instance",
    ", we find that for all values of @xmath12 , the non - interacting system has a finite density of states .",
    "this is in contrast to the pyrochlore lattice , where spin - orbit effects can lead to the formation of a topological band insulator@xcite .",
    "therefore , the insulating behaviour in  must arise due to interaction effects .",
    "another generic feature that is independent of the detailed value of @xmath12 is a strong temperature dependence in many physical quantities .",
    "the hyperkagome lattice has a 12 site unit cell which , together with the presence of spin - orbit coupling , leads to 24 quasiparticle bands .",
    "we find that the fermi surface contains multiple pockets arising from many of the bands , which have very strong structure near the chemical potential .",
    "this leads to a strong dependence of the density of states with energy , which is reflected in the temperature dependence , _",
    "e.g. _ of the specific heat and also of the hall coefficient for doped samples .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : hubbard ] we give a microscopic derivation of the one band hubbard model of in terms of the pseudospin @xmath4 ir states . in section iii , we analyze the quasiparticle spectrum in the non - interacting limit and study the resulting thermodynamics and transport properties in the metallic phase .",
    "we discuss the implications of the spin - orbit coupling in the spin liquid insulator .",
    "our starting point in deriving a microscopic model for  is the observation that due to the large atomic number of ir , the spin - orbit coupling @xmath14 at the ir sites is expected to be comparable to other microscopic energy scales , such as the local hubbard repulsion @xmath15 and the hopping amplitude between neighbouring ir sites , and therefore must be treated on the same footing .",
    "therefore , electronic spin @xmath16 is not expected to be a good quantum number . in",
    "what follows , we first consider a single ir site with spin - orbit coupling , which we will then use to construct a tight binding model .",
    "the ir 5d orbitals are split into @xmath17 and @xmath18 levels by the octahedral crystal field of the nearby oxygens .",
    "the @xmath19 splitting is large relative to @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the @xmath17 orbitals in ir@xmath20 are completely empty and can be ignored , whereas the @xmath18 orbitals have a single @xmath6 hole .",
    "the @xmath18 orbitals are weakly split due to weak distortions of the oxygen octahedra .",
    "however , we assume that this splitting is much smaller than @xmath14",
    ". then , the three @xmath18 orbitals behave as an effective orbital angular momentum @xmath21 moment .",
    "the spin - orbit coupling between this @xmath21 moment and the @xmath6 spin yields a low energy @xmath22 multiplet and a high energy @xmath4 multiplet , separated by the energy @xmath14 .",
    "provided that the electronic hopping between ir atoms is not large relative to @xmath14 , the @xmath22 and @xmath4 bands remain well - separated .",
    "then , the @xmath22 band is completely full and the @xmath4 band is the only one to participate in the low energy physics .",
    "the emergence of a @xmath4 band in an iridium oxide has been studied in detail in the closely related material sr@xmath10iro@xmath0 @xcite    hence , @xmath4 states give a good description of ir electrons in .",
    "the @xmath4 states are represented in the @xmath23 basis by,@xcite @xmath24 and @xmath25 to distinguish between total and spin angular momenta labels . by comparison , in the absence of spin - orbit coupling , the description would be in terms of @xmath6 moments . in",
    "what follows , we need to keep track of whether the labels @xmath26 and @xmath27 represent spin angular momentum @xmath25 , or `` pseudospin '' @xmath28 .",
    "we will use the labels @xmath29 and @xmath30 to describe pseudospin and spin , respectively , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "we can now introduce interactions and hopping , to obtain a one - band hubbard model on the hyperkagome lattice : @xmath35 here , @xmath36 annihilates a @xmath3 electron on the ir site @xmath37 , @xmath38 is the total density of electrons occupying the @xmath4 multiplet on that site , and @xmath39 is a non - interacting tight - binding hamiltonian , @xmath40 the pseudospin - dependent hopping amplitude @xmath41 is derived below .      ) , and it has four nearest neighbour ir sites , a , b , d , and e. we ignore the weak cubic distortions present in .",

    "most of the hopping processes relevant to  involve virtual states with vacancies in the oxygen @xmath43-orbitals .",
    "these processes are suppressed by the energy denominator @xmath53 , where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the level energies of the @xmath4 iridium orbitals and the oxygen @xmath43 orbitals , respectively , and @xmath56 is the hubbard repulsion on the oxygens .",
    "the energy @xmath57 is assumed to be large relative to the hopping amplitude between iridium and oxygen , and also to the hopping between two oxygens .",
    "therefore , the energy @xmath57 controls the perturbation theory used to compute the effective tight binding model parameters , which are expressed in powers of @xmath58 .",
    "symmetry arguments provide strong constraints on the form of the tight - binding model that obtains from perturbation theory .",
    "for instance , since spin - orbit coupling is time - reversal invariant , the most general pseudospin - dependent hopping appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tightbinding ] ) is of the form @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a real vector and @xmath61 are the three pseudospin pauli @xmath46 matrices .",
    "note that @xmath60 must be odd under exchange of @xmath37 and @xmath28 in order to ensure hermiticity of @xmath39 .",
    "in addition , note that @xmath62 transforms as a vector under rotations within the point symmetry group of the lattice .",
    "consider parity transformations about some point @xmath63 , defined by @xmath64 .",
    "since pseudospin is parity invariant ( _ i.e. _ angular momentum is a pseudovector ) , the effect of a parity transformation @xmath65 with origin at the midpoint between sites @xmath37 and @xmath28 is @xmath66 therefore , if the lattice is invariant under @xmath65 , then @xmath67 , which implies that @xmath68 ,",
    "_ i.e. _ the hopping between sites @xmath37 and @xmath28 is pseudospin symmetric . in practice , the hyperkagome lattice has an intrinsic handedness , and therefore is , in general , not invariant under any parity transformation .",
    "however , at low orders in @xmath58 , many of the hopping processes involve parity - invariant clusters of sites , leading to pseudospin symmetric hopping amplitudes .      to leading order , the nearest neighbor hopping between sites @xmath69 and @xmath70 involves the creation of an electron at site a with pseudospin @xmath71 , hopping to site c through the term @xmath72 in the hamiltonian , and projection into a final pseudospin @xmath73 state : @xmath74 note that , at this level in perturbation theory , the nearest neighbor hopping is isotropic in pseudospin .",
    "this can be understood from the symmetry considerations discussed above  clearly , the cluster composed of the two sites a and c is parity invariant about its midpoint . note that nearest - neighbor hopping mediated by oxygens vanishes to second order in perturbation theory .",
    "thus , the leading correction to eq .",
    "( [ eq : nearest1 ] ) occurs at third order in perturbation theory , and is given by @xmath75 even in this case , the perturbation theory processes involve parity invariant clusters , and therefore only represent a weak pseudospin - symmetric renormalization of the result in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nearest1 ] ) .",
    "the leading pseudospin - dependent terms involve next - nearest neighbor hopping , which we study next .",
    "to third order in perturbation theory , hopping between sites a and d can occur through three independent paths : @xmath76 among these , the first path actually involves a parity symmetric cluster .",
    "however , the other two do not , and therefore give rise to pseudospin - dependent hopping . summing the contributions from all three paths yields , @xmath77 where @xmath78 the hopping amplitude from @xmath79 to @xmath80",
    "can be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : nextnearest ] ) through a @xmath81 rotation at site @xmath70 , which yields @xmath82 and for hopping from @xmath80 to @xmath83 , by doing an inversion about @xmath70 , followed by a proper rotation ( this operation is a symmetry for the clusters involved at this order in perturbation theory ) .",
    "this leads to , @xmath84      the third neighbor hopping between sites @xmath69 and @xmath79 involves 16 different paths .",
    "the calculation is significantly simplified by the observation that to the lowest order in perturbation theory ( third order ) , third neighbor hopping involves a reflection - symmetric cluster , and is therefore pseudospin symmetric .",
    "we find , @xmath85      inspection of the equations ( [ eq : nearest2 ] ) , ( [ eq : nextnearest ] ) , and ( [ eq : thirdneighbor ] ) shows that the hopping amplitudes can be parametrized as , @xmath86 where @xmath87 represents an overall energy scale for the hopping hamiltonian , @xmath88 is the dimensionless ratio between @xmath89 and @xmath90 , and @xmath12 is an angle representing the relative strength of direct ir - ir hopping and hopping mediated by oxygens .",
    "we expect @xmath88 to be a small parameter . in our computations",
    ", we find that its precise value is not very important , and take @xmath91 for concreteness .    on the other hand , it is difficult to make an _ a priori _ estimation of the angle @xmath12 . in the case of ir ,",
    "the outer 5d electrons are extended and there can be in principle a sizeable orbital overlap between adjacent ir atoms .",
    "hence , we do not try to estimate the microscopic value of the parameter @xmath12 , which controls the relative size of direct ir - ir hopping and hopping mediated by the oxygens . instead , in this analysis we will take @xmath12 to be a phenomenological parameter , which will be obtained from a comparison with experimental data",
    ". however , as we will emphasize , many of the qualitative results of our analysis do not depend on the detailed value of @xmath12 .",
    "in the previous section , we derived a hubbard model for , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : hubbard ] ) . in this section",
    ", we will compute various physical observables of this model in the non - interacting limit .",
    "one reason to focus on this limit is that experimental evidence indicates that the system becomes metallic under hydrostatic pressure and by doping@xcite .",
    "therefore , many of the properties of the metallic state may be captured by the non - interacting model , up to quasiparticle renormalization effects . moreover",
    ", the non - interacting limit can also give us relevant information for the insulating state . as was argued in ref .",
    ", the insulating state is a weak mott insulator , described by gapped rotors coexisting with a gapless fermi surface of spinons . in this picture",
    ", the spinons would have a similar dispersion to the electronic dispersion obtained in the non - interacting model .",
    "later on , we will discuss some of the effects of reintroducing interactions .",
    "the unit cell in the hyperkagome lattice consists of 12 sites .",
    "hence , when taking into account the pseudospin degree of freedom , we obtain 24 different quasiparticle bands in the brillouin zone .",

    "i.e. _ with nearest - neighbour hopping only . in this case , the system is pseudospin symmetric , so that pseudospin up and down bands are always degenerate . at the high end of the spectrum , there are eight degenerate flat bands ( four for each pseudospin ) , corresponding to localized states that arise due to the geometric frustration of the lattice . at half - filling , for each value of pseudospin ,",

    "figure [ fig : t0d ] shows the associated density of states . note that near the chemical potential the density of states is small .",

    "we have verified that the degeneracies at the @xmath93 point are consistent with the symmetry of the magnetic point group of the hyperkagome lattice .",

    "these include a small electron pocket near @xmath100 , as well as hole pockets near @xmath101 , and @xmath102 .",
    "the existence of multiple shallow pockets leads to a strong energy dependence of the density of states and to a suppressed density of states at the chemical potential , as shown in fig .",

    "for all dopings , we find that the hall coefficient is a strong function of temperature . as with other observables",
    "studied before , this effect is due to the presence of multiple narrow bands near the chemical potential .",
    "thus , although the detailed form of @xmath122 does depend on @xmath12 and also on doping , the fact that it is a strong function of temperature is a generic feature of the model in eq.([eq : hubbard ] ) .",
    "although the tight - binding spectrum is derived for electrons in a metal , the same tight binding model would describe the spinon spectrum in the spin liquid phase up to renormalization effects coming from the interaction between spinons and the gauge field .",
    "it was shown that this interaction only leads to weak renormalization effects near the critical point between the metal and the spin liquid@xcite .",
    "for example , it only leads to a @xmath124 enhancement of the specific heat coefficient @xmath108.@xcite on the other hand , the previous analysis did not include the spin - orbit coupling and it is expected that there would be an additional spin - orbit - coupling - induced renormalization of specific heat and susceptibility .",
    "that is , just like the metallic phase discussed earlier , the wilson ratio would be in general bigger than one : the same arguments with the pseudospin - dependent hopping amplitudes apply to the spinons in the spin liquid phase .",
    "there is , however , even further renormalization of the wilson ratio due to the combined effect of the spin - orbit coupling and the quasiparticle ( electrons or spinons ) interactions . in the framework of the landau fermi liquid theory ,",
    "it was shown that additional quasiparticle interactions that depend on both the orbital and spin quantum numbers can arise in spin - orbital coupled systems . in particular , an additional fermi liquid renormalization factor for the wilson ratio has the form : @xmath125 , where @xmath126 corresponds to the usual spin density - spin density interaction , and @xmath127 and @xmath128 represent additional spin - orbit coupling - induced quasiparticle interactions that vanish in the absence of the spin - orbit coupling@xcite . given that the nature of the underlying quasiparticle interactions among spinons is quite different from that between electrons , it is conceivable that the wilson ratio in metal and the spin liquid can also be quantitatively quite different .",
    "since the interactions between spinons are generally believed to be much stronger , we may expect a bigger wilson ratio in the spin liquid phase .",
    "quantitative estimation would require the derivation of the full fermi liquid interaction function , which may be an excellent topic of future study .",

    "<S> this proposal is consistent with recent experimental findings that the material becomes a metal upon increasing pressure or doping . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the effect of the spin - orbit coupling arising from 5@xmath3 ir moments both in the metallic and spin liquid phases of na@xmath0ir@xmath1o@xmath2 . the effective hubbard model in terms of pseudospin @xmath4 ir states is derived and its consequences to both metallic and spin liquid phases are studied . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the model leads to enhanced wilson ratio and strong temperature dependence of the hall coefficient . </S>"
