    "spin injection is one of the aims of spintronics @xcite thanks to the potential applications of injectors as spin led devices , etc .",
    "also quantum state transfer from spin electrons to photons by interband transitions is actively investigated @xcite .",
    "one of the most efficient ways of spin injection to date @xcite is the use of ii - vi dilute magnetic semiconductors ( dmss ) that exhibit the giant zeeman effect @xcite : they have a conductivity comparable to that of nonmagnetic semiconductors , and can boast spin polarizations close to 100% at a small applied magnetic field .",
    "however , spin - injection experiments in semiconductors enter easily the regime of nonlinear response @xcite .",
    "different effects could contribute to nonlinear transport and therefore to nonlinear spin injection .",
    "for example , band bending effects @xcite in nanostructures give rise to a nonlinear current due to the interplay between coulomb interaction and electron tunnel in these confined systems , which have quasi - discrete states .",
    "other physical mechanisms inherent to these systems explain their current - voltage characteristics : for instance a large zeeman level splitting @xmath0 in an applied magnetic field @xmath1 .",
    "recently , spin transport through dms diodes @xcite and multi - quantum well structures ( mqws ) has been analyzed @xcite .",
    "these works study nonlinear features of the current ( hysteresis , multistability ) as a function of the external voltage . under strong dc voltage bias @xmath2 ,",
    "electric field domains are formed in mqws due to the interplay between electron - electron interaction and resonant tunneling @xcite . in other sample configurations or , for different doping density ,",
    "there are spin polarized self - sustained current oscillations ( sscos ) and the system could behave as a spin oscillator @xcite . to tailor the properties of these spin oscillators or injectors , it is important to perform a systematic analysis of the transition from stationary to time dependent current , in terms of sample configuration , external magnetic field , doping density , etc .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the response to voltage ( @xmath2 ) or magnetic ( @xmath1 ) switching in a n - doped dc voltage biased semiconductor mqws having its first quantum well ( qw ) doped with mn .",
    "both spin polarized stationary states ( sss ) and sscos are possible stable states of the mqws for different values of the parameters .",
    "stationary states field profiles consist of two electric field domains separated by a domain wall which is a charge monopole @xcite .",
    "magnetic field switching requires knowing phase diagrams of the current density @xmath3 and the applied voltage @xmath2 versus the level splitting @xmath0 ( due to the magnetic field @xmath1 ) , and these diagrams are among the results of this paper .",
    "the phase diagram of @xmath2 versus @xmath0 shows regions of stable sscos embedded in others of stable sss .",
    "the extension of the ssco regions increases with the number of qws in the structure .",
    "sudden changes of @xmath2 or @xmath1 may switch or disconnect sscos from an initial stable ss or force the domain wall to change its location .",
    "the sscos are due to periodic triggering of charge dipoles at the mn - doped well and their motion towards the collector @xcite .",
    "large level splitting induced by @xmath1 due to the exchange interaction provides dms mqwss with a new degree of freedom which is absent in conventional iii - v weakly coupled n - doped semiconductor mqwss @xcite .",
    "another important difference is that , in the latter , both charge dipoles and monopoles may be triggered at the injector ( depending on its current  field characteristics : its conductivity if the relation between current and field is linear ) and both may cause sscos @xcite . in these materials and for moderate conductivity of the injecting contact , switching the voltage @xmath2 between different sss",
    "involves either upward monopole motion or a dipole - tripole mechanism @xcite . for sufficiently large conductivity of the injector , the dipole - tripole mechanism ceases to exist and voltage switching involves injection of a charge monopole that moves towards the collector until it reaches the qw corresponding to the final stable ss @xcite .",
    "voltage or magnetic switching in ii - vi mqwss always involves dipole nucleation at the mn - doped qw .",
    "our sample configuration consists of an n - doped znse/(zn , cd , mn)se weakly coupled mqws .",
    "the spin for the magnetic ion @xmath4 is @xmath5=5/2 and the exchange interaction between the mn local moments and the conduction band electrons is ferromagnetic in ii - vi qws .",
    "the energy spectrum corresponding to @xmath6 isolated qws comprising our weakly coupled mqws has the form @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the effective mass , @xmath9 is the in - plane wave vector orthogonal to the growth direction and @xmath10 is the qw subband index . in the weak magnetic fields considered here , we disregard landau - level formation and",
    "@xmath9 is a continuous variable @xcite . using the virtual crystal and mean field approximations",
    ", the exchange interaction causes the subband energies to depend on spin in those qws containing mn ions : @xmath11 where @xmath12 for spin @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the brillouin function , the exchange integral , the density of magnetic impurities and an effective temperature which accounts for mn interactions , respectively @xcite .",
    "we model spin - flip scattering coming from spin - orbit or hyperfine interaction by a phenomenological scattering time @xmath18 , which is larger than impurity and phonon scattering times : @xmath19 . vertical transport in the weakly coupled mqws is spin - independent sequential tunneling between adjacent qws , so that when electrons tunnel to an excited state they instantaneously relax by phonon scattering to the ground state , with the same spin polarization @xcite .",
    "lastly , electron - electron interaction is considered within the hartree mean field approximation .    the equations governing the model are @xcite : the discrete poisson equation relating the two - dimensional spin - up and spin - down electron densities , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , respectively , to the average electric field @xmath22 at the @xmath23th mqws period ( of lengh @xmath24 ) , @xmath25 and the rate equations for @xmath26 , @xmath27 for @xmath28 . for numerical convenience ,",
    "we have introduced here a smoothed form @xmath29 of the scattering term used in  @xcite , given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a small smoothing parameter ( smaller than @xmath32 or than the thermal energy ) such that , as @xmath33 , @xmath34 which was used by snchez et al @xcite ( note that @xmath35 is equivalent to @xmath36 ) .    in these expressions",
    ", @xmath37 is the chemical potential at the @xmath23th mqws period and @xmath38 are the spin - dependent subband energies ( measured from the bottom of the @xmath23th well ) : @xmath39 , and @xmath38=@xmath40 for @xmath411 . also , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the 2d doping density at the qws and the average permittivity .    in weakly coupled mqws",
    ", tunneling between adjacent qws can be treated in leading order perturbation theory . since elastic and inelastic scattering times in the qws",
    "are shorter than any other time scale of the problem , we can assume that the electrons in each well are in quasiequilibrium between succesive tunneling events and that their temperature is that of the lattice .",
    "we ignore interwell spin - flip processes , so that currents are carried between wells by the two spin subsystems in parallel .",
    "then , as in the case of non - magnetic mqwss , the tunneling current densities across the @xmath23th barrier @xmath44 can be calculated by the bardeen transfer hamiltonian method @xcite .",
    "see the detailed derivation for non - magnetic mqwss in ref .",

    "figure [ 1 ] depicts the phase diagram of voltage versus @xmath1-induced level splitting @xmath0 .",
    "we observe that the extension of the parameter regions corresponding to sscos increases with @xmath6 , the number of qws in the structure , and that ssco regions for a fixed @xmath6 contain ssco regions for structures with smaller @xmath6 . to the left of the main oscillatory regions",
    "there are sometimes small oscillatory regions which appear as isolated dots in fig .",
    "[ 1 ] . whether these dots are connected to the main oscillatory regions by extremely thin regions ( narrower than the discretization error of the code )",
    "is something our numerical solution of the model has not been able to decide .",
    "even though these connecting regions have not been found and therefore they are not shown in the figure , we can not discard their existence .",
    "in fact the dots are absorbed by the larger oscillatory regions to their right as @xmath6 increases .",
    "figure [ 2 ] shows the total current density @xmath59 as a function of the applied dimensionless voltage @xmath75 for @xmath100 . in agreement with fig .  [ 1 ] , we observe that the width of ssco regions increases with @xmath0 . for intermediate values of @xmath0 ,",
    "the number of oscillatory regions first increases and then decreases again when the oscillatory regions merge for larger @xmath0 .",
    "the phase diagram shows similar features if we change @xmath0 at fixed @xmath2 : there is only one finite interval of sscos , @xmath101 , cf .",
    "[ 1 ] . in terms of the magnetic field @xmath1 ,",
    "the situation is somewhat different .",
    "the level splitting @xmath0 is given by a brillouin function of @xmath1 , so @xmath0 can only take on values smaller than a saturating value , @xmath102 .",
    "if @xmath103 , there may be sscos for a finite interval of @xmath1 as shown in fig .",
    "[ 3 ] or for an infinite interval if @xmath104 ( inset of fig .",
    "[ 3 ] ) .",
    "the mqws response to a sudden switching of the voltage or the magnetic field can be inferred from fig .  [ 1 ] .",
    "let us increase @xmath75 at fixed @xmath0 as indicated by the vertical arrow in fig .",
    "[ 1 ] ( from sscos to sss ) . after a transient",
    ", the mqws settles to the ss , as shown in figs .  [",
    "4](a ) and ( b ) . the periodic generation of a high field domain at the magnetic qw @xmath23=@xmath92 and its motion towards the high field region adjacent to the collector yield sscos ( panel b ) .",
    "the transient corresponds to the nucleation of a last and larger high field domain at the first qw and its motion until its trailing domain wall reaches the location corresponding to the stable ss ( cf .  the similar dipole - tripole mechanism in @xcite ) .",
    "increasing abruptly @xmath75 between sss in different regions of fig .  [ 1 ] always involves dipole emission at the magnetic qw , unlike the one - well upward domain wall motion possible in conventional iii - v mqws @xcite .    for fixed @xmath75 , a sudden increment of @xmath1 from a stable ss region to a ssco region ( horizontal arrow in fig .",
    "[ 1 ] ) induces sscos , as shown in fig .",
    "[ 4](c - d ) .",
    "the transient stage between the ss and sscos after switching @xmath1 is due to the formation of a high field domain at the first qw which travels towards the collector .",
    "after the domain reaches the mqws end , a new high field domain is formed at the first qw and the same situation is periodically repeated .",
    "in this paper , we have systematically analyzed the transition from stationary states to self - sustained current oscillations through a dilute magnetic semiconductor multi - quantum well structure .",
    "switching suddenly a control parameter as the ( dimensionless ) applied voltage @xmath75 or the external magnetic field @xmath1 may force the system to move between stable oscillatory and stationary states through the transition region . since self - sustained current oscillations are caused by triggering high field domains at the magnetic quantum well , we expect our results not to change qualitatively with the contact boundary condition .",
    "we have used two other conditions to check this :    1 .",
    "@xmath105 in the tunneling currents for normal contacts , where @xmath106 is a positive constant .",
    "the electric field at the injector @xmath107 is calculated by using the ohm s law : @xmath108 instead of the tunneling current formulas @xcite with known @xmath109 .",
    "the resulting phase diagrams for ( i ) with different values of @xmath106 ( from 0.5 to 1.5 ) and for ( ii ) with different values of the contact resistivity @xmath110 ( from 31.3 to 313 @xmath111 m ) have the same configuration as in fig .",
    "[ 1 ] except for small quantitative shifts of the ssco regions : increasing @xmath106 or @xmath110 enlarges the oscillatory region .",
    "this situation is reminiscent of the early theoretical work on the gunn effect in bulk gaas .",
    "gunn s experiments made it clear that the sscos in dc voltage biased n - doped gaas samples are due to the periodic motion of charge dipole waves that appear at the cathode and disappear at the anode @xcite .",
    "theorists soon used a variety of boundary conditions at the injecting contact region ( cathode ) that could produce the required sscos mediated by charge dipole waves . among them , kroemer s contact characteristics ( the electron current density is a known function of the electric field at the contact : in case ( ii ) , this function is linear ) @xcite , general models of metal  semiconductor contacts @xcite , or contacts with fixed electron density but with a notch near the cathode in the doping density profile @xcite .",
    "while the two first contact types can give rise to sscos mediated by either moving charge dipoles ( either high or low electric field domains ) or monopoles ( either charge accumulation or charge depletion layers ) depending on parameter values @xcite , a notch in the doping density produces only dipoles @xcite .",
    "while it is feasible to list all possible oscillation types in terms of contact parameter values ( see @xcite ) , these values can not be modified once the gunn diode has been made .",
    "similarly , in a conventional iii - v weakly coupled n - doped semiconductor superlattice ( sl ) , the boundary condition at the injector , the sl configuration and the doping density at the qws determine whether the system exhibits sscos mediated by charge dipole or monopole waves @xcite or multistable static electric field domains ; see the review @xcite and references cited therein .    in the sl case ,",
    "there exist partial phase diagrams : ( i ) doping density vs dc voltage bias for fixed boundary condition @xcite , and ( ii ) injector conductivity vs dc voltage bias for fixed doping density ( assuming a linear relation between electron current and electric field at the contact ) @xcite .",
    "however a complete study ( which , depending on both doping density _ and _ injector conductivity , should yield both monopole _ and _ dipole sscos , as in @xcite ) has not yet been carried out . be this as it may , once the sl has been made and contacted , the stable solutions can be selected only by changing the bias and this limits the type of attractors present in a particular sl .",
    "the situation is different in the case of a dilute magnetic semiconductor multi - quantum well structure : the magnetic qw plays the role of a `` tunable doping density notch '' . in principle , any self - oscillations that may appear are due to triggering of dipoles at the magnetic qw .",
    "however , by changing the external magnetic field we can select either stable stationary states or sscos as the dms multi - quantum well response .",
    "our results show how to design a device operating a spin injector and a spin oscillator by tuning the zeeman splitting and the parameters determining the sample configuration .",
