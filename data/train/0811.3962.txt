    "hawking radiation shows that a black hole and its horizon are spacetime regions where gravitational effects become important in quantum field theory . the initial approach followed by hawking @xcite was to study quantized ingoing and outgoing field modes in a fixed black hole background .",
    "this process yields a flux of particles , produced and emitted out of the surrounding quantum vacuum with a thermal spectrum . in a flat spacetime",
    "the vacuum is uniquely defined and relatively easy to find , but in a curved spacetime it is not so simple .",
    "there are cases where it may be impossible to define a vacuum state , as in strongly time dependent geometries . on the contrary , there are situations where many vacua exist for a given geometry .",
    "the schwarzschild solution , for example , has three possible vacua : boulware @xcite , unruh @xcite , and hartle - hawking @xcite , all three of which are interesting and important .",
    "the boulware vacuum describes the vacuum in a region near the surface of a highly compact star , where it has a small negative energy density . near the horizon of a black hole , however , this energy density blows up , so the boulware vacuum is inappropriate for a black hole geometry . on the other hand , the unruh and hartle - hawking vacua are both consistent for the schwarzschild black hole .",
    "the hartle - hawking vacuum has a small , finite , negative energy at the event horizon , which in turn is responsible for the production of particles and subsequent hawking radiation at a given temperature .",
    "the unruh vacuum , also having a small , finite , negative energy at the event horizon , is produced by the complete gravitational collapse of an object , and in this sense is more physical .",
    "however , the one that usually simplifies the calculations is the hartle - hawking vacuum , and , if desired , it is possible to pass from this to the unruh vacuum via appropriate transformations .",
    "once a consistent vacuum for the geometry in question , such as a black hole spacetime , has been defined , the associated quantities of interest may be found . for a given field @xmath4 and vacuum @xmath5 , where @xmath6 represents a spacetime point",
    ", these quantities may be the vacuum expectation value of the field operator @xmath7 i.e.  @xmath8 , or @xmath0 for short , and its associated vacuum expectation value of the stress - energy tensor @xmath9 i.e. @xmath10 , or @xmath3 for short .",
    "the quantity @xmath0 is a useful tool in the study of quantum effects in curved spacetimes .",
    "when properly renormalized it gives information about vacuum polarization effects and spontaneous symmetry breaking phenomena , although since it is a scalar it does not distinguish between future and past surfaces , such as horizons and infinities .",
    "the quantity @xmath1 provides information about the energy density and particle production .",
    "moreover , since in general relativity einstein s equations relate the spacetime curvature to the distribution of matter as encoded in the stress - energy tensor , for quantum fields the expectation value @xmath1 is used to determine how the underlying geometry responds to suitable averages of the quantum fields .",
    "these back - reaction effects by the quantum fields on the background spacetime are described by the semiclassical einstein equations @xmath11 ( we use @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) ( see @xcite for reviews and careful explanations ) .",
    "the problem of quantum back reaction is certainly significant in the case of black holes and in other spacetimes with horizons , such as de sitter spacetime .",
    "for instance , in the black hole case it leads to the complete evaporation of the black hole .",
    "since @xmath0 and @xmath1 are constructed with product expressions , bilinear in the field operators and evaluated at the same spacetime point , the vacuum expectation value of these quantities diverges . for a theory to have any physical meaning it must give finite results , so some process must be employed to render these quantities finite .",
    "such a process amounts to subtracting off some `` unphysical '' infinite terms . in",
    "flat spacetime , standard normal ordering techniques and other procedures in quantum field theory work well in regularizing and renormalizing the fields , where regularization identifies the infinities , and renormalization eliminates them . in general relativity , however , the energy density itself is a source of curvature .",
    "therefore , when working with a quantum field theory whose energy density is formally divergent we must be very careful about what may be dismissed as unphysical .",
    "the standard techniques used in flat spacetimes do not work in curved spacetimes , so one of the great difficulties in understanding quantum processes in a black hole  or any other curved  spacetime is the implementation of consistent regularization and renormalization schemes .",
    "fortunately , there are several generally accepted consistent , covariant regularization and renormalization schemes for curved spacetimes ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . of these , the most widely and consistently used method for @xmath0 and @xmath1 calculations is that of isolating the divergent terms of the dewitt - schwinger expansion .",
    "this covariant geodesic point separation method , developed by schwinger @xcite , dewitt @xcite , and christensen @xcite ( see barvinsky and vilkovisky in ref .",
    "@xcite for further information ) , is now usually called the point splitting method .",
    "the idea of the point splitting method is that the operator in each product is moved along a geodesic to a nearby spacetime point .",
    "the point separated object is expressed in terms of green s functions @xmath15 . in the coincidence limit ,",
    "where the nearby spacetime point @xmath16 approaches the original point @xmath6 , there will be terms diverging logarithmically ( in even dimensions ) and as inverse powers of the point separation .",
    "this point splitting method leads naturally to the dewitt - schwinger expansion , which gives an approximation for the green s function @xmath15 when the points @xmath6 and @xmath16 are separated by a small geodesic distance , @xmath17 , along the shortest geodesic connecting them .",
    "the result is actually expanded in powers of the field mass @xmath18 , with expansion coefficients @xmath19 expressed in terms of geometrical quantities constructed from the riemann tensor .",
    "other renormalization methods exist , for example , dimensional continuation @xcite .",
    "many of these methods have been shown to be equivalent to the dewitt - schwinger approach @xcite .",
    "the divergent terms of the dewitt - schwinger expansion are then the renormalizing counter terms to be subtracted from the unrenormalized exact expression for @xmath15 , prior to taking the limit @xmath20 . now",
    "the expressions for @xmath0 and @xmath1 , written conveniently in terms of green s functions , are in fact the properly renormalized expressions @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "these renormalized values are those which provide information on spontaneous symmetry breaking and particle production , as well as being essential for calculating the backreaction by quantum fields on the spacetime .",
    "this means that semiclassical general relativity has physical meaning when described by the equations @xmath23 . with this renormalization process in hand ,",
    "a complete set of mode functions and their associated creation and annihilation operators must be found by solving the field equations for @xmath4 .",
    "the vacuum expectation values @xmath21 and @xmath24 are then put in terms of the field operators . in general",
    "the result is a sum over products of mode functions and their derivatives .",
    "the sum can , at least in principle , be performed and a finite result is achieved .",
    "there is an additional pay - off when using the dewitt - schwinger expansion with christensen s point separation method . since the expansion is in inverse powers of the field mass @xmath18 , it is valid for many spacetimes provided @xmath18 is large enough . in this case",
    "the finite terms of the expansion can provide approximations for both @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "for instance , given a scalar field @xmath4 the feynman green s function corresponds to @xmath0 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , so that the finite terms of the expansion directly give a physical @xmath21 .",
    "the major obstacle in the dewitt - schwinger expansion is to compute the coefficients @xmath19 . for a scalar field",
    "the first three coefficients , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , have been computed by dewitt @xcite ; the coefficient @xmath28 has been computed in the coincidence limit by gilkey @xcite ; and , the coefficient @xmath29 has been computed in the coincidence limit by avramidi @xcite , and by amsterdamski , berkin , and , oconnor @xcite . additionally , barvinsky et .",
    "@xcite have calculated these coefficients using different methods .",
    "thus , christensen s method plays definitely two roles  it is the basis for point splitting renormalization , and it yields an estimate for the quantities @xmath21 and @xmath22 .    it should be stressed that the dewitt - schwinger expansion together with christensen s point separation method is an approximation that does not hold in all regions of all spacetimes . for example , the results of kay and wald @xcite show that for a reissner - nordstrm black hole in asymptotically de sitter spacetime , @xmath0 can not be regular on both the event and cosmological horizons when these horizons have unequal temperatures .",
    "christensen s work is quite general , and in principle can be applied to any spacetime .",
    "for cosmological as well as some black hole applications , see ref .",
    "@xcite for works up to around 1980 .",
    "many other examples can be given .",
    "for massless scalar fields analytical results were reported by several authors .",
    "candelas studied a massless scalar field minimally coupled in the schwarzschild geometry , where @xmath0 and @xmath1 were worked out on the event horizon @xcite .",
    "candelas and howard @xcite and fawcett and whiting @xcite extended the calculation of @xmath0 to the exterior region .",
    "candelas and jensen @xcite calculated @xmath0 in the interior region , and finally howard and candelas @xcite and fawcett @xcite calculated @xmath1 for the whole of schwarzschild , definitively extending the pioneering work of candelas @xcite . in this context of schwarzschild black holes",
    "it was shown by hawking @xcite and fawcett and whiting @xcite that the mean square field @xmath0 can give considerable insight into the physical content of the different possible vacua and in the study of theories with spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "massless scalar fields in reissner - nordstrm and kerr - newman spacetimes were studied by frolov @xcite , where @xmath0 was found on the event horizon of a reissner - nordstrm black hole and on the pole of the event horizon of a kerr - newman black hole .",
    "since analytical and numerical calculations are difficult , approximation schemes have been devised for calculating @xmath0 and @xmath1 for schwarzschild , reissner - nordstrm , and kerr - newman black holes @xcite . for massless electromagnetic fields",
    "several works have calculated @xmath1 for schwarzschild , reissner - nordstrm , and kerr - newman black holes @xcite .",
    "all these works are for massless fields , where calculations may simplify due to the conformal invariance of the system .",
    "a new approach came with the work of anderson @xcite where the method was applied consistently to massive scalar fields . in ref.@xcite @xmath0",
    "was calculated for a generically coupled massive scalar field in the schwarzschild geometry , and in @xcite a powerful formalism was laid down for finding @xmath0 in a general static spherical geometry , which includes schwarzschild and reissner - nordstrm solutions .",
    "this was possible through the use of the plana sum formula which converts sums into integrals .",
    "the method was extended by anderson , hiscock , and samuel @xcite to find @xmath22 for a massive scalar field in a general , static , spherical geometry .",
    "the approach of refs.@xcite uses a wentzel - kramers - brillouin ( wkb ) approximation for the mode functions to compute @xmath0 and @xmath1 to orders @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively .",
    "it is further found that , when applied to the reissner - nordstrm spacetime , the dewitt - schwinger expansion provides values quite close to the numerical results when the field mass @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the black hole mass ( we put @xmath14 ) .",
    "anderson s approach has been developed and applied to other cases .",
    "cylindrical black hole spacetimes have been examined by debenedictis @xcite , who worked out @xmath0 for scalar fields , and by piedra and oca , who have studied spinor fields @xcite .",
    "sushkov @xcite studied it for wormholes , berej and matyjasek @xcite for the spacetime of a nonlinear black hole , satz , mazzitelli , and alvarez @xcite for the vacuum outside stars , and winstanley and young @xcite for lukewarm black holes .",
    "finally , flachi and tanaka @xcite have used anderson s method to compute @xmath0 in asymptotically anti - de sitter black hole geometries .",
    "new approaches have been devised by anderson , mottola , and vaulin @xcite , whereas popov and zaslavskii have discussed the wkb approximation in the massless limit @xcite .",
    "christensen has remarked @xcite that while his methods are valid in arbitrary dimensions , where the procedure is the same as in four dimensions , calculating quantities such as @xmath0 and @xmath1 in higher dimensions `` would be extremely long and would probably have to be done on a computer , '' mainly due to the complexity of the renormalization problem .",
    "this comment is still true and the very few works since 1978 that have tried to come to terms with the renormalization techniques in curved @xmath2-dimensional spacetimes do prove the difficulty of the extension of the procedure .",
    "nevertheless the interest in these techniques to spacetimes with more than four dimensions has been renewed as the result of progress in areas such as string theory , ads / cft ( anti - de sitter / conformal field theory ) conjecture , kaluza - klein theories , extra large - dimensional scenarios , and the related brane world scenarios .",
    "earlier , frolov , mazzitelli , and paz @xcite studied polarization effects in black hole spacetimes in higher dimensions . in the context of black holes in a braneworld ,",
    "casadio @xcite discussed back reaction issues . in a very thorough work decanini and folacci",
    "@xcite expressed the dewitt - schwinger representation of the feynman propagator as a hadamard expansion for even and odd dimensions which clearly exhibit the divergent and the regular parts of the dewitt - schwinger representation .",
    "in @xcite these authors presented the first explicit calculations of the stress - energy tensor in an arbitrary spacetime of @xmath2 dimensions and provided an expression for @xmath34 in the large mass limit . following the ideas developed in christensen and fulling @xcite , morgan , thom , winstanley , and young @xcite have worked out some properties of @xmath1 for @xmath2-dimensional spherical black holes .",
    "herdeiro , ribeiro , and sampaio @xcite studied the scalar casimir effect on a @xmath2-dimensional einstein static universe where renormalization techniques are also used and where , incidentally , the plana sum formula ( also called the abel - plana formula ) has been applied  in fact the formula was used for the first time in the context of renormalization techniques for the casimir effect by mamaev , mostepanenko , and starobinsky @xcite ; see the review @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we use the techniques developed by dewitt @xcite , christensen @xcite , and anderson @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and apply them to the problem of renormalization of the divergent quantity @xmath0 for a massive scalar field @xmath4 in a @xmath2-dimensional static spacetime , carrying out the renormalization by the point splitting technique .",
    "the derivations presented by dewitt @xcite and christensen @xcite are quite mathematical in nature , and the end result is not in a form that is amenable for renormalizing @xmath0 .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present a compact formula for the renormalization terms that may be applied to @xmath0 calculations , which we achieve for even dimensions . as applications of our results in even dimensions , we single out @xmath35 and @xmath34 . in @xmath35",
    "we compare our results with previous results , and surely , it is the most important dimension .",
    "we then have chosen @xmath34 both because it is the simplest case after @xmath35 and can be consistently realized if one advocates extra large dimension or braneworld scenarios .",

    "for a scalar field @xmath4 in a curved spacetime background we start with the action @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the determinant of the @xmath2-dimensional spacetime metric , and @xmath42 is the lagrangian for the scalar field @xmath43 , given by @xmath44\\phi^2(x)\\right\\}.\\ ] ] here @xmath18 is the mass of the field quanta , and it is assumed there is a coupling between the scalar and gravitational fields of the form @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the coupling constant and @xmath47 is the ricci scalar of the background spacetime . minimal coupling corresponds to @xmath48 , while for @xmath49 ( @xmath50 in @xmath35 ) the field is conformally coupled when @xmath51 , i.e.   the action is invariant under conformal transformations of the type @xmath52 and @xmath53 . varying the action of eq .",

    "quantization reveals that the field is composed of particles obeying certain commutation relations , and one wants to know how these particles move or propagate in the given curved background spacetime .",
    "a propagator is usually defined by modifying the klein - gordon equation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : waveeqforphi ] ) , so as to include a source term @xmath56 such that @xmath57 .",
    "this equation may be solved using the standard theory of green s functions .",
    "one of the green s functions , or propagators , that can be defined is @xmath58 , which satisfies @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the dirac delta function .",
    "the solution for @xmath4 is then @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is a function that satisfies the klein - gordon equation without a source term and @xmath4 corresponds to a quantum field operator acting on some state .",
    "interestingly , vacuum expectation values of products of field operators can be identified with the green s function of the wave equation , as we now show .",
    "the propagation of a free test particle in a vacuum @xmath5 can be described by the correlation function @xmath63 , where @xmath64 creates a particle at @xmath65 , which in turn is annihilated by @xmath4 at @xmath66 .",
    "this makes sense if @xmath67 .",
    "analogously , the correlation function @xmath68 , describes the propagation of a particle created by @xmath4 at time @xmath66 , which in turn is annihilated by @xmath64 at @xmath65 .",
    "this makes sense if @xmath69 . to obtain a correlation function , or propagator , that has physical meaning in relativistic quantum field theory , either @xmath70 or @xmath71 is used , depending on the sign of the relative time .",
    "so to obtain a physically meaningful propagator that combines both @xmath70 and @xmath71 we can use @xmath72 , where dyson s time ordering product operator @xmath39 is defined as @xmath73 , with @xmath74 for @xmath75 and @xmath76 for @xmath77 .",
    "to call @xmath78 the `` time ordered product '' is apt since the operators occurring under the symbol @xmath39 are arranged from right to left with increasing times .",
    "such a propagator is called the feynman propagator , and one can show that this time ordered product of fields is indeed the feynman green s function defined by eq.([eq : waveeqforgreensfunction ] ) , i.e. @xmath79 using the klein - gordon equation , eq.([eq : waveeqforphi ] ) , and the properties of the step function @xmath80 , one finds @xmath81 care should be taken since the step functions are time - dependent , and instead of zero the result is a distribution @xmath82 concentrated at equal times .",
    "thus it follows that the vacuum expectation value @xmath83 is essentially one of the green s functions of the covariant generalized klein - gordon operator , and we are justified in calling it the feynman green s function @xmath84 . in other words , the analysis shows that the feynman propagator is a green s function of the klein - gordon equation .    usually in quantum field theory the equation connecting green s functions and expectation values , such as eq .",
    "( [ eq : fgreenfunction ] ) , gives a bridge between the theory of propagators , in which scattering amplitudes are written in term of green s functions , and the theory of operators , where everything is written in terms of the quantum field @xmath4 .",
    "one finds the operators and expectation values , thus obtaining the green s functions important for interaction theory .",
    "we see that in our study , the connection is inverted  we want @xmath85 at the point @xmath6 by expressing operator theory in terms of the green s function and so we calculate the green s function . thus , eq .   ( [ eq : fgreenfunction ] ) operates as a kind of duality .",
    "since we are interested in the coincidence limit , feynman s green function is the best to use because it is more physical and also because the boundary conditions allow a wick rotation of the equation to euclidean space , where @xmath86 the euclidean green s function , @xmath87 , now obeys @xmath88 where @xmath89 is now the laplace - beltrami operator in @xmath2-dimensional curved euclidean space .",
    "there are advantages to working in euclidean space .",
    "for instance , elliptic operators are more easily handled than hyperbolic operators , and after obtaining the euclidean results one can wick rotate back to lorentzian spacetime using eq.([eq : fgreenfunctionequationeuclidean ] ) since the boundary conditions for the feynman propagator are automatically imposed by this procedure .",
    "the feynman green s function , or alternatively the euclidean green s function , is defined in terms of expectation values of products of field operators in the pure vacuum state .",
    "this is fine for describing the system at zero temperature . to go further and describe a system at nonzero temperature one has to take into account that the system is no longer in a pure state , it is statistically distributed over all possible states",
    ". the full weight of statistical physics must be used , and the green s functions are given by the average , suitably weighted , over all pure states of the expectation value of the products of field operators in those pure states ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the standard approach now used for calculating @xmath90 was laid down by anderson @xcite , based on earlier works by candelas and howard @xcite .",
    "we start with the euclidean metric for a static spacetime in @xmath2 dimensions with line element @xmath91 here @xmath92 is the euclidean time , @xmath93 , @xmath94 is a kind of radial coordinate , and @xmath95 represents a @xmath96-dimensional angular space .",

    "the preceding discussion on the connection between the green s function and the expectation value @xmath0 allows us to calculate @xmath0 in the hartle - hawking vacuum .",
    "there are three difficulties when evaluating these expressions in the coincidence limit .",
    "the first is that the equation of motion for the radial function @xmath114 ( equivalently @xmath115 ) is quite complicated , with exact solutions only available for zero frequency .",
    "asymptotic solutions are obtainable in closed form for massless fields on the horizon of schwarzschild and reissner - nordstrm black holes @xcite",
    ". partially analytical and numerical evaluations of the radial modes occupy the bulk of current research on this topic and will not be discussed here .",
    "the other two difficulties are that the sums over both @xmath116 and @xmath117 ( equivalently the integral over @xmath118 ) produce divergences .",
    "the divergence resulting from the sum over @xmath116 is actually only an apparent divergence and may be easily remedied .",
    "the standard trick is to realize that , given the delta function dependence , we are free to add a term proportional to the delta function .",
    "the large @xmath116 contributions are then eliminated with the help of a wkb approximation .",

    "the high frequency modes of the field probe the spacetime geometry in a small neighborhood of an event .",
