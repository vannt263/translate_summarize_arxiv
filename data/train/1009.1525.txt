    "the importance of radiation recoil forces on both orbital motion and rotation of minor bodies in the solar system has been commonly appreciated over the last decade .",
    "the yarkovsky effect , caused by lagged thermal radiation from the surface of a spinning body ( directly detected in the orbital motion of 6489 golevka @xcite and 1992  bf @xcite ) , has occurred to be the key to the proper understanding of asteroid long - term dynamics . since",
    "the paper of @xcite , the influence of torques due to radiation recoil is known as the yorp ( yarkovsky - okeefe - radzievskii - paddack ) effect , acknowledging the works of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "unlike the orbital yarkovsky effect , yorp involves both the scattering of incident light and its thermal re - radiation , and it occurs even for objects with zero conductivity .",
    "direct detections of yorp effect in the rotation of asteroids 54509  yorp @xcite , 1862  apollo @xcite , 1620  geographos @xcite , and 3103  eger @xcite , has proved the existence of yorp . on the other hand ,",
    "however , the agreement between the observed and modeled values in each case can be qualified as merely having a similar order of magnitude and all present yorp models are still simplified and incomplete .",
    "what is worse , the failure to detect a theoretically predicted yorp effect for 25143 itokawa @xcite has helped to realize an extreme sensitivity of these simplified models to the fine details of shape , centre of mass location and spin axis orientation in the body frame @xcite .",
    "most of these models assume that both scattering and thermal radiation is lambertian , i.e. a photon can be emitted or scattered with equal probability in any direction , hence the exiting flux is proportional to the cosine of zenith distance according to the projected area of the radiating / scattering surface element .",
    "although @xcite mentioned a more general scattering model , their work on yorp for spheroids was based on the lambertian assumption .",
    "@xcite added a specular reflection to the lambertian scattering , but such an improvement has no effect on the mean torque , as observed by @xcite and proved by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite made a step further , using a hemispheric albedo derived from the scattering model of @xcite instead of the usual bond albedo @xcite .",
    "moreover , the taco model of statler for the first time incorporates the important observation that photons bouncing between various surface elements do not produce the net torque until they they finally exit into outer space .",
    "the main objective of the present work is to include a non - lambertian scattering and radiation into the recent yorp model of @xcite and judge the significance of this improvement . roughly speaking",
    ", a departure from the lambertian model is essentially caused by interreflections and occlusions .",
    "both phenomena occur at various levels of resolution and one has to be careful about this issue . out of the two principal scattering models for asteroids surface developed by @xcite and hapke @xcite we have chosen the latter .",
    "however , both models were created to interpret photometric observations ; as such , they attempt to include phenomena happening at various resolution levels that merge in the final integrated brightness . in these circumstances ,",
    "our present paper focuses on accounting for the regolith grain size ( @xmath0 ) scale phenomena described by an appropriate part of the hapke reflectance and emissivity models .",
    "it means ignoring the macroscopic roughness corrections and shape - dependent beaming factors .",
    "interreflections occurring between larger surface fragments require a different approach and will be discussed in another article , whereas the large scale occlusions ( shadowing ) are already incorporated in most of existing yorp models . to a large extent",
    "the present contribution has been motivated by the problem of yorp effect on a high albedo asteroid 3103  eger , where only a convex shape model is available , so larger scale interreflections have to be neglected anyway .",
    "we decided to present a detailed derivation of the radiation recoil force and associated yorp torque using the terminology of modern radiometry instead of traditional astrophysical framework dating back to @xcite . in this respect",
    "we owe much to the collection of max fairbairn essays available on - line thanks to j.b .",

    "consider an infinitesimal element @xmath1 of an atmosphereless celestial body surface .",
    "further , we call @xmath1 _ a physical surface _ , to distinguish it from _ a normal surface _ i.e. an infinitesimal surface perpendicular to some specified direction of incident or emitted radiation .    local solar frame ( lsf ) will be defined with the origin at the centre of @xmath1 , with @xmath2-axis pointing to the intersection of the meridian passing through the sun and the horizon plane , @xmath3-axis directed along the outward normal to the physical surface ( i.e. to the local zenith ) , and @xmath4-axis completing the right - handed orthogonal system .",
    "then the unit vector directed to the sun has a simple form @xmath5 depending only on the solar zenith distance through its cosine @xmath6 and sine @xmath7    if the sun is located at the distance @xmath8 , the _ collimated radiation flux density _ ( power per normal area perpendicular to @xmath9 ) arriving from the point @xmath10 is @xmath11 where the solar constant @xmath12 is defined for nominal distance @xmath13 .",
    "_ irradiance _ or _ insolation _",
    "@xmath14 of an arbitrarily oriented surface element is the ratio of the incident power flux @xmath15 to the physical area @xmath1 .",
    "accounting for the area projection factor @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the unit vector directed to zenith , we can write @xmath18 the visibility function @xmath19 is either 1 , when the sun is visible at @xmath1 , or 0 , when the sun is occluded .",
    "incident radiant power @xmath20 is partially absorbed ( converted into heat ) and partially reflected in various directions @xmath21 @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the cosine of the zenith distance and @xmath24 is the azimuth angle in lsf .",
    "the cosine of the phase angle between @xmath9 and @xmath21 will be designated @xmath25 , and defined as the scalar product @xmath26    the power flux @xmath27 scattered from @xmath1 into a solid angle @xmath28 in direction @xmath21 is described by _ reflected radiance _",
    "@xmath30 where @xmath31 is the normal surface perpendicular to @xmath21 .",
    "writing @xmath32 we should bear in mind an implicit dependence on the sun direction @xmath9 , because the reflected power depends on the incident flux from the sun as well .",
    "this dependence becomes more explicit , when we introduce a bidirectional reflectance distribution function ( brdf ) @xmath33 defined as the ratio of the radiance @xmath29 reflected in the direction @xmath21 to the irradiance @xmath14 from the energy source located in the direction @xmath9 @xmath34 although a bidirectional reflectance ( bdr ) function  @xmath35 @xmath36 seems to be more common in planetary photometry than brdf , we choose @xmath33 as a more convenient quantity offering , for example , the reciprocity relation @xmath37 . using eq .",
    "( [ brdf ] ) we can express the reflected radiance as @xmath38   + recalling for the reference a traditional , lambertian brdf with albedo @xmath39 @xmath40 we adopt the anisotropic brdf proposed by hapke , namely its version from @xcite without macroscopic roughness effects @xmath41,\\ ] ] where the henyey - greenstein particle phase function is @xmath42^{-\\frac{3}{2}},\\ ] ] and the opposition surge function @xmath43 is defined as @xmath44^{-1},\\ ] ] with @xmath45    the chandrasekhar multiple scattering function @xmath46 is defined in terms of an integral equation @xcite , but we use the explicit second order approximation given by @xcite @xmath47^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath48 thus , apart from the incoming and scattered flux directions @xmath9 and @xmath21 , the hapke brdf depends on four physical parameters of the surface : single scattering albedo @xmath49 , regolith compaction parameter @xmath50 , the opposition surge amplitude @xmath51 ( sometimes replaced by @xmath52 ) , and the asymmetry factor of the henyey - greenstein function @xmath53 .",
    "a more recent version of reflectance was proposed by @xcite ; the modification amounts to adding the dependence on porosity as a multiplicative factor in @xmath33 and a divisor in the argument of @xmath46 .",
    "this modification is easy to implement , but we suspend its use until controversies concerning the dependence of the opposition effect on porosity are resolved @xcite . + the total power flux @xmath54 emitted into the hemisphere @xmath55 divided by the emitting physical area is termed _ radiant exitance _",
    "@xmath57 recalling the definition ( [ radiance ] ) , we find for the exitance due to scattering @xmath58 but , according to eq .",
    "( [ brdf ] ) , radiance is related to irradiance by the brdf @xmath33 , hence @xmath59 and the dependence on the sun location @xmath9 appears explicitly .    at this point",
    "we can introduce the notion of hemispheric albedo @xmath60 as the ratio @xmath61 combining eqs .",
    "( [ exit:2 ] ) and ( [ ah : def ] ) we see that @xmath62 and eq .",
    "( [ exit:2 ] ) is simplified to @xmath63    for a given set of hapke parameters the integral ( [ ha ] ) can be evaluated numerically on a sufficiently dense set of @xmath6 values , allowing to construct an appropriate approximating function . using the least squares adjustment",
    "we construct @xmath64 where the bond albedo @xmath65 , defined as @xmath66 is the mean slope of the product @xmath67 , and the coefficients @xmath68 of a simple rational approximation describe the deviation from the linear model .",
    "we focus on the properties of @xmath67 , because in next sections the hemispheric albedo will always appear multiplied by the cosine of the sun s zenith distance .",
    "note , that the adjustment of @xmath69 leads to different values of @xmath68 , degrading the quality of approximation of the product @xmath70 .",
    "although the geometric ( or physical ) albedo is not directly involved in the computation of radiation recoil force , we need it to select an appropriate value of @xmath49 for the hapke model , since usually the observations provide for an asteroid only the geometric albedo and the spectral type .",
    "let us begin with the notion of _ intensity _ @xmath71 .",
    "in contrast to the previously discussed quantities , intensity refers to the power @xmath72 emitted from the whole body surface ( not only from an infinitesimal @xmath1 ) in some direction @xmath73 , divided by the solid angle @xmath28 centered at @xmath73 @xmath74 the geometric albedo @xmath75 is the ratio of observed intensity of some presumably spherical object to the intensity of lambertian disk with the same diameter as the assumed sphere  both observed from the direction to the sun , i.e. with zero phase angle .",
    "this leads to the integral definition @xmath76    @xcite provide expressions that allow to compute hapke parameters @xmath50 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 for various spectral types as functions of a given geometric albedo @xmath75 and the mean slope parameter @xmath77 of the iau two - parameter magnitude system @xcite .      the energy leaving a surface element @xmath1",
    "does not consist only of scattered radiation .",
    "if the element has temperature @xmath78 , it also emits thermal radiation .",
    "radiant exitance @xmath79 through @xmath80 for a black body is given by the stefan - boltzmann law @xmath81 where @xmath82 , is the stefan - boltzmann constant , and @xmath83 is the black body value of a more general thermal radiation power flux @xmath84 .",
    "the point black body radiation is by definition isotropic , whereas a black body surface radiation is lambertian , so the associated radiance @xmath85 in the direction @xmath21 is obtained from the general definition of a _ thermally emitted radiance _",
    "@xmath86 analogous to ( [ lr ] ) @xmath87 dividing the exitance @xmath79 by the ` @xmath23-averaged ' solid angle of a hemisphere @xmath88 @xmath89 indeed , using ( [ lb ] ) and the definition of exitance , we verify that @xmath90    _ hemispheric emissivity _",
    "@xmath91 is defined as the ratio of actual thermal exitance @xmath92 to the black body exitance @xmath79 @xmath93 this global quantity should not be confused with a _ directional emissivity _",
    "@xmath94 , defined as the ratio of radiances @xmath95 directional emissivity plays the role similar to that of brdf in scattering , although their definitions essentially differ : the former is dimensionless ratio of two radiances , while the latter ( with dimension @xmath96 ) is the ratio of radiance to irradiance .",
    "so , the thermally emitted radiance in the direction of @xmath21 can be expressed as @xmath97   + in present study we adopt the directional emissivity function of hapke @xcite @xmath98 where @xmath49 is hapke s single scattering albedo , and the chandrasekhar function @xmath46 is given by eq .",

    "we do not introduce the beaming factor in our model for a number of reasons : i ) the part of beaming that depends on grain size scale radiation transfer should be present in the emissivity function of hapke , ii ) the contribution of thermal lag to the beaming factor is present in the surface temperature model with conductivity , iii ) larger scale radiation exchange contribution @xcite will be included in future extensions of our model together with optical interreflections .",
    "conservation of energy implies , that the total power scattered , thermally re - emitted , and conducted inside the body , should be equal to the incident power flux @xmath104 . in terms of power density ( per physical surface )",
    "it means that @xmath105 i.e. irradiance e is equal to the sum of total radiant exitance @xmath56 and of the conducted heat flux density @xmath106 . given a nonzero surface conductivity @xmath107 , we have @xmath108 and then @xmath109 or @xmath110 if @xmath111 , eq .",

    "the force can be easily expressed in terms of emitted radiance , provided we introduce a _ radiance vector _",
    "@xmath115 where @xmath116 is the sum of scattered @xmath29 and thermal @xmath86 .",

    "as far as photometry of solar system bodies is concerned , the bidirectional reflectance model elaborated by hapke leads to significantly different results than the basic lambertian framework . but the yorp effect in rotation period occurs to be almost insensitive to the scattering / emission model and even at highest observed albedo values the difference between the two models does not increase to more than 10 percent .",
    "however , this low sensitivity should not be interpreted as the evidence of insensitivity of the scattered radiation torque on reflectivity model .",
    "actually , the situation quite opposite .",
    "even for a given bond albedo value , the part of the yorp torque originating from the recoil of reflected light significantly depends on the form of brdf .",
    "but the conservation of energy implies that in the absence of conductivity the sum of scattered and thermally re - radiated energy is always equal to the incident energy .",
    "if the hemispheric albedo in some reflection model is higher than the bond albedo of the lambert case , more power is scattered , but also less power is thermally re - emitted and vice versa ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ecm ] ) . actually , the same mechanism of energy balance is responsible the independence of yorp on albedo and emissivity in the traditional rubincam approximation with lambertian scattering / emission . in the 1d thermal model considered in our paper",
    "the @xmath133 component behaves exactly like in the rubincam s approximation , so the dependence on reflectance is only due to secondary effects  mostly related with the small deviation of the recoil force from the normal to the surface .",
    "using a more elaborate scattering method is more important in the part of the yorp effect responsible for the orientation of the spin axis . in rubincam approximation ,",
    "the situation is similar to that of @xmath133 .",
    "but the rubincam approximation itself is definitely unrealistic for the attitude even at moderate values of conductivity .",
    "the influence of heat conduction is proportional to the absorbed fraction of incident energy , hence to the albedo .",
    "it means that two scattering models with different dependence of hemispheric albedo on sun zenith distance will differently affect the balance between scattered and re - radiated power .",
    "this explains why using the hapke brdf instead of lambertian model is more important for @xmath134 and @xmath135 , then for @xmath133 .",
