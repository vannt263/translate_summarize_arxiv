    "the hr8799 planetary system remains unique as the only system to have multiple , directly imaged , planets @xcite .",
    "four planets orbiting hr8799 have been monitored regularly since their discovery , providing the astrometric data needed to estimate their orbital properties and masses .",
    "the current astrometric data indicate that all four planets are less than 13 @xmath10@xcite .    the planets are frequently observed for the purposes of characterizing their atmospheric properties and , in particular , their chemical compositions .",
    "the two outer most planets , b and c , have the most comprehensive wavelength coverage including near - infrared ( near - ir ) spectroscopy at low , @xmath11 @xcite and medium , @xmath12 @xcite resolutions .",
    "the gemini planet imager ( gpi ) has measured low resolution spectra of planets c and d @xcite .",
    "spectroscopy of multiple planets orbiting hr8799 allows direct comparisons of atmospheric compositions for a coeval set of planets formed from the same protoplanetary disk .",
    "the only other planetary system for which such a comparison is currently feasible is our own solar system .",
    "the giant planets in our solar system were likely born with bulk compositions determined by their initial location in the planetary disk and the specific solid - to - gas ( m@xmath13/m@xmath14 ) accretion history they experienced . as these initially hot planets cooled with time , their atmospheres experienced various levels of vertical mixing and condensation . the atmospheric composition may have been further altered by continued accretion of solid bodies or mixing with a deep metal rich core .",
    "consequently , the present - day mole fractions for important trace molecules ( h@xmath1o , ch@xmath2 , co@xmath1 , co , nh@xmath15 , n@xmath1 ) of giant planets in our solar system are the result of numerous chemical and physical processes .",
    "inferring elemental abundances from molecular abundances requires a clear understanding of the atmospheric chemical and dynamical history . even for jupiter and saturn only upper limits on carbon - to - oxygen ratio ( c / o )",
    "have been measured , a poignant reminder of how challenging such measurements can be @xcite . despite this complex connection between present - day composition and the composition at birth ,",
    "it remains plausible that the present - day molecular abundances hold clues pertaining to the formation history of our giant planets . by observing _",
    "young _ giant planets , like those orbiting hr8799 , billions of years of atmospheric evolution that blurs the connection between atmospheric properties and the formation process is avoided .",
    "presented below are new observations of hr8799  b  that provide comparable wavelength coverage , spectral resolution and signal - to - noise ( snr ) as similar observations of hr8799  c  that revealed individual resolved water and carbon monoxide absorption features ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter k13 ) . for hr8799",
    "b , the mole fractions of these two molecules as well as methane are determined using well - resolved spectral features . from these mole fractions ,",
    "the coefficient of eddy diffusion ( @xmath16 ) and c / o are estimated .",
    "hr8799  b  was observed in 2013 on july 25 , 26 and 27 ( ut ) with the osiris instrument @xcite in the @xmath0 band using an identical instrument configuration as previous work by this group ( * ? ? ? * hereafter b11 ) resulting in 5.2 hrs of on - target integration time under good observing conditions .",
    "the data were calibrated and rectified to produce three - dimensional basic calibrated data cubes @xcite .",
    "the data were initially binned to @xmath17 and speckles suppressed following b11 . as in b11 , at low-@xmath18 , the spectrum snr is limited by residual correlated speckle noise . despite the increase in signal from combining the 2009 to 2013 observations , the updated low-@xmath18 spectrum has mostly unchanged uncertainties and matches the earlier b11 spectrum .",
    "the @xmath0-band spectrum was absolute flux calibrated using the @xmath19 magnitude ( @xmath20 ) reported in b11 .    at the full resolution and sampling provided by osiris",
    ", errors in flux are correlated across several wavelength channels and may alter the relative depth of narrow absorption features . subtracting the continuum , modeled as a smoothed version of the observed spectrum , removes many residual speckle artifacts that vary smoothly with wavelength ( k13 ) .",
    "inevitably , however , speckle artifacts that depend more strongly on wavelength ( e.g. , produced by optics near the focal plane ) likely remain even in a continuum - subtracted spectrum . despite potential lingering artifacts , this strategy worked well in k13 and",
    "is adopted here using the ensemble of data from 2009 through 2013 , median - combined into a single spectrum . given the wide angular separation of hr8799  b , residual speckle artifacts should be less severe than they were for hr8799  c. the rms uncertainties in the continuum - subtracted spectrum closely matches the photon - noise limit . the low-@xmath18 spectra from various observing runs",
    "show no significant differences across this four year time frame and intrinsic variability would likely occur over timescales of days rather than years and impact broader wavelength ranges than the spectral lines of interest .",
    "for this study , the grid of exoplanet atmospheres models described in b11 was updated to include the methane linelist from @xcite supplemented with optical opacities from @xcite .",
    "the former update added approximately 10 billion transitions to the overall molecular opacities and improves the accuracy of line strengths at high temperatures  across the @xmath0-band alone there are roughly a billion transitions .",
    "the methane abundance is low in non - equilibrium chemistry models appropriate for hr8799  b  ( b11 ) and , consequently , there were only minor changes to the model atmosphere structures after this opacity update . nevertheless , the exomol methane list is currently the most accurate and complete list available and the observations analyzed here have a resolution where accurate line data are important when studying atmospheric abundances .",
    "the opacity of solid and liquid particles suspended in the atmosphere ( clouds ) are included using the parameterized intermediate cloud model described in b11 .",
    "briefly , the lower boundary of the clouds are determined by chemical equilibrium while the upper boundary is described by an exponential decay that begins at a specified pressure .",
    "this outer pressure is a free parameter that establishes the cloud thickness , allowing for a range of models with cloud opacity between the high ( dusty ) and cloud - free ( cond ) cases often used to bracket the importance of clouds @xcite .",
    "the particle size distribution is a log - normal with mean size set to 5 @xmath21 m .",
    "cloud thickness plays an important role in determining the overall spectral shape and is included as a free parameter in the model fits discussed below ( following b11 ) .",
    "synthetic spectra were calculated with a wavelength sampling of 0.05  from 1.4 to 2.5 @xmath21 m .",
    "each of these synthetic spectra was convolved with a gaussian kernel with fwhm matching the osiris spectral resolution before interpolating onto the observed wavelength grid .",
    "these medium - resolution spectra were continuum - subtracted following the steps in k13 .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] compares the @xmath22 spectrum of hr8799  b  to that of hr8799  c. both exoplanet spectra contain a similar set of absorption features , with most of the similarities at wavelengths of prominent h@xmath1o absorption ; however , most lines are deeper in the spectrum of b. the co ( 2,0 ) band - head at @xmath9 2.3 @xmath21 m is detected now with medium spectral resolution but only marginally present at low-@xmath18 ( b11 ) .",
    "this band - head appears slightly deeper and has a shallower slope in the spectrum of b than c , the result of stronger water absorption and additional ch@xmath2  lines for hr8799  b  in this wavelength range .",

    "peaks in the ccfs are found for all three molecules at identical velocities , centered on zero km / s . as was the case for hr8799  c , a peak with maximum near 1",
    "is found for h@xmath1o , indicating that this molecule contributes most of the spectral lines .",
    "co also shows the characteristic ringing pattern , produced by near - repeating patterns of co  lines , many separated by roughly 200 km / s in velocity .",
    "this same ccf pattern was found for co in hr8799  c  by k13 , with peak of 0.6 compared to 0.4 here .",
    "a peak in the ccf for ch@xmath2  is present , but not as prominent as found for h@xmath1o , mainly because much of the weak - line information is blended with other stronger lines at this resolution .",
    "@xmath4-band observations were previously obtained using the same telescope and instrument combination as used for @xmath0-band and were originally analyzed at low resolution in b11 .",
    "these data have been reanalyzed and continuum - filtered at full resolution ( also @xmath22 ) following the same steps as @xmath0 band .",
    "the average snr of these data is about 3 times lower than the @xmath0 band data and show a pattern of lines that are visually difficult to identify .",
    "b11 concluded that water is the dominant molecular opacity source in this wavelength range and this is confirmed here by a cross - correlation analysis .",
    "the ccfs for h@xmath1o  and ch@xmath2  templates across the @xmath4 band are plotted in figure [ figcc2 ] .",
    "correlating the data with an @xmath4-band h@xmath1o  template yields a strong peak in the ccf ( fig .",

    "no peak was detected for an @xmath4-band ch@xmath2  template ( using the exomol list ) .",
    "the hr8799  b  @xmath0-band spectrum also correlates well with the hr8799  c  spectrum , another indication that both planet spectra share similar spectral patterns of h@xmath1o  and co  lines .",
    "the ccf was also recalculated for hr8799  c  using the new ch@xmath2  template and no peak was found , confirming the non - detection of ch@xmath2  reported by k13 .      for the atmospheric abundance study presented below , it is important that the underlying thermal structure of the models , especially across most of the photosphere , is reasonably correct .",
    "atmospheres of giant planets are generally close to local thermodynamic equilibrium and , thus , a model matching the planet s spectral energy distribution over a wide wavelength range should have a thermal profile that reasonably approximates the planet s average thermal structure . a similar model comparison as performed by b11",
    "was repeated , but comparing updated models with the new ch@xmath2  list to the new medium - resolution unfiltered spectrum discussed above and additional flux calibrated data spanning 1 to 5 @xmath21 m . for wavelengths less than 1.8 @xmath21 m",
    "the z / y - band flux of @xcite , the low-@xmath18 p1640 @xmath23-band spectrum @xcite and the @xmath4-band spectrum from b11 were used .",

    "the data used for the model fits are plotted in figure [ figmodcomp1 ] .",
    "the relative flux calibration of the near - ir spectra from osiris and p1640 could impact the model comparisons , as these spectra are calibrated using @xmath4 and @xmath19 photometry that have a range of reported values and uncertainties @xcite .",

    "such potential issues are not accounted for here and the @xmath4 and @xmath0 flux calibration described in b11 is used . a small scaling",
    "was applied so that the @xmath4-band portion of the p1640 spectrum matches the @xmath4-band osiris spectrum , resulting in a slight change in the absolute fluxes of the p1640 @xmath23-band spectrum plotted in figure [ figmodcomp1 ]",
    ".    example spectra of the best matching solar abundance models are plotted in figure [ figmodcomp1 ] , for a range of @xmath24  between 900 and 1100k and @xmath25  between 3.0 and 4.0 .",
    "the best matching model has the same gravity as found previously by b11 ( @xmath25  = 3.5 ) but cooler ( @xmath24  = 1000k ) . across the near - ir ,",
    "the model spectra do a reasonable job reproducing the observations .",
    "when fitting the observations ( photometric and spectroscopic ) , all data are weighted equally . between 3 and 5@xmath21 m , however , the model comparisons to available photometric data ( from a variety of telescopes , epochs and image processing methods ) show disagreements at @xmath26 and @xmath27 @xmath21 m . similar levels of disagreement at this wavelength are seen in other model comparisons @xcite .",
    "these photometric observations probe similar atmospheric depths and , therefore , pull model fits in opposite directions in both @xmath24  and @xmath25 .",
    "further observations across this spectral region is probably warranted .",
    "previous studies of hr8799  b  result in a range of @xmath24  between 750 and 1200k and @xmath25  between 3 and 4.5 ( see marley et al . 2012 , their table 1 ) , encompassing the range explored here",

    "such forced agreement can be useful , but is not done here .",
    "more important is finding a range of atmospheric temperature - pressure profiles that yield pseudo - continua that are as consistent as possible with the observed spectral energy distribution .",
    "good agreement between bulk parameters found by atmosphere - only fitting and those inferred from cooling tracks , age and luminosity can be challenging for low - temperature planet - mass objects , likely a result of complexities of their atmospheres not reproducible by time - independent one - dimensional models with simplistic cloud prescriptions .",
    "consequently , a conservative ranges of @xmath25  ( @xmath29 0.5 ) and @xmath24  ( @xmath29 100k ) around the best matching values are used for the abundance analysis discussed below , despite potential inconsistencies with cooling track predictions at the high and low ends of these ranges .      at low spectral resolution ,",
    "the slopes on either side of the @xmath0-band peak are very similar to those seen in substellar atmospheres where water is the dominant opacity source .",
    "b11 showed ( their fig .",
    "14 ) that co  and ch@xmath2  likely contribute to the @xmath0-band opacity but , at low resolution , the co  band head was not confidently detected nor any significant hints of ch@xmath2 , making it difficult to assess their relative importance .",
    "@xcite also found no evidence of methane absorption in their narrow - band spectrum covering @xmath30 to 2.2 @xmath21 m .",
    "with resolved absorption features from all three molecules identified , their individual abundances can now be determined .",
    "evidence for quenching of co  and ch@xmath2  in the atmospheres of the hr8799 planets has been established elsewhere @xcite .",
    "an important consequence of this mixing - induced non - equilibrium chemistry is that the mole fractions should be nearly independent of height across the photosphere .",
    "the absence of height - dependence greatly simplifies the parameterization of the mole fractions , allowing straightforward model fitting using standard @xmath31  minimization .",
    "the mole fractions are determined sequentially by computing grids of synthetic spectra ( continuum filtered ) with scaled molecular abundances for 9 different temperature - pressure ( t - p ) profiles corresponding to @xmath24  = 900 , 1000 , and 1100k and @xmath25  = 3.0 , 3.5 , and 4.0 .",
    "these temperatures and gravities bracket those found when comparing models to the broad wavelength data shown in figure [ figmodcomp1 ] .",
    "a spectrum is calculated for each mole fraction value and model temperature - pressure profile .",
    "the mole fractions of co , ch@xmath2 and h@xmath1o are each scaled from 0 to 1000 relative to their non - equilibrium solar abundance values using a uniform logarithmic sampling ( resulting in 100 synthetic spectra per t - p profile ) .",
    "the mole fraction of h@xmath1o was determined first , keeping co and ch@xmath2 at their solar values . to avoid biasing in the h@xmath1o mole fractions caused by overlapping co  or ch@xmath2  lines ,",
    "the fit was restricted to wavelengths less than the co  band head , while masking the strongest ch@xmath2 line region ( near 2.2 @xmath21 m ) . following this step ,",
    "a second grid of synthetic spectra was calculated with the h@xmath1o mole fraction equal to the best - fit value from the previous step , ch@xmath2 at its solar value , and now mole fractions of co scaled as previously done for h@xmath1o . in this case , only wavelengths greater than ( and including ) the co band head were fit , while masking the strong ch@xmath2line near 2.32 and 2.37@xmath21 m . in the final step , using the best - fitting h@xmath1o and co mole fractions , a third grid of synthetic spectra was made with scaled ch@xmath2 mole fractions . only the strongest ch@xmath2 lines from 2.2 to 2.37 @xmath21 m were included in this fit .",
    "the model with the overall lowest @xmath31 from this three - step fitting process has a slightly lower gravity ( @xmath25= 3.0 ) than the best matching solar abundance model compared to the full sed .",
    "the @xmath31 distributions for the mole fractions in this model are plotted in figure [ figmfs ] , with @xmath3 mole fractions of h@xmath1o , co and ch@xmath2 are @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 , respectively , with the model spectrum compared to the @xmath0-band observations in figure [ figmodcomp2 ] . both h@xmath1o  and co  are about half the non - equilibrium solar value while ch@xmath2  is about 15 times lower than the non - equilibrium solar value ( see vertical dashed lines in fig .",

    "these values can be compared to the range of solar ( non - equilibrium ) mole fractions by using figure [ figoberg2 ] ( see vertical dashed line ) , discussed below .",
    "the filtered @xmath0-band spectrum is used to determine the molecular abundances primarily because it is a single data set from a single instrument with uniformly characterized uncertainties .",
    "it is important , however , to verify that the resulting mole fractions still yield spectra that are in reasonable agreement with the full sed .",
    "figure [ figmodcomp3 ] compares model spectra to the full sed for three different @xmath24  and @xmath25  values and corresponding mole fractions listed in table 1 , and the comparisons remain good across the near - ir .",
    "the thermal ir includes absorption bands from ch@xmath2 , co and co@xmath1 , providing a potential secondary test of the abundances . in all cases , the model flux at 3.3@xmath21 m , which probes a methane fundamental absorption band , is close to the observed value .",
    "the fluxes across the co and co@xmath1 absorption bands between 4 and 5@xmath21 m  changes considerably for the range of values found here , however , the observed ground - based photometry , with measurements on either side of the absorption bands , do not probe co or co@xmath1 absorption well .    as discussed above ,",

    "uncertainties associated with these properties are difficult to quantify without a more complex statistical analysis of the model comparisons and is beyond the intended scope of this paper .",
    "for example , the mole fractions depend on the model atmosphere surface gravity , but it is unlikely the planet s gravity falls outside the range explored here , given the limits placed on gravity by other data .",
    "the details of the cloud properties ( coverage and thickness ) are partially mitigated by the continuum subtraction process but may still impact the inferred mole fractions indirectly though degeneracies in the surface gravity and effective temperature estimation .",

    "these abundances are plotted in figure [ figobergco ] for planets forming between the h@xmath1o  and co@xmath1 frostlines . in this model ,",
    "both c and o abundances are linear functions of solid accretion , m@xmath13/m@xmath51 , with slope and intercept set by the fraction of c ( or o ) sequestered by condensate formation and the overall grain / gas fraction in the disk .",
    "these assumptions are based on observations of protoplanetary disks and the interstellar medium ( see table 1 of berg et al .",
    "solar c and o abundances have been suggested for hr8799 @xcite and are adopted as the baseline here @xcite .",
    "it should be noted , however , that this star is a @xmath52-boo type star with solar c , n and o abundances but sub - solar fe - peak elements .",
    "a high level of solid accretion during planet formation raises both c and o abundances , with o abundances increasing more rapidly than c for the simple reason that h@xmath1o - ice is the most abundant solid between the h@xmath1o  and co@xmath1 frostlines .",
    "the combined effect is c / o decreasing as m@xmath13/m@xmath14 increases . the model proposed by berg et al .",
    "is a simple prescription for a complex process and , consequently , deviations from this model are to be expected . despite its simplicity , the predicted c and o abundances provide an ideal baseline for testing potential outcomes of ca formation specific to the hr8799 system .    in order to make a direct comparison to the k13 results , the observed spectrum of hr8799  b  was analyzed in a similar manner as hr8799",
    "c. given the ch@xmath2  update made to the model atmospheres , the fit was repeated for hr8799  c. only the c / o values for atmosphere accretion occurring between the h@xmath1o  and co@xmath1 frostlines ( the current locations of all four hr8799 planets ) were used ( see fig . [ figobergco ] ) .",
    "a @xmath31 was calculated for each continuum - subtracted synthetic spectrum in the @xmath24  and @xmath25  range described above .",
    "the resulting @xmath31 distributions are plotted in figure [ figoberg1 ] .",
    "the best - matching c / o for hr8799  b  is 0.66@xmath53 and the revised best - matching c / o for hr8799  c  is 0.64@xmath54 , closely matching k13 , but with a broader @xmath31  distribution .",
    "the new exomol methane absorption strengths across the @xmath0-band are lower than those from the @xcite linelist used in the k13 analysis resulting in smaller @xmath31  values for larger c / o and , hence , a broader distribution of @xmath31 .    the @xmath0-band continuum shape can also be used to estimate the relative abundance of h@xmath1o  and co. given the wider angular separation of b than c ( 1.7 versus 1 ) from the star ,",
    "the continuum of b is less affected by residual speckles . the observed spectrum , with continuum intact , was compared to the same set of atmosphere models and c and o abundances .",
    "the @xmath31distribution from this comparison is plotted in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ figoberg1 ] and shows both planets having c / o between @xmath55 and 0.7 , for similar @xmath56 as in the continuum filtered comparison .",
    "the mole fractions of h@xmath1o , co  and ch@xmath2  in the photosphere of the best - matching ca - specific atmosphere model can be compared to those found in ",
    "[ molefractions ] , where the molecular abundances were determined independent of any formation model .",
    "the mole fractions for the ca - specific atmosphere models are plotted in figure [ figoberg2 ] as functions of c / o , for the range of @xmath24  and @xmath25  explored here .",
    "solar ( non - equilibrium ) mole fractions and solar c / o are indicated in this figure by the vertical dashed line . the ca - specific atmosphere model with c / o @xmath57 has h@xmath1o  and ch@xmath2mole fractions that closely match those found in  [ molefractions ] .",
    "these values are plotted as red symbols with error bars estimated from the formal uncertainties in table 1 and the co abundances corresponding to the 1@xmath58 range in c / o .",
    "co , however , is higher than found in  [ molefractions ] for all c / o explored in the ca - specific atmospheres .",
    "even if @xmath25  and @xmath24  are varied ( see table 1 ) , the co found by freely scaling the abundances remains below what is predicted in the ca - specific atmospheres .",
    "lower @xmath16  would lower co , but doing so would quickly increase ch@xmath2  to values well above what is observed .",
    "a lower co  could indicate additional chemical processes not accounted for in the atmosphere or formation models .",
    "the significance of this co difference is hard to assess given the various source of uncertainty in the models not accounted for in the formal mole fraction error - bars .",
    "it is possible , for example , that the co line broadening in the atmosphere models is under ( or over ) estimated , resulting in systematic errors in the inferred abundances ( this will be investigated in a future paper ) .",
    "compared to h@xmath1o  and ch@xmath2 , co  has the weakest dependence on c / o .",
    "ch@xmath2  and h@xmath1o , however , are fairly sensitive to c / o , but their mole fractions can be small ( @xmath59 ) for super - solar c / o .",
    "measuring c / o from co alone would require a co abundance more precisely derived than most data presently allow . perhaps of greater interest , however , are the ratios of the various molecules as c / o changes .",
    "for example , for all but the smallest c / o , co / h@xmath1o  should be greater than 1 . only for low surface gravity ( @xmath60 ) do the model fits from  [ molefractions ] result in n(co ) @xmath61 n(h@xmath1o ) and , as gravity increase , the discrepancy between the predicted and observed co  and h@xmath1o  abundances grows .",
    "this may provide indirect evidence supporting low surface gravity for hr8799  b.",
    "a new @xmath0-band spectrum of hr8799  b , with spectral resolution of @xmath62 , was measured and simultaneous detections of water , carbon monoxide and methane absorption lines were made .",
    "identification of lines from each molecule is possible by eye and confirmed by cross - correlating the observed spectrum with absorption templates for each molecule .",
    "the abundance of each molecule was determined by a fitting procedure where the mole fractions are treated as free parameters in sequences of synthetic spectra .",
    "the ensemble of near - ir to thermal ir observations for hr8799  b  are best reproduced by an atmosphere with @xmath24= 1000 , @xmath25  = 3.5 .",
    "the @xmath3 mole fractions are found to be between -3.09 and -3.91 for h@xmath1o , between -3.30 and -3.72 for co , and between -5.06 and -5.85 for ch@xmath2 .",
    "the best matching models have c / o between 0.55 and 0.7 depending heavily on @xmath25 , as also found in k13 , with c / o decreasing with increasing @xmath25 .",
    "if the surface gravity is closer to @xmath25  = 4 , as predicted by hot - start cooling tracks @xcite , then co  would be less abundant than h@xmath1o  ( see table 1 ) with a c / o @xmath63 .",
    "such a situation would require c and o abundances that deviate from those predicted by the @xcite model , perhaps resulting from planetesimal accretion or core dredging .    a cross - correlation analysis of @xmath4-band data from b11 , taken at a similar spectral resolution as the @xmath0-band data , revealed no methane signature .",
    "a detection of ch@xmath2  absorption lines in the @xmath0-band but not in @xmath4 may seem unexpected when compared to late - type brown dwarfs that often show more prominent ch@xmath2  absorption in @xmath4 than @xmath0 . as shown here , the methane abundance in hr8799  b  is many orders of magnitude below that found in the atmospheres of field brown dwarfs , resulting in weaker methane absorption at all wavelengths . for photospheric temperatures and pressures appropriate for hr8799",
    "b , the average methane opacity ( in units of @xmath7/molecule ) across @xmath0 is about 10 times stronger than the average opacity across @xmath4 , while the average water opacity is about 10 times stronger than methane in @xmath4 and 10 times weaker than methane  in @xmath0 .",
    "consequently , water opacity likely overwhelms that of methane across the @xmath4 band .",
    "the characteristics of these opacity sources , combined with lower snr in the @xmath4-band data , all contribute to the non - detection of methane in the @xmath4-band spectrum .",
    "low methane abundance in hr8799  b  is consistent with previous studies of non - equilibrium chemistry in hot , low gravity atmospheres .",
    "the mixing ratio of ch@xmath2  in young giant exoplanets is , potentially , a useful probe of the vertical mixing . using the inferred ch@xmath2  abundance ,",
    "the coefficient of eddy diffusion was found to be greater than 10@xmath64 and very near 10@xmath65 @xmath7/s for the preferred @xmath24  = 1000k .",
    "these @xmath16  values are consistent with values appropriate for jupiter s deep troposphere @xcite .",
    "@xcite explore the topic of non - equilibrium ch@xmath2  in the context of young giant planets and their predictions are in good agreement with the values presented here .",
    "hr8799  b  and c are the first exoplanets to have c / o ratios determined from spectroscopic data with high snr and high spectral resolution ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "young giant planets , still orbiting their star beyond the h@xmath1o - frostline , provide important opportunities to study the link between formation and atmospheric chemistry .",
    "the c / o ratios of both hr8799  b  and c are similar and potentially super - stellar , but stellar values are not completely excluded .",
    "refinements of c / o and individual molecular abundances will require improvements in the determination of surface gravity , independent of evolutionary models , perhaps with near - ir observations at even higher spectral resolution",
    ". observations with the _ hubble space telescope _ , at wavelengths within near - ir water absorption bands , might also help narrow the range of allowed abundances found here ( rajan et al .",
    ", in prep ) .",
    "but comparisons to such data would face similar limitations as here , associate with effective temperature and gravity .",
    "more observations across the thermal infrared ( 3 to 5@xmath21 m ) , perhaps with future ground - based integral field spectrographs or with the _ james webb space telescope _ , could provide more complete coverage of strong ch@xmath2 , co and co@xmath1 absorption bands .",
    "new measurements across this wavelength range would also help improve effective temperature and gravity estimates .",
    "model uncertainties need to be better understood as well , in particular those associated with clouds and natural molecular line broadening .",
    "there are now three young directly imaged planet - mass companions ( hr8799  b , c and 2m1207b ) that show evidence of disequilibrium chemistry in their deep troposphere . while three is too few to constitute a trend ,",
    "the data and models suggest that chemical quenching is common among this class of exoplanet . for planets as warm as those orbiting hr8799",
    ", the quenching likely occurs below the condensation depths and , consequently , bulk c / o ratios are inferable form their photospheric h@xmath1o  and co  abundances .",
    "given the broad absorption features of these molecules , it may be possible to infer c / o for massive planets from the low resolution spectra provided by gpi , p1640 , and sphere .",
