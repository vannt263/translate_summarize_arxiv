    "since @xmath247 , @xmath248 , so ( again by lemma  [ sec : recurse - f ] applied to @xmath22 ) @xmath226 is odd .",
    "finally , the application of lemma  [ sec : recurse - f ] to @xmath5 shows that @xmath4 is odd .",
    "since the odd partitions of @xmath7 have a unique @xmath21-hook , the partition @xmath213 occurs in their @xmath21-quotients once , and the partition @xmath1 occurs @xmath149 times .",
    "thus there are @xmath21 possibilities for the @xmath21-quotient of such a partition once its @xmath21-core is fixed . since a partition",
    "is determined by its core and quotient , the second assertion of the lemma follows .",
    "in this article , we have described how macdonald s enumerative results on odd partitions are reflected in young s lattice .",
    "the enumerative result in macdonald s paper @xcite is a simple special case of his more general result on the enumeration of partitions @xmath5 for which @xmath4 is not divisible by a prime number @xmath15",
    ". it would be interesting to see how these more general enumerative results are reflected in young s lattice .",
    "however , this can not be achieved by using only the methods here .",
    "for instance , lemma  [ lemma : unique_hook ] does not hold for @xmath249 .",
    "also , the partitions @xmath5 with @xmath4 coprime to @xmath250 do not form a tree ( the partitions @xmath251 and @xmath60 both cover @xmath252 ; all three partitions have dimension coprime to @xmath250 ) .",
    "another promising direction of generalization is to replace young s lattice by an arbitrary @xmath110-differential poset .",
    "besides young s lattice , the best - known example of a @xmath110-differential poset is the young  fibonacci lattice ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  5 ) ) , denoted @xmath253 . for each @xmath254 , let @xmath255 denote the number of saturated chains in @xmath256 $ ] . using the construction of @xmath253 by reflection extension (",
    "* ? ? ? * section  2.2 ) , it is easy to prove the following .",
    "the subgraph induced in the hasse diagram of @xmath253 by the set of elements @xmath254 for which @xmath255 is odd is a binary tree where every element of even rank has one branch and every element of odd rank has two branches .        for the fibonacci @xmath31-differential poset with @xmath258 ,",
    "the subgraph induced in its hasse diagram by the subset of elements @xmath68 with an odd number of saturated chains in @xmath259 $ ] is a rooted tree if and only if @xmath31 is even . in this tree",
    "every node has @xmath31 branches .",
    "this research was driven by computer exploration using the open - source mathematical software ` sage `  @xcite and its algebraic combinatorics features developed by the ` sage - combinat ` community  @xcite .",
    "a. a. was supported in part by a ugc centre for advanced study grant .",
