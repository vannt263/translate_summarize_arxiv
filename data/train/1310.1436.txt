    "discovery of the @xmath0 resonance became the first in discovery of the resonant structures @xmath1 ( @xmath0 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) , the resonant interpretations of which assumes existence in them at least pair of heavy and pair of light quarks in this or that form .",
    "thousand articles on this subject already were published in spite of the fact that many properties of new resonant structures are not defined yet and not all possible mechanisms of dynamic generation of these structures are studied , in particular , the role of the anomalous landau thresholds is not studied .",
    "below we suggest an approach which allows to define the branching ratio of the @xmath2 decay studying only one more decay of @xmath0 into a non-@xmath4 channel and to select models the @xmath0 resonance .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we construct spectra of decays of the resonance @xmath0 with good analytical and unitary properties and define the range of values of the coupling constant of the @xmath0 resonance with the @xmath4 system . in sec .",
    "3 we show that the constructed spectra can effectively select the model proposed for the @xmath0 resonance .",

    "<S> enfant terrible of charmonium spectroscopy , the resonance @xmath0 , generated a stream of interpretations and ushered in a new exotic @xmath1 spectroscopy . in the meantime , many ( if not all ) characteristics of @xmath0 are rather ambiguous . </S>",
    "<S> we construct spectra of decays of the resonance @xmath0 with good analytical and unitary properties which allows to define the branching ratio of the @xmath2 decay studying only one more decay , for example , the @xmath3 decay . </S>",
    "<S> we next define the range of values of the coupling constant of the @xmath0 resonance with the @xmath4 system . </S>",
