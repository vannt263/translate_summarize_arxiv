    "the production and manipulation of ultracold molecular gases is a truly riveting physical adventure at the moment @xcite .",
    "interacting dipolar molecules confined to two dimensions are currently attracting substantial attention by way of its recent experimental realization and study of geometrical effects on chemical reactions @xcite .",
    "theoretically , this reduced dimensional setup has spurred immense interest and many promising proposals for novel many - body states exists @xcite .",
    "many of these studies ignore or make rough guesses as to which few - body states are allowed in a setup with adjacent two - dimensional ( 2d ) planes .",
    "an understanding of the basic building blocks is obviously crucial when trying to understand the complicated correlations in the many - body systems .",
    "the low - energy few - body spectrum with short - range interactions is well - known @xcite and gives rise to the famous efimov spectrum in three dimensions ( 3d ) @xcite and universal trimer states in 2d @xcite .",
    "however , the dipolar interactions is anisotropic and long - ranged and it is not clear that similar structures emerge .",
    "a prominent example of the influence of bound states on the many - body physics is the bcs - bec crossover in a two - component fermi gas with attractive short - range interactions @xcite . in the 2d case , the presence of a two - body bound dimer state plays a crucial role in the crossover @xcite",
    "this remains true for dipolar molecules in a bilayer with perpendicular polarization @xcite , and an effective dimerization of the system along these lines have been suggested in the multilayer setup @xcite . in the bilayer case , this can be infered from the dipolar potential which always supports a bound two - body state @xcite .",
    "however , there is a gap in our current knowledge of the stability of few - body states containing more than two molecules . in the present letter we give a complete characterization of the bound state structures for up to five layers with perpendicularly polarized dipoles ( see fig .",
    ".     illustrates the different chains that are the most stable configurations .",
    "three - body states are shown in @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and four - body states in @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath5 shows a non - chain five layer configuration , while @xmath6 is a picture of a weakly bound dimer with twice the layer separation . ]",
    "the most stable three - body trimer system is a chain with one molecule in each layer where the pairwise interactions are attractive at short distances @xcite .",
    "two molecules in the same layer will repel each other .",
    "the most interesting trimer is therefore three molecules in two layers where two pairs can form bound subsystems whereas one pair is entirely repulsive ( @xmath0 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the question is whether this trimer is bound with an energy below the dimer and a free molecule ( @xmath1 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this is a special case in 2d of a repelling pair where each is attracted by a third particle . the four - body tetramer system with a fourth molecule in the layer next to the repelling pair ( @xmath2 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) is much closer to stability with five bound two - body subsystems and only one repelling pair .",
    "the question here is if that structure has a lower energy than a bound string of three molecules and a free molecule ( @xmath3 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) where only three bound subsystems remain .",
    "this of course implies that adding more molecules in favorable configurations could produce stable structures .",
    "in the present letter we first rigourously prove that trimer and tetramer states are unstable for identical bosons or fermions in the layers .",
    "the mathematical method is very general and reduces the problem to a matter of geometrically identifying the threshold in the potential landscape of the systems .",
    "it can be applied to other systems where repulsive and attractive terms compete , like the study of excitons in carbon nanotubes @xcite or in organic semiconductors @xcite",
    ". a suitable reduction of the in - plane dipolar repulsion leads to bound complexes as all interlayer interactions support bound states .",
    "we expect that this can be achieved in different ways , either by applying an electric field gradient perpendicular to the planes , by having different molecules in the system , or by direct manipulation of the dipole interaction in each layer through microwave transitions @xcite . here",
    "we determine the critical repulsive strengths where stable structures emerge analytically and support our findings by detailed numerical calculations using the stochastic variational method @xcite .",
    "the schrdinger equation for @xmath7 particles with masses @xmath8 is @xmath9 with coordinates @xmath10 and energy @xmath11 . the interaction between particles @xmath12 and",
    "@xmath13 is @xmath14 , i.e. @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the interlayer distance and @xmath17 is the dipole moment of molecule @xmath12 .",
    "for @xmath18 we get the intralayer two - body @xmath19 repulsion , while @xmath20 produces the interlayer potentials when the separation is @xmath21 .",
    "the strengths are defined by the product @xmath22 , and given through the dimensionless quantities @xmath23 .",
    "the @xmath24 is modified at small distance by the transverse motion .",
    "this leads to the expression @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the confluent hypergeometric kummer function and @xmath27 is the width of the layer .",
    "we have checked that our results are insensitive to @xmath27 in the interval @xmath28 and the detailed properties at small distance are not important .",
    "note that we assume that there is no tunneling between the layers , which implies that symmetrization is only relevant for particles in the same plane .",
    "consider first the three - body system with molecules 1 and 2 in the same plane and molecule 3 in an adjacent plane ( @xmath0 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we assume that @xmath29 which may be different from @xmath30 .",
    "we denote the attractive and repulsive strengths by @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "notice that both @xmath33 and @xmath34 are positive .",
    "the reason we talk of an attractive interaction in this case is that the potential always supports a bound state @xcite .",
    "we shall now prove that the system is unbound for @xmath35 .",
    "clearly , the system is bound for a sufficiently small ratio @xmath36 .",
    "we can then , for any given @xmath33 , define a critical repulsive strength , @xmath37 $ ] ( which is thus a function of @xmath33 as indicated by the brackets ) , as the value where the energy precisely equals the two - body energy , @xmath38 $ ] , of the bound 13 and 23 ( interlayer ) subsystems , i.e. @xmath39=\\frac{e_2[\\lambda_a]-\\langle\\psi|t+\\lambda_a    v_{13}+\\lambda_a v_{23}|\\psi\\rangle } { \\langle\\psi|v_{12}|\\psi\\rangle } , \\;\\label{ins-1}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the kinetic energy operator and @xmath41 is the normalized wave function at the threshold for binding .",

    "this follows from the @xmath55 tail of the dipolar potential which is of shorter range than @xmath56 , which prohibits long - range correlations @xcite .",
    "the universal limit with a two - body cluster structure is therefore approached @xcite .",
    "we immediately conclude that @xmath57 is positive , where @xmath58 is the kinetic energy operator depending only on @xmath54 .",
    "thus , @xmath59 and the relative critical strength increases with @xmath33 .",
    "we now compute @xmath37/\\lambda_a$ ] for @xmath60 , which is equivalent to infinite masses and negligibly small kinetic energies .",
    "the critical repulsive strength is found when the total potential in all space becomes larger than the two - body energy .",
    "thus , the potential surface , @xmath61/\\lambda_a$ ] , depending on two relative coordinates , should have a minimum less than the minimum of the two - body potential in eq .  .",

    "four molecules in two layers are much less stable due to the additional repulsion . to study the stability when changing the repulsion , we consider two molecules in a single layer with @xmath64 and one molecules in each of the layers above and below it with @xmath65 , keeping the product @xmath66 fixed .",

    "resonances could exist at higher energies but the effective barriers are tiny for these potentials .",
    "a large width would immediately be accumulated and the resonance disappears by merging into the two - body continuum background .",
    "the fermion energies exceed the boson energies due to the antisymmetry which itself costs energy compared to symmetric systems .",
    "this is unavoidable in spite of the repulsion because the attraction at short distance must be larger to provide a bound state , implying that the two molecules in the same layer can not be far apart .",
    "the distance from stability is reflected in the critical repulsion below which the system is bound .",
    "the lower curves in fig .  [ fig3 ] show the numerical results for trimers . at large @xmath33 the analytical results @xmath78",

    "[ fig1 ] . as demonstrated in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , a chain of three molecules in three layers is more bound that two dimers .",
    "this can be understood since it gains energy from the attractive interaction of configuration @xmath6 in fig .",

    "the energies for the @xmath2 system are shown in fig .",

    "the structure of trimer and tetramer is contained in relative distances within the bound state . in the strong dipole limit ,",
    "all molecules remain close until the repulsion is extremely close to the threshold where one molecule eventually leaks out through the repulsive barrier .",
    "the universal limit of @xmath82 is approached from below but only for very small energies @xcite . for weak dipoles ,",
    "the wave functions are already distributed over large regions of space .",
    "our numerical calculations confirm these expectations that are used in the proof of instability .",
    "we have demonstrated that in two or three layer system with perpendicularly polarized dipolar molecules , no three- or four - body bounds states are stable .",
    "this was shown rigorously through a novel analytical approach that predicts geometrically how much the repulsive interactions in the system must be reduced to stabilize such states .",
    "we also presented numerical results in support of our conclusions and predicting exact critical values for when bound state with more than two molecules are stable in the setup .",
    "fermionic systems are found to be less stable than bosonic for all systems studied .",
    "here we have studied the case of perpendicular polarization , but we note that similar arguments can be applied for moderate tilting angles where the in - plane interaction remains repulsive on average .    while we find that chains are the most stable configurations ( @xmath63 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , our results show that four - body states are much closer to stability than three - body states .",
    "this implies that an increase in the number of layers can lead to bound complexes with more than one molecule per layer ( as for instance shown in configuration @xmath5 of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . disregarding these few - body states , both density wave @xcite and crystalline @xcite phases",
    "have been predicted in the multilayer setup . with a richer spectrum of few - body complexes",
    ", we expect that more complicated , stable many - body configurations are possible when the complexes discussed here are used as building blocks .",
    "detecting the structures experimentally should be possible by several techniques such as rf spectroscopy @xcite , lattice shaking @xcite , or _ in situ _ optical detection @xcite .    as demonstrated here",
    ", one can tune bound state stability by reducing the intra - layer repulsion .",
    "if an electric field gradient is applied that is steep enough to make the interaction in adjacent layer different the effective repulsion could be reduced and stabilize few - body bound states .",
    "alternatively , one can imagine driving microwave transitions among rotational states in the molecules @xcite into states of different effective dipole moment for a given external dc field . through this technique it might be possible to even reverse the direction of the effective dipole moment , yielding a potential that is repulsive at short distance and attractive in the tail .",
    "this will produce entirely new structures and is an exciting direction for future studies .",
