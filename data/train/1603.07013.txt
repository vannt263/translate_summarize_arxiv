    "<S> a sharp transition between liquefaction and transient solidification is observed during impact on a granular suspension depending on the initial packing fraction . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate , via high - speed pressure measurements and a two - phase modeling , that this transition is controlled by a coupling between the granular pile dilatancy and the interstitial fluid pressure generated by the impact . </S>",
    "<S> our results provide a generic mechanism for explaining the wide variety of impact responses in particulate media , from dry quicksand in powders to impact - hardening in shear - thickening suspensions like cornstarch .    </S>",
    "<S> 1.5 cm    impacts on particulate media like granular materials and suspensions present an astonishingly rich phenomenology @xcite . along with its astrophysical @xcite and ballistics applications @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> impact dynamics is an object of active research to understand the high - speed response of granular matter @xcite . in dry granular media , </S>",
    "<S> impact by a solid object results in the formation of a corona of granular ejecta and a solid  like plastic deformation leading to a permanent crater @xcite . for fine powders in air , </S>",
    "<S> granular jets and cavity collapse occur during impact @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> subsequent studies showed that the ambient pressure of the interstitial fluid ( air ) is an important element for the observed fluid  like behavior @xcite , while for denser packing the impact penetration is much reduced @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the question of the physical mechanisms and control parameters that give rise to such a wide variety of phenomena is still largely open . </S>",
    "<S> recently , studies on shear  thickening suspensions ( cornstarch ) showed completely different behaviors . above a critical velocity , </S>",
    "<S> an impacting object immediately stops @xcite , or in some cases generates cracks @xcite , as if hitting a solid . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon has been related to the propagation of dynamic jamming fronts in the bulk @xcite but the mechanism remains unclear and overlooks the role of fluid / grains couplings , which are known to strongly affect the transient behavior of saturated granular materials @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> whether impact - activated solidification relies on such couplings or on the complex rheology of the suspension is a pivotal question for clarifying the physics of shear - thickening fluids    a still highly debated topic @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the objective of this letter is to address these questions and elucidate the role of the interstitial fluid and the initial volume fraction on the diverse impact phenomenology observed in granular materials and dense suspensions during the last decade . to avoid difficulties associated with colloidal interactions between particles ( like in shear - thickening suspensions ) or fluid compressibility ( like in powders in air ) , we study here the impact of a freely - falling rigid sphere on a simple granular suspension @xcite made up of macroscopic , heavy particles ( glass beads in the range 0.11 mm ) immersed in an incompressible liquid ( water , viscous oil ) . </S>",
    "<S> the initial packing fraction of the suspension @xmath0 ( the ratio of the volume of the glass beads to the total volume ) is controlled by first fluidizing the mixture and then compacting the sediment , before removing the excess liquid ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) and supplemental materials for the detailed set - up ) . </S>",
    "<S> for a granular pile of frictional spherical particles , @xmath0 typically takes values between 0.55 and 0.62 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the suspension is kept fully saturated so that surface tension effects can be neglected .        </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , two very distinct impact regimes are observed depending on the initial packing fraction [ fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) ] . for </S>",
    "<S> initially loose packing ( @xmath1 ) , the ball readily sinks in the suspension , giving rise to a collapsing cavity and a central jet ( see movie 1 in supplemental material ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is the typical behavior of a sphere impacting a liquid pool wherein the dynamics is dominated by fluid inertia @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such fluid - like behavior is also strikingly similar to that observed when a rigid sphere hits a dry loose powder under atmospheric pressure @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , for dense packing ( @xmath2 ) , the ball stops abruptly within a few milliseconds as it hits the surface ( see movie 2 in supplemental material ) , with a huge deceleration of about @xmath3 @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 m s@xmath6 ) [ fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(c ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> this solid - like behavior is strongly reminiscent of the impact  activated solidification observed in shear - thickening suspension like cornstarch @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it also clearly depends on the grain size and viscosity of the interstitial fluid between the particles . using coarser particles in the same fluid tends to suppress the extreme deceleration , which can be restored by increasing the fluid viscosity ( see movie 3 in supplemental material ) </S>",
    "<S> the impact dynamics is also very different when the same grains are put in air instead of water . in this case , as reported in previous studies @xcite , grains ejecta followed by the formation of a permanent crater is observed ( see movie 4 in supplemental material ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore both the initial packing fraction and the interstitial fluid play a key role on the suspension behavior during impact .    to explain how such a drastic change in behavior can occur with only a slight change of packing fraction ( @xmath7 ) , we rely on a pore - pressure feedback mechanism : a coupling between the deformation of the granular medium and the pressure of the interstitial fluid between the grains @xcite . as first described by o. reynolds @xcite , when a dense granular packing starts to flow </S>",
    "<S> , it must dilate . </S>",
    "<S> since the medium is saturated with an incompressible liquid , the fluid is sucked in , as evidenced by the bright zone developing beneath the impacting sphere in the dense case [ fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) ] . therefore , </S>",
    "<S> when the ball hits the pile , the interstitial fluid pressure ( pore  pressure ) drops instantaneously , which in turn presses the grains against each other thereby enhancing the friction . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the medium is transiently solidified . </S>",
    "<S> a loosely packed granular bed , on the other hand , tends to compact when it deforms . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , a rise in pore  </S>",
    "<S> pressure is produced during impact that can balance the weight of the grains . </S>",
    "<S> this suppresses the contact network , resulting in local or global fluidization .    </S>",
    "<S> we proceed a direct verification of this mechanism by developing a high - frequency measurement of the interstitial fluid pressure inside the suspension , just under the impact [ fig . </S>",

    "<S> 4 , we compare the predicted pore  pressure @xmath55 with the typical confining pressure due to gravity @xmath106 for our study and previous impact studies covering a wide range of particulate media and impact conditions , for both incompressible and compressible interstitial fluids . when @xmath107 , the pore  </S>",
    "<S> pressure built - up during impact dominates the dynamics , yielding quicksand - like or solid - like response depending on the sign of @xmath51 , in agreement with observations @xcite . by contrast when @xmath108 the interstitial fluid contributes negligibly to forces between grains and so </S>",
    "<S> , one recovers the classical dry granular case phenomenology @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our study thus provides an unifying picture to explain the main regimes observed during the impact of a solid object onto a mixture of grains and fluid , at least when surface tension effects can be neglected ( saturated suspension ) . </S>",
    "<S> it also provides a mechanism to explain the impact  activated solidification observed in more complex shear  thickening media like cornstarch @xcite . in these systems , the critical packing fraction @xmath94 is expected to be a decreasing function of the impact velocity @xcite , and not a material constant like in the present study . </S>",
    "<S> thus , at high enough impact velocities , the suspension should become dilatant and solidify due to the pore  pressure feedback mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> since the cornstarch particles are about 10 @xmath76 m and the suspension permeability scale as @xmath42 , the darcy - reynolds scaling ( [ eq : darcyreynoldsscaling ] ) predicts a 100-fold increases of the pore  </S>",
    "<S> pressure compared to that of the newtonian suspension with glass beads ( @xmath109 @xmath76 m ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is about @xmath110 mpa for typical impact conditions , which is in good agreement with impact stress estimations in cornstarch @xcite [ fig . </S>",

    "<S> we confirm this viewpoint by performing qualitative measurements of pore  pressure in cornstarch suspensions . when an object is impulsively - moved in a concentrated suspension of cornstarch in water , </S>",
    "<S> pore  </S>",
    "<S> pressure takes indeed a huge drop ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> s3 in supplemental material ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is remarkable that the conjunction of two distinguished mechanisms in granular media , the darcy law and the reynolds dilatancy , could explain this long - standing puzzle : why we can run on cornstarch .    1    j. c. ruiz - surez , rep . </S>",
