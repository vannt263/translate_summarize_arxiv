    "the potential of deep near - infrared observations to measure the cosmological evolution of the stellar mass of galaxies has long been understood ( e.g. lilly & longair 1984 ; dunlop et al . 1989 ; glazebrook et al .",
    "1995 ; cowie et al .",
    "1996 ) . now , with the advent of wide - field near - infrared detectors ,",
    "this potential has begun to be realized , and several deep infrared - based studies supported by spectroscopic and/or photometric redshift information have recently been completed ( e.g. cimatti et al . 2002 ; pozzetti et al . 2003 ; dickinson et al .",
    "2003 ; drory et al . 2003",
    "; fontana et al .",
    "2004 ; glazebrook et al . 2004",
    "; caputi et al . 2006 ; drory et al . 2005 ) .",
    "a key aim of this work is the determination of the cosmological evolution of the @xmath2-band galaxy luminosity function ( lf ) , the present - day form of which is now reasonably well established ( cole et al .",
    "2001 ; kochanek et al .",
    "the most recent studies have been deep enough , and have been armed with sufficient redshift information to attempt to trace this evolution out to @xmath15 .",
    "the results indicate a substantial brightening in characteristic magnitude from @xmath16 up to @xmath15 along with a simultaneous decrease in galaxy number density ( see e.g. caputi et al .",
    "2006 ; saracco et al .",
    "a similar combination of luminosity and density evolution has also been observed in the optical lf ( e.g. lilly et al 1995 ; poli et al .",
    "2003 ; gabasch et al . 2004 ; giallongo et al .",
    "2005 ) .    however , even these most recent deep near - infrared surveys have still only covered relatively small areas of sky ( from a few @xmath17 in the hubble ultra deep field to several hundred @xmath17 in the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ) ) and are hence existing results on the evolving lf are still potentially heavily affected by cosmic variance . in this paper",
    "we exploit the order - of - magnitude improvement in areal coverage ( 0.6 sq .",
    "deg . ) provided by the the ukirt infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss ; lawrence et al .",
    "2006 ) ultra deep survey ( uds ) to constrain the evolution of the near - infrared lf and the colour bimodality up to @xmath18 .",
    "the rest of this paper is structured as follows . in section 2",
    "we summarize the main properties of the datasets used in this work .",
    "then , in section 3 we describe in detail how our new @xmath2-band galaxy sample has been constructed and cleaned , and describe the method we have developed for the estimation of redshifts from the available multi - band photometry . in section 4",
    "we assess and discuss the reliability of our photometric redshift estimates and in section 5 we derive the near - infrared lf .",
    "the evolution of the colour bimodality is presented in section 6 while in section 7 we derive separate lfs for the populations of red and blue galaxies .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section 8 .    throughout this paper",
    "all magnitudes are given in the ab system ( oke & gunn 1983 ) and we have adopted a background cosmology with @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the data exploited in this paper cover a large range in wavelengths from the optical to the mid - infrared and have been obtained by combining three different surveys .",
    "the optical data were taken with the subaru telescope as part of the subaru / xmm - newton deep survey ( sekiguchi et al .",
    "2005 ) , the near - infrared data form part of the early - data release ( dye et al . 2006 ) of the ukirt infrared deep sky survey ( lawrence et al .",
    "2006 ) and mid - infrared data have been obtained with the _ spitzer _ satellite as part of the _ spitzer _ wide - area infrared extragalactic ( swire ) survey ( lonsdale et al . 2003 ; 2004 ) . in this section",
    "the main properties of these three surveys are briefly outlined .",
    "the subaru / xmm - newton deep survey ( sxds ) is a multi - wavelength survey covering an area of @xmath22 square degrees .",
    "this area , centred on ra=02:18:00 and dec=@xmath2305:00:00 ( j2000 ) , benefits from deep optical imaging undertaken with suprime - cam ( miyazaki et al .",
    "2002 ) on subaru .",
    "the 5 over - lapping suprime - cam pointings provide broad band photometry in the @xmath24 filters to typical @xmath25 depths of @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( within a @xmath31-arcsec diameter aperture ) .",
    "the x - ray observations of this field were obtained with the xmm - newton satellite and comprise 400 ksec exposures in 7 contiguous fields to a depth of @xmath32 .",
    "the field also has deep 1.4 ghz radio observations from the vla ( simpson et al .",
    "2006a ) and @xmath33 sub - mm observations from scuba as part of the shades survey ( mortier et al .",
    "2005 ; coppin et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the central region of the sxds is being observed at near - infrared wavelengths with the wide - field camera ( wfcam - casali et al .",
    "2006 , in preparation ) on ukirt , as part of the ukidss ultra deep survey ( uds ) .",
    "the uds is the deepest of the five surveys that constitute the ukirt infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss - lawrence et al . 2006 ) and ultimately aims to cover 0.8 square degrees to a depth @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 over a seven year period .",
    "ab magnitudes in the uds have been obtained by using calibrations from hewett et al .",
    "for the present study the first twelve hours of @xmath37 imaging , which constitute the early data release ( edr  dye et al .",
    "2006 ) of the uds , have been used .",
    "these data reach @xmath25 limits of @xmath38 and @xmath39 within a @xmath31-arcsec diameter aperture .",
    "the details of the stacking and catalogue extraction are fully described in foucaud et al .",
    "( 2007 ) .",
    "the _ spitzer _ wide - area infrared extragalactic survey ( swire  lonsdale et al .",
    "2003 ; 2004 ) is a large _ spitzer _ legacy program which covers seven high - latitude fields with a total area of @xmath40 sq .",
    "deg . in this paper",
    "we exploit the _ spitzer _ observations covering @xmath41 sq . deg . in the xmm - lss field which cover the sxds field .",
    "the source catalogue based on the data release 2 ( surace et al . 2005 ) includes sources with detections at irac @xmath42 and @xmath43 wavelengths to a depth of @xmath44 @xmath45 in both bands ( @xmath46 in ab magnitudes ) .",
    "exploiting the multi - wavelength coverage and the large area provided by the combination of the surveys described in the previous section , we aim to derive a complete sample of @xmath2-band selected galaxies , with photometrically estimated redshifts . only sources with @xmath1 have been included in the sample , which is the @xmath25 magnitude limit of the edr data ( see section [ ukidss ] ) .",
    "the completeness at the limiting magnitude has been estimated to be above @xmath47% with a fraction of spurious detections less than 1% ( foucaud et al . 2007 ) . in order to have an homogeneous multi - wavelength coverage for each object we use optical and near - infrared photometry computed in a 2 `` diameter apertures psf corrected to total .",
    "the consistent image quality of optical and near - infrared data ( @xmath48 arcsec ) means that the differential aperture corrections between bands are small ( @xmath49 mag ) .",
    "the spitzer swire photometry is in 2.8 '' diameter apertures psf corrected to total ( see surace et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "due to a small shift of the uds field centre during the first year of observations , the current @xmath37 photometry in the edr is uniform only over an area of @xmath50 square degrees .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain homogeneous coverage over all the optical and near - ir spectral range , we have limited our sample to include only sources in the central @xmath50 square degree area of the uds field .",
    "many of cross - talk in the j and k - band images have been masked in the process of image stacking and removed from the catalogue ( see foucaud et al . 2007 ) .",
    "moreover , given the surface density of optical sources and the 2 \" aperture diameters used to compute the photometry we expect each cross talk to have @xmath51 counterparts in the optical catalogues .",
    "all the sources with only j and k but not optical counterpart have been excluded from the final catalogue .    excluding the saturated and masked regions ( due to bright stars ) our final sample comprises 25,564 sources with @xmath1 .",
    "all of the sources in this sample have optical and near - infrared photometry , and a cross - match with the swire catalogue also provided @xmath42 and @xmath52 fluxes for 14,879 sources ( i.e. more than half of the sample ) .",
    "the photometric redshift for each galaxy in our uds / sxds sample has been computed by fitting the observed photometry ( @xmath53 and @xmath42 and @xmath52 when available ) with both synthetic and empirical galaxy templates .",
    "the fitting procedure is undertaken with a code which is largely based on the public package hyperz ( bolzonella , miralles & pell 2000 ) .",
    "the stellar population synthesis models of bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) were used to produce the synthetic templates , assuming a salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) with a lower and upper mass cutoff of 0.1 and 100 @xmath54 respectively .",
    "we used a variety of star formation histories ; instantaneous burst and exponentially declining star formation with e - folding times @xmath55 , all with a fixed solar metallicity .",
    "the dust reddening has been taken into account by following the obscuration law of calzetti et al .",
    "( 2000 ) within the range @xmath56 .",
    "we also added a prescription for the lyman series absorption due to the hi clouds in the inter galactic medium , according to madau ( 1995 ) .",
    "finally , at each redshift only models with age less than the age of the universe at that redshift have been allowed .    as empirical templates we used the four coleman ,",
    "wu and weedman ( cww ) observed spectra : ellipticals , sbc , scd and irr ( coleman , wu & weedman 1980 ) .",
    "in addition we used three average templates obtained by the k20 survey ( cimatti et al .",
    "2002 ) ; red passive early - type galaxies , intermediate galaxies with emission lines but red continuum indices and blue emission - line galaxies ( mignoli et al . 2005 ) .",
    "an observed starburst sed from kinney et al .",
    "( 1996 ) was also included .",
    "all of the empirical templates were extended into the ultraviolet and infrared wavelengths by using the most appropriate synthetic model from bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) .",
    "finally , a quasar template was also included to allow the photometric redshift code to identify objects with type - i agn features . for this purpose",
    "we used the composite quasar spectra from the first bright quasar survey ( brotherton et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "since our primary goal is to construct a sample of @xmath2-band selected galaxies , it is important to clean our catalogue of stars and agns . to isolate stars we first used the sextractor ( bertin & arnout 1996 ) stellarity parameter as measured in the @xmath57 band in the sxds images",
    "however , due to the @xmath58 fwhm resolution of the available ground - based imaging @xmath59 objects were consistent with being unresolved point sources .",
    "therefore , we combined the stellarity information with the position of the stars in the bzk colour - colour diagram ( daddi et al .",
    "2004 ) . as pointed out by daddi et al .",
    ", stars have colours that are clearly separated from the region occupied by galaxies and can be efficiently isolated with the criterion @xmath60 . by applying this criterion , coupled with the requirement of stellarity parameter @xmath61 , we isolated @xmath62 stars ( see lane et al .",
    "2007 , for a full discussion of the features displayed by the bzk diagram for our new uds / sxds sample ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the vast majority of these sources show an unacceptable value of the @xmath63 when fitted with the galaxy templates .",
    "by using the quasar template in the sed fitting process we also isolated @xmath64 sources for which the photometry is dominated by agn light and therefore better fitted by the agn template .",
    "these objects are characterised by a blue uv - optical continuum which is virtually featureless in the broad - band photometry . therefore , for these sources the photometric redshift technique ( which relies on the identification of continuum features , such as the @xmath65 break in the case of galaxies ) is very hard to apply .",
    "the uncertainties related to the adopted quasar template from the first survey ( brotherton et al .",
    "2001 ) could in principle introduce some bias in the fitting procedure , specially due to the contribution of galaxy light to the composite template ( see e.g. glikman et al . 2006 and maddox & hewett 2006 for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "however , this is not a major issue for the present work since the quasar template has only been used to isolate very blue featureless agn therefore excluded from the final galaxy sample .",
    "the uncertainties related to the quasar template will however only affect @xmath66% of the total galaxy sample .",
    "moreover the surface density of such objects in the uds / sxds field ( @xmath67 ) is in agreement with that obtained in the goods / cdfs .",
    "in fact , caputi et al . ( 2006 ) , identified nearly 60 agn in their @xmath2-selected sample down to @xmath1 over an area of 131 @xmath17 .",
    "finally we excluded from the final sample @xmath68 sources for which the sed fitting procedure provided a bad @xmath63 .",
    "specifically , given the number of data points and degrees of freedom , we reject all fits for which the value of the @xmath63 falls outside the 99.7% confidence interval of the corresponding @xmath63 distribution .",
    "a visual inspection of the sed fits for these sources revealed that their photometry is contaminated , mainly due to an erroneous cross - match between the optical and nir catalogues or source blending .      in summary , the final sample of galaxies in the uds / sxds field ( hereafter the uds - galaxy sample )",
    "consists of @xmath69 sources with @xmath70 , over an area of 0.6 square degrees , excluding stars , agn and sources with contaminated photometry .",
    "all the sources in the final uds - galaxy sample have optical + near - ir photometry and for nearly half of them we also possess @xmath71 and @xmath52 detections .",
    "the sed fitting procedure provides two vital pieces of information for each galaxy : the best fitting galaxy template and a photometric redshift . in this section",
    "we check the reliability of our photometric redshift estimates and compare the redshift distribution of sources in the uds - galaxy sample with that derived by previous studies in different fields .",
    "figure [ zz ] shows the comparison of our photometric redshift estimates with the spectroscopic values for @xmath72 galaxies in the uds field spanning @xmath73 ( yamada et al .",
    "2005 ; akiyama et al . in preparation ; smail et al . in preparation ; simpson et al .",
    "we observe a good agreement between estimated and real redshifts in the vast majority of the cases with only @xmath74% of clear outliers .",
    "the @xmath75 has a mean of @xmath76 with a standard deviation @xmath77 . by excluding the clear outliers ( with @xmath78 ) we obtain a mean of @xmath79 with a @xmath80 reduced to @xmath81",
    "this accuracy is comparable to the best available from other surveys such as goods and cosmos ( caputi et al .",
    "2006 ; grazian et al .",
    "2006 ; mobasher et al .",
    "the residual small focusing of the photo - z technique on the scale of @xmath82 does not affect any of our results since our binning in redshift to compute lf and colour bimodality is at least of 0.25 .",
    "the accuracy of our photometric redshift estimates is preserved also at faint k - band magnitudes .",
    "in fact , @xmath83% of the sources with available spectra have magnitude @xmath84 and the distribution of the @xmath85 for these sources has values for the mean and @xmath80 consistent with the ones derived for brighter sources ( see right panel of figure [ zz ] ) .",
    "the statistics at those faint magnitudes is not large enough to allow us to completely exclude systematics at @xmath86 due to low signal - to - noise in the @xmath2-band and specially in the spitzer irac bands .",
    "however , it is worth noting that for this work we focus at @xmath87 , a range in which our photometric redshifts are more reliable , as shown in figure [ zz ] .",
    "finally , it is also worth noting the good accuracy of our photometric redshift estimates at high redshift , @xmath88 . in particular , in the field there is a faint galaxy which has been detected in the @xmath89band ( @xmath90 ) with wfcam and which has a very high spectroscopically confirmed redshift of @xmath91 ( ouchi et al .",
    "2005 ) . for this galaxy our analysis yields a photometric redshift of @xmath92 , providing additional confidence in the robustness of our redshift estimation procedure out to very high redshifts .",
    "figure [ kz ] shows the @xmath93 relation for the sources in the final uds - galaxy sample .",
    "this plot illustrates the coverage of the @xmath93 plane provided by the sample , and also provides a useful sanity check that not only the overall redshift distribution , but also the photometric redshift values for individual sources are reasonable .",
    "the dashed line represents the empirical @xmath93 relation for radio galaxies as obtained by willott et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , which approximately coincides with the passive evolution of a @xmath94 starburst formed at redshift @xmath95 .",
    "the solid line corresponds to the passive evolution of a @xmath96 starburst with the same formation redshift . to help minimise catastrophic errors in the photometric redshift estimation procedure , we introduced a prior which required that the redshift of the sources should not exceed the @xmath93 relation of a passively evolving @xmath96 ( i.e. the solid line ) .",
    "in fact this prior was only required for 12 galaxies , and it can be seen that the distribution of galaxies on the @xmath93 plane appears reasonable , with no significant excess of galaxies towards the bright limit .",
    "another consistency check on our photometric redshifts is offered by the bzk diagram .",
    "as expected , all the sources with photometric @xmath97 lie in the regions with @xmath98 and @xmath99 discussed by daddi et al .",
    "in fact due to sheer number of sources in the uds edr sample , the bzk diagram displays a number of interesting features of relevance to galaxy evolution , some of which have not been evident in any previous studies .",
    "the bzk diagram , along with a discussion of these features , is discussed in detail by lane et al .",
    "( 2007 ) .",
    "the redshift distribution of our new uds galaxy sample is shown in figure [ zdist ] .",
    "the left - hand panel shows ( as the solid histogram ) the redshift distribution for the subset of sources with @xmath100 ( which corresponds to @xmath101 ) to facilitate comparison with the distribution obtained for the complete sample of 545 spectroscopically - confirmed sources ( down to @xmath102 ) in the k20 survey ( mignoli et al .",
    "the right - hand panel instead shows the redshift distribution of the uds galaxy sample down to @xmath103 this time compared with the equivalent result obtained in the goods chandra deep field south ( cdfs ) by caputi et al .",
    "( 2006 ) down to the same magnitude limit .",
    "nearly half of the sources in the goods / cdfs have spectroscopic redshifts and the remainder have photometric redshifts computed by using 12 broad - band photometry from @xmath104 to @xmath105 ( cirasuolo et al . - in preparation ) .",
    "both the distributions from k20 survey and goods / cdfs have been re - normalised to the same area as the uds - galaxy sample .",
    "we find a very good agreement between the redshift distribution we obtain for sources in the uds galaxy sample and the ones displayed by the smaller samples which , however , do obviously possess a much higher fraction of spectroscopically confirmed redshifts .",
    "it is also evident from figure [ zdist ] that the surface density of galaxies in the present sample is in agreement with those derived from these previous studies .",
    "the consistency of the redshift distributions and of the surface densities at different magnitude limits provides further confidence in the reliability of our sample and our photometric redshift estimates .",
    "in this section we exploit the large area and wide redshift coverage of the uds galaxy sample to derive the evolution of the near - infrared lf from the local universe up to @xmath18 .",
    "the rest - frame @xmath2-band magnitudes for sources in the sample have been computed by using the closest observed band depending on the redshift of the source .",
    "this method in fact minimises the uncertainties related to the @xmath106-corrections , even though in the @xmath2-band these corrections have a small variance compared to the optical wavelengths ( cowie et al 1994 ; poggianti 1997 ) . in our case",
    "the availability of the irac @xmath107 m and @xmath108 m data enables us to directly trace the rest - frame @xmath2-band up to @xmath109 for more than half of the sample .",
    "however , as a test we also compared the absolute @xmath110 magnitude obtained by using irac data with that obtained by directly extrapolating the observed @xmath2-band magnitude .",
    "the distribution of the difference of the magnitudes computed with these two different methods is centred around zero with rms @xmath111 . therefore ,",
    "these two methods provide consistent results and for our dataset we used the @xmath110 estimated by using the irac bands when available .",
    "figure [ lf ] shows the rest - frame @xmath2-band luminosity function ( lf ) in the redshift range @xmath112 computed in six redshift bins by using both the classical @xmath113 method ( schmidt 1968 ) and the maximum likelihood analysis ( marshall et al 1983 ) .",
    "the @xmath113 method does not require any assumption regarding the shape of the lf or parameter dependence but can be biased by strong density inhomogeneity in the field .",
    "the solid dots in figure [ lf ] represent the lf obtained with this method .",
    "only the bins above the luminosity - completeness limit at each redshift bin are shown and the error bars on each point correspond to the poissonian errors .",
    "the solid line in figure [ lf ] shows the lf obtained in each redshift bin with the maximum likelihood method .",
    "this is a parametric method , for which we chose a schechter function to describe the shape of the lf : @xmath114    with @xmath115 .",

    "the best fit values for the parameters @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 in each redshift bin are shown in table [ tab_lf ] .    in the determination of the lf both in the @xmath113 method and maximum likelihood analysis",
    "a correction factor has been applied to take into account the incompleteness effects .",
    "in fact , as described in foucaud et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , the uds edr sample is nearly 100% complete at @xmath100 and the completeness drops to @xmath120% at @xmath121 .    due to the limiting magnitude @xmath1",
    "our ability to trace the faint end of the lf decreases with redshift .",
    "however , up to @xmath122 the likelihood analysis suggests that the value of the faint end slope @xmath117 does not change with redshift and stays consistent with the local value of @xmath123 .",
    "the actual data do not allow us any estimate of the slope for @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , in the likelihood analysis at redshifts larger than @xmath124 we decided to fix the value of the faint end slope to the mean value obtained at lower redshifts ( @xmath125 ) .",

    "we also have enough statistics to be able to properly trace the bright end of the lf over our full redshift range with negligible cosmic variance .",
    "the comparison with the local lf obtained by kochanek et al ( 2001 ) from the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) shown in figure [ lf ] confirms the substantial brightening of the characteristic magnitude @xmath130 with redshift . in agreement with previous studies ( pozzetti et al 2003 ; drory et al . 2003 ; feulner et al .",
    "2003 ; caputi et al .",
    "2006 ; saracco et al .",
    "2006 ) we find @xmath130 to be brighter by @xmath131 magnitude at @xmath132 compared to the local universe .",
    "the lack of data at the faint end of the lf does not allow us to precisely trace the density evolution of the lf .",
    "however , up to @xmath133 where the likelihood estimate of the best fit parameters for the lf is still reliable ( see table [ tab_lf ] ) we observe a decrease in the space density by a factor @xmath134 compared to @xmath135 .",
    "this decrement increases up to a factor @xmath136 if the highest redshift bin is considered .",
    "this is in good agreement with the results obtained by caputi et al .",
    "( 2006 ) in the goods / cdfs as also shown in figure [ lf ] .",
    "however , the much large statistics obtained with the current work allows for substantial improvement in determining the lf , especially at its bright end . a more detailed likelihood analysis of the lf , including the parameterisation of the evolution and the determination of the faint end slope up to the highest redshift bin will be possible with the next data release of the uds which will reach @xmath137 .",
    "following the above analysis of the evolution with redshift of the population of @xmath2-band selected galaxies it is also interesting to investigate the role of the different galaxy populations and how they contribute to the global evolution of the @xmath2-band lf .",
    "for this purpose we analysed the rest - frame @xmath9 colour of sources in the uds - galaxy sample ; according to the well - studied local colour - magnitude relation ( e.g. visvanathan & sandage 1977 ; bower et al .",
    "1992 ; strateva et al .",

    "( 2006 ) dusty starbursts and passively evolving galaxies are virtually indistinguishable in the broad band photometry at wavelengths @xmath142 m .    in the local universe , the population of red galaxies is mostly constituted by morphologically early type objects ( sandage & visvanathan 1978 ; bower et al . 1992 ; terlevich et al . 2001 ) and the mixing between the populations of early and late type objects is relatively low .",
    "recent studies on the sdss survey by strateva et al .",
    "( 2001 ) found only @xmath143% of late type galaxies to have red colours compatible with the red sequence .",
    "this low contamination by the late type galaxies in the red sequence has also been observed at intermediate redshift ( @xmath144 ) both in the field ( kodama et al .",
    "1999 ; bell et al .",

    ".    however , the contamination and the mixing between early and late type galaxies in the colour - magnitude diagram increases with redshift as clearly shown in figure [ ub ] .",
    "recently , franzetti et al . ( 2007 ) exploiting data at @xmath109 from the vimos - vlt deep survey ( vvds ) found that even though the red peak of the colour distribution is mainly populated by early type galaxies and the blue peak by late type ones , there is a strong contamination between the two populations .",
    "in particular , they found that in the population of red galaxies only @xmath40% are early type galaxies , while the remaining @xmath146% are late type objects .",
    "as discussed in the previous section and in eales et al .",
    "( 2007 - in prep . ) , classification by colour into red and blue sources provides an efficient means of identifying the population of early and late type objects at @xmath145 .",
    "however , as also outlined by eales et al . the difficulties in successfully exploiting this colour selection increase with increasing redshift as demonstrated by the progressively disappearance of the colour bimodality at @xmath147 .",
    "therefore , in the following section we will study the evolution with redshift of the populations of red and blue galaxies bearing in mind that this roughly corresponds to the evolution of the early and late type objects only at low and intermediate redshift .",

    "the resulting lfs for the red and blue galaxies are shown in figure [ lf_rb ] .",
    "as for the lf of the total sample of @xmath2-band selected galaxies ( see section [ lfsect ] ) we used both the @xmath113 and maximum likelihood methods .",
    "the best fit parameters for the likelihood are shown in table [ tab_2 ] . due to the limiting magnitude @xmath1 the determination of the best fit parameters in the redshift bin @xmath189 is particularly challenging .",
    "therefore , in the following discussion we consider only the redshift bins in the range @xmath190 and simply comment on the behaviour in the highest z bin .",
    "the limiting magnitude @xmath1 also does not allow us to obtain a precise determination of the faint end of the lf , as already discussed in section [ lfsect ] .",
    "therefore , the maximum likelihood analysis has been performed both leaving @xmath117 as a free parameter as well as fixing this value to the one obtained in the lower redshift bins , where our data better trace the faint - end slope . the mean value for the parameter @xmath117 in the redshift range @xmath191 is -1.35 and -0.1 for the blue and red objects respectively .",
    "therefore , at @xmath192 we fixed the slope of the lf at these values . as is clearly seen in figure [ lf_rb ]",
    ", the population of blue galaxies exhibits a much steeper slope compared to the red galaxies up to @xmath122 in agreement with previous works ( lilly et al .",
    "1995 ; blanton et al . 2001 ; pozzetti et al . 2003 ; giallongo et al . 2005 ; ilbert 2006 ) .",
    "the redshift evolution of the blue and red populations also appears to differ .",
    "even though both the red and blue sources experience a brightening of the characteristic magnitude @xmath130 , the blue objects show a slightly stronger evolution with @xmath193 over the redshift range @xmath194 compared with @xmath195 of the red population . according to the results of the maximum likelihood analysis , both populations show a small density evolution at @xmath145 while at higher redshifts the decrease in number density is stronger for red objects compared with the blue ones .",
    "however , it is worth remembering that the uncertainties in the classification of the two populations based purely on the rest - frame colour cut expressed by equation [ ccut ] can introduce severe bias , specially at higher redshift where the bimodality fades away .",
    "the inter - connection between the luminosity and density evolution coupled with the different faint - end slope of the lfs for the two populations result in the predominance of the blue objects at faint magnitudes ( @xmath196 ) over the whole redshift range explored in this work . on the other hand ,",
    "the bright end of the lf is dominated by red objects ( see figure [ lf_rb ] ) but only up to @xmath109 .",
    "in fact , as shown in figure [ sd ] the space density of bright sources with @xmath197 is nearly constant for red objects in the range @xmath198 , while it increases by a factor @xmath134 for the blue ones over the same redshift interval .",
    "the result is that the population of the brightest objects mostly consists of red sources at low and intermediate redshift , while at @xmath147 there is an inversion in the proportion with a slight predominance of blue galaxies .",
    "it is also worth noticing that the mild density evolution of the red galaxies between @xmath6 and @xmath199 is in good agreement with the recent results by yamada et al .",
    "these authors found that the number density of old bright passive galaxies is decreased by only a small factor ( less than 2 ) compared with the local universe .",
    "this is inconsistent with the results of bell et al .",
    "( 2004a ) which instead suggested a decrease in the population of red galaxies by nearly a factor 10 over the same redshift range .",
    "however , as shown by bundy et al .",
    "( 2006 ) this decrement can be due to a selection effect .",
    "in fact , these authors pointed out how the @xmath200-band limit  the same band used by bell et al . to select their sample  introduces a bias against red galaxies , especially at @xmath147 , and which introduces an artificially large decrease with redshift in the red population .",
    "we have presented new results on the evolving near - infrared galaxy luminosity function , based on the analysis of a large sample of @xmath2-band selected galaxies drawn from the early data release of the ukidss ultra deep survey .",
    "the complete sample includes @xmath0 sources down to @xmath1 over an area of 0.6 square degrees . exploiting the complementary optical and mid - ir data provided by the subaru / xmm - newton deep survey and _ spitzer_-swire survey we have obtained reliable photometric redshift estimates for the sources in the sample .",
    "this allowed us to study the evolution of the @xmath2-band lf in the redshift range @xmath201 . in agreement with previous studies ,",
    "we find that the characteristic luminosity of the near - infrared luminosity function exhibits a substantial brightening of @xmath5 magnitude between the local universe and @xmath4 , while the total density decreases by a factor @xmath8 over the same redshift interval .    we have also used the rest frame @xmath9 colour to separate the sample into red and blue galaxies .",
    "we find the classical bimodal colour distribution to be clearly present at @xmath145 .",
    "however , the strength of the colour bimodality is found to decrease with increasing redshift and virtually disappears by @xmath11 .",
    "the progressively improvement of the uds data will assess how the errors on the photometry affect this result .    by using the colour - magnitude relation to split the sample we have analysed the cosmological evolution of the red and blue galaxy populations .",
    "the blue objects clearly dominate the faint end of the lf over the whole redshift range explored in this work . on the other hand , up to @xmath199 the brightest sources are mainly provided by red objects .",
    "in fact , the space density of red sources with @xmath197 is approximately constant with redshift while the blue galaxies , with the same bright absolute magnitude , exhibit a strong increase in their space density with redshift .",
    "therefore , this different evolutionary behaviour of the two populations determines the preponderance of blue objects in the bright - end of the luminosity function at redshifts @xmath147 .",
    "compared with previous studies , the unique combination of large area and depth of the uds minimises the effect of the cosmic variance and has led to a substantial improvement in the determination of the lf . in particular , the large area coverage has allowed us to accurately trace the evolution of the brightest sources at @xmath202 $ \\sim$}}~}2 $ ] with a high level of statistical significance . as shown in figure [ sd ] , the space density of the total population of bright sources ( @xmath197 ) is roughly constant over the redshift range @xmath203 .",
    "this strongly suggests the vast majority of the present - day bright elliptical galaxies were already in place at @xmath204 .    on the other hand ,",
    "our analysis has also shown a change in the fraction of red and blue galaxies with redshift .",
    "the majority of bright sources at @xmath145 exhibit red colours consistent with having an old stellar population formed at high redshift .",
    "however , the increase of the fraction of blue galaxies with increasing redshift  indicative of an increase of the ongoing star formation  suggests the major formation epoch of the these bright sources to be at @xmath11 .",
    "however , it is worth noting that the colour classification based on the rest - frame ( @xmath138 ) colour is not very accurate for distinguishing between the different populations of galaxies that show the same optical colours , i.e. the old passive evolving sources and the dusty star - forming one .",
    "in fact , studies of the population of extremely red objects ( eros ) at redshifts @xmath205 revealed this population to be composed by both old passive evolving galaxies and dusty star - bursts , roughly in the same proportion ( cimatti et al .",
    "2002 ; smail et al .",
    "2002 ; yan & thompson 2003 ; cimatti et al . 2003 ; gilbank et al . , 2003",
    "; moustakas et al . 2004 ; simpson et al .",
    "2006b ) .",
    "on the other hand , not all the blue objects are experiencing their major event of star formation .",
    "in fact , it only requires less than 10% of the total mass of an early type galaxy to be involved in a recent episode of star formation to completely alter the colour of the objects and show it as a blue galaxy ( zepf 1997 ) .",
    "this is because even a relatively small number of bright young stars dominates the emission at optical wavelengths .",
    "moreover , a recent study from the vvds in the redshift range @xmath206 by ilbert et al ( 2006 ) found that @xmath207% of bulge dominated sources exhibit blue colours , indistinguishable from the late type population ( see also i m et al .",
    "2001 ; menanteau et al .",
    "2004 ; cross et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "it is also interesting to notice that the brightening of the characteristic luminosity ( @xmath208 ) of the whole @xmath2-band selected lf is consistent with the passive evolution of a single stellar population .",
    "figure [ evol ] shows the evolution of @xmath208 derived from our likelihood analysis relative to @xmath208 at z=0 ( kochanek et al .",
    "2001 ) . within the errors , our data agree remarkably well with the evolution of the @xmath2-band absolute magnitude displayed by a single burst model from bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) with formation redshifts in the range @xmath209 .",
    "this result , coupled with the constant space density of bright sources up to @xmath204 , suggests the major assembly epoch of bright sources to be at @xmath18 , even though spread over a large range in redshift .",
    "in fact , as shown from figure [ sd ] , nearly 40% of the bright sources at @xmath204 exhibit red colours . assuming that half of them are dusty starbursts  as suggested by studies of ero populations ( e.g. cimatti et al .",
    "2002 )  we end up inferring that at least 20% of sources are old passively evolving galaxies at these redshift . therefore , this implies that a reasonable fraction of bright sources at @xmath204 was assembled at very high redshift with very efficient star formation .",

    "<S> we present new results on the cosmological evolution of the near - infrared galaxy luminosity function , derived from the analysis of a new sample of @xmath0 @xmath1 galaxies selected over an area of 0.6 square degrees from the early data release of the ukidss ultra deep survey ( uds ) . </S>",
    "<S> our study has exploited the multi - wavelength coverage of the uds field provided by the new ukidss wfcam @xmath2 and @xmath3-band imaging , the subaru / xmm - newton deep survey and the _ spitzer_-swire survey . </S>",
    "<S> the unique combination of large area and depth provided by this new survey minimises the complicating effect of cosmic variance and has allowed us , for the first time , to trace the evolution of the brightest sources out to @xmath4 with good statistical accuracy .    in agreement with previous studies </S>",
    "<S> we find that the characteristic luminosity of the near - infrared luminosity function brightens by @xmath5 magnitude between @xmath6 and @xmath7 , while the total density decreases by a factor @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> using the rest - frame @xmath9 colour to split the sample into red and blue galaxies , we confirm the classic luminosity - dependent colour bimodality at @xmath10 $ \\sim$}}~}1 $ ] . however , the strength of the colour bimodality is found to be a decreasing function of redshift , and seems to disappear by @xmath11 . due to the large size of our sample </S>",
    "<S> we are able to investigate the differing cosmological evolution of the red and blue galaxy populations . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the space density of the brightest red galaxies ( @xmath12 ) stays approximately constant with redshift , and that these sources dominate the bright - end of the luminosity function at redshifts @xmath13 $ \\sim$}}~}1 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the brightening of the characteristic luminosity and mild decrease in space density displayed by the blue galaxy population leads them to dominate the bright - end of the luminosity function at redshifts @xmath14 $ \\sim$}}~}1 $ ] .    </S>",
