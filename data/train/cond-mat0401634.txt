    "in recent years , a lot of experimental evidence has been given for the importance of electron - phonon interaction in strongly correlated systems such as the cuprates@xcite or the manganites.@xcite although considerable theoretical progress has been made in understanding and describing many details of the physics of these compounds , the quantum nature of the phonons has often been neglected in actual calculations.@xcite however , a quantum - mechanical treatment of the lattice degrees of freedom has been shown to give significantly different results in certain parameter regimes.@xcite    due to the complexity of the models for the abovementioned classes of materials , numerical methods have been used extensively .",
    "one very powerful approach is the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) method , which allows for simulations on relatively large lattices and gives quasiexact results ( i.e. , exact apart from statistical errors which can , in principle , be made arbitrarily small ) also at finite temperature .",
    "the latter point represents a major advantage over , e.g. , the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) or variational methods  which are restricted to the calculation of ground - state properties  since fascinating phenomena such as high - temperature superconductivity and colossal magnetoresistance can be investigated .",
    "exact diagonalization ( ed ) can be performed at finite temperatures ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) , but for the case of electron - phonon systems such calculations would be restricted to very small systems and unrealistic parameters .",
    "consequently , all existing work based on ed is for zero temperature only .",
    "additionally , for coupled electron - phonon systems , the infinite - dimensional hilbert space associated with the boson degrees of freedom represents a substantial difficulty for ed and dmrg , in contrast to qmc .",
    "nevertheless , qmc methods are often limited by ( 1 ) the minus - sign problem , which restricts simulations to high temperatures and/or small systems , ( 2 ) the fact that the calculation of dynamical properties , such as the one - electron green function , requires analytic continuation to the real - time axis which is an ill - posed problem , and ( 3 ) by strong autocorrelations and large statistical errors .",
    "in a recent paper,@xcite from here on referred to as i , we have proposed a new qmc approach to the holstein model , which is based on the canonical lang - firsov transformation@xcite and a principal component representation of the phonon degrees of freedom .",
    "the resulting algorithm has been shown to completely avoid the problem of autocorrelations , strongly reduce statistical errors and to allow for very efficient simulations.@xcite the work here and in i is restricted to the case of a single electron which is often called the `` _ holstein polaron problem _ '' . obviously , in connection with materials such as the cuprates or manganites , we are interested in studying the many - electron system .",
    "however , the one - electron case represents an important first step towards an understanding of more general situations .",
    "moreover , due to the coupling to the phonons , even the model with one electron constitutes a complex many - body problem which has received a lot of attention in the past .",
    "an important feature of our approach is the fact that it can be generalized to the more realistic many - electron case encountered in transition metal oxides .    in this paper",
    ", we extend the qmc method proposed in i to square ( cubic ) lattices in two ( three ) dimensions .",
    "although the one - dimensional case considered in i is of great theoretical interest , real strongly correlated materials usually require two or three dimensional models . consequently , before turning to the more challenging many - electron case , it is crucial to examine the influence of dimensionality on our algorithm . to this end , we investigate the dependence of the minus - sign problem , which has been found to appear in simulations of the lang - firsov transformed model , on the dimensionality d of the lattice , as well as on the parameters of the model .",
    "we then use our method to study in detail the well - known small - polaron cross over , which occurs with increasing electron - phonon coupling strength , and its dependence on phonon frequency , temperature , system size and dimensionality .",
    "we remove the trotter error , which results from the discretization of imaginary time , by extrapolating our results to the limit of continuous time , thereby significantly improving the accuracy of the data .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : holstein ] we review the physics of the holstein model with one electron , and in sec .  [ sec : qmc ] we briefly discuss the qmc method introduced in i. results are presented in sec .",

    ". we shall also use the dimensionless phonon frequency @xmath20 , also called the `` _ adiabatic ratio _ '' , and express all energies in units of @xmath14 .",

    "[ sec : sign - problem ] .",
    "since the literature on the holstein polaron problem is vast , we restrict our discussion to work in more than one dimension .",
    "a brief review of the one - dimensional model can be found in i. moreover , we will focus on recent progress in the field , and on numerical methods .",
    "a comprehensive overview of earlier analytical work can be found , e.g. , in the books of alexandrov and mott@xcite and mahan.@xcite the holstein polaron in @xmath23 has been studied using a large variety of numerical techniques .",
    "in contrast to many perturbative approaches,@xcite the latter can also accurately describe the physically most interesting regime of small but finite phonon frequency ( @xmath24 ) , and intermediate electron - phonon coupling ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "much information about the holstein polaron has been obtained using qmc .",
    "de raedt and lagendijk@xcite applied feynman s path - integral technique to the lattice problem of eq .",
    "( [ eq : holstein ] ) . in this approach ,",
    "the phonon degrees of freedom are integrated out analytically , and one is left with a single - particle system with a retarded self - interaction , which can be simulated using the monte carlo method .",
    "the only approximation consists of discretizing the imaginary time using the suzuki - trotter decomposition.@xcite as the phonons have been completely eliminated from the problem , very efficient simulations on large lattices even in higher dimensions are possible .",
    "moreover , the method is not restricted to the holstein hamiltonian  ( [ eq : holstein ] ) . it can be extended to include long - range electron - phonon coupling as well as dispersive phonons.@xcite kornilovitch@xcite later employed the same method to study the whole range of values of the adiabatic ratio @xmath21 , and extrapolated the results to remove the error due to the trotter approximation .",
    "he also pointed out the connection of the algorithm to world - line methods.@xcite extending this work , kornilovitch developed a qmc approach which is formulated in continuous imaginary time , and which is capable of directly measuring the polaron band dispersion @xmath26 and the density of states in one to three dimensions , by sampling world lines with open boundary conditions in imaginary time.@xcite although the method gives very accurate results and can also be applied to more general models with , e.g. , long - range interaction , it is limited to the regime of intermediate and strong electron - phonon coupling as well as @xmath27 by a minus - sign problem.@xcite consequently , it is not as universally applicable as the algorithm of de raedt and lagendijk.@xcite as the above discussion reveals , the qmc methods of refs .",
    "are very well suited to study the one - electron problem .",
    "moreover , de raedt and lagendijk also extended their approach to the bipolaron problem of two electrons with opposite spins.@xcite however , as pointed out by kornilovitch,@xcite these are all world - line methods . consequently , despite the possibility of integrating out the phonon degrees of freedom even in the many - electron case , they face a serious sign problem in more than one dimension , for two or more fermions of the same spin , and can therefore not be used to study many - particle systems . in the context of superconductivity ,",
    "the holstein and the holstein - hubbard model with many electrons have been investigated@xcite using the grand - canonical determinant method of blankenbecler _",
    "et al._@xcite ( see also i ) .",
    "however , as discussed in i , due to strong autocorrelations , these simulations were restricted to rather large phonon frequencies @xmath28 , while , e.g. , the cuprates and the manganites fall into the adiabatic regime @xmath29 .",
    "this is exactly the point where our new approach enters .",
    "as we shall see below , it completely avoids the problem of autocorrelations .",
    "apart from qmc , several other methods have been successfully applied to the holstein polaron .",
    "this includes ed in combination with a truncation of the phonon hilbert space,@xcite finite - cluster strong coupling perturbation theory ( scpt),@xcite cluster perturbation theory ( cpt),@xcite dmrg,@xcite and a variational diagonalization method.@xcite as pointed out before , standard ed is restricted to rather small numbers of lattice sites and/or phonon states , while dmrg@xcite and the variational method of ref .",
    "are applicable over a wider range of values of phonon frequency and electron - phonon coupling , and are much less influenced by finite - size effects .",
    "the same is true for scpt and cpt , which exactly diagonalize small clusters  for which enough phonon states can be included in the calculation  and extrapolate the results to the thermodynamic limit by treating the rest of the system as a perturbation.@xcite nevertheless , as mentioned before , all this work was limited to zero temperature . finally , the holstein polaron has been investigated recently using weak- and strong - coupling perturbation theory,@xcite and a variational wave function which is a superposition of bloch states for the weak- and the strong - coupling regime.@xcite    from all this work , many properties of the holstein polaron are well understood .",
    "similar to one dimension,@xcite there is a cross over from a quasiparticle with slightly increased effective mass to a heavy small polaron as the electron - phonon coupling strength increases . as pointed out by fehske _",
    "et al._@xcite and capone _ et al._,@xcite the two conditions for the existence of a small polaron are @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "we will first discuss the weak - coupling state .",
    "concerning its nature in higher dimensions , there exist two different views . from calculations based on the adiabatic approximation ,",
    "i.e. , taking the limit @xmath32 , one expects a qualitatively different behavior in one dimension compared to @xmath23 , also for @xmath33 .",
    "et al._@xcite distinguish between the adiabatic ( @xmath34 ) and the nonadiabatic ( @xmath35 ) regime .",
    "in the adiabatic case , and for @xmath23 , the electron is expected to remain quasifree with an almost unchanged effective mass and kinetic energy for @xmath36 , corresponding to a quasiparticle with infinite radius .",
    "this contrasts strongly with the one - dimensional case , in which the electron is always self - trapped by the surrounding lattice distortion and forms a polaron with finite radius for any @xmath37 . on the other hand , in the nonadiabatic regime @xmath35 ,",
    "the behavior is very similar in all dimensions , and a very gradual decrease of the kinetic energy ( or increase in effective mass ) is observed as the coupling strength increases . due to the large energy of the phonon excitations",
    ", only the zero - phonon state contributes significantly .",
    "moreover , the phonons are fast and react almost instantly to the motion of the electron .",
    "consequently , a lattice distortion only persists in the immediate vicinity of the electron , and this rather small quasiparticle is sometimes called a `` _ nonadiabatic lang - firsov polaron_''.@xcite romero _ et al._@xcite take on a slightly different viewpoint .",
    "they argue that the large polaron state is essentially the same in any dimension , and that the only effect of increasing the dimension of the system is given by the observed sharpening of the transition to a small polaron in @xmath23 compared to 1d . for @xmath22 larger than a critical value @xmath38 , determined by the aforementioned conditions @xmath30 and @xmath31 , where the cross over occurs , both views agree on the existence of a a small - sized so - called `` _ holstein polaron_''.@xcite",
    "the latter is a heavy quasiparticle with a strongly reduced mobility .",
    "the cross over at @xmath38 is very sharp , especially for @xmath29 , but it does not represent a real phase transition.@xcite even though the electron is trapped in the potential well originating from the response of the lattice to its motion , the ground state is still bloch - like . for simplicity , in the remainder of this paper , we shall always refer to the weak - coupling state as a large polaron , either with finite or infinite radius , depending on which of the abovementioned viewpoints one holds . in our opinion , a definite decision about which of the two alternatives is correct can not be made using qmc , which is restricted to finite clusters and , more importantly , finite temperatures . as a consequence , there will always be a contribution from excited states , making it difficult to reveal the true nature of the ground state in the weak - coupling regime .",
    "since the extension of the qmc algorithm to higher dimensions is straight forward , here we shall merely give an overview of the method which has been discussed in detail in i.      the cornerstone of the new approach is the canonical lang - firsov transformation,@xcite which separates the polaron effects , due to the electron - phonon interaction , from the zero - point fluctuations of the harmonic oscillators in eq .",
    "( [ eq : holstein ] ) .",
    "the transformed model with one electron takes the form@xcite @xmath39 with @xmath2 as defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : holstein ] ) , and the polaron binding energy @xmath40 . the parameter @xmath41 , which corresponds to the displacement of the harmonic oscillator in the presence of an electron,@xcite",
    "is given by @xmath42 .",
    "the method employs a trotter decomposition of the imaginary time axis into @xmath43 intervals of size @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the inverse temperature .",
    "the partition function , obtained by integrating out the phonon coordinates,@xcite is given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 denotes the @xmath48 dimensional integral over all phonon momenta @xmath49 , and @xmath50 is the linear size of the lattice in d dimensions . the bosonic weight @xmath51 is defined as @xmath52 with the bosonic action @xmath53 @xmath54 , and a tridiagonal @xmath55 matrix @xmath56 with nonzero elements @xmath57 and periodic boundary conditions @xmath58 . as",
    "discussed in i , the electronic weight @xmath59 is given by @xmath60 here @xmath61 is @xmath62 with the phonon operators @xmath8 replaced by the values @xmath63 on the @xmath64th trotter slice . the exponential of the hopping term can be written as @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the @xmath67 tight - binding hopping matrix for the lattice under consideration .",
    "in fact , this is the only nontrivial change compared to the one - dimensional case . as pointed out in i , for a single electron , the fermionic trace can easily be calculated from the matrix representation of @xmath68 as @xmath69 . due to the complex - valued hopping term",
    ", @xmath59 is not strictly positive , which gives rise to the minus - sign problem discussed below .",
    "we would like to mention that , in contrast to some determinant qmc methods,@xcite the @xmath43-fold matrix product involved in the calculation of the matrix @xmath68 is well conditioned also for large systems at low temperatures , so that a time - consuming numerical stabilization is not necessary .    in i , we have introduced the so - called principal component representation for the phonon degrees of freedom . in terms of the latter",
    ", the bosonic weight takes the simple gaussian form @xmath70 with the _ principal components _ @xmath71 .",
    "it is strictly positive .",
    "finally , the efficiency of the qmc algorithm can be greatly improved by the use of a reweighting of the probability distribution . in our case , this amounts to transferring all the influence of the electronic degrees of freedom  which are treated exactly  to the observables calculated via @xmath72 with the expectation values with respect to the bosonic weight @xmath51 defined as @xmath73 as outlined in i , the expectation values defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ob ] ) can be determined during the qmc simulation .",
    "the applicability of the reweighting method has been discussed in detail in i , and here we only mention that we have carefully checked that it also works reliably in higher dimensions .",
    "this could be expected , since the physics of the holstein polaron is rather similar in all dimensions ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : holstein ] ) .",
    "details about the calculation of observables within our formalism can be found in i. due to the analytic integration over the phonon coordinates @xmath74 used here , interesting observables such as the correlation functions @xmath75 are difficult to measure accurately .",
    "other quantities such as the quasiparticle weight , and the closely related effective mass,@xcite can be determined from the one - electron green function at long imaginary times,@xcite but results but would not be as accurate as existing work on the one - electron case considered here ( see , e.g. , refs .  , and  ) .",
    "therefore , we have restricted ourselves to the kinetic energy of the electron , which contains a lot of information about the small - polaron cross over . for the more demanding many - electron case , to which our method can be extended ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : summary ] ) , other methods produce far less reliable data .",
    "we are now in a position to discuss the actual qmc procedure which has been explained more thoroughly in i. from the above discussion and i , it is obvious that we only simulate the phonons , while the electronic degrees of freedom have been integrated out analytically .",
    "this is equivalent to the method proposed by blankenbecler _",
    "et al._@xcite for the many - electron case . however , here the monte carlo sampling is independent of the fermionic weight @xmath59 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : wf ] ) , with the latter entering the calculations only via the reweighting procedure [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : reweighting ] ) ] .",
    "thereby , we avoid the problem of nonpositive weights during the qmc updates , since we do not use @xmath59 as a probability for accepting or rejecting new phonon configurations .",
    "nevertheless , the sign problem still manifests itself in terms of statistical errors , as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : reweighting ] ) .",
    "similar to other occurrences of the minus - sign problem , e.g. , for the case of the hubbard model away from half filling,@xcite simulations would become very difficult if @xmath76 should tend to zero .",
    "owing to the gaussian form of the bosonic action , when written in terms of the principal components @xmath77 , the latter can be sampled exactly by drawing random numbers from a normal distribution .",
    "in contrast to usual markov chain monte carlo simulations , every new configuration is accepted , and no autocorrelations between successive values of the @xmath77 exist .",
    "this is in strong contrast to conventional qmc methods for the holstein model , also with many electrons ( see discussion in i ) .",
    "except for situations in which the phonons are integrated out analytically , simulations become extremely difficult at low temperatures and for small phonon frequencies due to strongly increasing autocorrelations .",
    "we regard the complete absence of such correlations as a major advantage of our method . after the @xmath77",
    "have been updated for each site of the @xmath48 space - time lattice , a transformation back to the momenta @xmath49 is performed using the matrix @xmath78 .",
    "then , for each observable of interest , @xmath79 as well as the fermionic weight @xmath59 are calculated for the current phonon configuration , after which the next update can begin . at the end of the program ,",
    "results for observables are obtained according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : reweighting ] ) ( see also i ) .      before we come to a discussion of the sign problem in the approach presented here , we would like to give a quick review of its occurrence in other qmc methods . the situation is best illustrated for the case of the world - line algorithm ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) .",
    "the use of the latter to simulate systems of interacting fermions is restricted to one dimension by the fermi statistics of the electrons .",
    "this is a consequence of the negative matrix elements @xmath80 , which appear when two fermion world lines wind around each other one or more times as they traverse the space - time lattice . with other methods , despite the occurrence of the sign problem , simulations can still be carried out in many situations .",
    "since the qmc sampling requires nonnegative weights , one uses @xmath81 instead of @xmath80 . as a consequence",
    ", the sign of the fermionic weight , @xmath82 , is treated as part of the observables .",
    "the latter then have to be calculated via @xmath83 and it is obvious that simulations will become extremely difficult if the denominator in eq .  ( [ eq : obs_sign ] ) tends to zero .",
    "in fact , if a sign problem is present , the number of measurements during a qmc run has to be increased by a factor @xmath84 to obtain results of the same accuracy.@xcite as discussed in ref .",
    ", using @xmath81 instead of @xmath80 corresponds to simulating an effective model of hard - core bosons .",
    "the average sign can be written as @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 denote the free energy per site of the fermionic and bosonic model , respectively , and @xmath88 is the volume of the system.@xcite from eq .",
    "( [ eq : sign_free_energy ] ) , it is obvious that @xmath89 decreases exponentially with increasing @xmath90 and @xmath88 .",
    "the auxiliary - field method@xcite for the hubbard model faces similar problems . here",
    "the weight of a configuration is given by the product of determinants for @xmath91 and @xmath92 electrons , respectively .",
    "the product is strictly positive only for half filling , whereas simulations for other particle densities become very demanding at low temperatures and/or for large systems .",
    "since at large @xmath93 the determinant is similar to the weight of world lines of hubbard - stratonovitch variables,@xcite this similarity of the dependence of @xmath89 on the parameters of the system is not surprising . finally , there is no sign problem in determinantal grand - canonical simulations of the holstein model at any filling , since the coupling of electrons and phonons is the same for both spin directions.@xcite    the sign problem in the current approach clearly has a fundamentally different origin , since there is only a single electron in the system , so that no winding of world lines around each other can take place . in fact ,",
    "the negative fermionic weights are a result of the complex phase factor in the transformed hopping term [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : htrans ] ) ] .",
    "we will see below that , in contrast to other methods , the sign problem in our approach diminishes , i.e. , @xmath94 , with increasing system size , and a detailed investigation of its dependence on the parameters of the model and the choice of boundary conditions will be given in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .      as discussed in i , the error due to the trotter decomposition is proportional to @xmath95 .",
    "we perform simulations at different values of @xmath96 , typically @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 , and exploit the linear dependence of the results on @xmath95 to extrapolate to @xmath100 .",
    "this is a common procedure in the context of discrete - time qmc methods,@xcite and allows one to remove the trotter error if the values of @xmath96 are sufficiently small .",
    "moreover , a given accuracy can often be reached using larger values of @xmath96 , compared to calculations which do not use the abovementioned extrapolation , thereby saving computer time .",
    "we conclude this section by a comparison of our approach with other qmc methods for the holstein polaron . as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : introduction ] , the methods of de raedt and lagendijk@xcite and kornilovitch@xcite are based on an analytic integration over the phonon degrees of freedom .",
    "this separation of electronic and bosonic degrees of freedom greatly reduces the statistical noise due to phonon fluctuations , which are induced by the electron - phonon interaction .",
    "the fluctuations increase noticeably with decreasing phonon frequency , decreasing temperature and increasing electron - phonon coupling .",
    "although the lang - firsov transformation used here performs a very similar task , namely , to separate polaron effects from the zero - point and thermal fluctuations of the free oscillators ( see i ) , the integral over the bosonic degrees of freedom is calculated with monte carlo , thereby leaving us with a residual influence of the phonons .",
    "in fact , the numerical effort for calculations with our approach is proportional to the @xmath101 , similar to the grand - canonical determinant method for the holstein model.@xcite this could be improved to a computer time @xmath102 by linearizing the exponential of the hopping term to a tridiagonal matrix , which has not been done in the work presented here .",
    "although our algorithm is not as efficient as the methods of refs .  , in which the numerical effort is independent of @xmath50 , proportional to @xmath103 and depends only linearly on d , we will see in the following section that it is well suited for accurate simulations on large clusters in one and two dimensions , and on reasonably large clusters in 3d .",
    "moreover , as we are interested in developing a qmc method that can also be applied to the many - electron system in the adiabatic regime  in order to study , e.g. , quantum phonon effects in the manganites ( see i)such a decrease in performance when compared to the world - line methods@xcite is acceptable , since the latter can not be applied to the many - electron case in more than one dimension .",
    "additionally , the advantage of the analytical integration over the phonons is biggest in the one - electron case , in which they represent the majority of the degrees of freedom in the path - integral representation of the partition function.@xcite this is no longer true at finite band filling , where the contributions of fermions and bosons are comparable .",
    "this section is divided into two parts .",

    "finally , one may be tempted to explain the unusual system - size dependence of the sign problem by ascribing its origin to the periodic boundary conditions in real space .",

    "although we have investigated the influence of all important parameters on the sign problem , a physical interpretation of its origin has not emerged .",

    "( [ eq : action - w - matrix ] ) and  ( [ eq : matrixa ] ) ] . moreover , the dependence of the sign problem on @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath90 and @xmath50 bears striking resemblance to the influence of these parameters on the properties of the holstein polaron .",

    "thus , even for @xmath30 , where a trapped state is energetically favored in the adiabatic regime , the electron remains mobile .",

    "a small polaron is formed if @xmath140 ( see ref .  ) , where @xmath41 is the induced lattice distortion at the site of the electron which follows from the lang - firsov transformation.@xcite this is identical to the condition @xmath31 given above .",
    "the larger lattice energy also gives rise to the more gradual decrease of @xmath124 for intermediate and large values of @xmath21 .",

    "the transition from a mobile large polaron to a small polaron , moving in a very narrow but still coherent band , sharpens considerably with increasing dimension of the system , and while @xmath124 only displays a gradual decrease in 1d  without any signs of an abrupt change at @xmath113we find a sharp and well - defined transition in three dimensions .",
    "we conclude this section by comparing the accuracy of our results with the qmc methods of drl,@xcite and kornilovitch.@xcite as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : qmc ] , their main advantage over our method is the fact that they allow one to obtain data which are essentially free of finite - size effects , in any dimension @xmath1783 , and with modest computational effort .",
    "however , we have seen above that even in three dimensions , where the limitation of our algorithm is most noticeable , results are reasonably converged . while the approach of refs .   and",
    "is limited to @xmath129 , drl s method as well as the current approach can , in principle , be used to study any temperature .",
    "apart from the sign problem discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : sign ] , the only limitation which occurs is the fact that one has to increase the number of trotter slices as @xmath179 , so as to keep the trotter error smaller than the statistical errors . this situation can be greatly improved by extrapolating results to @xmath100 , as has been done in this work , while the continuous - time algorithm of kornilovitch@xcite is free of any such discretization errors .",
    "the accuracy of the results presented here depends on @xmath21 , @xmath106 , @xmath50 and @xmath22 .",
    "away from @xmath25 , error bars are use usually smaller than the line width , corresponding to relative errors of less than 0.5% .",
    "this is comparable to the accuracy of the results given by kornilovitch@xcite and significantly more accurate than the original results by drl.@xcite",
    "extending the work of ref .   to the case of the two- and three dimensional holstein model with one electron , we have shown that our qmc approach allows accurate calculations with modest computational effort for a large range of parameters .",
    "in particular , the minus - sign problem , due to the lang - firsov transformation , has been found to diminish quickly with increasing system size , and not to have a significant effect on simulations .",
    "we have presented a detailed study of the small - polaron cross over and its dependence on the parameters of the system . in particular ,",
    "we have focused on finite - size and finite - temperature effects , which have not been investigated systematically before .    as discussed above ,",
    "our approach is not as fast as other qmc methods for the holstein polaron,@xcite the main limitation being the restriction to smaller but still reasonably large lattices .",
    "this difference in performance is acceptable keeping in mind that it can be extended to the many - electron case ( see below ) , in contrast to the world - line methods of refs .",
    ", which work best for the case of a single electron or two electrons of opposite spin , and face a severe sign problem in more than one dimension , similar to other world - line methods.@xcite finally , despite the sign problem , we can perform accurate simulations for virtually all physically interesting values of @xmath21 and @xmath22 , in contrast to the method of refs .   and  .",
    "motivated by the promising results of this work and ref .  , our next objective will be a generalization to the many - electron case . to this end , it is important to notice the striking similarity of the qmc method presented here with the determinant method first introduced by blankenbecler _",
    "et al._,@xcite which has been successfully used to study superconductivity and charge - density - wave formation in the holstein model.@xcite in fact , the main difference between our one - electron algorithm and the corresponding grand - canonical method is the calculation of the fermionic weight , which in case of the latter is given by the determinant of @xmath180 . here",
    "@xmath181 denotes the unity operator , and @xmath68 is the corresponding generalization of eq .",
    "( [ eq : wf ] ) to many electrons .",
    "consequently , the numerical effort is expected to be similar to the simulations with one electron . however , an important open question concerns the dependence of the sign problem on the number of electrons .",
