    "as with stars at higher masses , the binary properties of low - mass stars and brown dwarfs may provide insight into their formation and dynamical evolution @xcite .",
    "multiplicity at low masses has been characterized primarily through high - resolution imaging in the solar neighborhood @xcite and the nearby young clusters and associations @xcite .",
    "these surveys have found that the binary fractions and the separations of binaries decrease and the mass ratios increase from stars to brown dwarfs @xcite .",
    "although most binary brown dwarfs have small separations ( @xmath14  au ) , a few wide systems have been uncovered @xcite .",
    "the low binding energies of these wide binaries would tend to suggest that dynamical interactions did not play a role in their formation @xcite , although a few ejected brown dwarfs may be captured into wide systems in denser clusters @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the binary properties of low - mass stars and brown dwarfs on age and star - forming environment is not well - constrained by existing data . as a result , it is unclear whether wide low - mass binaries are frequently disrupted by interactions with stars , either in their natal clusters or in the galactic field , and how the initial conditions of star formation influence binarity at low masses .",
    "the taurus and chamaeleon  i star - forming regions are promising sites for providing some of the data needed to investigate these issues .",
    "they are among the nearest star - forming regions ( 140 and 165  pc ) , young enough that dynamical interactions are minimized ( 1 and 23  myr ) , most of their members have relatively low extinction ( @xmath15 ) , and they have been searched thoroughly for substellar members @xcite .",
    "these two regions also offer the opportunity for characterizing the multiplicity produced by low - density star - forming conditions , which can be compared to measurements in richer and denser clusters at the same age as well as older populations in open clusters and the solar neighborhood .",
    "high - resolution imaging has been previously applied to low - mass members of taurus and chamaeleon  i @xcite , which has included 45 primaries with spectral types later than m6 ( @xmath11  @xmath2 ) . to improve upon the statistical accuracy of those multiplicity measurements , we have performed an imaging survey that includes most of the remaining known late - type members of taurus and chamaeleon  i using the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) and keck observatory , resulting in a sample of 73 primaries in these regions later than m6 for which high - resolution data are now available . in this paper , we describe the sample selection and observing strategy in our survey ( section [ sec : obs ] ) and our analysis of the resulting images ( section [ sec : images ] ) .",
    "we then identify the most promising candidate companions in our data and combine our sample with those of previous surveys to measure the binary fraction as a function of spectral type ( section  [ sec : cand ] ) .",
    "we conclude by discussing the implications of our survey for measurements of multiplicity at low masses and for the formation of brown dwarfs ( section  [ sec : disc ] ) .",
    "we have obtained most of the data in our survey with the wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) on board _",
    "hst_. in our proposal for wfpc2 imaging in taurus , we selected all members of this region that had spectral types later than m6 , that had not been previously imaged with _ hst _ @xcite , and that were known as of early 2007 , which corresponded to 32 objects .",
    "however , observations could not be scheduled for three of the targets , 2mass j04325026 + 2422115 , 2mass j04335245 + 2612548 , and 2mass j04380083 + 2558572 .",
    "we replaced these sources with two taurus members that have spectral types of m6 ( 2mass j04350850 + 2311398 , 2mass j04400067 + 2358211 ) and a new member later than m6 that we uncovered after submission of the original proposal ( 2mass j04373705 + 2331080 , * ? ? ?",
    "our wfpc2 images of these 32 targets encompassed four additional members of taurus , fm  tau , v773  tau , cw  tau , and 2mass j04414565 + 2301580 , all of which were saturated .",
    "one of our targets has been previously observed with speckle imaging ( 2mas j04442713 + 2512164 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . that object and 18 other targets",
    "have been observed with ao imaging @xcite .",
    "for the wfpc2 sample in chamaeleon  i , we selected all known members that are later than m6 and that have not been previously observed with _ hst _",
    "@xcite with the exception of 2mass j11195652 - 7504529 and 2mass j11070369 - 7724307 , which were omitted because the former is in the outskirts of the cluster and the latter is highly reddened .",
    "the resulting sample contained 19 objects .",
    "the observations of one target failed ( eso h@xmath16 554 ) and three targets were not observed before the decommissioning of wfpc2 ( 2mass j11085176 - 7632502 , 2mass j11104006 - 7630547 , iso  138 ) .",
    "thus , we were able to obtain wfpc2 images of 15 late - type primaries in chamaeleon  i. ots  32 , c1 - 2 , 2mass j11011926 - 7732383  b , chxr  84 , and hn11 also fell within the field of view of these data .",
    "the latter two stars were saturated .",
    "one of our 15 targets , chsm  17173 , has been observed with ao imaging @xcite .",
    "we present in table  [ tab : st ] the sample of 47 late - type primaries in taurus and chamaeleon  i that we have observed with wfpc2 .",
    "we also include the extra members that appeared within the images and that were not saturated ( ots  32 , c1 - 2 , 2mass j11011926 - 7732383  b ) as well as the new companion to 2mass j04414489 + 2301513 ( hereafter 2 m  j044144 ) that we found in this survey and reported in an earlier study @xcite .",
    "to obtain high - resolution images for two late - type members of chamaeleon  i that have high extinctions and thus were inaccessible with wfpc2 , we used the near - infrared camera and multi - object spectrometer ( nicmos ) on board _",
    "hst_. these objects consisted of 2mass j11070369 - 7724307 ( m7.5 ) and 2mass j11062942 - 7724586 ( m6 ) .",
    "we obtained the wfpc2 images through the f791w and f850lp filters , which are similar to the cousins @xmath17 and sdss @xmath18 filters , respectively .",
    "we selected these filters because they provide the optimum combination of sensitivity to cool companions and spatial resolution and they produce a color - magnitude diagram that is effective in distinguishing young low - mass objects from field stars .",
    "wfpc2 contained four @xmath19 ccds .",
    "the plate scales of the pc and the three wfc arrays were @xmath20  pixel@xmath21 and @xmath22  pixel@xmath21 , respectively . to mitigate the effects of degraded charge - transfer efficiency ( cte ) , we placed each target near the readout amplifier in the pc array . each target",
    "was observed with a two - point dither pattern . at a given dither position",
    ", we obtained two images in each of the two filters .",
    "we selected three combinations of exposure times and gains for three ranges of optical magnitudes in order to avoid saturation of the targets . from the faintest",
    "to brightest targets , we used 1 ) @xmath23  s , @xmath24  s , gain=7 , 2 ) @xmath23  s , @xmath24  s , gain=15 , and 3 ) @xmath25  s , @xmath24  s , gain=15 .",
    "these exposure times apply to each of the four individual images for a given filter . for the third set of exposure times",
    ", we also included a pair of dithered images with exposure times of 40  s in f791w to provide unsaturated data for the center of the point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "we did not specify the position angle of the camera on the sky for these observations .",
    "each object was observed during one orbit , corresponding to a total of 47 orbits .",
    "the nicmos observations were performed with the nic2 camera and the f110w , f160w , and f205w filters .",
    "the camera contained a @xmath26 array that had a plate scale of @xmath27  pixel@xmath21 .",
    "we obtained one image in each filter at each position in a 6-point dither pattern that was centered in the nic2 array .",
    "the exposure times of the individual images were 128 , 128 , and 96 sec in f110w , f160w , and f205w , respectively .",
    "immediately before and after the dither sequence on each target , we collected one image in f205w at a position 30@xmath28 from the target to measure the background .",
    "each of the two nicmos targets was observed during one orbit .",
    "additional late - type members of taurus have been uncovered since the planning of our _ hst _ observations .",
    "we obtained high - resolution images of two of these objects , fu  tau  a and b @xcite , with the near - infrared camera nirc2 ( pi : k. matthews ) in conjunction with the laser guide star ao system at the keck ii 10  m telescope @xcite .",
    "these observations were performed on 2008 december 18 and 2010 december 9 .",
    "the target was bright enough to provide the tip / tilt correction .",
    "the plate scale of nirc2 is 9.952@xmath290.002  mas  pixel@xmath21 and its columns are rotated by @xmath30 relative to the nominal position angle computed from the image headers @xcite .",
    "we collected three @xmath31-band images at each position in a 3-point dither pattern .",
    "the individual images consisted of 10 and 50 coadditions of 0.5  sec exposures during the observations in 2008 and 2010 , respectively .",
    "our analysis of the wfpc2 data in section  [ sec : psffit ] reveals a candidate companion to 2 m  j044144 . in @xcite",
    ", we obtained ao images of this pair to better constrain the nature of the candidate .",
    "the images were taken in @xmath31 and @xmath32 filters with the gemini near - infrared imager ( niri , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the altair ao system at the gemini north telescope .",
    "the plate scale was @xmath33  pixel@xmath21 and the field of view was @xmath34 .",
    "the relative positions of 2 m  j044144 and its candidate companion remained unchanged between the wfpc2 and ao observations , indicating that the candidate shares a similar proper motion as the primary and thus is a taurus member rather than a field star .",
    "the tip - tilt star for the ao observations was 2mass j04414565 + 2301580 ( hereafter 2 m  j044145 ) , which is a member of taurus that may be a wide companion to 2 m  j044144 ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the ao images from @xcite resolved a faint candidate companion at @xmath36 from that star , which could make 2 m  j044144 and 2 m  j044145 a quadruple system . to assess this possibility , we sought constraints on the relative proper motions of the four objects by observing them again with niri+altair .",
    "the data were collected on the night of 2011 february 13 .",
    "the observing strategy was the same as for the first epoch from @xcite except that one dither sequence was performed in each filter instead of two .",
    "we employed the multidrizzle software package @xcite for performing cosmic ray rejection on the wfpc2 images and for combining the dithered frames for a given filter and exposure time .",
    "we adopted a drop size of 0.85 native pixels and resampled plate scales of @xmath37  pixel@xmath21 and @xmath38  pixel@xmath21 for the pc and wfc images , respectively . using the iraf routine _ starfind _ , we identified all point sources in each of the reduced pc and wfc images .",
    "spurious detections were manually removed through visual inspection of the images . to search for sources that are blended with the primaries targeted by our survey , we applied psf subtraction , as described in the next section .",
    "we measured aperture photometry for all unsaturated point sources using the iraf task _ phot _ with an aperture radius of 2 pixels on the native scale , corresponding to @xmath39 and @xmath40 for the pc and wfc images , respectively .",
    "we estimated aperture corrections between these radii and an aperture of @xmath41 for each array and filter using stars that were isolated , bright , and unsaturated .",
    "the average values were 0.22 ( f791w / wfc ) , 0.24 ( f850lp / wfc ) , 0.54 ( f791w / pc ) , and 0.61  mag ( f850lp / pc ) .",
    "the aperture correction from @xmath41 to an infinite aperture is 0.1  mag .",
    "we arrived at the final photometric magnitudes by combining the measurements from _ phot _ with the aperture corrections , cte corrections , and the zero point fluxes from the image headers .",
    "the cte corrections were larger for fainter objects . since all of the primaries were well - detected , their cte corrections were fairly small ( @xmath42  mag ) .",
    "however , because of the advanced age of wfpc2 at the time of our observations , the cte corrections were quite large for the faintest objects ( 0.51  mag ) .",
    "the magnitude at which saturation occurs is brighter in taurus than in chamaeleon i because short exposures were included for some of the former targets .",
    "the photometry for the known members of taurus and chamaeleon  i within the wfpc2 images is provided in table  [ tab : st ] .",
    "the uncertainties in these measurements are @xmath43  mag , which are dominated by the errors in the aperture corrections .    as with the wfpc2 data",
    ", we reduced the nicmos images with multidrizzle .",
    "the resampled plate scale was @xmath44  pixel@xmath21 .",
    "the field of view of each reduced image was small enough ( @xmath34 ) that visual inspection was adequate for identifying sources in these images . in the f110w images , the only detected objects consisted of the two members of chamaeleon  i that were targeted .",
    "for both f160w and f205w , two and four additional sources were detected in the images of 2mass  j11070369 - 7724307 and 2mass j11062942 - 7724586 , respectively .",
    "one of these objects is cha  j11062788@xmath457724543 , which is @xmath46 from 2mass j11062942 - 7724586 and has been identified as a candidate low - mass protostar based on its red mid - infrared ( ir ) colors @xcite .",
    "the other sources have separations of @xmath47 from the primaries .",
    "they are unlikely to be cluster members based on photometry from other telescopes @xcite .",
    "our analysis to check for marginally resolved companions is described in the next section .      to detect sources at small angular separations from the survey primaries in the wpfc2 and nicmos images",
    ", we performed psf subtractions using the imfitfits software , written by brian mcleod and described in @xcite .",
    "for each primary , we fit its psf with the psf of every other primary that was observed in that star - forming region .",
    "we then visually inspected each of the subtracted images and identified the ones with the smallest residuals .",
    "the psfs of other primaries were better choices for psf subtraction than other stars in the image of a given primary because all of the primaries have similar colors and were observed at the same location on the pc array .",
    "synthetic psf fitting ( e.g. , tinytim ) was not attempted since it provides poorer fits than observed stellar psfs @xcite .",
    "we found significant residuals after subtraction of a single psf to 2 m  j044144 , 2mass  j04221332 + 1934392 , and iso  217 .",
    "psf subtraction for 2 m  j044144 revealed a faint companion at a separation of @xmath48 , as described by @xcite .",
    "the other two objects appear to be marginally resolved binaries .",
    "to measure the relative positions and fluxes of the components of each system , we created a grid of subtracted images that used pairs of psfs with a range of separations , position angles , and flux ratios . through visual inspection of the residuals in this grid of subtracted images , we estimated the binary parameters and their uncertainties .",
    "these measurements are presented in table  [ tab : bin ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : close ] shows the images of 2mass  j04221332 + 1934392 and iso  217 produced by subtraction of the best - fit single and double psfs .      the keck nirc2 data for fu  tau  a and b were processed using standard reduction techniques for near - ir images .",
    "for each image , we subtracted a frame from another dither position to remove the sky background , applied a mask for bad pixels , divided by a flat field image , and corrected for optical distortion with a model provided in the pre - ship review documenttesting.pdf ] using iraf and idl routines .",
    "the dithered frames were then registered and combined .",
    "given their separation of @xmath49 , fu  tau  a and b were well - resolved from each other in the nirc2 images .",
    "each component appears unresolved in these data without an obvious additional companion . to check for marginally resolved companions",
    ", we applied the idl package starfinder to fu  tau  a and b @xcite , which has a deblend function designed to detect close pairs given a good empirical psf .",
    "we used each component as the psf for the other object .",
    "in addition , separate single sources were observed close enough in time to fu tau a that we could use them as secondary checks of the results of starfinder .",
    "our starfinder analysis of the 2008 data showed a secondary source at a separation of @xmath502.5 pixels ( or @xmath500@xmath51025 ) and a position angle of @xmath52 from fu  tau  a with a flux ratio of @xmath502 . in the images from 2010 , no source was detected at a comparable separation , which could be due to the difference in image quality on the two nights .",
    "the observing conditions during the night in 2008 were very good , with a strehl ratio estimated from the psf of @xmath53% in the @xmath31 band .",
    "the conditions in 2010 were worse , yielding a strehl ratio of only 5@xmath54 .",
    "additional observations are necessary to determine definitively whether fu  tau  a is a binary as implied by the data from 2008 . we treat it as unresolved for the purposes of this study .",
    "our nirc2 data have provided relative positions for the components of fu  tau that are more accurate than previous measurements from seeing - limited ground - based images .",
    "we measured a separation of @xmath55 and @xmath56 , a position angle of @xmath57 and @xmath58 , and an @xmath31-band flux ratio of @xmath59 and @xmath60 in the 2008 and 2010 images , respectively .",
    "these astrometric measurements are consistent with the previous data from @xcite .",
    "a comparison of the astrometry between 2008 and 2010 indicates that fu  tau  a and b share the same proper motion at a level of @xmath61  mas  yr@xmath21 , which further supports the membership of these objects in the same star - forming population , either as components of a binary system or as unrelated taurus members that are seen in projection near each other @xcite .",
    "our new gemini ao images of 2 m  j044144 and 2 m  j044145 were reduced and analyzed in the same manner as the first epoch from @xcite except that the data were corrected for distortion with an idl script provided by chad trujillo .",
    "the first epoch data were reprocessed with this distortion correction as well .",
    "the resulting measurements of separations and position angles between the components of 2 m  j044144  a / b and 2 m  j044145  a / b are presented in table  [ tab : ao ] .",
    "the relative positions of 2 m  j044144  a and b from wfpc2 are also included @xcite .",
    "any errors that may be present in the distortion correction for the ao images are not accounted for in the uncertainties in table  [ tab : ao ] , but they are only relevant to the measurement of relative astrometry across large distances on the detector array , such as between 2 m  j044144  a and 2 m  j044145  a. in addition , because each of the four objects was observed near the same location on the array between the two epochs , a comparison of the relative astrometry between epochs should not be affected by errors in the distortion correction .    in @xcite , we demonstrated that 2 m  j044144  a / b maintained similar relative positions between the wfpc2 observation and the first epoch of ao data , indicating that the two objects share similar motions , and that the candidate secondary is not a field star .",
    "our second ao epoch further supports this result , as shown in table  [ tab : ao ] .",
    "meanwhile , the relative positions of 2 m  j044145  a / b and the relative positions of 2 m  j044144",
    "a/2 m  j044145  a also were unchanged within the uncertainties between the two ao epochs .",
    "for the first of these two pairs , if one component was motionless while the other had the same proper motion as the nearest group of taurus members ( group v , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , then their separation and position angle would change by @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively , which is inconsistent with our measurements .",
    "thus , 2 m  j044145  b shares the same motion as the primary , and hence is a taurus member .",
    "our astrometry is not sufficiently accurate to distinguish between a binary system and a pair of unrelated taurus members that have a small projected separation , but the latter is very unlikely given the low stellar density in taurus .",
    "j044144  a and 2 m  j044145  a , the separation and position angle would change by @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively , if one was motionless while the other exhibited the proper motion of the nearest taurus group .",
    "this relative motion is not detectable in our data because the position angle error is dominated by the uncertainty in the position angle of the camera .",
    "however , both objects are already known to be members of taurus based on spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "our wfpc2 images have detected point sources within a few arcseconds of several of the primaries in taurus and chamaeleon  i. images of the candidate companions with separations less than @xmath66 are shown in figure  [ fig : wide ] . to assess the companionship of these objects , we can check whether they have the colors and magnitudes expected for members of these star - forming regions . to do this ,",
    "we have constructed in figure  [ fig : iz ] color - magnitude diagrams for all unsaturated point sources in the wfpc2 images of taurus and chamaeleon  i. some of the taurus primaries were saturated in one of the bands and thus are absent from figure  [ fig : iz ] . as noted in section  [",
    "sec : sample ] , unsaturated photometry is available for three additional members of chamaeleon  i beyond the 15 low - mass primaries that were targeted by wfpc2 .",
    "the known members of these regions form sequences that are well - separated from most field stars .",
    "one exception is ots  32 , which appears below the sequence for chamaeleon  i. the subluminous appearance of this star has been observed previously and probably indicates that it is seen in scattered light @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig : iz ] , we have circled the candidate companions that are within @xmath66 of the primaries .",
    "one of these candidate companions , 2 m  j044144  b , appears within the sequence of taurus members and is a likely companion @xcite .",
    "the remaining five candidates fall below the cluster sequences and thus are probably field stars . among objects beyond @xmath66 from the primaries ( uncircled points ) , one appears within the chamaeleon  i sequence , but its other optical and ir colors are inconsistent with a cool object and suggest that it is a field star .",
    "we have also marked in the color - magnitude diagrams the components of the two partially resolved binaries from figure  [ fig : close ] .",
    "both components of 2mass j04221332 + 1934392 appear within the taurus sequence but the fainter component of iso  217 is below the chamaeleon  i sequence .",
    "the anomalously blue color of iso  217  b could indicate that it is background field star or may result from the large uncertainties in its photometry .",
    "we note that all of the candidate companions from @xcite that are in our wfpc2 images appear below the member sequence in figure  [ fig : iz ] , and hence are probably field stars .",
    "the primaries for these candidates consist of 2mass j04152409 + 2910434 , 2mass j04221644 + 2549118 ( cfht-14 ) , 2mass j04302365 + 2359129 ( cfht-16 ) , 2mass j04311907 + 2335047 , and 2mass j04334291 + 2526470 .",
    "we now examine the probability of companionship for the three candidates that have photometry consistent with membership in taurus and chamaeleon  i ( marginally consistent in the case of iso  217  b ) . @xcite considered the companionship of 2 m  j044144  b , which has a separation of @xmath48 from its primary . as explained in that study ,",
    "the probability that a field star with the color and magnitude of a taurus member would appear within @xmath22 of any of the 32 taurus primaries in our survey is @xmath67 ( the astrometry from section  [ sec : gemini ] also indicates that 2 m  j044144  b is a taurus member rather than a field star ) . given that 2mass  j04221332 + 1934392  b has a separation of @xmath38 , the probability that it is a field star is even lower .",
    "although iso  217  b is below the cluster sequence for chamaeleon  i , the probability that it is a field star is not significantly higher than these values in taurus because the surface density of field stars is low in its vicinity of the color - magnitude diagram in figure  [ fig : iz ] .",
    "the unresolved spectroscopy of iso  217  a+b from @xcite provides additional constraints on the nature of the candidate secondary .",
    "if iso  217  b is a field star , it likely would be a reddened early - type star or k giant . since iso  217  b contributes roughly 1/3 of the optical flux of the pair , a field star of this kind probably would have been noticeable in the unresolved spectrum .",
    "for instance , the molecular bands of the primary would appear heavily diluted and veiled by the relatively featureless continuum of a warmer field star . finally , because of the low stellar densities in taurus and chamaeleon  i , the components of these three pairs are unlikely to be unrelated clusters members that have small projected separations @xcite .",
    "therefore , we conclude that 2 m  j044144 and 2mass  j04221332 + 1934392 likely comprise binary systems . for iso  217 ,",
    "we probably have detected either a binary companion or a jet ( see next section ) .      in @xcite , we estimated the physical properties for one of the three companions that we have uncovered with wfpc2 , 2 m  j044144 b. its projected separation of @xmath48 corresponds to 15  au at the distance of taurus and its wfpc2 fluxes imply a mass of 510  @xmath68 based on theoretical evolutionary models .",
    "we now examine the properties of the other two candidates , 2mass  j04221332 + 1934392  b and iso  217  b. their projected separations of @xmath69 and @xmath70 correspond to 7 and 5  au , respectively , at the distances of taurus and chamaeleon  i. as an unresolved pair , iso  217  a+b exhibits strong h@xmath16 emission @xcite , forbidden emission lines @xcite , and mid - ir excess emission @xcite , indicating the presence of active accretion and a circumstellar disk around at least one component . in fact , a jet has been detected from iso  217 @xcite , which has a similar position angle as our candidate companion .",
    "thus , it is possible that we have detected emission from this jet rather than a companion , although our filters should encompass little line emission from a jet , and the brighter lobe of the jet is on the opposite side of the primary from our candidate companion .",
    "we treat iso  217 as a binary for the purposes of this study .",

    "separate fractions are shown for m4m6 ( 0.10.3  @xmath2 ) and @xmath10m6 ( @xmath42  @xmath2 ) so that we can examine the dependence of the binary fractions on spectral type , and hence stellar mass .",

    "we have adopted separation limits of @xmath75 for the pc , advanced camera , and speckle data , @xmath76 for the wfc and nicmos data , @xmath77 for the ao data from the very large telescope , and the fwhm of the keck ao data .",
    "we note that some ao data are capable of detecting binaries with separations that are smaller than the fwhm @xcite .",
    "taurus , chamaeleon  i , and upper sco contain the largest samples of young low - mass stars and brown dwarfs that have been imaged at high resolution , providing the best available statistical constraints on low - mass multiplicity at ages of @xmath78  myr .",
    "we first examine the dependence of the binary fractions in table  [ tab : fraction ] on spectral type of the primary . for each of the three regions ,",
    "the wide binary fraction ( @xmath1010  au ) is significantly lower at @xmath10m6 than at m4m6 .",

    "* references therein ) . given the youth and low density of the regions in question , particularly taurus , this dependence on spectral type is very likely primordial rather than due to dynamical interactions among members of each region .",
    "we also can examine the data in table  [ tab : fraction ] for differences among taurus , chamaeleon  i , and upper sco . for each range of spectral types",
    ", the binary fractions do not show any statistically significant differences between the regions .",
    "comparing these binary fractions to data for field stars and brown dwarfs is more problematic because it is difficult to ensure that young and old samples encompass the same ranges of primary masses , and because a given young cluster may not represent the predominant star - forming environment for the field .",
    "nevertheless , it is useful to compare the frequency of the widest brown dwarf binaries .",
    "taurus and chamaeleon  i each contain one known binary brown dwarf with a separation greater than 100  au @xcite .",
    "although the upper sco sample that we have defined for table  [ tab : fraction ] does not have any pairs wider than 100  au , a few examples have been found among other brown dwarfs in the association @xcite .",
    "thus , the data for taurus , chamaeleon , and upper sco indicate a binary fraction of a few percent for these wide binary brown dwarfs . in comparison",
    ", only one pair of this kind has been found among the several hundred known late - l and t dwarfs in the field @xcite .",
    "this implies that dynamical interactions with cluster members or field stars at @xmath1010  myr disrupt the widest binary brown dwarfs , or that most field brown dwarfs are born under conditions different from those in taurus , chamaeleon  i , and upper sco , perhaps in denser clusters where very wide binaries are disrupted or prevented from forming .",
