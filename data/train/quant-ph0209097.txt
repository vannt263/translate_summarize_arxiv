    "the existence of an attractive force between two uncharged , perfectly conducting parallel plates was predicted by casimir more than fifty years ago@xcite .",
    "such force has recently been measured at the 15% precision level using cantilevers @xcite .",
    "a similar force between a conducting plane and a sphere has also been measured with progressively higher precision in the last years using torsion balances @xcite , atomic force microscopes @xcite , and capacitance bridges @xcite .",
    "as described in ref.@xcite , casimir forces may be relevant in nanotechnology .",
    "the increasing experimental precision revives the interest in the theoretical calculation of casimir forces and energies for different geometries ( see ref.@xcite for a recent review of experimental and theoretical developments ) . only for a few geometries",
    "the exact results are known : parallel plates @xcite , self - energy for spheres @xcite and cylinders @xcite . for the force between a plane and a sphere the exact result",
    "is not known , and only an estimation valid when both are close enough is available .",
    "this estimation is based on the so called proximity theorem @xcite .",
    "similar estimations have been recently obtained for the force between two spheres @xcite .",
    "the problems of two concentric spheres @xcite and two concentric cylinders @xcite have also been considered recently . for both cases expressions for the casimir energy have been obtained using the abel - plana formalism .",
    "however a detailed numerical calculation and analysis of the results is still missing .",
    "in this paper we compute the casimir energy for two perfectly conducting and concentric cylinders , using approximate semiclassical methods , and compare the results with those of an exact calculation based on a mode - by - mode summation method .",
    "we will show that the semiclassical approximation describes accurately the interaction energy between the cylinders far beyond the range of validity of the proximity theorem .",
    "let us consider a system of conducting shells @xmath0 , and denote by @xmath1 a suitable set of parameters describing the geometry of the system . for convenience",
    "the system is enclosed into a large box , whose boundary @xmath2 will eventually be removed to infinity . the casimir energy can be formally defined as @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 denotes the zero point energy of the electromagnetic field for the geometry under consideration , and @xmath5 is the one corresponding to the reference vacuum . for semiclassical calculations",
    "it will be enough to take the interior of @xmath2 without additional conductors as the reference vacuum @xcite .",
    "however , for the exact calculation we will use eq.([def ] ) with @xmath6 describing a system in which the shells are very far away .    in terms of the modes of the electromagnetic field , the casimir energy can be written as @xmath7 where @xmath8 are the eigenfrequencies of the electromagnetic field satisfying perfect conductor boundary conditions on @xmath0 , and @xmath9 are those corresponding to the reference vacuum .",
    "the subindex @xmath10 denotes the set of quantum numbers associated to each eigenfrequency .    for some symmetric systems",
    "the casimir energy can be computed from the sum over modes , eq.([ecasmodes ] ) .",
    "the mode - by - mode summation technique introduced in ref.@xcite is based on the use of cauchy s theorem to convert the sum over eigenfrequencies into a contour integral , and it turns out to be a very efficient method of calculation in this context .",
    "alternatively , the casimir energy can be computed from the knowledge of the density of electromagnetic modes @xmath11 inside @xmath2 .",
    "of course this is as difficult as computing the sum over modes .",
    "however , semiclassical estimates for @xmath11 allow for semiclassical approximations for the casimir energy @xcite .",
    "the casimir energy can be written as @xmath12 where @xmath13 describes the change in the density of electromagnetic modes inside the box @xmath2 when the conducting shells @xmath0 are introduced . the spectral density in each region @xmath14 or @xmath15 ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) , @xmath16 , is given in terms of a sum on the respective eigenfrequencies @xmath17 .",
    "given the casimir energy , one can compute the forces acting on the shells @xmath0 by taking appropriate derivatives with respect to their positions . for the particular case we will consider in this paper , namely two infinite concentric cylinders of radii @xmath18 and @xmath19 with @xmath20 , it is easy to see using symmetry considerations that the net force on each shell vanishes .",
    "however , the pressure is different from zero .",
    "for example , the pressure on the inner shell is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the casimir energy for a length @xmath23 .",
    "in ref.@xcite , the casimir energy for certain systems has been evaluated semiclassically using the fact that in the limit @xmath24 , @xmath25 can be computed as a sum over periodic orbits of a free particle bouncing off the surfaces @xmath0 .",
    "this approximation has been applied to ( chaotic ) non - symmetric configurations and the contribution of only one isolated periodic trajectory has been considered .",
    "this is the case for the force between a plane and a sphere , or for the force between non - concentric spheres .",
    "here we will extend the formalism to symmetric configurations ( integrable cavities ) in which a whole family of non isolated periodic trajectories contribute significantly in the semiclassical limit .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ s1 ] , for those readers",
    "not acquainted with semiclassical methods , we present an overview of periodic orbit theory and semiclassical approximations .",
    "section [ s2 ] is devoted to the semiclassical calculation of casimir interaction between two coaxial cylindrical conductors . in section [ sex ]",
    "we compute the exact casimir energy for the same system , using the mode by mode summation technique . in section [ snum ]",
    "we present a detailed comparison between the exact , the semiclassical , and the proximity theorem results .",
    "section [ scon ] contains the main conclusions of our work .",
    "periodic orbit theory relates oscillations in the quantum level density of a given hamiltonian to the periodic orbits in the corresponding classical system .",
    "it has its origin in the well known decomposition of the spectral density as @xmath26 that has a rigorous meaning only in the semiclassical @xmath27 regime for which the scales of variation of @xmath28 and @xmath29 decouple .    to leading order in @xmath30",
    "the smooth term @xmath28 is the thomas - fermi contribution that takes into account the volume of accessible classical phase space at energy @xmath31 . for non relativistic particles confined in cavities with reflecting walls , corrections to @xmath28 of higher order in @xmath30",
    "were first given by weyl @xcite .",
    "later balian and bloch @xcite derived the generalized weyl formula for cavities with arbitrary smooth convex boundaries and for general classes of boundary conditions .",
    "we refer the reader to the book of baltes and hilf @xcite for many details and examples on the weyl s expansion .",
    "the deviations from the smooth behavior are given by the oscillating contribution @xmath29 , which might be written as a sum over classical periodic orbits .",
    "the foundations of periodic orbit theory ( pot ) are closely related to the semiclassical quantization of integrable systems introduced by bohr and sommerfeld . using a multiple reflection expansion for the time independent green function and employing the principle of stationary phase , balian and bloch @xcite derived in 1972 a trace formula for cavities with ideal reflecting walls giving explicit results for spherical cavities .",
    "later berry and tabor @xcite obtained exactly the same formula for integrable cavities using the torus quantization rule and the poisson summation formula to express the spectral density @xmath11 as a multiple integral and evaluating the integrals by the saddle point method .",
    "the bohr - sommerfeld quantization rule fails for quantum hamiltonian systems whose classical counterpart displays chaotic motion . in 1971",
    "guztwiller presented his famous trace formula ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) obtained from feynman s path integrals and based on the semiclassical expansion for the single particle propagator .",
    "the trace formula obtained by gutzwiller is only applicable if all the involved periodic orbits are isolated in phase space , being for this reason particularly successful in its applications to chaotic systems .",
    "nevertheless it fails for systems which have degenerate families of non - isolated periodic orbits , such as integrable systems .",
    "pot has been extensively used during the last twenty years to obtain semiclassical estimates for energy spectra of quantum ( many - body ) systems like atoms and nuclei , with vast applications in nuclear and atomic physics . more recently in condensed matter physics , several transport properties of mesoscopic systems like metal clusters , metallic grains , quantum dots and microstructures",
    "have been studied employing the semiclassical tools @xcite .    in recent works",
    "the semiclassical gutzwiller trace formula was exploited to evaluate the leading order casimir energy for some `` chaotic '' configurations of pair of conductors , like two conducting spheres separated a small distance apart or an open shell and a sphere @xcite .",
    "although the authors of these works comment on the impossibility to employ gutzwiller method to evaluate the casimir energy when non - isolated periodic orbits are present , they did not discuss the possible use of the balian - bloch ( bb ) or berry - tabor ( bt ) trace formulae . as we will show below , they can be properly adapted to evaluate the casimir effect for integrable configurations of conductors ( _ i.e. _ spherical shells , cylinders , parallel plates , etc . )",
    "our approach will be to employ a modified version of the bt trace formula @xcite , that provides the appropriate path to evaluate semiclassically the casimir effect for the case of two coaxial cylindrical conductors .",
    "we should also mention that balian and duplantier@xcite obtained the distribution of electromagnetic modes inside a conducting cavity using a multiple scattering expansion for the electromagnetic green functions , that leads to a decomposition of the spectral density in a smooth and an oscillatory term that can be written as a sum over closed polygons . in a subsequent work they tested the convergence of their method evaluating the casimir energy for a perfectly conducting sphere @xcite .",
    "@xmath32 will turn to be the main ingredient in the semiclassical evaluation of the casimir energy eq .",
    "( [ ec ] ) and can be written , to leading order in @xmath30 , as a sum @xcite @xmath33 running over periodic orbits labeled by @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the classical action of the periodic orbit @xmath34 whose period is @xmath36 . for photons of energy @xmath31 ,",
    "the dispersion relation is @xmath37 , being @xmath10 the momentum and @xmath38 the velocity of light .",
    "the classical action along a periodic orbit @xmath34 is then @xmath39 with @xmath40 the length of the periodic orbit .",
    "the phase @xmath41 is the so - called maslov index that counts the number of caustics along the periodic orbit .",
    "one should distinguish between dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions .",
    "for dirichlet boundary conditions , an additional phase @xmath42 should be taken into account in @xmath41 for each bounce of the trajectory on the walls of the cavity .    the exponent @xmath43 and the amplitudes @xmath44 depend on the type of periodic orbit . for integrable systems with @xmath45 degrees of freedom , the periodic orbits are non - isolated and form @xmath46-parameter families , with the resulting exponent @xmath47 . in chaotic systems the orbits are isolated and",
    "their contribution is semiclassicaly smaller with @xmath48 , irrespective of the dimensionality .",
    "we consider two infinite and concentric cylindrical conducting shells @xmath49 and @xmath50 , of radii @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( with @xmath20 ) .",
    "let us call @xmath51 the spectral density for photons confined in the region between @xmath49 and @xmath50 and @xmath52 the corresponding leading order oscillating contribution . to obtain",
    "@xmath52 one can derive _  la _ bt a trace formula for photons inside the conducting shells , starting from the hamiltonian @xmath53 , employing poisson summation formula and using the torus quantization rule @xcite .",
    "however we find it easier to proceed in two steps .",
    "firstly , if one knows the oscillating contribution @xmath54 for non - relativistic particles of mass @xmath55 and energy @xmath56 confined in a given cavity , the oscillating contribution for photons confined in the same cavity is obtained from @xmath54 after replacing @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "this is not restricted to the oscillating contribution , and the same replacement could be done in the complete spectral density @xmath59 .",
    "secondly , for cavities with axial symmetry , and in particular for the geometry under consideration , the periodic orbits ( po ) are contained in planes perpendicular to the @xmath60 axis ( we are considering cylinders of infinite length ) .",
    "therefore if one knows the oscillating contribution to the spectral density in the bidimensional annular region between two disks , @xmath61 , it its straightforward to obtain@xcite that , for a given length @xmath23 , @xmath62 we stress that the above equation is valid for cavities with axial symmetry , but with generic transverse sections .    the oscillating contribution for non - relativistic particles confined in bidimensional annular regions ,",
    "@xmath63 has been previously derived ( see e.g. richter s book in ref.@xcite and appendix a ) . in this configuration",
    "there are two types of po ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) : those which do not touch the inner disk ( type - i ) , and those which do hit it ( type - ii ) .    the type - i orbits are polygons that may be uniquely labeled by two integers @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the number of vertices ( or sides ) and @xmath66 the winding number around the center . for @xmath67 one",
    "has ordinary regular polygons , and for @xmath68 star - like polygons , except if @xmath65 and @xmath66 are coprimes . in this situation",
    "the label @xmath69 describes the @xmath70 repetition of the primitive orbit with @xmath71 vertices and winding number @xmath72 .",
    "type - i orbits must fulfill @xmath73 $ ] , that is the minimum value of @xmath65 depends on @xmath66 and the ratio @xmath74 between the radii of the inner and outer cylinders , respectively .",
    "this is a geometrical restriction due to the fact that @xmath75 .",
    "the lengths @xmath76 of these orbits are @xmath77 type - ii trajectories are labeled by @xmath64 , where now @xmath66 is the number of turns around the inner disk in order to come back to the initial point after @xmath65 bounces on the outer circle of radius @xmath19 .",
    "we have the same restriction @xmath78 as for type - i trajectories and the length is given by @xmath79    following the steps described above , we write @xmath80 as a sum of two terms that take into account the contributions of type - i and type - ii po , respectively . we find ( see appendix a ) @xmath81    the @xmath82 in eq.([roi ] ) corresponds to dirichlet ( neumann ) boundary conditions ( bc ) . on the other hand , there is no additional phase and therefore no difference between dirichlet and neumann bc in the type - ii contribution , eq.([roii ] ) .",
    "the coefficient @xmath83 is given by @xmath84 , except for the self - retracing type - ii orbit , that has @xmath85 and @xmath86 , for which @xmath87 . in eq.([roii ] ) we have defined @xmath88    having obtained the explicit expression for the oscillating contribution to the spectral density in the region between two coaxial cylinders we can use this expression to estimate the semiclassical contribution to the casimir interaction in that region . for this purpose , we need to rewrite eq.([ros ] ) for the present configuration of conductors . the internal region is now formed by the two conducting shells .",
    "we take the outer cylindrical shell @xmath50 as the shell that limits the internal and external regions",
    ". therefore we write ,    @xmath89    where @xmath90 is the density of electromagnetic modes inside the cylindrical shell @xmath91 .",
    "@xmath51 has been already defined and its oscillating contribution computed in eqs.([roi ] ) and ( [ roii ] ) .    in order to employ the semiclassical decomposition of the spectral densities in each region @xmath92 , eq.([rosemi ] ) , we derive the smooth contributions @xmath93 . starting from the weyl expansion for the non - relativistic case @xcite and following again the steps described above , we obtain @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 are the volume and the surface area of each region @xmath92 .",
    "the @xmath97 sign in the surface term corresponds to dirichlet ( neumann ) bc .    therefore replacing eqs.([rosemi ] ) , ( [ roint ] ) and ( [ sm ] ) in eq.([ros ] ) we obtain , _ to leading order in @xmath30 _ ,    @xmath98    where the label @xmath99 is employed to emphasize the explicit use of the semiclassical decomposition , eq.([rosemi ] ) .",
    "the cancellation , to leading order in @xmath30 , of the net smooth contribution @xmath100 is a consequence of the identity @xmath101    for the geometry under study , and when considering the total electromagnetic ( e.m . )",
    "contribution , it is satisfied that @xmath102 to next - to - leading order in @xmath30 .",
    "this is due to the opposite sign of the surface term in eq.([sm ] ) for the dirichlet and neumann bc .    as already mentioned , in order to compute the casimir energy eq.([ec ] )",
    "one has to remove to infinity the boundary @xmath2 that enclose the reference vacuum . in this limit @xmath103 and @xmath104 since no po survive in the limit @xmath105 . taking this into account and in order to compare the semiclassical results with the exact calculations , we define in analogy to eq.([ec ] )    @xmath106",
    "it is a well known result that in the case of cylindrical geometries the casimir energy for the electromagnetic case ( e.m . )",
    "can be computed as the sum of the dirichlet and neumann scalar contributions .",
    "thus , one has    @xmath107    where the subscript @xmath108 stands for dirichlet ( neumann ) bc .",
    "we now turn our attention to @xmath109 , the oscillating contribution for the density of modes inside @xmath49 .",
    "we derive @xmath109 adapting the previous result eq.([roi ] ) .",
    "the po are the same type - i polygons labeled by two integers @xmath64 .",
    "being @xmath18 the radius of @xmath49 , the length of these orbits is now @xmath110 , the shortest one corresponds to the self - retracing diametrical orbit that has @xmath111 . for a cylindrical shell like @xmath91 , it is satisfied that @xmath112 , that is @xmath113 . in other words ,",
    "the cylindrical cavity is the annular one with a vanishing inner radius .",
    "therefore , @xmath114 where again the @xmath82 sign corresponds to @xmath115 .",
    "the prefactor is @xmath116 for the self - retracing orbit and @xmath117 otherwise .",
    "taking into account that @xmath118 we perform the energy integration employing eq.([ro1 ] ) and an exponential cutoff .",
    "it is straightforward to show that @xmath119 and in conclusion @xmath120    thus in the semiclassical approximation , the e.m .",
    "casimir energy for an isolated cylinder vanishes .",
    "this is also the case to lowest order in the multiple scattering expansion @xcite .    to compute @xmath121",
    "we should take into account , in principle , both type - i and type - ii po for each scalar contribution , @xmath122 or @xmath123 .",
    "however , as before , the contributions from type - i po cancel out and only type - ii po contribute to the semiclassical e.m .",
    "casimir interaction .",
    "we compute @xmath124 noting that @xmath125 is the same for dirichlet and neumann bc and therefore @xmath126    replacing @xmath125 from eq.([roii ] ) and performing again the energy integration using an exponential cutoff , we obtain the main result of this section .",
    "namely ,    @xmath127    where we have defined @xmath128 , and @xmath129    it is interesting to rewrite eq.([main ] ) by separating the terms with @xmath130 from those with @xmath131 . the orbits with @xmath132 and @xmath133 are the diametrical orbit and its repetitions , whose lengths are @xmath134 .",
    "therefore we write    @xmath135    in order to obtain @xmath136 , we calculate from eq.([nvw ] ) @xmath137    and using the fact that @xmath138 we finally obtain ,    @xmath139    this expression , which is valid for arbitrary values of @xmath140 , diverges as @xmath141 .",
    "one might wonder whether the sum of the contributions with @xmath142 cancels and/or contributes , in any way , to this divergence . to investigate this problem",
    "it is interesting to note that , in such a limit , it is possible to derive an analytic expression for the sum of these contributions . due to the fact that for @xmath143 , @xmath144 \\sim \\frac { \\pi \\ ; w \\sqrt{\\alpha } } { \\sqrt { 2 \\ ; ( \\alpha - \\ ; 1 )   } }   > > \\ ; w \\ ; , \\ ] ] we can approximate @xmath145 .",
    "thus , from eq.([nvw ] ) @xmath146 since @xmath147 we can convert the sum @xmath148 in eq.([maindiv ] ) into an integral .",
    "performing the integration and summing over @xmath142 we obtain @xmath149 which implies that @xmath150 remains finite as @xmath141 .",
    "thus , in this limit the semiclassical result is divergent and completely dominated by the @xmath85 contribution . as we will see later",
    ", this dominance extends over a rather large range of values of @xmath151 .",
    "having shown that for @xmath143 one has @xmath152 it is interesting to compare eq.([ew0 ] ) with what results from the application of the proximity theorem @xcite .",
    "the casimir energy between two parallel plates of area @xmath153 separated a small distance @xmath154 is @xmath155 for the two coaxial cylinders , when @xmath156 , the proximity approximation for the casimir energy , @xmath157 , is obtained taking @xmath158 and @xmath159 in eq.([paral ] ) .",
    "the result is @xmath160 the proximity theorem does not suggest any particular choice for the area a. this is irrelevant in the limit @xmath143 .",
    "the semiclassical result eq.([ew0 ] ) can be interpreted as a proximity approximation with a given choice for the area : the geometric mean between the areas of both cylinders .",
    "although it has been shown that to compute a proximity force for a  chaotic \" geometry , the geometric mean radius should be taken @xcite , such demonstration does not apply to the present case .",
    "however , the semiclassical approximation provides a justification for it . as we will see in section v",
    ", this choice reproduces the exact pressure with an error less than @xmath161 for @xmath162 , improving the proximity result beyond its expected range of validity .",
    "in this section we will compute the exact casimir energy for the coaxial cylinders using the mode by mode summation method of ref.@xcite .",
    "the zero point energy in eq.([ecasmodes ] ) is ill defined , because both series are divergent . in order to define it",
    "properly we introduce a cutoff function as follows @xmath163 the exact casimir energy @xmath164 is the limit of @xmath165 as @xmath166 . for simplicity",

    "the contribution of the @xmath230 term in eq.([xxx ] ) is negligible for @xmath224 .",
    "the final result is @xmath231 as expected , in this limit we obtain the proximity approximation @xcite for the casimir energy ( see eq.([ed ] ) ) .",
    "in this section we present the numerical results corresponding to the semiclassical and exact calculations described in the previous sections .    before comparing the results",
    ", it is worth to note that , as described in section iii , the semiclassical e.m .",
    "energy for an isolated cylinder vanishes ( eq .",
    "( [ semi1cil ] ) ) , while the exact energy for a cylinder of radius @xmath18 is @xmath232 ( eq.([exfin ] ) ) .",
    "therefore , in principle one could compare the semiclassical casimir energy with the full exact energy given in eq.([exfin ] ) , or with the interaction energy @xmath201 .",
    "this leads to some ambiguities , although the second possibility seems more appropriate because only trajectories bouncing off between both cylinders give a non vanishing contribution to the semiclassical energy .    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we display the exact results ( dashed line ) together with those corresponding to the semiclassical calculation ( full line ) as a function of the ratio of the radii of the two cylinders , @xmath233 . for convenience we have defined the dimensionless energies as @xmath234    as all energies are defined up to a constant , it is more meaningful to compare the exact and semiclassical pressures on a given cylinder .",
    "specifically , we compare the pressure on the inner cylinder due to the presence of the outer cylinder , @xmath235 with @xmath236 we also display in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] the exact and semiclassical results for the dimensionless pressures @xmath237    as expected , the discrepancies between the results increases with @xmath151 .",
    "one should remark that , as already mentioned , the comparison between the exact and semiclassical energies is subjected to some ambiguities that are not present in the case of the pressures .",
    "therefore , assuming a typical experimental precision of the order of 10 % , such discrepancies would be observable only for values @xmath238 if the pressure would be measured ( see fig.[fig4 ] lower panel ) .",
    "thus , it is fair to conclude that , within a typical experimental error , the semiclassical expressions lead to very good results for values of @xmath151 in the rather wide range @xmath239 . it should be stressed that , within that range , the casimir interaction energies and pressures decrease by several orders of magnitude .",
    "the full pressure on the inner cylinder is @xmath240 for @xmath224 the attraction of the outer cylinder dominates and the full pressure is positive . the inner cylinder tends to expand .",
    "however , when @xmath151 is large , the self - pressure ( second term in the above equation ) is bigger and the full pressure becomes negative .",
    "the crossover takes place at @xmath241 .",
    "it is remarkable that the semiclassical approximation is accurate beyond this critical value .    given the good results obtained within the semiclassical approximation it is interesting to consider them in greater detail .",
    "we have seen that in the case of the @xmath85 contribution an explicit analytical expression can be obtained for arbitrary values of @xmath151 .",
    "one might wonder how well the exact results can be described by this expression .",
    "numerical calculation shows that if one would plot such contribution in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] they would be completely indistinguishable from those corresponding to the full semiclassical calculation .",
    "in fact , even for @xmath242 the contributions with @xmath142 represents less than 3% of the total value of the energy or pressure .",
    "thus , it is clear that the semiclassical results are completely dominated by the @xmath85 contribution which , in turn , is dominated by the primitive self - retracing orbit @xmath243 and its first repetitions @xmath244 .",
    "we have also mentioned that the expression corresponding to the @xmath85 contribution , eq .",
    "( [ ew0 ] ) , reduces exactly to that given by the proximity theorem in the limit @xmath141 .",
    "however , as explained at the end of sec.iii , it is not clear how to extrapolate the use of such theorem away from that limit .",
    "the basic problem is that there is an ambiguity on which area should be considered for the differential surfaces .",
    "in fact , one might either take the area given by the radius of the inner cylinder , the one given by the radius of the external cylinder or any combination in between ( e.g. average radius , geometric mean radius , etc ) .",
    "the situation is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] where our semiclassical results ( full line ) are compared with the extrapolation of the proximity theorem using the two extreme alternatives : area given by the inner cylinder ( dashed line ) and that given by the outer cylinder ( dotted line ) .",
    "obviously , any other sensible choice would lie between these two curves .",
    "although for values of @xmath151 very close to one this ambiguity is completely harmless , already at such small values @xmath245 it implies an uncertainty of the order of 10 % .",
    "the present semiclassical calculation removes completely such ambiguity indicating that indeed the geometric mean radius is the right choice .",
    "in this article we have computed the casimir interaction energy for two infinite concentric cylinders exactly and using an approximate semiclassical method . to perform the semiclassical calculation ,",
    "we have extended the method introduced in ref.@xcite , valid for non - symmetric configurations with isolated periodic trajectories , to the case of symmetric configurations in which families of non isolated periodic orbits contribute significantly in the semiclassical limit .",
    "technically , this involves the use of the balian - bloch or berry - tabor trace formulae instead of the gutzwiller formula . as for the exact calculation",
    ", we have used the mode - by - mode summation method of ref.@xcite , but using a cutoff instead of zeta function regularization .    the final result for the semiclassical casimir energy ( eq.([main ] ) ) , is dominated by the self - retracing periodic orbit @xmath246 and its repetitions . moreover",
    ", it can be interpreted as a proximity approximation with an effective area given by the geometric mean of the areas of both cylinders .",
    "while this choice for the area was previously derived for proximity forces in non - symmetric configurations @xcite , the semiclassical calculation provides a justification for the case of an integrable cavity .",
    "we have found that , surprisingly , the semiclassical result describes accurately the casimir pressure beyond the range of validity of the proximity theorem . indeed , while this theorem is expected to be valid when @xmath247 , the semiclassical result reproduces the exact pressure within a 10 % up to @xmath248 .    as a side point , we remark that the semiclassical approximation fails to reproduce the electromagnetic casimir energy for an isolated infinite cylinder .",
    "unlike the case of a rectangular parallelepiped @xcite , the dirichlet and neumann contributions have opposite signs .",
    "taking into account that for cavities with axial symmetry , the electromagnetic casimir energy is the sum of dirichlet and neumann scalar contributions , we obtained a vanishing result for the semiclassical energy ( other approximations also give a null result for the cylinder @xcite ) .",
    "this shows that the semiclassical method may not work for cavities with one of the dimensions much larger than the others , as was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the semiclassical approach described here could be applied to other integrable configurations of conductors , like two concentric spheres .",
    "moreover , it can be extended to incorporate effects that could be relevant experimentally , like small surface deformations or roughness .",
    "we are currently investigating these problems .",
    "this work was supported by universidad de buenos aires , conicet , and agencia nacional de promocin cientfica y tecnolgica , argentina .        as we have mentioned in sec.[s2 ] the oscillating contribution for non - relativistic particles confined in a bidimensional annular region @xmath250 , @xmath63 ,",
    "has been previously derived ( see e.g. richter s book in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "it can been written as a sum of two terms , each one associated respectively to the contributions from type - i and type - ii po s . in sec.[s2 ] we have characterized these po , whose lengths are @xmath251 for type - i po , and @xmath252 for type - ii po ( see the description that precedes eqs .",
    "( [ li ] ) and ( [ lii ] ) ) . taking this into account",
    "we can write @xmath253 with @xmath254 @xcite and      @xmath256 has been defined in eq.([avw ] ) . therefore in order to obtain the oscillating contributions to the density of modes for photons confined in the region @xmath250 we have to replace in eqs .",
    "( [ ronri ] ) and ( [ ronrii ] ) , @xmath257 and @xmath258 .",
    "this is trivial and leads to @xmath259 and @xmath260 with @xmath261 .    to derive the oscillating contribution to the spectral density in the region between the two coaxial cylinders we have to perform the integral eq.([2d3d ] ) , that we write here in a slightly different form ,      to emphasize with the subscript @xmath263 or @xmath264 the contributions from the two types of po s .",
    "@xmath265 is obtained after replacing @xmath266 in @xmath267 and in @xmath260 .",
