    "the most likely cause is the high source count rate interfering with the the on - board electronic event processing ( dr .",
    "michael juda , private communication ) .",
    "although the jet could be eliminated with aggressive filtering , this would also invalidate the standard calibration .",
    "it was therefore decided to simply ignore all events from the `` jet''-side of the source , as shown by the box region in figure  [ fig : image][left ] .",
    "the surface brightness of the x - ray halo must be normalized by the source flux to make absolute measurements of the dust column density .",
    "gx13 + 1 is observed almost constantly since it is a rxte all - sky monitor ( asm ) source with a average rate of 20 - 30 cts / s .",
    "however , as the rxte asm has little spectral sensitivity and the hrc - i has no effective energy resolution , simultaneous rxte pca observations of gx13 + 1 were taken to obtain a useful spectrum of the source .",
    "although the rxte pca itself has only moderate resolution and little sensitivity below 2 kev , gx13 + 1 s spectrum is dominated by 2 - 4 kev photons ( ses02 ) .",

    ", this model is an adequate fit for this work since only the total flux and the approximate spectral shape are needed to calculate the predicted response of the _ chandra_hrc - i .",
    "nonetheless , it is important to note that fluxes measured with the rxte pca are systematically high by 10 - 15% in the 2 - 10 kev range , compared to other x - ray observatories @xcite .        to check the expected count rate",
    ", we folded this spectrum through the hrc effective area file for on - axis cycle 7 data ( hrcid2005-11-30pimmsn0008.fits ) , as shown in figure  [ fig : xtespec][right ] .",

    "the discrepancy is primarily due to the overestimation from the rxte pca calibration , with an additional complication due to spatial variation in the response of the hrc - i that reduces the effective area of the detector corners relative to the center @xcite    the _ chandra_psf , measured as a ratio of the surface brightness to the source flux , is the background for this observation .",
    "the rxte pca , a non - imaging detector , includes both the direct source flux and the scattered halo photons , which must be removed to avoid double - counting .",
    "however , as the goal is to measure the scattered halo fraction itself , this problem is recursive .",
    "i addressed this by assuming a column density of @xmath26@xmath20  and calculating the total scattered fraction for the mrn77 , wd01 , and zda04 bare - gr - b models , weighted by the hrc - i response .",
    "the resulting halo fraction ranged from 13 - 26% .",
    "this predicted halo strength is consistent with the result that 22% of the total source counts are between @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , for purposes of calculating the background psf , the rxte pca flux was reduced by 20% to exclude the halo contribution , with a 7% systematic error .",
    "this reduction is in addition to the 15% reduction described above .",
    "the 7% error is likely not the dominant term in the systematic error , however .",
    "the observation of a very bright source in one corner of the hrc - i detector is at the extreme edge of the available calibration , and so careful consideration of all uncertainties will be required .",
    "another concern regarding this observation was that a significant short - term change in the source flux , on the order of 12 - 24 hours , would also affect the halo in a time - delayed manner @xcite . at smaller angles",
    "the delay could be even longer .",
    "the rxte asm data was checked for a 10 day period before the observation , but no strong or significant variation was seen .",
    "although type i x - ray bursts have been seen from gx13 + 1 which show @xmath28  the normal flux , they only last @xmath29seconds @xcite . in this case , no bursts were seen in either the hrc - i or pca lightcurves , and indeed the halo observation would not be sensitive to such a small variation .",
    "an accurate measurement of the chandra hrc - i point - spread - function ( psf ) between 2 - 100  from the source is crucial to this observation .",
    "an accurate raytrace model ( chart ) , of the chandra hrma has been calibrated for near - source ( @xmath30 ) photons , ses02 showed that at large scattering angles this model significantly underestimates the psf , leading to substantial problems in the analysis .",
    "therefore , ses02 relied upon an acis - i observation of her x-1 as a psf calibrator , but this source is affected by pileup within @xmath31  and therefore can not be used in the 2 - 10  range .    as shown in figure  [ fig : xtespec][right ] , the spectrum of gx13 + 1 peaks at @xmath32kev .",
    "the hrc - i s lack of spectral response means that spectral differences between any calibration source and gx13 + 1 will lead to additional complications . the best possible calibration source would be a bright , hard , and lightly - absorbed x - ray source observed on - axis with the hrc - i",
    "the x - ray binary lmc x-1 matches these requirements reasonably well , and two _ chandra_observations ( obsid 1200 , 1201 ) of the source have been done . however , they were both done early in the mission ( august 1999 ) before the hrma final focus was set and are thus unsuitable . since then",
    ", the brightest hard x - ray source with little absorption and a known ( albeit variable ) flux to be observed with the hrc - i is 3c273 ( obsid 461 on jan 22 , 2000 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : psf_3c273 ] shows 3c273 s surface brightness , divided by its source flux , as observed with the _ chandra_hrc - i ( excluding the well - known jet region ) . the spectrum was taken from a _",

    "the predicted hrc - i count rate ( based on the cxc pimms tool ) for this spectrum is 8.7 cts / s , while the actual source count rate was 26% higher at 11 cts / s . as the source is variable , this",
    "was taken as showing little change and the flux was simply assumed to have increased by 26% during the hrc - i observation . a significant but undetected change in the spectral shape could also cause this change in observed flux and might affect our results .",
    "however , bepposax observations of 3c273 over a period of 10 days showed only small changes in the 2 - 10 kev spectral shape , with @xmath36  values ranging from @xmath37 to @xmath38  while the flux varied by 15% @xcite .",
    "the potential systematic error caused by uncertainty in the true spectrum of 3c273 during its observation with the hrc - i is thus smaller than the error due to unavoidable differences between the spectra of 3c273 and gx13 + 1 .",

    "therefore , the acis - i data were reprocessed ( with ciao 3.3 ) and reanalyzed following the approach described in ses02 except as noted below . both the hrc - i and acis - i results were used in the final analysis .",
    "we note that in reprocessing the acis data , the source flux measurement , done via the ccd transfer `` streak '' , was redone with a better calibration and improved handling of the background subtraction which resulted in an overall @xmath29% decrease in the measured source flux .",
    "the calibration changes include a spatially - varying modification of order @xmath47  in the quantum efficiency uniformity in caldb 2.28 , and an energy - dependent increase of up to 16% in the overall effective area which was added in caldb v3.2.1 .    the data were fit using the ciao fitting engine",

    "@xcite noted that the full mie treatment is necessary for x - rays @xmath48kev , since the rg overestimates the total scattering at low energies .",
    "the hrc - i is sensitive to x - rays between 0.08 - 10 kev , with peak efficiency between 0.7 - 2.0 kev . in all cases the halo model for the hrc - i",
    "was calculated using an average value weighted by the spectrum of gx13 + 1 and efficiency of the hrc - i . however , since gx13 + 1 s spectrum as observed by the hrc - i ( see figure  [ fig : xtespec][right ] ) is dominated by photons with @xmath49kev , the use of the simpler rg treatment is justified .",
    "the initial analysis assumed the dust was smoothly distributed along the line of sight . unlike ses02 , where the predicted psf was subtracted from the data , here the psf was incorporated into the fitting directly to allow for an explicit inclusion of uncertainty in the psf .",
    "fits to the acis - i and hrc - i data included a constant factor that allowed for calibration uncertainty in the overall psf , caused primarily by systematic errors in the source flux .",
    "for both the acis - i and hrc - i data this multiplier was allowed to vary by up to 10% . in many cases",
    "the fit pushed the multiplier to an extremum of the range , showing that systematic uncertainties remain in the data , although it is not clear what component dominates them . in ses02 , systematic errors in the psf manifested as energy - dependent column density fits , since to first order an error in the psf could be adjusted by changing the overall halo scattering . as the total halo intensity is inversely proportional to energy , this effect is often a linear dependence of the best - fit n@xmath50  on energy . to check for this ,",
    "i allowed the value of n@xmath50  to vary independently in the hrc - i and each energy band of the acis - i data .",
    "i used the f - test to determine that in only one case ( zda04 bare - gr - b ) were the best - fit acis - i n@xmath50  values better described by a linear energy - dependent model than by a constant value . even in this case , the f - test significance was only 3.5% , a negligible value given the number of different models tried .",
    "it seems unlikely , therefore , that there is a significant error in the relative power in the dust - scattered ( halo ) and mirror - scattered ( psf ) photons .",

    "the acis - i column densities are @xmath51  larger than the hrc - i values , although the models with the lowest @xmath23  values tend to have the best agreement .",

    "however , the acis - i data could not distinguish between the mrn77 and wd01 models , as the two distributions lead to similar scattering profiles at large angles .",
    "similarly , the data left open the possibility that there might be a substantial population of grains near the source @xcite .",
    "these would create a near - source scattered halo that was obscured by pileup in the acis - i detector .",
    "the primary goal of the hrc - i observation was to remove these uncertainties by measuring the halo near the source .",
    "this would determine which dust model best fit the data , as well as detecting ( or put limits upon ) variation in the dust distribution along the line of sight .",
    "the fit results shown in tables  [ tab : smofits ] and [ tab : clfits ] contain a few surprises . just as in @xcite , the wd01 model had the smallest column density of any of the models when fit with either smoothly distributed dust or after adding a cloud .",
    "however , the overall result was a significantly worse fit than found with either the mrn77 or many of the zda04 models .",
    "as figure  [ fig : smooth ] shows , the smooth wd01 model fits the hrc data well , but underestimates the halo measured by acis between @xmath53 , while the zda04 bare - gr - s model underestimates the halo measured by the hrc between @xmath54 . examining",
    "the other models show that these two cases are representative . adding a single dust cloud to the model results in a solution with a cloud 70 - 90% of the distance to the source if the pure smooth model underestimates the halo around @xmath55 .",
    "conversely , adding a cloud component to smooth dust models that underestimate the halo around @xmath56  tend to put the cloud near the sun .",
    "although uncertainties remain due to calibration issues , the overall quality of the fits shown in table  [ tab : smofits ] and figure  [ fig : smooth ] do not support the proposition that a significant cloud of dust is present near gx13 + 1 . in particular , although it is not identical to the @xcite model , figure  [ fig : xiangwd01 ] shows the result from a model similar to their fit to the zero - order hetg for gx13 + 1 using wd01-type dust .",
    "this approximation to their model puts a cloud with n@xmath57@xmath20  at a position 99.5% of the distance to gx13 + 1 , along with a smooth distribution with n@xmath58@xmath20 . in either their model or my approximation , the cloud near the source dominates the variation in the dust distribution .",
    "figure  [ fig : xiangwd01 ] shows that although the hrc - i data contain an obvious halo , this model is not a good fit and , in fact , removing the cloud improves the fit .",
    "although their model fit can be improved somewhat with a small vertical offset ( corresponding to different relative flux calibrations of @xmath59 ) , the model still predicts 10 - 20% more halo for @xmath60  than is observed .",
