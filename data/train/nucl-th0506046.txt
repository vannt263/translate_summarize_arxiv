    "this approximation works quite well at low energies , but it is not appropriate at higher energies , specially for high z nuclei@xcite,@xcite .",
    "therefore , at higher electron energies a different approach is needed to describe the coulomb distortion effect of the electron . for this purpose , we apply the methods of electron scattering where various approximations have been used to take into account the coulomb distortion effects of the initial and final electron@xcite-@xcite .",
    "one of them is the modified effective momentum approximation(mema ) in which the electron momentum and energy are modified by taking into account the coulomb energy .",
    "we have used this approach in the case of charged current quasielastic neutrino scattering and the energy and momentum of the electron present in the final state is modified in the coulomb field of the final nucleus@xcite,@xcite-@xcite . in the local density approximation ,",
    "the effective energy of the electron in the coulomb field of the final nucleus is given by : @xmath114 where @xmath115    thus , in presence of nuclear medium effects the total cross section @xmath14 , with the inclusion of coulomb distortion effects taken into account by fermi function(mema ) , is written as @xmath116 where @xmath117~~ and \\mbox\\nonumber\\\\ im{u_n^{mema}}&=&im{u_n}[e_{\\nu_e } - e_e - q - v_c(r ) , \\vec{q}]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",

    "for the numerical calculation of the cross section , we have classified the nuclei in three groups according to their nuclear densities used in this calculation and have been presented in tables i - iii .    in table - i , we present the nuclear density parameters for @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 nuclei using a 2-parameter harmonic oscillator(h.o . ) density given by @xmath123    in table - ii , we present the nuclear density parameters for @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 and @xmath145 nuclei using a 2-parameter fermi density ( 2pf ) given by @xmath146 in table - iii , we present the nuclear density parameters for @xmath147 , @xmath148 and @xmath149 nuclei using a three parameter fermi(3pf ) density given by @xmath150 the parameters have been taken from de vries et al.@xcite except for @xmath140 and @xmath141 which have been taken from ref.@xcite .",
    "the q values presented in these tables correspond to the lowest allowed fermi or gamow - teller transitions for the above mentioned nuclei except for the case of @xmath151 and @xmath152 for which the q value corresponding to the ground state to ground state transitions have been taken@xcite,@xcite .",
    "when the reaction @xmath153 takes place in the nucleus , the first consideration is the q value which inhibits the reaction in the nucleus .",
    "this inhibition is quite substantial in the low energy region considered here for the nuclei like @xmath154 , @xmath155 , @xmath156 , @xmath157 and @xmath151 for which the q values are rather large ( q@xmath15813 - 18mev ) .",
    "in addition to this , the effect of pauli blocking which is taken into account through the imaginary part of the lindhard function is to further reduce the cross section .",
    "finally the renormalisation of weak coupling constants which is generated in our model through rpa correlations and is taken into account by calculating the cross section with the modified hadronic tensor @xmath159 also reduces the cross sections . in fig.4 , we have shown the reduction due to these effects separately for some representative nuclei like @xmath154 , @xmath160 , @xmath161 and @xmath162 in various mass ranges .",
    "we see that at low energies the major suppression in the cross section comes due to the consideration of q - values and pauli blocking in the nuclear medium .",
    "the reduction in the cross section @xmath118 due to these effects decreases with the increase of energy .",
    "for example at @xmath163 , this suppression is @xmath158 @xmath164 for @xmath154 and @xmath158 @xmath165 for other nuclei like @xmath160 , @xmath161 and @xmath162 respectively ( compare the solid lines with the dashed line in fig.4 ) .",
    "this suppression reduces to @xmath166 in all these nuclei at @xmath167(not shown in fig.4 ) .",
    "in addition to the pauli blocking , the consideration of rpa correlation in the nuclear medium gives rise to further reduction which increases with the mass number and decreases with the increase in energy ( compare the dashed line with the dotted line in fig.4 ) .",
    "for example at @xmath163 the rpa correlations give a further reduction of @xmath168 for @xmath154 , @xmath169 for @xmath160 and around @xmath170 for @xmath161 and @xmath162 . as the energy increases it becomes smaller and at @xmath167 the reduction is @xmath171 for @xmath154 , @xmath172 for @xmath160 and around @xmath168 for @xmath161 and @xmath162(not shown here ) .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath173 reduction due to the medium polarisation effects calculated through the rpa correlations in our model is similar to using @xmath174 in some shell model calculations@xcite-@xcite .",
    "the effect of coulomb distortion is calculated using fermi function @xmath11 as well as with the modified effective momentum approximation(mema ) .",
    "the results for some representative nuclei like @xmath154 , @xmath160 , @xmath161 and @xmath162 in various mass range are shown in fig.5 .",
    "the general effect of the coulomb distortion of the electron is to increase the cross section which depends upon the incident energy and the charge of the final nucleus .    for a fixed z , this increase in the cross section decreases with the increase in energy",
    "while for a fixed energy the inclusion of coulomb distortion increases with the charge z. for example for @xmath154 this is @xmath175 at @xmath163 which becomes @xmath176 at @xmath167 . for high z nuclei",
    "the coulomb effect is very large and results in manifold increase in the cross sections .",
    "this can be seen by comparing the cross section without coulomb effect shown by dotted lines and the cross sections with coulomb effects using the fermi function @xmath11 shown by dashed lines .",
    "for example in the case of @xmath160 nucleus the increase due to coulomb distortion is @xmath177 at @xmath163 which becomes @xmath178 at @xmath167 .",
    "however , as discussed in section - ii , the use of fermi function to calculate the coulomb distortion effects overestimates the cross sections and is not appropriate at higher electron energies .",
    "therefore , we use the modified effective momentum approximation(mema ) and present the results for @xmath118 in fig.5 with solid lines .",
    "it is seen that for low z nuclei , like @xmath154 .",
    "the results for the cross sections in the two approximations are qualititative similar but the mema gives slightly higher cross sections for @xmath179 .",
    "as the z increases the cross sections with mema is higher than fermi function at lower energies and becomes smaller than the cross sections obtained with the fermi function as the energy becomes large .",
    "this energy dependence of the cross section is explicitly shown for higher z nuclei like @xmath160 , @xmath161 and @xmath162 in fig.5 .",
    "we show the results of the energy dependence of the cross sections for all nuclei listed in tables i - iii , in figs.6 - 9 , where dashed lines show the cross sections without rpa correlations and dotted lines show the cross sections with rpa correlations using fermi function for the coulomb distortion .",
    "the solid lines show the cross section with rpa correlations where the coulomb distortion effects are calculated with mema . in these figures",
    "a comparison of dashed lines and dotted lines shows the effect of rpa correlations while a comparison of dotted lines and solid lines shows the effect of coulomb distortion calculated using fermi function and mema .",
    "we calculate the flux averaged cross section @xmath119 defined as @xmath180 where @xmath181 is given by eqn.1 .",
    "the results for @xmath119 are presented in table - iv , where we show by @xmath182 the flux averaged cross sections with nuclear medium effects without any coulomb distortion effects . when coulomb distortion effects are taken into account",
    "the cross sections without rpa correlations are shown by @xmath183 and the results with rpa correlations are shown by @xmath184 .",
    "we evaluate @xmath185 and @xmath184 in a hybrid model where at lower energies @xmath14 calculated with the fermi function and at higher energies @xmath14 calculated with mema is used to perform the flux averaging in eqn.23 . for low mass nuclei like @xmath120 , @xmath122 , etc .",
    "the flux averaged cross section has been evaluated with the cross section @xmath118 calculated with the fermi function .",
    "thus , in hybrid model , it is the lower value of the cross section which is used for calculating @xmath119 .",
    "we see from this table that the effect of the coulomb distortion is to increase the cross section and this increase is quite large for high @xmath186 nuclei like @xmath134 , @xmath144 , etc . in case of @xmath154 ,",
    "it is small but plays an important role in explaining the experimental result(compare column 1 and column 3 in table iv ) .",
    "a comparison of column 2 and column 3 in this table shows the strong reduction due to rpa correlations which increases with mass number .    in table - v",
    ", we compare our results with the results of some other calculations . in this energy region of the neutrinos , there are many theoretical calculations done for the inclusive neutrino reactions in @xmath154@xcite-@xcite , @xcite-@xcite , while there are few calculations for @xmath155@xcite , @xmath160@xcite,@xcite and @xmath162@xcite,@xcite-@xcite and some other nuclei@xcite .",
    "some calculations are similar to the calculations presented in this paper@xcite-@xcite while others make use of shell model@xcite-@xcite , random phase approximation(rpa ) with pairing correlations@xcite-@xcite,@xcite-@xcite and elementary particle approach@xcite-@xcite .",
    "we see that for @xmath154 and @xmath160 our results are in fair agreement with the experimental results and other theoretical calculations . for @xmath162 nucleus our results for @xmath119",
    "is comparatively smaller than the results of refs.@xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this is mainly due to the different approaches of taking into account the nuclear effects .",
    "however , among the different calculations of the inclusive cross section @xmath119 in @xmath162 , the results do not agree among themselves@xcite,@xcite-@xcite .",
    "therefore , more work is needed for calculating the cross section in @xmath162 at low energies .",
    "we have studied the charged current @xmath7 reactions on various nuclei which are of present interest .",
    "the cross section calculations are performed in a local density approximation taking into account the pauli blocking , fermi motion and the renormalization of weak transition strengths in the nuclear medium .",
    "the effect of coulomb distortion for the charged lepton while coming out of the nucleus is taken into account by using the fermi function as well as the modified momentum approximation(mema ) .",
    "the cross sections are then averaged over the @xmath7 spectra obtained from the muons decay at rest where the maximum energy of neutrinos is 52.8mev .",
    "the role of nuclear effects like q value , pauli blocking and fermi motion is to reduce the cross sections . for a given z ,",
    "this reduction becomes smaller with the increase in energy .",
    "for example , at @xmath163 , this suppression is @xmath158 @xmath164 for @xmath154 and @xmath158 @xmath165 for other nuclei like @xmath160 , @xmath161 , etc .",
    "this suppression reduces to @xmath166 in all these nuclei at @xmath167 .",

    "this reduction becomes smaller with the increase in neutrino energy , while for a given neutrino energy @xmath187 , this reduction increases with z. for example at @xmath163 the rpa correlations give a further reduction of @xmath168 for @xmath154 , @xmath169 for @xmath160 and around @xmath170 for @xmath161 and @xmath162 and at @xmath167 this reduction is @xmath171 for @xmath154 , @xmath172 for @xmath160 and around @xmath168 for @xmath161 and @xmath162 .",
    "the two methods of treating the coulomb distortion give similar results for low energy neutrinos in the case of low mass nuclei .",

    "for example it is around 40mev for nuclei like @xmath160 in the intermediate mass range and around 18mev for nuclei in the heavier mass range like @xmath162 .",
