    "a method commonly used to study nonequilibrium dynamics in cold atomic gases and trapped ion systems is a global quench , a sudden change of a global control parameter.@xcite numerically , such dynamics can be studied by approximating the time evolved quantum state by a matrix product state ( mps).@xcite the time interval accessible by this method is determined by the rate at which the entanglement grows because an mps with a finite matrix dimension can only faithfully approximate weakly entangled states .",
    "it is therefore of great interest to understand precisely how the entanglement depends on time following a quantum quench .",
    "while this question has already been studied extensively for clean systems@xcite , disordered systems have only recently come into focus.@xcite in such systems entanglement can , in addition , also provide a novel viewpoint to study localization .",
    "this is particularly useful in interacting many - body systems where a picture based on single particle states and related localization measures are not applicable .    in a generic clean quantum system",
    "we expect that the entanglement of most eigenstates follows a volume law .",
    "a well - known exception is the ground state of a local hamiltonian which typically shows an area law scaling.@xcite given that a generic initial state in a quantum quench is a linear combination of many different eigenstates of the hamiltonian responsible for the unitary time evolution , the entanglement of an infinite system , in general , grows without bounds as a function of time .",
    "a commonly used measure of entanglement for many - body systems is the entanglement entropy @xmath3 which is the von - neumann entropy of a reduced density matrix @xmath4 obtained from the regular density matrix @xmath5 by splitting the system into two parts @xmath6 and @xmath7 and taking a partial trace .    the entanglement growth @xmath8 is best understood for a global quench in a one - dimensional conformally invariant system.@xcite in this case , conformal field theory predicts a linear increase of the entanglement in time for @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the velocity of excitations and @xmath11 the length of block @xmath6 . for @xmath12 the entanglement entropy saturates .",
    "this behavior can physically be understood in a picture of entangled quasiparticles which move in opposite directions.@xcite the lightcone - like spreading implied by this picture is consistent with the lieb - robinson bounds.@xcite    conformal field theory works surprisingly well even on a quantitative level for quenches in one - dimensional critical lattice models where conformal invariance only holds approximately at low energies .",

    "this has to be contrasted with the linear growth in the clean case and a saturation , @xmath34 , which might naively be extected in an anderson insulating phase of noninteracting particles due to the finite localization length .    while disorder is always a relevant perturbation for a non - interacting one - dimensional quantum system,@xcite critical points or lines between localized phases can still exist and the above picture for the entanglement growth in an anderson insulator is , in general , too naive .",
    "two well - known examples where critical behavior in a disordered system occurs are the transverse ising chain and the xx model with bond disorder . @xcite a real - space renormalization group ( rsrg ) treatment  where the strongest bonds are successively eliminated  predicts that such systems are driven to an infinite randomness fixed point where the _ mean localization length _ scales as @xmath35 with a critical exponent @xmath36 and is much larger than the _ typical localization length_.@xcite these systems therefore show a delocalization transition as a function of eigenenergy @xmath37 . for the ground state entanglement entropy of a block of length @xmath11 in an infinite critical random system",

    "furthermore , the saturation value , eq .  , will then follow a volume law , @xmath49 , but will remain smaller than in a system where the subsystem @xmath6 reaches thermal equilibrium .    in this paper",
    "we will present a thorough numerical analysis of the entanglement dynamics in generic and critical one - dimensional systems which can be described in terms of free fermions .",
    "in particular , we will test the various scaling predictions above which have been obtained based on the rsrg - x approach .",
    "our work extends and generalizes previous numerical studies of the entanglement dynamics in such systems @xcite by considering both xx and transverse field ising models with various types of disorder and by providing numerical data for larger systems , larger sample sizes , and including multiprecision data required to access long times . for the interacting xxz model we will try to bridge the gap between rsrg - x predictions for bond disorder quenching from the neel state and numerical studies which have so far concentrated mostly on potential disorder . checking the rsrg - x predictions for the bond disordered case numerically",
    "is important because the rsrg - x results for critical mbl phases are not applicable to the case of potential disorder .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : as an example for a generic disordered system of non - interacting particles we study @xmath8 for the xx model , eq .",
    ", with potential disorder in section [ pot_disorder ] . in section [ bond_disorder ] we present results for the critical xx model with bond disorder . in both sections we consider a box as well as a binary disorder distribution . in section [ ising ]",
    "we show that qualitatively similar results as for the critical xx model with bond disorder are also obtained for the critical random transverse ising model . using exact diagonalizations of small systems and density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) calculations for infinite systems with binary bond disorder",
    "we then investigate in section [ interaction ] the entanglement growth once interactions are included . in the final section [ conclusions ]",
    "we summarize our main results and discuss them in the light of the rsrg - x predictions and recent numerical studies of mbl phases .",
    "as an example for a generic , non - critical disordered system we consider in the following the xx chain , eq .  , with potential disorder @xmath50 drawn either from a box or a binary distribution , and @xmath51 fixed .    without disorder , there are three length scales in the problem : the chain length @xmath21 , the dynamical scale @xmath52 , and the block length @xmath11 . for most parts of the paper",
