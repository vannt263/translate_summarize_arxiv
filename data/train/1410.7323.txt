    "to understand and describe mott metal - insulator transition ( mit ) is a long - standing and widely known difficult problem in condensed matter physics because it involves a strongly correlated electron system , in which the conventional theoretical tools prove of little help and non - perturbative techniques are called for . at this stage",
    ", holography may provide insights into the associated mechanisms of these strongly correlated electron systems by building a gravitational dual model which is usually solvable in the large @xmath2 limit .",
    "some excellent examples are the holographic superconductor @xcite and holographic ( non)-fermi liquid @xcite .    as early as 1930s",
    ", it was reported that many transition - metal oxides ( such as nio ) with partially filled bands show insulating behavior .",
    "peierls ascribed that to the strong electron - electron correlation .",
    "and then , mott made a series of pioneering work towards understanding how electron - electron correlations could explain the insulating state@xcite .",
    "roughly speaking , the main idea of mott is that the transition from metal to insulator occurs as lattice constant increases .",
    "subsequently , this idea of mott is formalized in the hubbard model in which the mott transition depends on the competition between the kinetic energy ( @xmath3 ) and the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath4 .",
    "the metallic behavior prevails if the kinetic energy @xmath5 overcomes the coulomb energy @xmath4 while insulating phase is favored for @xmath6 and a gap opens in the single - particle excitation spectrum , resulting in a mott transition at a critical ratio of @xmath7 .    by adding probe fermions with dipole coupling in rn - ads black hole@xcite , a mott gap opens dynamically , which exhibits two key features of doped mott insulator , i.e. , the dynamical generation of a gap and spectral weight transfer . and",
    "then , the dipole coupling effects have also been studied in more general geometries in @xcite . along this line , here we shall study the holographic fermionic system with dipole coupling in q - lattice geometry .    holographic q - lattice model is firstly proposed in @xcite , which is similar to the construction of q - balls @xcite .",
    "some extensive studies have been presented in @xcite . in this framework ,",
    "the translational symmetry is broken and mit is observed through the study of optical conductivity .",
    "different from the holographic scalar lattice and ionic lattice constructed in @xcite , which involve solving the pdes and need a hard numerical work , but here we only need solve odes for q - lattice . in particular , mit is not observed in scalar lattice or ionic lattice background yet .",
    "the difficulties of numerical calculation prevent one from dropping the temperature down to an extremely low level in this context . here",
    ", we are interested in understanding if there is a relationship between the phase ( metal / insulator ) the background geometry with q - lattice is in and that the fermionic excitations on q - lattice are in . therefore ,",
    "in this paper we shall study the fermionic excitations by adding a probe fermion with dipole coupling in q - lattice geometry .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sqlattices ] ,",
    "based on the holographic model originally presented in @xcite , which introduces q - lattice structure in one spatial direction , we generalize it to a two dimensional lattice model which in general can be anisotropic in @xmath8 plane .",
    "and then , the dirac equations over this q - lattice background are deduced in section [ sdirac ] . in section [ smott ] ,",
    "we present our numerical results for the fermionic spectral function .",
    "we conclude in section [ sconclusion ] with a summary of main results and suggestions for future research .",
    "here we are interested in a holographic q - lattice geometry with no translational symmetry in both of the spatial directions . for this purpose , we consider a system containing two complex scalar fields @xmath9 and @xmath10 plus a maxwell field @xmath11 .",
    "a similar construction can also be seen in @xcite .",
    "the simplest action may take the form as , @xmath12,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 .",
    "the equations of motion can be derived from the above action as follows @xmath14 consider the following ansatz @xmath15 with @xmath16 and substitute them into ( [ eom ] ) , one has five second order odes for @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and one first order ode for @xmath22 .",
    "note that in above ansatz , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are two wave - numbers along @xmath25 and @xmath26 directions , respectively , such that @xmath9 is periodic in @xmath25 direction with a lattice constant @xmath27 and @xmath10 is periodic in @xmath26 direction with a lattice constant @xmath28 .",
    "in addition , in our holographic setup , the dual cft involves two complex scalar operators with scaling dimension @xmath29 .",
    "when either of the masses falls in the interval @xmath30 , the @xmath31 bf bound near the horizon will be violated by the scalar field , possibly leading to a different ground state . to avoid this possibility",
    ", we will set @xmath32 for definiteness in our paper , which corresponds to the scaling dimension of @xmath33 and @xmath34 .    to solve the odes numerically ,",
    "we impose a regular boundary condition at the horizon @xmath35 and impose the following conditions on the conformal boundary @xmath36 in this paper , we only focus on the standard quantisation of the scalar field , in which the asymptotic behaviors of @xmath20 and @xmath21 look like @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "the uv behavior of the scalar field corresponds to a q - lattice deformation with lattice amplitudes @xmath39 .",
    "in addition , the temperature of the black hole is given by @xmath40 as a result , each of our q - lattice solutions is specified by five dimensionless quantities @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "for simpleness , we shall still use @xmath46 , @xmath39 and @xmath47 to denote the above five dimensionless quantities in what follows .",
    "to explore the properties of fermionic spectral function in the q - lattice geometry , we consider the following action including the dipole coupling with strength @xmath0 between the fermion and gauge field@xcite @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 with @xmath51 and @xmath52 being a set of orthogonal normal vector bases and the spin connection 1-forms , respectively . here , the fermion is a probe field .",
    "note that we have set the gauge coupling constant @xmath53 here .",
    "it is different from the conventions in @xcite , in which they set @xmath54 .",
    "consequently the charge @xmath55 and dipole coupling @xmath0 here will correspond to @xmath56 and @xmath57 in @xcite as the relevant quantities are the products @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the dirac equation can be deduced from the above action @xmath60 to cancel off the spin connection , we can make a redefinition of @xmath61 . at the same time , by the fourier expansion , @xmath62 where @xmath63 , one has @xmath64 choose the following gamma matrices @xmath65 and split the 4-component spinor into two 2-component spinors as @xmath66 , one has @xmath67 furthermore , by the decomposition @xmath68 with @xmath69 , the above dirac equation can be expressed as @xmath70 @xmath71 at the horizon , we can find that @xmath72 in order to obtain the retarded green function on the boundary by holography , the independent ingoing boundary condition should be imposed at the horizon , i.e. , @xmath73 near the ads boundary , the dirac field reduces to @xmath74 and so by holography , the retarded green function can be read off @xmath75 note that since the four components of the dirac fields couple to one another , we need to construct a basis of finite solutions , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , to obtain the boundary green function .",
    "we are mainly interested in the measurable spectral function , which is @xmath78 .",
    "in this section , we study the properties of spectral function on q - lattice",
    ". we shall firstly address mott transition in an isotropic q - lattice , in which we set @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "so , in this paper , we shall denote @xmath81 and @xmath82 except in subsection [ anisotropic ] , where we give a brief discussion on anisotropic spectral function .",
    "for definiteness , we work exclusively with the massless fermion and fix @xmath83 . in addition , we work at a very low but non - zero temperature of @xmath84 for this paper except the subsection [ st ] , in which we explore the dynamics at different temperatures .      in this subsection , we present the results for free fermionic spectral function on q - lattice . because the notion of fermi surface is only well defined at zero temperature , for our q - lattice system of low but non - zero temperature , we need an operational definition , which has been proposed in @xcite and adopted in holographic models @xcite . it is argued that the fermi momentum @xmath85 can be determined by searching the peak of @xmath86 with a tiny frequency @xmath87 . with the use of this operational definition ,",
    "we show the 3d plot of spectral function @xmath88 for a tiny @xmath87 in the left plot in fig.[d3v1 ] .",
    "we can see that the shape of fermi surface is a circle , which is in agreement with the fact that our holographic q - lattice geometry is isotropic . for convenience",
    ", we shall set @xmath89 in what follows .",
    "as an example , the 3d plot of @xmath90 is shown in the right plot in fig.[d3v1 ] .",
    "a peak occurs near @xmath91 and @xmath92 , indicating a fermi surface .",
    "the q - lattice effects on the evolution of the free fermionic spectral function can be seen as follows .",
    "on one hand , one can fix the wave - number and see the changes of spectrum with the lattice amplitude .",
    "we show an example on the left plot in fig.[avkdlambda ] , where @xmath93 . for large @xmath94 ( @xmath95 , blue line in the left plot in fig.[avkdlambda ] )",
    ", only a small bump is displayed . with the decrease of @xmath94 ,",
    "the small bump grows into a peak , which indicates the emergence of the fermi surface . on the other hand",
    ", one can fix the lattice amplitude and adjust the wave - number @xmath96 to see its impact on the shape and location of fermi surface . from the right plot in fig.[avkdlambda ] , we see that with the augmentation of the wave - number @xmath96 , the fermi peak shifts to positions with larger momenta .",
    "moreover , we notice that the height of peak for @xmath93 is lower than that for @xmath97 or @xmath98 .",
    "it appears to be a turning point around @xmath93 . in the subsequent subsection ,",
    "such a turning point can be further confirmed by studying the critical value @xmath99 of the onset of the gap and the gap width @xmath1 .",
    "finally , we would like to point out that no matter how to tune the lattice amplitude @xmath94 and wave - number @xmath96 , one can not observe a gap open at the fermi level ( @xmath100 ) , even though the q - lattice background is dual to a deep insulating phase .",
    "it implies that in the absence of coupling , the holographic q - lattice background itself is not able to drive fermionic probes to undergo a mott transition . to model mott physics",
    ", we shall introduce the dipole coupling term as proposed in @xcite .",
    "a mott insulator is signaled by a vanishing spectral weight , i.e. , a suppression of @xmath101 around @xmath91 .",
    "the 3d plot of spectral function @xmath90 with @xmath102 for @xmath103 and @xmath93 in fig.[gap_d3 ] shows such a gap , which has previously been observed in rn - ads geometry @xcite and other backgrounds @xcite .",
    "in addition , two bands are located in the positive frequency and negative frequency regions , respectively .",
    "furthermore , we also show the spectral function @xmath90 with fixed @xmath0 for sample values of @xmath104 in fig.[avomegafork ] . for @xmath105 (",
    "the left plot in fig.[avomegafork ] ) , as the peak approaches @xmath91 , it becomes sharper and narrower , indicating a fermi surface at @xmath106 . while the right plot in fig.[avomegafork ] shows the spectral function @xmath90 with @xmath102 for sample values of @xmath104 .",
    "it indicates that when @xmath0 exceeds certain critical point @xmath99 , a gap opens and exists for all @xmath104 .",
    "the above observation strongly manifests that a transition occurs from a ( non)-fermi like phase to an insulating phase .    to gain a better understanding of the spectral measure with dipole coupling on q - lattice , we study the density of states (",
    "dos ) for our fermionic system .",
    "the dos @xmath101 signals the total weight of the spectral measure and is defined by the integral of @xmath107 over @xmath104 and @xmath108 .",
    "since we have set @xmath89 , the dos only probes the effects in @xmath104 direction .",
    "fig.[dosvp ] shows the dos @xmath101 with @xmath103 and @xmath93 , and exhibits the dynamical generation of a gap with the increase of the diploe coupling @xmath0 .",
    "more importantly , as @xmath0 increases , the spectral weight switches gradually from the positive frequency region to the negative frequency region .",
    "the dynamical generation and spectral weight transfer are two key features of doped mott physics .",
    "such observations are confirmed by checking other values of lattice parameters @xmath94 and @xmath96 .",
    "therefore , the mott transition in holographic q - lattice fermionic system can be implemented by introducing a dipole coupling , which is supposed to play double roles of doping as well as on - site interaction like @xmath4 in hubbard model , as argued in rn - ads geometry @xcite .",
    "now , we turn to study the critical value @xmath99 of mott transition , which reflects how easy it is to open the gap dynamically . in numerical calculations ,",
    "the onset of gap can be identified as that the dos @xmath101 at the fermi level drops below some small number ( here , we take @xmath109 ) . with this in mind , we find that the critical value @xmath110 for @xmath103 and @xmath93 , which corresponds to a metallic phase in @xcite .",
    "while for an insulating phase with @xmath95 and @xmath111 , @xmath112 .",
    "it implies that the gap opens easier in a deep insulating phase than metallic phase .",
    "this observation can be further confirmed by evaluating the critical value for various wave number @xmath96 and lattice amplitude @xmath94 , as we list in table [ tablev1 ] and [ tablev2 ] .",
    "nevertheless , we notice that an anomalous behavior occurs for @xmath113 ( where @xmath114 is the critical value for mit at zero temperature , with @xmath115 for @xmath116 ) , in which the critical value @xmath99 diminishes slightly with the increase of @xmath96 , as opposite to that for @xmath117 .",
    ".[tablev1]@xmath99 for sample values of @xmath96 and fixed @xmath116 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     before working out the results of the ratio @xmath118 , we first make a qualitative description .",
    "fig.[d3dost ] shows a 3d plot of the spectral function at @xmath119 and the dos for different @xmath46 with @xmath116 and @xmath120 .",
    "it is obvious that the gap closes when the temperature exceeds some certain value .",
    "now , we work out the ratio @xmath118 for different lattice amplitudes @xmath94 and wave - numbers @xmath96 for @xmath121 ( table [ tablev3 ] ) . at @xmath84 instead of zero temperature gap . ] from table [ tablev3 ] we can see that most values of the ratio @xmath118 are approximately @xmath122 .",
    "especially , in the deep insulating background , the value of @xmath118 is larger than others , approaching @xmath123 . in summary , in our holographic fermionic system with dipole coupling on q - lattice , the temperature dynamics possesses non - trivial behavior , as revealed in rn - ads black hole @xcite .      in this subsection",
    ", we briefly discuss the fermi surface and gap on anisotropic q - lattice .",
    "as shown in fig.[anisotropic_p0 ] , if we set @xmath83 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 and @xmath126 for @xmath105 , we find that the fermi peaks along @xmath104 direction develop into some bumps .",
    "it exhibits an anisotropic peaks with different magnitudes , which suggests that insulating phase arises in one direction while metallic in the other .",
    "furthermore , when we switch on the dipole coupling @xmath0 , the gap along @xmath104 direction gradually opens but the bump still remain along @xmath108 direction ( fig.[anisotropic_p1 ] ) .",
    "finally , we would like to comment that the same statement is true for the conductivity on q - lattice .",
    "for instance , since the lattice is introduced in just one direction , the q - lattice geometries are highly anisotropic in @xcite , in which the calculation of the conductivity reveals that they can be insulators in the direction where the lattice is placed whilst remaining a pure metal in the other direction where the lattice is absence and the translational invariance is reserved .",
    "therefore , the anisotropic geometry with insulating phase in one direction but metallic in the other provides us more space to model real materials with anisotropy by holography .",
    "our main results in this paper are :    * two key features of doped mott physics , the dynamical emergence of a gap and the spectral weight transfer , are observed in the q - lattice background with dipole coupling .",
    "such features have been observed in many of holographic fermionic systems including dipole coupling , e.g. , rn - ads geometry and other geometry .",
    "it confirms the robustness of the generations of mott gap induced by dipole coupling , which play the double roles of doping as well as the interaction strength @xmath4 in the hubbard model . *",
    "the most important thing is that the fermionic system with dipole coupling on q - lattice can exhibit abundant mott physics due to the introduction of wave - number @xmath96 and lattice amplitude @xmath94 . *",
    "the evolution of the spectral function as a function of temperature reveals the non - trivial temperature dynamical behavior , which indicates the mott transition induced by dipole coupling on q - lattice is due to strong correlations but not the spontaneous breaking of some symmetry .",
    "* for the free fermionic system , the wave - number @xmath96 and the lattice amplitude @xmath94 can not generate the mott gap .",
    "when dipole coupling @xmath0 exceeds some critical value , the gap opens and , usually , the gap opens much easily in deep insulating phase .",
    "* the anisotropic peaks with different magnitudes occurs in our holographic fermionic system on q - lattice .",
    "it indicates that insulating and metallic phases arise in different directions , respectively .      * rather than the dipole coupling",
    ", we may introduce other sorts of couplings to induce the mott transition .",
    "especially the interaction of electron - phonon as @xmath127 may have a manifest periodic structure and generate brillouin zones .",
    "our work on this subject is under progress .",
    "* by the poles and zeros duality through the @xmath128 , the pseudo - gap phase can be observed in the holographic fermions with dipole coupling in rn - ads geometry@xcite .",
    "it is valuable to address this problem in the holographic q - lattice model . *",
    "it is interesting to study the fermi arc phenomenology in the anisotropic q - lattice model .",
