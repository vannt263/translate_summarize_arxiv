    "over the decades several authors have dealt with the problem of physical systems with moving boundaries , both in quantum field theory , especially in connection with the casimir effect  @xcite , and in the context of quantum mechanics , for example in connection with the fermi problem of a quantum bouncer  @xcite . over the years",
    ", several works appeared studying the problem of particles confined in a box with moving walls  @xcite , sometimes focusing on boundaries having specific shapes  @xcite .",
    "the study of this kind of problems is relevant to several conceptual aspects of quantum mechanics , from the analysis of the semiclassical limit of a quantum ( chaotic ) system  @xcite to the incoming of geometric phases  @xcite , and it is connected with the derivation of analytical solutions of the dynamics of systems governed by such mathematically complicated potentials as delta functions  @xcite .",
    "the interest in such a class of problems is present in different physical scenarios and can lead to intriguing applications .",
    "for example , in the field of cavity quantum electrodynamics appeared a study of the implications of small displacements of the mirrors on the dynamics of an atom interacting with the cavity modes  @xcite . on the other hand , cooling techniques of trapped particles based upon exploitation of expanding boxes have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the study of two particles in a box with moving boundaries has been recently presented , and the relevant results suggest the idea of an effective interaction between the particles induced by their common interaction with the moving walls  @xcite .",
    "the problem of many particles in a box with moving walls ( possibly in higher dimensional situations ) has also been treated , especially in connection with shortcuts to adiabaticity and in the context of bose - einstein condensates  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we firstly review some recent results concerning the dynamics of a particle confined in a one - dimensional box , pointing out the delicate mathematical aspects of this class of problems and presenting an approach to overcome the relevant difficulties  @xcite . secondly , on the basis of this approach",
    ", we report on the analytical study of a wide class of problems of a single particle in a two - dimensional box whose walls are moving .",
    "in fact , following the way paved in ref .",
    "@xcite for a 2d elliptical billiard and in ref .",
    "@xcite for a 1d box , we transform the original problem of a system with changing boundaries into the problem of a system with fixed boundaries governed by a time - dependent hamiltonian . generally speaking ,",
    "resolution of dynamical problems in the presence of time - dependent hamiltonians is a hard task , hence complete or partial analytical solutions are known only in special cases , for example in the adiabatic limit  @xcite or in the presence of periodical potentials  @xcite . in most cases ,",
    "perturbation theory  @xcite or numerical methods  @xcite are the only effective ways to solve such problems .    in our case , we will exploit standard perturbation approach in order to bring to the light some new effects .",
    "we will show that the very novelty in the study of 2d and 3d problems with respect to the one - dimensional case is the role of the shape of the moving box , which is obviously absent at all in the one - dimensional case .",
    "in fact , for two- and three - dimensional boxes , we can consider two classes of problems : on the one hand the ones that we dub as pantographic , where the dimensions of the box change but its shape remains invariant ; on the other hand the cases where the shape ( and possibly the dimensions ) of the box changes , meaning that we are in the presence of deformationof the contour .",
    "we start our analysis by constructing the framework of the most general case of a 2d box undergoing dilation and deformation , then we proceed by specializing our analysis to the pantographic case and eventually we present a perturbative treatment of the problem where the shape of the boundary is only slightly modified ( small deformations ) .",
    "though in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite three - dimensional dilating domains have been considered , the role of deformation has not been treated in such works . on the contrary , in ref .",
    "@xcite it is analyzed an elliptical billiard whose axes have time - dependent lengths , focusing in particular on the case where the lengths of the axes are oscillating at a given frequency , and then numerically evaluating the dynamics of the particle in the moving box .",
    "albeit the authors succeed in going through many details , their analysis is strictly related to a specific geometry .",
    "our work is different since we aim at describing the very more general situation wherein the shape can be modified in any possible way , provided the domain is kept as a star domain .",
    "in fact , we will write down the relevant general equations and will study them under the assumption that the deformation can be considered as a perturbation . on this basis , we will evaluate the time evolution through the standard approach in a specific case ( a circle which is deformed to an ellipse ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we summarize some recent results related to the one - dimensional problem , also presenting the general approach of ref  @xcite ( which is analogous to that of ref .",
    "@xcite ) that we will use through all the paper . in section [ sec:2dhamiltonian ]",
    "we introduce the problem of a two - dimensional box whose border is changing , defining the two classes of pantographic changes and changes with deformation . in section [ sec : pantography ] we study the pantographic case , while in section [ sec : deformations ] we use perturbation theory to study the effects of deformation of the border of the box . finally in section [ sec : discussion ] we provide some conclusive remarks and very briefly discuss the extension of the results to the three - dimensional case .",
    "a ( free ) non - relativistic quantum particle of mass @xmath0 confined in a certain domain @xmath1 is formally described by the usual ( free ) particle hamiltonian in the space region corresponding to the box , @xmath2 imposing suitable boundary conditions , in such a way that @xmath3 is self - adjoint .",
    "one of the possible is that the wave function of the particle is vanishing in the border of the box ( @xmath4 ) : @xmath5    now , if the domain @xmath1 is not static , there is a non trivial technical problem in the resolution of the schrdinger equation related to the fact that we have to solve a differential equation in a hilbert space which is continuously changing , so that , for example , the time derivative of the wave function is not well defined in the border of the box . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath6 is a point of the border at time @xmath7 which does not belong to the border at time @xmath8 , then the quantity @xmath9 is meaningless . according to the approach in ref  @xcite ,",
    "this difficulty can be overcome by enlarging the domain of definition of the hamiltonian in such a way that the such operator acts as the usual ( free ) particle hamiltonian in the space region corresponding to the box and is zero elsewhere ( i.e. , in the complement @xmath10 ) : @xmath11 of course , the condition expressed by eq .",
    "( [ eq : boundarycondition ] ) that the wave function of the particle vanishes in the border of the box will be kept . in this way",
    ", the wave function turns out to be properly defined for any @xmath12 , being zero out of the box .",
    "though the most natural choice for the extension of the hamiltonian would be to put the operator equal to infinity out of the box ( which is also a better description from the physical point of view ) , we stress that here the main reason for extending the hamiltonian operator is that we want to extend the wave function out of the box .",
    "now , since the wave function is anyway vanishing out of the box because of the boundary conditions , any extension of the hamiltonian would be fine , in the sense that the specific choice of the form of the operator out of the box is irrelevant to the dynamical description of the system .",
    "therefore , we have decided to exploit the simplest mathematical extension .    in order to better treat the dynamical problem associated to eq .",
    "( [ eq : extendedhamiltonian ] ) , we can map it into the problem of a particle in a fixed domain , say @xmath13 , governed by a suitable effective time - dependent hamiltonian , @xmath14 : @xmath15 @xmath16    this passage can be done through the action of a suitable unitary operator .      in ref  @xcite",
    "it has been studied the case of a particle in a one - dimensional box when both of its walls are moving , each one with its own velocity ; stated another way , the size of the box is changing and at the same time the center of the box is moving .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we will summarize the results when the center of the box is quiet , so that the particle domain is @xmath17 $ ] , with @xmath18 the dilation dimensionless parameter .",
    "this problem is then mapped into the one related to the box delimited by @xmath19 $ ] .",
    "the relevant transformation is given by the unitary operator @xmath20 such that @xmath21 under this transformation , the original hamiltonian , @xmath22 is replaced by the new generator of the time evolution : @xmath23 \\oplus_{{\\bar{{{\\cal d}}}}_0 } 0\\,.\\ ] ]    the price to pay to obtain static boundaries is to make the hamiltonian explicitly time - dependent . in particular , in this case we have obtained that the kinetic energy , in the new picture , is that of a particle with changing mass ( as an effect of the presence of the dilation parameter @xmath18 in the denominator ) .",
    "moreover , the particle is subjected to an additional energy term , the one proportional to @xmath24 , which is nothing but @xmath25 , i.e. the generator of the dilation .",
    "it is worth noting that among the two terms , only the first one preserves the physical meaning of energy of the particle , being the result of a unitary transformation of the original energy operator . the second term , instead , is relevant only for determining the dynamics of the particle in the new picture .",
    "now , since the term @xmath26 does not commute with the operator @xmath27 , the kinetic energy of the particle is not conserved during the process .",
    "the relevant energy rate equation , which generalizes and improves the result present in ref  @xcite , is : @xmath28 \\,.\\ ] ]    this interesting formula shows that the change of energy is determined by the contact between the particle and the walls .",
    "one could think that a natural generalization of this would still be valid in a two- or three - dimensional context .",
    "this is what will be shown in the next section , together with some specific properties which have no analogous in the 1d case .",
    "in order to start our analysis of a two - dimensional problem , let us consider the case in which the domain of the wave functions is a star domain lying on a plane and delimited by a curve @xmath29 .",
    "we recall here that a region @xmath30 of @xmath31 is said to be a star domain if there exists a point @xmath32 such that @xmath33 the segment @xmath34 , for @xmath35 $ ] , lies in the interior of @xmath30 .",
    "assume that the curve describing the walls of the box can be represented by the following equation : @xmath36\\,,\\ ] ] where the origin of the polar coordinates is the _ center _ ( or one of the possible centers ) of the domain . here",
    "the one - to - one correspondence between @xmath37 and @xmath38 is guaranteed by the property of the domain to have a star - shape .",
    "the region delimited by @xmath29 is expressible as @xmath39 \\}$ ] .",
    "the boundary conditions on the wave function @xmath40 are expressible as : @xmath41.\\ ] ]    the domain @xmath42 can be mapped to another domain ( @xmath43 $ ] ) by the transformation @xmath20 acting as follows : @xmath44 such transformation is unitary . indeed , @xmath45    if the boundary is moving , we have that the curve @xmath29 changes and then the function @xmath18 depends on @xmath8 , @xmath46 .",
    "now , for the 2d problem of a confined particle , we have : @xmath47 @xmath48    @xmath49 = \\dot{r}(\\theta , t ) \\psi(r",

    "it is worth mentioning two technical aspects relevant to the previous equations .",
    "first , note that the wave functions @xmath54 and @xmath55 are assumed as time - independent .",
    "indeed , they are not meant as solutions of the schrdinger equation , but as generic elements of the hilbert spaces to which they belong .",
    "we just use them to make explicit the action of the operators considered above .",
    "second , when we perform @xmath38-derivatives , we have to take care of the twofold dependence on @xmath38 of the wave function , due to both the natural @xmath38-dependence and the possible additional @xmath38-dependence due to the action of @xmath20 or @xmath56 .",
    "for example , @xmath57 $ ] , where @xmath18 in general is a function of @xmath38 .",
    "the effective hamiltonian associated to the problem in the fixed domain  @xmath58  is rather involved , due to the deformation of the boundary .",

    "the remaining contributions , in the case @xmath63 , give what we call the pantographic hamiltonian ( well defined in the beginning of next section ) .",
    "in this situation , the term @xmath64 can be interpreted as the hamiltonian of a particle with a varying mass , while @xmath65 is the dilation term .",
    "it is anyway important to note that in the presence of deformation also @xmath66 depends on @xmath38 , hence giving rise to additional deformation terms .",
    "in fact , all the terms in @xmath61 are associated to deformation , but there are deformation terms which do not belong to @xmath61 .",
    "this will be clearer in section [ sec : deformations ] where the problem of deformation will be treated extensively . instead ,",
    "in the next section we will consider only pantographic changes of the domain , hence assuming @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",

    "it is possible to deduce a rate equation for the energy of the particle and to derive the exact dynamics in the special case of constant speed of the walls .",
    "let us now consider the energy rate equation in the two - dimensional pantographic case .",
    "in the original picture ( with moving walls ) , the average energy of the system is given by @xmath71 , so that in the picture with static walls such average energy is given by the mean value , over the state @xmath72 , of the operator @xmath73 in eq .",

    "we first consider the initial state @xmath195 ( the ground state ) , so that , at first order in the eccentricity , only transitions to states @xmath196 are allowed . in particular , in fig.[fig : transition_probab_1 ] we show the transition probabilities to the states @xmath197 with @xmath198 . due to the specific structure of the initial state and of the states of the basis ,",
    "the transition probabilities to @xmath199 and @xmath200 are equal .",
    "moreover , in fig.[fig : transition_probab_2 ] we show some of the transition probabilities evaluated assuming @xmath201 as the initial condition .",

    "in this paper we have extended the technique of ref  @xcite to the cases of two - dimensional boxes .",
    "we have first of all reviewed the results related to the one - dimensional problem , and then we have studied in depth the case of a freeparticle confined in a two - dimensional box by mapping such problem into the one of a particle in a fixed domain but governed by a time - dependent hamiltonian .",
    "the two - dimensional problem reveals an important element of novelty with respect to the one - dimensional case , which is the role of the shape of the box ( and its changing ) through the whole process .",
    "in fact , the time - dependent hamiltonian governing the dynamics of the particle in the picture associated to a fixed boundary is the sum of several terms , many of which disappear when the boundary of the box changes its dimensions but not its shape ( we have addressed this situation as the pantographic case ) .",
    "this has allowed to single out two classes of 2d problems depending on the presence of deformations of the contour of the box .    on the one hand we have shown that in the absence of deformation the results obtained in the one - dimensional case can be naturally extended .",
    "for example , the rate equation for the energy is just what one could guess starting from the rate equation of the energy in the one - dimensional moving box .",
    "moreover , the time evolution of the particle in the case of uniformly moving boundaries is the very natural extension of the one - dimensional counterpart .",
    "on the other hand when we consider deformation of the boundary , the situation becomes more complicated and the previously reported analogies to the one - dimensional case are no longer valid .",
    "in fact , the additional terms of the hamiltonian coming from the deformation of the contour make the resolution of the relevant dynamical problem very difficult .",
    "we have then used an approach based on perturbation theory assuming the pantographic hamiltonian as the unperturbed one , and the deformation terms , which play the role of perturbation , are assumed to be small enough . on this ground , we have shown that deformation of the boundary is responsible for transitions between pantographic states , which would not occur otherwise .    in order to conclude our analysis",
    ", we want to briefly comment on the fact that the methods and results reported for the 2d case can be easily extended to the case of a particle in a three - dimensional box .",
    "indeed , in the 3d pantographic case , after performing the passage to the static boundary picture , the generator of time evolution turns out to be again the sum of the kinetic energy of a varying - mass particle and a dilation term very similar to the two - dimensional one .",
    "the complete dynamical solution that one can obtain when the velocity of the boundary is constant and the general energy rate equation ( valid for any time dependence of the velocity of the walls ) are the very natural extensions of the two - dimensional counterparts . finally , if one considers also the presence of deformation , this can be treated perturbatively by following the same approach previously developed .",
    "obviously , every calculation is more cumbersome , since it involves more terms than in the two - dimensional case .",
