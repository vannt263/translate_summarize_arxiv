    "electron energy loss spectroscopy ( eels ) in the transmission electron microscope ( tem ) is a well - established experimental technique to study the electronic structure of materials .",
    "@xcite energy loss is directly linked to the imaginary part of the inverse dielectric function , and therefore many other properties of interest can be extracted from these measurements . combined with the imaging capabilities of the microscope , as well as optical and x - ray emission spectroscopies that can be performed in the tem ,",
    "eels is an excellent tool for materials characterization . in the past decades",
    ", the tem has experienced an impressive improvement in its performance .",
    "modern microscopes equipped with field - emission guns and monochromators routinely achieve an energy resolution of 0.5 ev or even 0.1 ev , @xcite while the resolution in the momentum transfer is better than 0.1 @xmath1 .",
    "equally strikingly , in scanning tems with aberration correction units the electron beam can attain diameters of sub - ngstrom dimensions .",
    "this provides unprecedented opportunities to study electronic structure at the atomic scale .",
    "@xcite    as a first approximation , a spatially - resolved electron energy loss spectrum can be viewed as the weighted convolution of momentum - dependent energy loss spectra .",
    "thus , the analysis of spatially - resolved spectroscopic information of complex inhomogeneous materials requires the understanding of momentum - resolved electron energy loss spectra of its constituents . since theoretical tools to accurately calculate momentum - dependent dielectric functions",
    "have also matured , @xcite it is very timely to pose an important question : how do results of state - of - the - art theoretical spectroscopy compare to measurements performed in modern tems ?    in this work ,",
    "we address this question taking three bulk noble metals , cu , ag , and au , as model systems .",
    "we focus on low ( valence ) energy losses .",
    "the study of optical and dielectric properties of bulk metals is a mature field in fundamental research , and has been such for quite some time .",
    "@xcite to illustrate this , it suffices to say that the first successful theoretical analysis of optical properties of simple metals at the microscopic level , the celebrated drude model , precedes the formulation of quantum mechanics by almost three decades .",
    "transition metals with fully or partially occupied @xmath2 states are certainly more complex than simple metals , @xcite but their optical properties have been studied extensively also for decades , both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "@xcite it may thus seem that no aspect concerning valence excitations is left unknown in these metals .",
    "while to a certain extent this is certainly true for dielectric properties up to 10 ev ( visible , near , mid , and far ultraviolet ) , a lot less is known about excitations with energies of several tenths ( up to @xmath3100 ) of ev ( extreme ultraviolet ) .",
    "lying between the optical range and shallow semi - core and core edges , these excitations are , in some sense , no - man s land .",
    "surprisingly , though being very important in the measurements of spatially - resolved electronic response , the momentum dependence of the electron energy - loss spectra in this energy range is little understood .",
    "therefore , the main objective of the present work is the study of momentum - dependent eels spectra of cu , ag , and au for energies higher than 10 ev .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ theory ] the methodology to calculate response functions as well as loss functions and dynamic structure factors is outlined .",
    "the experimental setup and the post - processing of raw experimental data is described in section [ expt ] .",
    "loss functions for small momentum transfers are analyzed and compared to experimental results in section [ loss - q - zero ] .",
    "momentum - dependent loss functions are presented and analyzed in section [ loss - q ] .",
    "in particular , the dispersion of the low - energy plasmon in ag is computed and compared with experimental data . in section [ conclusions ] , the main results are summarized and the impact of our findings is discussed .",
    "in the case of a periodic solid , the double - differential scattering cross section per unit volume for momentum transfer @xmath4 and electron energy loss @xmath5 is given by ( in atomic units ) : @xcite @xmath6 here @xmath7 is the fourier - transform of the coulomb interaction , @xmath8 is the dynamic structure factor ( per unit volume ) , @xmath9 is the relativistic factor for incident electrons , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the initial and the final electron momenta ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "@xmath8 describes quantum - mechanical electron density fluctuations of the physical system @xcite and is directly related to the macroscopic density response function @xmath13 : @xmath14 by definition , @xmath13 determines the macroscopic dielectric function via : @xmath15 and thus the double differential scattering cross section in eq .",
    "( [ ddscs - eels ] ) can be also expressed as : @xmath16 the imaginary part of the inverse dielectric function @xmath17 is a dimensionless quantity and is traditionally called the loss function .    the dynamic structure factor is also an important quantity in inelastic x - ray scattering spectroscopy ( ixs ) . in ixs ,",
    "the double - differential scattering cross - section is ( in atomic units ) : @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the fine structure constant , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are polarizations of the incident and the scattered wave . in the current paper",
    ", we will use the terms dynamic structure factor and momentum - dependent loss function interchangeably .",
    "they are related through @xmath22 and the relative merits preferring one over the other depend on the context .",
    "for example , the dynamic structure factor is more convenient when discussing x - ray scattering , since the double - differential scattering cross section in ixs is directly proportional to @xmath8 . at variance",
    ", the loss function is sometimes more convenient when discussing eels , even though the expression for the double - differential scattering cross section of electrons has an additional prefactor @xmath23 .    according to eq .",
    "( [ dsf ] ) , the main quantity that needs to be calculated is the macroscopic density - response function @xmath13 .",
    "the macroscopic quantity is related to its microscopic counterpart @xmath24 via @xcite @xmath25 here @xmath26 is the reciprocal lattice vector , and @xmath27 , so that @xmath28 is confined to the first brillouin zone . within the linear - response formulation of time - dependent density functional theory ( tddft ) ,",
    "@xcite the microscopic density - response function @xmath29 of the interacting many - electron system is related to the density - response function @xmath30 of the corresponding non - interacting kohn - sham system through the dyson equation , which is , symbolically : @xmath31 @xmath32 is the exchange - correlation kernel that accounts for all many - body effects , and @xmath30 is given as @xmath33 here , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 are single - particle wavefunctions , their eigenvalues , and occupation numbers , respectively ; indices @xmath37 and @xmath38 span all bands , so both so - called resonant and non - resonant terms are included in this approach ; @xmath39 is the volume of the unit cell . while the approach is formally exact , approximations are needed in practice .",
    "@xcite in this work , we use two different simple approximations . setting @xmath32 to 0 yields the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) , in which only the classical coulomb field of the induced charge density is accounted for when calculating @xmath29 .",
    "the second approximation is the adiabatic local density approximation ( alda or tdlda ) , in which @xmath32 is given by @xcite @xmath40 the tdlda kernel is local in space and time .",
    "thus , its fourier transform in time is frequency - independent , and the transform in real space , @xmath41 , depends only on @xmath28 and @xmath42 .",
    "more complicated kernels , such as those that attempt to include excitonic effects , are not used in this work as we are dealing with metals only .    an important concept in studying response functions",
    "is that of crystal local fields . taking the rpa as an example , we obtain from eq .",
    "( [ dyson ] ) : @xmath43",
    "the calculation of @xmath29 therefore involves the inversion of the matrix @xmath44 for each value of @xmath28 and @xmath5 .",
    "calculations are numerically involved as one needs to include a sufficient set of reciprocal lattice vectors for the representation of microscopic quantities , so that the final result is converged .",
    "neglecting all off - diagonal elements , or crystal local fields , is equivalent to dealing with scalar functions rather than matrices .",
    "this is equivalent to the assumption that the screening charge is independent of the position of the test charge inside the unit cell .",
    "the comparison of response functions calculated with or without the inclusion of local fields shows to what extent this assumption is realistic in a given material .    in this work ,",
    "the response functions have been determined via all - electron full - potential calculations based on the linearized augmented plane - wave ( fp - lapw ) method , as implemented in the exciting  code .",
    "@xcite for all metals , the experimental lattice constants have been used .",

    "an off - center 20@xmath4620@xmath4620 k - point mesh has been used for the brillouin zone sampling in most cases .",
    "for very large momentum transfers we have found it necessary to increase the mesh to 25@xmath4625@xmath4625 , while for an accurate determination of the plasmon dispersion in ag a 30@xmath4630@xmath4630 grid has been employed . to account for local - field effects , at least three shells of @xmath26 vectors ( @xmath47 27 vectors ) have been used .",

    "this led to poly - crystalline samples with grain sizes of 10 - 50 nm and only very little texturing .",
    "the film thickness @xmath2 was about 55 nm for cu , 50 nm for ag , and 35 nm for au .",
    "the films have been produced immediately before being transferred to the microscope to avoid oxidation .",
    "eels analysis has shown no detectable oxygen contamination .",
    "eels data for cu and au were acquired on a fei tecnai f20 tem equipped with a field - emission gun and a post column gatan imaging filter .",
    "the instrumental resolution was about 0.7 ev measured as the fwhm of the zero - loss peak without the specimen .",
    "the spectra were acquired in the diffraction mode , using a large selected area aperture to integrate over many crystal orientations .",
    "the momentum transfer was selected by varying the spectrometer s entrance aperture and camera length and moving the diffraction pattern projected on the spectrometer entrance aperture with the projective deflection coils . for cu ,",
    "the same camera length and spectrometer entrance aperture was used over the whole acquisition range , while for au the collection angle was increased when moving away from the central spot , allowing for a better signal at the expense of a lower angular resolution .",
    "the collection semi - angle was 0.1 mrad for cu and varied from 0.05 to 0.86 mrad for au .",
    "the spectra where acquired up to about 2/3 of the distance to the first diffraction ring , since for larger angles the total intensity started rising again , an indication that the intensity coming from the first diffraction ring was no longer negligible .    after the acquisition , the spectra where corrected for multiple scattering following the procedure by batson and silcox .",

    "[ q - zero - fig ] .",
    "the experimental losss functions were obtained from reflection eels ( disks ) using an algorithm to separate surface and bulk contributions and to take into account multiple scattering.@xcite the calculations are all based on the gga band structure but use three different approximations to determine response functions : rpa calculations taking local - field effects into account ( `` gga - rpa , with lfe '' , black solid lines and shaded areas ) , tdlda calculations with local - field effects ( `` gga - tdlda , with lfe '' , solid purple lines ) , and rpa calculations without local field effects ( `` gga - rpa , w / o lfe '' , dashed lines ) .",
    "calculations without local field effects reproduce earlier results @xcite in which the interband contribution was evaluated strictly for @xmath51 , and the intra - band contribution had the analytic drude form with appropriate parameters .    the most important conclusion that can be readily drawn from fig .  [ q - zero - fig ]",
    "is that the two most accurate theoretical treatments ( gga - rpa with lfe and gga - tlda with lfe ) overall provide an excellent desription of loss functions . more specifically : ( i ) in agreement with the established knowledge of low - energy optical properties of these three metals,@xcite only in ag does a well - defined low - energy plasmon ( peak ( 1 ) ) develops , while it is severely suppressed in cu and au .",
    "this is explained in more detail in ref .",
    "@xcite ( ii ) loss functions of all three metals are characterized by a broad structure with several well - defined peaks ; the origin of the peaks will be discussed in section [ peaks ] .",
    "( iii ) in the case of ag and au , local field effects are essential for energies @xmath50 40 ev .",
    "only the inclusion of these effects brings the calculated loss functions in agreement with experiment . at variance ,",
    "local - field effects are much less pronounced for cu .",
    "this surprising asymmetry between metals with very similar nominal electron configurations is explained in section [ lfe ] and ref .",
    "@xcite ( iv ) the effect of including a finite exchange - correlation kernel is approximately an order of magnitude smaller than that of the local fields .",
    "consequently , it is almost completely irrelevant for cu .",
    "this will be discussed in more detail in section [ lfe ] .",
    "the origin of the peaks in the loss function below 10 ev has been analyzed before,@xcite and reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite . in short , in cu peaks ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) in cu are characterized by the a small real part of the dielectric function @xmath52 , and have to be classified as plasmon resonances .",
    "these resonances are severely damped due to a significant value of the imaginary part of the dielectric function @xmath53 .",
    "similar reasoning applies to peak ( 2 ) of ag and peak ( 1 ) of au .",
    "@xcite ar variance , peak ( 1 ) of ag is a proper plasmon peak that originates from drude - type oscillations in the @xmath54 band renormalized by interband transitions from the 4@xmath2 state to the states above the fermi energy.@xcite we note in passing that all these peaks have been observed experimentally in numerous occasions .",
    "for example , peak ( 2 ) in ag has been used to image ag nanoparticles .",
    "@xcite    the origin of higher - energy peaks in the loss functions of cu , ag , and au can be understood in terms of a system of classical drude - lindhard oscillators.@xcite the corresponding model is presented in more detail in ref .",
    "@xcite . in short",
    ", the analysis shows that for each peak in @xmath53 there is an associated peak at slightly larger energies in the loss function , and the difference between the two frequencies decreases for higher - lying peaks .",
    "furthermore , the absolute value of the peak in the loss function is inversely proportional to the background value of @xmath52 at the peak position .",
    "( solid line ) , @xmath53 ( dashed line ) , and loss function ( shaded ares ) of cu , ag , and au in the energy range 11 - 60 ev .",
    "most important peaks due to excitations of valence electrons are marked in numbers .",
    "n@xmath55 and o@xmath55 edges of ag and au are also shown.,width=317 ]    indeed , as shown in fig .",
    "[ epsilon - large ] , these trends hold for peaks ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) of cu , peaks ( 3)-(7 ) of ag , and peaks ( 2)-(7 ) of au .",
    "this indicates that these excitations originate mainly from interband transitions and also implies that the drude plasmon does not play a significant role at such energies .",
    "a peak at @xmath5656 ev in the loss function of ag ( fig .",
    "[ epsilon - large ] ) corresponds to the n@xmath55 core edge ( excitations from 4@xmath57 bands ) , the experimental value being @xmath5662 ev .",
    "this shows that the 4@xmath57 states are significantly under - bound in gga , even more so than 4@xmath2 states .",
    "similarly , a peak at @xmath58 ev in the loss function of au corresponds to the o@xmath55 edge ( excitations from 5@xmath57 bands ) , while the m@xmath55 edge in cu appears above 60 ev . since our main focus is on excitations of valence electrons , however , we will neglect core excitations in subsequent discussions .",
    "the conclusion that eminent features in the loss function for energies @xmath50 10 ev are caused by interband transitions from @xmath2 states is probably expected and not surprising , and has been already suggested in ref .  [ ] for cu .",
    "the existence of these features on top of a broad background indicates that even at energies as high as 50 - 60 ev above the fermi level ( i.e. , more than 45 ev above the vacuum level ) electrons still feel the influence of the underlying atomic cores .",
    "indeed , for optical transitions from @xmath2 states to free - electron levels high above the fermi energy one would not expect any sharp features in the loss function .",
    "this finding is not new , however .",
    "in fact , already three decades ago speier _ et al . _",
    "performed bremsstrahlung isochromate spectroscopy ( bis ) measurements for cu and ag.@xcite bis is a variant of the inverse photoemission spectroscopy and measures the unoccupied density of states .",
    "_ found that for energies @xmath50 10 ev the unoccupied dos for cu and ag show several well pronounced peaks .",
    "in fact , there is a very nice correlation between peaks in the bis spectra and peaks in the eel spectra . in the case of ag , for example , for each of the peaks ( 3)-(7 ) in the eel spectrum there is a corresponding peak in the bis spectrum at about 4 ev lower energies .",
    "this nice correspondence underpins the interpretation that pronounced features in the loss functions arise because of interband transitions from occupied @xmath2 states to a part in the unoccupied continuum with a larger density of states .",
    "this conclusions is especially important for photo - electron spectroscopies , in which excited photo electrons of energies comparable to these ones are often described by plane waves .",
    "the loss function ( eq .  ) as measured in eels or ixs , naturally contains lfes , their strength , however , not being experimentally accessible .",
    "while the occurence of local - field effects in inhomogeneous solids has been known for decades @xcite , their importance varies from solid to solid . from a theoretical perspective one",
    "can get insight by considering the dielectric response of materials with and without these effects . where local fields are important both",
    "it has been demonstrated that the inclusion of lfes is very important for excitations from core @xcite and semi - core @xcite levels to the lowest unoccupied states .",
    "clearly , localized atomic - like states are far from the homogeneous electron gas model for which lfes vanish .",
    "sturm and oliveira@xcite have shown , however , that these effects also influence collective excitations in simple metals .",
    "these excitations couple to short wave - length ( large @xmath59 ) charge fluctuations via lfes and this significantly affects the width and the dispersion of the resulting plasmon for small @xmath59 .",
    "it was subsequently discovered that also the opposite effect can be observed : collective excitations that occur for small @xmath59 affect electron - hole excitations that occur at very large @xmath59 ( beyond the first brillouin zone).@xcite this interaction is small in si , where a plasmon fano antiresonance forms,@xcite while in mgb@xmath60 @xcite and compressed li @xcite the interaction is much stronger and leads to replicas of the plasmon at higher brillouin zones .    here , we discuss lfe for cu , ag , and au for small @xmath59 .",
    "lfe at finite @xmath59 are analyzed in section [ lfe2 ] .",
    "the results in fig .",
    "[ q - zero - fig ] show that for small @xmath59 the inclusion of local - field effects does not lead to notable differences for energies @xmath49 10 ev , but these effects are very pronounced at larger energies , especially for ag and au .",
    "since at larger energies , loss functions correspond to transitions from occupied @xmath2 states to planewave - like unoccupied states high above the fermi level , lfes reflect the rather localized nature of the @xmath2 orbitals",
    ". however , this conclusion seems to contradict the result that , between 10 and 60 ev , lfes are substantially smaller in cu than in ag and au .",
    "indeed , cu 3@xmath2 are more localized than ag 4@xmath2 or au 5@xmath2 states , and one would naturally expect lfes effects to reflect this trend . however , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , paradoxically , it is _ because _ of a larger degree of localization of cu 3@xmath2 that lfes are relatively small in the energy range studied .",
    "indeed , we find that lfes indirectly probe the density of @xmath2 states in reciprocal space .",
    "this density is significantly more spread out for cu than for ag and au . as a result ,",
    "it is being probed by planewave - like unoccupied states at higher energies .",
    "this is confirmed by our calculations .",
    "however , excitations from semi - core cu 3@xmath57 states start to overlap with excitations from 3@xmath2 states at the same energies .",
    "the effect of local fields on momentum - dependent loss functions is discussed in section [ lfe2 ] .",
    "it is clear from eqs .   and that in the optical limit , i.e. , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , the tdlda kernel does not change the dielectric functions when local field effects are neglected . indeed , in this case @xmath63\\chi^0_{00}(\\mathbf{q,\\omega}))$ ] . since @xmath64 is finite for all @xmath26 , including @xmath61 , and @xmath65 , the effect of the xc kernel is vanishing for small @xmath59",
    "thus , the choice of the tdlda kernel is important only when lfes are included . as seen in fig .",
    "[ q - zero - fig ] , the effect of the tdlda kernel on the loss function is in general small , i.e. , much smaller than that of local fields .",
    "this finding is in line with previous studies .",
    "@xcite as a result , the effect is totally negligible for cu for the energies studied here .",
    "@xmath66   and @xmath67 are indicated , where @xmath68 is the lattice constant.,title=\"fig:\",width=321 ]",
    "the calculated momentum - dependent loss functions for all three metals are shown in fig .",
    "[ loss - q - fig ] .",
    "the momentum transfer is along the [ 111 ] direction , and varies between 0.030 and 2.262 @xmath1 for cu , 0.026 and 1.849 @xmath1 for ag , and 0.027 and 1.921 @xmath1 for au .",
    "the upper limits correspond to momenta @xmath69 , where @xmath68 is the lattice constant .",
    "the special points @xmath70 and @xmath67 are indicated in fig .",
    "[ loss - q - fig ] .    despite several individual features ,",
    "most of the trends are the same for all three metals .",
    "while the loss functions for small momentum transfers are characterized by several well - pronounced peaks , as discussed above , their relative intensity tends to decrease with increasing momentum transfer .",
    "qualitatively , this can be understood by analyzing the density - response function of non - interacting electrons @xmath30 ( eq .  ) . for small @xmath28 , @xmath71 , and thus",
    "only dipole - allowed transitions contribute , provided local field effects are neglected .",
    "hence , the structure of the loss function is determined mainly by transitions from occupied @xmath2 to unoccupied states with @xmath57 and @xmath72 character . for",
    "larger @xmath59 , other transitions set in that , on average , smear out the peaks .",
    "this can also be seen by comparing the loss function for small @xmath59 ( mainly dipole - allowed transitions ) with the weighted joint density of states for optical transitions , defined as @xmath73 ( not shown ) .",
    "it does not discriminate between states of different symmetry .",
    "while all the peaks apparent in the loss function can be identified in the joint density of states , these are much less pronounced in the latter .    another important conclusion that can be drawn from fig .",
    "[ loss - q - fig ] is that peaks caused by interband transitions show little dispersion as @xmath59 increases .",
    "even though for certain peaks the position of their maxima varies by as much as one electron volt , this is not very significant given that the peak widths range from one to a few ev .",
    "in contrast to peaks that originate from interband transitions , plasmon peaks or peaks that have a plasmon component ( see section [ peaks ] ) show a different dependence on the momentum .",
    "peak ( 1 ) of ag is the only well - defined plasmon peak the dispersion of which is clearly parabolic ( see section [ plasmon - ag ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , also other low - energy peaks in cu , ag , and au have a parabolic component in their dispersion . since these peaks are either broad or not well - defined , it is difficult and probably not very useful to quantify their dispersion . in the case of ag , it is interesting to note that one observes a slight increase in intensity of peak ( 2 ) with momentum transfer where peaks ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) seem to overlap .    a general trend which can be readily seen in fig .  [ loss - q - fig ]",
    "is that , for the energies studied , the absolute value of the loss function decreases with increasing momentum .",
    "the f - sum rule @xcite must be fulfilled for all @xmath28 , implying that the weight is redistributed from smaller to larger energies with increasing momentum transfer .",
    "this aspect is discussed in more detail in ref",
    ".  @xcite .",
    "the reason behind can be already understood by analyzing the loss function of the homogeneous electron gas , i.e. , the lindhard dielectric function .",
    "the presented analysis pertains to loss functions that are calculated using gga single - particle eigenvalues .",
    "the conclusions still hold when approximate @xmath74 corrections are applied ( figure not shown ) . indeed",
    ", we find that only peak ( 1 ) of ag is significantly affected .",
    "the intensity and dispersion of peaks that originate from interband transitions is barely altered .",
    "the only difference is that these peaks move to higher energies , reflecting the downward shift of @xmath2 states .",
    "this finding underpins that these peaks are caused by optical transitions from @xmath2 states .",
    "the loss functions presented in fig .  [ loss - q - fig ] correspond to momentum transfer @xmath28 in the [ 111 ] direction . due to difficulties in sample preparation",
    ", electron microscopy work is often performed on polycrystalline samples , like those described in section [ expt - res ] .",
    "it is thus important to understand to what extent the conclusions reached in the previous section apply to other crystallographic directions . in fig .",
    "[ anisotropy - fig ] , we show the calculated loss function of ag for various momentum transfers ( 0.076 , 0.526 , 1.052 , and 1.730 @xmath1 ) along the high - symmetry directions [ 111 ] , [ 001 ] , and [ 110 ] .",
    "as expected , the anisotropy is very small for the smallest momenta and becomes slightly more pronounced for larger ones .",
    "however , even for the largest momentum transfer of 1.730  , differences between different crystallographic directions are only quantitative . indeed ,",
    "loss functions for @xmath59 along different directions possess essentially the same features .    despite the lack of very obvious differences ,",
    "certain minor distinctions can still be identified .",
    "for example , anisotropy is quite visible for the loss function at about 35 ev , which corresponds to peak ( 5 ) for smaller momenta ( cf .",
    "[ loss - q - fig](b ) ) .",
    "the results in fig .",
    "[ anisotropy - fig ] show that the rate of decrease is slightly different for various crystallographic directions , being fastest for the [ 111 ] direction , slightly slower for [ 110 ] , and slowest for [ 001 ] .",
    "we can conclude that the overall anisotropy is quite small for the considered momenta .",
    "differences between loss functions along different directions are certainly much smaller than those between measured and calculated spectra ( section [ expt - res ] ) .",

    "@xcite one thus would also expect that the same applies to the dispersion of the plasmon .",

    "spectra are offset for clarity.,width=264 ]    we have determined the plasmon dispersion by taking the plasmon - peak energy as a function of momentum .",
    "this allows a direct comparison with experimental results , where the identical definition is most frequently used.@xcite the corresponding dependence of the plasmon energy is shown in fig .",
    "[ dispersion_plasmon ] for three high - symmetry directions .",
    "the approximate @xmath74 corrections affect not only the position and the width of the plasmon peak but also its dispersion . while it is parabolic for low momentum transfers , it departs from this behavior for momenta @xmath87 @xmath1 .",
    "for the uniform electron gas , it has been shown to be best described by the dispersion relation @xmath88.@xcite however , there is no good reason why this function should be used for a more complicated plasmon like that of ag .",
    "thus , in this work we choose a different procedure .    in refs .",
    "[ ] the plasmon dispersion was measured , and for momenta smaller than 0.4 @xmath1 was fitted to a parabola of the following form : @xmath89 due to the limited energy resolution and a small number of momentum transfers , the departure from parabolicity may not have been detected in this experiment .",
    "thus , to compare to these data , we have also fitted the results of fig .",
    "[ dispersion_plasmon ] to the above given dispersion relation ( eq .  ) in the same momentum range .",
    "the results of this fit are presented in table [ plasmon - table ] . as mentioned before , the plasmon energy at zero momentum @xmath90 calculated at the gga level , departs significantly from the experimental value , and the agreement is noticeably improved with @xmath74 corrections .",
    "similarly , the dispersion coefficient @xmath91 is found to be @xmath92 in gga ( the error bar here comes from averaging over the three high - symmetry directions ) , a bit higher than the measured value of @xmath93@xcite or @xmath94.@xcite in contrast , the @xmath74 value of @xmath95 agrees very well with the measurements .    we have also performed a fit including momenta @xmath96 @xmath1 only ( table [ plasmon - table ] ) , obtaining coefficients @xmath91 of @xmath97 in the case of gga and @xmath98 for @xmath74 , respectively .",
    "these values could be compared to that of the homogeneous electron gas having the density of @xmath54 electrons in ag .",
    "to do so , requires an additional parameter , the `` optical '' electron mass , which basically yields the fermi level relative to the bottom of the @xmath54 band ( not to be confused with the effective electron mass @xmath99 high above the fermi level ) . using @xmath100 , we obtain @xmath101 for the homogeneous electron gas .",
    "this shows that for very small momenta the plasmon dispersion in ag does not significantly depart from that in the homogeneous electron gas , despite the large difference in the corresponding plasmon energies .",
