    "since the first works dealing with the entanglement shared by pairs of spins on a quantum chain , the translational invariance of the chain ( and its states ) has been exploited to facilitate the analysis of the problem @xcite .",
    "anyway , there is a number of problems which do not possess the property of being translationally invariant : semi - infinite chains , chains with impurities @xcite or , in a more abstract sense , random quantum states @xcite .",
    "these problems have localized quantum states whose properties strongly differ from those of translationally invariant quantum states .",
    "localized quantum states can be used to storage quantum information @xcite an play and important role in the propagation of entanglement through a quantum spin chain @xcite .",
    "this kind of states also appears in some models of quantum computers in presence of static disorder @xcite .    since the localization of a quantum state is a global property it seems natural to study its properties using a global entanglement measure as , for example , the one proposed by meyer and wallach @xcite .",
    "@xcite derived exact expressions for the mean value of the meyer - wallach entanglement for localized random vectors and studied the dependence of this measure with the localization length of the states .",
    "viola and brown @xcite studied the relationship between generalized entanglement and the delocalization of pure quantum states .",
    "of course there are other possibilities to study the relationship between localization of quantum states and entanglement .",
    "the bipartite entanglement and localization of one - particle states in the harper model has been addressed by li _",
    "@xcite , the entanglement entropy at localization transitions is studied in @xcite and the localized entanglement in one - dimensional anderson model in @xcite .    in many proposals of quantum computers",
    "the qubit energies can be often individually controlled , this corresponds to controllable disorder of a spin system .",
    "besides , in these models , the effective spin - spin interaction is usually strongly anisotropic , it varies from the ising coupling in nuclear magnetic resonance and other systems @xcite to the @xmath3-type or the @xmath4-type coupling in some josephson - junction - based systems @xcite . the localization properties of one and two excitation states in the @xmath4 spin chain with a defect was studied with some detail by santos and dykman @xcite , but they did not study the entanglement of the one and two excitation states .",
    "in this paper we are interested in the behavior of the localization and the bipartite entanglement of the pure eigenstates of a quantum chain with one impurity located in one extreme",
    ". it is well know that the presence of one impurity results in the presence of a localized state .",
    "if the strength of the imputity is large enough the energy of the localized state lies outside the band of magnons , also known as one spin excitation states @xcite .",
    "the one spin magnons in a homoeneous chain are extended states @xcite .",
    "as we will show , if the localization of a given state is measured with the inverse participation ratio there are two kinds of localized states , a ) exponentially localized states that lie outside the band of magnons , and b ) localized states that lie inside the band , whose number depends on the length of the chain and the strength of the impurity .",
    "this second kind plays a fundamental role in the transmission of quantum states through the chain . in most quantum state transfer protocols",
    "the state to be transferred is localized at one end of the quantum chain and the transmission is succeful when the time evolution of the system produces an equally localized state at the other end of the chain .",
    "so it seems natural to investigate the time evolution of a localization measure to gain some insight about the problem of quantum state transfer .    as we will show the time evolution of the inverse participation ratio ,",
    "when the initial state consists in a single excitation located in one impurity , allows the identification of scenarios where the transmission of quantum states can be achieved for ( comparatively ) short times and with a very good fidelity . in this sense",
    "we extend some results obtained by wjcik _",
    "@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows , in section ii we present the @xmath0 model describing the quantum spin chain with a impurity . in section iii",
    "we analyze in some detail the spectrum of the one spin excitations and the eigenstates . in section",
    "iv we present the results obtained for the inverse participation ratio for each one spin excitation eigenstate while the bipartite entanglement of the eigenstates is analyzed in section v. finally , in section vi , we discuss the relationship between localization and transmission of quantum states .",
    "we consider a linear chain of @xmath2-qubits with @xmath0 interaction , in an external magnetic field .",
    "the coupling strengths are homogeneous except at one site , the impurity , where the coupling strength is different .",
    "the system is described by the hamiltonian    @xmath5    where @xmath6 are the pauli matrices , @xmath7 is the external field , @xmath8 is the exchange coupling coefficient and @xmath9 is the impurity exchange strength , @xmath10 corresponds to the homogeneous case .    since the hamiltonian commutes with @xmath11 , the hamiltonian @xmath12 has a block structure where each of them is characterized by the number of excited spins in the chain . because we are interested in the transmission of a state with one excited spin from one end of the chain to the other , we focus on the eigen - vectors of the one excitation subspace where the complete dynamics take place . to describe the eigenstates , we choose a basis described by the computational states of this subspace @xmath13 , where @xmath14 given a basis set size equals to the number of spins of the chain .    in this basis , the hamiltonian @xmath15 is represented by a @xmath16 matrix @xmath17",
    "in this section we briefly recall some known results about the spectrum and the eigen - states of the model emphasizing those features that are of interest in the following sections .",
    "the one excitation spectrum consists of @xmath2 eigen - energies denoted by @xmath18 . choosing the total number of spins even , and subtracting a constant that depends on @xmath19 , the spectrum results symmetrical with respect to zero ( @xmath20 is not an eigenvalue ) for any value of @xmath21",

    "the two isolated curves correspond to the minimal eigen - energy @xmath29 ( continuous line ) and the maximal eigen - energy @xmath30 ( dashed line ) . at the critical value @xmath31",
    "the isolated energies go into the band causing a slight distortion on the behaviour of energies inside the band . in this figure",

    "the minimal and the maximal eigen - energy become isolated from the band .",
    "there is a critical value @xmath31 which separates the region of the spectrum where the energies make a band ( @xmath33 ) from the region where the energies make a band with two isolated energies ( @xmath34 ) .",

    "this behavior is depicted in figure [ energias ] .",
    "figure [ energias ] shows that most of the eigen - energies seem to be fairly independent of @xmath21 , except for the minimal and maximal energies .",
    "but a more detailed study of the derivative of the eigen - energies with respect to @xmath21 ( see section v ) , shows two regions where the changes in the spectrum are more noticeable : ( i ) for @xmath39 two eigen - energies become degenerate because the system changes from a chain with @xmath2 coupled spins to a chain with @xmath40 coupled spins and an uncoupled spin that is only affected by the external field ; ii ) for @xmath41 there is a number of avoided crossings between successive eigen - energies , because of the `` collision '' among the minimal ( or maximal ) eigen - energy and the band .",
    "the eigen - states in the one excitation subspace @xmath42 , whose eigen - value equation is @xmath43 can be written as a superposition of the one excitation states @xmath44 where due to the symmetries of the spectrum @xmath45 these coefficients @xmath46 contain information about localization and entanglement properties of the eigen - states and , can be written as @xcite @xmath47    in a homogeneous chain , the eigen - states are wave - like superpositions of the one excitation states where the coefficients of the superpositions are given by ( [ coe - analiticos ] ) with @xmath48 real . in other case ,",

    "we can identify three regions where the behaviour of the @xmath79 is qualitatively different .",
    "these regions are separated by @xmath74 and @xmath31 , where at those values all eigen - states are equally localized .",
    "the first region @xmath81 shows several localized eigen - states corresponding to energies close to zero , i.e. the center of the band .",
    "calling @xmath82 the value of @xmath21 such that @xmath83 attains its minimum , the numerical results show that @xmath84 where @xmath85 , _",
    "i.e. _ the eigen - state is more localized as it is closer to @xmath20 . besides , the number of localized states increase with @xmath2 .    in the second region @xmath86",
    "the eigen - states with energies close to the border of the band become more extended acquiring a ipr maximum near to @xmath31 .",
    "these peaks become sharper when @xmath2 grows . at @xmath31 ,",
    "these eigen - states are again equally localized , but for values of @xmath21 larger than @xmath31 , but very close to this value , the eigen - states become more localized .",
    "the size of the interval around @xmath31 in which this critical behavior can be observed depends on the size of the chain .",
    "this localization changes seem to be related to the avoided crossings in the spectrum previously described .    in the last region @xmath34 there are only two eigen - states highly localized that correspond to the minimal and maximal eigen - energies , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the other states are extended through @xmath40 sites of the chain .",
    "we want to stress that the ipr gives a coarse description of the eigenstates , for example the states in figure [ two - states ] , despite of their very different behavior , are equally localized if the measure of localization is the ipr , effectively @xmath87 for both states .",
    "this indicates that the ipr can not distinguish the exponentially localized state from the state with a wave - like superposition extended over the chain if the latter has its coefficient @xmath88 large enough .",
    "this shows that the ipr is a good tool to quantify changes in the system due to the introduction of a impurity spin , however it does not give information about where the eigen - state is localized .",
    "moreover , it does not distinguish between quite different states as those described in figure [ two - states ] .",
    "studying the coefficients of the eigen - states , we can observe where they are localized . in the present case they are mainly localized on the impurity site ( see figure [ two - states ] ) .",
    "however , since we are interested in the transmission of initially localized quantum states , and that a successful transmission results in another localized state , the ipr could provide an easy way to identify when the transmission has taken place .    since the ipr does not distinguish between the exponentially localized states that lie outside the band of magnons and the localized states inside the band it is neccessary to study both kinds of states using a local quantity . in the next section we study the entanglement between the impurity site and its first neighbor ,",
    "this will allow us to classify the different eigen - states accordingly with its entanglement content .",
    "the bipartite entanglement between two qubits can be calculated using the concurrence @xcite .",
    "the concurrence of two qubits in an arbitrary state characterized by the density matrix @xmath89 is given by    @xmath90    where the @xmath91 are the square roots of the eigenvalues , in decreasing order , of the non - hermitian matrix @xmath92 .",
    "the spin - flipped state @xmath93 is defined as @xmath94 were @xmath95 is the complex conjugate of @xmath89 and it is taken in the computational basis @xmath96 , @xmath97 , corresponding to the eigen - state @xmath42 is given by    @xmath98    where the trace is taken over the remaining @xmath99 spins leading to a @xmath100 matrix .",
    "the structure of the reduced density matrix follows from the symmetry properties of the hamiltonian .",
    "thus , in our case the concurrence @xmath101 depends on @xmath62 and @xmath102 , _ i.e. _ the indexes of the sites where the spin pair lies .",
    "note that in the translationally invariant case @xmath101 depends only on @xmath103 . in what follows @xmath104 .    using the definition @xmath105",
    ", we can express all the matrix elements of the density matrix @xmath106 in terms of different spin - spin correlation functions .",
    "in particular , for nearest neighbors spins and the eigen - state @xmath67 , we get    @xmath107    where @xmath108    @xmath109    @xmath110    @xmath111 is the @xmath112 identity matrix , @xmath113 , and @xmath114 thus , the concurrence results to be @xmath115 for the set of eigen - states that we are considering , the expression for the concurrence can be further simplified . after some algebra",
    "we get @xmath116 and that @xmath117    so , we get that @xmath118    using the hellmann - feynman theorem , and the symmetry properties of the hamiltonian , we find that @xmath119 from the expression for the reduced density matrix @xmath120 , ( [ mat - red ] ) , it is clear that when @xmath121 the reduced density matrix is diagonal and the bipartite entanglement is zero . moreover , from ( [ no - diagonal ] ) , when @xmath122 we have that @xmath123 .",
    "so , the concurrence for the first two spins in the eigen - state @xmath67 is given by @xmath124    we are interested in the relationship between localization and entanglement for the whole one spin excitation spectrum .",
    "in particular , we want to show that the bipartite entanglement of a given eigenstate , which is a local quantity , between the impurity site and its first neighbor detects the type of localization that the eigenstate possess .",
    "first , we proceed to analyze the concurrence of the minimal eigen - energy state , @xmath125 as a function of @xmath21 , the behaviour of this quantity is shown in figure [ concurrence01 ] . at first sight , it is clear that @xmath125 is different from zero where @xmath126 ( see figure [ ipr1 ] ) is noticeable , and that @xmath127 when the eigenvalue enters into the band and , consequently , the eigenstate becomes extended .",
    "so , when the minimal eigen - energy state is extended for @xmath77 , the two first spins are disentangled and @xmath128 consistently with @xmath129 from ( [ c12-energia - coe ] ) . at the critical point @xmath31 ,",
    "the state starts to become localized increasing its degree of localization when @xmath36 ; in the same way , the pair of spins starts to became entangled and almost disentangled from the rest of the chain , i.e. @xmath130 .",
    "actually , the data shown in figure [ concurrence01 ] corresponds too to @xmath131 , this can be seen by the following argument .",

    "it is measured by the concurrence @xmath125 as a function of @xmath21 .",
    "when the state is localized , @xmath34 , spins 1 and 2 are also entangled . before the critical point(@xmath132 ) when the state is extended , @xmath128 consistently with @xmath129 for @xmath132 .",

    "( [ psi - simetricos-1 ] ) and ( [ c12-energia - coe ] ) , it is straightforward to demonstrate the latter affirmation where @xmath136 since @xmath137    following with the analysis of the entanglement between the first two spin in the chain , we calculate the concurrence of the states with energies inside the bands . figure  [ concurrence03 ] shows @xmath138 as a function of @xmath21 for @xmath139 .",
    "note that the same scenario is observed for @xmath138 with @xmath140 .",

    "the results were obtained for a chain of @xmath73 spins .",

    "the inset shows the concurrence @xmath141 for @xmath146,width=302 ]    from figure [ concurrence03 ] , and calling @xmath147 the abscissa where @xmath148 has its maximum , we observe that @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "this observation suggests that the ordering of the maxima of the concurrence @xmath133 for the different eigenstates follows closely the ordering dictated by the amount of localization of these eigenstates , _",
    "i.e _ only the most localized states around the impurity site has a noticeable entanglement .",
    "we will use this observation as a guide to formulate a transmission protocol in the next section .",
    "as we have shown , the concurrence and the derivative of the energy are related in a simple way , see ( [ c12-energia - coe ] ) . on the other hand",
    "it is well known that the eigenvalues @xmath151 inside the band are rather insensitive to changes in @xmath21 , indeed @xmath152 almost everywhere , _ except _ near an avoided crossing with other eigenvalue . in this sense , the behaviour shown by the concurrence in figure  [ concurrence03 ] reflects the presence of successive avoided crossings between @xmath153 and @xmath154 , between @xmath154 and @xmath155 , and so on .",
    "the abscissa of the peak in the concurrence of a given eigenstate roughly corresponds to the point where the eigenvalue becomes almost degenerate .    as a matter of fact ,",

    "we will exploit the information provided by the ipr : for large enough values of @xmath21 there is a time of order @xmath185 such that @xmath75 .",
    "the fidelity of transmission versus the strength of the impurities and time .",
    "the fidelity presents a peak near @xmath186 and @xmath187 for @xmath188 . in this peak",
    "the fidelity is rather big.,width=453 ]    the identification of regimes where the transmission of quantum states can be achieved with large fidelity and for ( relatively ) short times is of great importance .",
    "the different dynamical regimes of the fidelity in a chain with two impurities is rather difficul to analyze except when @xmath189 , see @xcite .",
    "figure  [ landscape ] shows the complex landscape of the fidelity of transmission versus the strength of the impurities and time .",
    "some of the features shown by the fidelity in figure  [ landscape ] are best understood using the ipr .",
    "in particular , for @xmath21 fixed , the first maximum of the fidelity as a function of the time coincides with a minimum of @xmath79 .",
    "this observation , once systematized , provides the dynamical regime where the transmission can be achieved with large fidelity and _ always _ for times @xmath1 .",
    "our results about the time behaviour of the ipr show that for @xmath190 there is always a local minimum of the ipr ( see figure  [ ipr - vs - t ] b ) ) .",
    "since the state that is being transferred is well localized it is rather clear that we should look for times when the ipr attain local minima to identify where it is possible to achive a good transmission .",
    "the time @xmath191 is rather independent of @xmath21 .",
    "so , optimizing the value of @xmath21 in order to minimize the value of the minimum of the ipr at times @xmath192 allow us to find the best fidelity achievable for time @xmath193 .",
    "we call @xmath194 the value such that the the fidelity @xmath195 attains its maximum for a given @xmath2 and for @xmath196 .",
    "as figure  [ con - and - fidel ] shows , when the transfer of a given state takes place the fidelity presents a well defined maximum at time @xmath197 .",
    "the height of the maximum , @xmath198 is a smooth function of @xmath21 for @xmath199 , and the same is valid for the transfer time @xmath200 .     the data shown in the upper panel corresponds to the maximum fidelity of transmission achievable for times @xmath201 for different chain lengths @xmath2 ( squares ) , @xmath194 ( triangles ) and the concurrence @xmath180(diamonds ) .",
    "the protocol of transmission is described in the text .",
    ", width=415 ]    figure  [ transfer - all ] summarizes our findings about the fidelity of transmission following the recipe outlined in the two paragraphs above .",
    "the upper panel shows the maximum transmission fidelity achievable for a chain of length @xmath2 and the corresponding optimum value of @xmath21 . as can be appreciated @xmath202 even for @xmath203 .",
    "the maximum value of the fidelity is also well above the predicted for an unmodulated chain and above @xmath204 that is the highest fidelity for classical transmission of a quantum state .",
    "the lower panel shows the transmission time @xmath200 _ vs _ @xmath2 .",
    "the linear scaling of @xmath200 with @xmath2 is rather clear .",
    "it is clear that for an isolated chain the availability of a regime where @xmath205 , regardless of the time required to achieve the transfer , is interesting .",
    "however , in the presence of dynamical disorder or an `` environment '' , achieving a moderate fidelity for the transfer at shorter times seems a better option .",
    "there is enough evidence to affirm that the entanglement of quantum states whose eigen - energies present avoided crossings will show steep changes near of them ( @xcite,@xcite , this work ) . in our case",
    "there is a number of avoided crossings that appears between succesive levels , when @xmath29 comes into the band as @xmath21 decreases from values larger than the critical .",
    "the avoided crossing between @xmath29 and @xmath206 is nearer to @xmath31 than the avoided crossing between @xmath206 and @xmath207 , and so on . this is the behavior depicted in figure ( [ concurrence03 ] ) .",
    "the width of the peak in @xmath133 of a given state ( see figure ( [ concurrence03 ] ) ) is related to the magnitude of the derivative of the eigen - energy of the state , the peak is sharper for @xmath208 and the succesive peaks are more and more rounded .",
    "as we have shown , locating impurities at both extremes of the chain allows to transfer more entanglement that an unmodulated chain _",
    "if both impurities produce a number of localized eigen - states at each end of the chain_. it could be interesting to compare the results presented in this work with the findings of plastina and apollaro ( @xcite ) in the case of two _ diagonal _ impurities .",
    "while ipr is an appealing quantity since it is very easy to calculate , we have shown that it is not possible to guess how much entanglement has a given state .",
    "the examples analyzed show that based on the ipr it is not possible to guess from it how much entanglement has a given state , anyway it remains an appealing quantity since it could be useful to identify dynamical regimes where the transmission of quantum states can be achieved .",
    "the example presented above , in which the tunning of the interaction between only a couple of spins improves the transmission , is encouraging . of course the protocols for perfect transmission perform this task better , but at the cost of modulating all the interactions between the spins .",
    "there is not , to our knowledge , a simple quantity that allows to relate , in a direct way , localization and entanglement .",
    "this subject will be object of further investigation .",
