    "then the scattering zipper operator acting on @xmath6 is defined as @xmath7 where the two unitaries @xmath8 and @xmath9 are given by @xmath10 the main hypothesis on each of the scattering matrices @xmath2 is that its upper right entry of size @xmath11 is invertible . in the notation of section  [ sec - prel ] below ,",
    "@xmath2 is in a subset @xmath12 of the unitary group .",
    "this condition assures that the scattering is effective so that @xmath13 does not decouple into a direct sum of two or more parts .",
    "the terminology _ scattering zipper _ is best understood by looking at figure  1 illustrating the model .",
    "it shows the first scattering events of a semi - infinite model @xmath14 for which we also drop the indices on @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "it is also possible to consider periodic scattering zippers , see section  [ sec - periodic ] below for finite operators and section  [ sec - periodic - infinite ] for infinite ones .",
    "furthermore , by placing either of the boundary conditions @xmath18 and @xmath19 into @xmath8 , one can consider the case of odd @xmath5 , but we refrain from doing so .     and @xmath20 satisfy @xmath21 , which is equivalent to @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the picture corresponds to proposition  [ prop - solutions ] below .",
    "the boundary conditions @xmath24 and @xmath25 as well as @xmath26 can be introduced for convenience , but one can also just keep @xmath18 , _ c.f . _",
    "section  [ sec - transfer ] .",
    "the main message of this paper is that scattering zippers are the unitary analogs of jacobi matrices with matrix entries . here",
    "are the structural results supporting this claim :    * the matrix @xmath13 is not tridiagonal , but five - diagonal .",
    "nevertheless , solutions of the associated eigenvalue equation can be calculated by transfer matrices having the same symmetries as in the jacobi case , but no further restrictions ( see section  [ sec - transfer ] ) . *",
    "the matrix element of the resolvent of @xmath13 corresponding to the left boundary site @xmath27 has a simple expression in terms of the entries of the transfer matrix , namely it is given by a mbius transformation of the other boundary condition ( theorem  [ theo - green ] ) .",
    "* these matrix elements of the resolvent lie on a weyl surface which is a matrix ball ( theorems  [ theo - weyl1 ] and [ theo - weylsurf ] ) .",
    "* all semi - infinite scattering zipper operators @xmath15 with fixed boundary condition @xmath18 are in the limit point case .",
    "fixing an appropriate gauge for each @xmath2 , the semi - infinite scattering zipper operators are in bijection with their spectral measures which are all matrix - valued probability measures on the unit circle ( theorem  [ theo - bijection ] ) . *",
    "the eigenvalues of the finite scattering zipper operators can be calculated using matrix prfer phases by sturm - liouville type oscillation theory ( theorems  [ theo - oscillation ] and [ theo - osci2 ] ) .",
    "this is also an efficient tool to calculate the spectrum of infinite periodic scattering zippers ( theorem  [ theo - oscillationper ] ) .    for jacobi matrices with matrix entries",
    ", it is well - known how to use transfer matrices , and how to calculate the resolvents ( _ e.g. _ @xcite , but this is classical ) .",
    "weyl surfaces are also known for jacobi matrices ( see @xcite which also contains earlier references ) .",
    "the reason why there is a simple bijection in theorem  [ theo - bijection ] is that all semi - infinite scattering zipper operators are in the weyl limit point case , namely the weyl surfaces shrink to one point in the large @xmath5 limit .",
    "this is in strong contrast with jacobi matrices where there are limit discs which lead to all the issues related to the moment problem ( see _ e.g. _ the beautiful paper by simon @xcite ) , nevertheless there are close connections between probability measures on the real line and jacobi matrices .",
    "finally , oscillation theory of jacobi matrices with matrix entries was developed in @xcite , but again the scalar case is well - known .",
    "now let us present our personal and without doubt very restricted view on connections of this work to the literature .",
    "first of all , the scattering zipper itself is a generalization of three well - known models , the blatter - browne model @xcite and the chalker - coddington network model @xcite of the solid state physics community as well as the cmv matrices @xcite of the mathematical literature .",
    "the blatter - browne model is scalar , namely @xmath28 . in the chalker - coddington model , the aim is to model a higher dimensional lattice of scattering events . in terms of the scattering zipper",
    "this means that there is supplementary structure in each of the scattering matrices @xmath2 and that they are infinite - dimensional and very sparsely filled .",
    "motivated by applications to the quantum hall transitions , the main focus in the chalker - coddington model has been on random scattering events .",
    "first rigorous works on the analysis of the blatter - brown model and the chalker - coddington model on a strip have appeared @xcite . on the other hand , the cmv matrices in its matricial version",
    "@xcite only consider scattering blocks of the type @xmath29 where the @xmath30 verify @xmath31 which is equivalent to @xmath32 ( here and below we always use the operator norm ) .",
    "these @xmath30 are called the verblunsky coefficients @xcite .",
    "there is a huge literature on cmv matrices ( see @xcite for a long list of references ) .",
    "they form a subclass of the scattering zipper models considered here . of course",
    ", the transfer matrix techniques also apply and have very efficiently been used in most works on the subject . however , the weyl discs at finite @xmath5 as presented below seem to have been studied only in the scalar case @xcite . nevertheless , it was possible to prove in @xcite that every sequence of verblunsky coefficients corresponds to a unique matrix - valued measure on the unit circle ( verblunsky s theorem ) .",
    "theorem  [ theo - bijection ] extends this theorem in that it exhibits a bijection between all probability measures on the unit circle and the semi - infinite scattering zippers with fixed boundary condition @xmath18 .",
    "finally , it seems that oscillation theory for cmv matrices was only developed in the scalar case @xmath28 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 8.3.3 . ) .",
    "* acknowlegements : * h.  s .- b . wants to thank mihai stoiciu for introducing him to the world of cmv matrices and for a number of discussions about oscillation theory at a very early stage of this work .",
    "he also let us know about the reference @xcite .",
    "we also acknowlege financial support of the dfg .",
    "as explained in the introduction , the following subset of the even - dimensional unitary group will play a role : @xmath33    in , equivalent to the condition that @xmath34 is invertible is either the invertibility of @xmath35 or the condition @xmath36 or the condition @xmath37 .",

    "_ ]    let us conclude this section with a few comments .",
    "first of all , one readily checks @xmath68 comparing with , one way to characterize cmv matrices is therefore to say that its individual scattering events give rise to self - adjoint transfer matrices . of course",
    ", this does not imply that products of such transfer matrices have the same property .",
    "this means that cmv matrices are not specified by some symmetry given by a combination of time - reversal , particle - hole or sublattice symmetry , and it is not clear to us whether there is a deeper reason to consider scattering events of the type @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "it is possible to implement all the above symmetries also in scattering zippers , just as for jacobi matrices with matrix entries ( see @xcite where only even and odd time - reversal symmetry is dealt with ) . finally , let us briefly discuss degenerate scattering events which do nt mix all incoming and outgoing amplitudes .",
    "there are many possibilities to do this , but only two are relevant for the boundary conditions in the next section . in one",
    "@xmath66 only depends on @xmath65 ( left and right in figure  1(i ) decoupled ) , in the other only on @xmath64 ( top and bottom in figure  1(i ) decoupled ) .",
    "let us focus on the latter .",
    "then there are two unitaries @xmath18 and @xmath19 such that @xmath69 and @xmath70 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath71 and @xmath72 are given by @xmath73",
    "in this section , the formal solutions @xmath74 for the eigenvalue equation @xmath21 at @xmath75 will be constructed . here",
    "all the @xmath76 are @xmath11 matrices and the index @xmath77 runs to infinity and it is formal in the sense that @xmath78 is typically not square integrable .",
    "the construction of @xmath78 is done such that the left boundary condition ( at site @xmath27 ) is satisfied . for finite @xmath5",
    ", the solution @xmath78 in general does not satisfy the right boundary condition , namely @xmath79 .",
