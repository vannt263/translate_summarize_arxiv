    "electromagnetic forces usually just add to a complex exchange interaction scenario , they play a major role in arrays of interacting magnetic nanoparticles and lithographically produced nanostructures , like nanodots and nanopillars . in such systems geometrical frustration and disorder lead to interesting and exotic low temperature effects , e.  g.  artificial spin ice @xcite , and superspin glass behavior @xcite .",
    "moreover , the dynamic behavior of interacting magnetic nanostructures is a subject of considerable current investigation .",
    "these systems are promising candidates for future applications beyond magnetic data - storage , e.  g.  , as low - power logical devices @xcite .",
    "theoretically , these systems can often be described as interacting point dipoles .",
    "this is justified if the considered nanostructures form single domain magnets and are spatially well separated from each other so that exchange interactions do not play an important role .",
    "+ a different realization of systems of interacting dipoles is given by @xmath1 , nitrogen atoms encapsulated in fullerene cages @xcite .",
    "such fullerene array structures have been proposed as an alternative concept for a scalable spin quantum computer @xcite .",
    "the basic building block of all extended interacting dipole systems represents a pair of interacting magnetic dipoles with fixed position .",
    "this system has been shown @xcite to be completely integrable due to the existence of two conserved quantities , namely the energy @xmath2 and the component @xmath3 of the total magnetic moment @xmath4 into the direction @xmath5 joining the two dipoles .",
    "the two ground states of the dipole pair are those where both moment vectors are parallel to @xmath5 or to @xmath6 and thus ferromagnetic in character",
    ". larger systems of magnetic dipoles will no longer be integrable and it will be , in general , difficult to determine their ground states because of geometric frustration .",
    "however , for special geometries the ground states may be found , see , e.  g.  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider _ discrete dipole rings _",
    ", i.  e.  , systems where the dipoles are located at the vertices of a regular polygon , see section [ sec : r ] , and , as a limit case , the infinite dipole chain . for the latter no frustration occurs and the two ferromagnetic ground states are obvious . for dipole rings numerical evidence",

    "it is then a straightforward task to linearize the equation of motion ( eom ) just above the ground state energy and to solve it , see section [ sec : l ] . due to the @xmath8 symmetry of the dipole ring",

    "it shows not only infinitesimal spin waves in the sense sketched above but also finite amplitude spin waves with a dispersion relation @xcite @xmath13 the dipole ring is more complicated in two respects : the interaction is ( 1 ) anisotropic in dependence of the direction @xmath14 joining any two dipoles and ( 2 ) of long range .",
    "thus the question arises whether also for dipole rings finite amplitude spin waves exist .",
    "the solutions to the linearized eom described above can be re - translated into approximate finite amplitude solutions via some inverse projection .",

    "the _ ground states _ of the system are spin configurations that assume the global minimum of the energy ( [ r4 ] ) .",
