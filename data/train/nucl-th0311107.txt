    "experimental data for both @xmath5 and @xmath8 are available for a variety of energy and momentum transfers .",
    "however because of our non  relativistic treatment of the nuclear dynamics we restrict our attention to momentum transfers @xmath11 500 mev / c and energy transfers @xmath12 300 mev",

    "et al _ @xcite , dow _ et al _ @xcite , marchand _ et al _ @xcite , and morgenstern @xcite .",
    "the theoretical treatment of these response functions requires the ability to accurately include transitions to the continuum .",
    "techniques for doing this with realistic nn potentials have only been developed and implemented during the past ten years .",
    "these include both faddeev and lorentz integral transform ( lit ) methods @xcite .",
    "for the 3n photodisintegration total cross sections results obtained with the lit @xcite and faddeev techniques are compared in @xcite . in the work of viviani _",
    "et al _ @xcite expansion techniques were applied to solving the ground state and continuum wave equations , but the calculation was restricted to a @xmath6he near threshold region where only the two  body breakup occurs .",
    "previous to the above references faddeev calculations of trinucleon response functions were published by meijgaard and tjon @xcite in 1992 using the s - wave malfliet ",

    "i / iii @xcite .",
    "apart from how the quantum mechanics is done there are major differences in physics input between the longitudinal and transverse responses .",
    "whereas the non  relativistic longitudinal response requires only a charge operator and nucleon form factors , the transverse response requires exchange currents in addition to single nucleon currents and nucleon form factors .",
    "it is clear that if a given nuclear interaction can not describe the longitudinal response then it would be pointless to attempt a calculation of the transverse reponse . in particular",
    "if one inquires into the effect of three  body forces in nuclei it would appear natural to first investigate their impact on the longitudinal response .",
    "otherwise , through a calculation of @xmath8 , it would be difficult to disentangle the effects of three  body forces from exchange current effects .",
    "further as shown in @xcite the longitudinal response appears in general insensitive to the realistic nn force model thus removing a possible source of ambiguity when comparing the effects of different three body force models on @xmath0 .",
    "the function @xmath5 represents the response of the nucleus through the nuclear charge operator @xmath13 and is given by @xmath14 here @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote the ground and final states , respectively , while @xmath17 and @xmath18 are energies pertaining to them , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the nuclear non  relativistic hamiltonian .",
    "the above quantities @xmath21 and @xmath20 are internal quantities in the hadronic c.m . frame .",
    "the integration ( summation ) goes over all final states belonging to the same energy @xmath18 , and @xmath22 is the projection of the ground state angular momentum .",
    "the hamiltonian includes the kinetic energy terms , the nn and 3n force terms , and the proton coulomb interaction term in the @xmath6he case .",
    "the ground state @xmath15 is calculated via an expansion in basis functions which are correlated sums of products of hyperradial functions , hyperspherical harmonics and spin  isospin functions . in the present work",
    "three models of the nn force are used , the realistic av18 @xcite and configuration space bonna ( herein referred to as bonnra ) @xcite models , and the s - wave mt ",
    "i / iii potential .",
    "we consider two 3n force models , the urbix @xcite and the tm@xmath23 @xcite , in the combinations av18+urbix , av18+tm@xmath23 ( @xmath24=3.358 @xmath25 ) , and bonnra+tm@xmath23 ( @xmath24=2.835 @xmath25 ) .",
    "as indicated the tm@xmath23 cut - off parameter @xmath24 is different in the av18 and bonnra combinations in order to properly fix the @xmath6h binding energy in each case .",
    "table i lists our results for ground state properties for the above potential combinations containing the 3n force .    as nuclear charge operator",
    "we take the following one  body operator @xmath26 where @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29,\\label{e}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath30 here @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 are the nucleon position , momentum , spin and isospin operators , @xmath35 is the nucleon mass , and @xmath36 are the nucleon sachs form factors .",
    "the two terms in ( [ rc ] ) proportional to @xmath37 are the darwin  foldy ( df ) and spin  orbit ( so ) relativistic corrections to the main operator ( [ nr ] ) , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "we refer to the main operator ( [ nr ] ) as the non ",
    "relativistic one although the dependence of nucleon form factors on @xmath38 does not allow a non  relativistic interpretation .    in this work",
    "we mainly use the well known dipole fit for proton electric form factor , while the neutron electric form factor is taken from @xcite , but we also check the @xmath5 dependence with a different parametrization , namely the best fit from @xcite to these form factors . in case of the so term",
    "we adopt the usual although recently controversial @xcite approximation @xmath39 in ( [ m ] ) , @xmath40 being proton and neutron magnetic momenta . for the calculation of @xmath5",
    "it is convenient to rewrite the operator @xmath13 in terms of the isoscalar and isovector charge nucleon form factors from ( [ e ] ) , @xmath41    the inclusion of relativistic corrections for the one  body charge operator only is not completely consistent .",
    "in fact there exist additional relativistic effects : a wave function boost ( as done in @xcite for the @xmath42 reaction ) and additional two - body terms in the charge operator ( as done in @xcite for the low - energy two - body break - up channel of the @xmath6he@xmath43 reaction ) . in our case",
    "there are two reasons why we include the relativistic corrections to the one - body charge operator :    \\(i ) at higher @xmath1 they lead to an important reduction of the @xmath5 quasi - elastic peak height . as illustrated in @xcite such a reduction",
    "is confirmed if boost corrections are included .",
    "moreover , the frame dependence of the response functions is studied in @xcite where it is shown that in the breit frame boost corrections are negligibly small for the quasi - elastic peak region ( different kinematics are not shown ) .",
    "we believe that one has a similar frame dependence of boost corrections also for the electromagnetic response of the three - nucleon systems .",
    "thus we will make the comparison with experimental data taking @xmath5 from a breit frame calculation with a subsequent transformation into the @xmath5 lab frame result ( see discussion of fig .",
    "\\(ii ) they enable us to make a direct comparison of our results with those of @xcite . since realistic few  body calculations are rather complicated it is of great importance to have these kind of checks .",
    "we calculate @xmath5(@xmath44 ) by the lit method as described in @xcite .",
    "the technique is , however , directly applicable only when the transition operator does not depend on @xmath4 . to separate out the @xmath4 dependence of the transition operator we use eq .",
    "( [ rsv ] ) to represent the response function ( [ rl ] ) as @xmath45 ^ 2\\,{\\cal r}_{s}+ g_e^s(q_\\mu^2 ) g_e^v(q_\\mu^2 ) { \\cal r}_{sv}+",

    "\\label{mr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to calculate the subsidiary responses entering ( [ sep ] ) with the lit method one can solve the inhomogeneous equations @xmath52 for a set of complex @xmath53 values and then form the scalar products @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 .",
    "these scalar products represent integral transform with lorentzian kernels , e.g. , one has @xmath57 here @xmath58 is the elastic scattering form factor , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 is the threshold for the inelastic energy transfer . from the inversion of such integral transforms one",
    "then obtains the response functions @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath50 .    in previous work @xcite equations similar to those in ( [ eqs ] ) were solved numerically in order to calculate the above mentioned scalar products @xmath61 .",
    "an alternative and computationally more efficient way of the calculation of the transform is a direct evaluation of the scalar products via the lanczos technique @xcite .",
    "thus we use this method in our calculation .    as for @xmath15",
    "we perform expansions in terms of basis functions @xmath62 which are correlated sums of products of hyperradial functions , hyperspherical harmonics and spin  isospin functions .",
    "the first lanczos vector is given by @xmath63 with @xmath64 where @xmath65 denotes the inverse of the norm matrix @xmath66 .",
    "one then applies recursively the following relations @xmath67 @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the lanczos coefficients .",
    "the transform can then be written as a continuous fraction    @xmath71    with @xmath72 .",
    "basis functions posess definite values of parity @xmath73 , angular momenta @xmath74 and magnetic quantum numbers @xmath75 .",
    "various lanczos sets are separated with respect to these quantum numbers .",
    "multipole expansions of the operators @xmath76 and @xmath77 are performed , which allows elimination of dependencies on @xmath75 and on the ground ",
    "state angular momentum projection @xmath22 . in our case",
    "there exists only one multipole @xmath78 compatible with a given @xmath74 and @xmath73 value .",
    "indeed , one has @xmath79 , and parity equal to @xmath80 .",
    "hyperspherical harmonics ( hh ) belonging to given permutational symmetry types are obtained via application of the corresponding symmetrization operators to hh of the type @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the grand  angular momentum , @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the total orbital momentum and its projection , and @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the orbital momenta associated with a relative motion of a given pair of particles and a relative motion of the third particle with respect to the pair . these basis hh are coupled to the spin  isospin functions of conjugated permutational symmetry types to get basis functions antisymmetric with respect to permutations of nucleons .",
    "these spin  isospin functions posess given spin @xmath87 and isospin @xmath88 .",
    "thus our basis functions have given @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 values , given parity equal to @xmath89 , and given type of symmetry with respect to permutations of spatial , or spin  isospin , variables . in order to accelerate the convergence of the hh expansion a spin and isospin dependent correlation operator",
    "is applied to the basis functions ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "matrix elements are calculated analytically with respect to three euler angles determining the orientation of the system as a whole , and the remaining three ",
    "dimensional integrations are done numerically .",
    "rather many basis functions are retained to achieve convergence , and a selection of basis hh has been done to reduce their net numbers in the calculation .",
    "the selection is based upon the property @xcite that the uncorrelated symmetrized basis hh obtained in the above mentioned way from the subset of hh @xmath81 with only small @xmath85 and small @xmath86 suffice to provide a predominant contribution to bound state wave functions .",
    "we have found that in practice this property is also valid for our correlated hh and for the case of our inhomogeneous equations . at the same time , the selection depended on @xmath83 , @xmath82 , @xmath74 values and symmetry types of hh as well .",
    "the mixed response ( [ mr ] ) is calculated as @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the response , which emerges from the scalar product @xmath92 , and @xmath93 is obtained if @xmath94 , instead of @xmath76 or @xmath77 , is taken as the transition operator in ( [ eqs ] ) .",
    "before showing detailed results of our calculations it is necessary to address the question of convergence with respect to the maximum angular momentum @xmath95 retained in our calculation .",
    "this requires some measure of convergence . in this connection",
    "we consider here the @xmath6h coulomb sum rule results computed for the case @xmath96 .",
    "the sum rule reads in this case @xmath97 since in the case considered a single proton interacts with the electromagnetic field , eq .",
    "( [ sr ] ) does not contain the nucleon charge correlation contribution and is valid for any @xmath1 .",
    "it is clear that larger @xmath1 values require the expansion to include larger values of @xmath74 .",
    "table ii shows the results of using @xmath95 = 15/2 for the @xmath1= 250 , and 300 mev / c cases and @xmath95=21/2 for the @xmath1=350 - 500 mev / c cases .",
    "one notes that the lower @xmath1 sum rules are nearly fully converged while the 500 mev / c case still requires about 2% more strength .",
    "although this could be improved by increasing @xmath95 we consider the convergence tolerable for the present investigation .",
    "table ii also demonstrates that the convergence is faster for the simple mt  i / iii potential as compared to the realistic potential models .    in fig .",
    "1 we illustrate the dependence of @xmath5 on the nn potential .",
    "the results with the two realistic potentials , bonn and av18 , are very similar at @xmath98 mev / c , but exhibit somewhat stronger differences for the quasi ",
    "elastic peak height at @xmath99 mev / c . with the semi  realistic mt ",
    "i / iii potential one observes a rather similar picture for @xmath99 mev / c as with the realistic potentials , whereas at @xmath98 mev / c a greater peak height and considerably less high  energy strength than for the realistic potentials is found .    in fig .",
    "2 we show the 3n force effect . it is seen that it decreases the peak height and enhances the high  energy tail . at lower momentum",
    "transfer the reduction of the peak height is more pronounced . comparing the three cases , where a 3n force is included , one finds only rather small differences among them except for the low  energy range at @xmath98 mev / c as will be seen next in fig .",
    "3 .    in order to study the low  energy behavior better , in fig .",
    "3 we illustrate the nuclear force model dependence of the triton @xmath5 close to threshold at three momentum transfers covered also by the data of @xcite . in this figure @xmath5",
    "is shown as a function of @xmath100 , the relative kinetic energy of the outgoing three nucleons . at @xmath101",
    "mev / c there is a rather strong decrease of @xmath5 due to the 3n force .",
    "the reduction becomes considerably smaller at @xmath102 mev / c and at @xmath103 mev / c the 3n force leads to an opposite effect , namely a moderate increase . from the comparison of the cases av18+urbix and av18+tm@xmath104",
    "it becomes clear that the 3n force model dependence is for all the three momentum transfers very small . the only evident potential model dependence is found at the highest @xmath1 , where the case bonnra+tm@xmath104 exhibits considerably more strength than the other cases with inclusion of 3n force .    in fig .",
    "4 we show the effect of the relativistic corrections on @xmath5 .",
    "one sees that the so term leads only to rather small contributions , while the df term is more important .",
    "it occurs that separate contributions from the so term are not so small , only their net sum proves to be very small .",
    "this probably means that in the inclusive case we have an effect of averaging out due to the spin dependence of the so operator . because of the smallness of the so contribution we have neglected it in most of the following cases . in fig .",
    "4 we also show @xmath5 results , where a different nucleon form factor parametrization @xcite is taken . at @xmath99 mev",
    "/ c the different form factors lead to very similar results , but at @xmath98 mev / c there is a 3 % reduction of @xmath5 with the parametrization of @xcite . in the results which follow",
    "we will always use the dipole nucleon form factors .",
    "however as seen here there will be uncertainties in @xmath5 at higher @xmath1 values due to uncertainties in the nucleon form factors .",
    "next we would like to check the frame dependence of our calculation .",
    "to this end we calculate @xmath5 also in the breit ( b ) frame and the socalled anti  lab ( al ) frame . in the al frame the virtual photon and initial target nucleus",
    "have momenta @xmath105 and @xmath106 , respectively , whereas the total momentum of the final three  nucleon state is equal to zero . note",
    "that in the lab frame one has the opposite case : the target nucleus in the initial state is at rest and the total momentum of the final three - nucleon state is equal to @xmath107 .",
    "finally , in the breit frame one has total momenta of initial and final hadron states equal to @xmath108 and @xmath109 , respectively , while the photon four - momentum is @xmath110 .",
    "formally there are no differences between the calculations in the various frames .",
    "one obtains a response function which has the arguments @xmath4 and @xmath1 of the given frame , i.e. @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 . for a comparison of the results we transform @xmath112 and @xmath113 into @xmath114 and @xmath115 , respectively . to this end",
    "we use that the various reference frames are connected via lorentz boosts and thus @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 can be expressed through @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "however in order to obtain an @xmath5 in the lab frame from @xmath5 s in al and breit frames it is not sufficient to transform the relative arguments of @xmath4 and @xmath1 into the corresponding lab frame arguments .",
    "in addition one has @xmath122 where `` @xmath123 '' stands for al or breit .",
    "the origin of the additional factor is the following .",
    "the cross section of ( 1 ) contains three separate pieces , namely @xmath124 , a part regarding the electron ( e.g. , @xmath125 ) and a hadronic part ( e.g. , @xmath5 ) .",
    "the latter two originate from a reduction of a product of leptonic and hadronic lorentz tensors @xcite .",
    "the product of these two tensors forms a lorentz scalar and thus is frame independent .",
    "one can show that for the longitudinal part of the cross section of ( 1 ) one has @xcite @xmath126 and thus lorentz invariance requires the additional factor in ( [ frame ] ) .    in fig .",
    "5 we compare the longitudinal response functions of the various frames . at @xmath1=250 mev / c differences",
    "are rather small , in particular between breit and al frame results . except for the threshold region",
    "there is not such a similarly good agreement at @xmath1=500 mev / c . in the quasi - elastic peak",
    "there are rather pronounced differences : @xmath127 is about 7 % and @xmath128 about 4 % higher than @xmath129 , their peak positions are shifted by about 6 ( al ) and 5 mev ( b ) towards lower energies . in a consistent relativistic theory",
    "one would of course have identical results and thus the obtained differences point to a relativistic inconsistency in the calculation .    as mentioned before beck _",
    "et al _ @xcite studied the electromagnetic response functions in deuteron electrodisintegration in the quasi - elastic region .",
    "they have shown that an inclusion of boost effects on the hadron wave functions leads essentially to the same results for the various reference frames discussed here .",
    "in addition they have found that boost corrections are almost vanishing in the breit frame .",
    "we believe that also in the three - nucleon electrodisintegration one probably has a similar picture with a strong cancellation of boost effects in the breit frame .",
    "therefore we will take the @xmath128 results in comparison with quasi  elastic experimental data .",
    "a comparison of the @xmath6h and @xmath6he theoretical longitudinal response functions with experimental data of @xcite is shown in fig .",
    "6 at @xmath99 , 300 , and 350 mev / c . in the peak region",
    "one does not find a clear picture , since there is a better agreement once with the 3n force ( @xmath6he ) and once without the 3n force ( @xmath6h ) .",
    "except for the triton case at @xmath99 mev / c one observes rather similar theoretical and experimental results for the high  energy tail . at higher energies the size of the experimental errors is larger than the effect of the 3n force , thus nothing can be said there about an improvement of the theoretical result with the 3n force .    in fig .",
    "7 we show equivalent results as in fig .  6",
    "but at the higher momentum transfers of 400 , 450 , and 500 mev / c . also here one finds a better agreement with experimental data without the 3n force in case of @xmath6h and with the 3n force in case of @xmath6he .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that for all six cases of fig .",
    "7 one has a good agreement of theoretical and experimental peak positions .",
    "concerning the low and high  energy tails one has a rather good agreement between theory and experiment .",
    "next we turn to a comparison of the triton low  energy longitudinal response functions with the experimental data of @xcite . in fig .",
    "8 we show the @xmath5 of @xmath6h at various @xmath1 .",
    "since the @xmath5 frame dependence is very small close to threshold we illustrate directly the results from a lab frame calculation . for the lower two momentum transfers",
    "there is a rather good agreement of experiment and theory , but the size of the experimental error is too large to draw definite conclusions about possible improvements due to the 3n force . at @xmath103 mev",
    "/ c the picture is different , the theoretical response functions are larger than the experimental one , in particular very close to threshold .",
    "it is also evident that the effect of the 3n force moves the calculated @xmath5 even further away from the data .    in fig .",
    "9 we show a similar comparison with experimental data as in fig .",
    "8 but for the @xmath5 of @xmath6he .",
    "again one finds a rather good agreement between theory and experiment for the two lower @xmath1 s , but contrary to the triton case here the 3n force is important for this agreement at @xmath101 mev / c .",
    "also for the highest momentum transfer one finds a similar picture as for the triton case , namely a large overestimation of the experimental data by the theoretical response functions and also an increase of @xmath5 due to the 3n force .    in fig .",
    "9 we also illustrate theoretical results from @xcite .",
    "it is an approach to calculating responses which is entirely different from ours .",
    "the calculation @xcite has been carried out with the av18+urbix potentials , relativistic df- and so - terms have been included and the same nucleon form factors as by us have been used ( dipole fit , neutron electric form factor from @xcite ) . in order to have a clean comparison of the two different calculations , we also take into account the so term for our result with av18 and urbix , though its effect is also here very small .",
    "for the two higher momentum transfers there is a rather good agreement between both calculations .",
    "some differences are visible at @xmath101 mev / c , but the difference between the two calculations is still considerably smaller than the experimental error bars .    the rather large discrepancy between theory and experiment of the low  energy @xmath5 at @xmath103 mev / c requires further theoretical and experimental investigations . we should mention that in the calculation of @xcite relativistic two  body charge operators were also considered .",
    "although they were not sufficient to give agreement with experiment , they did diminish the discrepancy by about a factor of two . concerning the nucleon form factors",
    "one could only obtain a small reduction ( about 3 % ) using the parametrization of @xcite .",
    "in addition the potential model depencence should be further studied . in the discussion of fig .",
    "3 we have already mentioned a rather strong potential model dependence of the low  energy @xmath5 at @xmath103 mev / c .",
    "therefore it would be interesting to consider other modern realistic nn potentials in addition to the av18 and bonnra models used here .",
    "in the following we give a brief summary of our work . the trinucleon longitudinal response function @xmath0 is calculated with realistic nn interactions , 3n , and coulomb forces for a variety of kinematical settings that include momentum transfers @xmath1 between 174 and 500 mev / c and wide ranges of energy transfers @xmath4 .",
    "the results are fully convergent .",
    "the calculations are performed via the lorentz integral transform method .    as nn interaction",
    "we use a modern realistic ( av18 ) , a realistic ( bonnra ) , and also a semi ",
    "realistic ( mt  i / iii ) potential model .",
    "two models ( urbix , tm@xmath104 ) of the 3n force are employed .",
    "the treatment of the trinucleon dynamics is completely non  relativistic .",
    "nonetheless we apply a minimal check on the uncertainties related to this . for this purpose",
    "we evaluate @xmath5 in three different reference frames , namely in lab , anti  lab , and breit frames . for the charge operator",
    "we take the leading relativistic corrections into account ( darwin  foldy and spin  orbit term ) .",
    "in general we find a rather small nn potential model dependence , but in some cases there are also larger effects .",
    "these include the height of the quasi ",
    "elastic peak at lower @xmath1 and the threshold behavior at higher @xmath1 .",
    "the effect of the 3n force is typically between 5 and 10 % , but reaches up to 15 % for the low  enery response at low @xmath1 .",
    "the dependence on the 3n force model is very small for all considered cases .",
    "concerning the relativistic contributions to the charge operator , our inclusive case shows negligible effects due to the spin ",
    "orbit term , while the df term leads to non ",
    "negligible effects at higher @xmath1 . with respect to the @xmath5 calculation in the various reference frames ,",
    "we observe a non ",
    "negligible frame dependence at higher @xmath1 , except for the threshold region . in order to restore a more consistent relativistic behavior",
    "one would need to consider additional relativistic effects .",
    "similar results have been found in @xmath42 and it is shown that additional boost corrections lead to a much better agreement among the various frame results @xcite . in the same work it is also shown that boost effects are negligible in the breit frame .",
    "we assume a similar behavior also in trinucleon electrodisintegration .",
    "thus we compare the @xmath5 calculated in the breit frame with experimental data .",
    "the comparison of our results with experimental data is generally rather satisfying for all considered momentum transfers , in particular for the @xmath5 of @xmath6he .",
    "the experimental data , however , are in most cases not precise enough to draw definite conclusions about the 3n force effect .",
    "a nice exception is the @xmath6he low  energy response , where a 3n force proves to be necesssary to obtain agreement with experiment .",
    "in addition for the @xmath6he quasi ",
    "elastic peak heights at @xmath130 mev / c three - nucleon forces considerably improve the agreement with experiment . at higher @xmath1 and low @xmath4 values",
    "one finds a considerably higher @xmath5 response in theory than in experiment .",
    "last but not least we would like to mention that at very low energies , i.e. up to the three  body breakup threshold , we can compare our results with those of @xcite .",
    "we find quite a good agreement .",
    "the differences which do show up a very low @xmath1 are still smaller than the experimental error bars .",
