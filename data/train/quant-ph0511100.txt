    "composite pulses are designed to perform quantum operations in the presence of systematic errors .",
    "note that it is not necessary to know the size of the error involved , but it is necessary to know its general form .",
    "they have been extensively developed in conventional nmr studies @xcite , principally to correct _ pulse length errors _ , that is errors in the strength of the field used to induce a rotation , and _ off - resonance errors _ , that is imperfections arising when an oscillating field is not quite in resonance with the transition it is supposed to drive .",
    "most of these composite pulses are not suitable for use in quantum information processing , but a small group of them , sometimes called fully compensating pulses , are well suited .",
    "these pulses work on any initial state , and can in principle be used to replace naive gates without any further modifications .",
    "perhaps the most useful family of fully compensating pulses developed to date is the bb1 family of pulses which are robust against pulse length errors .",
    "the ideal unitary transformation for a @xmath0 pulse is @xmath1\\ ] ] but in a real physical system the actual operation will not have this perfect form . in the presence of pulse length errors the real operation",
    "has the form @xmath2\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the fractional error in the pulse length or field power . defining the propagator fidelity as @xmath4 gives the result @xmath5 for a simple @xmath0 pulse .",
    "the bb1 family of robust pulses is obtained by replacing the simple pulse @xmath0 by the composite pulse sequence @xmath6 where @xmath7 .",
    "this composite pulse has a fidelity of @xmath8 showing that for small errors the bb1 pulse is far less error prone than a simple pulse .",
    "the nb1 family of pulses is obtained in a similar way ; in this case the simple pulse is replaced by @xmath9 which has the same structure as bb1 , differing only in the phases .",
    "this sequence is _ more _ error - prone than a simple @xmath0 pulse , and so can not be used to suppress errors .",
    "it does , however , have the interesting property that when @xmath10 the resulting composite pulse is a good approximation to the identity operation . thus is the case of very low pulse powers ( @xmath11 ) an nb1 pulse `` does nothing '' : in effect , evolution under weak fields is suppressed .",
    "the pb1 family of pulses offers a compromise between these two extremes .",
    "the simple pulse is replaced by @xmath12 where @xmath13 .",
    "these pulses are both robust to small errors _ and _ able to suppress weak fields , suggesting that pb1 is the best general purpose family of pulses , although the bb1 and nb1 families perform their respective tasks more effectively .",
    "since these families were described , a range of similar pulses have been discovered , most notably the arbitrary precision pulses of brown _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite . in their notation bb1",
    "is called b2 and pb1 is called p2 ; these are the first members of a series of families of pulses with ever greater error tolerance .",
    "these sequences swiftly become extremely long , and here we consider only the next two members , b4 and p4 .",
    "the b4 composite pulse takes the form @xmath14",
    "^ 4\\\\ ( -2\\pi)_{\\phi+\\psi}(-4\\pi)_{\\phi-\\psi}(-2\\pi)_{\\phi+\\psi}\\\\ \\left[(\\pi)_{\\phi+\\psi } ( 2\\pi)_{\\phi+3\\psi } ( \\pi)_{\\phi+\\psi}\\right]^4 ( \\theta/2)_\\phi\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 and the superscript 4 indicates that the section enclosed by square brackets is repeated four times .",
    "the central three pulses have negative rotation angles ; these can be partially canceled with surrounding pulses , and the remaining rotations can be implemented as positive rotations around axes with phase angles offset by @xmath16 . the p4 composite pulse is similar , taking the form @xmath17",
    "^ 4\\\\ ( -4\\pi)_{\\phi+\\psi'}(-8\\pi)_{\\phi-\\psi'}(-4\\pi)_{\\phi+\\psi'}\\\\ \\left[(2\\pi)_{\\phi+\\psi ' } ( 4\\pi)_{\\phi-\\psi'}(2\\pi)_{\\phi+\\psi'}\\right]^4 ( \\theta/2)_\\phi\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 .",
    "note that the forms for these pulses originally published by brown _",
    "_ @xcite are slightly incorrect @xcite .    under ideal conditions b4 and",
    "p4 perform slightly better than their simpler counterparts , but the gain is slight and more detailed simulations @xcite indicate that these pulses are highly sensitive to the presence of off - resonance and phase errors .",
    "this is confirmed by our experience , described below , that the performance of b4 and p4 is in practice quite poor .",
    "thus the original three families offer perhaps the best combination of simplicity and effectiveness , and we concentrate on them in most of what follows .",
    "it might seem that , as previously suggested , pb1 is the best general purpose family of pulses , but this turns out not to be the case .",
    "most studies of these particular robust quantum logic gates to date have been either theoretical or have involved only simple demonstrations of single logic gates . although these are of some interest , it is also important to investigate more complex situations , such as quantum algorithms containing large numbers of logic gates .",
    "quantum counting provides an ideal testing ground as it permits large numbers of logic gates to be implemented in a simple physical system .     times .",
    "a similar circuit can be constructed for a larger search space by replacing the ( lower ) target bit by a register and replacing gates applied to the target by multi - bit versions .",
    "gates marked @xmath19 implement the nmr pseudo - hadamard operation , while those marked @xmath20 implement the inverse operation . ]",
    "quantum counting is closely related to grover s quantum search @xcite .",
    "consider a function @xmath21 which maps @xmath22-bit strings to a single output bit , such that @xmath23 or @xmath24 .",
    "in general there are @xmath25 possible input values , with @xmath26 values for which @xmath27 .",
    "grover s quantum search allows one of these @xmath26 items to be located , while quantum counting @xcite allows the value of @xmath26 to be estimated .",
    "the counting algorithm estimates an eigenvalue of the grover iterate @xmath28 , which forms the basis of the searching algorithm , where @xmath29 is the @xmath22-bit hadamard transform , @xmath30 maps @xmath31 to @xmath32 and leaves the remaining basis states alone , and @xmath33 maps @xmath34 to @xmath35 . for further details",
    "see @xcite .    a quantum circuit which implements this algorithm on a two qubit nmr quantum computer",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : circuit ] . as usual ,",
    "pairs of hadamard gates have been replaced by nmr pseudo - hadamard gates and their inverse @xcite .",
    "this circuit can be used to count the number of solutions to @xmath27 over a one bit search space , but similar circuits exist for larger search spaces .",
    "to investigate the effects of systematic errors on single qubit gates we implemented this circuit in an nmr experiment using a solution of labeled sodium formate in @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "the formate anion @xmath37 provides an isolated two spin system , comprising a and a nucleus , with a large coupling between the nuclei .",
    "this coupling arises from the scalar coupling interaction , and in a heteronuclear spin system takes the weak - coupling form , usually written as @xmath38 in nmr product operator notation @xcite .",
    "( this coupling is sometimes said to have the ising form , although this name more properly refers to extended networks of such couplings . ) in a heteronuclear spin system the rf transmitters can be place in perfect resonance with each qubit , and so off - resonance effects can be essentially ignored .",
    "the major remaining source of systematic error is pulse length errors arising from inhomogeneity of the rf fields .",
    "rotation ) .",
    "the figures show the effect of applying this gate to a spin in the thermal equilibrium state , which is equivalent to a pseudo - pure state @xmath39 , followed by observation of the nmr spectrum , effectively measuring the off - diagonal components of the single - spin density matrix . for further details see the main text . ]",
    "we begin by demonstrating the effect of using robust quantum logic gates to implement a pseudo - hadamard gate ( a @xmath40 rotation ) on the qubit which begins in an equilibrium state .",
    "in addition to the pulse length errors which arise naturally from inhomogeneity , additional errors can be introduced by deliberately mis - setting the pulse length .",
    "the effect of doing this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hadamard ] .",
    "each sub - figure contains a set of spectra corresponding to pulse length errors in the range @xmath41 , while the six sub - figures correspond to naive pulses and the five families of composite pulses described previously .",
    "as expected the naive pulse gives a signal whose intensity is a cosine function of the fractional error .",
    "the bb1 family is much more robust to pulse length errors , while the nb1 family is more sensitive to errors than the naive pulse , and gives much smaller excitations than the naive pulse for errors close to @xmath41 .",
    "the pb1 family shows the expected compromise behaviour , with a broad central maximum for small errors , and broad minima around errors of @xmath41 .",
    "note that the performance is better for errors around @xmath42 , which is the experimentally important case of very weak fields , than for the theoretically equivalent but experimentally unimportant case of errors close to @xmath43 ; this reflects the intrinsic inhomogeneity of the rf field .",
    "the performance of the b4 composite pulse is broadly similar to that of the much simpler bb1 sequence , while the performance of p4 is clearly rather poor .",
    "this shows that the robust logic gates can have the desired effects when used to implement a single logic gate , with bb1 and pb1 offering the best performance , but it is also important to investigate how they work in more complex situations .",
    "this was done by implementing the quantum counting circuit with the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : countres ] . only naive and bb1 single qubit gates were used .",
    "the improvement obtained by using bb1 single qubit gates is clear , with much of the signal loss that would naively be ascribed to decoherence clearly arising from pulse length errors .",
    "bb1 single qubit gates are , therefore , used throughout the remainder of this paper .",
    "a very similar approach can also be used to tackle systematic errors in coupling gates , which provide the basic two qubit gate for nmr quantum computation @xcite .",
    "evolution under a scalar coupling can be thought of as a rotation about the @xmath44 axis , and errors in the coupling constant @xmath45 correspond to errors in a rotation angle about this axis .",
    "such errors can be overcome @xcite by rotating about a sequence of axes tilted from @xmath44 towards another axis , such as @xmath46 .",
    "defining @xmath47\\ ] ] allows the naive sequence @xmath48 to be replaced by eq .",
    "[ eq : bb1 ] as before .",
    "the tilted evolutions can be achieved by sandwiching free evolution under the coupling hamiltonian between @xmath49 pulses applied to spin @xmath50 . for the case",
    "that @xmath51 ( which forms the basis of the controlled - not  gate ) the final sequence takes the form shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pulses ] .    ) system .",
    "boxes correspond to single qubit rotations with rotation angles of @xmath52 applied along the @xmath53 axes as indicated ; time periods correspond to free evolution under the scalar coupling , @xmath38 , for multiples of the time @xmath54 .",
    "the naive coupling gate corresponds to free evolution for a time @xmath55 . ]",
    "the results of using these robust two qubit gates could be investigated in much the same way as the single qubit gates shown above , but it is more interesting to consider another phenomenon , that is the ability of the nb1 and pb1 gates to suppress evolution under small scalar couplings .",
    "this was studied by implementing quantum counting on the more complex spin system provided by alanine which is labeled at position 2 . like the formate anion",
    ", this contains a ch spin system , comprising the labeled and the directly bonded nucleus , but unlike formate this spin system is not completely isolated , as both nuclei have small couplings to the nuclei in the methyl group .",
    "this additional coupling interaction could be removed by deuterating the methyl group , or by applying decoupling fields , but here we seek to suppress the coupling using robust logic gates .",
    "we begin by studying evolution under the ch coupling , and concentrate on evolution times of @xmath56 , where @xmath22 is a positive integer .",
    "this was done by applying a pseudo - hadamard gate to the nucleus and then allowing the spin system to evolve under a coupling gate ( either naive or composite ) for an effective time @xmath56 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ising ]",
    ". the naive gate appears to perform well for small evolution times , as the evolution under the small @xmath45 coupling can be largely ignored : this coupling is clearly visible in the spectra where each component of the doublet is split into a @xmath57 multiplet , but all four components appear to have very similar phases . for longer evolution times , however , the detrimental effect of this additional coupling becomes clear , as the components appear with quite different phases , indicating significant evolution under the coupling .    in an attempt to overcome this we implemented nb1 coupling gates , which should suppress evolution under this small coupling .",
    "it is immediately obvious from fig .",
    "[ fig : ising ] that this approach does not work , as the multiplets are far more distorted than those seen using the naive sequence .",
    "in retrospect this is unsurprising : nb1 is designed to suppress a small coupling on the assumption that this is the only coupling present .",
    "if the small coupling occurs in addition to another much larger coupling then there is no reason to believe that nb1 will suppress it .",
    "examination of the results from bb1 and pb1 coupling gates makes this point even more clearly .",
    "bb1 gives much cleaner spectra than the naive coupling gate , with the results of pb1 being similar but significantly poorer .",
    "once again the explanation is clear in retrospect : although we know that the splittings visible in the spectrum arise from the combination of a large coupling and a small coupling , the pulse sequence is blind to this origin .",
    "the same pattern could in principle arise from a mixture of different molecules with a _ range _ of coupling constants .",
    "the bb1 robust gate is designed to give very similar behaviour over this range of coupling sizes , and so all the different components of the multiplet appear inphase .",
    "the action of pb1 is similar : the quality of the spectra seen arises not from the ability of this sequence to suppress small couplings , but from its ability to tolerate a range of couplings .",
    "over the range of couplings seen in this system the behaviour of pb1 and bb1 should be very similar , and the relatively poor results observed from pb1 are probably a consequence of the fact that the pb1 sequence take almost twice as long as bb1 , leading to increased problems from decoherence .",
    "the results above show that our original idea that nb1 based composite two qubit gates could be used to suppress small couplings , in effect simplifying complex spin systems , is incorrect .",
    "however , bb1 based two qubit gates do result in the desired suppression , with pb1 sequences giving similar but slightly poorer results , suggesting that it might be possible to use these to simplify spin systems instead .",
    "following this idea we attempted to implement quantum counting in our labeled alanine spin system , using bb1 to suppress the small couplings between the qubit and the methyl protons while using the large coupling between the and the directly bonded qubit to implement logic gates .",
    "these attempts were not successful ( data not shown ) , and once again it is clear in retrospect why this idea will not work .",
    "although the small couplings between the and the methyl protons in the labeled alanine spin system can indeed be suppressed by bb1 , there are also small couplings between the qubit and the methyl protons which will not be suppressed .",
    "these homonuclear couplings could , of course , be removed by frequency selective pulses , or by decoupling , but either approach would act to directly simplify the spin system , rendering the bb1 approach unnecessary .",
    "our results confirm that simple composite pulses can indeed be used to suppress systematic errors on single qubit gates used in implementations of complex quantum algorithms .",
    "the bb1 approach is likely to prove the most useful , while pb1 may find applications in some special areas .",
    "the bb1 sequence can also be used to implement robust two qubit gates , although in this case the extra time required for the longer pulse sequence may cause difficulties .",
    "the more complex b4 and p4 sequences , although theoretically superior , do not perform well in practice .",
    "two qubit gates based on nb1 and pb1 could in principle be used to suppress the effects of small couplings , but this is not effective when the small couplings occur in addition to larger couplings which are used to implement gates . in this case",
    "the small couplings can be treated as small errors in the large coupling , and bb1 provides the best suppression of their effects .",
    "it might appear that this approach could be used to neglect small couplings in complex spin systems , effectively simplifying the spin system through composite pulses , but this approach will rarely if ever be effective , as corresponding homonuclear couplings can not be suppressed by these simple composite pulse methods .",
    "more complex approaches , such as strongly modulated composite pulses , could be more effective , but such pulses need to be designed on a case by case basis ."
