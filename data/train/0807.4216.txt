    "in recent years , intersecting d - brane models , where the chiral fermions arise at the intersections between d6-branes ( type iia ) in the internal space  @xcite with the t - dual type iib description in terms of magnetized d - branes  @xcite have provided an exciting approach towards constructing semi - realistic string vacua ( for reviews , see  @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , such models provide promising setups which may accommodate semi - realistic features of low - energy physics . given this , it is an interesting question to see how far one can get from a particular string compactification to reproducing the finer details of the standard model ( sm ) as a low - energy effective field theory .",
    "the standard model has an intricate structure , with three - generations of chiral fermions which transform as bifundamental representations of @xmath0 .",
    "in addition to the fact that the sm fermions are replicated into three distinct generations , the different generations exhibit a distinct pattern of mass hierarchies and mixings .",
    "interestingly , intersecting d - brane models may naturally generate the sm fermion mass hierarchies and mixings , as well as an explanation for the replication of chirality . in short , d6-branes ( in type iia ) fill four - dimensional minkowski space - time and wrap 3-cycles in the compact manifold , with a stack of @xmath1 d6-branes having a gauge group @xmath2 ( or @xmath3 in the case of @xmath4 ) in its world volume .",
    "the 3-cycles wrapped by the d - branes will in general intersect multiple times in the internal space , resulting in chiral fermions in the bifundamental representation localized at the intersections between different stacks .",
    "the multiplicity of such fermions is then given by the number of times the 3-cycles intersect .",
    "the yukawa couplings in intersecting d6-brane models arise from open string world - sheet instantons that connect three d6-brane intersections @xcite . for a given triplet of intersections , the minimal world - sheet action which contributes to the trilinear yukawa couplings",
    "is weighted by a factor @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the world - sheet area of the triangle bounded by the branes @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "since there are several possible triangles with different areas , mass hierarchies may inherently arise .",
    "the yukawa couplings depend on both the d - brane positions in the internal space as well as on the geometry of the underlying compact manifold .",
    "effectively , these quantities are parameterized by the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of open and closed - string moduli .    despite substantial progress in constructing semi - realistic vacua with intersecting d - branes ,",
    "there are many phenomenological challenges remaining , besides the usual moduli stabilization problem .",
    "typically , some or all of the yukawa couplings are typically forbidden by selection rules which arise from global @xmath9s which become massive via a generalized green - schwarz mechanism .",
    "it has been found that only pati - salam models can have all the sm fermion yukawa couplings present at the stringy tree level , although some couplings which are perturbatively forbidden may be generated in principle via d - brane instanton effects  @xcite .",
    "also , there has generally been a rank one problem in the sm fermion yukawa matrices , preventing the generation of masses and mixings for the first two families of quarks and leptons . for the case of toroidal orientifold compactifications ,",
    "this can be traced to the fact that not all of the sm fermions are localized at intersections on the same torus  @xcite .",
    "however , one example of an intersecting d6-brane model in type iia on the @xmath10 orientifold has recently been discovered in which these problems may be solved  @xcite .",
    "thus , this particular model may be a step forward to obtaining realistic phenomenology from string theory .",
    "indeed , as we have recently shown  @xcite , it is possible within the moduli space of this model to obtain the correct sm quark masses and mixings , the tau lepton mass , and to generate naturally small neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism .",
    "in addition to these features , the model exhibits automatic gauge coupling unification , and it is possible to generate realistic low - energy supersymmetric particle spectra , a subset of which may produce the observed dark matter density .    in spite of the successes of this model , the electron and muon masses come close to the right values , but they are still not quite correct . since the electron and muon masses are very light , it is likely that there are additional corrections that must be considered , as first suggested a long time ago in @xcite .",
    "this idea was applied later in string theory , for the case of the free - fermionic - formulation , where the general rules for calculating higher order corrections , from multipoint - functions , to the yukawa couplings were first given in @xcite . with this in mind , in this paper we consider contributions to the yukawa couplings from four - point functions .",
    "four - point string interactions in intersecting d6-brane scenarios can be regarded as the scattering amplitudes of four string matter fields @xcite , and are consistent to the khler metrics of twisted matter @xcite . both the quantum and classical contributions have been studied in two special cases where one has only an independent angle and the other has two independent angles in a closed quadrilateral @xcite .",
    "this was then promoted to the generalized calculation of @xmath1-point amplitudes and four - point functions without angle constraints @xcite .",
    "this analysis is based on the discussion of the twisted closed string interactions on orbifolds @xcite , where the analogy between open strings at brane intersections and closed strings on orbifolds is known .",
    "the complete amplitudes for yukawa couplings , as a three - point limit of the four - point amplitude from conformal field theory , are also discussed in @xcite .",
    "it is natural to ask whether the four - point function corrections to the yukawa couplings can generate the correct electron and muon masses in the model discussed in @xcite ; indeed the correct electron and muon masses can be obtained by including four - point function corrections in principle .",
    "however , the d6-branes in this model can not form a closed quadrilateral for the required four - point couplings on the relevant two torus .",
    "two stacks of d - branes overlap so the `` angle '' at their `` intersection '' turns out as a straight line . instead of using the conventional calculational procedure in this model , we can still apply the idea of four - point function corrections by taking the vector - like fields at the `` intersection '' on the overlapped d6-branes in a asymptotic limit of the `` angle '' to @xmath11 , a physical mechanism which has not yet been clarified .",
    "therefore , we shall consider another model where the standard four - point function corrections can be calculated . as we shall see later in this model ,",
    "if the sm fermion mass matrices receive contributions from only three - point functions , one can only obtain the correct quark masses and tau lepton mass , but it is not possible to explain the ckm quark mixings , and the electron and muon masses .",
    "introducing corrections from four - point functions , one can indeed obtain the correct quark and the tau lepton masses , and the ckm quark mixings , and as well as the electron mass .",
    "however , the muon mass is still about 36% smaller than the desired value .    in this paper",
    ", we review the construction of four - point functions , and include both trilinear yukawa couplings and four - point interactions to obtain the sm fermion mass matrices in an explicit intersecting d - brane model .",
    "we show that it is indeed possible to better match the masses and mixings for all fermions when four - point corrections are included .",
    "in addition , these corrections may have broader application to other models .",
    "let us begin by considering an open string stretched between two d - branes intersecting at an angle @xmath12 . from the boundary conditions we can write the mode expansion as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the worldsheet coordinate . by comparison of this expression with the mode expansion for a closed string in the cft analysis of a @xmath15 orbifold twist field @xcite",
    ", the ope can be written as  @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the intersection point of the two d - branes , @xmath18 is the open string twist field , and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are excited twist fields .",
    "the local monodromy conditions are then given by @xcite @xmath21    since we are interested in a four - point interaction , we demand that the four strings are in a bounded area such that @xmath22 , and it is required that the four twist operators @xmath23 are present at the d - brane intersections . due to invariance under @xmath24 , we can set @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 . the field @xmath29 has a classical piece @xmath30 and a quantum piece @xmath31 , so the interaction amplitude can be factorized into a classical solution resulting from worldsheet instantons and a quantum contribution resulting from quantum fluctuations as @xmath32 where @xmath33      the classical field can be expanded by ope as @xmath34 where @xmath35 @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 are complex constants . on a torus with brane intersection considered @xcite , the local monodromy condition is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the intersection point and @xmath42 is the lattice translation of the torus .",
    "then from the global monodromy conditions we have @xcite @xmath43        in fig .",
    "[ indexarea ] , the index @xmath44 denotes the @xmath44-th vertex , @xmath45 is the intersection point between stack @xmath36 and @xmath38 d - branes and so on , and we define @xmath46 to be the vector along the direction from @xmath47 to @xmath48 .",
    "thus @xmath49 , etc , where @xmath50 is an integer and @xmath51 is the intersection number . from the closure of the quadrilateral @xmath52 , we can count the areas from the solutions of the linear diophantine equations @xcite @xmath53    in the case having two independent angles which we will consider later for a specific model , if stacks @xmath36 and @xmath8 are parallel to each other , then the above diophantine equations can be simplified , and the four integer parameters @xmath50 are not independent . from @xcite these @xmath50 can be parameterized by two independent integer variables , which we will use in the following area analysis by applying a different approach .",
    "refer to @xcite for the details of the calculation involving hypergeometric functions from the integral of @xmath54 and @xmath55 , we can write down the minimum classical action when there is non - zero worldsheet area on one subtorus as @xcite @xmath56 where the equation in the parenthesis is exactly the formula for the area of a quadrilateral with angles @xmath57 and two sides @xmath58 and @xmath59 . we will then use this information to calculate the classical contribution of the four - point functions .",
    "the quantum contribution of the four - point function is given by the correlator @xmath60 from the ope of the stress tensor @xmath61 with the twist fields we have @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the conformal dimension .",
    "@xmath61 also has a relation to @xmath29 as follows @xmath64 therefore , we can write @xmath65.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we may then define the green s function as @xmath66 from eq .",
    "( [ tz - kinetic ] ) we can find the asymptotic properties of @xmath67 : @xmath68 similarly from eqs .",
    "( [ expansx ] ) and ( [ omega ] ) we can write down the equations for @xmath29 and @xmath69 : @xmath70 then @xmath67 can be expanded in the following form @xcite @xmath71 the coefficients @xmath72 can be fixed by the above asymptotic relations , so finally we can determine @xmath73    the quantum part of the monodromy conditions is independent of the contours , so that @xmath74 we can use this condition to determine @xmath75 and define two homology cycles @xmath76 and @xmath77 by cutting the complex plane between @xmath78 and @xmath79 , and between @xmath80 and @xmath81 . in this way , we find @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the auxiliary correlation function @xmath84 after using the @xmath24 invariance , we obtain that eq .",
    "( [ monodromy ] ) turns out to be @xmath85 solving @xmath75 , the correlator @xmath86 then has a form @xcite @xmath87 where @xmath88 is a function of @xmath89 , @xmath57 , gamma functions of @xmath57 , and hypergeometric functions @xcite .",
    "again , we are more interested in the case with two independent angles , therefore by setting @xmath90 and @xmath91 , the quantum part of the four - point function can be written as @xcite @xmath92 where @xmath93,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath94 is the hypergeometric function ; @xmath95 .",
    "we have used the fact that @xmath96 . note that the quantum contribution eq .",
    "( [ z4qu ] ) remains invariant under the interchange of the interior and exterior angles @xmath97 .",
    "the general form for a four - point amplitude on @xmath98 with two independent angles is then given  by @xmath99    by taking the limit of @xmath89 , @xmath100 is fixed to a constant and we obtain the three - point amplitude for the yukawa couplings @xcite @xmath101^{\\frac{1}{4 } } \\sum_m { \\exp } \\big(-\\frac{a_j}{2\\pi\\alpha'}\\big ) .",
    "\\label{zq3}\\ ] ]    as we will later encounter in the model considered in the next section , where only the d - branes on the second torus form closed areas either for four - point or three - point amplitudes , the quantum contributions from other tori are just constants , which are then able to be absorbed into the vevs of the higgs fields . using a computer code , we find that the ratio of @xmath102 to @xmath100 is around @xmath103 which can then also be absorbed into the vevs for simplicity .",
    "therefore , we can merely focus on the classical contributions to the sm fermion masses and mixings .",
    "let us first review the pati - salam model discussed in @xcite , where its d6-brane configurations and intersecting numbers are presented in table  [ real ] .",
    "to explain the electron and muon masses in this model , we are looking for four - point interactions such as @xmath104 where @xmath105 are the chiral superfields at the intersections between stack @xmath106 and @xmath107 d6-branes .",
    ".d6-brane configurations and intersecting numbers for the model presented in  @xcite , where the sm fermions and higgs fields are from the intersections on the first torus .",
    "this model is constructed from type iia @xmath108 orientifold . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the sm fermion mass matrices from the four - point interactions are @xmath109    therefore , we sum over the two contributions , and obtain @xmath110 and the mass eigenvalues of the leptons are @xmath111    comparing with the sm fermion masses and mixings in eqs .",
    "( [ quarkmass ] ) and ( [ leptonmass ] ) , we find that the off - diagonal terms of the up - type quark mass matrix are basically from the four - point contributions , and it is quite difficult to fit exactly the same off - diagonal terms due to the four - point function matrix structure . for the down - type quark matrix , we still can not eliminate the off - diagonal terms .",
    "however , we can suppress them such that they are in an acceptable range .",
    "in addition , the quark ckm mixing matrix is @xmath112 and then there are some deviations for the quark mixing terms in eq .",
    "( [ ckm - gut ] ) , but they are in an acceptable range",
    ". finally , we are able to decrease the electron mass eigenvalue to the correct value by the off - diagonal terms from the four - point contributions , but the muon mass eigenvalue is still about 36% smaller than the desired value .",
    "we have discussed corrections to the sm fermion yukawa couplings in intersecting d6-brane models due to four - point interactions and presented a working example , and demonstrated that these corrections can improve the best fits for the sm fermion masses and mixings . in a concrete model , we first calculated the sm fermion masses and mixings from three - point functions .",
    "considering only these contributions , we can obtain the correct quark masses and tau lepton mass , but the ckm quark mixings are not large enough , and the electron and muon masses are far from the desired values . after including the corrections to the sm fermion yukawa couplings from four - point functions",
    ", we can obtain the correct quark masses and ckm mixings , and the correct electron and tau lepton mass scales .",
    "however , the muon mass is still around 36% smaller than the desired value .    in this work ,",
    "we have not considered the moduli stabilization problem , and have essentially treated the moduli vevs as free parameters . as is obvious , there exists fine - tuning in our discussion of the d - brane positions and the higgs vevs .",
    "the four - point interactions have nine dependent worldsheet instanton parameters as well as six additional string - scale higgs particles and their vevs . to stabilize these undetermined variables",
    ", one may consider a @xmath113 orientifold model with discrete torsion where the d - branes wrap rigid cycles , thus stabilizing the open - string moduli . in this case",
    ", one would also expect corrections to the yukawa couplings from d - brane instantons .",
    "indeed , e2-branes required for this construction must also wrap rigid cycles , so there is additional motivation to consider this background .",
    "we plan to pursue these possibilities in our future research .",
