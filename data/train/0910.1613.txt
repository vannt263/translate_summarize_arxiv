    "the wilson loops @xcite , with @xmath0 a closed curve , @xmath1 the gauge field , and the trace taken in the @xmath2-dimensional fundamental representation of @xmath3    @xmath4 \\,,\\ ] ]    have been studied from many points of view in gauge theories @xcite .",
    "the first thought about loops is the wilson criterion for confinement .",
    "it is expected to show up in an area law for the expectation value of a loop    @xmath5 \\,\\ep^{-s_{\\text{\\tiny ym}}}\\,\\ , w(a , { \\cal c } ) \\,,\\ ] ]    with @xmath6 the yang - mills action .",
    "the area law means that @xmath7 decays exponentially with an area enclosed by the loop .",
    "there have also been many discussions of this issue in the context of supersymmetric gauge theories with additional fermionic and scalar fields @xcite .",
    "the second thought about loops is that instead of quantizing the gauge field @xmath8 , one can quantize coordinates @xmath9 . in terms of euclidean path",
    "integral , that means    @xmath10\\,\\ep^{-s(x)}\\,\\,w(a , { \\cal c } ) \\,,\\ ] ]    where @xmath11 is an action for the quantized coordinates , fields @xmath9 with @xmath12 . for a @xmath13 gauge group ,",
    "such an integral appeared in the feynman s first - quantized formulation of scalar qed many years ago @xcite .",
    "later , it also appeared in string theory , where the non - abelian wilson factor was inserted into the polyakov path integral to describe an effective action for massless string modes @xcite .",
    "the main point here is that the renormalized path integral is to be identified with the effective action    @xmath14    subsequent work @xcite has made it clear that this approach should be taken seriously , particularly in the context of @xmath15-brane actions @xcite .",
    "in fact , one can consider the formula as a generating functional for gauge invariant actions without any reference to string theory .",
    "in other words , given the action @xmath11 , one can use it to compute ( generate ) the corresponding gauge theory action via . note that in general such actions include infinitely many terms .",
    "the two classical examples are that of schwinger @xcite and non - linear electrodynamics of born - infeld type obtained from in @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have two main aims .",
    "first , we want to generalize the method to nonrelativistic gauge theories . in recent years",
    ", such theories have been of considerable interest in the context of strongly correlated electron systems as an effective field theory description of the long - wavelength physics at quantum critical points with anisotropic scaling .",
    "a peculiar property of those is that in the lagrangian the usual @xmath16-term @xcite , or alternatively the @xmath17-term @xcite , has vanishing coefficient .",
    "for example , in @xmath18 dimensions the action is of the form @xcite",
    "@xmath19 \\,,\\ ] ]    where @xmath20 and @xmath21 is a coupling constant parameterizing a line of fixed points .",
    "our second aim is to find some ( off - critical ) non - linear deformations of the effective actions proposed in @xcite .",
    "we keep in mind the born - infeld electrodynamics @xcite that differs from that of maxwell by higher order terms in the field strength .",
    "moreover , as in the case of the born - infeld action where it describes the low energy dynamics of @xmath15-branes , such deformations might be useful for studying nonrelativistic branes .    before getting to the specific examples that we will consider ,",
    "let us set the basic framework .",
    "for the contour @xmath0 , we take a unit circle parameterized by an angular variable @xmath22 . then , following @xcite , we split the field @xmath23 into a zero fourier mode @xmath24 and remaining non - zero modes such that @xmath25 with @xmath26 .",
    "from the zero mode when it is clear from the context . ] a good pragmatic reason for doing so is that the @xmath27 s are interpreted as classical coordinates , while the @xmath28 s are quantum fluctuations which have to be integrated out .",
    "if we let @xmath11 be quadratic in fluctuations , then , for a generic kinetic term , we can rewrite as    @xmath29\\,\\exp\\left[-\\tfrac{1}{2}\\xi g^{-1}\\xi\\right]\\ ,   w(a(x+\\xi ) ) \\,,\\ ] ]    where @xmath30 .",
    "we normalize the functional integral measure @xmath31 $ ] as @xmath32\\,\\exp\\bigl [ -\\tfrac{1}{2}\\xi g^{-1}\\xi\\bigr]=1 $ ] .    in conclusion",
    ", we make the following remarks about formula :    \\(1 ) for @xmath33 with @xmath34 that describes the free propagation of a particle , @xmath35 is a local operator .",
    "its green function is given by @xmath36 , where @xmath37 .",
    "\\(2 ) for the \" string  action @xmath38 , with @xmath15 a unit disc , @xmath35 is a non - local operator .",
    "note that non - locality appears after gaussian integration over @xmath39 in all internal points of the disc that provides an effective one - dimensional path integral @xcite . in this case , the corresponding green function is given by @xmath40 .",
    "\\(3 ) finally , there is one more issue to be mentioned here .",
    "the above construction seems somewhat formal that may be when the path integral diverges .",
    "following @xcite , we will define one - dimensional path integral by using the riemann @xmath41-function .",
    "thus , we express all sums in terms of @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "in this section we will describe a concrete example of nonrelativistic gauge theory without the usual magnetic @xmath44-term in the lagrangian .",

    "motivated by the zero slope limit @xmath77 of string theory , we would like to consider it in the problem at hand .",
    "as known , the role of this limit is just to remove the higher order corrections in @xmath66 from the string effective action and , as a result , it becomes quadratic in @xmath78 .",
