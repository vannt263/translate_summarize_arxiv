    "[ sec : cncl ] .",
    "a proposal that the gravitational confinement in primordial black holes might find analogue in the qcd confinement inside hadrons dates back to the seventies of the last century @xcite . due to color neutrality ( confinement ) , the physical vacuum is thought to form an event horizon for quarks and gluons preventing even quantum tunneling @xcite . since no information is transmitted through the black hole radiation to the outside , the radiation is likely thermal and must maintain color neutrality .",
    "a universal feature of @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and even heavy - ion collisions is that the particle production follows a thermal pattern and apparently occurs at the same temperature .",
    "the thermalization in heavy - ion collisions is obvious because of the possible rescatterings between the large number of interacting partons , which is not the case in @xmath16 annihilation .",
    "the hadronization is assumed as the qcd counterpart of hawking radiation @xcite .",
    "this analogue solves many puzzles of thermalization , and universal freeze - out temperature and shall be utilized to explain various freeze - out conditions .    *",
    "quantum tunneling through quark and gluon event horizon because of vacuum instability through pair production leads to thermal radiation at a temperature determined by the string tension . * a succession of such tunneling processes is likely at high energy .",
    "partition processes and resulting cascades lead to a limiting temperature as that in the thermal models . * in kinetic thermalization ,",
    "the initial state information is likely lost through successive collisions , while stochastic qcd hawking radiations are in equilibrium preventing information transfer .    for sake of completeness",
    ", it is worthwhile to add that even such proposed analogue might not be literary exact .",
    "this partly defines possible uncertainties in the present calculations .",
    "while the initial state information is likely lost through the strong collisions and kinetic thermalization @xcite , the stochastic qcd hawking - unruh radiation remains in equilibrium , because the quantum tunneling does not allow information transfer @xcite .",
    "as introduced in @xcite , the correspondence between qcd hadronization and hawking - unruh radiation is a kind of phenomenological matching based on gauge theory gravity .",
    "the black hole behind which rindler horizon could confirm the experimental dependence of @xmath0 on the center - of - mass energy ( @xmath19 ) , is likely a witten black hole , especially the constant @xmath0 for all elementary scattering processes at large energies .",
    "furthermore , an effective description of the screening of string tension ( @xmath8 ) with varying @xmath19 or chemical potential ( @xmath1 ) was introduced @xcite .",
    "the extension to a finite chemical potential ( @xmath1 ) should add a new _ `` charge '' _ introducing a modification in the quantum tunneling process and in the corresponding hawking - unruh hadronization temperature @xcite .",
    "the temperature of black hole radiation is determined by confinement phase transition . on the other hand ,",
    "the dependence of the hadronization temperature on the baryon density forms a kind of _ `` white '' _ hole in high - energy collisions from which _ `` colored '' _ quarks are emitted .",
    "these are conjectured to remain confined by chromodynamic forces or equivalently by the bag pressure @xmath20",
    ". at nonvanishing baryon chemical potential ( @xmath1 ) the fermi repulsion between the corresponding quarks becomes very likely .",
    "this additional interaction appears in the form of density - depending pressure @xmath21 .",
    "the effects of baryon chemical potential are opposite to that of @xmath20 .",
    "in the particle production , it is widely accepted that the nature of the freeze - out temperature is in statistical thermal equilibrium . on the other hand",
    ", the rindler horizon represents another pillar for the proposed hawking - unruh radiation correspondence with the qcd hadronization . in @xmath22 pair production ,",
    "the analogue of rindler horizon is _",
    "`` color - blind '' _ process which is produced by color - charge neutrality or confinement , i.e. rindler - unruh excitement of qcd vacuum .",
    "this means that the @xmath22 pair production are likely thermal because of the random distribution of @xmath23 and @xmath24 , which are entangled in such qcd vacuum .",
    "the produced hadrons are assumed to be _",
    "`` born in equilibrium''_.    the hadronic rindler spacetime is considered as near - horizon approximation of specific black hole spacetimes .",
    "the existence of common thermodynamical features of both qcd hadronization and black hole radiation is proposed as a category defining that black hole spacetime that assures correspondence with particle the production @xcite , especially the possibly to predict the dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath19 or @xmath1 .",
    "additionally , various conditions have been proposed in @xcite ; ( i ) proportionality of black hole mass to @xmath19 , ( ii ) coincidence of string tension and coupling constant and ( iii ) correspondence of hawking temperature with unruh temperature .",
    "furthermore , the authors of @xcite added a fourth condition that the black hole partition function should diverge at a given temperature .",
    "according to this additional condition , they excluded most of the well - known black holes , such as schwarzschild or reissner - nordstrm black hole . in proposing this condition , it was assumed that the black hole radiation is a continuous process that lasts untill the black hole mass entirely evaporates .",
    "there is a great number of theoretical works examining the conundrum of the black hole evaporation , for instance @xcite .",
    "indeed , the evaporation process that fulfills causality and thermodynamical consistency ends up with massive remnants .",
    "accordingly , the partition function should be diverging , i.e. becoming singular , and the related hawking temperature , which is inversely proportional to the remaining black hole mass , defines the _ critical _ temperature .",
    "unruh temperature is proportional to the acceleration ( @xmath25 ) of a test particle in vicinity of the black hole horizon , which is assumed to emerge due to causally disconnected spacetimes , i.e. rindler coordinate , @xmath26 , which is known as spacetime rapidity in the high - energy collisions @xcite . for completeness sake , the surface of rindler space reads @xmath27 . in general relativity theory ,",
    "rindler space is considered as an approximation to the schwarzschild metric of a large black hole .",
    "a rearrangement of the vacuum structure is possible through bogoliubov transformation which relates operators for particle creation and annihilation in rindler and minkowski spaces .",
    "furthermore , the vacuum in minkowski space is related to that in the rindler space by bogoliubov transformation , in which the rindler vacuum is populated with temperature @xmath28 . by considering chiral symmetry restoration induced by a rapid deceleration of the colliding nuclei , it was argued that the parton saturation in the initial nuclear wave functions is a necessary precondition for the formation of quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , which can then hadronize @xcite .",
    "the black hole event horizon is created by the strong gravitational attraction , which leads to a diverging schwarzschild metric at a certain value of the spatial extension ( @xmath29 ) @xcite . at the equator ,",
    "the invariant spacetime length element is given as ds^2 = ( 1 - 2 )  dt^2 - ( 1- 2)^-1 dr^2 , [ schwarz ] where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are flat space and time coordinates , respectively .",
    "at schwarzschild radius @xmath32 , @xmath33 diverges , i.e. become singular . in eq .",
    "( [ schwarz ] ) , natural units are assumed ( @xmath34 ) . to fit with the approach introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath35 , where @xmath36 defines the string tension .",
    "thus , hereafter @xmath37 is not omitted from the expressions .",
    "if the black hole has a net electric - charge @xmath38 , the resulting coulomb repulsion weakens the gravitational attraction .",
    "this in turn modifies the event horizon @xcite and the corresponding line element ( reissner - nordstrm metric ) as well ds^2 = ( 1 - 2 + ) d t^2 - ( 1- 2 + ) ^-1 dr^2 .",
    "[ rn ] the field strength of the interaction is obtained from the coefficient f(r_rn ) & = & 1 - 2 + .",
    "the divergence leads to smaller reissner - nordstrm radius r_rn = r_s .",
    "[ rnradius ] at vanishing charge , @xmath39 is reduced to the schwarzschild radius ( @xmath40 ) .",

    "the proposed freeze - out temperatures are calculated from charged black holes .",

    "<S> the proposed analogy between hadron production in high - energy collisions and hawking - unruh radiation process in the black holes shall be extended . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism provides a theoretical basis for the freeze - out parameters , the temperature ( @xmath0 ) and the baryon chemical potential ( @xmath1 ) , characterizing the final state of particle production . </S>",
    "<S> the results from charged black holes , in which the electric charge is related to @xmath1 , are found comparable with the phenomenologically deduced parameters from the ratios of various particle species and the higher - order moments of net - proton multiplicity in thermal statistical models and polyakov linear - sigma model . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the resulting freeze - out condition @xmath2gev for average energy per particle is in good agreement with the hadronization process in the high - energy experiments . for the entropy density ( @xmath3 ) </S>",
    "<S> , the freeze - out condition @xmath4 remains valid for @xmath5gev . </S>",
    "<S> then , due to the dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath1 , the values of @xmath6 increase with increasing @xmath1 . in accordance with this observation , we found that the entropy density remains constant with increasing @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we conclude that almost no information is going lost through hawking - unruh radiation from charged black holes . </S>",
    "<S> it is worthwhile to highlight that the freeze - out temperature from charged black holes is determined independent on both freeze - out conditions .    </S>"
