    "the causes of solar flares , their relations to filament eruptions , coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) , and underlying processes have been considered for several decades .",
    "a number of flare models have been proposed .",
    "the ` standard ' flare model , referred to as ` cshkp ' for its contributors @xcite , is the most elaborated one , being extensively supported by observations .",
    "in particular , proposed that the current sheet , in which the flare reconnection occurred , formed due to the lift - off of a filament , whose eruption was driven by a magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) instability of an increasing current in the filament . this scenario directly associated a flare with an eruption , and thus provided a basis for understanding the initiation of cmes .",
    "later considerations adopted the scenario of , but the filaments ( prominences ) were mainly assumed to be passive dense plasmas accumulated near the bottom of eruptive flux ropes .",
    "this picture revealed from non - flare - related eruptions of filaments outside of active regions ( ars ) , is thought to also apply to the flare - related eruptions from ars .",
    "however , the causes of the eruptions themselves have not been elaborated by the standard model ; and the model did not incorporate confined flares .",
    "the idea of was elaborated by @xcite ( @xcite ) , who developed a theory of the expansion of a magnetic flux rope .",
    "the propelling force driving an eruption in the chen s _ flux rope model _ is the lorentz force , which governs the torus instability .",
    "the difficulty of this model is that the ongoing injection of the poloidal magnetic flux is required to ensure the expansion of a cme @xcite .",
    "the _ breakout _ reconnection @xcite can help to overcome the magnetic tension of the transverse magnetic flux above the rope .",
    "another model of eruptions , the _ tether cutting model _ proposed by , is currently popular . a case study of an eruptive event lead to a conclusion that the ` tether cutting ' reconnection occurred after the eruption onset only as a by - product , while this scenario might apply to different events .",
    "proposed the formation of the poloidal magnetic flux due to reconnection in a sheared arcade , based on the original idea of ( _ cf .",
    "_ @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this scenario ( see also ) was confirmed quantitatively in the comparison of the magnetic flux reconnected in flares with the poloidal flux of the corresponding magnetic clouds near earth @xcite .",
    "and @xcite ( @xcite ) found a temporal correspondence between the hard x - ray flare emission and acceleration of a cme .",
    "this fact is considered as a further support to the formation of the cme s poloidal flux in the course of magnetic reconnection responsible for the corresponding flare .    the _ dual - filament model _",
    "@xcite combines the processes employed by the standard model with effects of joining two filaments . the increased total twist in the combined filament forces the development of the torus instability .",
    "the combination of the backbone fields of the filaments creates the initial propelling force .",
    "these processes induce the stretching the numerous filament threads anchored in the photosphere and reconnection between them , thus increasing the inner twist .",
    "reconnection in the enveloping arcade augments the outer twist , as in the standard model .",
    "the formerly stable filament transforms into a ` mainspring ' .",
    "this brief overview shows that many years of observational and theoretical studies of solar eruptions have not yet led to consensus about their scenarios , relation to flares , and the development of cmes .",
    "it is possible that different scenarios adequately describe the events of different types .",
    "observational limitations restricted the opportunities to verify the existing concepts .",
    "another subject of long - standing debates is related to shock waves propagating in the corona .",
    "their existence is evidenced by several phenomena .",
    "following , moreton waves are considered as lower skirts of coronal shock waves .",
    "many ` euv waves ' are also candidates .",
    "type ii radio bursts and interplanetary shocks provide further support .",
    "nevertheless , the origin of shocks remains controversial ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , for a review ) .    the first historical concept ascribed the excitation of coronal shock waves to the flare plasma pressure pulses . in the scenario of , `",
    "_ _ in front of the prominence a shock wave may be generated and this might be the cause of either type - ii or moving type - iv burst _ _ ' . a popular scenario favored by the _ in situ _ observations of bow shocks ahead of interplanetary cmes ( icmes ) and studies of solar data",
    "@xcite relates the excitation of ` cme - driven shocks ' to the outer surfaces of super - alfv ' enic cmes .",
    "@xcite ( @xcite ) argued in favor of the shock wave excitation by impulsively erupting flux ropes , similar to the conjecture of .",
    "a flux rope forming from the filament , initially located low in the corona , sharply accelerates and produces an mhd disturbance .",
    "it rapidly steepens into a shock above an ar , where the fast - mode speed steeply falls off @xcite , and then freely propagates like a decelerating blast wave .",
    "one might expect that such blast - wave - like shocks propagating ahead of cmes either eventually get transformed into bow shocks , if the cme is fast , or decay into a weak disturbance otherwise .",
    "the uncertainties in the scenarios of eruptions , cmes , and excitation of shocks are due to the limitations of observations .",
    "ground - based observations of eruptions carried out mostly in the h@xmath0 line are restricted by the loss of the opacity of eruptions in their expansion , and the doppler shift removing them from the filter passband .",
    "space - borne observations in the heii 304    line , which is well - suited for the detection of prominences , were infrequent in the past .",
    "the loss of the lasco / c1 coronagraph on soho in 1998 resulted in a large gap between the observations of near - surface activity and white - light cmes .",
    "soho / eit provided insufficient temporal sampling of eruptions and wave - like disturbances .",

    "the dynamic radio spectra reveal the signatures of propagating shocks ( type iis ) and expanding ejecta ( type ivs ) .",
    "measurements of eruptive features , which are usually faint relative to associated flares , are complicated by a rapid decrease of their brightness or opacity . the difficulties to detect and follow them in all analyzed images lead to large positional uncertainties . even in modern elaborations ( _ e.g. _ , ; ) , the differentiation of the measured distance - time points causes a large scatter of the velocities and accelerations .",
    "this drawback is reduced in the approach based on the fit of an analytic function to the measurements ( _ e.g. _ , ; ; ; ) .",
    "the approach uses the fact that the initial and final velocities of an eruption are nearly constant , while the acceleration occurs within a limited time interval .",
    "we fit the acceleration with a gaussian time profile .",
    "the kinematical plots are calculated by means of the integration of the analytic fit rather than the differentiation of the measurements .",
    "the results of the fit are used as a starting estimate of the parameters of the acceleration , and then they are optimized to outline the eruption in a best way . our ultimate criterion is to follow the analyzed feature as closely as possible in all of the images .",
    "if the kinematics is more complex , then we use a combination of gaussians and adjust their parameters manually .",
    "the major errors are due to the uncertainties in following a moving feature , whose visibility decreases .",
    "all methods should converge to similar results .",
    "the accuracy and performance of each method are different .",
    "the accuracy is essential for our purposes .",
    "our measurements of wave signatures are based on the same approach and a power - law fit expected for shock waves .",
    "the techniques are described in @xcite ( @xcite ) .    using multi - instrument observations in various spectral ranges ,",
    "we pursue a deeper insight into the following issues : how do impulsive eruptions occur ; how do cmes form ; when and where are shock waves excited , and where they in the images are ; are they related to ` euv waves ' or not . for these purposes we consider two eruptive events of different energetics .",
    "we analyze the observed relations between the filament eruptions and the onset of the flares . to reveal the histories of the disturbances produced by the eruptions , we detect and reconcile their manifestations at different wavelengths such as the response of individual coronal structures located not far from the eruption sites ; large - scale ` euv waves ' ; the outermost envelopes of the white - light cmes ; the trajectories and structures of type ii radio bursts .",

    "considering in terms of high - beta conditions the role of the plasma pressure in the initiation of the eruption , the authors have not come to a certain conclusion because of the unknown plasma density and magnetic field strength in the prominence , which was supposed to be a part of a larger flux rope .",
    "we will address the kinematics of the eruptive structures , their relation to the flare , and follow the development of the shock wave and cme .      the initiation phase manifested in gradual changes of the v - shaped filament visible in stereo - b / euvi 304    images more than half an hour before the eruption . in figure  [ f-20110224_initiation]a ,",

    "the flare brightening became conspicuous .",
    "its rhombus - like extensions were due to an overexposure distortion , which contaminated the images during the flare .",

    "however , the picture revealed by the aia data is more complex .    .",
    "the arrow in the right panels indicates the flare site .",
    "the axes show the coordinates in arcsec from the solar disk center . ]    initially , the prominence was dark and screened features behind it such as a bright ring in figure  [ f-20110224_sdo_images]c .",
    "this fact indicates absorption , which occurs if the temperature of the prominence body is low , @xmath3  k ( see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "then a helical structure of the prominence appeared and evolved .",
    "the small ring became bright at 211    that indicates its heating up to @xmath4  mk ( or still higher , see ) .",
    "the brightening of the formerly dark prominence suggests an increase of the plasma pressure , @xmath5 , by a factor of @xmath6 ( _ cf_. ) .",
    "such a strong pressure rise could deform the prominence and inspire the development of some instability .",
    "the rise of the sxr flux during the initiation phase supports the role of heating .",
    "the gray - scale right panels of figure  [ f-20110224_sdo_images ] show concentric loops of a pre - eruption arcade .",
    "the loops embraced the prominence ; their expansion lagged behind it .",
    "figures [ f-20110224_kinematics]a[f-20110224_kinematics]c present the kinematics of two prominence segments and one of the outermost loops , whose delay is most pronounced . the measurement technique ( @xcite @xcite )",

    "the errors of @xmath7 produce minor uncertainties in the velocities of the filament segments of @xmath8 and acceleration center times of @xmath9  s. the acceleration of the arcade is more uncertain . applying to the arcade loop a much shorter , stronger acceleration with the same center time results in an indiscernible change of the calculated positions .",
    "therefore , the solid blue plots for the loop in figures [ f-20110224_kinematics]a and [ f-20110224_kinematics]b are the limits corresponding to the longest acceleration .",

    "using the nearly perpendicular viewing direction of stereo - b relative to the sun ",
    "earth line , one can approximately estimate the velocity components directly from the images observed with stereo - b and aia : the module of the velocity and acceleration vectors should be related to the plane - of - the - sky measurements from aia data by a factor of about 1.09 .",
    "the bright helical ring of the eruptive prominence was a most dynamic feature , leading all others .",
    "its acceleration was the highest one and reached @xmath14  km  s@xmath15 in the plane of the sky ( @xmath16  km  s@xmath17 ; @xmath18  m  s@xmath15 is the solar gravity acceleration at the photospheric level ) .",
    "the darker ring accelerated somewhat later with @xmath19  km  s@xmath15 .",
    "the prominence drove the expansion of the arcade , which lagged behind the fastest prominence ring by about 1.5 min .",
    "it is useful to compare the acceleration of the eruption with the bursts in hxr ( rhessi ) and microwaves ( usaf rstn san vito and learmonth stations ) .",
    "the correspondence between hxr and microwave bursts is well known .",
    "a temporal correspondence between hxr bursts and cme acceleration was established by @xcite ( @xcite ) .",
    "here we see that the latter correspondence might be due to the delays of both the arcade expansion and flare emission with respect to the acceleration of the prominence , which itself could be the developing flux rope .",
    "the prominence threads in figure  [ f-20110224_sdo_images ] were connected to the flare site resembling a flare cusp .",

    "the observations do not reveal any signs of the breakout reconnection @xcite within the field of view of aia ; the eruptive prominence apparently had to overcome the magnetic tension of the overlying closed fields by itself .",
    "neither the images in figure  [ f-20110224_sdo_images ] show the lateral overexpansion discussed by .",
    "the shape of the arcade looks consistent with a limitation of its expansion by the solar surface and a tilted motion of the eruptive prominence .",

    "the temperature , @xmath21 , and emission measure , em , were calculated from the sxr fluxes by means of the standard goes software .",
    "the number density , @xmath22 , was estimated as @xmath23 , with a volume @xmath24 . to find the area , @xmath25 , we used the dimensions of the sxr - emitting source evaluated by from rhessi images .",
    "the pressure , @xmath5 , steadily rose until a maximum at 07:33:44 , and then started to gradually decrease .",
    "the half - height duration of the gradual pressure pulse was about 18  min .",
    "these characteristics of the flare pressure rule out its significance in the initiation of either the eruption or the wave , whose estimated onset time , @xmath26  07:29:00 , is marked in figure  [ f-20110224_kinematics ] with the dotted line .",
    "a similar relation between the wave onset and flare pressure was shown for different events by .",
    "they also presented the reasons why the flare - ignition of shocks is not expected , in general .",
    "the eruptive prominence underwent an impulsive acceleration up to @xmath27 .",
    "this spurt produced a wave disturbance with an onset time @xmath28 .",
    "the disturbance traveled about 150  mm with an average plane - of - the - sky speed of @xmath10  km  s@xmath11 ( the arrow in figure  [ f-20110224_kinematics]a ) , at 07:30:30 arrived at the arcade loop , which gradually expanded above the prominence , and accelerated its lift - off .    with the active role of the prominence , whose eruption presented presumable completion of the flux rope formation , the overlying arcade expanded , being initially driven from inside .",
    "generally , the top part of an arcade is associated with a magnetic separatrix surface , which does not allow plasmas to be transposed inside from outside .",
    "the right panels of figure  [ f-20110224_sdo_images ] show that the compression region of swept - up plasmas on top of the expanding arcade evolved .",
    "a similar conclusion was drawn by from the analysis of a different event .",
    "the initial speed of the disturbance above the active - region core must be equal to the fast - mode speed ( @xmath29 ) , to which the estimated value of @xmath30  km  s@xmath11 seems to correspond .",
    "when the wave front left the region of high @xmath29 , such a high - speed wave must become strongly nonlinear and could rapidly steepen into a shock of a moderate intensity @xcite .",
    "if the shock discontinuity was formed before the passage of the wave through the arcade , then its speed should change abruptly ( the blue dashed curves in figures [ f-20110224_kinematics]a[f-20110224_kinematics]c ) ; otherwise , the kinematical curves should be smoother . as mentioned , we can not distinguish between the two options from the observations .",
    "on the other hand , all of the measured components of the non - radial eruption reached the speeds of , at least , @xmath31  km  s@xmath11 in the field of view of aia ( @xmath32  km  s@xmath11 ) .",
    "such a speed of an ejecta above quiet - sun regions , where @xmath29 is considerably lower , is sufficient to produce a bow shock .",
    "the presence of a shock is confirmed by the appearance of a type ii burst ( figure  [ f-20110224_spectrum]b ) . to understand the history of the shock wave , we consider its properties suggested by the type ii burst and a propagating ` euv wave ' .",

    "the spectrum is complex .",
    "it shows a series of type  iii bursts , of which first three groups correspond to the microwave peaks .",
    "two branches of a type  iv emission are present : a quasi - stationary type  iv burst around 800  mhz , and a drifting type  iv , whose emission was strongest at 400200  mhz ( red ) .",

    "a rather strong type  ii burst , overlapping with an intense series of type  iiis , sharply started at 07:34 and became clearer after 07:37 .",
    "we invoke the idea of that a type ii emission originates in a coronal streamer , being caused by a shock front compressing its current sheet , thus producing a flare - like process running along the streamer .",
    "a particularity of the burst in figure  [ f-20110224_spectrum]b is a feature with a reverse drift from 100 to 200 mhz visible during 07:3407:36 ( dashed curve ) .",
    "a parallel dashed curve at 50100 mhz outlines its possible fundamental - emission counterpart , which is difficult to detect in the figure .",
    "the reversely drifting feature looks mirrored relative to the normal drift .",

    "the contact site of the shock front with the streamer bifurcates and moves into opposite directions ( figure  [ f - wave_cartoon ] ) . while propagating into a higher - density medium , a shock wave strongly dampens .",
    "therefore , such reversely - drifting features are usually marginal .",

    "the filament underwent an acceleration of 0.5  km  s@xmath15 around 02:17:00 , and sharply ( @xmath64 km  s@xmath15 ) accelerated again at 02:22:05 @xmath65  s to a final velocity of @xmath66  s@xmath11 , which did not change after 02:25 .",

    "initially , the oval on top of the arcade was not sharp , and the uncertainties were larger , about 15  mm . according to the fit in figure  [ f-20110511_kinematics ] , the arcade expansion accelerated from @xmath68 km  s@xmath11 to @xmath69 km  s@xmath11 .",
    "the observations allow us to estimate only the upper limit for the duration of the acceleration and the lower limit for its maximum of @xmath70 km  s@xmath15 . similarly to the situation in event  i , the use of a considerably stronger acceleration does not result in a pronounced difference in the outline of the arcade in the images .",
    "the center time of the acceleration is certain , 02:25:30  @xmath71  s.    the sequence of phenomena presented in figure  [ f-20110511_kinematics ] is similar to event  i ( _ cf .",

    "all of the images are progressively resized according to the measured kinematics , to keep the size of the eruption unchanged .",

    "the cme body was slow ( 465  km  s@xmath11 , as we showed ) , and the shock wave eventually decayed into a weak disturbance .",
    "the different speeds of the cme bodies determined the different wave evolutions in the two events , although their origins were similar .",
    "the chain of phenomena observed in events i and ii suggest the following scenario .",
    "the activation of a filament in the initiation phase precedes the flare , being probably related to heating in the filament or / and its coronal environment .",
    "these processes , which respond in a gradual rise of the sxr emission ( event  i ) , commence the final formation of an eruptive flux rope .",
    "the initial rise of the filament stretches magnetic threads passing through its body and ending at the solar surface , so that they cross each other and form a cusp - like configuration ( events i and ii ) above the future flare site .",
    "the cusp is constituted by quasi - antiparallel magnetic fields , which start to reconnect .",
    "this results in heating in this region ( event  ii ) . a violent mhd instability ( probably , the torus one , event  i ) develops , increasing the acceleration of the filament .",
    "the flare develops , being slightly delayed after the filament acceleration ( event  i ) .",
    "the sharply accelerating filament i )  forces the magnetic structures above it to expand , and ii )  produces a substantial mhd disturbance , which rapidly steepens into a blast - wave - like shock",
    ". then the acceleration of the filament ceases , its magnetic structure relaxes , and its combination with the structures expanding above it constitute a cme . eventually , the shock ahead of the cme either changes to the bow - shock regime , if the cme is fast ( event  i ) , or decays otherwise ( event  ii ) .",
    "its flanks and rear propagate freely .",
    "this picture of a flare - related eruption seems to be different from non - active - region eruptions of quiescent filaments .",
    "a low - lying progenitor of a flux rope often shows up as a pre - eruption filament ( prominence ) .",
    "it is frequently considered as a passive part of a larger flux rope , whose expansion creates a cme .",
    "by contrast , a pre - eruption filament in an ar carries large electric currents , as the linear force - free approach ( @xmath88 ) confirms .",
    "the density of the electric current is proportional to the magnetic field strength , being typically larger near the solar surface .",
    "the development of an mhd current - driven instability ( kink or torus ) is only possible , if the distribution of the @xmath0 parameter is inhomogeneous .",
    "even in the situation of the non - linear force - free magnetic field , the major current - carrying part of a flux rope is expected in its bottom part , _",
    "i.e. _ , in a low - lying structure like a pre - eruption filament , where @xmath89 is maximum .",
    "thus , a filament ( or its analog ) in an active region appears to be the major progenitor of the eruptive flux rope , whose instability increment is governed by stronger , lower , smaller - scale magnetic fields , while the influence of the weaker , larger - scale environment is less important .",
    "the magnetic field and plasma continuously occupy the whole magnetic environment of an ar .",
    "they are topologically bounded by the separatrix surface , which confines the coronal cavity surrounding a prominence , and probably develops later into the frontal structure of a cme .",
    "the cavity is similar to a magnetic ` cocoon ' enveloping the pre - eruptive filament and consisting of sheared current - carrying loops , which are rooted in the photosphere .",
    "the cavity is traditionally identified with a ` perfect ' magnetic flux rope , which is only rooted in the photosphere by two ends , being disconnected elsewhere .",
    "a real pre - eruption filament has numerous lateral connections to the photosphere with its threads ( barbs ) on both sides of the magnetic neutral line .",
    "the perfect flux rope not yet exists ; its progenitor is the magnetic structure of the filament inside the magnetic cocoon .",
    "their combination is the initial structure in the cshkp model , in which magnetic loops of the expanding cocoon stretch out , reconnect under the eruptive filament , and form the expanding flux rope .",
    "the eruptive filament is located inside the cocoon ; its external boundary is the separatrix surface .",
    "the joint expansion of all of these structures is observed as a cme .    in our consideration , the formation of the perfect flux rope is necessary to trigger the main stage of the ` standard ' flare .",
    "the flux rope starts to form from breaking its lateral connections to the photosphere leading to the formation of primary flare ribbons by reconnection between the filament threads crossing each other , rather than cshkp - reconnection of magnetic field lines , which initially were not shared by the filament .",
    "the opposite - polarity magnetic field of the filament threads , which participate in the primary reconnection , pass through the body of the filament and embrace it , being its intrinsic components .",
    "the primary reconnection is not a simple reconnection of a single pair of flux tubes , as in the tether cutting model .",
    "instead , this is a wavelike series of reconnection events between the threads , running along the filament and the polarity inversion line .    in non - active - region eruptions of quiescent filaments , which are easier to observe , the increments of an instability ( _ e.g. _ , a torus one ) corresponding to the filament and cocoon should not be much different from each other .",
    "the filament and the larger cocoon expand jointly as a single , self - similar cme structure practically from the very start .",
    "the radial profile of the plasma velocity inside the cme is linear relative to the expansion center .",
    "these circumstances produce an impression of a passive role of the filament in the eruptive process .",
    "eruptions of large quiescent filaments might produce shocks far from the sun , but unlikely in the low corona .",
    "the situation is different , if a cme forms in an ar , where the eruptive filament initially moves considerably earlier and faster , than the structures above it .",
    "the expansion of the developing flare - related cme is not self - similar at this stage .",
    "the intensity of a disturbance produced by an impulsively erupting flux rope , that develops from the filament , is proportional to the squared accelerations , with which its major and minor radii increase .",
    "the sharpest portion in the velocity profile of the disturbance propagating away from such a piston forms approximately at the same time as its acceleration reaches its maximum . a discontinuity starts to form at this place .",
    "@xmath29 is high above an ar and steeply falls off both upward and laterally . while propagating in such medium ,",
    "the leading wave packets of the spheroidal mhd disturbance decelerate , being rapidly overtaken by trailing ones .",
    "this process produces a ` jam ' effect , which distorts the disturbance profile .",
    "the wave becomes strongly nonlinear ( see figure  [ f - shock_scenario ] ) , and the discontinuity of a moderate intensity is formed in @xmath90  s @xcite .",
    "the expansion of the arcade above the erupting flux rope is initially passive and occurs due to the deformation of magnetic fields surrounding the developing flux rope .",
    "when passing through the arcade , the shock front somewhat accelerates its expansion and runs afterwards ahead of the developing cme like a decelerating blast wave .",
    "the expanding cme bubble bounded by the outer separatrix surface extrudes surrounding magnetoplasmas almost omnidirectionally , thus forming an extensive compression zone around it .",
    "the front of this zone is a weak discontinuity expanding with the ambient @xmath29 . within this zone @xmath29 is higher than the ambient one before the event .",
    "the growing layer of the compressed plasma on top of the cme bubble makes its boundary visible .",
    "the compressed oval layers might be a rather common phenomenon , disclosing developing cmes ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , ) .",
    "such bright ovals could occasionally be observed by soho / eit as sharp ` s - waves ' , although the probability to catch them with eit was low ( 7% according to ) due to its insufficient imaging rate . as an ` s - wave ' can actually be the compressed plasma layer swept - up by a gradually expanding arcade , relating ` s - waves ' to shock waves ( _ e.g. , _ ) might be not correct .",
    "the brightenings associated with the near - surface parts of the separatrix surfaces , or ` quasi - stationary eit waves ' , appear to represent the ` field - stretching ' effects @xcite .",
    "an example is a brightening south from the eruption site in event  ii , around @xmath91 $ ] from the solar disk center .",
    "it is visible in the left panel of the 20110511_aia_193_eruption.mpg movie .",
    "the traveling ` euvi waves ' in events i and ii were , most likely , near - surface skirts of the expanding domes of mhd shock waves , in agreement with and . their mhd - wave nature is confirmed by their velocities , reflection phenomena , and accordance of their propagation up to very large distances ( more than the solar hemisphere in event  i ) with the fast - mode speed distribution .",
    "these facts is difficult to reconcile with non - wave interpretations , such as the mentioned field - stretching model of or the interchange - reconnection model of . while alternative interpretations of ` euv waves ' ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , ; for a review ) are mostly focused on near - surface phenomena , we established in events i and ii the kinematic correspondence between them , the trajectories and structures of type ii bursts , and the cme expansion .    the shock front ahead of the cme gains energy from the trailing ` piston ' , which spends it to sweep up plasmas .",
    "thus , the shock front kinematically resembles a self - similar blast wave propagating in plasma with a density falloff @xmath92 , close to the saito model . for the shock propagation along the solar surface",
    ", @xmath93 might be expected , but this is not the case due to the radial inhomogeneity of the solar corona ( see , section 4.5 ) .",
    "the kinematics of the shock front , which is not followed by a separatrix surface laterally , can formally be described with @xmath94 .",
    "the results of this approach are close to the modeled shock propagation @xcite .",
    "the rapidly decelerating near - surface portion of the wave front can be observed in the h@xmath0 line as a fast moreton wave , usually not far from the eruption site , and as a slower ` eit wave ' in euv at larger distances .",
    "having encountered a coronal streamer , the shock front compresses its current sheet causing magnetic reconnection there .",
    "the cumulation effect intensifies the flare - like process running along the streamer .",
    "a type ii burst appears ( see figure  [ f - wave_cartoon ] ) .    the bow shock continuously driven by the outer surface of a super - alfvnic cme ( see , _",
    "e.g_. , ; ) can be actualized in the case of a supersonic plasma flow around the outer surface of the cme bubble .",
    "two conditions are important for this regime : i )  the existence of a stagnation point in the plasma flow on the surface of the body , and ii )  the velocity of the stagnation point must exceed the ambient @xmath29 .",
    "such a plasma flow does not yet exist at the early cme formation stage . in the bow - shock regime ,",
    "the cme size and speed ( @xmath95 ) determine the position and intensity of the stationary shock ahead of the cme .",
    "the bow - shock problem does not consider the kinematical differences of the structural cme components preceding the appearance of the shock , including the large difference of their accelerations from the self - similar regime . with strong accelerations measured for the impulsively erupting filaments in events i and ii , the impulsive - piston mechanism excited shock waves effectively and rapidly .",
    "the kinematics of the whole cme determines whether or not the frontal portion of the wave transforms into the bow shock afterwards .    the cme frontal structure in event  ii had a nearly constant speed of 465  km  s@xmath11 up to @xmath96 , unlikely exceeding the alfv ' en speed ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , ) .",
    "the shock wave quasi - freely propagated well ahead of the cme , being detectable up to @xmath87 in figure  [ f - lasco_wave ] , where it decelerated to @xmath97  km  s@xmath11 , comparable to the solar wind speed .",
    "this shock wave eventually decayed into a weak disturbance .",
    "by contrast , the blast - wave - like shock impulsively excited in event  i later showed indications of its approach to the bow - shock regime , even when propagating over the solar surface . the transition into a bow shock at large distances from the sun was anticipated by @xcite ( @xcite ) . the early appearance of the bow shock in event  i was favored by the conspicuously non - radial motion of the eruption and its high speed , which was rapidly reached at a small height . as a result , the rapidly moving southwest part of the ` euv wave ' in later euvi images of this event probably was a near - surface trail of a bow shock",
    ".    the deceleration of coronal transients can be due to different forces .",
    "they are the gravity and magnetic tension of structures , which remain anchored on the sun .",
    "the plasma extrusion by the expanding cme and the aerodynamic drag from the solar wind flowing around the cme ( _ e.g. _ , ; ) also spend its energy .",
    "we can not distinguish which retarding force dominated at each stage and to detect the transition from one deceleration regime to another .",
    "presumably , the cme core decelerated in event  ii ( figures [ f - cme]d[f - cme]f ) mainly due to the magnetic tension ; deceleration due to the plasma extrusion dominated during the initial extra - radial expansion of the cmes ; and the aerodynamic drag was significant in the bow - shock regime .    one more consequence of the plasma extrusion by expanding cmes is the development of dimming . the brightness in euv and sxr images is proportional to the column emission measure , _",
    "i.e. _ , the squared density . the cme expansion alone results in a dramatic rarefaction of the involved volume observed as dimming . a strong pressure gradient appears and causes a secondary plasma outflow in the footprint regions of a cme @xcite .",
    "the utmost velocity of the outflow is limited by the sound speed @xcite .",
    "the observations considered in sections [ s - e1 ] and [ s - e2 ] appear to confirm the scenario of incorporated into the cshkp model with further elaborations mentioned in section  [ s - introduction ] .",
    "the results update the model and specify the flare  cme relations , as well as the excitation and evolution of associated shock waves .",
    "the observations indicate that the flare arcade starts to form from the threads of the filament body .",
    "this implies involvement in the eruptive - flare reconnection processes of considerably lesser - height , _",
    "i.e. _ , stronger magnetic fields with higher gradients .",
    "this can help to understand some observational challenges .",
    "the flux ropes were found by to be mainly formed via reconnection process , and independent of pre - existing filaments , whose role was unclear .",
    "our results indicate that flux ropes form in the same way from their filament - like progenitors , while the possibility to observe a filament depends on its predominant temperature and density and , possibly , other conditions .",
    "all observational facts considered here confirm that we dealt with fast mhd shock waves , initially excited in the low corona by sharply erupting flux ropes , and neither by a flare pressure pulse nor by the outer surface of a cme .",
    "the initial impulsive - piston shock excitation during the early flare rise was responsible , with minor variations , for the shocks observed in a number of different events , ranging from the goes b class up to the x class (; @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the concept , which related the source of a type ii emission to the current sheet of a coronal streamer stressed by a shock front , has accounted for the structural features of the observed type ii bursts .",
    "the evolution of shock waves and their manifestations in euv and white - light images , and dynamic radio spectra , have been quantitatively reconciled with each other .",
    "they get further confirmation from a recent study of .",
