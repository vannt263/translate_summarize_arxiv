    "an oil well producing at low temperatures may experience large pressure drops due to high viscosity of oil and wax forming .",
    "one way to avoid these pressure drops is heating of oil by hot water recycling .",
    "the tubing is surrounded by two annulus for water circulation .",
    "hot water is injected into inner annulus and it flows out of the system through the outer annulus .",
    "the main technical concern is minimization of energy lost in the system while keeping oil temperature sufficiently high .",
    "configuration just described will be called counter flow exchange .",
    "if the hot water is injected into outer annulus and leaves the system through inner annulus , then we talk about parallel heat flow exchange .",
    "counter flow heat exchange    the outline of the paper is as follows . in the first section we present a simple one - dimensional mathematical model describing the heat exchange in the system .",
    "we present only counter flow configuration since parallel flow configuration differs only in signs of water velocities .",
    "solvability of a system of integro - differential equations describing the heat exchange is discussed in the second section .",
    "it is shown that the result of artola @xcite can be applied . in final section",
    "we discuss numerical method for solution approximation and present some numerical results for counter flow and parallel flow configurations .",
    "a problem similar to this one was considered in engineering literature in @xcite .",
    "cross - sectional mean velocities of oil and water in inner and outer annulus will be denoted by @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 . they are assumed to be constant , and therefore the fluids have constant pressure drops .",
    "furthermore , to simplify the model , we neglect friction and we take mass densities @xmath3 ( oil ) , @xmath4 ( water ) to be constant .",
    "the heat is transferred between the tubing , inner and outer annulus and the formation according to newton s law .    with these simplifying assumptions and taking direction of @xmath5 axis",
    "vertically downwards , we obtain the following three parabolic equations ( see @xcite for example ) :    @xmath6 + b_o(t_o - t_i ) & = d_o \\frac{\\partial^2 t_o}{\\partial z^2 } \\label{eq:1}\\\\ a_i[\\frac{\\partial t_i}{\\partial t}+v_i \\frac{\\partial t_i}{\\partial z } ]   + b_o ( t_i - t_o ) + b_e ( t_i - t_e ) & = d_i \\frac{\\partial^2 t_i}{\\partial z^2 } \\label{eq:2}\\\\ a_e[\\frac{\\partial t_e}{\\partial t}-v_e \\frac{\\partial t_e}{\\partial z } ]   + b_e ( t_e - t_i ) + b_f ( t_e - t_f )   & = d_e \\frac{\\partial^2 t_e}{\\partial z^2 } , \\label{eq:3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the main variables are the temperatures of oil , water in inner annulus , water in outer annulus and the temperature of the formation , denoted respectively by @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "all coefficients are constant and they have the following meaning : @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are cross - sectional areas and @xmath19 , @xmath20 are heat capacities . by @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are denoted heat transfer coefficients from newton s law , and by @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 thermal conductivities , multiplied by cross - section areas . in counter flow exchange all three fluid velocities are positive . from mass conservation",
    "it follows @xmath27 .",
    "heat flow in surrounding formation is assumed to be radial with respect to the tubing and to have constant ( geothermal ) gradient in vertical direction .",
    "we denote by @xmath28 geothermal temperature and by @xmath29 the temperature in the soil .",
    "formation temperature @xmath12 is then given by @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is formation radius .",
    "the temperature @xmath32 is the solution of the heat equation with initial temperature @xmath33 , temperature at infinity equal to @xmath33 , and prescribed heat flux @xmath34 at @xmath35 . in the other hand ,",
    "@xmath34 is given by newton s law @xmath36 then , by applying duhamel s principle we can represent formation temperature by the formula @xmath37",

    "we assume given the temperatures of entering water at @xmath60 and oil at @xmath61 .",
    "at the bottom of inner and outer annulus we have equality of water temperatures and continuity of total thermal flux .",
    "therefore , we take @xmath62 for all @xmath63 , where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are given .",
    "the initial conditions are @xmath66 where function @xmath67 satisfies compatibility conditions @xmath68 , @xmath69 and it is close to geothermal temperature @xmath33 .",
    "all functions involved are supposed to be smooth .",
    "we consider variational formulation of the problem ( [ eq:1 ] ) , ( [ eq:2 ] ) and ( [ eq:4 ] ) with boundary and initial conditions ( [ bc-1])([ic-1 ] ) . without lose of generality we can consider homogeneous boundary conditions @xmath70 .",
    "we introduce hilbert space @xmath71 with the norm @xmath72 inherited from @xmath73 and bilinear forms @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 over @xmath77 defined as follows : for @xmath78 , @xmath79 we set @xmath80 @xmath81 duality between @xmath82 and @xmath83 will be given by the formula @xmath84 where @xmath85 is of the form @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and brackets at the right hand side signify duality between @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "we set @xmath90 , with usual norm denoted by @xmath91 , and by identifying @xmath92 with its dual we have @xmath93 , with dense and continuous injections .",
    "furthermore , by @xmath94 we denote the space of all functions from @xmath95 with time derivative in @xmath96 .",
    "it is well known that @xmath94 is continuously embedded in @xmath97;h)$ ] .",
    "with this notations we can reformulate the problem ( [ eq:1 ] ) , ( [ eq:2 ] ) , ( [ eq:4 ] ) , ( [ bc-1])([ic-1 ] ) in the following variational problem : find @xmath98 such that @xmath99 and for a.e .",
    "@xmath8 @xmath100 the linear form on the right hand side is given by @xmath101 and it is obviously continuous .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath102 is continuous bilinear form on @xmath83 which satisfy @xmath103 with some constants @xmath104 .",
    "bilinear form @xmath105 comes from perturbation operator @xmath58 .",
    "it is not difficult to see that for any function @xmath106 it holds @xmath107 where @xmath108 .",
    "from here it follows that @xmath58 is linear and continuous operator from @xmath109 to itself , and it has the following continuity property : if @xmath110 are such that @xmath111 then @xmath112 furthermore , it is easy to see that @xmath58 is an operator of _ local type _ , as defined in artola @xcite , and therefore we can apply theorem 1 from @xcite and conclude :    variational problem ( [ var - pr ] ) has a unique solution @xmath98 for any @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "in this section we discuss numerical approximation by finite difference method of the problem ( [ eq:1 ] ) , ( [ eq:2 ] ) , ( [ eq:4 ] ) , ( [ bc-1])([ic-1 ] ) .",
    "instead of using equation ( [ eq:4 ] ) we find more convenient to apply finite difference method to the equations ( [ eq:1 ] ) , ( [ eq:2 ] ) , ( [ eq:3 ] ) and to discretize directly equations ( [ formation ] ) and ( [ int - eq ] ) .",
    "we avoid numerical resolution of problem ( [ radial ] ) by the use of hasan and kabir @xcite approximation : @xmath115 where @xmath116    furthermore , in our problem constants @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are very small and it is natural to consider hyperbolic system ( @xmath117 ) instead of parabolic one . due to limited space",
    "we will not enter here into discussion of existence theory for hyperbolic system .",
    "we just note that any difference scheme adapted to hyperbolic version of the system ( [ eq:1])([eq:3 ] ) will produce certain amount of numerical dispersion that will _ cover _ thermal diffusion in equations ( [ eq:1])([eq:3 ] ) , at least for reasonable mesh sizes .",
    "therefore we chose to neglect thermal diffusion and consequently to drop superfluous neumann boundary conditions for oil and water in outer annulus .",
    "this will generally change the solution just in corresponding boundary layers .",
    "we apply explicit finite difference scheme of first order with convective terms treated by _",
    "upwinding_. in all the experiments we have used a uniform grid in space and time .",
    "the spatial step @xmath118 and time step @xmath119 are related by the fixed positive number @xmath120 through relation @xmath121 .    in discretization of integral equation ( [ int - eq ] )",
    "we use composite trapezoidal rule which gives the following procedure for calculation of formation temperature at @xmath122 and @xmath123 : @xmath124 as a consequence of the convolution in formula ( [ int - eq ] ) we see that the solution on next time level includes the solutions on all previous time levels .    it can be shown that that described explicit scheme is tvb ( total variation bounded ) and @xmath125-stable if the following cfl condition is satisfied : @xmath126 where @xmath127 is certain constant that can be calculated from the coefficients in ( [ eq:1])([eq:3 ] ) .",
    "we now proceed with some numerical results . to evaluate the merits of one flow arrangement over another ( counter flow and parallel flow )",
    ", some conditions must be equal .",
    "the interval of time during which the water is cooled is not equal to the interval of time during which the water is heated .",
    "the sum of these time intervals we call circulating period or cycle .",
    "both method can now be compared using the same circulating period .",
    "results of our simulations after four cycles are presented in the figure fig .",
    "2 . counter flow heat exchange temperature calculations are shown on the left figure .",
    "the tubing temperature is almost always less then inner and greater than outer annulus temperature .",
    "parallel flow heat exchange temperature calculations are shown on the right figure .",
    "the tubing temperature lies between the inner annulus temperature and formation temperature . in this case oil temperature is lower than any annulus temperature . besides , formation temperature is higher than in the previous case .",
    "tubing temperature as well as outer annulus temperature reach very soon almost constant level .",
    "the important thing to note with respect to the bottom - hole fluid temperature is that this temperature continually changes with time .",
    "a steady - state condition is never attained .",
    "hence the stabilization of both outlet temperatures does not mean that all of the temperatures in the circulating system are constant .",
    "temperature calculation , left for counter flow heat exchange and right for parallel flow heat exchange .",

    "it is not difficult to implement it in a computer code and it gives certain _ initial _ estimate of heat exchange in the system . yet ,",
    "important physical processes , such as dissipation due to friction and variations of viscosities and mass densities with the temperature , are not taken into account .",
