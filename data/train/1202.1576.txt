    "finding objects at high redshifts is of fundamental importance in observational cosmology . by doing so , we are probing closer to the first galaxies and black holes in the universe , and therefore ever closer to the initial conditions for the formation of galaxies and structures . at the present time",
    ", we do not know when galaxies first formed , nor how quickly they can grow in mass during their extreme youth . because @xmath11 is the epoch that marks the end of the reionization , finding objects at @xmath0 will provide crucial constraints on the source of ionizing photons , as well as in the early assembly history of galaxies and black holes .    the last decade or so has bore witness to an explosive growth in the discovery of galaxies or galaxy candidates at @xmath12 , pushing our understanding of galaxy formation to ever earlier epochs after the big bang .",

    "the continuum emissions of the laes provided by category ( 1 ) are usually too faint to be detected even photometrically ; and so their uv star - formation rate and the continuum luminosity function ( lf ) of these objects can not be derived .",
    "after hst / wfc3 was launched , the sample size of category ( 2 ) increased rapidly and now dominates the @xmath14 sample .",
    "given the limited survey field sizes , however , these studies mainly focus on very faint samples as the probability of finding luminous but rare objects are small .",

    "we initiated the taiwan ecdfs near - infrared survey ( tenis ) in 2007 .",
    "the goal of this project is to obtain deep @xmath2 and @xmath3 images in the ecdfs , and thus fill in the big wavelength gap between @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",

    "the scientific goal of the tenis @xmath2-band observation is to search for the most luminous high-@xmath7 objects ( i.e. , this work ) , which are rare and thus require a survey over a large field to be found , while the tenis @xmath3-band observation is for the studies of the mass assembly history and sub - millimeter galaxies at @xmath31 .",
    "after combined with existing deep images in the optical and 3.6 - 8@xmath15 , the tenis data can be used to derive robust photometric redshifts and stellar masses of a large sample of galaxies .",
    "therefore the tenis dataset is unique not only in its depth and survey area but also in its rich multi - wavelength ancillary data in the ecdfs .",
    "the tenis data were taken using the wide - field infrared camera ( wircam , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) .",
    "wircam consists of four 2048@xmath322048 hawaii2-rg detectors covering field of view of @xmath33 with a @xmath34 pixel scale . to date",
    "we have spent 44 hours in @xmath2 and 40 hours in @xmath3 .",

    "more details of the wircam imaging observations is described in the tenis catalogue paper ( hsieh et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "we obtained @xmath30 data in the ecdfs using the subaru moircs in 09b .",
    "the observation is a follow - up observation of the tenis project .",
    "the goal of the observation is to have @xmath30-band photometry for a set of high-@xmath7 objects pre - selected using their @xmath39 colors .",
    "two pointings were planned to be observed .",
    "one is inside the goods - s field and the other is outside the goods - s field .",
    "however , due to the bad weather , only one pointing on the east side of the ecdfs was observed , i.e. , a @xmath40 area outside the goods - s field .",
    "the @xmath5 limiting magnitude for point sources is 25.5 .",
    "although the @xmath30 data are only available for part of the ecdfs , the data are still very important to further improve the photometric redshift quality for the candidates in that area since the wavelength of @xmath30 band is right between those of @xmath20 and @xmath2 .",
    "the tenis @xmath2 and @xmath3 data were processed using an interactive data language ( idl ) based reduction pipeline called simple imaging and mosaicking pipeline .",
    "the details of the pipeline are described in @xcite .",
    "we used the pipeline to deal with flat - fielding , removing instrumental features like crosstalk and residual images from saturated objects in previous exposures , masking satellite trails , distortion and astrometry correction , mosaicking and stacking images , and photometric calibration .",
    "the zero - point calibration was done by matching the fluxes in an aperture of @xmath41 in diameter with those in the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) point source catalogs .",
    "we used sextractor version 2.5.0 @xcite to detect objects and measure their fluxes in the wircam images .",
    "for the tenis @xmath2 image , we used the `` flux_auto '' values of the sextractor output as the measured @xmath2 fluxes .",
    "the flux errors provided by sextractor do not include the correlated errors .",
    "therefore we calibrated the errors with the following procedure : first , the fluxes and the flux errors were re - measured using sextractor with a @xmath42 diameter aperture .",
    "we then convolved the source - masked image with a @xmath42 diameter aperture , and calculated the rms around each pixel on the convolved images .",
    "the ratio between the aperture photometric flux error provided by sextractor for a certain object and the rms value around the same position in the convolved image is the correction factor of the flux error for that object .",
    "the median value of the correction factors was computed to be the general correction factor for all the sources . for @xmath2-band data ,",
    "the general correction factor is 0.793 .",
    "the same procedures were done with different aperture sizes .",
    "we find that the correction factors are very stable with different aperture sizes , which is consistent with the experience in wang et al .",
    "therefore we just applied the factor to the `` fluxerr_auto '' values for all the tenis @xmath2 objects to calibrate their flux errors .",
    "for the tenis @xmath3 image , the double - image mode of sextractor was performed to generate a @xmath2-selected @xmath3 photometric catalogue .",
    "in order to use the double - image mode , we shifted the @xmath3 image to match to the @xmath2 image .",
    "the @xmath3 fluxes were also measured with the `` flux_auto '' option , and the flux errors were calibrated with the same procedure used in the tenis @xmath2 data .    to estimate the completeness for our data ,",
    "we used a monte - carlo simulation .",
    "the faint objects are compact but may not be all point - like .",
    "the medium full width half maximum ( fwhms ) of objects with @xmath43 is about @xmath44 ( @xmath45 kpc at @xmath11 ) .",
    "therefore , to better determine the completeness of faint objects , we randomly put 100 artificial sources into the tenis @xmath2 image , with an image that is averaged from @xmath46 real extended sources with fwhms between @xmath44 and @xmath47 , and with signal - to - noise ratios greater than 100 .",
    "the magnitudes of the artificial sources are uniformly distributed in the magnitude space from 20mag to 27mag , and poisson errors were added into the images of the artificial sources .",
    "we then ran sextractor to do object finding .",
    "this procedure was run for 1000 times to deliver the detection rate of these artificial sources in each magnitude bin , i.e. , the completeness .",
    "figure  [ completeness ] shows that the surface density vs. apparent magnitude of the tenis @xmath2 data . the completeness corrected surface density is used in our analyses later .",
    "we incorporated data from several ecdfs surveys at different wavelengths to perform our analyses . to measure accurate colors for the color selection ,",
    "we processed the images from the ancillary data to generate new images that are pixel - to - pixel matched to the tenis images . for the space - based optical images , we also matched their psfs to the tenis data to ensure better color measurements . in this subsection",
    ", we describe how we processed the ancillary data and measured fluxes .",
    "the musyc team has released their deep optical and near - infrared images in the ecdfs .",
    "to improve the quality of the photometric redshifts , which will help eliminate foreground contaminations in our study , we included the musyc optical data in our analyses .",
    "we resampled the musyc images in @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath7 , and @xmath54 to match the tenis @xmath2 image , and then used the double - image mode of sextractor with `` flux_auto '' to generate a tenis @xmath2-selected musyc photometric catalogue .",
    "the zero - point calibration was done by matching the fluxes with those in the published @xmath55-selected musyc catalogue @xcite .",
    "the flux errors of the musyc photometry were calibrated using the method described in ",
    "[ photometry ] .",
    "the gems project @xcite provides deep hst acs images with the @xmath56 and @xmath20 filters in the ecdfs , except some small areas close to bright objects .",
    "the @xmath5 limiting magnitudes for point sources are 28.4 and 27.1 for @xmath56 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "we mosaicked the public gems acs images and then resampled the images to match the tenis @xmath2 image .",
    "the psfs of the acs images are very small compared to the psfs of the wircam images .",
    "to derive better color measurements between the acs filters and @xmath2 , we applied a smoothing kernel to the acs images to match their psfs to that of the tenis @xmath2 image .",
    "we then repeated the same procedure as what we did for the musyc data to deliver the @xmath2-selected gems photometric catalogue with calibrated flux errors .",
    "the simple project @xcite provides deep irac observations covering the entire ecdfs with the @xmath16 goods - s irac mosaics in its center @xcite .",
    "we mosaicked the simple images and resampled them to match the tenis @xmath2 image . for the flux measurement ,",
    "however , we could not use sextractor in the double - image mode with the `` flux_auto '' option to generate the @xmath2-selected irac photometric catalogue , since the psfs of irac images are about @xmath57 to @xmath44 arcsec , which are much larger than that of the tenis @xmath2 image .",
    "if we were to do this , the irac fluxes would be seriously under - estimated as sextractor uses the aperture size estimated from the reference image ( tenis @xmath2 image ) to measure the fluxes on the target image ( simple irac images ) .",
    "one can use sextractor in the double - image mode with the standard aperture photometry to measure the irac fluxes , and then apply the aperture correction values provided in the irac data handbook ( chapter 5 , table 5.7 ) to derive the estimated irac total fluxes .",
    "however , due to the very large psfs of irac images , using simple aperture photometry to measure the fluxes of deep irac images in a relatively crowded field like the ecdfs has serious confusion issues and the local background estimation used in aperture photometry can be easily affected by neighboring objects .",
    "we note that the accuracy of the irac photometry is critical in our analyses ( see   [ sample ] ) , requiring an alternative method to estimate the irac fluxes properly .",
    "many intensive efforts have gone into developing methods for estimating fluxes in an image with a large psf ( image1 , hereafter ) .",
    "the most recent method relies on utilizing the morphological information from a high quality image in another band ( image2 , hereafter ) , ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "by assuming the intrinsic morphology of objects are identical in the two wavelengths ( i.e. , no color gradient from its center to edge ) , one is able to use the psf of image2 to deconvolve that image , and then convolve the deconvolved image2 with the psf of image1 .",
    "the scaling factor that needs to be applied to match the peak values between an object in image2 and the same object in the processed image1 is the flux ratio ( color ) of that object .",
    "the assumption that there is no color gradient , however , does not always stand .",
    "we have therefore developed a new method that is quite different from what has been used , but is very similar to the traditional clean deconvolution in radio imaging .",
    "we used the tenis @xmath2 image as a prior image ( i.e. , image2 ) to estimate the fluxes in the irac images ( i.e. , image1 ) .",
    "the segmentation map of the tenis @xmath2 image generated by sextractor with a @xmath58 threshold preserves the information of what pixels are attributed to each object , and it provides the positional and shape / boundary information of each object when deconvolving the irac images .",
    "we only used the boundary information rather than the full morphological information adopted in previous works .",
    "the boundary information introduced with the segmentation map is often called the `` clean window '' in radio image .",
    "the irac psfs were generated using bright isolated irac point sources in each irac channel .",
    "the size of the psf images is @xmath59 . due to",
    "the non - spherical irac psf and different orientations of @xmath60 in the observing epochs for goods - s and simple , the psfs of the stacked irac image in goods - s region is very different from those in the extended area .",
    "we tried to use the psf generated from the simple data to deconvolve the goods - s region and found that the fluctuation of the residual image ( see the next paragraph for the detail of the residual image ) is 5 times larger ( i.e. , @xmath61 mag worse in limiting magnitude ) as compared to the result using the psf generated from the goods - s data itself .",
    "we therefore generated an individual psf for each region and deconvolved the two regions separatedly .",
    "the deconvolution process always starts at the pixel with the highest value measured within a 9 pixel aperture in diameter ( @xmath62 , hereafter ) , and this pixel must have been registered to one object in the @xmath2 segmentation map . since the simple image ( @xmath63 per pixel ) has been resampled to match the tenis @xmath2-band image ( @xmath64 per pixel ) , simply moving a window ( i.e. , @xmath62 ) across the simple image to find the location of a peak is very similar to do a sub - pixel centering .",
    "once this pixel is found , we subtracted a scaled psf from the surrounding @xmath59 area centered on this pixel .",
    "the ratio of the subtracted flux depends on @xmath62 ; if @xmath62 is greater than @xmath5 , then 0.1% of the flux was subtracted .",
    "if @xmath62 is less than @xmath5 , then 100% of the flux was subtracted .",
    "the subtraction ratio that we use ( 0.1% ) is much smaller than the values that most deconvolution / clean algorithms usually use ( 10% ) .",
    "we found that a subtraction ratio of 10% for our deconvolution process sometimes produces much worse results especially for bright extended sources because our algorithm is less restricted ; 0.1% is the value that has a good balance between performance and quality .",
    "the subtracted flux ( @xmath65 ) was summed and registered to a certain reference object according to the @xmath2 segmentation map .",
    "after the subtraction , the deconvolution process is repeated on the subtracted image , until there was no pixel with @xmath62 higher than @xmath66 .",
    "we note that the concept of the deconvolution here is identical to that of clean in radio imaging . at the end of the deconvolution process , the @xmath65 for each object is the flux measurement of that object , and the final subtracted image is the residual map .",
    "the latter allows us to check the quality of the deconvolution , and it is also used for estimating accurate photometric errors .",
    "the flux error of each object was calcualted based on the fluctuation of the local area around that object in the residual map .",
    "any imperfection of the psf would cause larger fluctuation in the residual map , and that was taken into account by the flux error calculation .",
    "we demonstrate the performance of this method in figure  [ irac - decon ] .",
    "a small region of the tenis @xmath2 image , the simple @xmath28 image , and the residual simple @xmath28 image are shown in the left , middle , and right panels .",
    "the brightness and contrast of the three panels are exactly the same . by comparing the simple @xmath28 image to the tenis @xmath2 image",
    ", one can see that many objects in the most dense area are mixed together in the @xmath28 image while they are still well - separated in the tenis @xmath2 image .",
    "after processing the @xmath28 image using the method described above , the residual image as shown in the right panel of figure  [ irac - decon ] shows that the deconvolution works very well .",
    "sources left in the residual image are objects detected in the irac images but not the tenis @xmath2 image .",
    "an example is the object sitting at the center of the red circle in the right panel of figure  [ irac - decon ] .",
    "this is a bonus of the deconvolution method .",
    "figure  [ irac - comp ] shows a comparison of irac photometry using the abovementioned deconvolution method against that using the sextractor with flux_auto . as can be seen",
    ", the results of two photometric methods agree with each other for bright objects , but the scatter between the two measurements increases for fainter objects .",
    "this is because the flux measurements of faint objects are much more easily affected by neighboring objects , coupled with the fact that fainter objects have higher mean surface number densities .",
    "some bright sources have @xmath67 mag differences between their deconvolution and auto magnitudes . according to the flags provided by sextractor , more than 80% of objects",
    "brighter than 20 mag are seriously blended with their neighbors .",
    "we also confirmed that all the objects having large differences between their deconvolution and auto magnitudes are blended with their neighbors as shown in their flags .",
    "the deconvolution method can deliver more accurate flux estimation for faint sources in the irac images , an important factor in our selection criterion for @xmath0 objects ( see   [ sample ] ) .",
    "a more detailed description of the deconvolution method we used to estimate the irac fluxes is described in hsieh et al .",

    "we combined all the data described in this section and generated a 16-band @xmath2-selected master catalogue containing 114k objects .",

    "our two - color criteria in the @xmath74 m and @xmath75 space , however , greatly minimizes this issue .",
    "the selection criterion are accordingly @xmath81 as shown by the dark gray area in figure  [ cc - diag ] .",
    "the third criterion is closely parallel to the reddening direction of low-@xmath7 galaxies , and therefore greatly reduces the contamination rate from low-@xmath7 galaxies .",
    "although contamination by low-@xmath7 galaxies can be effectly dealt with using the criteria defined in equation  [ criteria1 ] , contamination by galactic cool stars can still be problematic .",
    "we use the ames - dusty dwarf star template @xcite to estimate the distribution of m , l , and t dwarfs in figure  [ cc - diag ] , which is plotted as a light gray area .",
    "the observed m and l dwarfs from irtf library are also shown as dark star signs .",
    "we note that there is an overlapped region between our selection criteria ( dark gray area ) and the dwarf distribution ( light gray area ) .",
    "according to the ames - dusty template , dwarfs in the overlapped region are l dwarfs with effective temperatures between 1700k and 1900k .",
    "therefore , we need to make another criterion to discriminate against very cool dwarf stars .    fortunately , the irac colors of dwarf stars are very different from those of high-@xmath7 galaxies",
    ". therefore we can minimize the contamination issue from galactic cool stars by adding another selection criterion : @xmath82 figure  [ cc - diag - irac ] shows how this additional criterion works .",
    "the solid and dashed lines indicate starburst galaxies at @xmath83 with @xmath84 and @xmath85 , respectively .",
    "the arrow indicates the reddening direction .",
    "the dark gray area shows the selection criteria for high-@xmath7 galaxies while the light gray area shows the region occupied by dwarf stars as computed using the ames - dusty @xcite model . in figure",
    "[ cc - diag - irac ] , high-@xmath7 galaxies and dwarf stars are well separated , demonstrating that irac colors can break the color degeneracy between high-@xmath7 galaxies and dwarf stars in the optical and near - infrared bands .    to improve the quality of the candidate selection , additional criteria are added to eliminate low-@xmath7 galaxies that satisfy the above selection criterion because of photometric errors .",
    "first , all candidates must have more than @xmath86 detection in the wircam @xmath2 band .",
    "second , all candidates must have fluxes lower than @xmath66 in optical bands bluer than @xmath20 .",
    "we also stack all the optical images ( except the @xmath20 and musyc @xmath7 bands as objects at @xmath0 may still be detected in @xmath7 bands ) to generate an ultra - deep optical image . @xcite",
    "have found that some previously published @xmath7-dropout candidates actually have counterparts in ultra - deep stacked optical images , that are just contaminations .",
    "the ultra - deep stacked optical image therfore allows us to check if some contaminations can not be detected in our single optical bands because of insufficient sensitivity .",
    "we generate two different stacked optical images : one is averaged from musyc @xmath87 and gems acs @xmath56 ( 7 filters ) ; the other is averaged from just red filters ( musyc @xmath88 and gems acs @xmath56 ) .",
    "the former provides the deepest stacked optical image while the latter is optimized for detecting faint red objects . at this stage ,",
    "143 objects satisfy all the color criteria .",
    "although the two color - color selection criteria are very robust for picking up @xmath0 objects , contaminations can still be present because of photometric errors and transients .",
    "photometric redshift can help to further reduce these issues .",
    "it utilizes all the data ( 16 bands ) rather than just the 4 filters used in our color - color selections , so it is less affected by photometric errors and transients .",
    "we use the eazy code @xcite to estimate the photometric redshift of our candidates .",
    "we allow a @xmath89 systematic flux error for each band to take into account the systematic errors caused by the fact that for a given object we are not missing the same fraction of light in different passbands that have very different spatial resolutions . to minimize the bias effect of the photometric redshift estimation due to different fitting templates , we use three different templates to run the eazy code , thus obtaining three photometric redshifts for each candidate .",
    "the three templates used are cww+kin , default eazy v1.0 , and pgase .",
    "the cww+kin template is the cww empirical template @xcite with the extension prescribed by @xcite .",
    "the default eazy v1.0 template is generated using the @xcite algorithm with the pgase models and calibrated using semi - analytic models , plus an additional young and dusty template .",
    "the pgase template is from @xcite .",
    "@xcite have found that many irac - selected extremely red objects ( iero ) with very high photometric redshifts are actually galaxies at @xmath90 possessing two different stellar populations .",
    "the eazy code can fit data with multiple stellar populations simultaneously .",
    "for an iero or similar object , using this function helps to break the degeneracy of high and low redshifts in the template fitting .",
    "we use this multiple population fitting function when employing the cww+kin and default eazy v1.0 templates .",
    "the documentation on the pgase template suggests that this template works better in the single population fitting mode , and so we decided not to use the multiple population fitting function with the pgase template .",
    "we compile a new list of candidates according to their photometric redshifts .",
    "we pick up an object with a photometric redshift between 6.0 and 9.0 , and the lower - limit of its photometric redshift at 68% confidence level must be greater than 3.0 . since there are three different photometric redshifts for each object , all three photometric redshifts for a chosen candidate must meet the selection criterion simultaneously .",
    "we then assign the photometric redshift with the smallest best - fitted chi - square as the redshift of each candidate .",
    "applying the photometric redshift criterion left 22 objects in our candidate list .",
    "all the previous selection criteria rely entirely on photometry ( including the photometric redshift estimation ) .",
    "photometric measurements , however , can be easily affected by ccd bleeding , satellite tracks , diffraction spikes of bright stars , etc . , which will also affect the performance of the selection criteria we use . to eliminate these false - detection cases",
    ", we visually check the images of every bands for all the 22 remaining candidates and remove 2 affected objects from the list . in addition , objects detected in @xmath91 , x - ray , and 1.4ghz are also omitted since they are very unlikely to be at high @xmath7 .",
    "there are 3 objects rejected at this stage .",
    "although we use a color selection criterion in the @xmath92 vs. @xmath93 space to discriminate against galactic cool stars , this criterion does not work well for some objects which are very faint in @xmath28 and @xmath72 .",
    "this increases the contamination rate in the candidate selection because the uncertainties in their colors make them spill over into the selection region . to deal with this issue",
    ", we perform the sed fitting for the candidates using the ames - dusty dwarf star template .",
    "we reason that an sed fitting would provide better information about the spectral type of an object as it uses the photometry from all the bands as compared to a pure color selection .",
    "we reject objects if they have similar or even smaller minimum chi squares with the ames - dusty template as compared to those with the galaxy templates .",
    "18 objects are rejected in this way .    in the end",
    ", only one object survives all the criteria imposed .",
    "we name this object tenis - zd1 .",
    "we show its thumbnails in figure  [ thumbnail ] and summarize its photometric results in table  [ fluxes ] .",
    "the listed detection limits for the optical bands are @xmath94 values , and the size of the kron aperture used for tenis - zd1 is @xmath95 ( major and minor axes ) according to the output of sextractor .",
    "the fwhm of tenis - zd1 in @xmath2 provided by a gaussian fitting is @xmath96 , demonstrating that it is an extended object ( and hence not a star ) .",
    "the ultra - deep stacked optical images are also shown in figure  [ opt - comb ] to show that tenis - zd1 is not detected in both ultra - deep optical images . as we mentioned in ",
    "[ deconvolve ] , accurate irac flux measurements are essential for picking up our candidates .",
    "figure  [ thumbnail ] shows that tenis - zd1 has a bright close neighbor with a separation of just @xmath97 .",
    "therefore the irac photometry of tenis - zd1 measured using a typical aperture photometry method would be seriously affected by this bright neighbor . in   [ deconvolve ]",
    "we describe the deconvolution method that we use to derive irac fluxes , and figure  [ 41126-deconv ] shows a comparison between the original irac images around tenis - zd1 , the irac images with tenis - zd1 but without all the @xmath2-band detected neighbors , and the irac residual images .",
    "it demonstrates that tenis - zd1 is well - deconvolved in the irac images and the photometric effect of its bright neighbor is minimized .",
    "the photometric redshift of tenis - zd1 estimated by eazy is @xmath98 , with a reduced @xmath99=1.15 .",
    "the best - fitted templates and the @xmath99 vs. redshift plots are shown in figure  [ sed ] .",
    "we also fit an agn / quasar template @xcite and find a best - fit redshift of @xmath100 .",
    "however , its @xmath99 is 6.50 , which is higher than that of the galaxy fit .",
    "although an agn is not completely ruled out , the fit favors a galaxy .",

    "in this section we discuss the contaminations in our analysis .",
    "@xcite ( ouchi09 , hereafter ) lists all the possible sources of contamination for @xmath7-dropout studies . here",
    "we follow the same items as in ouchi09 to check the contaminations in our study .",
    "\\1 ) spurious sources : one of the selection criterion of our @xmath0 sample is that the objects must have more than @xmath86 detections in @xmath2 , and tenis - zd1 has a @xmath112 detection in @xmath2 .",
    "statistically , an object with a @xmath112 detection is very unlikely a spurious source . as an additional check",
    ", we stack the images taken in 07b and 08b separately and generate two mosaic images for the two different semesters .",
    "we then measure fluxes of objects in each image using the sextractor in the double - image mode , by using the @xmath2-band master image ( 07b+08b ) for the source detection .",
    "the magnitude of tenis - zd1 in 07b is @xmath113 , while that in 08b is @xmath114 .",
    "according to the fluxes of tenis - zd1 in both semesters , it was well - detected in the two epochs .",
    "furthermore , tenis - zd1 has counterparts in @xmath3 and irac images .",
    "all the above evidences suggest that tenis - zd1 is not a spurious source .",
    "\\2 ) transients : we repeat what we did for checking spurious sources . as we mentioned above , the flux of tenis - zd1 in 07b is @xmath113 , and that in 08b is @xmath114 .",
    "the magnitude change between the two epochs is only @xmath115mag , corresponding to a @xmath116 flux variation .",
    "furthermore , tenis - zd1 did not move between the tenis @xmath2-band ( 07b+08b ) , @xmath3-band ( 09b+10b ) and irac images , which shows that tenis - zd1 is not a slow - moving solar system object .",
    "therefore we conclude that tenis - zd1 is not a transient .",
    "\\3 ) low-@xmath7 galaxies : our selection criteria avoid selecting galaxies at @xmath117 .",
    "however , colors of some low-@xmath7 galaxies could also meet the selection criteria due to photometric errors .",
    "we therefore discuss the possibility of that tenis - zd1 is a low-@xmath7 galaxy . the red data point in figure  [ cc - diag ]",
    "shows the position of tenis - zd1 in the @xmath92 vs. @xmath75 diagram .",
    "according to figure  [ cc - diag ] , although tenis - zd1 is right on the boundary of our selection criteria , it is actually a lower - limit of its @xmath75 color since it has no detection in the @xmath20 image .",
    "tenis - zd1 is still far away from the area of low-@xmath7 galaxies even if we take its error bars into account .",
    "furthermore , although there is a local minimum at @xmath90 in the photometric redshift @xmath99 plot of figure  [ sed ] , its @xmath99 value is @xmath118 , which is much larger than that at @xmath119 .",
    "however , the color of a dusty type-2 agn at @xmath120 can be very similar to that of a galaxy at @xmath11 , which makes it another possible source of low-@xmath7 contaminants .",
    "we derived the expected fluxes at 1.4ghz , @xmath91 , and 2 - 8kev for tenis - zd1 by assuming a type-2 agn at @xmath120 ; they are @xmath121ujy ( radio - loud case ) or @xmath122ujy ( radio - quiet case ) , @xmath123 mag ( ab ) , and @xmath124 ergs @xmath125 s@xmath25 for 1.4ghz , @xmath91 , and 2 - 8kev , respectively",
    ". the @xmath94 detection limits for the available data at these wavelengths , however , are 8.5ujy , 21.2 mag ( ab ) , and @xmath126 ergs @xmath125 s@xmath25 for 1.4ghz , @xmath91 , and 2 - 8kev , respectively .",
    "non - detections of tenis - zd1 at these wavelengths therefore can not rule out a dusty radio - quiet type-2 agn with weak x - ray luminosity at @xmath120 .",
    "hence we did a further check by doing an sed fitting within a redshift range between 1.0 and 2.0 for tenis - zd1 using an agn / quasar template from @xcite .",
    "the best - fitted template is the qso2 template . according to the fitting result , the expected @xmath7-band magnitude is @xmath127 mag , which should be a @xmath5 detection in the gems @xmath20 image , but the signal - to - noise ratio of tenis - zd1 in the gems image is less than @xmath94 .",
    "the best - fitted sed also fails to reproduce the steep color slope between @xmath3 band and @xmath71 .",
    "furthermore , figure  13 in @xcite shows that objects at @xmath128 still can match the @xmath0 selection criteria .",
    "the @xmath129 color of tenis - zd1 is @xmath130 , which is outside the color range of any @xmath128 galaxies ( @xmath131 even for extreme cases ) .",
    "it is therefore extremely difficult to explain tenis - zd1 s photometric properties using low-@xmath7 galaxies .",
    "\\4 ) galactic cool stars : although our selection criteria can separate dwarf stars and high-@xmath7 galaxies ( see figure  [ cc - diag - irac ] ) , contaminations from galactic cool stars can still be present because of photometric errors .",
    "the red data point in figure  [ cc - diag - irac ] indicates tenis - zd1 .",
    "according to figure  [ cc - diag - irac ] , the @xmath93 color of tenis - zd1 is too red as compared to that of dwarfs .",
    "moreover , the fwhm of tenis - zd1 in the @xmath2-band image shows it is an extended source .",
    "all these evidences suggest that tenis - zd1 is not a galactic cool star .",
    "the cumulative surface density of our sample is @xmath132 per arcmin@xmath133 to @xmath134 . according to figure  4 in @xcite ( yan11 , hereafter ) , this value matches to that estimated from the lf based on the wfc3 @xmath135-dropout results for @xmath11 galaxies .",
    "yan11 claims that the estimation of the cumulative surface density is applicable over the redshift range of @xmath136 . in other words , it suggests that such an extremely luminous galaxy with @xmath136 can be found in a @xmath137 arcmin@xmath133 survey .",
    "therefore , the discovery of tenis - zd1 is statistically predictable based on previous studies using fainter samples .",
    "eazy code can not provide physical properties ( e.g. , age , stellar mass , etc . ) other than photometric redshifts .",
    "therefore we use the new - hyperz ( rose et al . ) with the galaxev templates @xcite to estimate the physical properties of tenis - zd1 .",
    "we pass the best - fitted @xmath8 derived by eazy to new - hyperz and treat it as a fixed parameter during the template fitting . the extinction model from @xcite",
    "is used . the best - fitted template ( @xmath138 )",
    "shows that tenis - zd1 is a starburst galaxy , with an age of only 45 m years and a stellar mass of @xmath9 m@xmath10 .",
    "the extinction is mild , with an @xmath139 .",
    "the absolute uv magnitude m@xmath140 is -22.35 before the extinction correction .",
    "we then derive the extinction - corrected m@xmath140 , m@xmath141 , using the following formula : @xmath142 @xcite , where @xmath143 = @xmath144 = 9.97 , and @xmath145 .",
    "the correction value is -1.48 mag and hence m@xmath141 is -23.83 .",
    "we then estimate the sfr using the following formula @xcite : @xmath146 for the extinction - corrected case , the estimated sfr is @xmath147 m@xmath10 year@xmath25 , while for the extinction - uncorrected case , the sfr is @xmath148 m@xmath10 year@xmath25 .",
    "we try to estimate the number of galaxies at z@xmath1497 using the semi - analytic simulation result from @xcite , which is based on the millennium simulations .",
    "the result suggests that one galaxy at 7@xmath150z@xmath1508 with a stellar mass greater than @xmath151 m@xmath10 can be detected in the tenis project , which supports the existence of tenis - zd1 .",
    "however , the value of @xmath152 used in the millennium simulations is 0.9 , and the most recent estimate of @xmath152 is @xmath153 derived using the @xmath154 data @xcite , which is almost @xmath155 smaller than that used in the millennium simulations",
    ". structure formation would be faster with a larger @xmath152 as massive objects can form earlier .",
    "it is possible that , with the revised @xmath152 , the number of galaxies similar to tenis - zd1 produced in the millennium simulation might be less than one in our survey volume .",
    "there are several massive galaxies at @xmath156 with irac detections reported in @xcite and @xcite . according to their analyses ,",
    "the stellar masses of these galaxies are about several @xmath151 m@xmath10 and their progenitors can be observed at @xmath157 .",
    "in particular , they point out that the @xmath156 sample strongly indicates that the universe was already forming galaxies as massive as @xmath158 m@xmath10 at @xmath157 and possibly even at @xmath159 , which supports the existence of tenis - zd1 .",
    "although it is challenging to explain how to accumulate so much materials and trigger such violent star formation at @xmath0 with current cosmological models , the observational results of @xmath156 galaxies suggest the existence of tenis - zd1 is reasonable .",
    "therefore bright high-@xmath7 objects like tenis - zd1 can provide an important constraint for developing and modifying models .      based on the value of m@xmath140",
    ", tenis - zd1 is an extremely luminous object at @xmath0 . to date , tenis - zd1 is brighter than all published @xmath0 samples except for the sample provided by @xcite(capak11 , hereafter ) .",
    "hence tenis - zd1 provides a new constraint to the very bright end of the lf at @xmath0 . in order to make an lf plot with tenis - zd1",
    ", we estimate the effective comoving volume for our analyses using a monte - carlo simulation which is modified from ouchi09 .",
    "first of all , we generate a mock catalogue for lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) using the starburst template of the galaxev model @xcite with apparent @xmath2 magnitudes from 22.0 to 27.0 . the surface density vs. apparent magnitude relation of",
    "the mock catalogue follows that of all the objects shown in figure  [ completeness ] , where we have assumed that lbgs have a similar surface density vs. apparent magnitude dependency .",
    "the objects are uniformly distributed in the redshift space , and their ages are randomly distributed from 1 m years to 500 m years .",
    "the extinctions of @xcite with @xmath160 to 2.0 are also applied to simulate bluer and redder lbgs .",
    "@xcite show that roughly only one - third of dropout - selected galaxies at @xmath161 have strong ly@xmath13 lines with rest - frame equivalent widths @xmath162",
    ". the fraction might be even lower at @xmath0 because of the absorption by igm .",
    "we therefore added ly@xmath13 emissions with equivalent widths of 20   for 25% of the objects .",
    "we assume that 50% of the objects have no ly@xmath13 emission . for the remaining 25% of the objects , we added ly@xmath13 emissions with equivalent widths of 1 - 20 .",
    "after taking all of the abovementioned effects into account , we disturb the photometry of the catalogue to match to the real data .",
    "equations  [ criteria1 ] and [ criteria2 ] are applied to the mock catalogue to select candidates .",
    "we computed the redshift distribution @xmath163 as the ratio between the number of candidates and the input objects in a magnitude bin of @xmath164 , and estimated the comoving volume density for a given magnitude bin by using the relation @xmath165 which is similar to equation  2 in ouchi09 , where @xmath166 is the number of candidates in the given magnitude bin , @xmath167 is the completeness correction , @xmath168 is the differential comoving volume for the field size of the ecdfs , and @xmath169 is the only magnitude bin we used since our candidate is in that magnitude bin . in order to convert the unit of @xmath170 @xmath171 to @xmath172 , a factor of 2 needs to be applied to @xmath170 .",
    "we make the lf plot , including the data from several previous studies , as shown in figure  [ lf ] .",
    "the lfs provided by ouchi09 and yan11 fitted including luminous samples are also plotted .",
    "the error of our data point is calculated based on a simple poissonian uncertainty for an event rate of 1 , which is @xmath173 . on the other hand , the 90% baysian confidence level for such an event rate",
    "@xcite would be 0.08 - 3.93 . in either case ,",
    "our result is consistent with both ouchi09 and yan11 .",
    "several papers claim that the lf at @xmath11 decreases from @xmath156 at the bright end ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while yan11 shows no / very mild evolution .",
    "these studies are done using samples with @xmath174 while our sample would provide a better constraint at the very bright - end ( @xmath175 ) .",
    "however , our sample is not sufficient to distinguish between the two cases since our result is consistent with both ouchi09 and yan11 within the uncertainties .",
    "on the other hand , capak11 shows a @xmath11 lf with a very high bright end , according to a sample even brighter than ours .",
    "we note that we use very restricted criteria to select our candidate .",
    "while these criteria would eliminate contaminations as much as possible , some objects at @xmath0 could also be rejected at the same time . from this point of view",
    ", the constraint that our sample provides for the lf is a lower limit , and thus we can not completely rule out the lf from capak11 . furthermore , cosmic variance can be as high as a factor of 10 since the extremely luminous galaxies are strongly clustered at @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "it is reasonable that the results based on observations covering less than a few square degrees may show large discrepancies .",
    "the tenis project provides deep @xmath2 and @xmath3 images for the ecdfs .",
    "we use these data with the other deep surveys in optical and infrared to find @xmath0 objects .",
    "new color criteria with irac data for selecting @xmath0 candidates are used because we find that accurate irac photometry provide the key to resolve contamination by low-@xmath7 galaxies and galactic dwarf stars . because the psfs of irac data are much larger than those of the data in the other wavelengths , we introduce a novel deconvolution method to address the confusion in the irac images and provide accurate irac fluxes .",
    "after carefully checking our sample , we found one candidate at @xmath0 , tenis - zd1 .",
    "the weighted @xmath8 of tenis - zd1 is 7.8 , with an estimated stellar mass = @xmath9 m@xmath10 .",
    "the extinction - corrected current sfr of tenis - zd1 is @xmath147 m@xmath10 year@xmath25 , but must have been very much higher in the past .",
    "we summarize the results of our sample below : 1 ) the discovery of tenis - zd1 is predictable in an 1,000 arcmin@xmath133 survey according to the surface density derived from literatures .",
    "2 ) our sample matches to both lfs from ouchi09 and yan11 .",
    "3 ) while the existence of tenis - zd1 is supported by the observations at @xmath156 , it is still hard to explain how such a massive galaxy can form in the early universe based on current cosmological models for structure formation .    in the end",
    ", we would like to emphasize that the tenis project provides the most comprehensive dataset possible to address the problem of finding luminous high-@xmath7 galaxies . compared with fainter high-@xmath7 samples , such high-@xmath7 massive objects like tenis - zd1 provide the greatest leverage in testing galaxy formation / evolution models .",
    "such objects are the best candidates for follow - up spectroscopy with large telescopes ; at the same time , to minimize wastage of observing times on large telescopes , all efforts must first be made to weed out contaminants .",
    "the sizes of the @xmath11 bright samples are very small due to the limited field size of deep near - infrared surveys , and the purity and completeness issues of the dropout technique need to be further investigated . due to the severe contamination issue of the bright end of the @xmath11 lf , all the studies make great efforts on increasing the purity of their samples , however , all these efforts may also harm the completeness of the samples , which makes the bright end of the @xmath11 lf seriously under - estimated .",
    "@xcite point out that the bright end of the lf at @xmath156 based on lae studies is much higher than that based on lbg studies .",
    "capak11 also claims that the bright end of the lf at @xmath11 could be much higher than the results derived using the dropout technique .",
    "the bright samples will increase very soon since there will be more and more large field near - infrared surveys .",
    "however , simply increasing the bright sample size can not solve the bias issue . the best way",
    "is to confirm their redshifts spectroscopically . each spectroscopically confirmed object will set a robust lower - limit for that luminosity bin of the lf .",
    "the james webb space telescope ( jwst ) and 30m - class telescopes ( e.g. , tmt , gmt ) will be certainly capable for these confirmation observations .",
    "but before the era of jwst and 30m - class telescopes comes , the current 10m - class telescopes are still able to perform the observations for objects with @xmath176 as long as strong ly@xmath13 lines exist .",

    "<S> the primary goal of the taiwan ecdfs near - infrared survey ( tenis ) is to find well screened galaxy candidates at @xmath0 ( @xmath1 dropout ) in the extended chandra deep field - south ( ecdfs ) . to this end </S>",
    "<S> , tenis provides relatively deep @xmath2 and @xmath3 data ( @xmath4 abmag , @xmath5 ) for an area of @xmath6 degree . </S>",
    "<S> leveraged with existing data at mid - infrared to optical wavelengths , this allows us to screen for the most luminous high-@xmath7 objects , which are rare and thus require a survey over a large field to be found . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce new color selection criteria to select a @xmath0 sample with minimal contaminations from low-@xmath7 galaxies and galactic cool stars ; to reduce confusion in the relatively low angular resolution irac images , we introduce a novel deconvolution method to measure the irac fluxes of individual sources . illustrating perhaps the effectiveness at which we screen out interlopers , we find only one @xmath0 candidate , tenis - zd1 . </S>",
    "<S> the candidate has a weighted @xmath8 of 7.8 , and its colors and luminosity indicate a young ( 45 m years old ) starburst galaxy with a stellar mass of @xmath9 m@xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the result matches with the observational luminosity function analysis and the semi - analytic simulation result based on the millennium simulations , which may over predict the volume density for high-@xmath7 massive galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of tenis - zd1 , if confirmed spectroscopically to be at @xmath0 , therefore poses a challenge to current theoretical models for how so much mass can accumulate in a galaxy at such a high redshift . </S>"
