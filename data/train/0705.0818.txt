    "the mechanism that leads to high - temperature superconductivity in the cuprates remains an open question despite intense study for the past two decades .",
    "although the field has been challenged by many high - quality data from different types of measurement , there is no uniformly - accepted theoretical picture that can offer a unified and consistent description for these data .",
    "it is often believed that underlying physics can be understood in terms of individual particles interacting through appropriately - chosen interactions . however , even with greatly - simplified hamiltonians , describing collective motion in these strongly - correlated , many - electron systems has had only limited success .",
    "this has led some authors @xcite to conclude that the many - body correlations in cuprates are so strong that dynamics may no longer be described meaningfully in terms of electrons and must be described instead in terms of new effective building blocks that fractionalize spin and charge .",
    "simplicity is a kind of beauty in physics .",
    "even if one could solve the problem with the help of large - scale numerical calculations , such a practice may not be interesting because physics can be completely buried in the numerous configurations used in the calculation .",
    "on the other hand , alternative approaches to many - body problems have been proposed .",
    "one is the method of fermion dynamical symmetries @xcite .",
    "this approach is based on the fact that collective motions in strongly correlated many - body systems are often governed by only a few collective degrees of freedom , and a quantum system exhibiting dynamical symmetries usually contains two or more competing collective modes .",
    "once these degrees of freedom are identified and properly incorporated into a model , the problem may be considerably simplified and , most importantly , the physics in such approaches may become transparent .",
    "this is the philosophy that the su(4 ) model of high - temperature superconductivity @xcite is based on . for cuprate systems we have proposed that the most relevant collective degrees of freedom are @xmath4-wave superconductivity ( sc ) and antiferromagnetism ( af ) , and that coherent pairs ( not individual particles ) , formed from two electrons ( or holes ) centered on adjacent lattice sites , are appropriate dynamical building blocks of the wave function .",
    "the choice of this space , which is small in size but rich in physics , corresponds to a physically - motivated truncation of the huge hilbert space corresponding to the original problem .",
    "it has been found @xcite that these spin - singlet ( @xmath5 ) and the spin - triplet ( @xmath6 ) pair operators , when supplemented with the particle - hole type operators for staggered magnetization ( @xmath7 ) , spin ( @xmath8 ) , and charge , constitute a 16-element operator set that is closed under a u(4 ) @xmath9 u(1 ) @xmath10 su(4 ) algebra if the @xmath4-wave formfactor @xmath11 in @xmath5 and @xmath6 pair operators is replaced by sgn@xmath12 $ ] .",
    "the u(1 ) factor corresponds to a charge density wave that is independent of the su(4 ) subspace because of the direct product .",
    "this implies that in the minimal u(4 ) model charge density waves do not influence the af ",
    "sc competition in lowest order and our discussions have been focused in the su(4 ) subspace with its coherent - state approximation @xcite .",
    "it has been further discovered @xcite that the su(4 ) symmetry is a consequence of non - double - occupancy  the constraint that each lattice site can not have more than one valence electron .",
    "this suggests a fundamental relationship between su(4 ) symmetry and mott - insulator normal states at half - filling for cuprate superconductors .",
    "thus , the su(4 ) model has ingredients of competing af and sc modes , @xmath4-wave @xmath5 and @xmath6 pairs ( entering as  preformed pairs \" that are mixtures of the two kinds of paired states under the su(4 ) constraint @xcite ) in wave functions , and non - double - occupancy imposed by the symmetry @xcite .",
    "all of these appear to be relevant for the physics of cuprate superconductors . for data that do not resolve an explicit @xmath2 dependence",
    ", the coherent - state solutions of the su(4 ) model ( with properly adjusted parameters for effective interaction strengths ) can consistently describe sc gaps , pseudogaps ( pg ) , and the corresponding transition temperatures @xmath0 and @xmath3 in cuprates , as demonstrated in ref .",
    ".    however , there are experimental indications for explicit @xmath2-dependence that are observed by experiments such as angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) @xcite . these data probe electrons near the fermi surface having particular @xmath2 directions .",
    "to describe @xmath2-dependence in energy gaps , we must extend our original su(4 ) model by displaying explicit @xmath2-dependence in the gap equations and their corresponding solutions .",

    "sections iii and iv are respectively devoted to presentation of the new @xmath2-dependent su(4)@xmath1 model and the @xmath2-dependent gap equations obtained using the generalized coherent - state method .",

    "as we have noted , there is experimental evidence for explicit @xmath2-dependence of certain observables in the cuprates .",
    "although interpretation of some of the results remains somewhat controversial , their momentum - dependent nature is clear .",
    "one example is the observation of fermi arcs in angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) data @xcite : arpes measurements suggest that the fermi surface is gapped out arcwise in the pseudogap region below @xmath3 , indicating clear anisotropy of the pg in the @xmath2-space .    in order to describe momentum dependence of energy gaps",

    "since the wavefunction for momentum @xmath62 differs from that for @xmath25 only by a sign @xcite , and a hole wavefunction is the conjugate of a particle wavefunction , the amplitude of a particle  hole wavefunction with momenta @xmath59 should be very similar to that of a pair and thus proportional to @xmath11 .",

    "the fermi surface is completely destroyed by the opening of the pairing gap except at the nodal point , since the pairing gap has no @xmath98 dependence [ see eq.([solution1 ] ) ] .",

    "the value of @xmath164 at the critical angle @xmath139 is denoted by @xmath165 , where @xmath166 is a monotonically increasing function of doping @xmath83 that becomes equal to unity when @xmath167 . ]        as we have discussed extensively in ref .",
    "@xcite , the antiferromagnetic correlation that plays a key role in understanding underdoped cuprates is completely suppressed at and beyond the critical doping point @xmath168 .",
    "a pure ( @xmath4-wave ) bcs superconducting state occurs at zero temperature in the overdoped portion of the phase diagram .",
    "we now show that a similar situation can also occur in certain @xmath2-windows in the _ underdoped _ regime , in which af correlation is completely suppressed and a pure sc state emerges .",
    "this is another interesting consequence of the su(4)@xmath1 model due to the anisotropic factor @xmath169 .",
    "the critical doping point defined in eq .",
    "( [ xqf ] ) , which is constant in the @xmath2-averaged su(4 ) model @xcite , is now a function of momentum direction @xmath126 because of the anisotropic factor @xmath170 .",
    "consequently , for each given doping @xmath83 there always exists a window in the momentum azimuthal angle , @xmath171 , and centering at the nodal point @xmath172 , within which the af correlation vanishes and only the pairing gap @xmath173 exists .",
    "this follows because inside the window @xmath174 ; therefore , the solution ( [ solution1 ] ) is not permitted but the solution ( [ solution2 ] ) is .",
    "the critical angle @xmath139 is determined by the condition @xmath163 .",
    "figure 6 illustrates the situation .    because @xmath170 , and thus @xmath175 , is a doping - dependent quantity , the above phenomenon depends on doping .",
    "the sequential figures , plotted for four different dopings in fig .",
    "7 , show the behavior of the energy gaps as functions of the momentum direction . whenever @xmath176 @xmath177 , which means that there is no momentum space available to @xmath178 and @xmath179 , and the af correlations and triplet pairing states are completely suppressed .",
    "therefore , for @xmath180 the system can only be in a pure superconducting state at zero temperature . it can be seen that larger doping @xmath83 implies a smaller critical angle @xmath139 , and thus a wider pairing window , and that the width of the pairing window decreases rapidly toward zero as the doping goes to zero .    in the original su(4 ) model , we found that the critical doping point defines a natural boundary ( quantum phase transition ) between underdoped and overdoped regimes that have qualitatively different wavefunctions @xcite .",
    "we termed the underdoped superconducting regime the af+sc phase ( antiferromagnetic superconducting phase ) ; it is characterized by having all gaps nonzero but is dominated by af and sc gaps .",
    "the present extension to the su(4)@xmath1 model reveals the additional feature that in this af+sc phase the gaps are _ highly anisotropic _ in the momentum space , implying the possibility of a pure sc window around the nodal points even in the underdoped regime .",
    "the proposed existence of these pure superconducting windows may have considerable implication for the nature of the fermi surface at low doping , for the nernst effect , and for the relationship of impurities to inhomogeneities in the underdoped region .",
    "these deserve further investigation .",
    "the above analysis has assumed @xmath113 for simplicity , but the basic picture should be valid also in the case with nonzero temperature . the formulation and solution of the gap equations described in this paper",
    "can be extended to finite temperature using the methods described in ref .",
    "while of considerable practical importance , this extension does not involve conceptually new ideas and will be deferred to a later paper .",
    "in this paper , we have extended the su(4 ) model for high-@xmath0 superconductivity to include explicit momentum dependence in observables .",
    "to do so , we have started from a general su(4 ) hamiltonian and introduced a new approximation for the @xmath4-wave formfactor in the pair operators .",
    "this leads to the new su(4)@xmath1 model , which retains explicit @xmath2-dependence while preserving su(4 ) symmetry .",
    "we have solved the gap equations derived from the su(4)@xmath1 coherent states with some plausible approximations , obtaining analytical solutions for @xmath2-dependent superconducting gaps , pseudogaps , and their transition temperatures @xmath0 and @xmath3 .",
    "the new su(4)@xmath1 model reduces to the original su(4 ) model for observables that are averaged over all possible @xmath2 directions .",
    "therefore we propose that the original su(4 ) model describes the averaged features and thermal properties of cuprates , while the new su(4)@xmath1 model presented in this paper extends this description to detailed anisotropic properties in the @xmath2-space .",
    "the present results have been obtained for zero temperature but the formalism presented here may be extended to finite temperature in a manner similar to that extension of the @xmath2-averaged su(4 ) model .    because of an anisotropic factor @xmath128 in the analytical gap solutions , the cuprate phase structure in the underdoped regime becomes even richer than that for @xmath2-averaged observations .",
    "we have discussed three immediate consequences that emerge in the new su(4)@xmath1 model :    1 .",
    "we have suggested the possibility of two distinct , measurable , pseudogap closure temperatures : the maximum and the averaged . in the coherent - state su(4 ) theory the pseudogap could be interpreted either as arising from competing af and sc degrees of freedom , or alternatively as fluctuations of pairing subject to su(4 ) constraints @xcite .",
    "the proposed @xmath150 and @xmath135 share this same microscopic origin , but differ from each other by a doping - dependent factor .",
    "the temperature @xmath181 represents pg closure temperatures that are averages over @xmath2 , while @xmath135 , which is generally higher than @xmath181 , represents the pseudogap temperature expected if one retains explicit @xmath2-dependence .",
    "experimentally , then , we predict that @xmath150 is the pseudogap temperature that should be measured in experiments that do not resolve @xmath2 explicitly , but ( the generally higher ) @xmath135 is the expected measured pseudogap temperature for experiments like arpes that resolve @xmath2 .",
    "we have provided a theoretical framework to understand arpes fermi - arc data . using two analytical equations ,",
    "we have obtained solution for the @xmath182 dependent fermi - arc lengths in quantitative agreement with existing measurements .",
    "the essence of this result is the appearance of the new factor @xmath164 in the pg closure temperature that has been derived in eq .",
    "( [ tstark ] ) .",
    "we have predicted the existence of doping - dependent windows in the momentum space where antiferromagnetic correlation is completely suppressed in the underdoped regime . without af competition , it is possible for pure superconducting states to emerge in these windows .",
    "thus , we find that pure bcs - type superconducting states can exist , not only in conventional superconductors or in overdoped cuprate high-@xmath0 superconductors ( where such behavior is well established ) , but in localized islands even in underdoped cuprate superconductors .",
    "it is of interest whether this prediction is related to the recent observation of small pockets of well - defined fermi surface in underdoped cuprate superconductors .",
    "some of these predictions ( for example , the two temperature scales for pseudogap behavior ) have the potential to reconcile apparent discrepancies in existing data . all make predictions that can be tested in experiments capable of resolving @xmath2-dependent behavior .",
    "finally , we note that the recent discovery of superconductivity in layered iron - based transition metal oxypnictides @xcite has generated a new wave of research interest . in place of copper and oxygen , the new compounds contain iron and arsenic , and the highest critical temperature for them has already reached 55 kelvin @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated in neutron - scattering experiments @xcite that , like high-@xmath183 copper oxides , superconductivity in these iron - based materials is likely competing strongly with antiferromagnetic degrees of freedom .",
    "it will be of considerable interest to see whether approaches like the one presented in this paper , or other models capable of handling multiple competing degrees of freedom in strongly - correlated systems on an equal footing , can explain these new high temperature superconductors and their relationship to the old ones @xcite .",
    "in particular , we note that what is already known about the new iron - based superconductors suggests that @xmath2-dependent phenomena of the sort described in this paper should also be observable in these new superconductors .",
