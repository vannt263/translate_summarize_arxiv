    "near - earth objects ( neos ) are temporary visitors in the region around the terrestrial planets , and significant work has gone into understanding their dynamical behavior and lifetimes .",
    "gladman et al . ( 2000 ) and others found that neos have short lifetimes , only about 10  myr on average .",
    "gravitational perturbations from planets , collisions with the terrestrial planets , or loss into the sun or ejection out of the solar system limit their average lifetimes . contrasted with the age of the solar system",
    ", the much shorter neo lifetimes suggest that today s neos are simply the current incarnation of a constantly re - filled steady - state population . cratering records ( grieve and shoemaker 1994 ; stffler and ryder 2001 ) find that the impact flux on the terrestrial planets and the moon has been relatively constant on gyr timescales , supporting the idea of a steady - state population .",
    "the problem of how to refill neo space from the seemingly static main asteroid belt was answered with the discovery that asteroids are quite mobile ( bottke et al . 2000 , 2006 ) .",
    "thermal forces work via the yarkovsky - effect to change asteroid s semimajor axes over time ( farinella and vokrouhlick 1999 ; bottke et al .",
    "2000 , 2001 ; see also a review by bottke et al .",
    "this discovery provided the key piece of physics needed to understand how main belt asteroids become neos .",
    "it had been known that some of the more powerful resonances located near , or in , the main asteroid belt could rapidly excite asteroid s eccentricities , sending them onto planet - crossing orbits leading to their delivery to neo orbits .",
    "the yarkovsky effect showed how to efficiently get asteroids into these resonances .",
    "the two most important resonances for this delivery process are readily visible in a plot of the asteroid belt .",
    "first , the 3:1 mean motion resonance ( mmr ) with jupiter is located at heliocentric distance @xmath12.5  au , and is responsible for the large gap in the asteroid distribution at this semi - major axis .",
    "the other is the @xmath4 secular resonance , which occurs when the precession frequency of an asteroid s longitude of perihelion is equal to the mean precession frequency of saturn .",
    "this resonance is inclination dependent , and is very efficient at delivering low - inclination bodies to neo orbits .",
    "it is the effective inner edge of the asteroid belt at @xmath12.15  au , and estimated to deliver @xmath137% of all neos with @xmath5 ( bottke et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the inner main belt ( imb ; @xmath6  au )  bound by these two resonances  is a predominant source of neos .",
    "dynamical models predict that @xmath161% of the @xmath7 neo population comes from there .",
    "the majority of the detected imb asteroids , @xmath1  4/5 those with @xmath8 , are on low - inclination orbits ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "although a compositional gradient is known to exist in the main belt , with low - albedo , primitive asteroids being predominant in the central ( 2.5  au@xmath102.8  au ) and the outer asteroid belt ( @xmath112.8  au ) ( gradie and tedesco 1978 ; moth - diniz et al .",
    "2003 ; masiero et al .",
    "2011 ) , the imb contains numerous primitive asteroids ( campins et al . 2010 ; gayon - markt et al . 2012 ; masiero et al . 2011 ) .",
    "for instance , in a sample of wise - studied asteroids limited to absolute magnitude @xmath12 , about 1/6 of these bodies in the imb with measured albedos and sizes have geometric visible albedos @xmath13@xmath14 , where we use @xmath13@xmath14 as a simple way to separate low - albedo primitive bodies from more processed or igneous bodies typically with higher albedos .",
    "recent studies devoted to finding the origin of the primitive neos 1999 rq@xmath15 , 1999 ju@xmath16 , and 1996 fg@xmath16 ( baseline targets of the sample return space missions , osiris - rex , hayabusa - ii , and marco polo - r ) have found that each of these three bodies are almost certainly ( @xmath1790% ) delivered from the imb following the well - studied dynamical pathway from the main belt to neo - orbits ( campins et al .",

    "the work presented here develops the fundamental hypotheses to be tested by planned asteroid sample return missions .",
    "dynamical evolution studies are critical to obtaining the maximum scientific benefit from these missions .",
    "such studies support primary mission objectives to characterize the geologic and dynamic history of the target asteroids and provide critical context for their returned samples .",
    "in addition , cosmochemical analyses of e.g. , cosmogenic isotope ratios , radionuclide abundances , and nuclear track densities will , in return , provide important constraints on the dynamical evolution of the parent asteroid .",
    "this synergy will result in improved understanding of the dynamical pathways that transform imb objects into neos .",
    "furthermore , the osiris - rex mission specifically will provide the first ground - truth assessment of the yarkovsky effect as it relates to the chemical nature and dynamical state of an individual asteroid .",
    "these studies will provide important input to models of the evolution of asteroid families by yarkovsky drift and delivery to orbital resonances in the imb .",
    "the landscape of the inner main belt is dominated by a handful of asteroid families and a diffuse population of `` background '' objects ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : imbalbedo ] ) . among primitive , low - albedo , bodies",
    "the largest known family is the low - albedo component of the nysa - polana complex , followed by the erigone family and the sulamitis family ( nesvorn 2010 ; gayon - markt et al .",

    "fragments are launched onto orbits that are distinct from , but similar to , the parent body .",

    "kneevi and milani 2003 ) .",
    "smaller fragments are typically launched with higher velocity , creating a size - dependent spread in orbital elements . over time the thermal yarkovsky effect induces a size - dependent drift in semi - major axis , such that smaller bodies drift faster , and thus further , over time than the larger bodies .",
    "therefore families of asteroids are identifiable in two ways : clustering in proper orbital element space , and correlated shapes in size vs. semimajor axis due to size - dependent yarkovsky drift ( see vokrouhlick et al .",

    ", the size , age and location of an asteroid family are important properties .",
    "first , the larger the family , the more potential asteroids that can be delivered .",
    "second , the age of a family determines how far it has spread by the yarkovsky - effect , where older families can spread further .",
    "finally , the location of the family determines how far its fragments must drift via the yarkovsky effect to reach a resonance .",
    "as we find with the nysa - polana complex , a location very near a resonance makes locating the center and determining the age of the family much more difficult .",
    "not all asteroids are associated with a specific asteroid family .",
    "there are a similar amount of `` background '' objects in this region as there are members of an identified family ( gayon - markt et al .",
    "this work will , however , focus on asteroid families for a few reasons .",
    "first , asteroid families imply a physical correlation between fragments .",
    "thus , we may learn more about an interesting asteroid by studying a much larger and brighter parent body or a suite of associated family members .",
    "second , families orbital elements evolve in a relatively simple way - objects drift in semimajor axis at a speed relative to the inverse of their size due to the yarkovsky effect .",
    "this means that a family member that has drifted into a resonance can be followed by equal or smaller - sized members of the same family at the same time - delivery of objects can be correlated temporally .",
    "the specific asteroid family targeted in this work is part of the larger nysa - polana complex ( npc ) - which appears to be two overlapping asteroid families of different asteroid taxonomies .",
    "their overlapping nature has made detailed study difficult , but now the large database of albedos measured by the wise mission has made a study of each of the two componenets of the family possible ( masiero et al .",

    "( 2001 , 2002 ) , and nesvorn ( 2010 ) one component of the nysa - polana complex consists of low - albedo objects belonging to c- or b - type taxonomies ( see also campins et al .",

    "the first target is the low - albedo component of the nysa - polana complex seeking to constrain the center and find the parent of the family , followed by an age estimate .",
    "we have used the calculated albedos from masiero et al .",
    "( 2011 ) to study asteroids observed by the nasa wise mission in the imb with low albedo .",
    "the wise mission measured fluxes in 4 wavelengths 3.4 , 4.6 , 12 and 22 @xmath21 m , and combined with a neatm thermal model calculated visible albedos , ( @xmath13 ) , and diameters ( @xmath22 ) for over 100,000 main belt asteroids .",
    "not all asteroids were observed and not all observed asteroids were detected the same number of times .",
    "therefore errors on albedo and diameter can vary from object to object , and also the sample of objects is not complete at any diameter .",
    "however , this work is not aiming to build a definitive list of family members , rather the aims are to better understand the family structure in the inner main belt .",
    "this database gives accurate measurements for a representative sample of bodies .",

    "is centered around @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "hence out of the entire imb , we take a subset with orbital eccentricities @xmath28 with @xmath29 .",

    "[ fig : vshape ] ]      identification and analysis of the low - albedo families in the inner main asteroid belt pose a few unique problems .",
    "first , half of the typical asteroid family `` v''-shape is visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : vshape ] , which suggests that the parent body is very close to the 3:1 mean motion resonance with jupiter .",
    "so close , in fact , that we can assume that at least half of the family was immediately lost to the powerful resonance shortly after the formation of the family ( though we do search for family members on the other side of the resonance ) .",
    "second , the families are very extended , nearly reaching from the 3:1 to the @xmath33 , suggesting an old age and increasing the possibilities of interlopers and confusion in determining family membership .",
    "lastly , there may be more than one family .",
    "typically , asteroid families are centered on a known parent body as determined by hierarchical cluster method ( hcm ) fitting . with a known center",
    "the next variable to match is the age of the family which is determined by the width of the bounding envelope due to the size - dependent yarkovsky drift of the asteroids .",
    "however , in this case , the shape of the asteroid distribution was not aligned with the previously proposed parent asteroid ( 142 ) polana .",
    "given the uncertainty in both the center and boundaries of the family , we seek to constrain these one at a time .",
    "first , following vokrouhlick et al .",
    "( 2006a ) , the @xmath34 parameter can be used to normalize asteroid distance from a possible family center by their size .",
    "the yarkovsky drift rate is inversely proportional to an asteroid s diameter , so removing this measureable allows a search for clustering of drift distances from possible asteroid family centers .",
    "the @xmath34 parameter is defined @xmath35 where @xmath30 is the absolute magnitude of the asteroid and @xmath36 is the distance an asteroid has drifted from its initial semimajor axis ( @xmath37 ) over a time @xmath38 at a rate @xmath39 .",
    "this formulation of @xmath34 normalizes each asteroid by its size , as the yarkovsky drift rate is inversely proportional to its size @xmath40 such that @xmath41 . for a simplistic asteroid family formation event where all bodies start with the same @xmath37 and similar spin axes",
    ", all family members will have the same @xmath34 , since this value normalizes their drift rate by their size .",
    "this is simplified by ignoring both the spin - axis evolution over time and different @xmath37 for each asteroid due to the dispersion of fragments following the family - forming impact .    however , the @xmath34 parameter can help search for the center of the family .",
    "the distribution of @xmath34 for a given @xmath37 would be flat for a random distribution of asteroids .",
    "if a family is present that had correlated @xmath34 values due to their common semimajor axis drift times , then for an @xmath37 near the center of the family there will be a spike in @xmath34 values .",
    "thus , the @xmath34 distribution can be re - calculated at different @xmath37 , seeking the value that provide the tightest clustering of @xmath34 .",

    "there is only one asteroid with @xmath52  au @xmath53  au with an absolute magnitude less than 12 and only three with @xmath30 less than 13 .",
    "we have also searched known asteroids with proper elements in the same region , finding only a few with measured low albedo from iras or akari ( asteroids 877 and 2159 , tedesco et al .",

    "2011 ) , but both have inclinations around 3.5@xmath19 , outside the boundaries of the estimated family . the only asteroid with suitable inclination , semimajor axis and absolute magnitude is ( 495 )  eulalia , with @xmath54 an albedo @xmath13=0.051 and a diameter @xmath55  km ( masiero et al . 2011 ) .",
    "the synthetic proper orbital elements are @xmath56  au , @xmath57 ( kneevi and milani 2003 ) .",
    "the synthetic proper eccentricity of @xmath58 is well below the npc family average , which is why it was never previously identified as a candidate parent for any of the nysa - polana complex .",
    "however , the orbit of ( 495 ) eulalia is extremely close the the 3:1 mean motion resonance ( mmr ) with jupiter .",
    "the location of this resonance is nominally at @xmath1  2.5  au where a body has an orbital period 1/3 that of jupiter .",
    "the location of the resonance is also a function of the small body s orbital eccentricity , where larger eccentricities expands the location of the resonance in semimajor axis ( see wisdom 1993 , 1995 ) .",
    "the boundary of the resonance itself is not precise , rather the chaoticity of an orbit increases as it approaches the resonance .",

    ", its long - term evolution was modeled .",
    "based on the published uncertainties for its current osculating orbital elements , we integrated 1000 clone particles ( created from the 6d hyper - ellipsoid in the osculating elements space compatible with today s orbit ) .",
    "the clones were integrated using the swift_mvs code , which is part of the swift integration package ( levison and duncan 1994 ) .",
    "all 8 planets were included in the simulation , and each clone was treated as a test particle ( feeling only the gravity of the planets ) .",
    "the simulations spanned 500  myr ( with some tests to 4 gyr ) .",
    "the specific behavior for any single particle at very short timescales ( kyr ) is dominated by the proximity to the 3:1 mean motion resonance ( mmr ) with jupiter via the slow circulation of the principal resonance angle @xmath59 ( where @xmath60 is the orbital frequency of an orbit and @xmath61 is the precession frequency of an orbit ; see fig . [",
    "fig : resangle ] ) .",
    "on longer timescales the interaction with @xmath62 secular resonance results in the corresponding resonance angle @xmath63 librating about @xmath64 with a period of @xmath65  ky ( where @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the proper frequencies associated with the precession of the asteroid , jupiter and saturn respectively ) .",
    "this interaction , together with other secular terms of the asteroid s orbit , is responsible for osculating eccentricity oscillations between 0.060.19 .    to analyze long - term stability and orbital evolution the entire suite of particles",
    "was considered with averaged orbital elements over 10  myr time periods as a proxy for proper elements .",
    "each particle s averaged elements was sampled every 10  myr , creating a distribution mapping the time spent at different orbits - specifically at different eccentricities ( fig .",
    "[ fig : diffuse ] ) .",
    "the semimajor axis of the 1000 clones is quite constant with @xmath69@xmath70  au , while the average eccentricity diffuses between @xmath71=0.110.15 , with most of its time spent at @xmath71=0.12 . from the limited tests run to 4  gyr we find some clones",
    "are lost to the 3:1  mmr ; at 2  gyr only 30% of the clones are lost and at 4  gyr only about 60% of the clones are lost .",
    "so despite being chaotic , the gravitational - only orbit of ( 495 ) eulalia is surprisingly stable for long timescales .",
    "the role of thermal effects on the dynamics of eulalia may be important given the putative old age of the family . at @xmath55",
    "km its maximum drift rate over 1  gyr is around 0.005  au , which is larger than the diffusion found in semimajor axis in the long timescale integrations above .",
    "also , given its precarious location very near the 3:1  mmr , a drift of 0.005  au could change its long - term evolution dramatically , including a slightly different orbit at the time of a possible family - forming impact .",
    "a more realistic estimate of its potential drift rate depends heavily on its obliquity and various thermal properties .",
    "its rotation rate and obliquity have been estimated at 29.2@xmath721.0  hr and @xmath188@xmath19 ( binzel 1987 ) . increasing the accuracy of these measurements and estimating possible yarkovsky drift scenarios , along with the possible role of the yorp effect and secular spin - orbit resonances , is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "the conclusion of this test is that when searching for family membership using an hcm model , the proper eccentricity of ( 495 ) eulalia should be tested at values between @xmath71=0.110.15 , as they are all possible given the asteroid s proximity to the 3:1  mmr .     .",

    "if ( 495 ) eulalia is the parent of a family caused by a collision , the family - forming collision could have happened when the asteroid had any of its allowable orbital eccentricities .",
    "therefore a hierarchical clustering method search for possible family members associated with ( 495 ) eulalia , necessarily needs to be done varying its proper eccentricity .",

    "the yorp effect acts by the asymmetrical reflection and re - emission of thermal radiation to affect the rotation state of an irregularly shaped body .",

    "the largest bodies linked to this association are asteroids ( 142 ) polana and ( 112 ) iphigenia with proper elements @xmath202  au , @xmath203 , @xmath204 and @xmath205  au , @xmath206 , @xmath207 respectively ( iphegenia is linked at @xmath201  180  m / s and polana at @xmath201  190  m / s ) .",
    "the orbital element distribution of the selected asteroids is quite large in eccentricity , spanning @xmath208 , but more tightly clustered in inclination between @xmath209 .",

    "[ fig : lunahcm ] ]    ]      we focus on ( 142 ) polana and ( 112 ) iphigenia due to their size and the suggestions from the @xmath30 vs. @xmath32 plot that they are near the center of the family .",
    "differentiating them is difficult due to these similarities , other than ( 142 ) polana being embedded in a larger and denser grouping in eccentricity .",
    "when these groups are separated and plotted as @xmath30  vs.  @xmath32 it is clear that ( 142 ) polana is associated with the extended family structure ( fig .",
    "[ fig : polseparate ] ) .",
    "meanwhile ( 112 ) iphigenia is associated with objects with larger @xmath30 and larger @xmath32 , that are near the highest - density region of the eulalia family .",
    "it is possible that if the eulalia family was linked with a larger @xmath75 in the hcm routine that many of these objects would be added to the eulalia family .",
    "thus , the extended family here appears to be associated with asteroid ( 142 ) polana , and we use its proper semimajor axis @xmath202  au as the nominal center of the family . using the same fitting routine as before , we then measure a best - fit at @xmath210  au ( fig .",

    "however , uncertainty about yorp reorientation of spin axes adds age uncertainty which becomes increasingly important at increasingly larger asteroid sizes for older families .",

    "[ fig : pol16.9 ] ]      given the low density of asteroids in the wise dataset at low @xmath32 ( @xmath212  au ) and @xmath30 ( @xmath213 ) , it is fair to question if the characteristic shape of the new polana family is not simply a statistical fluke caused by decreasing asteroid density near the @xmath33 secular resonance .",
    "specificially , if the gaping hole in the sample with @xmath214  au and @xmath215 is due simply to statistical flucuation , then the boundary of the new polana yarkovsky `` v - shape '' may simply be an artifact and not the edge of an asteroid family .",
    "a simple test of the significance of this was to take the entire distribution of asteroids in our dataset and randomly re - distribute them while preserving the orbital and size distributions .",
    "more simply , the values of @xmath32 , @xmath71 , @xmath91 and @xmath30 were each separately randomized 1000 times .",
    "a test of number of asteroids with @xmath214  au and @xmath215 was performed for each .",
    "the wise dataset has only 4 asteroids in this region , while the average number found in this region was 15.7 , and the smallest number was 5 for all 1000 iterations ( fig . [",
    "fig : fooled ] ) .",
    "this test did not specifically test if the v - shape was a fluke , but rather whether the stark absence of asteroids at lower @xmath30 was random . finding that it is clearly significant suggests that the density contrast seen is related to actual correlated family and supports the existence of the new polana family .",
    "one alternative explanation for the lack of large low - albedo asteroids inside of @xmath1  2.3  au is simply that this is the innermost edge to c - type asteroids in the asteroid belt .",
    "it is long known that primitive bodies predominate in the outer asteroid belt ( gradie and tedesco 1982 ) , and some recent work has investigated various means to `` implant '' primitive bodies in the asteroid belt from more distant regions of the solar system ( levison et al .",
    "2009 ; walsh et al . 2011 ) .",
    "levison et al . ( 2009 ) focus on capture of d- and p - type asteroids during the solar system instability associated with the late heavy bombardment , and they find a good match to the distribution of these taxonomic classes , with the inner edge of both populations around @xmath1  2.6  au .",
    "walsh et al .",
    "( 2011 ) focused on the origin of the c - class populations that are possibly scattered into the asteroid belt much earlier in solar system history .",

    "the actual data had only 4 objects in this @xmath32 vs. @xmath30 range ( indicated by the vertical line ) and is outside the bounds of the distribution found in the monte carlo test .",
    "[ fig : fooled ] ]      the albedo distribution , sdss colors and visible spectra of objects in the family regions are very similar and not useful to distinguish between families .",
    "therefore any available spectra - especially in the near - infrared - may be able to differentiate family membership .    there is publised near - ir spectra for one asteroid , ( 2446 ) lunacharsky ( de len et al .",
    "2012 ) , that could be a member of the proposed polana family , and it is plotted with ( 142 ) polana , the candidate parent ( fig .",
    "[ fig : specdiversity ] , also see fig . 4 in de len et al .",
    "both objects show similar positive slopes beyond 1.01.2  micron , similar negative slopes in the visible and generally very similar morphologies .",
    "asteroid ( 495 ) eulalia shows no clear feature at 1.0 or 1.2  micron in contrast to ( 142 ) polana .",
    "there is also a clear slope difference between the two family parents beyond 1.0  micron , which has recently been studied as a diagnostic tool by de len et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and ziffer et al . ( 2011 ) to differentiate primitive asteroids with otherwise very similar featureless visible spectra .",
    "the hint of distinction between family parents , including additional candidate family members , is tantalizing for the possibility that near - infrared spectra could distinguish membership between the two families for the numerous smaller bodies that fall within the yarkovsky boundaries of both .",
    "similarly , this is enticing as a possible tool to distinguish a possible origin for primitive neos that have likely originated in this region of the asteroid belt , especially future space - mission targets ( for example , see panel * d * of figure [ fig : specdiversity ] that displays the spectrum for neo 1999 rq@xmath15 , the baseline target for nasa s osiris - rex sample return mission ) .",
    "the structure and past evolution of the families in the inner main belt are critically important in order to understand the history and evolution of the asteroid belt as well as the delivery of asteroids to neo orbits .",
    "we have found that the primitive population in the inner main belt is dominated by a few very old and large families .",
    "the low - albedo component of the nysa - polana complex is an asteroid family parented by asteroid ( 495 ) eulalia .",
    "the family s age is between 9001500  myr , and the parent body had a size between 100165  km .",
    "we have also found evidence for the existence of an older and larger family centered on ( 142 ) polana , dubbed here the `` new polana '' family .",
    "this family is parented by ( 142 ) polana and formed more than 2000  myr ago .    in light of this work",
    ", it appears that the major contributors of primtive neos could be the eulalia and new polana family .",
    "our dataset is limited to @xmath217 , and therefore we can not directly observe how the smallest members ( @xmath218 ) of the family are behaving .",
    "we can , however , extrapolate based on the yarkovsky curves , and estimate the @xmath30 value where the yarkovsky curve crosses a major resonance . asteroids with a larger @xmath30",
    "can reach that resonance by simple yarkovsky drift , while those with smaller @xmath30 can not .",
    "this method ignores complications due to yorp cycles , or other effects such as collisions , that may have a different size - dependence than the yarkovsky effect",
    ".    in particular , we are interested in where the curves cross the @xmath33 resonance , as it is efficient at delivering neos . the new polana family , being older , is delivering asteroids up to @xmath219 , while the eulalia family is only now contributing bodies of @xmath220 .",
    "each family has also contributed a large fraction of their total families into the 3:1  mmr .",
    "most of these asteroids would have been directly placed into the resonance immediately following the family formation event , and therefore would have resulted in more of an rapid influx , rather than the slow and measureable contribution via the @xmath33 resonance .",
    "further dynamical models beyond the scope of this work may also help to better discern the flux from each family to neo orbits over time via both the @xmath33 and 3:1  mmr .",
    "one implication of the location of both families near the 3:1  mmr , is that nearly all surviving family members have drifted inward from the family center over time .",
    "this inward drift requires a retrograde spin sense , which is a property that can be determined with lightcurve observations .",
    "it is possible to change the spin sense of an asteroid , by either collisions or yorp reorientation .",
    "both families show an absence of small objects near the center of the family , suggesting that most have continued their inward drift without a substantial number suffering a spin - axis reorientation .",
    "this supports the implication that most members of both families should be retrograde rotators .",
    "each of the three proposed neo space mission targets ( 1999 rq@xmath15 , 1999 ju@xmath20 and 1996 fg@xmath20 ) are almost certainly ( @xmath221% ) delivered from the inner region of the main asteroid belt , following the well - studied dynamical pathway from the main belt to neo - orbits ( bottke et al . 2000,2002 ; campins et al .",
    "2010 ; walsh et al .",
    "more specifically , they appear to have come from the @xmath33 resonance at 2.15  au , which is the dominant supplier of neos ( bottke et al .",
    "2002 ) , and their current low inclination is indicative of similarly low inclination orbits in the main belt . though entire works are dedicated to understanding the origin of these specific objects ,",
    "the two families studied here are likely the dominant sources of primitive neos .",
    "these conclusions have been reached previously in works by campins et al .",
    "( 2010 ) finding the nysa - polana complex as the likely source of 1999 rq@xmath15 ( now probably from the eulalia family ) , or gayon - markt et al .",
    "( 2012 ) finding that the background ( now largely belonging to the new polana family ) is an equal or greater contributor of primitive neos .",
    "a major part of this work was the description of relatively new techniques to detect and analyse very diffuse and old asteroid families . despite significant previous work on these topics ,",
    "the discovery of both families was greatly aided by the use of the wise albedo data , which allowed specific analysis of low - albedo objects . beyond the advantage of focusing on asteroids with similar physical properties",
    ", it also removed the `` noisy '' background of high - albedo asteroids which otherwise would have convoluted the hcm tests ( resulting in the hcm linking the huge chunks of the asteroid belt ) .",
    "thus the slew of new data allows a pre - selected subset of the asteroid belt from which to detect possible family correlations .",
    "the possible pitfalls of these technique are that the portion of the asteroid belt selected could be biased or incomplete .",
    "asteroids not included in the subset of data , those not observed by wise for example , need to be tracked down in further iterations of the work to build a full list of family members .",
    "though this work attempted to search for all possible parent members using numerous databases , ( 495 ) eulalia required special dynamical care to be recognised as the parent , a task not realistic for a larger survey of very old families .    finally , there are potentially vast implications in assigning much of what was considered to the be the background of the asteroid belt to an older family , the new polana family .",
    "while this family was particularly difficult to find , even while scouring a small subset of the entire database of asteroids , it highlights what might still be lurking in the data .",
    "how much of the background is actually part of old and diffuse families ? if we continue with this exercise and continue to discover old and diffuse families will there be any background left , and what does this tell us about the origin of the asteroid belt ? certainly , the answers to these questions are beyond the scope of this project , but hopefully the flood of data from current and future spacecraft ( the esa gaia mission for example ) and larger ground - based surveys might help to answer these .",
