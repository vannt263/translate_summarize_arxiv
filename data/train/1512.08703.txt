    "we divide the energy of a bcs superconductor @xcite into three parts : the ground - state energy @xmath7 , the condensate energy @xmath2 , and the energy of the quasiparticles @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath7 is a constant and represents the total energy of the superconductor at temperature @xmath8 , @xmath4 is the sum of the excitations quasiparticle energies , whereas the condensate energy is the difference @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath2 vanishes at @xmath8 and increases monotonically with @xmath1 , reaching its highest value at the critical temperature @xmath10 , where the superconducting state disappears . effectively , the energy of the system  after removing the constant term @xmath7is @xmath11 . due to the fact that both , @xmath2 and the bcs quasiparticle energies @xmath5 , depend on the populations of the quasiparticle states @xmath12",
    ", @xmath3 represents the energy of a fermi liquid ( fl ) @xcite and @xmath13 .    in the context of fractional exclusion statistics ( fes )",
    "@xcite it has been shown that the quasiparticle energies may be redefined ( see e.g. refs .",
    "there is an infinite range of possibilities in which one can redistribute the energy of the system among the quasiparticle states .",
    "moreover , if the choice is made such that the total ( or the effective ) energy of the system is equal to the sum of the quasiparticle energies , then one obtains a description of the system in terms of an ideal fes gas @xcite .",
    "all the choices of quasiparticle energies must lead to thermodynamically equivalent descriptions , in the sense that the populations of the quasiparticle states and all the macroscopic thermodynamic quantities should not depend on the chosen description @xcite .",
    "we exemplify the procedure by redefining the quasiparticle in such a way that @xmath3 becomes the sum of the new quasiparticle energies @xmath14 .",
    "this relation holds for any quasiparticle levels populations , so the system obtained is an ideal gas . in our example the quasiparticle energies @xmath14 exhibits the same energy gap @xmath6 as the bcs quasiparticles , but the density of states ( dos ) @xmath15 is finite over the whole spectrum ( including at @xmath16 ) .",
    "we also extend the bcs model by including an extra interaction between the electrons as a perturbation to the initial pairing hamiltonian .",
    "this leads to an interaction term between the quasiparticles which modifies the energy gap and the quasiparticle energies .",
    "the gap equation can not be satisfied anymore for @xmath17 at any temperature , so , in the first order of perturbation , the extra interaction does not allow the superconducting phase to be destroyed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next subsection",
    "we introduce the notations and the basic concepts of the bcs theory .",
    "then , in section [ sec_energy ] , we write the effective energy of the system as the energy of a fermi liquid ( fl ) , with the bcs quasiparticle energies equal to the landau s quasiparticle energy of the fl .",
