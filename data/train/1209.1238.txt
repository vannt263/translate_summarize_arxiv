    "the bulk of the stable isotopes heavier than iron observed in our solar system are produced via neutron capture reactions @xcite . in order to reproduce the abundance pattern of the heavy isotopes , two different neutron capture processes have to be assumed : the _ s_-process ( which has a main @xcite and a weak component @xcite ) and the _ r_-process @xcite .    on the proton - rich side of the valley of stability , however , there are 35 nuclei which are separated from the path of the neutron capture processes .",
    "these mostly even - even isotopes between @xmath9se and @xmath10hg are the so - called _ p _ nuclei @xcite .",
    "it is generally accepted that the main stellar mechanism synthesizing the _",
    "the so - called @xmath0 process  involves mainly photodisintegrations , dominantly ( @xmath0,n ) reactions on preexisting , neutron - richer _ s _ and _ r _ seed nuclei . the high energy photons ",
    "necessary for the @xmath0-induced reactions ",
    "are available in explosive nucleosynthetic scenarios like a core - collapse supernova shockwave moving through the ne / o layer of a massive star and reaching temperatures around a few gk .",
    "favorable conditions have recently been found also in type ia supernovae @xcite .",
    "consecutive ( @xmath0,n ) reactions can drive the material towards the proton rich side of the valley of stability . as the neutron separation energy increases along this path , ( @xmath0,p ) and ( @xmath0,@xmath2 ) reactions become stronger and bend the reaction flow towards lighter elements @xcite .",
    "theoretical investigations agree that ( @xmath0,p ) reactions are more important for the lighter _ p _ nuclei while ( @xmath0,@xmath2 ) reactions are mainly important at higher masses ( a @xmath11 100 ) .",
    "however , calculations based solely on the @xmath0 process in massive stars are unable to reproduce the observed abundance pattern of the _ p _ nuclei . to solve this problem , several processes",
    "have been suggested to fill in the missing nuclear abundances , e.g. , the rapid proton capture ( _ rp _ ) process on the surface of accreting neutron stars @xcite and the neutrino - induced",
    "process ( @xmath12 process ) in the deepest layers of a core - collapse supernova ejected in a neutrino - wind @xcite .",
    "considerations regarding isotope ratios in meteoritic material , however , severely constrain their possible contribution @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies of the nuclear uncertainties in the nucleosynthesis of the _ p _ nuclei make use of large reaction networks with mainly theoretical reaction rates ( taken from the hauser - feshbach ( h - f ) model @xcite ) . they have shown that the reaction flow for the production of heavy _",
    "nuclei ( 140 @xmath13 a @xmath13 200 ) is strongly sensitive to the ( @xmath14 ) photodisintegration rates @xcite .",
    "recent experiments , however , indicate that the h - f predictions may overestimate the @xmath2-capture cross sections at low energies by factors @xmath15 .",
    "this would also strongly impact the astrophysical reaction rates .",
    "unfortunately , the available data are scarce , only a handful of reactions have been studied at sufficiently low energies @xcite .",
    "consequently , experimental data is urgently needed to confirm the path of the _ @xmath0 _",
    "process , especially for reactions involving @xmath2 particles .",
    "it has to be understood that straightforward measurements of ( @xmath0,@xmath2 ) reactions on target nuclei in the ground state ( g.s . )",
    "can not provide the required information for astrophysical ( @xmath0,@xmath2 ) reactions in a stellar plasma , involving a large number of reactions on nuclei in thermally excited states . the sensitivity of the photodisintegrations on g.s .",
    "nuclei is very different from the one of stellar rates and measurements , therefore test the prediction of different nuclear properties than actually entering the calculation of the rates @xcite . in a high - temperature stellar plasma ,",
    "as encountered in the @xmath0 process , there is complete detailed balance between forward and reverse rates , therefore ( @xmath14 ) rates can be easily converted to ( @xmath16 ) ones .",
    "this is only possible with _ stellar _ rates , however @xcite . if the g.s .",
    "contribution to the stellar rate @xmath17 is close to unity , i.e. , reactions on the g.s .  of the target nucleus",
    "provide most of the rate , a measurement will be able to directly provide the rate @xcite .",
    "photodisintegrations have several orders of magnitude lower @xmath18 than captures @xcite .",
    "therefore , a measurement of ( @xmath16 ) is required to test the predictions of stellar ( @xmath14 ) rates .",
    "it is essential , however , to measure as close as possible to the astrophysically relevant energies , i.e. , the energies from which the largest contribution to the reaction rate integral are coming @xcite .",
    "because of the strong energy dependence of charged - particle reaction widths , the dependences of the reaction cross sections at astrophysical , subcoulomb energy and those at higher , measured energy can be quite different . for example , all astrophysical @xmath2 captures are determined by the @xmath2 width , whereas well above the coulomb barrier the @xmath0 width is mostly dominating and other particle widths may play a role close to channel openings @xcite . if a measurement is not possible in the @xmath2 dominated energy region , the simultaneous measurement of a reaction channel dominated by the @xmath2 width may prove useful , e.g. , the ( @xmath2,n ) channel .",
    "the problem with this is that the ( @xmath2,n ) reaction on proton - rich target nuclei , interesting for the @xmath0 process , always exhibits a negative @xmath19 value , thus limiting the measurable energy range again to higher energies than astrophysically relevant .",
    "nevertheless , this can be used as an initial test of the predicted @xmath2 width . as further discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : res ] , it remains important to remember that a discrepancy between theory and experiment in @xmath2 capture does not necessarily imply an incorrect prediction of ( @xmath16 ) and ( @xmath0,@xmath2 ) reaction rates in stellar plasmas .",
    "in order to extend the experimental database for the astrophysical @xmath0 process and to test the reliability of h - f statistical model predictions in the a @xmath11 100 mass range , the cross sections of the @xmath3i(@xmath2,n ) and @xmath3i(@xmath2,@xmath0 ) reactions have been measured for the first time , using the activation method .",
    "the @xmath3i(@xmath2,n ) reaction was studied in the range @xmath20 mev .",
    "the radiative @xmath2-capture cross sections were measured at @xmath21 mev .",
    "this is close to the astrophysically relevant energy region ( the gamow window ) , which covers @xmath22 mev at a plasma temperature of @xmath23 gk @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the experimental details are described in sec .",
    "[ sec : exp ] ; the resulting cross sections are presented in sec .  [",
    "sec : res ] , where also a comparison to predictions is shown and the implications for the astrophysical rate are discussed ; sec .",
    "[ sec : sum ] provides the conclusions and a short summary .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the @xmath19 value of the reaction @xmath3i(@xmath2,n)@xmath5cs is @xmath24 mev and therefore the impact of the low - lying excited states is even more pronounced .",
    "table [ tab : excited ] lists the set of discrete excited states in @xmath5cs used in the h - f calculations shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : ag ] and [ fig : an ] .",
    "only five discrete levels , including the g.s . , were included in the non - smoker calculation , as given in @xcite . above the fourth excited state ,",
    "a theoretical nuclear level density @xcite was used .",
    "version 0.8.4s of the smaragd code made use of an updated level scheme from @xcite , also included in the 2010 version of nudat @xcite .",
    "above the last included discrete state , a refitted version of the level density of @xcite is applied and additionally an energy - dependent parity distribution @xcite .",
    "using the full list of 30 levels given up to 4.04 mev , the curve marked `` smaragd(30 exc .",
    "stat . ) '' in figs .",
    "[ fig : ag ] , [ fig : an ] is obtained . since @xmath3i(@xmath2,@xmath0)@xmath4cs is also sensitive to the neutron width ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : agsensi ] ) , it is also affected .",
    "the artificial break at about 11.8 mev originates from the inclusion of transitions calculated with a theoretical nuclear level density above this energy .",
    "it is a clear sign that the number of included discrete levels close to this energy is quite different from the predicted number .",
    "this is due to an incomplete level scheme .",
    "as can be seen in table [ tab : excited ] and in ref .",
    "@xcite , the given states at higher energy are only states with higher spin from four rotational bands , low - spin states are not identified . truncating the list of discrete levels after the fifth one yields the curve labeled `` smaragd(5 exc .",
    "stat . ) '' in figs .",
    "[ fig : ag ] , [ fig : an ] .",
    "it is to be noted that the choice of levels obviously has no impact below the ( @xmath2,n ) threshold and therefore there is also no impact on the astrophysical rate for the ( @xmath2,@xmath0 ) reaction .",
    "the reactions @xmath3i(@xmath2,@xmath0)@xmath4cs and @xmath3i(@xmath2,n)@xmath5cs have been studied using the activation technique combining x- and @xmath0-ray countings . for the first time , measurements have been performed for these reactions close to the astrophysically relevant energy region , at energies @xmath6 mev and @xmath7 mev , respectively .",
    "furthermore , the relative intensity of the 536.1 kev @xmath0 transition was measured precisely , its uncertainty is reduced from 13% to 4% .",
    "the ( @xmath2,n ) data confirm the h - f predictions of the averaged @xmath2 width which is essential to derive the astrophysical @xmath3i(@xmath2,@xmath0 ) and @xmath4cs(@xmath0,@xmath2 ) rates , important in the nucleosynthesis of heavy @xmath1 nuclei in a @xmath0 process .",
    "the ( @xmath2,@xmath0 ) data reveal deficiencies in the prediction of the @xmath0 and/or neutron width within the measured energy range .",
    "this is inconsequential , however , for the stellar ( @xmath2,@xmath0 ) and ( @xmath0,@xmath2 ) rates . despite an unchanged optical @xmath2+nucleus potential , a recalculation of the reaction rates with an improved code yielded increased rates compared to previous calculations at @xmath0 process temperatures .",
    "there is an indication of an onset of change in the energy dependence of the @xmath2 width in the ( @xmath2,n ) data at the two lowest energies",
    ". it would be ironic if there is a reduction of the @xmath2 width at very low @xmath2 energies bringing the new rate down to the previous value .",
    "the current data , however , is not sufficient to arrive at a firm conclusion . more data at lower energies , preferably below the ( @xmath2,n ) threshold , would be required to clarify this issue .",
