    "in the standard hierarchical merger paradigm for galaxy formation and evolution , a natural consequence of the merger of two galaxies containing massive black holes is that the two black holes will sink to the center of the host galaxy by dynamical friction , eventually forming a binary and merging together ( see merritt & milosavljevi 2005 for a review ) . as a result",
    ", there is a general expectation that some merging and post - merger galaxies should have two massive black holes .",
    "however , definitive observational identification of galaxies containing two ( or more ) massive black holes is limited to objects showing evidence for accretion - powered activity from spatially resolved active galactic nuclei ( agns ) @xcite . a galaxy with two widely separated active nuclei is often referred to as a `` dual agn '' to distinguish it from the case of a `` binary agn '' in which the two black holes form a tight , gravitationally bound binary .",
    "several examples of dual agns are now known ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , most of which are found in major mergers of massive galaxies .",
    "it is also expected that minor mergers can trigger episodes of nuclear activity @xcite , and dual agns could also be present in some minor mergers with dwarf secondary galaxies if the secondary galaxies also harbor central black holes .",
    "however , the fraction of dwarf or low - mass galaxies that contain black holes is unknown , and only weakly constrained by agn surveys @xcite and by stellar - dynamical searches for black holes in dwarf galaxies @xcite .    in this _ letter _ , we present the discovery of a triplet of emission - line nuclei ( at several kpc separation ) in ngc 3341 .",
    "this system appears to contain two dwarf galaxies merging with a massive disk galaxy , and one of the offset nuclei has a seyfert 2 spectrum .",
    "ngc 3341 is therefore a rare example of a disk galaxy with an offset agn , and an excellent nearby case study for investigations of agn triggering during a minor merger .",
    "the primary nucleus and the second offset nucleus have optical spectra that indicate possible low - level agn activity as well , making this a candidate dual or even triple agn system .",
    "in the course of searching the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) archives for dwarf galaxies with seyfert - type spectra , we came across the object sdss j104232.05 + 050241.9 .",
    "its sdss spectrum is that of a seyfert 2 nucleus , with strong narrow emission lines superposed on a starlight - dominated continuum .",
    "its @xmath2-band apparent magnitude is 18.30 mag ; at @xmath3 ( or @xmath4 mpc for @xmath5 km s@xmath0  mpc@xmath0 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 ) , this corresponds to only @xmath8 mag . in the online mpa / jhu catalog of agns in sdss data release 4 @xcite ,",
    "it is listed as an agn with a host galaxy stellar mass of @xmath9 @xmath10  and an [ ] @xmath11 luminosity of @xmath12 @xmath13 .",
    "this object initially appeared to be an excellent example of an agn in a dwarf host galaxy , but when we examined the sdss image of the object , we found that it is not an individual dwarf galaxy .",
    "instead , it is an off - nuclear knot within the disk of the larger galaxy ngc 3341 .",
    "the sdss catalog magnitude of @xmath14 mag corresponds only to the brightness of this off - nuclear source , while ngc 3341 overall is a giant disk galaxy with @xmath15 mag ( or @xmath16 mag ) .",
    "figure [ sdssimage ] shows the sdss image of ngc 3341 .",
    "it is a disturbed disk galaxy ( hubble type @xmath17sa - sb , but listed in the ugc catalog as `` peculiar '' ) undergoing a minor merger , with two dwarf companions within ( or projected against ) the galaxy disk .",
    "we label these off - nuclear sources as ngc 3341b and ngc 3341c , with object b corresponding to sdss j104232.05 + 050241.9 .",
    "the sdss only obtained a spectrum of object b , and not of the galaxy s primary nucleus or of object c. the luminosities of the two off - nuclear sources ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 mag for objects b and c ) are too high for these to be super star clusters , but they could be dwarf ellipticals , or the bulges of low - mass spirals whose disks have already been stripped off during the merger .",
    "objects b and c are located at projected separations of 95 and 156 ( 5.1 and 8.4 kpc ) from the primary nucleus , respectively , and the separation between b and c is 119 ( 6.4 kpc ) .",
    "we obtained spectra of all three nuclei at the keck - ii telescope using the esi spectrograph @xcite on the night of 2008 march 2 ut .",
    "observing conditions were relatively poor for mauna kea , with some cirrus overhead and seeing of @xmath20 . despite the poor seeing , a narrow slit of width 075",
    "was used in order to resolve narrow absorption and emission lines in dwarf galaxies .",
    "the spectra cover 380010900   over 10 echelle orders , at a uniform scale of 11.5 km s@xmath0",
    "pixel@xmath0  and instrumental dispersion of @xmath21 km s@xmath0 .",
    "the spectra were obtained with the slit oriented at pa=115 , close to the parallactic angle for the midpoint of the exposure sequence , at airmass 1.21.3 .",
    "exposure times were 900 s each for the primary nucleus and object c , and 1200 s for object b. spectra were extracted using a width of 2  and flux - calibrated using observations of the standard star feige 34 .",
    "the @xmath22 per pixel in the continuum at 6600   is @xmath23 , 15 , and 10 for the nucleus and objects b and c , respectively . to obtain pure emission - line spectra , we performed starlight subtraction using observations of template stars observed with the same esi configuration .",
    "( see barth et al .",
    "2008 for a detailed description of the reduction , calibration , and starlight - subtraction procedures . )",
    "the starlight - subtracted spectra of the three nuclei are shown in figure [ spectra ] . for object c ,",
    "the only detected emission lines are h@xmath24  and [ ] @xmath25 .",
    "the starlight subtraction procedure yields radial velocities of @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 km s@xmath0  for the primary nucleus and objects b and c , respectively .",
    "this confirms the physical association between the three objects and rules out a chance projection of unrelated sources .",
    "emission - line fluxes were measured by direct integration of the starlight - subtracted spectra ; the key diagnostic flux ratios are listed in table [ table1 ] .",
    "figure [ bpt ] displays the emission - line flux ratios of [ ] /h@xmath29  and [ ] /h@xmath24  in a @xcite diagnostic diagram , in comparison with galaxies from the @xcite sample",
    ". the keck spectrum of object b confirms its classification as a seyfert 2 , as it falls within the seyfert branch of the diagnostic diagram .",
    "its [ ] @xmath11 emission line has fwhm = 116 km s@xmath0 , similar to the low [ ] linewidths seen in other seyfert 2 nuclei having low - mass host galaxies @xcite .    in the [ ] /h@xmath29  vs.  [ ] /h@xmath24  diagram",
    ", the primary nucleus falls in the region of liner/ `` composite '' or `` transition '' objects , close to the boundary with nuclei , following the @xcite classification scheme .",
    "however , we note that the [ ] /h@xmath24  and [ ] /h@xmath24  ratios at the nucleus are consistent with classification as an nucleus @xcite .",
    "thus , the classification of the nucleus is somewhat ambiguous .",
    "the narrow - line profiles at the nucleus are double - peaked , with a peak - to - peak velocity separation of 310 km s@xmath0 .",
    "this velocity splitting could arise from either radial motion or rotation ; similar double - peaked profiles due to the rotation of a circumnuclear disk are seen , for example , in the transition - type nucleus of ngc 3245 @xcite .    for the weak emission lines in object c , we find [ ] /h@xmath24@xmath30 , indicated as a shaded band in figure [ bpt ] .",
    "the nearly - equal strengths of [ ] and h@xmath24  are inconsistent with an region origin for the emission lines .",
    "given the non - detection of [ ] @xmath11 emission , the most likely classification for this object is a liner or liner/ composite . the h@xmath24  equivalent width is only @xmath31  .    while the optical data identify object b as an agn with a high degree of confidence , the source of ionizing photons in the nucleus and object c is less certain . in the absence of definitive agn signatures such as broad - line emission ,",
    "very weak liner - type emission lines such as those seen in object c could in principle result from photoionization of diffuse gas by sources unrelated to an agn , such as post - agb stars @xcite or x - ray binaries . indeed , _",
    "chandra_observations have revealed that some nearby `` type 2 '' liners do not have a central agn - like point source at all , but do have x - ray emission dominated by a circumnuclear population of x - ray binaries @xcite . as for the primary nucleus",
    ", the source of ionization in liner/ transition nuclei has been the subject of much debate ( see * ? ? ?",
    "a likely interpretation is that they are composite systems containing both a weak agn and regions ionized by hot stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "shock heating could play some role in the narrow - line region excitation as well ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . summarizing results from x - ray surveys of nearby galaxies",
    ", @xcite concludes that the majority of transition nuclei ( perhaps @xmath32 ) do contain agns .",
    "thus , the optical spectra of the nucleus and object c can be interpreted as possibly containing low - luminosity accretion - powered agns , but the optical data do not provide conclusive evidence for the presence of agns in these objects . a search for x - ray sources in ngc 3341 would potentially provide the best constraints on the agn content in this galaxy .",
    "ngc 3341 is not detected in the _ rosat _  all - sky survey , and no source corresponding to its position",
    "is listed in the _ rosat _  faint source catalog @xcite .",
    "we estimate an upper limit of 0.02 counts s@xmath0  in the _ rosat _  image , corresponding to an upper limit of @xmath44(0.12 kev)@xmath45 ergs s@xmath0  for an unabsorbed source with a photon index of @xmath46 . using typical ratios of x - ray to optical emission - line flux for nearby low - luminosity agns @xcite , the expected luminosity of each of the three nuclei would be at least an order of magnitude below the _ rosat _ upper limit .",
    "thus , much deeper observations would be needed in order to search for x - ray sources in this system .",
    "the primary nucleus is a radio source , detected in the first survey ( becker et al .",
    "1995 ) with a flux density of 4.8 mjy and deconvolved major and minor axis sizes of @xmath47 .",
    "we measured the stellar velocity dispersions of the three nuclei following the direct - fitting methods described by @xcite , by fitting the spectra over the restricted wavelength range 50205500   containing the strong mg@xmath48 and fe5270 features .",
    "we find @xmath49 , @xmath1 , and @xmath50 km s@xmath0  for the nucleus and objects b and c , respectively .",
    "if these objects follow the @xmath51  correlation for quiescent galaxies of @xcite , the expected black hole masses would be @xmath52 , @xmath12 , and @xmath53 @xmath10  in the three nuclei .",
    "@xcite show that a typical [ ] bolometric correction for seyfert galaxies is @xmath54([])@xmath55 ( with a scatter of approximately 0.38 dex ) . with this bolometric correction , object",
    "b would have @xmath56 .    from the 2mass @xcite point source and extended source catalogs , the @xmath57-band magnitudes of the primary galaxy and objects b and c are 10.78 , 14.26 , and 15.07 mag , respectively .",
    "to estimate the stellar mass ratio of the merger , we use @xmath58-band mass - to - light ratios from @xcite , computed using reddening - corrected optical colors from sdss . following the @xcite prescriptions , the primary galaxy and objects b and c each have @xmath59 .",
    "this yields a stellar mass of @xmath60 @xmath10  for the primary galaxy and a stellar mass ratio of 50:2:1 for the merging system ( primary : b : c ) .",
    "we note , however , that this mass ratio does not account for any stellar mass already stripped off of objects b and c during the merger . for a more detailed examination of the structure of the merging system",
    ", higher - resolution imaging would be needed .",
    "_ hubble space telescope _",
    "data could clarify whether the offset nuclei were originally spheroidal or elliptical galaxies , or the bulges or pseudobulges of low - mass disk galaxies .",
    "it is particularly interesting to find nuclear activity in at least one of the secondary nuclei in this system , since the agn fraction in low - mass galaxies is known to be very small overall @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the black hole occupation fraction in dwarf galaxies is expected to be well below unity if the efficiency for black hole seed formation is small in low - mass halos at high redshift @xcite , or if gravity - wave kicks during binary black hole coalescence can efficiently expel black holes from dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "there are examples of agns with host galaxy luminosities similar to objects b and c , such as pox 52 @xcite , but they are predominantly isolated systems not involved in strong interactions .",
    "simulations have shown that minor mergers can drive radial inflows of gas to the center of the primary galaxy , potentially triggering agn accretion episodes @xcite , but there is little if any statistical evidence for enhanced agn activity in the secondary galaxies of minor interaction systems . in a study of close ( separation @xmath61 kpc ) galaxy pairs in sdss , @xcite found that in minor interactions with @xmath62 mag , there was a strong increase in the agn fraction for the primary galaxies ( relative to a matched field galaxy control sample ) but there was no detectable enhancement in the agn fraction of the secondary galaxies in the pairs relative to a matched control sample .",
    "in view of the properties of ngc 3341 , we speculate that any enhancement in the agn fueling rate in the secondary might occur at very small separations ( @xmath63 kpc ) that are difficult to probe in statistical surveys .",
    "this unusual agn host galaxy was discovered because the sdss fortuitously selected object b as the one spectroscopic target in this field .",
    "if the primary nucleus had been targeted instead , the galaxy would have appeared unremarkable , and follow - up observations of objects b and c would have been unlikely .",
    "what are the prospects for detection of offset agns in other nearby galaxies ?",
    "@xcite argued that some of the most extreme ultraluminous x - ray ( ulx ) sources are likely to be the nuclei of captured satellite galaxies undergoing agn accretion episodes , rather than being x - ray binaries with intermediate - mass black holes .",
    "while no ulx sources are currently known to have an origin in captured satellites , the discovery of ngc 3341b in the sdss suggests that optical selection can be at least as efficient as x - ray selection for discovery of off - nuclear , accreting black holes from satellite galaxies in minor mergers .",
    "however , optical selection depends crucially on the ability to identify the nucleus of the secondary galaxy in imaging data .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , there are severe observational biases that make it very difficult to identify satellite galaxies involved in minor interactions ( @xmath64 mag ) at very close separations of @xmath63 kpc from the primary galaxy .",
    "furthermore , at separations of a few kpc , satellite galaxies may be so severely disrupted that they no longer have identifiable nuclei , and offset , low - luminosity agns not embedded in stellar nuclei would likely be inconspicuous in optical surveys . nevertheless , further searches for systems like ngc 3341 containing low - mass companions at small separations could provide new constraints on the demographics of dual agns and the efficiency of agn fueling in minor mergers .",
