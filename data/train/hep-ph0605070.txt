    "in qcd exists an open problem of the description of non - perturbative degrees of freedom . in the most known kind this problem is connected to the problem of quark confinement . in this work",
    "we offer an approximate model of non - perturbative quantization .",
    "we separate su(3 ) degrees of freedom on two parts : the first one are almost classical degrees of freedom ( ordered phase ) , the second one are entirely quantum degrees of freedom ( disordered phase or gauge condensate ) .",
    "the ordered phase is described using classical field equations for a small gauge subgroup .",
    "a gauge condensate is presented by scalar fields with corresponding scalar field equations . in order to obtain the equations describing disordered phase we use several assumptions and simplifications for 2 and 4-points green s functions . roughly speaking we suppose that 2 and 4-points green s functions can be simplified by the following way : @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( @xmath2 are constants ) .    in the modern language",
    "we derive field equations for the dimensions two and four condensates . as a consequence we have the possibility to describe the gauge condensate on the microscopical level as a field distribution . using this idea we can investigate color defects in the gauge condensate . in our investigation",
    "the color defects are some defects which destroy the global spatial homogeneity of the disordered phase .",
    "it can be color flux tubes , color electric dipoles , color magnetic currents and so on .",
    "the dimension two condensate @xmath3 has received a great deal of attention in the last few years , see for example @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the output of these investigations is that a non - vanishing condensate is favored as it lowers the vacuum energy . as a consequence of the existence of a non - vanishing condensate @xmath3 , a dynamical mass parameter for the gluons",
    "can be generated in the gauge fixed lagrangian , see @xcite , @xcite .",
    "an interesting idea is implemented in the so - called `` cut - off '' model @xcite , @xcite in which gluons having momenta smaller than a fixed value @xmath4 are bound inside non - perturbative structures .",
    "this idea is similar to the one we will use in this work : probably these gluons are in disordered phase which we investigate here .    in the other context",
    "the condensate notion arises in the dual superconductor model @xcite where the vacuum of a non  abelian gauge model may be regarded as a medium of condensed abelian monopoles .",
    "the monopole condensate squeezes the chromoelectric flux ( coming from the quarks ) into a flux tube due to the dual meissner effect . in this work",
    "we show that the gauge condensate squeezes the color electric and magnetic fields into defects considered here .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it is shown that it is possible to arrive at an effective dual abelian - higgs model , the dual and relativistic version of ginzburg - landau model for superconductor , from @xmath5 yang - mills theory based on the faddeev - niemi connection decomposition and the order - disorder assumptions for the gauge field .",
    "in this subsection we will apply a version of heisenberg s non - perturbative quantization method @xcite to qcd .",
    "the classical su(3 ) yang - mills equations are @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the field strength ; @xmath8 are the su(3 ) color indices ; @xmath9 is the coupling constant ; @xmath10 are the structure constants for the su(3 ) gauge group . in quantizing the system given in eqs .",
    "( [ sec1 - 10 ] ) - via heisenberg s non - perturbative method one first replaces the classical fields by field operators @xmath11 .",
    "this yields the following differential equations for the operators @xmath12 these nonlinear equations for the field operators of the nonlinear quantum fields can be used to determine expectation values for the field operators @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 is some quantum state .",
    "one can also use these equations to determine the expectation values of operators that are built up from the fundamental operators @xmath13 .",
    "for example , the `` electric '' field operator , @xmath16 giving the expectation @xmath17 .",
    "the simple gauge field expectation values , @xmath18 , are obtained by average eq . over some quantum state @xmath15 @xmath19 one problem in using these equations to obtain expectation values like @xmath20 , is that these equations involve not only powers or derivatives of @xmath20 ( _ i.e. _ terms like @xmath21 or @xmath22 ) but also contain terms like @xmath23 . starting with eq .",
    "one can generate an operator differential equation for the product @xmath24 thus allowing the determination of the green s function @xmath25 @xmath26 however this equation will in turn contain other , higher order green s functions .",
    "repeating these steps leads to an infinite set of equations connecting green s functions of ever increasing order .",
    "this construction , leading to an infinite set of coupled , differential equations , does not have an exact , analytical solution and so must be handled using some approximation .",
    "operators which are involved in equation are only well determined if there is a hilbert space of quantum states .",
    "thus we need to look into the question of the definition of the quantum states @xmath15 in the above construction .",
    "the resolution to this problem is as follows : there is an one - to - one correspondence between a given quantum state @xmath15 and the infinite set of quantum expectation values over any product of field operators , @xmath27  are known then the quantum states , @xmath15 are known , _",
    "i.e. _ the action of @xmath15 on any product of field operators @xmath28 is known .",
    "the green s functions are determined from the above , infinite set of equations ( following heisenberg s idea ) .",
    "another problem associated with products of field operators like @xmath29 which occur in eq .",
    "is that the two operators occur at the same point . for _ non - interacting _",
    "field it is well known that such products have a singularity . in this paper",
    "we are considering _ interacting _ fields so it is not known if a singularity would arise for such products of operators evaluated at the same point .",
    "heisenberg in his investigations of a quantized nonlinear spinor field repeatedly underscored that in a quantum field theory with strong interaction the singularities of propagators can be essentially smoothed out .",
    "physically it is hypothesized that there are situations in interacting field theories where these singularities do not occur ( _ e.g. _ for flux tubes in abelian or non - abelian theory quantities like the `` electric '' field inside the tube , @xmath30 , and energy density @xmath31 are nonsingular ) .",
    "here we take as an assumption that such singularities do not occur .",
    "in this section we will present a cylindrically symmetric color defect in a gauge condensate ",
    "infinite flux tube between dyon and antidyon .",
    "we reiterate that we have not found an exact analytical method for solving the full equations for all the green s functions .",
    "our basic approach in this case is to give some physically reasonable scheme for cutting off the infinite set of equations for the green s functions .",
    "in addition our approximate calculations will involve the decomposition of the initial gauge group into a smaller gauge group : @xmath32 .",
    "physically we will find that this reduction splits the initial degrees of freedom ( the @xmath33 gauge potential components ) into @xmath34 and coset components .",
    "the @xmath34 components will represent the ordered phase while the coset components , which will be represented via an effective scalar field , will represent the disordered phase . after these approximations one can perform analytical calculations which suggest the formation of a color electric flux tube .",
    "this is of interest since an important feature of the confinement phenomenon is the formation of electric flux tubes between the confined quarks .",
    "we suppose that quantum su(3 ) gauge fields in quantum chromodynamics can be decomposed on a gauge condensate ( ordered phase ) and non - perturbative fluctuations ( disordered phase ) .",
    "we suppose as well as that the flux tube is an axially symmetric defect in a gauge condensate .",
    "first we define the reduction of @xmath33 to @xmath34 following the conventions of ref .",
    "starting with the su(3 ) gauge group with generators @xmath35 , we define the @xmath33 gauge fields , @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath34 is a subgroup of @xmath33 and @xmath37 is a coset .",
    "then the gauge field @xmath38 can be decomposed as @xmath39 where the indices @xmath40 belongs to the subgroup su(2 ) and @xmath41 to the coset @xmath42 ; @xmath43 are su(3 ) indices . based on this the field strength can be decomposed as @xmath44 where @xmath45 where @xmath46 are the structure constants of su(2 ) .",
    "the su(3 ) yang - mills field equations can be decomposed as @xmath47 -   \\nonumber \\\\    & &    g f^{mn8 } \\left [      a^n_\\nu h^{\\mu \\nu } - b_\\nu \\left ( f^{n\\mu\\nu } + g^{n\\mu\\nu } \\right )    \\right ] , \\label{2a-130}\\\\      \\partial_\\nu \\left (          h^{\\mu \\nu } + g f^{8mn } a^{m \\mu } a^{n \\nu }      \\right ) & = & -g^{8mn } a^m_\\nu     \\left (    f^{n\\mu\\nu } + g^{n\\mu\\nu }    \\right ) \\label{2a-132}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48^a = \\partial_\\nu [ \\cdots]^a + f^{abc } a^b_\\nu [ \\cdots]^c$ ] is the covariant derivative on the subgroup su(2 ) and @xmath49^m = \\partial_\\nu [ \\cdots]^m + f^{mna } a^n_\\nu [ \\cdots]^a$ ] . the heisenberg non - perturbative quantization procedure gives us @xmath50 -   \\nonumber \\\\    & &    g f^{mn8 } \\left [      \\widehat",

    "our basic aim is to cut off the set of infinite equations using some simplifying assumptions . for this purpose",
    "we will propose simple but physically reasonable anstzen for the 2 and 4-points green s functions ",
    "@xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54  which are involved in averaged su(3 ) lagrangian .",
    "as was mentioned earlier we assume that there are two phases    1 .",
    "the gauge field components @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) belonging to the small subgroup @xmath34 are in an ordered phase .",
    "mathematically this means that @xmath57 the subscript means that this is a classical field .",
    "thus we are treating these components as effectively classical gauge fields in the first approximation .",
    "[ 2 ] the gauge field components @xmath58 ( @xmath59 and @xmath60 ) belonging to the coset @xmath42 are in a disordered phase ( _ i.e. _ they form a gauge condensate ) , but have non - zero energy . in mathematical terms",
    "this means that @xmath61 according to lattice calculations the main contribution at calculations of any quantum quantities in qcd is brought with field configurations having abelian monopoles .",
    "we use this fact to say that the contribution from the @xmath62 component of gauge potential is negligible in comparing with the contribution from the @xmath58 components @xmath63 @xmath64 where @xmath65 are the spatial indices . after this remark",
    "we define an approximate expression for the 2-point green s function as follows @xmath66 here @xmath67 is a real su(2 ) triplet scalar fields .",
    "thus we have replaced the coset gauge fields in 2-points green s function by effective scalar fields , which will be the scalar field in our effective @xmath34-scalar system .",
    "we suppose that the green s functions with odd numbers of @xmath58 are zero @xmath68 4 .",
    "the correlations between the ordered ( classical ) and disordered ( quantum ) phases have the following forms @xmath69 where @xmath70 are constants ; @xmath71 are matrices which will destroy the gauge invariance of a final lagrangian .",
    "the 4-points green s functions can be decomposed by the following way . for @xmath58 gauge potentials",
    "@xmath72   \\label{2b-70}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath73 are constants .      for our quantization procedure we will take the expectation of the lagrangian rather than for the equations of motions .",
    "thus we will obtain an effective lagrangian rather than approximate equations of motion .",
    "the lagrangian we obtain from the original su(3 ) pure gauge theory will turn out to be an effective @xmath34 yang - mills - higgs system .",
    "the averaging su(3 ) lagrangian is @xmath74 where @xmath75 . according to item [ 2 ] of section [ basic_assumptions ] @xmath76 since @xmath77 ( we consider the stationary fields only ) , @xmath78 and correspondingly @xmath79 has terms like @xmath80 but @xmath81  @xmath82 .",
    "it means that the magnetic fields generating by the magnetic monopoles are more important by quantization in comparing with the electric fields .",
    "therefore @xmath83 in eq . @xmath84 and @xmath85 are defined by equations - .",
    "we begin by calculating the first term on the r.h.s . of equation @xmath87",
