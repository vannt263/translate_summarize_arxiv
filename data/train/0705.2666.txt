    "it is well - known that at asymptotically high baryon densities the ground state of massless three - flavor qcd corresponds to the so - called color ",
    "flavor locked ( cfl ) phase @xcite . in this phase quarks of all three flavors as well as three colors undergo pairing near the fermi surface due to the attractive one - gluon exchange potential .",
    "the properties of different collective modes , including nambu  goldstone ( ng ) bosons , of the cfl phase were studied already in the framework of weak - coupling qcd @xcite . at intermediate baryon densities , related to compact star physics ,",
    "weak - coupling expansion of qcd is not applicable , so the description of color superconductivity , including the cfl phase , is more adequate in the framework of effective theories for the low energy qcd region . in particular ,",
    "since massless excitations might play an important role in different transport phenomena , such as cooling processes of neutron stars etc , different chiral type effective theories for the pseudoscalar ng bosons of the cfl phase are usually used ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "another effective theory approach is based on the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) models . since any njl model contains the microscopic quark degrees of freedom , it is especially convenient for the investigation of dynamical processes in dense baryonic matter .",
    "in particular , in the three - flavor njl model the cfl effect was already considered , e.g. , in @xcite , ( see also the review @xcite ) , where some aspects of the phase structure of dense quark matter were discussed , including the influence of the @xmath5-quark bare mass , color- and electric charge neutrality conditions , external magnetic field , etc .",
    "in addition , in @xcite the properties and structure of ng bosons of the cfl phase were considered in the framework of njl models .",
    "one of the most noticeable differences between color superconductivity phenomena with three and two quark species is that the cfl effect is characterized by a hierarchy of energy scales . as it was established in different approaches quoted above , at the lowest scale lie ng bosons , which dominate in all physical processes with energy smaller , than the superconducting gap @xmath6 .",
    "evident contributors at higher energy scales are quark quasiparticles , which in the cfl phase have an energy greater than @xmath6 . however , up to now we know much less about other excitations , whose energy and mass are of the order of @xmath6 in magnitude . among these particles are ordinary scalar and pseudoscalar mesons , massive diquarks etc , i.e. particles which might play an essencial role in dynamical processes of the cfl phase .",
    "in contrast , the properties of mesons and diquarks , surrounded by color superconducting quark matter , were already discussed in the framework of the two - flavor njl model @xcite .    in the present paper we are going to study just this type of excitations of the cfl ground state , i.e. mesons and massive diquarks , in the framework of the massless three - flavor njl model . in our previous paper @xcite",
    "we have , in particular , obtained the equations for both scalar and pseudoscalar diquark masses in the cfl phase of the njl model .",
    "there , our consideration was based on the effective action , which is a generating functional for one - particle irreducible green functions .",
    "now , using the same technique , we perform a numerical investigation of diquark masses , as well as of the masses of scalar and pseudoscalar mesons , vs the chemical potential in the cfl phase .",
    "moreover , the octet and singlet structure is established for massive mesons and diquarks ( both scalar and pseudoscalar ) in the cfl phase .",
    "in addition , the masses of diquarks and mesons in the chirally broken quark matter phase are also investigated .",

    "in addition , it is symmetric under the chiral group su(3)@xmath19su(3)@xmath20 ( chiral transformations act on the flavor indices of quark fields only ) as well as under the baryon - number conservation group u(1)@xmath21 and the axial group u(1)@xmath22 . symmetry @xcite .",

    "let us consider the flavor group su(3)@xmath34=su(3)@xmath35 , which is the diagonal subgroup of the chiral group .",
    "then , all complex scalar diquark fields @xmath36 form an @xmath37 multiplet of the su(3)@xmath38su(3)@xmath34 group , i.e. they are a color and flavor antitriplet . the same is true for complex pseudoscalar diquark fields @xmath39 which are also the components of an @xmath40-multiplet of the su(3)@xmath38su(3)@xmath34 group .",
    "evidently , all diquarks @xmath41 have the same nonzero baryon charge .",
    "all the real @xmath42 and @xmath43 fields are color singlets .",
    "moreover , the set of scalar @xmath44 mesons is decomposed into a direct sum of the singlet and octet representations of the diagonal flavor group su(3)@xmath34 .",
    "the same decomposition into multiplets is true for the set of all pseudoscalar @xmath43 mesons .",
    "clearly , in this case the octet is constructed from three pions ( @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) , four kaons ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) and the eta - meson ( @xmath50 ) , whereas the singlet ( @xmath51 ) corresponds to the @xmath52 meson .",
    "the detailed investigations of the thermodynamic potential , performed in our previous paper @xcite for the above accepted model parameter set , shows that at @xmath88 mev the chirally broken quark matter phase with su(3)@xmath89su(3)@xmath90u(1)@xmath21 symmetric ground state is realized in the model ( in this case @xmath67 and @xmath91 mev , where @xmath92 is the dynamical quark mass ) .",
    "however , at @xmath93 the cfl phase of dense baryonic matter arises . in this phase @xmath94 and @xmath6",
    "varies with @xmath0 ( see fig . 2 in @xcite ) .",
    "below we suppose that the gap @xmath6 is a real nonnegative number .    in the following we will study the spectrum of meson / diquark excitations both in the cfl and",
    "chirally broken phases of the njl model . since particle masses are calculated by the use of corresponding green functions , it is necessary to put a special attention to the effective action @xmath95 ( [ 12 ] ) which is really a generating functional of the one - particle irreducible ( 1pi ) two - point green functions of mesons and diquarks both in the chirally broken and cfl phases , namely @xmath96 where @xmath97 .",
    "( to obtain a green function ( [ 17 ] ) in the chirally broken phase of quark matter ( @xmath2 ) , one should use in the expression for the quark propagator @xmath83 ( see appendix b ) , entering in ( [ 12 ] ) , @xmath91 mev and @xmath67 , whereas in the cfl phase ( @xmath4 ) all green functions ( [ 17 ] ) correspond to @xmath83 with @xmath94 and values @xmath70 presented in fig . 2 of @xcite . ) in the following , we shall say that in the theory there is a _ mixing _ between two different particles with corresponding fields @xmath98 and @xmath99 , if their 1pi green function @xmath100 is not identically equal to zero .",
    "now , after performing in ( [ 12 ] ) the trace operation over the two - dimensional nambu - gorkov space , we obtain @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath84 are the matrix elements of the quark propagator matrix @xmath83 defined in ( [ 9 ] ) ( see also appendix b ) .",
    "( some necessary explanations concerning the trace - operation over coordinate space in the expressions ( [ 8])-([171 ] ) are given in appendix a ( see ( [ b4 ] ) ) ) .",
    "it follows from these formulae that the effective action ( [ 8 ] ) depends on the mesonic fields @xmath103 only , i.e. it is a generating functional of the two - point 1pi green functions of mesons .",
    "furthermore , the effective action ( [ 170 ] ) is composed from diquark fields only , and the mixing between mesons and diquarks might occur because of the effective action ( [ 171 ] ) .",
    "however , as a detailed analysis of the njl model ( [ 1 ] ) with three massless quarks shows , each green function , containing mixing of mesons and diquarks , is proportional to @xmath104 .",
    "thus , both in the chirally broken phase of quark matter , where @xmath67 , and in the cfl one , where @xmath94 , there is no mixing between mesons and diquarks , and so the term ( [ 171 ] ) can safely be ignored in our present consideration .",
    "there arises a mixing between mesons and diquarks in the cfl phase .",
    "this effect is analogous to the mixing between the @xmath105-meson and the scalar diquark in the color superconducting phase of a two - flavor njl model with nonzero masses of @xmath106- and @xmath107-quarks @xcite . ]    finally , note that because of the traces containing an odd number of @xmath108 matrices , there is no mixing between scalar and pseudoscalar particles in the framework of the njl model ( 1 ) , as required by parity conservation.[ii ]",
    "taking into account the remarks from the previous section , we have the following general expressions for the nonzero two - point 1pi green function of mesons which are valid in the chirally broken phase of quark matter as well as in the cfl one ( other two - point mesonic 1pi green functions are zero in the model under consideration ) : @xmath109 where @xmath110 . in momentum space the zeros of the fourier transformations of these functions are connected with meson masses .",
    "in contrast , the two - point green functions for @xmath62 and @xmath134 mesons take another form .",
    "indeed , @xmath135 where @xmath136}{3e_{\\delta}^+e_{\\delta}^-[p_0 ^ 2- ( e_{\\delta}^++e_{\\delta}^-)^2]}+\\frac{4(e_{2\\delta}^++e_{2\\delta}^- ) [ e_{2\\delta}^+e_{2\\delta}^-+e^+e^-]}{3e_{2\\delta}^+e_{2\\delta}^-[p_0 ^2-(e_{2\\delta}^++e_{2\\delta}^-)^2]}\\right\\},\\label{4.7}\\\\ & & { \\cal r}=\\int\\frac{d^3q}{(2\\pi)^3}\\left\\{\\frac{32\\delta^2(e_{\\delta}^++ e_{\\delta}^-)}{3e_{\\delta}^+e_{\\delta}^-[p_0 ^ 2- ( e_{\\delta}^++e_{\\delta}^-)^2]}+\\frac{16\\delta^2(e_{2\\delta}^++ e_{2\\delta}^-)}{3e_{2\\delta}^+e_{2\\delta}^-[p_0 ^ 2- ( e_{2\\delta}^++e_{2\\delta}^-)^2]}\\right\\ } \\label{4.8}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( in ( [ 4.7])-([4.8 ] ) the quantities @xmath137 etc are taken again at @xmath94 ) . evidently , these mesons are singlets with respect to the su(3 ) group , and their masses are presented also in figs 1,2 .",
    "it is clear from these figures that none of the mesons have a zero mass in the cfl phase , i.e. they are not the nambu  goldstone bosons ( ng ) of this phase .",
    "moreover , one can see that in the cfl phase there is a singlet - octet mass splitting of pseudoscalar and scalar mesons , which however vanishes in the @xmath138 limit . indeed ,",
    "if the value @xmath138 is used in ( [ 4.1])-([4.8 ] ) , then the 1pi green functions of the octet and singlet mesons are the same , i.e. the mass splitting is absent .      +        in summary , we have three main conclusions about mesons in the framework of the njl model ( 1 ) with three massless quarks .",
    "firstly , we see that nine pseudoscalar mesons are ng bosons only in the chirally broken phase of quark matter . in the cfl phase",
    "they cease to be ng bosons , since now they acquire finite masses ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . secondly , the cfl breaking of the symmetry generates the octet - singlet mass splitting of mesons .",
    "thirdly , in the cfl phase the mass splitting among scalar and pseudoscalar mesons occurs differently .",
    "indeed , at @xmath4 the mass of the scalar octet mesons is larger than the mass of the scalar singlet meson ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , whereas for pseudoscalar mesons the situation is inverse ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . [ iiib ]",
    "as it follows from the discussion in section [ ii ] , all nonzero two - point 1pi green function of diquarks both in the chirally broken and cfl phases might be determined through the relation @xmath147 where the effective action @xmath148 is given in ( [ 170 ] ) , and @xmath149 or @xmath150 .",
    "the last restriction again means that scalar and pseudoscalar diquarks do not mix in accord with parity conservation .",
    "as shown in our earlier paper @xcite for the case of the two - flavor njl model , any two - point green function of pseudoscalar diquarks differs in the color superconducting phase from a corresponding green function of scalar diquarks by a term which is proportional to @xmath151 , where @xmath129 is the dynamical quark mass in this phase .",
    "the same is true for the cfl phase of the njl model ( 1 ) .",
    "so one can conclude that in the cfl phase of the model ( 1 ) , where @xmath94 , each green function of pseudoscalar diquarks is equal to the corresponding green function of scalar diquarks , e.g. , @xmath152 , etc . hence , to establish the spectrum of the diquark excitations of the cfl phase ,",
    "it is enough to study the set of scalar diquarks ( the mass spectrum of the pseudoscalar diquark excitations will be the same in the cfl phase ) .",
    "let us consider the two - point 1pi green functions of the scalar diquarks .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the effective action ( [ 170 ] ) shows that in the cfl phase , i.e. at @xmath4 , where @xmath94 and @xmath70 , eighteen scalar diquarks ( nine @xmath36 and nine @xmath153 fields ) may be divided into four sectors : @xmath154 , @xmath155 , @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "each of the sectors @xmath158 , where @xmath159 , is composed of @xmath36 , @xmath153 , @xmath160 , and @xmath161 diquark fields , whereas the sector @xmath157 is composed of six fields , @xmath162 , @xmath163 , @xmath164 , @xmath165 , @xmath166 , and @xmath167 .",
    "it turns out that there is a mixing between diquarks entering in the same sector , whereas fields from different sectors are not mixed .",
    "( the analogous situation takes place for the set of pseudoscalar diquarks , which is divided into nonmixing sectors @xmath168 , @xmath169 , @xmath170 and @xmath171 . )        note , the expression @xmath182 which is in the left hand side of the equation ( [ 24 ] ) is a complex - valued function defined on the riemann manifold composed of an infinitely large number of sheets of the variable @xmath130 .",
    "the first ( physical ) sheet is the @xmath130 plane with the cut @xmath183 along the real axis .",
    "( just the integrals ( [ 21])-([23 ] ) supply us with the values of the function @xmath182 on this physical sheet . )",
    "it turns out that apart from the trivial zero , @xmath142 , there are no solutions of the equation ( [ 24 ] ) on this sheet , so there are no stable massive diquark excitations in the @xmath154 sector .",
    "using the procedure of analytical continuation presented in @xcite we could find for each value of the chemical potential @xmath0 a complex point , lying on the second sheet of @xmath130 , where the function @xmath182 turns into zero .",
    "evidently , the real and imaginary parts of this point correspond to the mass and width of a resonance .",
    "hence , as was pointed out above , in the @xmath154 sector there appears a twicely degenerated excitation of the cfl phase , whose mass and width are presented in fig .",
    "3 as functions of @xmath0 .    a similar situation occurs in the other four - component sectors @xmath155 and @xmath156 .",
    "namely , for both sectors the 1pi green function matrix has the form ( [ 19 ] ) .",
    "hence , in each of these sectors there are two ng bosons as well as two resonances with the same mass and width , given in fig .",
    "[ iva1 ]     in the cfl phase.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]      first of all note that there are 36 ( 18 scalar- and 18 pseudoscalar- ) diquark fields ( [ 3 ] ) in our model .",
    "so , there should exist at least 36 elementary diquark excitations both in the chirally broken quark matter phase and in the cfl one .",
    "the masses of 12 ( six of them are ng bosons , the other six are massive resonances ) scalar diquark excitations of the cfl phase were obtained in the previous section .",
    "as it is clear from the discussion made at the beginning of section [ iva ] , the mass spectrum of another 12 particles , which are the cfl ground state excitations in the pseudoscalar diquark sectors @xmath168 , @xmath169 , and @xmath170 , is identical to the mass spectrum of the corresponding scalar diquarks from sectors @xmath158 , where @xmath159 ( see the previous section [ iva1 ] ) .",
    "hence , in addition to the scalar excitations found in the previous section , in the cfl phase there exist six pseudoscalar ng bosons as well as six pseudoscalar resonances , whose mass and width are presented in fig .",
    "3 .    concerning the cfl ground state diquark excitations from the sectors @xmath157 and @xmath171",
    ", we should note that the corresponding 1pi green functions form in the rest frame of the momentum representation a nontrivial 6@xmath1846 matrix @xmath185 , which is the same both for the @xmath157 and @xmath171 diquark sectors , with a rather complicated determinant , @xmath186 ^ 2\\big\\{(2t+r)^2-(2w+p)(2z+q)\\big\\}. \\label{290}\\ ] ] an exact expression for the matrix @xmath185 as well as for the 1pi green functions @xmath187 from ( [ 290 ] ) are presented in our previous paper @xcite , where it was also shown that the equation @xmath188 has a three - fold degenerated solution @xmath142 .",
    "so in the diquark sectors @xmath157 and @xmath171 there are six ( three scalar and three pseudoscalar ) ng excitations , and the initial njl model ( 1 ) as a whole has 18 ng bosons in the mass spectrum of the cfl phase .",
    "a more detailed consideration of the quantities @xmath187 shows that @xmath189 , @xmath190 , and @xmath191 , where @xmath192 are given in ( [ 19 ] ) .",
    "so , the square brackets in ( [ 290 ] ) are no more than @xmath193 presented in ( [ 24 ] ) . as a consequence ,",
    "we see , e.g. , that in the @xmath157 sector of the model there exist two massive resonances with the same mass and width , depicted in fig .",
    "moreover , their mass and width are identical to those for the massive resonances from all scalar diquark sectors @xmath158 .",
    "so , all these scalar diquark resonances form in total an octet with respect to the su(3)@xmath71 group .",
    "a similar situation is valid for the pseudoscalar diquarks , where in the mass spectrum there is an octet of the cfl phase excitations with the same mass and width ( see fig .",
    "3 ) .    unfortunately",
    ", we did not manage to find nontrivial diquark excitations of the cfl phase from the sectors @xmath157 and @xmath171 , corresponding to a zero of the expression @xmath194 that appears in the braces of ( [ 290 ] ) .",
    "( evidently , both excitations are su(3)@xmath71 singlets . )",
    "the matter is that @xmath195 is an analytical function on a rather complicated riemann manifold of the variable @xmath130 . on its first riemann sheet",
    "there is only a trivial zero , @xmath142 ( which corresponds to the ng bosons , as it was discussed above ) . due to a rather complicated structure of the function @xmath195 , we were not able to perform its continuation onto the second riemann sheet and get any information about the mass and width of the remaining su(3)@xmath71 singlet diquark resonances from the sectors @xmath157 and @xmath171 .",
    "note , the functions @xmath218 and @xmath219 are analytical in the whole complex @xmath220-plane , except for the cut @xmath221 along the real axis .",
    "( in general , these functions are defined on complex riemann surfaces which are to be described by several sheets .",
    "the integral representations for @xmath222 , given in ( [ 48])-([49 ] ) , define its values on the first sheet only . to find values of @xmath222 on the rest of the riemann surfaces , a special procedure of analytical continuation is needed ( see , e.g. , in @xcite ) . ) let us denote by @xmath223 and @xmath224 the solutions of the equations ( [ 50 ] ) and ( [ 51 ] ) , respectively .",
    "of course , they depend on the coupling constant @xmath178 of the diquark channel .",
    "obviously , the stable diquark excitation corresponds to the root @xmath223 which lies on the first riemann sheet and obeys the constraint @xmath225 .",

    ", @xmath223 runs onto the second riemann sheet , and unstable scalar diquark modes ( resonances ) appear . unlike this , a sufficiently strong interaction in the diquark channel ( @xmath234 ) pushes @xmath223 towards the negative semi - axis of the first riemann sheet , i.e. in this case @xmath235 , where @xmath236 is the mass of the diquark in the vacuum .",
    "the latter indicates a tachyon singularity in the scalar diquark propagator , evidencing that the su(3)@xmath237su(3)@xmath238u(1)@xmath21 symmetric ground state of the chirally broken phase is not stable ( in this case there arises a deeper ground state , corresponding to another phase of the model , the cfl phase ) .",
    "a similar observation was made in the framework of a two - flavor njl model , where the chirally broken quark matter phase is unstable if there is a sufficiently strong interaction in the diquark channel @xcite .",
    "indeed , at a very large @xmath178 , as it has been shown in @xcite , the color symmetry is spontaneously broken even at a vanishing chemical potential .",
    "let us ignore for a moment the scalar diquark sector and perform a similar analysis , based on the equation ( [ 51 ] ) , for pseudoscalar diquark excitations .",
    "then , pseudoscalar diquarks are stable excitations of the chirally broken phase only , if the constraint @xmath239 is fulfilled , where @xmath228 is given in ( [ 52 ] ) and @xmath240}. \\label{gamma3p}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( in this case the solution @xmath224 of the equation ( [ 51 ] ) lies inside the interval @xmath241 . )",
    "it turns out that at @xmath242 these excitations are unstable , whereas at @xmath243 a tachyonic instability of the chirally broken phase appears .",
    "now , combining together the above separate considerations of the scalar and pseudoscalar diquark excitations , we may conclude that at a rather weak interaction in the diquark channel ( @xmath244 ) both scalar and pseudoscalar diquark excitations of the chirally broken phase are resonances .",
    "if @xmath226 , then , in addition to mesons , the scalar diquarks are stable particles in this phase ( the pseudoscalar diquarks are unstable as before ) .",
    "note that the initial massless njl model ( 1 ) is parametrized by three independent parameters @xmath26 , @xmath141 and @xmath178 .",
    "so , one may expect that estimates @xmath245 and @xmath228 from ( [ 52 ] ) depend on @xmath26 and @xmath141 .",
    "however , as it was pointed out just after ( [ 52 ] ) , the quantity @xmath246 does not depend really on the cutoff parameter @xmath26 .",

    "since there are nine scalar @xmath208 diquarks as well as nine scalar @xmath258 antidiquarks in our model , we relate @xmath259 in ( [ 53 ] ) to the mass of the diquark nonet with the baryon number @xmath260 and @xmath261 to the mass of the antidiquark nonet with @xmath262 .",
    "the difference between diquark and antidiquark masses in ( [ 53 ] ) is explained by the absence of a charge conjugation symmetry in the presence of a chemical potential @xmath0 .    finally , if @xmath234 , then a su(3)@xmath237su(3)@xmath89u(1)@xmath21 symmetric ground state , i.e. the chirally broken phase of quark matter , is not allowed to exist in the model .",
    "the matter is that in this case tachyon singularities of the scalar diquark propagator alone ( at @xmath239 ) , or both of the scalar and pseudoscalar diquark propagators ( at @xmath243 ) appear . as a result , in this case the ground state of the cfl phase is always deeper in comparision with the ground state of the chirally broken phase .",
    "so , only the cfl phase may be realized in the model at sufficiently high values of the coupling constant @xmath178 and arbitrary values of @xmath0 . as a consequence",
    ", one must expect that at @xmath263 the critical value @xmath264 of the chemical potential tends to zero .",
    "the fact that at @xmath256 the diquark mass @xmath236 tends to zero may be considered as a precursor , which appears in the chirally broken phase , of the spontaneous breaking of the su(3)@xmath18 symmetry , taking part at @xmath265 .",
    "in the present paper we have continued the investigation , started in our previous paper @xcite , of the bosonic excitations ( mesons and diquarks ) of the dense quark matter , composed of @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath5 quarks , at zero temperature .",
    "the consideration is performed in the framework of the massless njl model ( 1 ) , omitting the  t hooft six - quark interaction term , for simplicity . in this case , the initial symmetry group of the model , i.e. su(3)@xmath19su(3)@xmath144su(3)@xmath38u(1)@xmath145u(1)@xmath22 does contain the axial u(1)@xmath22 subgroup . as a result , we have shown for the model parameter set accepted in sec .",
    "ii that at sufficiently low values of @xmath0 , @xmath88 mev , the chirally broken quark matter phase with su(3)@xmath237su(3)@xmath238u(1)@xmath21-ground state symmetry is realized and nine massless pseudoscalar mesons ( which are the ng bosons ) , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath52 , appear .",
    "( in massless qcd , where u(1)@xmath22 is broken on the quantum level , or in njl models with  t hooft interaction the @xmath52-meson is not a ng boson . )    at @xmath4 the original symmetry is spontaneously broken down to su(3)@xmath71 , and the cfl phase does occur . in this case ,",
    "in accordance with the goldstone theorem , eighteen ng bosons must appear in the mass spectrum of the model ( 1 ) .",
    "( in contrast , due to the absence of the unphysical u(1)@xmath22 symmetry , only seventeen ng bosons must appear in massless qcd . ) considering 1pi green functions , we have found nine ng bosons in the sector of scalar diquark excitations .",
    "eight of them have to be considered as non - physical , since in real qcd they supply masses to gluons by the anderson ",
    "higgs mechanism .",
    "the remaining scalar ng boson corresponds to a spontaneous breaking of the baryon u(1)@xmath21 symmetry .",
    "the other nine ng bosons are no more pseudoscalar mesons , but now the massless excitations in the pseudoscalar diquark sector of the model .",
    "all that , i.e. the ng boson structure of the model ( 1 ) , is the main result of the paper @xcite which is also confirmed in the present consideration .    besides ng diquarks",
    ", we have proved in @xcite the existence of massive diquark excitations in the cfl phase . however , a detailed numerical analysis of the diquark masses vs chemical potential @xmath0 was not done there . in the present paper",
    "we have argued that all massive diquark excitations of the cfl phase are resonances , since the corresponding singularities of their green functions in momentum space lie on the second energy riemann sheet .",
    "moreover , they form scalar- and pseudoscalar su(3)@xmath71 octets and singlets . the mass and width of scalar- and pseudoscalar diquark resonances from octets vs",
    "@xmath0 have been obtained numerically ( see fig .",
    "they are avaluated around 230 mev and 50 mev , correspondingly , i.e. this quantities are at least five times smaller , than the mass and width of the scalar diquark resonance in the color superconducting quark matter composed of @xmath106 and @xmath107 quarks @xcite .",
    "( due to numerical difficulties , we were not able to evaluate the parameters of the above mentioned massive scalar- and pseudoscalar singlet diquark resonances of the cfl phase , however , we guess that their masses are of the same order in magnitude as the masses of the diquark octets . )    to get a more complete view about the diquark properties in the framework of the njl model ( 1 ) , we have considered their masses in the chirally broken phase of quark matter , too .",
    "it follows from our analysis that i ) at sufficiently strong interaction in the diquark channel , i.e. at @xmath266 , the existence of this phase is prohibited in the framework of the njl model ( 1 ) , ii ) depending on the coupling constant @xmath178 , scalar and pseudoscalar diquarks have different properties in this phase .",
    "indeed , at @xmath244 , where @xmath227 is given in ( [ 52 ] ) , both types of diquarks are resonances . however , at @xmath226 the pseudoscalar diquarks remain to be resonances , whereas scalar diquarks are yet stable particles .",
    "as this takes place , there is a splitting between the scalar diquark and scalar antidiquark masses ( see ( [ 53 ] ) ) , which is explained by the violation of the charge conjugation symmetry in the presence of a chemical potential .",
    "( of course , in the chirally broken phase all observable particles are colorless , so one should expect that colored diquarks are confined within baryons ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "thus , one may look at our investigation of the diquark masses in the chirally broken phase as an indication of the existence of rather strong quark - quark correlations inside baryons , which might help in a better understanding of baryon dynamics . )    finally , we have considered in the model ( 1 ) the masses of mesons which are stable particles in both phases . in the chirally broken phase , i.e. at @xmath2 , all nine pseudoscalar mesons are ng bosons , whereas the nine scalar mesons have equal mass @xmath267 mev ( for the parameter set of the model accepted in sec .",
    "ii ) . in the cfl phase , i.e. at @xmath4 , these nonet representations of mesons , reducible with respect to the su(3)@xmath71 group ,",
    "are decomposed into the octet and singlet representations , each with its own mass .",
    "the reason for this octet - singlet mass splitting of mesons is just the color - flavor locked symmetry breaking taking place at @xmath4 . in the cfl phase",
    "the masses of both types of mesons vary in the interval 300@xmath3900 mev , when @xmath0 varies from 330 mev to 500 mev ( see figs 1,2 ) .",
    "however , the mass splitting among the scalar and pseudoscalar mesons occurs in different ways . indeed , as it is easily seen from fig .",
    "1 , the mass of the scalar octet mesons is larger than the mass of the scalar singlet meson , whereas for pseudoscalar mesons the opposite situation takes place ( see fig .",
    "the authors are grateful to the referee for fruitful remarks concerning the multiplet structure of massive diquarks in the cfl phase .",
    "this work has been supported in part by dfg project 436 rus 113/477 and rfbr grant 05 - 02 - 16699 .",

    "then , @xmath277 it follows from ( [ b4 ] ) that @xmath278 * iv ) fourier transformations : * for arbitrary function @xmath279 it is possible to define the fourier transformation @xmath280 by the relation @xmath281 taking these relations into account , one obtains from ( [ b5 ] ) that @xmath282 where @xmath283 are fourier transformations of the functions @xmath284 and @xmath285 , correspondingly .",
    "in the nambu  gorkov representation the inverse quark propagator matrix @xmath286 is given in ( [ 9 ] ) .",
    "using the techniques , elaborated in @xcite , it is possible to obtain the following expressions for the matrix elements of the quark propagator matrix @xmath287 : @xmath288 where @xmath289 , @xmath290 .",
    "moreover , @xmath291 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 and @xmath292 .",
    "( in these and other similar expressions , @xmath121 is a shorthand notation for @xmath293 , where the limit @xmath294 must be taken at the end of all calculations .",
    "this prescription correctly implements the role of @xmath0 as the chemical potential and preserves the causality of the theory . )",
    "it is clear from ( [ 121])-([124 ] ) that all color- and flavor dependences in the matrix elements @xmath295 and @xmath296 arise only due to the matrix @xmath297 .",
    "it is a @xmath298 matrix in the nine - dimensional space @xmath299 which is the direct production of color and flavor spaces .",
    "note , in the chirally broken quark matter phase , where @xmath138 , @xmath231 , the expressions for the matrix elements ( [ 121])-([124 ] ) have a simpler form .",
    "namely , it is clear that in this phase @xmath300 and @xmath301 i.e. the matrix elements ( [ 1210])-([1240 ] ) are proportional to the unit matrices both in the color and flavor spaces .",
