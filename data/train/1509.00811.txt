    "chloroplasts are the organelles within plant cells which convert sunlight to usable energy via photosynthesis .",

    "@xcite then examined mesophyll cells from a wild type and three chloroplast replication and growth mutants ( termed  arc \" mutants ) of _ arabidopsis thaliana _ and consistent with the observations of ellis and leech , they found an inverse relationship between the mean individual chloroplast area and the total number of chloroplasts ( see figure [ fig : pykeleech92-fig3 ] ) .",
    "for each of the wild - type and the three mutants , the relationship between total chloroplast plan area and cell plan area was linear , no matter the individual size or shape of the chloroplasts .",
    "moreover , the slope of the data plotted in the `` plan area plane '' ( total chloroplast plan area versus cell plan area ) was quantitatively similar for all four data sets .",
    "two of the mutants showed considerably more scatter than the wild type and the other mutant , and the mutant with the most scatter was observed to have irregularly shaped chloroplasts .",
    "and @xmath0 , respectively , in ( a ) and ( b ) ) and _ arc2 _ and _ arc3 _ mutants showing more scatter ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively , in ( c ) and ( d ) ) . ]    @xcite unearthed more evidence of this phenomenon from a collection of _ arabidopsis _ cells of both the wild type and two transgenic types .",

    "@xcite further showed that this regulated chloroplast density persists not only across different cells , but across different species .",
    "he found a linear relationship between total chloroplast area and cell plan area when considering an average data point from each of eight different species and several _ arabidopsis _ mutants .",

    "the second notable feature is that the scatter about the relationship grows somewhat linearly with cell plan area , more like a percentage of the plan area ratio rather than an absolute measure .",
    "this data can be resummarized in the context of the ratio of plan areas , which we ll call @xmath4 , defined as the total chloroplast plan area divided by the cell plan area .",
    "these two observations  the linearity of the relationship and the linearly increasing scatter  can be reduced down to the observation that the range of ratios of plan areas is constant for all cell plan areas .",
    "the third important observation is that irregularly shaped chloroplasts have more scatter , which means that chloroplast geometry matters .",
    "here we propose a mechanism to explain this observed chloroplast growth regulation phenomenon . the ability to sense the collective density of one s",

    "much work has been focused on understanding quorum sensing ; @xcite modelled the biochemical quorum - sensing switch in _",

    ", flipping this switch triggers a shift in gene regulation allowing a sufficiently large population to collectively change behaviour .",
    "these triggered behaviours include producing exopolysaccharide to form a biofilm , secreting toxins and turning on bioluminescence . in chloroplasts , we propose that a similar switch turns off chloroplast growth .",
    "although chloroplasts may have a quorum - sensing biochemical pathway homologous to that of bacteria , we prefer to think of this quorum - sensing model simply as a biochemical system with switch - like behaviour .",
    "this switch - like behaviour is the important feature for our results . even if the chloroplast growth regulation pathway operates differently , any switch - like behaviour involving secretion of the signal ought to behave similarly to what we describe here .",
    "we find that the model , when applied to a system of chloroplasts within a cell , can capture both the linear trend and the linearly growing scatter in the data . in the model ,",
    "chloroplast shape influences the extent of the scatter .",
    "quorum sensing is dependent on the geometry of the system . in a system comprised of chloroplasts within a leaf cell , the biochemical processes of secretion , degradation , and absorption",

    "for example , the _ arc6 _ mutant of _",
    "thaliana _ has highly irregularly shaped chloroplasts in comparison to the wild - type chloroplasts @xcite .",
    "dynamically , chloroplasts can deform in response to being squeezed against neighbouring plastids or vacuoles or the cell wall , which can happen over long time scales as the cell grows , or in shorter time scales as chloroplasts move in response to changes in light @xcite .",

    "the second equation tracks the concentration of a protein ( @xmath21 ) that dimerizes with the autoinducer to form an activator of autoinducer production , thereby generating a positive feedback loop . when the autoinducer reaches a critical level , we assume ( but do not explicitly model ) that a downstream pathway is triggered and chloroplast growth is shut off .",
    "the equations for @xmath20 and @xmath21 are    @xmath22    @xmath23    where @xmath24    here @xmath25 and @xmath26 are degradation rates of the signalling molecule outside and inside the chloroplast , respectively ; @xmath27 is the degradation rate of the protein @xmath21 inside the chloroplast ; @xmath28 , @xmath29 control the maximum rate of michaelis - menten - type production , and @xmath30 , @xmath31 control the shape of the production curve . @xmath32 and @xmath33 are background production rates . the parameter @xmath34 depends on @xmath5 , the relative volume density of chloroplasts ( with maximum 1 ) , and @xmath6 , the effective permeability of the chloroplast membrane .",

    " number combinations . using those data points",
    "we can then draw the plan area plane ( total chloroplast plan area versus cell plan area @xmath7 ) for each case .",
    "finding the bifurcation point requires solving the equation @xmath43 .",

    "the sphere expression , on the other hand , is @xmath86 which is similar in form to the other two but multiplied by @xmath87 .",
    "that factor appears due to the way the @xmath6 and @xmath5 factors simplify .",
    "it translates to a larger range of @xmath55 values for each cell size @xmath7 due to the stronger dependence on @xmath10 , which means that the spherical chloroplasts exhibit considerably more scatter than the cylindrical or disk - shaped chloroplasts .",

    "however , @xmath89 is still independent of @xmath7 at leading order , which agrees with the linear trend of the data .",

    "our model predicts a linear trend with minimal scatter . for spheres ,",
    "we see more scatter .",
    "this is consistent with mutant phenotypes that are characterized by irregular shapes and greater scatter when compared to the more cylindrical wild - type chloroplasts .",

    "the data sets with little scatter  the wild type , with @xmath92 , and the _ arc1 _ mutant with @xmath0  can be explained by chloroplasts that have areas and volume that scale together as they grow , such as the cylinders or disks examined here . the data sets with additional scatter ",
    "the _ arc2 _",
    "mutant , with @xmath1 , and the _ arc3 _ mutant with @xmath2  can be explained by chloroplasts that have areas and volumes that scale disproportionally , such as spheres .",

    "would allow us to predict where those points should fall in the plan area plane based on our model .",
    "a comparison of the residuals for a least squares fit could tell us whether our model accounts better for the scatter in the data than noise would .",
    "the features of the data from @xcite are comparable to those from @xcite , and can be similarly explained by our model if the transgenic types with higher scatter have chloroplast shapes with volume and area that scale disproportionally .",
    "our model proposes that chloroplasts regulate their growth via a geometry - dependent biochemical switch .",
    "this idea came directly out of the bacterial quorum - sensing literature without justification .",
