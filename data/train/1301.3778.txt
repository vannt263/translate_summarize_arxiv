    "circuit quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) systems consist of superconducting artificial atoms coupled to the electromagnetic field in a microwave resonator @xcite .",
    "such systems have been successfully used for implementations of elementary quantum optical hamiltonians @xcite and basic quantum information processing @xcite . the rapid technological development in the field of circuit qed",
    "will soon facilitate experiments with highly coherent multi - atom , multi - resonator circuit qed architectures .",
    "this makes circuit qed a promising platform for observing interesting multi - atom quantum optical effects @xcite and even for simulating genuinely interacting quantum many - body systems from solid state physics @xcite .    in @xcite ,",
    "we have proposed and analyzed a circuit qed design that implements the quantum transverse - field ising chain ( tfic ) coupled to a microwave resonator for readout .",
    "the tfic is an elementary example of an integrable quantum many - body system . despite its simplicity",
    ", it still exhibits interesting features , e.g.a quantum phase transition ( qpt ) , and therefore serves as a model example system in the theory of quantum criticality @xcite and nonequilibrium thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "our circuit qed quantum simulator can be used to study quench dynamics , the propagation of localized excitations , and other nonequilibrium phenomena in the tfic , based on a design that could easily be extended to break the integrability of the system . while in @xcite we have focussed on an idealized implementation of the tfic with perfectly uniform parameters ,",
    "the main purpose of the present article is to investigate the effects of disorder in the system parameters on the dynamical behavior of our quantum simulator .",
    "the study of disorder effects on quantum simulators is relevant for two reasons .",
    "first , on the more practical level , any real experimental system will come with a degree of unwanted disorder ( especially in condensed matter settings ) . in the case of circuit qed systems , inhomogeneities of the system parameters",
    "are caused by fabrication issues as well as by static noise fields ( e.g.  produced by defects ) .",
    "it is important to verify that the basic behavior of a quantum simulator survives the amounts of disorder which are present in realistic systems , or even to estimate the amount of disorder that can be tolerated .",
    "second , on the more fundamental level , simulating quantum many - body systems with built - in ( potentially tunable ) disorder is interesting in its own right .",
    "many physical phenomena , from free propagation of wave packets to quench dynamics to ( quantum ) phase transitions can be affected in significant ways by disorder , and this leads to phenomena such as anderson localization or disorder - induced phases .    to prepare our study , we briefly review the system ( ) , discuss sources of disorder and how disorder scales with the tunable system parameters ( ) , and explain the mathematical approach to and some properties of the quantum ising chain ( ) .",
    "we start our main discussion by considering the time - dependent correlations of the order parameter of the chain , where the finite - size effects and the long - time behaviour will be analyzed in the absence of disorder ( ) .",
    "based on this , we will move on to the spectrum of the resonator coupled to the quantum ising chain in our system , which is closely related to the aforementioned time - dependent correlations . to that end",
    ", we employ a very useful approximation which we have introduced in @xcite and which will presumably become important also for future studies of quantum many - body systems coupled to resonators . in this approximation , the full quantum many - body system is replaced by a bath of harmonic oscillators with identical spectrum .",
    "we show here that this approximation actually works very well under appropriate circumstances ( ) .",
    "we then calculate the spectrum of the resonator coupled to a slightly disordered ising chain and find that the effects of disorder on the spectrum are small ( ) . the ising chain in our circuit - qed quantum simulator can be driven out of equilibrium in several ways .",
    "this allows one to perform various types of nonequilibrium experiments , a particularly appealing application of our setup . in our previous work",
    ", we have suggested to observe the propagation of a localized excitation through the chain or the nonequilibrium dynamics of the system after a quantum quench .",
    "here , we show that the predicted phenomena are insensitive to a small amount of disorder in the system parameters ( and , respectively ) .",
    "moreover , we provide a simple estimate for the amount of disorder that will qualitatively change the wave functions and , thus , strongly affect the dynamics even of small systems ( that is , on the scale of neighbouring artificial atoms ) .",
    "however , as argued above , it would be highly desirable to possess also a quantitative theory of disorder effects .",
    "since the nonequilibrium dynamics of the uniform tfic is determined by the ballistic propagation of quasiparticles ( wave packets ) , we formulate and numerically verify for the weakly disordered case a relation between the mean free path of the latter and the parameters of the system and the disorder potential . by means of this relation we are able to predict the dynamical behavior of our quantum simulator given a certain disorder strength , and to estimate the amount of disorder that a particular experiment can tolerate ( ) .",
    "th ) artificial atom to resonator a ( b ) allows one to use standard circuit qed techniques for initialization and read - out of the first ( @xmath0th ) artificial atom . ]",
    "we consider a circuit qed quantum simulator of the tfic as proposed in @xcite .",
    "it consists of a chain of @xmath0 capacitively coupled charge - based superconducting artificial atoms @xcite , such as transmons or cooper - pair boxes ( the latter have to be biased to their charge degeneracy point @xcite to properly simulate the tfic ) . for a review on superconducting artificial atoms ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the first artificial atom is capacitively coupled to a microwave resonator ( see ) .",
    "this resonator a is required for initialization and readout of the first artificial atom . for certain types of experiments ,",
    "e.g. , for measuring end - to - end correlators , one also needs a second resonator b , coupled to the @xmath0th artificial atom . for details on the implementation and the theoretical description of the system ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the system ( at first , only with resonator a ) can be approximately described by the hamiltonian @xmath1 and @xmath2 is the hamiltonian of the tfic , @xmath3 here , @xmath4 is a pauli matrix .",
    "that is , the artificial atoms are considered as two - level systems ( qubits ) , and their two states are described as spin states .",
    "the operators @xmath5 and @xmath6 generate and annihilate a photon of energy @xmath7 .",
    "the transition frequency @xmath8 of the @xmath9th qubit corresponds to a local magnetic field acting on the @xmath9th spin in the usual interpretation of the tfic . as such",
    ", it would be transverse to the direction of the qubit - qubit coupling @xmath10 .",
    "the latter can be either ferromagnetic ( @xmath11 , as in the geometry of ) or anti - ferromagnetic ( @xmath12 , if the qubits in are rotated by @xmath13 ) . while in our previous work we have focussed on the uniform case @xmath14 and @xmath15 for all @xmath9 , we are here often interested in the case where these system parameters are explicitly nonuniform .",
    "this is because , on the one hand , a slight nonuniformity of the @xmath16 and @xmath17 has to be expected from imperfections of the fabrication process . on the other hand",
    ", one can also intentionally detune one or several qubits ( by threading the squid - like loops of the qubits with different fluxes ) and observe how the system s properties change depending on the detuning .",
    "let us discuss the flux - tunability and the undesired disorder of the system parameters in some more detail .",
    "we will argue that the qubit transition frequencies @xmath16 and the qubit - qubit couplings @xmath17 , when normalized to their respective mean values , may be assumed to be flux - independent",
    ". this will be relevant for our theoretical description of the disorder in the system .    in reality",
    ", it should be possible to engineer the geometry of the qubits essentially uniform .",
    "that is , the areas of the qubits squid loops , their charging energies , and the coupling capacitances between the qubits will only vary weakly in the chain .",
    "however , the ( flux - tunable ) total josephson energies @xmath18 of the artificial atoms should be experimentally harder to control since these depend exponentially on the properties of the josephson junctions . for a flux - tunable ( i.e.  squid - type ) artificial atom with two josephson junctions @xcite",
    ", @xmath19 here , @xmath20 is the josephson coupling energy of one josephson junction , @xmath21 is the superconducting flux quantum , @xmath22 is the tunable external flux threading the squid loop , and @xmath23 . assuming equal qubit geometries , @xmath22 can be chosen identical for all qubits ( e.g.  by using a common flux line ) and only the @xmath20 can give rise to disorder .",
    "even if one allows for @xmath24 , this still means @xmath25 , and one can approximate the total josephson energy of the @xmath9th artificial atom by @xmath26 ( as long as @xmath27 ) .",
    "now , for cooper - pair boxes at the charge degeneracy point @xmath28 , and for transmons @xmath29^{1/2}$ ] @xcite .",
    "thus , under the assumption of identical geometry , both for cooper - pair boxes and transmons the transition frequencies @xmath30 of all qubits @xmath9 scale with a @xmath9-independent function @xmath31 of the ( global ) flux @xmath22 , @xmath32 . here , @xmath33 for cooper - pair boxes and @xmath34^{1/2}$ ] for transmons .",
    "this result implies that the qubit transition frequencies , when normalized to their flux - dependent mean value , do not depend on @xmath22 and , hence , have the same statistical properties for all @xmath22 .",
    "explicitly , the mean value of the @xmath16 is given by @xmath35 .",
    "thus , the mean value of the @xmath16 is flux tunable .",
    "however , the normalized qubit transition frequencies @xmath36 are independent of @xmath22 , which must also be the case , for instance , for their standard deviation .",
    "this will become important for our numerical implementation of disorder in the @xmath16 when we consider changes of the external magnetic flux @xmath22 .",
    "the qubit - qubit couplings @xmath17 can also depend on the @xmath37 and , thus , on the @xmath16 .",
    "this is the case for transmons , where approximately @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "that is , the disorder in the @xmath16 and the @xmath17 will not be independent for transmons .",
    "moreover , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and their mean values @xmath39 and @xmath40 change with the external flux @xmath22 approximately in the same proportion @xmath41^{1/2})$ ] . for cooper - pair boxes , on the other hand , the @xmath17 depend only on charging energies and not on the @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "this means that the @xmath17 are not affected by changes of the external flux .",
    "furthermore , the disorder in the @xmath17 should be less pronounced than and hardly correlated with the disorder in the @xmath16 . concerning the relative strength and the correlation of the disorder in the @xmath17 and the @xmath16 , we remark that also static noise fields can play a role , producing some disorder also in the various charging energies of the system ( in particular for cooper - pair boxes , which have small electrostatic capacitances ) . apart from that , disorder in the @xmath17 will turn out to have a much weaker effect than disorder in the @xmath16 .",
    "these deliberations justify to assume for simplicity that both for cooper - pair boxes and for transmons disorder in the @xmath16 and @xmath17 can be present to a comparable degree , and that disorder in the @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) would be uncorrelated with the disorder possibly present in the @xmath17 ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "we finally remark that many properties of the transverse - field ising chain are determined by the ratio @xmath42 , since this ratio essentially ( in the limit of weak disorder ) determines the eigenstates of the system ( see below ) . for standard transmons ,",
    "the ratio @xmath42 is not straightforwardly flux - tunable .",
    "one of the experiments we suggest to do with our quantum simulator relies on the possibility to change the eigenfunctions of the system [ cf . ] , which can be performed only by changing the ratio @xmath42 .",
    "all other possible experiments discussed in this article can be done in principle with cooper - pair boxes and transmons equally well , irrespective of the @xmath17 being flux - dependent or not @xcite .",
    "therefore , when plotting our results as function of a flux - tunable system parameter , we will assume for definiteness that our circuit qed quantum simulator of the tfic is implemented with cooper - pair boxes , and that the @xmath17 do not change with the external magnetic flux .",
    "the hamiltonian can be exactly diagonalized by means of a jordan - wigner transformation , which was first used in this context in @xcite",
    ". this transformation maps the spin degrees of freedom to fermionic operators @xmath43 via @xmath44 and yields @xmath45 , \\label{eq : cfermions } } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] up to a constant @xmath46 , this hamiltonian is of the form @xmath47 .",
    "\\label{eq : quadratic_hamiltonian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the conditions @xmath48 and @xmath49 require @xmath50 and @xmath51 . by introducing new fermions @xmath52 ,",
    "such hamiltonians can be transformed into the diagonal form @xmath53 @xcite . the components @xmath54 and @xmath55 of the vectors @xmath56 and @xmath57 and the excitation energies @xmath58 of @xmath59 are determined by defining normalized vectors @xmath60 and @xmath61 and by solving the equations @xmath62 in our case , @xmath63 and @xmath64 is obtained by substituting @xmath65 and @xmath66 in @xmath67 . for uniform @xmath16 and @xmath17 , the @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath58 can be analytically calculated from equations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . for nonuniform system parameters , these quantities have to be determined numerically .",
    "in both cases , the hamiltonian @xmath2 of the tfic can be written in the form @xmath70 and knowledge of the @xmath68 and @xmath69 allows one to express spin observables in terms of the @xmath71-fermions , which is the basis of many of our calculations .",
    "for instance , @xmath72 we collect some important facts about the tfic . in the uniform case , @xmath73 here , @xmath74 and @xmath75 is the normalized transverse field .",
    "the possible values of @xmath76 are solutions of @xmath77 . for @xmath78 ,",
    "the uniform tfic undergoes a second order qpt at @xmath79 from a ferromagnetic [ @xmath80 or an anti - ferromagnetic [ @xmath81 ordered phase with doubly degenerate eigenstates ( one @xmath82 ) to a paramagnetic disordered phase with @xmath83 for all @xmath76 .",
    "the qpt is signalled by the disappearance of long - range correlations in @xmath84 .",
    "this qpt will also occur in a nonuniform system ( at some mean transverse field strength @xmath39 ) @xcite",
    ". however , there can be weakly ( dis)ordered griffith - mccoy ` phases ' in the vicinity of the critical point @xcite .",
    "finally , we introduce a convenient notation for nonuniform @xmath16 and @xmath17 . in this case , we will frequently write @xmath85 and @xmath86 , where @xmath87 and @xmath88 usually have mean @xmath89 , or , if @xmath16 and @xmath17 follow probability distributions , expectation value @xmath89",
    ". we will refer to @xmath90 as the ` mean ' qubit transition frequency , even if @xmath91 is the expectation value of a probability distribution and the actual mean value @xmath39 is ( for finite @xmath0 ) in general different from @xmath90 .",
    "we use the same convention for the qubit - qubit coupling @xmath92 .",
    "furthermore , we define the local and the ` mean ' normalized transverse magnetic field , @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "note that in general both @xmath95 and @xmath96 ( but for the probability distributions we will consider , @xmath97 ) .",
    "we usually characterize @xmath2 by the parameters @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 . under the assumptions formulated in , @xmath90 and thus @xmath98 are flux - tunable without changing the @xmath87 in the proposed circuit qed quantum simulator of the tfic .",
    "in order to provide a guideline for the initial experimental characterization of our setup , we have calculated in @xcite the transmission spectrum @xmath100 of the resonator as a function of the probe frequency @xmath101 and the flux - tunable qubit transition frequency @xmath90 [ see below , equation ] . to that end , we have first calculated the spectrum of the bare tfic for coupling to the first qubit via @xmath102 , @xmath103 which is the fourier transform of the qubit autocorrelator @xmath104 .",
    "we have argued that for sufficiently large ( but finite ) @xmath0 , qubit decay processes will render the measured spectrum continuous and akin to the spectrum one would obtain by taking the limit @xmath78 in the calculation of @xmath105 . assuming small coupling @xmath106 of the first qubit and the resonator , we have then considered the tfic as a linear bath for the resonator , and this approximation allowed us to calculate the resonator spectrum @xmath100 in the coupled system . in this section , we add some remarks on the interpretation of the autocorrelator , the transition @xmath107 , and the linear approximation . moreover , we discuss how a small amount of disorder in the qubit parameters due to imperfections in the fabrication process affects the resonator spectrum  @xmath100 .       of the transverse - field ising chain with normalized transverse field @xmath108 in the cases @xmath109 ( black ) and @xmath107 ( magenta ) .",
    "]    by means of the spin  free - fermion mapping described in , one readily finds @xmath110 here and in the following , expectation values are calculated under the assumption of zero temperature .",
    "this is justified because the band gap of the ising chain is of the same order of magnitude as the qubit transition frequencies @xmath111 ghz ( except near the critical point ) and , thus , much bigger than the usual mk temperatures of a cryogenic environment . in the uniform case @xmath112 and",

    "however , the finite size of the tfic with @xmath109 causes a revival of @xmath105 at @xmath122 with @xmath123 $ ] ( @xmath124 for @xmath125 and @xmath126 for @xmath127 ) .",
    "this can be understood in the following way .",

    "taking the fourier transform of equations and yields the spectrum @xmath144 of the tfic for a force that couples to @xmath102 for finite @xmath0 and @xmath78 , respectively . in order to calculate the spectrum @xmath100 of the resonator , whose coordinate @xmath145 couples to @xmath102 [ cf.equation ] , we have suggested @xcite a useful approximation",
    ": we consider the tfic as a linear bath for the resonator .",
    "that is , we replace the tfic by a set harmonic oscillators having the spectrum @xmath146 of the tfic .",
    "this approximation can be straightforwardly generalized to other contexts , where a different many - body system couples to a resonator .",
    "it is justified in the limit of small qubit - resonator coupling @xmath106 , as we discuss in the following .",
    "the linear approximation for the tfic - bath fails as soon as probing the resonator sufficiently excites the tfic so that its nonlinearity becomes important .",
    "thus , the linear approximation requires small coupling @xmath147 and is worst if the tfic is on resonance with the resonator ( @xmath7 within the band @xmath58 of the tfic ) .",
    "the `` most nonlinear '' bath possible for the resonator , that is , the bath whose nonlinearity becomes important for the smallest value of @xmath147 , is a bath consisting of only a single qubit on resonance with the resonator . if the linear approximation is adequate for such a system in the limit @xmath106 , it will be also sufficient for our purposes .",
    "therefore , we now consider the case @xmath148 and @xmath149 of equation and calculate the spectrum of the resonator by linearizing the single - qubit - bath .",
    "since the atomic hilbert space is small for @xmath148 , we can then numerically check the accuracy of our approximation .",
    "we also compare our approximation with the resonator spectrum calculated analytically within the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) , which is the standard approximation of @xmath150 in this specific situation .    for @xmath148 and @xmath151 , the hamiltonian @xmath150 [ equation ] becomes @xmath152 that is , the resonator coordinate @xmath145 couples to a single - qubit - bath with hamiltonian @xmath153 via a force @xmath154 .",

    ", we also plot ( green ) the local magnetization of the first qubit @xmath257 of the uniform system ( as plotted in the left panel of figure 4 of @xcite ) .",
    "correspondingly , ( b ) shows for a uniform system as in figure s6 of @xcite ( green ) , and with @xmath225 disorder in @xmath395 and @xmath17 ( black ) .",
    "the plots demonstrate that the quench dynamics of the considered observables is not qualitatively affected by the presence of a small amount of disorder .     in a disordered tfic of length @xmath356 after a quench of the mean normalized transverse field @xmath398 ( right )",

    "@xmath17 are randomly chosen according to gaussian distributions with standard deviations of @xmath225 from the mean values @xmath90 and @xmath92 . ]    for a more systematic analysis of the disorder effects on the quench experiments considered here we make use of our findings for the mean free path of a propagating localized excitation from the previous section .",
    "this is possible because the quench dynamics of the tfic is governed by the propagation of quasiparticles ( qps ) through the system @xcite .",
    "these correspond to flipped spins , essentially like the localized excitation of the previous section .",
    "indeed , if the system is initially in the paramagnetic phase , the time evolution immediately after the quantum quench @xmath403 flips pairs of adjacent spins so that they point in the @xmath404-direction . due to the qubit - qubit coupling",
    ", these local excitations propagate as qps with velocity @xmath405 through the chain . for an interpretation of the quench dynamics and",
    "the time scales indicated in the plots ( all of which scale like @xmath406 ) in terms of these qps , see @xcite .",
    "if @xmath407 is in the paramagnetic phase , the mean free path @xmath311 of the qps in a disordered tfic can be estimated by @xmath408 according to the previous section .",
    "the characteristic quasi-@xmath409-periodic behavior ( @xmath410 ) of the local magnetization after the quench in the non - disordered tfic can be understood as a revival of coherence each time qps initially generated at the same spot meet again @xcite .",
    "this happens when the qps have travelled multiples of the chain length @xmath0 .",
    "if there should be a significant probability that two contiguously generated qps meet again at least once before being scattered and thus decrease the local magnetization at @xmath411 , the mean free path has to be sufficiently large , @xmath412 .",
    "the appearance of significant end - to - end correlations after the quench ( that are stronger than those for @xmath140 ) requires that qps generated in the middle of the chain reach the edges of the chain without being scattered , hence @xmath413 .",
    "we have performed numerical experiments which indeed suggest that the corresponding values of @xmath261 mark the transition to a degree of disorder where the described phenomena are no longer present . in that sense ,",
    "the distinctive features of the quench dynamics of the end - to - end correlator are less sensitive to disorder than those of the local magnetization ( and , due to the shorter time - scale , less sensitive to decoherence or decay ) .",
    "we finally note that also here the effective chain length can be adjusted by strongly detuning individual qubits ( this can also be used to create local quantum quenches by ` joining ' two initially independent chains ) and arbitrary effective potentials @xmath16 can be chosen .",
    "in the quest for controllable large - scale quantum systems , the framework of circuit qed offers several advantages , such as fast , high - fidelity readout , great flexibility in design , and steadily increasing coherence times .",
    "however , a potential significant disadvantage arises from the hardly avoidable static noise and disorder sources in these man - made devices .",
    "the central result of the present work is that also in this respect , there is reason to be optimistic : the requirements on the homogeneity of the system parameters for observing interesting ( and predictable ) many - body physics in a circuit qed system are not too high to be achievable with present - day or near - future technology .",
    "this underlines the prospects of circuit qed as a promising platform for implementing quantum simulations of complex quantum many - body hamiltonians .",
    "in addition , we have shown that circuit qed quantum simulators could be used to study deliberately the effects of tunable disorder on quantum many - body dynamics .",
