    "it is widely assumed that the warming of the northern hemisphere during the 20@xmath0 century was anomalous .",
    "greenhouse gases are indeed an agent of warming , however , exactly by how much they contributed to the 20th century rise in temperature and hence can be linked to human influence , remains an issue that has yet to be settled .",
    "the literature refers to this as the detection and attribution problem @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in most of the papers discussing this problem ,",
    "monthly local records of up to 120 years were consulted .",
    "some use a mixture of global and local records .",
    "up to 95 instrumental records going back 50 to 120 years from stations all over the globe were explored but indications of a warming of the atmosphere could not be found in the vast majority of cases @xcite .",
    "a totality of 17 local records and 15 global records from all over the world were examined for both the recent 50-year and the longer 100-year period , as well as a further 13 local records from different parts of the world for the last 50 years only @xcite .",
    "the authors found only weak support for the thesis that the warming trend in the last 50 years changed its character compared with the first 50 years of the 20@xmath0 century .    compared with the 20@xmath0 century",
    ", a different picture arises at the end of the 18@xmath0 century because all reliable instrumental temperatures for the northern hemisphere - there are no records for the southern hemisphere that go far enough back in time - show a 100-year - long decline during the 19@xmath0 century , turning into the better - known , recent centennial rise at the end of it .",
    "both rise and fall are of similar magnitude . therefore ,",
    "if the 20@xmath0 century temperature rise is considered to be deterministic , the same should apply to the fall in the 19@xmath0 century .",
    "if we assume anthropogenic co@xmath1 to be the agent behind the 20@xmath0 century rise , we face a problem when it comes to the 19@xmath0 century .",
    "additional information about temperature trends of 100 years duration is derived from reconstructed temperatures as proxies , here from tree rings and stalagmites .",
    "tree rings reflect the age of a tree in yearly steps , and the thickness of the rings yields information about the annual mean temperature @xcite . in the thin layers of stalagmites , the age of the layer",
    "is determined by the th / u method , and the annual mean temperature of the layer is deduced from the @xmath2o value @xcite .",
    "two high - quality proxies , one from tree rings and the other from a stalagmite , are analyzed here .",
    "both records go back about 2000 years and show during this period even stronger 100-year - long temperature rises and falls than prevailed in the 19@xmath0 and 20@xmath0 century .",
    "hence , the cause of both the 100-year - long temperature changes during the last 2000 years and the 20th century warming remains to be discovered .",
    "temperature series are persistent - other notations are long - term correlated or long - term memory - , which is a well - known phenomenon .",
    "a warm day is more likely to be followed by another warm day than by a cold day , and vice versa .",
    "short - term persistence of weather states on a time scale of about one week is caused by general weather situations .",
    "longer - term persistence over several weeks is generally caused by blocking situations that arise when a high pressure system remains in place for many weeks .",
    "persistence over many months , seasons , years , decades , and even longer periods is usually associated with anomaly patterns in sea surface temperatures , and even with the influence of long - term variations in the activity of the sun , but there is no universal explanation that can be used in all causes @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    in long - term correlated temperature series t@xmath3 , i = 1, .... ,n the autocorrelation function @xmath4 decays with increasing s according to the power law @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the average of the t@xmath3 , s is the time lag , and @xmath7 is the variance .",
    "typical values for the exponent in eq .",
    "( 2 ) are arranged between @xmath8 .    however , the most important characteristic of long - term correlated records is that they include natural fluctuations that appear to be trends caused by external impacts .",
    "figure 1 depicts an example .",
    "the synthetic record shows apparently similar 100-year - trends as for the hohenpeissenberg series , but the synthetic data are only long - term correlated . as a consequence , conventional methods based on moving averages can no longer be used with persistent records to separate deterministic trends from natural fluctuations .",
    "additionally , in persistent records often a clustering of extreme events that is , in reality , quite natural will seem to be caused by an external trend @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "long - term correlations were not only detected in temperature series , they are ubiquitous in nature at all time scales . among others , persistence was found in hydrological records , economic records , physiological records , and earthquake events @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "therefore , the power law of eq .",
    "( 2 ) characterizes the behaviour of persistent records quite generally .",
    "in this paper , linear regression lines are used for the analysis of temperature series . a temperature rise or fall",
    "@xmath9 is here generally due to the ( backward ) linear regression line for the 100 annual temperatures t@xmath10, .... ,t@xmath3 .",
    "following @xcite , the dimensionless , relative temperature change @xmath11 with @xmath12 as the standard deviation around the regression line is considered as the gauge for temperature changes ( the common standard deviation , which can be affected by an external trend is not feasible here ) .",
    "the temperature records that are analyzed in this article are available as medium - range monthly instrumental records and as annual long - range reconstructed records from tree rings and stalagmites . from the monthly data ,",
    "the seasonal effects have to be eliminated . at this , for each calendar month the mean value of the whole record is subtracted from the data and divided by the seasonal standard deviation yielding the normalized record t@xmath3 , i=1, ... ,n that will be applied in the further analysis .    in the following",
    ", the dfa ( and fa ) of temperature records is described . if temperature records contain external trends , the exponent @xmath13 in eq .",
    "( 2 ) has not the correct value .",
    "furthermore , the direct calculation of c(s ) by eq .",
    "( 1 ) is affected by side effects , for instance , the shortness of the record , and by deterministic trends @xcite .",
    "several methods to solve these problems have been propagated , the fluctuation method ( fa ) , the detrended fluctuation method ( dfa ) and wavelet analysis @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however , in particular the dfa yields correct results if the record contains external trends . for a start",

    "( 5 ) is linked to the power law of eq .",
    "( 2 ) by @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the exponent @xmath17 is usually referred as hurst exponent , because hurst was the first who detected long - term correlation in time series , but he used a different method - the rescaled range ( rs ) analysis @xcite . due to the already denoted limits of @xmath13 together with eq .",
    "( 6 ) , @xmath17 has the limits @xmath19 , where @xmath17 = 0.5 stands for complete randomness , and @xmath20 for very strong persistence . for @xmath17 @xmath21 1 ,",
    "the record becomes unsteady .",
    "the detrended fluctuation analysis dfa can be seen as an advanced fa , which automatically eliminates trends of the polynomial order @xmath22 from the profile y@xmath23 and - because y@xmath23 in eq .",

    "generally , a short segment at the end of the profile remains . in order not to neglect this segment ,",

    "z@xmath23 replaces y@xmath23 of eq .",
    "( 3 ) : @xmath28 finally , with @xmath29 the new f@xmath27(s ) replaces f(s ) of eq . ( 4 ) : @xmath30 in this study , only dfa@xmath1 is used . for purely long - term correlated data , the fluctuation function f@xmath27(s )",
    "scales like f(s ) in eq .",
    "( 5 ) with the same exponent @xmath17 .",
    "it is useful to depict f@xmath27(s ) as function of s in a log - log diagram , which enables the exponent @xmath17 to be easily evaluated .",
    "it should be stressed that eq .",
    "( 5 ) as well as the former eq . ( 2 )",
    "expresses the fact that a consistent scaling behavior is induced by the numerous mechanisms that generate persistence in temperature records . consequently , neither eq .",
    "( 2 ) nor a power law of the fa or dfa says anything about its origin .    in principle , the power law of eq . ( 5 ) does not depend on the time scale of s - whether monthly or yearly .",
    "a minimum of @xmath22 + 2 data points are needed for the fit procedure with polynomials of order @xmath22 , and for this reason , the f@xmath27(s ) graph begins with s@xmath31 = @xmath22 + 2 .",
    "a minimum of about n = 600 data points t@xmath3 are required to get reliable results from dfa . consequently ,",
    "monthly not annual data are indispensable for the fa and dfa of instrumental temperature records with 250 years length at the most .",
    "furthermore , reliable dfa results are confined to a maximum of s @xmath32 n/4 because otherwise the number of intervals n@xmath26 = int(n / s ) becomes too small .",
    "lastly , in f@xmath1(s ) the interval length s is too small for about the first five s values , and due to numerical effects , the hurst exponent becomes slightly too high in this domain .",
    "this reveals every double - logarithmic f@xmath1(s ) plot as a weak dip for a few of the first s values ( see figure 4 in paragraph 4 as an example ) .",
    "to summarize , dfa is reliable within @xmath33",
    "in the following , the probability that in a long - term correlated record with a hurst exponent @xmath17 the temperature change @xmath34 of a linear regression line over 100 years appears naturally is of main interest .",
    "natural denotes that there is no external trend in the record .",
    "following @xcite , @xcite , @xcite w(@xmath35 , @xmath17 ) indicates for a fixed hurst exponent @xmath17 the exceedance probability that values of @xmath36 over 100 years occur naturally .",
    "w(@xmath35 , @xmath17 ) is not restricted to positive @xmath37 .",
    "if one begins , by definition , with cooling , the exceedance probability converges to the theoretical limit of w = 1 for extremely strong negative @xmath38 values and decreases with rising @xmath35 . in natural records we have equal fractions with warming and cooling ,",
    "hence for all @xmath17 values w(0 , @xmath17 ) = 0.5 is valid . to give further examples , w(-2 , 0.7 )",

    "the general relation @xmath39 confirms congruent fractions with positive and negative @xmath40 values in natural records .",
    "if values of w over 0.5 belong to cooling , then , for instance , an exceedance probability of 0.9 would be as significant as of 0.1 for warming .",
    "the latest method to evaluate the exceedance probabilities w(@xmath38 , @xmath17 ) for natural records of a fixed @xmath17 in a systematical way is a combination of dfa , synthetic records , and monte carlo simulations @xcite , @xcite .",

    "the approximation of eq .",

    "( 10 ) of w(-1 , 0.8 ) = 0.84 .",
    "hence , the 16% percentage of long - term correlated or detrended real records with @xmath17 = 0.8 and 100 years in length shows warming at magnitudes @xmath51 .",
    "further , the 84% percentage of records shows a relative temperature change @xmath52 and , conversely , the 16% percentage of records a cooling at magnitudes @xmath53 .",
    "w can increase by several orders of magnitude when @xmath17 increases . as a consequence , an increase of @xmath43 @xmath21 0 , which is very unlikely for small @xmath17 values , becomes quite normal for larger ones . to give an example , @xmath17 = 0.6 yields w(1.5 , 0.6 ) = 0.003 ,",
    "but for @xmath17 = 0.8 this value increases to w(1.5 , 0.8 ) = 0.66 .    the use of the approximation in eq . ( 11 ) for the analysis of real temperature records that are detrended by dfa is based on the hypothesis that real records are long - term correlated with an additional trend .",
    "furthermore , for a reliable analysis , the trend is assumed to be linear . in order to distinguish between a natural fluctuation and an external trend ,",

    "in fact , all records in this paper - except for the mob record - are local , and the distance between them is no more than about 1000 km at the most . moreover , without further investigation into the reliability of the long - range reconstructed records , the discrepancies in the dfa results between the medium- and long - range records",
    "can not be explained .",
    "as figure 7 demonstrates , the f@xmath1(s ) graphs for spa12 and mob ( filled circles ) exhibit an unusual downward dip for about s @xmath65 20 years that exceeds the weak numerical effect already discussed . in an attempt to gain more insight here ,",
    "a simulation was carried out by synthetic records of p@xmath3 with a hurst exponent @xmath61 = 0.95 , simulating spa12 , and m@xmath3 with @xmath61 = 0.85 , simulating mob .",
    "as expected , the f@xmath1(s ) graphs of both synthetic records p@xmath3 and m@xmath3 ( open squares in figure 7 ) showed only the common weak downward dip .",
    "next , to simulate the strong downward dip , eq .",
    "( 12 ) was introduced to furnish the additional conditions for p@xmath3 and m@xmath3 : @xmath80 this provides @xmath81 and @xmath82 , which yield accordance ( open diamonds in figure 7 ) .",
    "an explanation of the strong downward dip might be that the effective time resolution of both spa12 and mob is in reality about 3 - 4 years , while the reconstructed temperature for each year is a 3 - 4 year mean . a similar dip on f@xmath1(s ) graphs in sea surface temperature ( sst ) records",
    "was found and the hypothesis advanced that it has to do with the influence of the north atlantic oscillation ( nao ) and the el ni@xmath83o southern oscillation @xcite .",
    "because no artifacts are known that could be responsible for a strong persistence lasting at least 600 years in both tree ring and stalagmite proxies ( see left panel of figure 7 ) , another agent may be supposed . for this purpose ,",
    "a reconstructed sunspot number record was used @xcite .",
    "this covers more than 10,000 years ( from -9455 to 1895 ad ) in 10-year time steps .",
    "direct sunspot number observations ( wolf numbers ) as yearly averages for the period 1700 - 1995 ad provided additional support @xcite .",
    "this completed record has been given the name ssn here , and covers a total of 11,450 years .",
    "it is used in smoothed 10-year steps .",
    "annual and monthly records are calculated from it by spline interpolation .",
    "the left panel of figure 8 shows the ssn from 0 to 1995 ad .",
    "the right panel depicts the dfa2 result for ssn , with 10 years steps and for the whole record length of 11,450 years ( smaller time steps for ssn do not change the dfa2 result significantly ) .",
    "apparently , the f@xmath1(s ) curve for dfa2 in eq .",
    "( 8) does not follow the scaling law of eq .",
    "as already stressed , there is an obvious conflict between the hurst exponents @xmath84 , derived from the instrumental data ( see table 2 and figure 4 in paragraph 4 ) , and @xmath85 , derived from the reconstructed temperatures for spa12 and mob ( see figure 7 in paragraph 5 ) .",
    "this paper advances the hypothesis of fluctuations in sunspot numbers , which are depicted in the left panel of figure 8 as an agent here .",
    "the sun s magnetic field modulates the cosmic ray flux hitting the earth .",
    "both cloud generation by cosmic rays and earth temperatures are the subject of intense discussion @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the reconstructed sunspot number record ssn in figure 8 is a visual representation of this presumed mechanism .",
    "the relatively slow fluctuations in sunspot numbers - as opposed to the fast fluctuations in monthly temperatures - act as a deterministic trend over the last two hundred years that is roughly linear for the short intervals of 20 to 50 years .",
    "( s ) from dfa2 for the ssn sunspot number record from -9455 ad to 1895 ad in 10-year steps .",
    "f@xmath1(s ) does not take the usual scaling behaviour of @xmath86 of eq .",
    "( 5 ) for long - term correlated records , but instead shows a sliding gradient without any distinctive cross - over before s = 3000 years .",
    "the s values up to about 100 years have an @xmath87 , which drops down to @xmath84 for s @xmath63 1000 years .",
    "the lines with @xmath17 = 2 and @xmath17 = 0.6 are for comparison.,height=279 ]    in the medium - range records , the ssn trend is therefore identified as linear by dfa2 and is removed , which explains the low detrended hurst exponents . however , in the long - range spa12 and mob records , the fluctuations in ssn are not linear , and are , therefore , not removed by dfa2 .",
    "consequently , they increase the hurst exponent .",
    "the sunspot number hypothesis claims that the instrumental records would also reveal greater hurst exponents provided that they were well over 250 years in length .",
    "unfortunately , no such records exist .",
    "this means that the hypothesis could only be tested on synthetic records . a 17,880 month ( 1490 years )",

    "figure 9 unveils a cross - over between 500 and 1000 months ( 40 - 80 years ) . on the left of it ,",
    "the hurst exponent @xmath90 corresponds to the instrumental records and on the right , @xmath91 corresponds to spa12 and mob .",
    "it should be pointed out that merely superimposing two synthetic records with different hurst exponents will not show a crossover .",
    "figure 9 provides an explanation of the different hurst exponents in the instrumental and reconstructed records : the detrended fluctuation analysis dfa2 removes the sunspot fluctuations as linear trends from the instrumental records that results in their low hurst exponents .",
    "it was already shown due to eq .",
    "( 9 ) that f@xmath1(s ) is only feasible for s @xmath59 n/4 , hence for monthly records that are about 220 years in length the limit of about s = 50 years holds . as a consequence ,",
    "series that are not distinctly over 250 years long are basically too short to reveal by dfa2 the extreme long - term persistence caused by the sun . in figure 4 , in fact ,",
    "no cross over is visible , except for a rather feeble one for paris .",
    "however , in the case of the longer time frame , the situation changes .",
    "if we look at the css synthetic record as well as at spa12 and mob , the ssn sunspot numbers correspond here to a fast fluctuation , which increases the hurst exponent @xmath61 and is not removed by dfa2 .",
    "instrumental records going back a maximum of up to about 250 years from present show the temperature declines in the 19@xmath0 century and the rises in the 20@xmath0 to be of similar magnitudes .",
    "if we assume anthropogenic co@xmath1 to be the agent behind the 20@xmath0 century rise , we face a problem when it comes to the 19@xmath0 century . the detrended fluctuation analysis ( dfa2 ) evaluated - for the five records selected here - very small natural probabilities for both centennial events . therefore , the probability that they are the result of deterministic trends is high , but what actually caused the trends to be diametrically opposed remains unknown .",
    "in contrast , two high - quality long - range records , spa12 and mob , show frequent centennial rises and falls of equal and greater magnitudes than their shorter instrumental counterparts during the last 2000 years",
    ". smoothed spa12 and mob records are reported to be in accordance with other biological proxies , indicating that centennial fluctuations at least as strong as those of the past 250 years were indeed common events .",
    "this is further confirmed by the dfa hurst exponents of @xmath85 for spa12 and mob that are far higher than the @xmath84 of the instrumental records . as a consequence ,",
    "the impact of anthropogenic greenhouse gases is most probably a minor effect and - in view of the 19@xmath0 century temperature fall of similar magnitude - not appropriate as an authoritative explanation for any temperature rise in the northern hemisphere during the 20@xmath0 century .",
    "because no reliable explanation can be given for the conflict between the different hurst exponents and probabilities in the instrumental and reconstructed records , a hypothesis of solar influence ( manifesting itself in long - term sunspot fluctuations ) could be put forward to explain the contradiction . a monthly synthetic record covering about 1500 years and using a hurst exponent of @xmath17 = 0.6 , which corresponds to the instrumental records",
    "was therefore superimposed on the trend of the sunspot numbers . the dfa2 result for",
    "this combined record shows that it embodies both the short persistence of the instrumental data and the long persistence of the reconstructed data .",
