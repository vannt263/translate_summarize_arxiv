    "the chromium tris  acetylacetonate @xmath10 ( or @xmath3 ) belongs to the @xmath9diketonate complexes of transition metals crystallizing in the molecular type lattices .",
    "the @xmath9diketonates of metals @xmath11 are widely used in practice ( to separate metals , to apply metal coatings , as catalysts etc . ) .",
    "the field of their application is extending with time , which encourages their further comprehensive investigations .",
    "the compounds @xmath11 were actively studied in thermodynamical [ 13 ] and crystallochemical @xcite aspects . in the recent years they have became the subject of theoretical inquiry @xcite .    when investigating the properties of @xmath9diketonates we have found some interesting effects in these compounds , before unknown .",
    "in this work two of such effects have been detected in the properties of @xmath3 : 1 ) anomalies in low temperature heat capacity ; 2 ) a reversible change in color of crystals when cooling them to liquid nitrogen temperature ( thermochromism ) .",
    "the samples @xmath10 synthesized for this investigation are crystalline powder with the average size of crystallites 0.30.5 mm . at the room temperature",
    "they are dark violet .",
    "the samples were defined by the methods of chemical analysis , ir ",
    "spectroscopy , derivatography and x  ray phase analysis .",
    "the heat capacity of @xmath3 has been measured by the adiabatic method within the range @xmath12 using the installation described in refs @xcite .",
    "the anomalous component was extracted by subtracting the regular heat capacity obtained by means of technique described in @xcite .",
    "three anomaly were found in the heat capacity : the small peak at @xmath0 , the anomaly with maximum at @xmath1 , and the broad anomaly within the range @xmath2 ( see fig .  [ figdct ] ) .     of @xmath3.__,width=377,height=302 ]",

    "the ground orbital state of @xmath5 ion in the octahedral surrounding of @xmath3 is singlet ; @xmath23factor of @xmath24 configuration of ion @xmath5 is close to @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the large anisotropy of esr  spectra has been observed which results from large shifts of spectra due to the large second order corrections to the parameters of fine structure when the initial split is comparable with zeeman interaction .",
    "the decrease of temperature from @xmath26 to @xmath6 results in the broadening of lines without any change of their positions , for some lines such a broadening results in their total disappearance .     ? ? in the visible region ? ? at 78 k and 300 k.__,width=377,height=264 ]    the transmission spectra of @xmath3 within the frequency range @xmath27 @xmath28 have been obtained at room and nitrogen temperatures using the two  ray spectrophotometer specord of @xmath29 type ( fig .",

    "the sample was prepared of powder placed between two quartz plates and then heated up to @xmath3 melting temperature ( @xmath30 ) . after cooling the solid continuous layer of @xmath31 mm thick was formed .    comparing the spectra obtained in the green region ( @xmath32  @xmath28 ) at room and nitrogen temperatures one can see the shift of the transmission band maximum to the violet side by @xmath33  @xmath28 .",

    "the interval @xmath40",
    "@xmath28 is the borderline range of the lattice and molecular vibrations .",
    "the higher frequencies are rated as molecular ones .",
    "the band within the range @xmath39 @xmath28 being wide at @xmath41 splits up into the separate components when the temperature decreases .",
    "the detail analysis showed that the frequencies of these components depend on the temperature , but their relative intensity doesnt depend on it . when the temperature reaches @xmath1 the new band at @xmath42  @xmath28 appears which was absent at higher temperature .",
    "it was discovered in this work that the sample dark  violet at the room temperature becomes red when immersed into liquid nitrogen ( thermochromism ) .",
    "this change in color is reversible . in order to follow the change in color with temperature ,",
    "a special experiment was carried out .",
    "the sample placed on a copper substrate was immersed in the bath with liquid nitrogen .",
    "temperature of the substrate and sample was measured by copper ",
    "constantan thermocouple , the color of the sample was estimated by eye .",
    "when the temperature slowly increased , the red color had remained within the range @xmath43 .",
    "the color of the sample varied smoothly within the range @xmath44 , at @xmath45 it had turned dark violet and then it stayed as such at the further increase of temperature up to room one .",
    "an additional experiment with 36 compounds showed that the reversible effects of thermochromism was observed for most of @xmath9diketonates of transition metals , when cooling them with the liquid nitrogen .",
    "most of tried 36 compounds grew light when the temperature decreased .",
    "the most pronounced changes in color were observed for cobalt ( iii ) , copper ( ii ) and chromium ( iii ) compounds .",
    "the compound @xmath46 , being dark green at room temperature , became violet .",
    "the compound @xmath47copper(ii ) acetylacetonate  hexafluoroacetylacetonate , being green at room temperature , became blue .",
    "the change in color of @xmath3 has been described above .",
    "the nature of discovered anomalies in heat capacity is still unknown .    for the moment we have no additional information about the anomaly at @xmath48 .",
    "the @xmath49like anomaly at @xmath1 might display some long range ordering in the substance .",
    "its temperature is close to temperature @xmath50 , where the total entropy of @xmath3 crystal has the maximal temperature derivative .",
    "the collective long range ordering in solids is often having been detected at that temperature @xmath50 , where the derivative of the total entropy in temperature is maximal ( see , for example , superconducting effect in htsc or the ordering of another nature in refs .",
    "@xcite@xcite ) .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility data show that the anomalies in the heat capacity do not result from any magnetic phase transitions .",
    "then , one can suppose the anomaly to result from the change in the structure of the crystal or of the molecule .",
    "but in raman spectra no significant change indicative of structural transformation in the crystal ( of phase transition ) was observed .",
    "that s why the crystal isnt thought to be arranged as a whole . in this case one may expect a rearrangement or an ordering of the loosely bound atoms or separate structural fragments : molecules @xmath3 , ligands @xmath51 or groups @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the analysis of the internal vibrations of the molecule in raman spectra has shown no change in structure of molecule with temperature .",
    "the absence of magnetic anomalies testifies that the symmetry of ion @xmath5 crystal surrounding does not change substantially within the temperature range under investigation .",
    "this means that the change in geometry of molecule is hardly probable in the vicinity of chromium ion .",
    "one should rather expect some change connected with the dynamics of the methyl groups .",
    "the torsional vibrations of methyl groups were identified in raman spectra of @xmath54and @xmath55 @xmath9diketonates @xcite .",
    "they were detected below @xmath56 in the frequency region @xmath57",
    "one may suppose that just as in ref .",
    "[ 16 ] the new band @xmath42  @xmath28 appeared in raman spectra of @xmath3 below @xmath18 ( fig.5 ) results from the scattering on the torsional vibrations of the methyl groups .",
    "only these vibrations can show an observed temperature behavior of the line intensity in raman spectra .    according to bose ",
    "einstein distribution the function @xmath58 entering in the general expression for the heat capacity and characterizing the statistical weight of vibrational modes is @xmath59 the maximal change of statistical weight of vibrational mode @xmath60 occurs at the temperature @xmath61",
    ". then the maximal change of the statistical weight of the torsion vibrations",
    "@xmath42  @xmath28 ( @xmath62 ) falls at @xmath63 .",
    "it is interesting to note that this value is close to the temperature of the anomaly in heat capacity ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "this @xmath49like anomaly ( fig.1 ) might display some long range ordering all over the crystal below @xmath1 .",
    "the torsional vibrations of the methyl groups observed in raman spectra at low temperatures arise at the same temperature @xmath64 .",
    "the assumed long range ordering might be attributed just to the dynamics of the methyl groups .    within the temperature range 110240",
    "k the diffuse anomaly in heat capacity takes place . within the same temperature range ( 120210 k )",
    "the smooth change in the sample color has been detected .",
    "when temperature decreases from @xmath7 to @xmath6 the esr spectra exhibit the broadening of lines without any change of their energetic position ( fig.3 ) .",
    "such a broadening might be explained by the appearance of additional indirect anisotropic interaction which results from the decrease of the mobility of separate fragments of @xmath3 molecule with temperature .",
    "this broadening is observed within the same temperature range where the diffuse anomaly in heat capacity and the smooth change in the sample color take place .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility shows the weak deviation of experimental points from the curie ",
    "weiss low within the same temperature range @xmath20 .",
    "one can suppose that ions @xmath5",
    "responsible for the paramagnetic behavior of @xmath3 crystals might be slightly affected by the change of some fragments of @xmath3 molecule with temperature .",
    "the change of energetic state of these fragments might result in the small perturbation of the crystal field .",
    "the last results in redistribution of electron density , shift of the transmission spectra and change in color of crystals when temperature varies from liquid nitrogen to room one .",
    "in the present study some effects have been discovered in the low temperature properties of chromium tris ",
    "acetylacetonate @xmath3 , which have not been observed before : the effect of thermochromism and three anomalies in heat capacity .",
    "anomalies in heat capacity generally display some transformations in a substance .",
    "there are no considerations as regards the anomaly at @xmath48 .    as for the @xmath18anomaly ,",
    "the assumption has been put forward that it might display some long range ordering taken place in the @xmath53  subsystem at this temperature .",
    "the rise of torsional vibrations of @xmath53  methyl groups at the same temperature was the basis for this assumption .",
    "besides , it was detected that the wide diffuse anomaly in the temperature range @xmath65 was accompanied with some features in esr and transmission spectra , with weak deviation of the magnetic susceptibility from the curie ",
    "weiss low , and change in color of the sample in the same temperature range .",
    "all these features were assumed to be attributed to a change with temperature of some fragments of the @xmath3 molecule which are still to be recognized .",
    "to verify our tentative insight into the nature of discovered effects the complex investigation of @xmath9diketonates of other transition metals with different ligands should be carried out .",
