    "as emphasized by iachello @xcite , atomic nuclei offer an exciting ground to explore phase transitions occurring at different temperatures @xmath2 .",
    "indeed , for these systems at @xmath3 a phase transition is signaled by the change they undergo from spherical to ellipsoidal shapes ; at @xmath4  mev evidence exists for a liquid - gas transition and , finally , at @xmath5  mev the deconfinement of the hadronic ( nuclear ) matter is conjectured to take place .",
    "as it is well - known , at @xmath3 the phase transitions are referred to as _ quantum phase transitions_. in fact , they occur in correspondence to special ( critical ) values of a coupling constant , viewed as a continuous variable , entering into the nuclear hamiltonian : thus , they are driven , rather than by thermal fluctuations , as it is the case at finite @xmath2 , by quantum fluctuations .    in connection with quantum fluctuations , besides atomic nuclei , also neutron stars are systems worth to be explored . indeed ,",
    "the strong magnetic field present in these systems might be generated by a strong ferromagnetic core in the stellar interior .",
    "although a lot of effort has been devoted to this issue ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for some recent work ) , no firm conclusions have been reached at present .    in this paper",
    "we do not attempt a realistic calculation of the spin polarization of a neutron star , but rather we address general aspects of a quantum phase transition in an infinite homogeneous system of interacting neutrons , viewing the strength @xmath6 of a spin - spin ferromagnetic neutron - neutron force ( admittedly schematic with no pretense of being realistic ) as a control parameter . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have indeed found that a critical value of the control parameter , namely @xmath7 , exists such that , for @xmath8 , an incipient ferromagnetism sets in into the system .",
    "we have computed @xmath7 , following two different paths :    * random phase approximation ( rpa ) on a hartree - fock ( hf ) basis ( rpa - hf ) , * anomalous single - particle propagator formalism ,    the latter only in the case of a zero - range force , finding that they lead to identical results .    as it is well - known , the onset of the ferromagnetic phase into an infinite , homogeneous system is signaled , on the one hand , by the divergence of the system spin response function at vanishing frequency in the limit @xmath9 , corresponding , in coordinate space , to a very large spin - spin correlation length at the critical point . on the other hand , in the broken phase the order parameter @xmath10 ( @xmath11 being the system s magnetization operator ) acquires a finite expectation value : in ref .",
    "@xcite we obtained the latter through the stoner equation @xcite .",
    "equivalently one says that a vanishing ( or a finite ) value of @xmath10 corresponds to a symmetric ( or to a broken ) vacuum , respectively .",
    "a second critical value @xmath12 of the control parameter , associated to the system s full magnetization or to a completely broken vacuum , exists and was found in ref .",
    "@xcite in the anomalous propagator framework only for the case of a zero - range interaction . in the present work",
    "we first explore the impact of the finite range of the force , embedded in a parameter @xmath13 , on @xmath12 .",
    "this task was already carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath7 , which was computed as a function of @xmath14 , @xmath15 being the fermi momentum of the system , in the rpa - hf framework . here",
    "we employ the anomalous propagator formalism which allows not only to test the previous rpa - hf results for @xmath16 , but also to get the range dependence of the upper critical value .",
    "a second issue addressed in this work relates to the nature of the collective modes of the system _ in the broken vacuum_. in this connection one should distinguish between collective modes in the ( longitudinal ) @xmath17-direction ( assumed to coincide with the one along which the system s spontaneous magnetization occurs ) and in the direction orthogonal to @xmath17 ( transverse ) . in the latter case the collective excitations truly represents the goldstone modes of the system : these inevitably occur in presence of a spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry ( in the present case the spin - rotational one ) .",
    "we shall later address the issue of the number of these modes : here it suffices to say that in the present case just one goldstone mode exists .",
    "we compute the collective modes of the system in the rpa - hf framework , using again , for the sake of simplicity , a zero - range ferromagnetic force and determining as a preliminary the region in the @xmath18 plane where the response of the system occurs : this turns out to be different for the modes developing in the @xmath17-direction and for those expanding in the plane orthogonal to @xmath17 .    in the former the region results from the interplay of four parabolas , characterized by the fermi momenta @xmath19 and @xmath20 , for spin up and spin down particles , respectively , which identify the broken vacuum .",
    "the values of @xmath19 and @xmath20 are set by the strength of the interaction @xmath6 . the four parabolas eventually coalesce into two when the system becomes fully magnetized . in these kinematical domains the response function to a longitudinal probe displays a collective behavior , however embedded in the particle - hole continuum and hence damped .",
    "specifically , when the system is partially magnetized , for not too large values of @xmath21  namely where the pauli principle is active  the response displays two maxima , one of which is strongly softened and enhanced with respect to the free case , whereas the other is pushed up close to the upper boundary of the response , where it almost coincides with the peak already displayed by the free response : this situation is reminiscent of the splitting of the giant dipole resonance in deformed nuclei @xcite , although the physical interpretation of the upper peak is different in the two cases ( see later ) . for larger @xmath21  where the pauli principle is no longer felt  the two maxima merge into one , still somewhat softened with respect to the free case , if @xmath21 , while large , is not too large .    remarkably , for a fully magnetized system",
    " that is for a completely broken vacuum  no collective mode in the @xmath17-direction turns out to be possible : an occurrence , however , strictly valid only for a zero - range interaction .    turning to",
    "the transverse collective modes , when the vacuum is broken by a ferromagnetic spin - spin interaction a region free of single - particle response opens up in the corner of the @xmath18 plane : here is where the goldstone boson lives .",
    "actually the latter , as we shall see , displays  in the combined rpa and hf framework and for not too large momenta  a parabolic ( rather than linear ) dispersion relation : hence , according to the general theory of the spontaneous symmetry breaking in the non - relativistic regime @xcite , it turns out to be a goldstone mode of second kind .",
    "it is remarkable that the rpa - hf theory accounts for its existence through a parabolic dispersion relation , which , however , for larger momenta deviates from the parabolic behavior .",
    "indeed , it develops , just before entering into the particle - hole continuum , a maximum that entails the vanishing of the group velocity of the propagating mode .",
    "much information on the collective motion in a many - body system can be gained already through the moments of the response function , referred to as _",
    "sum rules_. in the final part of this work we shall consider the zeroth ( @xmath22 ) and the first ( @xmath23 ) moments , commonly called the coulomb and the energy - weighted sum rules , respectively .",
    "specifically , we shall address the issue of finding out how their value is affected by the amount of symmetry breaking occurring in the vacuum , i.  e. in the system s ground state .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : crit ] we deal with the problem of determining the critical values of the control parameters and their dependence upon the range of the interaction . in section  [ sec : zaxis ] we explore the response of the system in the presence of a spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "specifically , we analyze the system s response in the direction ( referred to as longitudinal ) along which its spontaneous magnetization occurs . in section  [ sec : xaxis ] we study the system s response orthogonal to the direction of the spontaneous magnetization ( referred to as transverse ) . here",
    "the goldstone nature of the system collective excited state is thoroughly discussed . finally , in section  [ sec : moments ] , the same issue is addressed in the context of the moments of the system s response functions ( the so - called _ sum rules _ ) . in the concluding section",
    "we summarize our work and shortly discuss the nature of the quantum phase transitions addressed in our research .",
    "also , we shortly discuss their significance for the physics of the atomic nuclei and of the neutron stars .",
    "we have recalled in the previous section that unlike the symmetric vacuum , which is specified by just one fermi momentum @xmath15 , the broken vacuum of our system is characterized by two fermi momenta @xmath19 and @xmath20 : these fix the densities of the particles with spin up and spin down , respectively .",
    "the equilibrium condition for our system at zero temperature reads then : @xmath24 where the single - particle energies    [ eq : omegapm ] @xmath25    embody the exact hartree - fock ( hf ) self - energy that , while diagonal , is no longer proportional to the unit matrix .",
    "indeed for the interaction ( in momentum space ) @xmath26 the anomalous hf self - energy turns out to read    @xmath27 \\nonumber\\\\    & & -\\frac{v_1\\lambda^3}{(2\\pi)^2 } \\left[\\frac{k_f^+}{\\lambda}-      \\left(\\arctan\\frac{k_f^+-k}{\\lambda}+      \\arctan\\frac{k_f^++k}{\\lambda}\\right)\\right . \\nonumber\\\\    & & + \\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\frac{(k_f^{+})^2}{\\lambda k}-\\frac{k}{\\lambda }      + \\frac{\\lambda}{k}\\right )      \\ln\\frac{1+(k_f^++k)^2/\\lambda^2}{1+(k_f^+-k)^2/\\lambda^2 } \\nonumber\\\\    & & + 2\\left(\\frac{k_f^-}{\\lambda}-\\left(\\arctan\\frac{k_f^--k}{\\lambda }      + \\arctan\\frac{k_f^-+k}{\\lambda}\\right)\\right . \\nonumber\\\\    & & + \\left.\\left.\\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\frac{(k_f^{-})^2}{\\lambda k}-      \\frac{k}{\\lambda}+\\frac{\\lambda}{k}\\right )      \\ln\\frac{1+(k_f^-+k)^2/\\lambda^2}{1+(k_f^--k)^2/\\lambda^2}\\right)\\right ]      \\\\\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for spin up neutrons and @xmath28    for the spin down ones .",

    "in the present study we have dealt with an infinite , non - relativistic , homogeneous system of neutrons interacting through a simple ferromagnetic force of heisenberg type , our aim being to discuss general aspects of the spontaneous symmetry breaking associated with a quantum phase transition .",
    "although this theme has been much addressed in the past for generic spin @xmath0 fermions ( see , e.  g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , still we felt it useful to analyze in more detail the dependence upon the interaction range of the critical values of the coupling and the excitation spectrum of a system undergoing a quantum phase transition .",
    "concerning the latter , we like to remind that the symmetry breaking taking place in our system , namely the onset of a permanent , spontaneous magnetization , stems from a well identified physical source , a situation very different , for example , from the electroweak symmetry breaking in the standard model , where the responsible for such an occurrence , namely the higgs boson , is still searched for three decades after having been conjectured . indeed , in our system",
    " just like in a ferromagnet the electromagnetic interaction between neighboring atoms lines up their spins parallel to each other  the force between neighboring neutrons produces the same effect , provided that the strength of the interaction exceeds some critical value , @xmath49 .",
    "how close the neutrons should be for the phase transition to occur or , equivalently , how the range of the interaction affects the value of @xmath49 ?",
    "we have answered this question both numerically and analytically , finding out , as expected , that the longer the range , the weaker the strength of the coupling should be in order to induce the spontaneous breaking of a symmetry .",
    "a further natural question to ask is how large @xmath6 should be for the system to become fully magnetized .",
    "also for this problem we provide a numerical and an analytic answer , again confirming the above referred to correlation between strength and range .",
    "we have next analyzed the spectrum of the system ( or , equivalently , the response functions to external probes acting on the spin of the constituents ) , following its evolution with the amount of spontaneous symmetry breaking occurring in the ground state .",
    "probing the system along the direction of the spontaneous magnetization , the chief feature of the response function relates to the occurrence of two distinct peaks , which reflect both the action of the ferromagnetic force and of the pauli principle .",
    "indeed , the two peaks merge at large transferred momenta , where the latter disappears .    in the direction orthogonal to the magnetization",
    ", on the other hand , a collective goldstone mode shows up as required by the theory .",
    "its dispersion relation is indeed parabolic , as it should , over a momentum range that increases as the coupling strength @xmath6 increases .",
    "actually , for @xmath173 , the goldstone boson exhausts the energy - weighted sum rule and its dispersion relation becomes a perfect parabola .",
    "notably , for a strength @xmath6 intermediate between the two critical values @xmath49 and @xmath45 , the goldstone boson dispersion relation displays an anomalous non - parabolic behavior , entailing the existence of a wavelength associated with a vanishing group velocity of the collective mode .",
    "we conjecture this to be a distinctive signature of the goldstone boson in the non - relativistic regime .    in spite of the simplicity of our interaction , which has of course no pretense of being realistic",
    ", it appears that our research bears significance for the physics of the neutron stars , since it explores the extension of the many - body response theory to the situation associated with a broken vacuum in a spin space , which is required for the assessment of the magnetic field that neutron stars host .",
    "a lot of work has actually been lately done on this issue : interestingly , it appears that simple effective interactions  such as the skyrme ones  give indeed rise to a phase transition of second kind @xcite , whereas more microscopic many - body approaches  such as the brueckner - hartree - fock formalism @xcite or quantum simulations @xcite  give no indication of a quantum phase transition .",
    "generally speaking , this striking difference can be related to the different predictions these models give for the particle - hole spin interaction at neutron star densities : attractive in the skyrme models and repulsive in calculations based on realistic nucleon - nucleon potentials @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , at present there are no direct phenomenological constraints on this component of the effective nuclear interaction at densities relevant for the neutron stars .",
    "in connection with the possible application of the concept of spontaneous symmetry breaking to the physics of the atomic nuclei , it should be of course realized that in finite systems the notion of phase transition applies only approximately . yet , one is naturally lead to think of heavy nuclei , where the isospin symmetry is broken , leading to ground state configurations quite similar to the ones we have been considering in the spin space . however , in isospace the symmetry is broken explicitly ( by the coulomb force ) and not spontaneously ( as in our case ) .",
    "thus , although for heavy nuclei the response region of the system in the @xmath18 plane turns out to be very similar in both cases @xcite , in nuclear matter no collective goldstone boson should show up in the small @xmath78 , small @xmath21 corner of the @xmath18 plane .",
    "furthermore , in the isospin particle - hole channel  the one appropriate to the present considerations  no attraction seems to exist .",
    "here we derive the exact expression for @xmath177 . in eq .",
