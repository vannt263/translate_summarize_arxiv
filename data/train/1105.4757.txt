    "historically , o3 stars have been considered to represent the highest mass main - sequence , i.e. core hydrogen - burning stars .",
    "however , it is now recognised that some hydrogen - rich , nitrogen sequence wolf - rayet stars may be main - sequence stars possessing still higher masses ( de koter et al . 1997 ; schnurr et al . 2008 ; smith & conti 2008 ; crowther et al .",
    "morphologically , it has long been recognised that there is a relatively smooth progression from o dwarfs through giants and supergiants to the wn sequence ( walborn 1971 ; conti 1976 ; crowther et al .",
    "1995 ) . indeed ,",
    "walborn ( 1982a ) introduced the hybrid o3if*/wn6 classification for sanduleak 67@xmath1 22 , located in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "such stars , often referred to as ` hot ' slash stars , possess intermediate spectral characteristics between o3 supergiants ( e.g. hd93129a ) and wn6 stars ( e.g. hd93162 ) .",
    "a second flavour of dichotomous spectrum , known as ofpe / wn9 or ` cool ' slash stars , was introduced by walborn ( 1982b ) and bohannan & walborn ( 1989 ) , although alternative wn911 subtypes are now in common usage for such stars ( smith et al .",
    "1994 ) .    since the original study of o3if@xmath2/wn6 stars by walborn ( 1982a ) ,",
    "the transition from photographic plates to digital detectors and increased samples have permitted the extension of the mk system to o2 ( walborn et al .",
    "2002 ) , while smith et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have added to the classification of wn stars .",
    "indeed , the widespread availability of high quality spectroscopic datasets for o and wn stars  such as the vlt - flames tarantula survey ( evans et al .",
    "2011 ) - allows us to reassess the hybrid of / wn classification .    here ,",
    "we present a revised of / wn classification scheme which takes into account recent changes for of and wn stars , based in part upon previously unpublished high - quality , blue - violet echelle spectrograms .",
    "section 2 describes archival and new very large telescope ( vlt ) observations , while our scheme is described in section 3 .",
    "section 4 provides an overview of of / wn stars at near - ir wavelengths , while a qualitative study of such stars is presented in section 5 , together with a discussion of their evolutionary significance . in section 6",

    "we have sought to discriminate o23.5if@xmath2/wn57 from o23.5if@xmath2 and wn57 stars through the presence of h@xmath0 emission , providing niv @xmath34058 is present in emission . however , for completeness the potential implications of our criteria for stars in which niv @xmath34058 is weak / absent also need to be considered , including a second class of star historically classified as of / wn .",
    "this second flavour of ` / ' star , was introduced by walborn ( 1982b ) and bohannan & walborn ( 1989 ) to refer to another category of peculiar stars , assigned ofpe / wn9 .",
    "in contrast with the _ intermediate _ o23.5if@xmath2/wn subtypes , the ofpe / wn9 classification was intended to denote _ alternative _ descriptions / interpretations for the same object .",
    "indeed , walborn ( 1977 ) had earlier suggested _ either _ a oiafpe or wn9 ( or wn10 ) classification for one such star , hde 269227 .",
    "the latter designation was preferred by smith et al .",
    "( 1994 ) who proposed wn911 to distinguish between stars of varying ionization , while bohannan & crowther ( 1999 ) also argued that ofpe stars should be reclassified as wn9 ha .",
    "nevertheless , ofpe / wn9 remains in common usage both for surveys of external galaxies ( e.g. bresolin et al . 2002 ) and highly reddened stars within the inner milky way ( e.g. mason et al .",

    "[ wn8 - 9 ] ( see also chapter 3 of gray & corbally 2009 ) .",
    "the spectral morphology of mid to late - type of stars resembles late wn stars in the vicinity of heii @xmath34686 .",
    "we also note that p cygni h@xmath0 _ is _ relatively common in late of supergiants , including r139 ( o6.5iafc + o6iaf , taylor et al .",
    "2011 ) , hd151804 ( o8iaf , crowther & bohannan 1997 ) and he3759 ( o8if , crowther & evans 2009 ) .",
    "analogously to o23.5if@xmath2/wn transition stars , we have considered the possibility of an intermediate category for stars in which niv @xmath34058 emission is weak / absent .",
    "recall that wolf - rayet spectral types are intended for predominantly emission line stars at visible wavelengths , while o spectral types are appropriate for primarily absorption line stars .",
    "in contrast with ` hot ' transition stars , late - type of and wn stars can be cleanly distinguished in fig .",
    "[ wn8 - 9 ] .",
    "specifically , wn89 stars exhibit strong p cygni hei @xmath34471 , versus absorption in late - type of stars .",
    "walborn ( 1975 ) has previously highlighted the development of p cygni hei @xmath35876 from hd 151804 ( o8iaf ) and hd 152408 ( o8iafpe or wn9 ha ) to hd 151932 ( wn7h ) .",
    "other morphological differences include heii @xmath34542 , @xmath34200 and the complex around h@xmath4 .    on the basis of presently available observations , we therefore propose restricting _ intermediate _ of / wn classifications solely to the earliest o subtypes . for lower ionization stars in which niv @xmath34058 is weak / absent , yet",
    "each of heii @xmath34686 , niii @xmath54634 - 41 and h@xmath0 are in emission , we favour :    1 .",
    "adhering to existing wn subtypes if the morphology of he i @xmath34471 is a p cygni profile ( e.g. ns4 , wn9h ) or wnha if , in addition , the morphology of heii @xmath34541 , @xmath34200 are p cygni profiles ( e.g. hde313846 , wn9 ha ) .",
    "2 .   retaining existing o supergiant spectral types if the morphology of hei @xmath34471 is in absorption ( e.g. hd151804 , o8iaf)4471 is observed in absorption in hst / fos spectroscopy , in spite of h@xmath0 emission .",
    "crowther & dessart ( 1998 ) had tentatively proposed wn9 ha for r136b , although an earlier wn8 subtype would have been more appropriate since niv @xmath34058 is detected at a 45@xmath6 level . ] .",
    "we present a revised classification scheme for oif@xmath2/wn57 stars , in order to take into account various revisions to the of@xmath2 ( walborn et al . 2002 ) and mid - wn ( smith et al . 1996 ) subtypes since the initial introduction of this subclass ( walborn 1982a ) .    1 .",
    "we propose that o23.5if@xmath2 , o23.5if@xmath2/wn57 and wn57 stars may be discriminated using the morphology of h@xmath0 : purely in absorption for o23.5if@xmath2 stars ; p cygni for o23.5if@xmath2/wn57 stars ; purely in emission for wn stars .",
    "2 .   based upon our updated scheme",
    "at least ten of / wn objects are identified in the lmc ( primarily 30 doradus ) and milky way ( carina nebula , ngc 3603 , westerlund 2 ) .",
    "since many young high mass stars in the milky way are visually obscured due to dust extinction we also discuss approximate criteria from which early of , of / wn57 and wn57 subtypes may be discriminated from near - ir spectroscopy .",
    "we emphasise that high quality blue - visual spectroscopy provides superior diagnostics .",
    "we suggest that the majority of o23.5if@xmath2/wn57 stars are young , very massive hydrogen - burning stars , genuinely intermediate between o23.5if@xmath2 and wn57 subtypes , although a minority are apparently lower mass core helium - burning stars evolving blueward towards the classical wn sequence .",
    "we suggest that transition stars form a larger subset of the lmc wn population than that of the milky way due to weaker stellar winds and a higher percentage of very massive stars within 30 doradus with respect to typical galactic star forming regions .",
    "5 .   on the basis of presently available observations ,",
    "we do not favour _ intermediate _ of / wn subtypes for heii @xmath34686 emission line stars in which niii @xmath5463441 @xmath7 niv @xmath34058 .",
    "we advocate : ( a ) wn89 spectral types if the morphology of hei @xmath34471 is p cygni , or ( b ) mid- to late- of supergiant subtypes if hei @xmath34471 is observed in absorption .",
