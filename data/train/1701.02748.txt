    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , our knowledge of how molecular cloud structure relates to star formation is rapidly evolving . over the past decade",
    ", this link has been explored via detailed observations of clouds in our own galaxy .",
    "these show that the density structure inside molecular clouds is governed by super - sonic turbulence , which creates a ( column ) density probability distribution function ( pdf ) of log - normal shape ( see review by * ? ? ? * ) . in molecular clouds forming stars",
    ", observations also find that this pdf exhibits a power - law tail at high column densities .",
    "this tail corresponds to small , pc - sized , high ( column ) density gas clumps likely to collapse under their self - gravity and form a new generation of stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we also observe that the structure of molecular clouds has an imprint on the output stellar population : the shape of the clump mass function and the stellar initial mass function are similar ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; there is an apparent column density threshold for high mass star formation @xcite ; and the maximum cloud mass and maximum stellar cluster mass in galaxies correlate and both increase with the gas pressure @xcite .",
    "the number of clouds and the diversity of physical environments and evolutionary states that can be probed in the milky way remain limited . with the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma )",
    ", we can now resolve molecular cloud structure in the nearest galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this allows the prospect to measure the link between galactic environment , cloud structure , and star formation beyond only the solar neighborhood .",
    "a main first target of such studies are low mass , low metallicity galaxies .",
    "these `` primitive '' systems are of interest because they appear so different from large spiral galaxies like the milky way .",
    "they have large reservoirs of atomic gas in extended distributions , with long total gas consumption times and high gas mass fractions compared to present - day large spiral galaxies .",
    "their low abundance of metals affects their observed properties and may be expected to influence the abundance of cold gas , the structure of cold clouds , and the ability of gas to form stars .",
    "these targets are of particular interest because early galaxies share many of these properties .",
    "although present day dwarf galaxies are not perfect analogs to early - universe systems , the first galaxies were certainly born with few metals and few stars , so that the physics that we measure in these local galaxies would have also been at play there .",
    "metals , both in the gas phase and in the form of interstellar dust , should affect the structure of star - forming clouds .",
    "gas - phase metals act as important coolants , while dust shields cloud interiors from external radiation , which would heat the gas and dissociate molecules .",
    "interstellar dust also facilitates molecule formation via reactions on grain surfaces . because low temperatures make the gas clouds susceptible to gravitational collapse , both cooling and shielding are important to the ability of gas to form stars .",
    "if the formation of cold , dense gas depends on the abundance of metals , then pristine ( low metallicity ) environments may be rendered inefficient or unable to form stars .",
    "on the other hand , recent theoretical work suggests that molecules may not be essential to form cold , dense gas because neutral atoms or ions ( e.g. , carbon and oxygen ) can act as effective coolants in pristine gas @xcite .",
    "however , these regions may also host h@xmath11 molecules because of the absence of dissociating radiation . in this case",
    ", the main effect of a lack of metals may be observational , rendering molecular gas hard to see or changing the balance of atomic and molecular gas in cold regions but not the overall ability of gas to form stars .",
    "an observational confirmation of this picture remains to be made .",
    "we need observations to test how metals affect molecular cloud structure and star formation , but the lack of metals complicates the process of observing molecular clouds . in our galaxy ,",
    "molecular cloud structure is mapped by observing dust extinction , dust emission , or molecular line emission .",
    "unfortunately , h@xmath11 molecules are a very inefficient emitter in the cold interstellar medium and absorption measurements require a bright background source .",
    "less common , but more visible molecules , most commonly carbon monoxide ( co ) , are used to trace h@xmath11 .",
    "of course , both dust and co are made of metals , complicating their use to trace gas in metal - poor systems .",
    "for co the problem is even more complex , because the abundance of co depends on shielding by dust or h@xmath11 from dissociating radiation and the conditions for co to survive differ somewhat from those for h@xmath11 to survive . in the solar neighborhood , this is only a modest concern because dust absorbs energetic photons over a broad wavelength range . as result ,",
    "co and h@xmath11 are well - mixed and co observations provide an efficient and reliable tracer of the molecular gas . in low metallicity environments this is no longer the case . with decreasing metal and thus dust abundance ,",
    "h@xmath11 self - shielding becomes the primary shielding mechanism against dissociating radiation .",
    "due to its low abundance co can not ( effectively ) self - shield and persists only in regions where h@xmath11 has absorbed all dissociating radiation in the lyman - werner bands @xcite .",
    "thus , co emission traces only the densest , most opaque parts of molecular clouds , while h@xmath11 remains to fill most of the cloud volume .",
    "these physics are thought to give a strong metallicity dependence for the co - to - h@xmath11 conversion factor averaged over whole clouds or galaxies ( see review by * ? ? ?",
    "despite these concerns , co remains the second most abundant molecule in metal - poor galaxies and co emission is an indispensable tool to detect cold , dense clouds and map their structure .",
    "other indirect tracers of h@xmath11 , including optical extinction , dust emission , ionized or neutral atomic lines , and other molecular lines also suffer from metallicity effects .",
    "more practically , the resolution and sensitivity of alma still makes co the fastest way to map molecular cloud structure at low metallicity .",
    "observations do show co emission to be faint in low metallicity galaxies . the ratio of co emission to star formation is a strong function of metallicity , with more metal - poor galaxies showing much less co per unit star formation than metal - rich galaxies @xcite . observations of molecular clouds in the magellanic clouds at @xmath15  pc resolution show that their co luminosities are much lower than those of galactic clouds of comparable size ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , dust emission indicates significant amounts of h@xmath11 gas ( i.e. , excess ir emission for their  mass ) so that the co - to - h@xmath11 conversion factor can be orders of magnitude higher than in our galaxy @xcite . following the physical scenario above , one popular interpretation of these observations",
    "is that co is selectively photodissociated compared to h@xmath11 over a large area in low metallicity molecular clouds ; in this case , co molecules persist only in the most opaque , densest gas clumps ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the most direct test of this scenario is to resolve the structure of individual low metallicity molecular clouds . for a long time , this was only possible in the large and small magellanic clouds ( lmc and smc with @xmath16 and @xmath17 solar abundance , respectively ) , and even then only at @xmath18  pc resolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "alma changes this , allowing @xmath19pc scale measurements of cloud structure in low metallicity galaxies throughout the local group .",
    "@xcite demonstrated this capability , presenting a sub - pc - resolution view of a ( small ) part of the 30 doradus region in the lmc .",
    "recently , @xcite presented  observations from the local group galaxy wlm , which has only @xmath20 solar abundance .",
    "they found co emission to originate from small ( @xmath21  pc across ) structures that fill only a tiny fraction of the molecular cloud area . despite strong differences in co morphology",
    ", @xcite estimated that the physical properties ( density , pressure , and self - gravity ) of these co - emitting structures are comparable to clumps of similar size in metal - rich clouds as observed in the solar neighborhood .",
    "this result argues that the star formation process and the resulting stellar population ( e.g. , stellar initial mass function and star cluster properties ) may be only weakly affected by changing metallicity , with the main influence of metallicity to be changing the distribution of the co tracer molecules .",
    "@xcite found ten co - emitting clumps in two molecular clouds in one galaxy and @xcite studied a single region . with the goal of a statistical measurement of the structure of co in low metallicity clouds over a wide area , we used alma to map  emission across five star - forming complexes in the local group dwarf galaxy ngc 6822 .",
    "these five regions contain the bulk of the ongoing star formation activity in ngc 6822 . by using a set of large mosaics ( 260 pointings in total ) at @xmath22  mm , we are able to cover the whole area of each complex , from cloud core to outskirts , while still achieving the highest spatial resolution ( 2  pc ) yet reached to study cloud structure in any galaxy beyond the magellanic clouds .    in this paper , we present this new alma survey of ngc 6822 ( ) and use it to measure the structure of the star - forming ism at low metallicity ( ) .",
    "our results are presented in .",
    "we estimate the global co luminosity of ngc 6822 ( ) . then we measure the large - scale properties  size , mass , density , and phase balance  of the atomic - molecular complexes that host the co emission ( ) .",
    "subsequently we characterize the spatial and spectral intensity distribution of co emission from these complexes by comparing it to other pdr tracers ( ) and to those in galactic molecular clouds ( ) . finally , we derive the small - scale properties  size , line width , mass , and gravitational boundedness  of the co - bright clumps in our data and compare them to comparable - size structures in wlm and our own galaxy ( ) .",

    "we stress that considerable uncertainties remain in this analysis mainly due to the large uncertainty in the dust mass .",
    "we speculate that the large discrepancy in @xmath159 between fields is linked to the evolutionary state of the star - forming complex .",

    "the @xmath64 emission traces warm dust heated by young , embedded stars . at this scale ,",
    "@xmath64 sources correspond to an early , embedded phase of star formation that takes place before feedback can disrupt the parent gas cloud .",
    "the distribution of @xmath64 intensity is concentrated into a few ( @xmath229 ) bright sources per survey field .",
    "each @xmath64 source is associated with a co - bright structure , but the reverse is not true .",

    "instead , we see the neutral gas ( including the co - bright clumps ) swept up at the boundary of the  region bubbles  a picture that is well known from galactic star - forming clouds ( e.g. , the w3/w4 molecular cloud  region complex ; see images by * ? ? ?",
    "thus the @xmath102 emission correlates most directly with co emission .",

    "the curves for @xmath102 are steep , and high co fractions are reached over a small intensity range near @xmath231  mjy  sr@xmath30 .",
    "a contour with this intensity does a good job of predicting where bright co emission may be found .",
    "our results reinforce the idea from @xcite and @xcite that pah emission can provide a predictor of the location , and perhaps strength , of co emission in low metallicity environments .",
    "we have used @xmath102 here ; given the full - sky coverage of the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ) it will be important to test whether the same conclusions would apply using the @xmath232 pah feature covered by wise s band  3 .",

    "we show this in , where we plot the fraction of total flux above a specified co pixel intensity threshold ( expressed as intensity times channel width , @xmath233 ) . for reference we also plot the distributions for our three galactic comparison clouds after convolving them to the resolution of our data ( 2pc @xmath2 0.635 ) and applying the same masking procedure that we use for ngc 6822 .",
    "the distributions in ngc 6822 differ from those of the milky way clouds , with emission coming from a narrower range of intensities in the ngc 6822 data . less flux and less pixels show either low or high intensities .",
    "the absence of low intensity emission may be explained physically , corresponding to a suppression of co abundance in regions that are weakly shielded .",

    "this plot shows clumps in the outer galaxy to be marginally bound , with @xmath254 , while clumps in ngc 6822 are offset by a factor of @xmath63 toward larger virial parameters .",
    "this has two natural interpretations .",
    "either the use of a galactic conversion factor leads us to underestimate the clump mass in ngc 6822 or the clumps in this galaxy are unbound or pressure - confined .",
    "the main result from is that the properties of clumps in the three galaxies are similar independently of their host galaxy s mass or metallicity .",
    "differences are small , a factor of @xmath255 , and comparable to what we might expect from differing methodologies , flux recovery issues , assumptions about excitation .",
    "still , there is evidence here for either a different , more pressure - confined dynamical state for the ngc 6822 clumps or a slightly higher co - to - h@xmath11 conversion factor on scales of a few parsecs .",
    "we return to the implications of these results in & [ subsec : sfgas ] .",
    "we identify @xmath132 compact co structures in our cubes .",
    "these co - bright clumps have an average size of @xmath256 pc , velocity dispersion of @xmath257 , and virial mass of @xmath258  ( see ) . these sizes and masses are small compared to a whole giant molecular cloud , so we have referred to these as `` clumps . ''",
    "the very small size of these clumps is a main observational result of this paper .",
    "it shows that many previous results regarding the faintness of co in dwarf galaxies can be explained in terms of beam filling : bright co is confined to small structures that occupy only a small portion of the available area .",
    "observations with physical beams larger than our 2  pc will dilute this intensity and so will recover faint co emission .    following an analysis presented by @xcite for wlm , we evaluate the dynamical state of the clumps in three ways : ( a ) assuming approximate virialization , so that @xmath259 , the clumps have a gas mass surface density of @xmath260  and an h@xmath11 volume density of @xmath261 @xmath153 .",
    "( b ) we can consider pressure equilibrium between the internal turbulent pressure of the co clumps and external pressure by the weight of the overlaying gas layers of the atomic - molecular complex and the diffuse atomic medium . the external pressure due to self - gravity on the co clump is @xmath262 where @xmath263  is the sum of gas columns of the atomic - molecular complex and the diffuse ism .",
    "this pressure has to be balanced by the internal pressure @xmath264 due to turbulence which , if turned around , requires an h@xmath11 density of the clumps of @xmath265 @xmath153 .",
    "( c ) the volume density required for collisional excitation of co rotational transitions is @xmath266 @xmath153 @xcite .",
    "overall , we conclude that the virial density , excitation density , and pressure equilibrium density for the h@xmath11 gas in the co - bright clumps are quite similar around @xmath266 @xmath153 and therefore considering these gas structures to be in ( quasi ) dynamical equilibrium seems justified .      our analysis of the co - bright clumps in ngc 6822 has shown that their macroscopic properties are very similar ( with possible offsets less than a factor of two ) to co - bright structures within our galaxy . for our adopted @xmath253 and @xmath252 ,",
    "the clumps in ngc 6822 have @xmath189 lower surface brightness and a factor of @xmath255 higher virial masses or virial ratios for fixed ( co - inferred ) luminous masses .",
    "there are three easy explanations which can explain the ( apparent ) small difference to the galactic observations .",
    "( 1 ) the co excitation is sub - thermal and @xmath146 is closer to the standard value ( @xmath267 ) derived for milky way clouds or massive disk galaxies .",
    "this would directly remove the difference in surface brightness but leave clumps in ngc 6822 to be slightly less bounded than in the milky way .",
    "( 2 ) the co - to - h@xmath11 conversion factor is larger ( by a factor of @xmath268 ) than the standard value for milky way clouds or massive disk galaxies , which would be motivated by the lower surface brightness ( due to a lower beam filling factor ) and results in identical virial ratios in ngc 6822 and the milky way . ( 3 ) the more massive shielding layers around the co - bright clumps in ngc 6822 provide sufficient external pressure to bring the internal turbulent pressure and self - gravity into a dynamical balance . in the previous sections we have seen that the required changes listed here are all consistent with our measurements within the uncertainties and thus either of the three cases or a combination of them provide a viable pathway to explain our observations .",
    "we can therefore conclude that the structure of the atomic - molecular complexes and the co - bright clumps in ngc 6822 seems normal in terms of density , pressure , and column density , and that they appear to be marginally gravitationally bound .",
    "the main effect of the lower co abundance in ngc 6822 is to lower the brightness and extent of the co - bright structures .",
    "this explains why the clumps in ngc 6822 and the milky way populate the same loci in plots of scaling relations of their macroscopic properties ( see ) .",
    "@xcite have arrived at the same set of conclusions in their analysis of ten co - bright clumps in wlm which has only @xmath20 solar metallicity . taken these results together ,",
    "we conclude that clumps inside molecular clouds appear to be in virial equilibrium after the non - negligible contribution of surface pressure from the surrounding gas is accounted for .",
    "we find no dependence on gas phase metallicity over @xmath269 solar metallicity .",
    "the dynamical state of dense clumps  the location where stars form  is thus indistinguishable between clouds in the milky way or nearby low metallicity dwarf galaxies .",
    "we have determined the co - to - h@xmath11 conversion factor , @xmath159 , on several scales . on the largest scales , our result mirrors the discussion in : integrating over our dust - inferred molecular gas masses and dividing by the alma  luminosity",

    "the former term may scale as @xmath282 as derived by @xcite .",
    "for the cloud complexes in ngc 6822 ( @xmath283 and @xmath284 ) this results in @xmath285 and thus a similar increase in @xmath159 ( assuming no change in @xmath281 given the similarity of the co - bright clumps in ngc 6822 and the milky way ) .",
    "this prediction is @xmath286 times below our measurement of @xmath159 for complexes in ngc 6822 .",

    "the underlying reason for this discrepancy remains unclear , but dust maps of higher fidelity seem necessary to resolve these questions .",
    "as has shown , we find different @xmath159 values for different complexes with a substantial difference between the two co - bright fields 2  &  4 , where @xmath287 , and the co - faint fields 1  &  3 , where @xmath288 . the difference may be linked to the evolutionary state of the complexes .",
    "the two co - faint complexes ( fields 1  &  3 ) with high @xmath159 also have prominent  regions with fewer signatures of compact embedded star formation at @xmath64 .",
    "this might also lead to more dissociating photons and weaker shielding because the gas has been dispersed by stellar feedback , in which case we might expect a larger component of h@xmath11 without co. by contrast , the other two complexes ( fields 2  &  4 ) may be in an earlier state , with embedded star formation and gas more concentrated and better shielded .",
    "this could lead to the overall brighter co emission and the lower conversion factors .",
    "while this scenario does make sense `` by eye , '' we might also expect this case to produce co intensity distributions that differentiate the fields in this way .",
    "however , this does not appear to be the case for our four complexes and warrants further investigation with larger samples .",
    "we also constrain the co - to - h@xmath11 conversion factor via dynamical measurements at small scales of individual dense clumps .",
    "if we assume that the dynamical state of the clumps in ngc 6822 and wlm is the same as for those in the milky way , then the difference in the apparent ratio of virial mass to luminosity reflects differences in @xmath159 as small as a factor of @xmath255 despite metallicity variations of @xmath289 when measured for dense clumps on spatial scales of only a few parsec .    in summary",

    "all three explanations are viable .",
    "one of our main results is that the ( well - shielded ) co - bright clumps in ngc 6822 have similar physical properties such as size , column and volume density , and dynamical equilibrium state as equally - sized structures in the milky way and largely unaffected by the low ( @xmath17 solar ) metallicity of ngc 6822 .    by modeling the infrared emission of dust ,",

    "the co - to - h@xmath11 ratio can be very low in low metallicity systems on spatial scales ( few @xmath290 ) of whole molecular clouds to the entire galaxy while it can approach galactic values inside small ( @xmath19pc ) , dense , well - shielded gas clumps .    at the current star formation rate",
    ", the molecular gas component of the complexes will be exhausted within @xmath314 myr ; a timescale in agreement with previous measurements of other nearby , low mass galaxies . however , we caution that this short timescale may not apply to the entire galaxy since our survey targeted selectively regions of active star formation .",
    "we apply the theoretical model by @xcite to estimate the bias in the depletion time for small apertures focused on star - forming regions and find that the global molecular gas depletion time may be as long as @xmath63 gyr and thus similar to massive disk galaxies .",
    "this analysis also suggest a significant population of quiescent molecular clouds and a considerable molecular gas fraction of @xmath340 within the star - forming disk of ngc 6822 or @xmath341 the entire galaxy .",
    "the alternative explanation to explain the short depletion times  a recent burst in star formation  does not seem to apply to ngc 6822 .",
    "we caution that these results require detailed follow - up but they raise the possibility that low metallicity dwarf galaxies may harbor significantly more molecular gas than inferred by previous surveys and that low and high mass galaxies may share similar molecular gas depletion times as has been proposed in several theoretical models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a future homogeneous analysis of gas and dust tracers of all local group galaxies will provide a definitive answer .    beyond the mystery of the complex - scale accounting , this work raises several prospects for fruitful follow - up .",
    "the good correspondence between high resolution @xmath102 and co emission reinforces the potential , already highlighted by @xcite and @xcite , for pah signatures including those observed by wise at @xmath232 to trace molecular gas in the low metallicity galaxies .",
    "the compact , confined nature of the co emission in ngc 6822 agrees with the physical picture that a lack of dust shielding pushes co emission deep into molecular clouds at low metallicity ; a direct , pc - scale comparison of the distributions of dust and co could measure whether the threshold for co emission is indeed the same in dwarf galaxies and the milky way ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "finally , the highly structured nature of the emission in our fields offers the possibility to employ a combination of co and  kinematics to probe the kinematics of gas in atomic - molecular complexes across the whole range of scales present in one of our fields , in the process    the authors thank the anonymous referee for a careful and constructive report that improved this paper .",
