    "the nasa _ kepler _ mission @xcite , at its heart a statistical endeavor , has provided a rich dataset that enables ensemble studies of planetary populations , from gas giants to earth - sized planets .",
    "such investigations can yield valuable statistical constraints for theories of planetary formation and subsequent dynamical evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "individual discoveries , however , provide important case studies to explore these processes in detail , especially in parameter space for which populations remain small . because of its unprecedented photometric sensitivity , duty cycle , and time coverage , companions that are intrinsically rare or otherwise difficult to detect are expected to be found by _",
    "kepler _ , and detailed study of such discoveries can lead to characterization of poorly understood classes of objects and physical processes .    planets orbiting red giants are of interest because they trace the planetary population around their progenitors , many of which are massive and can be hard to survey while they reside on the main sequence .",
    "stars more massive than about @xmath11 ( the so - called kraft break ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have negligible convective envelopes , which prevents the generation of the magnetic winds that drive angular momentum loss in smaller stars .",
    "their rapid rotation and high temperatures  resulting in broad spectral features that are sparse in the optical  make precise radial velocities ( rvs ) extremely difficult with current techniques .",
    "however , as they evolve to become giant stars , they cool and spin down , making them ideal targets for precise radial velocity work ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "there is already good evidence that planetary populations around intermediate mass stars are substantially different from those around their low mass counterparts .",
    "higher mass stars seem to harbor more jupiters than do sun - like stars @xcite , and the typical planetary mass correlates with the stellar mass @xcite , but there are not many planets within @xmath10au of more massive stars @xcite , and their orbits tend to be less eccentric than jupiters orbiting low mass stars @xcite . due to the observational difficulties associated with massive and intermediate - mass main - sequence stars ,",
    "many of the more massive stars known to host planets have already reached an advanced evolutionary state , and it is not yet clear whether most of the orbital differences can be attributed to mass - dependent formation and migration , or if planetary engulfment and/or tidal evolution as the star swells on the giant branch plays a more important role .    while the number of planets known to orbit evolved stars has become substantial , because of their typically long periods , not many transit , and thus very few are amenable to detailed study .",
    "in fact , _ kepler_-91b @xcite and _",
    "kepler_-56c @xcite are the only two massive planets ( @xmath12 ) orbiting giant stars ( @xmath13 ) that are known to transit such planets listed in the exoplanet orbit database ( exoplanets.org ) , none transit . ] .",
    "a transit leads to a radius measurement , enabling investigation of interior structure and composition via bulk density constraints and theoretical models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and also opens up the possibility of atmospheric studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which can yield more specific details about planetary structure , weather , or atomic and molecular abundances within the atmosphere of the planet .",
    "such information can provide additional clues about the process of planet formation around hot stars .    in studies of orbital migration of giant planets , the stellar obliquity ",
    "the angle between the stellar spin axis and the orbital angular momentum vector  has proven to be a valuable measurement , as it holds clues about the dynamical history of the planetary system ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "assuming that the protoplanetary disk is coplanar with the stellar equator , and thus the rotational and orbital angular momenta start out well - aligned , some migration mechanisms ",
    "e.g . , type ii migration @xcite ",
    "are expected to preserve low obliquities , while others  for example , kozai cycles ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , secular chaos @xcite , or planet - planet scattering ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may excite large orbital inclinations .",
    "measurements of stellar obliquity can thus potentially distinguish between classes of planetary migration .",
    "the rossiter ",
    "mclaughlin effect @xcite has been the main source of ( projected ) obliquity measurements , although at various times starspot crossings ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , doppler tomography of planetary transits ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , gravity - darkened models of the stellar disk during transit ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the rotational splitting of asteroseismic oscillation modes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have all been used to determine absolute or projected stellar obliquities .",
    "most obliquity measurements to date have been for hot jupiters orbiting sun - like stars , but to get a full picture of planetary migration , we must study the dynamical histories of planets across a range of separations and in a variety of environments .",
    "luckily , the diversity of techniques with which we can gather this information allows us to begin investigating spin  orbit misalignment for long period planets and around stars of various masses and evolutionary states . for long - period planets orbiting slowly rotating giant stars , the rossiter ",
    "mclaughlin amplitudes are small because they scale with the stellar rotational velocity and the planet - to - star area ratio , and few transits occur , which limits the opportunities to obtain follow - up measurements or to identify the transit geometry from spot crossings .",
    "fortunately , the detection of asteroseismic modes does not require rapid rotation , and is independent of the planetary properties , so it becomes a valuable tool for long period planets orbiting evolved stars .",
    "the high precision , high duty - cycle , long timespan , photometric observations of _ kepler _ are ideal for both identifying long period transiting planets and examining the asteroseismic properties of their host stars .    in this paper , we highlight the discovery of _ kepler_-432b and c , a pair of giant planets in long period orbits ( @xmath14  days ) around an oscillating , intermediate mass red giant",

    "cofiam acts like a harmonic filter , removing any long term periodicities in the data but protecting those variations occurring on the timescale of the transit or shorter , so as to retain the true light curve shape .",
    "the algorithm requires an estimate of the times of transit minimum , orbital period , and full transit duration . since @xcite provided refined values for these quantities , we used these updated values to conduct a revised cofiam detrending of the _ kepler _ data .",
    "as with the previous analysis , the final light curves are optimized for a window within three transit durations of the transit minima .    due to the effects of stellar granulation on the photometry",
    ", we find that the light curve scatter clearly exceeds the typical photometric uncertainties . in order to obtain more realistic parameter uncertainties , we added a `` jitter '' term in quadrature to the photometric uncertainties to yield a reduced chi - squared of unity for the out - of - transit data .",

    "the @xmath27  long - cadence transits for which no sc data was available and the @xmath28  sc transits were stitched together and regressed to a transit model using multinest .",
    "our light curve model employs the quadratic limb darkening @xcite routine with the @xcite `` resampling '' prescription for accounting for the smearing of the long - cadence data .",
    "the seven basic parameters in our light curve fit were ratio - of - radii , @xmath29 , stellar density , @xmath30 , impact parameter , @xmath31 , time of transit minimum , @xmath32 , orbital period , @xmath33 , and the limb darkening coefficients @xmath34  and @xmath35 described in @xcite .",
    "in addition , we included an 8th parameter for the log of the contaminated light fraction from a blend source , @xmath36 .",
    "this was constrained from adaptive optics imaging ( ao ; see ) to be @xmath37 with a gaussian prior , assuming gaussian uncertainties on the magnitudes measured from ao .",
    "ordinarily , a transit light curve contains very little information on the orbital eccentricity and thus it is not possible to reach a converged eccentricity solution with photometry alone @xcite .",
    "however , in cases where the parent star s mean density is independently constrained , a transit light curve can be used to constrain the orbital eccentricity and argument of periastron @xcite .",
    "this technique , an example of ap , enables us to include @xmath24  and @xmath23  as our 9th and 10th transit model parameters .    to enable the use of ap , we impose an informative gaussian prior on the mean stellar density given by the asteroseismology constraint ( @xmath38kgm@xmath39 ; ) .",

    "if a planet does not transit , as is the case for _ kepler_-432c , determining the authenticity of the planetary signal is less straightforward .",
    "an apparent radial - velocity orbit can be induced by a genuine planet , spots rotating on the stellar surface @xcite , or a blended stellar binary @xcite .",
    "both of these false positive scenarios should manifest themselves in the shapes of the stellar spectral lines .",

    "if there is also a brighter visual companion inside the resolution limit of our high resolution images ( @xmath631  au projected separation ) , it could be a binary with a @xmath632-day period responsible for the rv and bisector span variations on that timescale .",

    "kepler_-432  exhibits strong oscillations , so one may wonder whether these could induce the observed rv signal for the outer planet .",

    "we conclude that both detected orbits are caused by bona fide planets orbiting the primary star .",
    "following the keplerian mcmc fitting procedure described in , we wish to understand whether these posterior solutions are dynamically stable  i.e .",
    ", whether they describe realistic systems which could survive to the @xmath59  gyr age of the system .",
    "when presenting our results in the sections that follow , we use the planet  planet separation as an easily visualized proxy for stability : given the semi - major axes of the two planets@xmath641  and @xmath642au  separations greater than @xmath643au are clear indications that the system has suffered an instability and the planets subsequently scattered .",
    "if some solutions do prove to be unstable , it will lead to further constraints on the orbital elements , and thus the planetary masses .",
    "we perform integrations of both coplanar and inclined systems .",
    "we first explore the less computationally expensive coplanar case to understand the behavior of the system , and then extend the simulations to include inclination in the outer orbit , which has the additional potential to constrain the mutual inclination of the planets .",
    "to understand this stability , we utilize the integration algorithm described in @xcite .",
    "this algorithm uses a symplectic method in jacobi coordinates , making it both accurate and rapid for systems with arbitrary planet - to - star mass ratios .",
    "it uses calculations of the tangent equations to evaluate the lyapunov exponents for the system , providing a detailed insight into whether the system is stable ( up to the length of the simulation examined ) or exhibits chaos ( and hence instability ) .    for the coplanar systems , we take the ensemble of @xmath618  solutions generated in ( which form the basis of the reported elements in column 2 of table  [ tab : planetary ] ) and convert these to cartesian coordinates , assuming that the system is coplanar and edge - on ( @xmath644 ) , and hence both planets have their minimum masses .",
    "we then evolve the systems forward for a fixed period of time ( more detail supplied in below ) and examine some critical diagnostics for the system ( e.g. , the lyapunov time , and the planet  planet separation ) to understand whether the system remains stable , or whether some significant instability has become apparent .    for the inclined systems , we assume that the inner ( transiting ) planet is edge - on , and hence retains its measured mass .",
    "however , the outer planet is assigned an inclination that is drawn randomly from a uniform distribution @xmath645 , and its mass is scaled by a factor @xmath646 . as such , the outer planet can have a mass that is significantly above the minimum values used in the coplanar case .",
    "the longitude of ascending node for the outer planet is drawn randomly from a uniform distribution between @xmath539 and @xmath647 .",
    "we then proceed as in the coplanar case , integrating the systems forward in time to understand whether the initial conditions chosen can give rise to long - term stable systems .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that @xmath648  timesteps per inner - most orbit is sufficient to ensure numerical stability in symplectic integrations .",
    "as the inner planet has a period @xmath649  days , we use a timestep of @xmath10  day in all of our simulations , ensuring that our integrations will comfortably maintain the desired energy conservation and hence numerical accuracy .",
    "we begin by taking a random selection of @xmath617 of the @xmath618 solutions from and integrating them for a period of @xmath650  yr ( @xmath651 timesteps ) .",
    "while this is _ not _ a particularly long integration period compared with the period of the planets ( @xmath649 and @xmath628  days ) , we demonstrate that even during this relatively short integration , approximately half of the systems become unstable .",
    "tellingly , the unstable systems all tend to be the systems in which the outer planet has particularly high eccentricity .",
    "we illustrate this in figure  [ fig : stability ] , where we plot the mass - eccentricity plane for the outer planet ( @xmath652 ) and plot the separation between the two planets in the system at @xmath653  yr .",
    "as described above , separations greater than @xmath643au indicate that the system has suffered an instability .",
    "this initial simulation clearly demonstrates that at @xmath653  yr essentially all systems with @xmath654 are unstable , all those with @xmath655 are stable , and those with @xmath656 are `` mixed , '' with some being stable and some being unstable .",
    "given this promising demonstration that the dynamical integrations can restrict the set of solutions , we go on to integrate the systems for increasingly longer periods of time .",
    "to save on integration time / cost , we only select the stable solutions from the previous step , and then extend the integration time by an order of magnitude , perform a stability analysis , and repeat . by this method ,",
    "the @xmath617 systems at @xmath657 are reduced to @xmath658 stable systems at @xmath650yr , @xmath659 stable systems at @xmath617yr , and @xmath660 stable systems at @xmath618yr .",
    "we illustrate in figure  [ fig : stability ] the successive restriction of the parameter space in the mass - eccentricity plane for the outer planet ( @xmath652 ) as the integration timescales increase .",
    "we find that the long - term stable systems occupy a significantly smaller region of parameter space in the @xmath661 plane .",
    "in particular , we see the eccentricity of the outer planet is restricted to @xmath662 .    using the @xmath660 systems which remained stable at @xmath618yr",
    ", we use the same method as in to determine a new set of best - fit orbital paramters .",
    "that is , we use a gaussian kernel density estimator to smooth the posterior distribution and select the mode ( i.e. , the value with the largest probability density ) .",
    "the errors correspond to values with equal probability density that enclose the mode and @xmath514  of the pdf .",
    "the most significant changes in the best - fit parameters occurred for the outer planet , most notably for eccentricity and velocity semi - amplitude , resulting in smaller and more symmetric error bars and a revision in the best - fit minimum mass for planet c.      in a manner similar to the coplanar analysis of , we begin by taking all @xmath618  solutions from and integrating them for a period of @xmath650yr ( @xmath663  timesteps ) .",
    "however , in these inclined system integrations , the outer planet has an inclination that is not edge - on , and hence a mass for the outer planet that is inflated compared to its minimum edge - on value , as described in .",
    "a much larger fraction of the inclined systems become unstable in the first @xmath650yr , and we find that the @xmath664  systems at @xmath657 are reduced to @xmath665  stable systems at @xmath650yr .",
    "integrating these stable systems while keeping the pre - assigned inclinations for the outer planet ( i.e. , we do _ not _ re - randomize the inclinations ) we integrate this subset on to @xmath617yr , and find that the number of stable systems subsequently reduces to @xmath666 .",
    "we plot these stability results as a function of mass and inclination of the outer planet in figure  [ fig : inclined ] .",
    "we find that the vast majority of the stable solutions are ( somewhat unsuprisingly ) restricted to the range of parameter space with relative inclinations @xmath667  ( i.e. , @xmath668  in figure  [ fig : inclined ] ) .",
    "there is a small population with significantly higher eccentricities and relative inclinations that remains stable at @xmath669yr , and it is possible that these systems exhibit strong kozai oscillations , but their long - term ( @xmath670yr ) behavior has not been investigated .",
    "we emphasize that the inclinations and longitudes of the ascending node were assigned _",
    "randomly _ , and hence it is possible that specifically chosen orbital alignments could allow for enhanced stability in certain cases .",
    "unfortunately , because some systems remain stable even for highly inclined outer orbits ( @xmath671 ) , we are unable to strongly constrain the mutual inclination of the planetary orbits .",
    "we also note that the presence of a distant stellar companion ( as detected in our ao images ) or additional , as yet undetected , planets ( as may be suggested by the excess rv scatter ) could influence the long - term stability of the systems simulated herein .",
    "the evolution of the star on the red giant branch is also likely to affect the orbital evolution ( especially for the inner planet ; see ) , but it is not important over the @xmath618-year timescales of these simulations . simulating the effect of poorly characterized or hypothetical orbits , or the interactions between expanding stars and their planets , is beyond the scope of the current paper , and instead we simply remind the reader of these complications .",
    "we present planetary properties derived with and without constraints from our simulations ( table  [ tab : planetary ] ) so that the cautious reader may choose to adopt the more conservative ( and poorly determined ) parameters of the outer orbit in any subsequent analysis .",

    "* ) , so one might expect the typical planet orbiting a giant star to be _ more _ eccentric , not less .",
    "however , the most eccentric planets around evolved stars would have pericenter distances near , or inside the critical separation at which planets get destroyed .",
    "this could lead either to destruction by the same mechanisms as the close - in planets , or to partial orbital decay and circularization .",
    "the consequence of either process would be more circular orbits on average and an overabundance of planets at separations near the critical separation ( @xmath695 ) , which is indeed observed . for similar arguments and additional discussion ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "counterarguments articulated by those authors include that massive subgiants do not seem to host many planets inside @xmath10au either , but subgiants are not large enough to have swallowed them yet .",
    "this might point toward a primordial difference in the planetary period distribution between sun - like and more massive stars , rather than a difference that evolves over time .      assuming that giant planets form beyond the ice line ( located at @xmath696au for a star with @xmath697 , using the approximation of * ? ? ?",

    ", their large orbital eccentricities would suggest that they have experienced gravitational interactions , perhaps during one or more planet  planet scattering events that brought them to their current orbital distances , or through the influence of an outer companion ( like that detected in our ao images ) .",
    "however , the apparent alignment between the stellar spin axis and the orbit of the inner planet presents a puzzle ; if the ( initially circular , coplanar ) planets migrated via multi - body interactions , we would expect both the eccentricities _ and _ the inclinations to grow .",
    "it is possible , of course , that by chance the inner planet remained relatively well - aligned after scattering , or that the planets experienced coplanar , high - eccentricity migration , which has recently been suggested as a mechanism for producing hot jupiters @xcite .",
    "measuring the mutual inclination between the planets could lend credence to one of these scenarios . unfortunately , because we are unable to constrain the mutual inclination of the planets , we can not say whether they are mutually well - aligned ( which would argue against planet - planet scattering ) or not .",

    "a system with edge - on rotation has @xmath698 , and @xmath699  indicates perfect alignment between stellar spin and planetary orbital angular momentum .",
    "the long tail of high obliquities illustrates that even with a nearly edge - on stellar spin , a transiting planet may still be misaligned .",
    "[ fig : obliquity],scaledwidth=48.0% ]    at this point , it is prudent to reiterate that the stellar spin and orbital angular momenta are measured to be nearly aligned only as projected along the line of sight .",
    "the true obliquity is unknown , and may be significantly non - zero . in figure",
    "[ fig : obliquity ] , we illustrate this by simulating the underlying obliquity distribution that corresponds to an example @xmath421  distribution with a mean of @xmath700 , similar to that measured from asteroseismology .",
    "to generate this obliquity distribution , we draw from @xmath421 and a random uniform azimuthal angle , @xmath701 , and calculate the true obliquity , @xmath702 .",
    "as is apparent from the @xmath702  distribution , while it is likely that the true obliquity is low , there is a tail of highly misaligned systems ( representing those with spin axes lying nearly in the plane of the sky but not coincident with the orbital angular momentum ) that could produce the stellar inclination we observe .",
    "ideally , we would also measure the sky - projected spin  orbit angle , @xmath703 , in order to detect any such conspiring misalignment and calculate the true obliquity . however , there is not an obvious way to do this : the slow rotation , long period , and lack of star spots render current techniques to measure the sky - projected obliquity ineffective .",
    "we are left with an inner planet that is _ likely _ , but not certainly , aligned with the stellar spin axis , and an unknown inclination of the outer orbital plane .",
    "the likely alignment of the inner planet seems at odds with the large orbital eccentricities and the assumption that multi - body interactions are responsible for their migration , but we have thus far neglected interaction between the planets and the host star . in their investigation of hot jupiter obliquities , @xcite suggested that well - aligned hot jupiters may have been misaligned previously , and that subsequent tidal interaction may have realigned the stellar rotation with the planetary orbit , perhaps influencing the convective envelope independently of the interior .",
    "this idea was furthered by @xcite , who found that systems with short tidal - dissipation timescales are likely to be aligned , while those with long timescales are found with a wide range of obliquities . in the following section",

    "kepler_-432 , the current position of the planets would be too far from the star to raise any significant tides , but the star is now several times its original size , such that at periastron , the inner planet passes within @xmath704  stellar radii of the star .",
    "the unusually large planetary mass also helps strengthen tidal interactions . following @xcite ( who in turn used the formulae of * ? ? ?",

    "star interactions rather than star  planet interactions , and are timescales for spin  orbit synchronization , not realignment . as such ,",
    "the timescales are assumed to be valid only as a relative metric .",

    "their result still holds true ; systems with short tidal dissipation timescales are well aligned , while those with long tidal timescales display a wide range of obliquities .",
    "we also note that recent work by @xcite , which includes a more detailed treatment of the convection and stellar evolution of each star , similarly concludes that the observed obliquity distribution can be explained by tidal evolution . while the angle measured for _",
    "kepler_-432b is the line of sight projection rather than the sky - plane projection , and the efficiency of realignment may be different for evolved stars given their different internal structure , _",
    "kepler_-432b does have a short tidal timescale , and it sits in a region with hot jupiter systems that are mostly well - aligned .",
    "we interpret this result as evidence that the spin axis of _",
    "kepler_-432  has been realigned to the orbit of the inner planet by the same mechanism responsible for hot jupiter realignment .",
    "alternative mechanisms have been proposed to explain the alignment for hot jupiters orbiting cool stars .",
    "one such alternative , suggested by @xcite , is that the orbital alignment trend with stellar temperature is due to strong versus weak magnetic breaking ( for stars below and above the kraft break ) , rather than tidal dissipation efficiency as in @xcite .",
    "this has the attractive quality of being part of a theory that is also able to predict the observed mass cut - off for retrograde planets and the trend between planet mass and host star rotation periods . in the @xcite framework , one may still conclude that _",
    "kepler_-432  would realign during its red giant phase , but this depends in part on the unknown magnetic properties of the star : the @xcite finding of strong magnetic fields in some giants may indeed indicate that _",
    "kepler_-432  possesses a short enough magnetic braking timescale to allow for realignment in this framework , too .",
    "more recent spin  orbit measurements from the literature ( red triangles ) and _ kepler_-432b ( large blue circle ) .",
    "because it sits in a region with well - aligned hot jupiters , we posit that _ kepler_-432b has also realigned the spin of its host star .",
    "[ fig : tidal],scaledwidth=48.0% ]    in the event that the envelope and the core have different spin axis inclinations , this might manifest itself in the asteroseismic modes . because @xmath442-mode - dominated @xmath439  modes are most sensitive to core rotation while @xmath441-mode - dominated mixed modes are most sensitive to the surface , one might obtain different inclination measurements from the different modes . however , our analysis of individual @xmath439  modes in showed they were consistent with @xmath709  inclination for both core and envelope .",
    "this would argue _ against _ a realigned envelope for _ kepler_-432 , but a modest misalignment might be undetectable given the degraded precision when fitting modes independently .",
    "furthermore , as shown for the obliquity and spin axis in figure  [ fig : obliquity ] , even if the two spin axes both lie in the sky plane , there is a chance they could be significantly misaligned .",
    "regardless of its efficacy in the case of _",
    "kepler_-432 , asteroseismology may be able to detect a significant misalignment between core and envelope in other systems hosting giant planets with short tidal timescales .",
    "if detected , this would be important evidence in the interpretation of giant planet migration , and we suggest this be explored for other systems .    ,",
    "scaledwidth=48.0% ]    while the evidence presented thus far for realignment of the _",
    "kepler_-432  system is circumstantial , there may be additional evidence to support the scenario .",
    "if tidal forces are strong enough to realign the spin axis of the host star , they may also excite activity on the stellar surface .",
    "spi need not be limited to tidal interaction , though . at closest approach",
    ", the planet is only @xmath704  stellar radii from the star , and thus magnetic interaction may also be possible , since the planet passes inside the alfvn radius ( @xmath710 ) .",
    "we return to the light curve to look for signs of these interactions .",
    "when folded on the orbital period , an interesting feature emerges ( see figure  [ fig : fold_spot ] ) .",
    "just after transit , we detect a brightening of @xmath711mmag that maintains a coherent shape and phase throughout the mission .",
    "the simplest explanation for a light curve feature with the period of the planet is a phenomenon associated with the planet .",
    "we suggest that spi excites a bright spot on the stellar photosphere each orbit during periastron passage .",
    "periastron occurs @xmath712  days before transit , and because the rotation period is longer than the orbital period , the spot should rotate onto the meridian and reach maximum apparent brightness slightly after transit , as is observed .",
    "one might argue that if the planet has realigned the stellar spin , it may have also synchronized it to the orbital period  this would cause _ any _ long - lived bright spot to create a peak in the light curve when folded to the orbital period .",
    "however , to obtain the observed phasing , the spot would have to conveniently occur at the longitude that coincides with the close approach of the planet .",
    "there is also no reason to expect a long - lived bright spot on the star , irrespective of its phasing .",
    "furthermore , there exists evidence that the spin is _ not _ synchronized to the orbital period anyway .",
    "we have measured @xmath635 , @xmath421 , and @xmath412 , so we can estimate the rotation period to be @xmath713  days , which is inconsistent with the orbital period ( @xmath714  days ) .",
    "thus , a long - lived rotating star spot should not produce a coherent photometric signal when folded to the orbital period .",
    "( similarly , we must conclude that if @xmath715 , any planet - induced spot must decay in brightness relatively quickly , or the brightening feature would appear at different phases in each orbit , washing out the coherent signal that we observe . )",
    "we do caution that our @xmath412 measurement for this slowly rotating giant could be biased , for example , due to the unknown macroturbulent velocity of _ kepler_-432 .",
    "however , even if our measurement of the rotational velocity is incorrect and the rotation period _ is _ synchronized to the orbit , we believe a bright star spot phased with the periastron passage of the planet would more easily be attributed to spi than coincidence .    one additional worry would be that granulation could produce correlated noise that happens to fold coherently on the orbital period .",
    "we find this to be an unlikely scenario given the periodogram of the _ kepler _ data ( see figure  [ fig : periodogram ] ) .",
    "if granulation produced light curve amplitudes similar to that observed , we would expect several periods to show similar power simply by chance .",
    "instead , we observe the peak power at the second harmonic of the orbital period ( @xmath716  days ) , and very little power at other periods .",
    "it is not particularly surprising that the second harmonic , rather than the first , is the strongest peak , especially given that there is some additional structure in the light curve at phases other than around transit .",
    "the observant reader might notice a possible brightening of lower amplitude at phase @xmath717  of the folded light curve .",
    "we are not confident that this is real , but if it is , it holds a wealth of information . as mentioned above",
    ", any excited spot must decay in brightness quickly , or much of the star would soon be covered in such spots , obfuscating the coherent signal that we observe . if , however , a spot excited during periastron lasted only slightly more than one rotation period , we would expect to see a second peak in the folded light curve , with an amplitude dependent on the spot lifetime and phase dependent on the rotation period . for _",
    "kepler_-432 , the second peak @xmath718  orbits after the first would imply a rotation period of @xmath719  days , perfectly consistent with our independently estimated rotation period .",
    "the amplitude of the second peak is roughly half that of the first , so we could conclude that the characteristic lifetime ( half - life ) of such a spot is roughly the same as the rotation period , @xmath720  days .",
    "we reiterate that we are not confident that the data here is strong enough to make such conclusions ; we merely note the consistent rotation period it would imply .",

    "the inner planet ( @xmath722  days ) transits the star , allowing a more detailed study of its properties .",
    "an asteroseismic analysis of the host star allows precise measurements of the stellar mass , radius , age , and spin axis inclination . this in turn leads to precise planetary properties , especially for the transiting inner planet .",

    "kepler_-432b is among the most massive transiting planets orbiting any type of star .",
    "furthermore , it is not highly irradiated like many of the more common short - period transiting planets , experiencing only @xmath723 of the insolation that a @xmath683-day hot jupiter orbiting a sun - like star would receive .",
    "this makes it an interesting benchmark for interior models , and a good test of planetary inflation at moderate insolation .",
    "it appears to be slightly inflated compared to the models , but is marginally consistent with having no core ( or a small core ) of heavy elements .",
    "the eccentricities of both planets are high , which is suggestive of migration through multi - body interactions .",
    "puzzlingly , the transiting planet is likely well aligned with the stellar spin , which is not an expected property of systems that have experienced such interactions .",
    "however , subsequent tidal or magnetic interaction with the host star may reconcile the two results .",
    "we find that because of the large stellar radius and planetary mass , the tidal dissipation timescale of the system is similar to that of hot jupiters that are well - aligned .",
    "those planets are thought to be well - aligned due to reorientation of the angular momenta after the initial inward migration ; we conclude that the same process that realigns hot jupiter systems may have also realigned this system , despite its long period .    under the assumption that the star and planet are interacting strongly enough to realign the stellar spin",
    ", we searched for evidence of this interaction in the _ kepler _ photometry .",
    "the star is photometrically quiet on long timescales , which allowed us to detect a low amplitude brightening soon after periastron .",
    "we conclude that the most likely explanation is a bright spot excited ( either tidally or magnetically ) by the planet during its close approach to the stellar photosphere .",
    "this evidence for ongoing spi further supports the obliquity realignment scenario .",
