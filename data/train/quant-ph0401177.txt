    "in 1946 , felix bloch introduced a set of equations describing the dynamics of a nuclear induction of a spin that interacts with a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the applied magnetic field drives the bloch vector of the magnetic moment , causing it to precess about the field direction .",
    "in addition to the unitary evolution describing the magnetic moment precession , a nonunitary evolution is observed in nuclear magnetic resonance , which results in dissipation of the magnetic observables .",
    "this dissipation is characterized by two phenomenological decay constants .",
    "the two lifetimes @xmath0 and @xmath1 are the longitudinal and transverse decay constants , respectively .",
    "fluctuations in the environment , such as inhomogeneities in the magnetic field and interactions with other moments , lead to dissipation in the system .",
    "the dissipation constants @xmath0 and @xmath1 are nonnegative so that exponential decay of the magnetic moment occurs .",
    "it is well known that this condition is required to preserve the positivity of the density operator under dissipation .",
    "the phenomenological dissipation of the bloch vector defines a positive map ( pm ) of the density operator for the spin system .    about the physical sources of the dissipation constants bloch wrote :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ the actual value of @xmath0 is very difficult to predict for a given substance ... to give a reliable estimate of @xmath1 ... requires a more detailed investigation of the mechanism involved and will not be attempted here . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    in the same paper bloch made the following statement about the relative values of the dissipation constants :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ... serious errors may be committed by assuming @xmath2 .",
    "there are , on the other hand , also cases where this equality is justified ... _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    it took almost 30 years to understand that the dissipation results from a reduction of a unitary evolution of a system coupled to a quantum reservoir . in the process of such a reduction , the transformation of the density operator of the system has to be a completely positive map ( cpm ) .",
    "however , if the hypothesis of complete positivity is to be imposed then the values of the dissipation constants can not be arbitrary .",
    "in particular , the inequality @xmath3 must hold and has been experimentally observed @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to reexamine the well - known bloch equations in the context of completely positive maps .",
    "we show that the condition of complete positivity for markovian bloch maps imposes some bloch inequalities on the phenomenological damping constants . for non - markovian bloch maps ,",
    "generalized bloch inequalities involving eigenvalues of the damping basis can be established as well .",
    "the depolarizing channel with white noise is used to illustrate these general properties .",
    "the non - markovian bloch map is studied in the framework of a depolarizing channel with colored noise .",
    "although originally introduced in the context of nuclear magnetic resonance , the bloch equations are well - known in quantum optics , where they describe a two - level atom interacting with an electromagnetic field @xcite .",
    "the bloch equations offer a physical picture of the density operator .",
    "the dynamics of any two - level quantum system can be expressed in terms of a three - dimensional vector @xmath4 , called the bloch vector .",
    "for such systems , the set of all density operators can be geometrically represented by a sphere with unit radius .",
    "states that are on the surface of this bloch sphere are pure states or rank one density operators @xmath5 .",
    "states that are within the bloch ball are mixed states , which are written as convex combinations of pure states .",
    "the optical bloch equations are a set of differential equations , one for each component of the bloch vector , having the form @xmath6 the unitary part of the evolution is governed by @xmath7 , the rabi frequency of the applied field .",
    "the field is detuned from the natural resonance of the atom by an amount @xmath8 .",
    "note that these equations differ from the original bloch equations by the fact that there are two different transverse dampings .",
    "these two constants @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the decay rates of the in phase and out of phase quadratures of the atomic dipole moment , while @xmath11 is the decay rate of the atomic inversion into an equilibrium state @xmath12 .",

    "the decay constants arise due to an interaction with the reservoir given by the variables @xmath18 .",
    "this could , for example , be a collection of harmonic oscillators , in which case @xmath19 in contrast to a quantum reservoir , @xmath18 could describe a classically fluctuating environment .    typically , the phenomenological decay rates in the bloch equations appear as @xmath20 the damping of the component that is in phase with the driving field is equal to the damping of the component that is out of phase with the driving field .",
    "the damping is caused by the interaction of the system with an external environment that is averaged over .",
    "this environment could be the vacuum field , which leads to spontaneous emission .",
    "other phenomena , which result in eq .",
    "( [ eq : decayrate ] ) , are coupling to a thermal field or phase randomization due to atomic collisions .",
    "the source of noise and dissipation in the system is due to the fluctuation of the environment .",
    "the phenomenological decay rates are not limited to eq .",
    "( [ eq : decayrate ] ) .",
    "reservoirs that result in different dynamics can be engineered .",
    "for example , a two - level atom interacting with a squeezed vacuum reservoir will experience unequal damping for the in phase and out of phase quadratures of the atomic dipole .",
    "the corresponding damping rates become @xmath21 the presence of the parameter @xmath22 is the source of the damping asymmetry between the @xmath23 and @xmath24 components of the bloch vector .",
    "it arises because the vacuum is squeezed , meaning that it has fluctuations in one quadrature smaller than allowed by the uncertainty principle at the expense of larger fluctuations in the other quadrature .",
    "equation ( [ eq : svdamping ] ) reflects this  the decay rate for one component of the bloch vector is increased , while the decay rate for the orthogonal component is correspondingly decreased .",
    "the physical parameters leading to this dynamics are @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the einstein coefficient for spontaneous emission , @xmath27 is the mean photon number of the squeezed vacuum reservoir , and @xmath28 is the amount of squeezing of the reservoir .",
    "the parameter @xmath27 is related to the two - time correlation function for the noise operators of the reservoir @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the field amplitude for a reservoir mode .",
    "the squeezing complex parameter @xmath28 arises from the two - time correlation function involving the square of the field amplitudes @xmath31 .",
    "the damping asymmetry parameter @xmath32 is in this case due entirely to squeezing .",
    "these are the relations obeyed by squeezed white noise , which lead to squeezing of a vacuum reservoir  @xcite .",
    "the solution to the bloch equations determines the state of the system for all time .",
    "the bloch vector evolves in time according to a linear map .",
    "this linear map may be written in the form @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a damping matrix and @xmath35 is a translation .",
    "the overall operation consists of contractions and translations . due to the presence of translations ,",
    "the transformation is affine .",
    "the damping matrix is a @xmath36 matrix that takes the diagonal form @xmath37 we will show in section v , that these eigenvalues can be calculated using the damping basis for an appropriate master equation describing the unitary and the dissipative dynamics of the spin system .    due to the correspondence between the bloch vector @xmath38 and the density operator @xmath39 , the linear map is a superoperator that maps density operators into density operators according to @xmath40 the density operator can be expanded in the pauli basis @xmath41 and the components of @xmath39 transform under the map .",
    "this transformation is characterized by a @xmath42 matrix representation of @xmath43 .",
    "it has been found that the general form of any stochastic map on the set of complex @xmath44 matrices may be represented by a @xmath42 matrix containing 12 parameters  @xcite .    without loss of generality",
    ", this @xmath42 matrix may be cast into the form @xmath45 which uniquely determines the map .",
    "hermiticity of the density operator is preserved by requiring that @xmath46 be real",
    ". the first row must be @xmath47 to preserve the trace of the density operator .",
    "the matrix representation of the bloch vector as an expansion in terms of the pauli matrices @xmath48 illustrates the properties required by the linear map . in the absence of noise ,",
    "the bloch vector remains on the bloch sphere so that @xmath49 has magnitude unity .",
    "a general map transforms the matrix @xmath50 according to @xmath51 to guarantee that the map @xmath43 transforms the density operator into another density operator , the bloch vector can be transformed only into a vector contained in the interior of the bloch sphere , or the bloch ball .",
    "this requirement implies @xmath52 so that the qubit density operator @xmath53 under the map becomes @xmath54 this is only possible if the @xmath55 in the damping matrix contain contractions .",
    "this is achieved in general for @xmath56 .",
    "if @xmath57 then @xmath58 for @xmath59 is necessary for @xmath43 to be a positive map ; _ i.e. _ , it always maps positive operators into positive operators .",
    "the set of all pure states lie on the surface of the bloch sphere @xmath60 .",
    "the map @xmath43 takes this set into a set of states that lie on the surface of an ellipsoid @xmath61 thus , it typically maps pure states into mixed states .",
    "all ellipsoids that are on or inside the bloch sphere represent sets of positive operators",
    ". however , not all ellipsoids on or inside the bloch sphere correspond to completely positive dynamics .",
    "the map @xmath43 should be a completely positive map @xcite .",
    "a completely positive map is defined by @xmath62 where the index @xmath63 is a positive integer in the set of all positive integers @xmath64 .",
    "the definition states that if the dynamics @xmath43 occurs on the system and external systems are attached to the system , which evolve according to the identity superoperator @xmath65 , and if the the overall state is positive then the map @xmath43 is completely positive .",
    "a completely positive map is required to describe reduced dynamics because it implies that the reduced dynamics arises from a unitary evolution @xmath66 on the larger hilbert space consisting of the system and the environment .",
    "the environment degrees of freedom are denoted by @xmath67 and @xmath68 is some initial state of the environment .",
    "starting with a hamiltonian for the closed system plus environment , and then tracing or averaging over the environment degrees of freedom , will always yield completely positive reduced dynamics for the system alone . because of this requirement , there are points inside the bloch sphere that are not accessible .    if the reduced dynamics is consistent with eq .",
    "( [ eq : unitary ] ) then it also has as a kraus decomposition .",
    "this implies the existence of a set of operators @xmath69 , called kraus operators , such that the map can be expressed as @xmath70 where the condition @xmath71 ensures that unit trace is preserved for all time  @xcite .",
    "if an operation has a kraus decomposition , then it is completely positive .",
    "the converse is also true .    to check whether a map @xmath43 that takes @xmath72 matrices into @xmath72 matrices is completely positive , it is necessary and sufficient to check the positivity on a maximally entangled @xmath73 state @xcite",
    "this is a powerful theorem that provides a test on a finite space , rather than relying on the less practical definition , which requires attaching systems in a countably infinite space .",
    "in addition , it makes no reference to kraus operators , but rather , guarantees their existence .",
    "a general completely positive , trace - preserving map for two - level systems can always be written using four or fewer kraus operators . an important class of maps called unital maps ( no translations ) has the following set of kraus operators : @xmath74 in order that the class of unital maps be completely positive , it must be that the expressions under the radical are nonnegative .",
    "the damping eigenvalues must obey the four inequalities @xmath75 to guarantee complete positivity of the map .",
    "this is a necessary condition .",
    "this condition is more restrictive if compared with the condition : @xmath56 required by a positive map leading to contraction of the bloch vector . in figure 1 we have depicted the completely positive maps as points inside of a tetrahedron , forming a subset of all positive maps contained in a cube .",
    "we shall call the relations ( [ eq : inequalities ] ) bloch inequalities .",
    "the bloch inequalities ( [ eq : inequalities ] ) lead to certain restrictions on the damping constants in the bloch equations . for purely exponential character of the @xmath76 ,",
    "these conditions lead to a simpler relation involving only lifetimes . in this case",
    "each component of the bloch vector can only decay according to @xcite : @xmath77 the condition of complete positivity leads to a set of bloch inequalities for the phenomenological lifetimes that must be satisfied .",
    "this explains the well - known phenomenon in nuclear magnetic resonance whereby the inverse transverse relaxation time is always less than or equal to twice the inverse longitudinal relaxation time .",
    "it is instructive to see how the violation of the bloch inequalities ( [ eq : blochineq ] ) is reflected in the general conditions ( [ eq : inequalities ] ) . in order to show this ,",
    "we have depicted in fig .",
    "2 the four conditions ( [ eq : inequalities ] ) as a function of time for two different selections of the damping parameters .",
    "a function exceeding the straight line at the value one is not a cpm , because it violates the bloch inequalities .",
    "note that the case describe on the left figure is a pm that is not a cpm for all times , while the case on the right figure describes a cpm for all times .",
    "0.5 cm    application of the bloch inequalities to the case of squeezed noise given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : squeezing ] ) leads to the condition @xmath78 @xcite .    as a different example of a bloch cmp generated by a noise ,",

    "<S> the phenomenological dissipation of the bloch equations is reexamined in the context of completely positive maps . </S>",
    "<S> such maps occur if the dissipation arises from a reduction of a unitary evolution of a system coupled to a reservoir . </S>",
    "<S> in such a case the reduced dynamics for the system alone will always yield completely positive maps of the density operator . we show that , for markovian bloch maps , the requirement of complete positivity imposes some bloch inequalities on the phenomenological damping constants . for non - markovian bloch maps some kind of bloch inequalities involving eigenvalues of the damping basis can be established as well . as an illustration of these general properties we use the depolarizing channel with white and colored stochastic noise . </S>"
