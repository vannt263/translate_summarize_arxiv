    "globular clusters ( gcs ) are thought to be formed in bursts of star formation within molecular protocluster clouds , producing gravitationally bound clusters of 10@xmath210@xmath3 stars which represent the best known approximations of a `` simple stellar population '' ( hereafter ssp ) , i.e. , a coeval population of stars with a single metallicity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "extensive photometric observations of extragalactic gc systems have now yielded a substantial database of gc colors and magnitudes to investigate overall trends among subpopulations of gcs and between properties of gc subpopulations and those of their host galaxies .",
    "the advent of the _ advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) _ aboard the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ was pivotal in this area due to its unique high sensitivity and spatial resolution over a field of view of @xmath412 arcmin@xmath5 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "one main result of these studies was that gcs in luminous galaxies typically follow a bimodal color distribution .",
    "multi - object spectroscopy studies showed that both `` blue '' and `` red '' gc subpopulations are nearly universally old , with ages @xmath68 gyr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this implies that the color bimodality is mainly due to differences in metallicity ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "typical metallicity values for metal - poor ( blue ) gcs in giant elliptical galaxies are [ z / h ] = @xmath7 , while metal - rich ( red ) gcs average [ z / h ] = @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "a more recently discovered feature among gc systems was a color - magnitude relation among gcs in the metal - poor subpopulation , in the sense that their colors become progressively redder at higher luminosities @xcite .",
    "this relation , colloquially called the `` blue tilt '' , is typically interpreted as a mass - metallicity relation ( hereafter mmr ) , although the various analyses of the effect in individual galaxies have not yet converged to an agreement on the significance of the tilt and the mass range in which the correlation is significant ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite versus @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "recently , @xcite performed a detailed investigation of the color - magnitude relation in the largest sample of gcs to date by far ( @xmath916,900 gcs , see section  [ s : sample ] ) , using @xmath10 and @xmath11 filters .",
    "three main conclusions of @xcite regarding the blue tilt were that _",
    "( i ) _ the blue tilt is firmly present for gc masses @xmath12 while it becomes more pronounced at @xmath13 ; _ ( ii ) _ the tilt is more pronounced for gcs associated with high - mass galaxies ( @xmath14 ) than for gcs in lower - mass galaxies ; and _ ( iii ) _ the tilt is more pronounced for gcs at smaller galactocentric distances .",
    "notably , @xcite also found evidence for the presence of a `` red tilt '' , i.e. , a color - magnitude relation among gcs in the metal - rich subpopulation .",
    "this red tilt is seen among gcs in the full magnitude range sampled by @xcite , albeit only within their `` high - mass '' subset of galaxies .",
    "the vast majority of studies of the mmr among gcs explain it as being due to gc self - enrichment by ejecta of supernovae of type ii ( snii ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , several features of the blue tilt mentioned above seem to indicate that gc self - enrichment alone can not fully explain the observed mmr .",
    "for example , most theoretical work on gc self - enrichment in heavy ( fe - peak ) elements indicates that it is only effective at masses @xmath15 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) whereas the blue tilt in elliptical galaxies persists down to gc masses that are an order of magnitude loweral ) are commonly found within galactic gcs , and there are indications that the amplitude of such variations scale with gc mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , such variations only cause a small blueing of integrated @xmath16  colors ( @xmath17 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which can not cause the blue or red tilts . ] .",
    "furthermore , one would not expect to see significant environmental dependences of the slope of the mmr ( such as the tilt being more pronounced for higher - mass galaxies or for smaller galactocentric distances ) if gc self - enrichment were the only relevant cause .",
    "instead , the presence of such environmental variations seem to indicate an effect ( or effects ) whose strength is driven by the local tidal field , such as star cluster disruption .",
    "recent investigations of the distribution of fe - peak element abundances within galactic gcs are starting to yield clues in this regard .",
    "statistically significant internal variations in [ fe / h ] have so far been detected within a few ( metal - poor ) gcs : @xmath18cen ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , m54 @xcite , and m22 @xcite .",
    "these gcs have current masses of @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 respectively @xcite .",
    "note that the mass of m22 is comparable to the onset of the blue tilt found by @xcite , lending credence to the potential relevance of gc mass loss in this context .",
    "meanwhile , recent studies of the central regions of nearby massive elliptical galaxies revealed very strong gravity - sensitive features in their near - ir spectra @xcite , indicating a stellar initial mass function ( imf ) that was steeper at subsolar masses ( @xmath22 in @xmath1 ) than the canonical @xcite or @xcite imfs , which have @xmath23 in the same mass range .",
    "this was subsequently found to be consistent with studies of stellar @xmath24  ratios of massive early - type galaxies derived from gravitational lensing ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and stellar dynamics @xcite .",
    "in the same vein , @xcite reported a systematic offset between optical colors of giant elliptical galaxies and the mean colors of their massive metal - rich gcs , in the sense that those gcs were bluer than their parent galaxies by 0.120.20 mag at a given galactocentric distance ( a 722 @xmath25 effect ) .",
    "however , measurements of lick - system spectral indices that are sensitive to age and metallicity ( but not to imf variations ) for such galaxies and their metal - rich gcs _ were _ found to be consistent with one another at a given galactocentric distance , within small uncertainties .",
    "* hereafter paper i ) showed that this paradox can be explained if the stellar imf was steep at subsolar masses : @xmath2612 gyr of dynamical evolution would then cause the average massive gc to become bluer by an amount consistent with the observed color difference between the metal - rich gcs and their parent galaxies .",
    "to investigate these recent indications of the relevance of the imf shape and dynamical evolution with regards to the colors of gcs and features of the observed mmr among gcs in nearby galaxies , we conduct a study of the effects of mass loss of gcs born with different imf shapes to the mmr among gcs in giant elliptical galaxies and compare those effects to the observed mmr and the effect of self - enrichment .",
    "in comparing results of our calculations with observed features of the gc mmr in giant elliptical galaxies , we adopt the parametrizations of the observed color - magnitude relation and the mmr among metal - poor and metal - rich gcs by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their table 1 ) .",
    "this choice was made because their mmr study gathered the largest photometric sample of gcs to date by far ( @xmath916,900 gcs ) , namely by combining all gcs detected in the acs fornax and virgo surveys of early - type galaxies .",
    "these _ hst _ surveys were carried out using a homogeneous measurement technique in which photometric aperture - size corrections were determined from convolutions of the best - fit gc profiles with local point - spread functions on the image ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "briefly , gc masses and metallicities in @xcite were derived from hst / acs photometry in the f475w ( hereafter @xmath10 ) and f850lp ( @xmath11 ) filters , corrected for galactic foreground extinction .",
    "metallicities ( in terms of [ fe / h ] on the @xcite scale ) were derived using the broken linear transformation of @xcite , while gc masses were derived from @xmath11-band absolute magnitudes , using @xmath27 , which is correct to within 5% in the range @xmath28 } \\la + 0.2 $ ] for an ssp @xcite .",
    "we refer to @xcite for further details regarding the determination of color - magnitude relations and mmrs among their various subsamples of gcs .",
    "it is well known that mass loss of star clusters by dynamical evolution affects the shape of their stellar mf , because the escape probability of stars from their parent cluster increases with decreasing stellar mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this effect is widely used to explain observed stellar mfs in ancient galactic gcs , some of which are flatter than canonical imfs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such flat mfs in gcs can explain their low observed mass - to - light ratios when compared with predictions of ssp models that use canonical imfs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .        to evaluate the influence of the shape of the imf on the present - day color - magnitude relation among gcs",
    ", we follow paper i and use the gc evolution model of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter k09 ) which incorporates the effects of stellar evolution , dynamical evolution in a tidal field , mass segregation , and stellar remnant retention . for the purposes of the current study , we select k09 models that _ ( i ) _ feature `` default '' kick velocities of stellar remnants ( white dwarfs , neutron stars , and black holes ) , and _",
    "( ii ) _ produce gcs with masses @xmath29 at an age of 12 gyr , i.e. , gcs such as those selected by @xcite to derive their mmrs .",
    "we further consider @xcite profiles with @xmath30 values of 5 and 7 and environmentally dependent cluster dissolution time scales @xmath31 of 0.3 , 0.6 , 1.0 , and 3.0 myr is defined by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the cluster disruption time and @xmath34 sets the mass dependence of cluster disruption .",
    "see @xcite and k09 for details . ] . for reference ,",
    "@xmath35 myr yields a good fit to the globular cluster mass function of all surviving galactic gcs @xcite .",
    "however , rather than using a single @xmath31 value for a given galaxy , we consider that gc systems in galaxies are expected to exhibit a _ range _ of @xmath31 values .",
    "for instance , the rate of mass loss from gcs by two - body relaxation , @xmath36 , effectively scales with the mean gc half - mass density @xmath37 as @xmath38 for tidally limited gcs ( e.g. , @xcite ) . among gcs",
    "for which two - body relaxation has been the dominant mass loss mechanism , low-@xmath37 gcs thus feature larger @xmath31 values than high-@xmath37 gcs at a given @xmath39 .",
    "similarly , gcs on eccentric orbits with large perigalactic distances @xmath40 should have larger @xmath31 values than otherwise ( initially ) similar gcs with smaller values of @xmath41 . finally , disruption rates of gcs in dense environments such as central regions of gas - rich galaxy mergers at high redshift were likely higher than in current quiescent galaxies @xcite due to the enhanced strength and rate of tidal perturbations .    in paper",
    "i , we explored the influence of the imf on the present - day mf at subsolar masses for the star cluster families mentioned above . for an ensemble of such gcs",
    ", our calculations showed that the overall average _ present - day _ mf slope in the stellar mass range 0.30.8 @xmath42 ( hereafter designated @xmath43 ) is consistent with the kroupa mf for any imf slope @xmath44 ( see figure 7 of paper i ) .",
    "however , the _ mass dependence _ of @xmath43 ( averaged over all k09 models that produce gcs of a given mass ) , is found to be significantly stronger for steeper imfs .",
    "this is illustrated in figures  [ f : mf_and_m_lz_vs_logm]a[f : mf_and_m_lz_vs_logm]c , which show @xmath43 versus @xmath39 for all k09 models that produce gcs with @xmath45 at an age of 12 gyr , as well as the average model , for three imfs : _",
    "( i ) _ a `` bottom - heavy '' imf with @xmath46 for @xmath47 and @xmath48 for @xmath49 ( this imf is hereafter simply referred to as @xmath46 ) , _ ( ii ) _ the @xcite imf ( i.e. , @xmath48 over the full stellar mass range ) , and _",
    "( iii ) _ the @xcite imf .",
    "as described in detail in paper i , the stronger cluster mass dependence of @xmath43 among ancient gcs born with a steeper imf is mainly caused by the weaker effect of retained massive stellar remnants on the escape rate of massive stars in gcs with steeper imfs relative to that in gcs with flatter imfs .",
    "the effect of 12 gyr of dynamical evolution on the @xmath50 ratio as a function of @xmath39 is similar to that on @xmath43 .",
    "this is shown in figures  [ f : mf_and_m_lz_vs_logm]d[f : mf_and_m_lz_vs_logm]f .",
    "as expected , steeper imfs feature higher @xmath50 ratios for the most massive gcs .",
    "however , steeper imfs also feature a stronger cluster mass dependence of @xmath50 , and a larger spread of @xmath50 ratios among different gc families at a given current mass .",
    "this result renders it difficult to constrain the imf slope for individual ancient gcs through direct measurements of @xmath51 or @xmath52 , especially for gcs with @xmath53 .",
    "however , the large spread of observed mf slopes and @xmath52 ratios among galactic gcs @xcite generally appears more consistent with a bottom - heavy imf than with a kroupa or chabrier one . in the remainder of this paper , the cluster mass  @xmath50 relations shown by the thick solid lines in figs .",
    "[ f : mf_and_m_lz_vs_logm]d[f : mf_and_m_lz_vs_logm]f will be taken into account when comparing model predictions to the observed mmr from @xcite , since the latter study used @xmath54 independent of cluster mass .      the impact of @xmath43 on the integrated @xmath16  color of ancient ( 12 gyr old ) gcs is shown in figure  [ f : color_vs_alpha ] for [ z / h ] = @xmath561.3 and [ z / h ] = @xmath560.2 , i.e. , the two typical metallicity values for the metal - poor and metal - rich gc subpopulations in giant elliptical galaxies , respectively .",
    "these curves were determined from padova isochrones @xcite .",
    "after rebinning the isochrone tables to a uniform bin size in stellar mass @xmath57 using linear interpolation , weighted luminosities of the population were derived for the relevant passbands by normalizing individual stellar luminosities @xmath58 as follows : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the maximum stellar mass reached in the isochrone table , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 is the mf slope in the mass range @xmath63 .",
    "note that the effect of the imf shape on the @xmath16  color is larger for metal - poor populations than for metal - rich ones .",
    "this difference can be understood by considering the shape of the isochrones in color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) at different metallicities .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ f : isocomparison ] which shows @xcite isochrones for [ z / h ] = @xmath561.3 and [ z / h ] = @xmath560.2 ( at an age of 12 gyr ) in a ( @xmath64)/2 vs.  @xmath16  cmd)/2 was chosen as the ordinate for the cmd in order to show the luminosity exactly in between the @xmath10 and @xmath11 passbands . ] .",

    "conversely , the curvature of the rgb in the cmd for metal - poor populations is much weaker , and upper rgb stars are _ bluer _ than lower ms stars for metal - poor populations .",
    "as the overall range of ( @xmath64)/2 magnitudes spanned by the isochrones is similar for metal - poor and metal - rich populations , the impact of the mf slope at subsolar masses on the integrated colors is larger for metal - poor populations than for metal - rich ones .",

    "this is especially true for the case of the metal - poor gcs ( i.e. , the ` blue tilt ' ) .",
    "this is consistent with the findings of @xcite who used the older gc disruption models of @xcite ( which use the kroupa imf ) to evaluate the impact of dynamical evolution to the color - mass relations .",
    "hence , @xcite concluded that dynamical evolution of star clusters can not be responsible for the shape of the blue tilt seen in giant elliptical galaxies .",

    "specifically , the `` average k09 model '' for @xmath46 reproduces the ` red tilt ' observed among metal - rich gcs in giant ellipticals almost perfectly , while the same model reproduces the ` blue tilt ' quite well for gc masses up to log @xmath67 , beyond which the observed blue tilt becomes more pronounced than the k09 model prediction .",
    "as shown in the previous section , dynamical evolution of gcs can explain the shape of the color - mass relation among gcs in giant elliptical galaxies up to log @xmath67 if the imf was steep at subsolar masses ( @xmath68 ) , i.e. , significantly steeper than the kroupa imf for which @xmath69 at those masses .",
    "however , the fact that the blue tilt becomes more pronounced for log @xmath70 does not seem to be compatible with dynamical evolution and requires a different explanation .    in this context , previous studies already tested the potential efficacy of stochastic fluctuations within the stellar cmds , contamination of the gc samples by tidally stripped dwarf galaxy nuclei , accretion of gcs found in present - day low - mass galaxies , and field star capture by gcs @xcite .",
    "none of these effects were found to be likely contributors to the shape of the blue tilt in a significant manner .    on the other hand , one effect known to have the potential to cause",
    "a significant mass - metallicity relation among massive gcs is that of gc self - enrichment by means of retention and reprocessing of snii ejecta ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* hereafter bh09 ) and its expected effect on the mass vs.  @xmath16  relation among gcs by taking into account the effects of gc mass loss by both stellar evolution and dynamical evolution for different imf shapes .    the latter effects can be divided up as follows : _",
    "( i ) _ the effect of gc self - enrichment on the @xmath16  colors of gcs .",
    "this effect becomes increasingly important for gc masses above a certain minimum mass ; _ ( ii ) _ the influence of gc mass loss on the present - day masses ( and hence magnitudes ) at which a given effect of gc self - enrichment is reached ( including the dependence thereof on the adopted imf ) ; and _ ( iii ) _ the influence of dynamical evolution on the @xmath16colors of gcs ( and its dependence on the adopted imf ) .",
    "the latter effect was shown and discussed above in section [ s : gzevol ] .",
    "we refer to bh09 for a full description of their gc self - enrichment model , including its assumptions , caveats and comparisons with other such models .",
    "briefly , the bh09 model is built upon the assumptions that the energy of the snii ejecta is fully converted to kinetic energy , and that self - enrichment occurs when this kinetic energy is equal to or less than the binding energy of the primordial gas cloud that formed the gc .",

    "the presence of a color - mass relation among metal - rich gcs in giant ellipticals down to masses @xmath101 , as seen in the large sample of @xcite , therefore seems to indicate that the metal - rich gcs in giant ellipticals were formed with a bottom - heavy imf ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "this result reinforces the conclusions of paper i as well as those of various recent galaxy studies based on gravity - sensitive spectral features in the red part of the optical spectrum ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) .      as to the calculations of the effects of gc self - enrichment done in section [ s : selfenr ] , the main differences between our results and those of both bh09 itself and @xcite are related to the treatment of gc mass loss .",
    "specifically , bh09 did not take gc mass loss into account when comparing their simulations with observed gc color - magnitude relations in giant elliptical galaxies .",
    "@xcite did implement an aspect of gc mass loss , using the gc dissolution scenario of @xcite to estimate gc mass loss .",
    "however , the latter study only considered gc mass loss due to two - body relaxation and hence did not incorporate the important effect of mass loss due to stellar evolution ( @xmath940% of the initial mass for a kroupa or chabrier imf at an age of 12 gyr : see , e.g. , @xcite or @xcite ; see also fig .",
    "[ f : mcurr_minit ] ) .",
    "the impact of a full treatment of gc mass loss ( and its dimming effect ) on self - enrichment estimates is significant .",
    "one illustration of this is that @xcite noted two main apparent problems with their implementation of the reference model of bh09 in reproducing the blue tilt seen among gcs in giant ellipticals : _",
    "( i ) _ the model predicts self - enrichment to become important only at masses @xmath103 whereas the blue tilt starts at a mass that is an order of magnitude lower , and _",
    "( ii ) _ the mass - metallicity relation predicted by the model is significantly more pronounced in the self - enrichment regime than the observed blue tilt .",
    "consequently , @xcite looked into changes to the assumptions of the radial density profile and star formation efficiency in the reference bh09 model to improve the agreement of the model predictions with the data .",
    "in particular , mieske et al .",
    "needed to make the radial density profile of the protocluster cloud significantly steeper than an isothermal profile to make the self - enrichment model fit the observed mmr , which seems physically unlikely . however , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f : massloss_all ] , the implementation of a full treatment of gc mass loss ( for which the impact to the mass - metallicity relation depends on gc mass as well as the imf ) renders a situation where the reference bh09 model reproduces the blue tilt exhibited by the massive gcs very well .      in this section",
    "we assess to what extent our results shown in fig .",
    "[ f : massloss_all ] might depend on the assumptions and ingredients of the color - metallicity relation and the gc dynamical evolution model used to derive them .          to translate metallicity variations into @xmath16  color changes in section [ s : selfenr ] , we followed @xcite and used the broken linear function of @xcite which was derived from integrated - light @xmath10 and @xmath11-band photometry of 95 gcs in the milky way , m49 , and m87 that have spectroscopic metallicities . however , the scatter in the peng et al .",
    "relation is significant , especially at intermediate metallicities ( @xmath104 } \\la -0.5 $ ] ) and supersolar ones , and uncertainties of several individual data points are substantial . to assess the uncertainty associated with the choice of a particular [ z / h](@xmath16 ) relation , we apply two other such relations from the recent literature for comparison purposes : _",
    "( i ) _ the quartic polynomial function of @xcite , which was derived from the same data as the @xcite function , and _",
    "( ii ) _ the broken linear function of @xcite , which was derived from an independent empirical database of colors and spectroscopic metallicities of 903 extragalactic gcs .",
    "as might be expected , the three [ z / h](@xmath16 ) relations imply different amounts of gc pre - enrichment needed to let the mean color of the modeled blue and red tilts agree with the observed ones .",
    "specifically , the @xcite relation implies [ z@xmath92/h ] = @xmath561.37 and [ z@xmath92/h ] = -0.22 for the blue and red gcs , respectively , while the [ z@xmath92/h ] values are @xmath561.20 and @xmath560.18 when using the @xcite relation .",
    "the sensitivity of our results to the choice of a given different color - metallicity relation is illustrated in figure  [ f : cmcompare1 ] , which consists of three copies of figs .",
    "[ f : massloss_all]c and [ f : massloss_all]f , one for each color - metallicity relation .",
    "while the resulting shapes of the blue and red tilts depend somewhat on the color - metallicity relation in a quantitative sense , they are all consistent with one another to within the 1-@xmath25 uncertainties . moreover , our main results do not change : the addition of the effect of 12 gyr of gc mass loss to that of self - enrichment yields a good fit to the observed blue tilt , while the shape of the observed red tilt indicates a bottom - heavy imf at sub - solar masses for the metal - rich population .      to estimate the variation in the effects of 12 gyr of gc mass loss among different gc dynamical evolution models",
    ", we compare the k09 model with that of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter fz01 ) .",
    "the main difference between these two models is that fz01 employs a constant , gc mass - independent value for the ( present - time ) @xmath52 to compare model masses with observed luminosities , while k09 uses gc mass - dependent mass loss rates that result in gc mass - dependent @xmath52 rates ( see fig .",
    "[ f : mf_and_m_lz_vs_logm ] ) .",
    "the two models also use different parametrizations of gc mass loss by two - body relaxation , and k09 incorporates a prescription of the effect of stellar remnant retention which fz01 did not .",
    "however , in spite of these different model ingredients , the only significant differences between the gc mass functions ( gcmfs ) for the galactic gc system at an age of 12 gyr as inferred by the two models show up at _ low _ gc masses ( @xmath105 , see * ? ? ?",
    "for the massive gcs considered in this paper ( @xmath106 ) , the difference between the gcmfs inferred by the two models are only of order 10% for any given mass bin , which is within the 1@xmath25 poisson error bars ( see figure [ f : mfcompare ] ) . since these differences are smaller than the differences between k09 models with different values of dissolution timescales @xmath31 employed in this paper ( illustrated by the blue error bars in figs .",
    "[ f : massloss_all]a[f : massloss_all]c ) , we believe our results on the amounts of gc mass loss , and their uncertainties , are robust .    , assuming @xmath107 ( open squares and 1-@xmath25 error bars ) .",
    "the solid line represents the gcmf calculated from the gc luminosity function derived by @xcite using a model involving mass - dependent @xmath52 ratios and dissolution timescales @xmath31 determined for each individual gc ( see their fig .",
    "the dashed line represents a fit to the galactic gcmf using a model assuming a mass - independent @xmath52 ratio ( as in * ? ? ?",
    "data are from @xcite .",
    "note the similarity of the two curves in the mass range of gcs considered in this paper .",
    "[ f : mfcompare ] , width=253 ]      as mentioned in the introduction , the color - mass relations among gcs show environmental dependencies @xcite .",
    "firstly , gcs associated with high - mass galaxies exhibit more pronounced blue _ and _ red tilts than do gcs in lower - mass galaxies .",
    "secondly , the blue tilt is found to be more pronounced among gcs at smaller galactocentric distances than among those further out .",
    "one might expect such environmental dependences to exist among ancient gc systems due to dynamical evolution ( i.e. , tidal shocks and two - body relaxation ) , as tidal fields are stronger in more massive galaxies and at smaller galactocentric distances .",
    "a recent illustration of this effect was shown by @xcite who performed n - body simulations of gcs in a realistic milky way - like potential and found a strong trend of increasing mass loss with decreasing galactocentric distance for a given type of gc ( initial mass , half - mass radius , concentration ; see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    to simulate the effect of environmentally varying gc dissolution timescales on the color - mass relations among gcs for a given imf ,",
    "we select gcs whose cumulative mass loss over 12 gyr of stellar and dynamical evolution are at the 20% and 80% percentiles of the range found among the gc families considered in this paper ( see figure  [ f : mcurr_minit]c ) , and compare the resulting color - mass relations with that derived for the `` average '' k09 model . this comparison is depicted in figure  [ f : cmcompare2 ] for the case of the kroupa imf and the @xcite color - metallicity relation .",
    "it is obvious that the shape of the blue tilt is indeed sensitive to the amount of cumulative gc mass loss ( and its impact on self - enrichment in the observed color - mass frame ) : the blue tilt only shows up for @xmath108 for the `` low '' mass loss case while it is present and pronounced all the way down to the minimum mass of the gc sample for the `` high '' mass loss case .",
    "note that this behavior is entirely consistent with the observed environmental dependencies of the blue tilt found by @xcite .",
    "note also that in contrast with the blue tilt , the dependence of the shape of the _ red _ tilt on the cumulative amount of gc mass loss is negligible in terms of the impact of gc mass loss on self - enrichment in the observed color - mass frame .",
    "this suggests that the presence of the red tilt in massive ellipticals and its absence in low - mass ellipticals is _ not _ mainly due to differences in cumulative gc mass loss .",
    "instead , we suggest that it indicates that metal - rich gcs in massive ellipticals were formed with a bottom - heavy imf , as already mentioned in section  [ s : combined ] .          several studies of the blue tilt in giant elliptical galaxies have pointed out that the color - magnitude relations among metal - poor gcs can vary significantly from galaxy to galaxy , even among massive galaxies with similar luminosities . a well - known case in point",
    "is m49 , the brightest giant elliptical galaxy in the virgo cluster , which does not show an obvious blue tilt whereas ngc 1399 and m87 , two other giant elliptical galaxies with similar luminosities , do @xcite . while such differences might seem difficult to reconcile within a scenario in which the mass - metallicity relation among massive gcs is primarily due to self - enrichment",
    ", one should consider the following .",
    "first and foremost , we emphasize that the main purpose of this study has been to compare calculations of the impact of gc mass loss and self - enrichment to the _ average _ color - mass relations among gcs in a large sample of giant elliptical galaxies .",
    "several factors render averaging over many galaxies a necessity in this context .",
    "as shown and discussed above , @xmath2612 gyr of dynamical evolution can cause several differences between different families of gcs ( especially for the case of bottom - heavy imfs ) .",
    "one example of such differences is the relative amount of mass lost ( see section  [ s : t_0 ] and figs .",
    "[ f : mcurr_minit ] and [ f : cmcompare2 ] ) .",
    "this results in a spread of current luminosities among gcs that started out with a given initial mass , and hence with a similar amount of self - enrichment .",
    "another property that is quite sensitive to the initial gc conditions is the change of the slope of stellar mass function at subsolar masses and its associated change of integrated @xmath16  color after 12 gyr ( see figs .",
    "[ f : mf_and_m_lz_vs_logm]a  c and [ f : color_vs_alpha ] as well as paper i ) .",
    "the 1-@xmath25 uncertainties associated with these two effects in the color - mass plane are indicated in figs .",
    "[ f : massloss_all]d  f .",
    "last but not least , there is a significant scatter among colors of metal - poor gcs in individual giant ellipticals ( @xmath109 } \\simeq 0.3 $ ] ; e.g. , @xcite ) , which translates to @xmath110 .",
    "this is most likely mainly due to a spread in pre - enrichment levels ( e.g. , bh09 ) . for gcs near the massive end of the gc mass function ( where gcs are scarce and hence stochastic variations between gcs are significant )",
    ", the impact of this scatter on the resulting color - mass relation can be significant , especially for galaxies with relatively small specific gc frequencies .",
    "note in this respect that m49 hosts significantly fewer gcs than ngc 1399 and m87 do , see figure 3 of @xcite .",
    "that said , important steps forward in the context of understanding the nature of the color - mass relations of gcs as well as their variations between galaxies can already be made with currently available instrumentation .",
    "one such step will be to obtain accurate photometry and size measurements of gcs _ outside the central few kpc _ sampled by the currently available hst observations of nearby giant ellipticals ( typically only a central pointing ) .",
    "this will not only yield color - magnitude data for gcs in weaker tidal fields which will allow one to evaluate differences in sizes and hence in dynamical evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the lower background levels of the underlying diffuse galaxy light in the outer regions will also allow high - s /",
    "n measurements of spectroscopic metallicities of gcs in the upper @xmath263 mag of the gc luminosity function with 8 - 10 m class telescopes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the latter will be important to decipher the true color - metallicity relation ( rather than one derived from colors and [ fe / h ] values of galactic gcs ; for example , the few galactic gcs that are moderately metal - rich ( @xmath111 \\ga -0.5 $ ] ) have significant foreground extinction ) and its impact on the nature of the blue tilt .",
    "driven by several lines of recent evidence for a `` bottom - heavy '' stellar imf in massive elliptical galaxies , we have investigated the influence of the shape of the imf on the color - magnitude relations for the metal - poor and metal - rich subpopulations of gcs in such galaxies . to this end",
    "we used mass loss calculations for gcs for three imf shapes and a large range of initial gc masses , in conjunction with calculations of integrated - light colors from isochrones .",
    "these calculations were used for two main purposes : _ ( i ) _ to evaluate the effect of evolution of the stellar mass function at subsolar masses on the color - magnitude relations , and _",
    "( ii ) _ to evaluate the impact of gc mass loss on the ( * ? ? ? * bh09 ) model of gc self - enrichment when comparing model predictions to observed color - magnitude diagrams .",
    "our results are compared to observed color - magnitude relations among a very large set of gcs in giant elliptical galaxies from @xcite .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows .    * as to the observed color - magnitude relation among the metal - rich gcs in giant elliptical galaxies ( often referred to as the `` red tilt '' )",
    ", we found that the effect of dynamical evolution of gcs on the stellar mass functions over a hubble time can explain the observed slope of the red tilt along its full extent _ if ( and only if ) the imf was bottom - heavy _",
    "( e.g. , @xmath0 in @xmath1 at subsolar masses ) . + [ -3.3ex ] * conversely , we find that gc self - enrichment is only able to cause a small reddening for the most massive metal - rich gcs ( i.e. , current masses @xmath112 ) .",
    "hence we argue that the observed color - magnitude relation among metal - rich gcs in massive elliptical galaxies constitutes evidence for a bottom - heavy imf in such galaxies .",
    "+ [ -3.3ex ] * as to the `` blue tilt '' among metal - poor gcs , we find that the influence of dynamical evolution of gcs on the stellar mass functions over a hubble time can reproduce the observed tilt only up to a current gc mass @xmath113 , and only if the imf was bottom - heavy . beyond this mass ,",
    "the observed blue tilt is more pronounced than what can be explained by the evolution of stellar mass functions in gcs , so that additional effects ( such as self - enrichment ) are still required to reproduce the full extent of the observed blue tilt .",
    "+ [ -3.3ex ] * when considering the dimming effect of 12 gyr of mass loss in color - magnitude diagrams of gcs , we find that the `` reference '' gc self - enrichment model of bh09 reproduces the shape of the observed blue tilt very well in the cases of kroupa or salpeter imfs .",
    "this result differs from those of previous studies , which did not take gc mass loss by stellar evolution into account .",
    "+ [ -3.3ex ] * when adding the simulated effects of gc self - enrichment and the evolution of stellar mass functions in metal - poor gcs on their @xmath16  colors , the resulting color - mass relation becomes consistent with the observed blue tilt _ for all imf shapes considered here_. this result is due to the fact that while the effect of the gc mass - dependent evolution of stellar mass functions to the @xmath16  colors is significantly stronger for steep imfs ( e.g. , @xmath1143.0 ) than for salpeter or kroupa imfs , the opposite is true for the effect of gc mass loss due to stellar evolution , and the two effects cancel out each other to within the uncertainties .",
    "+ [ -3.3ex ] * we looked into the sensitivity of our results to the choice of the color - metallicity relation . while details such as the mean pre - enrichment metallicity required to make our modeled color - mass relations fit the observed blue and red tilts do differ slightly among color - metallicity relations from the recent literature , the _ shapes _ of the modeled color - mass relations",
    "are found to be consistent from one color - metallicity relation to another .",

    "we argue that further insights into the color - magnitude relations of gcs as well as their variations between galaxies can be obtained by means of high - resolution imaging as well as high - s / n spectroscopy of gcs outside the central few kpc sampled by the currently available hst observations of nearby giant ellipticals . with such information",

    "<S> several recent studies have provided evidence for a `` bottom - heavy '' stellar initial mass function ( imf ) in massive elliptical galaxies . here </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the influence of the imf shape on the recently discovered color - magnitude relation ( cmr ) among globular clusters ( gcs ) in such galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> to this end we use calculations of gc mass loss due to stellar and dynamical evolution to evaluate _ </S>",
    "<S> ( i ) _ the shapes of stellar mass functions in gcs after 12 gyr of evolution as a function of current gc mass along with their effects on integrated - light colors and mass - to - light ratios , and _ </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) _ their impact on the effects of gc self - enrichment using the 2009 `` reference '' model of bailin & harris . as to the class of metal - poor gcs </S>",
    "<S> , we find the observed shape of the cmr ( often referred to as the `` blue tilt '' ) to be very well reproduced by bailin & harris reference self - enrichment model once 12 gyr of gc mass loss is taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> the influence of the imf on this result is found to be insignificant . </S>",
    "<S> however , we find that the observed cmr among the class of _ metal - rich _ gcs ( the `` red tilt '' ) can only be adequately reproduced if the imf was bottom - heavy ( @xmath0 in @xmath1 ) , which causes the stellar mass function at subsolar masses to depend relatively strongly on gc mass . </S>",
    "<S> this constitutes additional evidence that the metal - rich stellar populations in giant elliptical galaxies were formed with a bottom - heavy imf . </S>"
