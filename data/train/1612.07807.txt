    "for centuries , we have judged our stellar neighbors by their covers , amassing broad yet superficial knowledge of the stars in our galaxy by examining only the light emitted from their photospheres .",
    "an opportunity for deeper inquiry has only been available for the past few decades using stellar seismology , allowing us to challenge the theoretical assumptions that underly ever - improving models .",
    "these assumptions matter : stellar models are a critical rung on the ladder to our understanding of extragalactic astronomy , from the integrated stellar light of galaxies to constraining the compact remnants that explode as supernovae ia and measure out cosmological distances .",
    "rotation is a significant property of stars and affects physical processes such as convection , diffusion , and the dynamos generating strong magnetic fields , all of which modify stellar evolution .",
    "even when evolution models incorporate rotation , it is often assumed the star rotates as a solid body . amazingly , we are now in an age where we can use asteroseismology to deeply test for different effects in stars at all stages of evolution  revealing internal rotation profiles ( e.g. , @xcite ) and now even internal magnetic fields ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    ".    one of the significant legacies of the _ kepler _  mission is the measurement of rotation profiles for a wide range of pulsating stars , from several along the upper main sequence ( e.g. , @xcite ) to thousands along the red - giant branch ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . especially significant",
    "is the ability to connect core rotation rates to those in the envelope , probing radial differential rotation and angular momentum evolution .",
    "for example , _ kepler _  data show that the cores of many red giants spin faster than their envelopes ( e.g. , @xcite ) . the relatively slow core rates ( @xmath310  d ) suggest there is an unknown process efficient at transporting internal angular momentum in evolved stars ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    ".    there are few empirical constraints on how angular momentum is conserved all the way through the final stages of stellar evolution .",
    "although the prospects have been discussed for nearly two decades @xcite , only hot pre - white - dwarfs have been studied in sufficient detail to deeply probe their internal rotation profiles , including pg1159@xmath4035  and pg0122 + 200 @xcite .",
    "recent efforts have probed less deeply the cooler zz ceti stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we present here an exceptional laboratory to connect surface and internal rotation of a highly evolved , apparently isolated star that is now passively losing its residual thermal energy .",
    "the white dwarf pg0112 + 104  ( @xmath5  mag , j011437.63 + 104104.3 ) was first identified as a helium - atmosphere ( db ) white dwarf with strong he i features by @xcite .",
    "it was immediately interesting because it was the hottest db known before the sloan digital sky survey filled in the so - called `` db gap '' @xcite .",
    "the recent detailed study by @xcite found that pg0112 + 104  has @xmath6@xmath7 k , @xmath8@xmath9 ( @xmath10  @xmath11 ) .",
    "several groups have searched for photometric variability in pg0112 + 104 , given its proximity to the dbv ( v777  her ) instability strip .",
    "@xcite did not see variability greater than 2.1 parts per thousand ( ppt ) in white - light observations over one night , using a two - channel photometer on the 2.1 m at mcdonald observatory .",
    "subsequently , @xcite saw no significant variability to a limit of 3.1  ppt using roughly 30  min of data taken with the high speed photometer on board the _ hubble space telescope _ , using 10  ms exposures through the f140lp ultraviolet filter .",
    "however , two significant periodicities were detected after a five - day campaign in 2001  october in a three - channel photometer on the 2.1 m at mcdonald observatory @xcite . using 30  hr of white - light photometry ,",
    "@xcite reported variability at @xmath12  s ( 0.87  ppt ) and @xmath13  s ( 0.83  ppt ) not seen in a nearby comparison star .",
    "these periods are consistent with the @xmath2-mode pulsations typically seen in dbvs .",
    "follow - up observations taken over 1.0  hr with a three - channel photometer on the 3.6 m canada - france - hawaii telescope in 2002  july could not confirm variability @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate here that pg0112 + 104  indeed pulsates at the same periods measured by @xcite , plus nine additional independent pulsation modes .",
    "the amplitude of the pulsations are so low that previous non - detections were simply not sensitive enough to observe the variability .",
    "we identify five low - order dipole modes and three quadrupole modes , all of which show rotationally split multiplets and probe the internal rotation at different depths .",
    "additionally , we observe a clear photometric signature of the surface rotation rate , likely caused by a spot rotating into and out of view .",
    "we targeted pg0112 + 104  for observations during campaign  8 of the _ k2 _",
    "mission ; short - cadence data were obtained by guest observer programs in cycle 3 proposed by kawaler ( go8011 ) , hermes ( go8018 ) , and redfield ( go8048 ) . cataloged as epic  220670436 ( @xmath14  mag ) , pg0112 + 104  was observed beginning 2016  january  04 for 78.723  d with a duty cycle of 96.0% .",
    "we obtained the short - cadence target pixel file ( data release version 11 ) from the mikulski archive for space telescopes and processed it using the pyke software package managed by the _",
    "k2 _  guest observer office @xcite .",
    "we first defined the best pixel extraction using a range of options , and settled on a large aperture with a total of 25  pixels centered around our target .",
    "we extracted the light curve , and noticed improved results by not subtracting the median pixel value from each exposure as an estimate of the background .",
    "we subsequently fit out a second - order polynomial to flatten the longest - term trends .",
    "we then used the kepsff task @xcite to mitigate motion - correlated noise caused by the regular thruster firings that control the _ kepler _  roll angle .",
    "we fit out a sixth - order polynomial to this self - flat - fielded light curve to remove long - term thermal systematics in the _ k2 _",
    "light curve . finally , we iteratively clipped all points falling 3@xmath15 from the mean using the vartools software package @xcite .",
    "most data were clipped in a region when the spacecraft dropped out of fine point control , leading to a 1.3-d gap beginning roughly 28.1  d from the start of observations .",
    "a total of 4591 points were clipped , leaving @xmath16 observations .",
    "the point - to - point scatter in the light curve prevents by - eye detection of the pulsations .",
    "however , the signals come clearly into focus after taking a discrete fourier transform ( ft ) of the data , which we present in figure  [ fig : ft ] .",
    "our fts here have been oversampled by a factor of 20 .    to compute a significance threshold for each peak in the ft we performed a monte carlo simulation of the data , as described in @xcite . in short ,",
    "we keep the time sampling of the data but randomly shuffle the fluxes , creating @xmath17 synthetic light curves ; we catalog the maximum amplitude at any frequency from the ft of each synthetic light curve .",
    "we find that 99.0% of these synthetic fts do not have a peak exceeding 0.117  ppt , and 99.7% do not exceed 0.121  ppt ( all synthetic fts have a maximum peak larger than 0.090  ppt ) .",
    "we set our significance threshold as the value for which there is a @xmath181% chance the signal could arise from noise : 0.117  ppt .",
    "this is marked as a red dotted line in all figures .",
    "this is nearly identical to 5@xmath19 , where @xmath19 is the average amplitude of the ft : @xmath20  ppt .    table  [ tab : freq ] catalogs all significant frequencies detected in pg0112 + 104 , which were computed using a simultaneous non - linear least squares fit for the frequency , amplitude , and phase of all peaks using the software period04 @xcite .",
    "the high precision of the _ kepler _  data actually requires a frequency correction due to the gravitational redshift and line - of - sight doppler motion of the white dwarf @xcite . using the measured radial velocity of @xmath21  km s@xmath22  @xcite",
    ", we transform the observed frequencies ( @xmath23 ) to those in the stellar rest frame ( @xmath24 ) with the relationship @xmath25 . all frequencies arising from pulsations and rotation",
    "have been corrected to the stellar rest frame in table  [ tab : freq ] ( the phases were unchanged ) .",
    "all amplitudes from our least - squares fit have a formal uncertainty of 0.019  ppt .",
    "the least - squares fit includes the instrumental electronic ( long - cadence ) artifacts listed in table  [ tab : freq ] .",

    "this is the first time a photometric rotation rate has been observed in a pulsating white dwarf , and its source is not immediately evident .",

    "time - series ultraviolet spectroscopy could confirm this hypothesis in pg0112 + 104 , since the surface abundance of the carbon lines should change with rotational phase .",

    "there are clear patterns of frequency spacing in the ft of pg0112 + 104 , which point to a lifting of degeneracy in the pulsations caused by rotation ; the non - radial @xmath2-mode oscillations of white dwarfs can be decomposed into spherical harmonics of radial order , @xmath68 , spherical degree , @xmath69 , and azimuthal order , @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "to first order , the frequency splittings ( @xmath71 ) are related to the stellar rotation ( @xmath72 ) by the relation @xmath73 where @xmath74 represents the effect of the coriolis force on the pulsations as formulated by @xcite .",

    "significantly , the observed splittings suggest a white dwarf rotation rate of roughly 10hr . assuming solid - body rotation at 10.17404  hr in the limit such that the horizontal displacement is much larger than the vertical displacement ( which is the case for @xmath2-modes in white dwarfs )  @xmath79",
    " implies rotational splittings for @xmath76 modes of 13.7@xmath59hz  and 22.8@xmath59hz  for @xmath78 modes .",
    "sensitivity to mode - trapping effects from structural discontinuities in the white dwarf model push low - order modes away from the asymptotic limit ( @xmath80 ) , so we expect these values to be lower limits for the amount of the rotational splittings @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with what we observe in the frequency differences in table  [ tab : freq ] .",
    "all three peaks of the two highest - amplitude dipole modes are significant , unambiguously identifying the central components of @xmath81 as @xmath82  s and @xmath83 as @xmath84  s. the next two dipole modes only have two significant peaks , complicating mode identification .",
    "for @xmath85 we see weak evidence for a peak at @xmath86  @xmath59hz  ( 0.053  ppt ) , so we propose the @xmath87 component of @xmath85 is @xmath88  s. similarly , we see marginal evidence for a peak at @xmath89  @xmath59hz  ( 0.067  ppt ) , so we propose the central component of @xmath90 is @xmath91  s.    none of the peaks around 6277  @xmath59hz  are formally significant , but their frequency spacing fits our established pattern . our alternative light curve extraction calculated from the same aperture but subtracting the background provides stronger support for this as an independent mode .",

    "we have used this best - fit to assign the radial order of the modes identified in table  [ tab : m0 ] , since these values are consistent for all best - fit solutions .",
    "our preliminary asteroseismology also consistently points to this dbv being hotter than @xmath150  k. however , we do not believe our best fit is confidently at a global minimum .",
    "this is unfortunate : once we are able to calculate the absolute best - fit to the observed periods , we can then perform an inversion to measure the rotation frequencies at various depths , testing for radial differential rotation .",
    "this occurs because modes of different radial order can sample different regions of the star from other modes of the same spherical degree .",
    "some modes are more sensitive to deeper regions in the star , while others are trapped in the outer layers ; this allows us to probe the rotation rate with depth .",
    "we will undertake this more detailed analysis in a future publication .",
    "the modes are restricted to different regions of the star depending on where the radial nodes coincide with sharp changes in the brunt - visl  frequency , which are caused by rapid changes in the chemical profile of this chemically stratified compact object .",
    "the trapping patterns of these low - radial - order @xmath2-modes can be visualized by observing the deviations in the mean period spacing , as well as in the observed rotational splittings , both of which are affected by structural changes in the star .",
    "we show in figure  [ fig : splitsdipoles ] deviations in constant period spacing and rotational splitting for the @xmath76 modes present in pg0112 + 104 .",
    "we show the same analysis for the @xmath78 modes in figure  [ fig : splitsquads ] .    fitting a straight line to the consecutive @xmath87 modes",
    "provides a measure of the mean period spacing , which is sensitive to the overall mass of the star . for the @xmath76 modes we observe @xmath151  s ( the uncertainties are computing from the residuals between the observed periods and the linear fit ) .",
    "similarly , for the @xmath78 modes we observe @xmath152  s. the ratio expected for @xmath153 from theory is @xmath154 , and we find @xmath155 , within expectations .",
    "while neither value puts strong constraints on the stellar parameters , the relatively large period spacings suggest a relatively low - mass dbv , using the models published in @xcite : @xmath156  @xmath11  if @xmath6@xmath157  k , as suggested by spectroscopy .",
    "it is very interesting that the deviations from the mean period spacing in the @xmath76 modes are correlated with the differences in splittings , shown in the bottom panels of figure  [ fig : splitsdipoles ] .",
    "both effects result from mode trapping .",
    "@xcite show that this may be an indication of @xmath158 decreasing with @xmath159 ( see their figure 6 ) .",
    "the differences appear anti - correlated for the @xmath78 modes shown in figure  [ fig : splitsquads ] .",
    "finally , we have explored any asymmetry in the frequency splittings that could be caused by magnetic fields @xcite . since we can not see the displacement relative to the @xmath87 component in the @xmath78 modes , we only use the @xmath76 modes for this analysis modes , @xmath109 and @xmath107 .",
    "both show significantly larger splittings between the @xmath113 to @xmath117 components , compared to @xmath106 to @xmath160 . ] .",
    "the frequency splittings for both @xmath81 and @xmath83 are symmetric to within the uncertainties ( 0.017  @xmath59hz  and 0.020  @xmath59hz , respectively ) . following the method and the scaling factor detailed in @xcite , the frequency symmetry constrains the dipolar magnetic field of pg0112 + 104  to be @xmath67  kg .",
    "the detection of pulsations and rotational modulation in pg0112 + 104  is exceptional for several reasons .",
    "first , observable pulsations in such a hot dbv strongly challenges theoretical predictions of the blue edge of the dbv instability strip given current estimates of convective efficiency in db white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the top 20 best - fit solutions found in our preliminary asteroseismic analysis agree within 2@xmath15 with the spectroscopically inferred atmospheric parameters , found from the detailed study of @xcite to be @xmath6  @xmath161  k and @xmath8  @xmath9  cgs .",
    "the most recent parameters reported by @xcite agree with this determination : @xmath6  @xmath162  k and @xmath8  @xmath163 .",
    "non - adiabatic calculations do not predict pulsating db white dwarfs with @xmath6  @xmath164  k @xcite , and trace amounts of hydrogen restrict rather than expand the instability strip @xcite .",
    "the relatively low - amplitude pulsations observed in pg0112 + 104  demonstrate that many white dwarfs that have been observed not to pulsate , mostly from the ground , may indeed vary but at amplitudes below historical detection limits .",
    "additionally , pg0112 + 104  is the first pulsating white dwarf known with a photometric signal corresponding to the surface rotation period .",
    "we infer that the strongest signal originating from pg0112 + 104  corresponds to a surface rotation period of @xmath60hr .",
    "a folded light curve suggests this modulation arises from a hot spot on the white dwarf that is stable in amplitude and phase over the entire 78.7-d _",
    "k2 _  light curve , to within the uncertainties .",
    "we speculate that this photometric signal is caused by redistributed flux from the ultraviolet by an opacity source localized on the surface , perhaps by a weak magnetic field .",
    "however , the symmetry in the observed pulsation splittings constrains the dipole field strength to be @xmath67  kg .",
    "we detect 11 independent pulsation modes , the majority of which have solid mode identifications and corroborate the surface rotation period . both the lack of observed @xmath165 pulsation modes and spot modeling suggest we observe pg0112 + 104  at an inclination of @xmath360 degrees .",
    "importantly , the observed rotational splittings in these modes are not identical , since the modes are confined to different depths within the star as a result of mode - trapping effects . as such",
    ", the pulsations provide an exceptional laboratory to test the radial differential rotation and internal compositional stratification of a highly evolved stellar remnant .",
    "our preliminary asteroseismic analysis using a coarse grid of adiabatic models has not yielded a reliable global minimum , which is necessary to compute a full inversion to measure the radial rotation profile .",
    "we will undertake a more detailed asteroseismic analysis in a future work , and especially look forward to modeling efforts of pg0112 + 104  using the static , parametrized equilibrium structures described in @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that such a hot dbv is also an exquisite laboratory for plasmon neutrino production : we expect its neutrino luminosity to exceed its photon luminosity by up to 30% @xcite .",
    "monitoring the rate of period change of the pulsations of pg0112 + 104  over several years will allow us to infer this excess cooling from neutrino emission .",
    "all 26 of the pulsation frequencies in pg0112 + 104  are extremely stable in phase , which is unique among hot dbvs observed over long enough baselines ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the highest - amplitude pulsations in pg0112 + 104  all currently have limits of @xmath166 s s@xmath22 with just this 78.7-d _ k2 _ dataset . while the low amplitudes require multiple nights of observations for ground - based follow - up , the _ k2 _",
    "data provides the perfect anchor for such a long - term project .",
