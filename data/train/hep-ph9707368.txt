    "the weak decays of hadrons containing a heavy quark offer the most direct way to determine the weak mixing angles of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix and to explore the physics of cp violation .",
    "however , an understanding of the connection between quark and hadron properties is a necessary prerequisite for a quantitative theoretical description of these processes .",
    "the complexity of strong - interaction effects increases with the number of quarks appearing in the final state .",
    "bound - state effects in leptonic decays can be lumped into a single parameter ( the `` decay constant '' ) , while those in semileptonic decays are described by invariant form factors , depending on the momentum transfer @xmath3 between the hadrons .",
    "approximate symmetries of the strong interactions help us to constrain the properties of these form factors @xcite . for non - leptonic decays , on the other hand",
    ", we are still lacking a comprehensive understanding of strong - interaction effects even in simple decay modes .",
    "the problem is exemplified in fig .",
    "[ fig : nonlep ] , which shows multiple exchanges of gluons between the quarks in the initial and final states .",
    "the intricate interplay between weak and strong forces has many surprising consequences , whose understanding is a challenge to theory .",
    "examples are the @xmath4 selection rule in @xmath5 decays , the difference in the lifetimes of the charm mesons @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and the difference of the lifetimes of the @xmath8 and @xmath0 particles .",
    "although strong - interaction are more dramatic at low energies , they are still hard to understand even in @xmath0 decays .",
    "= 7.5 cm    at tree level in the standard model , non - leptonic weak decays are mediated by a single @xmath9-exchange diagram .",
    "when the external quarks have energies much below the electroweak scale , this process can be described by a local four - fermion interaction , which gets modified if hard gluon exchanges between the quarks are included .",
    "their effects can be taken into account by using the renormalization group to evolve the effective interaction from the electroweak scale down to a scale @xmath10 of order @xmath11 , the mass of the decaying @xmath12 quark .",
    "for the case of @xmath13 transitions , e.g. , the relevant part of the effective hamiltonian is @xmath14 where @xmath15 etc .",
    "are left - handed , colour - singlet quark currents .",
    "the wilson coefficients @xmath16 are known to next - to - leading order  @xcite . at the scale @xmath17",
    ", they have the values @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "these coefficients take into account the short - distance corrections arising from the exchange of hard gluons .",
    "the effects of soft gluons ( with virtualities below the scale @xmath10 ) remain in the hadronic matrix elements of the local four - quark operators . a reliable field - theoretic calculation of these matrix elements is the obstacle to a quantitative theory of hadronic weak decays .    using fierz identities , the four - quark operators in the effective hamiltonian may be rewritten in various forms .",
    "it is particularly convenient to rearrange them in such a way that the flavour quantum numbers of one of the quark currents match those of one of the hadrons in the final state of the considered decay process . as an example , consider the decays @xmath20",
    ". omitting common factors , the various decay amplitudes may be written as @xmath21 where @xmath22 are the su(3 ) colour matrices .",
    "the last relation follows from isospin symmetry of the strong interactions .",
    "the three classes of decays shown above are referred to as class-1 , class-2 and class-3 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the above decay amplitudes contain the `` factorizable contributions '' @xmath23 the matrix elements in this equation are known in terms of the meson decay constants @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and the transition form factors for the decays @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "most of these quantities are accessible experimentally .",
    "of course , the matrix elements appearing in ( [ ampl ] ) also contain other , non - factorizable contributions .",
    "in general , we may define process - dependent hadronic parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 , which contain the non - factorizable corrections , in such a way that the decay amplitudes take the form @xmath30 with @xcite@xcite @xmath31 \\nonumber\\\\     & & \\mbox{}+ c_2(\\mu)\\,\\varepsilon_8^{(bd)\\pi}(\\mu ) \\",

    "the effective coefficients @xmath32 take into account all contributions to the matrix elements and are thus @xmath10 independent .",
    "the scale dependence of the wilson coefficients is exactly balanced by that of the hadronic parameters .",
    "additional insight can be gained by combining these results with the @xmath33 expansion @xcite . at the scale @xmath34 ,",
    "the large-@xmath35 counting rules of qcd imply @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 .",
    "( for scales much lower than @xmath11 , the counting rules for the wilson coefficients @xmath16 are spoiled by large logarithms . )",
    "hence , we expect that @xmath40 , whereas contributions from @xmath29 can be larger . using these results",
    ", we find from ( [ a1a2 ] ) @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a process - dependent hadronic parameter of order @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "it is important to stress that the naive choice @xmath43 and @xmath44 , which is often referred to as `` factorization hypothesis '' , does not correspond to _ any _ consistent limit of qcd ; in particular , this is not a prediction of the @xmath33 expansion .",
    "the more general expression for @xmath45 given above was first introduced in ref .  @xcite .",
    "since the parameter @xmath29 is of order @xmath33 , the two contributions to @xmath46 are of the same magnitude , and hence @xmath46 should be considered as an unknown dynamical parameter . as a general rule , we expect that non - factorizable corrections are small in class-1 transitions . in class-2",
    "decays , on the other hand , the contribution proportional to @xmath29 is enhanced by the large value of the ratio @xmath47 , and non - factorizable contributions can therefore be sizeable .",
    "the parameter @xmath29 obeys the renormalization - group equation @xmath48 where the superscript @xmath49 represents the dependence on the decay process .",
    "let us assume that , for each process , there exists a `` factorization scale '' @xmath50 such that @xmath51 .",
    "( we will see later that this is indeed the case for two - body decays of @xmath0 mesons . ) then ( [ rge ] ) implies that the phenomenological parameter @xmath46 is given by @xcite @xmath52 based on the colour transparency argument of bjorken @xcite , we expect that @xmath50 scales with the energy of the outgoing hadrons in a decay process . a fast - moving pair of quarks in a colour - singlet state acts as a colour dipole and decouples from soft gluons",
    ". only hard gluons , with virtualities of order the energy of the outgoing particles , can rearrange the quarks and thus spoil factorization . on a qualitative level",
    ", the connection between the factorization scale and the energy release in the final state can be seen from fig .  [",
    "fig : a2a1 ] , where we show the ratio @xmath53 as a function of @xmath54 . as we will see later ,",
    "the value preferred by @xmath55 decays is positive and corresponds to a rather small coupling , indicating @xmath56 for these processes . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath57 decays indicate a negative value of @xmath53 , corresponding to a lower value of the factorization scale .",
    "this is in accordance with the fact that in these processes the energy released to the final - state particles is much smaller .",
    "= 7.5 cm    in two - body decays of @xmath0 mesons , the energy release ( per particle ) in different processes differs by less than about 1  gev .",
    "combining this observation with the empirical fact that in @xmath20 decays the scale @xmath50 is of order @xmath11 , we find that the changes of the phenomenological parameter @xmath46 in different decay channels are of order @xcite @xmath58 thus , on rather general grounds , we expect that in two - body @xmath0 decays , to a good approximation , @xmath46 is process independent .",
    "we shall refer to this assumption , together with the prediction for the parameters @xmath59 and @xmath45 given in ( [ xidef ] ) , as _ generalized factorization hypothesis_.",
    "adopting the theoretical framework described above , a prediction of hadronic decay amplitudes needs as input information meson decay constants and form factors .",
    "the decay constants of many light mesons are known with high accuracy from hadronic @xmath60 decays , and from the electromagnetic decays of vector mesons @xcite .",
    "the meson form factors of quark currents can , to some extend , be extracted from semileptonic decays . whereas the various @xmath61 transition form factors are well - known by combining data from semileptonic decays with heavy - quark symmetry relations @xcite , the available information about form factors describing the decays of @xmath0 mesons into light mesons is largely model dependent . as a consequence , for all",
    "class-1 decays considered below the factorized decay amplitudes can be predicted without any model assumptions ; however , the theoretical predictions for class-2 amplitudes involve larger theoretical uncertainties . in this work",
    ", we will adopt the nrsx model @xcite to calculate the meson form factors .",
    "because of lack of information , we shall neglect final - state interactions between the produced hadrons in the final state . in energetic two - body decays of @xmath0 mesons",
    ", these effects are expected to be small @xcite .",
