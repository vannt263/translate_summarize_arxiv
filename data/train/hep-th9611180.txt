    "the 2 + 1 dimensional gauge field theories with chern - simons ( c - s ) term have had a lot of motivation to study .",
    "in addition to their own theoretical interests , they are expected to describe the physics of the planar systems like the quantum hall effect @xcite and the high @xmath1 superconductivity @xcite .",
    "many interesting and remarkable properties of these theories have been found in past a decade , such as their chiral dynamics @xcite , the spontaneous parity violation by radiatively induced c - s terms @xcite . a few years ago , it was also found that in a model of three dimensional quantum electrodynamics ( @xmath0 ) with a bare c - s term the spontaneous magnetic field can be stable by the fermion loop effects , which eventually triggers the dynamical lorentz symmetry breaking ( hosotani @xcite ) .",
    "he has calculated the energy densities as a function of the magnetic field @xmath2 in the fermion one - loop level and showed that the minimum of the energy density can be at @xmath3 under a consistency condition for non - zero magnetic fields .",
    "it has been found that this condition is also regarded as the sufficient condition for the spontaneous generation of the magnetic field as well @xcite . according to the spontaneous lorentz symmetry breaking ,",
    "the physical photon , which is topologically massive in the tree level due to the bare c - s term , becomes massless as a nambu - goldstone boson .",
    "this mechanism of the spontaneous magnetization has been extended into the cases with massive fermions with non - zero fermion density @xcite . even in the case of no bare c - s term",
    ", the spontaneous magnetization can occur by adding heavy fermions because the c - s term induced by them can play the same role as the bare c - s term @xcite .",
    "the spontaneous magnetic field is expected to be important in the connection with the problem of the fractional quantum hall effect @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "the thermodynamic properties of the spontaneous magnetization in @xmath0 with a bare c - s term are investigated .",
    "some of the thermodynamic properties of the model without external fields have been studied to some extent in the different contexts so far .",
    "the specific heat for different values of the statistical angle is analyzed in ref .",
    "the restoration of the parity at high temperature limit has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which it has been found that the radiatively induced parity violating c - s term vanishes only in the high temperature limit .",
    "our aim here is to examine whether the spontaneous magnetic field , which is dynamically generated at @xmath4 , vanishes or not in a high temperature region .",
    "the model we are studying here is based on ref .",
    "@xcite , in which all fermions are very light so that a non - zero bare c - s term is needed in the lagrangian for the magnetization @xcite . in the finite temperature system ,",
    "the energy density is replaced by the thermodynamical potential .",
    "the quantum fluctuation of the thermodynamical potential is investigated in the fermion one - loop level here .",
    "the coefficient of the linear term with respect to the magnetic field in the potential is calculated as a function of temperature as well as the classical part of the potential .",
    "negative values of the coefficient mean the existence of the spontaneous magnetic field at finite temperature . we find that the coefficient becomes more ( negative ) large behaving like @xmath5 in high temperature region .",
    "thus the spontaneous magnetic field does not vanish even at high temperature .",
    "in addition , the spectrum of photons is also investigated in the finite temperature system . at zero temperature ,",
    "the photons are topologically massive at tree level .",
    "the mass amounts to the c - s coefficient . if the magnetization occurs , the bare coefficient of the c - s term is exactly cancelled by the radiative effects @xcite , so that the photons becomes massless .",
    "therefore the photons are regarded as the nambu - goldstone bosons of the dynamical breakdown of the lorentz symmetry @xcite . on the other hand , at finite temperature , the lorentz symmetry is explicitly broken by thermal effects .",
    "the photons are then no longer massless even if the magnetization occurs . in general , they eventually have the thermal masses @xcite .",
    "the magnetic part of the field strength , however , become statically massless and the magnetic force is a long - range force without the screening @xcite if the topological mass is cancelled out . we find that , in our model with massless fermions , the bare topological mass is completely cancelled by the radiative effects even at finite temperature if the magnetization occurs .",
    "this implies that the static mass of magnetic fields vanishes according to the magnetization even at high temperature .",
    "this is consistent with the result of the non - vanishing magnetic field by the thermodynamic potential approach .",
    "it is also found that in the case of massive fermions the topological mass is cancelled out only in the ` chirally symmetric ' cases with massive fermions .",
    "furthermore we naively realize the reason of the spontaneous magnetization from the viewpoint of the difference of the free energies of free photons between @xmath3 and @xmath6 , where @xmath2 is the magnetic field .",
    "it is found from rough estimation that the linear @xmath7 term with a negative coefficient appears in the difference .",
    "this explains the magnetization at finite temperature to some extent .",
    "these characteristics of the magnetization at finite temperature might be interesting in the connection with the physics such as the high @xmath1 superconductivity .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", some general properties and statistic characteristics of the model will be presented . in sec 3 , the spontaneous magnetization in this model in @xmath4 case will be reviewed briefly for a preparation for @xmath8 cases in order to clarify the essential point for the magnetization and also to fix some notations . the strategy to extend the investigation to the finite temperature system",
    "will be explained then .",
    "4 will be devoted to the calculation of self - energies of gauge bosons in the one - loop level and the weak - field approximation .",
    "in sec . 5 , the results that the spontaneous magnetic field does not vanish will be presented in the fermion massless limit by analyzing the effective potential both analytically and numerically . in sec .",
    "6 , the spectrum of the physical photons will be examined in the finite temperature system . in sec .",

    "<S> the spontaneous magnetization in chern - simons @xmath0 is discussed in a finite temperature system . </S>",
    "<S> the thermodynamical potential is analyzed within the weak field approximation and in the fermion massless limit . </S>",
    "<S> we find that there is a linear term with respect to the magnetic field with a negative coefficient at any finite temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the spontaneous magnetic field does not vanish even at high temperature . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we examine the photon spectrum in the system . we find that the bare chern - simons coefficient is cancelled by the radiative effects . </S>",
    "<S> the photons then become topologically massless according to the magnetization , though they are massive by finite temperature effects . </S>",
    "<S> thus the magnetic field is a long - range force without the screening even at high temperature .    </S>",
