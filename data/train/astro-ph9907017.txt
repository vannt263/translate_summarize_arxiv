    "the number density of variable stars at 20th mag is poorly known .",
    "simple scaling from extensive searches for variable stars in the 1417 magnitude range suggests about 80 @xmath26@xmath27 brighter than 20th mag at low galactic latitudes ( e.g. hudec 1998 , hudec & wenzel 1996 ) .",

    "the non - detection of persistent k - band emission during august 1998 is also consistent with the expectation for the donor ( assuming a quiescent system in which the accretion disk does not dominate the light ) . with a ratio @xmath30=0.112 ( rieke & lebofsky 1985 ) the total galactic k - band extinction is @xmath31=0.31 mag . with a location",
    "only 6 degrees away from the galactic center , the distance of 18  is likely of the order of 8 kpc .",
    "indeed , cocchi  ( 1999 ) recently estimated a distance of 5 kpc from one particularly bright x - ray burst which showed signatures of photospheric radius expansion . with this distance and using a mean ( v  k)@xmath32=1 mag ( johnson 1966 ) , our k - band limiting magnitude of @xmath33 mag implies @xmath34 mag , consistent with a late - type main - sequence donor , and similar to other x - ray bursters . with a range of @xmath35 mag for late - type main - sequence donors and intrinsic colours of @xmath36 mag the expected k band magnitude of the quiescent donor is k @xmath3 17.519 mag , thus making even spectroscopy feasible .",
    "the amplitude of @xmath37r @xmath38 2 mag between march and august 1998 requires a difference in the x - ray illumination ( flux ) of about a factor of 100 ( according to the relation between x - ray flux and reprocessed visual flux found by van paradijs & mcclintock 1994 ) .",
    "such a factor in flux difference is reasonable to be valid for this transient ( though we are not aware of an x - ray observation during august 1998 ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that the brightness and colors of the proposed counterpart to 18  obtained during two epochs in 1998 are consistent with the expectations for a transient x - ray burst source .",
