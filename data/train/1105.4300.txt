    "most recently , hammerer _ et _ _ al _ @xcite and wallquist @xcite have shown the possibility to achieve strong cavity - mediated coupling between a single microscopic atom and a macroscopic mechanical oscillator .",
    "in addition , genes @xcite studied tripartite entanglement among atom , mirror and cavity field . as we all know , atomic coherence results in many interesting phenomena @xcite such as electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) ,  correlation emission laser ( cel ) , laser without inversion ( lwi ) .",
    "a lot of works have been done on the entanglement directly induced by atomic coherence @xcite .",
    "when one of the mirrors of the cavity is movable , the atomic coherence effects are not studied before . in this paper , we propose a method to entangle two macroscopic mirrors via microscopic atomic coherence .",
    "when atomic beam with cascade configuration is injected into the two - mode cavity , the two - mode fields as well as the optomechanical oscillator are entangled . in refs .",
    "single , single2 , authors treat the cavity field as a quantum bus and give an effective coupling between oscillator and the single atomic motion .",
    "instead , we directly treat hybrid system .",

    "the system under study is a two mode cavity with one fixed partially transmitting mirror and two movable perfectly reflecting mirrors , sketched in fig .",
    "the atomic medium with cascade configuration is injected into the cavity and interacts with two - mode cavity fields with detuning @xmath0 , respectively ( @xmath1 ) .",

    "we write each operators of the system as the sum of their steady - state mean value and a small fluctuation with zero mean value .",
    "the fluctuations can be calculated analytically by using the linearization approach of quantum optics @xcite , provided that the nonlinear effect between the cavity field and the movable mirrors is weak .",
    "we can linearize the fluctuations around the steady state using eqs.([langevin ] ) and obtain a set of linear quantum langevin equations for the fluctuation operators .",

    "we have defined @xmath59a is the drift matrix .",
    "the system is stable only if the real part of all the eigenvalues of the matrix a are negative , which is also the requirement of the validity of the linearization method .",
    "because of the atomic cascade form , the system can be a amplifying system , that is to say , for some parameters , the eigenvalues of drift matrix a can have a positive real part .",
    "so , we must carefully eliminate the parameters region in order to retain it within the stability conditions .",
    "due to the twelve dimensions of drift matrix a , it is not easy to obtain the analytic expression of the requirement as @xcite eigenvalues",
    ". we will guarantee the requirement via numerical method .",
    "all the parameters chosen in this paper have been verified to satisfy the stability conditions .",
    "we investigate the nature of linear quantum correlations among fields and mirrors by considering the steady state of the correlation matrix of quantum fluctuations in this multipartite system . the quantum noises @xmath60 and @xmath61 are zero - mean quantum gaussian noises and the dynamics has been linearized , as a consequence , the steady state of the system is a zero - mean multi - partite gaussian state .",
    "we defined @xmath62 $ ] , the element of covariance matrix .",
    "one can obtain various correlation information from it , and we will show the entanglement of the two mirrors as well as the two - mode fields after obtaining the covariance matrix .",
    "we now recall entanglement criteria of continuous variable proposed by duan @xcite and simon @xcite . according to @xcite",
    ", a state is entangled if the summation of the quantum fluctuations in the two epr - like operators @xmath63 and @xmath64 satisfy the following inequality @xmath65for the mechanical oscillator we define @xmath66 while for the two mode fields @xmath67 .",
    "the criterion in eq.(11 ) can be directly detected in experiment via homodyne measurements @xcite .",
    "simon s criterion has more direct relation with covariance matrix proposed in @xcite and developed in @xcite . for a physical state",
    ", the covariance matrix must obey the robertson - schrodinger uncertainty principle,@xmath68where @xmath69 $ ] with @xmath70 $ ] when we define vector @xmath71 for two - mode fields @xcite .",
    "if a state is separable , partial transpose matrix @xmath72 ( obtained from @xmath73 just by taking @xmath74 in @xmath75 ) still obey the inequality in ( [ uncertainty ] ) .",
    "the inequality requires that all the symplectic eigenvalues of the transposed matrix are larger than 1/2 in terms of the definition of eq.(10 ) .",
    "the symplectic eigenvalues can be calculated from the square roots of the ordinary eigenvalues of @xmath76casse , zhao .",
    "so , if the smallest eigenvalue is smaller than 1/2 , the transposed mode is then inseparable .",
    "for the two - mode gaussian states , the violation of the inequality is a sufficient and necessary condition for the existence of entanglement between the transposed mode and the remaining modes .    neglecting the frequency dependence as it was pointed in @xcite , under the condition of markovian approximation , the frequency domain treatment is equivalent to the time domain derivation considered in @xcite . when the stability conditions ( all real parts of eigenvalues of matrix a are negative ) are satisfied , the steady state correlation matrix of the quantum fluctuation meet the following lyapunov equation @xcite@xmath77where @xmath78 , @xmath79 $ ] .",
    "( solid ) , @xmath80 ( dash - dot ) , @xmath81 ( dashed ) .",
    "( b ) plot the entanglement of the two mode fields where @xmath82 .",
    "for all the plots , the other parameters are @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 . the wavelength of the laser @xmath87 with power @xmath88 , and the mechanical quality factor @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 . ]        for simplicity , we choose all parameters of the two mirrors and the two mode cavities are the same , for example @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , etc .. then the effective detuning @xmath97 . in fig.2",
    ", we choose the atoms injected into the cavity with initial state @xmath98 .",
    "as already shown in @xcite , many features of the radiation - pressure interaction in the cavity can be understood by considering that the driving laser light is scattered by the vibrating cavity boundary mostly at the first stokes @xmath99 and anti - stokes @xmath100 .",
    "therefore , the optomechanical interaction will be enhanced when the cavity is resonant with one of the two sidebands , i.e. , when @xmath101 , where entanglement between cavity field and mirror is enhanced . here , due to the atomic medium existence , the two sideband move towards its middle .",
    "in addition , within the region of parameter in fig .",
    "2a we can observe that the larger value of the coupling , the deeper squeezing in  the fluctuation .",
    "undoubtedly , the entanglement is resulted from the interaction between atoms and the fields as well as the atomic level coherence , therefore , the larger coupling @xmath32 the deeper squeezing within our parameters .",
    "the enhancement of @xmath32 can be substituted by increasing the injection rate of the atoms .",
    "2b show that the two - mode fields are entangled for nearly the whole region of detuning @xmath102 ( from 0 to 1 ) . using the same group of parameters , from the solution of eq.(13 )",
    "we reconstruct two - partite covariance matrixes for mirrors and two - mode fields and show their smallest eigenvalues under partial transpose , shown in fig.3 .",
    "one can see that fig.3 are almost the same in shape with fig.2 , that is to say , the entanglement judged with two criteria are equal . by showing the entanglement with two criteria ,",
    "we prove our correction of calculation and convince the entanglement existence .    for cascade atomic configuration system ,",
    "the process of radiation two - mode fields are correspondence to parametric - down - conversion process .",
    "so , one can easy understand the two - mode entanglement . for fixed mirror",
    ", it has been known that two cavity modes are entangled when they interact with cascade three - level atoms @xcite . here , we show further that when one mirror is movable , the two - mode entangled continuous - variable state still hold . in our numerical simulation , we find that there is a threshold coupling between atoms and fields ( under these group of parameters ) , below that we have no two entangled mirrors , which means that the appropriate coupling between atoms and cavity is favorable if we would have entangled mirrors .",
    "thus , the radiation fields emitted from cascade atoms can be entangled , and the entanglement of the two - mode field can be transferred into the mechanical mirror because of the radiation - pressure interaction . as a consequence , we have both the entanglement of two - mode fields and two mirrors .",
    "because one can not direct access to the intracavity fields , if one would like to use the entanglement , he need to export the entangled fiedls first ; thus only the output entanglement of the optical cavity has practical meaning .",
    "in addition , by means of spectral filters , one can always select many different traveling output modes originating from a single intracavity mode , which offer us the opportunity to easily produce and manipulate a multipartite system , eventually possessing multipartite entanglement genes .",
    "so , in this section we study the entanglement of the output field .",
    "the input - output relation for the two mode fields are @xmath103the linear equation of ( [ linear ] ) can be solved in the frequency domain by fourier transformation with the solution @xmath104 . in the interaction picture",
    "@xmath105 represents the detuning from the cavity frequency @xcite .",
    "considering the relation of ( [ outa ] ) , we have @xmath106where @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109^{t}$ ] .",
    "we can finally obtain the output correlation matrix @xmath110 $ ] , and the squeezing spectrum @xmath111\\end{aligned}\\]]can be calculated from the correlation matrix .",
    "the spectrum is defined in a frame of      ( solid ) @xmath112 ( dashed ) .",
    "( b ) shows the squeezing spectrum under different input - atomic state .",
    "for solid line @xmath113 , for dashed line @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 in fig.4b , @xmath117 .",
    "for all the line in fig.4 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 , and the other parameters are the same with fig.2 . ]",
    "fig.4 shows the two - mode output squeezing spectrum , which can also be considered as a measure of entanglement in frequency domain@xcite . in fig.4a",
    ", we notice that deep squeezing ( usually means that the maximum entanglement ) happen when @xmath120 , that is to say , when the output frequency is equal to that of cavity frequency , we have maximum entanglement .",
    "it is very interesting to observe that the deep squeezing are affected by the frequency of optomechanical oscillator .",
    "the larger frequency of the mirror , the smaller entanglement .",
    "we can deduce that if the mirrors is fixed , we should have the deepest squeezing in fluctuation of the output fields .",
    "the more higher frequency of the mirrors , the more entanglement can be transferred from the fields to the mirrors so that the smaller entanglement is leaved in the output fields .",
    "fig.4b shows the squeezing spectrum affected by the initial atomic state . as we have discuss above ,",
    "the entanglement of two - mode fields as well as the two mirrors originate from the atomic coherence .",
    "undoubtedly , the initial atomic coherence affects both the intracavity entanglement and the output entanglement . for the best coherence of atomic initial state @xmath121",
    ", we have one valley of deep squeezing when the output frequency is the same as to that of cavity ( @xmath120 in fig .",
    "4a ) . but for the input atomic state @xmath122 , the maximum squeezing have two valley . as to the split of the squeezing spectrum",
    ", we can understand it from initial atomic state .",
    "the initial population in @xmath123 ( @xmath124 ) for the two modes are not yet equal .",
    "then , the fluctuation the @xmath125 ( @xmath126 ) and @xmath127 ( @xmath128 ) can be different so that the squeezing spectrum of the product of the fluctuation change from one degeneracy valley into two maximum squeezing .",
    "the split of the squeezing spectrum from one valley into two minima also have been shown in the case of asymmetric loss for each mode , i.e. , @xmath129 @xcite .",
    "our group had revealed the similar split resulting from asymmetric detuning and asymmetric atomic initial state @xcite .    during above numerical simulation , we choose parameters of the system based on recent experiment for optomechanical system @xcite , also considering the parameters used in theoretical papers genes , huangshumei . as to the coupling between the atoms and the cavity , we use @xmath130 ( in fig.4 ) .",
    "comparing with recent experiment @xmath131 @xcite , the coupling is much more weak .",
    "moreover , the ratio @xmath132 is only @xmath133 , see fig.4 , which can be realized in recent experiment technique @xcite .",
    "we proposed a scheme via three - level cascade atom to entangle two - mode fields as well as optomechanical oscillator .",
    "our study show that intracavity fields and two movable mirrors are entangled respectively for realizable coupling between the cavity fields and the atoms .",
    "the output two - mode fields entanglement is affected by the frequency of the mirror motion , the larger frequency of the mirror , the larger entanglement of the output fields . because the entanglement is resulted from the atomic coherence , the initial atomic state play important role on the output entanglement of the two - mode fields . for the best coherence of the initial atomic state",
    ", the output spectrum appears one deep squeezing while for other initial atomic state , the one deep squeezing split into two deep squeezing .",
