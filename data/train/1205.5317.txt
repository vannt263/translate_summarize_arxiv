    "in 1998 , the cdf collaboration observed the pseudoscalar @xmath8 mesons through the semileptonic decays @xmath9 and @xmath10 in @xmath11 collisions at the energy @xmath12 at the fermilab tevatron @xcite .",
    "the bottom - charm quarkonium states @xmath0 are of special interesting , the ground states and the excited states lying below the @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 thresholds can not annihilate into gluons , and therefore are more stable than the corresponding heavy quarkonium states consist of the same flavor , and would have widths less than a hundred @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the semileptonic decays @xmath18 , @xmath19 were used to measure the @xmath0 lifetime @xcite , which is about a third as long as that of the @xmath20 and @xmath21 mesons as both the @xmath22 and @xmath23 quarks decay weakly . in 2007 ,",
    "the cdf collaboration observed the @xmath24 mesons with an significance exceeds @xmath25 through the decays @xmath26 in @xmath11 collisions at the energy @xmath27 , and obtained the value @xmath28 @xcite . in 2008 ,",
    "the d0 collaboration reconstructed the decay modes @xmath26 and observed the @xmath24 mesons with an significance larger than @xmath29 , and obtained the value @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "now the average value is @xmath31 from the particle data group @xcite .",
    "recently , the lhcb collaboration observed the decay @xmath32 for the first time using @xmath33 of the @xmath34 collisions at @xmath35 , the measured ratio of branching fractions is @xmath36 where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic @xcite .",
    "the hadronic decays @xmath37 take place through the weak @xmath22-quark decays @xmath38 , which are analogous with the @xmath39-lepton decays @xmath40 .",
    "we can use the existing experimental data on the @xmath39-lepton decays to obtain reliable prediction for the @xmath41 branching fraction with the method of spectral functions , @xmath42 where the @xmath43 is the lorentz - invariant three - body phase factor , the @xmath44 is the effective polarization vector of the virtual @xmath45-boson , the spectral functions @xmath46 and @xmath47 are universal and can be determined by theoretical and experimental analysis of the @xmath48 decays @xcite .",
    "the spectral function @xmath47 is negligible according to conservation of vector current and partial conservation of axial - vector current .",
    "the explicit expression of the spectral function @xmath46 can be fitted to the experimental data or calculated by some phenomenological models , the spectral function @xmath46 is always saturated by exchange of the intermediate axial - vector meson @xmath3 with an special ansatz for the vertexes @xmath49 and @xmath50 based on some phenomenological quark models @xcite . in this article , we intend to study the decays @xmath32 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 with the phenomenological lagrangians , and calculate the feynman diagrams directly .",
    "the decays @xmath54 , @xmath55 have not been observed yet , but they are expected to be observed in the future at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "the @xmath0 decays will be studied and their branching fractions will be determined in the lhcb experiments .    in ref.@xcite , lichard and juran",
    "perform detailed analysis of the vertex @xmath56 with the following lagrangian , @xmath57 -sin\\theta\\left[(\\partial^\\mu \\rho^{0\\nu}-\\partial^\\nu \\rho^{0\\mu})\\partial_\\mu a_\\nu^{- } \\pi^{+}\\right]+\\cdots \\right\\ } \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] considering the decays @xmath58 , where the momenta of the @xmath59 and @xmath60 mesons in center - of - mass frame of the initial @xmath3 meson are about @xmath61 .",
    "such a lagrangian maybe lead to amplified amplitude for the decay @xmath1 as the sub - amplitude @xmath62 can be accounted as @xmath63 or @xmath64 , where the momenta @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 are large , we have to introduce form - factors to parameterize the off - shell effects . in the decays",
    "@xmath68 and @xmath69 , the momenta of the @xmath3 meson in center - of - mass frame of the initial particles are about @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "on the other hand , we know that the decays @xmath58 are @xmath72-wave dominated @xcite , we prefer the simple lagrangian , @xmath73 in this article .",
    "furthermore , we use the lagrangian , @xmath74 to study the vertex @xmath50 @xcite .",
