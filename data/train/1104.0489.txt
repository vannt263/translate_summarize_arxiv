    "in this paper we study three kinds of functionals for a one - parameter family of infinitely long double helices with straight axes that have radius @xmath2 and _ slope _ @xmath3 , i.e. _ pitch _ @xmath4 :",

    "the first functional is the `` _ average ropelength _ '' which is the smallest length of a rope with unit thickness which is needed to make one twist of the double helix .",
    "it is a dual notion of _ thickness_@xcite which is the radius of the `` fattest tube '' around a curve , or equivalently , the minimum _ global radius of curvature_@xcite . to be precise",
    ", the thickness of a curve @xmath6 , which we denote by @xmath7 , is given by the supremum of the radii @xmath8 so that a tubular @xmath9-neighbourhood of @xmath6 ( denoted by @xmath10 ) can be embedded , i.e. the supremum of @xmath8 so that the normal discs to @xmath6 of radius @xmath9 at distinct points never intersect @xcite .",
    "the _ ropelength _ is the ratio of the length @xmath11 of @xmath6 and the thickness @xmath7@xcite .",
    "a knot that minimizes the ropelength in its isotopy class is called an _ ideal knot _ after stasiak . in other words ,",
    "an ideal knot is a knot whose fattest tubular neighbourhood maximizes a scale invariant functional on the space of knots defined by @xmath12 in its isotopy class .",
    "the ideal double helix was computed by sylwester przybyl and piotr pieraski@xcite .",
    "the second is the `` _ packing proportion _ '' , in other words , the ratio of the volume of the fattest tubes and that of the circumscribed cylinder of the tubes ( figure [ 0635805_cylinder ] ) .",
    "the best volume packing double helix was computed by kasper olsen and jakob bohr@xcite .",
    "the last is an `` _ average mutual energy _ '' , which is a central topic of the paper . an _ energy of knots _ is a functional on the space of knots which was introduced to produce a representative embedding for each isotopy class as an energy minimizer in the isotopy class .",
    "the first example was obtained as the renormalization of @xmath13-modified potential energy of knots@xcite .",
    "this energy is sometimes called the _ mbius energy _ because it is invariant under mbius transformations of the ambient space , but in fact , there are many other energies which are also invariant under mbius transformations@xcite .",
    "the energy blows up if a knot degenerates to a singular knot with double points .",
    "therefore a knot can be deformed to decrease its energy without having self - crossing , and hence one can expect that the isotopy class would be kept the same during the deformation .",
    "many kinds of energies have been studied intensively for about twenty years , forming a branch of mathematics called `` physical knot theory '' . in this paper",
    "we use two one parameter families of energies for @xmath14 , @xmath15 where @xmath9 denotes the distance @xmath16 between a pair of points .",
    "namely , we consider the integration of modified coulomb s potential and the screened coulomb s potential ( yukawa potential ) . as both diverges because of non - compactness of the domain of integration , we take the `` average per one twist '' , in other words , we consider the integration on @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is a subarc of @xmath19 that winds up just once around the axis . as we only consider the interaction between two strands @xmath19 and @xmath20 , the energies are well - defined without renormalization .",
    "we compute the slopes that minimize the above energies and see how they depend on the parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "we will compare our numerical results with experimental data of dna reported by stasiak and maddocks .",
    "we remark that our strategy of looking for optima double helices with respect to one of the three kinds of functionals above mentioned does not work for single helices .",
    "in fact , our functionals are all optimized when the slope @xmath23 goes to @xmath24 , i.e. when the curve approaches a straight line .",
    "let @xmath6 be a curve .",
    "let @xmath25 be the distance function : @xmath26 .",
    "the _ doubly critical self distance _ of @xmath6@xcite , denoted by @xmath27 , is the smallest positive critical value of @xmath28 , i.e. @xmath29 where @xmath30 denotes the tangent vector to @xmath6 at @xmath31 .",
    "then the thickness of a knot @xmath6 is given by @xcite @xmath32 remark that , for a fixed point @xmath33 , the radius of curvature at @xmath33 is a local quantity whereas @xmath34 is a global quantity .",
    "we remark that , in the case of a _ single _ helix with slope @xmath23 , maritan , micheletti , trovato , and banavar@xcite showed that there is a critical slope @xmath35 such that the thickness is given by the half of the doubly critical self distance if @xmath36 and by the minimum radius of curvature if @xmath37 .",
    "let @xmath38 be the length of @xmath39 per one twist .",
    "it is equal to @xmath40 .",
    "define the _ average ropelength _ of a double helix @xmath39 with slope @xmath23 , denoted by @xmath41 , by @xmath42 where @xmath43 denotes the thickness of @xmath39 .",
    "let us compute the slope @xmath23 of an _ ideal double helix _",
    ", i.e. the slope @xmath23 that attains the minimum average ropelength .",
    "the thickness @xmath43 of @xmath39 is given as follows .",
    "the radius of curvature is constantly equal to @xmath44 . on the other hand ,",
    "the doubly critical self distance is equal to the distance between a point @xmath45 and @xmath20 .",
    "the latter is given by @xmath46 if @xmath47 and by @xmath48 where",
    "@xmath49 @xmath50 is given by @xmath51 if @xmath52 .",
    "therefore , by , the thickness is given by the half of the doubly critical self distance for any @xmath23 : @xmath53 \\frac12\\sqrt{2 + 2\\cos\\theta_0+a^2{\\theta_0}^2}\\>,&\\ > ( 0<\\theta_0<\\pi , \\sin\\theta_0=a^2\\theta_0 ) & \\>\\>(0<a<1 ) . \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ]    when @xmath47 we have @xmath54 which takes the minimum value @xmath55 at @xmath56 .",
    "the numerical computation using maple implies that the average ropelength takes the minimum which is approximately equal to @xmath57 at @xmath58 ( figure [ av_t_g_c2 ] ) , when the thickness @xmath59 is @xmath60 and the ratio of the pitch and the thickness is @xmath61 .",
    "0.2 cm        the above result is not new : this double helix with a straight axis that is optimal with respect to the ropelength ( figure [ 082074_wogrid ] ) had already been reported by pieranski@xcite , fig .",
    "12 ( b ) .",
    "the equation implies that the closest point in @xmath20 from a point in @xmath19 can be found in the opposite side when @xmath47 and in an upward ( or downward ) direction when @xmath52 .",
    "it means that the curve of the contact of two fattest tubes around @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the straight axis when @xmath47 i.e. when the ratio of pitch and thickness satisfies @xmath62 , and a helix between @xmath19 and @xmath20 when @xmath63 i.e. when @xmath64 , as was explained by stasiak and maddocks@xcite .",
    "next we compute the slope of `` best packed '' tubular double helix , namely , a double helix that maximizes the ratio of the volume of the fattest tubular neighbourhood and the volume of the circumscribed cylinder of the tubes ( figure [ 0635805_cylinder ] ) .",
