    "supersymmetry is an important ingredient of modern high energy physics beyond the standard model ; since boson masses are protected by supersymmetry in such theories with chiral fermions , it helps to reduce the hierarchy and fine - tuning problems drastically , and within grand unified theories , it leads to predictions of the proton life - time in agreement with present day experimental bounds .",
    "as low energy physics is manifestly not supersymmetric , this symmetry has to be broken at some energy scale .",
    "however , non - renormalization theorems in four dimensions ensure that tree level supersymmetric theories preserve supersymmetry at any finite order of perturbation theory ; therefore , supersymmetry has to be broken non - perturbatively  @xcite .",
    "the lattice formulation of quantum field theories provides a systematic tool to investigate non - perturbative problems . in the case of supersymmetric field theories ,",
    "their formulation is hampered by the fact that the supersymmetry algebra closes on the generator of infinitesimal translations  @xcite . since poincar symmetry",
    "is explicitly broken by the discretization , one is tempted to modify the supersymmetry algebra so as to close on discrete translations . however , as lattice derivatives do not satisfy the leibniz rule , supersymmetric actions for interacting theories will in general not be invariant under such lattice supersymmetries .",
    "the violation of the leibniz rule is an @xmath2 effect , and supersymmetry naively will therefore be restored in the continuum limit . in the case of poincar symmetry ,",
    "the discrete remnants of the symmetry on the lattice are sufficient to prohibit the appearance of relevant operators in the effective action which are invariant only under a subset of the poincar group and require fine tuning of their coefficients in order to arrive at an invariant continuum limit . in generic lattice formulations , there are no discrete remnants of supersymmetry transformations on the lattice ; in such theories , supersymmetry in the continuum limit can only be achieved by appropriately fine - tuning the bare couplings of all supersymmetry - breaking counterterms  @xcite .",
    "an additional complication in the formulation of supersymmetric theories on the lattice is the fermion doubling problem .",
    "local and translationally invariant hermitean dirac operators on the lattice automatically describe fermions of both chiralities  @xcite ; the fermionic extra degrees of freedom are usually not paired with bosonic modes and so lead to supersymmetry breaking .",
    "generic prescriptions eliminating these extra fermionic modes also break supersymmetry .    as a simple supersymmetric theory ,",
    "the wess - zumino model in two dimensions has been the subject of intensive analytic and numerical investigations .",
    "early attempts included the choice of the nonlocal slac derivative ( thereby avoiding the doubling problem ) in the @xmath3 version of this model  @xcite .",
    "this was motivated by the idea that the fourier transform of the lattice theory should coincide with that of the continuum theory . a hamiltonian approach where the slac derivative minimizes supersymmetry - breaking artifacts introduced by non - antisymmetric lattice derivatives was discussed in  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , a local action with wilson fermions was constructed at the cost of a nonlocal supersymmetry variation  @xcite ; supersymmetry with ginsparg - wilson fermions , lattice chiral symmetry is incompatible with yukawa couplings  @xcite ; however , the theory can be regularized by supersymmetric higher derivative corrections , which leads to a supersymmetric continuum limit within perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "it could be shown that supersymmetric ward identities are satisfied up to order @xmath4 in the coupling constant  @xcite . ]",
    "simulations of this model  @xcite indicate that this theory with a cubic superpotential indeed features non - perturbative supersymmetry breaking .    in order to manifestly preserve some subalgebra of the @xmath3 supersymmetry algebra on the lattice",
    ", the above discussion suggests to choose a subalgebra independent of the momentum operator .",
    "thus , supercharges @xmath5 and @xmath6 can be defined using ( non)local derivatives on a spatial lattice .",
    "the choice of a continuous time then allows for a hamiltonian defined by @xmath7 which commutes with the supercharges  @xcite and automatically contains a wilson term .",
    "this strategy can be generalized to the @xmath0 model on a spatial lattice ; an analysis shows that a subalgebra admitting an @xmath8 r - symmetry can be preserved  @xcite .",
    "simulations for the @xmath3 ( see  @xcite ) and the @xmath0 model  @xcite have been done using the local hamiltonian monte - carlo methods .",
    "further simulations based on the green function monte - carlo method for @xmath3 indicate that supersymmetry is unbroken for a quartic superpotential and has a broken and an unbroken phase for cubic superpotentials  @xcite .    with a discrete time - coordinate , one has to resort to action- rather than hamiltonian - based approaches .",
    "the perfect action approach was pursued for the free @xmath3 theory in  @xcite ; a generalization for interacting theories seems however problematic .",
    "a treatment of the @xmath0 wess - zumino model in the dirac - khler formalism preserves a scalar supersymmetry on the lattice but leads to non - conjugate transformations of the complex scalar field and its conjugate .",
    "this enlarges the space of states and presumably renders the theory non - unitary  @xcite .",
    "a related  @xcite idea avoiding these problems goes back to the idea of nicolai  @xcite that ( in this case ) scalar supersymmetric field theories admit new bosonic variables with a jacobian cancelling the determinant from integrating out the fermions , in terms of which the bosonic action is purely gaussian . in general , the new variables are complicated nonlocal functions of the original ones ; for @xmath0 supersymmetry , however , local nicolai variables can be expected  @xcite . starting from a discretized form of the nicolai variables found in the continuum ,",
    "one simply defines the bosonic part of the action as the sum over squares of the nicolai variables ; the fermionic part of the action is adjusted so that the determinant of the fermion matrix still cancels the jacobian .",
    "this leads to an action manifestly preserving part of the continuum supersymmetry on the lattice , and which contains improvement terms in addition to the naive latticization of the continuum action  @xcite .",
    "as stated in  @xcite , the breaking of some of the continuum supersymmetries can in this framework be traced back to the fact that the improvement terms are not compatible with reflection positivity .",
    "however , the violation of osterwalder - schrader positivity is an @xmath9 effect and thus should be negligible at least at weak coupling  @xcite .",
    "an analysis of the perturbation series shows that these terms in an off - shell formulation of the theory with a cubic superpotential and wilson fermions lead to tadpole diagrams which diverge linearly in the continuum limit  @xcite . a cancellation between these would - be central charge terms and the naive discretization of the continuum hamiltonian",
    "has been suggested as a solution for the conundrum raised in  @xcite that the lattice result of the number of zero - modes of the dirac operator seems to differ vastly from the continuum answer  @xcite .    the possibility to introduce nicolai variables",
    "is closely related to the fact that the @xmath10 wess - zumino model is a topological theory of witten type , i.e. , the action is of the form @xmath11 for a scalar supercharge @xmath12 , once auxiliary fields are introduced  @xcite",
    ". this formulation manifestly preserves @xmath12-supersymmetry on the lattice and therefore guarantees that the theory remains supersymmetric in the limit of vanishing lattice spacing .",
    "lattice theories of this type in various dimensions and with different degrees of supersymmetry have been classified in  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that in this formulation some remnant of the @xmath13 r - symmetry which is left unbroken by the superpotential at the classical level but broken by the wilson terms is restored in the continuum limit even non - perturbatively  @xcite ; this also indicates that at least for the cubic superpotential under consideration supersymmetry is not broken nonperturbatively .    at a fixed point in space",
    ", the wess - zumino model reduces to supersymmetric quantum mechanics .",
    "a naive discretization of the action with a wilson term for just the fermion leads to differing masses for fermions and bosons in the continuum limit  @xcite .",
    "this can be traced back  @xcite to 1-loop contributions ( of uv degree 0 ) of the fermion doublers to the boson propagator which have to be cancelled by an appropriate counterterm that was neglected in  @xcite .",
    "as soon as the action is amended by a wilson term also for the boson  @xcite , an additional diagram involving the boson doublers cancels the finite correction of the fermion doublers , and no counterterms are required to achieve the desired continuum limit . in this case ,",
    "fermion and boson masses agree in the limit of vanishing lattice spacing , and supersymmetric ward identities are fulfilled to great accuracy .",
    "as expected for a theory with @xmath0 supersymmetry , supersymmetric quantum mechanics can be formulated in terms of local nicolai variables  @xcite . however",
    ", this action differs from the amended form of  @xcite by a further interaction term which becomes an integral over a total derivative in the continuum limit .    in this paper , we scrutinize six different lattice actions for supersymmetric quantum mechanics based on wilson and slac fermions with and without such improvement terms .",
    "the three models without improvement terms are not manifestly supersymmetric in the presence of interactions and differ by bosonic terms which become irrelevant in the continuum limit as well as by the choice of the lattice derivative ; the other three models with manifest supersymmetry differ in the prescription for the evaluation of the improvement term and also in the choice of the lattice derivative  they can be constructed from three different nicolai variables . we compare the effective masses for interacting theories with a quartic superpotential and analyze the ward identities of the broken and unbroken supersymmetries at various lattice sizes and couplings .",
    "the central observation here is that the manifestly supersymmetric theory with the so - called stratonovich prescription  @xcite for the evaluation of the improvement term ( which is the discretization of a continuum surface integral ) leads to far better results than the model with an ito prescription at finite lattice spacing . the mass extraction for the models with slac derivative is at first sight hampered by an oscillating behavior for nearby insertions in the bosonic and fermionic two - point functions ; however , this gibbs phenomenon is under good analytical control and can be softened by the application of an appropriate filter . with the help of this `` optimal filter '' , the results even surpass those of the model with stratonovich prescription .    along the way",
    ", we show for which superpotentials and derivatives one can guarantee positivity of the fermion determinants . in those cases where",
    "the determinant can be computed exactly , we analyze under which circumstances they converge to the correct continuum results ; these exact results are crucial for our simulations .",
    "again , the model with stratonovich prescription is ahead of the one with ito prescription ; the former leads to a determinant with the correct continuum limit , whereas the latter differs from it by a factor which depends on the superpotential .",
    "furthermore , we study three different manifestly supersymmetric discretizations of the @xmath14 wess - zumino model in two dimensions . instead of trying to generalize the stratonovich prescription to two dimensions ,",
    "we introduce a non - standard wilson term ( corresponding to an imaginary wilson parameter in the holomorphic superpotential ) in such a way that the discretization errors for the eigenvalues of the free ( bosonic and fermionic ) kinetic operators are only of order @xmath1 instead of order @xmath2 for the standard wilson term . in the simulations",
    ", we study the effect of the resulting violation of reflection positivity and compare the results with those of the model with slac fermions . due to calculational constraints",
    ", we have to restrict the computations to smaller and intermediate values of the coupling .    as a theoretical background ,",
    "we show that the discretized wess - zumino model in two dimensions with the slac derivative has a renormalizable continuum limit .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : two ] , we introduce the quantum mechanical models on the lattice , with and without improvement terms , and discuss which behavior of the interacting theories at finite lattice spacings can be gathered from their ( non-)invariance under supersymmetry transformations in the free case . in subsection",
    "[ sec : deter ] , we give details about the positivity of the fermion determinants and derive their respective continuum limits .",
    "the results of the effective masses and the ward identities can be found in section  [ sec : simulqm ] . in section",
    "[ sec : wztwodim ] , we discuss the discretizations of the @xmath0 wess - zumino model in two dimensions and present the results of the mass extractions . section  [ sec : four ] covers the algorithmic aspects of our simulations including a derivation of the gibbs phenomenon for the slac correlators which justifies the application of the filter for the mass extraction in the quantum mechanical model .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : three ] contains the proof that the wess - zumino model on the lattice with the slac derivative is renormalizable to first order in perturbation theory ; a technical part of this proof is completed in appendix  [ sec : appa ] .",
    "in this section we introduce the action for supersymmetric quantum mechanics in a language which can be easily generalized later on to the two - dimensional euclidean wess - zumino model . in subsections [ sec : unimproved ] and",
    "[ sec : detail2 ] we present six different lattice versions of the continuum theory with euclidean action @xmath15 the continuum model is invariant under two supersymmetry transformations , @xmath16 with anticommuting parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the lattice approximations considered below differ by the choice of the lattice derivative and/or the discretization prescription for a continuum surface term ; in subsection  [ sec : deter ] we argue why three of them lead to far better approximations to the continuum theory .",
    "the results of our simulations for a quartic superpotential @xmath19 ( with positive @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) are discussed in section  [ sec : simulqm ] .",

    "( i ) naive lattice model with wilson fermions _ + the most naive discretization is given by the action  ( [ naiveaction ] ) with an additional wilson term shifting the derivative @xmath35 as explained in  ( [ latder9 ] ) , i.e. , @xmath49 the wilson term removes fermionic as well as bosonic doublers .",
    "this action has no supersymmetries at all , and bosonic and fermionic excitations have different masses in the continuum limit in the presence of interactions .",
    "even the free model has no exact supersymmetry ; this can be traced back to the fact that the derivative @xmath42 is not antisymmetric . + _",
    "( ii ) naive lattice model with shifted superpotential _ + an alternative way to remove the fermion doublers employed by golterman and petcher and later catterall and gregory  @xcite is to use the ( unshifted ) antisymmetric matrix @xmath31 and add a wilson term to the superpotential , @xmath50 it should be noted that ( as compared to ( [ model1 ] ) ) only the bosonic terms are changed .",
    "this model is only supersymmetric without interaction , i.e , for @xmath51 . in the interacting case",
    "all susy ward identities are violated .",
    "the breaking is equally strong for both supersymmetries . + _",
    "( iii ) naive lattice model with slac derivative _ + naively , one might expect the supersymmetry breaking effect in the naive lattice action ( [ naiveaction ] ) with slac derivative ( [ latder3 ] ) to be of the same magnitude as with backward derivative @xmath42 .",
    "surprisingly enough , this is not so ; it will turn out that the mass extraction from the model @xmath52 is about as good as for the improved actions considered below .",
    "this is again related to the fact that the derivative is antisymmetric such that the free model with slac derivative admits both supersymmetries ( in contrast to the model with backward derivative ) .      in order to preserve one of the two lattice supersymmetries in ( [ lsqm13 ] ) for interacting theories",
    "the naive discretization ( [ naiveaction ] ) should be amended by extra terms which turn into surface terms in the continuum limit and reinstall part of the continuum supersymmetry on the lattice .",
    "such invariant lattice models may be constructed with the help of a nicolai map @xmath53 of the bosonic variables . in terms of the nicolai variables @xmath54 the improved lattice actions take the simple form @xmath55 this is a discretization of the most general supersymmetric action in terms of a real bosonic variable and two real gramann variables on the circle  @xcite .",

    "we will see that compared to the fermion determinant involving continuum derivatives , the continuum limit of the fermion determinant for the ito prescription is off by a factor depending on the superpotential whereas the stratonovich prescription reproduces exactly the desired continuum result .    since  ( [ model5 ] ) was constructed from  ( [ impact1 ] ) in terms of nicolai variables , it is manifestly supersymmetric under @xmath60 as given in  ( [ impact3 ] ) .",
    "the discretization of the second supersymmetry is in general not preserved on the lattice , not even in the free case .",
    "this latter fact suggests a modification of @xmath77 in  ( [ impact9 ] ) to @xmath78 this changes effectively the backward- into a forward - derivative , and the derivative of the superpotential is evaluated now at @xmath79 . with these definitions , @xmath62 is a symmetry of the action  ( [ model5 ] ) in the absence of interactions .",

    "in this section we briefly outline the methods and algorithms we have used in our simulations .",
    "in particular we have modified the treatment of the fermion determinant in the well known hybrid monte carlo algorithm ( hmc )  @xcite .",
    "although due to the low dimensionality of the models under consideration the numerical studies to be carried out are much less demanding than , e.g. , four - dimensional lattice qcd we have to face similar problems with respect to the treatment of the fermion fields . however , the computational tasks at hand allow for strategies which are more accurate and easier to implement than what is widely used there .",
    "since our models do not contain any gauge degrees of freedom , the resulting dirac operators have a rather simple form , a fact which can be put to practical use as will be shown below .",
    "nonetheless , the mere presence of the fermion determinant in the partition function introduces a nonlocality which has to be taken into account in the monte carlo algorithm .",
    "we thus decided to base our numerical simulations on the hmc which allows for a simultaneous update of all bosonic field variables .",
    "for the quantum mechanical models discussed in section [ sec : two ] substantial improvements can be achieved if it is possible to compute the fermion determinant in closed form .",
    "for the two - dimensional models , however , comparable results are not available , and these theories are plagued by a strongly fluctuating fermion determinant .",
    "even worse , the fermion determinant may take on positive and negative values which drives the simulations directly into the so - called sign problem . to proceed we will therefore treat the quantum mechanical models again separately from the two - dimensional models and discuss them one at a time .",
    "our setup for the bosonic degrees of freedom for the hmc does not differ from the standard procedure and is formulated on an enlarged phase space involving the real bosonic field @xmath23 and an additional conjugate momentum field @xmath164 . as usual these fields are propagated along the molecular dynamics trajectory by hamilton s equations @xmath165 where @xmath166.\\ ] ] since on the lattice the fermions are already integrated out the expression to be used in eq .",

    "hence it would be clearly favorable to take the fermion determinant exactly into account .",
    "while a direct computation of the fermion determinant at each step of a trajectory is also feasible in these one - dimensional theories one can do even better due to the simple structure of the dirac operator . despite their differences in the bosonic part of the action the models involving an antisymmetric derivative matrix and a wilson term , namely the models _",

    "a similar expression for the stratonovich prescription as given in  ( [ det11 ] ) also allows for a quick computation of the fermion determinant in model  _",

    "] obviously , we can not avoid an inversion of @xmath178 $ ] in order to update all sites .",
    "finally let us briefly mention some details of our simulation runs .",
    "since the physical value of @xmath20 as well as the physical volume of the box @xmath179 were kept fixed at @xmath180 , the lattice spacing @xmath29 was varied with the number of points @xmath32 in the lattice .",
    "the lattice sizes we have considered range from @xmath181 to @xmath182 corresponding to @xmath183 .",
    "we have checked that the measurements were insensitive to finite size effects . for all lattice sizes we generated between @xmath184 and @xmath185 independent configurations for the mass extraction ; in order to improve the signal to noise ratio for the ward identities , @xmath186 independent configurations were used ( with @xmath187 independent runs in order to minimize statistical errors ) .",
    "for the two - dimensional models , the fermion determinant is not positive definite , in contrast to the situation in one dimension .",
    "indeed a numerical experiment shows that the determinant has large fluctuations at strong coupling and changes its sign if @xmath188 is larger than a certain threshold value of order @xmath189 .",
    "this value depends on the lattice spacing ( and on @xmath20 )",
    ". a closer look at the spectrum of the fermion matrix reveals a second related problem , namely the existence of very small eigenvalues .",
    "they increase the condition number of the fermion matrix by several orders of magnitude and prevent a straightforward application of the pseudofermion method .",
    "in addition , the bosonic potential @xmath190 possesses two separate minima ; this might lead to complications with respect to ergodicity .",
    "in order to check at which values of the coupling the standard hmc breaks down , we have performed simulations in the weakly coupled regime where the aforementioned contributions from the fermionic fluctuations can be taken into account via reweighting quenched ensembles .",
    "an added advantage is that with this approach , field generations can be generated very quickly ; on the other hand , larger ensembles are used since reweighting requires higher statistics .    .",
    "the stronger pronounced the peak the better the statistical errors are under control .",
    "the failure of the reweighting technique is visible for @xmath191 .",
    "the plotted data was generated from @xmath192 configurations for the model _",
    "( iii ) _ on a @xmath193 square lattice . ]     for the quenched and full theory at @xmath194 for the model with standard wilson term _",
    "( i ) _ on a @xmath195 lattice .",
    "similar results hold for the other models as well . ]",
    "trial runs indicate that for the volumes considered the reweighting method should work for @xmath196 .",
    "figure  [ fig : reweight_comparison_fermdet ] shows that for these moderate couplings the fluctuations of the fermion determinant are within two orders of magnitude . for @xmath197 the fluctuations span more than ten orders of magnitude and the number of relevant configurations becomes ridiculously small .",
    "as pointed out in section  [ sec : wzmasswint ] , for @xmath194 the perturbation of the mass is about 0.3% , an effect which is clearly not visible in our simulations .",
    "however , we can compare quenched with reweighted expectation values and check whether they are sensitive to the inclusion of dynamical fermions at all .",
    "we have found that even in this weakly coupled regime the effective masses of bosonic and fermionic superpartners coincide only if the fermion determinant is properly taken into account .",
    "otherwise , the two - point functions ( and hence the masses ) deviate considerably from their values in the full theory , as can bee seen in figure  [ fig : twopoint_comparison ] .",
    "clearly , in order to simulate at larger couplings an improved algorithm is needed .",
    "for example , a comparison with the results in  @xcite would require a ratio of @xmath198 , which obviously is not feasible with the reweighting method used in this paper .",
    "in this subsection we expand on the extraction of effective masses in our quantum mechanical models .",
    "they are determined by the asymptotic behavior of the ( bosonic or fermionic ) two - point functions @xmath199 : for @xmath200 far away from the midpoint @xmath201 of the lattice , the asymptotic expression for the bosonic two - point function is dominated by a single mass state with @xmath202 , and as a symmetric function it is proportional to @xmath203 ; the fermionic two - point function as a superposition of symmetric and antisymmetric parts ( w.r.t .",
    "the midpoint )  @xcite is for small @xmath200 proportional to @xmath204 .",
    "thus , the masses can be extracted by exponential fits from the corresponding simulation data @xmath205 the @xmath200-region for the fit should be chosen in such a way that    * the contribution of higher energy states with @xmath206 in the asymptotic expression @xmath207 is negligible , * the effect of the improvement terms , which violate reflection positivity ( i.e. , the @xmath208 are not necessarily positive ) and therefore damp the two - point function for small values of @xmath200 below the continuum value , better not influence the result , * the errors ( which are larger for smaller values of the two - point function ) should be minimized , * and in the case of bosons , the influence from the second exponential tail in @xmath209 should not interfere with the exponential fit to the first .",
    "thus , we are supposed to choose a region for @xmath200 in between the left boundary ( @xmath210 by ( i ) and ( ii ) ) and the midpoint ( @xmath211 by ( iii ) and ( iv ) ) .",
    "this works reasonably well for wilson fermions ( the results are presented in section  [ sec : qmmasses ] ) , but for slac fermions , we observe an oscillating behavior of the two - point functions near the boundaries which requires a more careful investigation .    in order to understand the nature of this phenomenon",
    ", we compute the propagator of a free massive fermion in the continuum , @xmath212 where the sum runs over the nonzero part of the spectrum of the differential operator @xmath213 , and @xmath214 are the eigenfunctions of @xmath213 with eigenvalue @xmath82 . if we impose periodic boundary conditions with @xmath215 , we have @xmath216 with @xmath217 for all integer @xmath161 .",
    "inserting this into  ( [ slactwop1 ] ) , we obtain @xmath218 for the two - point function on the circle .",
    "if we discretize the circle ( and so introduce a momentum cutoff ) , the sum in ( [ slactwop3 ] ) is truncated to a finite number of terms and reduces just to the propagator of the slac derivative .",

    "this can be improved by a filter which increases the convergence rate  @xmath223 or even recovers the exponential approximation of a continuous function . for our computations ,",

    ", it extends the range from which one can extract the masses nearly up to the midpoint of the lattice .",
    "the rather large deviations from the unfiltered data beyond that point are irrelevant for our purposes .",

    "kartens and smit have demonstrated in  @xcite that the slac derivative induces a nonrenormalizable one - loop diagram in four - dimensional quantum electrodynamics on the lattice .",
    "therefore , theories involving the slac derivative were generally believed to be nonrenormalizable .",
    "but it can be shown that the two - dimensional @xmath0 wess - zumino model is in fact renormalizable at least to one - loop order . model . ]    as usual the calculations of lattice perturbation theory are carried out in the thermodynamic limit where the number of lattice points tends to infinity and the lattice momentum becomes continuous . in momentum space the finite lattice spacing  @xmath29",
    "is translated into a finite cutoff @xmath231 .",
    "it has to be shown that the diagrams can be renormalized when this cutoff is removed .",
    "the bphz renormalization scheme is used to prove that the renormalized integrals tend towards their continuum counterparts , and the counterterms can be identified with similar quantities of continuum perturbation theory . the argumentation employed here",
    "is closely related to the renormalization theorem of reisz @xcite .",
    "this theorem does however not apply in its original form because the integrands are not smooth functions of the loop momentum .    in the following",
    ", we will determine an upper bound for the boson propagator in momentum space which will be used later on to argue that parts of the integrals in lattice perturbation theory are going to vanish in the continuum limit .",
    "for the slac derivative , the momentum space representation of the propagators @xmath232 for bosons and fermions contains the saw tooth function @xmath233 the momentum integration is always restricted to the first brillouin zone , @xmath234 .",
    "the internal lines in the one - loop diagrams carry either the internal momentum @xmath161 or a sum @xmath235 of internal and external momenta where @xmath236 denotes a linear combination of the external momenta ( using momentum conservation , there are @xmath237 such linear combinations @xmath238 in a diagram with @xmath221 vertices ) .",
    "integrations over loop momenta @xmath239 can be split into integrations over a square @xmath240 for an arbitrary @xmath241 and the rest of the brillouin zone , @xmath242 .",
    "we will argue below that the integral over @xmath243 converges to the continuum value of the integral whereas the integral over @xmath242 is shown to vanish as @xmath29 goes to zero .",
    "namely , for a given set of external momenta @xmath244 , one may choose @xmath245 with @xmath246 small enough such that @xmath247 .",
    "for @xmath248 , we can then read off from @xmath249 that @xmath250 with @xmath251 , i.e. , @xmath252 is also inside the first brillouin zone . on the other hand , if @xmath253 , @xmath254 for such lattice spacings @xmath29 . the latter inequality may be used in order to find an upper bound for the propagator , @xmath255 with @xmath256 .    it can be easily seen that in the wess - zumino model , only two different types of integrals contribute at one - loop level .",
    "a typical integral of the first type is @xmath257 here , we have applied  ( [ eq : estimates2 ] ) in order to find an upper bound for the integrand in @xmath258 and then enlarged the integration domain to a full disk including the first brillouin zone .",
    "thus , @xmath258 vanishes in the continuum limit if @xmath259 .",
    "therefore , the integral @xmath260 tends to the continuum value of the integral as @xmath29 goes to zero ( and the corresponding continuum integral is convergent by power counting ) , so as long as we are considering diagrams with more than one vertex , this type of integrals does not spoil renormalizability .",
    "another class of integrals is @xmath261 the @xmath262 are taken from the @xmath238 , so @xmath263 . the same arguments as above show that the continuum limit is correct for any @xmath264 ( again , all continuum integrals are convergent by power counting ) .",
    "therefore , renormalizability only remains to be shown for two kinds of integrals .",
    "the first consists of diagrams with @xmath265 , e.g. , tadpole diagrams . in this case , the loop momentum is independent of the ( vanishing ) exterior momentum so that the argument of @xmath266 is restricted to the first brillouin zone ( where @xmath267 ) .",
    "the boundary of the integration region behaves as a finite cutoff that is removed in the continuum limit so that the integral approaches its continuum counterpart . in the bphz renormalization scheme",
    "these diagrams are just subtracted and do not contribute to the renormalized quantities .    the second kind of integrals ( with @xmath268 and @xmath269 in ( [ eq : fermiongeneral ] ) ) requires a more careful investigation which may be found in appendix  [ sec : appa ] .",
    "this demontrates that lattice discretizations of the two - dimensional @xmath0 wess - zumino model based on the slac derivative are renormalizable at first order in perturbation theory and yield the correct continuum limit .",
    "it seems however problematic to use the bphz renormalization scheme to renormalize the corresponding diagrams in higher - dimensional cases since this would require a differentiation of the integrands with respect to external momenta .",
    "the discontinuity of the saw tooth functions in this case would lead to singular terms .",
    "in this paper , we have studied supersymmetric @xmath0 wess - zumino models in one and two dimensions .",
    "the six quantum mechanical models under consideration differ by the choice of lattice derivatives and improvement terms .",
    "the latter can be used to render the theory manifestly supersymmetric on the lattice ; in distinction to previous works on this subject , our simulations of the broken ward identities at strong coupling prove that only one supersymmetry can be preserved .",
    "we have demonstrated to a high numerical precision that by far the best results for bosonic and fermionic masses can be obtained from a model with wilson fermions and stratonovich prescription for the evaluaton of the improvement term and from a model based on the slac derivative .",
    "it is interesting to note that for slac fermions no improvement term is needed to recover supersymmetry in the continuum limit .    as a key result of this paper for two - dimensional wess - zumino models , we propose a non - standard wilson term giving rise to an @xmath1 improved dirac operator @xmath270 the masses extracted from this model approach the continuum values much faster than those for the model with standard wilson - dirac operator ( [ stand3 ] ) .",
    "again , results of a comparably good quality can be obtained with nonlocal slac fermions . in our case , the common reservation that the slac derivative leads to non - renormalizable theories ( as originally shown in  @xcite for the case of four - dimensional gauge theory ) does not hold ; we have proven that the wess - zumino model in two dimensions with this derivative is renormalizable to one - loop order .    motivated by the fact that the masses for the @xmath0 wess - zumino lattice model with ultralocal dirac operator  ( [ conc1 ] ) are quite close to the continuum values already for moderate lattices we plan to study the model at strong couplings where we will see deviations from the free theory .",
    "we are about to implement the phmc algorithm  @xcite as a possibility to deal with the small eigenvalues of the fermionic operator .",
    "we believe that the @xmath0 wess - zumino model as a simple and well - understood theory without the complications of gauge fields has the potential to become a toy - model for developing efficient algorithms for systems with dynamical fermions , similar to the ubiquitous schwinger model which serves as toy model for more complex systems with a chiral condensate , instantons , confinement and so forth .",
    "wess - zumino models are the flat - space limits of landau - ginzburg models",
    ". a related project might be to study another limit of landau - ginzburg theories , namely sigma models in non - trivial khlerian without a superpotential .",
    "such sigma models admit two supersymmetries ; typically they have instanton solutions and chiral condensates may be generated . if there exist local nicolai variables which give rise to improved lattice models with one quarter of supersymmetry , contact could be made with our investigations of wess - zumino models in a much broader physical context .",
    "clearly these interesting field theories deserve further attention , both from the algebraic and from the numerical side .",
    "a further obvious problem is to study the nonperturbative sector of the two - dimensional @xmath3 wess - zumino model .",
    "this model shows a richer phase structure than the model with two supersymmetries .",
    "the sign problem for the pfaffian seems unavoidable .",
    "it is interesting to note that in conventions with hermitean gamma matrices , a nonvanishing wilson term for majorana fermions has to enter the dirac operator as in  ( [ conc1 ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , the discretization errors in this case will be of order @xmath2 ; this can in principle be improved to @xmath1 by a slightly less natural substitute for the wilson term . in general , for the @xmath3 model , no local nicolai variables can be constructed which would suggest a supersymmetric completion of the naive lattice action .",
    "however , one might expect ( as in quantum mechanics ) that such improvement terms for the two - dimensional @xmath3 model with slac fermions are in fact dispensable .",
