    "the origin and stabilization of electroweak symmetry , the nature of dark matter and the generation of the baryon asymmetry ( baryogenesis ) in the universe suggest the existence of new symmetries within the reach of next generation colliders . a particular attractive extension of the standard model that addresses all these issues is supersymmetry with tev - scale supersymmetry breaking .",
    "a long history of experimental observations has corroborated the evidence for dark matter in the universe , culminating in the recent accurate determination by the wmap satellite , in combination with the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite , @xmath0 at the 95% c.l . here",
    "@xmath1 is the dark matter energy density normalized to the critical density and @xmath2 is the hubble parameter in units of 100 km / s / mpc .",
    "supersymmetry with @xmath3-parity conservation provides a natural dark matter candidate , which in most scenarios is the lightest neutralino .",
    "electroweak baryogenesis is based on the concept that the baryon asymmetry is generated at the electroweak phase transition .",
    "while in the standard model the phase transition is not sufficiently strongly first order and there is not enough cp violation , supersymmetry can alleviate both shortcomings .",
    "a strong first - order phase transition can be induced by loop effects of light scalar top quarks ( stops ) to the finite temperature higgs potential . in much of the parameter space of interest for electroweak baryogenesis ,",
    "the light stop is only slightly heavier than the lightest neutralino , thus implying that stop - neutralino co - annihilation is significant .",
    "the co - annihilation contribution is important to meet the wmap experimental results shown above . in the co - annihilation region ,",
    "the stop - neutralino mass difference is smaller than 30 gev @xcite , making a discovery of the stops at hadron colliders difficult @xcite .",
    "this work investigates the capabilities of a future international @xmath4 linear collider ( ilc ) to discover light stops and measure their properties .",
    "this study extends the reach of an earlier work @xcite to the region of small stop - neutralino mass differences .",
    "the experimental analysis for the ilc is used to assess possible conclusions about the nature of dark matter .",
    "in this work , the production of light stops at a 500 gev linear collider is analyzed , using high luminosity @xmath5 and polarization of both beams . for small mass differences",
    "@xmath6 , a light stop decays dominantly into a charm quark and the lightest neutralino , @xmath7 . the signature for stop pair production at an @xmath4 collider , @xmath8 is two charm jets plus missing energy . for small @xmath9 ,",
    "the jets are relatively soft and separation from backgrounds is very challenging .",
    "backgrounds arising from various standard model processes can have cross - sections that are several orders of magnitude larger than the signal , so that even small jet energy smearing effects can be important .",
    "the possibility of efficient charm tagging plays an important role in the signal identification and depends on the vertex detector performance .",
    "thus it is necessary to study this process with a realistic detector simulation .",
    "signal and background events are generated with pythia 6.129 @xcite with circe for realistic beamstrahlung @xcite , together with additional private code for the stop signal generation previously used in ref .",
    "the detector simulation is based on the fast simulation simdet @xcite , describing a typical ilc detector",

    "@xcite and by grace 2.0 @xcite , with cross - checks to comphep 4.4 @xcite where applicable .",
    "a minimal transverse momentum cut , @xmath10 gev , is applied for the two - photon background , to avoid the infrared divergence .",
    ".cross - sections for the stop signal and standard model background processes for @xmath11 gev and different polarization combinations . the signal is given for the stop mixing angle @xmath12 .",

    "an optimization of the event selection for very small @xmath9 will be addressed in future work .    based on the above results from the experimental simulations ,",
    "the discovery reach of a 500 gev @xmath4 collider can be estimated , see fig .",
    "[ fig : cov ] . to cover the whole parameter region , the signal efficiencies for the parameters points in tab .",
    "[ tab : sigeff ] are interpolated .",
    "then , the signal rates @xmath15 are computed by multiplying the efficiency @xmath16 obtained from the simulations with the production cross - section for each point @xmath17 . together with the number of background events @xmath18 , this yields the significance @xmath19 .",
    "the green area in the figure corresponds to the @xmath20 discovery region , @xmath21 .    as evident from the figure ,",
    "the ilc can find light stop quarks for mass differences down to @xmath22 , covering the complete stop - neutralino co - annihilation region and beyond .",
    "the discovery of light stops would hint towards the possibility of electroweak baryogenesis and may allow the co - annihilation mechanism to be effective . in order to confirm this idea , the relevant supersymmetry parameters need to be measured accurately . in this section , the experimental determination of the stop parameters will be discussed .    for definiteness , a specific mssm parameter point",
    "is chosen : @xmath23 the chosen parameters are compatible with the mechanism of electroweak baryogenesis , generating the baryon asymmetry through the phase of @xmath24 .",
    "they correspond to a value for the dark matter relic abundance within the wmap bounds , @xmath25 .",
    "the relic dark matter density has been computed with the code used in ref .",

    "the stop and lightest neutralino masses are @xmath26 and @xmath27 , and the stop mixing angle is @xmath28 , _",
    "i.e. _ the light stop is almost completely right - chiral .",
    "the mass difference @xmath29 lies within the sensitivity range of the ilc .",
    "the measurement of @xmath30 production cross - section for different beam polarization allows to extract both the mass of the light stop and the stop mixing angle @xcite . here",
    "is it assumed that 250 fb@xmath31 is spent each for @xmath32/@xmath33/@xmath34 and @xmath35/@xmath36 , where negative / positive polarization degrees indicate left-/right - handed polarization . besides the statistical errors ,",
    "the following systematic errors are taken into account : mass measurement of the lightest neutralino @xmath37 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) ; determination of the polarization degree @xmath38 ; error in the integrated luminosity @xmath39 ; theoretical uncertainty for background simulation @xmath40 ; stop hadronization and fragmentation 0.51.0% ; charm fragmentation and tagging efficiency @xmath41 ; detector calibration @xmath41 ; beamstrahlung uncertainty from @xcite .",
    "each of the two cross - section measurements for @xmath32/@xmath42 = @xmath4380%/+60% and + 80%/@xmath4360% correspond to a band in the parameter plane of the stop mass and mixing angle , see fig .",
    "[ fig : stoppar ] . combining the two cross - section measurements , the stop parameter are determined to @xmath44",
    "using the data from the experimental stop analysis together with estimated errors for measurements in the neutralino / chargino sector , see ref .",
    "@xcite , the expected cosmological dark matter relic density can be computed .",
    "the mass of the heavier stop @xmath45 is too large to be measured directly , but it is assumed that a limit of @xmath46 gev can be set from collider searches .",
    "all experimental errors are propagated and correlations are taken into account by means of a @xmath47 analysis .",
    "the result of a scan over 100000 random points for the scenario eq .",

    "[ fig : dm ] .",
    "the horizontal bands depict the relic density as measured by wmap @xcite , which is at 1@xmath48 level @xmath49 .",
    "the collider measurements of the stop and chargino / neutralino parameters constrain the relic density to @xmath50 at the 1@xmath48 level , with an overall precision of the same order of magnitude , though somewhat worse , than the direct wmap determination .",
    "the uncertainty in the computation of the dark matter relic density from ilc precision measurements is dominated by the measuremenst of the lightest stop mass .",
