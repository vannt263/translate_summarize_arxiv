    "the modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) proposes that the law of inertia or gravity takes on a specific non - newtonian form at accelerations well below a definite universal value ( milgrom 1983a , b , c ) . as an alternative to dark matter , the simple mond formula with one new fixed parameter ( the critical acceleration @xmath1 ) has been quite successful in predicting the form of spiral galaxy rotation curves from the observed distribution of detectable matter ( begeman et al . 1990 , sanders 1996 ) as well as the magnitude of the conventional mass discrepancy in galaxy clusters ( milgrom 1983c ) and in superclusters ( milgrom 1997 ) .",
    "mond subsumes the global scaling relationships for galaxies the tully - fisher relation for spirals and the faber - jackson relation for ellipticals , as well as an equivalent gas temperature - mass relation for clusters of galaxies ( sanders 1994 ) .",
    "mond stabilizes rotationally supported thin disks ( brada 1996 ) , explains the presence of a maximum critical surface density in spiral galaxies and ellipticals ( milgrom 1983b ) , and predicts the observed large conventional mass discrepancy in low - surface brightness systems ( milgrom 1983b , mcgaugh & de blok 1997 ) .    however , an argument often directed against mond is that , as a theory , it is ad hoc and incomplete . in particular , mond makes no predictions with respect to cosmology and cosmogony . even though the near coincidence of the empirically determined @xmath1 with @xmath2 is suggestive of a cosmological basis for mond , the structure of that cosmology is not at all evident .",
    "the naive expectation is that a hypothesis which posits such a radical departure from newtonian dynamics ( and presumably general relativity ) on the scale of galaxies and clusters of galaxies would surely lead to a highly unconventional cosmology which would be inconsistent with the phenomenological successes of the standard big bang most notably the nucleosynthesis of the light elements in their observed abundances and the large and small scale isotropy of the universe at the epoch of recombination .",
    "such criticism can not be addressed by an incomplete theory .",
    "the reason for this incompleteness is that mond at the present time lacks a relativistic extention ; there is no credible general theory of gravity which predicts the mond phenomenology in the appropriate limit .",
    "in fact , non - standard scalar - tensor theories have been proposed as a theoretical underpinning of mond ( bekenstein and milgrom 1984 , bekenstein 1988 , romatka 1992 , sanders 1997 ) .",
    "two of these , phase - coupling gravity ( bekenstein 1988 ) and stratified ( preferred frame ) theories with aquadratic scalar field lagrangians ( bekenstein & milgrom 1984 , sanders 1997 ) do yield sensible cosmologies isotropic and homogeneous and similar to the low - density friedmann models ( sanders 1989 , sanders 1997 ) .",
    "although such theories do have the considerable advantage of predictive power on scales other than extra - galactic , the fact is that they are unnatural ; these non - standard scalar - tensor theories are as contrived as the ad hoc modification of newton s laws which they presume to replace .",
    "thus it is perhaps premature to work out fully the cosmological implications of such complicated and tentative theories .",
    "must , then , considerations of mond cosmology then be postponed until the final theory is in place ? even before further theoretical developments , it may be possible to draw some preliminary conclusions about a mond universe by considering a finite expanding spherical region .",
    "it is well - known that the application of newtonian dynamics to such a region leads to the friedmann equation for the evolution of the cosmic scale factor .",
    "even the cosmological constant can be included as an additional fluid with negative pressure .",
    "it might be expected that some insight into a pure mond cosmology might be gained by such a procedure using milgrom s formula instead of newton s .",
    "an interesting start in this direction was made by felten ( 1984 ) .",
    "he pointed out that with mond , the physical size of the expanding region can not be factored out .",
    "this means that uniform expansion of a spherical region is not possible ; that the dynamical history of such a region in the universe depends upon its physical size .",
    "this would suggest that an isotropic and homogeneous universe , as described by the robertson - walker ( rw ) metric is not possible in the context of mond .",
    "moreover , due to the effective logarithmic potential implied by mond , any finite - size region will re - collapse in a finite time .",
    "the universe , out to the present horizon , will eventually re - collapse regardless of its mean density . in a low - density universe a region with a present size of",
    "20 to 30 mpc would just now be turning around , and this , as stressed by felten , is roughly the observed scale of large - scale structure voids and superclusters .    in the present paper",
    "i continue the discussion of felten on mond cosmology in the context of finite expanding spherical regions .",
    "three assumptions underly this discussion , all of which were more or less implicit in the work of felten .",
    "the first is that the dynamics of such a region are not influenced by the exterior universe that there is , in effect , an equivalent of the birkhoff theorem for the relativistic theory of mond .",
    "this assumption is the most shaky .",
    "scalar - tensor theories of modified dynamics violate the strong equivalence principle which means that no dynamical system is isolated from its environment .",
    "the time - variation of the gravitational constant due to universal expansion is one example of the possible effect of the rest of the universe on the spherical region . here",
    "the assumption is that any such effects which may be present in the final theory will play a minor role in the dynamical history of the finite volume .",
    "the second assumption is that the modified dynamics holds for all accelerations below @xmath1 that there is no return to newtonian attraction or inertia at very much lower accelerations , as in cosmological pcg .",
    "this then will be an exploration of the cosmology of pure mond .",
    "finally , it is assumed that the critical acceleration @xmath1 is independent of cosmic time ( not true in cosmological pcg ) . the fact that @xmath3 would suggest that @xmath1 is time dependent ( as is the hubble parameter ) .",
    "however , this expression could have one of several meanings as pointed out by milgrom ( 1994 ) .",
    "one possible basis is that @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the cosmological constant .",
    "such an interpretation would consistent with the assumption of no time variation of @xmath1 .",
    "alternatively , the numerical coincidence could arise from anthropic considerations : as will be shown below , structure develops when @xmath6 .",
    "having made these assumptions , i re - derive felten s expression for the evolution of an isolated spherical region dominated by non - relativistic , pressure - less matter .",
    "i then demonstrate that , because of the acceleration threshold , modified dynamics can only be valid inside a critical radius @xmath7 .",
    "this critical radius expands faster than the scale factor and the horizon , so that in the earlier universe the size of the region in which mond applies is smaller than the horizon scale .",
    "this is the principal result of the present paper .",
    "friedmann cosmology , characterized by uniform expansion , applies on the scale of the horizon , while mond , in which the expansion is highly non - uniform , applies on sub - horizon scales .",
    "therefore , the usual friedmann equation is valid for evolution of the universal scale factor , but the felten equation is valid for spherical regions smaller than @xmath7 .",
    "this means that , at any epoch , while the universe overall is homogeneous , density inhomogeneities should be present on the scale of @xmath7 at that time . only recently in the history of the universe",
    "has the size of the region dominated by mond expanded to include a significant fraction of the the observable universe , c / h@xmath8 ( @xmath7 at present depends upon the value of the cosmological constant ) ; i.e. , the universe on large scale has only become `` mondian '' at late cosmic time .",
    "these results remain qualitatively the same when radiation is included . in the early universe , at the epoch of nucleosynthesis , mond regions are very much smaller than the horizon .",
    "when pressure gradient forces are considered , the density and expansion of the universe remain highly uniform during the radiation - dominated era and identical to that of the standard hot big bang , so all results concerning primordial nucleosynthesis are retained .",
    "moreover , mond - induced inhomogeneities at the epoch of recombination are many orders of magnitude smaller than those implied by the observed fluctuations in the background radiation .",
    "regions of larger comoving size and mass enter the regime of modified dynamics at later times .",
    "re - collapse of finite size regions dominated by modified dynamics proceeds rapidly once non - relativistic matter dominates the energy density , even in a very low density universe .",
    "this is due to the effective logarithmic gravitational potential implied by mond . at the epoch of matter - radiation equality",
    "the mass enclosed within a mond dominated region is @xmath9 m@xmath10 , comparable to a low mass galaxy .",
    "this gives a preferred mass scale to the first objects which collapse and virialize and may explain why galaxy mass objects are the fundamental virialized building blocks .",
    "the expansion of mond - dominated regions to include larger and larger comoving scales leads to a scenario of structure formation which is extremely hierarchical and `` bottom up '' , with the smallest objects forming first star clusters and low mass galaxies and larger structures forming later by a series of mergers .",
    "massive galaxies should be in place as virialized objects by a redshift of 5 to 10 .",
    "the largest objects just now being virialized are the rich clusters and supercluster scale objects would only now be separating out of hubble expansion .",
    "the scale - dependent deceleration induced by mond implies that the universe , at the present epoch , is inhomogeneous on large scale with a mean density of galaxies about a given galaxy decreasing out to hundreds of mpc .",
    "the scale for cross - over to homogeneity depends the value of the cosmological constant .",
    "the cosmological principle which postulates the isotropy and homogeneity of the universe permits separations between physical objects to be described by a universal dimensionless scale factor which is only a function of cosmic time .",
    "it is well - known ( eg . see peebles 1993 ) that the friedmann equation for the evolution of scale factor can be derived by considering the newtonian equation of motion for an isolated uniform spherical region of radius r : @xmath11 here m is the active gravitational mass given , in the weak - field static limit of the einstein field equations , by @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the density and pressure of the smooth fluid . combining eqs .",
    "1 and 2 we have @xmath15 which is supplemented by the energy conservation equation @xmath16 and an equation of state",
    ". obviously one may write @xmath17 where l is a fixed length scale and x is a time - dependent scale factor ( here normalized to be 1 at the present epoch )",
    ". then l disappears in eq .  3 and 4 . taking the fluid to be a mixture of non - relativistic pressure - less matter ( @xmath18 ) , radiation ( @xmath19 ) , and vacuum energy density ( @xmath20 ) and integrating eq .",
    "3 we find the usual dimensionless friedmann equation for the time - evolution of the scale factor , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the dimensionless cosmological constant , @xmath23 is the density parameter for non - relativistic matter ( with @xmath24 being the present mean density of matter ) and @xmath25 is the density parameter for the cosmic background radiation where @xmath26 is the temperature of the cosmic blackbody radiation at the present epoch ( 2.73 k ) and @xmath27 is the radiation density constant .",
    "the quantity @xmath28 is the integration constant which is to be identified with curvature of space - time .",
    "the quantity @xmath29 is the hubble parameter in units of the present hubble parameter @xmath30 and time is in units of the hubble time @xmath31 .",
    "mond posits that for accelerations below a critical value @xmath1 , the true gravitational force @xmath32 is related to the newtonian gravitation force @xmath33 as @xmath34 ( milgrom 1983a ) where @xmath35 is an unspecified function such that @xmath36 if @xmath37 and @xmath38 if @xmath39 . thus in the high acceleration limit the gravitational force is the usual newtonian force , but in the low acceleration limit @xmath40 ( this may also be written as a modification of the law of inertia where @xmath41 replaces the usual expression ) . because we are interested here only in a broad view of the overall dynamics of a mond universe , we will assume that the transition in @xmath35 between the two asymptotic limits occurs abruptly at x=1 .    in the low acceleration limit the mond equivalent of eq .",
    "3 becomes @xmath42^{1\\over 2}\\eqno(9)\\ ] ] where now , obviously , a constant length scale can not be factored out . neglecting for the moment radiation and vacuum energy density and taking the equation of state only for non - relativistic pressure - less matter",
    ", the conservation equation implies that @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the comoving radius of the spherical region ( i.e. , the radius the spherical region would have at present if it continued to expand according to eq .  5 ) and @xmath24 is the present mean density in the equivalent friedmann model universe .",
    "then eq .",
    "9 becomes @xmath45^{1\\over2 }   r^{-1}. \\eqno(11)\\ ] ] this equation may be integrated once to give the equivalent of the friedmann equation @xmath46^{1\\over 2 } ln(r / r_i)\\eqno(12)\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is an initial radius of the sphere and @xmath48 is the expansion velocity at this initial radius . from the form of eq .",
    "12 it is obvious that at some maximum radius @xmath49 the expansion will stop and the spherical region will re - collapse .",
    "this is given by @xmath50 where @xmath51    this is the expression derived by felten ( 1984 ) written in a somewhat different form . at first sight",
    ", it may seem odd to use terms such as @xmath52 which are valid for friedmann cosmology but have no obvious relevance to mond cosmology .",
    "but it is proven below that mond on small scale is consistent with friedmann on large scale .",
    "i now consider the meaning of the initial radius @xmath47 in eqs .",
    "12 and 13 .",
    "looking back at the newtonian expression eq .  3 we see that , at any epoch characterized by some value of density and pressure , the acceleration of the radius of the shell increases linearly with r. this implies that there should be some critical radius @xmath7 , beyond which the acceleration exceeds the mond acceleration @xmath1 and the dynamics is newtonian .",
    "that is to say , on all scales greater than @xmath7 , the usual newtonian expressions , eqs .  3 and 5",
    "apply to the expansion of a spherical region and the evolution of the scale factor .",
    "this critical length scale is given by @xmath53 where again m is the active gravitational mass .",
    "making use of eqs .",
    "4 - 7 , eq .  14 becomes @xmath54 or @xmath55 when the universe is matter dominated , @xmath56 when the universe is radiation dominated , and @xmath57 when the universe is vacuum energy dominated .",
    "therefore , at any epoch characterized by a scale factor x , modified dynamics can only apply in regions smaller than @xmath7 .",
    "this critical radius grows faster than both the scale factor and the horizon , @xmath58 , in the radiation- and matter - dominated regimes ( i.e. , @xmath59 ) .    in fig .",
    "1 @xmath7 is plotted against scale factor . here and elsewhere below the cosmological parameters",
    "are taken to be @xmath60 km/(s mpc ) , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 cm / s@xmath64 .",
    "this value of @xmath52 is consistent with the baryonic content of the universe implied by considerations of primordial nucleosynthesis ( walker et al .",
    "1991 ) and with estimates of the stellar mass in galaxies and intra - cluster hot gas ( carlberg et al .",
    "1998 ) ; in the context of mond this would be the total matter content of the universe ( i.e. , no significant contribution from non - baryonic dark matter ) .",
    "the density parameter in radiation , @xmath65 , is exactly that for a black body of 2.73 k and the assumed hubble parameter .",
    "the value of the acceleration parameter , @xmath1 , is that determined from fitting to the extended rotation curves of nearby galaxies ( begeman et al .",
    "for the purposes of this plot the cosmological constant has been set to zero .",
    "the age of a model universe with this assumed h@xmath8 and @xmath52 would be @xmath66 years which is consistent with the recent determinations of the ages of globular clusters in light of the new cluster distance scale ( chaboyer et al .",
    "1997 )    also shown in fig .",
    "1 is the horizon scale ( @xmath67 ) as a function of scale factor determined by numerical integration of eq .",
    "it is evident that at early epochs @xmath7 is much smaller than the horizon size .",
    "this suggests that any causally connected region of the universe can be isotropic and homogeneous with the expansion governed by the usual friedmann equation , eq .",
    "5 . that is to say , for spatial separations larger",
    "@xmath7 , it is valid to apply a universal scale factor and , presumably , the rw metric .",
    "however , about a typical point in the universe there exist a smaller volume with radius @xmath7 within which modified dynamics and eq .",
    "12 applies ; i.e. , in which separations can not be described in terms of a scale factor and which expand at a slower rate than the universe at large . thus at any epoch inhomogeneities must be present on a scales smaller than @xmath7 . for a universal scale factor greater than 0.23",
    ", the critical mond radius @xmath7 exceeds the horizon scale .",
    "this means that the entire causally connected universe has become mondian at a redshift of about 3.3 and can no longer be described by the rw metric .",
    "this interpretation does contain a logical conundrum .",
    "in an actual mond universe with friedmann expansion on a horizon scale but slower mond expansion on sub - horizon scales , not every point in the fluid can possibly be a center of mond - dominated expansion and collapse ; it is not possible that a horizon - scale volume can expand while smaller spherical regions about every point within that volume re - collapse .",
    "this is a paradox of the present non - relativistic treatment which can only be resolved in a more complete theory a theory involving fluctuations in which local peaks probably play the role of seeds for mond - dominated expansion and re - collapse with voids developing elsewhere .",
    "but , in any case , is likely that @xmath7 is the approximate scale below which there exist mond - induced inhomogeneities at any epoch in an evolving universe .",
    "accepting this interpretation , we note that larger and larger masses enter the mond regime as the universe evolves .",
    "given that @xmath44 is the comoving scale of mass @xmath68 and taking @xmath69 , we have @xmath70 this is also shown in fig .  1 where it is evident that objects of galaxy mass ( @xmath71 m@xmath10 ) enter the mond regime at @xmath72 corresponding to a redshift of 140 .",
    "obviously then the appropriate value for the initial radius , @xmath47 in eq .",
    "13a , would be the radius at which eq .",
    "12 first applies to the expansion of the spherical region ; i.e. , @xmath73 this would be about 14 kpc for the galaxy size region .",
    "moreover , the initial expansion velocity would be given by the hubble expansion on a scale of @xmath47 : @xmath74 which is about 320 km / s for the the @xmath71 m@xmath10 region .",
    "we then find , from eq .",
    "13 , that @xmath75 and @xmath76 ; i.e. , after entering the mond regime at a redshift in excess of 100 , a galaxy mass would only expand by a factor of about four before re - collapsing .",
    "the time - scale for this expansion is given by @xmath77 ( felten 1984 ) ; i.e. , objects of galaxy size and smaller enter the mond regime early and fall out of hubble expansion on a time - scale comparable to the age of the universe at that epoch .",
    "for the @xmath71 m@xmath10 sphere this would be approximately @xmath78 years .",
    "re - collapse and virialization might take three or four times longer , so we see that with modified dynamics in the context of a low density friedmann universe , galaxies should be in place as virialized objects when the universe is about @xmath79 years old corresponding to a redshift of 9 or 10 .",
    "in the early universe the size of spherical regions dominated by modified dynamics is small compared to the horizon . taking eq .",
    "15c and noting that the temperature of the black body radiation scales with the inverse of the scale factor , we have @xmath80 which , for the assumed cosmology becomes @xmath81 with @xmath82 k and @xmath83 k , corresponding to the epoch of nucleosynthesis , we find @xmath84 cm .",
    "the scale of the horizon in the radiation - dominated era is given by @xmath85 which is @xmath86 cm at the epoch of nucleosynthesis .",
    "that is to say , the expansion of the universe as a whole is identical to that of the standard big bang with the scale of modified dynamics being 15 orders of magnitude smaller than the horizon size .    but because nucleosynthesis occurs on a smaller scale still that of internucleon spacing ( @xmath87 cm) we must consider the fate of these small regions of non - standard dynamics . taking eqs .  4 and 9 but now with the equation of state for radiation , we find @xmath88 which integrates to @xmath89\\eqno(24a)\\ ] ] given eq .  18 for @xmath48 and that @xmath69 we find with eq",
    ".  15c that @xmath90 then it is straight forward to show that , in the absence of other considerations , any such region will expand more slowly than the universe as a whole and will re - collapse after expanding by a factor @xmath91 .",
    "this might well seem devastating not just for primordial nucleosynthesis , but also for the overall homogeneity of the early universe .",
    "there is , however , another physical effect which must be considered .",
    "the slower expansion of these regions on the scale of @xmath7 will very rapidly lead to density and hence pressure gradients which will resist re - collapse . because the gravitational acceleration in these regions is so small , only small density gradients are required to keep these regions expanding with the universe at large .",
    "the gravitational acceleration in these small mond regions is ( by definition ) on the order of @xmath1 .",
    "so the pressure gradient required to resist re - collapse can be estimated from @xmath92 setting @xmath93 and @xmath94 and making use of eq .",
    "20 we estimate the corresponding density fluctuation over this scale to be @xmath95 which implies @xmath96 when @xmath83 k. in the early radiation dominated universe , modified dynamics results in no significant deviation from homogeneity and the thermal history is identical to that of the standard big bang .",
    "this means that all of the results on nucleosynthesis in the standard model carry over to a mond cosmology .    at the epoch of recombination ( t = 4000",
    "k ) , where radiation still dominates in low @xmath52 models , we find @xmath97 . that is to say ,",
    "the mond - induced inhomogeneities would be five orders of magnitude less than the density fluctuations implied by the observed fluctuations in the cmb .",
    "the argument on pressure gradients resisting mond collapse can be re - framed in terms of the critical jeans mass for gravitational instability .",
    "the jeans mass is , effectively , identical to the virial mass which , in the context of mond , is given by @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the sound speed in the fluid being considered ( milgrom 1989 ) . before decoupling of matter and radiation , @xmath100 implying that @xmath101 which , given that @xmath3 , is on the order of the total mass of the present observable universe",
    ". obviously this is vastly greater than the mass enclosed in a mond region ( at the epoch of nucleosynthesis this is approximately @xmath102 g ) ; mond dominated gravitational collapse is clearly an impossibility before hydrogen recombination .",
    "after recombination , the jeans mass of the baryonic component becomes @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath105 is the mean atomic mass , and @xmath106 is the temperature of the matter . but collapse can still not occur until the jeans mass falls below the critical mass in a mond dominated region . from eqs .",
    "16 and 20 this is found to be @xmath107 in the radiation - dominated regime .",
    "we see from eqs .",
    "28 and 29 that while the jeans mass decreases with the square of the radiation temperature , the critical mond mass rapidly increases as the temperature falls .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .  2 after the epoch of recombination ( @xmath108 k ) assuming that @xmath109 ( true for non - relativistic mono - atomic fluid ) .",
    "the mond critical mass becomes comparable to the jeans mass ( eqs .",
    "27 and 28 ) when the radiation temperature has fallen to @xmath110^{1\\over{13 } } ; \\eqno(30)\\ ] ] with the cosmology assumed above this is @xmath111 k , or somewhat later than the epoch of recombination ( this value is obviously quite insensitive to the actual values of the cosmological parameters ) .",
    "the corresponding value of the jeans mass and critical mond mass is about @xmath112 m@xmath10 .",
    "this means that shortly after recombination pressure gradients are no longer effective in preventing mond - induced collapse .",
    "however , it is argued below that @xmath113 is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for mond - dominated expansion and collapse .",
    "expansion of a low density universe ( @xmath114 ) will remain radiation - dominated until well after recombination ; for the cosmology assumed here this occurs at @xmath115 ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "it is clear from fig .  2 that regions having a mass less than @xmath117 m@xmath10 enter the mond regime while radiation still dominates the energy density of the universe .",
    "taken at face value then , it would seem that one should apply eq .",
    "24 to the mond - dominated expansion of regions above the jeans mass which enter the mond regime in the period between recombination and matter - radiation density equality .",
    "however , during this period the horizon is much larger than the scale over which mond applies ( at matter - radiation equality the horizon is 4 mpc but the scale of modified dynamics is only 3 kpc ) .",
    "after recombination , the photons are uncoupled to the matter , so it would be impossible for a mond region to re - collapse while the passive gravitational mass in radiation still dominates the gravitational deceleration ; the photons free - stream to the horizon .",
    "mond - dominated expansion and re - collapse as described by eq .",
    "12 would begin for all masses between 300 m@xmath10 ( the jean s mass ) and @xmath118 m@xmath10 ( the critical mond mass ) at the epoch of matter - radiation equality ( indicated by the heavy solid line in fig .  2 ) .",
    "the actual mass in a mond - dominated region at the epoch of matter - radiation equality , @xmath119 , is extremely sensitive to the cosmological parameters .",
    "this may be determined from eqs .",
    "15 and 16 ( setting 15b equal to 15c ) and is found to be @xmath120 combining with eq .  7 we find @xmath121}^8\\,\\,{\\rm m_\\odot}\\eqno(32)\\ ] ] matching the observed light element abundances with the predictions of primordial nucleosynthesis ( walker et al .",
    "1991 ) , implies that @xmath122 . then with eq .",
    "32 we find that @xmath123 .",
    "it is interesting that the mass scale over which mond applies at the epoch of matter - radiation equality when mond collapse can begin and significant inhomogeneities can form corresponds to that of low to moderate mass galaxies .",
    "perhaps this offers some explanation for the fact that the lowest - mass virialized building - blocks of the universe are galaxies ( the existing globular clusters and dwarf galaxies re - collapsed simultaneously and may have survived due to incomplete merging ) .",
    "but in any case , for objects of any mass scale , the separation of from the hubble expansion and subsequent re - collapse can be described by eq .",
    "12 ( the felten equation ) with the initial radius being the critical mond radius given by eq .  15 for objects of mass greater than @xmath79 m@xmath10 , and the scaled comoving radius ( @xmath124 ) at the epoch of matter - radiation equality for lower mass regions .",
    "this dynamical history is shown for various mass scales in fig .  3 which is a plot of the scale factor ( @xmath125 ) of regions of different mass as a function of cosmic time to the point of maximum expansion .",
    "these curves are determined from numerical integrations of eq .",
    "the cosmic scale factor corresponding to friedmann expansion ( eq .  5 ) is also shown ( again the cosmological term has been set to zero ) .",
    "the vertical dotted line shows the epoch of matter - radiation equality for this particular cosmological model .",
    "it is evident that objects of globular cluster mass ( @xmath112 m@xmath10 ) re - collapse very soon after matter - radiation equality ; maximum expansion is reached at a cosmic time of @xmath126 years corresponding to a redshift of 156 .",
    "massive galaxies ( @xmath71 m@xmath10 ) reach this point of maximum expansion at @xmath127 years or @xmath128 .",
    "clusters of galaxies ( @xmath129 m@xmath10 ) begin to re - collapse at @xmath130 years ( z=3 ) .",
    "the mass which is just turning around at the present epoch is @xmath131 m@xmath10 .",
    "the comoving scale is 66 mpc but the present radius would be 29 mpc .",
    "this would correspond to the mass and scale of superclusters as noted by felten ( 1984 ) .",
    "taken literally the implication would be that a region of 30 mpc about a typical observer should be collapsing rather than expanding , which is evidently not the case locally .",
    "this result , which might be taken as an argument against a pure mond cosmology , neglects likely complications arising in a real universe filled with significant density enhancements and peculiar accelerations . in the fully - developed mond universe at the present epoch , the large scale inhomogeneities and resulting tides will most likely cause large aspherical distortions of the developing structure .",
    "thus , the effects of distant matter can not be ignored ; i.e. , the fundamental assumption underlying this treatment of isolated regions breaks down .",
    "given the enhanced tidal effects and the fact that , in mond , the internal dynamics of a a region is effected by the external acceleration field , the `` external field effect '' ( milgrom 1983a ) , the growth of pancakes , filaments and voids would seem natural .",
    "the present turnaround radius of 30 mpc may only give an estimate of the scale of structure which has significantly separated out of the present hubble flow , as suggested by felten ( 1984 ) .",
    "since the entire present universe is mondian ( in the absence of a dynamically significant cosmological constant ) , then on all scales out to the horizon , the expansion can not be uniform ; the mean value of the hubble parameter grows with scale .",
    "this also implies that the mean density of matter within a spherical region should decrease out to the horizon .",
    "this may be determined by integrating eq .",
    "12 for spheres with comoving radii larger than 66 mpc ( corresponding to the current shell which is just turning around at 29 mpc ) out to the horizon scale of 4000 mpc .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "4 which is a log - log plot of the ratio of the mean density inside a finite spherical volume to the mean density of the universe as a function the present radius of the sphere ( not the comoving radius ) .",
    "it is evident that the average density smoothly increases from the horizon down to a scale of 30 mpc where it is 10 times larger than the mean density .",
    "the literal and naive interpretation of fig .",
    "4 , and that which would seem most consistent with the treatment of isolated spherical regions , is that this would represent the density distribution about a single observer in in a mond universe .",
    "but if we require , consistent with the cosmological principle , that the observer have no special position , then an equally valid interpretation is that the average density distribution about any observer in the mond universe declines smoothly to the horizon that the matter distribution is non - analytic ( fractal ) and does not imply a special position for one observer ( coleman & pietronero 1991 ) .",
    "it has been claimed , from analysis of redshift catalogues , that the mean density of galaxies about a given galaxy does decrease with scale ( eg .",
    "coleman & pietronero 1991 ) out to cosmological distances .",
    "although this claim is controversial ( peebles 1993 ) , it is generally consistent with expectations for a pure mond cosmology .",
    "the actual radius of cross - over to homogeneity would depend upon the value of a possible cosmological constant .",
    "with a cosmological term large enough to be dynamically significant ( @xmath132 ) , the critical radius for modified dynamics ( eq .",
    "15a ) , after first becoming infinitely large , asymptotically approaches a constant value : @xmath133 , i.e. , about 1/6 the current horizon if @xmath134 75 km / s - mpc ( the observed value of @xmath1 would then correspond to @xmath135 ) . in this case",
    "we might expect large scale homogeneity and uniform exponential expansion of the universe on sub - horizon scales larger than several hundred mpc .",
    "although there is not yet a plausible candidate for a general theory of gravity which predicts the mond phenomenology in the limit of low accelerations , consideration of the dynamics of a finite spherical volume may contain elements of a realistic mond cosmology .",
    "perhaps the most interesting conclusion that can be drawn from such a exercise is that modified dynamics over finite separations is compatible with friedmann cosmology on large scale ; until relatively recently in the history of the universe mond could not dominate the dynamical evolution of the universe in general . at earlier epochs ,",
    "the scale over which mond applies , @xmath7 ( within which the deceleration of hubble expansion is less than @xmath1 ) , is smaller than the size of a causally connected region which implies that the universe as a whole can be isotropic and adequately described by the rw metric with expansion governed by the usual friedmann equation .",
    "however , the fact that the expansion is slower in mond - dominated regions implies that inhomogeneities must be present at any epoch on a scale of @xmath7 and smaller . in the early radiation dominated universe ,",
    "the magnitude of these mond - induced inhomogeneities is very small ( @xmath136 when t=@xmath79 k ) , because of the small pressure gradients required to restore uniform expansion .",
    "therefore , the thermal and dynamical history of the early mond universe is exactly that of the standard big bang and all predictions relevant to the nucleosynthesis of the light elements carry over to mond cosmology .",
    "after non - relativistic matter dominates the mass density of the universe ( which can be rather late in a low density universe ) , mond cosmology diverges from that of standard cosmology . at the epoch of matter - radiation equality , objects with mass up to @xmath117 m@xmath10 rapidly collapse to form virialized objects .",
    "the fact that this mass scale , which is the mass in the mond regime at radiation - matter equality , is comparable to that of low mass galaxies seems significant : objects of this mass would be the principal virialized building blocks in the universe .",
    "moreover , this mass scale emerges naturally from the basic dynamics ; astrophysical considerations such as cooling vs. collapse time scales do not play a role .",
    "although objects of smaller mass ( down to @xmath137 m@xmath10 ) collapse and virialize first , a process probably accompanied by star formation , these objects would rapidly merge in the the larger collapsing regions .",
    "this suggests that galaxy formation is primarily dissipationless ; that the stellar content of galaxies may be in place before the galaxies actually form .",
    "of course , early star formation could be limited by processes such as photo - dissociation of h@xmath138 as in standard scenarios ( haiman et al .",
    "1997 ) ; these self - limiting processes could keep much of the matter content of the universe in gaseous form as seems to be implied by the observations of rich clusters .",
    "many of these low mass galaxies galaxies would merge to form more massive objects as larger and larger scales come into the mond regime .",
    "a spherical region with the mass of a large galaxy ( @xmath71 m@xmath10 ) reaches maximum expansion and begins to re - collapse at a redshift of 26 which implies that large galaxies should be in place as virialized objects by redshift of 5 to 10 .",
    "this is earlier than the epoch of galaxy formation in the standard cdm paradigm ( frenk et al .",
    "1988 ) . moreover , from fig",
    ".  3 it is evident that regions with the size and mass of a cluster have reached maximum expansion by a cosmic age of @xmath139 years corresponding to a redshift of three .",
    "this means that by z=3 not only do massive galaxies exist but they are also significantly clustered ( the density of the @xmath129 m@xmath10 region would be enhanced by a factor of 6.5 over the mean at this redshift ) .",
    "this may be relevant to the observation of luminous galaxies at z=3 which is remarkable not only because they are there but also because of the apparent degree of clustering ( steidel et al .",
    "such observations may be able to distinguish between the cosmogony sketched here and that of the standard cdm paradigm .",
    "the largest objects being virialized now would be clusters of galaxies with masses in excess of @xmath129 m@xmath10 .",
    "superclusters would only now be reaching maximum expansion .",
    "such a scenario of structure formation is hierarchical in the extreme and as such bears a resemblance to the more standard ( cdm ) scenarios of the build up of structure . but here , dissipationless dark matter is not required to enhance structure formation ; structure forms inevitably on the mond scale of @xmath7 because of the effective logarithmic potential .    in the present universe regions approaching",
    "the horizon scale would be subject to a scale - dependent deceleration due to modified dynamics .",
    "this would lead to a universe in which the mean run of density about a galaxy decreases smoothly to a cosmic scale .",
    "the actual scale for approach to homogeneity would depend upon the value of the cosmological constant ; for @xmath140 corresponding to a zero curvature universe , the density and expansion of the universe would be more or less uniform on scales greater than several hundred mpc . in such a universe , the hubble parameter would also be , on average , scale dependent , increasing with the separation between objects out to some significant fraction of the hubble radius . however , these are the aspects of mond cosmology which most depend upon the unknown properties of the underlying theory such as the value of the cosmological constant and whether or not mond phenomenology saturates at some lower value of acceleration and attraction returns to inverse square .    the details of cosmology and cosmogony sketched here are dependent upon the assumptions which underly this procedure : no effects of the surrounding universe on the finite spherical volume , no return to newtonian dynamics at lower accelerations , no variation of @xmath1 with cosmic time .",
    "a different set of assumptions is also plausible and would lead to a different mond cosmology .",
    "the remarkable aspect of the cosmology resulting from these assumptions is the fact that the pre - recombination dynamical and thermal evolution is identical to that of the standard big bang .",
    "but in any case , it seems inevitable that in a mond cosmology , structure formation proceeds much more rapidly and efficiently than in standard cosmologies due to the effective logarithmic potential .",
    "friedman expansion on horizon scale combined with modified dynamics on smaller scale suggests that density peaks may be required to play the role of seeds or centers about which mond - dominated expansion and re - collapse occurs .",
    "apart from this , primordial density fluctuations have played no role in the present discussion of structure formation . in the correct relativistic theory",
    "this will probably not be the case ; for example , in stratified aquadratic scalar - tensor theory ( sanders 1997 ) , there are no effects of modified dynamics in the absence of scalar field gradients ; in a perfectly homogeneous universe , the metric is rw and structure never develops .",
    "this suggests that in a proper theory fluctuations may be essential for the development of structure which may then proceed , qualitatively , as described above .",
    "one should be cautious about pushing these results too far .",
    "in standard theory , the newtonian dynamics of an expanding region takes on cosmological significance only in retrospect , that is , after the application of general relativity and the construction of a relativistic cosmology . here",
    ", the order is reversed the rules of mond are applied to a finite spherical region before the development of the appropriate relativistic theory .",
    "but it is possible that many of the aspects of a fully relativistic cosmology may be previewed , at least in a qualitative sense , by such an exercise .",
    "while this remains to be seen , it is of considerable interest that the resulting cosmology does seem to reconcile the extreme homogeneity of the early radiation - dominated universe with early galaxy formation and the extreme range of structure observed in the matter - dominated era .",
    "moreover , the fact that this can be accomplished without the necessity of invoking hypothetical non - baryonic dark matter is entirely consistent with the original motivation for modified dynamics as an alternative to dark matter on the scale of galaxies and galaxy clusters ."
