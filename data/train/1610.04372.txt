    "periodic anderson model describes hybridization @xmath6 between local electron orbital ( blue ) and conducting charge carrier ( orange ) .",
    "the single occupied local electron has energy @xmath7 while double occupation has extra coloumb energy @xmath8 . the conduction electron hops @xmath9 between nearest - neighbor sites and it gives a conducting energy band . for simplicity ,",
    "external harmonic trapping potential is not shown here . ]",
    "fortunately , thanks to the rapid development of ultracold fermionic atom loaded in optical lattice@xcite , intriguing plan to simulate kondo lattice model in terms of alkaline - earth metal atoms @xmath10sr and @xmath11yb is recently proposed and preliminary theoretical works in this direct have been achieved@xcite .",
    "more recently , interaction in these alkaline - earth atom gases has been under control in terms of the newly proposed orbital feshbach resonance@xcite .",
    "( although @xmath11yb is in practice a rare - earth atom , it has similar electronic structure to alkaline - earth metal atom and we will only use the name alkaline - earth metal atoms for simplicity . ) in realistic heavy fermion compounds , charge / valence fluctuation of local f - electron plays a crucial role in many mixed valence materials including the hotly studied candidate of _ topological _ kondo insulator smb@xmath12@xcite .",
    "furthermore , valance fluctuation is also argued to be responsible for the second superconducting phases in prototypical heavy fermion superconductor cecu@xmath13si@xmath13 and volume - changed transition in monovalent ce under high pressure@xcite .",
    "more theoretically , the orbital - selective mott transition proposed for heavy fermion quantum criticality is rooted on the localization of f - electron driven by large charge fluctuation , as well@xcite .",
    "intrigued by those interesting phenomena , the periodic anderson model , ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig : pam ] ) which is a lattice extension of well - known single impurity anderson model and is believed to capture such charge / valence fluctuation in the simplest fashion , should be taken into fully account though to our knowledge there are still no proposals to realize this fundamental model hamiltonian in cold fermion systems .    in this article",
    ", we pave the first step to this issue with providing a simple scheme to realize periodic anderson model in alkaline - earth metal atoms and analyze basic features of this model with state of art numerical tool , the determinant quantum monte carlo ( dqmc ) and supplemented with dynamic mean - field theory ( dmft)@xcite , which correctly captures local quantum many - body dynamics and its prediction becomes exact at infinite dimension .",
    "the main point of the scheme is that transition between electronic excited state @xmath2 and ground state @xmath0 of alkaline - earth metal atoms like @xmath10sr and @xmath11yb is driven by suitably chosen laser field , which is used to give an effective @xmath14 hybridization between local electrons and conduction ones in pam .",

    "[ fig : scheme ] . ) here , electronic excited state mimics the local f - electron and the ground state represents the conduction electron but without spin degree of freedom .",

    "combining these elements is able to provide a potential scheme to simulate pam with proper tuning of experimental parameters as proposed for klm and have done in fermionic hubbard model@xcite .",
    "we should emphasize that in contrast to usual pam in condensed matter physics , because external trapping potential always exists in optical lattice system , pam in cold atom simulation has to be supplemented with such ( harmonic ) trapping potential , whose simulation proposal and calculation are not reported in existing literature but are achieved in this work .",
    "interestingly , the general @xmath3 version of pam is able to be realized in our proposal .",
    "although the heavy fermion materials with unfilled f - shell usually have such large degeneracy and the widely - used large-@xmath4 expansion is controllable in this artificial limit@xcite , the complex chemical environment in realistic materials obscures the underlying physics and the reliability of large-@xmath4 theory is questioned .",
    "in contrast , the purity and tunability of optical lattice system gives us an unique opportunity to directly detect the large - n physics of pam and inspect what has been captured by current theoretical understading .",
    "furthermore , since reachable temperature is comparatively high in present ultracold atom field , numerical simulations of dqmc and dmft provide the basic physics at such high temperature regime , where mott or orbital - selective mott phenomena is clearly seen in the spatial dependent density distribution and energy - sensitive density of state .",
    "importantly , these quantities are able to be measured by current cold atom techniques and future developments on alkaline - earth metal atoms are expected to realize the proposed pam and to detect its intriguing nature of quantum many - body interaction .",
    "extra laser field is applied to induce direct transition between electronic excited ( @xmath15 ) and ground ( @xmath16 ) state , e.g. @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2 ( nuclear zeeman state denoted by @xmath17 is intact ) which is able to simulate an effective hybridization @xmath6 between local electron and conduction electron in periodic anderson model .",

    "finally , sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] is devoted to a brief discussion and conclusion .",
    "the general second quantized hamiltonian for alkaline - earth metal atoms reads , @xmath18 where fermion field operator @xmath19 creates an atom at position @xmath20 with internal state @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 . here",
    ", @xmath24 or @xmath25 denotes electronic state @xmath0 ( ground state ) and @xmath2 ( excited state ) , respectively .",
    "furthermore , the nuclear zeeman states of alkaline - earth metal atoms are represented by @xmath26 .",
    "for example , @xmath10sr has @xmath27 , @xmath28yb has @xmath29 and @xmath11yb has @xmath30 .",
    "the external potential @xmath31 is provided by the optical lattice and both periodic potential and harmonic trapping potential are included .",
    "the energy shift of excited state to ground state is @xmath32 and @xmath33 are all interaction parameters .",
    "however , because the alkaline - earth metal atoms have a fully occupied outer shell and their total electron spin is zero , the conventional magnetic feshbach resonance does not work to tune the interaction between two atoms .",
    "fortunately , the newly proposed orbital feshbach resonance is able to tune the interaction in these alkaline - earth atom system and has been realized for @xmath11yb atom gas@xcite .",
    "we should point out that @xmath34 has been introduced by gorshkov et al . to describe a scheme for simulation of kondo lattice model@xcite , while the extra hamiltonian @xmath35 is added in the present work but is not covered in their original proposal .",
    "this extra term with coupling constant @xmath36 expresses a transition between excited and ground state ( e.g. @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2 ) of alkaline - earth metal atoms like @xmath10sr and @xmath11yb , which can be induced by extra laser field@xcite . here , generically , the coupling of different nuclear zeeman sub - level as @xmath37 is possible but we choose the simplest case @xmath38 with suitable driving laser frequency and polarization . in the following discussion",
    ", we can see that such extra term will lead to the realization of periodic anderson model since effective @xmath14 hybridization is induced by this direct transition . before leaving this issue , we note that if nearest - neighbor @xmath14 hybridization with spin - dependence can be realized , one expects the topological periodic anderson model is able to be explored@xcite , and the physics of the advocated topological kondo insulator may be inspected from this alternative point of view apart from real - life material smb@xmath12 .",
    "then , assuming only the lowest band is involved in our model and we expand @xmath39 where real wannier function @xmath40 is utilized and @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) destroys an atom located site @xmath43 with internal state @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) . inserting these equations into eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) leads to lattice hamiltonian as follows @xmath46 here , as often done in simulation of fermionic hubbard model@xcite , only nearest - neighbor hopping is considered and the harmonic trapping potential is not explicitly considered but will be added later .",
    "furthermore , the single center approximation , which means only interaction at the same site is considered @xmath47 with @xmath48 .    the parameters in the lattice model are related to original hamiltonian via @xmath49 where nearest - neighbor vector @xmath50 is defined .",
    "now , if we adjust @xmath51 via suitable feshbach resonance technique , the spin - spin exchange interaction @xmath52 , which is responsible for simulation of kondo lattice model , vanishes in this case .",
    "next , the local interaction @xmath53 and hopping @xmath54 can also be tuned to be small and thus neglected .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian reads @xmath55    after re - scaling hopping and chemical potential parameters as @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and re - explain fermion operator @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) as annihilation operator for conduction electron ( local f - electron ) with internal spin state @xmath17 , we arrive at the so - called @xmath3 periodic anderson model with spin degeneracy @xmath59@xcite : @xmath60 currently , the above @xmath3 model may be realized for cases with @xmath61 , which corresponds to @xmath28yb , @xmath11yb and @xmath10sr atom gases .",
    "although the heavy fermion materials with unfilled f - shell usually have such large degeneracy , the complex chemical environment in realistic materials obscures the underlying physics . moreover , large-@xmath4 expansion is widely utilized in heavy fermion community but the reliability of this theoretical tool is not clear as compared to experiments due to the mentioned complication@xcite .",
    "in contrast , the purity and tunability of optical lattice system gives us an unique opportunity to directly detect the large - n physics of pam .",
    "furthermore , if we are interested in the case with @xmath62 , where only two nuclear zeeman sub - levels are considered , the more familiar @xmath5 version is obtained @xmath63 with effective electronic spin @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "finally , a simplification can be made when @xmath68 is small compared to other energy scales and the system is far away from f - electron valence transition , then the standard pam reads @xmath69 because the alkaline(rare)-earth metal atom @xmath28yb has nuclear spin @xmath29 , it has potential to realize the @xmath5 pam in terms of this ultracold atom gas .    until here",
    ", we have not specified the lattice structure , which those ultracold atom gases are loaded onto .",
    "generally , one - dimensional chain , non - frustrated square , cubic and honeycomb lattice , frustrated triangular and kagome lattice have been realized in optical lattice systems@xcite .",
    "the discussion below will focus on one - dimensional chain and two - dimensional square lattice to give a physically transparent explanation of underlying physics and other more complex lattices are straightforward to explore but not shown in present work@xcite .",
    "the discussion of generic properties of pam eq .  ( [ eq7]@xmath70[eq9 ] )",
    "can be found in ref .   and",
    "the interested reader may refer to these references .    in current experiments of ultracold atom in optical lattice , particularly for realized fermionic hubbard model ,",
    "the achieved lowest effective temperature is about @xmath71@xcite .",
    "although both the previously discussed kondo lattice and our proposed periodic anderson model have not been realized in alkaline - earth metal atoms , we expect near - future experiments in this direct may reach similar temperature regime @xmath71 .",
    "actually , for @xmath72 , the system works at relatively high temperature regime since the typical low - energy spin interaction scale , namely kondo exchange coupling @xmath73 is usually smaller than @xmath9 for intermediate or large @xmath8 ( @xmath74 , @xmath75 ) .",
    "( the heavy fermion compounds have large @xmath8 compared to its band - width ) .",
    "this means @xmath76 , thus the corresponding kondo physics ( @xmath77 ) or more explicitly the lattice kondo effect can not be captured in our cases . at the same time , the competitor of kondo screening , the long - ranged rrry magnetic interaction ( @xmath78 ) , is still out of the detectable high temperature regime .",
    "although the mentioned low - temperature physics is beyond our reach , we still can observe many interesting phenomena in the high temperature regime , which is able to be detected by current cold atom techniques .",
    "for realistic cold atom system , the external trapping potential , which is usually approximated as harmonic potential to confine atoms , should be added in the models and may be simply considered as a site - dependent chemical potential as@xcite @xmath79 here , for simplicity , we have used the standard pam but the more involved @xmath3 version is readily to obtain .",
    "the harmonic trapping potential is now represented as @xmath80 with the central site as @xmath81 and possible anisotropy of this harmonic potential is neglected since no qualitative changes appear@xcite .    as studied in hubbard model with harmonic potential , mott physics without magnetism",
    "can be clearly seen in this system since charge excitation dominates when @xmath72@xcite . for pam in trapping potential like eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) , based on our deep understanding on uniform cases without external potential@xcite , we expect orbital - selective mott transition should emerge where mott localization develops only for f - electron while conduction electron is intact . if one only detects f - electron , this may be treated as mott physics for f - electron and in the remaining part of this paper , we use mott instead of more correct name orbital - selective mott by keeping their tiny difference in our mind .",

    "meanwhile , in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , we have also shown the variance of f - electron number at each site @xmath105 and its behavior agrees with the results from inspecting occupation number of f - electron @xmath106 , where charge fluctuation is heavily suppressed at central mott regime ( @xmath107 ) while large variance indicates metallic behaviors around edge parts .",
    "it is noted that even in the mott regime , the variance of f - electron number @xmath108 does not vanish since only when @xmath8 is infinite , the charge fluctuation is completely suppressed and gives @xmath109 .",
    "however , for systems with finite @xmath8 and located in mott insulating state , charge fluctuation still survives and a small but finite @xmath108 is expected . in our case , we observe @xmath110 in the central mott regime .    for @xmath97 system like square lattice as studied in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , to have a sensible central mott regime about @xmath111 sites , a large harmonic potential frequency @xmath101 is chosen in contrast to the @xmath84 chain case with @xmath91 , where most of sites are singly - occupied and show mott insulating behavior . obviously , if harmonic potential is turned off , only mott state exists in such unform background since the system is half - filling with present parameters , which can seen by inspecting @xmath112 and @xmath113 , e.g. in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] for a @xmath84 case .",

    "we note that site - resolved imaging of particle density distribution in fermionic mott insulator have been recently achieved for @xmath114li and @xmath115k@xcite , and our calculated spatial distribution of electrons may be a good guide for realization of pam in terms of alkaline - earth metal atom gases .",

    "in addition , if effective temperature of optical lattice can be further lowered , it will be interesting to study the low - energy / temperature lattice kondo physics and its corresponding two - fluid behavior@xcite , which is proposed to be core actor for almost all of low - temperature anomalous quantum phenomena .",
