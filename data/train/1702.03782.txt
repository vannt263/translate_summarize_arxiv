    "this paper concerns one - dimensional quasilinear reaction - diffusion pdes .",
    "we study the existence of monotone heteroclinic connections of traveling - wave type for reaction - diffusion equations with saturating and density - dependent diffusion , in presence of a convective term ; precisely , we deal with the equation @xmath0 ) - { \\partial}_x h(u ) + f(u ) , \\quad ( u = u(t , x)),\\ ] ] under a suitable set of assumptions ( see section [ sez2 ] ) . not to overload the notation and the readability of the paper , our main results will focus on the special case when @xmath1 is of mean curvature type , namely @xmath2 ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the presented results may hold true for a larger class of operators , as it will be pointed out later on in the paper .",
    "reaction - convection - diffusion type models like , with a special focus on traveling waves , are very popular and can be used to describe different mathematical and physical phenomena : the main areas of application , for which we quote a few references , are , for instance , neurophysics and biophysics @xcite , chemical physics @xcite , population genetics @xcite , tumor growth @xcite and mathematical ecology @xcite . as describing quite complicated realistic models ,",
    "most of the above applications concern systems of equations in higher dimensional spaces . inside this vast class , the fisher - kolmogorov - petrovsky - piskounov ( fkpp ) equation @xmath3 introduced by fisher @xcite to model the spread of an advantageous gene inside a @xmath4-dimensional population , and the viscous burgers equation @xcite @xmath5 finding application , for instance , in problems related to gas dynamics and traffic flows , are probably among the most popular . in the recent years , an increasing interest has been devoted , as well , to a `` combination '' of and , called _ fisher - burgers _ ( or _ burgers - fisher _ ) equation , which is obtained by setting @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 in equation ; this is perhaps the easiest example of pde taking into account both the reaction - diffusion and the convection effects .",
    "such an equation has been widely studied by means of both theoretical and numerical methods ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and represents the starting point of our investigation . in order to better set up our scheme and introduce our results for generalized fisher - burgers equations displaying saturating effects , we thus now start briefly reviewing the results which are available , in our perspective , for equations and . after its introduction @xcite (",
    "as pointed out , for instance , in @xcite , actually the investigation and analysis of traveling waves in chemical reactions is probably first due to luther @xcite ) , the fisher equation was widely studied , from a mathematical point of view , starting with the paper @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , it was meant to describe the evolution of the relative concentration of a gene inside a population ; under the natural assumption @xmath10 ( meaning that no reaction can be present if the gene is completely spread or not spread at all ) , it was already observed in these first articles the natural appearance of heteroclinic solutions connecting the equilibria @xmath11 and @xmath4 - we will call them _ @xmath12connections _ - of traveling wave type , embodying the transition from the situation where the gene is not present to the one where every individual possesses it . by standard phase - plane arguments ,",
    "it is immediate to see ( see , for instance , @xcite ) that such solutions are necessarily monotone ; it was then proved in @xcite that they also have some stability properties for a certain class of initial data . for a better comprehension of the model",
    ", it is thus natural to search first for solutions having the form @xmath13 , with @xmath14 an increasing function such that @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "the values of @xmath17 yielding such solutions are called _ admissible speeds _ , and it turns out that the set of the admissible speeds for equation is an unbounded interval @xmath18 ; @xmath19 takes the name of _",
    "critical speed_. for example , in the fisher case it is @xmath20 .",
    "later on , reaction terms other than the fisher one were studied : the most popular are the so called _ type b _ and _ type c _",
    "( according to the terminology in @xcite ) .",
    "the former has been considered in some combustion problems , while the latter appears naturally in biology ( see @xcite ) , in relation with the death rates of populations presenting different genotypes with respect to a particular gene , or in aggregative - diffusive models for population dynamics ( see , e.g. , @xcite for the case of a sign - changing diffusion ) . by some monotonicity arguments , for both of these situations ( see section [ sez4 ] below ) it may be seen that the admissible speed exists and is unique . on the other hand , the viscous burgers equation often appears as a simplification of more complicated models : a well known example is the one given by the navier - stokes equations , describing the dynamics of compressible or incompressible fluids .",
    "if we consider without the second order viscous term and with general flux function describing the convection phenomenon , it is well known that solutions with discontinuities ( called internal shocks ) are allowed in the class of the so called _ entropy solutions _ ; in particular , in order to provide uniqueness , it is common to assume the flux function to be convex ( for more details , see @xcite ) . on the other hand , when the viscosity is ",
    "switched on \" , all the discontinuities that appear at the hyperbolic level turn out into smooth transition layers . in this",
    "setting , smooth traveling wave solutions to the cauchy problem associated with have been extensively studied over the past years ; indeed , when looking for a solution of the form @xmath21 , equation can be explicitly solved by integration , leading to @xmath22 where @xmath23 ( @xmath24 being an integration constant ) , and @xmath25 .",
    "in particular , @xmath26 by definition , so that @xmath27 and represents a decreasing function connecting the values @xmath28 and @xmath29 . finally , it holds that @xmath30 meaning that , once the values @xmath31 and @xmath32 are chosen , there exists a unique @xmath33connection of traveling wave type , having speed @xmath17 .",
    "what we have described so far holds true when the diffusion is _",
    "linear_. however , assuming that a diffusive process in nature takes place in a homogeneous way , disregarding local biological and physical conditions ( both environmental - like light , humidity , temperature - and intrinsic in the behavior of the described population - e.g. , its density or concentration , its gradient , cf .",
    ", for instance , @xcite ) , seems to be quite a strong restriction .",
    "for instance , it may be more likely to imagine that individuals move from richly to scarcely populated areas , or , on the contrary , that under some conditions they tend to aggregate ( for instance under the risk of extinction ) , in opposition to a diffusion - type phenomenon .",
    "similarly , it may be expected that the diffusion relents once the gradient of the density becomes large , in view of a kind of blockage effect at too high gradients .",
    "of course , there are many ways of introducing such effects in a model , leading to different pictures for the considered problem ; many authors worked in this direction , part of the associated bibliography being available inside the references we mention at the end of the paper .",
    "our choice in the present article is to take into account a usual diffusion process ( towards less `` populated '' areas ) which depends on the population density and displays a saturation effect for large gradients ; explicitly , motivated , among the others , by the papers @xcite and @xcite , we consider a diffusion depending on @xmath34 through the mean - curvature type operator ( as the one considered in @xcite ) and possibly density - dependent . in any case",
    ", we warn the reader that modifying the assumptions in the diffusion makes possible , in principle , the appearance of other kinds of solutions which are not regular any more , since the functional space to appropriately set the problem into may include discontinuous functions ( for instance , in the case one is led to work in the space of bounded variation functions ) .",
    "however , we here disregard this issue , focusing since the beginning on regular traveling waves . as for the admissible speeds , and referring to the previous discussion about the fisher equation ,",
    "introducing a density - dependent and saturating diffusion may lead to some different outcomes with respect to the linear case .",
    "if , on one hand , the case of fisher - type nonlinearities like @xmath8 essentially displays the same features , on the other hand it may be seen that the situation changes when the reaction term is of type c : in the recent paper @xcite this was highlighted when dealing with the model @xmath35 namely equation with @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "let us also notice that , wishing to deal instead with a similar issue for the quasilinear counterpart of the burgers equation @xmath38 the situation is slightly different from the one for , since equation admits all the constants as equilibria .",
    "fixed two equilibria @xmath39 to be connected , in order to find monotone @xmath33-connections of traveling wave type @xmath21 one thus has to solve the boundary value problem @xmath40 asking @xmath41 for every @xmath42 ( or @xmath43 for every @xmath42 ) . integrating the differential equation on the real line and noticing that @xmath44 in view of the monotonicity , it is immediate to see that it has to hold @xmath45 so that there exists at most a unique @xmath46 giving a monotone @xmath33connection ; we stress that , in the burgers case @xmath9 , the previous condition is exactly ( and in this case @xmath43 for every @xmath42 ) .",
    "hence , here the picture is a bit different - actually , as we will see in section 3 , the situation is much more restrictive - and we can explicitly solve the problem , due to the particular form of the equation .",
    "it is thus natural to wonder which effect on the admissible speeds prevails when combining a nonlinear advection @xmath47 and a nonlinear forcing term @xmath48 in equation , together with a ( realistic ) saturating and density - dependent diffusion",
    ". this will be our main concern ; precisely , we study the problem @xmath49 ) ' - ( h'(v)+c)v ' + f(v ) = 0 \\\\ v(-\\infty)=u_- , \\ ; v(+\\infty)=u_+ , \\quad v'(s ) > 0 , \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] derived from the search for monotone heteroclinic traveling waves for , and we determine the set of the admissible speeds for different choices of @xmath48 , providing some numerical evidence , as well .",
    "complementarily , we also start investigating the admissible speeds in the small viscosity limit , analyzing the dependence of the critical speed on a small viscosity parameter braking the diffusion ( see section [ sez6 ] ) .    in this respect ,",
    "let us mention that the case without reaction was taken into account , e.g. , in @xcite ; on the other hand , the linear diffusion case with both a reaction and a convective term was analyzed , for instance , in @xcite , where it was shown that one could in general provide only an estimate of @xmath19 . in this framework ,",
    "the nonlinear ( but not saturating ) diffusion case has been studied in @xcite , as well as in @xcite for the case of porous media - type equations .",
    "finally , the specific case of the linear fisher - burgers equation , with particular emphasis on traveling waves , has attracted the interest of several authors in these last years ( we refer , as examples , to the previously mentioned papers @xcite ) .    for completeness ,",
    "let us also cite the paper @xcite , the monography @xcite , as well as the references @xcite for reviews and detailed explanation about density - dependent processes , and , as an example , the papers @xcite for the study of different boundary value problems for the mean - curvature operator .",
    "on the other hand , traveling waves for the fkpp equation have been largely studied , respectively , in association with porous media - type diffusions or when the diffusion process takes place on a riemannian manifold .",
    "far from being complete in the references , we quote , respectively , @xcite and @xcite , referring the reader to the references in these papers , as well .",
    "we close this introduction with a plan of the paper . in section [ sez2 ]",
    "we present the general procedure to reduce equation to the first order ; we here adapt to the presence of the nonlinear term @xmath50 the technique already exploited , for instance , in the papers @xcite .",
    "essentially , it consists in a suitable change of variables heavily relying on the fact that we search for _ monotone _ solutions . for our purposes",
    ", it is here crucial that the shape of the nonlinearity @xmath48 is invariant under `` rescalement '' by @xmath50 .",
    "even more , this may happen in presence of a wider class of operators ( see assumption @xmath51 in section [ sez2 ] )",
    ". section [ sez3 ] is the core of the paper and it is entirely devoted to the study of the admissible speeds for equation , assuming the reaction term to be positive on @xmath52 . in particular , the main result of the section is the following .",
    "[ ilprincipale ] let @xmath53 be a continuous and positive function and let @xmath1 be as in",
    ". moreover , let @xmath54 be a @xmath55-function such that @xmath56 , and @xmath57 be a continuous function such that @xmath58 exists , @xmath59 for every @xmath60 and @xmath61 , @xmath62 for every @xmath63 $ ] , for suitable constants @xmath64 ( notice that this implies @xmath10 ) .",
    "then , there exists @xmath65 , with @xmath66 } \\frac{d(u)f(u)}{u } } - \\min_{u \\in [ 0 , 1 ] } h'(u),\\ ] ] such that has a solution if and only if @xmath67 .    the proof is carried out by means of a shooting technique and lower - upper solutions , after having performed the change of variables described in section [ sez2 ] .",
    "we underline that theorem [ ilprincipale ] gives the same bound for the critical speed as in the linear case , and finds immediate application to the fisher - burgers equation .",
    "of course , such a bound may be negative , in principle , but for sure we have an unbounded set of positive admissible speeds .",
    "incidentally , we observe that the analysis of section [ sez3 ] can be easily extended to the case of suitable general convective terms of the form @xmath68 ( see , for instance , @xcite ) . on the other hand , in section [ sez4 ]",
    "we start taking into account reaction terms @xmath48 which are not positive in a right neighborhood of zero . in propositions",
    "[ possibileb ] and [ possibilec ] , we first give some sufficient conditions for the existence of a _ positive _ admissible speed . due to the presence of the convection",
    ", we observe as well the possible appearance of _ a unique negative _",
    "admissible speed ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , differently from @xcite ; at the same time , we are able to show examples where no admissible speeds exist .",
    "the numerical description of these two situations is the concern of section [ sez5 ] .",
    "finally , section [ sez6 ] is devoted to the study of equation in the small viscosity limit , meaning that we consider our problem with a small parameter @xmath69 in front of the diffusive term . using the results obtained in the previous sections ,",
    "we show that the positive critical speeds are proportional to @xmath69 .",
    "this result is meaningful in the spirit of the possible appearance of a phenomenon know as _ metastable dynamics _",
    ", as explained in details at the end of the section .",
    "in particular , we expect the speed rate of convergence of the time dependent solutions towards their asymptotic limits to be influenced by the  size \" of the viscosity , as already proved for the linear - diffusion case ( see , for instance , the pioneering article @xcite ) .",
    "these features are currently the object of our study , and may represent a possibly interesting follow - up of the present work .",
    "in this section , we introduce the main assumptions on the functions appearing in and we describe the change of variables needed in order to reduce such an equation to a first order ode , when looking for monotone traveling waves .",
    "we will underline the differences with respect to the case when @xmath36 , referring the reader , e.g. , to the presentation given in @xcite for the general procedure .",
    "we focus on the partial differential equation @xmath70 ) - \\partial_x h(u ) + f(u),\\ ] ] and we assume the following hypotheses :    * @xmath71 is a @xmath55-function such that @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 for every @xmath75 , and @xmath76 , for suitable constants @xmath77 ; moreover , @xmath78 * @xmath79 \\to \\mathbb{r}$ ] is a @xmath55-function such that @xmath80 and there exist @xmath81 with @xmath82;\\ ] ] * @xmath83 \\to \\mathbb{r}$ ] is a @xmath55-function such that @xmath56 ; * @xmath84 \\to \\mathbb{r}$ ] is a @xmath55-function such that @xmath10 and there exists @xmath85 with @xmath86    a couple of comments are in order .",
    "first , hypothesis @xmath87 expresses the concept of saturating diffusion ; the monotonicity of @xmath1 ensures the possibility of performing the change of variables below , while @xmath73 will be useful for the estimate below , as we explain in remark [ ilcurvatura ] .",
    "finally , assumption ensures that @xmath88 defined in below presents a singularity , as is the case for the curvature operator . concerning the last assumption , we have required for simplicity that @xmath89 , but many of the results we state ( as we have already seen in the statement of theorem [ ilprincipale ] )",
    "can be given under weaker assumptions , with minor changes .",

    "once the existence of a steady state @xmath459 for such a problem is proved , there is a broad range of techniques to investigate its stability / instability .",
    "as usual , one could linearize the original system around the steady state , and subsequently perform a spectral analysis in order to study the exact location of the eigenvalues . another possible way could be to try to find a lyapunov functional for the original equation ; here the main difficulty is to deal with the sign of the solution at the boundary when computing the time derivative of the lyapunov functional . in possible association with these issues ,",
    "the stability properties of the traveling waves found in the previous sections may be investigated , as well . to the best of our knowledge , for this problem such directions have not been rigorously studied yet in literature , and this will be the object of a future investigation .",
