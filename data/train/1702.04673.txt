    "recently , magnetic nanoparticles ( mnps ) have been studied for many biomedical applications such as magnetic particle imaging , separation of biological targets , immunoassays , drug delivery , and hyperthermia treatment @xcite . in these applications the magnetic moment may rotate within the particle with respect to some crystal axis - i.e. nel relaxation - and move along with the particle with respect to the liquid , i.e. brownian relaxation .",
    "hyperthermia , for instance , is based on the fact that power is absorbed locally by the mnp when placed in an applied oscillating magnetic field .",
    "a high absorption rate is achieved if both nel relaxation and brownian relaxation contribute @xcite .    on the other hand",
    "if the anisotropy energy is large compared to the thermal energy nel relaxation becomes unimportant . in this limit",
    "the mnp can be considered as a rigid body ( rb ) having a constant magnetic moment firmly attached to it . in this rigid dipole model ( rdm )",
    "the external driving field will create a torque to the magnetic moment which is transferred to the rb . in a rotating magnetic field , for instance",
    ", the mnp will rotate as well .",
    "theoretically the dynamics of mnps has been studied in recent years in very many papers for the case that the particles are fixed in space .",
    "the dynamics is then reduced to that of magnetic moments in external fields for which the stochastic landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation as introduced by brown @xcite is often used .",
    "this approach has gained increased interest recently because of its application to magnetic single - domain particles . in these mnps",
    "the magnetic moments within the particles are firmly tied together making it possible to describe the magnetic moment of the particle as one macro spin of constant length @xcite .",
    "its dynamics is expected to be well described by a classical approach .",
    "the dynamics of these macro spins is greatly influenced by thermal fluctuations originated from coupling of the spins to the surrounding medium ( the heat bath ) .",
    "additionally , for mobile particles brownian relaxation has to be taken into account @xcite .",
    "recently the dynamical properties of mobile particles have been studied in some detail in connection with biological applications , i. e. the realization of homogeneous biosensors @xcite based on the response of a suspension of mnps to an applied @xmath0 magnetic field . in these biological applications",
    "a dilute suspension of mnps is present the physical properties of which are determined to a large extend by the magnetic and mechanical dynamics of independent mnps .",
    "quite recently biosensors were proposed @xcite which are based on the response of mnps with brownian dynamics to rotating magnetic fields , i.e. to differences in the phase lag between the rotating magnetic moment and the driving field in order to determine the changes in hydrodynamic volume caused by analytes bound to the surface of the mnps . for this method to be successful ,",
    "it is necessary to quantitatively clarify the dynamics of mnps in rotating fields .",
    "theoretical studies on this problem reported in ref .",
    "@xcite are based on an effective field method ( efm ) @xcite for the dynamics of an ensemble of mnps treated as rigid dipoles placed in a viscous medium .",
    "the efm was derived from a fokker - planck equation ( fpe ) describing the rotational dynamics at finite temperatures .",
    "results obtained for the case that the applied field rotates were compared with measurements of the phase lag @xcite revealing a reasonable agreement between the measured and calculated values in the low frequency regime and for small field amplitudes .",
    "however , significant discrepancies were observed outside this regime .",
    "numerical calculations based directly on the fpe for the rigid dipole model @xcite confirmed these findings so that a need for further theoretical work persists .",
    "in the present paper we therefore study the dynamics of mobile mnps driven by a rotating magnetic field in order to contribute to an understanding of the physics underlying the functionality of the class of biosensors mentioned @xcite .",
    "the ensemble of mnps is described by a set of kinetic equations proposed earlier @xcite for the dynamics of mobile particles treating brownian and nel dynamics on equal footing .    in the first part of the paper",
    "we discuss briefly our kinetic equation @xcite and present numerical results for the dynamics of mnps with finite uniaxial anisotropy driven by rotating magnetic fields .",
    "evidence is given to the expected blocking of the magnetic moment to the anisotropy axis for large enough anisotropy energies .",
    "the relation between our kinetic equations and the rdm is discussed and it is shown how the rdm emerges from our kinetic equations .    in the second part of the paper we discuss in detail the rdm and sketch the derivation of the basic equations of the efm @xcite .",
    "we show that for the special case of an applied rotating magnetic field these equations can be solved without further assumptions .",
    "analytic formulas are obtained for the phase lag and for the magnetic moment and it is shown that these results are in nearly perfect agreement with results which follow from numerical solutions of the fpe .",
    "the analytic formulas derived are not restricted to small magnetic fields and/or frequencies and are therefore important for applications .",
    "a nano particle considered in the present paper is modeled as a uniformly magnetized spherical rigid body ( rb ) with uniaxial magnetic anisotropy .",
    "the particle can rotate in a viscous medium .",
    "its orientation in space is described by a time dependent unit vector @xmath1 parallel to the anisotropy axis of the rb .",
    "this vector is firmly attached to the rb so that its equation of motion is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes the angular velocity of the rb .",
    "the differentiation in eq .",
    "( [ e : n_punkt ] ) is performed in a coordinate system fixed in space , the laboratory frame .",
    "the magnetic moment @xmath4 of the np with constant magnitude @xmath5 can rotate in space along with the rb and can also rotate relative to it depending primarily on the strength of the anisotropy energy @xmath6 of the np .",
    "we introduce @xmath7 , an unit vector in the direction of the magnetic moment , @xmath8 . for @xmath7 and for the angular velocity @xmath3 of the rb kinetic equations",
    "were proposed in @xcite which can be written in compact form as @xmath9 and @xmath10 the effective field @xmath11 entering eq.(2 ) consists of the external driving field @xmath12 which may be time dependent , a term proportional to the anisotropy energy @xmath6 and a stochastic field @xmath13 relevant at elevated temperatures , @xmath14    the quantity @xmath15 appearing in eq.(2 ) is the dimensionless damping parameter usually used in the literature @xcite , @xmath16 denotes the friction coefficient usually expressed as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the dynamical viscosity while @xmath19 with radius @xmath20 denotes the hydrodynamic or total volume of the particle , i.e. it is assumed that the particle consists of a magnetic core region of volume @xmath21 with radius @xmath22 eventually covered by a nonmagnetic surfactant layer .    for the thermal fluctuations introduced above it",
    "is assumed as usual that they are gaussian distributed with zero mean .",
    "their correlators are chosen in such a way that in equilibrium boltzmann statistics is recovered .",
    "this leads to@xmath23 for the magnetic field fluctuations @xcite and @xmath24 for the brownian rotation @xcite .",
    "the angular brackets denote averages over @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively , and @xmath27 and @xmath28 label cartesian components of the fluctuating fields .    for given fluctuating fields @xmath29 and @xmath30 the quantities @xmath1 and @xmath31 as solutions of the stochastic equations are trajectories on the unit sphere because the equations of motion conserve the length of these vectors .",
    "physical quantities of interest describing properties of an ensemble of identical particles are obtained as averages over these trajectories .",
    "the reduced magnetic moment at finite temperatures , for instance , is given by @xmath32    eqs .",
    "( 1 - 6 ) constitute a closed set of kinetic equations for the quantities @xmath1 , @xmath31 and @xmath33 specifying the dynamics of the mnp . in deriving these equations",
    "we were guided by the requirement that for the isolated particle the total angular momentum @xmath34 has to be conserved irrespectively of internal interactions within the mnp .",
    "here , @xmath35 denotes the angular momentum and @xmath36 the spin momentum , @xmath37 , where @xmath38 denotes the gyromagnetic ratio . for more details",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "the kinetic equations proposed treat the dynamics of the magnetic moment and the rotational motion of the np on the same footing . in general , both processes are coupled leading to a rather complex behavior . in the limit of a large anisotropy energy , however , it is expected that the magnetic moment is locked into a position parallel to the anisotropy axis of the rb .",
    "this limiting case is the essence of the rigid dipole model .      using our kinetic equations",
    "we investigate numerically the dependence of phase lag and induced magnetic moment on the anisotropy energy considering the anisotropy constant @xmath39 as being adjustable .",

    "the ensemble averaged quantities @xmath65 and @xmath66 are monitored .",
    "note that @xmath64 depends very much on parameters .    in the stationary state @xmath67 rotates around @xmath68 with the frequency of the driving field .",
    "a phase lag is observed between the direction of the rotating field and this rotating magnetic moment .",
    "the phase lag @xmath69 is obtained as the angel between @xmath65 and the direction of the driving field averaged over about @xmath70 particles in the ensemble followed by an average over about @xmath71 field cycles .",
    "1 shows the averaged phase lag as function of @xmath46 for three different magnetic radii @xmath22 of the mnp , @xmath72 @xmath73 nm ( circles , black),@xmath54 nm ( diamonds , blue ) and @xmath74 nm ( squares , red ) .    for large anisotropy energies",
    "it is observed that the phase lag becomes independent of the anisotropy energy which indicates that the moment is locked to the rb , i.e. it behaves like a rotating rigid dipole .",
    "this is directly confirmed by the observation that @xmath66 remains nearly parallel to @xmath67 ( not shown ) , i.e. magnetic moment and anisotropy axis rotate unisono .",
    "the rdm is studied in detail in the next sections .",
    "numerical results will be obtained some of which are shown as dashed horizontal lines in fig.(1 ) .",
    "they represent phase lag and magnetic moment , respectively , calculated within the rdm .",
    "obviously for large @xmath75 the values obtained from the rdm are approached asymptotically .",
    "a reduction of @xmath46 , on the other hand , leads to a sharp drop in the phase lag accompanied by a significant increase of @xmath28 . in this limit",
    "the moment adjusts nearly parallel to the driving field and rotates with the field while the rbs stop rotating in a coherent fashion .",
    "this follows from the time variation of @xmath66 ( not shown ) consisting of only small random variations around zero .",
    "in the course of this work we kept the temperature fixed at @xmath76 k. a variation of @xmath77 will effect in particular the nel relaxation time which depends on @xmath78 .",
    "we therefore expect that the value of @xmath39 at which the locking of the moment sets in will depend on @xmath77 .    the increase of @xmath28 when reducing the anisotropy energy sets in for values of @xmath46 for which the magnetic moment unlocks from the rb moving towards the direction of the field . in the extreme limit @xmath79",
    "the magnetic moment is only subjected to a tiny frictional torque resulting from the gilbert - damping @xmath15 . only for unrealistic high values of @xmath15 this torque is large enough to overcome the viscous damping necessary for the rb to rotate .",
    "the numerical results presented suggest that for large anisotropy energies our kinetic equations pass over to the rdm .",
    "this is supported by the following qualitative arguments .",
    "consider a rotating frame firmly attached to the rb in which the anisotropy axis is fixed .",
    "the time derivative @xmath80 can be split into two parts , @xmath81 where the second term in this equation is the time derivative in the rotating frame .",
    "comparison with eq.(2 ) shows that this time derivative is equal to the second term of eq.(2 ) so that @xmath82 describing the dynamics of a spin with a llg - type equation with effective field @xmath83 in the rotating frame . in this rotating frame the anisotropy axis",
    "therefore @xmath7 will settle nearly instantaneously parallel to the anisotropy axis and will stay there providing the anisotropy energy is much larger than the contributions from the driving field and from @xmath3 and that the temperature is such that thermal switching of @xmath7 does not take place .",
    "this means that after a ( short ) initial time ( @xmath84 will go to zero and we are left with @xmath85 note that this argument requires a finite gilbert damping @xmath15 . if the damping parameter is strictly zero there will be no relaxation towards the anisotropy axis so that a rather complex precessional motion results .",
    "thus for large anisotropy energy we are lead to eqs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 11 ) which constitute the basis of the rdm .",
    "further simplifications are possible .",
    "first we note that in the equation of motion for @xmath3 inertia effects can be ignored because of the small particle size combined with realistic values of @xmath16 so that one obtains @xmath86 eqs.(11 - 12 ) can be solved for @xmath87 with algebraic manipulations known from the llg - equation .",
    "the resulting equation for @xmath88 depends on the parameter @xmath89 , @xmath90 which is extremely small .",
    "it is suffice therefore to keep only the leading terms with respect to @xmath89 resulting in the well - known equation of motion for the dynamics of a magnetic np in the rigid dipole approximation , @xmath91 note that the fluctuating field @xmath13 entering eq.(12 ) can be shown to be negligible in lowest order in @xmath89 .",
    "the rigid dipole model became a matter of particular interest quite recently because of its potential for biomedical applications .",
    "the stochastic equation describing its dynamics at finite temperature , eq.(14 ) , can be studied numerically .",
    "an alternative is using the fpe which corresponds to this stochastic process .      for the rdm the probability density @xmath92",
    "is defined as @xmath93 where the angular brackets denote an average over all trajectories @xmath31 of eq .",

    "the averaged reduced magnetic moment , for instance , is given by @xmath99 the first moment of the probability density , which is equivalent to the average over thermal fluctuations , eq.(7 ) .",
    "it is easy to see that the boltzmann distribution @xmath100 is an equilibrium solution of eq.(16 ) . in general , however , exact solutions of the fpe are not known so that one has to rely on numerical solutions of the fpe or on approximations .    for a numerical solution of the fpe",

    "<S> the corresponding rigid dipole model is analyzed both numerically by solving the appropriate fokker - planck equation and analytically by applying an effective field method . in the special case of a rotating magnetic field applied analytic results are obtained in perfect agreement with numerical results based on the fokker - planck equation . </S>",
    "<S> the analytic formulas derived are not restricted to small magnetic fields or low frequencies and are therefore important for applications . </S>",
    "<S> the illustrative numerical calculations presented are performed for magnetic parameters typical for iron oxide . </S>"
