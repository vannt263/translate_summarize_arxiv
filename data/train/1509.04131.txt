    "two parent resource theories of coherence ( we omit the quantum label , from now on ) have been recently developed @xcite . in the first picture ,",
    "coherence has been identified as the degree of uncertainty about the value of an observable @xmath0 while performing a measurement on the state @xmath1 , or equivalently the sensitivity of the state to a phase shift generated by @xmath0 @xcite .",

    "@xmath2-asymmetry _ , and an operational meaning has been provided : the asymmetry of a quantum state @xmath1 quantifies its ability to be a reference frame under a phase superselection rule , where @xmath0 is the observable whose coherent superpositions are prohibited ( e.g. electric charge , energy ) .",
    "an alternative resource theory defines the coherence of @xmath1 as its distinguishibility from the sets of states which are diagonal in a given basis @xcite . also , further studies bridged the gap between these recent theoretical findings and the experimental practice of quantum information processing , by providing a strategy to measure the amount of coherence of an arbitrary quantum state in the laboratory with the current technology @xcite ( for coherence witnesses , see @xcite ) .",
    "these results opened the way to investigate the role of coherence in characterizing the quantum properties of multipartite systems .",
    "in particular , the relationship between coherence and quantum correlations has been explored @xcite .",
    "+ in this work , we embrace the viewpoint identifying coherence with asymmetry , and we show that detecting coherence in states of multipartite qubit systems allows to witness entanglement .",

    "entanglement is hard to be quantified in both theoretical and experimental practice @xcite . on this purpose ,",

    "these quantities can be evaluated by interferometric measurement networks @xcite as well as alternative schemes @xcite by a limited number of measurements , without performing full state reconstruction . in sec.[sect2b ] , we show that the coherence lower bound witnesses entanglement and genuinely multipartite entanglement when measured with respect to additive multipartite observables .",

    "we draw our conclusions in sec.[sect4 ] .",
    "in the resource theory of coherence ( @xmath2-asymmetry ) @xcite , the consumable resource is any system whose state is not commuting with a fixed bounded observable @xmath0 with spectral decomposition @xmath3 .",
    "the systems in the incoherent states @xmath4 such that @xmath5=0 $ ] are free , in the sense that they can be arbitrarily added or discarded in a quantum protocol without degrading or increasing the available coherence .",
    "these states are invariant under phase rotations generated by @xmath0 : @xmath6 .",
    "the incoherent operations are the cp ( completely positive ) maps @xmath7 which can not increase the amount of coherence in a state .",
    "they satisfy @xmath8 , while their explicit form is studied in @xcite .",
    "several quantifiers of coherence have been proposed @xcite . here",
    "we employ the quantum fisher information @xcite .",
    "let us recall its definition .",
    "given the spectral decomposition of a probe state @xmath9 and an observable @xmath0 , the quantum fisher information @xmath10 quantifies the sensitivity of the probe to a phase shift @xmath11 generated by the observable @xmath0 , under the assumption that the state changes smoothly .",
    "the fisher information is ( four times ) the convex roof of the variance @xmath12 , meaning that @xmath13 , where the infimum is taken over all convex decompositions of @xmath14 such that the @xmath15 form a probability distribution @xcite .",
    "moreover , a decomposition saturating the equality always exists .",
    "this convex roof property implies , in particular , that @xmath16 is convex in the state @xmath17 , and reduces to the variance for pure states @xmath18 . as the quantum fisher information is a reliable measure of coherence @xcite , one has @xmath19=0 , \\forall \\rho$ ] and @xmath20 .",
    "picking the fisher information as a measure of coherence is useful for experimental purposes .",
    "even though there is no known measure of coherence which can be directly quantified in the laboratory @xcite , and the quantum fisher information is usually hard to be computed , it is possible to build up an observable quantity which provides nontrivial lower and upper bounds : + @xmath21 ^ 2]=4 \\text{tr}[\\rho^2 k^2 - \\rho k \\rho k]\\nonumber.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the lower bound has been proven in @xcite . observing that @xmath22 d \\theta$ ] , where @xmath23 , d_{hs}^2=||\\rho-\\sigma||_2 ^ 2 $ ] are the squared bures and hilbert - schmidt distances @xcite , and by recalling the inequality @xmath24 @xcite , the upper bound holds . for pure states , one has @xmath25 .",
    "the bounds are faithful as @xmath26 .",
    "from now on , we focus on the lower bound .",
    "+ one may wonder if the bound @xmath27 is a consistent measure of coherence by itself .",
    "for pure states the lower bound equals the quantum fisher information , so the answer is positive in such a case .",
    "unfortunately , this does not hold for mixed states .",
    "we can see that with a simple example . given a bipartite state @xmath28 ,",
    "let us suppose to measure the coherence of the marginal state @xmath29 as the uncertainty measuring @xmath30 .",
    "one obtains @xmath31 $ ] .",
    "then , discarding the subsystem @xmath32 would increase the coherence of the state @xmath29 , which is manifestly undesirable .",
    "one may normalize the quantity by employing @xmath33 $ ] as a measure of coherence , yet there would still be a problem .",
    "note that @xmath27 is written ( modulo a constant ) as a hilbert - schmidt norm .",
    "this function is notoriously not contractive under quantum operations @xcite .",
    "not surprisingly , this property also makes measures of quantum correlations based on this norm generally unreliable @xcite .",
    "the bound @xmath27 , while being not a full - fledged measure , can replace the fisher information for investigations in settings where some assumptions are allowed , e.g. if the system is closed or if the system is open but the purity of the global system is fixed .",

    "we need to evaluate the purity and the overlap of the state of interest with the state after a rotation has been applied , see eq.[app ] .",
    "they are measurable by methods based on controlled operations and parity measurements , e.g. ideal for optical setups @xcite .",
    "in fact , they are obtained by estimating the mean value of the swap operator @xmath52 applied to the two state copies @xmath53 : @xmath54=\\text{tr}\\big[v(\\rho\\otimes\\rho)\\big]$ ] , while the overlap is given by @xmath55=\\text{tr}\\big[v\\big(\\rho\\otimes u_{k}\\rho{u_{k}^{\\dagger}}\\big)\\big].$ ] thus , for states of arbitrary dimensional systems , just two measurements are needed to detect coherence . whenever high - dimensional controlled gates are not implementable , alternative schemes have been designed @xcite .",
    "it is often desirable to consider a high dimensional system as a partition of subsystems .",
    "such a partition is usually dictated by the physical constraints of the problem , for example the spatial separation between the parts of the system .",
    "it is then interesting to understand the interplay between coherence with respect to a global observable and the quantum properties of the subsystems . in spite of being a basis - dependent feature , quantum coherence",
    "is linked to basis - independent features of multipartite systems as quantum correlations @xcite . here",
    "we show that , for an @xmath34-qubit system , the observable coherence bound @xmath56 measured on the global system state witnesses entanglement between the partitions .",
    "there are several entanglement witnesses written in terms of the quantum fisher information related to phase shifts generated by additive spin hamiltonians @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "in particular , a constraint which can not be satisfied by @xmath58-separable states of @xmath34 qubits is @xmath59 , where @xmath60 . verifying this relation thus witnesses entanglement and genuine @xmath58-partite entanglement @xcite .",
    "also , if @xmath61 , then the state is entangled .",

    "then , one evaluates the purity and the overlap trace terms related to the observables @xmath67 by applying the unitary transformations @xmath68 and measuring the ancilla polarisation by means of an interferometric scheme .",
    "this consists of an ancilla in the initial state @xmath69 interacting with the two state copies by a controlled-@xmath70 gate , being @xmath70 the swap operator .",
    "a hadamard gate @xmath65 is finally applied to the ancilla .",
    "the mean value of the ancilla polarisation at the output is @xmath71=   \\text{tr}[\\rho   u_{j_k}(\\theta)\\rho   u^{\\dagger}_{j_k}(\\theta)]$ ] , which determines the coherence lower bound.,width=302,height=302 ]    .theoretical values of the quantum fisher information , its observable bound , and the conditions witnessing entanglement , for the spin observables @xmath67 , in @xmath72 .",
    "the coherence lower bound is an entanglement witness almost as efficient as the quantum fisher information , being blind to entanglement only for @xmath73 , [ 0.646,0.772]$ ] and to tripartite entanglement for @xmath74 $ ] .",
    "note that a more general sufficient condition for genuine tripartite entanglement is @xmath75 , and for ghz - diagonal states , this is also a necessary condition @xcite . from this , @xmath72 is three - partite entangled when @xmath76 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     here we apply our scheme to simulate the detection of coherence and entanglement in a three - qubit state . for our convenience ,",
    "we choose a ghz - diagonal state @xmath77 as a probe for our test .",
    "this choice allows to investigate the behavior of our coherence lower bound and entanglement witness in the presence of noise in the probe .",
    "the two copies of the ghz diagonal state @xmath78 are obtained by initializing a six qubit processor in @xmath79 $ ] and applying hadamard and cnot gates as described in fig.[complete ] . + we measure the coherence of the probe state with respect to the set of spin observables @xmath80 by evaluating @xmath81 of eq.[app ] for each observable .",
    "of course , we may evaluate the coherence with respect to any self - adjoint operator in the three - qubit hilbert space .",
    "this is done by implementing the unitary gate @xmath68 on a copy of the state and then performing the polarisation measurements on an ancillary qubit by building up an interferometric configuration ( fig.[complete ] ) , whose outcomes allow to determine @xmath82 and its standard deviation @xmath83 . for the phase shifts ,",
    "we pick the small angle @xmath84 , e.g. an experimentally plausible value .",
    "obviously , to evaluate the purity , no gate has to be applied , @xmath85 .",
    "the results determine the values of @xmath86 $ ] and therefore of @xmath87 .",
    "no further action is necessary to verify the presence of entanglement through the witnesses in eq.[witness ] , as the values of @xmath88 are obtained in the previous steps . for @xmath89 , we have @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",

    "[ theory ] .",
    "in this work , we provided an experimental recipe to witness entanglement by detecting coherence in multipartite systems . to quantify coherence , we employed the quantum fisher information and a faithful , experimentally friendly coherence lower bound .",
    "the scheme is suitable for detection of coherence in large scale quantum registers , as it requires a limited number of measurements regardless the dimension of the system under scrutiny with an approximation determined by eq.[app ] .",
    "we showed that in multipartite states the coherence lower bound with respect to additive observables is a witness of multipartite entanglement .",
    "our results suggest further lines of investigation . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", the lower bound @xmath27 is to date not only the most generally employable , but the _ only _ faithful experimental quantifier of coherence for finite dimensional systems .",
    "thus , on the experimental side , we call for a demonstration of our study . on the theoretical side , we observe that a quadratic ( @xmath92 ) sensitivity to phase shifts generated by additive hamiltonian in @xmath34-party systems , as measured by the quantum fisher information , has been associated to another elusive quantum effect , i.e. quantum macroscopicity @xcite .",
