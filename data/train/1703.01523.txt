    "in particle physics the renormalization group is used for the study of the asymptotic properties of the theory  @xcite .",
    "the renormalization group equations ( rge ) for the standard model  @xcite is a set of coupled nonlinear differential equations , derived perturbatively , for the parameters of the theory ( couplings and masses ) .",
    "the full set of rge for the standard model is known up to two loops  @xcite and some partial results are known at higher orders ( see  @xcite and references therein ) . there are no known exact solutions of the full set of rge for the standard model and only some partial results were obtained . at one loop , equations for the gauge couplings decouple and are solved exactly , but at two loops this is not the case .",
    "another approach , is to use the hierarchy of the parameters of the standard model , keeping only certain powers of the quark and lepton masses and of @xmath9 of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix  @xcite .",
    "in such a way one obtains the exact solutions of the approximate equations  @xcite .",
    "the most precise analysis of the renormalization group evolution of the standard model is done by numerical methods , which give very precise predictions for the evolution of the couplings , masses and ckm matrix parameters .",
    "the aim of this paper paper is to find relations between the parameters of the standard model that remain constant ( or are slowly varying ) during the renormalization group evolution .",
    "we start with one loop equation and find an _ exact _",
    "constant for the quark masses and gauge couplings .",
    "next we consider a lepton sector and find that with great accuracy ( @xmath10 ) the charged lepton masses flow proportionally to the @xmath11 .",
    "for the two loop case we find two generalizations of the one loop constant for quarks and one for leptons .",
    "the study of the renormalization group invariants in the standard model and its extensions has been done before , see e.g. ,  ref  @xcite ( and references therein ) , where such invariants were studied for the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model .",
    "the invariants in the lepton sector were analyzed in  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite an approximation of two flavors was used to simplify the problem of the analysis of complicated non linear equations . recently",
    ", such invariants were analyzed within the powerful scheme of the flavor invariants in the minimal flavor violating extension of the standard model  .",
    "one should notice that all these attempts have been limited to the one loop renormalization group equations .",
    "our approach is different : we directly analyze the structure of the renormalization group equations , first at the one loop level and then at two loops .",
    "the invariant relations are the result of such analysis in the quark and lepton sectors .    in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] we briefly recall the renormalization group equations for the standard model . next in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] we derive and discuss an _ exact _ constant of evolution for the quark masses and gauge couplings . in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] we consider the two loop case for the quark section and derive two expressions with very slow flow . in sec .",
    "[ sec:5 ] we analyze slowly varying expressions in the lepton sector for one and two loop equations .",
    "we discuss our results in sec .",
    "[ sec:6 ] .",
    "we also include an appendix , where we derive an equation needed in our analysis .",
    "the standard model has the following set of parameters @xmath0 , @xmath7 , @xmath1  gauge couplings , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14  yukawa couplings of the up and down quarks and of the leptons , @xmath15 , @xmath16  higgs quartic coupling and mass parameter .",
    "frequently the higgs field vacuum expectation value @xmath17 is used instead of @xmath16 .",
    "all these parameters are functions of the renormalization point energy and fulfill the renormalization group equations , which have the following generic form for a parameter  @xmath18 @xmath19 here @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the renormalization point energy .",
    "the @xmath22 is the @xmath23-function , which describes the evolution of the parameter  @xmath18 .",
    "the @xmath22  function depends on all the parameters of the theory , but does not depend explicitly on the renormalization point energy  @xmath24 .",
    "the @xmath23-functions are calculated perturbatively and @xmath25 is its contribution at the @xmath26-loop level .",
    "the @xmath23-functions of the gauge and yukawa couplings and of the higgs field vacuum expectation value  @xmath17 have the property that they can be factorized in the following way @xmath27 this means that the renormalization group equation for the standard model have the following form    [ eq:3 ] @xmath28    yukawa couplings @xmath29 are complex matrices @xmath30 , so eq .   is a matrix differential equation .",
    "yukawa couplings @xmath31 couple to the left- and right - handed quarks .",
    "let us observe that the diagonalization of the matrix @xmath31 by a biunitary transformation requires also the knowledge of the right diagonalizing matrix , which is not related to any observable of the standard model .",
    "for this reason it is more convenient to use the matrices @xmath32 which are hermitian and are diagonalized by the left diagonalizing unitary matrices . which are related to the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix .",
    "it follows from eq .   that the matrices @xmath32 fulfill the following differential equation @xmath33 and the symbol @xmath34 means here the hermitian conjugate matrix .",
    "the one loop approximation consists in keeping only the terms @xmath35 on the right hand side of eqs .   and",
    ", the two loop approximation consists in keeping the terms @xmath35 and @xmath36 on the right hand side of eqs .   and  , etc .",
    "the explicit form of the one loop @xmath37 functions for the gauge and yukawa couplings and for the higgs field vacuum expectation value  @xmath17 is the following    [ eq:5 ] @xmath38    now let us analyze the rge for the @xmath39 matrices couplings . from eq .",
    "we know that they are the first order ordinary differential matrix equations of very specific form discussed in  [ app : a ] . from this discussion",
    "it follows that one can derive equations for the determinant of the @xmath40 and @xmath41 matrices :    [ eq:6 ] @xmath42    thus , taking into account eqs .  , and   we obtain at the one loop level @xmath43 now , from eqs .",
    "and   we have @xmath44 and eq .",
    "can be rewritten as @xmath45 this means that the following function of the parameters of the standard model is constant upon the renormalization group evolution @xmath46    let us now express the constant in eq .   in terms of observables .",
    "the eigenvalues of the hermitian matrices @xmath47 are the squares of the eigenvalues of the yukawa coupling matrices , corresponding to the up- and down- quarks @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the determinants of @xmath40 and @xmath41 are thus equal @xmath50 the quark masses are equal @xmath51 taking into account eqs .   and   the evolution constant from eq .   can be rewritten in terms of the quark masses and gauge couplings @xmath52",
    "thus @xmath53 defined below is the one loop constant of the renormalization group evolution @xmath54      we will now display the evolution of the constant @xmath53 from eq .  , using the evolution of the parameters @xmath55 and  @xmath56 obtained from the numerical solution of the one and two loop renormalization group equations .",

    "the @xmath53 relation at the two loop solution of the renormalization group equations is not constant , what mathematically is expected , because @xmath53 was derived from the one loop equations .",
    "however it is rather surprising that the variation is so large , more that  15% .",
    "we will discuss it later after the analysis of the two loop equations .",
    "relation ( which is constant at the one loop level ) normalized to @xmath58 at @xmath57 .",
    "the line labeled `` one loop solution '' has been drawn using the numerical solution of the renormalization group equations at the _ one _ loop level .",

    "[ fig:1 ] ]",
    "the evolution of the constant @xmath53 , at one loop level , given in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] shows that @xmath53 is not constant for the two loop solution of the renormalization group equations .",
    "unfortunately the two loop equations are too complicated to derive analytically another quantity that might be constant .",
    "however , we will analyze the situation and we will introduce some improvements .    from eq .",
    "generalized to two loops it follows that @xmath59 @xmath60 here @xmath15 is the higgs quartic coupling . the right hand side of eq .",

    "now , inserting eqs .   into eq .   and",
    "moving all derivatives to the left hand side we obtain @xmath65 @xmath66 using eq .",

    "one can see that the variation of @xmath78 in the whole range of energy is approximately 0.1% , so with great accuracy one can say that @xmath78 behaves like a constant .     given in eq .   for electron , @xmath21 and  @xmath75 .",

    "this means that the dependence on @xmath7 of the product of quark masses cancels out .",
    "this cancellation is interesting , because it shows that the product of masses of all quarks depends only on electromagnetic and strong interactions .    for leptons",

    "has very small variation in the whole energy range , @xmath10 for the @xmath75 lepton and much smaller for electron and @xmath21 . from eq .",

    "the evolution of these constants , @xmath69 and @xmath68 , is shown in fig .  [ fig:2 ] and",
    "the variation of @xmath69 is of the order of  4% and that of @xmath68 is of the order of  1% . in the case of two loops",

    "this generalized expression @xmath78 describes the evolution of the charged lepton masses as functions of @xmath0 and  @xmath7 .",
    "the variation of @xmath78 is of the order of 0.1% and is very similar for all leptons ( see  fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] ) .    summarizing",
    ", we have found several relations between the quark and lepton masses and gauge couplings , which remain ( almost ) constant upon the renormalization group evolution .",
