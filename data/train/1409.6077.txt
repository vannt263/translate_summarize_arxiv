    "what is the standard model ? it is a model that describes the behaviors of the point - like particles such as the electrons , the photons , the quarks , etc .",
    "what is the standard model of all centuries @xcite ?",
    "we believe that the description of the point - like particles , the smallest units of matter in our universe , on the basis of the einstein s relativity principle and the quantum principle is so fundamental and also so complete and so consistent , that this standard model would stay there longer than the newton s classic era .    the entries in the quantum 4-dimensional minkowski space - time with force - fields gauge - group structure",
    "@xmath0 built - in from the very beginning mean the objects that have definitive properties both under the force group @xmath6 and under the lorentz group defining the quantum 4-dimensional minkowski space - time .",
    "what precisely is the difference between `` 4-dimensional minkowski space - time with the force - fields gauge - group structure @xmath7 built - in from the very beginning '' and just `` 4-dimensional minkowski space - time '' ? in the former ,",
    "every object must have the designated - group assignments while , in the latter , it could be any 4-dimensional object in the minkowski space - time .",
    "is the adjective necessary in this context ?",
    "we propose `` yes '' in the strictly mathematical sense .",
    "we have to do all these with extra care , since `` the standard model '' is the beginning of everything .",
    "there exist basically no spoken rules in writing the standard model . in the newton s classic era , different languages were developed for expressing ideas and things in a consistent and complete manner . in my search of the standard model , in the beginning",
    "it is not clear what i was searching for and after a period of successful searches i kept trying to spell out what the standard model really is .",
    "what is in the abstract of this paper , from the early version into the current one ( completely revised ) , is a good illustrative example .",
    "it is for the standard model of all centuries .    back in the 20th century",
    ", we did nt realized that there is something special for the complex scalar fields in the quantum 4-dimensional minkowski space - time . a complex scalar field",
    "@xmath8 is born to be self - repulsive , due to the @xmath9 interaction with the positive dimensionless coupling @xmath10 . with a negative @xmath10",
    ", the system will collapse .",
    "so , if alone , _ it can not exist . _    for the two complex scalar fields ,",
    "the attractive mutual interaction @xmath11 would be enough to overcome the self - repulsiveness of the two individual complex scalar fields .",
    "@xmath9 in fact writes the story for everything .    the story which we put forward above about the _ nonexistence _ of a single complex scalar field quite striking - whether it is right or not is still waiting for a clear - cut mathematical proof .",
    "basically , @xmath10 can not be negative since the system would collapse to the negative infinity .",
    "it can not be zero since this would be meta - stable .",
    "we suspect @xmath12 in our notations , but we should admit that it is still lack of rigorous proof .    another important question is this : why do we have the gauge bosons corresponding to the group @xmath6 and , among these , why is only the photon massless ? we think that we are not ready to answer a question like this - but eventually we would get enough hints for the final answer .    among the force fields or gauge fields ,",
    "most of the gauge fields , upon spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) , become massive , including weak bosons and family gauge bosons , if the standard wisdom is assumed . that calls for the standard - model ( sm ) higgs @xmath13 , the purely family higgs @xmath14 , and the mixed family higgs @xmath15 - they interact attractively whenever possible , i.e. , between @xmath13 and @xmath15 , and between @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "( the two numbers / labels are referred to @xmath16 and @xmath17 - that is , triplets , doublets , or singlets . )",
    "thus , these things provide the `` background '' of everything else .",
    "this is what we mean by the quantum 4-dimensional minkowski space - time with the force - fields gauge - group structure @xmath7 imprinted at the very beginning .",
    "so , if there would be only the sm higgs @xmath13 , then _ it can not exist .",
    "_ the self - repulsive interaction @xmath9 ( with @xmath18 ) would make it from existence . as said earlier",
    ", @xmath19 would be meta - stable while @xmath20 would collapse .",
    "the question is why it is @xmath12 , and that should be determined _ globally _ by the quantum 4-dimensional minkowski space - time , as this question does nt arise if _ not _ the quantum 4-dimensional minkowski space - time .",
    "the algebra among the three higgs @xmath13 , @xmath15 , and @xmath14 arises _ only _ when it is in the quantum 4-dimensional minkowski space - time .",
    "if the space - time differs from the 4-dimensional , the algebra simply does nt apply .",
    "it is rather strange ! !",
    "the next question associated with the higgs fields is to understand `` the origin of mass '' - a question that we have recently gained some understanding @xcite . in that @xcite , we may set all the mass terms of the various higgs to identically zero , except one spontaneous - symmetry - breaking ( ssb ) igniting term .",
    "all the mass terms are the results of this ssb , when switched on .",
    "therefore , the `` mass '' is the result of ssb - a generalized higgs mechanism .",
    "thus , when the temperature is higher than a certain critical temperature , the notion of `` mass '' does not exist .",
    "the set of the `` various '' higgs includes the standard - model ( sm ) higgs @xmath13 , the mixed family higgs @xmath15 , and the pure family higgs @xmath14 , where the first label refers to the group @xmath16 while the second the group @xmath17 .",
    "the ignition could be on the pure family higgs @xmath14 @xcite , and it is clear that that it may not be on the sm higgs @xmath13 .",
    "these related higgs , being the scalar fields , act as the systems of energies , self - interacting via dimensionless @xmath21 and interacting equivalently with other higgs .",
    "when the temperature is low enough , it becomes the `` mass '' phase , or the phase in which the particles have masses .",
    "the overall background in our world is the quantum 4-dimensional minkowski space - time with the force - field gauge - group structure @xmath0 imprinted at the very beginning .",
    "it sees the lepton world , of atomic sizes .",
    "it also sees the quark world , of much smaller nuclear sizes .",
    "thus , it is of importance to see that the @xmath22 symmetry is realized in the lepton world , through the proposal @xcite @xmath23 @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) as the @xmath16 triplet and @xmath17 doublet .",
    "it is also essential to complete the standard model @xcite by working out the higgs dynamics in detail @xcite .",
    "here it is important to realize the role of neutrino oscillations - it is the change of a neutrino in one generation ( flavor ) into that in another generation ; or , we need to have the coupling @xmath26 , exactly the coupling introduced by hwang and yan @xcite .",
    "then , it is clear that the mixed family higgs @xmath15 must be there .",
    "the remaining purely family higgs @xmath14 helps to complete the picture , so that the eight gauge bosons are massive in the @xmath16 family gauge theory @xcite .",
    "[ for consistency in our notations , it should be @xmath27 in the paper of hwang and yan @xcite . ]    with a complete standard model such as @xcite , we could address a few basic questions .",
    "after all , all `` building blocks of matter '' seem to be point - like particles ( point - like dirac particles if fermions ) , and vice versa . and nothing more . if quantum field theory ( qft ) can describe the nature , it should mean more - such as the various ultraviolet divergences , do they cancel out in some way ?",
    "see below on tests for a `` complete '' theory .    usually in an old textbook @xcite",
    ", the qcd chapter precedes the one on glashow - weinberg - salam ( gws ) electroweak theory , but we are talking about the @xmath0 minkowski space - time and what happens in it .",
    "the so - called `` basic units of motion '' are made up from quarks ( of six flavors , of three colors , and of the two helicities ) and leptons ( of three generations and of the two helicities ) .",
    "we use these basic units ( of motion ) in writing down the lagrangian , etc .",
    "- the starting point of our formalism(s ) .    if we look at the basic units of motion as compared to the original particle , i.e. the electron , the starting basic units are all `` point - like '' dirac particles .",
    "dirac invented the dirac equation for the electron eighty years ago and surprisingly enough these `` point - like '' dirac particles are the basic units of the standard model .",
    "thus , we call it `` dirac similarity principle '' - a salute to dirac ; a triumph to mathematics .",
    "our world could indeed be described by the proper mathematics",
    ". the proper mathematical language may be the renormalizable quantum field theory , as advocated in this paper .    for the lepton world or the quark world ,",
    "the story is fixed if the so - called `` gauge - invariant derivative '' , i.e. @xmath28 in the kinetic - energy term @xmath29 , is given for a given basic unit , one on one @xcite .    for the lepton world",
    ", we introduce the family triplet , @xmath30 ( column ) , under @xmath16 .",
    "since the minimal standard model does not see the right - handed neutrinos , it would be a natural way to make an extension of the minimal standard model . or , we have , for @xmath31 , @xmath32 and , for the left - handed @xmath16-triplet and @xmath17-doublet @xmath33 ( all columns ) , @xmath34 the right - handed charged leptons form the triplet @xmath35 under @xmath16 , since it were singlets their common factor @xmath36 for the mass terms would involve the cross terms such as @xmath37 .",
    "the neutrino mass term assumes a new form @xcite : @xmath38 where @xmath39 are the neutrino triplet just mentioned above ( with the first label for @xmath16 and the second for @xmath17 ) .",
    "the cross ( curl ) product is somewhat new @xcite , referring to the singlet combination of three triplets in @xmath40 .",
    "the higgs field @xmath27 is new in this effort , because it carries some nontrivial @xmath17 charge .",
    "note that , for charged leptons , the standard - model choice is @xmath41 , which gives three leptons an equal mass .",
    "but , in view of that if @xmath42 is an @xmath43 doublet then @xmath44 is another doublet , we could form @xmath45 from the doublet - triplet @xmath15 .",
    "the notations in @xmath13 , @xmath15 , and @xmath14 should be consistent and thus the @xmath27 , used in the above equation , should have the tilde operation , for the consistency in notations .",
    "so , we have @xcite @xmath46 which gives rise to the imaginary off - diagonal ( hermitian ) elements in the @xmath47 mass matrix , so removing the equal masses of the charged leptons .",
    "note that the couplings @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 all are dimensionless .",
    "the expressions for neutrino oscillations and the off - diagonal mass term are in @xmath51 , or curl - dot , product - it is allowed for @xmath40 .",
    "note that such coupling has nothing to do with the kinetic - energy term of the particle , though the coupling @xmath48 ( and @xmath52 ) might be related to the gauge coupling @xmath50 .",
    "we now turn our attention to the quark world , which our special gauge - group minkowski space - time supports .",
    "thus , we have , for the up - type right - handed quarks @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 , @xmath56 and , for the rotated down - type right - handed quarks @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 , @xmath60    on the other hand , we have , for the @xmath17 quark doublets , @xmath61    there are the standard way to generate mass for the various quarks .",
    "for these quarks , we use the `` old - fashion '' way as in the standard model , since quarks do not couple to the family higgs fields .",
    "we have , for the generation of the various quark masses , @xmath62 with the tilde s defined as before .    again , all the couplings in the quark world are dimensionless in the 4-dimensional minkowski space - time .",
    "surprisingly , the natural scale for the quark world is of fermi scales , which is five orders smaller that the natural scale of the lepton world , of atomic scales",
    ".    it might be essential to realize that the dimensionless couplings @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 ( hence @xmath66 ) , and @xmath50 ( in the strengths of the fundamental interactions ) and the dimensionless mass parameters @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 ( in describing the masses of point - like particles ) have a complete equal status in the philosophy of concepts .    the overall background , i.e. , the quantum 4-dimensional minkowski space - time with the force - fields gauge - group structure @xmath7 built - in from the outset , supports the `` dimensionless '' lepton world and it also supports the `` dimensionless '' quark world .",
    "it seems that there might be many elegant stories associated with the standard model ( of all centuries ) @xcite .",
    "we should present our reasonings which lead to the formulation of `` the origin of mass '' @xcite .",
    "it stresses that , before the spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) , the standard model does not contain any parameter that is pertaining to `` mass '' , but , after the ssb , all particles in the standard model acquire the mass terms as it should - a way to explain `` the origin of mass '' . in this way , we sort of tie `` the origin of mass '' to the effects of the ssb , or the generalized higgs mechanism .",
    "it is amusing to observe that it is so easy , by construction , to have the complex scalar fields but , among the building blocks of matter , the complex scalar fields are so rare .",
    "it seems to be much harder for two complex scalar fields in co - existence , as though they would be mutually `` repulsive '' .",
    "only if they belong to the `` same '' family , they might be mutually attractive .    in the 4-dimensional minkowski space - time",
    ", it is an amusing fact for the complex scalar field that the dimensionless interaction @xmath9 exists - we do nt know how to determine the dimensionless @xmath10 ; this might have to do with the 4-dimensional nature and maybe more . the determination of @xmath10 , that should be done _ a priori _ in the standard model , poses an important conceptional question .",
    "the reason that we try to write together a force - field minkowski space - time is that when put together the @xmath6 minkowski space - time ( that is already specific enough ) the complex scalar field @xmath69 in this space should have a specific @xmath10 in the dimensionless interaction @xmath9 . if we agree that a specific @xmath10 is needed , then there is the universal @xmath10 for the various complex scalar fields allowed in this force - field minkowski space - time .",
    "the complex scalar field(s ) should have the existence _ a priori_. [ these arguments sound fairly philosophical and logical ,",
    "but they are needed for clarification . ]    a complex scalar field in our space - time has the dimensionless coupling : @xmath70 the space - time integral of @xmath71 gives the action . in our 4-dimensional minkowski space - time , we find that @xmath12 numerically .",
    "this number should come out topologically ( after the normalizations of the various fields in a given space @xcite ) , although , at this point , we do nt know why this is the case .    if there are more than a complex scalar field , we should have @xmath72 there should be only one @xmath10 .    for the two related complex fields ,",
    "we propose to write @xmath73 to signify the mutual attraction on top of the universal repulsive interactions .",
    "now we return to the standard model of all centuries @xcite .",
    "we have the standard - model higgs @xmath13 , the purely family higgs @xmath14 , and the mixed family higgs @xmath15 , with the first label for @xmath16 and the second for @xmath17 .",
    "we need another triplet @xmath14 since all eight family gauge bosons are massive @xcite .",
    "it is clear that @xmath13 would interact with @xmath15 while @xmath14 would also interact with @xmath15 .",
    "these interactions should be attractive to explain why they are showing up together .",
    "we try to come back to the ground - zero point .",
    "thus , we may write down the general terms for potentials among the three higgs fields , subject to ( 1 ) that they are renormalizable , and ( 2 ) that symmetries are only broken spontaneously ( the higgs or induced higgs mechanism ) . we have @xcite    @xmath74    in doing the renormalization analysis of the three higgs fields , we realize that even if we start from the well - motivated lagrangian such as eq . ( 11 ) , it might spill over to the more generalized lagrangian such as eqs .",
    "( 12)-(16 )",
    ".    we might pay special attention to the so - called `` u - gauge '' ( unitary gauge ) . in the u - gauge ,",
    "every particle is a real particle ( not a ghost ) .",
    "we find it to be useful in the analysis of the situation with the spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) .",
    "for the quantum 4-dimensional minkowski space - time with the force - fields gauge - group structure @xmath6 built - in from the very beginning ( i.e. , the overall background ) , we have , in the u - gauge , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and eight massive family gauge bosons , one standard - model higgs and four neutral family higgs ( three mixed plus one pure ) .    thus , we choose to have , in the u - gauge , as in @xcite , @xmath77 all in columns .",
    "the five components of the complex triplet @xmath14 get absorbed by the @xmath16 family gauge bosons and the neutral part of @xmath15 has three real parts left - together making all eight family gauge bosons massive .    before the mixing",

    ", we would drop out all `` mass '' terms to begin with .    to understand the origin of mass @xcite",
    ", we find that the ignition term would better be in the purely family sector , i.e. , the @xmath81 term . when @xmath82 , the @xmath15 is equally partitioned between @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "it is easy to see that only one ssb - driving term is enough for all the three higgs fields  there may be several ssb s for the neutral fields - in our case , it works for all of them .",
    "ssb for one higgs but is driven by other higgs - a unique feature for the complex scalar fields .",
    "or , we have @xcite    @xmath83    these are two prefect squares minus the other extremes , to guarantee the positive definiteness , when the minus @xmath84 was left out .",

    ", we obtain @xmath93 and the ssb - driven @xmath94 yields @xmath95 these two equations show that it is necessary to have the driving term , since @xmath96 implies that everything is zero . also , @xmath97 is the ( lower ) limit .",

    "10 of @xcite ) , one tries to manipulate the causality @xmath148 requirement in obtaining the final results .",
    "we try to follow the details of @xcite in discussing the ultraviolet divergences of the quadratic order of the self - energy of the sm higgs , but adding some new points .",
    ".,width=384 ]    in fig .",
    "1 , the wave - function renormalization of the standard - model higgs @xmath13 is shown , for simplicity , in the u - gauge in the absence of dirac fermions .",
    "the lowest - order loop diagrams , from the above interaction lagrangian , are shown from 1(b ) [ in @xmath10 ] to 1(g ) [ in @xmath150 , where the first five are of quadratic divergence while the last one of logarithmic divergence .",
    "the higher - order connected loop diagrams , many of them and also of quadratic divergence , are also troublesome and should be dealt with at the same time .",
    "we will discuss the cases of the worst divergent , i.e. , the quadratic divergent , in what follows .",
    "using dimensional regularization ( i.e. the appendix of ch .",
    "10 , the wu - hwang book , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , we could write down the one - loop results .",
    "we try to use one explicit example to illustrate our point related to the infinities - the quadratic divergences of the wave function of the sm higgs @xmath98 . here , in fig . 1",
    ", we try to show only the higgs sectors themselves ; in a complete standard model , the ( dirac ) fermion loop diagrams , and those with gauge bosons , also present divergences of quadratic order and should be dealt with simultaneously .    as said earlier , we know that the formulae in dimensional regularization give us some things , _ apart from the @xmath151 prescription _ , and that it `` works '' in the u - gauge .",
    "for example , the @xmath152 loop for fig .",
    "1 would give us the vanishing result - so , it does not bother us .",
    "in details , the coupling of the sm higgs is ( @xcite , e.g. , wu / hwang , ch .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath153 z_\\mu^0 z_\\mu^0\\},\\ ] ] which gives rise to , to the first order , the one - loop @xmath75 or @xmath76 diagram . to evaluate them",
    ", we use the propagator in the u - gauge ( see the appendix of ch . 13 , ref .",
    "@xcite ) and the formulae in the dimensional regularization ( see the appendix of ch . 10 , ref .",
    "they cancel between two terms for each diagram .",
    "we proceed to examine those diagrams in fig . 1 which are `` simple '' quadratically divergent - those at the one - loop order .",
    "these are among the various higgs .",
    "the one - loop diagrams involving the quark ( or charged lepton ) , when simplified , are sums of quadratic and logarithmic divergences .    using dimensional regularization ( i.e. the appendix of ch .",
    "10 , the wu - hwang book , @xcite ) , we obtain the one - loop and quadratic - divergence results as follows . in the dimensional regularization",
    ", the factor @xmath154 stands for where the quadratic divergence appears .",
    "maybe the fractional dimensions , which are represented as finite numbers , could get some meaning , but we have to remember that , as a drawback , we bypass the @xmath151 in the propagators .",
    "@xmath155    or , using the standard model of the paper , we have @xmath156 here we do nt equal the sum to anything since , as we said before , the dimensional regularization scheme do nt take care of the causality @xmath148 prescription .",
    "maybe we could proceed in the following way . after removing the divergent @xmath154 parts",
    ", we might propose to use @xmath157 or something finite .",
    "here we would be happy to use an equal sign instead of the approximate sign , if the causality @xmath151 prescription could be used instead .",
    "there are a few general characteristics : ( 1 ) in the contributions from quarks and from charged leptons , the mass of the sm higgs enters ( as external momentum squared ) .",
    "this makes all contributions equivalent in some sense .",
    "( 2 ) we assume that the quarks enter in the theory in the sm way -",
    "if we examine the theory closely , there might still be some room for colored higgs mechanism @xcite . in other words , we are not sure that the `` identity '' in this sm higgs would hold out ; instead , the identity in the case of pure higgs @xmath14 , or that for @xmath15 , has better reasons to hold out . or , in light of the fact that it is difficult to rule out the colored higgs mechanism in the quark world .    in deriving the above equations , the coefficients of @xmath154 are the coefficients of quadratic divergences while those of @xmath158 are the coefficients of logarithmic divergences - for the latter ,",
    "divergence is less severe and the contributions could be everywhere ; the treatment is far more complicated .",
    "as mentioned in @xcite , the diagrams which are of multiple quadratic divergence are troublesome since the series could be blown - up , of @xmath159-th divergence with @xmath160 .",
    "mathematically , we should avoid such terms by all means .",
    "this is the requirement beyond the naive renormalizability .",
    "we are hinting that we have to study the mathematics of divergences ; they are there , because of the uncountably infinite degrees of freedom and other reasons , and there are regularities to be discovered @xcite .",
    "so , is the standard model a complete theory ?",
    "the result for @xmath13 in the one - loop result certainly gives rise to an `` approximate '' formula for the masses and the couplings - they are `` approximate '' because the cancelation could be modified by terms in the higher - loop orders .",
    "but it should be approximate - that is why it is worthwhile looking for them .    according to dimensional - regularization results , the three - loop diagram gives rise to ( quadratic divergence ) @xmath161 ( logarithmic divergence ) , and so on .",
    "they have to organized differently .",
    "one simple way out is that they cancel completely in their own group , such as all the four - loop diagrams . in any event",
    ", these divergences could be systematically analyzed to display what is going on .",
    "maybe we have said too much about the dimensional - regularization results , we in fact are suspicious that these results may not make any sense since they ignore the causality @xmath151 requirement but the causality @xmath151 requirement is a must .",
    "let s look at the fermion - loop diagram for the higgs @xmath13 , which is given by the previous @xmath162 term in the dimensional regularization scheme .",
    "@xmath163    or , it can be represented as a taylor s series .    in @xmath164 , it becomes a simple pole in the @xmath165 integration . in the next taylor",
    "s expansion , integration by parts could help us to convert the double pole to a simple pole .",
    "so , the math tricks could make everything transparent to us .",
    "but , in light to the infinities , it is not obvious on how to proceed .",
    "what we are doing is a little similar to the pauli - villars regularization scheme , e.g. , ch .",
    "10 of the wu - hwang book @xcite , though we did nt work out infinities .",
    "the dimensional regularization scheme @xcite ignores the causality @xmath148 requirement ; in our opinions , we do nt know what we are doing .",
    "if we believe that all point - like particles are there and that the standard model describes them so well , then some sort of cancelation conjecture or hypothesis might hold , first for the simple quadratic divergences of a certain higgs , and then other divergences .",
    "of course some theorem(s ) of `` global '' type may be needed .",
    "the `` new '' marriage of mathematics and physics is needed for the ultimate breakthrough .",
    "infinities in our language should not discourage us since the degrees of freedom in quantum fields are more than enumerable infinite .",
    "it is very strange that our overall background is the quantum 4-dimensional minkowski space - time with the force - fields gauge - group structure @xmath0 built - in from the very beginning .",
    "the uniform @xmath4 cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) serves as the best evidence of this overall background .",
    "moreover , this overall background sees the lepton world , or the various atomic worlds .",
    "the couplings are all dimensionless in the 4-dimensional minkowski space - time .    and",
    ", moreover , this overall background sees the quark world , or the various nuclear worlds .",
    "again , the couplings are all dimensionless in the 4-dimensional minkowski space - time .",
    "these `` dimensionless - ness '' should enter our discussions of ultraviolet divergences .",
    "but we do nt know how - maybe we anticipate to have a good starting point to construct the standard model of all centuries .",
    "why do we need the `` ignition '' channel ? why is the ignition channel not the sm higgs @xmath98 ?",
    "we set out to use the sm higgs as the `` ignition '' channel , but soon realized that the `` ignition '' channel with the purely family @xmath94 works out `` perfectly '' .",
    "in fact , the first version of @xcite was based on that the ignition channel was the sm higgs @xmath98 - the standard wisdom . as for why we need the `` ignition '' channel",
    ", we still need a good answer .",
    "( we believe that the god would not choose more than one ignition point , in this game . )",
    "note that @xmath166 corresponds to the situation that @xmath15 be equally divided by @xmath13 ( sm higgs ) and @xmath14 ( purely family ) .",
    "the situation corresponds to that it is not yet `` ignited '' ( @xmath81 = 0 ) .",
    "how do these translate into the temperature situations ( via the big bang or via big inflation ) ?",
    "the elusive purely family higgs @xmath94 as the `` ignition '' channel gives us a few interesting questions .",
    "to close this paper , we append a few remarks just to remind ourselves the leading physical issues that we may pursue after .    to verify this standard model is the experimental search for the family higgs @xmath110 , or @xmath112 , or charged family higgs @xmath167 and @xmath168 , or pure family higgs @xmath94 , in a proposed @xmath169 @xmath170 collider @xcite .",
    "the major implication of the family gauge theory is in fact a multi - gev or sub - sub - fermi gauge theory ( a new force field of a few @xmath171 in the range ) , assuming that the ordering in the coupling constants , @xmath172 , is reasonable .",
    "note that the lepton world are shielded from this @xmath16 theory against the qed landau s ghost , and similarly the quark world from strong - interaction @xmath173 .",
    "the @xmath146 anomaly certainly deserves another serious look in this context @xcite .    in this standard model ,",
    "the masses of quarks are diagonal , or the singlets in the @xmath16 space ; those of the three charged leptons are @xmath174 ( before diagonalization ) and the masses of neutrinos are purely off - diagonal , i.e. @xmath175 .",
    "this result is very interesting and very intriguing .",
    "in addition , neutrinos oscillate among themselves , giving rise to a lepton - flavor - violating interaction ( lfv ) .",
    "there are other oscillation stories , such as the oscillation in the @xmath177 system , but there is a fundamental `` intrinsic '' difference here - the @xmath177 system is composite while neutrinos are `` point - like '' dirac particles .",
    "we have standard feymann diagrams for the kaon oscillations but similar diagrams do not exist for point - like neutrino oscillations - our standard model solves the problem , maybe in a unique way .",
    "in fact , certain lfv processes such as @xmath178 @xcite , @xmath179 , etc . , are closely related to the most cited picture of neutrino oscillations @xcite . in our previous publications @xcite ,",
    "it was pointed out that the cross - generation or off - diagonal neutrino - higgs interaction may serve as the detailed mechanism of neutrino oscillations , with some vacuum expectation values of the family higgs @xmath142 .",
    "so , even though we havent seen , directly , the family gauge bosons and family higgs particles , we have already seen the manifestations of their vacuum expectation values .    moreover , in this standard model , neutrinos and antineutrinos are the _ only long - lived _ dark - matter particles @xcite .",
    "cosmic background @xmath180 s from the early universe , owing to the nonzero neutrino masses , would cluster in lumps , in neutrino halos , five times in weight the visual objects , such as stars , planets , etc .",
    "since the neutrino halo is incompressible ( as a fermi gas ) , this would prevent the final collapse of the visual ordinary - matter object into a black hole @xcite .",
    "thus , the standard model , i.e. , the quantum 4-dimensional minkowski space - time with the force - fields gauge - group structure @xmath6 built - in from the very beginning , we understand our universe ; that is , all the dark - matter particles and all the ordinary - matter particles are accounted for .",
    "formation of the black holes for visual ordinary - matter objects are stopped by the neutrino halos ( of the five times in weight ) .",
    "our standard model gives us the perfect universe which we are living .",
