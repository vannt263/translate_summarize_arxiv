    "turbulent flows subject to background rotation are an important problem in fluid mechanics as several systems are affected by rotation .",
    "rotation affects the earth atmosphere and the oceans at large scales , it is crucial in many engineering flows such as in turbomachinery , and is also important in many astrophysical systems such as stellar convective regions and gaseous planets atmospheres . as many applications arise in nature and technology , it becomes important to understand detailed properties of these flows .",
    "in particular , a long - lasting problem in fluid mechanics is that of the decay of turbulent fluctuations .",
    "the rate of energy decay in turbulent flows is known to be sensitive to initial conditions , and no single universal solution to the decay appears to exist to which all flows converge asymptotically for infinite reynolds number @xcite .",
    "considering isotropic and homogeneous turbulence at high reynolds number , there are two well known canonical cases as far as the energy spectrum at large scales is concerned .",
    "provided the cubic velocity correlation tensor @xmath2 decays sufficiently fast for large @xmath3 , these cases correspond to the so - called saffman spectrum for which @xmath4 , and to the so - called batchelor spectrum where @xmath5 . which of these spectra is observed depends on the initial conditions , and other non - canonical cases may arise if the above condition on the decay of the correlation tensor does not hold ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the quantities @xmath6 and @xmath7 are approximately conserved integrals for fully developed , freely decaying turbulence in each case ( @xmath7 is often called the loytsiansky integral ) , and have been used to determine the decay rate of the total energy ( see @xcite for examples ) . the quasi - conservation in each case is associated with self - preserving solutions of the von krmn - howarth equations , and can also be interpreted in terms of conservation of linear and angular momentum . while constancy of @xmath6 is a consequence of linear momentum conservation @xcite , constancy of @xmath7 is a consequence of the conservation of angular momentum @xcite .",
    "the presence of background rotation breaks down isotropy as a preferred direction arises along the axis of rotation ( for detailed studies of rotating turbulence , see @xcite ) .",
    "flows subjected to rotation develop anisotropies which have been shown to impact dramatically on the decay of energy , and there are different and sometimes conflicting results in the literature regarding the decay laws followed by the energy in rotating flows .",
    "moreover , theoretical arguments based on the isotropic von krmn - howarth equations are not valid anymore , and must be extended to include the effect of rotation .",
    "the integrals @xmath7 and @xmath6 become tensors , and for axisymmetric flows some of the diagonal components of these tensors can be expected to replace @xmath7 and @xmath6 as approximately conserved quantities .",
    "extensions of these arguments to anisotropic cases such as conducting flows with an imposed magnetic field , rotating , or stratified flows , have been recently derived in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the development of anisotropies in rotating flows have been reported both in experiments and simulations .",
    "experiments of freely decaying rotating turbulence show a reduction of the energy transfer , evidenced by a decrease in the energy decay rate @xcite .",
    "an anisotropic energy flux with a trend towards quasi - two - dimensionalization has been recently reported @xcite , and is also evidenced , e.g. , by an increase in the correlation lengths along the axis of rotation @xcite . regarding the energy decay , experimental results for non - rotating grid turbulence with integral scales smaller than the size of the vessel @xcite",
    "show an energy decay @xmath8 compatible with the theoretical result @xmath9 expected for large scale initial conditions with saffman spectrum @xmath1 . in @xcite , a transition from a @xmath9 decay to a decay law closer to @xmath10",
    "is reported once rotation starts affecting the flow dynamics , together with a cyclone - anticyclone asymmetry evidenced by positive skewness which grows with rotation rate .",
    "the decay for bounded flows , in which initial integral scales are close to the size of the vessel , seems to change from @xmath11 to @xmath12 when rotation is present @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations and models also show a slow down of the energy decay for many different initial conditions @xcite , together with the trend towards two - dimensionalization @xcite , and the higher cyclonic - over - anticyclonic activity @xcite .",
    "the first theoretical study of the decay of rotating turbulence was reported in @xcite , and considered the decrease of the energy transfer in the presence of rotation to explain the observed slow down in the decay , and to predict decay rates for the energy .",
    "the exponents reported were consistent with those obtained in simulations in @xcite , and in the experiments in @xcite . also , a very close decay law @xmath13 was found in @xcite for a wide range of rossby numbers ( from very small to moderate values ) , when solving equations for inertial wave turbulence and for an eddy damped quasi - normal markovian model ( edqnm3 ) .",
    "later , in @xcite a distinction was introduced between the energy contained in modes with @xmath14 ( @xmath15 , corresponding to two - dimensional , `` slow '' or `` vortical '' modes ) and modes with @xmath16 ( @xmath17 , corresponding to three - dimensional , `` fast '' , or `` wave '' modes ) .",
    "the authors carried a comprehensive study of the transfer of energy from 3d to 2d modes , for a wide range of rossby numbers , and found a non - monotonic behavior for the decay of energy for large , intermediate , and small rossby numbers .",
    "they focused on the intermediate rossby range , where the maximal energy transfer between 3d and 2d modes occurs ( see also @xcite ) . in this range , they reported an initial growth of @xmath15 as soon as the decay begins , that eventually results in a cross - over with the monotonously decaying @xmath17 .",
    "reference @xcite also reported different behavior in the time evolution of @xmath15 and @xmath17 , but considered only the decay of the total energy @xmath18 proposing a decay that depends on the amount of background rotation @xmath19 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath20 on the rotation rate was derived using phenomenological arguments resulting @xmath21 .",
    "this variety of solutions naturally led to parametric studies of the initial condition space in numerical simulations . for non - helical",
    "rotating flows with initial integral scale close to the size of the domain @xcite , a decay @xmath22 was found in simulations , in agreement with the experimental results @xcite . for flows with initial integral scale sufficiently smaller than the domain size , the case of initial conditions with energy spectra @xmath0",
    "was studied in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite , where different decay rates were reported for the two - dimensional and three - dimensional modes . while @xmath17 was found to decay as in the case of isotropic turbulence , a slower decay was found for @xmath15 in the intermediate - rossby range as defined in @xcite .",
    "the decay of two - dimensional modes can be correctly explained if only a few components of the loytsiansky tensor are considered ( here referred in short as @xmath23 and @xmath24 based on the symmetries of the flow ) , and it was shown that @xmath23 remains approximately constant during the decay @xcite .",
    "finally , it was also found that the decay is influenced by the amount of total helicity present in the initial conditions , and by the initial degree of anisotropy in the flow .",
    "recently , the anisotropic von krmn - howarth equation was used to consider the decay of a rotating turbulent flow with initial conditions following a saffman spectrum @xcite .",
    "the approximately conserved integral @xmath6 in the isotropic and homogeneous case , was generalized in the axisymmetric case to two integrals @xmath25 and @xmath26 . assuming that both @xmath27 and @xmath28 are simultaneously conserved ( or @xmath29 and @xmath30 for the case of batchelor initial spectrum ) , and using the empirical result that characteristic lengthscales of the flow in the direction parallel to the rotation axis grow linearly with time @xcite",
    ", the author concludes that regardless of the initial spectrum being @xmath1 or @xmath0 , both cases should decay with the same @xmath22 law , thus implying that it is not possible to set apart @xmath1 from @xmath0 turbulence by measuring the energy decay exponent alone .    in this paper",
    "we analyze whether the decay of rotating flows is affected by long - range correlations , studying the energy decay rate for flows with @xmath1 and @xmath0 initial conditions .",
    "we first present a brief theoretical discussion of conserved integral quantities for rotating turbulence using a von krmn - howarth equation which includes a coriolis term due to rotation .",
    "we extend the previously derived results for saffman turbulence @xcite , considering batchelor spectrum .",
    "the results corroborate the phenomenological arguments used in @xcite to explain the decay laws found numerically for energy spectra @xmath31 . in the second part of the paper we use numerical simulations to analyze the decay of rotating saffman and batchelor turbulence in periodic domains .",
    "we focus on the regime of intermediate rossby numbers ( initial @xmath32 @xcite ) , and therefore we will not attempt a study of the dependence of the decay with the rotation rate . to the best of our knowledge , the free decay of energy for @xmath1 initial conditions has not yet been numerically studied for rotating turbulence , and the resulting decay laws seem to be relevant for experiments . we show that the decay of energy in two - dimensional and three - dimensional modes follows distinct power laws for the cases of batchelor and saffman turbulence",

    "we must caution the reader on how the simulations in periodic boxes should be interpreted .",
    "flows in periodic boxes are sometimes considered as describing a homogeneous flow in an infinitely periodic domain . in this work",
    ", we will interpret instead a flow in a periodic box as artificially confined . indeed , as was shown in @xcite , when the integral scale of the flow is close to the domain size , the eddies can not become larger and the energy decay laws obtained are those of confined flows .",
    "the confinement is artificial in the sense that the flows have no ekman layers , as the domain has no rigid walls .",
    "moreover , the confinement also results in a discrete set of wavenumbers and selects a discrete set of inertial waves which are normal modes of the domain , unlike homogeneous rotating flows in infinite domains which have continuous wavenumbers ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "note that due to the discretization of wavenumbers in the former case , the existence and number of exact resonances depend on the domain size @xcite ( as this is aggravated when boxes with large aspect ratio and lower resolution in the vertical direction are used , we restrict our study to boxes with aspect ratio of unity ) .    while these are unavoidable and inherent properties of the simulations in periodic domains , the choice of a relatively large initial energy containing wavenumber @xmath124 ensures that as the equations are advanced in time the energy containing scale of the flow will remain smaller than the box size , and that a large fraction of wavenumbers will be available at large - scales for the system to evolve .",
    "equations ( [ eq : momentum ] ) and ( [ eq : incompressible ] ) are solved numerically using a dynamical subgrid - scale spectral les model of rotating turbulence in which only the large scales are explicitly resolved",
    ". the statistical effect of unresolved scales on the scales larger than a cut - off wave number ( @xmath125 ) are modeled with an eddy - viscosity and eddy - noise that are obtained after solving in each time step the eddy damped quasi - normal markovian ( edqnm ) equations for the spectrum of the unresolved scales .",

    "the simulation domain is a 3d periodic box of length @xmath126 with spatial resolution of @xmath127 grid points ( resulting in @xmath128 ) .",
    "a parallelized pseudo - spectral method without de - aliasing is used to solve spatial derivatives , and an explicit second - order runge - kutta method is used to evolve in time @xcite .      in @xcite it was observed that the energy decay is sensitive to the initial anisotropy of the flow ( in particular , to the initial amount of energy in 2d modes ) . to enforce spectral and variance isotropy of the initial conditions , we generate at @xmath129 a random velocity field using the craya - herring decomposition @xcite which associates to each wave vector @xmath130 an orthonormal frame with axes dependant on @xmath130 as @xmath131 @xmath132 is an arbitrary but fixed unit vector which we choose to be parallel to the rotation axis , @xmath133 .",
