    "the mechanisms of particle heating and acceleration , and the emission spectra from the resulting particle energy distributions , are of great importance in the theory of collisionless hot accretion flows onto compact objects .",
    "discussions in the literature have focused on the physics of electron heating and acceleration ( begelman & chiueh 1988 ; bisnovatyi - kogan & lovelace 1997 ; quataert & gruzinov 1999 ; gruzinov & quataert 1999 , medvedev 2000 ) , the efficiency of particle thermalization ( ghisellini , guilbert , & svensson 1988 ; ghisellini , haardt , & fabian 1993 ; mahadevan & quataert 1997 ; ghisellini , haardt , & svensson 1998 ; nayakshin & melia 1998 ) , and the generation of hybrid thermal - nonthermal electron energy distributions in these plasmas ( see , e.g. , coppi 1999 and references therein ) . despite a substantial amount of work ,",
    "many issues remain unresolved , primarily because of our incomplete understanding of physical processes such as magnetic reconnection , mhd turbulence , and collective plasma modes .",
    "these questions are especially relevant for an optically - thin advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) .",
    "an adaf is an example of a hot , rarefied , magnetic plasmas with low radiative efficiency ( ichimaru 1977 ; narayan & yi 1994 , 1995b ; abramowicz et al . 1995 ; see narayan , mahadevan , & quataert 1998b and kato , fukue , & mineshige 1998 for reviews ) .",
    "a basic property of the nearly collisionless plasma in an adaf is that the coulomb coupling between the electrons and ions is weak so that energy transfer from the ions to the electrons is inefficient .",
    "in addition , it is commonly assumed that the viscously generated energy primarily heats the heavier species , the ions , and that the electrons retain a thermal distribution throughout the flow ( e.g. , narayan & yi 1995b ; mahadevan 1997 ) .",
    "there are , however , processes such as mhd turbulence , pair production ( e.g. , through pion decay ) , and electron - proton coupling which can both heat the electrons and generate non - thermal distributions .",
    "quataert and gruzinov ( 1999 ; see also gruzinov & quataert 1999 ) considered two processes specific to mhd turbulence that accelerate particles in magnetic collisionless plasmas : landau damping by electric fields parallel to the local magnetic field and transit - time damping by time - varying magnetic fields .",
    "they found that the assumption of negligible electron heating / acceleration is valid only for weak magnetic fields , i.e. , when the ratio of the gas pressure to total pressure @xmath8 is larger than a critical value @xmath9 .",
    "the value of @xmath9 is very uncertain and is around 0.9 . for @xmath10 ,",
    "turbulence primarily accelerates the protons , while for stronger magnetic fields , the results are inconclusive . shocks and pion decay can also lead to non - thermal electrons in the accretion flow .",
    "several processes , such as coulomb collisions and synchrotron self - absorption , can potentially lead to thermalization of particles in accretion flows ( mahadevan & quataert 1997 ; ghisellini et al .",
    "mahadevan & quataert ( 1997 ) showed that coulomb collisions are ineffective in thermalizing the electrons in an adaf .",
    "however , they argued that , for sufficiently high mass - accretion rates , the electrons in the plasma can be thermalized by synchrotron self - absorption .",
    "nayakshin and melia ( 1998 ) showed that considerable deviations from a maxwell - boltzmann distribution can be sustained in a plasma with low source compactness when coulomb collisions , comptonization , and pair processes are taken into account .    in view of the difficulty of calculating the heating , cooling and thermalization of particles from first principles ,",
    "many authors have restricted their models to either purely maxwellian or purely non - thermal ( extended power laws or monoenergetic ) electron distributions .",
    "only recently have there been attempts towards explaining spectra of accreting black holes with models including hybrid thermal / non - thermal distributions of electrons .",
    "some models have physically motivated distributions , such as non - thermal electrons produced by decaying pions ( mahadevan 1998 ) , whereas others invoke more _ ad hoc _ distributions to fit the data ( e.g. , beckert & duschl 1997 ; falcke & biermann 1999 ) . the reverse process of trying to constrain the energy distributions of particles in accreting plasmas by comparing models to data , however , faces issues of uniqueness which can be addressed only by a more comprehensive study of hybrid models .    in this paper , we consider generalized electron distributions consisting of a dominant maxwellian plus a small non - thermal power - law component of varying slope and energy content , and study the synchrotron emission from the resulting hybrid plasmas .",
    "we identify the characteristic signatures of the non - thermal electrons on the emitted radio synchrotron spectrum of an accretion flow and on its image as observed with a radio telescope .",
    "we also discuss to what extent the observed effects could be used to determine the details of the underlying non - thermal electron distribution .",
    "this work is relevant for interpreting observations of low luminosity agns such as the galactic center source , sagittarius  a@xmath3 ( sgr  a@xmath3 ) .    in @xmath11",
    "we review the basic properties of adafs , hybrid plasmas , synchrotron radiation , and radiative transfer .",
    "in @xmath12 we present a series of models of supermassive black holes with low accretion rates .",
    "we apply these models to sgr  a@xmath3 and derive constraints on the fraction of the electron energy that can be present in a non - thermal form . in @xmath13 , we study the correspondence between the energy distribution of the electrons and the resulting spectrum . in @xmath14",
    "we study the energetics of a hybrid flow and calculate the heating , cooling and thermalization rates of the non - thermal electrons .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in @xmath15 .",
    "we present in an appendix approximate analytic expressions for the contribution of a non - thermal particle population to the synchrotron spectrum of an accretion flow .",
    "we begin by reviewing some of the basic properties of the optically - thin branch of adafs .",
    "adafs are quasi - spherical , hot , magnetic accretion flows in which the accreting plasma is too rarefied to cool efficiently by radiative processes . the viscously dissipated energy is therefore advected into the black hole or other compact object at the center ( see narayan et al . 1998b and kato et al .",
    "1998 for reviews ) . in the limit where the fraction of the viscous energy advected inward is independent of radius , a self - similar analytic solution for the thermodynamic quantities of the accreting gas can be obtained ( narayan & yi 1994 , 1995b ) .",
    "we make use of this solution in appendix a. for the numerical calculations presented in the rest of the paper , we use more accurate global solutions to obtain the run of electron temperature and density with radius .",
    "these solutions are calculated by the methods described in narayan , kato , & honma ( 1997b ) , chen , abramowicz , & lasota ( 1997 ) , and popham & gammie ( 1998 ) .",
    "the magnetic field strengths are obtained by assuming that the ratio of gas pressure to total pressure ( sum of gas and magnetic pressure ) is equal to a specified value @xmath8 .    since the focus of this paper is on massive black holes in galactic nuclei with low mass - accretion rates , with specific applications to the black hole in our own galactic nucleus , sgr  a@xmath3 , we scale masses in units of @xmath16 solar mass , i.e. , @xmath17 and radii in units of the schwarzschild radius , i.e. , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 we scale the mass accretion rate in units of @xmath20 , i.e. , @xmath21 where the eddington mass accretion rate is @xmath22 in defining the eddington rate , we assume a standard radiative efficiency of @xmath23 .",
    "( this is purely for the purposes of the definition ; the actual radiative efficiency can be very different from @xmath24 ) .    for the calculations presented here we use adaf models in which the viscosity parameter is set to @xmath25 , the equipartition parameter to @xmath26 , and the ratio of viscous electron heating to proton heating to @xmath27 .",
    "note that @xmath8 differs from the usual plasma parameter @xmath28 , which is the ratio of the gas pressure to the magnetic pressure ; the value of @xmath29 assumed in our adaf models corresponds to a plasma @xmath30 ( quataert & narayan 1999 ) .",
    "we assume that a large fraction of the electrons in the plasma are in a thermal distribution with temperature @xmath31 and that the rest of the electrons are in a non - thermal distribution , usually with a power - law form .",
    "we denote the number density of electrons in the thermal population by @xmath32 and in the non - thermal population by @xmath33 .",
    "we denote the emissivities of the thermal and power - law electron populations by @xmath34 and @xmath35 respectively , and the corresponding absorption coefficients by @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "for the thermal electron population , we use the relativistic maxwell - boltzmann distribution given by @xmath38,\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the electron lorentz factor , @xmath28 is the relativistic electron velocity , and @xmath40 is the dimensionless electron temperature .",
    "the modified bessel function of second order @xmath41 arises from the normalization of the maxwellian .",
    "similarly , for the non - thermal electron population we use a power - law distribution extending from @xmath42 to infinity , @xmath43    the number density of thermal electrons @xmath32 is a function of the flow radius and is determined by the global adaf solutions . we determine @xmath33 at each radius by assuming that the steady - state energy in the non - thermal distribution is equal to a fraction @xmath44 of the energy in the thermal distribution , with @xmath44 constant in radius . although the calculations presented in @xmath12 are all carried out with this assumption , generalizations to radially - dependent @xmath45 as well as a discussion of the energetics of such a flow will be presented in @xmath46 .",
    "note that we implicitly assume that the non - thermal electron population does not affect the dynamics or the thermal properties of the flow ; this will be justified in @xmath46 .",
    "the energy density of a maxwell - boltzmann distribution of electrons at temperature @xmath47 was derived by chandrasekhar @xmath48)$ ] to be @xmath49 where @xmath50\\ ] ] is a coefficient that varies from 3/2 for a non - relativistic electron gas to 3 for fully relativistic electrons , and @xmath51 are the modified bessel functions of the n@xmath52 order . for the present purposes , we use a simplified expression for @xmath53 which has an error of less than @xmath54 at all temperatures",
    "( gammie & popham 1998 ) : @xmath55 the number density of the non - thermal distribution is then @xmath56 this normalization of the power law population typically corresponds to @xmath57 depending on the electron temperature and the power law index .",
    "the distributions considered above correspond to the steady state that results from the competition between heating / acceleration and cooling by radiation .",
    "we discuss in some detail in @xmath46 the energy equations for the thermal and non - thermal electron populations . here",
    "we simply note that the synchrotron cooling timescale of electrons moving with a lorentz factor @xmath39 scales as @xmath58 , and hence electrons in the high energy tail of a power law distribution cool most rapidly . as a result , if electrons are injected with a power - law distribution with index @xmath59 @xmath60 $ ] and cool only by synchrotron emission , the synchrotron cooling causes the power law index of the steady state distribution to be @xmath61 above a certain @xmath62 , called the cooling break , thus causing the steady state distribution to fall off more steeply at higher electron energies .",
    "mahadevan & quataert ( 1997 ) calculated @xmath62 in an adaf by comparing the cooling timescale to the inflow timescale and found that at sufficiently high accretion rates , the break occurs at a very low lorentz factor , @xmath63 .",
    "the lorentz factors of interest to us are invariably larger than @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , the values of @xmath64 we consider below in @xmath12 and @xmath13 are always equal to @xmath65 , so that the injected energy distribution @xmath66 is harder by one power of @xmath39 than the steady state energy distribution , @xmath67 .",
    "corresponding to @xmath44 , we can define another quantity @xmath68 that measures the fraction of electron energy @xmath69 into a power law distribution .",
    "if @xmath70 , then @xmath68 can be significantly greater than @xmath44 .",
    "if we assume a distribution from @xmath71 to some @xmath72 , @xmath68 is greater than @xmath44 by a factor @xmath73 .",
    "however , it is thought that the acceleration mechanisms typically encountered in astrophysics , such as shock acceleration or acceleration via mhd turbulence , inject energy into particles with @xmath74 such that the steady state distribution has @xmath75 . in this case",
    "there is little dependence on @xmath72 , and @xmath76 which is not very different from unity .",
    "although we expect @xmath74 and @xmath77 for most systems , for completeness we consider models in the range @xmath78 .      the synchrotron emissivity of a relativistic electron moving with a lorentz factor @xmath39 in a magnetic field of strength @xmath79 is given by ( rybicki & lightman 1979 ) @xmath80 here , @xmath81 is the non - relativistic cyclotron frequency , @xmath82 is the angle between the direction of the magnetic field and the velocity of the electron , and @xmath83 with @xmath84 the modified bessel function of order 5/3 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 . for a thermal distribution of electrons , the total emissivity for a given angle @xmath82",
    "is obtained by integrating equation ( [ eq : sngl ] ) over the maxwellian distribution ( pacholczyk 1970 ) , @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 the limiting behaviour of @xmath90 for small and large @xmath91 was derived by pacholczyk @xmath92 and petrosian @xmath93 , respectively .",
    "mahadevan , narayan , & yi ( 1996 , hereafter mny96 ) integrated equation ( [ eq : ixm ] ) over the angle @xmath82 for an isotropic distribution of electron velocities and provided a fitting function for the emissivity in the ultrarelativistic to mildly relativistic regimes : @xmath94 with @xmath95 given by @xmath96 the best fit values of the coefficients @xmath97 , and @xmath98 for different temperatures are given in mny96 .",
    "the coefficients tend to unity in the ultrarelativistic limit .",
    "finally , the synchrotron absorption coefficient @xmath36 is related to the emissivity via kirchoff s law , @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the black body source function .    for the total emissivity of electrons in a power law distribution",
    ", we use the expression given in rybicki & lightman ( 1979 ) and average over angles , @xmath101 where @xmath33 is defined in terms of @xmath32 as above and @xmath102 the corresponding absorption coefficient is @xmath103 with @xmath104      the equation of radiative transfer for a time - independent , spherically symmetric flow is ( e.g. , mihalas 1978 ) @xmath105 i(r , \\mu , \\nu ) =   j(r,\\nu ) - \\alpha(r , \\nu ) i(r , \\mu , \\nu),\\ ] ] where @xmath106 is the cosine of the angle between the ray and the radial direction , @xmath107 is the radial coordinate , @xmath108 is the frequency , and @xmath109 and @xmath110 are the emission and absorption coefficients defined above .",
    "one can simplify this equation by taking plane parallel rays of varying impact parameters ( perpendicular distances of rays to the central line of sight ) through the flow and solving the equation along these rays ( mihalas 1978 ) .",
    "the equation then becomes @xmath111 where now @xmath59 is the line element along the ray and the coefficients @xmath112 and @xmath113 correspond to radiation coming towards and going away from an external observer , respectively . in our problem ,",
    "@xmath114 and @xmath115 . rewriting the equation in terms of the source function @xmath116 and optical depth @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is",
    "the point of intersection of the ray with the outer boundary of the flow , equation ( [ eq : radtr2 ] ) becomes @xmath119 where the combined source function is @xmath120    in the numerical calculations reported below , we integrate equation ( [ eq : radtr4 ] ) using the formal solution and the appropriate boundary conditions for a non - illuminated atmosphere ( see mihalas 1978 ) . we carry out the integral along rays with impact parameters up to @xmath121 schwarzschild radii , beyond which the temperature of the electrons becomes too low for significant synchrotron emission .",
    "because of the very steep dependence of the synchrotron emissivity on photon frequency , magnetic field strength , and electron temperature and density , we use an adaptive step size for the radiative transfer integral .",
    "the total flux is obtained by integrating over all impact parameters .",
    "we validated the implementation of our numerical algorithm by comparing its output to analytic solutions of the radiative transfer equation in uniform media .",
    "the discrepancy between the numerical and analytic solutions was @xmath122 for the cases considered .",
    "in all model adaf spectra published so far , the transport of radiation has been calculated using an approximate method based on concentric shells ( narayan , barret , & mcclintock 1997a ) . in figure 1 , we compare , for a typical flow , the exact spectrum obtained by formally solving the above transfer equation to that obtained with the previous approximate method .",
    "we see that there is a fairly good agreement between the two methods , but with some differences .",
    "the most prominent difference is a shifting of the peak toward higher frequencies in the exact calculation , as well as some broadening .",
    "this is probably due to the poorer resolution of the concentric shell method which becomes a limiting factor close to the black hole .",
    "there is also a slight offset at lower frequencies , probably again due to poor resolution .",
    "note that there is a second peak at high frequencies ( @xmath123 hz ) in the spectrum calculated with the approximate method .",
    "this is caused by the inverse compton scattering of soft photons , a process which is not included in the radiative transfer code described here . the remaining features of the two spectra are quantitatively consistent .",
    "in this section , we study the effects of an extended power - law electron distribution on the synchrotron emission spectra of adafs .",
    "figure 2 shows the various components of the spectrum of a typical hybrid model , with @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 , and @xmath127 . compared to the spectrum of a pure thermal model ( dashed line ) , we see two primary effects due to the power - law electrons : ( i ) there is a prominent shoulder of optically thick emission at low frequencies and ( ii ) there is an extended power - law tail of optically thin emission at high frequencies . in between these two features there is a region of the spectrum where the thermal peak dominates .",
    "these features were first identified by mahadevan ( 1998 ) for a specific model .",
    "we find that they are universal for hybrid models .",
    "to understand the results , we note that the spectra of hybrid populations are determined by a competition between @xmath35 and @xmath34 and between @xmath37 and @xmath36 , each having different radial and frequency dependences .",
    "since the emission at different frequencies arises from different radii in the flow , the relative importance of @xmath37 to @xmath36 and @xmath35 to @xmath34 at that particular frequency and radius determines the local behaviour of the spectrum . in the less steep segment of the low - frequency shoulder , the emission from the power - law population ( which is more efficient at low frequencies ) exceeds that of the thermal electrons , while absorption is still mostly dominated by the more numerous thermal electrons . as a result",
    ", this segment of the spectrum assumes a shape roughly described by the rather unusual source function @xmath128 . at still lower frequencies , where the emission comes from larger radii in the flow ,",
    "the contribution of the non - thermal electrons to the absorption becomes non - negligible and the spectrum falls more steeply with decreasing @xmath108 .    in the region of the thermal peak",
    ", we have both @xmath129 and @xmath130 , with @xmath131 for frequencies smaller than the peak frequency and @xmath132 for frequencies higher than the peak frequency .",
    "the spectrum is essentially the same as for a purely thermal model ( dashed line ) .",
    "( but , note that for sufficiently high @xmath44 , the synchrotron spectrum assumes an entirely non - thermal character and this region too can be dominated by the power - law electrons , with the peak luminosity becoming higher and the peak flattened ) . beyond the thermal peak , there is no self - absorption either by thermal or power - law electrons @xmath133 and the emission is optically thin . here",
    "we find an extended power - law tail dominated entirely by the non - thermal population .",
    "this segment of the spectrum has the familiar form @xmath134 which gives a rising spectrum with increasing frequency for @xmath135 and a falling spectrum for @xmath77 .",
    "figures 3a - d show how the spectrum of a hybrid model depends on the various parameters . in figure",
    "3a , the energy content of the power - law population @xmath44 is varied from @xmath136 ( purely thermal ) to @xmath137 ; we see that the range and normalization of the low - frequency shoulder increase linearly with increasing @xmath44 .",
    "the normalization of the high - frequency tail also depends linearly on the number of electrons in the power - law distribution and thus varies in an obvious way with @xmath44 .    in figure  3b",
    ", we fix @xmath44 at @xmath138 and vary the power - law index @xmath64 .",
    "note that the overall luminosity of both the low - frequency shoulder and the high - frequency tail show considerable dependence on @xmath64 .",
    "this is not unexpected .",
    "when @xmath64 is small , there are more particles both at intermediate lorentz factors @xmath139 , which give rise to the low - frequency shoulder , as well as at large @xmath39 , which emit the high - frequency tail ( see @xmath13 ) .",
    "therefore , small values of @xmath64 give more emission in both these segments of the spectrum . the high - frequency tail",
    "has a spectral slope equal to @xmath140 and therefore has a strong dependence on @xmath64 .",
    "two striking qualitative results in figures 3a and 3b need to be highlighted .",
    "first , even very small values of the non - thermal energy content @xmath44 give rise to significant excess super - thermal emission at low frequencies .",
    "for instance , even if only @xmath138 of the total electron energy is in non - thermal electrons , there can be several orders of magnitude higher luminosity at frequencies below the thermal peak .",
    "even more striking is the fact that the spectral shape of the low frequency shoulder is nearly independent of @xmath44 and @xmath64 , when both these parameters are independent of radius , while the normalization depends on both ( see appendix a for an analytic expression for the spectral slope of this segment ) .",
    "this leads to a degeneracy between @xmath44 and @xmath64 in models of the low - frequency emission , so that it is not possible to distinguish between different combinations of @xmath44 and @xmath64 , by studying spectral data below the thermal peak only .",
    "the degeneracy can be lifted with data on the high - frequency tail whose slope has a strong dependence on @xmath64 .",
    "we finally consider the effect of changing the black hole mass and the mass - accretion rate .",
    "we find that the relative excess emission due to non - thermal electrons increases rather weakly with increasing black hole mass ( figure 3c ) .",
    "this is because the thermal peak moves to lower frequencies for higher @xmath141 ( mahadevan 1997 ) and at these frequencies the effect of non - thermal electrons is more prominent .",
    "the non - thermal contribution to both the low and high frequency emission increases only weakly with increasing @xmath142 ( figure 3d ) .      over the last decade",
    ", many models have been developed to explain the radio spectrum of sgr  a@xmath3 .",
    "this source is believed to be an accreting supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy .",
    "nearly all the published models invoke synchrotron radiation from relativistic or quasi - relativistic electrons .",
    "melia ( 1992 ) considered emission by thermal electrons in a spherical accretion flow and showed that the resulting cyclo - synchrotron emission is consistent with the broad features of the observed spectrum .",
    "narayan , yi , & mahadevan ( 1995 ) and narayan et al .",
    "( 1998a ) developed adaf models of sgr  a@xmath3 which included rotation , viscosity and a two - temperature plasma , and obtained similar results , again with a purely thermal distribution of electrons .",

    "this section is a generalization of mahadevan s work .    in figure 4",
    "we apply our hybrid emission model to sgr  a@xmath3 .",

    "we first note that the agreement with data at low frequencies is significantly better with these hybrid models ( dashed lines ) than with a purely thermal model ( solid line ) , as was first shown by mahadevan ( 1998 ) .",
    "the two major results pointed out in @xmath151 are evident in this figure .",
    "first , there is no unique solution for the parameters @xmath64 and @xmath44 .",
    "the four hybrid models shown in figure 4 give indistinguishable spectra below the thermal peak , rendering it impossible to determine @xmath64 and @xmath44 from low - frequency spectral data alone .",
    "second , @xmath44 is extremely small in all models .",
    "a very small fraction of the energy in non - thermal electrons , with @xmath44 at most @xmath138 , is sufficient to produce all the observed emission at low frequencies .",
    "this means that the non - thermal electrons are a minor perturbation on the electron population , which is itself a minor perturbation on the more dominant ion population .",
    "we are therefore consistent when we compute the gas dynamics with a purely thermal model and ignore the non - thermal electrons for the dynamics .",
    "further justification of this assumption as well as implications of this constraint are discussed in @xmath46 .",

    "since @xmath155 decreases with increasing frequency for @xmath77 , we can not use ir data to constrain @xmath44 very strongly in these cases . on the other hand , if @xmath135 , electrons in an extended power - law distribution produce significant emission in the infrared .",
    "for example , if @xmath144 , we find that the maximum allowed fraction of energy in non - thermal electrons is @xmath156 .",
    "tighter bounds on the infrared flux will constrain the parameters @xmath44 and @xmath64 even more strongly .",
    "we note that imposing a maximum lorentz factor @xmath72 on the power - law electron distribution also has the effect of suppressing the high - frequency emission .",
    "therefore , for @xmath157 , we could alternatively use the ir data to constrain @xmath72 rather than @xmath44 .",

    "note that our radiative transfer code is one dimensional and can only handle spherical models , though adafs in general are oblate and are likely to appear elliptical in projection ( narayan & yi 1995a ) . in the comparison with observations ,",
    "we use only the measured long axes of the images .",
    "the effect of power - law electrons is to enlarge the image size at long wavelengths @xmath164 , where the excess non - thermal emission , which extends outward of the surface of unit optical depth , is most prominent .",
    "this is a general result which holds true for all model parameters we have studied .",
    "the other related result is the steepening of the dependence of the image size on the frequency at long wavelengths .",
    "while for thermal electrons we find @xmath165 when we include power law electrons , we find @xmath166 this is in agreement with the preliminary result obtained by lo et al .",
    "( 1998 ) when they combined their measurement of the intrinsic size at 7  mm with the results of krichbaum et al .",
    "( 1998 ) at 1.4  mm , although the thermal and hybrid slopes are not distinguishable with the current data .",
    "we also calculate the effective brightness temperature @xmath167 at each frequency as @xmath168 .",
    "figure  6 shows the result . for the thermal model , @xmath167 measures the electron temperature at the photosphere .",
    "since the photosphere moves out with decreasing frequency , the brightness temperature falls . for the hybrid model , at lower frequencies , the contribution of the non - thermal electrons is large , the spectrum is non - thermal , and the resulting brightness temperature increases .",
    "this is another clear signature of a synchrotron - emitting hybrid electron population .",
    "we finally study the effect of the non - thermal electrons on the shape of the radio image .",
    "figure  7 shows the variation of the brightness temperature @xmath167 across the source , for the thermal and hybrid models of sgr  a@xmath3 described above .",
    "we consider two wavelengths , 3.6  cm and 7  mm .",
    "the most striking feature of the hybrid case is the limb brightening seen at long wavelengths , a feature which is absent in the thermal models .",
    "thus , if the accretion flow contains non - thermal electrons , its image would look like a shell rather than a disk .",
    "this is again due to the different radial dependences of absorption ( which is predominantly thermal ) and emission ( which is mostly non - thermal ) at the frequencies where the non - thermal shoulder appears in the energy spectrum .",
    "because the total absorption falls off more steeply away from the center than the total emissivity , the image appears brighter for a range of impact parameters away from the center than at the center .",
    "in addition , due to the overall increase in the intensity of the emerging radiation in this same frequency range , the image looks brighter overall , with the brightness temperature @xmath167 of the hybrid case increasing to twice the thermal value in the center of the image at 3.6 cm .",
    "the limb brightening , along with the enhanced overall brightness at long wavelengths are signatures of a non - thermal population which may be accessible to observations .",
    "unfortunately , in the case of sgr  a@xmath3 , precisely at the wavelengths where the effects are strongest , interstellar scattering blurs the observed image ( e.g. , lo et al . 1998 ) .",
    "it may be worthwhile to look for these effects in other sources where the scattering is less severe .",
    "the numerical studies presented in @xmath12 show that the presence of a small population of power - law electrons causes universal modifications to the spectrum : it introduces a shoulder at low frequencies and a power - law tail at high frequencies .",
    "we now attempt to associate each of these features of the hybrid spectrum with a specific range of lorentz factors of the non - thermal electrons . in doing so",
    ", we address three important issues .",
    "the first is the question of degeneracy : why is the low frequency shoulder in the spectrum degenerate to a combination of the power - law index @xmath64 and the energy content @xmath44 of the non - thermal electrons ? understanding the source of non - uniqueness is especially important in trying to extract the underlying electron distributions from spectral data and determining what we can conclude @xmath169 about these distributions .",
    "second , since introducing even a very small fraction of power - law electrons results in significant enhancement of the luminosity at low frequencies , existing radio data can be used to constrain the non - thermal energy fraction in these accretion flows .",
    "if only a part of the electron energy distribution is responsible for the excess emission , data can further constrain these specific parts of the particle distribution .",
    "the third question we address here is related to the absence of significant ir emission from the accretion flow around sgr  a@xmath3 ( eckart & genzel 1997 ) , in the frequency range where the extended optically - thin non - thermal emission is expected .",
    "absence of emission at these wavelengths provides information about the underlying electron distributions by constraining either the power - law index @xmath64 or the maximum lorentz factor @xmath170 electrons can attain in these accretion flows . determining @xmath170 in a particle distribution may provide a better understanding of particle acceleration and cooling processes and timescales in hot accretion flows .",
    "we first investigate the relationship between the lorentz factor @xmath39 of an electron and the dominant frequency of the synchrotron emission it produces in the presence of a dominant thermal electron population . at very low frequencies ,",
    "synchrotron emission comes from large radii in the flow where the temperatures are low , the non - thermal emission and absorption are efficient , and @xmath171 .",
    "however , at higher frequencies near and above the low - frequency shoulder in the spectrum , @xmath130 , as discussed earlier . for these frequencies",
    ", we can thus neglect @xmath37 .",
    "we make this key simplification only in this section .",
    "it simplifies the radiative transfer equation and allows us to compute separately the contribution to the intensity from each value of @xmath39 in the non - thermal distribution .",
    "we proceed by writing all quantities as integrals over the power - law electron distribution , @xmath172 @xmath173 and @xmath174 where @xmath175 is assumed to be a separable function of @xmath107 and @xmath39 given by @xmath176 ( note that , for this analysis , the non - thermal distribution does not have to be a power - law , though we have assumed this in order to compare this analysis directly to our numerical results ) .    substituting equations ( 29)-(32 ) into the radiative transfer equation and rearranging terms",
    ", we obtain @xmath177    ~n^{\\rm{pl}}_\\gamma(\\gamma ) d\\gamma = 0.\\ ] ] for this integral to vanish for any non - thermal electron distribution , the integrand must be identically zero , thus giving @xmath178 we solve this equation for a wide range of lorentz factors , @xmath179 , by choosing a specific radial profile of the non - thermal electron density @xmath180 corresponding to @xmath181 .",
    "we study the contribution of each lorentz factor to the different parts of the spectra .",
    "the total intensity for the power - law distribution takes the form @xmath182 and therefore , in order to study the true contribution of each @xmath39 to the total spectrum , we plot the integrand @xmath183 as a function of frequency for each lorentz factor .",
    "the result for @xmath184 , and 1000 ( for @xmath124 ) are shown in figure  8a .",
    "the curves give a good estimate of the individual contribution of each lorentz factor to the total spectrum .",
    "most of the contribution to the low - frequency shoulder comes from electrons with @xmath185 .",
    "emission from electrons with @xmath186 is already lower by an order of magnitude at those frequencies , and the emission completely dies off beyond @xmath187 .",
    "contribution to the high - frequency tail , on the other hand , starts around @xmath188 and increases with increasing electron energy .    to get a more quantitative idea of",
    "which range of lorentz factors contributes to the three distinct regions of the spectrum , we show in figure  8b the above integrand as a function of @xmath39 for 3 frequencies , namely @xmath189 hz ( in the low - frequency shoulder ) , @xmath190 hz ( in the thermal peak ) , and @xmath191 hz ( in the high - frequency tail .",
    "we see that the emission at @xmath189 hz is primarily from electrons with @xmath192 ; the emission at @xmath190 hz is mostly from @xmath193 ( thermal electrons , while the emission at @xmath191 hz comes mostly from @xmath194 .    to quantify this effect further , we plot in figure  8c the minimum and maximum lorentz factors for which the value of the integrand drops to half its maximum value for each frequency",
    "this gives us exactly the contributing range of lorentz factors to the emission at each frequency in the low - frequency shoulder and the high - frequency tail .",
    "we may summarize the results as follows .",
    "the low - frequency shoulder is caused by a narrow range of electron lorentz factors , @xmath195 the narrowness of the range explains why the spectra are degenerate to different combinations of @xmath64 and @xmath44 : a power - law distribution with small values of @xmath64 and small @xmath44 has nearly the same number of electrons in this narrow range of lorentz factors as one with a larger @xmath64 and a larger @xmath44 , thus producing the same emission in the shoulder .",
    "the high - frequency tail , however , is produced by electrons with a wide range of lorentz factors @xmath196 with higher frequencies coming from higher @xmath39 .",
    "intermediate lorentz factors @xmath197 emit predominantly at frequencies around the thermal peak and are overpowered by the thermal emission , and therefore do not have an observable feature in the hybrid spectrum .",
    "in this section , we study the energy flow through the thermal and non - thermal electron populations as well as the energy exchange between these two populations through synchrotron self - absorption and coulomb collisions . starting with the energy equations for the two populations and a parametrization of the energy input into each , we calculate the steady - state energy content of both as a function of radius assuming that the shapes of the distributions are known a priori .",
    "note that if the acceleration mechanism is known , the particle distributions can be calculated exactly ( see , e.g. , nayakshin & melia 1998 ) .",
    "here we simply assess the feasibility of a steady - state thermal / power - law hybrid distribution .",
    "we then extend our discussion of hybrid synchrotron spectra to cases where the parameter @xmath44 is not constant but is allowed to vary with radius .",
    "we start by writing the energy equations for the two populations . neglecting advection and diffusion which we estimate to be minor corrections ,",
    "the energy balance for the power - law population reads @xmath198 while the thermal population obeys @xmath199 where @xmath200 and @xmath201 are the steady state energy contents of the thermal and power - law populations respectively , @xmath202 is the fraction of viscous energy that heats the thermal electrons , and @xmath203 is the corresponding fraction injected into the power - law population ( @xmath204 , where @xmath68 is defined in @xmath205 ) ; the time derivatives are set to zero in steady - state .",
    "the energy exchange ( thermalization ) timescale due to coulomb collisions of high energy electrons with the thermal bath is denoted by @xmath206 .",
    "the radiation term in equation  ( [ eq : ennt ] ) corresponds to the energy loss by the non - thermal electrons via optically thin synchrotron emission ; because the non - thermal absorption coefficient is negligible throughout the flow , the non - thermal electrons do not gain energy by absorption of synchrotron radiation .",
    "the corresponding term in equation  ( [ eq : enth ] ) , on the other hand , describes the heating of the thermal electrons by the local radiation field that is in excess of the blackbody limit . when the radiation energy density is a blackbody , there is locally no heating or cooling , but as the radiation energy density is above this limit due to emission by the non - thermal electrons , the thermal electrons are heated by absorbing this total emission .",
    "note that this is the same energy exchange mechanism invoked in the synchrotron boiler process ( ghisellini , guilbert , & svensson 1988 ; ghisellini , haardt , & fabian 1993 ; ghisellini , haardt , & svensson 1998 ) .",
    "the transport of energy due to non - local synchrotron self - absorption is likely to be small and have little effect on the spectra as the photon mean free path becomes very short very rapidly along a radial path and thus the radiation emitted in the optically thick regions of the flow is reabsorbed locally .",
    "this is due to the very steep radial dependence of the synchrotron absorption coefficient .",
    "there are several issues we would like to address regarding the relative importance of thermal and non - thermal electrons in the flow and the energy exchange between the two populations .",
    "first , the quantity @xmath207(r)$ ] determines as a function of radius the relative rate of heating of non - thermal electrons compared to thermal electrons .",
    "second , the energy exchange between the populations ( heating of the thermal electrons by non - thermal electrons ) proceeds both via the coulomb term and the absorption of the synchrotron photons emitted by the power - law populations ( the second term of equation  ( [ eq : enth ] ) .",
    "therefore the magnitude of these terms relative to the viscous heating of the thermal electrons needs to be assessed .",
    "finally , the importance of the thermalization of the power - law distribution due to the coulomb term also needs to be understood .",
    "we first estimate the relative magnitude of the terms in equation  ( [ eq : ennt ] ) . the ratio of the energy loss of the power - law electrons due to coulomb collisions ( the last term ) to the energy emitted in synchrotron photons ( the second to last term ) determines whether coulomb collisions or synchrotron self - absorption is the dominant mechanism by which the non - thermal electrons cool .",
    "the hybrid spectra presented in this paper have been computed under the assumption that the power - law electrons lose energy primarily through synchrotron emission , and this needs to be checked for consistency . for a given electron velocity @xmath28 in the power - law distribution , the energy exchange rate with the thermal electrons is given by ( nayakshin & melia 1998 ) @xmath208 where @xmath209 is the coulomb logarithm , @xmath210 is the average thermal lorentz factor , @xmath211 is the thomson mean - free time and @xmath212 the electron density .",
    "the rate of energy loss of an electron of lorentz factor @xmath39 emitting synchrotron radiation in a region of magnetic field b is ( rybicki & lightman 1979 ) @xmath213 where @xmath214 is the time for the electron to lose half its energy . using the analytic expressions for the electron density and magnetic field strength given in @xmath215 and substituting values for the coefficients and parameters appropriate for sgr  a@xmath3",
    ", we find for an electron of a given @xmath39 : @xmath216 where r is the radius in scwarzschild units as usual .",
    "most of the emission in the low - frequency shoulder in the spectrum originates from around @xmath217 and the radiation is produced by electrons with @xmath218 ( cf .",
    "8c and the appendix ) .",
    "we thus see that the ratio in equation  ( [ eq : ratio ] ) is at most a few percent .",
    "this shows that coulomb collisions play a negligible role in the cooling of non - thermal electrons .",
    "it also shows that that the heating of thermal electrons by coulomb collisions is unimportant compared to energy exchange via synchrotron emission and absorption .",
    "we therefore neglect the coulomb term in the following calculations .",
    "the power - law electrons then obey a simple energy balance between the injected energy through viscous dissipation and the energy loss through synchrotron emission .",
    "the latter simply is the total frequency- and angle - integrated synchrotron emissivity of the non - thermal electrons because this population is optically thin to synchrotron emission .",
    "therefore , once @xmath219 is specified , it is possible to calculate the parameter @xmath44 , which describes the steady - state energy content of the power - law electrons , as a function of radius .",
    "conversely , if we specify @xmath45 as we did in the previous sections , it is possible to compute the energy @xmath203 that would need to be injected into the non - thermal electrons as a function of radius .",
    "we first study the latter case for @xmath220 constant , as this is the assumption we have made in most of this paper .",
    "figure 9 shows @xmath221 as a function of radius for one of the hybrid models of sgr a * with @xmath222 , and @xmath124 .",
    "the figure demonstrates that the energy input into the non - thermal electrons never exceeds @xmath223 of the heating of the thermal electrons and in fact does not exceed @xmath5 at those radii that contribute to the low - frequency shoulder in the spectrum @xmath224 .",
    "thus , at no radius in the flow do the power - law electrons become energetically more important than , or even comparable to , the thermal electrons .",
    "this may seem like a surprising result considering that the non - thermal radiation clearly dominates over the thermal emission in the low - frequency shoulder of the spectrum and in the high - frequency tail .",
    "however , the synchrotron emissivities of the thermal and power - law populations are different by many orders of magnitude at these frequencies .",
    "( optically thin synchrotron emission from a power - law population peaks at a much higher intensity and at a lower frequency than the thermal emission for the same energy density and magnetic field strength . ) therefore , even when the non - thermal population has less energy content than the thermal population , and even when a fraction of the non - thermal radiation is absorbed by the thermal electrons at frequencies where the flow is optically thick , the escaping radiation can still be dominated by the non - thermal emission and the intensity can be much above the blackbody limit .",
    "this is the situation in the low - frequency shoulder of the spectrum . in the high - frequency tail , the only particles that are energetic enough to produce the radiation are the non - thermal electrons , and since the flow is optically thin all the radiation escapes freely .",
    "incidentally , the fact that the energy input into the non - thermal electrons does not exceed @xmath223 of the heating of the thermal electrons ( and even this level is reached only over a small range of radius close to the black hole ) shows that the dynamics of the flow is not affected by the presence of non - thermal electrons .",
    "we also consider the other mechanism of energy exchange between the two populations , namely synchrotron self - absorption by thermal electrons .",
    "the second term in equation  ( [ eq : ennt ] ) measures the maximum energy that can be radiated by the non - thermal electrons as a function of radius .",
    "this term also represents an upper limit on the energy that can be transferred to the thermal population via self - absorption .",
    "this term is bounded from above by @xmath225 according to equation  ( [ eq : ennt ] ) .",
    "since @xmath221 never exceeds @xmath223 as shown in figure  9 , heating of the thermal electrons by absorbing synchrotron emission from non - thermal electrons can @xmath226 introduce a @xmath223 correction to the thermal energy equation ; the correction is only a few percent at large radius .",
    "this again justifies neglecting the contribution of the non - thermal electrons to the thermodynamic properties of the flow .",
    "finally we note that the calculations in the previous sections considered a simple parametrization of the non - thermal population via the quantity @xmath44 , which measures the fraction of the electron energy in steady state that is present in non - thermal electrons .",
    "now , @xmath44 is a secondary quantity whose value depends on the balance between non - thermal heating and cooling",
    ". it would perhaps be more useful to parametrize the model by specifying the non - thermal heating parameter @xmath203 .",
    "to this end , we consider models in which the energy injection rate varies as a power - law in radius , @xmath227 , and show results for @xmath228 between 0 and 1 .",
    "we pick the normalization of @xmath203 at the inner edge of the flow such that the resulting @xmath45 is comparable to the values used in @xmath12 and is in accord with the results of figure  9 . in figure  10a , we show @xmath45 for @xmath124 and three different choices of q : 0 , @xmath229 , and @xmath230 . for none of the three cases",
    "do we see very large variations in the resulting @xmath45 versus radius ; we find that @xmath45 rises with radius for @xmath231 and falls for larger values of @xmath228 .",
    "figure  10b shows the spectra corresponding to the three models of @xmath203 .",
    "we see that the two universal features of a hybrid spectrum , the low - frequency shoulder and the high - energy tail , are present for all values of @xmath228 .",
    "thus , super - thermal emission is not an artifact of specific assumptions or parameter values of our models but is indeed a robust signature of a hybrid population .",
    "the slope of the low - frequency shoulder depends very mildly on the particular model of @xmath232 .",
    "in this paper we considered hot accretion flows around supermassive black holes , using the adaf model as a typical example .",
    "such hot flows are expected to occur at low mass - accretion rates .",
    "we assume that a fraction of the viscous dissipation energy in the accretion flow goes into accelerating electrons to a non - thermal power - law distribution .",
    "we find that a power - law tail of high energy electrons can be sustained in such flows ; neither coulomb collisions nor synchrotron self - absorption is able to thermalize the power - law electrons .",
    "assuming that there are no other thermalizing mechanisms ( e.g. , collective plasma modes ) , we calculate the resulting hybrid thermal / non - thermal spectrum from such a plasma .",
    "the presence of even a population of non - thermal electrons gives rise to two universal and prominent features in the synchrotron spectrum : a low - frequency shoulder and a high - frequency tail ( fig .",
    "these features were identified by mahadevan ( 1998 ) who considered a specific mechanism ( via pion decay ) for the production of power - law electrons . even if only a small fraction of the total steady - state electron energy is in the non - thermal power - law component",
    ", we find that there is significant super - thermal emission in the low - frequency shoulder and the high frequency tail of the spectrum .",
    "furthermore , each of these universal features can be associated with a specific range of lorentz factors of the emitting electrons .",
    "the low - frequency shoulder is emitted by electrons with lorentz factors @xmath233 , while the high - energy tail is emitted by electrons with @xmath234 ( fig.8 ) .",
    "since the power - law electrons cause significant emission at low frequencies , comparing this low - frequency shoulder to data can provide stringent constraints on the fraction of the electron energy that is present in a non - thermal population . in the case of sgr  a@xmath3 ( fig .",
    "4 ) , we conclude that , in steady - state , electrons even with intermediate lorentz factors ( @xmath39 as low as 10 ) make up only a very small fraction of the electron population .",
    "since coulomb collisions and synchrotron self - absorption are ineffective in thermalizing these flows , this means that either the energy injected into a non - thermal population , @xmath235 , is small as in the calculations described in @xmath46 or there is some other efficient thermalization mechanism which plays a role in these flows .",
    "the study on sgr  a@xmath3 needs to be extended to other sources before we can judge how universal the result is .",
    "here it is important to emphasize two points regarding the constraints on non - thermal electrons obtained from the spectrum .",
    "first , for the part of the spectrum below the thermal peak , there is a mapping between each frequency in the spectrum and the thin shell of radii which predominantly emits at that frequency .",
    "this is due to the steep radial dependence of the synchrotron absorption that causes a sharp transition between optically thick and optically thin regions in the flow .",
    "therefore , emission at each frequency comes primarily from a specific radius in the flow and can be used to probe the non - thermal content in a shell that extends from that radius out to a somewhat larger radius .",
    "( mathematically , radiation emerging at each frequency comes from the entire range from the radius where the optical depth is unity out to infinity , but because the total emissivity also drops rapidly with radius , the biggest contribution to the intensity integral comes from a relatively narrow shell ) . as a result ,",
    "the constraints on the non - thermal distribution obtained from each frequency of the low - frequency shoulder apply only to electrons within this shell . inside the radius corresponding to optical depth unity ,",
    "the emission is heavily self - absorbed and the electron distribution there is inaccessible to observations .",
    "second , the constraints on the non - thermal energy content which we have obtained for sgr  a@xmath3 would not be invalidated if the observed low - frequency shoulder originated in a separate , extended region such as a jet or an outflow exterior to the accretion flow . in that case , the observed fluxes may be treated as upper limits to the emission from the inner accretion flow .",
    "this would imply that the non - thermal emission from the accretion flow is even smaller than in our models and the resulting constraints on the fraction of non - thermal electrons would become only tighter .",
    "when the non - thermal electron distribution is a power law , three parameters of the model and three corresponding pieces of physics can be extracted by comparing hybrid emission models to spectral data .",
    "the first parameter is @xmath44 , or equivalently @xmath203 ( cf.5 ) , which measures the fraction of the dissipated energy that goes into the non - thermal electrons .",
    "the second parameter is @xmath64 , the slope of the power - law energy distribution ( eq .  4 ) .",
    "this can be uniquely determined by measuring the spectral slope of the high - frequency tail in the spectrum ( provided there is no competing emission via compton scattering at these wavelengths , cf .",
    "1 ) . the value of @xmath64 may provide an indication of the mechanism by which the electrons in a hot accretion flow are accelerated into a power - law tail .",
    "the third parameter , which is more significant for distributions with @xmath135 , is @xmath72 , the maximum lorentz factor to which electrons are accelerated .",
    "if this parameter can be determined by an ir cutoff in the spectrum , it would provide information on the ratio of the acceleration timescale to the synchrotron cooling timescale .    due to the degeneracy of the low - frequency shoulder to the parameters @xmath44 and @xmath64 ( fig .",
    "4 ) , this segment of the spectrum by itself is not sufficient to constrain the two parameters .",
    "however , @xmath44 and @xmath64 may be determined uniquely if we have information on both the low - frequency shoulder and the high - frequency tail . for this to work",
    ", there should be no contamination from a jet or outflow to the observed radiation in the low - frequency shoulder or from compton scattering in the high frequency tail .",
    "we showed in this paper that the presence of a non - thermal population of electrons also has measurable effects on the shape of the image of the source , and the size of the accretion flow , as a function of frequency ( figs .",
    "because the frequency dependence of the image size is strongly affected by the fraction of non - thermal electrons in the flow , measuring the size of accretion flows at multiple wavelengths can provide a quantitative constraint on the non - thermal electron energy content .",
    "moreover , the brightness temperature of the source as a whole , as well as the variation of the brightness temperature across the source , at long wavelengths behave differently for a hybrid plasma compared to a purely thermal population of electrons .",
    "finally , at the frequencies corresponding to the low - frequency shoulder , we show that there would be limb brightening of the image .",
    "all these image - related signatures may help to identify the presence of a non - thermal population of electrons , and the parameters of the corresponding energy distribution .",

    "the best fit gives @xmath261 substituting @xmath260 into @xmath262 and @xmath263 we get @xmath264 and @xmath265 finally , we compute the harmonic number defined in @xmath253 : @xmath266 @xmath267 which provides all the necessary synchrotron expressions as a function of black hole mass , mass accretion rate and frequency .      we can now derive analytic estimates for the contribution of the non - thermal emission to the low - frequency shoulder and the high - frequency tail . in the optically thick shoulder , self - absorption of the synchrotron emission",
    "is done predominantly by the thermal electrons , and we find that absorption due to non - thermal electrons are negligible down to a frequency of @xmath268 as discussed above .",
    "thus the source function will take the form @xmath269 where @xmath34 is synchrotron emissivity per unit volume given in @xmath253 .    for the analytic approximations , we will use a simplified form of the thermal emissivity .",
    "we first take the fully relativistic limit derived first by pacholczyk , which is equivalent to setting @xmath97 and @xmath98 equal to 1 in @xmath270 .",
    "we further neglect the second and third terms of the sum altogether by setting @xmath271 and @xmath98 equal to zero as these terms provide only a very small correction unimportant for the present purposes .",
    "thus , in simplified form , the ratio of the two emissivities is given by @xmath272 where @xmath273 and all other quantities are as defined as before .",
    "the non - thermal emission dominates over the thermal emission in the spectrum when @xmath274 .",
    "this ratio can be easily computed using the expressions for @xmath275 , and @xmath276 evaluated at the @xmath277 radius given above .",
    "the power law emission beyond the thermal peak is optically thin and hence the excess in this region depends sensitively on the power - law index as expected and is simply given by the optically thin synchrotron emission from the power - law electrons .",
    "the amount of emission is determined simply by @xmath35 .",
    "we finally note that , for the small values of @xmath44 considered here , thermal emission dominates at the thermal peak .",
    "the strong dependence of the position and the normalization of the thermal peak on @xmath278 and @xmath279 is discussed by mahadevan ( 1997 ) .",
    "the shape of the low - frequency shoulder is dominated by the emission of the power - law population and absorption by the thermal electrons . in order to determine the spectral slope of this segment",
    ", we therefore first calculate the hybrid source function @xmath280 at the surface of unit optical depth . to convert this into a luminosity",
    ", we multiply the source function by the area of the @xmath281 surface .",
    "if we write the shoulder of the spectrum as @xmath282 , the spectral slope @xmath59 is then given by @xmath283 which gives the canonical value of @xmath284 for the mass and mass - accretion rate of sgr  a@xmath3 and scales ( weakly ) according to the expression above for other masses and accretion rates .",
    "one can immediately see that the spectral slope depends very weakly on p , only as @xmath285 , thus demonstrating again the independence of the spectral slope of the low - frequency shoulder on the shape of the electron energy distribution .",
    "the slope of the optically thin power law emission is a well - known result , @xmath286 which in @xmath155 for @xmath135 , flat for p=3 and falls off for @xmath77 .",
    "it is independent of the black hole mass and the accretion rate ."
