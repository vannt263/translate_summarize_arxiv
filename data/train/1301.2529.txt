    "this was originally proved by david , see e.g. @xcite and @xcite , under the additional assumption @xmath74 for all @xmath75 .",
    "a proof for all kernels satisfying ( [ ker ] ) can be found in @xcite .",
    "it follows that all such @xmath1-dimensional kernels satisfy the hypotheses of theorem [ main ] .",
    "relating the @xmath76-boundedness of @xmath77 with the geometric structure of @xmath8 is a hard and largely unresolved problem .",
    "after david s result in @xcite , david and semmes proved a result that goes in the converse direction .",
    "in @xcite they showed that the @xmath76 boundedness of all operators associated with convolution , odd , @xmath78 away from the origin @xmath79 kernels imply that the measure @xmath8 is @xmath2-uniformly rectifiable .",
    "the david - semmes conjecture , dating from 1991 , asks if the @xmath76-boundedness of the operators associated with just one of these kernels , specifically to the @xmath2-dimensional riesz kernel @xmath80 , suffices to imply @xmath2-uniform rectifiabilty .",
    "the conjecture has been very recently resolved in @xcite in the codimension 1 case , that is for @xmath81 .",
    "mattila , melnikov and verdera in @xcite had earlier proved the conjecture in the case of @xmath82-dimensional riesz kernels . for all other dimensions and for other kernels",
    "few things are known .",
    "there are several examples of kernels whose boundedness does not imply rectifiability , see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . on the other hand in @xcite the kernels @xmath83 were considered and it was proved that the @xmath84-boundedness of the operators associated with any of these kernels implies rectifiability . by now , these are the only known examples of convolution kernels",
    "not directly related to the riesz kernels with this property .    with the previous discussion in mind ,",
    "theorem [ main ] elaborates that the boundedness of @xmath85 with @xmath8 and @xmath22 being separated measures as in the theorem holds much more generally than the boundedness of @xmath77 from @xmath76 to @xmath76 .",

    "in @xcite it was shown that for a smaller class of kernels and for @xmath56 the operators @xmath43 are bounded from @xmath34 to @xmath37 and from @xmath37 to @xmath34 whenever @xmath8 and @xmath22 have @xmath1-growth and they are separated by @xmath1-lipschitz graphs",
    ". theorem [ main ] extends the admissible boundaries from lipschitz graphs to uniformly rectifiable sets and moreover it covers the endpoint weak-(1,1 ) case , which did not follow from the methods in @xcite and thus it was left untreated there .",
    "our proof follows an altogether different approach which makes use of new caldern - zygmund decompositions partially inspired by the techniques in @xcite .",
    "we should also remark that our proof , as well as the one in @xcite , makes extended use of the following theorem of david from @xcite .",

    "then the operators @xmath87 and @xmath88 are bounded for all @xmath89 ,    using an example based on the four - corners cantor set we prove that there exist @xmath82-growth measures @xmath22 and @xmath8 , @xmath8 not @xmath62-regular , such that the cauchy singular integral operator , which is associated with the cauchy kernel @xmath90 , is bounded in @xmath76 but not from @xmath76 to @xmath91 . hence we show that theorem [ davgen ] fails without the @xmath62-regularity assumption on @xmath8 .",
    "on the other hand the use of caldern - zygmund decompositions can be exploited even further as only minor modifications in the proof of theorem [ main ] allow us to prove the following endpoint result which , as far as we know , is new .",
    "[ davgenw ] under the assumptions of theorem [ davgen ] the operator @xmath43 is bounded from @xmath92 to @xmath59 . in particular @xmath61 is bounded .",
    "let us remark that the boundedness of the operator @xmath93 also holds .",
    "this is due to the fact that the boundedness of @xmath77 in @xmath76 implies the boundedness from @xmath94 to @xmath45 ( see @xcite or ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 2 ) , for example ) .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section 2",
    "we prove the appropriate caldern - zygmund decompositions needed for the proof of theorem [ main ] and in section 3 we prove theorem [ main ] .",
