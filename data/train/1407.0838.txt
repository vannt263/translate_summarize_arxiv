    "the construction of difference equations , written as invariants of the continuous group of symmetries of differential equations , is part of a project to apply symmetry group methods to the numerical solution of differential equations @xcite .",
    "this project has accomplished a significative advance since its first introduction last century . in particular ,",
    "the construction of invariant schemes has proven to be a very fruitful approach in the construction of numerical schemes for ordinary differential equations @xcite , in cases when the usual approaches present serious problems of convergence and accuracy , for instance , in the behavior of the solutions in the neighborhood of a singularity . in this problem a deeper understanding of the mathematics involved in its relation with numerics can provide results important for their applications to problems in physics and mathematics .",
    "the usual procedure in this framework is to compute the symmetry group of the differential equation and then compute the invariant lattice and invariant difference equation with respect to the symmetry group .",
    "however , since the differential and difference calculus present substantial differences , a special care has to be taken to assure the consistency of the approach .",
    "for example , the clairaut  schwarz ",
    "young theorem on the equality of the cross derivatives , which is satisfied in the continuous case under some mild conditions on the functions , is not valid in the discrete case for a general lattice .",
    "recently it has been shown @xcite that the discrete clairaut  schwarz  young theorem , equality of the cross differences , imposes strong restrictions on the lattice . moreover , the construction of the discrete invariant scheme starting from the discrete invariants is not at all obvious as it is usually obtained by finding a proper combination of the continuous limits of the various discrete invariants .",
    "the main idea guiding the construction of the whole scheme , that is the difference equations and the equations defining the lattice , which in some cases are mixed , is that the continuous limit yields the differential equation and trivial identities .    this article is a continuation of our work on the construction of partial difference schemes @xcite . in the previous work we concentrated on the clairaut ",
    "schwarz  young theorem .",
    "here we introduce by a one to one correspondence a new set of discrete coordinates which describe the partial difference equation on the lattice . in terms of these coordinate systems",
    "we can write immediately the discrete counterpart of any continuous invariant .",
    "so we can discretize in a straightforward way any partial differential equation described in terms of the invariants of a group of symmetries .    a particular role in the construction of discrete invariant schemes",
    "is played by the lattice .",
    "consequently the clairaut",
    " schwarz ",
    "young theorem can play an important role in discriminating compatible lattice schemes , i.e. the combination of the discrete equation and its lattice .    in section 2 we study schemes for scalar partial differential equations and show the constraints on the group transformations due to the clairaut ",
    "schwarz  young theorem . using these results , in section 3",
    "we construct in a standard way the invariant discrete potential burgers and in section 4 , we study it numerically for two different lattices , one invariant and schwarzian and one not , for two different exact solutions of the differential equation .",
    "some concluding remarks are presented in section 5 .",
    "in the case of ordinary difference equations of order @xmath0 for one dependent variable @xmath1 and one independent variable @xmath2 , a natural scheme is given by the points @xmath3 for some fixed @xmath4 .",
    "an alternative equivalent set of coordinates on the scheme is given by @xcite : \\{x_n , u_n , p_n+1^(1),p^(2)_n+2,p^(3)_n+3,p^(4)_n+4 , ",

    "n ( x_n , u_n ) _ u_n [ e3 - 4 ] to the new variables ( [ e3 - 7 ] ) , we obtain x&=&_n ( x_n , u_n ) _ x_n + _ n ( x_n , u_n ) _ u_n + _ k=1^k ^(k ) _ h_n+k + _ k=1^k _ n+k^(k ) _ p^(k)_n+k [ e3 - 10 ] the general formulas for the coefficients @xmath7 and @xmath8 are ^(k ) & = & _ n+k - _ n+k-1 , [ e3 - 11 ] + ^(k)_n+k&=&d_x ^(k-1)_n+k-1 - p^(k)_n+k d_x _ n k = 1,2 , , k. it is worthwhile to notice that both the higher order discrete derivatives and their corresponding prolongations are written in terms of @xmath2 , @xmath1 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and their difference consequences obtained by applying the operator @xmath11 given in ( [ e3 - 8 ] ) .",
    "this way of constructing invariant ordinary difference equations is easily extendible to the case of partial difference equations .    for partial difference equations",
    "we consider here only , for simplicity , the case of one dependent variable and two independent variables as will be the example we will discuss in the following section . moreover , as we will deal with a nonlinear partial difference equation of second order we limit ourselves to a scheme of six points ( @xmath12 ) , ( @xmath13 ) , ( @xmath14 ) , ( @xmath15 ) , ( @xmath16 ) , ( @xmath17 ) , the minimum number of points necessary to get all partial second derivatives as first order approximations .",
    "the variables @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 in all points correspond to 18 data , 12 related to the independent variables and 6 to the dependent one .",
    "the extension to more variables and higher order equations requires just more points but it is straightforward .",
    "having 12 data for the independent variables we can construct from them 10 differences x_0,0 , y_0,0,&&h^x_0,0=x_1,0-x_0,0 , h^y_0,0=y_0,1-y_0,0 , ^x_0,0=x_0,1-x_0,0 , ^y_0,0=y_1,0-y_0,0 , + & & h^x_1,0=x_2,0-x_1,0 , h^y_0,1=y_0,2-y_0,1 , ^x_0,1=x_0,2-x_0,1 , ^y_1,0=y_2,0-y_1,0 , + [ f_1 ] & & h^x_0,1=x_1,1-x_0,1 , h^y_1,0=y_1,1-y_1,0 , where for convenience of notation here and in the following , whenever it may not create misunderstanding , we have indicated just the distance from the values @xmath12 of the indices . from the values of the dependent variables in the 6 points",
    "we can calculate the 6 quantities [ f_2 ] u_0,0 , d_x u_0,0 , d_y u_0,0 , [ d_x]^2 u_0,0 , [ d_y]^2 u_0,0 , d_x d_y u_0,0 , where the operators @xmath11 and @xmath21 , introduced in @xcite , are given by @xmath22 with @xmath23 and @xmath24    these operators are the discrete counterpart of the partial derivatives in the @xmath25 axes directions , written in terms of the partial difference operators in the lattice directions , which , generically , do not coincide with the cartesian axes .",
    "see @xcite for a more detailed description .",
    "note that @xmath26 is not independent from the 6 quantities ( [ f_2 ] ) .",
    "it can be written in term of ( [ f_1 ] ) and ( [ f_2 ] ) . for a generic lattice",

    "the burgers equation [ b1 ] u_t = u_xx+u u_x , a very well known partial differential equation , appears as a simplification of the navier  stokes equation and has been studied from many , if not all , points of view @xcite .",

    ", the burgers equation degenerates into a quasilinear first order equation which is the prototype of a class of equations which presents nonlinear phenomena such as shock waves .",
    "in fact , the limit @xmath70 allows the study of these shock wave solutions as limits of the solutions of the viscous burgers equation .",
    "in particular , although the inviscid burgers equation has an infinite dimensional group of symmetries ( being a first order equation ) , the limit of the symmetry group of the viscous burgers equations provides a subgroup of the whole group of symmetries of the inviscid burgers equation which is a useful tool in the study of the equation and in particular its discretization using invariant techniques .",
    "several invariant discretization approaches have been proposed to construct explicit numerical schemes for finding numerical solutions on invariant lattices @xcite . in some of these works ,",
    "explicit comparison has been made , showing the higher accuracy and stability of these methods @xcite .",

    "young theorem from the numerical point of view . for the control of the numerical calculations we will study the time evolution of the initial condition provided by exact solutions of the burgers equation . to simplify the presentation and with no loss of generality we will go over to consider the * potential burgers * equation as this is point transformable into the linear heat equation for which many exact solutions are known .",
    "let us construct using the formulas introduced in the previous section the discrete scheme which preserves the point symmetries of the potential burgers equation [ k_0 ] u_y - u_xx - u_x^2 = 0 .",

    "the infinitesimal generator @xmath72 is the one responsible for the linearizability of the potential burgers equation as it provides its linearizing transformation [ 21c ] = e^u .",
