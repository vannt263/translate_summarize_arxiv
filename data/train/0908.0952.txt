    "the interplay between star formation and agn activity may play a key role in the establishment of the bh - bulge correlation .",
    "however , in quasars ( luminous agns ) , observational constrains on the bh / star - formation relationship are rare due to the difficulty in measuring the star formation rate ( sfr ) around the bright quasar nuclei .",
    "the host galaxy morphology and colors provide the first insight into the level of star formation . at low redshift ( @xmath4 0.5 )",
    ", decades of effort have been devoted to imaging the host galaxies of uv / optically - selected type 1 quasars @xcite .",
    "important technical developments , especially with space - based and adaptive optics ( ao ) instruments , have provided observations with dramatically improved spatial resolution , stable psfs and large dynamic range , which are keys to extracting quantitative information on host galaxies surrounding the bright agn .",
    "radio - loud quasars are found to be associated with luminous early - type galaxies with structure parameters indistinguishable from those of quiescent ellipticals @xcite .",
    "radio - quiet quasars reside on average in less luminous galaxies with diverse morphologies that show some dependence on the host and nuclear luminosity , i.e. , more frequently of early type for the more luminous nuclei and hosts @xcite . at @xmath5 @xmath6 -23 , roughly 50% of quasar hosts show normal elliptical morphologies @xcite .",
    "the fraction of bright quasar hosts with ongoing merging features is 10 - 30% @xcite .",
    "however , this merger fraction may be under - estimated especially at the late merging stage where the tidal tails become relatively faint .",
    "such a bias has been demonstrated by the discoveries of merger remnants in quiescent elliptical hosts @xcite .",
    "the merger fraction for near - ir - selected quasars @xcite and far - ir excess quasars @xcite is much higher ( @xmath750% ) @xcite .",
    "however , it is unclear if this is because tidal features are relatively easily detected in ir - selected quasars with low nuclear / host - light contrast or if there is an evolutionary difference between quasars selected in the uv / optical and those selected in the ir .",
    "the study of stellar populations in quasar hosts using uv / optical spectra has provided another significant constraint on their star formation properties , mainly through detecting the presence of the young- ( @xmath8100 myr ) , intermediate- ( @xmath30.1 - 1gyr ) or old- ( @xmath310gyr ) stellar populations . however , in both type-1 and type-2 quasars , the nuclear radiation strongly dilutes the young stellar features , such as the pcygni uv lines and the 4650@xmath9 wr bump , and dominates the line emission of sfr tracers used for normal galaxies .",
    "the mean - age - indicator 4000@xmath9 break and intermediate - age - indicator ( @xmath30.1 - 1 gyr ) h@xmath10 absorption line also suffer from dilution by nuclear light . despite these difficulties , and inconsistent with the implication of the early - type host morphologies ,",
    "an intermediate - age stellar population is present at a significant level . off - nuclear",
    "( @xmath7@xmath315 kpc ) uv / optical spectra of quasars indicate that old stellar populations dominate @xcite .",
    "however , with much deeper spectra a significant fraction ( 10% in mass fraction ) of an intermediate - age population is revealed @xcite . in type-2 agns and less luminous type-1 objects where the nuclear radiation contamination is less severe ,",
    "the presence of an intermediate - age stellar population has been extensively confirmed @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it seems there is a decrease in the mean stellar age with increasing agn luminosity @xcite .",
    "techniques that are more suitable for detecting ongoing / recent ( @xmath8 100 myr ) star formation have been employed recently , although their accuracy is still not comparable to those for normal galaxies . as the material reservoir of star formation , the cold molecular gas mass roughly correlates with the level of star formation .",
    "it has been found that quasar hosts are rich in cold molecular gas @xcite , implying significant ongoing star formation activity . with",
    "space - based and ao instruments , spatially - resolved images of sfr tracers are promising ways to quantify the sfr and characterize the spatial distribution of the star - forming regions .",
    "for example , the extended pa@xmath11 emission in pg1126 - 041 is most likely associated with an intense nuclear ( 100pc ) starburst embedded in the old bulge @xcite .    a new method to measure the sfr of local quasar hosts is to use the mid - infrared aromatic bands @xcite measured with the spitzer space telescope . in field galaxies , these emission bands are universally bright in roughly solar metallicity regions of star formation , with well understood relationships to the sfr ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "their carriers appear to be destroyed by the harsh radiation fields around high - luminosity agns @xcite and thus any detected aromatic emission is likely from the host galaxy .    in @xcite",
    ", we provided further evidence for the star - formation origin of the aromatic features in quasar hosts : ( 1 ) both the overall shape of the aromatic features and the distribution of the 7.7@xmath1m/11.3@xmath1 m feature ratio are similar to those in star forming galaxies ; ( 2 ) the larger the equivalent widths of the aromatic features , the stronger the far - ir emission in the global seds of quasars ; ( 3 ) quasars lie on the trend of normal galaxies in the plane of the molecular gas mass and the aromatic - derived sf ir luminosity . by measuring the aromatic feature fluxes in a large quasar sample ( @xmath3200 objects including pg , 2mass & 3cr ) , we obtained a quantitative census of star formation activity in low - redshift quasar hosts @xcite .",
    "we showed that quasar hosts have a flatter star formation infrared ( sfir ) luminosity function ( lf ) than field galaxies , i.e. , the quasars lie in very luminous star forming galaxies more often than would be the case for a random sampling of galaxies without nuclear activity .",
    "as a summary , type-1 quasars at low redshift ( @xmath12 0.5 ) mainly reside in luminous early - type host galaxies but harbor a significant ( @xmath710% ) fraction of intermediate - age stellar populations and are experiencing intense star formation activity .",
    "these properties are rare for normal galaxies , implying that the quasar appears at a special stage of galaxy evolution . in this paper",
    ", we probe whether type-1 quasar host galaxies at @xmath2 @xmath3 1 have similar characteristics .",
    "as demonstrated in our low - redshift work @xcite , the aromatic feature observed with _ spitzer _",
    "provides efficient measurements of the sfr in quasar hosts with significantly improved accuracy . to constrain the star - formation",
    "/ quasar interplay at high redshift and to characterize the cosmic evolution of star formation in quasar hosts , we have carried out irs observations of a complete optically - selected type-1 quasar sample ( 57 objects ) at @xmath0 1 to constrain their sfrs .",

    ", any star - forming signature would be missed by spatially - resolved image studies that always exclude the central region as a result of subtracting the diffracted nuclear light .",

    "high - resolution molecular gas mapping has revealed a large gas concentration in the circum - nuclear region for tens of quasars @xcite .",
    "as the low - luminosity counterparts of quasars , nearby seyfert galaxies frequently harbor circum - nuclear starbursts @xcite , although enhanced star formation also occurs in the spiral disks of seyfert 2 galaxies @xcite .",
    "quasars , with higher luminosity and thus larger mass inflow , probably harbor more intense circum - nuclear starbursts . as shown in figure  [ evl_sf_qso](b ) , quasar hosts have on average lirg - level sfrs . in normal local galaxies ,",
    "such intense star formation is normally achieved only in the circumnuclear region ( for a review , see * ? ? ?",
    "studies of stellar populations through broad - band seds and optical spectra have discovered intermediate - age stars or bluer colors in agn hosts compared to their inactive galaxy counterparts at both low redshift @xcite and high redshift @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we show that the spectral features employed by current studies of stellar populations are not sensitive to on - going ( @xmath60.1 gyr ) starburst activity .",
    "the continuum shape is useful to detect the presence of the young stellar population only if the spectrum extends shorter than 4000@xmath9 or the broad - band sed includes u - band . at low redshift ,",
    "it is difficult to achieve good coverage of the spectrum / sed at such short wavelengths .",
    "thus our result of enhanced sfrs does not contradict studies based on the continuum shape at @xmath33 @xmath7 4000 @xmath9 that detect intermediate - age stellar populations @xcite . on the other hand , at @xmath33 @xmath6 4000 @xmath9 the contrast between nuclear- and host - light in type 1 agns becomes much higher compared to the value at redder wavelengths .",
    "the subtraction of the nuclear light always introduces large errors on the resulting host brightness . even in type 2",
    "agns , the scattered nuclear uv light is sometimes important or even dominates @xcite .",
    "more importantly , obscuration can hide blue host - galaxy light if star formation occurs in the circum - nuclear region as discussed above .",
    "therefore , results based on spectra extending shorter than @xmath6 4000 @xmath9 may still underestimate significantly the level of on - going star - formation activity @xcite .",
    "@xcite employed the 4000 @xmath9 break and h@xmath10 absorption to study stellar populations and found intermediate - age stars in hosts with early - type morphologies .",
    "the 4000 @xmath9 break is caused by metal line absorptions .",
    "in hot stars with age @xmath6 0.1 gyr ( see fig . 2 of @xcite ) , the 4000 @xmath9 break is small ( @xmath61.15 ) and insensitive to the stellar age .",
    "moreover , the 4000 @xmath9 break is a luminosity - weighted mean - age indicator and thus does not have the temporal resolution to separate young stars from dominant old stars in a massive host galaxy .",
    "h@xmath10 absorption arises in late - b to early - f stars and is thus only prominent 0.1 - 1 gyr after star formation @xcite .",
    "therefore , the two probes are not sensitive to ongoing star formation activity .",
    "in addition , stellar - age - dependent obscuration may also completely hide the effect of massive ob stars on these two features .",
    "in fact , such selective obscuration may be the reason for the presence of some lirgs whose optical spectra show strong h@xmath10 absorption but weak o[ii ] emission @xcite .",
    "studies based on the whole sdss spectrum suffer from similar problems @xcite , as the continuum shape may be affected by extinction and nuclear light contamination while all the available stellar features ( balmer break , high order balmer absorption line , 4000@xmath9 break and ca ii ( h&k ) ) are not sensitive to the current star formation whose characteristic features ( mainly nebular emission lines ) are contaminated severely by the nuclear radiation in both type 1 and type 2 objects .    in a summary , by integrating different studies , we now have a more complete census of the stellar population in type-1 quasar hosts , which appear to be massive galaxies presumably dominated by old stars , but that harbor a significant fraction ( 10% ) of intermediate - age stellar populations , and are experiencing intense circum - nuclear star formation .",
    "the direct measurements of sfrs in quasar hosts can provide new insights into the mechanism that shapes the @xmath99-@xmath29 relationship .",
    "figure  [ evl_sf_qso](c ) shows the redshift evolution for the ratio of the sfr in quasar hosts to the black hole growth rate , obtained by dividing the integral sfir luminosity function by the integral bh growth rate function .",
    "the sfir luminosity is converted to the sfr using the @xcite relations as shown above .",
    "the bh growth rate function is obtained from the quasar @xmath100-band luminosity function using @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is the bolometric luminosity , @xmath103 is the mass to energy conversion efficiency , @xmath104 is the bh growth rate and @xmath105 is the bolometric correction for the @xmath100-band luminosity @xmath106 .",
    "figure  [ evl_sf_qso](c ) shows the result for @xmath103=0.1 and @xmath105=11.8 , where the quasar @xmath100-band luminosity functions are given by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "as shown in the figure , the sfr/@xmath104 in quasar hosts is almost constant with redshift and has a value of @xmath310 , much lower than that expected from the @xmath107-@xmath29 relationship .",
    "this result rules out the simple model that the bh accretion and star formation evolve with a fixed ratio as given by the @xmath107-@xmath29 relation at any time for individual objects .",
