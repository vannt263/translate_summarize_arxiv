    "bl lacertae objects are an extreme type of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , whose hallmark is their  featureless \" optical spectrum . by definition , any emission lines present must have rest @xmath0 ; e.g. , @xcite .",
    "bl lacs are a member of the blazar class ; and like other blazars , they are characterized by their rapid variability , polarized optical and radio emission and their flat - spectrum radio emission .",
    "see @xcite for an excellent summary of their properties .",
    "due to their luminous emission at these wavelengths , bl lacs have been primarily discovered via x - ray and radio surveys ; thus , traditionally they have been labeled as radio - selected and x - ray - selected ( rbls and xbls respectively ) . in recent years",
    "this terminology has given way to a more physically meaningful classification based upon the overall spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the object . in ",
    "low - energy - peaked \" blazars ( lbls ) , the peak of the synchrotron radiation occurs at radio / ir wavelengths , whereas in  high - energy - peaked \" blazars ( hbls ) this peak occurs in the uv / x - ray .",
    "historically , optical surveys have not been efficient in discovering bl lacs @xcite .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that , until recently , known bl lacs have shown a bimodal distribution of logarithmic x - ray to radio flux ratios , log(@xmath1 )  from 1  kev to 5  ghz , with an approximate dividing line defined by log(@xmath1 )  @xmath2 @xcite . for the most part xbls",
    "are hbls and rbls are lbls , although exceptions do exist ( e.g. , mkn 501 is an hbl in the 1jy rbl sample ) .",
    "we choose to use the term hbl when referring to the bl lacs studied herein because all were chosen with a log(@xmath1 )  @xmath3 criterion .",
    "new surveys , e.g. , the rosat - green bank ( rgb ) survey @xcite and the dxrbs survey @xcite , have found bl lacs with intermediate log(@xmath1 )  values , indicating a continuum of seds in bl lacs and likely rendering the lbl / hbl terminology obsolete .",
    "the detailed properties of these new bl lac objects with intermediate log(@xmath1 )  values are not yet well - known .",
    "so , although lbls and hbls have different observed properties ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , it is not yet known whether lbls and hbls are distinct classes of agn or merely extremes of a continuum of properties for a single class of agn .",
    "we have therefore chosen to include three intermediate objects from the rgb sample in our sample of study .",
    "most bl lacs are believed to be low - power radio galaxies whose jet axes are oriented at small angles to the line of sight ; and as such their jets are relativistically beamed , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed that hbls and lbls are both beamed , low - luminosity fr - i radio galaxies , and that the observed differences between the two classes is a result of orientation . in this unification model ,",
    "hereafter the  orientation \" model , hbls are believed to be viewed further from the jet axis than lbls @xcite .",
    "the comparable x - ray luminosities for hbls and lbls require that either the beam pattern or physical jet opening angle for the x - ray emission is larger than than for the radio emission , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "several observed properties are consistent with this hypothesis . compared to lbls ,",
    "hbls are more numerous , their cores are less radio luminous , and they are less optically variable @xcite .",
    "hbls also emit less compact radio emission @xcite , contain larger fractions of starlight in the optical @xcite , and have smaller degrees of optical polarization , often with a preferred optical polarization angle , @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "however , several observed properties which should be independent of orientation , e.g. , observed evolution , optical emission - line strengths and extended radio powers , do not agree between hbls and lbls , indicating that orientation alone is insufficient to explain the observed distinctions between the two classes @xcite .",
    "in fact , many lbls appear to be beamed , high - luminosity fr - iis ; and at least one is a gravitationally lensed object , the  smallest einstein ring \" object 1jy 0218 + 357 @xcite .",
    "the picture seems to be more clear for hbls , whose properties are very consistent with being beamed fr - is @xcite .",
    "several observations support this picture , e.g. , extended radio luminosity and morphology @xcite , host galaxy luminosity and morphology @xcite , and comparative space densities and luminosity functions @xcite .",
    "alternatively , it has also been suggested that the difference between lbls and hbls lies not in orientation , but in the high - energy cutoff in their energy distributions , such that hbls and lbls represent a single family of objects with a smooth energy distribution followed by a sharp cutoff . for lbls",
    "this cutoff occurs in the near - ir / optical and for hbls it is at uv / x - ray or higher energies @xcite . in this model ,",
    "hereafter the  energy - cutoff \" model , hbls have intrinsically lower radio luminosities than lbls , and strong selection effects explain why most known bl lacs are of the hbl variety .",
    "observational studies of bl lacs at radio wavelengths have proven to be an effective test of unification models for two reasons .",
    "first , the kpc - scale extended radio flux is likely unbeamed , and is therefore indicative of the actual agn power ; and second , the core and parsec - scale extended flux is highly beamed , and is therefore strongly dependent on the orientation and relativistic nature of the jet .",
    "if hbls are seen further off axis than lbls , radio images will reveal several distinct trends .",
    "first , relativistic doppler boosting and apparent proper motion are strongly sensitive to the orientation angle and bulk lorentz factor of the jet .",
    "thus , if seen close to their jet axis , lbls should be more core - dominated , show more instances of superluminal motion and have larger jet to counter - jet brightness ratios . and",
    "if hbls and lbls share the same parent population , both should have similar jet lorentz factors .",
    "second , geometrical projection effects will cause jets with intrinsically small bends to appear highly distorted when seen close to the line of sight .",
    "thus , the projected jet position angle ( pa ) in these highly inclined objects is very sensitive to the jet structure .",
    "it is known that lbls show a wide range of parsec- and kpc - scale jet misalignment angles ( @xmath5  @xmath6 ) , presumably from a  knotty \" or helical jet seen close to the line of sight @xcite .",
    "if hbls are seen further off - axis than lbls , geometrical projection effects will cause the parsec- and kpc - scale projected jet pas of hbls to be more aligned than lbls .",
    "if the  energy - cutoff \" model is correct and there is no orientation bias , lbls and hbls should show similar parsec- and kpc - scale radio structure , similar distributions of parsec- and kpc - scale jet misalignment , assuming they share the same parent population .",
    "but since lbls are generally more luminous than hbls @xcite , their parsec - scale structures may differ intrinsically from hbls . in this paper",
    "we present deep vla and first - epoch vlba observations of a sample of fifteen bl lacs which span the full range of log(@xmath1 )  seen in hbls (  2 ) .",
    "these maps are used to compare the parsec and kpc - scale structure of these objects . in ",
    "3 we discuss the results of these observations , compare them to similar studies of lbls and discuss their implications for unification models .",
    "as these are only the first epoch of observations , proper motions of jet components are not yet available ; thus we consider only the alignment and structure of the parsec - scale jets . in ",
    "4 we present the conclusions .",
    "due to their relative radio faintness , few hbls have been studied with vlbi techniques . @xcite presented images of four hbls from the bright heao 1 survey @xcite , all of which have log(@xmath1 )  values close to the lbl / hbl boundary .",
    "conway et al .",
    "( private comm . ) completed vlba observations of eight hbls from the _ einstein _ medium sensitivity survey @xcite ; however , parsec - scale extended structure was not detected in most of these objects , most likely due to their faintness ( @xmath7 mjy at 5  ghz ) .    in order",
    "to better determine the parsec - scale structure of hbls , we completed deep vla and vlba observations of a sample of hbls that covers a factor of @xmath830 in log(@xmath1 ) .",
    "the initial goal was to determine their morphology and core dominance on vlbi scales as well as to measure the projected alignment of their parsec- and kpc - scale radio jets . at the time this project was begun ,",
    "the availability of phase - reference calibrators for the vlba was limited , so we chose only targets which were likely bright enough for self - calibration ( @xmath9 mjy at 4.964 ghz )",
    ". since hbls are for the most part too radio faint to observe a statistically complete sample without phase referencing , we chose a sample that represented the full range of log(@xmath1 )  values observable in hbls , as shown in figure  [ fig-1 ] .",
    "our sample was selected primarily from the _ einstein _  slew \" survey ( 1es ; @xcite ) .",
    "objects that are lbl - like ( i.e. , log(@xmath1 )  @xmath10 ) were discarded .",
    "this sample was supplemented with three objects from the rgb bl lac sample to fill in the log(@xmath1 )  distribution with objects intermediate to lbls and hbls .",
    "the final sample consists of fifteen hbls with an even distribution of log(@xmath1 )  ranging from @xmath116 to @xmath12 , and is compared to the complete 1jy lbl sample in figure  [ fig-1 ] .",
    "a summary of the sample properties is given in table  [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "the columns are : [ 1 ] the object name ; [ 2 - 3 ] the right ascension and declination in j2000 coordinates ; [ 4 ] the log(@xmath1 )  value @xcite ; and [ 5 ] the redshift @xcite . the redshifts for 1es 0647 + 250 and 1es 1028 + 511 are marked with a colon because they are tentative .",
    "twelve bl lacs in our sample were observed with the nrao very long baseline array ( vlba ) on 17 may 1997 .",
    "we chose to observe at 4.964 ghz in order to obtain both high resolution and high sensitivity to maximize the probability of detecting and resolving faint vlbi jets in these compact objects .",
    "a single 24-hour time allocation was used with the complete vlba array of 10 x 25 m antennas .",
    "this allowed approximately twelve 6.5-minute scans per source , which were well - spaced in hour angle for optimal ( @xmath13 ) plane coverage . to minimize potential phase and amplitude errors due to poor source positions in the correlator model , high - resolution ",
    "snapshots \" were completed with the nrao very large array ( vla ) b - array at 3.6 cm prior to the vlba observations to obtain core positions with 0.01  accuracy .",
    "these are the positions given in table  [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "the data were initially calibrated with the aips software package in the standard manner .",
    "self - calibration and imaging were then done with the difmap software package @xcite .",
    "the resultant maps each have an rms noise level of @xmath14 mjy beam@xmath15 .",

    "all of the objects except for 1es 0647 + 250 and 1es",
    "1028 + 511 are clearly resolved ; however these two objects do show evidence for very faint extended structure . in all sources 60% to 90% of the vla core flux , as determined by snapshots in @xcite , was detected on parsec scales .",
    "all of the resolved objects show a core - jet morphology , as is typical of lbls and core - dominated quasars @xcite .",
    "all are core dominated on parsec scales ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "some sources show a well - collimated jet with discrete components ( e.g. , 1es 1741 + 196 and 1es 1212 + 078 ) , whereas others show a diffuse jet with a wide opening angle ( @xmath17 ; e.g. , 1es 0806 + 524 and 1es 1959 + 650 ) .",
    "a map of 1e 1415 + 259 is not shown because its extended structure is too faint to be imaged .",
    "the peak component flux is of the order of the baseline noise ( @xmath87 mjy ) , and baseline phase errors dominate the apparent morphology of the extended structure .",
    "eleven bl lacs in our sample were observed with the vla on 10 october 1998 .",
    "we chose to observe with the b - array at 1.425  ghz with a 50mhz bandwidth to maximize sensitivity to extended , steep - spectrum structure while achieving @xmath84  resolution .",
    "the b - array was chosen based upon the redshifts of the objects in our sample to avoid over - resolution of the extended structure .",
    "three or four 8-minute scans , each bracketed by a 90second scan on a primary vla flux calibrator , were made for each source .",
    "scans were spaced to optimize coverage in the @xmath18 plane .",
    "objects which were sufficiently resolved in previous efforts @xcite were not reobserved here .",
    "epoch 1995.2 vla values were used to flux calibrate the maps using multiple observations of 3c 286 .",
    "since these sources are highly core dominated , a point source model was assumed to start the self - calibration process .",
    "phase - only self - calibration in decreasing solution time intervals was used for the first four iterations . amplitude and phase self - calibration",
    "were then used until the maximum dynamic range was achieved , usually requiring only one or two more iterations .",
    "the aips task imagr was used to generate the maps and clean components .",
    "robust weighting ( robust = 0.5 ) was used to achieve a smaller beam fwhm with only a 1012% increase in noise over natural weighting ; see @xcite for an explanation .",
    "the core flux densities were measured by fitting the core with a single gaussian with the synthesized beam s parameters .",
    "the extended flux was determined by measuring the total flux density with a box enclosing the entire source and then subtracting the core flux density .",
    "for unresolved sources , conservative upper limits on extended radio flux densities were calculated by assuming that each source has uniformly bright extended emission at the 1@xmath19 detection level over a 3000 kpc@xmath20 area surrounding the core .",
    "the vla and vlba maps are shown in figures  [ fig-4 ] through  [ fig-22 ] .",
    "a summary of the radio properties is given in table  [ tbl-2 ] .",
    "the columns are : [ 1 ] the object name ; [ 2 - 3 ] the 1.425  ghz vla core and extended flux densities ( mjy ) ; [ 4 ] the vla jet position angle [ 5 - 6 ] the 4.964 ghz vlba core and extended flux densities ( mjy ) ; and [ 7 ] the vlba jet position angle .",
    "the errors in the flux densities are @xmath80.1 mjy beam@xmath15 for both the vla and vlba maps .",
    "the cumulative errors in the extended flux densities depend upon the solid angular extent of the measured flux .",
    "note that , as discussed in  3 , measured jet position angles are subjective ; and in most objects the jet morphology is more complex than what can be modeled with a single pa value .",
    "thus the discussion of individual sources below should be consulted for each source .",

    "previous studies of the vlbi structure of bl lac objects , nearly all of which were of lbls , have shown that large misalignment angles are common in these objects @xcite .",
    "this is to be expected in sources that are seen close to the line of sight , as projection effects will magnify the apparent distortion from intrinsic bends and complex structure within these jets .    measuring the parsec - scale jet pas in bl lacs is very difficult for several reasons .",
    "many of these objects show jets which bend within several parsecs from the core ; and in many cases the emission where the bending occurs is very faint .",
    "thus the measured pa is very sensitive to the linear resolution and the sensitivity of the observations , which of course depend on the observed wavelength , the distance to the object , the ( @xmath13 ) coverage and the overall quality of the observations .",
    "the parsec - scale jets seen in mkn 501 and 1jy 1147 + 245 are good examples of this problem @xcite . adding another dimension to the problem , there is evidence that the jet trajectory for some of these objects can change on short timescales ; e.g. , 1jy 0735 + 178 @xcite .    like the vlbi maps , the measured jet pas in the vla maps are also dependent on sensitivity and resolution ; e.g. , the measured pas can differ by as much as 60  based upon the resolution of the maps for 1jy 0814 + 425 and 1jy 2131021 @xcite .",
    "additionally , the kpc - scale structure of these sources are usually highly distorted , often with a  halo \" that surrounds the core with no clear pa .",
    "thus , it is not surprising that we see such a range of @xmath5  values , even without considering the enormous difference in physical scales between the vla and vlbi maps and the physical environments through which a jet propagates from the core to kiloparsec scales .    despite the uncertainties inherent in such measurements",
    ", we have measured parsec- and kpc - scale jet position angles for our hbl sample .",

    ", we consider all of the lbls in the complete 1jy sample @xcite for which high dynamic - range vla maps exist ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) and that have been studied in detail with vlbi techniques @xcite . for consistency , we measure jet position angles from these maps using the methodology described below rather than use published values",
    ".    there are only a few cases where the jet pa is unambiguous .",
    "thus the parsec- and kpc - scale jet position angles were measured with the following methodology .",
    "for both the vla and vlbi maps the pa is measured from the core through contiguous jet components that are more than 23@xmath19 detections . in some cases",
    "the pa on vlbi scales is uncertain because the jet is diffuse with a broad opening angle ( e.g. , 1es 0806 + 524 and 1es 1959 + 650 ) . in these cases",
    "the pa is measured either down the center of the jet or along the brightest contours within the jet . also , there are four objects in our hbl sample ( 1es 0033 + 595 , 1es 0414 + 009 , 1es 1741 + 196 and 1es 2344 + 514 ) that have bright , well - collimated parsec - scale jets close to the core and show evidence of bending further from the core",
    ". however , the emission where the bending may be occuring is faint ; and it is not clear whether the jet is actually bending or simply broadening . for this reason the jet pa is measured from the bright jet components near the core . in three of the four objects the kpc - scale structure is well aligned with these measurements ; the exception is 1es 2344 + 514 , for which no measurement of the pa@xmath47 will align it with the vla pa@xmath21 .",
    "thus it is possible that the jets in these objects are bending and may not as well aligned as measured .",
    "the better alignment of the parsec - scale jet near the core with the kpc - scale jets in these sources may be the result of collisions with dense clouds of gas near the core . for a powerful jet ,",
    "such collisions are not effective at deflecting the jet in a coherent manner ; however they may result in temporary distortions of the jets on timescales of @xmath48 yr @xcite .",
    "thus , it is possible that the observed vlbi morphologies could be explained by an off - center collision with a dense gas cloud 1020 parsecs from the core which distorts the observed pa at this distance but does nt affect the long - term propagation of the jet to kpc distances .",
    "it is worth noting that @xcite find significant pa differences between inner and outer vlbi jet components in a sample of lobe - dominated quasars , wherein the outer vlbi jet components are better aligned with the kiloparsec - scale jets .",
    "this suggests that , in quasars at least , jets may distort or bend close to the core before becoming well - collimated further from the core .",
    "the comparison is limited because quasar jets are of much higher power ; and due to the much higher redshift of their quasar sample ( @xmath49 ) , the vlbi maps in @xcite are studying larger physical scales by a factor of @xmath810 . also , lobe - dominated quasar jets are seen at large angles to the line of sight , and therefore do not suffer from projection effects to nearly the degree as bl lac objects",
    ".    in all of the resolved vlbi maps jet structure is apparent ; however the vla maps reveal that many of these sources have a  halo \" morphology , i.e. , extended emission that surrounds the core with no clear jet . for these objects",
    "the pa is measured to the brightest  hotspot \" within the lobe ; and for objects which have two distinct lobes and no clear jet , the pa is measured to the lobe most likely associated with the parsec - scale jet ( i.e. , to the lobe which minimizes the value of @xmath5 ) .",
    "naturally , @xmath5  could only be determined for objects which were resolved by both the vla and with vlbi .",
    "figure  [ fig-2 ] shows the distribution of misalignment angles for the hbls in our sample and the lbls in the 1jy sample .",
    "unfortunately , in only seven of the fifteen hbls in our sample are jets resolved in both vla and vlbi images .",
    "the parsec- and kpc - scale jets are well - aligned ( @xmath5  @xmath50 ) for five of the seven . in three additional sources a vla pa value was determined by the brightest hotspot in a lobe . in only one of these cases",
    "is the parsec - scale jet well aligned with the hotspot .",
    "the remaining six sources are unresolved in one or both maps . to this sample",
    "we added the four hbls in @xcite , although for only one could a @xmath5  value be determined .",
    "while all four are resolved in vlbi maps , a vla map of 1es 1133 + 704 by @xcite shows a halo morphology with no clear pa ; and vla maps of the other sources reliably resolve only 1es 1727 + 503 @xcite . in the 1jy lbl sample",
    "we were able to determine @xmath5  values for only 18 of 37 objects , with an additional three tentative @xmath5values .",
    "the difficulty in determining @xmath5  values in the 1jy sample is due to unresolved sources as well as many objects which show halo structures around the core with no resolved jet or hotspots .",
    "whereas most of the hbls are well aligned ( @xmath5  @xmath51 ) , the lbl sample shows a wide distribution of @xmath5  values , evenly distributed from 0  to 150 .",
    "the distributions of @xmath5  for hbls and lbls are different at the 96% level of confidence using a two - sided kolmogorov - smirnov test .",
    "additionally , all four extreme hbls ( log(@xmath1 )  @xmath52 ) with well - measured misalignment angles are very well aligned . while not conclusive , this suggests that hbls either have intriniscally straighter jets than lbls , or that hbls are seen further off - axis than lbls , such that projection effects are not as important .",
    "clearly larger and statistically - complete samples are desirable .",
    "we note that the distribution of @xmath5  values in the 1jy lbl sample is consistent with the distribution of @xmath5  values seen by @xcite .",
    "we also note that there is no significant evidence for a bimodal distribution of misalignment angles , with two peaks centered on 0  and 90 , as suggested for bl lacs by @xcite .",
    "thus we argue that the 1jy lbl sample is consistent with a population of radio galaxies whose jet axes are seen close to the line of sight ; and that complex bend geometries such as those proposed by @xcite are not necessary to explain the distributions of @xmath5  in either of our samples .",
    "if the orientation hypothesis is correct , that is , if hbls are simply lbls seen further from the jet axis , there should be a correlation between log(@xmath1 )  and @xmath5  because lbls will appear to be more misaligned due to projection effects .",
    "figure  [ fig-3 ] shows the distribution of @xmath5  as a function of log(@xmath1 )  for both samples . there is a weak @xmath53 evidence ( 90% probability ) that @xmath5  and log(@xmath1)are linearly anticorrelated when the samples are combined ; but this anticorrelation is not seen in the lbl sample alone",
    "no correlation is seen between @xmath5  and @xmath54 for either the full lbl and hbl sample or amongst the lbls alone .",
    "we have completed vla and first - epoch vlba observations as part of a program to study the parsec - scale radio structure of a sample of fifteen hbls .",
    "all of the resolved objects are core dominated in the vla and vlba maps ; and they show a core - jet morphology on parsec scales , similar to lbls and core - dominated quasars . some sources show a well - collimated , parsec - scale jet with discrete components , whereas others show a diffuse jet with a wide opening angle",
    ". some objects also show evidence for the interaction of their parsec - scale jets with a dense gas environment .",
    "further modeling is warranted .",
    "while lbls show a wide distribution of parsec- and kpc - scale jet alignment angles , most of the hbls considered here have well - aligned jets , suggesting either that hbl jets are seen further off - axis than lbl jets , or that hbl jets are intrinsically straighter .",
    "complex bend geometries , such as those proposed by @xcite , are not necessary to explain the observed distributions of misalignment angles seen in our lbl or hbl samples .",
    "there is a hint in our data that extreme hbls ( log(@xmath1 )  @xmath52 ) have intrinsically straight jets that are viewed well off - axis in that all four extreme hbls in our sample have very small ( @xmath55% ) misalignment angles .",
    "observations of other extreme hbls are needed to test this preliminary result .    while it is now clear that orientation alone can not be invoked to unify hbls and lbls @xcite , selection effects",
    "may nonetheless cause lbls to be seen closer to the jet axis than hbls .",
    "for example , lbls show optical emission lines which are several orders of magnitude more luminous than hbls .",
    "thus lbls may require larger doppler factors to sufficiently boost the jet continuum relative to the emission lines to remain within the bl lac spectral criterion ( rest @xmath0 ) .",
    "similarly , the bright radio flux limit as well as the flat radio spectrum criterion of the 1jy sample may also bias lbls towards more highly beamed objects , whereas the x - ray surveys used to draw our hbl sample do not have any radio - based selection criteria .",
    "thus , lbls may be systematically more beamed than hbls even though they may not necessarily share the same parent population .",

    "<S> some objects also show evidence for bending of the jet 1020pc from the core , suggesting interaction of the jet with the surrounding medium . whereas lbls show a wide distribution of parsec- to kpc - scale jet misalignment angles , there is weak evidence that the jets in hbls are more well - aligned , suggesting that hbl jets are either intrinsically straighter or are seen further off - axis than lbl jets . </S>"
