    "the red - sequence cluster surveygladders / rcs ] ( e.g. , gladders & yee 2000 ) is the largest area , moderately deep imaging survey ever undertaken on 4 m class telescopes .",
    "the survey comprises 100 square degrees of imaging in 2 filters ( 22 widely separated patches imaged in @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) .",
    "ten patches have been observed using the cfht 12k mosaic camera , and the remaining 12 southern patches have been observed using the mosaic ii camera on the ctio 4 m telescope .",
    "the depth of the survey ( 2 magnitudes past @xmath15 at @xmath16 ) is sufficient to find a large number of galaxy clusters to @xmath17 .",
    "the survey allows a variety of studies , such as constraining cosmological parameters from the measurement of the evolution of the number density of galaxy clusters as a function of mass and redshift , and studies of the evolution of cluster galaxies , blue fraction , etc . at redshifts for which very limited data are available at present .",
    "the data are also useful for a range of lensing studies . strong lensing by clusters of galaxies allows a detailed study of their core mass distribution . in addition , given the shallowness of the survey , the arcs are sufficiently bright to be followed up spectroscopically ( e.g. , gladders , yee , & ellingson 2001 ) .",
    "thanks to the large magnifications of the arcs , it allows unprecedented studies of the properties of high redshift galaxies .",
    "furthermore , in combination with detailed modeling of the cluster mass distribution , the geometry of the images can be used to constrain @xmath18 .    here",
    "we concentrate on some of the weak lensing applications , for which we use 24 deg@xmath0 of @xmath19band survey data ( 16.4 deg@xmath0 of cfht , and 7.6 deg@xmath0 of ctio 4 m data ) .",
    "we present early results of the measurement of the lensing signal by intervening large scale structure ( cosmic shear ) and a study of the dark matter halos of ( field ) galaxies , as well as their biasing properties .",
    "the data analysed so far do not cover complete patches , and therefore we limit the analysis to the individual pointings .    a detailed description of the data and weak lensing analysis will be provided in hoekstra et al .",
    "( 2001b ) .",
    "the results presented in hoekstra et al .",
    "( 2001b ) indicate that the object analysis , and the necessary corrections for observational distortions work well , which allows us to obtain accurate measurements of the weak lensing signal .",
    "the weak distortions of the images of distant galaxies by intervening matter provide an important tool to study the projected mass distribution in the universe and constrain cosmological parameters ( e.g. , van waerbeke et al .",
    "compared to other studies , the rcs data are relatively shallow , resulting in a lower cosmic shear signal . however , the redshift distribution of the source galaxies , which is needed to interpret the results , is known fairly well .",
    "in addition , our data have been acquired using two different telescopes , but have been analysed uniformly .",
    "a detailed discussion of the analysis and the results is presented in hoekstra et al .",
    "( 2001b ) .",
    "comparison of the results from the two telescopes provides a useful test to check whether the various corrections for observational distortions have worked well .",
    "we find good agreement between the two measurements , and the combined top - hat smoothed variance is presented in the left panel of figure  [ cosmic ] ( 16.4 deg@xmath0 from cfht and 7.6 deg@xmath0 from ctio ) .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio of our measurements is very good , reaching @xmath20 at a radius of 2.5 arcminutes .",
    "we use the photometric redshift distribution inferred from the hubble deep field north and south to compare the observed lensing signal to cdm predictions .",
    "this redshift distribution works well , as was demonstrated by hoekstra , franx & kuijken ( 2000 ) for the @xmath21 cluster of galaxies ms  1054 - 03 .",
    "the right panel in figure  [ cosmic ] shows the inferred likelihood contours for a @xmath12cdm cosmology , with @xmath22 . for an @xmath23 flat model we obtain @xmath3 ( 95% confidence ) , in good agreement with the measurements of van waerbeke et al .",
    "weak lensing is also an important tool to study the dark matter halos of field ( spiral ) galaxies ( e.g. , brainerd , blandford , & smail 1996 ; fischer et al .",
    "rotation curves of spiral galaxies have provided important evidence for the existence of dark matter halos , but are confined to the inner regions , as are strong lensing studies .",
    "the weak lensing signal , however , can be measured out to large projected distances , and it provides a powerful probe of the gravitational potential at large radii . unfortunately , the lensing signal induced by an individual galaxy is too low to be detected , and one can only study the ensemble averaged signal around a large number of lenses .    the results presented here are based on 16.4 deg@xmath0 of cfht data .",
    "we use galaxies with @xmath5 as lenses , and galaxies with @xmath24 as sources which are used to measure the lensing signal .",
    "this selection yields a sample of 36226 lenses and @xmath25 sources .",
    "the redshift distribution of the lenses is known spectroscopically from the cnoc2 field galaxy redshift survey ( e.g. , yee et al .",
    "2000 ) , and for the source redshift distribution we again use the photmetric redshift distribution from the hdf north and south .",
    "the adopted redshift distributions give a median redshift @xmath26 for the lens galaxies , and @xmath27 for the source galaxies .",
    "the ensemble averaged tangential distortion around galaxies with @xmath5 is presented in the left panel of figure  [ galgal ] .",
    "the solid line corresponds to the best fit sis model , for which we find an einstein radius @xmath28 arcsec .    a better way to study",
    "the lensing signal is to compare the predicted shear ( both components ) from a parametrized mass model to the data .",
    "we use the truncated halo model from schneider & rix ( 1997 ) .",
    "the results are presented in the right panel of figure  [ galgal ] . with the adopted redshift distribution",
    "we obtain @xmath29 km / s .",
    "it turns out that the quoted value is close to that of an @xmath30 galaxy , and our results are in fair agreement with other estimates .",
    "in addition , for the first time , the average extent of the dark matter halo has been measured . under the assumption that all halos have the same truncation parameter",
    ", we find a 99.7% confidence upper limit of @xmath31 kpc .",
    "more realistic scaling relations for @xmath32 give lower values for the physical scale of @xmath33 , and therefore the result presented here can be interpreted as a robust upper limit .",
    "we note that the results indicate a steepening of the tangential shear profile at large radii ( which we interpret as a truncation of the halo ) , and alternative theories of gravity , such as mond need to reproduce this .",
    "a plausible description of lensing by mond was put forward by mortlock & turner ( 2001 ) , which suggests that the shear in mond drops @xmath34 .",
    "a preliminary analysis excludes this prediction at high confidence .",
    "the study of the correlation between the galaxy distribution and the dark matter distribution ( i.e. galaxy biasing ) can provide useful constraints on models of galaxy formation .",
    "most current constraints come from dynamical measurements that probe relatively large scales ( @xmath35 a few mpc ) .",
    "schneider ( 1998 ) proposed a method that provides the unique opportunity to study galaxy biasing as a function of scale using weak lensing .",
    "this has been studied in more detail by van waerbeke ( 1998 ) who concluded that the results depend only slightly on the assumed power spectrum of density fluctuations .    in the standard , deterministic linear bias theory ,",
    "the galaxy density contrast @xmath36 is related to the mass density contrast @xmath37 as @xmath38 .",
    "however , the biasing relation need not be deterministic , but might be stochastic . in this case",
    "the galaxy - mass cross - correlation coefficient @xmath9 is less than 1 .",
    "hence , we allow for stochastic biasing , and include the parameter @xmath9 .",
    "we use the 16 deg@xmath0 of cfht imaging data , which allows us to measure the mass - galaxy cross - correlation and the galaxy auto - correlation function .",
    "unfortunately the data do not allow a accurate measurement of the ( dark ) matter auto - correlation function .",
    "a measurement of all three correlation functions would enable us to determine both @xmath8 and @xmath9 as a function of scale .",
    "in a forthcoming paper we plan to use the results of van waerbeke et al .",
    "( 2001 ) who measured the mass autocorrelation function from deep imaging data .    here",
    "we present the results based on rcs data only , which results in a measurement of @xmath10 as a function of scale ( for a detailed discussion see hoekstra , yee , & gladders 2001a ) .",
    "the ratio of the galaxy - mass cross correlation and the @xmath39 and the galaxy auto - correlation function @xmath40 is presented in figure  [ bias ] ( left panel ) , and the corresponding estimate of @xmath10 ( for a @xmath12cdm model ) as a function of scale is shown in the right panel .",
    "the results are consistent with a value of @xmath10 that is independent of scale , in agreement with the prediction of linear biasing . for the @xmath12cdm",
    "cosmology we obtain @xmath11 , suggesting that the light distribution traces the dark matter distribution quite well .    in the near future",
    "we will be able to measure the bias parameter on larger scales , and the accuracy of the estimates will improve significantly . with additional data",
    "this method will allow us to measure both @xmath8 and @xmath9 as a function of galaxy type , scale , and redshift .",
