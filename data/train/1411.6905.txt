    "work function is one of the most fundamental electronic properties of a metallic surface .",
    "it is the minimum energy needed to extract an electron from the solid to the infinity . measuring the work function",
    "provides a straightforward method to monitor the state of a surface because any adsorbed species or surface defect will generally induce changes in work function .",
    "this phenomenon has been widely studied in the field of catalysis due to its important consequences concerning reaction mechanisms at surfaces because it can promote reactivity @xcite . in particular ,",
    "interfaces between ultrathin oxide films and metals are expected to play a pivotal role in controlling the charging and adsorption behaviors of metal adatoms on the oxide surface @xcite .",
    "indeed , one of the major consequences of the deposition of ultrathin oxide films on metals is a shift in the metal work function resulting in a reduction of the tunneling barrier and thus an increase of the tunneling probability @xcite .",
    "it is now well established that these induced work function shifts can come from three distinct mechanisms : one due to the charge transfer between the oxide film and the metal substrate ( @xmath2 ) , another due to the intrinsic dipole moment of the rumpled oxide ( @xmath3 ) , and finally that due to the compression of the metal electronic density upon oxide deposition ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "this last contribution , the so - called electrostatic compression effect , appears at any metal / dielectric interface and is the main mechanism governing the strong reduction of the metal work function in the case of wide band gap oxides such as mgo @xcite .",
    "the theoretical understanding of the metal / oxide interface electronic structure has thus naturally opened the way to the manipulation and the control of cluster / metal - oxide systems through interfaces engineering . by varying the kind of interface defects , it is possible to tune the work function of the metal / oxide system in a desired way @xcite . for examples , recent theoretical studies of doped mgo / ag(001 ) interfaces ,",
    "have shown that manipulating the interface by inserting oxygen or magnesium vacancies and impurities leads to an enhanced chemical reactivity of the oxide surface with respect to the catalytic dissociation of h@xmath5o @xcite , and have further highlighted the influence of interfacial oxygen vacancies and impurities on the mgo / ag(001 ) work function @xcite .",
    "more recently , in a layer - resolved study of mg incorporation at the mgo / ag(001 ) buried interface , it has been experimentally demonstrated that mg atoms can be incorporated at the mgo / ag(001 ) interface by simple exposures of the mgo films to a mg flux @xcite .",
    "a gradual reduction of the metal / oxide work function upon mg exposition ( up to 0.70 ev ) have been further observed and attributed to band - offset variations at the interface and band bending effects in the oxide film .    in this paper",
    ", we propose to target the underlying mechanisms responsible for the mgo / ag(001 ) work function variations induced by the incorporation of mg atoms at the metal / oxide interface . by using ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy ( ups ) and auger electron diffraction ( aed ) experiment",
    ", we show that the induced work function changes are related to fermi - level pinning modifications at the interface and we evidence a strong distortion of the ag and mgo interface layers . the nature of interactions at the mg - doped metal / oxide interfaces",
    "is then discussed by using density functional theory ( dft ) calculations through the disentanglement of the charge transfer , rumpling , and electrostatic compression contributions . in good agreement with our experimental observations",
    ", we found that the increase of the interface mg concentration leads to electronic and structural changes essentially in the oxide interface layer .",
    "the strong mgo lattice distortion at the interface upon mg incorporation is well reproduced by dft and is found to be a structural response to the interfacial charge transfer so as to compensate almost exactly the charge transfer contribution to the work function variations , demonstrating that the metal / oxide work function changes are essentially driven by the increase of the electrostatic compression effect .",
    "all experiments were performed in a multi - chamber ultrahigh vacuum ( uhv ) system with base pressures below 2@xmath610@xmath7 mbar . the ( 001)-oriented ag single crystal was cleaned by several cycles of ar@xmath8 ion bombardment and annealing at 670 - 720 k. the 3 monolayers ( ml ) thick mgo films ( one monolayer is defined as one half mgo lattice parameter , i.e. 1 ml = 2.10  ) were grown on the prepared ag(001 ) surface by evaporation of mg in o@xmath5 background atmosphere ( oxygen pressure = 5@xmath610@xmath9 mbar ) at 453 k with a cube - on - cube epitaxy with respect to the ag(001 ) substrate . in order to incorporate mg atoms at the mgo / ag(001 ) interface , the mgo films were exposed to an mg flux ( 2.4@xmath610@xmath10 atoms/(@xmath11s))at a substrate temperature of 513 k. under these conditions most of mg atoms reaching the surface desorb and only a small portion of atoms is adsorbed at the film surface or incorporated .",
    "the measurements were carried out using x - ray and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy ( xps - ups ) . a two axis manipulator allowed polar and azimuthal sample rotations with an accuracy better than 0.2@xmath12 .",
    "auger electron diffraction ( aed ) measurements were performed for the mg @xmath0 auger transition which leads to electrons with kinetic energies around 1177 ev and aed profiles were recorded during polar sample rotations ( the polar angle is defined with respect to the surface normal ) between -5@xmath12 and 60@xmath12 for the ( 010 ) and ( 110 ) inequivalent emission planes of the cubic structure of the mgo(001 ) film .",
    "the kinetic energy of the emitted electrons has been measured by employing a hemispherical analyzer ( omicron ea125 ) with a five - channel detection system .",
    "al @xmath13 was used as the x - ray source and he - i resonance ( @xmath1421.22 ev ) line provided the ups source for photoemission experiments .",
    "the total energy resolutions were respectively 0.80 and 0.15 ev for xps and ups .",
    "the work function of the dielectric system ( @xmath15 ) , defined as the energy of the vacuum level ( @xmath16 ) with respect to the fermi level of the mgo / ag(001 ) system ( @xmath17 ) , is determined from the low - energy cutoff ( @xmath18 ) of the secondary photoelectron emission : @xmath19 . to this end",
    ", the samples were biased at @xmath20 v to make the measurements of the very low - energy region of the spectrum reliable .",
    "the multiple scattering spherical wave cluster calculations have been performed in the rehr - albers framework @xcite , by using the msspec program @xcite for clusters containing up to 409 atoms .",
    "the multiple scattering expansion of the photoelectron wave function was carried up to the fourth order which appeared to be sufficient to achieve convergence for the considered configurations . due to the strongly peaked shape of the scattering factor , the multiple scattering paths implying more than one scattering angle greater than 30@xmath12 were neglected .",
    "considering various experimental works @xcite , we assumed pseudomorphic ultrathin mgo films on ag(001 ) with interface mg atoms occupying the substrate hollow sites and an interfacial distance between ag and o atoms of 2.51  .",
    "the phase shifts have been calculated within the muffin - tin approximation by using a real hedin - lundqvist exchange and correlation potential @xcite , with muffin - tin radii of 1.02    for o and mg atoms and of 1.42    for ag atoms .",
    "the thermal vibrations were introduced by means of the isotropic mean square displacements ( msd ) .",
    "the msd s for the mg@xmath21 and o@xmath1 ions of the different layers have been assumed identical and have been considered close to those of the mgo(001)surface ions @xcite .",
    "the theoretical msd values of the mg@xmath21 and o@xmath1 ions at the mgo(001 ) surface have been then averaged over all directions and both cations and anions . from this procedure",
    "we obtained a value of 0.006 @xmath22   which has been introduced in our multiple scattering calculations .",
    "for the ag bulk atoms , the msd was 0.024 @xmath22 , corresponding to a debye temperature of 225 k. the msd of the interface ag atoms were calculated by scaling the msd bulk value with 1.8 @xcite .",
    "the electron inelastic mean free path was set equal to 19    as calculated from the seah and dench formula @xcite .",
    "finally , a broadening of the aed peaks due to the formation of mosaic observed during the growth of the mgo films on ag(001 ) @xcite , was taken into account by averaging the calculations over directions filling a cone of 2.5@xmath12 half angle .",
    "the dft calculations have been carried out in the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) using the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) exchange - correlation functional.@xcite all calculations were performed within the projector - augmented wave ( paw ) formalism @xcite , implemented in a real - space grid in the gpaw code @xcite , with a grid spacing of 0.18  .",
    "the mgo / ag ( 001 ) system was modeled with one , two or three - layers of mgo deposited on three ag layers with lattice parameter @xmath23 4.16    and ag interface atoms below the oxygen anions . the dft - optimized ag lattice constant ( @xmath234.16  ) being 2% smaller than the mgo one ( @xmath23 4.25  ) , the mgo layers are slightly contracted with respect to their bulk distance when supported on the ag metal . during geometry optimization of the mgo / metal interface ,",
    "all atoms in the mgo film and in the two - interface nearest ag layers were relaxed until the atomic forces are less than 0.02 @xmath24 per atom while the remaining metal layer was frozen at bulk positions . in order to study the impact of the mg incorporation on the physical properties of the mgo / metal system , ag atoms were replaced by mg atoms in the substrate interface layer ( structure labeled mgo / ag - mg in the remainder of the paper ) .",
    "surface unit cells with @xmath25 dimension were used for calculations and brillouin zone integration was performed using 4@xmath64@xmath61 monkhorst - pack meshes @xcite to improve the convergence we used a methfessel - paxton occupation function with @xmath260.2 @xmath27 .",
    "the vacuum region between adjacent slabs was set to @xmath2820    and dipole correction was applied in order to calculate the work functions .",
    "the convergence study of the work function has been done for a clean ag(001 ) surface as a function of the ag slab thickness and has shown that the work function value was converged within @xmath283 % between 3 and 8 ag layers .",

    "figure [ fig1](a ) shows normal - emission mg @xmath0 auger spectra ( vertically shifted for clarity ) of the 3 ml mgo sample before and after an exposition to a mg atomic flux ( 2.4@xmath610@xmath10 atoms/(@xmath11s ) ) during 12 minutes at a substrate temperature of 513 k. the 3 ml reference spectrum is fitted by three auger components @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , with maxima situated at 1179.1 ev , 1177.8 ev , and 1176.8 ev and reveals a layer - resolved shift for the mg @xmath0 auger transition . indeed , as demonstrated in ref . , the @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 components correspond respectively to auger electron emission from the first , second and third mgo plane above the metal - oxide interface for a 3ml thick mgo film . after mg exposure ,",
    "a fourth component ( labeled @xmath32 ) grows at higher kinetic energy in the mg @xmath0 auger spectrum ( 1180.8 ev ) .",
    "this component whose intensity is comparable to the other contributions and the kinetic energy very close to that obtained for a fraction of a mg monolayer deposited on ag(001 ) , is a spectroscopic fingerprint of electron emission from mg atoms located in a metallic environment .",
    "more precisely , the component @xmath32 is related to an electron emission from mg atoms incorporated in the ag substrate during the mg exposure @xcite . as it can be seen in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , its normal - emission intensity gradually increases as a function of the mg exposition time .",
    "this suggests that the incorporation mechanism takes place throughout the mg exposure .",
    "figures [ fig1](b ) and [ fig1](c ) respectively show the experimental aed polar scans in the ( 010 ) emission plane associated with each fitting component of the mg @xmath0 auger spectra for the reference sample and the same sample after the mg exposure .",
    "the curves were obtained from the intensities extracted from the fitting procedure and divided by the same factor which has been chosen such that the @xmath29 aed curve is normalized with its intensity equal to 1 .",
    "as the @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 components of the as - grown mg @xmath0 auger spectrum correspond respectively to auger emissions from the first , second and third mgo layer above the metal - oxide interface , the intensity distribution of the @xmath31 is isotropic whereas the aed profiles associated with the @xmath29 and @xmath30 contributions show pronounced peaks at normal emission and at 45@xmath12 . in the forward focusing approximation @xcite",
    ", these maxima correspond respectively to scattering events along the [ 001 ] and [ 101 ] atomic directions of the rocksalt ( nacl ) structure of the mgo lattice .",
    "we have then exploited the layer - by - layer resolution of the mg @xmath0 auger transition to extract the structural parameters of the mgo film by means of multiple scattering calculations with the msspec program @xcite .",
    "for the calculations we have considered a pseudomorphic mgo film with an in - plane lattice parameter of 4.09    that fully covers the ag(001 ) surface , neglecting the mgo rumpling distortion ( the amplitude of the rumpling is generally no more than few percent of interplanar distance in mgo ) and fixing the distance @xmath33 (= 2.51  ) between ag and o atoms at the mgo / ag(001 ) interface . by comparing the experimental and calculated intensities ( averaged over all polar angles in the ( 010 ) emission plane ) ( see fig.[fig1](b)-(d ) ) , it is found that the real mgo coverage is 2.6 ml with bilayer and trilayer occupancies of @xmath2837% and @xmath2863% , respectively .",
    "a quantitative comparison of the calculated and measured angular positions of the forward focusing peaks along the [ 101 ] direction was carried out to determine the inter - planar distance @xmath34 between two successive @xmath35 and @xmath36 mgo layers ( the index @xmath35=1 refers to the mgo interface layer ) .",

    "[ fig7 ] we show a sketch of the dft - optimized structure for 3ml mgo / ag(001 ) with an interfacial mg concentration of 25% , a value close to the one experimentally obtained .",
    "we find that the essential of the local lattice distortion appears in the mgo interface layer .",
    "although the equilibrium distance @xmath40 at the interface remains almost unchanged after mg incorporation ( 2.72    against 2.67    before incorporation ) , the distance between the incorporated mg atoms and the nearest o@xmath1 ions @xmath37 is highly reduced ( 2.13  ) with respect to @xmath40 .",
    "note that the bond length @xmath37 is close to the one experimentally found and to the mg - o bond length in an mgo crystal .",
    "the very interesting point in this study is that the o@xmath1 ions directly above the mg ( ag ) atoms are displaced downwards ( upwards ) with respect to the other mg@xmath21 ions by 0.29    ( 0.09  ) in the mgo interface layer .",
    "as long as one neglects the effects related to the difference of polarisability of atoms and starting from a non - distorted configuration for the mgo / ag - mg system , this local structural deformation at the interface can be viewed as a direct consequence of coulomb interactions between the positively charged mg atoms ( -1.5 electrons per atom as obtained from a bader analysis ) located in the ag interface plane and the o@xmath1 ions directly adjacent . besides , the ag atoms neighboring the incorporated mg atoms are negatively charged ( 0.9 electrons per atom as obtained from a bader analysis ) so that they exert a repulsive force on the nearest neighbors o@xmath1 ions .",
    "together , the o@xmath1 ions exert an attractive ( repulsive ) force on the mg ( ag ) substrate atoms .    as a result",
    "the mg atoms in the ag - mg interfacial alloy are located slightly above the ag atoms .",
    "for example the dft - optimized geometry calculation gives an atomic corrugation amplitude of 0.18    for a mg concentration of 25% .",
    "it can be noted that the in - plane charge transfer of the mg atoms to the ag atoms is also present even without the oxide over - layer ( -1.2 electrons per atom ) but in this case there is a very low corrugation in the ag - mg surface alloy .",
    "what can be learned here is that the local lattice distortion in the mgo interface layer is mainly a result of a charge transfer between the mg and ag atoms in the interfacial alloy @xcite .",
    "the polarization effect that appears at any dielectric / metal interfaces is related to a reduction in the overspill electron density at the metal surface induced by the strong electrostatic field of the dielectric and is responsible for the strong reduction of the metallic substrate work function.@xcite in the case of the mgo / ag(001 ) system , the so - called electrostatic `` compression '' effect , leads to a reduction of the metal work function of -1.54 ev as calculated with vasp program ( with the gpaw code we obtained -1.55 ev ) .",
    "@xcite in the present section , we determine the importance of the electrostatic `` compression '' effect in the work function reduction of the mgo / ag - mg / ag(001 ) system as a function of the mg concentration at the metal / oxide interface .",
    "( color online ) .",
    "evolutions of the calculated @xmath41 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 contributions to the calculated mgo(3ml)/ag(001 ) work function variation @xmath42 , as a function of the interface mg atom concentration.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    up to now we have calculated the @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath41 contributions to the calculated mgo(3ml)/ag(001 ) work function variation @xmath42 induced by the mg atoms incorporation at the dielectric / metal interface .",
    "knowing these different contributions an estimation of the `` compression '' effect as a function of the mg concentration can be attempted using the following relation :    @xmath43    figure [ fig8 ] shows the evolutions of the calculated @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath41 , and @xmath4 contributions to the calculated mgo(3ml)/ag(001 ) work function variation @xmath42 as a function of the interface mg atom concentration .",
    "the @xmath42 and @xmath4 quantities decrease as a function of the mg concentration and they are very close to each other in particular for the lowest mg concentrations ( @xmath44 50% ) , .i.e .",
    "the other contributions ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath41 ) compensate each other .",
    "we can thus conclude that the decay of the metal / oxide work function is mainly governed by the progressive increase of the `` compression '' effect as a function of the mg concentration that explains the work function reduction experimentally observed after the mg incorporation at the oxide / metal interface . as we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] the incorporation of 25% of mg in the first interface ag layer results in theoretical work function change of -0.55 ev in very good agreement with our experimental findings .    in an _",
    "ab initio _ study of lif / metal systems , it has been shown that the `` compression '' effect increases when the interface distance between the insulator and the metal decreases ( the effect on the work function is typically of -1ev /  ) .",
    "@xcite for mgo(3ml)/ag(001 ) we found that the interface distance only diminishes by 0.1    when the mg concentration of the interface ag - mg alloy varies from 0 to 100% suggesting that the distance reduction effect induced by the mg incorporation can not itself explain the increase of the electrostatic `` compression '' contribution . in order to reach a deeper understanding of the observed effect with the mgo / ag(001 ) system a more detailed analysis of the interface electronic structure is required as this was done for the bao / metal systems by m. nuez and m. b. nardelli.@xcite",
    "in the present paper we have studied the mechanisms responsible for the work function changes induced by the mg atoms incorporation at the mgo / ag(001 ) interface by means of auger electron diffraction experiments combined with multiple scattering calculation , photoemission spectroscopy , and density functional theory calculations . in our experimental conditions we demonstrate that mg atoms are progressively and preferentially incorporated in the substitutional site of the ag interface plane when the mgo films are exposed to a mg flux .",
    "the incorporation of mg atoms leads to a strong work function change ( a reduction of 0.5 ev for an mg concentration of 30% in the ag - mg alloy ) related to band - offset variations at the dielectric mgo / metal interface .",
    "we show that the mg atoms in the interface ag plane induce a strong local lattice distortion in the interface layers that mainly results in a charge transfer between the mg and ag atoms ( electrons are transferred form mg atoms toward ag atoms ) in the interfacial alloy combined with the coulomb interaction between these atoms and their nearest neighbors o@xmath1 ions .",
    "the analysis of our dft - calculation results indicates that this lattice distortion has only a limited impact on the work function reduction for the considered mg concentrations .",
    "in fact the interesting aspect of our dft - based study is that the work function reduction induced by the mg incorporation at the mgo / ag(001 ) interface is mainly governed by the electrostatic `` compression '' effect .",
    "this stems from the fact that the other contributions compensate each other .",
    "we believe that these findings give new insights for controlling the interfacial properties of dielectric / metal systems thereby providing the possibility of modulating the work function and the local structure of ultrathin oxide films surfaces which are known to have a significant impact on the reactivity properties of clusters / oxide systems in catalytic applications.@xcite    the authors warmly acknowledge a. le pottier and y. claveau for technical support .",

    "<S> the properties of mgo / ag(001 ) ultrathin films with substitutional mg atoms in the interface metal layer have been investigated by means of auger electron diffraction experiments , ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy , and density functional theory ( dft ) calculations . exploiting the layer - by - layer resolution of the mg @xmath0 auger spectra and using multiple scattering calculations </S>",
    "<S> we first determine the inter - layer distances as well as the morphological parameters of the mgo / ag(001 ) system with and without mg atoms incorporated at the interface . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the mg atom incorporation drives a strong distortion of the interface layers and that its impact on the metal / oxide electronic structure is an important reduction of the work function ( 0.5 ev ) related to band - offset variations at the interface . </S>",
    "<S> these experimental observations are in very good agreement with our dft calculations which reproduce the induced lattice distortion and which reveal ( through a bader analysis ) that the increase of the interface mg concentration results in an electron transfer from mg to ag atoms of the metallic interface layer . </S>",
    "<S> although the local lattice distortion appears as a consequence of the attractive ( repulsive ) coulomb interaction between o@xmath1 ions of the mgo interface layer and the nearest positively ( negatively ) charged mg ( ag ) neighbors of the metallic interface layer , its effect on the work function reduction is only limited . </S>",
    "<S> finally , an analysis of the induced work function changes in terms of charge transfer , rumpling , and electrostatic compression contributions is attempted and reveals that the metal / oxide work function changes induced by interface mg atoms incorporation are essentially driven by the increase of the electrostatic compression effect . </S>"
