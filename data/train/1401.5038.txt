    "the latter , which also gives the best results , is preferable because it is analytic by construction , while in the former analyticity only holds perturbatively .",
    "we emphasize that despite breit - wigner parametrizations of hadronic data are very simple and manageable , they violate known properties of the underlying strong interaction ( analyticity , unitarity , asymptotic behaviour , ... ) .",

    "<S> these results illustrate the fact that breit - wigner parametrizations of hadronic data , although simple and easy to handle , lack a link with the underlying strong interaction theory and should be avoided . </S>",
