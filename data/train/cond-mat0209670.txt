    "molecular magnetism is one of the most developing fields in the physics of magnetism .",
    "magnetic molecular nanoclusters containing transition metal ions are an important component in this area of investigations @xcite . on the one hand , these materials allow the investigation of macroscopic quantum phenomena @xcite , on the other hand , molecular magnetic clusters are promising components for the design of new magnetic materials .",
    "furthermore , the study of these materials is important due to the possibility of their utilization in magnetocaloric and magnetooptic devices @xcite , or in quantum computers ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .    in the present work the interesting cluster [ mn(hfac)@xmath0nitph]@xmath1 ( see @xcite ) is investigated . for brevity sake",
    "we denote it as mn@xmath1r@xmath1 below .",
    "the single molecular magnet mn@xmath1r@xmath1 being synthesized in 1988 forms dark green hexagonal crystals . according to @xcite the crystals of mn@xmath1r@xmath1 have rhombohedral group of symmetry @xmath2 ( the cell parameters are @xmath3  , @xmath4 ) .",
    "the molecular structure of mn@xmath1r@xmath1 is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the spin structure ( see figure 2 ) of the molecular cluster consists of a ring of six ions @xmath5 ( spin @xmath6=5/2 ) alternating with radicals ( @xmath7=1/2 ) . in the ground state",
    "the total spin of the molecular cluster has a value of @xmath8=12 which results from an antiferromagnetic exchange interaction between @xmath5 ions and radicals .",
    "the spikes detected in the dependence of magnetic susceptibility on the external magnetic field can be interpreted as a stepwise changing of the total spin in the ground state .",
    "the increase of the total spin necessarily gives rise to an increase of the antiferromagnetic exchange energy between @xmath5 ions and @xmath9 radical units .",
    "so this transition occurs only if the zeeman energy of the spins compensate the increase of the exchange energy .",
    "the study of the transitions induced by external magnetic field is a direct method to investigate the exchange interaction .",
    "as long as the interaction between spins of separate molecules in single molecular magnets is small these materials behave like an ensemble of non - interacting microscopic objects .",
    "in the present work the experimental investigations of magnetic susceptibility of single molecular magnet mn@xmath1r@xmath1 are made along with numerical calculations of the energy of the molecular cluster in the ground state .",
    "the obtained experimental data are compared with the results of the theoretical calculations and it allows to prove that an acceptable agreement between the experimental data and the theoretical ones can only be obtained if multi - spin interactions are taken into account .",
    "taking into consideration the three - spin interaction allows us to obtain a rather good agreement of experimental and theoretical data ( discrepancy is less than 10% ) .",
    "to investigate the single molecular magnet mn@xmath1r@xmath1 in magnetic fields up to 400 t the explosive generator mc-1 was used .",
    "the generator works on the basis of the compression principle of the conducting shell containing magnetic field inside . in our experiments a single cascade generator with initial cascade diameter",
    "139 mm was used .",
    "the initial magnetic field in the experiments was 16 t. the detected value of magnetic field in maximum comes up to 503 t. during the process of generation the magnetic field registration was performed by several detectors representing the one loop coils with various diameters .",
    "the use of coils with various diameters allows the more accurate detection of field derivatives .",
    "the mc-1 generator is shown in figure 3 .",
    "the compensation method was used as experimental procedure for measurements of changing magnetization .",
    "the essence of this technique is that of using the coil in which half turns are wound on tube with right - hand thread and other half turns are wound on tube with left - hand thread .",
    "if the coils are placed in changing magnetic field the emf of opposite polarity and same value are induced in the coils giving rise to the total emf @xmath10 0 .",
    "if a sample is placed in one arm of measuring coil the total emf is different from zero .",
    "the signal is proportional to the changing of the magnetization of the sample . in experiments coils with inner diameter 1.6 mm and a number of turns equal to 18",
    "the schmeme of such coil is given in fig.ure 4 .",
    "the sample was placed inside the compensation detector and was immediately sealed hermetically by glue . as long as the experiment was made at the temperature of liquid helium the compensation detector along with the sample was placed in the cryostat .",
    "the flowing cryostat was used allowing to maintain a sample temperature of 4.2 k.",
    "the spin structure of the single molecular magnet is made up by a ring formed by six @xmath5 ions with spins @xmath11 alternating with radicals ( spin @xmath12 ) . according to the experimental data obtained in @xcite of the magnetic susceptibility",
    ", the single molecular magnet @xmath13 has a total spin of @xmath14 in the ground state at @xmath15 .",
    "this can be explained by the existence of antiferromagnetic exchange interaction between @xmath5 ions and @xmath9 radicals .",
    "@xmath16 in equation ( [ 1 ] ) and below it is assumed that even indexes correspond to the @xmath5 ions and odd indexes to the radicals .",
    "the coupling scheme of the spin structure in the absence of an external magnetic field is given in figure 2 .",
    "according to the data present in literature @xcite the coupling constant @xmath17 @xmath18 .",
    "the change of the cluster spin structure in the external magnetic field is caused by the change of its zeeman energy @xmath19",
    "@xmath20  g - factor , @xmath21  bohr magneton .",
    "when a stepwise change of the spin structure of the cluster occurs , the increase of the exchange interaction energy is compensated by the decrease of the zeeman energy . given values of magnetic field",
    "correspond to the spikes found in the behavior of magnetic susceptibility in dependence on magnetic field variation @xmath22 .",
    "the experimental dependence of @xmath22 is shown in figure 5 . from this figure",
    "is possible to appreciate that spikes of susceptibility are grouped in a range of fields from 90 t up to @xmath10 285 t. it is apparent that these spikes correspond to the jumps of magnetization during the transition from ferrimagnetic phases to the ferromagnetic ones . using different words",
    "they can be interpreted as transitions of a `` low spin ",
    "high spin '' type , induced by the external magnetic field level intersection in the ground state .",
    "it seems natural an attempt to describe these transitions on the base of the simplest model  the heisenberg model @xmath23    the performed calculations show that in the framework of the heisenberg model it is impossible to obtain acceptable agreement between theoretical calculations and the experimental data .",
    "this is apparent even from simple estimation of the critical fields of transition from ferrimagnetic state to the ferromagnetic one .",
    "according to the familiar formula ( see e.g. @xcite ) the critical fields for two sublattice ferrimagnet are given by @xmath24    here @xmath25  exchange constant , @xmath26  sublattice magnetizations .",
    "as follows from eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) the ratio between the width of the reorientation range @xmath27 and the value of the field in its center equals @xmath28 for mn@xmath1r@xmath1 ( sublattice magnetizations are @xmath21 and 5@xmath21 ) this value is 0.4 whereas its experimental value is @xmath101 .",
    "although the process of spin reorientation in mn@xmath1r@xmath1 is not a continuous but a quantum ( discrete ) one , the relation presented above can be used for qualitative estimation .",
    "the strong difference between the experimental data and the theoretical approximation based upon the heisenberg model indicates that this model is not sufficient for the interpretation of the experiment .",
    "it is obvious that taking into account anisotropy energy as well does not help to solve the problem ( another reason is that the mn@xmath29 ions are @xmath8ions ) .",
    "the characteristic feature of the experimental dependence @xmath22 is a strong change of the distances between adjacent spikes .",
    "the change of the interval between adjacent spikes can be estimated on the base of spin - wave approximation ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "for the chain of identical spins the ratio between the change of the interval and its value is of the order of @xmath30 @xcite and for chains of 12 spins can reach several percents .",
    "we performed the analogous calculation for a ferrimagnetic chain : it gives rise to more difficult analytical relations but the order of the value does not exceed 10 percent as well .",
    "it is apparent that taking into account direct exchange interaction between @xmath5 ions or between radicals also does not give rise to essential change of the intervals between adjacent spikes .",
    "the results of the analytical approximation were verified by numerical calculations . unlike to the another molecular clusters investigated by the perturbation theory @xcite in the present case",
    "the perturbation theory is not applicable .",
    "the modified lanczos method ( see e.g. @xcite ) was used for the calculation of mn@xmath1r@xmath1 spin structure and energy in the ground state .",
    "the choice of algorithm is explained by the necessity of calculations of the ground state energy and structure in the spin subspace of large dimensions ( up to 5330 ) , for which a large amount of calculations is needed .",
    "modified lanczos method demands for energy calculation of the ground state several times less matrix multiplication than another methods .",
    "again , its reliability ( it does not arise accumulation of errors during process of calculations ) allows to create the compact program code to find the solution of this problem with high efficiency .",
    "the results of the numerical calculations are in complete agreement with the analytical estimations . on the base of the hamiltonian ( [ 3 ] ) , as in the case of taking into account the exchange interactions between nearest @xmath31 ions and @xmath32 radicals does not succeed to obtain acceptable agreement of experimental data and the results of numerical calculations .",
    "the change of the interval between adjacent spikes does not exceed 10 - 15 % at any reasonable choice of exchange constants .",
    "taking into account the anisotropy of the exchange heisenberg interaction also does not allow an explanation for the strong change of the intervals between adjacent spikes .",
    "thus , for the interpretation of the experimental data it is necessary to take into consideration non - heisenberg exchange interactions ( biquadratic , three - spin etc . ) . as far as the spin of the radical is equal to 1/2 then using well known property of pauli matrixes @xmath33,\\ ] ]    it is easy to show that taking into account biquadratic exchange interaction of type @xmath34 and three - spin interaction of type @xmath35 it gives rise only to renormalization of the constants of heisenberg exchange interaction .",
    "this means that among all non - heisenberg two - spin and three - spin interactions only taking into account the three - spin interaction of the type @xmath36 , % \\end{array}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    may be essential .",
    "as shown below taking into consideration the three - spin interaction of the type ( [ 6 ] ) really allows to explain the experimental data .    for the calculation of the positions of the spikes we used the hamiltonian @xmath37",
    "the positions of the spikes are calculated from the condition of equality for the minimal energies of states with various total spins at various values of @xmath38 ratio .",
    "next , the results of the calculations were compared with experimental data . every spike on the dependence of magnetic susceptibility on external magnetic field corresponds to an increase of the total spin of the molecular cluster @xmath13 by 1 .",
    "the change of the total spin from @xmath39 to @xmath40 must then correspond to the 6 spikes present in the curve @xmath22 . as the instrumental resolution is less in the fields higher than 250 t , the three last spikes in this curve",
    "are merged into one broad spike .",
    "it makes the comparison of experimental and theoretical data more difficult .    in the limiting cases",
    "the position of fourth spike in the experimental curve @xmath22 can be associated with the transition @xmath41 or with the transition @xmath42 . in the first case",
    "the best agreement with experimental data is achieved at the following values of exchange constants : @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the discrepancy between experimental and theoretical data is 24 % . in the second case",
    "the exchange constants equal @xmath45 and @xmath46 and the dispersion is less than 10 % ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the obtained value of the heisenberg constant is approximately two times smaller than the estimated value in @xcite .",
    "it can be explained by the strong delocalization of the corresponding spin density of the radicals and , as a consequence , by the strong three - spin interaction .",
    "the strong delocalization of the spin density on part of the skeleton radical molecule was experimentally showed for this radiacal and similar derivative in @xcite .",
    "thus it can be concluded that the position of the fourth spike in the experimental curve @xmath22 is close to the value of the magnetic field corresponding to the transition @xmath47 .",
    "it should be pointed out that in this case the value of the three - spin interaction is rather large .",
    "in this work experimental and theoretical investigations of the magnetic susceptibility of the single molecular magnet [ mn(hfac)@xmath0nitph]@xmath1 are presented .",
    "it is shown that acceptable agreement between experimental data and results of theoretical calculations can be obtained only by taking into account three - spin interaction . in this case",
    "the value of the three - spin interaction is rather large and the ratio of three - spin exchange constant and heisenberg exchange constant may be as much as 0.14 .",
