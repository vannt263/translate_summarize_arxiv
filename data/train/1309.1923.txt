    "<S> the contributions from the @xmath4-wave state @xmath5 are negligibly small for its tiny coupling to @xmath6 . to understand the strong coupling properties of the low - lying negative parity @xmath7 resonances extracted from the @xmath8 scattering , we further study their strong decays . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that these resonances are most likely mixed states between different configurations . </S>",
    "<S> considering these low - lying negative parity @xmath7 resonances as mixed three - quark states , we can reasonably understand both their strong decay properties from particle data group and their strong coupling properties extracted from the @xmath8 scattering . as a byproduct </S>",
    "<S> , we also predict the strong decay properties of the missing @xmath4-wave state @xmath9 with a mass of @xmath10 gev . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest our experimental colleagues search it in the @xmath11 and @xmath12 channels . </S>"
