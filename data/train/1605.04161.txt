    "double diffusive convection ( ddc ) is the convection flow where fluid density depends on two scalar fields .",
    "one of the most relevant application is oceanic mixing , in which the two scalars are temperature and salinity .",
    "temperature diffuses about 100 times faster than salinity , and this huge difference in the molecular diffusivities allows for very rich dynamics in oceanic ddc flow  @xcite .",
    "for instance , an instability can occur even when the fluid is overall stably stratified  @xcite .",
    "a comprehensive review of the field can be found in the recent book by  @xcite .",
    "one of the interesting phenomena in ddc is the salt finger structure , i.e. narrow elongated vertical flows which were observed in many experiments ( e.g. by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for a ddc flow bounded by two reservoirs with fixed values for the two scalars ,",
    "@xcite observed either a single layer of salt fingers , or an alternating stack of salt - finger and convective layers which resembles the thermohaline staircase observed in the ocean  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "three - dimensional ( 3d ) direct numerical simulations ( dns ) in a fully periodic domain produced layered structures which were very similar to the thermohaline staircase  @xcite .",
    "numerical studies also revealed that internal gravity waves can spontaneously develop through collective instability and modulate the salt - finger field  @xcite . in recent ddc experiments by using electrodeposition cells , which are very close to the rayleigh - bnard ( rb ) setup , tilgner and coworkers discovered that salt fingers also occur when the fluid is unstably stratified  @xcite .",
    "this finding is very surprising and unexpected since one would assume that rb convection dominates in an unstably stratified system .",
    "however , linear instability analysis revealed that , in this new regime , salt - finger solutions can indeed be obtained  @xcite . our previous numerical results with the same flow setup well agreed with those experiments  @xcite .",
    "numerous theories and models have been developed in the past to understand the scalar fluxes produced by the salt - finger structures , e.g.  see  @xcite and the references therein .",
    "recently , new models were proposed for the fully periodic ddc flow and tested against numerical results , such as the mean - field theory of  @xcite and the equilibrium model of  @xcite . for the finger layer bounded by two solid boundaries",
    ", we discovered that the grossmann - lohse ( gl ) theory , which was originally developed for rb flow and showed great success  @xcite , can be directly applied to ddc flow and accurately predicts the salinity flux for both our numerical results  @xcite and the experimental results  @xcite .",
    "although we demonstrated the success of the gl theory in accurately predicting the salinity transfer rate , the behaviour of the flow velocity was not fully investigated in the previous work  @xcite , partially due to the limited control parameters simulated therein . here , with the help of more systematic simulations which cover a much wider parameter range",
    ", we will establish a complete description of the scaling laws for three important global responses , i.e.  the salinity and heat transfer rates and the flow velocity .",
    "moreover , we will also investigate the flow structures , such as the salt fingers and the boundary layers",
    ". the characteristic length scales of those structures and their dependences on the flow parameters will be discussed .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "we first briefly describe the numerical methods and the parameter space explored ( section  2 ) . in section  3 we develop the scaling laws for the system responses . in section  4 the flow structures and further scaling relations are presented .",
    "the applicability of the new proposed scaling strategy to other fluid system is discussed in section  5 .",
    "the paper ends with conclusions and an outlook ( section  6 ) .",

    "no - slip boundary conditions are applied to velocity , and both scalars have fixed values . in the horizontal directions we choose a domain size much larger then the size of the salt fingers , which allows us to apply periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the flow is driven by the scalar differences between the two plates .",
    "we define the temperature and salinity differences as @xmath30 the subscripts `` bot '' and `` top '' denote the values at the bottom and top plates , respectively . in this study",

    "@xmath36 corresponds to a rayleigh - bnard flow purely driven by salinity difference . as @xmath2 increases ,",
    "the magnitude of the stabilizing buoyancy force induced by temperature difference becomes stronger when compared to the destabilising force of the salinity difference .",

    "thus a possible strategy for constructing scaling laws for those two quantities would be first extracting the scaling laws of the @xmath2-dependences of @xmath3 and @xmath54 for fixed @xmath1 , and then examining their behaviours for different @xmath1 .",

    "a reasonable argument is that in the current flow setup , the temperature field is stabilizing rather than driving the flow .",

    "furthermore , @xcite suggested that @xmath180 , i.e. a very weak dependence on @xmath2 and for @xmath1 an exponent very close to @xmath122 .",
    "finally , we want to stress that the effective exponents @xmath10 and @xmath76 take different values for different fluid system , i.e. they depend on two prandtl numbers . in table  [ tab : expo ] we summarise the values of @xmath10 and @xmath76 for three different combinations of @xmath181 and @xmath182 , i.e. the current data , the experimental data from @xcite , and one group of data from @xcite with @xmath183 , @xmath62 , and @xmath184 .",

    "a systematic numerical study is carried out for the ddc flow bounded by two parallel plates at the prandtl numbers @xmath186 and @xmath187 , which are similar to the values of seawater .",
    "the salinity rayleigh number @xmath1 covers six decades in order of magnitude , i.e.  from @xmath188 to @xmath141 , and the density ratio @xmath2 is between @xmath52 to @xmath53 .",
    "the salinity nusselt number @xmath0 depends mainly on @xmath1 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath1 is well captured by the gl theory with the same coefficients as determined for rb flow . for fixed @xmath1 , as the density ratio @xmath2 increases , @xmath0 keeps constant , while both the reynolds number @xmath3 and the convective heat flux @xmath64 decrease according to certain power - law scalings , namely @xmath126 and @xmath189 .",
    "the two exponents are calculated from the numerical results , and for @xmath165 the values are @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "then the rescaled reynolds number and convective heat flux are introduced as @xmath72 and @xmath77 .",
    "after rescaling , both @xmath73 and @xmath78 collapse for different @xmath2 and exhibit similar dependences on @xmath1 .",
    "we have interpreted this finding as the ( stabilising ) temperature field being advected by the velocity field like a passive scalar .    for fixed @xmath1 and varying @xmath2 ,",
    "salt fingers have different horizontal size and velocity but transfer salinity with a similar rate .",
    "the flow fields on the horizontal mid plane indicate that salt fingers usually are circular in the horizontal sections . to generate a similar salinity flux at different density ratio ,",
    "the horizontal width of salt fingers must scales as @xmath190 for fixed @xmath1 .",
    "our numerical results confirm this argument , and the rescaled finger width @xmath191 follows a single power - law scaling versus @xmath1 . in the current flow ,",
    "the velocity boundary layer is driven by the vertical motion of salt fingers , and its thickness follows the same scaling laws as the finger width .",
    "the thickness of the salinity boundary layer , however , scales perfectly as @xmath192 , which is a natural result from the global balance between the salinity dissipation and nusselt number , and the fact that the total salinity dissipation is dominated by the contribution from the boundary layers .",
    "the scaling laws proposed for our numerical results are also tested against the experimental data of  @xcite with @xmath166 .",
    "the exponent @xmath10 now has the value @xmath11 .",
    "the rescaling of the reynolds number and the finger width with this new @xmath10 collapses the data points for all experimental cases with @xmath170 .",
    "the dependence of the rescaled reynolds number on @xmath1 is very close to the gl prediction .",
    "the two effective exponents @xmath10 and @xmath76 are also calculated for an additional set of numerical results with @xmath193 , @xmath62 , and @xmath184 .",
    "their values are @xmath194 and @xmath195 , respectively .",
    "all these different values of @xmath10 and @xmath76 for different @xmath196 indicate that the two exponents depend on the properties of the fluid system , and more simulations are needed to fully understand their physical origins .",
    "when @xmath1 is high enough , a stack of horizontal zonal flows emerge in the bulk region and have alternative flow directions .",
    "for the fluid system consider here , these zonal flow appears when @xmath197 . for these large @xmath1  corresponding to big separation between two plates  the salt fingers can not extend from one plate to the opposite one , but instead have a vertical length which is smaller than the domain height .",
    "the inclined gravity waves , which were reported for the fully periodic simulations , were not observed in our bounded flows .",
    "this is probably due to the vertical constrain of the plates .",
    "the current results propose various problems for future studies .",
    "the present scaling strategy should be further validated with other combinations of prandtl numbers .",
    "since the prandtl numbers in our simulations are similar to those of seawater , it is of great interests to test the applicability of the current scaling relations to oceanic salt - finger layers .",
    "the same methodology may also be used to develop scaling relations for ddc in the diffusive regime , where the flow is driven by an unstable temperature difference and stabilized by a salinity difference .",
    "finally , in our simulations even at @xmath143 , we did not observe the staircase state with alternating finger and convection layers .",
    "determining the control parameters at which the staircase state will be realised in the current flow configuration would be very interesting and highly desired but requires more simulations .",
