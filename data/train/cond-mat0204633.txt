    "models with a competition between a short - range ordering interaction and a long - range frustrating interaction have been recently introduced to explain the slowing down of relaxation in supercooled liquids and the resulting glass transition@xcite .",
    "the underlying picture is as follows : any given liquid possesses a locally preferred structure which is different than that of the actual crystalline phase , and this local arrangement of the molecules in the liquid can not propagate at long distances to tile the whole space and form an `` ideal crystal '' because of ubiquitous frustration .",
    "it has been argued@xcite that , for weak enough frustration , this phenomenon can be described via effective interactions acting on very different length scales : a short - range term describing the tendency to extend the locally preferred structure and a long - range , coulomb - like term describing the frustration - induced free - energy cost associated with this spatial extension .",
    "such coulomb frustrated systems have been shown , both by scaling arguments@xcite and by monte carlo simulation@xcite , to display the generic features observed in fragile glassforming liquids , most notably the super - arrhenius temperature dependence of the relaxation time and the two - step , non - exponential decay of the correlation function .",
    "these coulomb frustrated models have also been used in quite different contexts to describe the formation of modulated spatial patterns on mesoscopic length scales , such as lamellar and cubic phases in diblock copolymer melts@xcite , microemulsions in water - oil - surfactant mixtures@xcite , or stripe phases in high temperature superconductors@xcite . in all these cases , slow relaxation",
    "is usually observed , and it has been recently argued@xcite that high - temperature superconductors could indeed form a `` stripe glass '' in which glassiness is self generated , i.e. , does not result from the presence of quenched disorder .",
    "this latter result has been obtained through an investigation of the properties of the free - energy landscape of the coulomb frustrated @xmath0 scalar field theory : by using a thermodynamic approach combining the replica method proposed for the study of structural glasses@xcite and a particular approximation , the self - consistent screening approximation ( scsa)@xcite , for calculating the pair correlation functions , schmalian and wolynes@xcite have derived that the free - energy landscape of the coulomb frustrated model becomes non - trivial below some temperature @xmath1 at which an exponentially large number of metastable states appears ; the associated configurational entropy decreases with further decrease of the temperature and vanishes at a lower temperature @xmath2@xcite .    motivated by these results giving evidence for fragile glassforming behavior in coulomb frustrated models ,",
    "we have studied the langevin dynamics of the coulomb frustrated @xmath0 scalar field theory within the mode - coupling and related approximations .",
    "mode - coupling approaches have been widely used to study glassforming liquids@xcite , and the dynamical ergodicity - breaking singularity predicted to occur in the weakly supercooled liquid regions , albeit `` avoided '' in real systems , is taken by many as a canonical feature of fragile glassforming systems .",
    "it is therefore tempting to investigate whether coulomb frustrated models also display this feature .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first present the model and summarize the equilibrium phase behavior and the results previously obtained by schmalian and wolynes .",

    ", we derive the evolution equations followed by the equilibrium time - dependent correlation function obtained within two resummation schemes of perturbative expansions : the mode - coupling approximation and the dynamical scsa .",
    "section iv is devoted to the search for an ergodicity - breaking transition .",
    "we find that such a phenomenon is indeed observed with the two approximations considered .",
    "we also show that the dynamical singularity predicted by the dynamical scsa coincides with the temperature @xmath1 at which the replica analysis of refs@xcite predicts the occurrence of an exponentially large number of metastable states . in section",
    "v , we present the full numerical solution of the mode - coupling equations , thereby obtaining the time - evolution of the equilibrium correlation function ; this latter is similar to that obtained in the idealized mode - coupling theory of supercooled liquids@xcite and in mean - field generalized spin - glass models@xcite . in the last two section ,",
    "we address the question of sensitivity of the results to the level and the details of the approximation scheme and we give some concluding remarks .",
