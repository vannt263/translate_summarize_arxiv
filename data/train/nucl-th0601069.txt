    "it is well recognized that the precise knowledge of neutrino - nucleus reactions is crucial in analyzing neutrino oscillation experiments  @xcite . for neutrino reactions around 1 gev ,",
    "quasi - elastic scattering and pion production processes are the main reaction mechanisms .",
    "the pion production takes place through both non - resonant and resonance processes , and in the latter the @xmath1 resonance plays a central role for neutrinos in the 1 gev region . since experimental data on the neutrino - nucleon reactions in the resonance region are not as extensive as electron scattering data , a theoretical study of the weak pion production amplitude will be valuable for the study of neutrino - nucleus reactions  @xcite .    in the recent years , extensive studies on the electron- and photon - induced meson production reactions in the gev region are in progress to investigate the nucleon resonance properties  @xcite .",
    "the objective of the @xmath2 study is to understand the non - perturbative dynamics of qcd by testing the resonance properties against the prediction of qcd - inspired models and/or lattice simulations .",
    "two of the present authors with their collaborators have developed a dynamical model for describing photo- and electro - production of pions off the nucleon around the @xmath0 resonance region  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that including the pion cloud effect in theoretical analyses can resolve a long - standing puzzle that the @xmath3 magnetic dipole transition form factor @xmath4 predicted by the quark model is about 40% lower than the empirical value .",
    "furthermore , the predicted e2 @xmath5 and c2 @xmath6 form factors show pronounced @xmath7 dependence due to the pion cloud effects , which suggests the deformation effects in the @xmath3 transition .",
    "this model is further extended to investigate neutrino reactions , which involve the axial - vector responses of hadrons  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3 axial vector form factor @xmath8 is found to contain large meson cloud effects .",
    "the dynamical model starts from the non - resonant meson - baryon interaction and the resonance interaction , and the unitary amplitudes are obtained from the scattering equation .",
    "fairly consistent descriptions of all the available data in the @xmath0 resonance region have been obtained from the dynamical model .",
    "the well tested dynamical model for the single - nucleon case will be a good starting point for investigating the reaction dynamics of neutrino - nucleus reactions .    in this paper",
    "we give a short review of our dynamical model for meson production reactions in the delta resonance region .",
    "subsequently we show the results of our first application of this model to neutrino - nucleus reactions in the delta production region .",
    "we briefly describe our dynamical model of pion photoproduction . we start from the interaction hamiltonian ( @xmath9 ) for the @xmath10 and @xmath11 fields . by assuming that only ` few - body ' states are active in the energy region we are interested in",
    ", we can simplify the intrinsic many - body problem .",
    "the effects due to many - body states are absorbed in effective interaction operators . in our work ,",
    "the effective ` few - body ' hamiltonian @xmath12 is derived from @xmath9 using the unitary transformation method  @xcite .",
    "the resulting effective hamiltonian @xmath12 is defined in a subspace spanned by @xmath13 , @xmath0 , @xmath14 states and has the following form : @xmath15 here @xmath16 and @xmath17 are non - resonant interactions , which consist of the u- and s - channel nucleon exchange and t - channel pion and vector meson exchange processes shown in fig .",
    "the excitation of @xmath0 is described by @xmath18 and @xmath19 shown in fig .",
    "an important feature of our approach is that the effective hamiltonian is energy independent .",
    "hence the unitarity of the resulting amplitude is automatically satisfied .",
    "furthermore , the non - resonant interactions @xmath16 and @xmath17 are derived from the same unitary transformation and hence @xmath13 and @xmath14 reactions can be described consistently .     and @xmath20 interactions.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ] [ fig - h ]    from the effective hamiltonian , it is straightforward to derive a set of coupled equations for @xmath13 and @xmath14 reactions .",
    "the resulting pion photoproduction amplitude is given as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the invariant mass of the @xmath13 system .",
    "the first term is the non - resonant amplitude @xmath23 calculated from the non - resonant interactions @xmath16 and @xmath17 . the second term in eq .",
    "( [ heff ] ) is the resonant amplitude .",
    "the self - energy @xmath24 is defined as @xmath25 the ` dressed ' @xmath26 vertex is defined by @xmath27",
    "an important consequence of the dynamical model is that the influence of the non - resonant mechanisms on the resonance properties can be identified and calculated explicitly .",
    "the ` bare ' resonance vertex @xmath28 is modified by the non - resonant meson cloud @xmath29 to give the dressed vertex @xmath30 .",
    "the dynamical approach described in the previous section was used to study @xmath31-@xmath32 scattering , pion photoproduction and pion electroproduction reactions  @xcite .",
    "the model was subsequently extended to investigate neutrino induced reactions  @xcite . since the weak currents in the standard model",
    "are closely related to the electromagnetic current , it is straightforward to extend the dynamical model of pion electroproduction to weak pion production reactions .",
    "the electromagnetic current ( @xmath33 ) , the weak charged current ( @xmath34 ) and the weak neutral current ( @xmath35 ) can be expressed in terms of the vector current @xmath36 and the axial - vector current @xmath37 as @xmath38 using cvc , @xmath39 can be obtained from @xmath40 by isospin rotation . guided by the effective chiral lagrangian method and using the unitary transformation method , we can construct @xmath37 for pion production .",
    "the resulting @xmath37 consists of the nucleon - born term , rho - exchange and delta excitation terms .",
    "the ` bare ' @xmath3 magnetic and electric form factors @xmath41 and @xmath42 are obtained from the analysis of the @xmath43 reaction .",
    "we assume the siegert theorem to determine the coulomb quadrupole form factor @xmath44 from the transverse electric form factor @xmath42 .",
    "the @xmath7 dependence of the form factors are assumed to be @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the dipole form factor of the proton with @xmath47 .",
    "the correction factor @xmath48 is defined as @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 have been deduced by fitting the @xmath52 data at @xmath53 and @xmath54  @xcite . for the @xmath3 axial vector form factor @xmath55 , we also assume the form given in eq .",

    "we further assume the su(6 ) quark model relation between @xmath8 for the @xmath3 transition and @xmath58 of the nucleon .",
    "having determined the axial @xmath3 form factor , we have no further adjustable parameter in our model to describe neutrino - induced pion production reactions .    in fig .  2 ,",
    "the energy dependences of the @xmath59 and @xmath60 cross sections are shown at @xmath61 and @xmath62 gev .",
    "the solid lines show the full results and the dashed lines show the contribution of the resonance amplitude which is the second term of eq .",
    "2 . clearly the non - resonant amplitude plays a crucial role .",
    "it is well known that the kroll - ruderman term dominates low - energy charged - pion production reactions .",
    "we note that even in the @xmath60 reaction , where only the isospin 3/2 amplitude contributes , the non - resonant contribution to the cross section amounts to 15% at @xmath63 gev .",
    "thus the appropriate treatment of the non - resonant mechanisms plays an important role in interpreting the @xmath3 transition form factors @xmath64 and also in determining the neutrino - nucleon reaction amplitudes that are needed for calculating the neutrino - nucleus reaction amplitudes .     of @xmath59 ( left ) and @xmath60 ( right ) reactions .",

    "for instance , the longitudinal - transverse interference term @xmath65 for a polarized electron is given by interference between the real and imaginary parts of the amplitude and hence it is sensitive to the non - resonant mechanism . as an example , we compare in fig . 3 our predictions for the @xmath66 reaction with the jlab data  @xcite .",
    "the cross section for virtual - photon pion production can be expressed as @xmath67 + \\sqrt{2\\epsilon(1+\\epsilon)}\\frac{d\\sigma_{lt}}{d\\omega_\\pi } \\cos \\phi_\\pi \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\epsilon \\frac{d\\sigma_{tt}}{d\\omega_\\pi } \\cos 2\\phi_\\pi.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the transverse cross section @xmath68 is mainly determined by the contribution of the magnetic dipole form factor @xmath4 .",
    "interference between the transverse and longitudinal currents ( @xmath69 ) is sensitive to the product @xmath70 .",
    "our model gives a reasonable description of the angular distribution from threshold to the delta resonance region .",
    "reasonable agreement has also been seen in the comparison of our dynamical model predictions with the extensive pion production data in the delta resonance region obtained at legs , mainz , jlab and mit - bates .",

    "we take into account the variation of the neutrino flux in the experiment and the finite mass of the muon .",
    "the results of our full calculation ( solid line ) agree reasonably well with the data both in magnitude and @xmath7 dependence .",
    "the contribution of the axial vector current ( dashed curve ) and the vector current ( dot - dashed curve ) have rather different @xmath7 dependences in the low @xmath7 region and interfere constructively with each other . since the vector current contributions are highly constrained by the @xmath52 data , the results in fig .",
