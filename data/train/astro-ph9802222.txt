    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) were first detected in 1967 with small gamma - ray detectors onboard the vela satellites ( klebesadel  1973 ) which were designed to verify the nuclear test ban treaty between the usa and the ussr .",
    "for many years the prevailing opinion was that magnetic neutron stars ( ns ) in the galactic disk were the sources of grbs .",
    "no flaring emission outside the gamma - ray region could be detected , and no undisputable quiescent counterpart to a grb could be established . despite a distance `` uncertainty '' of 10 orders of magnitude , numerous theories ( see a compilation in nemiroff 1994 ) were advanced to explain the source of energy in grbs .",
    "the measurements since 1991 of the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) onboard the compton gamma - ray observatory have shown unequivocally that grbs * are * isotropic even at the faintest intensities , and that there * is * a distinct lack of faint bursts as compared to a homogeneous distribution",
    ". an unprecedented wealth of additional information on each burst could be collected , yet the grb origin remained a mystery .    over the previous two decades ,",
    "grb coordinates came with two mutually exclusive properties : _ arcmin accuracy _ as provided by the interplanetary network ( hurley 1995 ) or _ fast _ as provided by the batse coordinate distribution network ( bacodine ) system ( barthelmy  1996 ) . only since the launch and successful operation of the italian / dutch bepposax satellite",
    "is it possible to obtain accurate grb positions in reasonably short time ( few hours ) which allow quick follow - up observations ( heise  1998 ) .",
    "the discovery of x - ray afterglow emission with the bepposax satellite and related optical and radio transients has given a dramatic boost to both observations and theoretical investigations of grbs over the last few months .",
    "at the present time ( late 1997 ) , our knowledge is evolving extremely rapidly .",
    "thus , it may not be surprising that the content of this review has been expanded considerably as compared to the oral version given in may 1997 . as in the talk",
    ", i will not cover soft gamma repeaters , reviews of which can be found in kulkarni ( 1998 ) and smith ( 1998 ) .",
    "about once per day , the most sensitive gamma - ray instruments detect a short burst of high - energy radiation from an unpredictable location in the sky .",
    "most of its power is radiated in the 100500 kev range , but photons up to 18 gev or down to a few kev have also been registered .",
    "the bursts have durations of typically 0.110 sec , and the rise to maximum intensity can occur within fractions of a millisecond . during these short times grbs",
    "are the brightest objects on the x - ray/@xmath0-ray sky .",
    "the majority of grbs has a rather complex temporal structure ( fig . [ lc ] ) : in particular their variability time scale is significantly shorter than the duration ( meegan  1996 ) .",
    "the typical ratio between duration and the length of intensity peaks within a grb is about 100 .",
    "note that the grb durations scatter over six orders of magnitude ( 1 msec to 1 ksec ) , and given additional spectral variations from burst to burst and even within bursts , one is faced with a confusing diversity of the `` simply measurable quantities '' .",
    "the most direct hint for the spatial distribution of grb sources comes from the distribution on the sky combined with the observed intensity distribution .",
    "the latter is a folding of the unknown radial with the unknown luminosity distribution . in an euclidean space",
    ", a homogeneous source distribution will display an intensity distribution of n(@xmath1s)@xmath2s@xmath3 .",
    "this is seen for bright bursts , but one observes an increasing deficit of bursts at faint intensities . combined with the complete isotropy on the sky ( fig .",
    "[ grb_map ] ) this implies a grb distribution which is centered at the earth and has a decreasing source density with increasing distance .",
    "four different distance scales are possible in principle :    1 .",
    "oort s comet cloud is the nearest population which obeys these characteristics .",
    "collisions among comets ( white 1993 ) or between comets and primordial black holes ( bickert & greiner 1993 ) have been proposed as possible scenarios . however , the oort cloud radius is a sizeable fraction of the distance to nearby stars , and the expected significant clustering of grbs around the nearest stars is not observed .",
    "2 .   a distribution of sources along the galactic plane would appear to be isotropic if the sampling distance is smaller than the scale height of the disk distribution .",
    "such distribution was very popular in the pre - batse era , and magnetic ns were the favourite sources of grbs with typical luminosities of 10@xmath4 erg / s . both , the observed quadrupole moment of the grb distribution as well as the fact that we see the `` faint end '' clearly invalidate such a distribution ( briggs  1996 ) .",
    "an extended halo around the galaxy has been a viable alternative for galactic grb distributions .",
    "isotropy requires a distance @xmath5100 kpc while the lack of grb clustering around m31 constrains the outer radius of the halo to less than @xmath6300 kpc .",
    "however , the original scenario of high - velocity nss ( shklovski & mitrofanov 1985 ) escaping from the galactic disk needs additional ad hoc assumptions to be in line with observations ( hartmann  1990 , greiner 1991 , podsiadlowski  1995 ) .",
    "if grbs are at cosmological distances , their isotropy on the sky is a natural consequence .",
    "originally proposed very soon after the discovery of grbs ( usov & chibisov 1975 ) , this option became popular only after the suggested collision of compact objects as a viable mechanism ( paczynski 1991 ) . with typical distances of z@xmath61",
    "the corresponding luminosities are of the order of 10@xmath7 erg / s .",
    "the basic scenario for the understanding of the properties of low - energy afterglows of grbs is the dissipative ( shock ) * fireball model * ( meszaros & rees 1993 , 1997 ) .",
    "it assumes a very large energy deposition inside a very small volume ( constrained by causality and the variability timescales of grbs to be of order 100 km or smaller ) which leads to characteristic photon energy densities which produce an optically thick , highly super - eddington @xmath0e@xmath8 fireball .",
    "the fireball initially is thermal and converts most of its radiation energy into kinetic energy , i.e. bulk motion of a relativistically expanding blast wave ( lorentz factor @xmath9 10@xmath10 required to avoid degradation of the gev photons by photon - photon interactions ) .",
    "the kinetic energy is tapped by shocks as the most likely dissipation mechanism , and these shocks should probably occur after the fireball became optically thin , as suggested by the observed non - thermal grb spectra .",
    "two types of fireball models can be distinguished which involve different explanations for the duration and variability of the grb . in one type ( called external shocks ;",
    "meszaros & rees 1993 ) the shocks are caused by the interaction ( collision ) of the fireball ejecta with the surrounding medium .",
    "the typical duration of a grb is then given by the doppler delayed arrival times of the emission from the two boundaries of the ejecta shell , or from the delay between different surface elements within the light cone .",
    "detailed investigations have shown ( fenimore  1996 , sari & piran 1997 ) that it is difficult to produce the variety of temporal structures observed in grbs .",
    "the other type of model ( called internal shocks ; rees & meszaros 1994 , paczynski & xu 1994 ) relates the shocks to inhomogeneities within the relativistic outflow , e.g. catching up of faster portions with slower portions of the flow .",
    "the duration of these shocks is likely to be given by the intrinsic duration of the energy release , while any intrinsic variability ( of arbitrary scale ) caused by the central engine will be responsible for the grb time history .",
    "if grbs occur e.g. inside galaxies where the external medium has an appreciable density , one would expect internal shock bursts to be followed by external shock bursts / emission , which has twofold relevance : ( 1 ) external shocks could be related to the observed delayed gev emission ( meszaros & rees 1994 ) , and ( 2 ) the external shocks could radiate at lower energies and longer timescales as compared to internal shocks , and thus are thought to produce the afterglow emission .",
    "the afterglow emission at longer wavelengths thus is most probably due to synchrotron or inverse compton cooling from a decelerating relativistic shell . as the lorentz factor of the shell decreases",
    ", the typical synchrotron frequency also decreases , causing a delay of emission towards longer wavelengths .",
    "several variants of this basic scenario have been proposed including adiabatic versus radiative hydrodynamics , fast versus slow cooling of the electrons , and synchrotron versus synchrotron self - compton emission .",
    "not all combinations are possible , and so far there is no single model that fits all results of afterglow observations .",
    "some versions of the external shock models predict a relation between the energy spectral slope @xmath11 ( power law photon index ) of the afterglow emission and the slope of the intensity decay @xmath12 ( i @xmath2 t@xmath13 ; @xmath12 = 3/2 ( @xmath11 + 1 ) ) .",
    "the generic nature of the fireball model is based on the fact that the detailed nature of the primary energy mechanism is largely undetermined , i.e. it can be reconciled with most of the proposed scenarios , such as a binary compact object merger ( paczynski 1986 ) , a failed supernova ( woosley 1992 ) , a young highly magnetic pulsar ( usov 1992 ) , or a hypernova ( paczynski 1998 ) .",
    "with the launch of bepposax , the combination of two new features allowed the exciting new discovery of x - ray afterglows , and optical / radio transients : first , the combination of a grb monitor ( frontera  1997c ) with two wide field cameras ( wfc ; jager  1997 ) with a 40  field of view each which can localize about 10/yr at the few arcmin level ( int zand  1997 ) ; second , the ability to point within hours after the discovery to the grb location has enabled the detection of fading x - ray emission of a grb for the first time ( piro  1998a ) .",
    "the discovery of long - lasting x - ray afterglows has led to the establishment of a procedure to scan the smallest batse grb error circles with the one degree field of view ( fov ; collimated ) pca detector on rxte .",
    "two afterglows have been seen so far .",
    "the all - sky monitor ( asm ) on rxte observes the sky with its three cameras ( fov of 6@xmath1490 ) in 90 s stationary exposures followed by an instrument rotation of 6 .",
    "the sky coverage implies an x - ray afterglow detection rate of 8 - 10 grbs per year , and several grbs have been localized in 1997 ( smith  1998 ) .",
    "the ulysses spacecraft has been operational for more than 7 years now , but has been the only interplanetary mission with a grb detector since the failure of the mars missions .",
    "thus , grb locations as provided by batse could be reduced only in one dimension to a few arcmin width ( hurley 1995 ) . over the last months , the @xmath0-ray spectrometer on the near earth asteroid rendezvous ( near ) spacecraft has been reconfigured to allow measurements of grbs ( the spectrometer was not originally planned to begin working until near reached eros in feb .",
    "1999 ) . the first detection of a grb occurred on sep .",
    "15 , 1997 and several more grbs have been detected since then several of which have been seen also by the batse , ulysses or wind spacecrafts .",
    "thus , the new capability of near adds a new dimension to the ipn and enables to obtain locations of moderate and strong grbs with arcmin accuracy .",
    "the future seems bright for detection of x - ray afterglows of grbs : after the launch of the original hete mission it is presently being rebuilt with soft x - ray cameras replacing the uv cameras .",
    "the all - sky monitor moxe onboard the russian srg mission will monitor the sky nearly continuously with a spatial resolution down to 1 arcmin . and the german abrixas satellite will scan the sky with its seven identical 40 arcmin fov telescopes on great circles , similar to rosat ( trmper 1983 ) .",
    "all these instruments are scheduled for launch in 1999 , so a substantial improvement in the rate of grb x - ray afterglow detections can be expected in the near future .",
    "the ability to rapidly point the narrow - field instruments ( nfi ) towards grb positions has enabled the discovery of long - lasting x - ray emission which decayed according to a @xmath6t@xmath15 power law . while neither the power law nor the slope are unique , the occurrence within a 3  grb error box right after the burst and the correlation with similarly decaying optical transients is convincing evidence for its relationship to the grb .    with only one exception so far , bepposax nfi pointings have been performed for all grbs localized with the wfc ( see tabs .",
    "[ locgrb ] , [ nfi ] ) . with the exception of grb",
    "970111 x - ray afterglow emission has been clearly detected in all pointings which occurred within less than 2 days of the grb ; there is recent evidence for a possible x - ray afterglow also of grb 970111 : an x - ray source is detected in the first half of the observation ( feroci  1998 ) .",
    "unfortunately , not in all cases were detections made in both detectors ( lecs : 0.110 kev ; mecs : 210 kev ) , and in most cases the detected lecs rates are too small to allow any detailed spectral investigations",
    ". however , three important results could be established ( e.g. frontera  1998b ) : ( i ) the afterglow x - ray spectrum seemingly is well fitted by an absorbed power law model , but not with thermal models ( bremsstrahlung or blackbody ) , ( ii ) there are no obvious changes in the shape of the x - ray spectrum along the intensity decay , and ( iii ) within the accuracy of measurements indeed the intensity decay slope @xmath12 is related to the spectral slope of the energy spectrum of the grb tail and afterglow .

    "x - ray sources have been found inside the error boxes of some of these grb . while originally the discovery of a quiescent x - ray source inside a small grb error box was considered as probable evidence for an association of a grb with a quiescent counterpart , the continuing discovery of further x - ray sources and in particular the detection of more than one x - ray source even in small grb error boxes makes this association doubtful .",

    "this is exactly what is observed : after about 2 months the radio `` twinkling '' of grb 970508 slowly decreased .",
    "thus , once a cosmological distance is adopted for grb 970508 ( based on the absorption line systems in the optical spectrum ) , the radio measurements imply an apparent sizeof@xmath610@xmath33 cm about 1 months after the grb and an expansion velocity near the speed of light .",
    "relativistic fireball models predict that basic parameters of grb afterglows are scaled to each other : total energy , initial lorentz factor , surrounding gas density and distance .",
    "however , based on the measured fluxes from radio to @xmath0-rays , all afterglows observed so far have exhibited completely unscaled behaviour in two ways .",
    "( a ) x - ray afterglows in a rather tight range of intensity are detected from grbs with a wide range of @xmath0-ray parameters ( e.g. peak flux , duration , temporal structure ) , and ( b ) optical and radio intensities are seemingly neither connected to peak @xmath0-ray flux nor x - ray afterglow flux . in particular , the lack of optical transients in some grbs with strong x - ray afterglow emission is hard to understand in terms of intrinsic properties related to the fireball model , since the optical emission in any case should be less beamed than the x - rays , and thus be more frequent .",
    "however , the external medium could play a significant role , i.e. possible absorption by interstellar gas or dust in the host ( jenkins 1997 , paczynski 1998 ) .",
    "if absorption occurs in the host at cosmological distances , the measured low - energy cut - off in the x - ray spectrum will be lower than the intrinsic absorption by a factor of ( 1+z ) .",
    "similarly , the observed optical emission has a wavelength shorter by a factor ( 1+z ) thus suffering stronger extinction at a given absorbing column . as an example , at z=1 a column of 10@xmath34",
    "@xmath35 would correspond to an effective x - ray absorbing column of 1.5@xmath1410@xmath36 @xmath35 and thus only marginally be distinguishable in the x - ray spectrum from galactic foreground absorption , but the observed i band emission actually is absorbed by the corresponding @xmath37=7 in the host .",
    "therefore , even small changes in the column within the grb host can drastically reduce the optical flux while leaving the low - energy cut - off of the x - ray emission nearly unaffected .",
    "while the above effect is important for the ir to x - ray range , the primary @xmath0-rays as well as the radio emission are not affected .",
    "thus , if more radio transients are discovered in the next months this should allow us to test directly the prediction of scaling among different grbs by comparing their @xmath38 , avoiding the uncertainties imposed by the possible intrinsic host absorption .",
    "if the explanation on the lack of optical transients relative to x - ray afterglows turns out to be correct , then grbs would be linked to dense star forming regions , and thus possibly to a population of massive stars .",
    "since the age of a massive star is not more than a few million years , it explodes within its star forming region . in the proposed hypernova scenario ( paczynski 1998 )",
    ", a massive and rapidly spinning star may release @xmath3910@xmath40 erg of kinetic energy extracted from the rotational energy of the black hole ( blandford & znajek 1977 ) .",
    "only a small fraction of this kinetic energy is in the debris ejected with the largest lorentz factors ( which are required to generate the @xmath0-rays ) , while most of the ejecta is sub - relativistic ( speed of c/3 for a 10  object ) .",
    "thus , when the fireball is slowed down by the ambient medium , the slower moving ejecta gradually catch up and provide a long lasting energy supply to the afterglow ( longer than in the standard fireball model , but see rees & meszaros 1998 ) .",
    "if the grb rate follows the massive star formation rate ( with redshift ) then an immediate consequence is an increase of the distance scale to grbs ( sahu  1997 , wijers  1998 ) .",
    "the increase in the comoving grb rate with z compensates various redshift effects which are responsible for the roll - over in the counts .",
    "the higher energy per burst comes along with a reduced grb rate .",
    "if the argument is turned around , then the redshift distribution of grbs can , given enough statistics , be used as an independent test for the cosmic history of the star formation rate .",
    "alternatively , the gravitational collapse of supermassive stars ( @xmath41 @xmath42 5@xmath1410@xmath43 ) has been proposed as a cosmological source of grbs ( fuller & shi 1998 , zinnecker 1998 ) .",
    "since the formation , evolution and collapse of supermassive stars could be pregalactic , no galaxy hosts are required .",
    "the discovery of long - wavelength afterglow emission lasting for days to months constitutes a turning point in grb research .",
    "however , despite these exciting new data most of the basic questions remain unanswered .",
    "while a cosmological distance scale seems to be generally accepted , the nature of the grb host remains open .",
    "furthermore , the complexity of grb time histories , duration and spectra as well as spectral evolution during the bursts are not easily explained in the various variants of the fireball model which is widely accepted as the main scenario for the production of the @xmath0-ray burst emission .",
    "finally , the origin of the grb energy source remains a mystery .",
    "possibly , knowledge of the history of the early cosmic evolution is required to understand the origin of grbs .",
    "thus , despite ( or due to ) the discovery of flaring counterparts at longer wavelengths grbs remain an exciting field of research in the foreseeable future .",
