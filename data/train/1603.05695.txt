    "the first hydroxyl megamaser ( ohm ) was discovered by @xcite in arp 220 .",
    "the luminosity of the galaxy s oh emission line exceeded @xmath1 ( orders of magnitude more luminous than known galactic oh masers ) , leading to the rise of the term ` megamaser ' to describe masers with isotropic line luminosities in the range @xmath2 .",
    "early ohm surveys such as @xcite focused on galaxies with bright radio continuum and found @xmath320 ohms . after the launch of iras",
    ", surveys such as @xcite and @xcite used ir properties to select ulirg - like candidates with flat far - ir spectral indices and steep mid - ir spectral indices ; these surveys discovered @xmath030 ohms .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ( hereafter the arecibo megamaser survey ) carried out a deep survey using ir selection criteria that roughly doubled the number of known ohms .",
    "there are @xmath0110 known ohms up to @xmath4 , most of which are listed in @xcite .",
    "all known ohms are found in ( ultra ) luminous infrared galaxies ( [ u]lirgs ) , extreme starburst galaxies that are almost exclusively the products of major galaxy mergers @xcite .",
    "merger phase is correlated with the far infrared ( fir ) luminosity of ulirgs , and the ohm fraction in ulirgs is a strong function of the fir luminosity @xcite ; this suggests that the presence of an ohm in a ulirg indicates the phase of the merger .",
    "ohms are also associated with high dense molecular gas fractions @xcite , further indicating their relation to merger phase .",
    "because ohms are observable at large distances , they could provide a useful tracer of the galaxy merger rate as a function of redshift .",
    "zeeman splitting of the oh line has also been observed in several ohms @xcite , allowing for direct measurement of magnetic fields in star - forming regions .",
    "while ohms are interesting in their own right , they can also contaminate in blind emission line surveys for neutral hydrogen ( ) . if @xmath5 , oh and lines appear at the same frequency and ohms can be mis - identified as sources . while the fraction of ohms in low - redshift surveys is small , this fraction is expected to increase with redshift and reach 50% by @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "it is therefore necessary to develop a method to separate oh and lines in blind spectral line surveys before the advent of high - redshift surveys ( e.g. askap , * ? ? ?",
    "in this work , we present the first ohms detected in a blind spectral line survey .",
    "five new ohms at @xmath7 were detected in the 40% data release of the arecibo legacy fast arecibo l - band feed array survey ( alfalfa , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a blind emission line survey for at @xmath8 . after confirming that the number and ir properties of these ohms match empirical predictions , we develop a method to separate oh from lines without the use of optical spectroscopy",
    ".    throughout this work ,",
    "we assume a @xmath9cdm cosmology with @xmath10 , and @xmath11 km s@xmath12 mpc@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "we identified a total of 194 objects as potential ohms by selecting objects from the alfalfa 40% data release @xcite that had no optical counterpart velocity or an optical velocity that differed from the hi velocity by more than 300 km s@xmath12 .",
    "we rejected large spiral galaxies that are clearly hi emitters .",
    "when more than one possible optical counterpart fell within the alfalfa position ellipse , we selected the closest wise mid - ir counterpart detected at 22 @xmath13 m for optical spectroscopy .",
    "we observed candidate ohms at the apache point observatory over 15 sessions between december 2011 and march 2013 .",
    "observations were made using the dual imaging spectrograph at the apache point observatory ( apo ) 3.5 m telescope with the b400/r300 grating and a 1.5 \" spectroscopic slit .",
    "this setup has a dichroic wavelength of @xmath05350    and a resolving power of r@xmath03250 on the red side and r@xmath02400 on the blue side .",
    "most targets had 2 - 4 observed frames , for a total exposure time of 5 - 20 minutes for typical objects and 1 - 2 hours for the faintest targets .",
    "calibration images included bias frames , quartz lamp flat field frames , and spectra of helium , neon , and argon arc lamps for wavelength calibration .",
    "data reduction followed standard procedures for the iraf ` longslit ' package .",
    "upper bounds for the pixel -   axis transformation uncertainty were 4  km  s@xmath12 on the red side and 21  km  s@xmath12 on the blue side .",
    "we adjusted the wavelength solution to heliocentric velocity using ` rvcorrect ' and ` dopcor ' ; this process added around 1  km  s@xmath12 of uncertainty in the wavelength solutions .",
    "upper bounds for the wavelength calibration uncertainty were 125  km  s@xmath12 on the blue side and 92 km  s@xmath12 on the red side . after calibration , we aligned and median stacked exposures of the same science target .",
    "we made line measurements using the iraf ` splot ' task .",
    "the red side of the spectrum usually showed h@xmath14 ( 6563   ) bracketed by two [ nii ] lines ( 6549 and 6583  ) , with a [ sii ] doublet ( 6717 and 6731  ) on the redward side . on the blue side , the most common lines were h@xmath15 ( 4861  ) and two [ oiii ] lines ( 5007 and 4959  ) .",
    "we also commonly observed other lines in the balmer series of hydrogen as well as the 3727   [ oii ] line on the blue side .",
    "most objects had at least 5 - 7 observed optical lines , with 9 lines common . only in a few cases were fewer than 5 lines observed .",
    "we measured rms noise for each target in clean regions of the spectrum , away from astronomical sources , night sky lines , and cosmic rays .",
    "we calculated final redshifts using an error - weighted average of the individual line measurements .",
    "the typical final uncertainty in redshift was @xmath16 , or 0.6  km  s@xmath12 .",
    "the maximum centroid uncertainty observed was @xmath17 , or 16  km  s@xmath12 .",
    "typical and maximum values for all factors contributing to the the final uncertainty in measured velocities are : instrumental uncertainty , 112 km  s@xmath12 typical and 125 km  s@xmath12 maximum ; wavelength calibration , 13 km  s@xmath12 typical and 21  km  s@xmath12 maximum ; heliocentric calibration , 1  km  s@xmath12 maximum ; and line centroid uncertainty , 1  km  s@xmath12 typical and 16  km  s@xmath12 maximum . adding these uncertainties in quadrature",
    ", we arrive at 113  km  s@xmath12 typical uncertainty and 128  km  s@xmath12 maximum uncertainty .",
    "we thus conservatively adopt 130  km  s@xmath12 as the uncertainty on all optical recession velocity measurements .",
    "for each observation , we could make one of three determinations .",
    "the first , and most common , was that the velocity of the observed object matched ( within uncertainty ) the velocity listed in the alfalfa catalog .",
    "it was also possible for the object s velocity to match the oh velocity , found by recalculating the velocity in the alfalfa catalog using an oh rest frequency instead of an rest frequency : @xmath18 where @xmath19 and we adopt a frequency of 1667.35903 mhz for oh and 1420.405752 mhz for .",
    "these objects are ohms .",
    "the third possible outcome was ambiguous , where the observed velocity matched neither the nor the oh velocity .",
    "these ambiguous cases are observations of the incorrect optical counterpart or of a false positive alfalfa detection .",
    "we identified five previously undiscovered ohms through apo observations .",
    "additionally , @xcite identified one previously discovered ohm ( agc 181310 , iras 08201 + 2801 , discovered by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in the alfalfa @xmath14.40 release .",
    "these six objects are the only known ohms in the alfalfa @xmath14.40 database . extrapolating to the full sample size indicates alfalfa will detect on the order of 15 total new ohms , slightly lower than @xcite predictions that the survey ` should detect several additional dozen ohms . '",
    "table [ ohmatch ] lists the optical , oh , and velocities for the six alfalfa ohms as well as the line peak and width from alfalfa @xcite . alfalfa extracts line peaks and widths using a matched - filtering approach described in @xcite ; the templates used are hermite functions .",
    "table [ ohprop ] lists the infrared properties of the ohms .",
    "figure [ fig : spectra ] shows the spectra of the six ohms .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ postcut_ks ]        alfalfa objects that remain after the four ir cuts are plotted in color - color and color - magnitude space in figure  [ postcut ] .",
    "there are 83 remaining sources , of which 43 are detected in wise 22  @xmath13 m .",
    "the ir cuts removed 99.3% of all sources and 99.3% of sources detected in wise 22 @xmath13 m , increasing the fraction of ohms in the post - cut alfalfa sample two orders of magnitude from @xmath20 to @xmath21 .",
    "other than a few outliers , the oh and detections that remain after the cuts are spread fairly uniformly across wise space ; this indicates that further cuts would not significantly improve the separation of the two populations .",
    "it is necessary to introduce a redshift dependence to the magnitude and color cuts listed in table [ cuts ] if the cuts are to be used for higher - redshift surveys .",
    "we used arp 220 , the closest ohm and ulirg , as a template spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "the sed was created using spitzer spectra from @xcite ; the optical and near - ir data were fit using two stellar components ( old and young ) , and the far - ir sed was fit using dust continuum models from @xcite . in figure",
    "[ zevolution ] , we plot the redshift evolution of arp 220 and our infrared cuts in wise color - color and color - magnitude space .",
    "the arp 220 tracks remain within the ir cuts for the alfalfa ohm redshift range , @xmath22 .",
    "the tracks above this redshift indicate how the cuts should evolve for application to planned future surveys .",
    "we note that the redshift evolution results in most ohms being undetectable in the wise 22 @xmath13 m band by a redshift of @xmath23 .",
    "however , it may be possible to continue to separate and oh lines without use of the wise 22 @xmath13 m band or by applying the techniques used in this work to deeper ir catalogs .",
    "in this work we identified oh megamasers in the alfalfa survey , confirmed their number and ir properties matched empirical predictions based on previous surveys , and developed a method to separate oh megamasers from 99% of line emitters without optical spectroscopy .",
    "optical spectroscopy of 194 candidate ohms in alfalfa confirmed 129 uncertain optical counterparts and discovered 5 new ohms .",
    "only one previously known ohm lay within the survey s volume and detection limits ; this ohm was detected , raising the total number of ohms in alfalfa to six . integrating the ohlf @xcite over the sky footprint , redshift range , and luminosity detection limits of alfalfa predicts @xmath24 ohms in the survey , consistent with the six detections .",
    "previous ohm surveys selected candidates based on ir properties ; the alfalfa ohms are the first found in a blind spectral line survey .",
    "we used k - s tests to show that the two ohm populations come from the same statistical distribution in wise color and magnitude as well as iras 60- and 100-@xmath13 m flux and fir luminosity .",
    "this validates the ir selection criteria used in previous surveys and suggests there is no previously unknown ohm - producing environment at @xmath25 .",
    "we used the wise all - sky source catalog to determine if oh line emitters can be distinguished from line emitters without the use of optical spectroscopy .",
    "this is of particular interest for planned high - redshift surveys , as the percentage of oh lines in an survey is expected to increase with redshift and reach @xmath050% by @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "k - s tests confirm that the alfalfa and oh populations can be distinguished in wise color and magnitude space , and four ir cuts ( table [ cuts ] ) reduce the total number of objects from 12,416 to 83 and the number of objects detected in wise 22 @xmath13 m from 5,801 to 43 , excluding 99.3% of the alfalfa sample . after the cuts ,",
    "k - s tests could not distinguish the oh and populations ; this indicates further cuts in wise space can not further separate the two populations .",
    "it is possible that the ohm fraction could be increased using additional data such as galaxy morphology .",
    "the redshift evolution of the closest ohm , arp 220 , provides guidelines for adjusting the wise color and magnitude cuts for higher - redshift surveys .",
    "however , the sensitivity of the wise 22  @xmath13 m band precludes the use of a [ 22 ] @xmath13 m cut at @xmath26 .",
    "while a separation scheme based only on wise data can distinguish oh from , future work should investigate a separation scheme using additional data sources before the advent of high - redshift surveys .",
