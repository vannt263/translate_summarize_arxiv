    "in the optical band , the cluster luminosity function ( hereafter lf ) has three regimes : a bright end ( @xmath9 mag , @xmath10 km s@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 ) , a flat slope ( @xmath12 ) down to luminosity of dwarf galaxies ( lpez  cruz et al . 1997 ; garilli , maccagni & andreon 1999 ) , and then a steep increase ( impey , bothun & malin 1988 ; ferguson 1989 ; thompson & gregory 1993 ; secker & harris 1996 ; secker , harris & plummer 1997 ) .",
    "often a dip is found in the otherwise flat part of the lf ( see , e.g. , godwin & peach 1977 ; bucknell , godwin & peach 1979 ) .",
    "a few well studied clusters ( smith , driver & phillipps 1997 ) , as well as number of lfs published a long time ago ( schechter 1976 ) display an intermediate slope ( @xmath2 ) instead of a flat lf .",
    "the lf represents the zero  order statistics of galaxy samples and gives the relative number of galaxies as a function of the magnitude .",
    "almost every quantity is , therefore ,  weighted \" by the lf , including obvious quantities , such as the galaxy color distribution , and also less obvious ones , such as correlations involving the luminosity ( see , for example , the discussion on the impact of magnitude limits in the size ",
    "luminosity relation by simard et al .",
    "when the sample is not complete in volume a further  weight \" should be added : the selection function .",
    "thus , an accurate knowledge of the lf is important when comparing galaxies of different luminosities at different redshifts .    from a physical point of view",
    ", the optical lf is the convolution of the number of galaxies of a given mass with their m / l distribution .",
    "then , any measure of the optical lf traces a complex mix of galaxy mass and m / l distributions , so that evolution in luminosity or mass could not be easily disentangled from the measurement of the optical lf",
    ". a better estimate of the galaxy mass than the optical luminosity will certainly help to separate the two dependencies .",
    "such a measure has a particular relevance in the determination of the density of the universe : a possible way to proceed is to compute the cluster mass per unit luminosity times the universe luminosity density . as stressed by calberg et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , this calculation assumes that cluster galaxies have the same lf as field galaxies .",
    "observations suggest instead that galaxies change their optical luminosity during their infall in the cluster ( see , for example , bothun & dressler 1986 ; andreon 1996 , and most of the papers by the cnoc collaboration , such as balogh et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and references therein ) , although the amplitude and the sign of the luminosity variation is not yet settled .",
    "of course , it would be preferable to measure the m / l of clusters using a luminosity indicator weakly affected by possible bursts or halt of star formation induced by interactions with the hostile cluster environment .",
    "the near  infrared luminosity has several advantages with respect to optical luminosities .",
    "it is tightly correlated to the galaxy mass ( at least for spirals , gavazzi , pierini & boselli 1996 ) and , with respect to the optical luminosity , it is less affected by short and recent star formation events ( bruzual & charlot 1993 ) , possibly induced by interactions , and by dust absorption . therefore , the near  infrared lf traces more directly the mass function and gives a universe density less affected by possible systematic errors due to a differential star formation history between galaxies in clusters and in the field .",
    "there are several additional advantages in observing galaxies in the near  infrared : k corrections are relatively small and well known , thus allowing to observe and to compare galaxies at different redshifts , up to high redshift values .",
    "in particular , k corrections are almost independent from the spectral type of galaxies , in such a way that statistics on a population of galaxies are less affected by changes of the morphological composition induced by differential corrections from type to type .",
    "furthermore , galaxies that undergo a starburst are not selected preferentially , as instead happens in the optical , and therefore a sample selection in the near  infrared is less biased by episodic events of star formation .",
    "it is therefore important to measure the near  infrared lf of clusters of galaxies over a magnitude range as wide as possible , in particular to characterize the properties of galaxies in the local universe .",
    "so far , the near  infrared lf have been measured for a few clusters , but to bright limiting magnitudes ( barger et al .",
    "1996 , trentham & mobasher 1998 , de propris et al .",
    "1999 ) , and on a portion of the coma cluster ( de propris et al .",
    "1998 ) , down to relatively faint magnitudes .",
    "according to de propris et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , the coma lf shows a flat slope , and a step increase ( @xmath13 ) at faint magnitudes ( @xmath14 mag ) .",
    "however , this is presently the only lf determination attaining intermediate magnitudes , and such a survey could be improved in several respects .",
    "it is important to extend the study to other regions , and to reach deeper magnitudes .",
    "this is the aim of the present paper .",
    "we present the near  infrared lf of the coma cluster , based on independent observations , fully documented in a companion paper that also presents the photometric catalog . with respect to de propris",
    "1998 ) , this study has been performed on a different portion of the coma cluster , slightly overlapping with their one , over an area which is @xmath15 40 % smaller , but it attains one magnitude deeper .",
    "all along this paper , we adopt @xmath16 km s@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 and q@xmath17 0.1 .",
    "coma galaxy counts and lf have been computed from the photometry presented in andreon , pell , davoust et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , to which we defer for details ( hereafter paper i ) . in summary , a @xmath18 arcmin region of the coma cluster , located @xmath19 arcmin from the centre ,",
    "have been imaged with the moicam camera at the 2.0 m bernard lyot telescope at pic du midi .",
    "images were taken in the @xmath0 band under moderate to good seeing conditions ( i.e. @xmath20 arcsec ) , with average exposure time of @xmath21 sec .",
    "about 300 objects have been detected and classified by sextractor version 2 ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) in the best exposed part of our mosaic ( @xmath22 arcmin@xmath23 ) .",
    "different magnitudes are presented in paper i. we adopt here the kron magnitudes ( see kron 1980 for the exact definition , and bertin & arnouts 1996 for the software implementation ) .",
    "they are defined as the flux measured in a region which area is adapted to each galaxy .",
    "unfortunatly , they depend sensibly on the determination of the object size , in particular for faint objects , and therefore , for faint objects we prefer aperture magnitudes .",
    "more precisely , we adopt , as a measure of the magnitude for a galaxy , the magnitude computed within 2.5 kron radii for galaxies brighter than @xmath24 mag , and aperture magnitudes ( within 10 arcsec aperture ) for fainter galaxies .",
    "the two quantities are identical , within the errors , for galaxies in a large magnitude range including @xmath25 mag ( paper i ) .",
    "the catalog is complete , in the 10 arcsec aperture magnitude , down to @xmath26@xmath27 mag . to be safe and for easy computation",
    ", we cut the catalog at @xmath28 mag .",
    "given the galaxy catalog and the knowledge of the surveyed area , galaxy counts in the coma direction are computed straightforwardly .",
    "they are presented in figure 1 ( open dots ) , as derived for objects identified as galaxies ( see paper i for details ) .",
    "the coma cluster lf is computed as the statistical excess of galaxies in the coma cluster direction with respect to other directions . in order to estimate the fore and background contribution of the field",
    ", we use when possible observed values measured by different authors , as well as a simple standard model for number counts , based on pure luminosity evolution for galaxies ( see rocca - volmerange & guiderdoni , 1990 , pozzetti et al .",
    "1996 and pozzetti et al . 1998 ) and computed through the bruzual & charlot evolutionary code ( 1993 , updated as gissel98 ) .",
    "the parameters of the counts model have been set up in order to roughly reproduce the observed number counts to b = 28 mag ( williams et al .",
    "1996 ) , and normalized to the observed counts at @xmath28 mag .",
    "this model is only used in order to derive the mean redshift of the dominant population at a given magnitude , when comparing with other lf estimates , computed with other filters .",
    "field counts have been measured on the @xmath0 band images of the hubble deep field south 1 & 2 ( hereafter hdfs1+s2 ) , presented in da costa et al .",
    "these images were taken at the ntt and they are much deeper ( several magnitudes ) than our coma images , but extending to a smaller region and exposed in an non uniform way .",
    "we have used their uniformly exposed part , a central region @xmath29 pixel wide ( i.e. @xmath30 arcmin@xmath23 large , thus more than 10 times smaller than the coma area studied in this paper ) .",
    "we have detected and classified objects in this hdfs1+s2 area by means of sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) , using the same parameters as in paper i. figure 1 presents the resulting counts ( closed triangles ) . at @xmath31 mag ,",
    "field counts have large errors because the hdfs1+s2 is not tailored for measuring galaxy counts at such bright magnitudes , but for going deep on a small region .",
    "this fact prompt us to look for a @xmath0 band survey more adapted to our aims , i.e. shallower and wider . since it does not exist",
    ", we get a different estimate of the @xmath0 band galaxy counts using @xmath32 band galaxy counts and assuming a mean @xmath33 color for galaxies in the relevant magnitude range .",
    "the observed color of @xmath34 mag galaxies is @xmath35 mag ( stanford , eisenhardt & dickinson 1995 ) .",
    "this value is also in fairly good agreement with the mean @xmath33 expected from the counts model ( @xmath36 mag to @xmath37 mag , where the population is dominated by galaxies with @xmath38 at @xmath34 mag , and with @xmath39 at @xmath40 mag ) .",
    "we apply the mean @xmath33 value to the bershady , lowenthal & koo ( 1998 ) compilation of @xmath32 band surveys .",
    "these counts are presented in figure 1 as a strip with center given by the average counts presented in their paper .",
    "there are also presented in figure 1 the expected number counts derived from our model ( solid line histogram ) . in spite of unavoidable differences between the types of magnitude used by the different authors , and also the approximations involved in the conversions between photometric systems , the agreement between the galaxy counts in the hdfs1+s2 direction and the @xmath0 counts estimated from @xmath32 counts is very good .",
    "they are also in good agreement with the counts derived form our simple model .",
    "we adopt these counts as average background counts in the coma direction .",
    "an expected and important source of error in the lf determination is the background variance from field to field , in addition to poissonian fluctuations : if the background variance is high , then the background in the coma direction could be significatively different from the average computed above . among the @xmath32 band",
    "shallow surveys , two of them are adapted to roughly compute the order of magnitude of this variance .",
    "gardner et al . (",
    "1993 ) presented galaxy counts for the hmds ( hawaii medium deep survey ) extending over an area which is only half of that sampled for coma , and also for the hmws ( hawaii medium wide survey ) , extending over a much wider area than the present one .",
    "the counts in the two surveys show a @xmath41 % scatter , and we adopt this value as a typical fluctuation for the background ( to be added quadratically to poissonian fluctuations ) .",
    "the amplitude of the strip in figure 1 shows this scatter .",
    "this background variance seems plausible for two reasons : first , counts in the hdfs1+s2 , which extend on an area @xmath42 times smaller than our one , and @xmath43 times smaller than the hdms survey , are well within the strip , showing that background fluctuations are unlikely to be larger than our derived variance .",
    "secondly , the expected field to field fluctuations are @xmath44 % , according to the formulas ( and the hypothesis ) in huang et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "figure 1 shows that at all magnitudes considered here , the coma cluster counts have small errors and stand out with respect to the field counts , down to @xmath45 mag .",
    "therefore , errors on the coma lf will be small and only slightly affected by the background subtraction . in order to judge on the progress achieved in this paper with respect to previous investigations",
    ", the reader can compare our magnitude ",
    "counts diagram with the analogous one in mobasher & trentham ( 1998 ) for a much smaller ( and denser ) region of coma .",
    "these authors took an observational strategy quite different from our one : given the available telescope time , they went as deep as possible on a very small area , which resulted in a large field to field background variance .",
    "given the counts in the coma direction and in the field , and their errors , the computation of the coma cluster lf is an algebrical exercise .",
    "we stress that our main sources of error on the coma lf are poissonian fluctuations of total counts over the coma region and the background field to field variance .",
    "therefore , the error on the background is not derived from the hdfs1+s2 errorbars ( which are not relevant for the determination of the lf errors ) .",
    "the near  infrared coma lf is presented in figure 2 .",
    "it is characterized by a bright end ( at @xmath46 mag ) , a part increasing gently down to @xmath47 mag , and an  outlier \" point at @xmath48 mag , which produce , if real , a dip in the coma lf .",
    "the lf displayed in figure 2 is the deepest ever measured in any near  infrared band for any type of environment for a near  infrared selected sample .    in the optical ,",
    "the coma cluster exhibits a similar shape ( godwin & peach 1977 ; secker & harris 1996 ) . using godwin , metcalfe & peach ( 1983 ) data , we computed the @xmath49 ( a photographic @xmath50-like blue filter ) coma lf in almost exactly the same area surveyed in the @xmath0 band . for simplicity ,",
    "we have considered a rectangular area enclosing our @xmath0 band region , without taking into account the complex geometry of our region in details .",
    "then , because the @xmath0 and @xmath49 band magnitudes are available for all galaxies in this area , we have computed a mean @xmath51 pseudo - color . in order to compare the two lfs ,",
    "we have shifted the @xmath49 band lf by the mean @xmath51 pseudo - color : @xmath52 mag .",
    "the expected values according to bruzual & charlot models are @xmath53 for elliptical galaxies and up to @xmath54 for blue constant star - forming systems ; thus an averaged population of @xmath55 of ellipticals versus @xmath56 of blue systems gives roughly the right mean value as expected .",
    "no normalization in @xmath57 has been applied .",
    "the result of this exercise is shown in figure 2 as a dashed - line histogram .",
    "the two lfs are remarkably similar : there is a close agreement between the cut at @xmath58 mag , the dip location ( @xmath48 mag ) , the dip amplitude and the increase observed at fainter magnitudes ( closed dots ) and expected from the @xmath49 lf ( dashed histogram ) .",
    "we have performed the same exercise with the @xmath5 band photometry by secker & harris ( 1996 ) , who studied an adjacent region of the coma cluster .",
    "the expected values according to bruzual & charlot models are @xmath59 for early  type galaxies and @xmath60 for blue star - forming systems , giving an averaged value of @xmath61 for the same weighted population taken above ( @xmath55 of ellipticals versus @xmath56 of blue systems ) . this time we adopt the predicted value because the @xmath5 catalog is not published .",
    "the two surveyed regions are different , thus we normalize their lf to our @xmath0 lf .",
    "we obtain similar results , with the difference that the importance of the dip is smaller in @xmath5 than in @xmath0 ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "thus , the shape and the amplitude of the coma lf seems not to be strongly depend on the wavelength when we compare the results in @xmath49 and in @xmath0 bands , and also , with less confidence , in the @xmath5 band .",
    "the strong similarity of the optical and near  infrared lf implies that in the near  infrared there is no new population of galaxies which disappears in the optical band ( because dust obscured , for example ) , down to the magnitude of dwarfs .",
    "furthermore , if the @xmath0 band lf traces the galaxy mass function in this cluster , the same holds true for the blue lf .",
    "this result has been obtained in a particular region of coma , wich is a cluster rich in elliptical and lenticular galaxies . before any generalization , this result should be checked in other regions of the cluster , and also in other environment conditions ( cluster outskirts , clusters rich in spiral galaxies , groups , ... ) .",
    "let us consider in more details the dip point .",
    "the question is : is it really an outlier ?",
    "the statistical significance of the possible outlier point must be evaluated from the galaxy counts , since they are the original source of fluctuations .",
    "the @xmath48 mag bin in figure 2 corresponds to the @xmath63 mag bin in figure 1 .",
    "first of all , we exclude the possibility that we have missed some galaxies of this magnitude , because we are complete 2.5 mag fainter , and because a typical galaxy of @xmath63 mag have a central brightness of 100 times the sky noise .",
    "secondly , there is no relation between the location of the dip and the discontinuity of the magnitude system adopted ( kron magnitudes for bright galaxies and aperture magnitudes for faint ones ) : galaxy counts does not change because the separation is set to @xmath24 mag . in fact , kron and aperture magnitudes have almost the same value down to the last magnitude bin ( see figure 10 in paper 1 ) .",
    "there are two galaxies in the @xmath63 mag bin , whereas @xmath64 are needed to make the counts smooth .",
    "therefore , this point is more than 3 @xmath65 away from the average of adjacents bins . to be precise , according to poissonian statistics we can reject at more than 99.95 % confidence level the hypothesis that the observed number of galaxies is drawn from a parent distribution which counts @xmath64 galaxies in that bin .",
    "therefore , the dip is a real feature of the coma near  infrared lf in this region .",
    "the dip in the coma lf had firstly been noticed in the optical band ( for example , godwin et al .",
    "1983 ) and it had been interpreted in two different ways .",
    "biviano et al .",
    "( 1995 ) suggested that galaxies brighter than the dip were subjected to a recent episode of star formation induced by the hostile coma environment , which have made them brighter .",
    "andreon ( 1998 ) has shown that the lf of the different morphological types of galaxies are equal in coma and in much poorer environments , and that the dip is simply the combined result of the coma cluster morphological composition together with the shape of the type ",
    "dependent lfs . if the induced star - formation interpretation by biviano et al .",
    "( 1995 ) was correct , the dip should be absent or at least highly attenuated in @xmath0 , because the near  infrared luminosity traces the galaxy mass and it is less affected by the short timescale starbursts that makes a few galaxies brighter than the magnitude of the dip .",
    "instead the dip is observed in the @xmath0 band .",
    "a few other near  infrared lf of clusters are ( poorly ) known .",
    "none of the five clusters studied by mobasher & trentham ( 1998 ) show such a dip .",
    "however , the area sampled in each cluster includes a tiny number of galaxies , so that errors are large and the visibility of a possible dip ( if present ) is arguable .",
    "the cumulative lf of three clusters at @xmath66 ( barger et al .",
    "1996 ) does not seem to show a dip , but it barely reaches the dip magnitude .",
    "the only truly comparable lf has been presented by de propris et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , and it is reproduced here in figure 4 ( open squares ) , together with the best schechter fit lf ( dotted line ) to our data .",
    "the fitting machinery adopted here is discussed in the next subsection .",
    "de propris et al . (",
    "1997 ) have used kron magnitudes for faint galaxies and aperture magnitudes ( within a 62 arcsec diameter ) for large galaxies ( de propris 1999 , private communication ) .",
    "the two lfs are in remarkable good agreement ( @xmath67 ) on the common range ( @xmath68 mag ) , with the exception of the dip bin , wich is present in our data and absent in de propris et al .",
    "( 1997 ) data .",
    "it is worth to note that the position of the dip is well within the spectroscopic sample of de propris and collaborators , and thus it could be hardly missed .",
    "the agreement would be even better at @xmath69 if the de propris et al .",
    "( 1997 ) bright magnitudes were of kron type , since kron magnitudes integrate the galaxy flux inside a smaller area than those sampled by the 62 arcsec aperture they used .    since de propris et al .",
    "( 1997 ) studied an almost complementary area of the coma cluster with respect our one , and the dip is present in our lf and absent in theirs , it is possible that the amplitude of the dip depends on the location in the cluster , as it seems to be the case in the optical ( sekiguchi 1998 ) .",
    "since the @xmath0 band luminosity traces the galaxy mass , as stressed in the introduction , the possible dependence of the dip amplitude on the cluster location points out a dependence of the mass function on the surveyed region , possibly due to a joint effect of morphological dependence of the lf and variation of the morphological composition over the coma cluster .",
    "a similar trend is seen in the optical ( andreon 1998 ) .",
    "such differences in the lf as a function of the location in the cluster could be related to subcluster structure .",
    "several evidences for cluster - cluster merger are present in coma .",
    "two main peaks appear in the x - ray flux density ( white et al .",
    "1993 ) , in the projected distribution of galaxies ( fitchett & webster 1987 , mellier et al .",
    "1988 ) and in the radio source counts ( kim et al .",
    "1994 ) : a clump centered on ngc4874 and ngc 4889 , and a secondary peak around ngc 4839 , about 40 sw from the previous one .",
    "the field surveyed here is centered @xmath70 ne from the main structure , at the opposite side with respect to the cluster center .",
    "colless et al .",
    "( 1993 ) have shown the complex dynamics and multiple substructure of the coma cluster using a large redshift catalog . according to them",
    ", the ngc 4839 group is actually falling into the main cluster , there are two subclusters in the central region ( associated with the two dominant galaxies ) , and late type galaxies are falling into the main cluster ( which is dominated by early type galaxies ) .",
    "these processes might be able to locally modify the lf as observed .",
    "let us consider now the overall shape of the lf .",
    "usually , a @xmath71 method is used to fit the lf of clusters by a schechter ( 1976 ) function :    @xmath72    the @xmath71 method is not the optimal one for fitting a function to a small number of bins , and it is even less suitable when bins are poorly populated .",
    "furthermore , a @xmath71 requires to bin the data with an arbitrary bin size .",
    "although the @xmath71 method is not optimal , we are forced to use it , since we do not know any other fitting method that could take into account , even roughly , background fluctuations together with poissonian ones without binning the data .",
    "more elegant methods implemented so far , such as maximum  likelyhood fitting , do not take into account neither poissonian fluctuations of the background counts , nor the field to field variance of the background , and therefore they systematically underestimate the true errors .    in order to take into account the amplitude of the bin in the fitting process ( a technical detail seldom considered ) , we fit the data with a schechter function convolved with the bin width ( although in practice this detail makes almost no difference on the results ) .",
    "an additional problem arises : given the existence of a real dip in the coma lf , the fit of the whole lf with any schechter function is necessarily poor ( and in fact we found a minimum @xmath71 of 14 for 4 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "we are therefore left with two options : flag the dip point , or use a more complex function .",
    "disposing of a very small number of points and lacking any physically motivated more elaborate function to be fitted , we simply flag the outlier bin .    in that case , and taking into account the finite amplitude of the bin , we found @xmath73 mag and @xmath74 , but with large confidence intervals ( as shown in figure 3 ) . note that our magnitude limit , @xmath45 mag , is roughly equivalent to @xmath75 mag at the coma distance for an early  type galaxy ( @xmath76 mag ) , which is well in the dwarf regime .",
    "@xmath77 agrees well with the values expected from the optical photometry and usual colors for early  type galaxies ( @xmath78 mag and @xmath76 mag ) .",
    "the slope is steeper than the typical value in optical bands ( lpez  cruz et al .",
    "1997 ; garilli , maccagni & andreon 1999 ) , but nevertheless it is quite similar to that found for a few well studied clusters in optical bands ( smith , driver & phillipps 1997 ; schechter 1976 ) .",
    "mobasher & trentham ( 1998 ) studied a very small portion of the coma cluster and were able to build a catalog 1.5 magnitudes deeper than ours .",
    "however , their studied field is too small to make the background variance small relative to the signal ( the coma lf ) , so that the resulting lf is completely unconstrained , as admitted by the authors .",
    "they computed also another lf , by performing a crude color selection , i.e. assuming that coma cluster galaxies lay , in a color  color plane , in a region different from that occupied by the fore and background galaxies . in that case , a lf with errorbars of reasonable size was derived , but under an hypothesis that should be demonstrated to be true . in figure 5 , this lf is plotted overlapped to our @xmath0 lf , after having matched the two lfs in the common bins .",
    "their @xmath32 magnitudes have been changed to @xmath0 assuming @xmath79 mag , the typical value expected for the coma galaxies .",
    "our errorbars are smaller in the common bins , even using the same binning for the two lfs .",
    "mobasher & trentham ( 1998 ) points stay relatively near the extrapolation of the best schechter fit to our data , suggesting that the lf could keep its @xmath2 slope even at these very faint magnitudes ( roughly equivalent to @xmath80 mag ) .",
    "the same points stay near the secker & harris ( 1996 ) @xmath5 band coma lf shifted in the @xmath0 band , as plotted in figure 2 .",
    "figure 5 also compares the coma cluster lf to the local field lfs , as computed by gardner et al .",
    "( 1997 , dashed line ) and szokoly et al .",
    "( 1998 , solid line ) .",
    "the two field surveys differ in many respects .",
    "the former is based on a sample about 5 times larger than the latter , and it is computed from a near  infrared selected sample .",
    "instead , the latter is optically selected and no corrections have been applied for the optical selection .",
    "the slope of the field lf computed by gardner et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and by szokoly et al .",
    "( 1998 ) differ largely , with @xmath81 and @xmath2 , respectively . however , the 68 % confidence contours of the two lfs cross each other ( figure not shown ) , implying that the two lfs are compatible to @xmath82 , as also claimed by szokoly et al . (",
    "the two field lfs could have different slopes but they still remain compatible because they barely reach @xmath83 mag band , and have been transformed in the @xmath0 band assuming the same mean rest ",
    "frame color for all galaxies ( @xmath84 mag ) .",
    "this is a reasonable value for the brightest population , which is dominated by galaxies at @xmath85 , and therefore they sample only the exponentially declining part of the lf .",
    "therefore , the slope of the field lf is constrained by the faintest bin ( see figure 5 ) which , as in all field surveys , is quite uncertain because measured on a very small volume .    our own data for the coma @xmath0 lf are three mag deeper than the local field ones , and the overall shape , as parametrized by the schecther parameters , agrees with the field ones : the coma lf has @xmath86 and @xmath77 indistinguishable from the szokoly et al .",
    "( 1998 ) lf and a @xmath77 very similar to the gardner et al .",
    "( 1997 ) one .",
    "its slope , @xmath74 , is steeper than the gardner et al .",
    "( 1997 ) slope , but by less than @xmath82 difference , due to the large confidence level intervals of the two lfs .",
    "also , the present coma @xmath0 band lf agrees with the field @xmath87 computed by cowie et al .",
    "( 1996 ) in a few redshift ranges , up to @xmath88 .    on one side ,",
    "the overall shape of the lf is similar both in the field and in the coma cluster . on the other side ,",
    "no dip is present in near  infrared field lfs , whereas instead in our coma lf it is quite evident .",
    "this fact , and the absence of the dip in the coma region studied by de propris et al .",
    "( 1998 ) seems to suggest that the dip amplitude could be related to the morphological mix of the studied environment .",
    "the alternative possibility requires that environmental effects change the @xmath0 band luminosity preferentially at a given mass ( corresponding to @xmath89 mag ) , without altering too much the mass distribution for more massive galaxies .",
    "otherwise , the coma and the field lfs should have different bright tails .",
    "we have presented the near  infrared lf of a nearby cluster of galaxies , coma , down to faint magnitudes ( @xmath90 mag , i.e. @xmath91 mag corresponding roughly to @xmath92 mag ) .",
    "this has been provided to be possible due to the relatively deepness of the present images _ and _ to the small background variance associated with the large surveyed area .",
    "the computed lf is the deepest ever measured in the near  infrared , on any type of environment .",
    "the shape of the coma lf in the region studied seems not to depend on wavelength , at least in @xmath49 and @xmath0 bands , and with less confidence , in @xmath5 .",
    "the similarity of the lf implies that in the central region of coma there is basically no new population of galaxies which disappears or becomes too faint to be observed in the optical bands ( because of the presence of dust , for instance ) , down to the magnitudes of dwarfs .",
    "furthermore , if the @xmath0 band lf traces the galaxy mass function , also the blue lf traces the mass in this case .",
    "this is in apparent contradiction with the results by gavazzi , pierini & boselli ( 1996 ) , who found that for spiral galaxies the m / l is approximatively constant in the near  infrared but not in the optical filters . since our finding is based on just one sample in one particular environment , although selected with well understood selection criteria ( volume  complete ) , it has to be verified on other samples of nearby galaxies , possibly spiral - rich clusters or groups , before any dangerous generalization .    the bright part of the coma @xmath0 band lf , i.e. the brightest three magnitudes , agrees with the expectations based on optical lfs and usual colors for galaxies , and with what is observed in shallower near  infrared surveys of clusters of galaxies and also on the field .",
    "this confirms that the shape of the tip of the mass function seems environment  independent and therefore environmental effects have a minor impact on the luminosity of bright galaxies ( @xmath93 ) , and possibly on their masses . coma and the field population differ by a factor of 100 in galaxy density .",
    "the extension of this sentence to faint ( @xmath94 ) galaxies still await a determination of the field lf in the dwarf regime .    the coma near  infrared lf presents a real dip at a luminosity corresponding to that observed in the optical lf .",
    "this is the first detection of such a feature in the near  infrared .",
    "the existence of a dip in the coma lf in the @xmath0 band implies the presence of a dip also in the galaxy mass function . to our knowledge",
    ", there is presently no simulation of cluster formation which is able to produce such a feature in the galaxy mass or luminosity function .",
    "this feature , being distinctive , will set a strong constraint for the future simulations .",
    "kauffmann & charlot ( 1998 ) have shown that the apparent passive evolution and the slope of the color ",
    "magnitude relation can be accomodated within a hierarchical model , even if the galaxies themselves grow by mergers until late times .",
    "one of the important remaining issues is the comparison between the predicted and the observed lf , in particular , the distribution of galaxies as a function of their morphological type , at lest for early  type galaxies .",
    "probably the main limitation till now has been the lack of suitable observational data to compare with model expectations .",
    "our near  infrared catalog , published in paper i , joint to the morphological types for the coma galaxies , available from andreon et al .",
    "( 1996 , 1997 ) , fill this observational gap .",
    "the overall slope of the coma lf is intermediate ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the slope is measured down to the dwarfs regime : we reach @xmath92 using own our data alone and even fainter magnitudes ( @xmath95 , roughly equivalent to @xmath96 ) when including mobasher & trentham ( 1998 ) data and under their assumptions . when comparing coma and the field lfs in the near  infrared , we have to take into account that both lfs have been derived with completely different data and methods , because of the different selection criteria for the two samples : the field lf is computed on a flux ",
    "limited sample , whereas the cluster lf is computed on a volume  limited sample . in particular , the field lf suffers from a 10 % redshift incompleteness ( or is based on an optical selection , as for the szokoly et al .",
    "( 1998 ) lf ) , and a poor sampling of faint luminosities , because of the small volume explored at that luminosities . nevertheless , and even if the environments sampled are quite different , the bright tail of the coma and the field lfs are in close agreement . in our opinion , this exclude the possibility of large systematic errors in the derivation of field lfs , and therefore indirectly confirms the disagreement between the observed near - infrared lf and that expected on theoretical grounds in the present simulations of a hyerarchical univers ( kauffmann , colberg , diaferio & white , 1999 ) .",
    "this also suggests that more detailed models are needed to reproduce the observed properties of galaxies , such as the lf .",
    "in particular , as mentioned before , the existence of a dip in the present lf and the large range on which this lf is computed ( 7 mag ) provides a strong constraint to future simulations .",
    "it is worth to note that theoretical predictions on the behaviour of high order statistics , such as the color distribution or the galaxy evolution , use a particular realization of the lf as a  weight \" .",
    "thus , increasing the accuracy on the determination of the lf will certainly contribute to the improvement of the theoretical knowledge on galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "maurizio paolillo is warmly thanked for sharing with us the fitting code developed together .",
    "discussions with lucio chiappetti help to clarify several fortran subtilities .",
    "we are grateful to our collaborators in the near  infrared coma cluster projet , e. davoust & p. poulain ."
