    "in recent years there was some progress to answer the important question on the nature of quasiparticles in cuprate superconductors , but the task is not yet completed .",
    "usually , the problem is reduced to that of the hole motion in a two dimensional quantum antiferromagnet .",
    "many work was devoted to the @xmath4-@xmath5 model @xcite treating the antiferromagnet as a two - sublattice nel state .",
    "it was shown that the hole motion is characterized by a quasiparticle band of bandwidth @xmath6 that is separated from the incoherent part .",
    "@xcite the minimum of the dispersion is found at the momentum @xmath1 ( lattice constant @xmath7 ) nearly degenerate with the energy at @xmath8 .",
    "such a result was obtained by several methods .",
    "one of them is the self - consistent born approximation ( scba ) for a reduced version of the @xmath4-@xmath9 model consisting of spinless holes coupled to spinons .",
    "@xcite that method became especially popular since it is sufficiently simple and allows the calculation of the spectral function .",
    "it gives rise to a dispersion and also a spectral function which is symmetric with respect to the magnetic brillouin zone ( bz ) .",
    "similar results were obtained for the emery model .",
    "@xcite    in a remarkable experiment @xcite the quasiparticle dispersion of such a spin polaron was measured directly by creating a photohole in the antiferromagnetic insulator sr@xmath0cuo@xmath0cl@xmath0 . whereas the width of the dispersion was in reasonable agreement with the theoretical predictions , its shape had some deviations especially at the point @xmath8 in momentum space .",
    "afterwards it was shown that the deviations can be diminished by taking into account hopping terms to second and third neighbors in the @xmath4-@xmath10 model .",
    "@xcite these additional terms correspond to a proper treatment of direct oxygen - oxygen hopping in the emery model .",
    "@xcite however , some deviations between theory and experiment remain .",
    "so , the measurement shows no quasiparticle weight at the @xmath2-point @xmath11 but the spin polaron in the @xmath4-@xmath9 model has .",
    "next , one observes quite a remarkable damping especially away from the minimum . some theories ( especially the usual scba ) are symmetric with respect to the antiferromagnetic ( afm ) bz , but the experimental data show a strong asymmetry : after crossing the afm bz boundary ( coming from the @xmath2-point ) the quasiparticle looses its weight nearly abruptly .",
    "that deficiency , however , seems to be merely a property of the usual scba and not of the @xmath4-@xmath9 model itself .",
    "@xcite    in the usual scba there is no dispersion of the bare spinless hole ; the dispersion appears only due to the coupling to the spinons .",
    "therefore , one might expect large vertex corrections .",
    "in fact , however , the low order vertex corrections cancel in the pure @xmath4-@xmath9 model as it was noted in refs .  .",
    "such a cancelation is absent in the more realistic emery model .",
    "but there are many indications ( see also ref . ) , and we will add some arguments below , that the photoemission data can not be explained by the @xmath4-@xmath9 model alone , at least not throughout the whole bz .",
    "we concentrate in the present paper on the spin - fermion model ( the reduced form of the three - band emery model ) @xcite for the cuo@xmath0 plane and present a new scheme to calculate the spectral function starting from the mean field description @xcite of the spin polaron .",
    "one can expect that the fluctuations around the mean field spin polaron are smaller than around the dispersionless spinless hole .",
    "the mean field description of the spin polaron in the emery model was introduced in refs .. it is based on a description of the hole motion not in the two - sublattice nel state but in the spherically symmetric ( in spin space ) afm state with long range order ( lro ) . such a spin singlet state is characterized here by a vanishing expectation value of the magnetization @xmath12 ( the only possible nonzero expectation values are scalars with respect to rotations in spin space ) , but a finite value of the spin - spin correlations at infinite distance @xmath13 for @xmath14 . it can be constructed , for instance , from a resonating valence bond ( rvb ) state with long - range bonds that decay not too fast .",
    "@xcite the spherically symmetric state is an appealing candidate to study the transition from the paramagnetic spin liquid ( with only short range correlations ) to a state with long - range order .",
    "a spherically symmetric green s function ( gf ) theory for heisenberg models was constructed by kondo and yamaji ( ky ) @xcite and it will be used as one ingredient of the present theory . it is a gf decoupling scheme which is applicable to cases in which there is no symmetry breaking , especially to low dimensional systems ( for the 2d square lattice see refs .  ) . as a result , the carrier excitations ( moving in the spherically symmetric background ) preserve the periodicity relative to the full bz ( not the magnetic one ) .",
    "namely this leads to a qualitative agreement with the experimental results in the undoped compound sr@xmath0cuo@xmath0 cl@xmath0 .",
    "an explanation might be that the actual experiment was done at room temperature , whereas the nel temperature of sr@xmath0cuo@xmath0cl@xmath0 is only 250 k.    the aim of the present work is twofold . in the first place it is a methodical work proposing a new technique to calculate the spectral function of quasiparticles with complicated operator structure .",
    "our technique combines the mori - zwanzig projection method with a self - consistent calculation of the self - energy in terms of irreducible gf ( tserkovnikov technique @xcite ) . in difference to our recent works @xcite we introduce a simultaneous description of a spin polaron and a bare hole , and investigate the effects of direct oxygen - oxygen hopping which only gives us the possibility to reach a realistic description .",
    "furthermore , we discuss also the upper parts of the spectrum in the spin - fermion model whose lowest branch corresponds to the spin polaron . the second aim is to present numerical results for the spectral function .",
    "we will distinguish three regions in @xmath15-space where the spin polaron exists as a quasiparticle with infinite lifetime , with finite lifetime or where it is strongly overdamped .",
    "our method leads to several , qualitatively new features which are not present in the scba of spinless holes coupled to spinons . but these features may be observed in the experimental data for sr@xmath16cuo@xmath0cl@xmath0 .",
    "we are concentrating here on a qualitative discussion rather than fine tuning the parameters of the emery model in its spin - fermion form to obtain maximal agreement with experiment .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : after presenting the set of basis operators which define the mean field description of the spin polaron ( sec.3 ) we show the general procedure to calculate the damping ( sec .  4 ) and calculate the corresponding vertex ( sec .  5 ) .",
    "the self - consistent set of equations for the gf is given in sec .",
    "6 and the results are presented in sec .",
    "an extra hole propagating in the @xmath17 plane of cuprates strongly interacts with the antiferromagnetically correlated copper spin subsystem .",
    "the main features of the hole motion are described by the model : @xcite    @xmath18    @xmath19    @xmath20 \\;,\\ ] ]    with @xmath21 where @xmath22 .    here and below the summation over repeated indexes",

    "we do not introduce the explicit relative phases of @xmath31- and @xmath32 -orbitals since they can be transformed out by redefining the operators with phase factors @xmath33 . in order to compare our results with other authors and with experiment we restore these phases by changing in the final results @xmath34 .",
    "the parameter @xmath35 is the hopping amplitude of oxygen holes that take into account the coupling of the hole motion with the copper spin subsystem , @xmath9 is the constant of nearest neighbor afm exchange between the copper spins . for the parameter values",
    "we take @xmath36 0.5ev , @xmath37 throughout the paper , @xmath38 , or @xmath39 to illustrate the influence of direct oxygen - oxygen hopping .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) corresponds to the regime @xmath40 in the emery model .",
    "it can be obtained @xcite e.g.  by a canonical transformation of bare fermion operators @xmath41 .",
    "then the transformed operators @xmath42 which enter the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) acquire the admixture of bare operators at adjacent sites .",
    "for example , the  oxygen hole ",
    "operator in the eq .",
    "( [ hh ] ) may be expressed as @xmath43 this operator annihilates the hole in a state that is an antibonding ( in hole notation ) combination of the oxygen @xmath44 state and the singly occupied copper @xmath45 state at adjacent sites .",
    "the non - bosonic character of spin operators and the complexity of the spin subsystem ground state @xmath46 make a perturbative treatment of the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) difficult .",
    "for this reason we develop in the next sections the method of green s function calculation which combine the mori - zwanzig projection method ( pm ) @xcite with the tserkovnikov technique .",
    "the pm provides the possibility to allow for the local correlations thoroughly .",
    "for example , the local constraints are naturally included in the calculation .",
    "we thus obtain the proper description of small polaron ( so called zhang - rice ( zr ) singlet ) @xcite formation that is governed by the kondo term in @xmath47 . on the other hand",
    ", the pm always provides the green s function as the sum of simple poles , since only a finite number of basis operators may be included in the calculation .",
    "the consideration of polaron scattering on spin excitations , which is responsible for the damping of the polaron state , demands an infinite extension of the basis set .",
    "this can be done effectively by the self - consistent born approximation ( scba ) for the polaron self - energy , calculated within the tserkovnikov technique . @xcite",
    "that means that we suppose the effect of the residual polaron - spin interaction to be rather small and tractable within a self - consistent perturbative scheme .",
    "the main point here is the appropriate choice of the operator basis set for pm and a careful division of the interaction into mean field and residual part .",
    "> from the very beginning we want to take into account properly the local correlations @xmath47 without the violation of spin commutation relations .",
    "we consider a spin - liquid state with spin rotational symmetry for the copper subsystem , e.g.  the spin - spin correlation functions satisfy the relation @xmath48 .",
    "we choose a set of three basis operators .",
    "the first two of them constitute the zr polaron @xmath49 where the factors @xmath50 and @xmath51 arise due to the orthonormalization @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "in fact , the basis operators ( [ b1 ] ) can be combined in two ways corresponding to the zr singlet and part of the zr triplet state .",
    "only the lower lying singlet combination builds the spin polaron quasiparticle .",
    "we can also write @xmath54\\ ] ] where @xmath55 now it is easy to see that one has to introduce the operator @xmath56\\ ] ] in order to represent the full set of bare hole operators .",
    "that is important if we want to find the hole spectral weight of the spin polaron band .    in a first step",
    "we construct the three eigenoperators @xmath57 and the corresponding bands @xmath58 in the mean field approach : @xmath59 where we introduced a simplified notation for the most interesting lowest spin polaron band @xmath60 with the polaron annihilation eigenoperator @xmath61 .",
    "we use the projection method of mori and zwanzig @xcite and introduce the retarded green s functions ( gf ) : @xmath62 here we use zubarev s notations .",

    ". the mean field spectrum of all three bands is shown in figs .",
    "1(a ) and 1(b ) for two different parameter sets .",
    "in the following we will mainly concentrate on the eigenoperator of the lowest band , the polaron eigenoperator @xmath74 .",
    "the gf of the polaron quasiparticle is defined as : @xmath75 one has to distinguish between the polaron gf defined in ( [ pgf ] ) and the gf @xmath76 which gives the number of holes in a unit cell and is introduced as : @xmath77 please note that according to ( [ sw ] ) the gf @xmath78 counts not only the holes at oxygen sites , but has a contribution at the copper sites also . below we shall suppose that the intensity given by the photoemission experiments can be roughly compared with the hole spectral function which is dictated by @xmath76 .",
    "in the mean field approximation @xmath79 has the form @xmath80 which defines the pole strength @xmath81 of all three bands .",
    "if we restrict ourselves to the vicinity of the lowest pole @xmath82 the hole gf can be approximated by @xmath83 with @xmath84    let us first discuss the mean field spectrum of all three bands for the two parameter sets with and without direct oxygen - oxygen hopping @xmath85 ( figs.1(a ) and 1(b ) ) .",
    "first of all , one observes a well separated singlet band between 1 and 2 ev below the nonbonding one .",
    "the singlet - triplet splitting is maximal at @xmath86 and roughly 3 ev ( assuming @xmath87 to be 0.5 ev ) . that agrees quite reasonably with the splitting between the zr singlet and triplet states of 3.4 ev that were found in calculations for a cuo@xmath88 cluster . @xcite and experimental indications for the triplet state",
    "were found in a recent photoemission measurement of the substance ba@xmath0cu@xmath89o@xmath88cl@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite it is also interesting to note that the singlet band dispersion obeys nearly the antiferromagnetic symmetry ( with only small deviations due to the spin rotational invariant ground state ) but the triplet band not .",
    "the nonbonding band receives a dispersion due to @xmath85 .",
    "it has the maximum ( which would correspond to a binding energy maximum in a spectroscopic measurement ) at @xmath86 .",
    "one should note , however , that we did not include into our model all the three oxygen 2@xmath31 orbitals at a given site .",
    "there exist other nonbonding oxygen bands and especially that one with lowest binding energy at @xmath86 ( seen experimentally in ref . )",
    "is not present in our model .",
    "now , we discuss the lowest spin polaron band @xmath90 .",
    "comparison of figs .",
    "1(a ) and 1(b ) shows that the direct oxygen - oxygen hopping is responsible for the dispersion along the line @xmath91 .",
    "the dispersion dependence on frustration in spin subsystem and on temperature was extensively studied in our previous works @xcite within an extended basis set . from fig .  2 we see that the pole strength @xmath92 vanishes at the @xmath2 point ( with @xmath93 ) .",
    "this result is the consequence of a vanishing hybridization between oxygen and copper states at this point .",
    "furthermore , the triplet and the nonbonding oxygen bands are degenerate there .",
    "consequently , all the orbitals which are incorporated into our model give rise to only one oxygen derived peak in the photoemission spectra at the @xmath94 point . and indeed , the spin polaron is not visible in the photoemission spectra there .",
    "@xcite note that the vanishing of the hybridization , and consequently the vanishing of the spin polaron is ignored in the course of emery model reduction to the one - band hamiltonian ( see refs .   and references therein ) , and thus the hole spectral weight is nonzero at @xmath93 in the @xmath4-@xmath10 and other one - band models .",
    "even the theories for the three - band emery model which start from the nel order @xcite can not obtain zero spectral weight at @xmath95 since they always deal with a linear combination of states with momentum @xmath15 and @xmath96 ( @xmath97 .    we note also an apparent similarity of the polaron branch @xmath98 of the present spectrum with the calculations based on the nel state and linear spin wave theory for @xmath4-@xmath9 @xcite and three - band @xcite models . however , our results show a slight deviation from the symmetry of the magnetic brillouin zone @xmath99 due to the spin singlet state of the magnetic background .",
    "we see from fig .  1 that the mean field polaron bandwidth @xmath100 ( @xmath101 for @xmath102 ) . that is larger than expected due to the following reason : in the limit of small @xmath103 a state @xmath104 for a momentum @xmath15 near @xmath105 or @xmath106",

    "the energy of the states @xmath110 is of the order of @xmath111 for @xmath112 near the band bottom .",
    "it means that @xmath113 is unstable with respect to the decay into @xmath114 states and analogous states , which contain more spinwaves .",
    "these states contain spin distortions that are situated far from the hole . in order to take them into account within the pm",
    "we should extend the basis set up to infinity .",
    "on the other hand the effect of these states can be described by treating the scattering of the spin polaron in terms of irreducible gf , also known as the tserkovnikov technique .",

    "in this section we present the results for the low energy part of the one - particle retarded green s function @xmath192 ( [ ghh ] ) . in our treatment",
    "we ignore the scattering of a polaron to the upper bands . in this approximation the low energy part of @xmath193",
    "is related with the polaron green s function @xmath194 through eq .",
    "( [ ghgp ] ) .",
    "we are mostly interested in the spectral function of the polaron or hole gf , respectively , which are given by @xmath195 the spectral function of a bare hole @xmath196 is roughly proportional to the intensity in an angle resolved photoemission ( arpes ) experiment .",
    "the self - consistent equation ( [ gineq ] ) was solved by means of the recursive procedure that provides step by step the coefficients @xmath197 of the continued fraction expansion of @xmath198 .",
    "the details of the calculation will be published elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the two - dimensional simpson s rule was used for the integration in eq .",
    "( [ gineq1 ] ) over @xmath199 points in the irreducible part of the brillouin zone .",
    "the prominent feature of the expansion is the fast convergence of coefficients @xmath197 to the asymptotic behavior which is characterized by a linear dependence on @xmath200 .",
    "the slope for @xmath201 is twice as large as the slope for @xmath202 .",
    "this feature allows to use the incomplete gamma function as an analytic terminator @xcite for the continued fraction .",
    "we applied the terminator after the calculation of @xmath203 pairs of coefficients .",
    "our calculations for various models of strongly correlated electrons indicate that the linear growth of continued fraction coefficients seems to be a common feature of such models .",
    "the solid line in the figure 1 shows the dispersion @xmath204 of the lowest peak in the spectral density .",
    "first , we may see that the overall shape of the dispersion curve has not changed in comparison with the mean field result . on the other hand",
    ", we may note that the energy renormalization for the top of the band is larger than for the bottom resulting in substantial narrowing of the band .",
    "although the band width of the polaron in mean field @xmath90 is proportional to the hopping amplitude @xmath87 , it is reduced to a band width proportional to @xmath9 due to the scattering of the polaron at spin fluctuations which are inherent in @xmath205 .",
    "let us note that the polaron mean field energy @xmath90 represents the center of gravity of the polaron spectral function @xmath206 that is @xmath207 on the other hand , we see from the explicit expressions for the liouvillean matrix elements ( [ liu ] ) that @xmath60 is unambiguously related to the nearest neighbor and next - nearest neighbor static spin - spin correlation functions of the undoped system .",
    "the latter is described by the heisenberg hamiltonian ( [ j ] ) on the square lattice , and the correlation functions are known at present time with a very high accuracy from various analytic @xcite and numerical @xcite approaches .",
    "that means the asymmetry of @xmath90 ( with respect to the magnetic brillouin zone ) is not only a consequence of the particular approximations made in the present work , but already a property of the polaron spectral function itself .",
    "figure 3 gives the polaron and hole spectral densities for three characteristic momenta @xmath15 to distinguish three regimes .",
    "in addition , we show the real and imaginary parts of the self - energy @xmath208 which are approximately identical for polaron or hole gf according to eq .",
    "( [ ghgp ] ) .",
    "let us recall that we have made the change @xmath209 in the final results , so that the quasimomenta in the figures correspond to the actual brillouin zone of the @xmath17 plane , in contrast to our previous work .",
    "@xcite we find a sharp quasiparticle peak at the bottom of the spectra for @xmath210 and @xmath211 .",
    "the position of the quasiparticle peak corresponds to the condition @xmath212 , i.e. the point where we have a crossing of the functions @xmath213 and @xmath214 , see figs .",
    "3(a ) and 3(b ) .",
    "quite a different shape has the spectral density@xmath215 at @xmath216 .",
    "its lowest peak is not related to the zero of @xmath217 and is due to abrupt changes in the self - energy .",
    "that leads to a large imaginary part of @xmath218 at the position of the lowest peak in the spectral function .",
    "we may say that there is _ no _ quasiparticle excitation for this quasimomentum value .",
    "figure 4 shows the difference between the quasiparticle excitations at points @xmath219 and @xmath220 more in detail .",
    "the first one corresponds to a quasiparticle with infinite lifetime , i.e. to an isolated pole of the green s function at the real axis of the complex energy plane .",
    "for @xmath221 the situation is different , a very small , but finite , imaginary part of the self - energy is present in the region of the peak .",
    "the shape of the peak deviates from lorentzian .",
    "therefore , such an excitation can be regarded as a quasiparticle with finite lifetime .",
    "table 1 shows the position of the lowest peak , @xmath222 , the area under the peak for polaron @xmath223 and for hole spectral function , @xmath224 ( see ( [ ghgp ] ) ) , and the value of the imaginary part of the self - energy , @xmath225 $ ] for @xmath15 values which vary along the diagonal of the brillouin zone .",
    "the rows which are marked by a star do not represent a quasiparticle excitation like at @xmath226 and the filled or open circles correspond to momenta with quasiparticles of infinite or finite lifetime , respectively .",
    "so , we may distinguish three qualitatively different kinds of spectral function @xmath227 behavior :    \\(i ) the lowest peak tends to a delta function @xmath228 $ ] , when @xmath229 ( see fig.4(a ) ) .",

    "these @xmath15 * -*points are marked by stars .    in order to understand the nature of the polaron damping ( @xmath239 in ( [ lor ] ) ) , let us consider a particular @xmath15-value and estimate the imaginary part of the self - energy at a particular @xmath238 . changing the summation variable in ( [ gineq1 ] ) we can calculate the imaginary part of the self - energy as follows @xmath240",
    "now we suppose that the lowest peak at all @xmath241 may be described approximately by lorentzian ( [ lor ] ) .",
    "then we see from eq .",
    "( [ damping ] ) that large damping , characterized by a large value of @xmath242 may only arise when the condition @xmath243 is satisfied for some values of @xmath244 ( see also ref . ) . on the contrary ,",
    "( [ cdam ] ) does not hold even at the lowest edge of the spectral function @xmath245 , the damping is absent . in fig.5",
    "we plot @xmath246 together with the curve @xmath247 for various values of @xmath248 ( for @xmath39 and where we choose only one direction for both @xmath15 , and @xmath244 ) .",
    "we may see that for @xmath249 the condition ( [ cdam ] ) holds only for the trivial values @xmath250 and @xmath251 , where , however , the vertex @xmath252 vanishes .",
    "it demonstrates that it is impossible to scatter from @xmath234 into other states .",
    "the same situation occurs for some finite region of @xmath15 values around the band bottom .",
    "these are exactly those momenta with a quasiparticle of infinite lifetime .",
    "different is the situation for @xmath253 and @xmath254 where several nontrivial intersections take place .",
    "figure 6 shows the low energy part of the hole spectral density @xmath255 for @xmath15 along high symmetry directions .",
    "let us recall that the intensity of the lowest peak of @xmath256 is governed by two circumstances : the @xmath15-dependence of the mean field residue @xmath92 ( see eq .",
    "( [ ghp ] ) and the discussion about fig .  2 ) and the intensity of the lowest polaron peak of @xmath257 .",
    "one can clearly observe a well defined quasiparticle peak near the bottom of the spectrum at @xmath1 , everywhere along the line @xmath258-@xmath8 and also near to @xmath8 . at the @xmath2-point @xmath11 , there is no hole spectral density due to the vanishing residue for the hole green s function in the lowest mean field polaron band .",
    "at the same time one observes intensity at @xmath106 . a clear asymmetry of the peak intensity is seen along the diagonal of the bz .",
    "the abrupt drop of the peak intensity in the region @xmath1 -@xmath259 is related to the strong polaron damping there . in other words ,",
    "most of the mean field hole spectral weight ( @xmath260 in fig.2 ) goes into the incoherent part of the spectrum ( situated at higher energies ) due to the strong coupling of the polaron @xmath61 with spin excitations .",
    "an analogous behavior of the quasiparticle peak intensity was obtained in ref .   within a variational ansatz for the @xmath4-@xmath9 model .",
    "let us compare the results with those of the usual scba of spinless holes in the pure @xmath4-@xmath9 model .",
    "there , one finds quasiparticles with infinite lifetime and finite weight everywhere in @xmath15-space . additionally , the spectral function has the symmetry of the magnetic bz .",
    "introducing additional hopping terms ( corresponding to direct oxygen - oxygen hopping in the emery model ) leads to a scattering mechanism such that the upper parts of the spectrum loose their quasiparticle character .",
    "@xcite on the contrary , in our approach , the damping of the spin polaron is already present without direct oxygen - oxygen hopping .",
    "if we consider only the dispersion relation @xmath261 we observe a remarkable similarity between the present calculation and earlier results using the scba of spinless holes or other methods .",
    "in fact , the deviations from the magnetic bz symmetry in fig .  1 are not very large . on the other hand ,",
    "we find some qualitatively new features of the spectral function which are absent in the numerical results of refs .  .",
    "besides the strong polaron scattering away from the band bottom we note especially : ( i ) the absence of the polaron quasiparticle at the @xmath94 -point and ( ii ) the asymmetry of the peak intensity with respect to the magnetic bz .    our results ( fig .",
    "6 ) can also be summarized in such a way that a well pronounced polaron quasiparticle peak exists only around the bottom of the band . in the direction @xmath262-@xmath263 it",
    "is more clearly seen than perpendicular to it .",
    "the recent experimental finding @xcite shows , indeed , that the zhang - rice singlet can be observed in sr@xmath0cuo@xmath0cl @xmath0 only in a similar region of the bz . and",
    "also the higher peak intensity going from @xmath262 to the @xmath94 -point in comparison with the opposite direction is in agreement with experiment .",
    "so we see that those details in which our calculation differs from the standard one @xcite are essential for a better understanding of the experiment .",
    "let us emphasize that for a detailed comparison to a real experiment there are a considerable number of complications which have not been taken into account in the present work : first , in general a photohole can be generated also on copper , and there will be ( in general @xmath15-dependent ) interference between the photoholes created on different atoms .",
    "an operator @xmath264 ( [ sw ] ) that enters the spin - fermion hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) creates a hole in a state that is an antibonding ( in hole notation ) combination of oxygen @xmath265 state and singly occupied copper @xmath45 state at adjacent sites . in a more realistic theory one should deal with a complete set of bare oxygen and copper hole creation operators",
    "this may be expected to have some influence on the spectral weight .",
    "next , one must take into account interference terms like @xmath266 , because the photoemission operator is in general a linear combination of @xmath267 and @xmath268 .",
    "thereby the relative phase between @xmath269 and @xmath268 depends on the momentum transfer , and is in general even different whether one is in the 1st or 2nd brillouin zone etc .",
    "clearly this will give additional momentum dependence of the weight .",
    "moreover , it is not even a priori clear that @xmath269 and @xmath268 have equal weight in the pes - operator .",
    "rather this depends in a relatively complicated way , e.g. , on the polarization of the incoming x - ray photons .",
    "it is in fact well known experimentally that the spectra depend quite sensitively on the x - ray polarization in several oxychlorides like sr@xmath0cuo@xmath0cl@xmath0 or ba@xmath0cu@xmath270o@xmath88cl@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite at the present stage of many - body theory it is impossible to take all these complications into account .",
    "thus , our comparison with experiment has only qualitative character .",
    "nevertheless , we point out that according to our results , many features of the experimental spectra may originate from the peculiarities of the correlated ground state of the material rather than from the above complications .",
    "we may consider now what happens if we begin to dope our system .",
    "first , we suppose that for extremely small doping the fermi surface will consists of hole pockets centered at @xmath271 .",
    "the small spectral weight of the quasiparticle poles in this region means that the surface enclosed inside the fermi surface may be much larger than the number of holes .",
    "note that due to the strong weight asymmetry the experimental observation of the fermi surface parts facing m point with @xmath272 point may be very hard to do . in ref .",
    "the observation of weak features in photoemission spectra in this region of @xmath15-space was reported , but the authors can not unambiguously interpret them as fermi surface cuts . with the increase of doped holes",
    "the antiferromagnetic correlations in the spin subsystem are weakened resulting in a deformation of the hole dispersion .",
    "@xcite the minimum of the hole spectrum should shift to the m point and a large fermi surface develops .",
    "an analogous scenario was also developed in ref .  .",
    "we proposed a new method to calculate the spectral function of the emery model in its spin - fermion form combining the mori - zwanzig projection method with a representation of the self - energy by irreducible gf .",
    "self - energy effects reduce the mean field bandwidth of the spin polaron to a realistic bandwidth of the order of @xmath273 , but do not change the overall shape of the dispersion .",
    "direct oxygen - oxygen hopping leads to a more isotropic band minimum around @xmath262 .",
    "the quasiparticle weight is maximal ( about 0.25 ) around the minimum of the dispersion . despite some similarities",
    ", we observed several new features of the spectral function which are not present in the usual scba @xcite for spinless holes coupled to spinons in the pure @xmath4-@xmath9 model , namely the absence of quasiparticle weight at the @xmath94 point , the strong damping away from the minimum and the asymmetry with respect to the antiferromagnetic bz ( where the asymmetry is present , however , in other approaches to the @xmath4-@xmath9 model ) @xcite .",
    "qualitatively , these features can be observed in the arpes experiments on sr@xmath0cuo@xmath0cl@xmath0 .",
