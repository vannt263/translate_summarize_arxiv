    "for almost half a century , the dc squid ( superconducting quantum interference device ) has enabled a broad range of devices , including magnetometers , gradiometers , voltmeters , susceptometers and amplifiers @xcite .",
    "most of these devices are used at relatively low frequencies , and all have the common feature of offering extremely low noise @xcite . the fact that the dc squid is potentially a quantum - limited amplifier in the microwave regime",
    "was recognized long ago @xcite , but not exploited in practice until the axion dark matter experiment ( admx ) provided a powerful motivation @xcite .",
    "this need led to the development of the microstrip squid amplifier ( msa ) in which the input coil deposited on ( but insulated from ) the washer of a squid acts as a resonant microstrip @xcite .",
    "such amplifiers have achieved a noise temperature within a factor of two of the standard quantum limit @xcite .",
    "more recently , new designs have appeared intended to extend the frequency of operation to frequencies as high as 10 ghz , aimed at the readout of superconducting qubits @xcite and the detection of micromechanical motion @xcite .",
    "these include incorporation of a gradiometric squid at the end of a quarter wave resonator @xcite and the direct injection of the microwave signal from a quarter wave resonator into one arm of the squid ring @xcite .",
    "besides having desirable properties such as high gain , wide bandwidth and near quantum - limited operation , microwave squid amplifiers ( mwsas)unlike conventional josephson parametric amplifiers @xcite  also offer an intrinsic separation of input and output channels of the signal that makes them unique among amplifiers based on josephson tunnel junctions .",
    "this property makes them especially well suited as a preamplifier in the measurement chain for superconducting devices by eliminating the need for channel separation devices , such as circulators and isolators , between the sample under test and the first amplification stage . although microwave squid amplifiers have been successfully used experimentally , questions pertaining to their nonlinear dynamics and ultimate sensitivity as amplifiers have continued to remain challenging problems .",
    "previous theories include quantum langevin simulations @xcite and treatment of the squid as an interacting quantum point contact @xcite .",
    "the ultimate exploitation of the amplifier , however , requires a deeper understanding of its behavior at the josephson frequency and its harmonics . besides being valuable for practical considerations ,",
    "such understanding may help discern the cause of intrinsically nonreciprocal operation of the mwsa that has hitherto remained an open question .",
    "this concern is especially relevant to applications such as qubit readout where the amplifier backaction may prove to be the achilles heel . in this work ,",
    "we develop an ab - initio theoretical framework to understand the high frequency dynamics of the squid in detail .",
    "in addition to giving us crucial insights into the amplifying mechanism of the mwsa and its nonreciprocal response between the input and output signal channels , this approach enables us to calculate the experimentally relevant quantities such as available gain , added noise and directionality at operating frequencies of interest .",
    "we perform our analysis in the paradigm of input - output theory and employ the method of harmonic balance to study the driven dynamics of the device .",
    "the dc squid is biased in the voltage regime  in contrast to the usual josephson parametric amplifiers operated in the zero voltage state with the phase excursions of the josephson junction confined to a single cosine well  and has the dynamics of a particle sampling various wells of a two - dimensional tilted washboard @xcite .",
    "the input - output analysis thus needs to be generalized to take into account phase running evolution in this two - dimensional potential .",
    "our approach involves a self - consistent determination of the working point of the device established by static bias parameters ( the static bias current @xmath0 and external flux @xmath1 shown in fig . [ fig1 ] ) followed by a study of the rf dynamics using a perturbative series expansion around this working point . in sec .",

    "the input transformer , however , is an experimental artifact required to ensure the impedance matching with the input impedance of the squid at a desired frequency .",
    "it is not crucial from the point of view of device characteristics , however , as it is the squid which provides amplification and all the relevant nonlinear dynamics of the device . in the ensuing analysis",
    "we do not employ a separate input port , but rather consider a direct input coupling through the differential mode of the ring which couples to the flux in an analogous manner [ fig . [",

    "moreover , the optimum bias point for minimum noise corresponds to the bias for maximum scattering gain [ fig .",
    "[ figscatt](c ) ] rather than for the maximum power gain [ fig .",
    "[ figgp](a ) ] .",
    "this result , previously found both theoretically and experimentally @xcite , follows from the fact that the added noise is a property of the bare squid without any matching to input and output loads . in the case of conventional parametric amplifiers ,",
    "the minimum noise indeed occurs at the maximum scattering gain .",
    "furthermore , the partial cross - correlation between the output voltage noise across the squid and the supercurrent noise circulating in the loop is crucial to minimizing the noise in both thermal and quantum regimes .",
    "we also note that , for sufficiently low signal frequencies , the calculated added noise number is found to saturate at a value slightly below the quantum limit of one half - photon at the signal frequency .",
    "this result , we suspect , is due to the fact that at the bias for minimum noise , the reverse gain is substantial and hence the isolation is not perfect ( fig .",
    "[ figisolation ] ) .",
    "the quantum limit of one half - photon is a limiting value calculated for ideal detectors with zero reverse gain and high forward gain @xcite , a condition which is not satisfied at the optimal noise bias in our calculation .",
    "finally , our calculation shows that the minimum noise number is achieved only when the signal frequency is much lower than the characteristic josephson frequency @xmath148 , and increases significantly with increasing signal frequency .",
    "in summary , we have developed a new method based on input - output theory to provide a first - principles analysis of the microwave squid amplifier ( mwsa ) . in this paradigm",
    "we treat the squid biased in its running state as a parametric amplifier pumped by a combination of josephson harmonics generated internally by the motion of the phase of the junctions .",
    "this approach leads to a fully self - consistent description of both the static and rf dynamics of the device .",
    "the scattering matrix calculation shows that the nonreciprocal gain of the amplifier arises from mixing processes involving higher josephson harmonics which implement an asymmetric frequency conversion scheme involving upconversion to and subsequent downconversion from the josephson frequency .",
    "we find that the power gain of the matched squid amplifier decreases quadratically with signal frequency @xmath42 ; by comparison , the gain in the usual squid operation with a matched input coil scales as @xmath149 @xcite .",
    "however , a recently reported dc squid amplifier @xcite using the direct coupling method considered in this paper demonstrated that the power gain scaled as @xmath150 at a frequency of a few ghz and a bandwidth of several hundred mhz .",
    "our analysis shows that the mwsa achieves quantum - limited noise performance for optimal flux and current biases , and for signal frequencies significantly lower than the characteristic josephson frequency @xmath151 . the added noise increases significantly with increasing frequency .",
    "this problem can be alleviated by using junctions with higher values of critical currents . with the present technology for niobium junctions , critical current densities of tens of microamperes per square micron",
    "are readily achievable .",
    "this translates into characteristic frequencies of about 100 ghz , which should be sufficient to achieve lower noise at ghz frequencies provided hot electron effects due to dissipation in the shunts are mitigated @xcite .",
    "furthermore , our analysis shows that simultaneous optimization of gain , directionality and noise is a delicate operation since the optimal biases for these three properties do not coincide .",
    "based on our calculation , at the working point for minimum added noise , @xmath152 , power gains of @xmath153 db and directionality of around @xmath154 db are obtained . however , higher power gains of @xmath155 db and directionality of @xmath156 db can be realized by permitting a higher noise number @xmath157 .",
    "though the predicted directionality is still modest , it suffices to reduce the number of nonreciprocal elements ( circulators , isolators ) in the measurement chain typically employed for the readout of superconducting qubits .",
    "moreover , the noise penalty incurred with mwsas compares very well to standard cryogenic amplifiers such as hemts whose typical noise numbers lie in the range @xmath158 for microwave frequencies .",
    "although the results presented in this paper are semi - quantitative we believe that extension of the analysis to higher orders , in conjunction with numerical optimization techniques , can be a useful tool to analyze squid - based devices due to rapid convergence offered by the harmonic series method .",
    "this approach would allow one to evaluate the appropriate parameters , depending on the intended application , that yield the best compromise between gain and noise properties .",
