    "the properties of neutrinos attract a strong attention since neutrinos alone are the elementary particles showing the evidence of new physics beyond the standard model . in particular",
    ", recent experiments of the superkamiokande ( sk ) detector @xcite and the sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno ) @xcite have shown that neutrino have non - zero mass and mixing angles by solar @xcite and atmospheric @xcite neutrino data .",
    "these neutrino oscillation experiments enable us to constrain the squared mass difference between mass eigenstates and mixing angles .",
    "the solar neutrino experiments strongly support the matter - induced large mixing angle ( lma ) solution ( @xmath4 @xcite ) and the atmospheric neutrino experiments have proved that @xmath5 and @xmath6 are maximally mixing ( @xmath7 @xcite ) .",
    "however , there are several parameters which are not sufficiently constrained .",
    "one such parameter is @xmath8 , for which only upper bound is known from reactor experiment @xcite ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "in addition , the nature of neutrino mass hierarchy ( normal or inverted ) is also matter of controversy .",
    "there is another astrophysical source of neutrinos , or supernova .",
    "neutrino burst from the next galactic core - collapse supernova will be captured by the present underground detectors , such as sk and sno .",
    "it is widely believed that the detected events will provide rich information not only on the mechanism of supernovae but also on the physical properties of neutrinos themselves .",
    "in fact , neutrino signals from sn1987a which were detected by the kamiokande @xcite and imb @xcite detectors permitted many discussions about the fundamental properties of neutrinos @xcite , although the detected event numbers were quite small ( 11 for kamiokande , 8 for imb ) .",
    "what we can learn from the next galactic supernova is considered in many articles ( for a review , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for example",
    ", we can constrain the properties of neutrino oscillation such as @xmath8 and the mass hierarchy @xcite .",
    "in addition to neutrino mass , non - zero magnetic moment is another nature of neutrinos beyond the standard model .",
    "the most stringent upper bound of the neutrino magnetic moment is obtained from cooling argument : any new physics that would enhance the neutrino diffusion , such that the cooling time drops below the observed duration , must be excluded .",
    "the recently revised upper bound is @xmath10 @xcite , where @xmath11 is the bohr magneton .",
    "the above value is several orders of magnitude more stringent than the existing limit from reactor @xcite and solar neutrino experiments @xcite , and comparable to the bound from globular cluster red giant cooling arguments @xcite , which give @xmath12 . on the other hand , from the minimally - extended standard model calculation",
    ", we obtain @xmath13 , which is many orders of magnitude smaller than the current experimental upper bounds .",
    "however , some particle physics models have been proposed to induce a larger magnetic moment of order @xmath14 @xcite , which is comparable to the current upper bounds .",
    "if neutrinos have the non - zero magnetic moment , it leads to precession between left- and right - handed neutrinos in sufficiently strong magnetic fields expected in the inner region of the core - collapse supernova @xcite . in general ,",
    "non - diagonal elements of the magnetic moment matrix are possible and neutrinos can be changed into different flavors and chiralities @xcite . furthermore , with the additional effect of the coherent forward scattering by matter , neutrinos can be resonantly converted into those with different chiralities @xcite by a mechanism similar to the well known mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) effect @xcite .",
    "this resonant spin - flavor ( rsf ) conversion induced by the neutrino magnetic moment in the supernova has been studied by many authors @xcite .",
    "almost all these earlier publications considered the rsf conversions between two - flavor neutrinos ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "however , since all three - flavor neutrinos and anti - neutrinos are emitted from the supernova core , we should calculate conversion probabilities using three - flavor formulation to obtain the spectrum of the neutrinos in the detectors .",
    "fortunately , our knowledge of the neutrino mixing parameters permits the three - flavor analyses , which have not been considered because of many unknown parameters in those days .    in this paper",
    ", we study the rsf effect in detail , including three flavor neutrinos and anti - neutrinos .",
    "particularly , a new crossing diagram , which deals with both msw and rsf effects , is given . from the diagram",
    ", we find that the combination of the msw and the rsf effects makes crossing schemes very interesting to investigate , and the expected flux would be different from that obtained in the case of pure msw or pure rsf effect .",
    "in addition , we calculate numerically the conversion probabilities of neutrinos and anti - neutrinos in the supernova using three - flavor formulation . in the calculations ,",
    "we adopt the latest neutrino mixing parameters , which are constrained by the solar and the atmospheric neutrino experiments , and assume the normal mass hierarchy .",
    "however , there are two unknown parameters of neutrinos , @xmath16 and @xmath8 . , and magnetic field .",
    "we give in section [ sec : models ] the adopted properties in our calculation .",
    "] for @xmath16 , we assume the value @xmath17 , ( see section [ sec : formulation ] ) , the results would also apply to any other value of @xmath16 provided that the supernova magnetic field strength is rescaled accordingly . ] and for @xmath8 , two large and small values ( @xmath18 ) . using the calculated conversion probabilities ,",
    "we give the expected energy spectra at sk and sno detectors , which show various behaviors as we change the value of @xmath19 .",
    "finally , we discuss the model uncertainties and how to obtain the implication for the value of neutrino magnetic moment from the obtained energy spectra .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : formulation ] , we give the formulation used in our calculation , which includes all three flavor neutrinos and anti - neutrinos . in section [ sec : models ] , the neutrino oscillation models and supernova models ( original neutrino spectrum , density , @xmath20 , and magnetic field profiles ) considered in this paper are illustrated and their validity is also discussed . in section [ sec :",
    "level crossing schemes and qualitative illustrations ] , we give a new crossing diagram , with which qualitative discussions concerning neutrino conversions in supernova matter become possible . the numerically calculated conversion probabilities and energy spectra at sk and sno are shown in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "finally , detailed discussions on model uncertainties and how to obtain the implication for neutrino magnetic moment are presented in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "the interaction of the magnetic moment of neutrinos and magnetic fields is described by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the component of the neutrino magnetic moment matrix , @xmath23 the magnetic field transverse to the direction of propagation , @xmath24 and @xmath25 the right- and left - handed neutrinos , respectively , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 denote the flavor eigenstate of neutrinos , i.e. , @xmath28 and @xmath29",
    ". if neutrinos are the dirac particles , right - handed neutrinos and left - handed anti - neutrinos are undetectable ( sterile neutrinos ) , since they do not interact with matter .",
    "the spin - flavor conversion into these sterile neutrinos suffers strong constraints from observation of neutrinos from sn1987a @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if neutrinos are the majorana particles , @xmath30 s are identical to anti - particles of @xmath31 s and interact with matter , and the constraint above becomes considerably weak . in this paper , we assume that neutrinos are majorana particles .",
    "the diagonal magnetic moments is forbidden for the majorana neutrinos , and therefore , only the conversion between different flavors is possible , e.g. , @xmath32 .",
    "the coherent forward scattering with matter induces the effective potential for neutrinos , which is calculated using weak interaction theory . the effective potential due to scattering with electrons is given as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is electron number density , @xmath35 the fermi coupling constant , and @xmath36 the weinberg angle .",
    "the @xmath37 sign in front refers to @xmath38 and @xmath39 and that in the parentheses to @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the difference between @xmath42 and @xmath43 neutrinos comes from the existence of charged - current interaction .",
    "the subscript @xmath44 of @xmath45 refers to the first and the second @xmath37 sign .",
    "the ordinary msw effect between @xmath46 and @xmath47 is caused by the potential difference , @xmath48 .",
    "to include the rsf effect , which causes the conversion between neutrinos and anti - neutrinos , we should take into account the neutral - current scattering by nucleons : @xmath49 where @xmath50 are proton and neutron number density , respectively .",
    "for neutrinos we add @xmath51 to the potential and for anti - neutrinos @xmath52 .",
    "therefore , the rsf conversion between @xmath53 and @xmath47 obeys the potential difference @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the density , @xmath56 the nucleon mass , and @xmath57 is the number of electrons per baryon .",
    "( when we obtain eq .",
    "( [ eq : delta v ] ) , we assumed charge neutrality @xmath58 . )      in this subsection , we give the simplest formulation between @xmath53 and @xmath5 , and consider the properties of the rsf conversion .",
    "the time evolution of the mixed state of @xmath53 and @xmath5 is described by the schrdinger equation @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the radius from the center of the star , @xmath62 the transition magnetic moment , and @xmath63 is defined by @xmath64 the resonance occurs when @xmath65 , thus , the necessary condition is @xmath66 .",
    "( if @xmath67 , the @xmath68 conversion occurs conversely , at almost the same place . )",
    "several earlier authors @xcite pointed out that the rsf conversion occurs quite efficiently in the region above the iron core and below the hydrogen envelope of collapsing stars , namely , in the `` isotopically neutral region '' ( o+si , o+ne+mg , o+c , and he layers ) , in which the value of @xmath20 is slightly less than 0.5 [ typically , @xmath69 .",
    "actually , the pre - supernova model used in our calculation have the similar profile , as is shown in section [ sub : supernova progenitor model ] .    when the resonance is adiabatic ( or when the density is slowly changing at that point and the magnetic field is strong enough ) , the significant conversion occurs .",
    "the adiabaticity of the rsf conversion can be derived by the same argument used in the case of the msw conversion @xcite .",
    "it is given by @xmath70 where the subscript `` res '' means that the value is evaluated at the resonance point .",
    "therefore , if the magnetic field is sufficiently strong at the resonance point , the @xmath15 conversion occurs completely .    at the end of this subsection",
    ", we discuss the possibility that @xmath71 conversion occurs in solar magnetic field .",
    "there are several works examining the rsf conversion as a solution to the solar neutrino problem @xcite . in this paper , however , we postulate that the solution to the solar neutrino problem is given by the ordinary msw effect ( lma solution ) .",
    "in fact , if we take the mixing parameters of lma ( @xmath72 ) in calculating the rsf resonance condition @xmath73 , the required density is found to be larger than the central density of the sun .",
    "( in this calculation , the sign of @xmath74 is changed in eq .",
    "( [ eq : delta h ] ) , since @xmath67 in the sun .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath75 conversion . )      here , we present the three - flavor ( six - component ) formulation of neutrino mixing by @xmath76 where @xmath77    @xmath78    @xmath79    and @xmath80 .",
    "( we assume cp phase @xmath81 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : u ] ) for simplicity . )",
    "the resonant flavor conversion occurs when the two diagonal elements in matrix in eq .",
    "( [ eq : three - flavor ] ) have the same value .",
    "there are five such resonance points , which are for @xmath82 ( msw - l ) , @xmath83 ( msw - h ) , @xmath15 ( rsf - l ) , @xmath84 ( rsf - h ) , and @xmath85 conversions .",
    "suffixes `` -l '' and `` -h '' attached to `` msw '' and `` rsf '' indicate whether the density at the resonance points are lower or higher .",
    "hereafter , we neglect @xmath86 conversion , since it is always nonadiabatic as well as including this makes discussion further complicated .",
    "we adopt the neutrino mixing parameters introduced to explain the observations of the solar and the atmospheric neutrino experiments @xcite , and assume the normal mass hierarchy . from the atmospheric neutrino experiments , we use the values @xcite @xmath87 and from the solar neutrino experiments @xcite ,",
    "@xmath88 in our calculations . for @xmath8 ,",
    "which is not sufficiently constrained , we adopt two large and small values , @xmath89 where each value causes the adiabatic and nonadiabatic msw - h conversions , respectively .    as for neutrino magnetic moment , there are three transition moments for majorana neutrino ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : magnetic moment ] ) ) .",
    "we assume that all of them are near the present upper bound ( i.e. , @xmath90 ) .",
    "however , as we will show in section [ sub : supernova magnetic field ] , @xmath91 alone governs results .",
    "we use a realistic model of a collapse - driven supernova by the lawrence livermore group @xcite to calculate the neutrino energy spectrum at production .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : fluence ] the time - integrated energy spectra of neutrinos ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for detail ) , where the distance to the supernova is set to 10 kpc .",
    "( for discussions from here , we adopt this assumption , @xmath92 . )",
    "both the flux integrated over entire time during neutrino burst and that integrated until 0.5 seconds after core bounce are shown in the same figure .",
    "although the neutrino burst persists @xmath93 10 seconds , about half of neutrinos are emitted by 0.5 seconds , according to numerical simulation by lawrence livermore group @xcite .",
    "the reason for using time integrated flux until 0.5 seconds is given in the next subsection .",
    "the mean energies are different between flavors : @xmath94 for fully time - integrated spectrum , while for that integrated until 0.5 seconds , @xmath95 this hierarchy of mean energies is explained as follows .",
    "since @xmath96 s interact with matter only through the neutral - current reactions in supernova , they are weakly coupled with matter compared to @xmath46 s and @xmath53 s .",
    "thus the neutrino sphere of @xmath96 s is deeper in the core than that of @xmath46 s and @xmath53 s , which leads to higher temperatures for @xmath96 s .",
    "the difference between @xmath46 s and @xmath53 s comes from that the core is neutron rich and @xmath46 s couples with matter more strongly , through @xmath97 reactions .",
    "we use the precollapse model of massive stars of woosley and weaver @xcite .",
    "the progenitor mass was set to be @xmath98 , and the metalicity the same as that of the sun .",
    "the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : profiles ] shows @xmath99 and @xmath100 profiles of this progenitor model . in the same figure",
    ", we also show @xmath101 and @xmath102 . at intersections between @xmath103 and @xmath104 ,",
    "the rsf and msw conversions occur ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : delta h ] ) ) .",
    "however , in fact , since the density profile changes drastically during neutrino burst ( @xmath105 sec ) owing to shock propagation , we can not use the static progenitor model when calculating the conversion probability in supernova @xcite .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : shock ] the _ time - dependent _ @xmath106 and @xmath99 profile calculated by lawrence livermore group @xcite , compared with the static model adopted in our calculation @xcite . from the figure , the shock wave changes the @xmath106 profile in the resonance region , which is responsible for rsf conversions , at @xmath107 seconds after bounce , while that at @xmath108 seconds is almost the same as the static progenitor model .",
    "thus , from here , we confine our discussion until 0.5 seconds after core bounce , since in that case , using the static progenitor model is considered to be a good approximation . calculating for full time - scale during neutrino burst with the time - dependent density and @xmath20 profiles makes discussion very complicated , and it is out of scope of this study , while it will be our future work .",
    "we assume that the global structure of the magnetic field is a dipole moment and the field strength is normalized at the surface of the iron core with the value of @xmath109 gauss .",
    "the reason for this normalization is as follows . as pointed out by totani and sato @xcite , the global magnetic field normalized at the surface of the newly born neutron star , such as used in ref .",
    "@xcite , is not a good assumption .",
    "it is because that the magnetic fields of a nascent neutron star are hard to affect the far outer region , such as the isotopically neutral region , within the short time scale of neutrino burst .",
    "the magnetic fields , therefore , should be normalized by the fields which are static and existent before the core collapse . in addition , as discussed in the previous subsection , since the shock wave does not affect the resonance region at @xmath108 seconds after bounce , it is also expected that the magnetic field strength at the resonance points is not seriously changed at that time .",
    "the strength of such magnetic fields above the surface of the iron core may be inferred from the observation of the surface of white dwarfs , since both are sustained against the gravitational collapse by the degenerate pressure of electrons .",
    "the observations of the magnetic fields in white dwarfs show that the strength spreads in a wide range of @xmath110 gauss @xcite . taking account of the possibility of the decay of magnetic fields in white dwarfs , it is not unnatural to consider the magnetic fields up to @xmath111 gauss at the surface of the iron core . then , in eq .",

    "hereafter , we assume @xmath115 .    from the magnetic field , density , and",
    "@xmath20 profiles of supernova we can calculate the adiabaticity parameter of each resonance points with eq .",
    "( [ eq : adiabaticity ] ) .",

    ", we see that the rsf - h conversion can be adiabatic when the @xmath119 , while the rsf - l conversion is always nonadiabatic under any conditions considered here",
    ". therefore , the values of transition magnetic moment @xmath120 do not matter , while that of @xmath91 alone governs results .",
    "from the formulation which includes three - flavor neutrinos and anti - neutrinos ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : three - flavor ] ) ) , we give a new level crossing diagram , which is an expanded version of the ordinary diagram including msw resonance alone ( see fig . 5 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . we show it in fig .",
    "[ fig : crossing ] , in which the adiabatic conversion means that the neutrinos trace the solid curve at each resonance point ( i.e. , the mass eigenstate does not flip ) , while the nonadiabatic conversion the dotted line .",
    "the figure clearly includes not only ordinary msw resonances but also the rsf effects , and it is expected that the combination effect of msw and rsf makes this scheme very interesting to investigate . from the earlier publications on the msw effect , we know",
    "that the msw - l is adiabatic for lma solution , and msw - h is adiabatic for large @xmath8 and nonadiabatic for small @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the adiabaticity of the rsf - l and rsf - h depends on the magnetic field strength and the density profile at the resonance point ( see eq .",

    "[ fig : profiles ] .    here",
    ", we qualitatively consider the flavor transition of neutrinos under some simple conditions . at the supernova core , electron neutrinos and anti - neutrinos",
    "are produced as the mass eigenstate in matter , owing to large matter potential .",

    "figure [ fig : spectra_sno_s ] is the same one as fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra_sno_l ] , but for the different value of @xmath8 ( @xmath144 ) . for larger @xmath2 ,",
    "the spectrum of the total events becomes harder , while that of ( total@xmath167 ) events changes little ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : f_e_na_na ] ) , ( [ eq : f_ebar_na_na ] ) , ( [ eq : f_e_na_a ] ) , and ( [ eq : f_ebar_na_a ] ) ) .",
    "in this study , we used the original neutrino spectrum calculated by lawrence livermore group @xcite . unfortunately",
    ", their study as well as the other published full numerical supernova collapse simulations have not yet included the nucleon bremsstrahlung process or nucleon recoils , even though it is no longer controversial that these effects are important .",
    "recent studies ( e.g. @xcite ) including all these processes have shown that average @xmath96 energy exceeds the average @xmath53 energy by only a small amount , 10% being a typical number .",
    "if this is the case , the spectral deformation , particularly at sk detector , will be little and it is difficult to obtain some information on the flavor conversion mechanism in supernova .",
    "however , it is premature to conclude that their results are correct , since it is based on the neutrino transport study on the background of an assumed neutron star atmosphere , and this approach lacks hydro - dynamical self - consistency .",
    "further it is also because the mean energies and their ratios change significantly between the supernova bounce , accretion phase , and the later neutron star cooling phase .",
    "thus , at present , even if the galactic supernova neutrino burst were detected by sk and sno , it would be very difficult to obtain useful information on whether the rsf effect actually occurs in supernova and to obtain implication for neutrino magnetic moment , owing to large uncertainties concerning original neutrino spectrum .",
    "in the future , however , it might be plausible that these uncertainties will be removed by development of numerical simulations , and the signal of supernova neutrino burst would provide valuable implications for the flavor conversion mechanisms . in discussions from here ,",
    "we present the method to probe conversion mechanisms from the detected neutrino signals , _ assuming _ that the uncertainties concerning the supernova models are considerably reduced by the future development of numerical approaches .      as we have shown in section [ sec : results ] , the deformation of spectral shape occurs when @xmath157 .",
    "therefore the ratio of high energy events to low energy ones is a good measure to investigate the magnetic field strength in supernova or neutrino magnetic moment .",
    "we adopted as that two quantities below : @xmath169    figure [ fig : ratio_sk ] shows @xmath170 as a function of @xmath171 for @xmath165 , where error bars include only statistical errors .",
    "( here , we re - introduce the angular factor @xmath172 since we also discuss the dependence on magnetic field orientation below . )",
    "we obtained almost the same figure for @xmath144 .",
    "therefore , sk data will provide statistically sufficient information on the magnetic field strength in the supernova and neutrino magnetic moment , and these consequences are independent of @xmath8 .",
    "for example , the value of @xmath170 which is found to be larger than @xmath173 indicates that the rsf conversion occurred in the supernova , and we can constrain the value of @xmath174 assuming the supernova and presupernova models .    the same figure for sno is fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio_sno ] , where the upper panel ( a ) is for @xmath165 and the lower panel ( b ) for @xmath144 .",
    "if we obtain @xmath175 which is larger than @xmath176 , it suggests that the supernova magnetic field is quite strong , @xmath177 , and neutrinos have non - zero magnetic moment .",
    "however , since the statistical errors of @xmath178 are rather large because of smallness of data , we can use the sno data to confirm the sk result .",
    "in addition , if we know the value of the angular factor @xmath172 from the optical observation such as the hubble space telescope ( hst ) , we can constrain the magnetic field strength @xmath2 ( not the combination @xmath171 ) from the neutrino observation .",
    "actually , in the case of sn1987a , which occurred in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , @xmath114 is constrained with the procedure as follows .",
    "the hst images of sn1987a show a bright elliptical ring surrounding the optical remnant . this inner ring has been interpreted as a ring of high - density material in the equatorial plane of the progenitor , caused by the impact of the high velocity stellar wind of the blue supergiant progenitor with its earlier , slower red giant wind , and ionized by the uv flash from the supernova explosion @xcite .",
    "the inner ring is known to be inclined to the line of sight by @xmath179 . thus , assuming that the magnetic dipole moment of the star orient to the rotation axis , we can constrain @xmath172 to be @xmath180 from the hst observation . however",
    ", if the next supernova occurred in the galactic center , it would be quite difficult to estimate @xmath114 since the galactic center is optically thick from the earth .",
    "on the other hand , if it occurred in the optically thin environment such as lmc , we would be able to constrain @xmath114 from optical observations and @xmath2 from the neutrino signals .",
    "although lmc is located at @xmath181 kpc away from the earth , sk data would permit statistically sufficient discussions on the supernova magnetic field .",
    "for example , in that case , the @xmath182 statistical errors of @xmath170 are as large as @xmath183 errors in the case of the galactic supernova ( @xmath184 ) , which are also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio_sk ] , and it will be sufficient to distinguish whether @xmath185 or @xmath186 .",
    "in addition to next galactic supernova , the observation of supernova relic neutrino ( srn ) background would be available to obtain information on flavor conversion mechanism in supernova .",
    "the flux of srn is calculated by @xmath187 where @xmath188 , @xmath189 is supernova rate per comoving volume at redshift @xmath190 , @xmath191 energy spectrum of emitted neutrinos , and @xmath192 the redshift when the gravitational collapses began ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for detailed discussion ) .",
    "most recently , sk collaboration set an upper bound of @xmath193 for the srn flux in the energy region @xmath194 mev @xcite .",
    "that limit is the same order as some typical theoretical predictions such as ref .",
    "for example , ando et al .",
    "@xcite predicted that the total srn flux integrated over entire energy was @xmath195 , while the corresponding sk limit calculated with the predicted spectral shape is @xmath196 .",
    "since the theoretical calculations contain many ambiguities such as the supernova rate in the universe and neutrino spectrum from each supernova , this severe observational srn limit can provide a number of valuable information on the various fields of astrophysics and cosmology .",
    "further , in the near future , it is expected that the upper limit will be much lower ( about factor 3 ) when the current sk data of 1,496 days are reanalyzed using some technique to reduce background against detection @xcite . in that case , the further severer constraint not only on the star formation history but also on the nature of neutrinos might be obtained .    since the rsf mechanism further enhances the average energy of @xmath53 compared to the ordinary msw effect , the current and the future expected upper limit on the srn flux might provide very useful information on that mechanism .",
    "however , in order to give precise srn prediction including the rsf mechanism , we must calculate conversion probability in supernova for full time - scale during the neutrino burst .",
    "therefore , the prediction is difficult at present stage , and it is also one of our future works .",
    "we investigated three - flavor neutrino oscillation with non - zero neutrino magnetic moment in supernova magnetic fields .",
    "we gave a new crossing diagram which includes not only ordinary msw resonance but also magnetically - induced rsf effect . from the diagram , it was found that there occurred four resonances , two were induced by the rsf effect and two by the pure msw . in addition , the qualitative behavior of neutrino conversions and expected neutrino spectrum at the detector were found to be well illustrated .",
    "we also numerically calculated conversion probability in the supernova to obtain the expected energy spectrum at the detector . in that calculation ,",
    "realistic neutrino mixing parameters inferred by recent neutrino oscillation experiments and realistic density and @xmath20 profiles of presupernova stars were adopted . as for magnetic field in the supernova , we assumed the dipole structure , and that the field strength was normalized at the surface of the iron core , which was inferred from the observations of white dwarfs .",
    "although the shock wave propagation changes density profile in the resonance region drastically and is also expected to change magnetic filed profile at the same region , we showed that if we confine our discussion until 0.5 seconds after core bounce , using static progenitor model and static magnetic field structure is expected to be a good approximation .",
    "as a result of numerical calculations , it was found that if the magnetic field at the surface of the iron core is sufficiently strong ( @xmath197 , where we assumed @xmath198 ) , the rsf - h conversion becomes adiabatic and complete @xmath84 conversion occurs .",
    "hence , non - zero neutrino magnetic moment with the strong magnetic field enhances the energies of @xmath53 and hardens the energy spectrum at sk and sno .",
    "thus , in the future , if the uncertainty concerning original neutrino spectrum is removed by development of numerical simulations for supernova explosions , we might be able to obtain information on neutrino magnetic moment as well as the magnetic field strength in supernova using the energy spectrum at detectors .",
    "in addition , it could be also plausible using the current and the future supernova relic neutrino observations .",
