    "dlcq ( discretized light - cone quantization)@xcite is a suggested computational procedure in which one specifies quantization conditions on the characteristic surface @xmath1 , introduces periodicity conditions to induce a discrete basis , truncates the basis set by some procedure to produce a finite matrix , then takes the spectrum and eigenvectors of that matrix as an approximation to the physical spectrum and wave functions .",
    "the difficulty is that , as always in quantum field theory , removing an infinite set of high ( bare ) energy states induces a renormalization of the operators",
    ". a completely consistent procedure for performing the truncation and renormalization has not yet been demonstrated , but the problem has received considerable study .",
    "some calculations have been published@xcite which simply use the periodicity conditions combined with a momentum cutoff .",
    "while the numerical results are accurate for superrenormalizable theories such as @xmath2-dimensional gauge theories , it is clear that such a procedure is problematical for renormalizable theories in @xmath0 dimensions .",
    "a systematic renormalization procedure has been proposed by wilson , perry and co - workers@xcite .",
    "these authors use a cutoff chosen for computational convenience and then try to find the mixing of the operators under renormalization using ideas of the wilson renormalization group .",
    "since the procedure makes no attempt to preserve the symmetries of the theory , one expects a great deal of mixing and many counterterms ; some skill in guessing the counterterms seems to be required .    in this paper we will suggest a procedure which lies somewhat closer to traditional ideas in field theory than the wilson plan in that we will make an attempt to preserve more of the symmetries of the theory ; but the objective is the same",
    "the idea is to add enough pauli ",
    "villars fields@xcite to the theory to regulate perturbation theory . having done that we hope that , since the theory is basically finite , the periodicity conditions and momentum cutoff will be sufficiently benign to allow a consistent renormalization to be performed . in the wilson language , we hope that the heavy fields will add the necessary counterterms automatically with no particular cleverness from us .    in the next section we consider the one - loop fermion self mass in yukawa theory @xcite . this problem has been considered previously in the literature@xcite , but we shall discuss the analysis in the context of using the pauli ",
    "villars program to preserve the discrete chiral symmetry of the theory .",
    "the computation requires three pauli  villars fields for proper regularization , including the elimination of all terms  including spurious finite terms  not proportional to the bare fermion mass squared .",
    "we then present and solve a model field theory very similar to the scalar field model studied in the 1950 s by greenberg and schweber@xcite .",
    "this model , which requires renormalization , allows us to illustrate the procedure and to examine some important numerical issues , at least within the context of the model .",
    "these issues include the number of states which must be devoted to the heavy fields and the related question of how heavy their masses must be .",
    "section  [ sec : dlcqapplied ] discusses the numerical solution of this same model and compares these results with the analytic solution .",
    "a final section contains our general conclusions .",
    "this is followed by two appendices that provide details of our light - cone conventions and of improved methods for accurate dlcq calculations .",
    "we consider yukawa theory defined by the action @xmath3.\\ ] ] for the problem of interest here , the @xmath4 interaction will not be needed .",

    "let us first consider regulating the integral with a momentum cutoff . while several possibilities might be considered , including a cutoff on @xmath13 alone , the most commonly used cutoffs couple @xmath14 and @xmath13 in some way . to retain boost invariance",
    "we will consider the `` invariant mass '' cutoff in which the total invariant mass of the intermediate state is limited@xcite .",
    "for the present case this rule gives @xmath15 this cutoff also appears if we simply limit the change in mass of the matrix elements of the interaction hamiltonian . for the integral",
    "we then get @xmath16 where @xmath17\\ , , \\nonumber \\\\ l&=&\\lambda^2x(1-x)-\\mu^2(1-x)-m^2x\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the integral can be done in closed form , but the result for arbitrary parameters is not terribly illuminating .",
    "if we take @xmath18 we get @xmath19\\ , . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] perhaps the most striking thing about this result is not so much that it is quadratically divergent as @xmath20 , but that it does not go to zero with @xmath21 .",
    "this is in contrast to the feynman result .",
    "in fact the vanishing of the self mass with vanishing bare mass is formally protected by the discrete chiral symmetry : @xmath22 with @xmath23 . that @xmath24 is not proportional to @xmath25 is due to the fact that the invariant mass regulator does not preserve this symmetry .",
    "it is well known that the four - dimensional feynman integral for the fermion self energy can be regulated by the addition of one pauli ",
    "villars boson field .",
    "if that is done the integral is then  finite \" by power counting and vanishes with @xmath21 .",
    "one might then think that if one first performs the @xmath26 integral one would get a finite three - dimensional light - cone integral . however , the feynman integral is only conditionally convergent , and therefore any value ascribed to it is a prescription .",
    "the standard integration procedure - symmetric integration in the spatial momenta with the @xmath27 integral done last - preserves the discrete chiral symmetry and thus leads to the vanishing of the result at @xmath28 .",
    "the terms in ( [ eq : iapprox ] ) which do not vanish as @xmath29 at large @xmath30 include terms quadratic in @xmath30 , logarithmic in @xmath30 , and independent of @xmath30",
    ". therefore three pauli  villars bosonic fields are necessary to render the light - cone integral consistent with discrete chiral symmetry .",
    "the entire light - cone integral ( [ eq : iapprox ] ) is then finite and vanishes as @xmath29 .",
    "thus we need three pauli  villars conditions : @xmath31 where the @xmath32 s and @xmath33 s are the coupling constants and masses of the heavy fields",
    ". the logarithmic divergent term @xmath34 in ( [ eq : iapprox ] ) returns if the masses of the heavy fields go to infinity , but the nonzero value at @xmath28 does not return .",
    "the fact that three pauli  villars fields are necessary to regulate the self - energy graph in the light - cone representation is an old result@xcite , and it has received considerable study in@xcite .",
    "one might wonder whether there is some feature of the theory from a purely equal - time perspective that would allow one to predict the number of heavy fields necessary to regulate the calculation in the light - cone representation .    to perform a dlcq calculation one must limit the range of the momenta ( which the @xmath30 cutoff does ) as well as",
    "make the momenta discrete by introducing periodicity conditions for the fields on the surface @xmath35 .",
    "we may take @xmath36 to be antiperiodic in @xmath37 and periodic in @xmath38 .",
    "( see appendix  [ sec : lccoordinates ] . )",
    "the scalar fields are taken to be periodic in both @xmath37 and @xmath38 . with the heavy fields and the momentum cutoff in place ,",
    "the only effect of the periodicity conditions on the above perturbation calculation is that the finite integral is then evaluated as a discrete sum .",
    "the convergence of the discrete sum to the continuum result is discussed below .",
    "the discussion in this section suggests a new general procedure for resolution of the uv divergences of light - cone hamiltonian field theory .",
    "the heavy fields will produce the counterterms necessary to make a consistent renormalization possible .",
    "what we propose is to test this procedure nonperturbatively , that is , include enough heavy fields in the lagrangian to regulate perturbation theory , then produce a finite matrix with a momentum cutoff and discretization .",
    "the periodicity conditions can also lead to constrained zero modes , as discussed in@xcite .",
    "another important advantage of the pauli  villars fields is that the terms from the constrained zero modes which would affect the one loop mass shift ( the most singular terms due to the constrained zero modes ) are zero at the level of @xmath5 . in the present paper we shall not attempt a full yukawa calculation .",
    "we shall illustrate the method for a soluble model and provide some discussion of numerical issues .        from the periodicity conditions in the light - cone box @xmath39 one obtains discrete momenta @xmath40 with @xmath41 even for bosons and odd for fermions .",
    "integrals are then replaced by discrete sums obtained as trapezoidal approximations on the grid of momentum values @xmath42 the limit @xmath43 can be exchanged for a limit in terms of the integer _",
    "resolution_@xcite @xmath44 .",
    "the longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath45 becomes @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath47 is independent of @xmath48 .",
    "because the longitudinal integers @xmath41 are always positive , dlcq automatically limits the number of particles to no more than @xmath49 .",
    "the integers @xmath50 and @xmath51 range between limits associated with some maximum integer @xmath52 fixed by @xmath53 and a cutoff that limits transverse momentum .",
    "the momentum - space continuum limit is reached when @xmath54 and @xmath52 become infinite .",
    "the transverse length scale @xmath53 is chosen such that @xmath55 is the largest transverse momentum allowed by the cutoff .",
    "the integrations for pauli  villars subtractions use the transverse scale @xmath53 determined for the physical boson .",
    "this insures use of a common grid that can easily represent momentum conservation in interactions .",
    "we then compute the dimensionless integral @xmath56 and the subtracted integral @xmath57 when the loop integrals are evaluated numerically , the proportion of error increases with each subtraction .",
    "once all three pauli  villars subtractions are done , the error can dominate .",
    "this is the case for an ordinary dlcq calculation .",
    "the individual integrals are large and therefore must be computed accurately for the differences to be accurate .",
    "it can be helpful to have well separated pauli  villars masses , because the coefficients @xmath32 are then @xmath58 and do not amplify the errors .",
    "the domain of integration , as defined by the invariant - mass cutoff , is not commensurate with the dlcq grid .",
    "this causes errors of two types : one is a truncation error where the edge of the domain is not properly counted and the other is the loss of rotational symmetry in the transverse grid . in one - dimensional cases , only the former type occurs . in that context , it is easily handled as part of an extrapolation in @xmath54 ; in the context of the three iterated integrals used for three dimensions , the error becomes much less controlled .",
    "if the trapezoidal rule is applied to each iterated integral , as is done in the standard dlcq approach , the errors will not follow a systematic dependence on the grid spacings for a reasonable number of grid points .",
    "this lack of systematic dependence on @xmath54 and @xmath52 can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : oneloopsecirc ] .    =    these errors could be overcome with a commensurate grid that uses polar coordinates in the transverse direction .",
    "this would not be easily extended to situations with more than two particles .",
    "also , it turns out that although a commensurate grid controls the errors in a systematic way , the errors are still large .",
    "other methods that use the dlcq grid have been found superior .    given the rectangular dlcq grid",
    ", one can improve on the simple application of the trapezoidal rule used in ( [ eq : rawdlcq ] ) .",
    "the alternative integration schemes @xcite are of the general form @xmath59 where , unlike the case of the trapezoidal rule , the weights @xmath60 will not all be equal .",
    "special formulas for intervals near the edge can be derived , and one can even consider variations on the higher - order simpson s rule .",
    "the transverse integrations can be treated in polar coordinates with a basis of circles of irregular radii chosen to pass through the points of the square grid .",
    "these methods provide results for integrals far better than ordinary dlcq , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : oneloopsecirc ] . a discussion of the details is given in appendix  [ sec : weightingmethods ] .",
    "the results for the momentum - space continuum limit of the discrete sums are obtained by extrapolations which use values of 20 , 22 , and 24 for @xmath54 and 25 through 30 for @xmath52 .",
    "all results are given in units of the boson mass @xmath61 .",
    "these are fit by least squares to either @xmath62 or @xmath63 .",
    "the latter is used for the @xmath64 integral .",
    "this means that at most 5 parameters are used in fits to 18 points .",
    "extrapolation to the continuum after subtraction is not as accurate as extrapolation of each integral separately .",
    "the subtraction of the discrete sums induces a greater variation in errors that is harder to fit properly .    the range in @xmath52 was selected to avoid values where the @xmath65 integral was badly approximated .",
    "however , here `` badly '' is to be interpreted relative to the desired final error of 0.02 , which is slightly more that 0.2% of the answer .",
    "values of the subtracted integral for different fermion masses @xmath21 are plotted as functions of @xmath66 in fig .",

    "each individual integral has been reduced to @xmath69 as measured against the analytic result at @xmath70 .",
    "this implies an error of @xmath71 in the subtracted result .",
    "extrapolation in @xmath72 induces additional uncertainty reflected in the miss by 0.06 of zero for @xmath70 .",
    "the ratios of the tabulated values are correct to within error estimates .",
    "the result for the subtracted integral is roughly proportional to @xmath25 , but for @xmath25 near @xmath73 or larger , terms even beyond @xmath74 appear important",

    "a listing of counts for two cases is given in table  [ tab : fockstates ] .",

    "we are sufficiently encouraged by the success of the pauli ",
    "villars program for the examples discussed here to believe that it will have general applicability to qcd in @xmath0 dimensions .",
    "this work was supported in part by the minnesota supercomputer institute through grants of computing time and by the department of energy .",
    "the hospitality of the telluride summer research center was also appreciated .",
    "we define light - cone coordinates@xcite by @xmath121 with the transverse coordinates @xmath122 unchanged .",
    "covariant four - vectors are written as  @xmath123 with the spacetime metric @xmath124 explicitly , @xmath125 we also make use of an underscore notation : for position - space variables we write @xmath126 while for momentum - space variables @xmath127 then @xmath128 spatial derivatives are defined by @xmath129 the gamma matrices @xmath130 satisfy the familiar relation @xmath131 with @xmath132 the light - cone metric .",
    "it is simple to verify that the ( hermitian ) matrices @xmath133 satisfy @xmath134 so that they serve as projectors on spinor space . in the dirac representation of the @xmath135-matrices : @xmath136 which has two eigenvectors , both with eigenvalue @xmath137 : @xmath138 these serve as a convenient spinor basis for the expansion of the field @xmath139 on the light cone .",
    "new weighting schemes have now been developed for use with the dlcq grid . they are based on extensions of the trapezoidal rule and simpson s rule to the situation where the integration domain does not end on a grid point ; they are also related to open newton",
    " cotes formulas .",
    "the basic approach is to derive formulas for one - dimensional integrals and then iterate them for higher - dimensional integrals @xcite .",
    "the extended trapezoidal rule is obtained from consideration of an integral from , say , @xmath140 to @xmath141 . the relevant graph is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : integrationrule ] .",
    "the grid points are at @xmath142 and @xmath143 , which are separated by a standard spacing @xmath144 .",
    "the other points are at the integration domain boundaries at distances of @xmath145 and @xmath146 from the grid points .",
    "the integral of a function @xmath147 is then approximated by @xmath148 with @xmath149 the coefficients @xmath150 are chosen to provide exact results for linear functions .",
    "the standard trapezoidal rule is recovered when @xmath151 . if @xmath152 , a standard open newton - cotes formula results . when the extended rule is combined with the standard rule for interior intervals ,",
    "a general composite rule is obtained .",
    "the extended rule is then used twice , once at each end , with @xmath146 or @xmath145 set to zero .",
    "the extended simpson s rule follows from similar steps .",
    "two forms are needed , one for three grid points and another for four .",
    "any situation with more grid points can be handled with a composite rule obtained by combining these rules with the standard simpson s rule .",
    "for the three - point case , consider an integral from @xmath140 to @xmath153 , with grid points at @xmath142 , @xmath143 , and @xmath141 .",
    "the regular grid spacing is @xmath144 ; the extra points at the beginning and end are separated by @xmath145 and @xmath146 , respectively .",
    "the approximation to the integral is then @xmath154 where @xmath155 these coefficients are constructed to provide exact results for quadratic functions .",
    "when @xmath151 they reduce to the coefficients found in simpson s rule , and , because of the greater symmetry , the rule becomes exact for cubic functions as well .",
    "the four - point rule is also exact for cubic functions .",
    "it is @xmath156 where @xmath157 these integration formulas greatly reduce the size of the errors , as shown for the extended trapezoidal rule ( [ eq : extendedtrap ] ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : oneloopsetrap ] , but they do not result in systematic behavior .",
    "the lack of systematic dependence is primarily due to the use of a square grid to approximate a circular domain in the transverse direction .",
    "one way of putting this is that the iterated cartesian integrals try to approximate @xmath158 ( a key factor in the area of the circle ) as well as approximate the integral itself .      to overcome this square / circle problem , the integral",
    "is written in polar coordinates @xmath159 the points of the square grid lie on circles of varying radii @xmath160 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : circulargrid ] .",
    "the @xmath160 are easily computed from the coordinates of the square grid .",
    "the squares of these radii are used as the grid points for a trapezoidal approximation to the radial ( @xmath161 ) integral .",
    "because the limit @xmath162 does not fall on one of these points , the extended trapezoidal rule ( [ eq : extendedtrap ] ) must be used for the last interval . clearly , the intervals are not of equal length ; however , they are on average of order @xmath163 , where @xmath144 is the spacing in the square grid . for the first 10 circles ,",
    "the average spacing in @xmath161 is actually closer to @xmath164 .",
    "the number of points on the square grid that fall on any one circle come in multiples of 4 , because of reflection symmetries .",
    "these points can be used to approximate the angular integral on each circle via another application of the trapezoidal rule . for the self - energy integral",
    "@xmath24 , however , the integrand is independent of angle and one can simply use one point or average the values at all points .",
    "the contribution to the weighting of a grid point is then the same for all transverse points on the same circle .",
    "the circular weighting in the transverse direction can be combined with either the extended trapezoidal rule or the extended simpson s rule in the longitudinal direction .",
    "a comparison of the two is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : oneloopsesimp ] .",
    "the relatively large excursions for small @xmath52 are due to the small number of grid points involved for this case of a large boson mass . for larger @xmath52 the extended simpson s rule",
    "is seen to result in less excursion between different values of @xmath54 , and is preferred for the self - energy integral .",
    "results for the extended simpson s rule are compared with those of the ordinary dlcq sum in fig .",
    "[ fig : oneloopsecirc ] ; in this case the results for the extended trapezoidal rule would not be visibly worse ."
