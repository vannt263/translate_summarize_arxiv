    "our understanding of galaxies in the local universe has improved dramatically over the past decade , in significant part due to large optical spectroscopic surveys such as the two - degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ; * ? ? ? * ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "one of the major findings of the sdss is the discovery of ` galaxy bimodality ' , through which local galaxies are divided into two distinct populations , termed ` red sequence ' and ` blue cloud ' , according to their rest - frame colors or specific star formation rate ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "red - sequence galaxies typically present bulge - dominated morphology , red optical / uv color , and little gas and star formation , while blue - cloud galaxies are usually gas - rich with blue colors , ongoing star formation and disky morphology .",
    "the smaller number of galaxies found lying in the ` green valley ' between these two main populations in color space are widely believed to be caught in a transition phase from the blue cloud to the red sequence ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , although this picture has recently been disputed by some authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "narrow - field deep surveys reveal that this color bimodality persists out to redshift of at least @xmath4 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , though the prevalence of the red population has significantly increased since a redshift of unity @xcite .",
    "the cessation of star formation is thus an important process which has been contributing to galaxy evolution over the past @xmath5 .",
    "a complete picture of the way in which the star formation in galaxies gets shut down remains elusive .",
    "however , recent studies of the scaling relations of galaxy properties and their dependence on local environment have clearly established that , in addition to stellar mass , both internal structural properties and external environment are key indicators , or may even be drivers , of the star formation cessation processes in galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for instance , when studying the central galaxies in groups or clusters , the presence of a prominent bulge - like structure is found to be a necessary ( but not sufficient ) condition for stopping star formation @xcite .",
    "in addition , studies of the relationship between galaxy morphology and color have revealed a significant population of red - sequence galaxies with disc - dominated spirals at both low - z ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) and @xmath6 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , which are preferentially found in galaxies with large bulges @xcite .",
    "these findings support the ` morphological quenching ' mechanism proposed by @xcite , although studies of cold gas in massive galaxies indicate that a reduction in gas content is also required ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for central galaxies in massive dark matter halos above a critical mass of @xmath7 , `` radio - mode '' agn feedback and shock - heating may effectively reduce the gas cooling efficiency , thus also playing an important role in preventing further star formation @xcite .",
    "powerful agn feedback can also happen in the so - called `` quasar mode '' , which is predicted to be triggered by major mergers of gas - rich galaxies with comparable mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and is commonly adopted as one of the quenching processes in semi - analytic models .    for satellite galaxies , star formation quenching seems to be driven primarily by external processes occurring within their host group / cluster , such as gas stripping by ram - pressure @xcite and tidal interactions @xcite .",
    "the ` smoking gun ' of observations showing hi gas being removed by ram - pressure stripping have been obtained for spirals in nearby clusters of galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "studies of color profiles and surface brightness profiles for satellite galaxies in sdss group systems prefer more gentle processes such as `` starvation '' or `` strangulation '' ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on the other hand , a recent study of the specific star formation rate ",
    "stellar mass relation for galaxy groups / clusters at higher redshift ( @xmath8 , @xcite ) suggests that galaxy mergers play a primary role in quenching satellites in galaxy groups , while strangulation is a process more important in cluster - scale environment .",
    "there have also been statistical studies of the cold gas content and star formation in galaxies residing in different environments , using either direct atomic gas mass measurements from large blind surveys of hi emission such as the hi parkes all sky survey ( hipass ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the arecibo legacy fast alfa ( alfalfa ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) survey , or indirect estimates of gas content from the optical photometry in surveys like sdss ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these studies have revealed that gas - related quenching depends not only on the stellar mass of the satellite galaxies , but also on their surface mass density .",
    "a full understanding of star formation cessation in galaxies thus requires spatially - resolved measurements of stellar and gaseous components to be obtained for a large sample of galaxies covering wide ranges in mass and color , probing a range of environmental conditions .",
    "previous studies for this purpose have been mainly based on multi - wavelength broadband photometry , for both nearby galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while some authors also made use of long - slit spectroscopy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "significant improvements have been made in the past decade , thanks to many integral field unit ( ifu ) surveys which have obtained spatially resolved spectroscopy for samples of galaxies .",
    "however , to - date , the samples have been relatively small ( @xmath9 galaxies ) : sauron @xcite , diskmass @xcite , atlas@xmath10 @xcite .    the ongoing califa survey ( calar alto large integral field area * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is observing a sample of 600 galaxies , making a big step forward in 2d spectroscopic studies of nearby galaxies .",
    "for example , this survey has , for the first time , quantified the spatially - resolved history of stellar mass assembly for galaxies beyond the local group , demonstrating how massive galaxies grow their stellar mass inside - out @xcite .",
    "such an inside - out picture of galaxy formation is supported by further measurements of gradients in oxygen abundance of hii regions @xcite , in stellar metallicity of face - on spirals @xcite , and in stellar age and local surface mass density of galaxies of different morphologies and masses @xcite , all from the califa survey . however , the sample is still relatively modest , limiting the range of environments and galaxy properties that can be explored .",
    "the more recently launched sami survey @xcite takes a further step with a goal of obtaining ifu observations for 3400 galaxies by 2016 . in the meantime ,",
    "the kmos@xmath11 survey is pushing forward the ifu observations for high redshift galaxies , observing a sample of 600 galaxies at @xmath12 using kmos at the very large telescope @xcite .",
    "as a next step at low - z , the study of these phenomena is a key goal of the upcoming manga ( mapping nearby galaxies at apache point observatory , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) survey .",
    "as one of the major programs of the fourth - generation of sdss , manga will obtain two - dimensional , integral - field spectroscopy ( ifs ) for 10,000 galaxies in the nearby redshift range @xmath13 , optimally selected for uniform coverage and resolution using the single ( central ) spectra from sdss .",
    "each galaxy will be spectroscopically observed with an ifu to obtain multiple high signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) spectra across the full optical wavelength range from 3600 to 10300 .",
    "manga will thus provide 2d maps of stellar populations and recent star formation histories for a large number of quiescent and star - forming galaxies , thus enabling extensive exploration of the various processes by which star formation ceases in the local universe .    in this paper , to assess the potential use of the manga survey in studying the cessation of star formation , and to derive some initial results in this area , we present an analysis of the manga prototype ( p - manga ) data for a set of 12 galaxies , which were observed in the pilot run in 2012 december and 2013 january . these observations were made through time granted by the sloan digital sky survey - iii ( sdss - iii , * ? ? ?",
    "the prototype data are described in more detail in @xcite , which also provides a general overview of the manga project .    for each of the p - manga galaxies and for each spectrum in the associated data cube , we have performed full spectral fitting using the methodology developed in @xcite , in order to separate out emission line components from the underlying absorption - line stellar spectrum . from these decomposed spectra ,",
    "we have obtained full 2d maps of three key parameters ",

    "we then investigate any radial variations in the recent star formation histories of the galaxies by plotting the values of these parameters for different subregions of each galaxy , to see how they change with position .",
    "as we will show , the p - manga sample , though small in size , reveals intriguing systematic trends in the three diagnostic parameters across these galaxies , demonstrating the potential for using manga ( and similar ifu surveys ) to understand disk growth and star formation cessation in local galaxies .    throughout this paper",
    "we assume a @xmath14 cold dark matter cosmology model with @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 . a @xcite stellar initial mass function ( imf )",

    "p - manga was designed to explore a variety of instrument design options , observing strategies , and data processing algorithms .",
    "these p - manga data offer valuable insights into manga s potential , but differ substantially from the manga survey data in several ways . first",
    ", p - manga used just one of the two boss spectrographs , with only 560 total fibers and 8 ifus with three sizes : 19 fibers ( n@xmath19 ) , 61 fibers ( n@xmath20 ) , and 127 fibers ( n@xmath21 ) .",
    "the p - manga ifu complement was dramatically different from the manga survey instrument , with @xmath22n@xmath19 ( instead of just two ) , @xmath23n@xmath20 ( instead of 4 ) , @xmath24n@xmath21 ( instead of five ) , and no 37-fiber or 91-fiber ifus ( see * ? ? ? * for detailed description of manga instrumentation ) .",
    "finally , we also note that the masses and sizes of the p - manga target galaxies were not selected to be representative of the full manga sample .",
    "p - manga observations were obtained of three galaxy fields ( field 9 , 11 , 4 ) using sdss plates 6650 , 6651 , and 6652 , each containing 6 galaxies . some of the p - manga targets were drawn from early versions of the full manga sample ( wake et al .",

    "additionally , the non - optimal ifu complement of the p - manga instrument required some targets to be selected manually . for each plate",
    ", observations were obtained in sets of three 20-minute exposures , which were dithered by approximately a fiber radius along the vertices of an equilateral triangle to provide uniform coverage across each ifu .",
    "these three plates were observed to varying depths and in varying conditions , as required by the p - manga engineering tasks . although plate 6650 ( field 9 ) was observed to a depth comparable to what will be regularly achieved during manga operations , plates 6651 ( field 11 ) and 6652 ( field 4 ) are both significantly shallower than manga survey data , and plate 6651",
    "was intentionally observed at high airmass ( @xmath25 ) resulting in particularly poor image quality . in this paper",
    "we use data obtained with plates 6650 and 6652 ( see table [ tab : sample ] ) , while excluding plate 6651 .",
    "the raw data were reduced using a prototype of the manga data reduction pipeline ( drp ) , which is described in detail by @xcite . in brief , individual fiber flux and inverse variance spectra were extracted using a row - by - row algorithm , wavelength calibration was obtained from a series of neon - mercury - cadmium arc lines , and the spectra were flatfielded using internal quartz calibration lamps .",

    "flux - calibrated spectra from the blue and red cameras were combined across the dichroic break using an inverse - variance weighted basis spline function .",

    "was chosen .",
    "the typical effective spatial resolution in the reconstructed datacubes can be described by a gaussian with a full width at half maximum @xmath275 . when binning the datacubes , we scale the resulting error vectors to account , at least approximately , for wavelength and spatial covariance in the p - manga error cubes .",

    "we have also applied our code to the archival sdss spectra of the centers of the p - manga galaxies , and in figure  [ fig : compare_d4k_hda_hae ] we compare the resulting measurements of d@xmath0(4000 ) , ew(h@xmath1@xmath2 )  and @xmath30ew(h@xmath3 )  to those obtained from the central spaxel of the p - manga datacubes ( plotted as blue squares in the figure ) . in the same figure",
    ", we also compare our measurements , from both sdss ( black crosses ) and the central spaxel of p - manga datacubes ( red triangles ) with the measurements taken from the mpa / jhu database .",
    "overall , the values from different observations and pipelines agree well with each other .",
    "we have visually examined the best - fit spectrum for the few outliers , and find that our code provides a reasonably good fit to both sdss and p - manga spectra even in these cases .",
    "the relatively large discrepancy in one of the outliers ( the blue square and black cross located in the left - bottom corner in the right - hand panel ) is caused by the bad data pixels over the h@xmath3 band in the sdss spectrum .",
    "we note that , when fitting the spectra and measuring the diagnostic parameters , we do not take into account the covariance between wavelengths , nor the covariance between pixels .",
    "methods for tracking such covariances have been studied in depth ( e.g. * ? ? ? * for the sami survey ) .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , when compared to p - manga , manga will provide more accurately estimated spectral errors ( thus accurate error propagation through to the final datacubes ) , allowing construction of covariances between pixels .",
    "we will apply a detailed treatment of covariance in manga data in future work .",
    "before investigating the spatially - resolved properties of these galaxies star - formation histories , we take a first look at any spatial variations by comparing the central values of the diagnostic parameters to their integrated values across the field of view . to this end , we generated a global spectrum for each galaxy by stacking the entire datacube , with each spaxel at given wavelength being weighted by @xmath52 following @xcite , where @xmath53 is the signal - to - noise ratio at 5500  in the continuum .",
    "spaxels with @xmath54 were excluded from the stacking .",
    "we then measure the diagnostic parameters d@xmath0(4000 ) , ew(h@xmath1@xmath2 )  and @xmath30ew(h@xmath3 )  in the same manner as above .",
    "figure  [ fig : cen_vs_glb ] compares the global measurements to the same parameters obtained from the central spaxel of the galaxies . for csf galaxies ,",
    "the global parameters differ little from the central ones .",
    "in contrast , however , most of the cq galaxies show significant difference between central and global parameters , with smaller d@xmath0(4000 )  and larger ew(h@xmath1@xmath2 )  and @xmath30ew(h@xmath3 )  in the latter .",
    "this result implies that the outer regions of cq galaxies contain younger stellar populations and have therefore experienced more recent star formation than their inner parts . the difference in ew(h@xmath3 )  is relatively weak compared to the other two parameters , suggesting that the central - to - global variation may be mainly driven by the radial variation in recent star formation history , but not the current star formation rate .",
    "it may also be the case that h@xmath3   is not a reliable tracer of star formation in galaxies dominated by older stellar populations ( see   [ sec : summary ] ) .",
    "a comparison of the global parameters with the central parameters on the diagnostic diagrams of recent star formation history is shown in figure  [ fig : d4k_hda_hae ] , where we plot the galaxies on the d@xmath0(4000)-ew(h@xmath1@xmath2 )  and ew(h@xmath1@xmath2)-@xmath30ew(h@xmath3 )  planes , using the central and global parameters for the upper and lower panels , respectively . comparing the upper and lower panels , we identify two noticeable effects .",
    "first , the gap between the csf and cq galaxies as seen in the upper panels is largely filled in the lower panels , and this in - fill is made up exclusively of cq galaxies due to the broad scatter in their global values of d@xmath0(4000 )  and ew(h@xmath1@xmath2 ) .",
    "second , when globally measured , both the csf galaxies and the cq galaxies appear to deviate from the continuous star - formation models , moving by varying degrees toward the regime of recent bursts .      in figures  [ fig : maps1 ] and",
    "[ fig : maps2 ] we present the 2d maps of the three diagnostic parameters , d@xmath0(4000 ) , ew(h@xmath1@xmath2 )  and @xmath30ew(h@xmath3 ) , for all the 12 galaxies in the sample , with the csf galaxies in one figure and the cq galaxies in the other . in each case , the galaxies have been ordered such that the central values of d@xmath0(4000 ) , as measured from the central spaxel of the datacubes , increases from left to right .",
    "the sdss @xmath55 image is also shown for each galaxy .",
    "the effective radius , length and direction of major and minor axes are indicated in the images and maps . when generating the maps , we only employ spaxels where the s / n in the continuum at 5500  is greater than three .",
    "consistent with what was found from the global measurements in the previous subsection , the overall impression from the 2d maps is that all the galaxies show variation within the probed radius in all three parameters , but to varying degrees and differing radial extents , with the variations more pronounced in the cq galaxies . as noted above in  [ sec : sdss_data ] , galaxy ma003_9 shows a blue outer disk in the optical image , which causes it to be classified as a blue - cloud galaxy in the color  mass diagram , although its red core suggests that this is intrinsically a cq galaxy . in agreement with this interpretation ,",
    "the galaxy shows strong contrast between the central and outer parts in the maps of all the three diagnostic parameters .",
    "similar behavior is seen in galaxy ma008_4 , the most massive galaxy in the p - manga sample with @xmath56 , which is also a face - on spiral with a relatively blue outer disk ( although less prominent than in ma003_9 ) and strong radial variation in the diagnostic parameters .",
    "the galaxy is classified as a green - valley galaxy on the color  mass diagram ( see figure  [ fig : sample_properties ] ) due to its intermediate color , nuv@xmath28@xmath57 , which is unusually blue for its large stellar mass .",
    "the radial variations of the galaxies are shown more clearly in figure  [ fig : profiles ] , where we plot the radial profiles of the three parameters for all 12 galaxies . to save space we display two galaxies in every panel , with one csf galaxy ( blue symbols ) and one cq galaxy ( red symbols ) .",
    "this paired format also highlights the highly different behavior of the two broad classes . in constructing these profiles ,",
    "we have corrected for the effects of inclination on the radius for each spaxel in the datacubes , using the minor - to - major axis ratio from nsa , as determined from the sdss @xmath29-band photometry . when estimating the radial profile , we bin all the spaxels with the continuum @xmath58 at 5500  into a set of radial intervals with a constant width of @xmath59@xmath60@xmath61 , according to the deprojected radius of the spaxel ( @xmath29 ) and the effective radius of the galaxy ( @xmath60 ) . the value of the profile at given radius is then estimated by the median of the spaxels falling in the radial interval , and the error is given by the @xmath62 scatter between the spaxels .",
    "figure  [ fig : profiles ] clearly shows that cq galaxies generally present significant radial gradients in all the parameters , in the sense that the outer part of the galaxies show weaker d@xmath0(4000 )  ( thus a larger fraction of stellar populations with ages of @xmath63 ) , stronger h@xmath1  absorption ( thus more recent star formation in the past a few myr ) , and stronger h@xmath3  emission ( thus likely stronger ongoing star formation ) .",
    "in contrast , csf galaxies possess quite flat profiles in all cases , revealing little by way of gradient in star - formation properties .",
    "at least out to @xmath60 , the radial profiles are close to linear for all the galaxies . for each galaxy",
    "we apply a linear fit to the radial profile within @xmath60  and show the best fit as a solid line in the figure .",
    "the slope of the best - fit line is indicated in each panel .",
    "figure  [ fig : compare_slopes ] compares the slope index for the three parameters , @xmath64d@xmath0(4000)@xmath65 , @xmath64ew(h@xmath1@xmath2)@xmath65 and @xmath64@xmath30ew(h@xmath3)@xmath65 .",
    "these plots confirm that the radial gradients in the csf galaxies are small , but also shows that the different parameters are well correlated across galaxies of both types .",
    "this correlation is particularly strong for @xmath64d@xmath0(4000)@xmath65 and @xmath64ew(h@xmath1@xmath2)@xmath65 , which are beautifully ( albeit non - linearly ) correlated .",
    "however , given the small sample size , these apparent correlations should probably not be over - interpreted .",
    "figure  [ fig : profiles_in_a_panel ] compares the slopes of the radial profiles in a different way , where we plot all the profiles in the same panel for a given parameter , normalizing each profile by the inner - most radial bin and scaling the radii by the effective radius .",
    "the differing behavior of the two classes of galaxies is striking .",
    "the csf galaxies show only weak or no radial variation , while the cq galaxies display steeper profiles , spanning a wide range in slope .",
    "it is , however , interesting to note that although the average properties of the two types differ dramatically , there is a degree of overlap between the classes in all panels , suggesting that a continuum of the same underlying physical processes has driven star formation in all these galaxies .",
    "as indicated from the 2d maps , the galaxies with a blue outer disk ( ma003_9 and ma008_4 ) indeed show the strongest radial variation in all parameters .",
    "these two galaxies manifest their peculiarity in the profile of @xmath30ew(h@xmath3 ) , which is flat ( for ma008_4 ) or even negative ( for ma003_9 ) at @xmath66@xmath60 , before rapidly increasing at larger radii . when compared to these two galaxies , the other cq galaxies present much shallower profiles ( though still steeper than that of csf galaxies ) , with @xmath30ew(h@xmath3)increasing smoothly at @xmath67@xmath60  and becoming flat at larger radii .",
    "the large values of @xmath30ew(h@xmath3 )  at large radii indicates that these two galaxies are strongly forming stars in their outer disks .",
    "this measurement is consistent with blue nuv@xmath28  color in these outer disks , which is known to be a sensitive indicator of the cold gas mass fraction in galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the negative @xmath30ew(h@xmath3 )  profile at @xmath66@xmath60  seen in ma003_9 is also found in ma003_4 , and may be caused by the presence of a bulge or agn in the galactic center . indeed , according to the bpt diagram ( figure  [ fig : sample_properties ] ) , the two galaxies are the only agn candidates in the sample .",
    "it is likely that an agn contributes to the h@xmath3 emission in the central region , thus enhancing the central @xmath30ew(h@xmath3 )  and leading to a dip in the profile as seen at @xmath68@xmath60 .",
    "interestingly , apart from this feature , the radial profiles of the two probably agn hosts are similar to those of the other cq galaxies , suggesting that current , low levels of agn activity may not have a strong effect on recent star formation activity , at least for these two examples .",
    "it is interesting to note that the three galaxies discussed above , ma003_9 , ma008_4 and ma003_4 , share a number of common properties : they are all spiral galaxies with a quiescent center , at the massive end of our sample with m@xmath69@xmath70m@xmath36 , and showing the largest gradients in d@xmath0(4000)indicative of young stellar populations formed within the past a few gyr .",
    "they all share some properties with the population of `` passive red spirals '' , identified recently as an interesting set of possible transition objects with disk - like morphologies but red colors , at both low - z ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and high - z ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "statistical analyses on a larger sample from manga ( or other ifu surveys ) is needed in order to better understand the physical link between our galaxies and the passive / quiescent spiral population .",
    "the 2d maps in figures  [ fig : maps1 ] and  [ fig : maps2 ] , as well as the radial profiles in figures  [ fig : profiles ] and  [ fig : profiles_in_a_panel ] , are in broad agreement with maps / profiles of stellar population age estimated from both califa @xcite and p - manga @xcite , in the sense that most galaxies in the nearby universe show flat to negative gradients in stellar age , although in those studies the detailed behaviors of the age gradients depend on galaxy mass or morphology . in this work",
    "we only consider the dependence of our measurements on the d@xmath0(4000)of the galactic center , which is an indicator of the prominence of stellar populations younger than 1 - 2 gyr , rather than the mean stellar age as investigated in those studies . despite these differences ,",
    "the ifu - based results obtained so far are all consistent with the `` inside - out '' growth of galactic disks @xcite , a picture that was supported previously by both numerical simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and abundant studies of broadband color gradients pioneered more than 50 years ago by @xcite .",
    "we now return to the comparison of diagnostic diagrams of recent star formation history , based on the radial profiles obtained in the previous subsection .",
    "figure  [ fig : diagnostics ] presents the d@xmath0(4000 )  vs. ew(h@xmath1@xmath2 )  ( left panels ) and ew(h@xmath1@xmath2 )  vs. @xmath30ew(h@xmath3 )  ( right panels ) planes , with each panel once again contrasting two galaxies , one csf system ( blue symbols ) and one cq system ( red symbols ) .",
    "panels are ordered such that d@xmath0(4000 )  increases from top to bottom . for each galaxy ,",
    "the radial profiles within the effective radius @xmath60  as shown in the previous figure are plotted here , with larger data points corresponding to larger radii .",
    "the set of bc03 models in figure  [ fig : d4k_hda_hae ] are also repeated here as the solid and dashed lines , but for clarity these lines are not colored ; they provide a reference grid to register the relative position of the different radial bins on the diagnostic diagrams .",
    "both the weak radial variations for csf galaxies and the strong variations for cq galaxies are readily apparent in this figure .",
    "comparing the location of the radial bins on the two diagrams , as well as their relative location with respect to the model curves , presents a comprehensive picture of how and where star formation cessation is occurring within the galaxies .",
    "the diagrams demonstrate that all the cq galaxies behave in the same manner : d@xmath0(4000 )  decreases , while ew(h@xmath1@xmath2 )  and @xmath30ew(h@xmath3 )  increase , as one moves outward in the galaxies .",
    "this consistency is even clearer in figure  [ fig : diagnostics_1panel ] where we overplot the radial profiles of all 12 galaxies in a single set of diagnostic diagrams .",
    "the profiles are plotted with cyan triangles for csf galaxies , and magenta triangles for cq galaxies .",
    "we highlight the two peculiar galaxies discussed above , ( ma003_9 and ma008_4 ) , which show the strongest radial gradients and unusual shape in the profile of @xmath30ew(h@xmath3 ) , by identifying them with yellow triangles .",
    "we also pick out the green - valley galaxies ( @xmath71nuv@xmath28@xmath72 ) as green triangles . for comparison ,",
    "the central spaxels are plotted with blue open symbols and red solid symbols for the two classes of galaxies .",
    "the cq galaxies indeed follow a tight track on the d@xmath0(4000 )  versus ew(h@xmath1@xmath2 )  plane .",
    "these spatially - resolved data , reaching out to @xmath60  for all 12 galaxies , also show how the clear distinction between the two classes of galaxies becomes blurred when one also considers their outer parts .",
    "figure  [ fig : diagnostics_1panel ] shows that the gaps in the parameter space between the regions occupied by the centers of the galaxies are populated by these same galaxies outer parts .",
    "this continuous sequence forms a tight relation in the d@xmath0(4000)-ew(h@xmath1@xmath2 )  plane , closely following the continuous star formation models . in detail , though , the intermediate region on the diagrams is mainly occupied by the two galaxies ( ma003_9 and ma008_4 ) that have strong radial variations and unusual profiles in @xmath30ew(h@xmath3 ) . in order to see this dominance more clearly , we have repeated the same panels of figure  [ fig : diagnostics_1panel ] , but excluding these two systems , and we find the gap between the galaxy types once again starts to emerge .",
    "it is clear , however , that the cq galaxies do still extend substantially into the intermediate region , and that the effect appears to be stronger for green - valley galaxies than for the other objects in the cq galaxy class .",
    "ma008_4 : :    this system , cgcg  184 - 033 , is the central galaxy of a group in the    catalog of @xcite . the system comprises 8 member galaxies with    spectroscopically - measured redshift from sdss , including the central    galaxy itself .",
    "this is the most massive galaxy in the sample with a    stellar mass of @xmath56 .",
    "the sdss    spectroscopy and the central spaxel of the p - manga datacube reveal    that the central region of this galaxy shows relatively strong    absorption in h@xmath1 for its ew(h@xmath3 ) ,    implying that a starburst event has happened within the galaxy in the    past 1  @xmath43 .",
    "considering the fact that the    galaxy has a very close companion , a strongly star - forming spiral at    the same redshift ( z=0.042 ) , the post - starburst feature may be the    product of a tidal interaction with the companion , which caused the    central part of the galaxy to have ceased star formation recently .",
    "the    p - manga data also reveal strong radial variation in all the diagnostic    parameters in this galaxy : d@xmath0(4000 ) ,    ew(h@xmath1@xmath2 )  and    ew(h@xmath3 ) .",

    "the overall radial dependence of the diagnostic parameters presented in our work is apparently consistent with these previous findings , although the small sample size does nt allow the correlation of the radial profiles with galaxy morphology , stellar mass and structural properties to be examined in a statistical manner .",

    "the califa results , together with the results from broadband photometry and long - slit spectroscopy , strongly suggest that galaxy growth and death are driven by multiple parameters ( at least the local surface density , total stellar mass and morphology ) , and that further studies of much larger samples are needed in order to isolate the role of each parameter , and the physical process behind it .",
    "the increasing manga sample is expected to provide much better results in the near future .",
    "another interesting result from our work is that , when spatially resolved , the distribution of galaxies on the diagnostic diagrams is no longer bimodal , and the separation between the cq and csf populations is filled in by those galaxies that are classified as ` green - valley ' according to their optical / uv color . in a recent complementary study , @xcite selected from sdss a large sample of ` recently quenched ' galaxies that have a significant fraction of young stars within the central @xmath78 region , and found them to populate the region of green - valley galaxies in d@xmath0(4000 )  and optical colors , so their central parts seem to be at the same evolutionary stage as the outer parts of the p - manga galaxies .",
    "the two studies combine to suggest that the green valley does , indeed , pick out a transition phase between star - forming and passive populations , but that different parts of different galaxies enter the green valley at different times .",
    "there are a few caveats to this analysis that we will address in future work .",
    "we have used relative measurements of d@xmath0(4000 ) , ew(h@xmath1@xmath2 )  and ew(h@xmath3 )  as indicators of recent star formation history .",
    "we have not presented quantitative measurements of mean stellar ages due to the sensitivity of these indices to stellar metallicity , element abundance and dust attenuation @xcite . throughout this paper",
    "we use solar metallicity models for comparison .",
    "we have compared the data to models with three different metallicities ( z=0.4 , 1 , 2.5z@xmath36 ) , finding that the dependence on metallicity is very small for younger stellar populations , but become more important at older ages . in @xcite",
    "we explore the possibility of simultaneously deriving the age and metallicity of p - manga galaxies using stellar population model fits to the full spectrum . in the present paper ,",
    "we use the h@xmath3  emission line to characterize the instantaneous star formation rate .",
    "however , for galaxies with dominant old stellar populations , ob stars may not be the only source of ionizing photons ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , ew(h@xmath3 )  lower than 6  was found to be more compatible with light from post - agb stars @xcite , and it would be interesting to evaluate the contribution of such stars to the emission - line properties of the spectra once a larger sample is available .",
    "in a recent sdss - based study @xcite has nicely demonstrated that a combination of d@xmath0(4000 ) , ew(h@xmath1@xmath2 )  and the specific star formation rate ( sfr / m@xmath69 ) provides stringent constraints on the recent star formation histories of the _ central region _ of galaxies in the stellar mass range @xmath79m@xmath36 . in particular , this methodology is powerful in separating out the galaxies with ongoing or past starbursts from those with a continuous star formation history . by applying this new methodology to the spatially resolved spectroscopy for a large sample from manga , we may well expect to better quantify the fractions of the mass produced by ongoing and recent bursts , as well as their radial variation across the whole galaxy , thus leading to more reliable constraints on the maps and radial profiles of the recent star formation history .",
    "previous studies have proposed a variety of galaxy properties as indicators of the termination of star formation , including both color indices ( e.g. nuv@xmath28 ) and structural parameters like the central surface mass density and stellar velocity dispersion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the effective radius @xmath60  and the ratio of stellar mass relative to @xmath60 , @xmath60@xmath80 , or @xmath60@xmath81 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and sersic profile index @xmath82 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "since different indicators may trace different physical processes , it is important to ask which galaxy property is most closely linked to the end of star formation .",
    "again , once larger samples of galaxies become available , it will be very interesting to correlate the kind of spectral diagnostic gradient study presented here with these other parameters , to see which is the trigger , and even how the trigger varies between galaxies of different types or in different environments .    despite these limitations ,",
    "it is heartening to see how much can be learned about the cessation of star formation from even a sample of 12 galaxies , thanks to the resolved spectroscopic observations that p - manga ifus have provided .",
    "the full manga survey began on 2014 july 1 , offering new opportunities to extend these kinds of studies , as observations of its 10,000 galaxies continue .",

    "<S> we present an analysis of the data produced by the manga prototype run ( p - manga ) , aiming to test how the radial gradients in recent star formation histories , as indicated by the 4000 - break ( d@xmath0(4000 ) ) , h@xmath1  absorption ( ew(h@xmath1@xmath2 ) ) and h@xmath3  emission ( ew(h@xmath3 ) ) indices , can be useful for understanding disk growth and star formation cessation in local galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we classify 12 galaxies observed on two p - manga plates as either centrally quiescent ( cq ) or centrally star - forming ( csf ) , according to whether d@xmath0(4000 )  measured in the central spaxel of each datacube exceeds 1.6 . for each spaxel </S>",
    "<S> we generate both 2d maps and radial profiles of d@xmath0(4000 ) , ew(h@xmath1@xmath2 )  and ew(h@xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that csf galaxies generally show very weak or no radial variation in these diagnostics . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , cq galaxies present significant radial gradients , in the sense that d@xmath0(4000 )  decreases , while both ew(h@xmath1@xmath2 )  and ew(h@xmath3 )  increase from the galactic center outward . the outer regions of the galaxies show greater scatter on diagrams relating the three parameters than their central parts . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the clear separation between centrally - measured quiescent and star - forming galaxies in these diagnostic planes is largely filled in by the outer parts of galaxies whose global colors place them in the green valley , supporting the idea that the green valley represents a transition between blue - cloud and red - sequence phases , at least in our small sample . </S>",
    "<S> these results are consistent with a picture in which the cessation of star formation propagates from the center of a galaxy outwards as it moves to the red sequence . </S>"
