    "in recent years several attempts at controlling turbulence through a number of wall - based forcing methods have been reported @xcite , often aimed at frictional drag reduction ( dr ) .",
    "a large number of works , exploiting both numerical and experimental approaches , has been devoted to this goal .",
    "in this paper we focus on spanwise wall - based forcing , i.e. on a class of forcing methods designed to modify favorably the turbulent flow by introducing an external action directed in the spanwise direction .",
    "early work addressing the modification of wall turbulence by creating a cross flow can be traced back to bradshaw & pontikos @xcite .",
    "spanwise forcing of turbulent flows has been reviewed by karniadakis & choi @xcite . in 1992 ,",
    "jung , mangiavacchi & akhavan @xcite introduced the spanwise - oscillating wall technique , where the wall of a fully turbulent channel flow is subject to an alternate harmonic motion in the spanwise direction .",
    "if @xmath0 indicates the spanwise velocity component at the wall , the law that defines this forcing method is : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is time , and @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the oscillation amplitude and period , respectively .",
    "once @xmath3 and @xmath4 are set within the optimum range from the viewpoint of dr performance , the authors observed , by means of direct numerical simulations ( dns ) , that a strong suppression of turbulence occurs in the wall region , accompanied by a significant reduction of the mean friction .    the analysis has been carried on in successive studies : we recall quadrio & sibilla @xcite for the pipe flow , and j .- i .",
    "choi , xu & sung @xcite and quadrio & ricco @xcite , as dns - based analyses which contributed new datasets and detailed descriptions of the flow .",
    "laboratory experiments , due to laadhari _",
    "_ @xcite and k. s. choi @xcite , complemented the numerical works and addressed the issue of dependency of dr on the value of the reynolds number .",
    "alltogether these works have contributed to demonstrating that the natural friction drag of the turbulent flow can be reduced ( at least at moderate values of @xmath5 ) up to 45% for @xmath6 ( quantities with the @xmath7 superscript are made dimensionless with viscous wall units ) .",
    "an optimal value of the oscillation period exists , namely @xmath8 , that yields the maximum dr at all amplitudes .",
    "the net energy saving , that substracts from the reduced flow - driving pumping power the power expense required to move the wall against viscous resistance , has been addressed first by baron and quadrio @xcite , and today it is recognized @xcite that it can reach up to 10% . crediting a commonly accepted qualitative explanation , the transverse oscillating boundary layer induced by the wall motion explains the drag reduction , since it produces a phase displacement between the wall - layer turbulence structures , capable of weakening the viscous wall cycle . when phase - averaged , this time - alternating layer in the turbulent regime has been found to coincide with the oscillating laminar stokes layer , for which an analytic solution is known as a classic solution of the boundary layer equations @xcite .",
    "this has been recently exploited to determine a parameter @xcite that is capable of scaling linearly with dr and thus makes it possible to predict dr capabilities .",
    "advantages and drawbacks of the oscillating - wall technique are obvious .",
    "it presents energetic performance that could make it worth of practical implementations , and thanks to its open - loop character it does not need distributed sensors or actuators , that would be still unpractical with the technology available today . on the other hand , by its very nature",
    "this technique requires moving parts , and thus does not lend itself to be implemented as a passive device , which is on the other hand the most appealing possibility application - wise .    in this paper ,",
    "we aim at extending the oscillating - wall technique , to take one further step towards the long - term objective of a successful practical implementation ; in particular we want to translate the time - dependent forcing law expressed by eq.([eq : time ] ) into a stationary formula .",
    "this goal can be achieved by exploiting the convective nature of wall - bounded flows .",
    "though at the wall the mean velocity profile annihilates , it is well known that the convection velocity of a turbulent wall flow ( or , more precisely , the convection velocity of turbulent fluctuations ) resembles the mean velocity profile only in the bulk of the flow .",
    "kim & hussain @xcite have shown some years ago that near the wall , say below @xmath9 , the convection velocity becomes essentially independent upon the wall distance , and remains constant at the value @xmath10 .",
    "it is this near - wall value of the convection velocity that will enable us to translate the temporal forcing from eq.([eq : time ] ) into a spatially - oscillating forcing , yielding the following forcing law that is expected to modify the turbulent flow in a similar manner to the oscillating wall :    @xmath11        here @xmath12 denotes the streamwise coordinate , and @xmath13 is the forcing wavelength .",
    "the resulting distribution of spanwise wall velocity is sketched in fig.[fig : sketch ] , where the coordinate system employed in this paper is also indicated .    though the control law ( [ eq : space ] ) has never been considered in the literature , one paper where a similar space - time extension has been discussed in the past",
    "is the one by berger and coworkers @xcite . in a parametric dns - based study",
    "a spanwise - oriented lorentz volume force was simulated to obtain the following two forcing configurations : @xmath14 @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the penetration depth of the forcing , and @xmath17 its intensity . for certain values of the parameters ,",
    "the streamwise - dependent law ( [ eq : berger - space ] ) produced a dr comparable to that of the time - dependent law ( [ eq : berger - time ] ) , with the added benefit of an improved energetic balance .",
    "however , the difference between a body force and a wall - based forcing is substantial , as discussed for example by zhao et al .",
    "@xcite , and no definite conclusion can thus be drawn _ a priori _ from the study by berger et al .",
    "@xcite with respect to the oscillating velocity , which is strictly a wall - based forcing .",
    "indeed , it will be shown later that some of the results described in ref .",
    "@xcite ( for example the existence of an optimal wavelength that depends on the forcing intensity ) do not apply at all to the type of forcing considered here .",
    "schoppa & hussain @xcite showed that a significant amount of drag reduction can be achieved by introducing in a channel flow a spanwise velocity gradient , generated in the dns by a large - scale , streamwise - aligned and @xmath12-independent rolls .",
    "such velocity gradient weakens the near - wall cycle by suppressing the transient growth of streaks that would otherwise be stable according to normal - mode analysis .",
    "this mechanism is then addressed in a subsequent paper @xcite , where the role of streamwise - varying spanwise perturbations is highlighted in the context of the turbulence regeneration cycle .",
    "the dominant wavelength of the streak waviness is found to be very similar to the streamwise length of the coherent structures educed from conditional analysis of turbulent flow fields @xcite , namely about 300400 viscous units .",
    "aim of the present paper is to investigate the dr and energetic performance of the steady control law ( [ eq : space ] ) .",
    "thanks to an accurate data set , purposely obtained by several dns simulations , the @xmath18 parameter space will be explored in detail",
    ". the value of the reynolds number will be fixed at @xmath19 ( based on the friction velocity of the reference flow and half the channel gap ) ; any dependence on this flow parameter is not discussed here .",
    "the effects of the forcing ( [ eq : space ] ) on a laminar channel flow will be preliminarly studied .",
    "we will see that a laminar solution , although approximated , can be obtained in analytical form , and this solution will then be used to help understanding the dr properties of the forcing ( [ eq : space ] ) when used on a turbulent flow . in the end",
    ", we will be able to connect this forcing to a physical application that does not necessarily involve a moving wall .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "sec.[sec : laminar ] contains a theoretical discussion of the associated laminar flow , that is useful for predicting some of the energetic characteristics of the present technique ( further analytical details are deferred to an appendix ) . in sec.[sec",
    ": num ] the numerical simulations of the turbulent case and their discretization parameters are described .",
    "results about dr and energetic performances are reported and discussed in sec.[sec : results ] , together with a visual and statistical description of the forced flow , compared to the reference unperturbed one .",
    "some conclusive remarks , including examples of how the present forcing can be implemented in practice , are given in the concluding sec.[sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we consider first the laminar flow in a plane channel subject to either the temporal boundary forcing ( [ eq : time ] ) or the spatial boundary forcing ( [ eq : space ] ) .",
    "for the temporal case , it is easy to show that the incompressible momentum equation for the spanwise component @xmath20 decouples , so that the streamwise flow is described by the classic poiseuille parabolic solution , and the entire flow consists in this parabolic profile plus a spanwise alternating motion , that is identical to the oscillating transversal boundary layer that develops in a still fluid bounded by a wall subject to harmonic oscillation ( i.e. the so - called stokes second problem , that possesses a classic analytical solution @xcite ) . this oscillating boundary layer will be called temporal stokes layer ( tsl ) in the following .",
    "we address now the laminar flow subject to the space - varying boundary forcing ( [ eq : space ] ) , to define and discuss the spatial equivalent of the tsl , that will be called spatial stokes layer ( ssl ) .",
    "we leave some analytical details to appendix [ sec : analytical ] , but the main ideas are given here as follows .",
    "field for the laminar tsl and ssl .",
    "top : temporal forcing @xmath21 .",
    "bottom : spatial forcing @xmath22 .",
    "contours at @xmath23 , dashed lines indicate negative values . ]    in both the tsl and ssl , the field of the spanwise velocity component @xmath20 is a function of two independent variables , namely @xmath24 for tsl and @xmath25 for the ssl .",
    "we start by observing in fig.[fig : wcont ] how closely these @xmath20 fields for tsl and ssl resemble each other .",
    "the abscissa in fig.[fig : wcont ] is @xmath26 for the tsl , whereas it is changed to @xmath27 for the ssl .",
    "both fields are computed with the dns code , although the analytical expression of the former is available @xcite : @xmath28 , \\ ] ] where @xmath29 is a ( real ) normalization constant , @xmath30 is the angular frequency of the oscillation and @xmath31 is the thickness of the tsl , defined as : @xmath32    figure [ fig : wcont ] , where the parameters @xmath4 and @xmath13 are in the range of interest for turbulent dr purposes , illustrates the wall - normal structure of the tsl and the ssl . within this parameter range ,",
    "both stokes layers are thin compared to the channel half - width @xmath33 .",
    "the convection velocity being approximately constant over such a small wall - normal extension explains why the two contours in figure [ fig : wcont ] look very similar .",
    "an analytical solution for the ssl can be arrived at under the small thickness approximation . after some analytical efforts , described in the appendix ,",
    "the @xmath34 field of the laminar ssl can be shown to obey an expression , similar to eq.([eq : solution - tsl ] ) , that contains an airy function instead of an exponential function : @xmath35 , \\ ] ] where @xmath36 is a ( real ) normalization constant , @xmath37 is the forcing wavenumber , @xmath38 is the airy function of the first kind @xcite , and @xmath39 is the thickness of the ssl , defined as : @xmath40    in this expression , @xmath41 represents the gradient of the streamwise mean velocity profile evaluated at the wall .",
    "the @xmath34 laminar field computed by dns and plotted in fig.[fig : wcont ] ( bottom ) is virtually indistinguishable from the same field as computed from the analytical solution ( [ eq : solution - ssl ] ) .    comparing the two expressions ( [ eq : solution - tsl ] ) and ( [ eq : solution - ssl ] )",
    ", a qualitative difference between the ssl and the classical tsl can be observed : the former is not decoupled from the longitudinal mean velocity profile @xmath42 , but it depends on @xmath41 through the thickness @xmath39 given by ( [ eq : deltax ] ) .",
    "this remains without consequences in the laminar case , where the streamwise flow is not affected by the wall forcing , whereas it will become important in the turbulent case .",
    "fields for temporal and spatial forcing . left : analytical solution ( lines ) of the tsl and turbulent @xmath43 field ( symbols ) computed by dns .",
    "right : analytical solution ( lines ) of the ssl and turbulent @xmath44 field ( symbols ) computed by dns .",
    "profiles are taken at different ( temporal and spatial ) phases during the oscillation .",
    "the laminar solutions are linear in @xmath3 , whereas the turbulent profiles are for @xmath45 .",
    "turbulent temporal case is at @xmath19 and @xmath46 .",
    "turbulent spatial case is at @xmath19 and @xmath47 . to emphasize collapse with proper scaling ,",
    "the ssl analytical solution is computed for a different wavelength , namely @xmath48 , yielding a different @xmath39 , so that the role of @xmath49 as similarity variable is highlighted . ]",
    "it is well documented @xcite for the time - oscillating wall that the phase - averaged @xmath50 profile is identical to the laminar solution expressed by eq.([eq : solution - tsl ] ) , except for the initial transient where the oscillation is started from rest .",
    "( the operator @xmath51 indicates averaging along the homogeneous directions @xmath12 and @xmath52 . )",
    "this is well illustrated by fig.[fig : w - lamturb ] ( left ) , where the wall - normal distribution of @xmath20 in the tsl after eq.([eq : solution - tsl ] ) is plotted at various phases during the cycle , and compared with the turbulent @xmath43 field .",
    "the agreement , which has been related by ricco & quadrio @xcite to the vanishing @xmath53 component of the reynolds stresses tensor , is , as expected , excellent .",
    "the same result is shown in fig.[fig : w - lamturb ] ( right ) to hold true for the ssl case .",
    "now , of course , the analytical solution ( [ eq : solution - ssl ] ) has to be compared with the turbulent @xmath44 field .",
    "the role of @xmath54 as similarity variable is well known for the tsl . to emphasize that @xmath49 plays the same role for the ssl ,",
    "the comparison between laminar and turbulent profiles is carried out for two cases with different @xmath55 and thus , according to ( [ eq : deltax ] ) , with different @xmath39 .",
    "the agreement between the two profiles is excellent .",
    "this confirms the analogy between tsl and ssl in terms of the connection between the laminar solution and the phase - averaged turbulent solution .",
    "this analogy can be used ( see [ sec : results ] ) to increase our predictive capabilities when the spatial forcing ( [ eq : space ] ) is applied to a turbulent flow .",
    "we turn now to the turbulent case , that will be dealt with by using the direct numerical simulation ( dns ) technique . the computer code used to solve the incompressible navier ",
    "stokes equations is a parallel dns solver , based on mixed discretization ( fourier expansion in the homogeneous directions , and compact fourth - order accurate explicit compact finite difference schemes in the wall - normal direction ) , recently developed by luchini and quadrio @xcite .",
    "the turbulent flow in an indefinite plane channel is considered , with gap half - width given by @xmath33 .",
    "one reference simulation without forcing has been carried out at @xmath19 , where @xmath56 is the friction reynolds number , defined based on @xmath33 and the friction velocity @xmath57 , that will be used as reference velocity throughout the paper unless otherwise noted .",
    "the size of the computational domain is @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the total averaging time is rather large , to allow for well converged time - averaged results , and amounts to approximately @xmath61 viscous time units . the employed number of modes / points is given by @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , that yields a standard spatial resolution . for the reference simulation a value of @xmath65 ( defined based on the bulk velocity )",
    "is obtained , in agreement with the correlation @xmath66 given by pope @xcite .",
    "some 40 simulations with eq.([eq : space ] ) used as boundary condition at the channel walls have been then carried out for different values of @xmath13 and @xmath3 .",
    "owing to the periodic boundary conditions employed in the homogeneous directions , an integer number of forcing wavelength @xmath13 must be contained in the domain length @xmath67 .",
    "the systematic variation of @xmath13 has thus required , mostly for the largest values of @xmath13 , slight adjustments of @xmath67 .",
    "compared to the reference value of @xmath68 , 3 cases had an actual value of @xmath69 , and one was at @xmath70 . since such changes",
    "are of limited entity , the number of streamwise fourier modes has been left unchanged , with the implied little change in streamwise spatial resolution for these few cases . properly accounting for the initial transient , where the wall friction decreases from the unperturbed value to the reduced value given by the forcing ,",
    "is enforced according to the procedure described by quadrio & ricco @xcite , who reported an overall error in determining the friction coefficient below 1% .",
    "we have also verified that the results are not affected by the chosen value of @xmath67 .",
    "one simulation with @xmath71 and large dr has been repeated by doubling @xmath67 at @xmath72 ( and of course doubling the number of streamwise fourier modes ) .",
    "the value of @xmath73 measured in the simulation with the longer domain differs from the one computed by the simulation with standard domain length by much less than the error , mentioned above , related to the finite averaging time .",
    "the simulations were run on a computing system available in dedicated mode at the universit di salerno , taking advantage of its large computing throughput to run several cases at a time .",
    "the system possesses 64 computing nodes , each of which is equipped with two dual - core amd opteron cpus .",
    "the single computational case took about 10 days of wall - clock time when run in parallel by using 8 nodes .",
    "up to 8 cases can be run simultaneously , so that the wall - clock time for the entire study was about 7 weeks .",
    "the effectiveness of the steady spatial forcing ( [ eq : space ] ) in reducing the frictional drag is assessed by examining the value of the skin - friction coefficient obtained in several different simulations , in which the amplitude @xmath3 and the wavelength @xmath13 of the wall forcing are systematically varied .",
    "the measured coefficients are then compared to the value of the reference ( unforced ) flow .",
    "the savings in driving power will then be compared to the energetic cost of the wall velocity distribution , in order to asses the net power saving made possible by the spatial forcing .",
    "our simulations are performed at a fixed flow rate , so that a decrease of the frictional drag translates into a proportional decrease of the mean streamwise pressure gradient and of the power required to drive the flow .",
    "the power to drive the flow against viscous resistance is defined as : @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the space - averaged value of the streamwise component of the wall shear stress , evaluated at the lower and upper wall respectively , and @xmath77 is the time interval over which the time averaged is carried out , after discarding initial transients .",
    "the percentage saved power @xmath78 is expressed as percentage of the power @xmath79 required to drive the flow in the reference case , and is defined as follows : @xmath80    the quantity @xmath78 exactly corresponds to the percentage of friction drag reduction , and is expected to be a function of @xmath3 and @xmath13 .",
    "as a function of the forcing wavelength .",
    "empty symbols are temporal cases from quadrio & ricco @xcite : for them @xmath81 ( see text ) . ]    in fig.[fig : psav - lambda ] @xmath78 is plotted first as a function of @xmath82 , for different values of the amplitude @xmath83 .",
    "available data @xcite obtained with temporal forcing are also plotted , with the oscillation period translated into an oscillation wavelength through the near - wall value of the convection velocity , namely @xmath84 .",
    "the capital information drawn from this plot is the validation of our working hypothesis : the present steady forcing indeed parallels the unsteady oscillating - wall technique when oscillation period and forcing wavelength are related through @xmath85 .",
    "in analogy to the oscillating wall , that yields the maximum dr at a well - defined oscillation period @xmath86 , namely @xmath87 , the steady forcing yields the maximum dr at a well - defined wavelength @xmath82 , namely @xmath88 .",
    "it is striking how well the prediction @xmath89 is confirmed by our simulations .",
    "dr is observed over a very wide range of wavelenghts , @xmath90 , analogously to the oscillating wall .",
    "the effects of the ssl on the turbulent flow are , however , only qualitatively similar to those of the tsl .",
    "quantitative differences do exist , and in particular at a given wavelength the spatial forcing is observed to attain larger values of dr when compared to the temporal forcing at the same amplitude and equivalent period .     as a function of forcing amplitude . as in fig.[fig : psav - lambda ] , empty symbols are temporal cases from quadrio & ricco @xcite : for comparison recall that @xmath91 ( see text ) . ]",
    "fig.[fig : psav - a ] shows @xmath78 as a function of the amplitude @xmath83 , for different values of @xmath82 .",
    "the plot contains data from spatial as well as from temporal forcing cases .",
    "the dependence of dr on the forcing amplitude is qualitatively very similar for tsl and ssl : dr monotonically grows with @xmath3 , but the increase saturates to an apparently asymptotic behavior .",
    "again , the space - dependent forcing appears to be more effective in reducing turbulent friction : for a given amplitude the spatial forcing yields a @xmath92 larger dr than the temporal forcing .",
    "a maximum dr of about @xmath93 is observed at @xmath47 with a forcing amplitude of @xmath94 .",
    "in addition to @xmath95 , the forced channel flow has an additional power input @xmath96 , that is required to enforce the wall motion against the spanwise shear stress .",
    "@xmath96 is defined as : @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the space - averaged value of the spanwise component of the wall shear stress , and @xmath0 is the spanwise velocity of the walls .     as a function of the forcing wavelength . as in fig.[fig : psav - lambda ] , empty symbols are temporal cases from quadrio & ricco @xcite . the line - connected asterisks represent @xmath99 obtained from the laminar solution with @xmath45 , from formula ( [ eq : solution - tsl ] ) for the tsl and from formula ( [ eq : solution - ssl ] ) for the ssl .",
    "[ fig : preq - lambda ] ]    the required percentage power @xmath99 is defined in terms of the friction power @xmath79 of the reference flow as @xmath100 .",
    "@xmath99 is presented in fig.[fig : preq - lambda ] as a function of the forcing wavelength . again",
    ", spatial as well as temporal forcing data are included .",
    "of course @xmath99 assumes negative values , i.e. work has to be done against the fluid viscosity . comparing the two forcing methods , one can easily appreciate how the spatial forcing presents an energetic cost that is smaller than the cost of temporal forcing , by approximately a factor of 2 .",
    "the line - connected points in fig.[fig : preq - lambda ] represent the values @xmath99 that can be computed from laminar theory .",
    "tsl and ssl are considered at @xmath45 , for which formulas ( [ eq : solution - tsl ] ) and ( [ eq : solution - ssl ] ) respectively are analytically integrated .",
    "the good agreement was expected , since it was already observed ( see fig.[fig : w - lamturb ] ) that laminar and turbulent mean profiles of spanwise velocity are coincident .     as a function of the forcing wavelength .",
    "[ fig : pnet - lambda ] ]    lastly , a net percentage power saving @xmath101 is easily defined by comparing @xmath99 and @xmath78 , as follows : @xmath102    the net power saving @xmath101 is plotted in fig.[fig : pnet - lambda ] . since it has already been observed how ssl yields higher dr at lower energetic cost , of course here a significant difference in net gain is expected when comparing ssl and tsl .",
    "@xmath101 shows indeed an interesting maximum value of about @xmath103 at @xmath104 , while remaining positive over a wide range of wavelengths .",
    "moreover , positive @xmath101 are found for rather large amplitudes : at @xmath45 a net gain of about 5% can still be observed , whereas the tsl at the same amplitude presents a net loss of about 30% .",
    "it is worth noting that the search for the maximum of @xmath101 can not be considered exhaustive , and thus the presently observed maximum value of 23% at @xmath104 should be regarded as a starting point for a refined search .      .",
    "flow is from left to right .",
    "top : reference flow ; bottom : spatial forcing with @xmath47 and @xmath45 . ]    observing the main statistics of the flow and even a few instantaneous snapshots may help understanding how ssl affects turbulence .",
    "( additional statistical quantities are presented elsewhere @xcite ) . in fig.[fig : ucont ] isosurfaces are visualized for the @xmath105 quantity introduced by jeong & hussain @xcite and since then often used to identify turbulent vortical structures .",
    "the level is set at @xmath106 .",
    "the top plot is for the reference flow , and the bottom plot is for the same flow subject to the effects of the spatial forcing , with @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "this is one of the cases with the highest drag reduction , i.e. 45% .",
    "the ssl clearly appears to modify the near - wall turbulence and its structures .    .",
    "]    similar considerations can be drawn from single realizations of the flow as well from its statistical description .",
    "fig.[fig : uav ] reports the mean velocity profile in the law - of - the - wall form .",
    "the modification to the profile for the tsl and ssl cases are analogous when compared to the reference flow , but the effects are larger for the ssl .",
    "the drag reduction manifests itself through the thickening of the viscous sublayer , that results in the upward shift of the logarithmic portion of the velocity profile , as previously documented for other dr techniques , for example riblets @xcite .",
    "another relevant statistical quantity that is modified by the action of the ssl is the turbulence intensity .",
    "fig.[fig : urms ] presents the r.m.s .",
    "value of the fluctuations of the streamwise velocity component . to examine the effect of the lower reynolds number implied by the strong drag reduction in a constant - flow - rate simulation",
    ", this plot is still scaled using inner variables , but both the friction velocity of the reference flow and the actual friction velocity of the drag - modified flow are used as velocity scale .",
    "the strong reduction of fluctuations is deemphasized with the latter form of scaling , and what remains is the structural effect of the ssl after subtracting the effect due to a smaller @xmath56 .",
    "the curves however remain significantly different ; the main effect is a decrease of the fluctuation intensity , together with a displacement of the position of the maximum intensity further form the wall .",
    "similar effects have been already documented for other dr methods .",
    "in particular the same observation has been put forward @xcite for the oscillating - wall .",
    "it may be useful to remind the reader that effective dr methods exist , for example the active opposition control @xcite , where @xmath109 is unaffected when properly scaled ; on the other hand , as discussed for example by jimnez @xcite , experimental evidence exists that wall roughness may reduce the near - wall peak of turbulence intensities while increasing drag .",
    "this paper has studied a new form of boundary forcing for wall - bounded turbulent flows , that consists in imposing at the wall a steady distribution of spanwise velocity , modulated in the streamwise direction . in this study only sinusoidal modulation has been considered .",
    "main motivation was to find a steady counterpart to the oscillating - wall technique .",
    "the link between the two kinds of forcing is the convection velocity of the turbulence fluctuations , that takes a well - defined non - zero value @xmath85 at the wall and is thus capable of transforming a time scale into a length scale and viceversa .",
    "thanks to a number of direct numerical simulations , the behavior of this new forcing in the parameter space has been determined , and dr up to @xmath93 has been observed for @xmath94 and @xmath47 . for all amplitudes , the forcing wavelength that yields the maximum dr has been found to correspond to the optimal period of the oscillating wall converted in length through @xmath85 , thus confirming the validity of the analogy between temporal and spatial forcing .    this analogy has been extended further by studying the laminar case : this was known to be relevant to the oscillating - wall technique , since in the turbulent case the spanwise profile after space - time averaging is identical to the laminar solution .",
    "the laminar solution , that can be written in terms of airy functions , has been determined for the spatial case too , and it has been additionally verified that the turbulent spanwise flow when phase - averaged is identical to the laminar solution .",
    "this property can be leveraged to predict the power required for the control .",
    "we hope that a predictive quantity , similar to the parameter discussed by quadrio & ricco @xcite and capable of describing the dr effects of the forcing , could be envisaged on the basis of this analytical solution .",
    "together with qualitative analogies , there are quantitative differences between temporal and spatial forcing .",
    "the spatial forcing is more efficient in terms of dr , from the point of view of both absolute dr and net power saving . in particular , a net power saving as high as @xmath103 has been computed at @xmath104 , with one unit of forcing power translating into 3 units of saved power .",
    "this is more than 3 times the largest net saving documented for the oscillating wall , and also significantly larger than the benefit obtained with passive devices like riblets , that are reportedly capable of a saving up to 8 - 10% in laboratory conditions @xcite .",
    "the present form of spatial forcing is certainly realizable in principle , and an experimental setup is indeed under construction that will help shedding light on effects like the dependence of dr on @xmath5 . at the same time",
    ", we do not consider the present forcing , though steady , directly suitable as yet for practical applications .",
    "however , the successful design of a steady control law is one important step towards the realization of a passive drag - reducing device . in this framework ,",
    "the sensitivity of the turbulence near - wall cycle to a well - defined streamwise lengthscale is a fundamental result , that paves the way to the search for an efficient drag - reducing type of roughness . in this context , we have recently applied for a patent @xcite concerning a design method of roughness distributions yielding improved benefits over conventional riblets .",
    "such distributions may contain riblets with sinusoidally ondulated crests with wavelength @xmath110 . a later paper by peet _",
    "_ @xcite has confirmed by numerical simulations the potential success of similar sinusoidal riblets , reporting a 50% improvement over conventional riblets . since in @xcite",
    "the wavelength was in the optimum range , but only a single amplitude was tested , we are confident that even larger benefits can be attained by such a purely passive technique .",
    "cv has been supported by italian ministry of university and research through the grant prin 2005 on _ large scale structures in wall turbulence_. we acknowledge interesting discussions with dr p.ricco .",
    "part of this work has been presented by cv in june 2007 at the xi european turbulence conference , porto ( p ) .",
    "in this appendix an analytical , approximate solution of the navier  stokes equations for the laminar flow between indefinite plane walls is described , where the non - homogeneous boundary condition @xmath111 is imposed to the spanwise velocity component .",
    "the boundary forcing creates a layer of alternate spanwise motion , which develops close to the wall and resembles the temporal stokes layer .",
    "we have referred to it in this paper as the spatial stokes layer ( ssl ) , in comparison to the conventional temporal stokes layer ( tsl ) .",
    "an analytical solution will be derived now for the velocity profile of the ssl , under the assumption that the wall - normal length scale characteristic of the layer is small in comparison to the channel width .",
    "the solution is steady , and thanks to the spanwise invariance of the differential system , including its boundary conditions , all the @xmath52 derivatives can be dropped from the momentum equations , which then read :          this highlights that eqs.([eq : n - s4 ] ) and ( [ eq : n - s5 ] ) decouple from eq.([eq : n - s6 ] ) to form an independent two - dimensional problem , unaffected by the inhomogeneous boundary condition ( [ eq : bc - z ] ) .",
    "its solution is thus the classical laminar poiseuille solution , that gives a parabolic longitudinal velocity profile , and predicts a wall - normal velocity @xmath115 everywhere .",
    "thus eq.([eq : n - s6 ] ) can be further simplified as : @xmath116      at this point a boundary - layer approximation is introduced .",
    "we suppose the ssl to be confined in a thin region close to the wall , and to vanish at a distance definitely smaller than @xmath33 .",
    "if @xmath39 indicates the characteristic thickness of the ssl , we are requiring that @xmath119 . even before giving a precise definition of @xmath39 , we have seen in fig.[fig : wcont ] that this requirement is satisfied when the flow parameters are set within the range of interest ( which is where the spatial forcing achieves a substantial dr in the turbulent regime ) .",
    "if @xmath13 is comparable or larger than @xmath33 , the boundary - layer approximation implies also that @xmath122 in eq.([eq : prob1 ] ) is negligible compared to @xmath123 .",
    "we are thus left with the well - posed problem : @xmath124 with boundary conditions : @xmath125 to be solved in the domain @xmath126 .",
    "infinite solutions of an airy equation exist for @xmath138 spanning the whole complex plane , when derivatives are considered in the sense of analytic functions .",
    "these solutions are linear combinations of the two special functions @xmath139 and @xmath140 @xmath141 which are called airy functions of the first and second kind respectively .",
    "the general solution ( [ eq : combination ] ) has an alternate representation @xcite , which turns out to be useful in our case : @xmath142 where @xmath143 .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that among @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath144 and @xmath145 , the only base function satisfying conditions ( [ eq : bc3 ] ) ( up to a normalization factor ) is @xmath145 . as a consequence ,",
    "the solution that satisfies the required boundary conditions is : @xmath146                                                      m.  quadrio , c.  viotti , and p.  luchini .",

    "<S> steady forcing at the wall of a channel flow is studied via dns to assess its ability of yielding reductions of turbulent friction drag . the wall forcing consists of a stationary distribution of spanwise velocity that alternates in the streamwise direction . the idea behind the forcing builds upon the existing technique of the spanwise wall oscillation , and exploits the convective nature of the flow to achieve an unsteady interaction with turbulence .    </S>",
    "<S> the analysis takes advantage of the equivalent laminar flow , that is solved analytically to show that the energetic cost of the forcing is unaffected by turbulence . in a turbulent flow </S>",
    "<S> , the alternate forcing is found to behave similarly to the oscillating wall ; in particular an optimal wavelength is found that yields a maximal reduction of turbulent drag . the energetic performance is significantly improved , with more than 50% of maximum friction saving at large intensities of the forcing , and a net energetic saving of 23% for smaller intensities .    </S>",
    "<S> such a steady , wall - based forcing may pave the way to passively interacting with the turbulent flow to achieve drag reduction through a suitable distribution of roughness , designed to excite a selected streamwise wavelength . </S>"
