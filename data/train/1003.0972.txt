    "the decay constants of both pseudoscalar and vector heavy mesons have been studied by lattice simulations @xcite , the relativistic quark model @xcite , and the field correlator method @xcite .",
    "the light - cone distribution amplitudes ( lcdas ) of hadrons are key ingredients in the description of the various exclusive processes of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , and their role is analogous to that of parton distributions in inclusive processes . in terms of the bethe - salpeter wave functions , @xmath13 , the lcdas , @xmath14 ,",
    "are defined by retaining the momentum fractions , @xmath15 , and integrating out the transverse momenta , @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "they provide essential information on the nonperturbative structure of the hadron for the qcd treatment of exclusive reactions and they play a central role in all known factorization formulas . specifically , the leading twist lcdas describe the probability amplitudes for finding the hadron in a fock state with the minimum number of constituents .",
    "experimentally , the fact that @xmath5-physics exclusive processes are under investigation in babar and belle experiments also urges the detailed study of hadronic lcdas . in the literature ,",
    "the lcdas of heavy quarkonia have been estimated by various nonperturbative approaches , such as qcd sum rules @xcite , nrqcd factorization @xcite , and the light - front quark model @xcite . as for heavy - light mesons ,",
    "the lcdas of @xmath5-meson @xmath17 were first introduced within the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) @xcite , and the following studies were intensive @xcite , whereas the ones of other heavy - light mesons were discussed in a non - hqet framework @xcite .    in the past decade ,",
    "the most significant progress made in the qcd description of hadronic physics was , perhaps , in the avenue of heavy quark dynamics .",
    "the analysis of heavy hadron structures has been tremendously simplified by the heavy quark symmetry ( hqs ) proposed by isgur and wise @xcite and hqet developed from qcd in terms of @xmath18 expansion @xcite .",
    "hqet has provided a systematic framework for studying symmetry breaking @xmath18 corrections ( for a review , see @xcite ) . moreover , in terms of heavy quark expansion , hqet offered a new framework for the systematic study of the inclusive decays of heavy mesons @xcite . however , the general properties of heavy hadrons , namely their decay constants , transition form factors and structure functions etc . , are still incalculable within qcd , even in the infinite quark mass limit with the utilization of hqs and hqet .",
    "hence , although hqs and hqet have simplified heavy quark dynamics , a complete first - principles qcd description of heavy hadrons has still been lacking due to the unknown nonperturbative qcd dynamics .",

    ", these two properties seemed to be closely related . in terms of a detailed analysis",
    ", the purpose of this study is to transparently realize the relation between the decay constant and lcda of the heavy meson .",
    "we believe that a thorough understanding of these universal nonperturbative objects would be of great benefit when analyzing the hard exclusive processes with heavy meson production or annihilation .",
    "additionally , in this study , the @xmath0-wave heavy meson has been explored within the light - front quark model ( lfqm ) , which is a promising analytic method for solving the nonperturbative problem of hadron physics @xcite , as well as offering many insights into the internal structures of bound states .",
    "the basic ingredient in lfqm is the relativistic hadron wave function which generalizes distribution amplitudes by including transverse momentum distributions , and which contains all the information of a hadron from its constituents .",
    "the hadronic quantities are represented by the overlap of wave functions and can be derived in principle .",
    "the light - front wave function is manifestly a lorentz invariant , expressed in terms of internal momentum fraction variables which are independent of the total hadron momentum .",
    "moreover , the fully relativistic treatment of quark spins and center - of - mass motion can be carried out using the so - called melosh rotation @xcite .",
    "this treatment has been successfully applied to calculate phenomenologically many important meson decay constants and hadronic form factors @xcite .",
    "therefore , the main purpose of this study was the calculation of the leading twist lcdas of @xmath0-wave heavy mesons within lfqm .",
