    "the local leo cold cloud ( llcc ) @xcite is the predominant central component ( 22 square degrees centered near @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) of a narrow ( @xmath62@xmath7 ) , broken ribbon of diffuse cold gas stretching over 70@xmath7 of the sky at high galactic latitude @xcite .",
    "the llcc was discovered by @xcite through its very narrow h  i 21  cm emission indicative of a kinetic temperature below 30  k. utilizing 21 cm observations of three background extragalactic radio sources , @xcite revisited the llcc as part of their arecibo millenium h  i survey and measured spin temperatures of @xmath020  k and column densities of @xmath03  @xmath8  @xmath9 for the intervening gas .",
    "the combination of such temperatures and column densities are remarkable in that they imply an extremely thin ( @xmath10  pc ) , sheetlike geometry for the cloud if it is in thermal pressure equilibrium .    in the first optical absorption line study of the llcc , @xcite obtained high - resolution observations of interstellar na  i toward 33 stars in the region and were able to place a firm upper limit of 45  pc on the cloud distance .",
    "this distance constraint places the llcc well inside the local bubble of low - density gas surrounding the sun out to distances of @xmath6100  pc or more @xcite .",
    "based on measurements of the soft x - ray background @xcite , it has long been thought that the local bubble is filled with a highly - ionized , hot ( @xmath610@xmath11  k ) plasma .",
    "recently , @xcite tested this hypothesis through a multi - wavelength study utilizing the llcc in an x - ray shadowing experiment .",
    "key steps included tightening the llcc distance to between 11.3@xmath120.2 and 24.3@xmath120.2  pc based on additional optical absorption - line measurements and mapping the llcc h i 21 cm emission at spatial and velocity resolutions of 4@xmath13 and 0.184  km  s@xmath14 through the galactic arecibo l - band feed array h  i ( galfa - hi ) survey @xcite . in comparing this map ( with a peak h  i column density of @xmath15  @xmath9 ) to the _ rosat _ soft ( 1/4 kev ) x - ray data @xcite in the llcc region ,",
    "@xcite find appreciably less x - ray shadowing than expected from a standard local bubble model .",
    "based on this result and other evidence @xcite , they argue that the isotropic component of the observed soft x - ray background is mostly a foreground effect due to solar wind charge exchange with neutral interstellar matter at the @xmath6100  au distant heliopause @xcite .",
    "given the llcc s location deep inside the local bubble , a measure of its thermal gas pressure would provide a key physical diagnostic of this cold cloud and its environment .",
    "the warm , partially - ionized clouds that are known to inhabit the local bubble collectively have an average temperature of 6700  k and a mean thermal pressure ( p / k ) of 2300  @xmath1  k @xcite .",
    "if the llcc is in pressure equilibrium with these warm clouds and their environment , one would expect it to have a similar mean pressure .",
    "however , @xcite have suggested that this cold cloud is the result of an impact between warm clouds in the local bubble and subsequent compression at the cloud interface .",
    "models of the transonic compression of colliding flows of warm gas have yielded cold , sheet - like structures at the collision interface characterized by significant overpressures with respect to the surrounding medium @xcite .",
    "thus , if the llcc is the product of such a collision , its pressure should clearly exceed the mean pressure of the warm clouds in the local bubble .",
    "ultraviolet spectroscopy of the c  i absorption produced by the llcc in its background stars has the potential to provide an accurate measure of the cloud s thermal gas pressure .",
    "since the fine - structure states of interstellar c  i are primarily populated by collisions with hydrogen atoms in diffuse clouds , their excitation is sensitive to the local gas pressure @xcite .",
    "the many c  i transitions observable in the far - uv ( key multiplets centered near 1277 , 1280 , and 1329   ) include lines with a large range in oscillator strength arising from each of the j  @xmath16  0 ,  1 ,  2 fine - structure levels . a number of other diagnostic transitions through which the physical character of the llcc can be evaluated are also only observable in the ultraviolet .",
    "however , due in part to a lack of bright uv background sources , there has been no previous uv absorption - line study of this cloud .    in this paper , we present high - resolution uv spectra of the llcc c  i absorption in two sightlines observed with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) onboard the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) . these observations conclusively show that the thermal gas pressure of the llcc is well above that of the warm clouds in the local bubble .",
    "indeed , the measured llcc pressure is higher than that expected in the colliding cloud interpretation of the llcc as a sheet - like structure at the collision interface",
    ". nevertheless , in support of this interpretation , we find that a multi - epoch comparison of the na i absorption toward a high - proper - motion background star reveals significant variation indicative of llcc structure on a scale of @xmath050  au .",
    "among the 16 stars found by @xcite to exhibit narrow na  i absorption corresponding to the llcc , three ( hd  83023 , hd  85259 , and hd  84722 ) were targeted for _ hst _ stis observations of their uv interstellar absorption lines .",
    "these specific stars were selected because they are the brightest uv background sources with appreciable llcc absorption and they are all rapid rotators ( @xmath17sin@xmath18  @xmath19  100  km  s@xmath14 ) well - suited for interstellar absorption - line measurements .",
    "hd  83023 ( d  @xmath16  209@xmath20  pc ) @xcite and hd  85259 ( 239@xmath21  pc ) have sky positions behind the periphery of the llcc while hd  84722 ( 84.8@xmath22  pc ) is located behind the cloud interior about 52@xmath13 away from hd  85259 ( which corresponds to a sightline separation of 0.3  pc at the cloud distance of @xmath020  pc ) .",
    "the stis observations of hd  83023 , hd  84722 , and hd  85259 were obtained in 2010 april , november , and december , respectively .",
    "hd  83023 and hd  85259 were both observed using the e140h and e230h echelle gratings to cover the 1242  -  1444    and 1824  -  2101  wavelength regions at a velocity resolution of 2.75  km  s@xmath14 . due to the faintness of hd  84722 in the far - uv ,",
    "this star was only observed with the e230h setup .",
    "the observed wavelength regions were chosen to cover key interstellar transitions of c  i , c  i * , c  i * * , c  ii * , s  i , s  ii ,",
    "cl  i , and ni ii with the e140h setup and mg  i , cr  ii , and zn  ii with the e230h setup .",
    "the raw two - dimensional stis echelle spectra were flat - fielded , wavelength - calibrated , and scattered - light - corrected using the standard stsdas data reduction software . with net exposures ranging from 1750  s ( e230h ) for hd  84722 to 4650  s ( e140h ) for both hd  83023 and hd  85259 , the final extracted spectra are characterized by continuum s / n ratios ranging from @xmath015 at 2050    for hd  84722 and at 1260    for hd  83023 to @xmath080 at 1315    for hd  85259 .",
    "all of the stis observations for this program ( go 11736 ) were obtained in a total of 7  _ hst _ orbits .    in support of our stis data analysis , we re - observed the interstellar na  i d@xmath23 @xmath245889.951 and d@xmath25 @xmath245895.924 absorption toward hd  83023 , hd  84722 , and hd  85259 using the same 0.9  m coude feed telescope and spectrograph setup as the @xcite observations at kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) .",
    "these observations were obtained with the purpose of determining the absorption - line profile of the llcc as accurately as possible at higher s / n and velocity resolution than the stis observations .",
    "the new exposures were reduced in the same manner as the earlier data and summed with these data to achieve final spectra with significantly enhanced s / n ratios at a measured velocity resolution of 1.3  km  s@xmath14 . specifically , hd  83023 was observed for an additional 7  hr in 2009 january to produce a net na  i spectrum ( 10  hr total exposure ) characterized by a continuum s / n ratio of 320 .",
    "the high s / n ratio ( 340 ) of the final hd  84722 spectrum ( 14.75  hr total exposure ) was achieved through new exposures spanning 12.75  hr in 2007 january and 2008 march .",
    "hd  85259 was observed for an additional 9  hr in 2008 march and 2011 february to produce a net na  i spectrum ( 10  hr total exposure ) characterized by a s / n ratio of 250 .    in 2009 january , we also conducted new kpno na  i observations of the star hd  84937 to compare with the 2006 january measurements of @xcite and probe the small - scale na  i structure of the foreground llcc .",
    "this star is located behind the outer periphery of the llcc at a distance of 72.7@xmath26  pc and it is distinguished by a very large proper motion of 0.860  arcsec  yr@xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the new exposures of hd  84937 ( 9  hr net integration ) were reduced in the same manner as the earlier data ( 4.5  hr net integration ) and the resultant summed spectra both have s / n ratios of 100 at a velocity resolution of 1.3  km  s@xmath14 .",
    "hd  84937 was not selected as a uv interstellar absorption target for our stis observations due to its late spectral type ( f5 ) and faintness ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "in modeling their multi - star observations of the na  i absorption - line profiles corresponding to the llcc , @xcite found that a single - component solution provided an excellent fit to the data .",
    "our significantly higher s / n observations of the llcc na  i d@xmath23 and d@xmath25 profiles toward hd  83023 , hd  85259 , and hd  84722 shown in figures  1 , 2 , and 3 indicate that a double - component fit is more appropriate .",
    "the fits to these profiles were made with the fits6p iterative voigt - profile fitting program @xcite and took into account the hyperfine splitting of the na  i  d lines ( @xmath28v  @xmath16  1.05  km  s@xmath14 ) .",
    "table  1 lists the resulting na  i column densities , line widths ( b - values ) , and lsr velocities for both the single- and double - component models of the measured line profiles .",
    "the double - component fits are characterized by a very narrow dominant core superposed on a much broader , shallower component with a central velocity offset of no more than 0.4  km  s@xmath14 .",
    "due to its high s / n ratio , moderate na  i line strength , and modest component separation , the hd  83023 spectrum provides the most accurate measure of the line width ( b  @xmath16  0.24@xmath120.01  km  s@xmath14 ) of the narrow na  i component .",
    "this b - value was adopted for the stronger narrow na  i components toward hd  85259 and hd  84722 in optimizing the double - component fits to their na  i profiles .    in the case of the broader",
    "secondary na  i component , there are also hints of this feature in other llcc sightlines observed by @xcite , but nothing definitive due to the lower s / n ratio of their data . however , as shown in figure  4 , our re - observation of hd  84937 yields a net spectrum of sufficiently enhanced s / n ( 140 ) to provide further evidence of this secondary na  i component .",
    "the existence of a weak broader component at nearly the same velocity as that of the narrow llcc na  i absorption toward multiple background targets suggests that the clouds responsible for these features may be related .",
    "furthermore , we detect this broader component in the spectra of hd  84722 ( 84.8  pc ) and hd  84937 ( 72.7  pc ) which are both located inside the local bubble . among the llcc background stars observed by @xcite , none within 157  pc exhibits the additional na  i components seen ( at lsr velocities ranging from -11.5 to -1.5  km  s@xmath14 ) toward some of their more distant stars .",
    "meyer et al .",
    "interpret this additional na  i absorption as arising from the neutral gas boundary of the local bubble at a distance between 100 and 150  pc in the direction of the llcc .",
    "interestingly , @xcite also find that a double - component solution provides the best fit to their h  i 21  cm emission - line observations of the llcc . in table  1",
    ", we list the h  i column densities , line widths ( b - values ) , and lsr velocities derived from their optically - thin , two - component fits to the llcc h  i emission observed at 4@xmath13 resolution toward hd  83023 , hd  85259 , and hd  84722 ( no llcc h  i emission was detected toward hd  84937 ) . in comparing the na  i and h  i measurements in these sightlines ,",
    "it is important to note that the 4  arcmin h  i emission - line beam is much larger than the 10@xmath29  arcsec na  i absorption - line beam . also , as a trace neutral , na  i ( ionization potential of 5.14  ev ) is not the dominant ion of na in h  i clouds",
    "consequently , the column density of na  i is a function of both the h  i column and environmental parameters such as the cloud temperature , electron density , and radiation field governing the na ionization equilibrium . nevertheless ,",
    "as compared to na  i observations of other galactic h  i clouds @xcite , the stronger llcc components toward hd  83023 , hd  85259 , and hd  84722 all have among the highest na  i columns measured in such low n(h  i ) sightlines .",
    "since the recombination of trace neutrals scales with cloud temperature as @xmath30 for a given n(h  i ) and constant pressure @xcite , such high na  i columns would be expected in an h  i cloud as cold as the llcc .",
    "assuming that the turbulent na  i and h  i motions in the stronger llcc components are similar , a comparison of the na  i ( 0.24  km  s@xmath14 ) and h  i ( mean value of 0.59  km  s@xmath14 ) linewidths through the expression @xmath31 yields a cloud kinetic temperature of 18  k and a one - dimensional rms turbulent velocity ( @xmath32 ) of 0.16  km  s@xmath14 .    the principal differences between the llcc na  i and h  i profiles lie in the weaker of the two fitted components . in all three sightlines , the weaker na",
    "i component is much broader than the weaker h  i component .",
    "furthermore , the velocity separations between the stronger and weaker components are greater for h  i than na  i and the column density differences between the components are more pronounced in the na  i fits than those for h  i. the most likely explanation for these differences are that the weaker na  i and h  i components are not sampling the same parcels of gas . in the case of the weaker na  i",
    "component , its low column and broad width would make the corresponding h  i emission difficult to detect in the @xcite data .",
    "such a weak h  i feature would have a fwhm of @xmath013  km  s@xmath14 and blend in with the broad red wing of the h  i emission associated with the neutral gas boundary of the local bubble . @xcite",
    "interpret the similarly narrow h  i components in their two - component fits to the llcc h  i profile as arising from two colliding clouds . in this picture , the absence of na  i absorption corresponding to the lower h  i column cloud could reflect an environmental factor such as a lower electron density . alternatively , the narrow na  i absorption could arise from high - density gas at the collision interface between the two clouds . in either case , the broad na  i component could arise from warmer diffuse gas associated with the two h  i clouds or the post - shock material just outside the cold interface layer .",
    "the stis observations of the llcc c  i absorption toward hd  85259 and hd  83023 support the two - component solution to the optical na  i profiles .",
    "as illustrated in figures  5 and 6 , spectra of the 1329    multiplet reveal significant c  i absorption arising from each of the j = 0 , 1 , 2 fine - structure states toward both hd  85259 and hd  83023 . in the case of hd  85259 ,",
    "the c  i lines are strong enough and the spectral s / n ratio is high enough to fully utilize the c  i multiplets centered near 1277 and 1280    along with the 1329   data in measuring the c  i , c  i * , and c  i * * profiles and column densities .",
    "the best simultaneous fits6p fit to these data yields a two - component solution for the c  i profile characterized by a dominant narrow ( b  @xmath16  0.4@xmath120.1  km  s@xmath14 ) component and a weaker broad ( b  @xmath16  2.6@xmath120.4  km  s@xmath14 ) component with the same velocity separation as the na  i profile fit .",
    "the c  i * and c  i * * profiles were fit by a single component with the same b - value as the narrow c  i component . in the case of hd  83023 ,",
    "the low s / n ratio ( @xmath3325 ) of its stis spectra shortward of 1300    makes the c  i 1277 and 1280    multiplets of limited utility in fitting the c  i , c  i * , and c  i * * profiles .",
    "nevertheless , we find that a two - component solution consisting of a narrow ( b  @xmath16  0.4  km  s@xmath14 ) component and a weaker broad ( b  @xmath16  3.1@xmath120.6  km  s@xmath14 ) component with the same velocity separation as the na  i fit provides an excellent fit to the llcc c  i absorption toward hd  83023 . as in the case of hd  85259 ,",
    "the c  i * and c  i * * profiles toward hd  83023 are also best fit by a single narrow component with a b - value of 0.4  km  s@xmath14",
    ". figures  5 and 6 display all of these fits along with the observed profiles near 1329   .",
    "the resultant c  i , c  i * , and c  i * * column densities for both the narrow and broad llcc components toward hd  85259 and hd  83023 are listed in table  2 .",
    "these column densities were calculated using the updated c  i oscillator strengths determined by @xcite .",
    "in addition to c  i , the stis spectra reveal weak llcc absorption arising from other trace neutrals such as s  i , mg  i , and cl  i. figures  7 and 8 compare the s  i @xmath241425.030 , mg  i @xmath242026.477 , and cl  i @xmath241347.240 profiles to those of c  i and na  i toward hd  85259 and hd  83023 . the c  i @xmath241276.483 and @xmath241280.135 profiles illustrated in figures  7 and 8 are",
    "respectively the weakest c  i lines detected in the hd  85259 and hd  83023 spectra and are fit with the same two - component solutions shown for the strong c  i @xmath241328.833 line in figures  5 and 6 .",
    "there is no evidence of a broad component in the weak s  i , mg  i , and cl  i absorption toward either star .",
    "these lines were all fit using a single component with the same b - value ( 0.4  km  s@xmath14 ) as the narrow c  i component .",
    "the resultant s  i , mg  i , and cl  i column densities are listed in table  2 . given the weakness of the lines , these column densities are relatively insensitive to the profile fit .",
    "they were derived utilizing the s  i , mg  i , and cl  i oscillator strengths compiled by @xcite .",
    "figures  9 and 10 compare the interstellar absorption profile of cl  i with those of the dominant ions s  ii , cr  ii , ni  ii , and zn  ii plus that of the excited fine - structure fraction of c  ii ( c  ii * ) toward hd  85259 and hd  83023 .",
    "the c  ii * and dominant ion profiles clearly exhibit multiple velocity components at lsr velocities blueward of the narrow llcc absorption benchmarked by cl  i. these blue components are especially strong toward hd  85259 and are detectable in its na  i spectrum ( see figure  7 ) . as discussed earlier , these components presumably arise from clouds associated with the neutral gas boundary of the local bubble through which hd  85259 and hd  83023 are distant enough to sample in absorption .",
    "although the stis spectrum of the nearer star hd  84722 is more limited in wavelength coverage and s / n ratio , it does tend to support this interpretation . specifically , as shown in figure  11 , the zn  ii @xmath342026.136 , 2062.664 doublet observed toward hd  84722 does not exhibit the strong components seen blueward of the llcc absorption toward hd  85259 and hd  83023 . at the same time , there is a hint of zn  ii absorption corresponding to a very weak na  i component seen at @xmath35  @xmath16  -8.1  km  s@xmath14 in the high s / n optical spectrum of hd  84722 .",
    "whether this component is associated with the llcc , the hd  84722 environment , or somewhere in between , it most likely arises from gas inside the local bubble . in general ,",
    "due to their velocity separation , the strong non - llcc components are typically not a major complication in fitting the llcc portion of the dominant ion profiles toward hd  85259 and hd  83023 .",
    "the llcc s  ii , cr  ii , ni  ii , zn  ii , and c  ii * column densities derived from these fits ( using f - values from @xcite for ni  ii and from @xcite for s  ii , cr  ii , zn  ii , and c  ii * ) are tabulated in table  2 .    among the dominant ion lines observed toward hd  85259 and hd  83023 , the zn",
    "ii doublet provides the best profile model of the llcc absorption due to its modest strength and saturation . in the case of hd  85259 ,",
    "its llcc zn  ii absorption is well fit by a single narrow component with a b - value of 0.4@xmath120.1  km  s@xmath14 .",
    "in contrast , the weaker llcc zn  ii absorption toward hd  83023 is best fit with a two - component model consisting of a narrow ( b  @xmath16  0.4  km  s@xmath14 ) core and a shallower broad ( b  @xmath16  2.8  km  s@xmath14 ) component with the same velocity separation as its na  i and c  i fits . fitting the much stronger s  ii @xmath341250.584 , 1253.811 , 1259.519 triplet is more problematic , particularly for hd  83023 due to the low s / n ratio of its far - uv spectrum .",
    "nevertheless , we find that the best fits to the llcc s  ii absorption toward hd  85259 and hd  83023 both require a narrow and a broad component . due to the saturation of the narrow component , these fits are relatively insensitive to its column density .",
    "consequently , we adopted a b - value of 0.4  km  s@xmath14 for this s  ii component toward both stars and fixed its column density based on the measured zn  ii columns , the solar s / zn elemental abundance ratio ( log(s / zn )  @xmath16  2.56 ) @xcite , and a zn depletion into dust of 0.1  dex relative to s @xcite .",
    "the resulting s  ii column densities listed in table  2 for the broad llcc component were determined using fits with the same component separations as the na  i and c  i models . in the case of the strong c  ii * @xmath241335.708 ( f  @xmath16  0.115 ) absorption toward hd  85859 and hd  83023 , a double - component llcc solution with a narrow saturated core is also warranted . unfortunately , the adjacent c  ii * @xmath241335.663 ( f  @xmath16  0.0128 ) line does not provide much of a fitting constraint on the column density of this narrow component due to its blend with the strong non - llcc @xmath241335.708 components",
    ". thus , the resulting column densities listed in table  2 for the narrow llcc c  ii * components toward hd  85259 and hd  83023 are very uncertain .",
    "with excitation energies ( @xmath36 ) of 23.6 and 62.4  k , the j  @xmath16  1 and j  @xmath16  2 fine - structure states of c  i are predominantly populated through collisions with hydrogen atoms in cold interstellar h  i clouds .",
    "since the collision rates are a function of the h  i density and temperature , the measured c  i excitation reflects the thermal gas pressure of these clouds .",
    "the most thorough analysis to date of the c  i fine - structure excitation in the galactic interstellar medium has been carried out by @xcite who show that this excitation quickly equilibrates to its environmental pressure on a timescale of less than one year . utilizing high - resolution _ hst _ stis observations of the far - uv c  i multiplets",
    ", they measure the c  i , c  i * , and c  i * * column densities as a function of velocity in the interstellar absorption - line profiles of 89  stars . building upon the smaller sample of their earlier work @xcite ,",
    "@xcite calculate the thermal pressures of 2416 parcels of interstellar gas based on these column densities .",
    "following the approach of @xcite , they utilize the quantities @xmath37(c  i*)/@xmath38(c  i@xmath39 ) and @xmath40(c  i**)/@xmath38(c  i@xmath39 ) to relate the measured c  i excitation to a grid of derived gas pressures as a function of cloud temperature .",

    "these curves were calculated in a manner similar to that of @xcite using the same collision , radiative decay , and optical pumping rates along with the average stellar radiation field appropriate for the solar vicinity @xcite . as noted by @xcite ,",
    "the ( @xmath44 ,  @xmath45 ) values are relatively insensitive to uncertainties in the radiation field when the pressure is greater than 10,000  @xmath1  k. given that the llcc has a temperature of @xmath020  k , figure  12 clearly indicates that its gas pressure toward both hd  85259 and hd  83023 is well in excess of 10,000  @xmath1  k. specifically , the hd  83023 data point falls 1.6@xmath46 above the 20  k curve at a pressure of 40,000  @xmath1  k and that of hd  85259 falls 1.8@xmath46 below the 20  k curve at a pressure of 80,000  @xmath1  k. their weighted mean ( @xmath44 ,  @xmath45 ) value falls almost exactly on the 20  k curve at a pressure of 60,000  @xmath1  k. in contrast , the vast majority of the @xcite data points have ( @xmath44 ,  @xmath45 ) values that place them above and/or left of the theoretical curves for individual clouds .",
    "they interpret these values as arising from mixtures of low - pressure and high - pressure c  i components in their long - path sightlines that unresolvably overlap in velocity . in the cases of hd  83023 and hd  85259 , the narrow llcc c  i component stands out in the spectra of these nearby stars with an excitation that closely matches the theoretical expectations for a very cold , highly - pressurized cloud .",
    "such conditions are very rare among the 2416 c  i parcels sampled by @xcite - less than 1@xmath3 of these clouds have ( @xmath44 ,  @xmath45 ) excitation values corresponding to temperatures less than 30  k and pressures greater than 10,000  @xmath1  k.    the highly - pressurized nature of the llcc is particularly intriguing given its location deep inside the local bubble .",
    "as reviewed by @xcite and @xcite , the pressure balance of interstellar gas in this environment has long been a contentious issue .",
    "since the discovery of the diffuse soft x - ray background in the 1970s , numerous studies through the 1990s interpreted it in terms of hot gas filling the local bubble with a pressure somewhere between 10,000 and 20,000  @xmath1  k. yet , studies of cooler clouds within the bubble have consistently yielded pressures below these values .",
    "@xcite utilized _ hst _ c  i observations to constrain the thermal pressures of four clouds inside or near the edge of the local bubble to values between 1000 and 10,000  @xmath1  k. @xcite measured the temperatures of 50 warm , partially - ionized clouds within the bubble and determined their mean thermal pressure to be 2300  @xmath1  k. recently , measurements of the foreground x - ray emission from solar wind charge exchange @xcite and the @xcite finding of weak x - ray shadowing by the llcc have weakened the case for a higher - pressure hot local bubble . although some hot gas is undoubtedly present , its thermal pressure is most likely in a range ( 3000 to 7000  @xmath1  k ) consistent with that of the warm clouds @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the much higher mean llcc pressure of 60,000  @xmath1  k measured toward hd  83023 and hd  85259 clearly indicates that the llcc is not in thermal pressure equilibrium with either the hot gas or the warm clouds in the local bubble .",
    "given the llcc temperature of @xmath020  k and a typical h  i column density of @xmath010@xmath47  @xmath9 , this pressure corresponds to a cloud with a density of @xmath03000  @xmath1 and a thickness of @xmath0200  au ( @xmath00.001  pc ) .",
    "note that even for such a thin cloud , the c  i excitation equilibrates to the cloud pressure on a timescale ( @xmath33  1  yr ) that is much shorter than the llcc s line - of - sight turbulent crossing time ( @xmath06000  yr ) .",
    "our finding that the llcc is significantly overpressured with respect to the local bubble is qualitatively consistent with predictions that the llcc and its anomalously low temperature could be the result of a warm cloud collision @xcite .",
    "in their one - dimensional numerical simulations of the large - scale transonic ( mach  number  @xmath6  1 ) compression of colliding warm gas flows , @xcite find that a thin cold layer forms within the shocked interface .",
    "this layer is characterized by a temperature of @xmath625  k , pressure of @xmath66650  @xmath1  k , thickness of @xmath60.03  pc , and h  column density of @xmath6@xmath48  @xmath9 after @xmath61  myr of evolution . in general , the numerical models of @xcite show that the cold , dense gas at the collision interface is overpressured with respect to the infalling warm gas by factors of 1.5 to 5 .",
    "in contrast , the c  i excitation measured toward hd  83023 and hd  85259 indicates that the llcc is overpressured by a factor of @xmath030 with respect to the warm clouds in the local bubble .",
    "such a large discrepancy provides a significant challenge toward quantitatively understanding the llcc in a colliding cloud context .",
    "a key consideration in achieving an llcc - type pressure through a warm cloud collision is the velocity differential between the colliding clouds since the pressure of the cold interface layer should balance the total ( thermal plus ram ) pressure of the converging flows . in their analytical model of two oppositely - directed warm gas streams ( with @xmath49  k and @xmath50",
    "@xmath1 ) , @xcite find that an inflow mach number of 3.7 is required of each stream relative to the interface layer to produce a pressure of 60,000  @xmath1  k in that layer .",
    "such an inflow would correspond to a velocity difference of 60  km  s@xmath14 between the streams given an 8.4  km  s@xmath14 sound speed in the 7100  k gas . in terms of radial velocity",
    ", there is no evidence of warm clouds in the llcc vicinity with such a large velocity differential . in figure  13",
    ", we compare the h  i  21  cm emission and the c  ii @xmath241334.532 absorption in the hd  85259 and hd  83023 sightlines .",
    "this strong c  ii line is a very sensitive tracer of both warm and cold interstellar gas due to its high @xmath51-value , the abundance of c , and the c  ii ionization potential ( 24.38 ev ) .",
    "the maximum velocity width of the single saturated c  ii @xmath241334.532 absorption feature observed toward hd  83023 and hd  85259 is about 35  km  s@xmath14 .",
    "the absence of any other c  ii absorption lines in these spectra indicates that there are no foreground warm cloud pairs in the llcc vicinity with hydrogen column densities greater than 10@xmath52  @xmath9 and a radial velocity differential greater than 35  km  s@xmath14 .",
    "as noted by @xcite , the llcc sky position is near the boundaries of the nearby gem , leo , and aur warm clouds .",
    "although the leo and aur clouds both have radial velocities similar to that of the llcc , the gem cloud s radial motion is only faster by 12  km  s@xmath14 .",
    "furthermore , the upper limits on the distances of the gem , leo , and aur clouds are all below the lower bound ( 11.26@xmath120.21  pc ) on the llcc distance @xcite .",
    "other factors may help to provide a better match of the observed llcc pressure with that expected in a colliding flow scenario .",
    "for example , the colliding warm clouds might have a significant difference in their transverse velocities . given the measured radial velocity gradient along the long cold cloud ribbon centered on the llcc @xcite",
    ", @xcite has calculated a transverse llcc lsr velocity of 16  km  s@xmath14 based on a ring model of the cloud ribbon .",
    "although this value is not a serious constraint on the transverse velocity differential of any parent warm cloud collision , it is four times greater than the radial llcc lsr velocity .",
    "other factors to consider are the temperature and density of the warm clouds themselves .",
    "if the temperature assumed by @xcite is decreased with a corresponding increase of the density ( to maintain the same warm cloud pressure ) , the velocity flow differential needed to produce a pressure of 60,000  @xmath1  k in the cold interface layer is reduced by the square root of the temperature reduction factor .",
    "although such adjustments and transverse component considerations can close the gap , there is no question that the observed radial velocity constraints are a key hurdle toward fully understanding the high llcc pressure in terms of a warm cloud collision .",
    "it is also important to note that the peak llcc h  i column density would require warm source clouds of appreciably higher column density than any previously identified in the nearby local bubble .",
    "although the broad absorption component seen in our na i and uv spectra attests to an appreciable column of warm gas in the llcc sightlines , it could be associated with post - shock gas just outside the 20  k interface layer rather than the warmer source clouds .",
    "a common feature of the colliding warm flow models @xcite is the turbulent fragmentation of the cold interface layer into clumpy structures .",
    "some of the simulations @xcite have shown that localized regions within these structures can reach pressures up to 10@xmath53  @xmath1  k even when the collision is transonic @xcite .",
    "it is quite likely that the different c  i llcc pressures measured toward hd  83023 ( 40,000  @xmath1  k ) and hd  85259 ( 80,000  @xmath1  k ) ( both assuming @xmath54  @xmath16  20",
    "k ) are due in part to real localized pressure variations rather than measurement errors alone .",
    "both sightlines are located on the periphery of the llcc ( 4.4@xmath7 ( 1.4  pc ) apart ) with h  i column densities that are more than 10 times below the peak interior value .",
    "given the narrowness of their c  i absorption beams and the pressure - implied thinness of their cloud regions , the hd  83023 and hd  85259 sightlines clearly provide extremely - localized pressure samples of the llcc .",
    "consequently , the agreement of their significant overpressures within a factor of two argues for a large - scale llcc explanation like a warm cloud collision . at the same time , the turbulent fragmentation expected in the wake of such a collision could push these localized overpressures above the limiting values implied by the measured velocity constraints on the colliding clouds .      the abundance and elemental composition of dust in diffuse interstellar clouds can be estimated by comparing the gas - phase column density ratios of various dominant ions measured from their uv absorption lines to a set of reference elemental abundance ratios such as the solar values . as reviewed by @xcite",
    ", a number of interstellar uv studies have shown that some elements such as zn are only weakly depleted from the gas phase into dust grains while others such as ni and cr exhibit strong depletions .",
    "recently , @xcite has systematically analyzed the dust depletion patterns of 17 elements based on uv absorption - line measurements toward 243 stars and the @xcite solar reference abundances .",
    "he interprets the depletion of each element relative to hydrogen in terms of a `` line - of - sight depletion strength factor '' ( @xmath55 ) applicable to all of the elements in a given sightline plus two other element - specific parameters .",
    "@xmath55 is a dimensionless parameter that jenkins has normalized to equal 0.0 for the lowest collective depletions in his sample and to equal 1.0 for the strong depletions observed in the cold @xmath56  oph cloud that has long been considered the prototype for the cold neutral medium .",
    "the @xcite results allow us to analyze the measurements of the llcc gas - phase elemental abundances and interpret their dust depletion in the comparative context of a large sample of other galactic sightlines . in our analysis ,",
    "the cold hydrogen gas comprising the llcc is entirely in the form of h  i ( we show in @xmath574.4 that the h@xmath23 concentration is very low ) and the llcc column density ratios of dominant ions are taken to reflect their gas - phase elemental abundance ratios .",
    "as listed in table  2 , the zn  ii and ni  ii lines observed toward hd  85259 provide the best - measured dominant ion column densities from our stis spectra for the gas associated with the narrow llcc absorption component . since ni is depleted much more strongly into dust than zn , the logarithmic ratio of their column densities relative to the solar ni / zn abundance ratio yields a relative depletion [ ni / zn ]  @xmath16  log(n(ni  ii)/n(zn  ii ) )  @xmath58  log(ni / zn)@xmath59 that is very sensitive to the depletion strength factor @xmath55 . although such elemental comparisons can be compromised by photoionization to higher ionization stages in sightlines with h  i columns below 10@xmath60  @xmath9 like hd  85259 and hd  83023 @xcite , it is unlikely in the case of ni ii and zn ii since they have nearly identical ionization potentials .",
    "the corresponding value of -1.18@xmath120.10 for [ ni / zn ] in the hd  85259 sightline indicates a factor of @xmath55  @xmath16  0.2@xmath120.1 for the llcc . in the case of hd  83023 ,",
    "the 2@xmath46 upper limit on its llcc ni  ii column density leads to an upper limit on [ ni / zn ] that is too large to seriously constrain @xmath55 .",
    "since cr is also depleted more strongly into dust than zn , the [ cr / zn ] ratio can provide an additional indicator of @xmath55 .",
    "unfortunately , our measurements of the cr  ii column density in the llcc consist only of a marginal result toward hd  85259 and upper limits toward hd  83023 and hd  84722 . nevertheless , the resulting [ cr / zn ] values of -1.47@xmath120.28 , @xmath33 - 1.05@xmath120.15 , and @xmath33 - 1.48@xmath120.16 for the llcc in the hd  85259 , hd  83023 , and hd",

    "such a pattern would support the idea that the llcc is the product of a warm cloud collision . whether or not the collision itself disrupts some grain material into the gas phase ,",
    "the llcc should not exhibit higher dust depletions than the warm clouds feeding it .",

    "although there is no evidence of another narrow component in the zn ii profiles corresponding to the weaker of the two closely - spaced 21  cm components , the stis spectra are not definitive in this regard due to their lower velocity resolution .",
    "however , for the broad secondary llcc component observed in na  i and c  i , the stis data do provide well - measured column densities of s  ii and zn  ii toward hd  83023 and of s  ii toward hd  85259 .",
    "the s  ii and zn  ii columns are particularly interesting to compare because both s and zn are weakly depleted into grains in diffuse clouds @xcite .",
    "assuming that zn is depleted into dust by 0.1  dex with respect to s @xcite and that none of the hydrogen in the broad component cloud is ionized , the value of log  n(s  ii)/n(zn  ii ) in the cloud should equal 2.66 . in the case of the hd  83023 sightline ,",
    "the measured value of this logarithmic column density ratio is 3.00@xmath120.09 .",
    "this enhancement of the s  ii abundance relative to that of zn could reflect a partial ionization of hydrogen in the broad component cloud .",
    "since s  ii ( 23.34  ev ) has a higher ionization potential than zn  ii ( 17.96  ev ) , the ionized fraction of the cloud could raise the net n(s  ii)/n(zn  ii ) ratio above that expected from the neutral fraction .",
    "such a possibility would be consistent with the idea of the broad llcc component arising from warm post - shock gas or one of the colliding warm clouds producing the llcc . given the n(s  ii)/n(zn  ii ) ratio observed for the broad component toward hd  83023 , the non - detection of the corresponding zn  ii component toward hd  85259 is consistent with its lower s  ii column density .      given how the llcc stands out among diffuse clouds in terms of its temperature and gas pressure , an evaluation of its electron density provides another key parameter for comparison . as reviewed by @xcite , the electron density of a diffuse h  i cloud",

    "although this electron density leads to a value of @xmath68/@xmath72 ( @xmath00.003 ) that is consistent with those of other diffuse clouds @xcite , it is @xmath0100 times greater than the mean llcc electron density determined from the photoionization balance of c , s , na , and mg .",

    "@xmath16  0.1  @xmath1 and utilizing a rate constant of k  @xmath16  7@xmath7310@xmath81  @xmath79  s@xmath14 for the reaction between cl  ii and h@xmath23 @xcite , the required h@xmath23 density would be 1.5  @xmath1 .",
    "this h@xmath23 density is certainly modest in comparison to the hydrogen density ( @xmath72  @xmath0  4000  @xmath1 ) measured from the c  i fine - structure excitation and would indicate an llcc h@xmath23 column density of @xmath03@xmath7310@xmath74  @xmath9 in the hd  85259 sightline .",
    "the modest llcc h@xmath23 column density inferred from the cl ionization balance toward hd  85259 is consistent with the lack of ultraviolet co absorption in this sightline .",
    "specifically , we measure a 2@xmath46 upper limit of 2.5@xmath7310@xmath76  @xmath9 on the co column density based on the absence of the [ a - x](4 - 0)r(0 ) @xmath241419.044 line in our stis spectra of hd  85259 .",
    "the interstellar co / h@xmath23 column density ratio has been found to vary from @xmath010@xmath29 for dense clouds to @xmath010@xmath83 for translucent clouds to @xmath010@xmath87 for diffuse clouds @xcite .",
    "even with the assumption of the highest of these values for the llcc , the inferred h@xmath23 column density toward hd  85259 implies a co column density ( @xmath03@xmath7310@xmath86  @xmath9 ) that is well below our stis upper limit .",
    "a key implication of the high llcc gas pressures measured toward hd  85259 and hd  83023 is that the densest region of the cloud must be very thin . in the case of the hd  85259 sightline , a comparison of the pressure - inferred hydrogen volume density ( @xmath72  @xmath0  4000  @xmath1 ) and the measured h  i column density yields an llcc h  i thickness of @xmath0200  au .",
    "however , it is important to note that the spatial distribution of trace neutrals like c  i in diffuse clouds is not likely to match that of h  i. as discussed by @xcite , since trace neutrals are biased by the recombination rates to form most abundantly near the peaks of the hydrogen density distribution within a cloud , their abundances will fluctuate more strongly on smaller length scales than those of h  i and dominant ions . consequently , in the presence of a sharp density peak , the llcc gas pressure measured by the c  i fine - structure excitation toward hd  85259 would be more representative of the density peak where c  i is most abundant than that of the full h  i extent of the llcc .",
    "in other words , the c  i thickness of the llcc toward hd  85259 could be somewhat less than 200  au while the h  i thickness could be appreciably greater .",
    "if the trace neutral `` layer '' is indeed this thin , one would expect to observe column density fluctuations in the trace neutrals on very small transverse scales across the llcc .",
    "testing for such solar - system - scale structure is possible through multi - epoch na  i absorption - line observations of high proper - motion background stars .",
    "as reviewed by @xcite , about 15@xmath3 of the 40 diffuse cloud sightlines studied for temporal na  i absorption variations have revealed evidence for structure on scales of 50  au or less .",
    "the sightlines exhibiting such variations appear to be preferentially associated with intervening h  i shells .",
    "variations in dominant ion absorption on these scales have been observed in only one case to date  -  the cpd  -59  2603 sightline through the carina nebula @xcite . among the clouds exhibiting solar - system - scale na  i structure , those in the sightlines toward hd  32040 @xcite , @xmath88  leo @xcite , and hd",
    "219188 @xcite have been evaluated through observations of their c  i fine - structure excitation .",
    "the derived pressures of these clouds range from 2000  @xmath1  k to an upper limit of 20,000  @xmath1  k with inferred hydrogen densities ( @xmath72 ) between 20  @xmath1 and 200  @xmath1 . in the case of the hd  219188 cloud",
    ", @xcite was able to measure the c  i excitation multiple times with _",
    "hst _ over a 9 yr time span and found that @xmath72 increased from 20  @xmath1 to 45  @xmath1 as n(c  i ) and n(na  i ) increased over a transverse spatial scale somewhere between 10 and 200  au ( scale uncertainty due to unknown distance of the intervening cloud ) .",
    "based on these results and the lack of dominant ion differences , observations of temporal na  i variations have generally been interpreted as arising from solar - system - scale cloud fluctuations in @xmath72 and/or @xmath68 rather than in n(h  i ) .    among the 16 stars found by @xcite to exhibit narrow",
    "na  i absorption corresponding to the llcc , hd  84937 has by far the largest proper motion ( 0.860  arcsec  yr@xmath14 ) . in figure  14",
    ", we compare the initial 2006  january na  i spectrum of this star with that taken in 2009  january . while the broader stellar na  i absorption at @xmath35",
    "@xmath16  -21  km  s@xmath14 is identical in both spectra , the llcc na  i absorption exhibits a significant difference in strength between the two epochs .",
    "applying a two - component fit to the llcc na  i d@xmath23 and d@xmath25 profiles in both spectra ( similar to the hd  85259 , hd  83023 , and hd  84722 fits ) , we find that this difference is entirely associated with the narrow llcc component . specifically , the na  i column density corresponding to this component increases by 40@xmath3 from 2006 ( 1.24@xmath120.07@xmath7310@xmath86  @xmath9 ) to 2009 ( 1.72@xmath120.08@xmath7310@xmath86  @xmath9 ) .",
    "assuming a distance of 17.8  pc for the llcc ( midway between the @xmath1911.3  pc and @xmath3324.3  pc constraints of @xcite ) , this three - year increase in n(na  i ) toward hd  84937 occurred over a transverse distance of 46  au across the cloud .",
    "this detection of solar - system - scale na  i structure is uniquely accurate in scale in that it is based on a dominant well - measured stellar proper motion ( the modeled llcc proper motion @xcite is much smaller ) and a well - constrained cloud distance ( the quoted scales in previous cases have been mostly upper limits based on the background star distances ) . in contrast , there is no convincing evidence of temporal na  i absorption variations in our multi - epoch observations of hd  85259 , hd  83023 , and hd  84722 .",
    "however , the much smaller proper motions of these stars translate to respective transverse distances of only 1.4 , 2.2 , and 2.0  au across the llcc over the course of our observations .",
    "also , the greater strength of the llcc na  i lines in these sightlines as compared to those toward hd  84937 makes their equivalent widths less sensitive to comparable column density differences . nevertheless , the hd  84937 results provide ample motivation to continue monitoring the na  i absorption toward the highest proper motion llcc background stars among the @xcite sample .",
    "the detection of na  i structure on a scale of 46  au toward hd  84937 indicates that the trace neutrals in this llcc sightline are abundant in a very thin layer .",
    "it is thus consistent with the sharp density peak and sheet - like llcc geometry implied by the high gas pressures measured toward hd  85259 and hd  83023 . at the assumed 17.8  pc distance of the llcc , the hd  85259 and hd  83023 sightlines are separated by 1.4  pc ( 4.4@xmath7 ) , the hd  83023 and hd  84937 sightlines are separated by 1.0  pc ( 3.2@xmath7 ) , and the hd  85259 and hd  84937 sightlines are separated by 0.6  pc ( 2.0@xmath7 ) . given these separations , it certainly appears that the cold , highly - pressurized , low  n(h  i ) gas observed toward hd  85259 and hd  84937 is representative of the llcc and not a localized fluctuation within the cloud .",
    "understanding the global overpressure of the llcc gas with respect to the local bubble environment then requires either a non - equilibrium solution where the llcc is a transient phenomenon or something like the @xcite colliding - cloud model where the llcc can be sustained indefinitely as a thin , cold , dense interface between converging flows of warmer gas .    from a broader perspective , it is interesting that the coldest , densest , low - column - density interstellar cloud now known in the galaxy is located only @xmath020  pc away from the sun .",
    "it is either just a fortunate coincidence to have such an unusual cloud nearby for close study or a manifestation of a selection effect that works against detecting such clouds at greater distances . in support of the former , the characteristics of the llcc not only stand out in comparison with samples of many diffuse clouds ( such as the comprehensive c  i study of @xcite )",
    ", its overpressure could be interpreted in terms of a transient phenomenon . yet",
    ", @xcite have found evidence for a weak , but pervasive contribution from high - pressure ( log(@xmath43 )  @xmath19  5.5 ) , high - temperature ( @xmath54  @xmath19  80  k ) gas in their measured distribution of interstellar pressures . the weak admixture of this high-@xmath89 , high-@xmath90 gas stands out in their c  i ( @xmath89 , @xmath90 ) diagnostic plot by pulling the net ( @xmath89 , @xmath90 ) values of the measured gas parcels above the theoretical curves for the dominant lower pressure gas .",
    "it is important to note that a similar weak , pervasive admixture of high - pressure , low - temperature gas ( like that of the llcc ) would not stand out in the @xcite c  i diagnostics .",
    "this high-@xmath89 , low-@xmath90 gas would pull the net ( @xmath89 , @xmath90 ) values of the measured gas parcels to the right on slopes similar to that of the theoretical curves for individual clouds of lower pressure gas . in other words , it is possible that llcc - type clouds may not be uncommon in the galaxy .    in support of this possibility",
    ", it is vital to recognize that the radio , optical , and uv study of the nearby llcc has been aided by the modest interstellar gas background toward the galactic halo - identification of llccs at greater distances in the galactic disk would be greatly complicated by both foreground ( radio , optical , uv ) and background ( radio ) gas with overlapping velocity signatures . furthermore , despite its large angular size , the total h  i mass of the llcc is only @xmath01  m@xmath59 .",
    "a distant , similar - sized llcc would have a much less noticeable angular extent .",
    "for example , at 1000  pc , the llcc would cover only a 12@xmath13  @xmath73  2.5@xmath13 patch of sky .",
    "given the observation of solar - system - scale na  i structure toward hd  84937 , it is tempting to consider this characteristic as a potential llcc - type signature in the other sightlines where it has been observed .",
    "however , none of these sightlines have yet revealed c  i pressures as high as those measured in the llcc despite their preferential association with h  i shells .",
    "a key step toward a broader understanding of the llcc will come with the measurement of the distances , pressures , and structure of the other cold clouds comprising the 70@xmath7-long @xcite h  i ribbon stretching from gemini through leo to sextans .",
    "we are especially grateful to the referee , edward jenkins , whose detailed and constructive review was very helpful in improving the paper .",
    "we would also like to thank urmas haud for his calculation of the llcc transverse velocity , enrique vazquez - semadeni for his valuable comments on the manuscript , and daryl willmarth for his assistance with the kpno observations .",
