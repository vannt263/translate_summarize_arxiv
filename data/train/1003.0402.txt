    "the study of vortex filament motion in an ideal fluid , and in particular of vortex rings in presence or absence of periodic displacements of the vortex axis from the circular shape ( kelvin waves ) , dates back to the late 1800s @xcite . despite its long history ,",
    "this study is still an active area of research @xcite .",
    "for example , the fact that upon large amplitude kelvin waves vortex rings can slow down and even reverse their translational motion has been recognised only recently @xcite . alongside the traditional interest for problems in classical fluid mechanics ,",
    "additional interest is motivated by current work on superfluid helium @xcite and atomic bose - einstein condensates @xcite .    here",
    "we shall be concerned with slightly more complex vortex structures ; namely vortex filaments in the shape of torus knots and unknots in an ideal fluid . since these vortices are closely related to circular vortex filaments with small - amplitude distortions lying on a mathematical torus , like vortex",
    "rings they propagate in the fluid by self - induction along the central axis of the torus , and they also rotate in their meridian plane ( the poloidal plane of the torus ) as their vortex core spins around the local center of mass , inducing an additional twisting motion of the vortex on itself , that can not be neglected .    among all possible knot types ,",
    "torus knots constitute a special family of knots amenable to particularly simple mathematical description .",
    "these knots can be described by closed curves wound on a mathematical torus a number of times in the longitudinal direction of the torus and a number of times in the meridian direction .",
    "if these two numbers are co - prime integers greater than one , then we have standard torus knots ( see figure  [ knots ] ) , whereas if the curve winds the torus only once in one of the two directions , then the curve is simply unknotted ( see figure  [ unknots ] ) , reducing to the standard circle when both numbers coincide with one . even though torus unknots have trivial topology , their geometry may be rather complex , taking the shape of toroidal or poloidal coil , depending along which direction the curve is multiply wound .    vortex torus knots and unknots provide a good example of structures that are relatively complex in space , but still amenable to study relationships between dynamical properties , like velocity and energy , and geometric and topological features , a step further towards the study of more complex structures present in turbulent flows .",
    "the aim of this paper is thus to continue and extend previous work @xcite to more complex vortex structures .",
    "here we shall investigate the propagation velocity and the kinetic energy of vortex torus knots and unknots in some generality , by comparing results to a standard vortex ring of same size .",
    "since superfluid @xmath3he has zero viscosity , thus providing a realistic example of an euler fluid , we shall choose circulation and vortex core radius as physically realistic quantities for quantized vortices in superfluid helium , and we shall carry out the research by direct numerical integration of the biot - savart law .",
    "unlike previous vortex dynamics calculations of quantized vorticity @xcite , however , we shall assume that no friction force @xcite acts on the superfluid vortices ; thus our results will apply to superfluid helium at temperatures below @xmath4 , where the dissipative effects of the normal fluid are truly negligible .",
    "we consider vortex motion in an ideal , incompressible fluid , in an unbounded domain .",
    "the velocity field @xmath5 , smooth function of the vector position @xmath6 and time @xmath7 , satisfies @xmath8 with vorticity @xmath9 defined by @xmath10 in absence of viscosity , fluid evolution is governed by the euler equations and vortex motion obeys helmholtz s conservation laws @xcite .",
    "transport of vorticity is given by @xmath11 admitting formal solutions in terms of the cauchy equations @xmath12 from this expression we can see how both convection of vorticity from the initial position @xmath13 to the final position @xmath6 , and the simultaneous rotation and distortion of the vortex elements by the deformation tensor @xmath14 are combined together . since this tensor is associated with a continuous deformation of the vortex elements ( by the diffeomorphism of the flow map ) , vorticity is thus mapped continuously from its initial configuration @xmath15 to the final state given by @xmath16 ; hence the cauchy equations establish a topological equivalence between initial and final configuration by preserving vorticity topology . in absence of dissipation ,",
    "physical properties such as kinetic energy , helicity and momenta are therefore conserved along with topological quantities such as knot type , minimum crossing number and self - linking number @xcite .",
    "the kinetic energy per unit density @xmath17 is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the fluid volume , and the kinetic helicity @xmath20 by @xmath21 here we assume to have only one vortex filament @xmath22 in isolation , where @xmath22 is centred on the curve @xmath23 of equation @xmath24 ( @xmath25 being the arc - length of @xmath23 ) .",

    "vortex motion is governed by the biot - savart law ( bs for short ) given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the vortex circulation due to @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is a constant and @xmath35 the unit tangent to @xmath23 . since the biot - savart integral is a global functional of vorticity and geometry , analytical solutions in closed form other than the classical solutions associated with rectilinear , circular and helical geometry are very difficult to obtain .",

    "moreover , since the self - linking of the vortex filament is a topologically conserved quantity @xcite given by @xmath111 , where @xmath61 denotes total twist of the filament , then information on writhing provides direct information on total twist , by taking @xmath112 .",

    "let us consider results reported in the tables of figure  [ tableone ] and [ tabletwo ] and shown in figure  [ reconnection ] .    since our results concern both euler s and superfluid dynamics ,",
    "it is important to remark that superfluid vortices can reconnect with each other in absence of dissipation @xcite , whereas in the euler context vortex topology is conserved ; this important difference has been recently reviewed by barenghi @xcite .",

    "generic behaviors are found for the class of knots / unknots tested , and main results are presented by normalizing velocity and energy by the corresponding value of a standard vortex ring ( @xmath50 ) of same size and circulation .    in general , for @xmath1 ( where the number of longitudinal wraps is larger than that of meridian wraps ) the",
    "more complex the vortex structure is , the faster it moves , and both torus knots and toroidal coils move faster than @xmath50 . for @xmath2 ( where the relative number of meridian wraps dominates )",
    "all vortex structures move essentially as fast as @xmath50 , almost independently from their total twist .",
