    "synchrotron emission by shock accelerated particles is central to our understanding of explosive , high energy astrophysical phenomena , such as supernova remnants , jets from agn and quasars , plerionic nebulae , and @xmath12-ray burst ( grb ) afterglows .",
    "grb afterglows have provided an unprecedented opportunity for diagnosing the blast wave and attendant shock acceleration , because their brevity in the observer s time frame and ultrahigh lorentz factors allow rapid evolution of the synchrotron spectrum which can be observed over a wide span of wavelength regimes in real time .    the afterglow radiation of @xmath12-ray bursts ( grbs ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is naturally explained as due to synchrotron emission of electrons accelerated in relativistic collisionless shocks driven by the grb explosion into the medium surrounding the grb progenitor ( for reviews see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the energy released in the explosion leads to the formation of a diverging shock wave , which propagates into the ambient plasma . at sufficiently late time ( at times much longer than the burst duration )",
    "all the explosion energy is carried by the shocked ambient plasma ( vanishingly small fraction of the energy remains in the ejecta produced by the explosion ) .",
    "the radiation is believed to be produced by electrons of the ambient medium , which are accelerated to high energy as they pass through the diverging shock .",
    "the dynamics of a spherical shock wave is determined by the explosion energy @xmath0 , and by the surrounding medium number density @xmath1 .",
    "if the initial grb outflow is jet - like , an additional parameter , the jet opening angle @xmath13 , is required in order to specify the flow . for a given shock dynamics , the luminosity and spectrum of emitted radiation",
    "are then determined by the fractions @xmath2 and @xmath3 of shock thermal energy carried , respectively , by magnetic field and electrons , and by the shape of the electron distribution function .",
    "the fraction of explosion energy @xmath0 converted to thermal energy in the shock is determined by the hydrodynamics and is of order unity .",
    "the electron and magnetic field energy densities are therefore proportional to @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively .",
    "the electron distribution function is commonly assumed to be a power law of index @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the electron energy , above some minimum energy @xmath18 ( we use @xmath19 to denote single particle energy , and @xmath0 to denote the total flow energy ) .",
    "the processes of magnetic field generation and electron injection in collisionless shocks are not understood from basic principles and @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath18 can not at present be determined theoretically .",
    "rather , they are treated as free parameters of the model , constrained by observations .",
    "it is important to note here that @xmath18 is , in general , an independent parameter of the model .",
    "it is a function not only of @xmath3 , but also of the fraction @xmath4 of electrons assumed to be accelerated to beyond @xmath18 .",
    "it is commonly assumed , however , that @xmath20 , in which case @xmath18 is uniquely determined by the other model parameters .    the observed afterglow synchrotron spectra constrain @xmath21 , as is well known , and the break in the power law decay of afterglow flux is widely believed @xcite to establish the opening angle @xmath13 in terms of @xmath22 . under the assumption that _ all _ the ambient electrons were injected to beyond @xmath18 , i.e. @xmath20 , the remaining four parameters , @xmath23 , are fixed by the four observables @xmath24 ( the frequency of maximum intensity ) , @xmath25 ( the intensity at @xmath24 ) , @xmath26 ( the synchrotron cooling break ) , and @xmath27 ( the self - absorption frequency ) .",
    "the results that have been deduced about @xmath21 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , are consistent both with current knowledge and current ignorance about shock acceleration : in bursts where @xmath21 can be determined accurately ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath28 is inferred .",
    "this value is consistent with the theoretical value of @xmath21 derived for test particle acceleration in relativistic shocks via the first order fermi mechanism , assuming isotropic diffusion of particles in momentum space , @xmath29 obtained in numerical calculations @xcite , and @xmath30 obtained by a more recent analytic analysis @xcite .",
    "this value of @xmath21 is not consistent with test particle results for large angle scattering in relativistic shocks , which produce very hard spectra .",
    "it is , however , consistent with the value expected in the 100 mev -10 gev range by non - linear theory for cosmic ray - mediated shock @xcite . despite the agreement of the observed and theoretically derived values of @xmath21 , assuming isotropic diffusion , it should be kept in mind that questions remain about diffusive shock acceleration , particularly in regard to relativistic generalization and in regard to electron injection , and that there are alternative acceleration processes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is natural to hope that the values of @xmath2 , @xmath3 are universal since they are determined by the microphysics of the collisionless shock .",
    "the constancy of @xmath21 and of @xmath3 among different bursts is strongly supported by observations .",
    "universal values of @xmath21 and @xmath3 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , typically inferred from most optical afterglows , are also inferred from the clustering of explosion energies @xcite and from x - ray afterglow luminosity @xcite are inferred based on light curves , rather than spectra , and are sensitive to model assumptions ( e.g. they depend on the assumed radial dependence of the ambient medium density ) . ]",
    "the value of @xmath2 is less well constrained by observations .",
    "however , in cases where @xmath2 can be reliably constrained by multi waveband spectra , values close to equipartition are inferred ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "such high values for @xmath2 and @xmath3 are remarkable and beg for an explanation .",
    "the magnetic field required for allowing electron acceleration and emission of synchrotron radiation may conceivably be produced in the collisionless shock driven by the grb explosion by weibel instabilities or the like ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , or it may be that the accelerated particles mix with the magnetic field of the fireball itself .",
    "no less surprising is the conclusion by @xcite , that @xmath18 is close to @xmath33 and that the low frequency radio spectra imply that there are relatively few electrons in the decade or two just below @xmath18 .",
    "had the electrons been picked up by shock acceleration at some much lower energy than @xmath33 , the power law spectrum imparted by the shock acceleration would have extended down to much lower energies , and only a small minority of them would have made it to @xmath33 or higher . in the case of the crab nebula , for example , which contains perhaps the best - studied relativistic shock wave , this is indeed the case : most of the electrons in the nebula emit in the radio , and probably have lorentz factors of order @xmath34 , which is many orders of magnitude lower than @xmath33 and even about a factor of @xmath34 below @xmath35 .",
    "more will be said about his below .",
    "while this paper is not aimed at explaining this gaping difference between afterglows and the crab nebula , it motivates us to check the assumption that @xmath20 in the case of the former .    in any case , we are unable to determine from basic principles the efficiency of electron `` injection '' to beyond some threshold energy well beyond @xmath36 .",
    "even when the number of electrons beyond some injection threshold @xmath18 is known , we are unable to determine theoretically the fraction @xmath4 of total electrons that these high energy electrons represent .",
    "it is conceivable that a large fraction , @xmath37 , of the electron population do not participate at the acceleration process and remain well below @xmath18 .",
    "this is discussed in   [",
    "sec : degeneracy ] . in ",
    "[ sec : signatures ] we discuss observational signatures of the existence of such _ non - injected _ thermal electrons in grb - induced blast waves .",
    "our main results and their implications are summarized in   [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we discuss both the implications to grb phenomenology and the implications for the theory of collisionless shock acceleration , in particular in the context of constraints imposed by observations on astrophysical systems other than grbs .",
    "to clarify the issues involved in the electron `` injection '' problem let us consider the situation illustrated in figure  [ fig : dndg ] , which may arise for a relativistic shock propagating with lorentz factor @xmath38 ( or sub - relativistic shock propagating with velocity @xmath39 ) into a cold plasma of protons and electrons ( as may be the case for a shock driven by a grb explosion into the ism ) . in the shock frame , a cold stream of protons and electrons approaches the shock with lorentz factor @xmath12 ( velocity @xmath40 ) .",
    "the particles are being scattered at the shock front , resulting in a velocity distribution which is close to isotropic behind the shock , thus converting a large fraction of the kinetic energy of the incoming flow to thermal energy .",
    "isotropization of the electron and proton incoming flow would lead to a post shock proton `` temperature '' @xmath41 ( or @xmath42 ) , and to a post shock electron `` temperature '' @xmath43 ( or @xmath44 ) . in order for the electrons to gain a significant fraction of the post - shock thermal energy ,",
    "some process must couple them to the protons , and accelerate them to energy @xmath45 .",
    "this process is yet unknown , and we can not determine based on theoretical considerations what fraction of the electrons are being accelerated .",
    "thus , in addition to @xmath3 , the acceleration process must be described by ( at least ) one additional parameter , the fraction @xmath4 of accelerated electrons .",
    "we show here that afterglow observations imply @xmath46 in the relativistic phase and @xmath47 in the sub - relativistic phase , but do not allow one to determine @xmath4 .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , the energy distribution of electrons below the characteristic acceleration energy , @xmath18 , is constrained by radio observations .",
    "the slope of the radio afterglow spectrum observed in several cases ( e.g. fig . 1 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath48 , is consistent with that expected for radiation emitted by electrons at @xmath18 at frequencies well below their characteristic synchrotron frequency , which is somewhat below optical at the observation time ( typically of order days ) . in order for the emission from lower energy electrons , at @xmath49 , not to modify this spectrum , @xmath50 is required .",
    "a somewhat more stringent constraint may be obtained from the requirement that the self - absorption optical depth produced by these electrons not be large enough to affect the observed self - absorption frequency @xmath51 , @xmath52 , ( provided of course that @xmath51 is unambiguously established by electrons at @xmath18 ) .",
    "the uncertainty in the value of @xmath51 ( and the values of other characteristic frequencies ) determined by observations , relaxes the latter constraint to @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "these statements hold for about 1.5 decades of energy below @xmath18 , i.e. the energy range over which the electron distribution would affect the radio emission that has been observed to date . determining the electron spectrum below @xmath18 is of interest for both grb phenomenology and particle acceleration theory , suggesting that more careful analysis of radio spectra are warranted for obtaining better constraints on @xmath54 .",
    "this is , however , beyond the scope of the current paper , where we focus on the injection efficiency , @xmath4 .    in what follows",
    "we discuss the degeneracy of afterglow model predictions , showing that the predictions obtained assuming @xmath20 for some choice of model parameters , @xmath55 , are the same as those obtained for any value of @xmath4 , @xmath7 , and @xmath6 . in ",
    "[ sec : dynamics ] we discuss the hydrodynamics of the flow , and in   [ sec : radiation ] we discuss emission of radiation .",
    "the apparent physical size of the radiation emitting region has been determined in several cases . during the relativistic stage of shock expansion",
    ", the size of the emitting region has been determined directly through the observation of the suppression of diffractive radio scintillation @xcite , and through very long baseline radio interferometry @xcite .",
    "at the sub - relativistic stage , the size was determined indirectly through modelling the radio spectrum @xcite .",
    "these observations were used to determine the values of model parameters that determine the flow pattern , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , under the assumption of high efficiency , @xmath20 .",
    "modification , due to changes in the value of @xmath4 , of the values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are therefore allowed provided these changes do not modify the flow pattern .",
    "we demonstrate here that the velocity field @xmath56 associated with the afterglow stage of the grb explosion depends on the explosion energy @xmath0 and surrounding medium density @xmath1 only through the ratio @xmath22 . if the surrounding medium density is not uniform , then for a given functional dependence @xmath57 of the density on coordinates , @xmath58 where @xmath59 is some normalization , then the velocity field @xmath56 depends on @xmath0 and @xmath59 only through the ratio @xmath60 .",
    "it is straightforward to demonstrate the validity of the above statements through examination of the hydrodynamic equations .",
    "these may be written as @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the four - velocity and @xmath63 is the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "for the grb afterglow flows , it is appropriate to assume an ideal fluid flow , i.e. @xmath64 where @xmath21 and @xmath65 are the fluid pressure and ( proper ) energy density respectively , and an ideal gas equation of state , @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the adiabatic index ( @xmath68 for relativistic , non - relativistic particles respectively ) .",
    "it is now evident that if @xmath69 is a solution of the flow equations , then multiplying the density and pressure by a constant @xmath70 and leaving the velocity field unchanged provides another solution of the equations , @xmath71 .",
    "since the energy - momentum tensor of the new solution @xmath72 is related to the energy - momentum tensor of the original solution @xmath63 by @xmath73 , the energy of the flow in the modified solution is larger by a factor @xmath70 compared to the energy of the flow in the original solution .",
    "the argument given in the previous paragraph proves the statement that @xmath56 associated with the afterglow stage of the grb explosion depends on the explosion energy @xmath0 and surrounding medium density @xmath1 ( @xmath59 ) only through the ratio @xmath22 ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "since this argument is , however , rather abstract , it may be useful to examine in some detail how the afterglow flow is affected at various stages as @xmath0 and @xmath1 are changed .",
    "this examination will also be useful for the discussion of ",
    "[ sec : radiation ] . for simplicity , we assume in the following discussion a uniform density of the surrounding medium ( it is straight forward to generalize the discussion to a non - uniform density ) .",
    "let us first consider the flow associated with a spherical , relativistic blast wave .",
    "when the shock radius @xmath74 is sufficiently large , compared to the size of the region of initial energy deposition , the flow becomes self - similar , with shock lorentz factor determined by energy conservation , @xmath75 implying @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "the self - similar flow is therefore completely determined by the ratio @xmath22 .    the early afterglow , on minute time scale ,",
    "is produced at the onset of the interaction of relativistic grb plasma with the surrounding medium . at this stage , the highly relativistic plasma ejected by the grb engine with lorentz factor @xmath77 , the `` fireball , '' drives a forward shock into the surrounding medium , and a reverse shock is driven back into the fireball and decelerates it . once the reverse shock crosses the fireball plasma shell , the flow approaches the self - similar behavior described above .",
    "this transition stage take place ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at a radius which is the larger of ( i ) the radius at which the self - similar lorentz factor @xmath76 drops below @xmath77 , and ( ii ) the radius at which the thickness of the shocked plasma shell in the self - similar solution , @xmath78 , exceeds the thickness @xmath79 of the plasma shell ejected by the grb .",
    "the transition radius depends , therefore , on @xmath0 and @xmath1 only through the ratio @xmath22 .",
    "if the fireball is jet like , rather than spherical , then flow is well described as a conical section of a spherical fireball as long as the jet opening angle is @xmath80 . in this case",
    ", @xmath0 should be understood as the `` isotropic equivalent energy '' , the energy that would have been carried by the blast wave had it been spherically symmetric .",
    "when the fireball decelerates to @xmath81 , the jet is frequently assumed to expand sideways @xcite .",
    "the condition @xmath82 implies that the radius @xmath83 at which sideways expansion begins is given by @xmath84 .",
    "@xmath83 depends , therefore , on @xmath0 and @xmath1 only through the ratio @xmath22 .    during the stage of sideways expansion",
    ", the jet does not significantly propagate radially . finally , after the stage of sideways expansion , the flow becomes sub - relativistic @xcite , and ,",
    "if it becomes a spherical blast wave , the renewed expansion is described by the sedov - von neumann - taylor solutions . at this stage",
    "the time dependence of the shock radius is @xmath85 ( e.g. chapter xii of zeldovich & raizer 2002 ) . here",
    "@xmath86 is the time and the true energy of the explosion , corrected for the jet - like geometry , is @xmath87 .",
    "thus , at this stage as well the flow depends on @xmath0 and @xmath1 only through the ratio @xmath22 .",
    "afterglow observations at all stages of flow evolution , from the non self - similar onset of fireball interaction with surrounding gas , through the self - similar expansion phase and subsequent jet expansion phase ( if present ) , and including the final sub - relativistic phase , are consistent with synchrotron emission of radiation from electrons accelerated to a distribution of the type shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dndg ] with high efficiency , @xmath5 . under the assumption @xmath20 ,",
    "the values of model parameters , @xmath88 ( as well as @xmath13 and @xmath21 ) , are determined .",
    "let us now consider what modifications are introduced by allowing @xmath89 .",
    "we argue that the emission of radiation from shock accelerated electrons from a flow with parameter choice @xmath90 ( and @xmath91 , @xmath92 ) is similar to that obtained for the parameter choice @xmath88 and @xmath20 , for any @xmath4 in the range @xmath93 .",
    "let us first consider the velocity fields of the two flows .",
    "the flow pattern @xmath56 in the modified , @xmath94 , flow is similar to that of the @xmath20 flow , since the energy and density have both been increased by the same factor @xmath95 , leaving the ratio @xmath22 unchanged ( and since @xmath91 ) .",
    "next , we note that the magnetic field distributions in the two flows are similar .",
    "as explained in the previous section , the energy density in the modified flow is larger than that in the original flow by a factor @xmath95 , @xmath96 .",
    "decreasing the magnetic field equipartition fraction by a factor @xmath4 , @xmath97 , ensures that the magnetic field energy density is similar in both flows .",
    "finally , we argue that the density and energy distribution of accelerated electrons is the same in both flows .",
    "the number density of accelerated electrons is identical in the two flows : the number density of electrons is larger in the modified flow by a factor @xmath95 compared to that in the original flow , @xmath98 , but only a fraction @xmath4 of the electrons in the modified flow are accelerated .",
    "the total energy density in electrons is also the same in both flows , since @xmath99 .",
    "the fact that the electron energy density and accelerated electron density is similar in the two flows does not ensure that the energy distributions of accelerated electrons are similar , since in the modified flow some part of the electron energy density is carried by the non shock - accelerated electrons .",
    "this part is small , however , and therefore the energy distributions of the accelerated electrons are similar in both flows , as long as @xmath100 .    to see this , we note that during the relativistic phase of expansion , the characteristic lorentz factor @xmath101 of accelerated electrons , @xmath102 , is approximately determined by the relation @xmath103 . since afterglow observations imply @xmath104 for @xmath20 , as long as @xmath100 we have @xmath105 independent of @xmath4 . during the sub - relativistic regime",
    ", @xmath101 is determined by the relation @xmath106 . here too , @xmath101 is independent of @xmath4 , approximately given by @xmath107 , as long as @xmath100 .",
    "it is important to note here , that since we have several examples where afterglow observations cover both relativistic and sub - relativistic evolution phases ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the efficiency @xmath4 should be similar at both stages .",
    "this independence of @xmath4 on @xmath12 is not necessarily surprising , since @xmath4 may be , e.g. , a function of @xmath10 alone .",
    "since the two flows have similar velocity fields , similar magnetic field energy distributions and similar accelerated electron distributions , the afterglow radiation emitted by the accelerated electrons is similar for the two flows .",
    "the presence of a non shock - accelerated electron population may , however , modify the radiation pattern .",
    "this issue is discussed in the following section .",
    "consider the possible presence of a large number of `` thermal '' electrons that entered the shock at energy @xmath36 as measured in the shock frame .",
    "assume that they are heated somewhat to a typical energy of @xmath108 , where @xmath109 .",
    "here @xmath110 is a parameter that expresses our ignorance of the plasma physics that governs the electron heating beyond the energy @xmath36 , which the electrons bring into the shock from upstream .",
    "the presence of a large population of these `` thermal '' electrons at energy @xmath111 ( or at @xmath112 ) may affect the emitted radiation by producing a new component of emission , or by producing a large synchrotron self - absorption optical depth , thus suppressing the emission from accelerated electrons . since the energy distribution of the non shock - accelerated electrons does not extend ( by definition ) to energies @xmath113 ( or @xmath114 ) , they may affect the emitted radiation at frequencies @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the characteristic synchrotron emission frequency of electrons of energy @xmath108 ( or @xmath117 ) .",
    "this frequency is lower by a factor @xmath118 than the characteristic synchrotron emission frequency @xmath24 of accelerated electrons at energy @xmath33 ( or @xmath119 , in which case the self - absorption is a line ) .",
    "since the time dependence of the characteristic synchrotron emission frequency of accelerated electrons typically behaves as @xmath120 , i.e. peaks at x - rays on minute time scale and drops below the optical on a time scale of 10  hr , the characteristic synchrotron frequency of the non shock - accelerated electrons drops from @xmath121  ghz on minute time scale to @xmath122  ghz on 3  hr time scale , @xmath123 this implies that the existence of a large population of non shock - accelerated electrons can be constrained only through early radio observations , at @xmath124  hr delay . assuming a spread of several times the thermal energy , so that @xmath125 , the emission and/or absorption of the thermal electrons could be caught with radio follow - up observations within several hours of the grb . with sufficient preparation ,",

    "afterglow observations do not constrain , for example , the values of @xmath0 and @xmath3 , but rather the values of @xmath183 and @xmath184 . note , that the value of @xmath18 is independent of @xmath4 ( and equals @xmath185 or @xmath186 ) .",
    "the existence of non shock - accelerated electrons will strongly affect the predicted radio emission on short , @xmath187  hr , time scale . here ,",
    "@xmath188 ( or @xmath189 ) is the characteristic energy of non shock - accelerated electrons ( @xmath190 ) . for @xmath89 , a large self - absorption optical depth at @xmath191 [ eq .  ( [ eq : tau ] ) ] would lead to strong suppression of the radio flux at lower frequencies [ eq .  ( [ eq : f_ratio ] ) ] . as @xmath116 drops below an observed frequency @xmath151 , at @xmath192  hr , the optical depth at this frequency drops below unity , and a sharp brightening is expected . for @xmath170 and moderate @xmath171 ,",
    "the existence of a large population of non shock - accelerated electrons may be identified through their radio emission [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : f_ratio1 ] ) and the discussion preceding it ] . for @xmath170 , the modification of radio emission due to",
    "the presence of non shock - accelerated electrons will persist over time scales significantly larger than @xmath193  hr . the radio signature of these thermal electrons could test for their presence at levels that are energetically insignificant by a large margin ( even @xmath194 ) , and therefore otherwise inconspicuous .",
    "it should be pointed out that afterglow observations already provide interesting constraints on the efficiency of electron acceleration .",
    "first , they require similar efficiency @xmath4 for both relativistic and sub - relativistic shocks , since several examples exist of afterglow observations covering both relativistic and sub - relativistic evolution phases ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this independence of @xmath4 on @xmath12 is not necessarily surprising , since @xmath4 may be , e.g. , a function of @xmath10 alone .",
    "second , afterglow observations imply that the energy of accelerated electrons is increased to a characteristic energy similar to the protons post - shock temperature ( with power - law extension to high energies ) . finally , the value of @xmath4 is limited to @xmath195 .",
    "early , @xmath196  hr , radio observations will provide more stringent constraints on the efficiency @xmath4 ( and will hence remove the degeneracy in determining grb model parameters ) . as mentioned in   [ sec : degeneracy ] , radio spectra can also be used to constrain the energy distribution of accelerated electrons at energies below the characteristic acceleration energy , @xmath197 @xcite , providing further constraints on the acceleration process .",
    "the total , beaming corrected , energy released in cosmological long duration grb explosions is typically inferred , assuming @xmath20 , to be @xmath198  erg @xcite , with a spread in estimated values of roughly one order of magnitude .",
    "since afterglow observations do not constrain @xmath199 , but rather @xmath200 , the true explosion energies are @xmath201  erg . for @xmath202 , explosion energies @xmath203  erg would naively be inferred for many grbs .",
    "the association of ( at least some ) grbs with supernovae @xcite suggests that the total energy is probably not much more than @xmath204  erg , ruling out values of @xmath89 . using this argument to infer a conservative lower limit on @xmath4 , the uncertainties in determining @xmath200 from afterglow observations should be considered .",
    "uncertainties in determining @xmath0 may arise from uncertainties in the determination of the observables @xmath205 .",
    "the main uncertainty here is due to uncertainty in the determination of the self - absorption frequency , which is not known in many cases and determined in the best cases to within a factor of @xmath206 , leading to uncertainty in @xmath0 of a similar magnitude ( since @xmath207 , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* note , that the uncertainty in @xmath208 and @xmath209 is much larger ) .",
    "moreover , it should be realized that afterglow models are highly idealized ( e.g. assuming simple geometry ) and various effects which are not taken into account ( e.g. acceleration of pre - shocked plasma by a cosmic - ray precursor ) may lead to systematic errors in estimates of model parameters .",
    "thus , estimates of the energy should be considered as order of magnitude estimates .",
    "finally , the energy provided by the supernova to the grb jet could be higher than that provided to the supernovae ejecta , whose energy is limited by neutrino cooling . altogether , although @xmath8 is suggested by the energy derived from afterglow observations , @xmath210 should be considered a plausible conservative lower limit .",
    "is there an _ a priori _ reason to suspect that @xmath4 should be small ? in the case of plerionic nebulae , such as the crab , typical shock - accelerated spectra ( @xmath211 ) occur above lorentz factors of order @xmath212 , and below that the spectra are much flatter , @xmath213 @xcite .",
    "curiously , the low energy end of these spectra goes well below @xmath214 ( where the bulk lorentz factor of the pre - shock wind can be estimated knowing the total number of electrons and the total energy that have been deposited into the nebulae by the wind ) .",
    "these low energy electrons do not increase the total energy requirements , but clearly comprise most of the electrons by number .",
    "this raises the question of how most of the electrons in the nebula can have _ less _ energy than they had flowing into the shock , and strongly suggests some sort of shock mediation mechanism that redistributes their energy in the form of a hard power law .",
    "suppose the same sort of low energy spectra were obtained below @xmath33 in grb blast waves .",
    "we can express these low energy electron populations as @xmath215 .",
    "basically @xmath216 is the number of low energy electrons at energy @xmath217 relative to those at @xmath218 .",
    "if plerion - like low energy spectra were to obtain in grb post - afterglow - shock plasmas , it would give values of @xmath4 of more than 1/30 at @xmath219 but would violate the constraint @xmath220 that seems to exist at least for some grb afterglows .",
    "these current limits extend from @xmath221 . exploring the region",
    "@xmath222 at 1@xmath223  ghz will , by equation ( 2 ) , require radio follow up observations within @xmath224 hr . the signature of a thermal population of electrons would be a ) a radio `` blackout '' due to the low brightness temperature of the thermal electrons , followed by b ) a pre - brightening , as the emitting area increases , followed by c ) a steep decline , as the emitting frequency of the thermal electrons passes below the observed frequency .",
    "all these stages precede the expected rise associated with the eventual passage of @xmath24 through the observing frequency .    in summary ,",
    "early observations of emission and self - absorption in grb afterglows can provide a diagnostic of the low energy electron spectra in grb afterglow shocks .",
    "this might either change our understanding of them or , at least , close some important loopholes in afterglow theory .",
