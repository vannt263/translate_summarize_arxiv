    "the need for a more fundamental theory at high energies has been justified in many different contexts .",
    "divergences in quantum field theory , singularities in gravity and the lack of a unified quantum framework for all forces , are some of them .",
    "a consequence arising from this consideration , which has been extensively studied , is the possibility of having lorentz invariance violation in the form of effective corrections @xcite .",
    "this idea naturally leads to new extensions of the standard model and modified dispersion relations for particles .",
    "today experimental searches for lorentz invariance violation are being carried in diverse frontiers @xcite .    in this context",
    "the myers - pospelov theory is a model that introduces lorentz invariance violation through dimension five operators @xcite .",
    "the breakdown of lorentz symmetry takes place in the scalar , fermion and gauge sectors and is characterized by an external timelike four - vector @xmath1 defining a preferred reference frame .",
    "experimental bounds for this model have been studied in several phenomena , such as synchrotron radiation @xcite , gamma ray bursts @xcite , neutrino physics @xcite , radiative corrections @xcite , generic backgrounds @xcite , and others @xcite .",
    "typically , these phenomenological studies assume @xmath0 to lie purely in the temporal direction @xcite . in this work we will take @xmath0 as general as possible and eventually we will consider some special choices .    in recent years , theories with higher time derivatives have been proposed as extensions of the standard model of particles @xcite .",
    "one of the main advantages is that these theories soften the ultraviolet behavior of the quantum field theory , and hence problems like the hierarchy puzzle seem to be solved .",
    "although they contain negative norm states @xcite the theoretical consistency was established many years ago @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that although unitarity is maintained , the price to pay is the lost of causality @xcite .",
    "the new negative norm modes are relevant at high energies screening the ultraviolet effects of any standard quantum field theory leading to a low energy limit which is not sensitive to the details of the effective theory at microscopic scales ( see , however @xcite ) .",
    "the myers and pospelov theory has these ingredients when @xmath0 has a nonvanishing temporal component .",
    "hence , it is interesting to investigate the role of these new modes in order to check the behavior of the low energy limit of myers - pospelov theory . in this work",
    "we will analyze how these new modes affect the quantization of the theory , because it is the first step to study such low energy limit .",
    "moreover , interacting theories with higher time derivatives lose causality at the microscopic level if we want to maintain unitarity .",
    "an effect of this acausal behavior is for instance the negativity of certain decay rates .",
    "but also the lorentz violating myers and pospelov theories have a natural violation of the microcausality principle , even without interactions @xcite . since in this work we will not deal with interactions we will focus on the study of the last source of violation of microcausality .",
    "the layout of this work is the following . in sect .",
    "[ sec2 ] we introduce the fermionic myers and pospelov model where we find the dispersion relation in an arbitrary background . for special choices of the preferred four - vector",
    "we analyze the causality and stability of the different theories . in sect .",
    "[ sec3 ] we review the main aspects of a higher time derivative theory like the fermionic lee - wick model which will help us to understand the remaining sections . in sect .",
    "[ sec4 ] we quantize the timelike myers and pospelov theory by performing a decomposition of the theory into four individual fermionic oscillators . in sect .",
    "[ microcausality ] we discuss violations of microcausality where a perturbative computation of the anticommutator function is given . in the last section",
    "we give the conclusions and final comments . in [ app ]",
    "we characterize the general solutions and dispersion relations .",
    "the fermionic sector of the myers - pospelov theory is given by the lagrangian @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are inverse planck mass dimension couplings constants and @xmath0 is a dimensionless four - vector defining a preferred reference frame with @xmath5 or @xmath6 .",
    "the variation of the lagrangian ( [ m - p - lag1 ] ) produces the equations of motion @xmath7\\psi(x)=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in momentum space , @xmath8 , we obtain an algebraic equation , @xmath9\\psi(p)=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the dispersion relation is given by @xmath10 in general ( [ reldisp - cuad2 ] ) is is an eighth order polynomial in @xmath11 and it would yield at most eight real solutions . however , if @xmath12 the order of the polynomial in @xmath13 is four corresponding to particles and antiparticles of spin @xmath14 .",
    "the negative solutions correspond to antiparticles modes while the positive ones are particles modes .",
    "the situation for @xmath15 is to obtain twice the number of solutions than in the standard case .",
    "this is due to the fact that we are dealing with a theory with higher time derivatives as can be seen from the equation of motion ( [ eqm ] ) . in the next subsection",
    "we will discuss in more detail the nature of these extra solutions .    a derivation of eq .",
    "( [ reldisp - cuad2 ] ) and the eigenspinor solutions are given in the appendix . in what follows we will consider the case @xmath16 .",
    "the case of a nonvanishing @xmath4 introduces very complicated parameterizations as it can be seen in the appendix .",
    "however , it does not contribute to new relevant features and renders the calculations cumbersome .",
    "the reader interested in this case can go through the appendix .",
    "we start to analyze the purely timelike case by taking @xmath17 and as mentioned above setting @xmath16 . in this case",
    "the dispersion relation ( [ reldisp - cuad2 ] ) reduces to @xmath18 from where we obtain the four solutions @xmath19 with @xmath20 .",
    "the solutions @xmath21 in the limit @xmath22 tend to the usual solutions @xmath23 while the solutions @xmath24 go to infinity .",
    "these singular solutions are called lee - wick modes @xcite and will be explained in more detail in the next section .    in order to see the qualitative behavior of the solutions let us define the two functions @xmath25 and @xmath26 , and plot these functions of @xmath11 in fig .  1 .     with the curve @xmath27 corresponds to the solutions @xmath28 given in ( [ field - energy2]).,scaledwidth=47.0% ]    [ fig1 ] the solutions are the intersection points of the curve @xmath29 and the horizontal straight line corresponding to the fixed value of the momentum square , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath26 . hence , for small values of @xmath30",
    "we find four solutions , one negative frequency which corresponds to an antiparticle and three positive frequencies . among the positive frequencies the smallest one is the normal particle frequency and the other two correspond to lee - wick modes .",
    "it is peculiar the behavior of the lee - wick solution whose frequency decreases with momentum , this will continue until the momentum reaches the value of @xmath31 where it collapses with the normal particle mode . above these values the solutions @xmath32 and @xmath33 become complex introducing stability problems .",
    "furthermore , it is worth noting the differences in energy between particles and antiparticles which in the limit @xmath34 turns out to be @xmath35 .     and @xmath36 given in ( [ group - velocity]).,scaledwidth=47.0% ]    [ fig2 ]",
    "some insight can be gained into the possible violations of microcausality in the model by looking at the group velocities @xcite . the magnitude of the group velocities are @xmath37 and they are plotted in fig .  2 . according to the criteria of @xcite",
    "we should expect small violations of microcausality in the theory since the velocities @xmath38 can exceed normal signal propagation at high momenta . in section [ microcausality ]",
    "we give a detailed computation of microcausality .      in the lightlike case and for simplicity",
    "taking @xmath39 the dispersion relation reads @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the angle between @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the solutions are @xmath44 with @xmath45 @xmath46 and @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the discriminant of the third order polynomial ( [ disp.rel-lightlike1 ] ) .    here , the roots can be real or complex depending on whether the discriminant is greater or less than zero , respectively .",
    "therefore , the quantization of this model presents an extra complication of instability due to complex solutions . to see this",
    "more clearly consider the discriminant up to the linear order @xmath49 for example we see that for momenta higher than @xmath50 the solutions in the anti - parallel direction can be imaginary .",
    "for these very high momenta the theory can violate causality since the retarded green function gives a contribution at times @xmath51 .",
    "this is very similar to what occurs in the timelike model for @xmath52 , see fig .  3 of sect 5 ,",
    "however here the instabilities are not controllable by restricting to lower momenta or introducing a cutoff @xcite .      without loss of generality",
    "we can take the preferred vector as @xmath53 .",
    "the dispersion relation for this case is @xmath54 the frequency solutions are @xmath55 note that these solutions are always real and that we recover the usual dispersion relation when the preferred vector is orthogonal to the propagation , called blind momenta directions .    to discuss the causal structure of the theory",
    "let us compute the retarded green function .",
    "we must check that it vanishes for times before the interaction is turned on , that is to say , before the time @xmath56 . the retarded green function in this case",
    "is @xmath57 where the poles are given by the solutions ( [ spacelike - solutions ] ) and @xmath58 is the contour above the real axis as depicted in fig  3 of sect 5 . the argument that causality is preserved is rather simple and goes as follows . for times",
    "@xmath51 the contour @xmath58 must be closed from above and therefore does not enclose any pole .",
    "recall that the poles lie on the real axis even for arbitrary high momenta . in this way",
    "there are no violations of causality in the spacelike model .",
    "before facing the problem of quantization , let us review some general aspects concerning higher derivative theories which may not be familiar for some readers .",
    "these kind of theories were studied by lee and wick and others some decades ago @xcite and recently there has been a growing interest in them regarding the hierarchy problem in the standard model @xcite . unlike the theory we are considering , the lee - wick models are lorentz invariant theories , however , they have in common the higher order time derivatives",
    ". we will devote this section to summarize the main features of the fermionic sector of a lee - wick model which will be important for our subsequent analysis .",
    "in particular let us consider the lagrangian @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a dimensionless positive coupling constant and @xmath61 is an ultraviolet energy scale .    by defining the new fields @xmath62 with @xmath63 and @xmath64 the lagrangian ( [ m - p - lag2 ] )",
    "can be written in terms of these fields as @xmath65 here we have written a higher time derivative theory in terms of to two decoupled standard fermions .",
    "however , the second mode has the wrong sign in fronts of its lagrangian density .    the non vanishing anticommutators will be @xmath66 note that the minus sign of the anticommutators of the minus fields is responsible for the negative norm states .",

    "the positivity of the energy spectrum and the indefiniteness of fock space are evident .",
    "the propagators are @xmath77 by introducing interactions the wrong sign may cause the loss of unitarity . however , it has been shown that with a suitable prescription for the propagators it is possible to maintain unitarity @xcite . although unitarity is kept , causality is lost at a microscopic scale , as can be seen by the occurrence of negative decay rates .    summarizing , theories with higher time derivatives have the following important features ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "* the theory doubles the number of modes . *",
    "the new modes correspond to negative norm states .",

    "corresponds to a higher time derivative theory and it will have many features in common with the model reviewed in the previous section . however , we will take a different strategy for quantizing the theory because our present theory lacks lorentz covariance .    in this case",
    "the lagrangian is @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the standard dirac hamiltonian operator and we have considered without loss of generality @xmath80 to make the contact with the previous section more transparent .",
    "now let us write the field in terms of the standard solutions of the dirac hamiltonian operator , @xmath81 where @xmath75 is a spin index , @xmath82 is the particle and antiparticle index , i.e. , @xmath83 and @xmath84 being @xmath85 and @xmath86 the standard spinors and @xmath87 .",
    "remembering @xmath88 with the normalization convention @xmath89 where @xmath90 and @xmath91 , we have @xmath92 now it is clear we have reduced the quantum field theory problem to a set of four quantum mechanical systems at a given momentum .",
    "these quantum mechanical systems have higher time derivatives and their quantization can be realized in a similar way as it was done in the previous section , but for a @xmath93 quantum field theory .",
    "in other words for each index @xmath82 and @xmath75 we can define the following fields : @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 the lagrangian in terms of these fields is @xmath97 the equations of motion in terms of these fields are @xmath98 whose solution are @xmath99 @xmath100 now it straightforward to quantize this system by promoting the coefficients @xmath101 and @xmath102 to operators and taking into account the minus sign of the second part of ( [ lmp ] ) which produces the minus sign in the anticommutation relations of the minus modes , i.e , @xmath103 to make contact with the standard theory note that @xmath104 corresponds to @xmath105 which destroys standard fermion and @xmath106 corresponds to @xmath107 which creates standard antifermions , i.e. , @xmath108 and @xmath109 this correspondence is valid only for the plus modes because the standard theory is recovered when @xmath60 goes to zero .",
    "however , the minus modes have not a defining limit and we can not refer to them as particle and antiparticle pairs .    the original field can be written as @xmath110 with @xmath111,\\nonumber \\\\",

    "however , in the second line we must use the negativity of the anticommutators of @xmath118 and the positivity of the @xmath119 to check this statement .",

    "the spacelike regions where microcausality is violated are the regions where the phase changes slowly : @xmath166 this is very similar to what occurs in the photon sector of the myers - pospelov theory where the small violations of microcausality occur near the light cone @xcite .",

    "thirdly we explicitly quantized the pure time theory and finally we computed the microcausality violation .    in the purely spacelike case",
    "no inconsistencies were found .",
    "however , for the other two cases the theory is consistent for momenta below a natural cutoff .",
    "furthermore , these cases show higher time derivatives features which double the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "the additional modes are negative norm states which might be controlled by suitable prescriptions studied in the known lee - wick theories .",
    "microcausality was computed explicitly in the pure time case , leading to suppressed violations near lightlike four momenta .    in the quantization of the negative norm states appearing in the theory",
    "we have assumed that the cutkosky prescription should work for the theory under consideration . however , this is quite far from being clear , because that procedure was introduced to maintain unitarity and covariance of lee - wick theories .",
    "we are not restricted to fulfill the covariance of the theory but we need to keep unitarity . this aspect should be studied in future works to complete the analysis . after this , we would be ready to study new features due to interaction terms like radiative corrections , the low energy limit of the theory , and the violation of causality owed to negative norm states contained in the theory",
