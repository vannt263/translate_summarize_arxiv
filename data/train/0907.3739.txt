    "the first of these , the assumption that the shock front is a static surface , means that we are unable to use the x - ray emission lifetime to place any additional constraints on the shock geometry .",
    "since the x - ray emission is localised in a region which is unresolved using _",
    ", it would be possible , in principle , to use the x - ray emission lifetime to constrain the geometry : this would require the x - ray emitting plasma at the shock front to be moving at an apparent velocity such that the time taken to traverse an angular distance of order the size of the _ chandra _ psf is greater than the x - ray emission lifetime in the rest frame of the observer .",
    "@xcite reported synchrotron emission from the x - ray knot , where the best - fitting x - ray lifetime is @xmath185 for a given doppler - beaming factor @xmath186 , and @xmath187 years . assuming a maximum linear size for the x - ray emission @xmath188 , the required condition is    @xmath189    where @xmath190 is the shock speed . however , because the shock is assumed to be static ( @xmath191 ) , this argument can not be used .",
    "we note that the peak of the x - ray emission shows a significant offset to the radio and optical peak positions , with a separation @xmath192 arcsec ( @xmath0  kpc ) .",
    "similar offsets have been observed in other kpc - scale jets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "*  15 and 3c  66b , respectively ) , although their underlying cause is currently not well - understood .",
    "even if the shock speed was included in the model and constrained using the x - ray emission lifetime , the geometry would remain under - determined , since there are still more free parameters than observables .",
    "another possibility is that knot  b and  c may both represent a complex of knots  unresolved at the redshift of 3c  346  any one of which could be the x - ray emitter .",
    "the other key assumption of the model is that the ordered component of magnetic field upstream of the shock is parallel to the upstream flow , and remains parallel to the downstream flow after passing through the shock . for the mfpa to be parallel to the upstream flow in 3c  346",
    ", we must assume that @xmath71 is directed at radio knot  c from the upstream x - ray knot , rather than from radio knot  b. it seems reasonable that radio knot  c and the x - ray emission form part of the same structure , and since the x - ray peak falls between knots  b and  c in our highest - resolution radio image , we feel justified in using the x - ray knot to define the upstream flow direction relative to the shock at knot  c. the upstream radio jet also shows significant curvature from the core through knots  a@xmath42a@xmath37 and  b , so we can not determine a conclusive @xmath71 direction using the radio data alone . on the downstream side , radio knots  c ,",
    "d and e show a good linear alignment , so we can determine the direction of @xmath193 with some confidence .",
    "the mfpa upstream of knot  c is also open to interpretation , depending on whether the optical or radio data are used .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : polarimetry ] , the region between knots  b and  c shows the biggest differences in the optical and radio polarization position angles , which can be as large as @xmath18 degrees . at the highest angular resolution",
    ", our 0.08-arcsec , 22.5  ghz radio polarimetry shows the apparent field to be parallel to the upstream flow in the region where the x - ray emission is brightest , although the optical data show a significant difference in polarization angle of @xmath194 degrees .",
    "@xcite showed that such differences may arise due to a stratified jet , where different components moving at different speeds and emitting in different wavebands could give rise to apparent differences in the polarization position angle of the radiation from each component , even if the magnetic field in each is intrinsically the same .",
    "a similar phenomenon could be occurring upstream of the strong shock in 3c  346 , if velocity gradients across the jet are large and give rise to a spine - sheath structure in this region .",
    "this is consistent with our observation that the fractional polarization in the optical is less than that seen in the higher - resolution radio data between knots  b and  c , which may result if the optical emission originates on smaller scales and is more prone to the effects of beam - averaging .",
    "the polarization position angles at knot  c are well - aligned in our radio and optical data , so we have used the mfpa at this point to determine the apparent magnetic field at the shock front .",
    "the most likely geometry of the shock , as determined by our modelling in section  [ sec : results2 ] , is in good agreement with the jet geometry adopted by @xcite .",
    "our results agree with @xcite and @xcite , who argued that the angle to the line of sight ( @xmath66 ) should be less than about @xmath195 degrees , based on jet - sidedness and the observed properties of the core .",
    "@xcite also analysed the galaxy - gas and cluster - gas properties using the x - ray radial profile , and observed that the pressures of the two gas components would be equal at the position of the x - ray bright knot if @xmath196 degrees , which is broadly consistent with our median value ( @xmath4 degrees ) .",
    "we have presented multi - band observations of the jet in 3c  346 using high - resolution data from the _ vla _ , _ hst _ and _ chandra _ observatories .",
    "the jet has similar optical and radio morphologies , while the x - ray emission from the shocked region is significantly offset from the optical and radio peak positions .",
    "the optical and radio polarimetry show close correspondence in the apparent magnetic field position angle and the fractional polarization at knot  c , where the jet undergoes a large apparent kink of almost 70 degrees in the optical and radio images , and which we interpret as an oblique shock .",
    "we have explored models of the polarization from oblique shocks presented by @xcite to understand the geometry of the 3c  346 jet , and we justify the key assumptions required to apply the models to our data . although our modelling has not provided a unique description of the jet in 3c  346 , we find that the upstream flow is likely to be moving with velocity @xmath2 , where the plane of the shock front is inclined at an angle of @xmath3 degrees to the upstream flow which is at an angle @xmath4 degrees to our line of sight .",
    "it has been necessary to include the polarization observed upstream of the shock and model the initial magnetic field using tangled- and uniform - field components , since models that treat the upstream field as completely tangled fail to give a reasonable description of the jet .",
