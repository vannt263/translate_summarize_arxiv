    "the nature of the galactic bulge morphology has been discussed using different interpretations over the last decades .",
    "its non - axisymmetry was quickly recognized with the arrival of the first near - infrared surveys ( e.g. , weiland et al .",
    "1994 ; lpez - corredoira et al .",
    "1997 ; babusiaux & gilmore 2005 ) , but its shape has not been free from debate .",
    "a peanut shape was evident in the projection of the bulge , especially in infrared surveys covering the full sky , like cobe - dirbe , and extinction was considered to be responsible for the presence of the pronounced `` peanut shape '' waist located near @xmath0 , @xmath1 in the uncorrected dirbe maps of the bulge at 1.25 and 2.2@xmath2 m ( weiland et al .",
    "1994 ) . from another perspective",
    ", astronomers have seen in this peanut shape some imprint of a boxy bulge ( e.g. , kent et al .",

    "1995 ; lpez - corredoira et al .",
    "2005 ) as observed in other galaxies ( e.g. , shaw 1987 ) or predicted by some theories that argue that the boxiness of the bulge was a composite effect expected to appear when one considers stable orbits belonging to several families of periodic orbits ( e.g. , combes & sanders 1981 ; stiavelli et al .",
    "1991 ; merrifield 1996 ; patsis et al .",
    "2003 ) .    using similar images of the milky way in the infrared , some observers ( nataf et al . 2015",
    "; ness & lang 2016 ) now see an x - shaped bulge behind the projected peanut shape , whereas other authors have seen elliptical or boxy bulges .",
    "these , however , are not direct interpretations of the image but depend on the image processing with the subtraction of some particular disk model , or these may be artifacts from subtracting the bulge as an ellipsoid instead of as a boxy bulge ( lee & jang 2016 ) .",
    "this follows more recent theories of bulge formation ( e.g. , patsis et al .",
    "2002 , quillen et al .",
    "2014 , li & shen 2015 ) .",
    "one may wonder why astronomers have not seen an x - shaped bulge in the 1990s in the cobe - dirbe images .",
    "the structure along the line of sight has also been claimed to show an x - shapeusing metal rich red clumps as standard candles ( nataf et al .",
    "2010 , 2015 ; mcwilliam & zoccali 2010 ; saito et al . 2011",
    "; wegg & gerhard 2013 ) , but some doubts have been cast on whether the second peak along the line of sight is a real density structure or an artifact in the luminosity function of red clumps ( rattenbury et al . 2007 ; lee et al . 2015 ; joo et al .",
    "2016 ; lee & jang 2016 ; lpez - corredoira 2016 ) .",
    "there are also signs of a non - x - shape bulge in other populations : very old and metal poor stars like rr - lyrae in the bulge are not x - shaped according to some authors ( dkny et al . 2013 ; pietrukowicz et al .",
    "2015 ) , and young ( @xmath3 gyr ) populations like f0-f5v stars are not x - shaped according to different interpretations ( lpez - corredoira 2016 ) , interpretations that might also have doubt cast upon .",
    "for instance , the argument for non - x - shape by lpez - corredoira ( 2016 ) might also raise doubts based on the possible dispersion of absolute magnitudes , which might be much larger than assumed and thus may convolve the two peaks along the line of sight into one .",
    "if we assume that all of these results are correct , we would have the surprising result of a galaxy with three bulges , which raises suspicions something is wrong with some of the previous analyses .    here",
    "we want to throw further light on the question by analyzing a new population , mira variables , which includes ages of both young and old stars .",
    "catchpole et al . ( 2016 ) report periods and jhkl observations for 643 oxygen - rich mira variables found in two outer bulge fields centered at @xmath4 and @xmath5 , each approximately 25 square degrees .",
    "they also use the 6528 mira stars from the ogle - iii catalog of variable stars ( soszyski et al .",
    "2013 ) in regions with lower galactic latitudes , providing periods and photometry in v and i , which are dominated by oxygen - rich sources ( matsunaga et al .",

    "12 of catchpole et al .",
    "( 2016 ) , with the intermediate - age population , is misleading since the clumpiness of the distribution is mostly due to noise : there are not enough stars to produce a map with bins of 0.15x0.15 kpc@xmath7 ( 630 stars in @xmath8 kpc@xmath7 gives an average of 3.5 star / bin , which is insufficient for performing a statistical analysis ) , and there are some incomplete counts because the entire selected region -6@xmath9 , @xmath10 was not totally covered . in any case ,",
    "catchpole et al . (",
    "2016 ) have not tested the x - shaped bulge hypothesis in this intermediate - age population . instead , they just plotted fig .",
    "12 in this range of absolute magnitudes with the projected counts and put their results together with those of mcwilliam & zoccali ( 2010 ) , which correspond to @xmath11 , and observed that some stars are where they should be .",
    "the rough comparison between fig .",
    "12 and mcwilliam & zoccali ( 2010 ) is invalid because they correspond to different latitudes .    using the period  luminosity relationship ( whitelock et al .",
    "2008 ; catchpole et al .",
    "2016 , equation ( 2 ) ) @xmath12@xmath13 - 2.38 , \\ ] ] and the @xmath6-band extinction @xmath14 ( fitzpatrick 1999 ) .",
    "the extinction @xmath15 is calculated by catchpole et al .",
    "( 2016 ) for their data and by us using the schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) maps for ogle data ; we can use this extinction to obtain the distance of each mira star .",
    "for the ogle data , the @xmath6-magnitude is derived for a single epoch from 2mass ; it is not the average @xmath6-magnitude .",
    "this can generate a large dispersion in distances , due to the variability of the sources ( matsunaga et al .",
    "we wonder why catchpole et al .",
    "( 2016 ) did not make any attempt to correct this dispersion of magnitudes , which introduces noise in the density maps . here",
    ", in order to avoid this error in distance ( although with average zero , which should be compensated for when large numbers of stars are used ) due to the difference between the average magnitude of a mira stars and the magnitude in a single epoch , we calibrate the average relationship between the color @xmath16(ogle)-@xmath6(2mass ) ( corrected for extinction ) and the period in the ogle sample of 1235 stars with @xmath17 ( to avoid high - extinction regions ) , and we use this relationship to calculate the `` average '' @xmath6-band magnitude in the ogle stars used here .",
    "this relationship is @xmath18 the dispersion of 2mass single - epoch @xmath6-magnitudes with respect to this law gives an average rms=0.85 mag ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : imk ] ) , which is on the order of magnitude of the expected value due to variability ( matsunaga et al . 2005 ) , with higher dispersion toward higher periods .",
    "given that we have used 1235 stars , the error of @xmath19 given in the above expression is 0.024 mag .",
    "if we choose stars with @xmath20<2.6 $ ] , the rms is reduced to 0.62 mag .",
    "we will use this constraint in ogle stars to avoid the highest deviations from the color  period relationship .    then , for the ogle data , rather than using the single - epoch 2mass magnitude , we use the @xmath16-magnitude for each of the stars and this color to calculate the average @xmath6-magnitude , i.e. @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is calculated from the period in eq .",

    "there may be some incompleteness of sources due to the patchiness of extinction , especially in the regions with lower @xmath30 , but this does not affect the shape of the density along the line of sight , although its amplitude is affected .",
    "in the same plot , we do a linear fit in the regions with 4.5 kpc@xmath31 kpc and 11 kpc@xmath32 kpc , which represents approximately the disk counts along those lines of sight , and the excess over this linear fit is the bulge density .",
    "the analysis of the disk counts is not the matter here , but note that this may be composed of both thick and thin disks , and the inner flare of the disk ( lpez - corredoira et al .",
    "2004 ) leads to a sizeable amount of disk stars even at @xmath33 kpc from the plane . for the bulge density",
    ", we can observe that there is only one peak in all lines of sight .",
    "a prediction of the bulge densities of two models , x - shaped and boxy , is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : pred_miras ] .",
    "they were derived from the analytical expressions given in lpez - corredoira ( 2016 ,  4.1 ) for the boxy and x - shaped bulges observed by lpez - corredoira et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and wegg & gerhard ( 2013 ) respectively :    @xmath34    @xmath35@xmath36 , \\]]@xmath37 , \\]]@xmath38@xmath39    for the positive longitude @xmath40 there is not much distinction in the functional shape of the density between the both models .",
    "however , for the negative longitude @xmath41 line of sight and for the three selected ogle regions , the two predictions are very different , with a double peak for the x - shaped bulge and a single peak for the boxy bulge .    fig .",
    "[ fig : wegg ] shows a plot that helps us to understand the origin of this double peak along @xmath41 , @xmath4 .",
    "this line of sight crosses two maxima in a constant @xmath42 slice , first in the left - hand bump , at around @xmath43 kpc , followed by a constant or slight decrease of the density in the hollow created by the peanut shape ( the line remains in the region between the blue and violet colors ) , and when we take into account the increase of @xmath44 at higher values of @xmath45 , this becomes a decrease of density .",
    "then there is a second big peak at around 9.5 kpc associated with the right - hand bump ; this second peak is indeed not as high in amplitude in fig .",
    "[ fig : pred_miras ] because we must add the effect of the increase of @xmath44 with distance , which makes the amplitude of the second peak similar to the first peak .",
    "one may wonder why fig .",
    "6 of wegg & gerhard ( 2013 ) and fig . 3 of saito et al .",
    "( 2011 ) do not explictly show the double peaks .",
    "indeed , these images show double bumps , but the lowest contours do not reach the longitude @xmath46 .",
    "it is a question of constrast , as it is not enough in these figures to see the lowest contours .",
    "however , in fig .",
    "3/top - right panel of mcwilliam & zoccali ( 2010 ) for ( @xmath47 , @xmath11 ) , a double peak is clearly observed ; see also their fig .",
    "6 , which shows the effect of double peaks between @xmath48 and @xmath49 . for lower values of @xmath50",
    ", it is even more evident that the x - shape should provide double peaks at negative longitudes . in any case , if there is no double peak for the red clumps , it would remove the question regarding the x - shape topic at least for this region , although not for the other regions .        clearly , the boxy bulge resembles the results of fig .",
    "[ fig : mirasdens ] , whereas the x - shaped bulge does not . for the ogle data , the covered areas are lower , and that is the reason it produces a noisier density . a @xmath51 analysis in the comparison of the models with the data in the range 5",

    "( 1.3@xmath63 ) , which is much likely than the x - shaped bulge .",
    "the combination of the two lines of sight gives , respectively , for the x - shaped and boxy bulges a probability of @xmath64 and 0.23 , i.e. the x - bulge is excluded within 99.89% c.l .",
    "( @xmath65 ) whereas the boxy bulge is only excluded within 77% c.l .",
    "( @xmath66 ) , which can be considered as a likely fit .",
    "the average relative error of distance of these mira stars using eq . ( [ mkp ] ) is 3.6% ( catchpole et al .",
    "2016 ) , which is too low to produce a smoothing of the two peaks into one .",
    "the error in eq .",
    "( [ imk ] ) is also low , as mentioned , around 0.024 mag .",
    "the error in the extinction is around 10% ( schlegel et al . 1998 ) , with the average extinction @xmath67 mag for ogle regions with @xmath17 .",
    "this produces another error of @xmath68 mag and @xmath69 mag , which is again too low to produce any confusion of the two peaks .",
    "the effect of metallicity dispersion is also negligible : first because the variations of the metallicity in the bulge along a line of sight are very low ( lpez - corredoira 2016 ) , and second because even large variations of metallicity would produce variations of the magnitude of less than 0.1 mag ( matsunaga 2012 ) , which would mean an error lower than @xmath70 mag in each bin with @xmath71 the number of stars in that bin .",
    "this makes this standard candle much more precise in the distance determination than the f0-f5v stars used by lpez - corredoira ( 2016 ) , but the result is still the same : a single peak along the line of sight .    the @xmath72 is related to the age of the star . roughly , the ages of 1.0 , 1.8 , 3.0 , 5.0 , 7.0 gyr correspond to @xmath73 ( feast 2009 ; catchpole et al .",

    "the fiducial model of the x - shaped bulge used here ( equation ( [ densx ] ) ) reproduces the wegg & gerhard ( 2013 ) maps derived from red clumps . in any case , in our analysis using mira stars , we have not seen double peaks along the line of sight , not in @xmath53 , @xmath4 , nor in @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "this population has an average age of 9 gyr . at present , using mira variable stars we can not distinguish the morphology of stars with different ages .",
    "this casts some doubt on the validity of red clump analyses claiming the existence of an x - shaped structure among stars with similar ages to those analyzed here , although an analysis of the metallicity of these stars is still pending .",
    "bulge dynamics , formation , and evolution do not distinguish among the different types of stars with the same origin ( same age and metallicity ) .",
    "stars with the same origin should belong to the same structure .",
    "rr lyrae are thought to be part of a different bulge compared to red clumps because rr lyrae are older . also , the f0 - 5v stars are younger than red clumps on average .",
    "but now we have a population of stars with ages similar to the red clumps with high metallicity , it is not expected that all stellar populations are part of a boxy bulge except for the red clumps , which are furthermore suspected to be contaminated by the second peak , unless we demonstrate a different origin for these red clumps .",
    "even if we can not be 100% sure , at the very least , doubts regarding the very existence of the x - shaped bulge should be established from the present work .",
