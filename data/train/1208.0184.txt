    "= 0.45    = 0.45    = 0.45    = 0.45    there are several effects on the gw spectrum in the presence of dark radiation .",
    "first , since @xmath15 ( nearly ) dominates the universe at the time of its decay in order to realize @xmath136 , @xmath137 decreases at @xmath138 .",
    "this is due to the change of equation of state of the universe .",
    "the gw energy density scales as @xmath77 inside the horizon , while total energy density scales as @xmath139 in the @xmath15-dominated period .",
    "even if @xmath15 does not completely dominate the universe , there should be deviation from the radiation - dominated universe as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : t_th ] . hence high frequency modes entering the horizon before @xmath15-domination experience relative suppression compared with low frequency modes . as a result ,",
    "as one can see , @xmath137 is suppressed for high frequency modes which enter the horizon before the @xmath15-domination .",
    "in addition , most importantly , the effect of anisotropic stress caused by dark radiation dissipates the gw energy density of the mode with @xmath140 , because dark radiation is already created by the @xmath15 decay when such modes enter the horizon . the effect is weaker for higher frequency because the abundance of @xmath16 is smaller at the horizon entry of high frequency modes .",
    "therefore , we expect suppression on the gw spectrum for both high frequency and low frequency sides : the former caused by modified expansion rate due to @xmath15 and the latter by the anisotropic stress of @xmath16 .",
    "the gw spectrum between these two regimes , @xmath141 , receives both effects and the resulting shape of the spectrum depends on how effective those effects are at @xmath141 .",
    "numerical calculations show that a dip in the spectrum may appear at @xmath133 . in particular",

    "[ fig : norm ] .",
    "in this paper we have studied the spectrum of inflationary gw background in the presence of dark radiation , motivated by recent observational preferences for @xmath136 .",
    "we have assumed that the dark radiation is non - thermally produced by decay of massive particles @xmath15 .",
    "there are several effects on the gw spectrum .",
    "first , the equation of state of the universe is modified due to the @xmath15 energy density and it changes the shape of the gw spectrum .",
    "second , the anisotropic stress carried by dark radiation dissipates the gw amplitude for modes entering the horizon around and after @xmath15 decay .",
    "numerical results show that there may appear a characteristic dip around @xmath133 , which is a smoking - gun signature of dark radiation .",
    "it not only provides an evidence of dark radiation , but also sheds light on its production mechanism .",
    "some notes are in order .",
    "we have assumed that the dark radiation anisotropic stress is induced only by the primordial gws .",
    "this is not in general true in the second order perturbation theory .",
    "free - streaming particles ( as well as other fluids ) contribute to gws at the second order in the scalar perturbation even if there is no primordial tensor perturbation .",
    "however , this contribution is negligible for @xmath146  @xcite .",
    "so far , we have considered dark radiation produced by the decay of @xmath15 . however , it is possible that the dark radiation was once in thermal equilibrium and decoupled from thermal bath at the temperature @xmath147 . in this case , the extra effective number of neutrino species is given by @xmath148^{4/3},\\ ] ] where @xmath149 and @xmath150 counts the number of @xmath16 species .",
    "if the decoupling temperature is higher than the weak scale , we need @xmath151 for explaining @xmath30 .",
    "the modulation in the gw spectrum , similar to the effect caused by of neutrinos apparent at the gw frequency of @xmath152hz  @xcite , appears at the frequency inside the range of decigo / bbo sensitivities for @xmath153@xmath49gev .",
