    "the angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) has emerged as a major arena in which our cosmological models and theories of cosmic structure formation can be tested . in this paper",

    ". we also use results from large scale structure studies ( lss ) , supernova observations ( sn1a ) , and hubble constant ( hst-@xmath18 ) measurements to refine estimates of key cosmological parameters , both for cbi+dmralone , and for the cbi  results in combination with other cmb observations .    during the year 2000",
    "observing season , the cbi  covered three deep fields of diameter roughly @xmath19 ( * ? ? ? *",
    "hereafter paper  ii ) , and three mosaic regions , each of size roughly 13 square degrees ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper iii ) .",
    "methods used for power spectrum estimation from these interferometry observations are described in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper iv ) .",
    "the results from the 2001 observing season , when combined with the observations from 2000 , will extend the mosaics to 80 square degrees , roughly doubling the amount of mosaic data .",
    "this will improve upon the parameter estimates given here but has yet to be analyzed .",
    "over the past several years , as the cmb observations have improved , the basic @xmath20 features predicted in the eighties for inflation - motivated models in which cosmic structure arises from gaussian - distributed curvature fluctuations ( e.g. , bond & efstathiou 1987 ) have emerged : ( 1 ) a `` sachs - wolfe '' plateau at low multipole moments , seen by _",
    "cobe_-dmr  @xcite and other large angle experiments .",
    "this probes the gravitational potentials at the last scattering surface and along the line of sight on scales that were not in causal contact at the epoch of photon decoupling at redshift @xmath21 .",
    "( 2 ) the long - sought first acoustic peak at @xmath22 , tentatively first seen by combining results from a heterogeneous mix of cmb results ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , then in single experiments , toco  @xcite and boomerang - na north american test flight @xcite .",
    "this was followed shortly after by the spectacularly detailed first peak mapping by the boomerang  antarctic flight @xcite and maxima   @xcite ; ( 3 ) and the detection of the next few peaks and dips by boomerang  @xcite and dasi   @xcite .",
    "observations from the more recent experiments are shown in figure  [ fig : compare ] .",
    "following these successes , three other key ingredients remained to be demonstrated ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a review ) : ( 4 ) the peaks and dips continue to higher @xmath4 at ever diminishing amplitude , in a damping tail directly tied to the viscosity in the photon - baryon fluid as they decouple , and to the finite width of that decoupling region .",
    "( 5 ) a necessary and highly predictable linear polarization power spectrum , fed by the polarization - dependent thomson scattering of the primary cmb anisotropy developed during photon break - out from the decoupling region . ( 6 ) secondary anisotropies that are an inevitable consequence as waves develop nonlinearly , breaking to form collapsed structures .",
    "the cbi  power spectra show clear evidence for a decline consistent with the damping tail ( 4 ) , as can be seen in figure  [ fig : compare ] .",
    "the sunyaev - zeldovich effect has of course been observed in clusters of galaxies at very high sensitivities , so ( 6 ) is there , and there may be evidence of a statistical sze signal from distant clusters in the cbi deep field observations ( papers ii and vi ) , but further experimental verification is needed .",
    "we address some issues associated with ( 4 ) and ( 6 ) in this paper , and ( 6 ) is treated in more detail in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper  vi ) .",
    "there are many experiments underway to address ( 5 ) and the first detection of polarization in the microwave background has recently been announced @xcite ; cbi  has been observing polarization since september 2002 .",
    "a longer term possibility would provide a 7th pillar , the detection of a component attributable to gravity waves in the cmb observations .",
    "however , unlike the other six items , inflation models differ substantially in the amount of gravity waves predicted , with very small undetectable imprints on the cmb being quite feasible .",
    "one reason that theory can be so definitive is that the primary cmb anisotropies probe the linear regime of fluctuations and can be calculated in exquisite detail .",
    "the adiabatic inflation - motivated paradigm continues to do remarkably well as our knowledge of @xmath20 and other parameters improves .",
    "just as powerful though is the large reduction in the space of possible theories which accurate measurements of the anisotropies provide .",
    "the positioning of the peaks is a strong argument in favor of predominantly curvature ( adiabatic ) fluctuations as opposed to isocurvature ones .",
    "in addition the multiple peaks are a strong argument in favour of coherent ( passive ) perturbations as opposed to incoherent ( active ) ones , e.g. , those associated with cosmic defect theories of structure formation @xcite .",

    "the maps shown in papers iii and vi are , to a first approximation , images of damped sound wave patterns that existed about 400,000 years after the big bang at a time when the photons were freed from the plasma . however , the images are actually a projected mixture of dominant and subdominant physical processes occurring through the photon decoupling `` surface '' , a fuzzy wall at redshift @xmath51 , when the universe passed from optically thick to thin to thomson scattering over a comoving distance @xmath52 .",
    "( specific numbers here are appropriate for a @xmath53cdm universe preferred by the parameter estimates in this paper ; @xmath54 is one of our conclusions . )",
    "prior to this epoch , acoustic wave patterns in the tightly - coupled photon - baryon fluid on scales below the comoving `` sound crossing distance '' at decoupling , @xmath55 ( @xmath56 physical ) , were viscously damped and strongly so on scales below the damping scale @xmath57 .",
    "this is closely related to the thickness over which decoupling occurred .",
    "subsequently , the photons freely - streamed along geodesics to us , mapping ( through the angular diameter distance relation ) the post - decoupling spatial structures in the temperature to the angular patterns we observe now as the primary cmb anisotropies . for example , the sound crossing and damping scales translate to multipoles @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively .",
    "free - streaming along our ( linearly perturbed ) past light cone leaves the pattern largely unaffected , except for the effect of temporal evolution in the gravitational potential wells as the photons propagate through them which leaves a further @xmath60 imprint , known as the integrated sachs - wolfe effect .",
    "a number of effects complicate this simple picture of direct mapping of acoustic compression and rarefaction regions : anisotropies are also fed by the electron flow at decoupling leading to a doppler effect , the changing gravitational potential as the universe passes from domination by relativistic to nonrelativistic species and small terms associated with polarization .",
    "the damping is of course a major radiative transfer problem , connecting the tightly - coupled baryon - photon fluid regime when shear viscosity and thermal conduction accurately describe the damping through to the free - streaming regime when full transport is needed .",
    "intense theoretical work over three decades has put accurate calculations of this linear cosmological radiative transfer problem on a firm footing .",
    "we discuss this further in ",
    "[ sec : damp ] .",
    "of course there are a number of nonlinear effects that are also present in the maps .",
    "these _ secondary _ anisotropies include weak - lensing by intervening mass , thomson - scattering by the nonlinear flowing gas once it became `` reionized '' at @xmath61@xmath62 , the thermal and kinematic sz effects , and the red - shifted emission from dusty galaxies .",
    "they all leave non - gaussian imprints on the cmb sky .",
    "theoretical predictions based on the best - fit models suggest that for cbi , only the thermal sz effect would be within striking distance .",
    "this effect is addressed in paper  vi .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in   [ sec : priors ] we first summarize the various priors from non - cmb observations that we use when estimating cosmological parameters . in   [ sec : ps ] and appendix  [ app : ps ] , we describe the methods we have used for parameter determination from power spectrum estimates , and the tests we have performed to demonstrate accuracy .",
    "we obtain estimates for our minimal inflation - based parameter set in   [ sec : cbionly ] , and also apply the techniques of appendix  [ app : ps ] to determine optimal bandpower spectra in   [ sec : optimal1 ] .",
    "we check for consistency between the mosaic and deep field results by comparing optimally calculated spectra for various subsets of the data . in the parameter estimations we restrict ourselves to the @xmath63 region .",
    "the spectrum at @xmath64 is discussed in paper  vi together with the level of secondary anisotropy expected from the sunyaev - zeldovich effect in that regime , and whether this is the origin of the excess power seen in the cbi  observations at high @xmath4 . in   [ sec : optimal1 ] we compare our results with those of other cmb experiments as a further consistency check .",

    "the priors we apply are listed below .",
    "\\1 ) the `` weak-@xmath18 '' prior : this prior restricts the hubble parameter to @xmath65 , and also imposes an age restriction , @xmath66 gyr , and a restriction on the matter density , @xmath67 .",
    "these are all weak priors that most cosmologists would readily agree on .",
    "\\2 ) the `` flat '' prior : as we shall see , the cbiobservations strongly support @xmath68 , so the addition of a flat prior to weak-@xmath18 seems reasonable .",
    "this is especially so if the target is parameters associated with inflation models .",
    "although it is possible for inflation models to give large mean curvature with non - negligible @xmath69 , they are rather baroque .",
    "\\3 ) the `` lss '' prior : the lss prior we use here is slightly modified over that used earlier @xcite and is described in detail in paper  vi .",
    "it involves a constraint on the amplitude @xmath70 and shape @xmath71 of the ( linear ) density power spectrum . here",
    "@xmath72 is the rms density power on scales corresponding to rich clusters of galaxies ( @xmath73 ) and @xmath71 mainly parameterizes the critical length scale when the universe passed from dominance by relativistic matter to dominance by non - relativistic matter .",
    "both constraints depend upon our basic minimal parameter set in complex ways .",
    "the distributions in both these lss parameters are taken to be quite broad , akin to a `` weak lss prior '' .",
    "we take a distribution for the combination @xmath74 which is a gaussian ( first error ) smeared by a uniform ( top - hat ) distribution ( second error ) : @xmath75 .",
    "the 0.47 value is about 15% below the value adopted in the earlier cmb papers , as discussed in paper  vi , but the distribution shape is the same . to use it ,",
    "the relation between @xmath76 and @xmath70 is needed for each cosmological model considered . for the shape",
    "prior , we make use of the similarity , over the wavenumber band that most large scale structure data probes , between changes in the spectral index @xmath27 and changes in the shape parameter @xmath77 $ ] .",
    "the latter includes a strong dependence upon @xmath78 as well as a rough @xmath79 modification .",
    "we combine the two dependences into a single constraint on the parameter @xmath71 = @xmath80 with @xmath71 = @xmath81 , a broad distribution over the 0.1 to 0.3 range .",
    "it is slightly less skewed to lower @xmath71 than the distribution used in the earlier studies .",
    "these small changes , which accord better with the emerging lss data from the 2df @xcite , sdss @xcite and weak lensing surveys @xcite , have a very small impact on the cosmic parameters we derive when the lss prior is applied , mainly because the cmb results are now so good that the lss prior is not as powerful a delimiter as it used to be .",
    "\\4 ) the `` hst - h '' prior : the hst key project has led to more restrictive estimates of the hubble parameter using cepheid data : @xmath82  @xcite , where these are gaussian 1-sigma errors .",
    "we denote this in the paper by the hst-@xmath18 prior .",
    "\\5 ) the `` sn '' prior : comparison of observations of a large number of distant and nearby supernovae of type 1a leads to a constraint in the @xmath83 plane , or equivalently the @xmath84 plane  @xcite , independent of the other cosmic parameters in our minimal set .",
    "we wish to determine likelihood functions @xmath85 for data sets @xmath86 as a function of parameters @xmath87 . these can be cosmological , as in the minimal inflation set described above ; bandpowers for a discrete binning of @xmath20 spectra ; or experimental , as for calibration and beam uncertainties .",
    "we consider two classes of parameters , those which are constrained at prescribed values ( external ) and those which we allow to dynamically relax to their maximum likelihood values ( internal ) .",
    "for the cosmological parameter set , we treat all but @xmath88 as external , with @xmath89 determined on a 8-million point grid .",
    "calibrations , beam uncertainties , bandpowers and @xmath88 are treated as internal , with error estimates in the neighbourhood of the maximum likelihood made from the curvature ( second derivative ) matrix evaluated there .",
    "for example , for the optimal bandpower case we treat in ",
    "[ sec : optimal1 ] , the parameterization is of the simple form : @xmath90 in terms of shapes @xmath91 and window functions @xmath92 which define a partition of unity ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "an obvious choice for @xmath92 is the top hat @xmath94 , defined to be unity for @xmath95 and zero outside .",
    "it is indeed the one we use for optimal spectra .",
    "ideally we would use all of the information available , e.g. , a pixel map with errors described by a pixel - pixel correlation matrix , to compute @xmath96 .",
    "this has been done in the past for limited parameter sets , but the parameter spaces we treat now are large enough that a large algorithmic speedup would be needed . in practice , we first go through a stage of `` radically compressing '' the information into a set of bandpowers with errors .",
    "however it is essential for accuracy that the entire likelihood surface be well represented .",
    "we show that this is true for the cbi  observations .",
    "our data analysis pipeline , described in paper iv , grids the visibility data into estimators , the covariances of which are also computed , and then determines the maximum likelihood power spectrum and the curvature of the likelihood function about that maximum . in the last step",
    ", the power spectrum for a given experiment is parameterized by a discrete sum over contiguous bands @xmath97 as in equation ( [ eq : bins ] ) , with @xmath98 replacing @xmath99 and @xmath100 for @xmath92 . for the power spectra estimates of papers ii and iii , a flat shape ( @xmath101 constant ) was used .    even though @xmath102 may be chosen for the input window functions in the parameterized model of equation ( [ eq : bins ] ) , processing through the actual @xmath103 coverage results in an effective set of window functions @xmath104 ( paper  iv ) .",
    "these are plotted for the deep and mosaic observations in papers  ii and  iii .",
    "the @xmath105 depend upon signal - to - noise ratio as a function of @xmath4 and spill over to @xmath4 values that lie beyond the support of the top hat @xmath100 .",
    "the result of the `` radical compression '' of the full cbi  noisy visibility data set , as described in paper iv , is : @xmath106 . here",
    "@xmath107 are maximum likelihood values of @xmath108 , @xmath109 is the inverse fisher matrix which would describe the correlations among the bandpowers if the likelihood distribution were gaussian , and @xmath110 are the bandpower window functions that convert a spectrum @xmath111 to expected bandpower values @xmath107 . in addition to the bandpowers",
    ", there are often extra parameters associated with other contributions to the signal that must be simultaneously determined . for example , with the cbi  data , we have two classes of sources which we take into account : nvss sources having flux densities greater than 3.4 mjy at 1.4 ghz , and `` residual '' faint sources which we model as an isotropic gaussian random field .",
    "the nvss sources have known positions , which enable us to define point - source template structures on the data . rather than trying to model the source",
    "amplitudes in detail , we simply project them out of the data by making the multipliers , @xmath112 , of the templates very large .",
    "we estimate the amplitude of the residual source contribution by extrapolating the cbi 31 ghz source counts to fainter flux densities .",
    "we usually fix the uncertainty in those amplitudes as well , but in some tests have allowed it to vary . in that case , a nuisance parameter is introduced which increases the fisher matrix dimension by one . forming @xmath109 and using it in the treatment of the data is equivalent to having marginalized over the nuisance parameter , so in effect @xmath109 is what is needed in all cases .",
    "if we target a limited number of bandpowers for parameter estimation , @xmath109 is truncated to those bands .",
    "this is mathematically identical to treating all bandpowers , but marginalizing ( integrating ) over the `` unobserved '' bands we have cut out .",
    "the effective or generalized total noise in each band , @xmath113 , includes the noise itself @xmath114 and the source contributions , @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",

    "we see here , once again , that the consistency between these two binning schemes is excellent .",
    "one of the caveats that is important to bear in mind when dealing with 7d - plus parameter spaces is that the limits derived from projection onto one or two directions in parameter space by full bayesian marginalization ( integration ) over the other variables can be misleading in certain cases .",

    "in conclusion we would emphasize the excellent overall consistency of the cosmological parameters extracted from the cbi mosaic and deep observations .",
    "it was shown in papers ii and iii that various subsets of the data are consistent with each other to within the levels expected , given the uncertainties . here",
    "we have shown that the cosmological parameters derived from different subsets of the data , and from different binning schemes and bin widths , are also self - consistent .",
    "we conclude that both the cbi data themselves and the cosmological parameter extraction from the cbi observations are robust .",
    "in this section , we apply the parameter - estimation methods of appendix [ sec : ps ] to combine power spectra derived with different bandpowers and with different window functions onto a common set of bands .",
    "a byproduct is the determination of how consistent the power spectra are and the values of various experimental parameters that can be adjusted to increase agreement ( e.g. , adjustments to the flux density scale ) .",
    "for all of the bandpower applications , a best - fit model was used for @xmath91 rather than flat bandpowers .",
    "in addition to the extraction of the optimal power spectrum for the whole cbi data set , we are interested in extracting optimal power spectra for subsets of the data .",
    "although these optimal spectra are not used in the estimation of the cosmological parameters , they do provide an invaluable means of comparing the various data sets , and , of course , of comparing the cbi data to other cmb data sets .",
    "we begin the extraction of optimal spectra by examining the pairwise combinations of the three mosaic fields .",
    "thus we combine pairs of the three mosaic fields ( 02 , 14 , and 20 ) .",
    "these are separated by about 6 in ra , which is sufficient to treat them as independent fields and uncorrelated data sets . when combining the fields we do not include separate calibration errors since these are common to all fields , and we assume no error on the estimate of the residual source component .",
    "the nvss sources are projected out as described in papers ii and iii , and that is included in this treatment .",

    "we have separated the upper and center panels for clarity , but when plotted together they show excellent consistency between all the combinations we have considered . in the spectra shown here , the cbio140  data have been used and combined onto the @xmath418=200 bins .",
    "we find excellent agreement between the extracted optimal spectra , regardless of whether the cbie140  or cbio200  data are used .",
    "this shows not only that the extracted data are self - consistent , but also that the band - to - band correlations are being treated correctly .",
    "we see from the upper panel of figure  [ fig : compare3mos ] that the agreement of the pairs is robust .",
    "this result is related to that obtained by comparing the power spectra for each individual mosaic field shown in paper iii .",
    "these show excursions among the power spectra for individual fields , although , as shown in paper iii , these excursions are not statistically significant .",
    "the pair - combined spectra shown here , with their increased statistical weights , indicate again that the excursions are compatible with expectations .",
    "the three deep fields are single pointings with long integration times .",
    "since the deep observations have better signal - to - noise ratios in the @xmath64 range , it is useful to combine the deep spectra with the mosaic spectra , which have less cosmic variance at low @xmath4 .",
    "one point to note is that two of the deep fields are embedded in the mosaic fields .",
    "however , the data used for the mosaics are only a subset of the data used in the the deep fields analysis , corresponding to the typical integration time on an individual mosaic pointing , which is about four hours .",
    "we therefore expect the correlations between the deep and mosaic data to be small and we ignore them when forming the optimal spectra .",
    "the center panel of figure  [ fig : compare3mos ] compares the combined cbideep  and joint cbio140  data with those from just the joint cbio140 .",
    "both cases use top hat window functions and are mapped onto the @xmath121 mosaic binning . the excess power anomaly seen in the deep data",
    "is not that evident with these relatively narrow bands , and the basic result is good agreement between the two .",
    "the lower panel of figure  [ fig : compare3mos ] compares the mosaic , deep , and mosaic+deep optimal power using the much coarser cbideep@xmath418 binning .",
    "this is similar to figure  14 of paper  iii , for which the mosaic data were evaluated directly in the cbi - pipeline analysis onto the cbideep  bands .",
    "here we have obtained a similar result by using only the cbio140  data : although there is no detection of mosaic power at @xmath419 , there is agreement in enhanced power levels at @xmath420 , although the larger @xmath421 mosaic confidence region is consistent with a `` non - detection '' .",
    "the joint deep+mosaic bandpower has slightly smaller errors than the deep - only case .",
    "the combined spectrum shows a clear detection of the expected damping of the power out to @xmath422 .",
    "thus the unique experimental setup of the cbi has further validated the cosmological paradigm outlined in   [ sec : intro ] by confirming one of the key ingredients .",
    "note the agreement in the excess power in the @xmath420 band ( though errors differ ) .",
    "further study is needed to confirm this excess , and , if confirmed , to determine the source of the power ( see paper vi for further discussion ) .      in this section",
    "we compare the @xmath423 ( band - power ) spectrum from the cbi with the spectra obtained from some other cmb experiments , and we then combine the cbi data with the data from the boomerang , dasi , maxima , and vsa  experiments in order to obtain a new optimal @xmath423 spectrum out to @xmath424 .",
    "this represents a considerable extension of the optimal spectrum beyond the previous limit at @xmath425 .",
    "a comparison of the pre - cbi optimal spectrum with the optimal spectrum including the cbi deep and mosaic data is shown in figure  [ fig : comparecbidasib98 ] .",
    "as noted above , each experiment has unique binnings , band - to - band correlations , and calibration and beam errors .",

    "we see here that the agreement between the different cmb experiments is excellent . in the derivation of the optimal spectra shown here calibration uncertainties of 10% for boomerang , 4% for dasi , 3.5% for vsa , and 4% for maxima",
    "were included , together with beam uncertainties of 14% for boomerang   and 5% for maxima .",
    "for this purpose we need to include the calibration uncertainty for cbi , which we take to be a conservative 5% .",
    "these are all incorporated in the spectra , which leads to significant correlations among bands associated with the beam uncertainty .",
    "that is , one must be careful in using optimal spectra directly for parameter estimation since , although we can compute the fisher matrix , we do not know the likelihood surface in detail .",
    "we find the optimal power spectrum for boomerang , dasi , and cbirequires a decrease in the temperature calibration by a factor @xmath426 for cbi  and @xmath427 for boomerang , and an increase by a factor @xmath428 for dasi .",
    "the data also favor an increase in the boomerang  beam by @xmath429 for the odd binning and @xmath430 for the even binning .",
    "these values are consistent with the quoted errors in all cases . indeed , assuming that the power spectra are derived from a single underlying spectrum , which the different experiments are sampling in their respective regions of the sky",
    ", one could use this technique to determine the calibrations and beams .",
    "for example , we note that the determinations for boomeranghave errors significantly smaller than the quoted uncertainties once they have been compared with the two sets of interferometer data , which have no beam uncertainties and much smaller calibration uncertainties .",
    "an important caveat to these optimally - combined @xmath423 s is that power spectra for the individual experiments were assumed to be independent .",
    "we have already commented on this for cbi  deep and mosaic combinations .",
    "in addition dasi s fields overlap about 5% of the boomerang  area , so there is correlation between boomerang  and dasi  which is not taken into account in this treatment .",
    "the correlation would have to be addressed in order to claim absolute accuracy in the adjustment of experimental parameters .",

    "( note that the window functions for the combined spectra are top hats and not the @xmath432 of the data points shown . )",
    "we also find the combined spectrum looks quite similar when all - data are used .",
    "the method we used for figure  [ fig : comparecbidasib98 ] has also been applied to construct optimal bandpowers for all of the above data ( including cbio140  and cbideep ) with finer binning for @xmath13 .",
    "this variable binning makes use of the high quality boomerang  data with its intrinsic @xmath433 spacing at low @xmath4 and it also makes use of the high-@xmath4 coverage of the cbi ( out to @xmath424 ) . the spectrum is compared in paper vi with power spectra computed for the sunyaev - zeldovich effect , and will not be discussed further here .",
    "we test the consistency of our parameter estimations by comparing with different combinations of cbi  and other data sets .",
    "we also derive estimates for the parameters from the full compilation of data available .",
    "the consistency in cosmological parameter space at the @xmath434 level among these 21 experiments , and the 5 higher precision ones , is illustrated in figure  [ fig:2sigbothall ] .",
    "this shows that using cbio140  data with dmr  is quite comparable at the @xmath434 level with what was achieved by boomerang  ( with the smallest errors ) , dasi , maxima , and vsa . the combined data , with the lss prior applied as well , gives the bulls - eye determination of figure  [ fig:2sigbothall ] .",
    "table  [ tab : paramscbitests ] also shows the sequence obtained when we add data from cbi s sister interferometry experiment , dasi , to cbio140+dmr .",

    "[ sec : intro ] , the transport of the photons through recombination involves all of the complications of radiative transfer as one passes from an optically thick to an optically thin `` thomson scattering atmosphere , '' compounded by a changing gravitational potential .",

    "it is certainly an attractive proposition to directly translate the cmb data into accurate determination of the physical scales operating at decoupling .",
    "however , the intertwining of transport effects makes the use of a parameterized @xmath20 model space a more robust proposition .",
    "the cbi  provides a unique view of the cmb spectrum extending to much higher @xmath4 than previous experiments which have detected primary anisotropies , and well into the multipole region of the spectrum dominated by the damping of fluctuations at decoupling due to viscosity in the photon - baryon fluid and the finite thickness of the last scattering region .",
    "the cbi observations indicate a flat universe with a scale - invariant primordial fluctuation spectrum consistent with the inflationary model ; and in addition they indicate a low matter density , a baryon fraction consistent with big bang nucleosynthesis , a non - zero cosmological constant , and a cosmological age consistent with the ages of the oldest stars in globular clusters .",
    "these results hold for the whole cbi data set , and in addition they hold for a subset of the data restricted to @xmath610 .",
    "these findings are therefore independent of the spectrum over the @xmath4-range of the first and second acoustic peaks , and thus provide _ independent _ confirmation of the major results determined by other cmb experiments from observations that span the first two or three acoustic peaks .",
    "this independent confirmation of the major results gives much confidence that the key assumptions of minimal inflationary models are correct , especially the assumption that the primordial fluctuation spectrum does not have significant fine structure .",
    "if there were significant fine structure , it is extremely unlikely that spectral studies over different @xmath4-ranges would yield the same values of key cosmological parameters .",
    "the good agreement with the results from lower @xmath4 also demonstrates that the recombination theory of the simple model is substantially correct .    in more detail :",
    "the cbi observations from the first year of observing , when combined with dmr , gives the following key cosmological results , as discussed in   [ sec : cbionly ] . under the weak-@xmath18+lss priors we find @xmath611 , and @xmath612 , consistent with inflationary models ; @xmath613 , and , in addition , identifying the excess energy density with the cosmological constant , we find @xmath614 .",
    "when the more restrictive priors , flat+weak-@xmath18+lss , are used , we find @xmath615 , consistent with large scale structure studies ; @xmath616 , consistent with big bang nucleosynthesis ; @xmath617 , and @xmath618 , indicating a low matter density universe ; @xmath619 , consistent with the recent determinations of the hubble constant based on the recently revised cepheid period - luminosity law ; and @xmath620 gyr , consistent with cosmological age estimates based on the oldest stars in globular clusters .",
    "these values for key cosmological parameters are in remarkably good agreement with those determined in other recent cmb experiments . as pointed out above , this is highly significant , since the cbicosmology is based on a higher @xmath4-range than has previously been used and leverages principally off the damping tail region of the spectrum rather than the first acoustic peak .",
    "another unique aspect of the 5003500 @xmath4-range that cbi  has probed is that the angular scales correspond to the 3d wavenumbers of structures that collapsed to produce clusters of galaxies , ranging from those with masses as low as @xmath1 , to large superclusters with masses @xmath621 .",
    "hence the cbi observations span the whole range of masses from small groups of galaxies to large superclusters .",
    "thus detection of cmb power in this region provides a direct link between the small @xmath60 fluctuations at the time of photon decoupling and the nonlinear density amplitudes on those scales today .",
    "this provides further strong support for the gravitational instability picture of structure formation .",
    "the cbi , boomerang , dasi , maxima , and vsa  observations are consistent with one another over the entire range of overlapping coverage in @xmath4 .",
    "the consistency between the five data sets , obtained by different experiments using different observation strategies on different parts of the sky , eliminates many sources of systematic error as a potential cause for concern .",
    "figure  [ fig:2sigbothall ] shows concordance of the different experiments in our minimal - inflation parameter space .",
    "given the small signal levels that are being studied here , it is remarkable that the agreement between the recent cmb experiments ( toco , boomerang , cbi , dasi , maxima , and vsa ) should be so good .",
    "the variety of techniques employed , combined with the extension of the spectrum to high-@xmath4 provided by the cbi data and the high @xmath4-resolution data at low multipoles provided by the boomerang , dasi , maxima , and vsa  experiments , makes for a compelling case that both the observations and the cosmological results are robust .",
    "we have not treated several other parameters that could be of relevance to the inflation - based model . in place of @xmath53cdm , @xmath622cdm is receiving much attention , with @xmath622 an ultra - low mass scalar field , often called quintessence , that dominates at late times .",
    "thus @xmath623 replaces @xmath24 and an effective @xmath622-dynamics is cast in terms of a mean pressure - to - density ratio @xmath624 , an effective equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "( the dynamics of @xmath622 is more complex than this , since @xmath622 is expected to be spatially as well as temporally varying .",
    "there is also no good candidate for a theory of @xmath622 . ) for @xmath53 , @xmath625 , but @xmath626 would get our patch of the universe into acceleration .",
    "@xmath627 is not well determined by cmb data and we require supernova information to get a useful constraint on it ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the cmb by itself also is insensitive to the addition of a light massive neutrino ( h@xmath53cdm models ) since there is only a small effect on @xmath20 .",
    "lss can add discriminatory power but it simply shifts the result to slightly lower ( but still nonzero ) @xmath24 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the influence of a possible gravity - wave component will be explored elsewhere but the main result is that it is also expected to have little effect on the main cosmological parameters presented here .",
    "it certainly would have no impact on the angular scales probed by cbi .    although our results show a tantalizing drop in the @xmath28 likelihood beyond 0.2 , as described in ",
    "[ sec : damp],there is some distance to go to get a detection at the @xmath628 values simple theoretical predictions give for @xmath53cdm .",
    "significant early energy injection in the medium can not have occurred .",
    "this constrains a number of possible , if not probable , scenarios : it is always possible to generate many ionizing stars early by amplifying structure formation from rare collapses that occurred at high redshift , having a non - gaussian component at small masses , or making the primordial spectrum bluer on small scales .",
    "the dominant feature of the cbi  data is the overall decline in the power with increasing @xmath4 , a strong prediction of the basic theory of photon decoupling , with a damping scale now moderately well determined , as described in ",
    "[ sec : damp ] .",
    "the way the simplest inflation - based models have survived the dramatic extension to higher @xmath4 over what previous experiments probed is rather amazing . as well cbi  has provided further evidence that the peaks and dips associated with acoustic oscillations continue to higher @xmath4 and are in roughly the right locations given by the emerging @xmath53cdm concordance model .",
    "thus , the cmb results from the cbi and from the boomerang , dasi , maxima , and vsa  experiments , both in isolation and particularly in combination , strongly support the chief predictions of the inflation paradigm  the geometry of the universe is flat , the initial density perturbations are nearly scale - invariant , and the density of mass - energy in the universe is dominated by a form other than ordinary matter .",
    "simple models in which structure formation is driven by topological defects are difficult to reconcile with the cmb observations .",
    "these conclusions are considerably strengthened by the inclusion of other cosmological results such as measurements of the hubble constant , the amplitude and shape of the power spectrum , and the accelerating expansion rate .",
    "these all point towards a nonzero cosmological constant .",

    "whether we are interested in estimating parameters which are cosmological or those defining an optimal spectrum , the full likelihood surface is required , not just its gaussian approximation which is valid only in the immediate neighborhood of the maximum .",
    "this can in principle only be done by full calculation , though in practice there are two analytic approximations that have have been shown to fit the one - point distributions quite well in all the cases tried @xcite .",
    "we show these work well for the cbideep and mosaic cases too in figures  [ fig : offsetlognormpfdeep ] and  [ fig : offsetlognormpfmos ] .",
    "the simplest and most often used analytic form is the `` offset lognormal '' distribution .",
    "this is obtained by taking a gaussian in the variable @xmath629 , where the offset @xmath630 is the effective noise in the experiment : @xmath631 , \\nonumber \\\\ & & { \\cal f}^{(z)}_{bb^\\prime } = ( \\bar{q}^b+q_{\\rm nt}^b ) { \\cal f}^{(q)}_{bb^\\prime}(\\bar{q}^{b^\\prime}+q_{\\rm nt}^{b^\\prime } ) .",
    "\\label{eq : xb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath632 is the curvature matrix for the bandpowers @xmath98 and @xmath633 is its local transformation to the @xmath634 variables .",
    "we sometimes use the ensemble average value of @xmath632 , which is the fisher matrix , rather than the curvature matrix .",
    "other approaches for evaluating @xmath630 are reviewed by @xcite .",
    "figures  [ fig : offsetlognormpfdeep ] and  [ fig : offsetlognormpfmos ] show how the offset lognormal approximation provides an accurate description of the likelihood in individual bands for both deep and mosaic data to beyond the @xmath434 level .",
    "it is also evident that the gaussian and pure lognormal approximations do not fit the likelihoods as well , the former working best in low signal - to - noise bands , the latter in high signal - to - noise bands .    to compare a given theory with spectrum @xmath635 with the data using equation  ( [ eq : xb ] ) ,",
    "the model @xmath98 s need to be evaluated with a specific choice for @xmath117 : @xmath636/{\\cal i } [ { \\cal c}^{(s)}_\\ell \\varphi_{b\\ell } ] ,   \\ { \\rm where } \\",
    "{ \\cal i } [ f_\\ell ] \\equiv \\sum_\\ell f_\\ell { \\ell + { { \\textstyle{1\\over2 } } } \\over \\ell ( \\ell + 1 ) }       \\label{eq : winfunc}\\ ] ] is the discrete `` logarithmic integral '' of a function @xmath637 .",
    "the associated bandpower in @xmath638 is @xmath639/{\\cal i } [ \\varphi_{b\\ell}]\\ , .\\ ] ] as discussed by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , the window function @xmath640 used for this purpose ( and therefore with a different notation than the @xmath92 defined above ) is somewhat arbitrary .",
    "the simplest choice is again that of a top hat @xmath641 .",
    "we prefer to use the signal - to - noise windows @xmath642 derived from the experiment ( paper  iv ) .",
    "we have also considered the truncated form @xmath643 .",
    "we find that the cosmological parameters we derive in   [ sec : cbionly ] and   [ sec : allparams ] are insensitive to which form we use .",
    "( for example , the largest change occurs in @xmath36 , by 4% in the mean and 10% in the error .",
    "this is also evident from figure  [ fig : compare3mos ] , which uses @xmath644 for the data to create an optimal spectrum with @xmath645 ; the results are almost identical to the original data . )",
    "if we decrease the width @xmath418 of bins , we develop more correlation between neighboring bands .",
    "the offset lognormal approximation has only been shown to give a good fit when considering individual bins .",
    "we therefore require weak band - to - band coupling .",
    "we have carried out extensive tests on the dependence of the parameter determinations on binning width and positioning .",
