    "* theoretical framework for a minimal signaling circuit . * to obtain the central results , we start with an example which illustrates the efficacy of the wk theory , and suggests a way to a more detailed , realistic model of the enzymatic push - pull loop . consider a small portion of a signaling pathway [ fig .",

    "these could be , for example , the active , phosphorylated forms of two kinases within a signaling cascade , with @xmath2 downstream of @xmath3 .",
    "the upstream part of the pathway contributes an effective production rate @xmath4 for species @xmath3 , which in general can be time - dependent , though for now we will make @xmath4 constant .",
    "the output @xmath2 is produced by a reaction , @xmath5 , with a rate @xmath6 that depends on the input .",
    "the species are deactivated with respective rates @xmath7 and @xmath8 , mimicking the role of the phosphatases .",
    "the input @xmath0 will vary over a characteristic time scale @xmath9 , fluctuating around the mean @xmath10 .",
    "the output deactivation rate sets the response time scale @xmath11 over which @xmath1 can react to changes in the input .",
    "the dynamical equations , within a continuum , chemical langevin ( cl ) description  @xcite , are given by : @xmath12 where the additive noise contribution @xmath13 , with @xmath14 and @xmath15 denoting the mean of population @xmath16 .",
    "the function @xmath17 is gaussian white noise with correlation @xmath18 .",
    "the @xmath19 brackets denote an average over the ensemble of all possible noise realizations .    for small deviations @xmath20 from the mean populations @xmath15 , eq .",
    "can be solved using a linear approximation , where we expand the rate function to first order , @xmath21 , with coefficients @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",

    "the result is : @xmath24,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where in the second line we have introduced an arbitrary scaling factor @xmath25 ( to be defined below ) inside the brackets , and divided through by @xmath26 outside the brackets .",
    "the solution for @xmath27 has the structure of a linear noise filter equation : @xmath28 , with @xmath29 . in this analogy",
    ", we have a signal @xmath30 together with a noise term @xmath31 forming a corrupted signal @xmath32 .",
    "the output @xmath33 is produced by convolving @xmath32 with a linear filter kernel @xmath34 . as a consequence of causality , the integrals in eq .",
    "run over @xmath35 , so the filtered output @xmath36 at any time @xmath37 depends only on @xmath38 from the past .",
    "the utility of mapping the push - pull system onto a noise filter comes from the application of wk theory , which is designed to solve a key optimization problem : out of all possible causal , linear filters @xmath39 , what is the optimal function @xmath40 that minimizes the differences between the output @xmath36 and input @xmath41 time series . in our example , this means having @xmath27 reproduce as accurately as possible the scaled input signal @xmath42 .",
    "specifically , we would like to minimize the relative mean - squared error @xmath43 . for a particular @xmath44 and @xmath27 , the value of @xmath45 is smallest when @xmath46 , which we will use to define the gain @xmath26 . in this case",
    "@xmath45 reduces to @xmath47 .",
    "the great achievement of wiener  @xcite and kolmogorov  @xcite was to show that @xmath48 satisfies the following wiener - hopf equation : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the correlation between points in time series @xmath51 and @xmath52 , assumed to depend only on the time difference @xmath37 . given @xmath53 and @xmath54 , which are properties of the signal @xmath41 and noise @xmath55 , it is possible to solve eq .   for @xmath48 .",
    "the corresponding minimum value of the error @xmath45 is : @xmath56    the solution of the wiener - hopf equation requires the following correlation functions , which can be derived from eq .  : @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 , where the parameter @xmath60 . plugging these into eq .",
    ", we can solve for the optimal filter function by assuming a generic ansatz @xmath61 , finding the unknown coefficients @xmath62 and rate constants @xmath63 by comparing the left and right sides of the equation . in our case , a single exponential ( @xmath64 ) is sufficient to exactly satisfy eq .",
    "( see details in appendix  [ a : wk ] ) , and we get @xmath65 .",
    "the conditions for achieving wk optimality , @xmath66 , are then : @xmath67 from eq .",
    "the minimum relative error is : @xmath68    the fidelity between output and input is described through a single dimensionless optimality control parameter , @xmath69",
    ". it can be broken up into two multiplicative factors , reflecting two physical contributions : @xmath70 .",
    "the first term , @xmath71 , is a burst factor , measuring the mean number of output molecules produced per input molecule during the active lifetime of the input molecule .",
    "the second term , @xmath72 , is a sensitivity factor , reflecting the local response of the production function @xmath73 near @xmath74 ( controlled by the slope @xmath75 ) relative to the production rate per input molecule @xmath76 .",
    "note that @xmath77 only if @xmath73 is globally nonlinear , since physical production functions satisfy @xmath78 for all @xmath79 . if @xmath73 is perfectly linear , @xmath80 , then @xmath81 , and @xmath82",
    ". thus the limit of efficient noise suppression , @xmath83 , where @xmath84 becomes small , can be achieved by making the burst factor @xmath85 and/or enhancing the sensitivity @xmath86 , at the cost of introducing nonlinear effects ( discussed in detail below ) . for optimality to be realized",
    ", we additionally need an appropriate separation of scales [ eq .  ] between the characteristic time of variations in the input signal , @xmath9 , and the response time of the output , @xmath11 .",
    "the latter should be faster by a factor of @xmath87 .",
    "the scaling @xmath88 for large @xmath69 is the same as the burst factor scaling of the target population variance in biochemical negative feedback networks intended to maintain homeostasis and suppress fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "the slow @xmath89 decay in both cases , compared to the more typical scaling of variance with @xmath90 ( inversely proportional to the number of signaling molecules produced ) reflects the same underlying physical challenge : the difficulty of suppressing or filtering noise in stochastic reaction networks .",
    "the error @xmath45 defined above is based on the instantaneous difference between the input @xmath41 and output @xmath36 time series .",
    "one of the powerful features of the wk formalism is that it naturally extends error minimization to cases where the goal is extrapolating the future signal , where we seek to minimize the difference between @xmath36 and @xmath91 for some @xmath92  @xcite .",
    "given the time delays inherent in many biological responses , particularly where feedback is involved , such predictive noise filtering has significant applications  @xcite , which we will explore in subsequent work . for now",
    ", we confine ourselves to the instantaneous error , which is sufficient to treat the kinase - phosphatase push - pull loop .",
    "we also note that there is no unique measure of signal fidelity .",
    "besides @xmath45 , one can optimize the mutual information between the output and input species in the cascade  @xcite .",
    "for example , in the two - component cascade with nonlinear regulation , considered below , a spectral expansion of the master equation allows for efficient numerical optimization of the system parameters for particular forms of the rate function , maximizing the mutual information  @xcite .",
    "* effects of nonlinearity and discrete populations .",
    "* for the subclass of gaussian - distributed signal @xmath41 and noise @xmath55 time series ( as is the case within the cl picture ) , the wk filter derived above , based on the linearization of the cl , is optimal among all possible linear or nonlinear filters  @xcite .",
    "if the system fluctuates around a single stable state , and the copy numbers of the species are large enough that their poisson distributions converge to gaussians ( mean populations @xmath93 ) , the signal and noise are usually approximately gaussian",
    ". however , the rate function @xmath73 will never be perfectly linear in practice , and thus one needs to consider how nonlinearities in @xmath73 will affect the minimal @xmath45 .",
    "in addition , the discrete nature of population changes , which becomes important at lower copy numbers , has to be explicitly taken into consideration .",
    "surprisingly , the wk result of eq .   can be generalized even to cases where the linear , continuum assumptions underlying wk theory no longer hold .",
    "starting from the exact master equation , valid for discrete populations and arbitrary @xmath73 , we have rigorously solved the general optimization problem for the error @xmath45 between output and input using the principles of umbral calculus  @xcite .",
    "the detailed proof is in appendix  [ a : non ] , but the main results are as follows .",
    "any function @xmath73 can be expanded in terms of a set of polynomials @xmath94 as @xmath95 .",
    "the @xmath94 are polynomials of degree @xmath96 , given by @xmath97 and the coefficients @xmath98 are related to moments of @xmath73 , @xmath99 .",
    "the average is taken with respect to the poisson distribution @xmath100 .",
    "the first two polynomials are @xmath101 and @xmath102 , giving @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",

    "the equality is only reached when @xmath108 and @xmath73 has an optimal linear form , @xmath109 , with all @xmath110 for @xmath111 . in this optimal case , @xmath112 and @xmath113 , and hence @xmath114 , @xmath115 from eq .  .",

    "the input probability distribution @xmath117 is superimposed in black ( the height scale is arbitrary ) .",

    "making @xmath122 large , for example by increasing @xmath123 , is desirable for better signal transduction , but with a caveat .",
    "we can keep @xmath45 near @xmath119 even for a globally nonlinear @xmath73 so long as @xmath73 remains approximately linear in the vicinity of the mean @xmath74 , and the nonlinear corrections @xmath98 for @xmath124 are negligible .",
    "large @xmath123 can be achieved through a highly sigmoidal input - output response , known as ultrasensitivity , which is biologically realizable in certain regimes of signaling cascades  @xcite .",
    "however , our theory predicts that as @xmath73 goes to the extreme limit of a step - like profile around @xmath74 , @xmath45 should become significantly higher than @xmath119 , and the benefits of ultrasensitivity vanish .",
    "the reason for this is that letting @xmath123 become arbitrarily large ( making the step sharper ) necessarily implies that @xmath73 eventually deviates substantially from @xmath125 .",
    "we know that any physically sensible @xmath73 satisfies the constraint @xmath78 for @xmath126 .",
    "if @xmath127 and @xmath128 for @xmath124 , the function @xmath73 would be negative for @xmath129 , violating the physical constraint .",
    "hence the coefficients @xmath98 for @xmath124 must be non - negligible when @xmath123 is sufficiently large , leading to @xmath130 .",
    "we can illustrate this result numerically for @xmath73 that have the form of a hill function , @xmath131 , defined by the three parameters @xmath132 , @xmath133 , and @xmath134 .",
    "this represents a typical sigmoidal behavior in biochemical systems , with a small production rate for @xmath135 switching over to a saturation level @xmath132 for @xmath136 .",

    "is numerically extremely efficient , since the coefficients @xmath98 typically decay quite rapidly , allowing the infinite sum to converge after a small ( @xmath138 ) number of terms .",
    "fixing @xmath137 and @xmath118 is equivalent to specifying the first two moments of @xmath73 , which in turn defines a curve in the three - dimensional parameter space of @xmath132 , @xmath133 , and @xmath134 . after numerically solving for this curve ,",
    "the minimization procedure consists of searching along the curve ( and varying the free system parameter @xmath8 ) to find the parameter set that yields the smallest @xmath45 .",
    "[ f2]a shows optimization results for @xmath139 s@xmath140 , @xmath141 s@xmath140 , @xmath142 s@xmath140 , and varying @xmath118 , with the optimal hill function @xmath73 ( the one with smallest @xmath45 ) at each @xmath118 drawn in a different color .",
    "the corresponding minimal values of @xmath45 are shown in fig .",
    "[ f2]b as circles in the same colors , with @xmath119 using eq .   drawn as a blue curve for comparison .",
    "larger values of @xmath118 have optimal @xmath73 profiles that are increasingly step - like , with steeper slopes near @xmath74 . for the range @xmath143 the maximum slope ( @xmath144 )",
    "is still small enough that @xmath73 remains approximately linear across the entire @xmath3 range where @xmath117 is non - negligible ( the distribution is superimposed in fig .  [ f2]a ) .",
    "hence minimal @xmath45 values are very close to @xmath119 , decreasing with @xmath118 .",
    "the ratios @xmath120 at which these minimal @xmath45 values occur , shown in fig .  [ f2]c , are nearly equal to the predicted value @xmath145 ( blue curve ) .",
    "we can estimate that this near - optimality will persist up to @xmath146 , since that is roughly the slope of an @xmath73 that rises from zero near the left edge of @xmath147 ( at @xmath148 ) to a value of @xmath137 at @xmath149 . for @xmath150 , or equivalently @xmath151 ,",
    "the nonlinearity of @xmath73 becomes appreciable around @xmath74 , distorting the output signal and leading to minimal @xmath45 noticeably larger than @xmath119 , and actually increasing with @xmath118 .",
    "thus moving towards the ultrasensitive limit @xmath152 is initially beneficial for noise filtering , but only up to a point : @xmath73 does not have to be globally linear , but local linearity of @xmath73 near @xmath74 , which can be satisfied readily , is best for accurate signal transduction .        * enzymatic push - pull loop can act as an optimal wk filter .",

    "<S> our theory predicts that optimality can be realized by tuning phosphatase levels , which we verified through simulations of a microscopic model of the loop reaction network , including cases where the system is driven by an oscillatory input  @xcite , which is relevant to recent experimental probes  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the optimality is robust , with the filter operating at near - optimal levels even when the wk conditions are only approximately fulfilled , over a broad range of realistic parameter values . </S>",
    "<S> although illustrated using a push - pull loop , the theory is applicable to a large class of signaling networks , including more complex features such as negative feedback or multi - site phosphorylation of substrates . </S>"
