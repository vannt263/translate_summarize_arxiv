    "generalized coherent states ( gcs ) , associated with algebras other than the oscillator one , have attracted a lot of attention in connection with problems in quantum optics , as well as in other areas ranging from solid state physics to cosmology ( for a recent review see  @xcite ) . to be acceptable from a mathematical viewpoint  @xcite , they have to satisfy a minimum set of conditions : ( i ) normalizability ( as any vector of a hilbert space ) , ( ii ) continuity in their label , and ( iii ) existence of a resolution of unity with a positive - definite weight function ( implying that the states form an ( over)complete set ) .",
    "an important class of gcs is provided by the @xmath0-deformed coherent states ( cs ) , related to deformations of the canonical commutation relation or , equivalently , to deformed boson operators ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . among the latter , those satisfying the relation @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the hermitian conjugate of @xmath4 and @xmath0 is some real constant  @xcite , are often termed maths - type @xmath0-bosons  @xcite because the ` basic ' numbers and special functions associated with them have been investigated in the mathematical literature for over 150 years ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
