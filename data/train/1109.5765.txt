    "after a super - long quietness , the sun begins a new schwabe cycle . on 15 february 2011 , there erupts an x2.2 flare event in active region noaa ar11158 on the solar disk , which was the first x - class goes flare of the current solar schwabe cycle 24 .",
    "several instruments observed this event , including solar dynamics observatory ( sdo ) , nobeyama radio polarimeter ( norp ) and nobeyama radio heliograph ( norh ) , rhessi , chinese solar broadband radio spectrometer ( sbrs / huairou ) , and yunnan solar broadband radio spectrometer ( sbrs / yunnan ) . especially from the broadband radio spectrogram observations at sbrs / huairou and sbrs / yunnan , strong microwave bursts with spectral fine structures , such as",
    "zebra patterns ( zp ) and some other fine structures are registered .",
    "the most interesting and important phenomena is the microwave zp structures .",
    "we have registered three zp structures at different frequency bands and in different phases of the flare .",
    "we will focus on investigating these zp structures in this work .",
    "zp is a fine spectral structure superposed on the solar radio broadband type iv continuum spectrogram , which consists of several almost parallel and equidistant stripes .",
    "most often , zp structures are observed in meter and decimeter frequency range(slottje , 1972 , etc ) . in microwave range",
    "such structure is very rare . from the publications",
    "heretofore , the highest frequency at which zp structure has been observed is about 5.70 ghz ( altyntsev et al , 2005 ) .",
    "recently , chernov et al ( 2011 ) find out some zp evidences at frequency of 5.70 @xmath0 7.20 ghz from the observations of a solar flare on may 29 , 2003 obtained at sbrs / huairou .",
    "however , it is far infrequent to observe zp structure at such high frequency range . additionally , zp structures are typically occurred around the impulsive phase and/or decay phase of solar flares .",
    "it is very rare to find zp structure in the early rising phase of solar flare .",
    "the formation mechanism of zp structures has been a subject of widely discussion for more than 40 years .",
    "the historical development of observations and theoretical models are assembled in the review of chernov ( 2006 ) , zlotnik ( 2009 ) , and so on .",
    "there are several theoretical models to interpret zp structures , which are mainly developed to apply to meter and decimeter wavelengths ( rosenberg , 1972 ; kuijpers , 1975 ; zheleznyakov & zlotnik , 1975 ; chernov , 1976 , 1990 ; labelle , et al , 2003 ; kuznetsev , 2005 ; ledenev , et al , 2006 ; tan , 2010 ; etc ) .",
    "these models can be classified simply into three classes :    \\(1 ) isogenous models , which proposed that all the stripes in a zp structure are generated from a small compact source .",
    "the model of bernstein mode ( bm model ) is the first one to interpret the formation of zp structure .",
    "the emission mechanism is the nonlinear coupling between two bernstein modes , or bernstein mode and other electrostatic upper hybrid waves .",
    "the electrons with non - equilibrium distribution over velocities perpendicular to the magnetic field are located in a small source , where the plasma is weakly magnetized ( @xmath1 ) , and the magnetic field is uniform .",
    "these electrons excite longitudinal electrostatic waves at frequency of the sum of so - called bernstein modes frequency @xmath2 and the upper hybrid frequency @xmath3 .",
    "the bm excitation occurs in relatively narrow frequency band .",
    "the emission frequency ( rosenberg , 1972 ; chiuderi et al , 1973 ; zaitsev and stepanov , 1983 ) is :    @xmath4    here , @xmath5 is the electron plasma frequency , @xmath6 the electron gyro - frequency , @xmath7 is harmonics number .",
    "this model presents the frequency separation between the adjacent zebra stripes just as the electron gyro - frequency : @xmath8 ( zheleznyakov and zlotnik , 1975 ) .",
    "\\(2 ) heterogenous models , which proposed that zebra stripes in a structure are generated from some extended source regions in the magnetic flux tube ( kuijpers , 1975 ; fomichev and fainshtein , 1981 ; mollwo , 1983 ; ledenev , yan , and fu , 2001 ; chernov et al , 2005 ; altyntsev et al , 2005 ) .",
    "one of the important heterogenous model is based on the plasma waves interact with whistler waves ( chernov , 1996 , 2006 ) , called as whistler wave model ( ww model ) . the coupling of plasma wave and whistler wave can operate in different conditions : when whistlers generate at the normal doppler cyclotron resonance they can escape along the magnetic loop and yield fiber bursts ; when whistlers generate at the anomalous doppler cyclotron resonance under large angles to the magnetic field they may form standing wave packets in front of the shock wave , and when the group velocity of whistlers is approximated to the shock velocity , a zp structure with slow oscillating frequency drift will appear .",
    "the whistler wave group velocity peaks at whistler frequency @xmath9 .",
    "the frequency separation @xmath10 between adjacent zebra stripes is about 2 times of whistler frequency : @xmath11 , and then we may obtain : @xmath12 .    the most developed heterogenous model for zp structure generation is called double plasma resonance model ( dpr model ) , which explain zp structure in a natural way ( pearlstein , et al , 1966 ; zheleznyakov & zlotnik , 1975 ; berney & benz , 1978 ; winglee & dulk , 1986 ; zlotnik et al , 2003 ; yasnov & karlicky , 2004 ; kuznetsov & tsap , 2007 ) .",
    "this model proposed that enhanced excitation of plasma waves occurs at some resonance levels where the upper hybrid frequency coincides with the harmonics of electron gyro - frequency in the inhomogeneous flux tube :    @xmath13    the emission frequency is dominated not only by the electron gyro - frequency , but also by plasma frequency .",
    "when the emission generates from the coalescence of two excited plasma waves , the polarization may be very weak , the emission frequency is @xmath14 , and the frequency separation between the adjacent zebra stripes is @xmath15 . here , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath18 and @xmath19 are the scale heights of magnetic field @xmath20 and the plasma density @xmath21 in the source regions , respectively . for @xmath22 and @xmath23",
    ", we may get :    @xmath24    when the emission generates from coalescence of an excited plasma wave and a low frequency electrostatic wave , the polarization will be strong , the emission frequency is @xmath25 , and the frequency separation between the adjacent zebra stripes is @xmath26 . for @xmath22 and @xmath23",
    ", we may get :    @xmath27    equ .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 4 ) indicate that the frequency separation between the adjacent zebra stripes is dominated by both the scale heights of the magnetic field and plasma density .",
    "ledenev et al ( 2001 ) proposed another heterogenous model to interpret the formation of zp structures .",
    "this model ( named as ledenev model ) suggests that the emission generated from an anisotropic energetic electron beam at low cyclotron harmonics in a significantly inhomogeneous magnetic field .",
    "the electron beam is formed as a result of fast local energy release in corona , such as magnetic reconnection , it will excite longitudinal waves at the normal doppler resonance .",
    "the coalescence of upper - hybrid waves and low - frequency longitudinal waves ( @xmath28 ) can produce electromagnetic waves ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "this model gives the cyclotron frequency harmonics ratio as ( sawant et al , 2002 ) :    @xmath30^{1/2}\\ ] ]    @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the electron plasma frequencies corresponding to the level of @xmath7 and @xmath33 harmonics . if density changes slowly in source regions , then @xmath34 , and the frequency ratio of the cyclotron frequency harmonics can be presented roughly as : @xmath35 , @xmath36 ; @xmath37 , @xmath38 ; @xmath39 , @xmath40 ; @xmath41 , @xmath42 , etc .",
    "in this regime , the magnetic field strength in source region can be estimated : @xmath43 , here @xmath44 is the frequency on the zebra stripe with maximum harmonic number @xmath7 .",
    "\\(3 ) propagating model , which proposed that zp stripes are formed in the propagating processes after emitted from its source region . the interference model which suggests that zp is possibly formed from some interference mechanism in the propagating processes ( ledenev , yan , and fu , 2006 ) .",
    "they suppose that there may exist some inhomogeneous layers with small size in solar coronal plasma , and such structure will change the radio wave into direct and reflected rays .",
    "when the direct and reflected rays meet at some places , interference will take place and form zp structure",
    ". however , this model needs a structure with great number of discrete narrow - band sources in small size . tan ( 2010 )",
    "proposed that such structure may exist in the current - carrying flaring plasma loop , where the tearing - mode instability forms a great number of magnetic islands which may provide the main conditions for the interference mechanism .",
    "zp is the most intriguing fine structure on the dynamic spectrogram of solar radio observations , especially the microwave zp structures , which may provide the original information of the solar flaring region , such as the magnetic field , particle acceleration , and the plasma parameters , etc . in this work ,",
    "the observations and data analysis of the microwave zp structures associated with the x2.2 flare are presented in section 2 , section 3 is the physical discussion on the microwave zp structures , especially the estimations of the magnetic field strengths from different zp models , and pinpoint the reasonable interpretation of the zp structures . at the final ,",
    "some conclusions are summarized in section 4 .",
    "the active region ar11158 appeared near the center of the solar disk in the rising phase of the current solar cycle 24 .",
    "it developed from a simple @xmath45- to a complex @xmath46-configuration rapidly during 12 21 february 2011 .",
    "it produced an x2.2 flare on 15 february 2011 .",
    "this flare was a two - ribbon white - light flare showed in the image of hmi / sdo , and accompanied with a large coronal mass ejection which launched just towards the earth . from the soft x - ray emission obtained by goes ,",
    "the flare starts at 01:46 ut , reaches to the maximum at 01:56 ut , and ends at 02:07 ut ( maurya , reddy , & ambastha , 2011 ) .    in this work",
    ", we focused on the observations obtained from sbrs / huairou and sbrs / yunnan .",
    "sbrs / huairou is an advanced solar radio telescope with super high cadence , broad frequency bandwidth , and high frequency resolution , which can distinguish the super fine structures from the spectrogram ( fu et al 1995 ; fu et al 2004 ; yan et al , 2002 ) .",
    "it includes 3 parts : 1.10 @xmath0 2.06 ghz ( with the antenna diameter of 7.0 m , cadence of 5 ms , frequency resolution of 4 mhz ) , 2.60 @xmath0 3.80 ghz ( with the antenna diameter of 3.2 m , cadence of 8 ms , frequency resolution of 10 mhz ) , and 5.20 @xmath0 7.60 ghz ( share the same antenna of the second part , cadence of 5 ms , frequency resolution of 20 mhz ) . the antenna points to the solar center of automatically controlled by a computer .",
    "the spectrometer can receive the total flux density of solar radio emission with dual circular polarization ( left- and right handed circular polarization ) , and the dynamic range is 10 db above quiet solar background emission . and the observation sensitivity is : @xmath47 , here @xmath48 is quiet solar background emission .",
    "similar to other several spectrometers , such as phoenix ( 100 @xmath0 4000 mhz , benz et al , 1991 ) , ondejov ( 800 @xmath0 4500 mhz , jiricka et al , 1993 ) and bbs ( 200 @xmath0 2500 mhz , sawant et al , 2001 ) , sbrs / huairou have no spatial resolution .",
    "however , as the sun is a strong radio emission source , a great deal of works ( e.g. dulk , 1985 , etc ) show that the microwave bursts received by spectrometers are always coming from the solar active region when the antenna points to the sun .",
    "additionally , we also adopt the observations at sbrs / yunnan , which operating frequency band is in 0.65 @xmath0 1.50 ghz , with a spectral resolution of 1.4 mhz , and time resolution of 80 ms , by using a 10-meter diameter antenna .    during the x2.2 flare ,",
    "sbrs / huairou has two parts ( 2.60 @xmath0 3.80 ghz and 5.20 @xmath0 7.60 ghz ) on duty , sbrs / yunnan and norp also obtained perfect radio observations .",
    "fig.1 presents the profiles of the microwave flux at frequencies of 1.00 , 2.00 , 2.85 , 3.75 , 6.82 , 9.40 , 17.00 , and 35.00 ghz in 01:45 @xmath0 02:30 ut observed at sbrs / huairou and norp . as a comparison ,",
    "the profiles of goes soft x - ray intensities at wavelengths of 1 @xmath0 8 (goes8 ) and 0.5 @xmath0 4 (goes4 ) are plotted in panel ( 9 ) of fig.1 .",
    "additionally , the plasma temperature derived from the ratio of goes soft x - ray emission fluxes at the two wavelength bands ( thomas , starr , & crannell , 1985 ) is also over - plotted .",
    "here , we find that the maximum temperature ( at about 01:53 ut ) is prior to the goes flare peak ( 01:56 ut ) for about 3 minutes .    from the scrutinizing of the microwave spectrogram",
    ", we find that there is a strong microwave type iv burst with spectral continuum in the frequency range of 0.65  1.50 , 2.60  3.80 , 5.20  7.60 ghz , and the corresponding microwave enhancements are also occurred at frequency of 9.40 , 17.00 , 35.00 ghz . superposed on these continuum enhancements , we identify many kinds of fine structures , such as type iii bursts , spike bursts , patches , fast quasi - periodic pulsations ( qpp ) , fibers and zp structures .",
    "the main part of the microwave bursts at low frequencies occurred after the goes flare peak .",
    "however , at the higher frequency range , the main part of the microwave bursts are prior to that of lower frequencies .",
    "most of the fine structures are occurred at the moderate frequency band of 2.60  3.80 ghz after the goes flare peak , only one segment of microwave zp structure occurred prior to the goes flare peak ( marked as zp1 in fig.1 ) which frequency is around 6.70 ghz .",

    "the arrows indicate the positions of zp structures on the profiles .",
    ", width=15 ]    in this work , our interesting is mainly focused on microwave zp structures .",
    "there are 3 segments of microwave zp structures registered on the microwave spectrogram : the first one occurred at frequency of about 6.70 ghz ( zp1 ) , the second one is at about 2.68 ghz ( zp2 ) , and the third one is at about 1.08 ghz ( zp3 ) . with a simple glance , we find that the higher frequency of zp structure appears at the earlier flare phase , while the lower frequency of zp structures take place in the later flare phase .",
    "the following is the details .",
    "\\(1 ) microwave zp structure at 6.40 @xmath0 7.00 ghz    in the frequency of 5.20 @xmath0 7.60 ghz , the microwave emission always behaves as continuous type iv burst , and the fine structure is very rare during solar flares .",
    "however , the most interesting phenomenon is an zp structure occurred at frequency of around 6.70 ghz in the x2.2 flare .",
    "the left panel of fig.2 is the spectrogram of the zp structure observed at sbrs / huairou .",
    "it shows that the frequency range of the structure is occurred from 6.40 to 7.00 ghz with a central frequency of 6.70 ghz .",
    "the time interval is from 01:49:50.2 to 01:49:51.5 ut , just at about 4 minutes after the onset of the flare ( 01:46 ut ) , and about 6 minutes before the goes flare peak ( 01:56 ut ) .",
    "the duration of the zp structure lasts for about 1.3 s. it is composed with 3 stripes in distorted sinusoidal wave shape arrayed on the longitudinal direction .",
    "the whole sinusoidal wave shape drifts slowly to the low frequency , and the drifting rate is about -300 mhz / s .",
    "the frequency bandwidth of the zebra stripes is about 40 @xmath0 60 mhz .",
    "the frequency separation between the adjacent zebra stripes is about 80 @xmath0 120 mhz , and the relative frequency separation is @xmath49 1.17  1.76 % , increases slowly with respect to time .",
    "the emission of the structure is strongly left - handed circular polarization with polarization degree ( defined as @xmath50 , here r and l are the emission flux subtracted the background emission ) close to 100% .",
    "additionally , the zp presents superfine structures : each zebra stripe consists of millisecond spikes which are practically vertical bright lines in the spectrogram with duration at the limit of the time resolution ( 5 ms ) and the bandwidth of about 40 ",

    "at the same time , fig . 2 is also implying another feature : the emission intensity on the zebra stripes decreases from the low frequency stripe to the high frequency stripes .",
    "fig.2 indicates that the zebra stripes of zp1 are in distorted sinusoidal wave shapes . if we suppose that the pattern is a mixture of a general zp structure and a quasi - periodic pulsation ( qpp ) , then it is easy to understand the distorted sinusoidal wave shapes .",

    "the result of dpr model gets the furthest consistency with the takakura model and the dulk & mclean model with m=3 when estimate the magnetic fields in source regions of zp1 and zp2 . especially in zp2 , estimations of the magnetic field from dpr model and takakura model are also consistent with the result obtained from fiber bursts at the similar frequency range .",
    "so , we prefer to suppose that the dpr model is possibly the real model for the zp structures observed in this work . however , there is a 2 times difference between dpr model and takakura model in zp3 source region .",
    "it may just reflect that the takakura model is valid only within a magnetic loop . in our above estimations , the height of the zp3 source region is about 61 mm , which is more than two times of distance ( @xmath59 29 mm ) between the two foot - points of the loop , such height should be much higher than the loop - top .",
    "it is possible that the source region of zp3 is located at another different magnetic loop with a larger @xmath60 and a much low @xmath61 . as lack of such observations",
    ", we can not confirm such inference .    in section 2",
    "we have pointed out that zp1 is possibly a mixture of a general zp structure and a qpp , and the qpp is a very short - period pulsation ( vsp ) . from the work of tan ,",
    "et al ( 2007 ) and tan , et al ( 2010 ) , we may suppose that the qpp is possibly a result of modulations of the resistive tearing - mode oscillations in the current - carrying flare plasma loops with high temperature .",
    "the panel ( 9 ) of fig.1 indicates that temperature around zp1 22 mk ) is very close to the maximum of the profile , it is possible that the modulations of the resistive tearing - mode oscillations take place .",
    "the current - carrying plasma loop can drive the tearing - mode oscillation and modulate the microwave emission to form vsp . on this vsp background ,",
    "some mechanism generate the zp structure .",
    "on 15 february 2011 , there erupts an x2.2 flare event on the solar disk , which was the first x - class flare occurred since the solar cycle 24 . associated with this flare event ,",
    "three microwave zp structures at different frequencies are registered in different phases of the flare : the first is registered from sbrs / huairou at frequency of 6.40 @xmath0 7.00 ghz , which is very unusual at such high frequency band and in the early rising phase of the flare ; the second is also registered from sbrs / huairou , at frequency of 2.60  2.73 ghz in the decay phase of the flare , possibly it may extend to the frequency lower than 2.60 ghz ; the third is registered from sbrs / yunnan at frequency of 1.04  1.13 ghz , in the decay phase after far from the flare peak .    by scrutinizing the current prevalent theoretical models of zp structures ( including bernstein model , whistler wave model , dpr model , and the ledenev model ) , comparing their estimated magnetic field strengths in the corresponding source regions , we find that the dpr model is much more possible for explaining the generation of microwave zp structures .",
    "it derived the magnetic field strengths as about 230  345 g , 126  147 g , and 23  26 g in the source regions of zp1 , zp2 , and zp3 , respectively .",
    "comparison with the diagnostics of fiber bursts and the previous empirical model , we suggest that such estimations are acceptable .",
    "it should be noted that dpr model is not self - contained when we adopt it to diagnose the magnetic fields in zp source regions .",
    "it needs the supplement of the inhomogeneity model of plasma density and magnetic field .",
    "however , it is not easy to get the exact inhomogeneity models .",
    "so far , all the existing models ( e.g. dulk & mclean model , takakura model , etc ) of plasma density and magnetic field are proposed that the plasma density and magnetic field change with the height , and expressed as functions of height ( @xmath62 or @xmath63 ) .",
    "such method implies that the inhomogeneous scale heights of magnetic field is also a function of magnetic field , and this is the origin of the self - contradictions .",
    "we need a more perfect model which can provide the inhomogeneous scale lengths of plasma density and magnetic field , and they are independent of the magnitude of magnetic field strength .",
    "the magnetic field diagnostics of bm model and ww model are independent of the inhomogeneity models , they seem to be the perfect models to diagnose the magnetic field in the source region by zp structures .",
    "but they are not likely to agree with the zp structures observed in this work .",
    "however , we should be noted that either the dulk & mclean model , or the takakura s model is only a simplified model .",
    "the actual regime during the microwave burst with zp structures should be extremely dynamic processes , the real magnetic topology is also much more complex and changeable than the depiction of the above models .",
    "so far , the only thing we can do is to obtain the approximated estimations .",
    "the relative large difference of the magnetic estimations in zp3 source region between dpr model and the takakura s model just reflect that its source region should be located at different magnetic loop with different distance of the foot - points and different different initial magnetic field .    from the above discussions ,",
    "we know that the exact inhomogeneity models of magnetic field and plasma density are most important .",
    "however , so far , because of lack of imaging observation with spatial resolutions in the corresponding frequencies , it is difficult to obtain the configuration features of the coronal magnetic field in the source region . to overcome such problems ,",
    "we need some new telescopes , for example , the constructing chinese spectral radioheliograph ( csrh , 0.4 - 15 ghz , will be finished before 2014 ) in the decimetric to centimeter - wave range ( yan et al , 2009 ) and the proposed american frequency agile solar radiotelescope ( fasr , 50 mhz - 20 ghz ) ( bastian , 2003 ) . when these instruments begin to work",
    ", we may obtain the solar radio observations with high spatial - temporal resolutions at multi - frequency channels .",
    "one of the most important way to measure the coronal magnetic field is to probe zp structures in each subareas with high spatial resolutions , and deduce the magnetic field from certain theoretical models . with these development",
    ", we will get more perfect understanding of the elementary processes in solar flares .",
    "the authors would like to thank the anonymous referee for the helpful and valuable comments on this paper .",
