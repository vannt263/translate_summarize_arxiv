    "<S> we report the first measurements of the effect of pressure on vibrational modes in emulsions , which serve as a model for soft frictionless spheres at zero temperature . as a function of the applied pressure , we find that the density of states @xmath0 exhibits a low - frequency cutoff @xmath1 , which scales linearly with the number of extra contacts per particle @xmath2 . moreover , for @xmath3 , @xmath4 ; a quadratic behavior whose prefactor is larger than what is expected from debye theory . </S>",
    "<S> this surprising result agrees with recent theoretical findings @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the degree of localization of the softest low frequency modes increases with compression , as shown by the participation ratio as well as their spatial configurations . </S>",
    "<S> overall , our observations show that emulsions are marginally stable and display non - plane - wave modes up to vanishing frequencies .    due to their translational symmetry , </S>",
    "<S> the vibrational modes of crystals are plane waves that exhibit the debye scaling in the density of states , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the spatial dimension . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , amorphous materials , such as granular materials and glasses , exhibit peculiar elastic properties . in particular , they display an excess of low frequency vibrational modes in the density of states compared to crystalline solids , known as the `` boson '' peak  @xcite . in simple model systems , such as sphere packings , </S>",
    "<S> the boson peak diverges in amplitude as the pressure is lowered towards the unjamming transition  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the associated soft modes are responsible for anomalous elastic and transport properties  @xcite and play an important role in plasticity and activated events @xcite . as the applied pressure increases above the jamming transition , their spatial localization increases  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> theoretically , it was argued that these properties result from the fact that packings near jamming are _ marginally stable _ : their structure is such that they lie at the threshold of a linear elastic instability controlled by pressure and coordination  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> very recently , a mean - field approximation @xcite and exact calculations in infinite dimensions  @xcite indicated that for marginally stable structures at low frequencies @xmath4 in any spatial dimension , where @xmath7 is a characteristic frequency of the soft modes . in three dimensions , </S>",
    "<S> this quadratic behavior matches the debye result , but with a much larger prefactor . </S>",
    "<S> this result remains untested in real materials .    </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , the density of states of colloidal glasses in 2d has been obtained from the thermal motion of the particles as a function of the global density below the glass transition  @xcite . however </S>",
    "<S> , experimental tests on athermal particulate packings and in 3d are lacking in the literature , and are appropriate to accurately test if materials are indeed marginally stable . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we experimentally investigate the pressure dependence of the density of states and the localization of vibrational modes in compressed emulsions . because emulsions are effectively at zero temperature , the present experiment appears close enough to the jamming transition to precisely probe its properties . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the density of states can be rescaled by some frequency @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the packing fraction and @xmath10 its ( preparation dependent ) value at the jamming threshold , and find that it is consistent with the recently proposed scaling behavior @xmath11@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we examine the microscopic configuration of the soft modes by measuring the participation ratio of the particles and their spatial distribution . </S>",
    "<S> we find delocalized soft modes near jamming , and localized soft modes far above jamming .     </S>",
    "<S> ( color online ) confocal image of an emulsion at a pressure of @xmath12  kpa and @xmath13 ( greyscale ) . for each reconstructed droplet @xmath14 in the middle </S>",
    "<S> , the low - frequency vibrational amplitude in the color map ( dim to bright ) is obtained as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the polarizaton vector of the @xmath17th eigenmode , summing over the lowest @xmath18 modes . ]        </S>",
    "<S> our experimental system is an oil - in - water emulsion , described in references  @xcite , which is a model for soft , frictionless , athermal sphere packings with an average droplet radius @xmath19 and a polydispersity of @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> the refractive index matched emulsion is transparent and the nile red dye reveals the 3d packing of droplets using a confocal microscope ( leica tcs sp5 ii ) . due to a density difference between the droplets and the continuous phase , the lowest compression rate is achieved by creaming under gravity , which gives a packing fraction of @xmath21 due to polydispersity , while centrifugation for 20 minutes at an acceleration rate of 3000 g leads to highly compressed structures with @xmath22 @xcite . allowing the emulsion to relax to its uncompressed state over a period of several days </S>",
    "<S> probes a broad range of intermediate packing densities  @xcite , an example of which is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the packings are analyzed using a fourier transform algorithm to identify the particle positions and radii  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we then extract the repulsive force @xmath23 exerted by particle @xmath24 on particle @xmath14 via the princen model  @xcite : @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 denote the particle positions , @xmath28 is the area of droplet deformation , or the geometric area of overlap between the reconstructed spheres  @xcite , @xmath29 is the weighted mean radius of the droplets , and @xmath30 is the interfacial tension . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore sum over the force moment tensor for all contacts @xmath31 and then divide by the volume of the box to obtain the total pressure on the system , @xmath32 from the forces , we construct the interaction potential between contacting particles @xmath33 , where @xmath34 . this potential is harmonic for small deformations . </S>",
    "<S> to ensure mechanical equilibrium , we numerically quench the system into the nearest energy minimum to satisfy force balance using the method of steepest descent  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this procedure does not move any of the particles beyond the resolution of the droplet finding technique , which is one third of a voxel size ( i.e. @xmath35 nm , or @xmath36 of the average droplet diameter ) . </S>",
    "<S> this correction does not have a measurable effect on the calculation of the density of states done below and gives validity to the force model in eq .  .    </S>",
    "<S> we then calculate the corresponding hessian matrices , defined for every pair @xmath14 , @xmath24 of particles in contact as @xmath37 , where the first term stems from the contact stiffness and the second from the contact force : @xmath38 and @xmath39 where the notation @xmath40 indicates that particle @xmath41 is in contact with particle @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the polarization vectors @xmath42 and the eigenfrequencies @xmath43 can now be calculated via solution of the eigenvalue problem @xmath44 where @xmath45 denotes the mass of particle @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> note that in our system inertia is negligible , and dynamically modes would be overdamped . </S>",
    "<S> here we have included the masses to allow for a closer comparison with the literature . </S>",
    "<S> an alternative choice is to set @xmath46 for all @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> then our analysis would correspond to the normal modes of the hessian , which characterize the amplitude of thermal fluctuations ( independently of the damping mechanism ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have checked that both choices lead to essentially identical results .    </S>",
    "<S> the amplitudes of the polarization vectors @xmath42 are visualized in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> since each particle must have all its neighbors and forces identified , we use @xmath47 particles in the middle of the experimental packing for each compression and repeat the experiment three times to collect statistics . </S>",
    "<S> we thus obtain a histogram of eigenmodes , i.e. the density of states @xmath0 , where @xmath48 is shown in units of natural frequency in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](a ) for different levels of compression . </S>",
    "<S> the microscopic frequency is given by @xmath49rad / s , where stiffness @xmath50 .    </S>",
    "<S> as expected , the log - log representation reveals a cut - off frequency at high values , and a progressive increase in the number of low - frequency modes as we approach the jamming transition under gravity , in agreement with numerical simulations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> excess soft modes are generally characterized by the ratio @xmath51 , which often presents a maximum in simulations and in experiments on molecular glasses  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our results do not reveal a maximum in @xmath52 , as shown in the supplemental material , similar to previously observed data from numerical packings of soft spheres  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> this absence of a peak can be understood in terms of the effect of the experimental control parameter , the pressure , on the system . </S>",
    "<S> pressure affects vibrational properties in two distinct ways : first , it affects the packing fraction , which in turn increases the mean number of contacts between particles , or coordination @xmath53 , and tends to stabilize the system further . </S>",
    "<S> this is illustrated in the inset of fig.[fig2](b ) , from previous measurements in the same set - up @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> second , pressure directly has a destabilizing effect that can lead to a `` buckling '' phenomenon where soft modes become unstable  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these effects can be disentangled by considering the density of states with and without the applied stress term , i.e. by using @xmath54 or @xmath55 , respectively in eq.[007 ] . in the latter case </S>",
    "<S> , we keep the geometric configurations that were formed due to the applied pressure , but we effectively replace our droplets by point particles connected with relaxed springs . as predicted  @xcite , we find that @xmath0 is affected by pressure only below a certain crossover frequency , @xmath1 , which is extracted as the frequency below which the densities of states with and without the pressure term begin to deviate ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> s1 in si ) . note that @xmath52 has a maximum near @xmath1 if @xmath56 alone is considered .    </S>",
    "<S> marginal stability  @xcite indicates that as pressure increases , the stabilizing effect of increasing coordination ( apparent when considering @xmath56 alone ) precisely matches the direct destabilizing effect of the pressure ( induced by the term @xmath57 in the hessian ) . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> the packing just makes enough contacts to remain stable . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , it can be proven that @xmath58 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm this prediction in fig.[fig2](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> these findings agree quantitatively with theory and numerical simulations  @xcite , unlike recent colloidal experiments probing the jamming transition  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> .     for the rescaled @xmath59 for all pressures shows good agreement with the predicted slope of @xmath60 in eq.[dw ] . ]            </S>",
    "<S> another prediction of marginal stability is that there is no debye regime at all . </S>",
    "<S> instead , the theory of marginal stability leads to @xmath61 below @xmath1 @xcite , with a factor larger than the theoretical prediction for the debye model  @xcite , which would predict that @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> rescaling our data in fig.[fig2](a ) by @xmath59 reveals a satisfying data collapse for all pressures in fig.[fig.3 ] , consistent with eq.[dw ] . </S>",
    "<S> this result is in agreement with recent numerical simulations in high dimensions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath1 decreases to zero at the jamming transition , the regime below @xmath1 becomes progressively smaller , and the experimental resolution may not be high enough to definitively rule out the debye result . </S>",
    "<S> however , together with the softening of modes with compression , our results strongly support marginal stability .    </S>",
    "<S> next , we study the degree of localization of vibrational modes by computing the participation ratio @xmath63 of a mode @xmath17 as a function of the applied pressure : @xmath64 the value of @xmath63 ranges from @xmath65 to @xmath66 , from modes localized to one particle to extended modes , in which all particles participate . </S>",
    "<S> fig.[fig3](a ) shows that the higher the compression and the lower the frequency , the lower the participation ratio , suggesting increasing localization . </S>",
    "<S> this observation is consistent with 2d experiments  @xcite , three dimensional  @xcite and higher dimensional simulations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the participation ratio does not report on the spatial configuration of the participating particles . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore useful to visualize the increase in the degree of localization using a color map ( from light to dark blue ) for the vibrational amplitudes of the lowest frequency mode in the packing under gravity and that of the highest compression , @xmath67kpa , as shown in fig.[fig3](b , c ) , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these configurations clearly show the distinction between extended and localized modes . at intermediate frequencies and pressures , </S>",
    "<S> the modes exhibit a coexistence between localized and disordered modes .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have characterized experimentally the effect of pressure on the spectrum of the vibrational modes for compressed emulsions . </S>",
    "<S> our central results are that both the scaling of the characteristic frequency @xmath1 as well as the behavior of @xmath0 for @xmath68 are consistent with the notion that emulsion are marginally stable . in the range that can be probed experimentally , </S>",
    "<S> our observations agree with recent quantitative mean - field theories describing such a marginal behavior @xcite , giving empirical support for these views . in the future </S>",
    "<S> , it would be very interesting to study if marginal stability is robust to different system preparations , and if it survives at very large compression  @xcite .    </S>",
