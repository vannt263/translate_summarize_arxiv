    "just as nuclear bound states and resonances have been important in understanding the nature of nuclear forces , the su(3 ) structure of the single - hadron ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) spectrum led to the quark model and qcd .",
    "it is likely that the multi - hadron spectrum can further reveal the properties of qcd as well as of the effective hadron exchange forces .",
    "in particular the transition from a multi - hadron resonance to single hadrons is also a transition between the regions of perturbative asymptotic freedom and non - perturbative confinement in qcd , an important process of which we know little .",
    "but multi - hadron structures have many sources .",
    "some are dominated by long - range forces that can be described by hadron exchange potentials ( confined quark clusters ) and others by the short - range quark and gluon degrees of freedom .",
    "the former are usually called molecular and the latter exotic structures .",
    "the long - range dominated structures may arise from single- or multi - channel effects .",
    "we need to classify the structures by their experimental properties in order to deduce the implications for the dynamics .",
    "we can learn about these relations from a model that adequately includes the physics of both the long- and short - range regions .",
    "rgm calculations with a sufficiently large number of quark configurations approach this behavior and have given useful results for specific cases @xcite .",
    "the r - matrix method @xcite , which connects the short - range perturbative qcd and the long - range hadronic region by a specified boundary condition , has the advantage of a more adequate treatment of the non - perturbative region , simpler calculations , and an analytic formulation that enables us to classify and describe structures according to the dynamical origin .",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ] represents two components of the pp wave function , ( a )  being the perturbative dirac quark component with gluon exchange , and component  ( b ) described by a two - proton wave function interacting via meson exchange .",
    "there are other components like  ( b ) in which one or both nucleons are substituted for by the even and odd parity nucleon isobars .",
    "given a complete set of internal wave functions @xmath4 that vanish at @xmath5 , with total energy eigenvalues @xmath6 , r - matrix theory determines the external hadron wave function at energy @xmath7 , @xmath8 , , where @xmath9 is the radial wave function .",
    "] by the boundary condition at @xmath10 ( corresponding to @xmath5 ) r_0^_w ( r_0 ) = f(w ) _",
    "w(r_0)f(w ) = f_0 + _ i [ eq:1 ] and _",
    "i^ = -r_0 _ ^i _ ^i [ eq:2 ] where the @xmath11 are the fractional parentage coefficients of the @xmath12 channel component of @xmath13 in the @xmath4 wave function . integrating the schrdinger equation from @xmath10 to large  @xmath14",
    "one obtains the s - matrix .",
    "the positions of the poles and branch points of the s - matrix determine the structures ( and any bound states ) of the two - hadron system .",
    "the above model enables us to describe the effect of all dynamical components on these singularities , with implications for their experimental characteristics .",
    "these features are all present in the simple case of two coupled channels with different thresholds ( such as @xmath15 ) , with the neglect of the off - diagonal potential",
    ". then the scattering of an incoming channel of orbital angular momentum @xmath16 is described by @xcite s_l_le^2i_l = [ eq:3 ] where f_eff(w ) = f_l , l(w ) - . [ eq:4 ] where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the relativistic relative momenta in the @xmath16 and @xmath19 channels , _",
    "l ( k , r_0 ) = r_0 [ eq:5 ] and the @xmath20 are the outgoing and incoming jost functions , approaching the spherical hankel or the coulomb functions at large range .",
    "their analytic properties determine that the @xmath21 are real for imaginary @xmath17 ( below threshold ) and are complex for real  @xmath17 . for a negligible strength potential _ l(k , r_0 ) = l + ik r_0 .",
    "poles of the s - matrix in the complex energy ( @xmath7 ) plane will produce significant structure in the energy dependence of scattering amplitudes if they are close enough to the physical cut . or",
    ", if they are on the real @xmath7 axis , then they must be below the minimum strongly coupled two - particle mass ( @xmath17 imaginary for all channels ) and represent a bound state .",
    "also significant structure may be caused by inelastic branch points ( @xmath22 for a coupled channel ) with a sufficiently strong discontinuity , representing strong coupling between channels .",
    "the sources and character of each type of structure can be inferred from eqs.[eq:1][eq:4 ] .",
    "a pole of the s - matrix requires a zero of @xmath23 , and an observable structure in the continuum further requires that the @xmath7 dependence of den be sufficiently rapid in the vicinity of the zero .",
    "the diagonal potential in channel  1 is represented by @xmath24 .",
    "eq.[eq:5a ] shows that if @xmath25 ( see fig.[fig:2](a ) ) there will be a bound state in the absence of a potential .",
    "the attraction is then due either to the core @xmath26 or to the coupled channels in @xmath27 .",
    "if the potential is attractive ( see fig.[fig:2](b ) ) , @xmath28 will be negative below threshold and there may be a bound state for @xmath29 or even for a repulsive core @xmath30 . from eq.[eq:5 ] one can infer that in the continuum ( real @xmath17 ) , the pole will not be near the physical cut ( producing a narrow resonance ) unless @xmath17 is small ( an  anti - resonance \" ) or the potential is nonmonotonic producing a potential barrier and rapid variation of @xmath31 . alternatively the rapid variation may be in the @xmath27 term , which by eq.[eq:4 ] requires either that the coupling @xmath32 be large ( a large potential coupling will have the same effect ",
    "see fig.[fig:2](c ) ) , or that the denominator @xmath33 vanish ( see fig.[fig:2](d ) ) for @xmath34 .",
    "the former causes a resonance below the second channel threshold or even a bound state due entirely to interchannel coupling @xcite . for small @xmath35",
    "the associated pole @xcite is far from the physical cut and the structure is an @xmath16-th order cusp produced by the inelastic branch point . as @xmath35 increases the pole comes nearer , and the structure forms into a broad resonance below the threshold going further down in energy and becoming narrower with further increase of @xmath35 .",
    "the latter case ( vanishing @xmath36 ) is a state that would be bound if there were no coupling to the first channel , but leaks into that channel through the coupling .",
    "the smaller the coupling the narrower the resultant  dalitz  tuan \" resonance @xcite .",
    "the position of the resonance stays near the zero of @xmath36 .",
    "if the channels are only coupled by weak or electromagnetic forces , the result will be a very narrow resonance .",
    "none of the above structures are importantly affected by the positions or residues of the poles due to the interior quark states .    however , in the vicinity of quark configuration energies ( see figs.[fig:1 ] and [ fig:2](e ) ) the @xmath37-matrix poles cause a rapid variation of @xmath27 . the positions of these resonances are near the quark state energies , and the splittings for a given quark configuration are determined by the one - gluon exchange matrix elements .",
    "the width of the resultant structure depends on @xmath38 ( eq.[eq:1 ] ) , which is decreased from the scale of @xmath39 by the fractional parentage coefficients .",
    "this results in widths of @xmath40  mev to @xmath41  mev , easily detected with the resolution of multi - gev beams .",
    "it is important to note that any very narrow resonances observed experimentally are more readily described by molecular  dalitz",
    " tuan \" resonances than by exotic resonances induced by quark degrees of freedom .",
    "there are many examples of potential bound molecular states , the deuteron and other nuclei among them .",
    "barrier potential resonance examples are represented by @xmath12 unstable and fissioning nuclei .",
    "the @xmath42 and @xmath43 states near the @xmath44 threshold are well understood @xcite as driven by the @xmath44 threshold branch point .",
    "the @xmath45 and the @xmath46 are caused by the coupling to @xmath47 and @xmath48 systems , respectively ; either through the strong coupling or by the  dalitz ",
