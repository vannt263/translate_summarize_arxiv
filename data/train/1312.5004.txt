    "the accurate modeling of gravitational waves from the late - inspiral and merger of binary neutron stars can only be achieved within the framework of numerical relativity and exploiting the tools of computational relativistic hydrodynamics . assuming the simplest physical scenarios , _",
    "i.e. _  irrotational binaries in quasi - circular orbits , and idealized equations of state , _",
    "i.e. _  polytropic of gamma - law , very accurate numerical - relativity waveforms for binary neutron stars are nowadays available , _ e.g.",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "however , obtaining good - quality waveforms to fully cover the large parameter space of possible binary - neutron - star configurations , equations of state and compactnesses , seems to be out of the reach for current - generation codes .",
    "the main reason behind this difficulty is to be found in the small convergence order , _ i.e. _",
    "@xmath1 , typical of general - relativistic hydrodynamics codes , and which has a number of undesired consequences . among these , the fact that obtaining high - accuracy waveforms from low - order codes requires very high spatial resolutions ( and hence very high computational costs ) , or the fact that the analysis of the waveforms is spoiled by the large phase uncertainties typical of these simulations . both of these difficulties can be resolved in part by employing new , state - of - the - art schemes that are able to go over the second - order of convergence typical of general - relativistic hydrodynamics codes . using these techniques , we were recently able to achieve , for the first time , higher than second - order convergence in both the phase and amplitude of the gravitational - wave radiation from binary neutron stars @xcite .",
    "these new advances could potentially enable a more systematic study of the gravitational radiation from binary neutron stars , similarly to what has been done for the case of binary black - holes , _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to give a full description of the methods we employed in @xcite and to describe in detail our new high - order , high - resolution shock - capturing , finite - differencing code : ` whiskythc ` , which represents the extension to general relativity of the ` thc ` code presented in @xcite . when compared with other high - order relativistic hydrodynamics codes , such as ` wham ` @xcite and ` echo ` @xcite , this is the first higher - than - second - order code that works in full general relativity , _ i.e. _  with dynamical spacetime , and in three spatial dimensions .",
    "first , we demonstrate the capabilities of the new code in a series of tests involving the evolution of isolated neutron stars .",
    "more specifically , we show that the code is able to yield long - term and accurate evolutions of stable and unstable stars .",
    "we measure the accuracy of the code for the case of an unstable star collapsing to a black hole and show that we are able to achieve third - order convergence .",
    "second , we consider the performance of the code in calculating the inspiral and merger of binary neutron stars in quasi - circular orbits .",
    "we show higher than second - order convergence for the phase and the amplitude of the gravitational waves produced in this process . when compared with the performance of our previous ` whisky ` code , which adopts the standard second - order schemes commonly employed for matter simulations in numerical relativity",
    ", we can show that the new code is able to yield a decrease in the phase error of a factor @xmath2 for simulations with the same resolution and with similar computational costs .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : grthc.hydro ] we quickly recall the equations of general - relativistic hydrodynamics and the ccz4 formalism used to evolve the spacetime for the tests presented here . in section [ sec : grthc.code ] we give a quick summary of the numerical methods that we employed , as well as a detailed description of the treatment of the fluid ",
    "vacuum interfaces , which was one of the main challenges in the application of higher - order numerical schemes to binary - neutron - stars simulations . in section [ sec : grthc.sns ] we present the results obtained with our code in a series of representative tests involving the evolution of isolated neutron stars , with particular focus on the properties of the different vacuum treatments implemented in the code . in section [ sec : grthc.bns ]",
    "we present results obtained in the case of binary neutron stars and , finally , we dedicate section [ sec : grthc.conclusions ] to the discussion of our results and to the conclusions .",
    "we use a spacetime signature @xmath3 , with greek indices running from 0 to 3 and latin indices from 1 to 3 .",
    "we also employ the standard convention for the summation over repeated indices .",
    "unless otherwise stated , all quantities are expressed in a system of units in which @xmath4 .",
    "in this work we adopt the usual 3 + 1 formalism , _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite , to decompose spacetime into space - like hypersurfaces with normal @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the lapse function and @xmath7 is the shift vector . within this formalism the spacetime metric @xmath8 is split as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the spatial three - metric metric , which , together with the extrinsic curvature @xmath11 , @xmath12 being the lie derivative along @xmath13 , fully determines the geometry of each leaf of the foliation .",
    "furthermore we will indicate with @xmath14 and @xmath15 the ricci tensor and scalar associated with the levi - civita connection on the spacelike hypersurfaces of the foliation , respectively .",
    "the matter content of the spacetime is described through its energy - momentum tensor @xmath16 , which , within the 3 + 1 split of spacetime , can be decomposed in its time , spatial and mixed components as ( see , _ e.g. _  , @xcite ) @xmath17 finally , we will use the convention of raising and lowering indices of spatial tensors with the ( spatial ) three - metric , unless otherwise stated .",
    "for the solution of the einstein equations we adopt the covariant and conformal formulation of the z4 equations ( ccz4 ) .",
    "we recall that the z4 formulation can be obtained from the covariant lagrangian @xmath18 by means of a palatini - type variational principle  @xcite , where @xmath19 is the metric determinant .",
    "the variational principle yields the field equations @xmath20 as well as a set of constraints fixing the connection @xmath21 and the algebraic constraint @xmath22 if eq .",
    "( [ eq : grhydro.z4.constraint ] ) is satisfied then eqs . ( [ eq : grhydro.z4.fieldeq ] ) and ( [ eq : grhydro.z4.connection ] ) reduce to the standard einstein field equations .",
    "otherwise @xmath23 gives a measure of the deviation of the solution from the one of the original einstein equations .",
    "in addition we point out that it is possible to show that the condition that the first derivatives of @xmath23 vanish amounts to imposing the adm momentum and hamiltonian constraints @xcite .",
    "the key idea of the z4 formalism is to develop a set of evolution equations starting from the lagrangian ( [ eq : grhydro.z4.lagrangian ] ) , _ without explicitly enforcing ( [ eq : grhydro.z4.constraint ] ) _ , _ i.e. _  treating @xmath23 as a new independent variable .",
    "the resulting set of equations is then strongly hyperbolic , _ i.e. _  free from the zero - speed modes of the original adm system , and the solution of the einstein equations is obtained exploiting the fact that the z4 evolution system preserves the constraint ( [ eq : grhydro.z4.constraint ] ) , _ i.e. _  @xmath24 . in particular ,",
    "if the initial - data is constraint satisfying , the z4 evolution recovers the solution of the einstein equations , even though @xmath23 is an evolved variable . in practice",
    ", however , small numerical errors introduce constraint violation during the evolution , for this reason the z4 system is usually modified , with the addition of terms that cancel out in the case in which the constraints are satisfied , to ensure that eventual constraint violations are propagated away and damped exponentially @xcite .",
    "the version of z4 that we employ was recently introduced by @xcite and is based on a conformal decomposition of the original z4 system and aims at exploiting well - tested gauge conditions together with the constraint propagation and damping properties of the original z4 formulation .",

    "@xmath114 , and use the appropriate upwind - biased reconstruction operators separately on both parts , in order to guarantee the stability of the method .",
    "there are several different ways to perform such a split and in our code we implemented two of them : the roe flux - split , _",

    "the roe flux - split is less dissipative and yields a computationally less - expensive scheme , since only one reconstruction is required instead of two , but its use can result in the creation of entropy - violating shocks in the presence of transonic rarefaction waves ( see , _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) , and it is also susceptible to the carbuncle ( or odd - even decoupling ) phenomenon @xcite . to avoid these drawbacks , we switch from the roe to the lax - friedrichs flux",
    "split when @xmath118 or @xmath99 are not monotonic within the reconstruction stencil .",
    "we now go back to the more general system of equations ( [ eq : valencia ] ) .",
    "the derivatives @xmath119 can be computed following the procedure outlined above on a component - by - component basis .",
    "this approach is commonly adopted in the case of low - order schemes , but it often results in spurious numerical oscillations in the high - order ( usually higher then second ) case . to avoid this issue",
    "the reconstruction should be performed on the local characteristic variables of the systems . to avoid an excessively complex notation ,",
    "let us concentrate on the fluxes in the @xmath84-direction ; in this case , to reconstruct @xmath120 , we introduce the jacobian matrices @xmath121 where @xmath122 is an average state at the point where the reconstruction is to be performed . in our code @xmath123 and @xmath124",

    "@xmath133 and with @xmath134 its inverse .",
    "we define the local characteristic variables @xmath135 and compute @xmath136 doing a component - wise reconstruction , where @xmath137 is used in place of @xmath118 and @xmath138 in place of @xmath99 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lax.friedrichs.split ] ) .",
    "finally , we set @xmath139 this procedure is repeated in the other directions and yields the wanted approximations of the @xmath140 terms in @xmath75 . in all of the results presented here the reconstruction is typically performed in local characteristic variables .",
    "exceptions are low - density points ( at least for some of the atmosphere prescriptions ; more on this below ) or points which , on the basis of the value of the lapse function , we estimate being inside an apparent horizon . in these cases we switch to the component - wise reconstruction of the fluxes with lax - friedrichs flux - split .    the primitive variables are recovered after each sub - step using a numerical root - finding procedure . in particular ` whiskythc ` uses the eos and primitive variables recovery framework recently developed for the ` whisky ` code and described in details in @xcite .",
    "the only differences between our approach and the one discussed there is that 1 ) we do not alter the conservative quantities to match the primitive ones in the case in which adjustments have been made , 2 ) to ensure the well behaviour of the eigenvectors ( which become degenerate if the sound speed goes to zero ) we enforce a floor on @xmath141 ( more on this in the next section ) .",
    "the reason why we do not alter the conserved quantities in case of failures is that we prefer to rely on the evolution to bring them back into the physically allowed region , instead of changing them in an arbitrary manner .",
    "we also note that any adjustment made in the recovery can be simply interpreted as an error in the calculation of the flux / source terms    finally , our code has been tested using a rather basic subset of the features supported by ` carpet ` @xcite , the amr driver of the ` cactus ` computational toolkit @xcite on top of which our code is built . ` carpet ` supports berger - oliger - style mesh refinement @xcite with sub - cycling in time and refluxing .",
    "at the moment , our code has been tested only with static grid refinement .",
    "it supports sub - cycling in time , but not refluxing . while we have plans to implement refluxing and",
    "test high - order prolongation operators in order to use dynamical grids , we also note that these features are not of fundamental importance for the study of gravitational waves from inspiraling binary neutron stars , which is the main aim of our code .",
    "the treatment of interfaces between vacuum region and fluid regions is one of the most challenging problems in eulerian ( relativistic ) hydrodynamics codes ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) , especially when studying near - equilibrium configuration , such as an oscillating compact star , having large density gradients close to the surface and over long timescales .",
    "the most commonly used approach to treat vacuum regions is to fill them with a low - density fluid , the `` atmosphere '' , such that if a fluid element is evolved to have a rest - mass density below a certain threshold , it is set to have a floor value and zero coordinate velocity  @xcite .",
    "this approach works reasonably well for standard second - order codes and has been adopted by the vast majority of the relativistic - hydrodynamics codes , but it is problematic for higher - order codes @xcite .",
    "the reason is that small numerical oscillations can easily result in the creation of very low - density regions that with the prescription for the floor , violating the conservative character of the equations and creating artificially mass , energy and momentum . as a result , they are subsequently amplified , ultimately destabilizing the evolution .",
    "the situation is even more complicated for a code , such as ours , which relies on characteristic variables as they become degenerate in the low - density , low - temperature limits .",
    "we notice that for many applications , such as the inspiral of binary neutron stars ( at least up to contact ) , or the oscillation of single stars , the treatment of the stellar surface is one of the main challenges and the only reason why low - order , but robust shock capturing codes are commonly used .",
    "indeed the problem of the vacuum treatment is one of the main obstacles on the road to high - order general - relativistic hydrodynamics codes .",
    "for this reason , it is instructive to address this problem in detail as we do in the following .",
    "however , before going into the details of the treatment , it is useful to make two rather general remarks .",
    "first , we should point out that the mp5 scheme is remarkably robust even in conjunction with the most basic atmosphere treatment that we implemented , _",
    "i.e. _  one in which no additional modification is made on the scheme at the interface between vacuum and fluid region , beside the imposition of a minimum rest - mass density level ( more on this below ) . in our preliminary tests , other schemes , such as weno5 , which do not enforce the monotonicity of the reconstruction , could not yield stable evolutions even for single stars in the cowling approximation .",
    "second , most of the problems with the atmosphere appear in points where the surface of the star is aligned with the grid , because along these directions the numerical dissipation is minimal .",
    "these artefacts , that we discuss in more detail in the next section , are easily `` fixed '' with the use of extra numerical dissipation close to the surface of the star . keeping this in mind",
    ", we now give the details of the three different prescriptions that we developed for the treatment of the low - density regions .",
    "the first prescription is what we call the `` ordinary mp5 '' approach .",
    "it follows the lines of what is most commonly done to treat vacuum in general - relativistic hydrodynamics .",
    "first , we choose a minimum rest - mass density @xmath142 , which we take to be , typically , in the range @xmath143 , @xmath144 being some reference rest - mass density ( normally the initial maximum rest - mass density ) .",
    "second , we choose a tolerance parameter , @xmath145 , typically @xmath146 , chosen to avoid excessive oscillations of the fluid  vacuum interface so that points where the rest - mass density falls below @xmath147 , are set to atmosphere .",
    "in particular , the rest - mass density is set to @xmath142 , the velocity to zero and the internal energy is calculated assuming a polytropic eos .",
    "in addition , we enforce a floor for the conserved energy density @xmath141 , @xmath148 .",
    "as we show below , this approach , is already perfectly adequate for inspiraling binary neutron stars , but it might have problems in the case of slowly moving vacuum - fluid interfaces aligned with the grid , especially in the case of isentropic evolutions where the surface remains a sharp interface and no spurious heating can occur .      in order to improve our atmosphere treatment , we introduced an alternative method in which we increase the level of dissipation of the scheme by switching to the component - wise lax - friedrichs flux split below a certain rest - mass density .",
    "typical values for this new threshold are chosen so that the first one or two grid points in the stellar interior are evolved using the lax - friedrichs flux split .",
    "the use of component - wise reconstruction , as opposed to characteristic - wise , is done to avoid problems due to the degeneracy of the characteristic variables close to vacuum and to avoid polluting quantities , such as the linear momentum , with the numerical errors present in the internal energy ( which is typically large in the immediate vicinity of the atmosphere ) .",
    "this is what we refer to as `` mp5+lf '' approach .",
    "this latter approach is more robust , but can also result in the creation of artefacts in the case in which low - density matter is ejected from the stellar surface . in this case , the fluid typically presents a rather smooth interface with vacuum , so that one would expect to be able to treat it with high accuracy . unfortunately , as we show in the next section , if the rest - mass density of the ejecta falls below the lax - friedrichs threshold , the use of a component - wise reconstruction yields a rather oscillatory solution , with the creation of patchy regions of lower / higher rest - mass density in very dynamical situations ( _ cf . _  second panel in figure  [ fig : grthc.migration.rho2d ] and the discussion there ) .",
    "overall neither of the previous methods is completely satisfactory .",
    "for this reason we propose here a novel approach based on the use of the positivity preserving limiter recently proposed by @xcite , which is significantly simpler to implement than the `` classical '' positivity - preserving limiters already proposed in the literature , _ e.g. _  @xcite .    for the sake of completeness ,",

    "( [ eq : grthc.pp.split ] ) is done in a component - by - component fashion .",
    "for instance in three dimensions ( [ eq : grthc.pp.split ] ) becomes    @xmath173 + \\nonumber \\\\    & & \\hskip -1.3 cm   \\frac{\\alpha_y}{2 } \\bigg [ \\bigg(u^n_{i , j , k } +        2 \\frac{\\lambda_y}{\\alpha_y } f_{i , j-1/2,k}\\bigg ) +      \\bigg(u^n_{i , j , k } - 2 \\frac{\\lambda_y}{\\alpha_y }      f_{i , j+1/2,k}\\bigg)\\bigg ] + \\nonumber \\\\    & & \\hskip -1.3 cm \\frac{\\alpha_z}{2 } \\bigg [ \\bigg(u^n_{i , j , k } +        2 \\frac{\\lambda_z}{\\alpha_z } f_{i , j , k-1/2}\\bigg ) +      \\bigg(u^n_{i , j , k } - 2 \\frac{\\lambda_z}{\\alpha_z }      f_{i , j , k+1/2}\\bigg)\\bigg]\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath174 are positive constants such that @xmath175 , typically chosen so as to be equal to @xmath176 ( but see the remarks at the end of the section ) .",
    "the limiter at each interface is then chosen enforcing positivity of the terms in the round brackets .",
    "this approach can then be easily extended to systems of equations @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xcite constructed a limiter able to guarantee the positivity of rest - mass density and pressure for the classical equations of hydrodynamics also in the case in which source terms are present .    in the general - relativistic case , it is not trivial to enforce the positivity of the pressure , especially for tabulated eos , because of the presence of complex source terms in the energy equations .",

    "@xmath178 and @xmath179 , is formally equivalent to the newtonian continuity equation after the identification @xmath180 thus one can construct a scheme ensuring the positivity of @xmath181 by simply adopting the prescriptions used by @xcite to guarantee the positivity of the density for the newtonian euler equations .    some comments should be made on the positivity preserving limiter .",
    "first , the positivity preserving limiter is not directly a way to treat vacuum ",
    "fluid interfaces in a physically accurate way , for the simple reason that the fluid model is not adequate to represent such transitions . a proper modeling of the stellar surface can only be done by treating it as a free boundary of the problem determined by the balance between inertial and gravitational forces on the fluid as done , for instance , in @xcite . for this reason",
    "its use does not free us from having a low - density fluid everywhere or from having to manually enforce that @xmath182 .",
    "this may be necessary because in some situations , for instance at the surface of a star , the high - order fluxes and the lax - friedrichs fluxes can differ by several orders of magnitude , so that small floating - point errors can drift the conserved density , @xmath181 , below the minimum .",
    "this is done by simply resetting @xmath181 to @xmath183 whether @xmath184 , without changing the other quantities .",
    "what the positivity preserving limiter does , however , is to ensure local conservation of the solution up to floating - point precision .",
    "this is because the floor for the fluid s rest - mass density can be _ arbitrarily small _ and does not require any tuning . as a result , de - facto it prevents the scheme from extracting / losing mass from / to the atmosphere because of numerical oscillations .",
    "in contrast , the classical atmosphere prescriptions usually work only in a limited range of @xmath142 and @xmath145 as these coefficients must be tuned in order to achieve a balance between the amount of mass extracted from the atmosphere ( which typically increases as @xmath142 decreases ) and the mass lost into it ( which typically increases as @xmath145 increases ) . with the positivity preserving limiter instead , in situations where we need to reset @xmath181",
    ", we are guaranteed that this correction is of the order of the floating - point precision with respect to the typical rest - mass densities we are actually interested in tracking .    the way in which we use the positivity preserving limiter is rather simple : we fill the vacuum with a low rest - mass density floor at the beginning of a simulations and we let it evolve freely , only relying on the positivity preserving limiters to ensure its proper behaviour .",
    "this typically results in the creation of accretion flows onto our compact objects .",
    "however , given the low rest - mass density of the floor , which we take to be @xmath185 ( _ i.e. _  below floating - point precision ! ) , the effects of this artificial accretion are completely negligible .    to avoid problems with the decomposition of the jacobian in eigenvalues and eigenvectors , we also switch to component - wise reconstruction below a certain rest - mass density , typically @xmath186 , but this , in contrast to the prescription outlined in the previous section , has little dynamical effect as flows at those densities are , anyway , completely dominated by numerical effects .",
    "moreover , as we show in the next section , even if the floor rest - mass density is taken to be unnecessarily large , the use of positivity preserving limiters results in much smaller perturbations with respect to the use of a more traditional atmosphere treatment .    finally , a comment concerning the timestep constraint , as this may be seen as the only real limitation of the positivity preserving approach . for the scheme to ensure positivity in the multi - dimensional case , one must ensure @xmath187 . since @xmath188 and @xmath189 , @xmath190 being the number of dimensions , this results in a rather stringent courant - friedrichs - lewy ( cfl ) condition . in practice",
    "we find our scheme to be robust even for much larger timesteps , probably because the advection velocity in the low rest - mass density regions is typically smaller than the maximum velocity and because lax - friedrichs scheme is actually positivity preserving even with courant factor @xmath191 in one dimension @xcite [ @xmath192 in @xmath190 dimensions , even though it is not possible to guarantee that @xmath193 and @xmath194 in eq . ( [ eq : grthc.pp.split ] ) are separately positive ] . in order to use larger timesteps ,",

    "overall , the rest - mass conservation is at acceptable levels for all the methods , _",
    "@xmath221 , but the ordinary mp5 prescription is clearly the one with the largest error , as it shows larger variations with respect to the other schemes .",
    "this , in turn , is responsible for the secular drift mentioned earlier ( an increase in the total rest mass leads to an increase in the central rest - mass density ) .",
    "the lax - friedrichs flux - switch at the surface , instead , results in a steady loss of matter which is slowly diffused into the atmosphere , while the mp5+pp approach yields a steady increase in the rest mass because of the accretion of the low - density floor which is continuously `` injected '' from the outer boundary ( we simply fix the rest - mass density in the ghost regions at the outer boundary to its initial value ) .",
    "+ mp5     + mp5+lf     + mp5+pp    the reason for the bad behaviour of the standard mp5 prescription is that , as anticipated in the previous section , it lacks a sufficient amount of numerical dissipation in the case of surfaces aligned with the grid and especially for polytropic evolutions , such as the ones we show here .",
    "this is clearly seen in figure [ fig : grthc.cowling.rho2d ] where we show a two - dimensional cut of the rest - mass density , in @xmath222 scale , at a representative time during the evolution .",
    "one can clearly see the appearance of `` jets '' of low - density matter ( @xmath223 ) aligned with the coordinate directions ( see bottom part of each panel for a one - dimensional cut along the @xmath84-direction ) .",
    "these `` jets '' are launched at seemingly random times from the surface of the star , when the numerical errors `` extract '' from the atmosphere a large enough amount of rest mass .",
    "what happens is that the numerical oscillations create an imbalance at the surface of the star : the excess density coming from the atmosphere generates a pressure which is only balanced by the `` potential barrier '' at the surface of the star given by the double threshold on the rest - mass density floor .",
    "as soon as the pressure is large enough , part of the matter is ejected in one of these streams .",
    "this process effectively results in the increase of the total rest mass of the star because only part of this extra matter is actually lost from the outer boundary .",
    "in contrast , we can see that , with the addition of extra numerical dissipation at the surface of the star , these artefacts are completely suppressed , as shown for the mp5+lf case .",
    "this happens partly because dissipation prevents the scheme from extracting too much matter out of the atmosphere and partly because it diffuses the numerical errors back into the floor .",
    "finally , the positivity - preserving evolution does not show any kind of numerical ejecta out of the star s surface because of its conservative nature . on the other hand it is affected by the accumulation of matter at the fluid - vacuum interface .",
    "as commented before , this accumulation can be greatly reduced by lowering the floor rest - mass density and it is also somewhat less severe for the gamma - law eos case , where the floor accretion is regulated by the thermal pressure .     one dimensional cut along the @xmath84 axis showing the @xmath84 component of the conserved linear momentum , @xmath224 , at the time @xmath225 , for the perturbed tov in the cowling approximation and for different atmosphere prescriptions .",

    "one would expect the linear momentum to simply oscillate with the @xmath218-mode frequency . on the other hand , in a simulation , because of numerical errors , the profile of the eigenfunction is gradually lost .",

    "the mp5+lf schemes have accumulated so much error that the profile of the eigenfunction is completely distorted . on the other hand",
    "the evolution using the positivity - preserving limiter still shows a good agreement with the exact solution . clearly the precision with which we recover",
    "the eigenfunction is resolution dependent and degrades over time also for the mp5+pp scheme .",

    "the data is taken at the approximate time when the first orbit is completed and the centers of the two stars are aligned along the axis .",
    "since this happens at two different times for ` a.mp5.h2 ` ( blue lines ) and ` a.ppm.h2 ` ( red lines ) , the lines in the figure show data taken at two slightly different coordinate times . particularly important in this comparison is the velocity profile inside the stars , as the velocity in the low - density atmosphere around the stars is in any case dominated by unphysical numerical effects as neither of the two codes is able to provide a reasonable description of the stellar surface .",
    "the velocity in the interior , on the other hand , is directly related to the orbital motion of the two stars and hence to the gravitational - wave phase .    as can be seen from the figure , the ` whisky ` code is not able to transport the velocity profile of the star correctly ; rather , the higher numerical dissipation has the effect of slowly `` flattening '' both the rest - mass density and the linear - momentum profiles in the stellar cores .",
    "since this flattening proceeds at different rates for the two different fields , it results in a distortion of the linear velocity profile ( and of other related physical quantities ) , which , in turn , results in a small deformation of the stars . in this case ,",
    "the artificial deformation is such that the stars become less compact , thus less efficient in losing angular momentum via gravitational waves and hence delaying the time of merger .",
    "we expect this deformation to be the leading source of error in the phase evolution for the ` whisky ` code , at least for the high - compactness stars considered here .",
    "we have presented a new multi - dimensional , general - relativistic hydrodynamic code , ` whiskythc ` , born from the merger of the ` whisky ` and the ` thc ` codes .",
    "this code inherited from ` whisky ` the primitive recovery routine as well as a new eos framework with support for composition and energy dependent realistic equation of state @xcite , and from ` thc ` the use of high - order flux - vector splitting finite - differencing schemes @xcite .",
    "this is the first genuinely higher - than - second - order fully general - relativistic code .    amongst the new techniques introduced with ` whiskythc `",
    "is the use of positivity - preserving limiters @xcite as a way to treat low - density regions alternative to the traditional `` atmosphere '' prescriptions .",
    "we have shown that this treatment is able to significantly improve the quality of simulations involving isolated neutron stars and to effectively remove the loss of the conservative properties of the equations in the boundary between the stellar surface and the ambient atmosphere . because the introduction of positivity preserving limiters in any hydrodynamics code is rather straightforward and allows one to use arbitrarily small values of the atmosphere , we recommend its use as the method of choice for the evolution of compact stars .",
    "we have also demonstrated the accuracy of our code in a series of classical tests involving the linear and nonlinear evolution of isolated neutron stars . in particular , we have shown that our code is able to stably evolve isolated stars for a long time and can attain high order ( _ i.e. _  third ) of convergence in the simulation of the gravitational collapse of nonrotating stars to black holes .    finally , we have applied our code to the simulation of the late - inspiral and merger of two neutron stars in quasi - circular orbits .",
    "using rather small - separation binaries to test the dependence of the results on the atmosphere treatment , we have shown that our results are completely independent of it .",
    "furthermore , we have demonstrated the higher order of convergence and accuracy of our new code when compared with our old ` whisky ` code , which implements the standard second - order schemes that are commonly employed for matter simulations in numerical relativity .",
    "in particular , we have found higher than second - order convergence in the phase and an overall phase error which , at the same resolution and with similar computational costs , is estimated to be @xmath343 times smaller than the one for ` whisky ` for the binaries we considered and at moderate resolution .",
    "our future plans include the exploitation of the efficiency of the high - order methods in ` whiskythc ` to pursue a systematic investigation of tidal effects in binary - neutron - stars mergers , as well as in black - hole neutron star binaries , using realistic equation of states and compactness parameters .",
