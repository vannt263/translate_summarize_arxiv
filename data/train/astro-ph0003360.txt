    "the wfpc2 camera on the hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) has made it possible to determine the morphologies of galaxies at intermediate redshift and beyond .",
    "it has been known for some time that the photometric and spectral properties of galaxies in intermediate redshift clusters differ from galaxies in nearby clusters ; the population of blue , star - forming galaxies and post - starburst galaxies is larger at intermediate redshift , see e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "given the correlation between the spectral and morphological properties of galaxies ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , we might be able to detect a corresponding evolution of galaxy morphology in intermediate redshift clusters .",
    "however , the evolution of morphology is likely to be more subtle than spectral evolution , since galaxies of the same morphological type can have significantly different star formation rates ( e.g. @xcite ) .    in the most ambitious study of this sort with wfpc2 to date",
    ", the morphs group have classified over 1200 galaxies in 10 clusters at 0.37@xmath8z@xmath80.56 ( @xcite ) .",
    "they find that s0 galaxies are less common than in low redshift clusters and that the ratio of s0 s to e s within a radius of @xmath4600 kpc ( for h@xmath9=50 , q@xmath9=0.5 ) decreases with redshift , falling from 2 in low redshift clusters to less than 0.5 at @xmath10 .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) have independently classified galaxies in a wfpc2 image of cl0939 + 4713 , one of the less concentrated clusters in the morphs sample .",
    "they find a ratio of s0 s to e s of @xmath42 , quite comparable to a low-@xmath7 reference sample in the coma cluster .",
    "however , they classify 40 - 50% of the galaxies in cl0939 + 4713 as spirals ( s ) , in contrast with 20 - 30% s in a comparable region of the coma cluster .",
    "the sample of galaxies in cl0939 + 4713 is relatively small ( @xmath470 ) , and redshifts are available for less than one third of these .",
    "@xcite present a study of the morphological types in three clusters at @xmath7=0.31 , also using wfpc2 images .",
    "there is substantial overlap between the authors of this paper and the morphs group , and the two groups have attempted to adopt a consistent morphological system . at @xmath7=0.31 , couch et al .",

    "however , averaged over the three clusters , within 400 kpc , they find a ratio of s0 s to e s at most slightly depressed relative to regions of comparable galaxy surface density in low-@xmath7 clusters .. reference population becomes increasingly dominated by e s , @xcite ] note , however , that the average @xmath7 of the morphs clusters is larger ( 0.46 ) .",
    "@xcite report the morphological types in two more distant clusters at @xmath130.9 .",
    "one cluster , cl0023 + 04 , appears to be composed of two low velocity dispersion groups , and contains predominantly s s .",
    "the other , cl1604 + 43 , with a velocity dispersion of @xmath41200 km s@xmath14 , contains @xmath476% early - types . in the latter case ,",
    "the s0/e ratio is found to be 1.7@xmath150.9 .",
    "this result is sensitive to the assumed morphological composition of the foreground / background population , but is evidence that the s0/e ratio does not decline smoothly with @xmath7 .",
    "our approach is complementary to the @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite studies which predominantly describe the galaxy morphologies in cluster cores .",
    "we use mosaics of wfpc2 fields to study the galaxy population in a larger region ( allowing larger galaxy samples per cluster ) , and we have acquired large numbers of spectra of cluster galaxies .",
    "the spectra remove ambiguity about cluster membership and allow us to directly connect the morphological and spectral properties of the galaxies .",
    "our sample of clusters is x - ray selected , with x - ray luminosities exceeding 4@xmath1610@xmath17 erg s@xmath14 in the 0.24.5 kev band .    in cl1358 + 62 at @xmath7=0.33 , we have drawn a complete sample of 518 galaxies to a magnitude limit @xmath0=22 from a wfpc2 mosaic image of cl1358 + 62 covering 53 square arcminutes .",
    "spectra for 276 of the 518 galaxies in the morphological sample were previously obtained at the multiple mirror and william herschel telescopes .",
    "the color - magnitude relation of the 194 spectroscopically confirmed cluster members in the _ hst _ mosaic ( 3 are fainter than @xmath0=22 ) has been previously described in @xcite .",
    "the spectroscopic properties of 232 cluster members ( some outside the _ hst _ mosaic ) , as well as the cluster dynamics have been described in @xcite .",
    "our objectives in this paper are fourfold .",
    "( 1 ) we introduce the morphological classification techniques that we will apply to our entire sample of clusters .",

( 4 ) we connect the spectral and morphological types of the cluster galaxies .    the paper is organized in the following fashion . in @xmath18 2 , we describe the photometric catalog from which the morphological sample was drawn . the two set of morphological classifications are discussed in @xmath18 3 .",
    "the morphological composition of the cluster and evidence for morphological evolution are presented in @xmath18 4 .",
    "the connection between the morphological and spectral properties of the galaxies is made in @xmath18 5 .",
    "@xmath18 6 contains a brief discussion and conclusions .",
    "our photometric catalog , from which we draw galaxies for morphological classification , is derived from the _ hst _ f814w mosaic image .",
    "the techniques used to construct the mosaic are described in @xcite .",
    "our use of the mosaic image , instead of individual wfpc2 ccd frames , slightly compromises the accuracy of the photometry , but considerably simplifies the source detection problem by eliminating most of the boundaries . because our goal is to select a sample of galaxies for morphological classification to a consistent magnitude limit , rather than to perform precision photometry , this is a beneficial tradeoff .",
    "we used the sextractor package , described by @xcite , to detect the galaxies and perform the photometry .",
    "we use a detection and analysis threshold of 24.5 mag arcsec@xmath19 , and a zeropoint of 30.546 ( 3600 s exposures , may 1997 wfpc2 synphot update ) to convert from instrumental magnitudes to a cousins @xmath0 magnitude magnitude , which is very close to the natural f814w system referred to a vega zeropoint ( @xcite ) ] .",
    "the adopted zeropoint is the average of the value for the 3 wfpc2 ccds , which vary by @xmath4@xmath150.01 magnitudes .",
    "we use the sextractor total magnitude estimator ( see @xcite ) , which is insensitive to the analysis threshold .    in order to allow convenient comparisons with the results of the morphs group ( @xcite ) ,",
    "we calculate a conversion of observed @xmath0 magnitudes ( for @xmath200.6 ) to a @xmath21 magnitude in the rest frame .",
    "some of the morphs classifications used wfpc2 f702w filter data , so we also derive a consistent conversion from f702w magnitudes to a rest frame @xmath21",
    ". the intent in @xcite was to work to a consistent limit of @xmath1=-20 , but a transcription error from table 9 of @xcite led to the adoption of a deeper limit of @xmath1@xmath4 - 19 .",
    "( here and throughout we use @xmath1 to refer to a rest frame @xmath21 absolute magnitude . ) in contrast with @xcite , we also apply an evolutionary correction to allow a closer comparison with low @xmath7 clusters .",
    "we adopt the @xcite cosmological model ( h@xmath9=50 km s@xmath14 mpc@xmath14 , q@xmath9=0.5 )    we use four numbers in addition to the distance modulus to convert from the wfpc2 magnitudes to @xmath1 : ( 1 ) the conversion from the vega - referenced wfpc2 natural filter system to cousins filter bands , ( 2 ) the @xmath7-dependent @xmath22 correction to transform the observed cousins @xmath23 and @xmath0 magnitudes to the rest frame , ( 3 ) the estimated rest frame galaxy colors , and ( 4 ) a @xmath7-dependent evolutionary correction .",
    "each of these numbers depends on the spectral energy distribution of the galaxies , so the accuracy of this procedure is limited .",
    "we use these numbers , however , only to choose sample limiting magnitudes appropriately scaled with @xmath7 .",
    "we adopt the approximate expressions described below for these conversions .",
    "we first fit a linear relation to the synthetic transformation of f702w to @xmath23 as a function of @xmath24 ( valid for @xmath24@xmath81.5 ) , using results from fig .",
    "10 of @xcite :    @xmath25  ( 1a )    we take the @xmath24 colors of galaxies as a function of @xmath7 from @xcite , with a morphological mix of 70% e and 30% sbc to convert ( 1a ) to :    @xmath26  ( 1b )    to a good approximation ( 0.1 mag ) , fig",
    ".  9 of @xcite shows :    @xmath27  ( 1c )    we fit polynomials to the average @xmath22 corrections of @xcite and @xcite , using 70% e and 30% sbc or sc contributions :    @xmath28  ( 2a )    @xmath29  ( 2b )    from @xcite we take :    @xmath30  ( 3a )    @xmath31  ( 3b )    from the the early - type galaxy fundamental plane study of @xcite we derive an evolutionary correction :    @xmath32  ( 4 )    the corrections are applied in the following fashion :    @xmath33    here , @xmath34 is the distance modulus . applying these expressions to cl1358 + 62 , with a distance modulus at @xmath35 of 41.62 , we find that the morphs limit of @xmath1=-20 corresponds to an observed @xmath0=20.5 .",
    "our photometric catalog completeness extends below @xmath36 , but we have limited our morphological sample to @xmath5 to increase the reliability of the morphological classifications . at @xmath5 , we attain a signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) that is very similar to the s / n attained at the @xmath36 classification limit adopted by the morphs group for their deeper images ( @xcite ) .",
    "the standard deviation of the sky noise in our ( 3600 s ) cl1358 + 62 image has an equivalent surface brightness of 24.4 mag arcsec@xmath19 , as compared with 25 mag arcsec@xmath19 typical for the ( @xmath412600 s ) morphs images .",
    "a crude scaling relation can be derived by assuming that all galaxies have the same surface brightness , and that our criterion is that classifications of equal reliability require the same number of pixels at the same s / n . for a shallower image , we can effectively bin the image of a brighter galaxy that is @xmath37 times larger @xmath38 pixels to achieve a s / n that is @xmath37 times better . to recover a sky s / n deficit of 0.6 mag ,",
    "we need to set a limit @xmath41.2 mag brighter .",
    "there are 518 galaxies in the morphological catalog after removing stars and image artifacts . in the rest frame",
    ", the filter central wavelength corresponds to @xmath46100  .",
    "we use the f814w images for morphological classification because they are deeper than the f606w images . @xcite",
    "have used either f702w and f814w images for classification at comparable redshifts ( between 0.37 and 0.41 ) .",
    "below , we describe two sets of morphological classifications .",
    "the first set was carried out by the authors of the paper using the techniques described in @xmath183.1 .",
    "we realized that our classifications would be of greater value if we could compare them with morphological classifications from an external expert .",
    "alan dressler ( ad ) kindly agreed to independently classify the entire sample .",
    "dressler is a member of the morphs group , and most importantly , has classified a large reference sample of low-@xmath7 cluster galaxies .",
    "the strength of the ad classifications is that the same experienced classifier has classified the galaxies at low and intermediate redshifts .",
    "consistency has obvious benefits when searching for evolution .",
    "however , it is important to keep in mind the difficulty of classifying these relatively faint and small galaxies from wfpc2 images . the brighter cluster ellipticals and s0 s in cl1358 + 62 ( @xmath39 ) have effective radii ( half - light radii ) , r@xmath40 , of 0.5@xmath41 to 0.6@xmath41 .",
    "the faintest galaxies in the sample ( @xmath4222 ) have r@xmath40@xmath40.3@xmath41 .",
    "the 50% encircled energy radius of wfpc2 stellar images measured from our frames is about 0.17@xmath41 , so the numbers of meaningful information elements are small : typically 20 to 40 .",
    "for this reason , we can not be sure that agreement on a common morphological system is the most significant issue .",
    "even the most experienced classifier may not account for all the systematic differences between the low @xmath7 ( photographic ) and the intermediate @xmath7 wfpc2 images . by comparing the two sets of morphological classifications",
    "we will be able to discern which aspects of the classification are most robust .",
    "the 518 sample galaxies were independently classified along the revised hubble sequence by df , mf and pvd from 96@xmath1696 pixel `` postage - stamps '' drawn from both the mosaic and original individual ccd images .",
    "we referred frequently to @xcite and @xcite , as well as to artificially redshifted digital images drawn from the nearby field galaxy survey ( @xcite ) .",
    "we assigned numerical types as follows : -5 ( elliptical ) , -4 ( elliptical or s0 ) , -2 ( s0 ) , 0 ( s0 or sa ) , 1 ( sa ) , 3 ( sb ) , 5 ( sc ) , 7 ( sd ) , 9 ( sm ) , 10 ( i m ) and 99 ( peculiar or merger ) .",
    "intermediate types ( 2 , 4 , 6 , and 8) were also assigned .    for 80% of the galaxies ,",
    "the three independent classifications span a range of three or fewer numerical types ( we consider -4 , -2 and 0 to be adjacent numerical types ) , and agree exactly for 34% of the sample . for 6% of the sample",
    ", the object is considered unclassifiable by one or more of the authors , or else the classifications disagree wildly . in these cases ,",
    "we assign a numerical type of 999 .",
    "the remaining 14% are classified type 1 or later by all the authors , but with a broader range of classifications .",
    "table 1 lists the combination rules used to assign types where the agreement is not exact , including type 15 for indeterminate late types .",
    "following the completion of the df / mf / pvd classifications , ad independently classified the cl1358 + 62 galaxies according to techniques described in @xcite .",
    "ad does not assign galaxies to the df / mf / pvd intermediate types -4 ( e or s0 ) or 0 ( s0 or sa ) in the same fashion , preferring to subdivide these into e / s0 ( -4 ) , s0/e ( -3 ) , s0/sa ( -1 ) and sa / s0 ( 0 ) . when discussing the cluster population in broad terms , ad s types -5 and -4 are combined into e , types -3 , -2 and -1 into s0 , and etc .",
    "df / mf / pvd split the contents of the -4 bin equally into e and s0 , and the 0 bin equally into s0 and sa .",
    "when converting ad s descriptive types into numerical types , we have placed a few galaxies into the merger ( 99 ) bin where an individual catalog object corresponds to an interacting or merging pair of objects .",
    "augustus oemler , another member of the morphs group , independently classified 307 galaxies from the cl1358 + 62 sample ( @xmath0=22 limit ) to check if ad s classifications adhere to the morphs system .",
    "oemler s classifications agree very well with ad s overall , with @xmath410% more s0 s by number , and a corresponding decrease in the numbers of e s .",
    "the number of spirals is identical in both classifications .",
    "like any measurement , classifications will suffer from random and systematic errors .",
    "we can estimate these errors by comparing multiple sets of classifications .",
    "ideally , such a comparison should be based on classifications using independent imaging data . here , both sets of classifiers ( df / mf / pvd and ad ) worked from the same data set , so we may underestimate the errors . nonetheless , this comparison is quite interesting .",
    "figure 1 shows the difference between df / mf / pvd and ad morphological types for individual galaxies as a function of magnitude .",
    "as expected , the differences increase at fainter magnitudes .",
    "to avoid creating artifical gaps in figure 1 , we condensed and shifted the numerical types of the early type galaxies for this presentation : -3 for e s , -2 for e / s0 s and s0/e s , -1 for s0 s , 0 for s0/sa and sa / s0 . for types",
    "sa and later , the `` normal '' types were used .",
    "galaxies which were classified as merger , peculiar , or unclassified by one group were ignored .",
    "figure 2 is a scatter diagram comparing the two sets of classifications .",
    "the scatter is dominated by random differences , but there is some evidence for systematic differences for the early type galaxies .",
    "we return to this point below .",
    "the scatter between the classifications has been measured by calculating the mean absolute deviation , and normalizing it to the mean absolute deviation of a gaussian with an rms of 1 .",
    "this measurement of the scatter is much more robust than the rms of the differences .",
    "the result is shown in figure 3 .",
    "the scatter is @xmath41 for bright galaxies , but increases strongly faintwards of @xmath43 .",
    "the appendix describes how classification errors might systematically bias our population estimates ; unfortunately we can not simply calculate correction factors . in what follows ,",
    "we restrict most of our analysis to the subset of galaxies with @xmath2 .",
    "figure 2 shows a systematic difference in the df / mf / pvd and ad classifications of early type galaxies .",
    "this is not surprising as the division between e and so is a difficult problem in visual classifications .",
    "we might hope that looking at two objectively determined structural parameters for the galaxies , ellipticity and the bulge / total light ratio , might be helpful in resolving this issue .",
    "for example , @xcite compare the ellipticity distributions of the morphs e and s0 intermediate-@xmath7 galaxies with those from an @xcite study of coma cluster galaxies as a consistency check of the morphs classifications .",
    "we have therefore examined the structural properties of the cl1358 + 62 galaxies measured by the medium deep survey ( mds ) group , @xcite .",
    "the mds group has published structural properties for 70% of the cl1358",
    "+ 62 galaxies in our morphological catalog .",
    "the missing 30% are located near frame edges or in one mosaic frame that is not yet included in the mds database .",
    "the mds group has chosen the best fitting of four structural models for the objects in their catalogs : star , disk , bulge , or disk + bulge , accounting for the point spread function of hst .",
    "if a galaxy model is chosen , the mds group fit the ellipticity of the disk , bulge or disk and bulge separately as appropriate .",
    "we focus on two structural parameters derived from these fits : the ratio of bulge to total light , and the weighted ellipticity .",
    "the ratio of bulge to total light follows trivially from the best fit model , or from the fits to the disk + bulge model .",
    "we calculate the weighted ellipticity from the mds disk and bulge ellipticities , weighting by the fractions of light in the disk and bulge .    in figures 4 and 5 we plot the distributions of the bulge to total light ratio for the e and s0 galaxies with @xmath2 in the df / mf / pvd and ad samples , respectively . excepting the differences in numbers , the distributions for both e s and s0 s look remarkably similar for the two sets of classifications .",
    "in figures 6 and 7 we plot the distribution of weighted ellipticities for the same e and s0 galaxies ( @xmath2 ) , again showing the df / mf / pvd and ad samples independently .",
    "caution must be exercised when comparing to these to other measures of ellipticity since the mds numbers are corrected for the hst psf . a larger fraction of the ad e s have ellipticities exceeding 0.2 , but the mean ad e ellipticity is 0.22 , only slightly larger than the df / mf / pvd mean of 0.17 .",
    "the ellipticities of the two samples of s0 s are similar : ad finds a mean ellipticity of 0.46 and df / mf / pvd find a mean ellipticity of 0.40 .",
    "the sizable difference in the numbers of e and s0 galaxies found by the two sets of classifiers is not reflected in a large difference between the structural parameters for the two samples of e s or s0 s .",
    "we conclude that although the total number of early - type galaxies is well established , the so to e ratio in cl1358 + 62 is uncertain .",
    "we have learned that the differences between the two sets of classifications rise steeply below @xmath43 , suggesting this as a practical limit for our morphological study .",
    "this is also conveniently close to the effective limit of our spectroscopic completeness .",

    "furthermore , the density difference between cl1358 + 62 and the average low-@xmath7 reference cluster , 0.3 dex , is comparable to the bin size in the morphology - density relation plots in @xcite .",

    "we can therefore draw a robust conclusion from the two sets of morphological classifications : cl1358 + 62 does not contain an elevated population of spiral galaxies compared with low @xmath7 reference clusters .",
    "this contrasts with the results of @xcite and and @xcite for other intermediate @xmath7 clusters .",
    "our work suggests that the early type / spiral classifications are likely to be secure , implying that the populations of intermediate @xmath7 clusters vary significantly , even after accounting for the effects of the low @xmath7 morphology - density relation .",

    "figure 1 provides some reason to be cautious about this issue . because we do not understand in detail the reasons for the differences between the two sets of visual classifications",
    ", we can not be positive that the two sets of classifications bound our uncertainties .",
    "however , the best we can do at present is to leave the issue of e / s0 classifications open , and to explore the consequences of both sets of classifications below .",
    "the df / mf / pvd classifications would imply that cluster evolution from @xmath54 to the present does not affect the cluster morphological composition or its morphology - density relation within the observed 1.4 mpc radius aperture .",
    "figure 9 shows this relation for cl1358 + 68 , binning the background subtracted data to i=22 ( @xmath1=-18.5 ) radially about the dominant central galaxy .",
    "since we are looking only for radial trends , using the deeper sample is appropriate here .",
    "the average galaxy density in each of four radial bins ( 01 , 12 , 23 , and 35 arcmin ) is the abscissa for this histogram .",
    "the galaxy densities in figure 9 have been normalized to a @xmath1=-20 limit to allow comparison with the low-@xmath7 reference sample .",
    "we find that the morphology - density relation for cl1358 + 62 is indistinguishable within the errors from the low-@xmath7 relation ( to @xmath4@xmath1=-20 ) shown in figure 3 of @xcite .",
    "the ad classifications suggest an evolutionary mechanism that decreases the fraction of e s , increases the fraction of s0 s , while leaving the fraction of spirals unchanged . assuming that there is no plausible mechanism for directly converting e s into s0 s , we can exclude models that transform the observed @xmath7=0.33 cluster spirals into s0 s without accretion of additional galaxies . in order to transform the @xmath7=0.33 ad morphological mix into the low-@xmath7 reference sample population while accreting the smallest number of galaxies , the cluster population would increase by 50% .",
    "approximately 70% of the accreted galaxies would become s0 s by the present day , and 30% spirals .",
    "while a great deal has been learned about the galaxy population in intermediate redshift clusters from relatively small samples of spectra , we must remember that even present - day clusters of galaxies are a heterogeneous group , differing widely in their degree of virialization . because cluster relaxation may drive galaxy evolution ,",
    "the range in cluster galaxy populations may be large at any redshift .",
    "for this reason , it is desirable to connect the morphological and spectral properties of a large sample of galaxies in each of a number of clusters directly .",
    "we have spectral classifications from @xcite sorting each of the galaxies with spectra into one of the four categories : ( 1 ) absorption lines only , ( 2 ) emission lines present , ( 3 ) emission lines plus strong balmer absorption lines , and ( 4 ) k+a ( also called e+a ) .",
    "category ( 4 ) contains galaxies with the normal absorption lines of e / s0 galaxies plus strong balmer absorption lines .",
    "emission line galaxies have [ oii ] 3727  emission with equivalent width ( ew ) @xmath555  .",
    "if h@xmath56 absorption of @xmath554  ew is detected for an emission line galaxy , the galaxy is classified as emission plus balmer lines .",
    "galaxies with [ ( h@xmath56 + h@xmath57 + h@xmath58)/3 ] ew greater than 4  , but [ oii ] emission with @xmath85  ew , are classified as k+a .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a more complete summary of the spectral properties of these galaxies and a comparison with spectra of low-@xmath7 galaxies .",
    "table 4 and figure 10 summarize the comparison between the spectral and morphological properties for the 191 cluster members in common with @xcite , using the df / mf / pvd classifications .    in rough terms , the bulk of the cl1358 + 62 galaxies follow the morphological - spectral correlation expected for bright field galaxies at low redshift : the preponderance of the e and s0 galaxies have pure absorption line spectra , while the fraction of galaxies with emission lines rises for the late type spirals .",
    "@xcite found a similar behavior for galaxies in the morphs sample ; see also @xcite .",
    "we do know , however , that the percentage of galaxies with emission lines and strong balmer absorption lines , @xmath419% , is higher than the @xmath46% content of these galaxies in comparable low @xmath7 clusters ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) .",
    "if we use the ad classifications for the cl1358 + 62 galaxies , these conclusions do not change significantly .",
    "the most interesting difference between the two sets of morphological classifications is that df / mf / pvd classify all the e+a galaxies as types s0 to sb , while ad classifies these galaxies as having a wider range of morphologies from e to sbc .",
    "for cl1358 + 62 , we have acquired a unique data set including a large mosaic of hst fields and extensive spectroscopy that allows us to unambiguously determine cluster membership for galaxies with @xmath59 .",
    "we have directly compared the morphological classifications of two sets of classifiers for the galaxies in cl1358 + 62 .",
    "the two sets of classifiers agree that ( to a limit of @xmath1=-20 ) the fraction of early type galaxies ( and therefore spirals ) in this cluster at @xmath7=0.33 is indistinguishable from the fraction in comparable low-@xmath7 clusters .",
    "in contrast , previous workers , @xcite and @xcite , who also studied wfpc2 images of clusters at z@xmath40.3 , found an elevated population of spirals compared with low-@xmath7 reference samples . because our work confirms the reliability of early - type / spiral classifications from intermediate @xmath7 wfpc2 observations ,",
    "we conclude that this is evidence for a dispersion in the evolution of intermediate-@xmath7 clusters .",
    "the two groups of classifiers differ on ratio of e to s0 galaxies in cl1358 + 62 .",
    "df / mf / pvd find a population of s0 galaxies ( s0/e=1.6@xmath150.3 ) that is within 1.4@xmath53 of the low-@xmath7 reference sample , while ad finds a significantly smaller ratio ( 1.1@xmath150.2 ) .",
    "this systematic difference is most likely related to the fact that the transition between s0 s and intermediate luminosity e s is rather gradual .",
    "many of the intermediate luminosity e s are thought to have disks , e.g.  @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "it may only be possible to resolve this issue by direct model fitting to images at low and intermediate @xmath7 .",
    "even though we conclude that we have not reliably determined the ratio of s0 s to e s among the early types , our work significantly restricts possible evolutionary models .",
    "if we accept the mf / df / pvd classifications , evolution must preserve the fraction of e s , s0 s and s s as well as the morphology - density relation . if the ad classifications are correct , evolution must decrease the fraction of e s and increase the fraction of s0 s while maintaining the fraction of s s . a possible mechanism for driving the evolution of the morphological mix in this latter fashion is accretion of additional galaxies from the spiral - rich infall region that become predominantly s0 s .",
    "the cluster population within an @xmath41 mpc radius must increase by a minimum of 50% from @xmath7=0.5 to the present day in order convert an intermediate @xmath7 population rich in e s to a low-@xmath7 population rich in s0 s",
    ". it will be interesting to see whether such accretion can be produced in simulations of cluster formation .",
    "in most cluster formation scenarios , massive clusters form by the merging of pre - existing massive clusters with ( presumably ) similar populations of early type galaxies . it may therefore be difficult to double the ratio of s0 to e galaxies .",
    "we compare our morphological classifications to our previous spectral classifications and conclude that the morphologies of the spectrally `` active '' galaxies are as might be expected from the low-@xmath7 field population : the galaxies with emission lines are predominently spirals and the k+a ( or e+a ) post - starburst galaxies are typically early type disk galaxies ( s0sb ) .",
    "we wish to acknowledge the generous contributions of alan dressler to this paper , including his independent classifications and insightful comments .",
    "we thank gus oemler for checking the classifications and for thoughtful comments on the manuscript , which led to several improvements .",
    "we thank margaret geller for a critical reading of an earlier version of the manuscript and helpful comments .",
    "our referee , ian smail , and our editor , greg bothun , both made insightful comments that helped us clarify the paper .",
    "the effects of classification errors on the distribution of types can be important .",
    "quantifying these effects is difficult because morphological classification is a subjective procedure , but we can gain some insight by considering simple models for the errors .",
    "we begin by assuming that the numerical type is based on a one dimensional measurement with a simple , constant error .",
    "this simple model would imply that any peaks in the distribution of types would be softened .",
    "if we adopt nominal intrinsic fractions of s : s0:e of 0.20:0.53:0.27 , as is approximately correct for the inner 600 kpc of low redshift clusters ( @xcite ) , the errors will automatically decrease the fraction of s0 s , and enhance the fraction of e s and s s .",
    "we can calculate an upper limit to the loss of s0 s for our nominal 20:53:27 ( s : s0:e ) population with this model for the errors .",
    "we assume that the types are scattered with a mean absolute deviation ( mad ) of 1 , and all intermediate types are divided equally between adjacent types .",
    "the outcome of this experiment is a distribution of 0.27:0.38:0.34 ( s : s0:e ) . in this case , all galaxies scattered beyond the normal type boundaries were assigned to the boundary type ( i.e.  e ) .",
    "a mad of 1 may be an overestimate as the difference in the types assigned by the two groups of classifiers is of this order .",
    "the intrinsic errors are @xmath60 smaller if the errors are independent . for these smaller errors",
    "the resulting distribution would be 0.24:0.43:0.33 ( s : s0:e ) . in either case",
    ", the results serve to illustrate that the systematic effects can be very significant .",
    "let us consider a second , more physical model for the visual classification errors . here",
    ", we assume that morphological type is based on two independent variables with continuous distributions : bulge - to - total light fraction ( @xmath61 ) , and asymmetric features due to spiral arms ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "this is very similar to the quantitative classification devised by @xcite .",
    "galaxies with low @xmath62 will be classified as early type ( @xmath63 ) and then divided into e s or s0 s based on whether @xmath61 is above or below a critical value .",
    "it has been argued that most @xmath64 ellipticals have faint disks , e.g.  @xcite and @xcite .",
    "similarly , the spiral classification will be based on a combination of @xmath61 and @xmath62 .    if the intrinsic distribution of @xmath61 is flat , then errors in @xmath61 will not change the ratio of s0 s to e s . however ,",
    "if the intrinsic distribution of @xmath61 is peaked , the errors will have a systematic effect .",
    "the sign depends on the details of the intrinsic @xmath61 distributions and the size of the errors .",
    "contributing to this uncertainty , the errors can also be asymmetric , if for example , faint extended disks are missed in noisy data .",
    "the situation is similar for errors in @xmath62 , where e s and sa s now share a boundary .",
    "extensive simulations are required to estimate the systematic effects of limited s / n on classification errors , taking into account the the point spread function of wfpc .",
    "we will undertake this effort in a future paper .",

    "<S> we describe the morphological composition of a sample of 518 galaxies in the field of cl1358 + 62 at z=0.33 , drawn from a large _ hst _ mosaic covering 53 sq .  </S>",
    "<S> arcmin . </S>",
    "<S> the sample is complete to @xmath0=22 , corresponding to @xmath1=-18.5 in the rest frame . </S>",
    "<S> the galaxy morphologies have been independently classified by the authors of this paper and by alan dressler . </S>",
    "<S> dressler s classifications place our work in context with the previous morphs study , and allow us to estimate the scatter between different sets of visual classifications .    </S>",
    "<S> we restrict most of our analysis to the brighter part of the sample , @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) , where the scatter between the two sets of classifications is @xmath41 in morphological type . </S>",
    "<S> the scatter doubles at @xmath5 , presumably due to the lower signal - to - noise and poorer sampling of faint , small galaxy images . to @xmath0=21 the two sets of classifiers agree on the fraction of early type galaxies ( elliptical+s0 ) : 72% . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that cl1358 + 62 does not contain the large population of spiral galaxies found in other studies of clusters at @xmath6 , and that there is probably a significant spread in the degree of cluster evolution at intermediate redshift .    </S>",
    "<S> the two groups of classifiers differ on the relative fraction of s0 and elliptical galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the distributions of ellipticities and bulge / total light can not resolve this discrepancy . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , we can derive significant constraints on physical models for the evolution of the galaxy population in cl1358 + 62 . </S>",
    "<S> the higher ratio of s0 to elliptical galaxies ( 1.6 ) found by df / mf / pvd requires that the evolution preserve the relative fraction of elliptical , s0 and spiral galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> alternately , the lower ratio ( 1.1 ) found by ad requires that the evolution preserve the early - type to spiral ratio while increasing the s0 to elliptical ratio . in the latter case , a possible evolutionary mechanism is accretion of galaxies that predominantly evolve to s0 s between @xmath7=0.33 and the present .    </S>",
    "<S> we use our large body of spectra to make the correspondence between spectral and morphological type . </S>",
    "<S> our data follow the pattern seen in the field at low redshift : emission line spectra are more prevalent among the later morphological types . </S>",
    "<S> the 11 identified k+a galaxies ( absorption line spectra with strong balmer lines ) have s0sb morphologies .    _ </S>",
