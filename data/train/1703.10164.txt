    "thanks to the combined effort of continuous @xmath1ray all - sky observation and radio pulsation searches , the population of millisecond pulsars ( msps ) are expanded significantly in the recent years ( see the review by hui 2014 ) . among these newly discovered msps , one interesting new class which",
    "is usually referred as  redbacks \" has emerged .",
    "they are characterized by their non - degenerate companions with the mass ranges from @xmath2 to @xmath3 and with the orbital period @xmath4  hrs ( see roberts 2013 for a review ) .",

    "theoretical models ( shvartsman 1970 ; burderi et al .",
    "2001 ) have also suggested that these systems can swing between the rotation - powered and accretion - power states according to the mass transfer rate .",
    "such behavior has also been firstly seen in psrj1023 + 0038 with the disappearance of radio pulsations ( stappers et al .",

    "2014 ) .",
    "in this investigation , we focus on another redback msp psrj17232837 . its spin period and spin - down rate are @xmath5  ms and @xmath6  s s@xmath7 respectively ( crawford et al . 2013 ) .",
    "this implies a spin - down power of @xmath8  erg s@xmath7 .",
    "its distance inferred from the dispersion measure is @xmath9  pc , which makes it the closest redback that has been found in the galactic field so far .",

    "nustar _ , we combined the background subtracted light curves from fpma and fpmb ( figure 1 ) .",

    "2013 ) , we folded the barycentered events at the orbital period ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the phase zero is defined as the time of the ascending node ( mjd 55425.320466 ) , meaning that the inferior conjunction ( when the companion star is between the pulsar and observer ) is at phase 0.25 .",
    "the orbital period is clearly shown in all energy ranges concerned .",
    "the profiles of the light curves are similar to that of _ chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _  ( hui et al .",

    "we also computed the ratios between different energy bands and there is no evidence of color variation throughout the orbital period ( see figure 2 for the flux ratio between 2079 kev and 310 kev ) and we will show in section 3.2 that the phase - resolved spectral fits of the minimum and maximum are statistically the same .",
    "furthermore , the x - ray light curves show a dipping feature on a timescale of about 3 hours in one occasion ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "this feature happened in between the maximum and minimum of the light curve at the orbital phase of @xmath26 . to test the significance",

    "the small numbers of photons do not allow us to claim a detection .",
    "the hardness ratio did not reveal any variability .",
    "we performed spectral analysis using xspec version 12.9.1 .",
    "we first fit the phase - averaged spectrum with a simple absorbed power - law model .",
    "this is based on the fact that there is no indication of any thermal emission from the 0.310 kev spectra ( hui et al .",
    "2014 ) . to constrain the soft x - rays below 3 kev ( where _ nustar _",
    "is not sensitive ) , we performed a joint fit together with the simultaneous _ swift_/xrt data .",
    "we also included constants to take cross - calibration between _ nustar _  fpma and fpmb and _ swift_/xrt into account .",
    "figure 3 shows the broadband energy spectrum of psrj17232837 .",
    "the spectrum clearly extends up to about 70 kev with no significant emission and absorption features and can be well described by an absorbed power - law model ( @xmath28 for 289 degrees of freedom ( dof ) ) .",
    "the best - fit model parameters are @xmath29 @xmath30 and @xmath31",
    ". all quoted uncertainties in this paper are 90% confidence level .",
    "the best - fit @xmath32 is entirely consistent with the galactic value ( @xmath33 @xmath30 ; kalberla et al .",
    "the unabsorbed 379 kev flux is @xmath34 ergs @xmath30 s@xmath7 , corresponding to an x - ray luminosity of @xmath35 ergs s@xmath7 ( @xmath36 kpc ) .",
    "we also fit the spectrum with a power - law model with a high - energy exponential cutoff .",
    "however , the fit was not improved significantly and the cutoff energy is unreasonably large ( @xmath37 kev ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that a simple power - law model is sufficient to describe the spectrum .",
    "we next investigated two phase - resolved spectra covering the orbital phase of 0.20.4 and 0.70.9 .",
    "these two phase ranges roughly corresponds to the x - ray minimum ( inferior conjunction ) and maximum ( superior conjunction ) , respectively .",
    "for the phase - resolved spectroscopy , we used the _ nustar _",
    "data only since the _ swift _",
    "observations do not have sufficient photons .",
    "we fixed the @xmath32 at the best - fit value determined from the phase - averaged spectrum .",
    "the best - fit @xmath38 is @xmath39 and @xmath40 for inferior and superior conjunction , respectively .",
    "varying the @xmath32 within the 90% uncertainty gives consistent results .",
    "this shows that both spectra are statistically the same and are consistent with the phase - averaged spectrum .",
    "we conclude that there is no significant x - ray spectral variability throughout the binary orbit of psrj17232837 .",
    "the _ nustar _",
    "results are in general consistent with _ chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _  observations but for the superior conjunction , the spectrum of _ nustar",
    "_  is steeper than that of _ chandra_/_xmm - newton_.",
    "we have investigated hard x - ray ( 379 kev ) properties of the msp binary psrj17232837  with _ nustar_. the 14.8-hr binary orbital period of the system is clearly shown in hard x - ray ( figure 1 and 2 ) and the profile is similar to that seen in _",

    "the broadband ( 0.379 kev ) energy spectrum from the joint _ swift _  and _ nustar _",

    "the _ nustar _",
    "results strongly support the non - thermal nature of the x - ray emission as already indicated in previous studies with _ chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _  ( hui et al .",
    "2014 ) . to produce such a hard x - ray spectrum ,",
    "it is suggested that the x - rays are from an intrabinary shock due to interaction between pulsar wind and outflow from the companion star ( takata et al .",

    "this model also explains the x - ray orbital modulation naturally .",

    "nustar _ , we here explain the x - ray emission of psrj17232837  with a revised intrabinary shock model .",
    "the orbit modulating x - rays of psrj17232837  are likely produced by the intrabinary shock like other redback msp binary such as psrj1023 + 0038 ( takata et al .",

    "the observed radio eclipse at several ghz lasts only 15% of its binary orbit , suggesting the shock wraps the companion star and its distance from the pulsar is of order of the orbit separation , which is of order of @xmath47 cm ( crawford et al . 2013 ) .",
    "the magnetic fields at the shock may be estimated as @xmath48 g , where we used @xmath49 , @xmath50 cm and @xmath51 as the the ratio of the magnetic energy to the kinetic energy of the relativistic pulsar wind ( takata et al .",
    "2017 ) . at the shock",
    ", the kinetic energy of the pulsar wind is converted into the internal energy , and the pulsar wind particles are accelerated beyond the lorentz factor of the cold relativistic pulsar wind in the upstream region .",
    "we may estimate the maximum lorentz factor of the accelerated particle by balancing the accelerating time scale , @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the efficiency of shock acceleration , and synchrotron cooling time scale , @xmath54 , which yields @xmath55 .",
    "these tev electrons accelerated at the shock will produce the very high - energy photons by scattering off the soft photons from the companion star ( @xmath56k ) , which could possibly be measured by the cherenkov telescope array ( cta ) in the future .    for the synchrotron radiation ,",

    "_ chandra _ , _ xmm - newton _ , and _ nustar _",
    "observations revealed that the x - ray emissions in 0.379 kev energy range is well described by a simple power - law with a photon index of @xmath65 , which is similar to the transitional msp psrj1023 + 0038 .",
    "this simple power law spectrum may indicate that the typical synchrotron energy @xmath66 of the minimum lorentz factor @xmath63 is smaller than 0.1 kev , and the power law index of the particle distribution at the shock is @xmath67 . in such a case ,",
    "the minimum lorentz factor is constrained as @xmath68 .",
    "apart from the x - ray orbital modulation , the x - ray light curve also shows a short - term dipping feature on a timescale of about 3 hours in between the inferior and superior conjunctions .",
    "given the orbital phase ( @xmath26 ) of the dip , it is unlikely due to an eclipse .",
    "the lack of a hardness change during the dip indicates that it may be intrinsic to the x - ray radiation ( i.e. , intrabinary shocked x - rays ) caused by perturbation of shock front via clumpy pulsar wind or outflow variation from the companion .",
    "for instance , if the outflow velocity from the companion has a sudden drop , the momentum ratio of the stellar wind and the pulsar wind will drop accordingly , resulting a smaller fraction of the pulsar wind stopped by the outflow .    in summary , we found modulating x - ray radiation at the 14.8-hr binary orbit of psrj17232837  up to 79 kev with _",
    "nustar_. the energy spectrum is a simple power - law with a photon index of @xmath0 and shows no evidence of spectral variability throughout the orbital cycle .",
