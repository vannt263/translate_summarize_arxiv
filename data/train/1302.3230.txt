    "the hierarchical theory of galaxy formation predicts that smaller galactic structures merge and dissolve to form the galaxies that we see today . since 2004",
    ", seventeen new dwarf companions have been discovered around the milky way ( mw ) from the analysis of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "a similar number of new satellites have been discovered also around m31 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the new systems generally have luminosities fainter ( l@xmath15 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) than the classical dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies and have thus be named ultra - faint dwarfs ( ufds ) .",
    "they are usually dark matter dominated and spectroscopic analyses have revealed that they contain extremely metal - poor stars with metallicities as low as @xmath16 } = -4.0 $ ] dex @xcite . in a number of cases",
    "they also show an irregular shape probably due to the tidal interactions with the mw .",
    "the ufd galaxies being discovered in large numbers around the milky way ( mw ) and m31 galaxies are perhaps the best candidates for the lone survivors of the cannibalistic construction of the two giants spirals of the local group ( however , see @xcite , for challenges to the cosmological accretion scenario of galaxy formation ) .",
    "the majority of the ufds studied so far for variability have been found to contain pulsating variable stars of rr lyrae type with pulsation characteristics ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) conforming to the properties of the variables in the mw globular clusters ( gcs ) . in the mw the gcs that contain rr lyrae stars divide into two different groups according to the mean period of the fundamental - mode ( rrab ) rr lyrae stars @xcite , and the number ratios of fundamental to first - overtone ( rrc ) pulsators ( @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the numbers of first - overtone and fundamental - mode rr lyrae stars , respectively ) : oosterhoff type i ( ooi ) clusters have @xmath20 @xmath21 0.55 days and @xmath22 0.17 , while oosterhoff type ii ( ooii ) gcs have @xmath20 @xmath21 0.65 days and @xmath22 0.44 @xcite .",
    "differences in the mean periods of the rrc stars are also found between the two groups , with the ooi gcs having rrc mean periods of @xmath3 0.32 days and the ooii gcs having mean periods of @xmath3 0.37 days ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the oosterhoff dichotomy is related to the metal content as ooii gcs are generally more metal - poor than the ooi gcs , but also the horizontal branch ( hb ) morphology plays an important role @xcite .",
    "the oosterhoff dichotomy is also present among the mw field rr lyrae stars as first shown by @xcite and later confirmed by other studies ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the study of the oosterhoff properties of the dwarf satellite companions of the mw plays an important role in identifying which satellites may have been the building blocks of the galactic halo .",
    "indeed , the oosterhoff dichotomy and the existence of an oosterhoff gap has been observed so far only in the mw , as field and cluster rr lyrae stars in the @xmath23bright@xmath24 classical dsphs surrounding the mw have 0.58@xmath250.62 days and fall preferentially into the so - called oosterhoff gap @xcite avoided by the mw gcs thus , the mw halo can not have been assembled by accretion of dwarf galaxies resembling the present - day bright mw dsph satellites . on the contrary , the vast majority of the ufds are found to contain rr lyrae stars with ooii characteristics ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , thus supporting the hypothesis that systems resembling the present - day ufds might indeed have contributed to the building of the mw halo .",

    "the galaxy has an half - light radius of r@xmath30 @xcite , that at the distance of 96.8@xmath31 4",
    "kpc @xcite corresponds to r@xmath32 pc .",

    "based on a @xmath34 color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) reaching @xmath35 mag , @xcite conclude that uma  i contains an old stellar population comparable in age to the galactic gcs m92 and m15 .",
    "this was recently confirmed by @xcite whose much deeper cmd ( @xmath36 @xmath37 mag ) obtained with the acs on board the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ shows the presence in uma  i of a single stellar population with an age of @xmath3 13.6 gyr .",
    "measuring the velocity dispersion of the brightest stars in uma  i , @xcite and @xcite found that the galaxy is one of the most dark matter dominated objects in the universe , with a mass - to - light ratio m / l @xmath38 m@xmath39/l@xmath39 .",
    "@xcite confirmed the systemic velocity derived in these previous studies using a larger sample of stars , but derived a lower dispersion .",
    "nevertheless , assuming the lower luminosity of uma  i ( m@xmath40 mag ) measured by @xcite , @xcite estimated an m / l similar to that of @xcite and @xcite . in the same work @xcite also derived a metal abundance of [ fe / h]=@xmath41 dex from spectra of the galaxy red giants , later revised to [ fe / h]=@xmath42 dex by @xcite , and to [ fe / h]=@xmath43 dex by @xcite .",
