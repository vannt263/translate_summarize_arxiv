    "in modern cosmology , one of the most striking discoveries is that our expanding universe is undergoing a phase of acceleration .",
    "the key observational results that support this discovery are : the luminosity - redshift relationship from snia surveys @xcite , the cmb anisotropy spectrum @xcite , the large scale structure from galaxy redshift surveys @xcite and bao @xcite . with the combination of all these observational results ,",
    "one gets the standard @xmath6cdm cosmology as : @xmath13 . amongst the matter",
    "content baryonic matter amounts to only @xmath14 , other @xmath15 is the so - called dark matter ( dm ) , and the rest component of @xmath16 dominate the universe that is often referred to as dark energy ( de ) , which is a negative - pressure ideal fluid smoothly permeated the universe .",
    "it is worth noting that , notwithstanding the standard cosmology is very well in agreement with the astrophysical data , the nature of the dark matter and dark energy remains mystery in the modern cosmology and physics , so that there are so many theoretical proposals to account for them on the ground .",
    "possible models to explain the acceleration include a classical cosmology constant @xcite , chaplygin gas @xcite , a wide variety of scalar - field models such as quintessence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , k - essence @xcite , phantom field @xcite and so on .",
    "except above models , there are several popular alternative ideas for the accelerating universe by modifying general relativity rather than resorting to some kinds of exotic fluid .",
    "it is a natural consequence to modify the theory of gravity , after the current observations mightily suggesting the failure of general relativity ( gr ) as a large cosmological scale gravity theory .",
    "actually , on the right side of einstein s field equation , the energy momentum tensor is related to the matter content , and on the left side , the einstein tensor consists of pure geometrical terms , which can be modified to account for dm and de phenomena @xcite .",
    "accordingly , both of accelerating behaviour ( de ) and dynamical phenomena ( dm ) can be interpreted as curvature effects .",
    "recently , a lot of people attempt to modify the general relativity in different ways and propose various modified gravity theories to address the dm or de phenomenon or both . amongst them , @xmath0 gravity theories , where @xmath17 is curvature scalar , have attracted much attention , which are put forward to account for de by adopting an arbitrary function of r in einstein - hilbert lagrangian , the so - called @xmath0 term , instead of @xmath17 in traditional general relativity .",
    "obviously , an important reason for this interest is that @xmath0 term in types of negative as well as positive powers of r can produce the inflation at early times and now observed acceleration phase at late times , following the well - known sequence of universal evolution @xcite .",
    "usually , two possibilities referring to as the metric approach and the palatini approach can derive the einstein field equation from the hilbert action . by comparison",
    ", the metric approach assumes that the equation has only one variable with respect to metric where the affine connection is the function of metric , while in the palatini approach the metric and the connection are treated to be independent of each other as two variables .",
    "when @xmath0 is in form of linear function , both approaches lead to the same results .",
    "once adding any non - linear term to the hilbert action , however , the two methods would produce enormous differences .",
    "the reasons for the palatini approach seeming appealing compared with another one are that , on one hand , the metric approach leads to the fourth order field equations , which is difficult to solve analytically , whereas the palatini approach results in the two order field equations . on the other hand , although @xmath0 theories via metric approach can give some interesting and successful results , some of them suffer from certain fatal defects .",
    "for example , they can not pass the solar system test , have instabilities , have incorrect newtonian limit and can not totally describe all epoches of the universe .    here",
    "we adopt the @xmath0 gravity theory within the palatini approach which can avoid the above mentioned problems . in this framework ,",
    "the form @xmath18 is chosen so that it can pass the solar system test and has the correct newtonian limit @xcite , and can explain the late accelerating phase in the universe @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is important to go beyond the quantitative studying and test these theories using the observations .",
    "recently constraint from data on above type of @xmath0 theory is intensively discussed by many authors . among them , in these papers @xcite , the cmb shift parameter , supernovae ia surveys data and baryon acoutic oscillations were combined to constrain the parameters and , in particular , they give @xmath19 . in a previous work , @xcite used the matter power spectrum from the sdss to get further restriction @xmath20 , which reduced allowed parameter space to a tiny around the @xmath6cdm cosmology .",
    "recently , @xcite jointed the wmap , supernovae legacy survey ( snls ) data and sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data to tighten the parameter up to @xmath21 , which made this model hard to distinguish from the standard one , where the parameter @xmath4 is zero .",
    "so far , there has been no attempt to use the strong lensing observation to test the @xmath0 gravity theories in the palatini formalism .",
    "nowadays , with more and more lens surveys available to enlarge the statistical lensing samples , gravitational lensing has developed into a powerful tool to study a host of important subjects on different scales in astrophysics , from stars to galaxies and clusters , further , to the large structure of the universe .",
    "since the gravitational lensing phenomena involve the source information , two dimensional mass distribution of the lens and the geometry of the universe , it is useful to not only infer the distant source properties far below the resolution limit or sensitivity limit of current observations and offer an ideal way to probe the mass distribution of the universe , but also constrain the parameters of cosmological models @xcite .",
    "so far the large lens surveys have built both radio ( the cosmic - lens all sky survey , class ) and optical ( sqls dr3 ) lens samples .",
    "the class forms a well - defined lens sample containing 13 lenses from 8958 radio sources with image separations of @xmath22 and the i - band flux ratio @xmath23 ( bright to faint ) @xcite",
    ". meanwhile , the sqls constructs a statistical sample of 11 lensed quasars from 22683 optical quasars , of which the range of redshift is @xmath24 and the apparent magnitude is brighter than @xmath25 @xcite . as compared with class , the latter sample has larger image separations ( @xmath26 ) and smaller flux ratio limit ( @xmath27 , faint to bright ) .",
    "many authors use the strong gravitational lensing statistics to study de , including the equation of state of de @xcite and the test for the modified gravity theories as alternatives to de @xcite .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to investigate the constraints of strong lensing observation on the parameters of @xmath0 theory in the palatini approach using the sqls statistical sample .",
    "but there has a big question that how the non - linear terms in @xmath0 gravity theories contribute to the light - bending and correct the einstein deflection angle . if this influence is large enough , it is inevitable that all the models built on gr to compute the lensing statistical probability must be changed .",
    "but this question is starting to be solved , here , we still use the same way as that based on gr to calculate the lensing probability because of the following considerations .",
    "firstly , the @xmath0 gravity theories are applied to explain the nature of de , but as far as we know it , de smoothly fills the space to power the acceleration expansion as the same way in everywhere of the universe and make the universe to be flat .",
    "@xcite showed that de does not cluster on scales less than 100mpc .",
    "naturally , as an alternative to de , any modified gravity theory , like @xmath0 non - linear term , should not affect the gravitational potential distribution of dark halos as the virialized systems such as galaxies and clusters , and in particular , should have not detectable contribution to the light - bending if they are some successful models .",
    "moreover , it is worth stressing that how the modifying the lagrangian of the gravitational field affects the standard theory of lensing ( built on gr ) is not well investigated .",
    "recently , theories with @xmath28 were been investigated within the metric approach for a point - like lens and results were given that the @xmath29 modified gravity signatures possibly to be detected through a careful examination of galactic microlensing @xcite .",
    "and @xcite derived the complete set of the linearized field equations of the two newtonian potentials @xmath30 and @xmath31 in the metric formalism , and predicted that , for some @xmath0 gravity models , the gravitational lensing was virtually identical to that based on gr , under the environments of galaxies and clusters . while , under the palatini approach , the paper @xcite is a first step to evaluate some effects of the non linearity of the gravity lagrangian on lensing phenomenology . as expected , for a spherically symmetrical point - like model",
    ", the estimated results suggest that the effects of @xmath0 are confined around a cosmological scale , and hence , they have no effects on smaller scales such as our galaxy . for galaxies ,",
    "the weak - field approximation is valid .",
    "the standard lensing theory ( based on gr ) is on the basis of this assumption . in gr ,",
    "the deflection angle for a point mass can be easily obtained . for the weak - field assumption",
    ", the field equations of gr can be linearized .",
    "therefore , we can first divide the whole galaxy into small elements , and each mass element can be treated as point mass , then the deflection angle of the general galactic mass distribution models can be obtained by the sum ( or integration ) of the deflections due to the individual mass components @xcite . in @xmath0 gravity , if the gravitational field is weak , we are able to perturb the general einstein field equations ( based on @xmath0 gravity theories ) and simplify them to linear equations . in this case , the superimposition principle works , so we can get that the field equations which describe the point - like objects can also be used to describe the ensemble of mass points .",
    "that is to say , both of the mass point and the ensemble of mass points have field equations in the same formalism .",
    "so we can safely extrapolate the conclusion for point - like lenses , that standard lensing theory is a good approximation in the case of @xmath0 gravity theories , to galaxy - scale lenses .",
    "however , there are no works to prove it through mathematical process , and further theoretical studies are needed to test the @xmath0 gravity theories in the palatini formalism . under these situations , we consider that the standard theory of lensing is still correct in the caseof @xmath0 theory we used .",
    "according to astronomical observations , dynamical analysis and numerical simulations , there are three kinds of popular mass density profile of dark halos as a lens model in the standard lensing theory , namely , the singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) , the navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) and the generalized nfw ( gnfw ) profile .",
    "they can reasonably reproduce the results of strong lensing survey @xcite .",
    "as been well known , the lensing probability is very sensitive to the density profile of lenses .",
    "moreover , the lensing is determined almost entirely by the fraction of the halo mass that is contained within a fiducial radius that is @xmath32 of the virial radius .",
    "since in the inner regions the slope of sis density is steeper than that of nfw density , for the multiple image separations of @xmath33 , the lensing probability for nfw halos is lower than the corresponding probability for sis halos by about 3 orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "the cooling mass dividing galaxies and clusters for transition from sis to nfw is @xmath34 .",
    "the sqls dr3 has 11 multi - imaged lens systems , including ten galaxy - scale lenses and one cluster - scale lens with large image separation ( @xmath35 ) @xcite .",
    "it is the first lens sample that contains both galaxy - scale lenses and cluster - scale lens . in lensing statistics ,",
    "if we consider lensing halos with all mass scales , from galaxies to clusters , then the effects of substructures @xcite and baryon infall @xcite can not be neglected , in particular to galaxy groups , for which neither sis nor nfw can be applied . for early - type galaxies , which dominate the galactic strong lensing ,",
    "sis is a good model of lenses , in particular , it results from the original nfw - like halos through the baryon infall effects @xcite .",
    "moreover , the non - spherical lens profiles do not significantly affect the lensing cross section @xcite .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we use the sis model to compute the strong lensing probability for galaxies . to avoid the complexity from large mass scales mentioned above",
    ", we consider only galaxy - scale lenses in the sample , and thus compute the differential lensing probability rather than the usual integrated lensing probability to match the sqls dr3 sample ( containing 10 galaxy - scale lenses ) . a more realistic lensing model including sis and nfw to fit the complete sqls sample and comparing to the results of this paper is our future work .",
    "as comparison , @xcite adds two additional cuts to select a 7 lensed quasar sub - sample from the dr3 statistical lens sample for constraining the parameter @xmath36 of state of dark energy .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we outline the @xmath0 theories in the palatini approach , including the cosmological dynamical equation and parameters with the frw universe setting . in section 3",
    "we present the differential lensing probability based on the @xmath0 gravity theories with sis model . in section 4",
    ", we discuss the specific analytic function @xmath2 used in this paper , give the corresponding cosmological evolution behaviour and investigate the observational constraint on our @xmath0 theory arising from sqls dr3 statistical lens sample .",
    "finally , we give discussion and conclusions in section 5 .",
    "the starting point of the @xmath0 theories in the palatini approach is einstein - hilbert action , whose formalism is : @xmath37 where @xmath38 , light velocity @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the matter action which is a functional of metric @xmath41 and the matter fields @xmath42 . as mentioned previously , the metric and the affine connection are two independent quantities in the palatini approach , so the ricci scalar is defined by two variables , the metric and the connection ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) : @xmath43 in which @xmath44 where r is negative . from eq.([action ] ) , we derive the generalized einstein equations . varying with respect to metric @xmath45",
    ", we get one equation : @xmath46 where @xmath47 and the energy momentum tensor @xmath48 is given as @xmath49 taking the trace of eq.([equation ] ) gives the so - called structural equation and it controls the solutions of eq.([equation ] ) .",
    "@xmath50 varying with respect to the connection @xmath51 gives another equation @xmath52=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath53 denotes the covariant derivative with respect to the affine connection . from this equation",
    "it is found that the new metric @xmath54 , which can describe the affine connection as the levi - civita connections , is conformal to @xmath41 , @xmath55 finally combined above equations , we could easily get the relation between @xmath56 and @xmath57 which is the ricci tensor associated with the metric @xmath41 . @xmath58 note that the covariant derivative @xmath53 we refer to is associated with the levi - civita connection of metric @xmath41 .      in this subsection",
    ", we shall make a detailed study of the cosmological viability of the model based on @xmath0 theories in palatini formalism .",
    "it is well - known that wmap s data is a strong evidence to support a flat universe , so we choose a spatially flat frw ( friedmann - robertson - walker ) metric to describe our background universe .",
    "the metric takes the standard form : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the scale factor . as usual , we assume a perfect fluid energy - momentum tensor @xmath61 . by contracting eq.([ricci ] ) we get the generalized friedmann equation : @xmath62 in this paper we consider a matter dominated universe , so the constant equation of state is @xmath63 and the relation between the matter density and scalar factor is @xmath64 . using eq.([structure ] )",
    ", we can obtain : @xmath65 where we have chosen @xmath66 . on the other hand , from eq.([structure ] ) and the conservation of energy @xmath67 , we have as : @xmath68 using eqs.([structure ] ) , ( [ friedmann ] ) and ( [ dotr ] ) we get the friedmann equation @xmath69 in the form of r , @xmath70 combing eqs.([ar ] ) and ( [ h2r ] ) we can know the whole expansion history that is determined by @xmath71 , for any specific expression of @xmath0 .",
    "let us now consider the cosmological distance based on the given model . from the explicit expression for the hubble parameter @xmath69 and the relation between z and @xmath72 :",
    "@xmath73 , it is convenient to rewrite the proper distance , luminosity distance , angular diameter distance and the deceleration parameter in terms of r. the proper distance and luminosity distance to the object at redshift @xmath74 are @xmath75 @xmath76 the angular diameter distance from an object at red - shift @xmath77 to an object at red - shift @xmath78 is @xmath79 the deceleration parameter is @xmath80 when @xmath81 the universe is in early - time matter - dominated phase and @xmath82 the universe is in dark energy dominated late - time acceleration phase .",
    "as mentioned , in this paper , we assume that the @xmath0 theories have no effect on the gravitational lensing and still model the early - type galactic lens as sis as in gr , but these formulae are used in terms of r. the density profile is @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the velocity dispersion and @xmath85 is the distance from the galaxy center . from the geometrical relations between the image position @xmath86 , source position @xmath4 and lens , one gets the lensing equation : @xmath87 for a sis lens , the deflection angle is @xmath88 , which is independent of the impact parameter .",
    "the angular einstein radius is defined as @xmath89 the sources are multiply imaged when @xmath90 and a ring - like image occurs when @xmath5 .",
    "when the multiple images occur , from the lensing equation , there are two images on opposite sides of the lens at angular positions @xmath91 the corresponding magnifications are @xmath92 the total magnification of the two images is @xmath93 the magnification of an image is defined by the ratio between the solid angles of the image and the source , namely , the flux density ratio between the image and the source",
    ". then the flux density ratio q for bright - to - faint is the ratio of the corresponding absolute values of the magnifications @xmath94 every lens survey has its own spectrum range and selection functions , so there exists an explicit cut flux density ratio , less than which , the survey couldnot identify the lenses .",
    "for example , for sqls , the ratio ( faint to bright ) is larger than @xmath27 , which means that only sources with @xmath95 can be detected , where @xmath96 corresponds to @xmath97 .",

    "the cross section @xmath109 is dependent on the flux density ratio of multiple images ( @xmath97 ) and take into account the magnification bias ( see below for details ) .    in the statistics for gravitational lensing",
    ", there are two independent ways to get the mass function of virialized halos .",
    "one is the generalized press - schechter ( ps ) theory , and the other is schechter luminosity function .",
    "since the ps theory in the framework of @xmath0 theories does not exist , we adopt the latter .",
    "it is established that @xcite , the early - type galaxies dominant strong lensing , the contribution of the late - type galaxies is well neglected in particular when the image separations are larger than @xmath110 , the reason is that the late - type galaxies have larger rotation velocity while have smaller dispersion velocity , which in turn , lead to smaller mean image separations . moreover ,",
    "in our used sqls lens sample all lens galaxies are early - type .",
    "many previous studies for lensing statistics applying the no - evolution of the velocity function get appealing results to agree with the galaxy number counts @xcite and the redshift distribution of lens galaxies @xcite . meanwhile , other studies @xcite have investigated the effects of evolution of the velocity function on the lensing statistics , and they concluded that the simple evolution does not significantly affect lensing statistics if all galaxies are early - type . in our paper , we do not take into account the evolution of the velocity function , instead , we use the modified schechter function @xcite @xmath111\\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma(\\alpha/\\beta)}\\frac { d\\sigma}{\\sigma},\\ ] ] with @xmath112 , which is derived by @xcite upon the latest much larger sdss dr3 data . then the comoving number density is @xmath113 , and @xmath84 is in terms of @xmath107 .    .",

    "moreover , in the case of @xmath142 , we must demand that the left side of eq.([structure ] ) and the right of eq.([h2r ] ) be always positive . in the special case of @xmath143",

    "different choices of the parameter @xmath4 significantly influence the curves near the peak , and @xmath4 increases while the peak declines , but they can not change the position of the peak , which is located approximately at @xmath181 and is beyond the image separation range of sqls lens sample .",
    "we derive constraint on the parameter @xmath3 assuming @xmath5 .",
    "the best - fit value is @xmath7 , so we get @xmath8 .",
    "from @xmath182 we can further get the 95% confidence interval for @xmath3 that is [ -4.633 , -3.754 ] . above approach to get the lens number density can be called bin - method . as another interesting approach",
    ", we assume that the redshifts of the source quasars follow a gaussian distribution , which is used to fit the redshift distribution of 22683 quasars .",
    "the best fit gives the mean @xmath161 and the dispersion @xmath183 . in this approach ,",
    "the predicted number density is computed by @xmath184 .",
    "which is also plotted in figure [ dn2 ] , in order to compare the cases of , standard @xmath6cdm and our obtained best - fitting standard model based on bin - method .    as mentioned earlier ,",
    "the typical type of @xmath0 gravity theories in form of @xmath185 have been extensively studied by using all aspects of observation data . @xcite",
    "combined the snia data from @xcite with the baryon acoustic oscillation length scale data @xcite and the cmb shift parameter @xcite to constrain the parameters of above gravity model , and found that the best - fit model with the value is @xmath186 . similarly ,",
    "by using the supernovae data by the supernova legacy survey @xcite together with the baryon acoustic oscillation peak in the sdss luminosity red galaxy sample @xcite and the cmb shift parameter @xcite , @xcite constrained the parameters to @xmath187 and @xmath188 in the best - fit case .",
    "both works found that the @xmath6cdm model is well within 68.3% confidence level and the constrained parameter @xmath4 is in @xmath189 magnitude .",
    "@xcite calculated the matter power spectrum and matched it with the measurements of sdss @xcite .",
    "the result is that the favored values of @xmath4 are in order of @xmath190 .",
    "meanwhile , the matter power spectrum is also calculated with tt cmb by @xcite .",
    "where , the combined data from wmap @xcite , snls and sdss @xcite is used to restrict the model parameters and it is found that @xmath4 is confined in a even smaller order of @xmath191 . from this point , we can see that the matter power spectrum is rather sensitive to the model parameter @xmath4 , and the model obtained from the observational constraints on the mater power spectrum is seeming indistinguishable from the standard one with @xmath5 . here , we extend these studying by calculating the strong lensing probability and using the sqls dr3 lens sample to constrain the parameters . in figure",
    "[ n ] , we have plotted @xmath192 for the @xmath6cdm model and our best - fitting model with @xmath193 and @xmath194 , as well as the histogram from the sqls dr3 statistical sample . except for both small and large image - separation ends , the non - linear gravity model predicts less number of lenses than those predicted by the @xmath6cdm model , which is linear in the form of ricci scale r. the cosmological parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 are derived from the best - fit case , which are broadly in agreement with other measurements .",
    "we also present the contours for the joint distribution of @xmath3 and @xmath4 in figure [ contour1 ] , we can see that the @xmath6cdm model lies in the 68.3% confidence contour , which is consistent with the results of other works .",
    "figure [ contour2 ] shows the @xmath195 and @xmath196 confidence region of the single parameter @xmath3 or @xmath4 from the projection of the joint confidence lever estimated from @xmath197 and @xmath198 .",
    "we have found that the model @xmath185 is compatible with the lensing observational data subject to the parameter constraints [ -4.67 , -2.89 ] and [ -0.078 , 0.202 ] for @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively , at the 95% confidence level .",
    "obviously , the data coming from the sqls dr3 lens sample can only confine the parameter @xmath4 to order of @xmath189 .     and",
    "@xmath199 on the @xmath200 plane , arising from fitting the strong lensing sample .",
    "our best fit value is @xmath201 , which is marked with a cross , meanwhile the @xmath6cdm model @xmath143 is marked with a star.,width=317 ]     to estimate the region for the single parameter @xmath3 or @xmath4 .",
    "the projections on the vertical and horizontal axises are corresponding to @xmath195 and @xmath196 confident regions for the parameter @xmath4 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the solid line and dotted line show the tangents to the ellipse representing 95% confidence level , parallelling to the horizontal axis and vertical axis respectively.,width=317 ]",
    "to summarize , in this work we have derived new constraints on @xmath185 in the palatini formalism , using the statistics of strong gravitational lensing and the lens sample come from sqls dr3 .",
    "we use @xmath0 within palatini approach because of it being free from the instabilities , passing the solar system and having the correct newtonian limit . this typical type of @xmath0 theories in form of @xmath185",
    "have been recently put forward to explain the late - time expansion phase dominated by dark energy and have been well studied by using the cosmology measurements including background universe evolution parameters , matter power spectrum and cmb . in our paper , we assume that the @xmath0 gravity theories have hardly detectable effect on the gravitational lensing phenomena of galaxy - scale halos , and then the standard lensing is a realistic approximation of lensing in palatini @xmath0 gravity theories .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that in the sqls lens sample , there is a cluster - scale lens , we use sis model to calculate the differential lensing probability to fit the other 10 lens data to avoid destroying the well - defined statistical lens sample .",
    "considering the frw setting , we have shown the background evolution for the late expansion era of matter - dominated phase based on our @xmath0 theory .",
    "the expected lens number density arising from the sqls dr3 sample is not as sensitive as the matter power spectrum to the parameter @xmath4 .",
    "the number density distributions for different values of @xmath4 are indistinguishable to @xmath179 in magnitude , while the matter power spectrum changes a lot even if @xmath4 varies only by a tiny amount , such as an order of magnitude @xmath190 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the matter spectrum can constrain @xmath4 to a small region and make the model hardly deviation from the @xmath6cdm model . but",
    "the values of our best fit model , @xmath193 and @xmath194 , are not much more different from the standard one with @xmath202 and @xmath5 , implying that the model studied is not significantly preferred over the standard model .",
    "the results are consistent with the works of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , in which the best - fitting models are @xmath203 , @xmath204 and @xmath205 , respectively , and we all found that @xmath6cdm lies in the 68.3% confidence level .",
    "finally , we confine the allowed values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 to the ranges [ -4.67,-2.89 ] and [ -0.078 , 0.202 ] at the 95% confidence level , and conclude that the sqls dr3 statistical lens sample can only constrain the parameter @xmath4 to @xmath189 in magnitude .    in our expected number density distribution ( figure [ dn1 ] ) , for any value of @xmath4 with the fixed @xmath147 ,",
    "the peak is at about @xmath181 .",
    "but the lens sample we used , with the image - separation ranging from @xmath206 to @xmath207 , provides no data in @xmath208 , this significantly restrict the constraint precision of the parameters .",
    "the class radio lens sample has the lens image separations of @xmath209 .",
    "naturally , jointing the class and sqls samples to constrain the model will give better results .",
    "of course , a more larger lens sample from future surveys , ( e.g. , square kilometer array , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , will be able to make the constraints on the model more stringent .",
    "furthermore , using the sis model and nfw model together to constrain the @xmath0 theories models arising from the lensing observation data containing both galaxy lens and cluster lens is future work .",
    "finally , we emphasize that our paper is the first try to test @xmath0 gravity theories using strong lensing statistics .",
    "the reason may be that , the possible deviation of gravitational lensing based on @xmath0 gravity theories from that built on gr is not well studied practically .",
    "our results hold on the valid hypotheses that this possible deviation is hardly detectable , and they are not contrary to other works .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , if the @xmath0 theories are successful models to explain the nature of de , they should have no important effects which can be detected on the galaxy - scale and cluster - scale dark halos .",
    "the reason is that de is introduced to explain the acceleration of the universe , which is , of course , in the cosmological scale .",
    "namely , de smoothly permeates the regions of smaller scales , such as galaxies and clusters , then it has no contributions to the inhomogeneity of gravitational potential for such halos . for the dark matter as the dominator of the gravity field ,",
    "the sis and nfw lens models are well consistent with the observations .",
    "it is therefore necessary to test the @xmath0 theories through verifying that the phenomenology is not contradict those observational results that do agree with the predictions of the standard lensing theory .",
    "this critical testing will be presented in future work .",
    "we warmly thank masamune oguri for useful discussion and providing the redshift data of the source quasars .",
    "we also thank p.j .",
    "zhang for his helpful comments on the manuscript and revision of the abstract and the anonymous referee for very useful comments that improved the presentation of the paper .",
