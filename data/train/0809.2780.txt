    "lyman - break galaxies have given us our first detailed look at star formation at high redshifts ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "however , our picture of the distant universe is limited because these objects are selected for strong rest - frame ultraviolet emission arising from substantial unobscured starbursts in the galaxies .",
    "individually , they tell us little about darker baryons at the same redshift , whether the systems containing the baryons are intrinsically less uv - luminous or are obscured by dust .    the lyman - break galaxy ( lbg ) population",
    "has now been probed from @xmath11 @xcite up to @xmath12 @xcite , with tentative detections reported at redshifts as high as @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the photometric and spectroscopic properties of lbgs evolve with increasing redshift .",
    "typical lbgs at @xmath14 have stellar masses of a few times 10@xmath15m@xmath3 , are predominantly young ( @xmath16myr ) , and are sub - solar but not primordial in their metallicity ( z@xmath170.2z@xmath3 ) , where these properties are deduced from their rest - frame optical and near - infrared spectral energy distribution @xcite .",
    "however something is missing in our picture of the universe at @xmath18 .",
    "the youth of lyman - break objects when compared to the range of lookback times probed in a given survey suggests that only a small fraction of the overall population is undergoing a phase of strong unobscured star formation , and hence is detectable in the rest uv , at a given time .",
    "fossil stellar populations in the most massive galaxies at the present time suggest that the bulk of their stars were formed at @xmath19 @xcite , but the mass assembly history of the universe as traced by lbgs implies that only 1% of the baryonic material that will eventually form today s galaxies was in collapsed systems at @xmath20 .",
    "where is the other 99% ?",
    "the bulk of the baryonic material at these high redshifts must be in either low mass systems or the gas phase .",
    "damped lyman - alpha systems in the spectra of distant quasars have shown that dense neutral gas is ubiquitous at high redshift , holding a third of the hi atoms at @xmath20 and appearing in 10% of sight - lines per unit cosmological distance @xcite .",
    "these sources represent reservoirs of neutral gas for star formation , yet are known to be deficient in h@xmath1 relative to local galaxies .",
    "molecular gas is instead more tightly concentrated in high - density , relatively dusty regions @xcite .",
    "securely identifying this material is challenging . at @xmath14 ,",
    "the far - infrared lines emitted by cool and obscured material are redshifted to millimeter wavelengths , but not necessarily into an atmospheric window . at these extreme luminosity distances lines",
    "are faint , requiring long integration times to secure even a tentative detection .",
    "the fields of view of existing millimeter interferometers are small , and their correlators have , until recently , been limited to bandwidths of a few hundred mhz ( equivalent to @xmath21 ) .",
    "the resulting small volumes made survey work at high redshift unfeasible . as a result",
    ", the few detections of line emission from molecular and atomic gas at high redshift have been towards active galactic nuclei - quasars to @xmath22 , radio galaxies to @xmath23 @xcite - and hence probed highly atypical environments .    in this paper",
    "we present the results of a pilot programme to explore the cool gas associated with a large scale structure at @xmath18 marked out by lyman - break galaxies rather than by an active galaxy .",
    "our 40 arcmin@xmath24 target field contains seven uv - luminous sources with spectroscopically confirmed redshifts in a narrow range ( @xmath25 ) , a 6@xmath5 excess over the typical density of such sources in our survey , but shows no clear spatial clustering .",
    "given the redshift dispersion and spatial distribution of these galaxies , it is clear that their star formation can not be a response to a common triggering event , and yet the probability of such a configuration arising by chance is small .",
    "the simplest explanation is that there is a large mass of hidden baryons in this field at this redshift . at any one time",
    "this structure is traced by the small fraction of that material undergoing comparatively short - term uv - luminous star formation events and appearing as lbgs .",
    "while the stars within the lbgs are likely to end up in the most massive current - day galaxies after subsequent mergers , the total stellar mass in even this overdensity of lbgs is an order of magnitude too small to account for the stars in the most massive spheroids . consequently , there should be far more baryons in the vicinity of the lbgs than revealed in the uv .",
    "our pilot programme was designed to probe the cool gas mass in a small section of the structure , centered on a pair of lbgs with lyman-@xmath26 emission redshifts separated by @xmath27 .",
    "the observations target not only the two lbgs , but any darker / fainter systems in the underlying large scale structure .",
    "the results for lower redshift lbgs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggested that we were unlikely to detect the two known galaxies directly .",
    "all magnitudes in this paper are quoted in the ab system @xcite .",
    "we adopt a @xmath28cdm cosmology with ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31)=(0.7 , 0.3 , 0.7 ) .",
    "the observations were carried out at the australia telescope compact array in march - april 2008 .",
    "the array was in the relatively compact h168 configuration , with both north - south and east - west baselines .",
    "we used the correlator in the 128 mhz/64 channel configuration with two overlapping intermediate frequency ( if ) bands , giving a total bandwidth of 240mhz , and measuring the total incident flux density , but not polarization .",
    "we investigated two transitions of co at high redshift . in order to constrain the co(1 - 0 ) line",
    ", we tuned the if bands to 18.838ghz and 18.958ghz ( allowing detection of an emission line in the range @xmath32 ) . in this configuration ,",
    "the spectral resolution is 4mhz or 63.5kms@xmath8 .",
    "observations were taken in three 8hr observing periods on the nights of 2008 march 22 - 24 ( although data taken on the 23rd were discarded due to poor weather ) . a single pointing was observed for the entire observing period , and a nearby bright source ( 1045 - 188 ) observed every 15 mins to determine phase stability . pointing accuracy was checked every hour .",
    "absolute flux calibration was through observations of 1921 - 293 ( the standard flux calibrator at the atca ) each night .",
    "the half - power - beam - width ( hpbw ) of the atca at this frequency is 2.5 arcmin and the naturally - weighted restoring beam in this configuration is 15.9@xmath33 10.9 .",
    "the co(2 - 1 ) line was observed in four 11hr observations on the nights of 2008 apr 04 - 07 using the recently - commissioned 7 mm receiver system .",
    "the if bands were tuned to 37.672ghz and 37.792ghz ( giving redshift coverage @xmath34 ) .",
    "a single pointing centered on the 18.8ghz field center was observed , and 1045 - 188 was used as a pointing and phase calibrator .",
    "uranus , the primary flux calibrator for the atca at millimeter wavelengths , was not visible at any point in our observing period .",
    "instead we bootstrap our primary flux calibration from two compact hii regions , observed each night , which were also observed using our configuration by atca staff on the afternoon of 2008 apr 04 together with uranus and a bandpass calibrator . at this frequency , the hpbw is 74  and the restoring beam is 7.3@xmath33 4.8 .",
    "the total useful observing time was 16 hours at 18.9ghz and 44 hours at 37.7ghz .",
    "the rms noise in the final images is 0.11 mjy / beam and 0.10 mjy / beam in each 4mhz channel at 18.9 and 37.7ghz respectively .    [",
    "cols=\"^,<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : sources ]",
    "as illustrated in figure [ fig : image ] , our pointing included two lyman-@xmath26 emitting , lyman - break galaxies within the hpbw at 18.9ghz ( table [ tab : sources ] ) . at 37.7ghz",
    "one of these ( at @xmath35 ) lies well outside the beam half - power point , while the second ( at @xmath36 ) remains close to the pointing center .",
    "neither galaxy shows evidence for line or continuum emission in either of the two transitions surveyed .",
    "this is not , in itself , surprising given the youth and low masses ( typically a few @xmath37m@xmath3 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of @xmath20 lyman - break galaxies . however , these observations provide the strongest constraint yet on the molecular gas content of @xmath18 star - forming galaxies .",
    "we use our limiting flux at the frequency of the redshifted co(1 - 0 ) line to constrain the molecular gas content of these galaxies .",
    "we employ the widely - used conversion factor of m@xmath38/@xmath39=0.8 m@xmath3 ( kkms@xmath8pc@xmath24)@xmath8 based on local infrared - luminous galaxies .",
    "our image rms noise of 0.11 mjy / beam at the co(1 - 0 ) line corresponds to a formal 2 sigma limit @xmath40 kkms@xmath8pc@xmath41 for the luminosity of an unresolved 200 km s@xmath8 emission line at @xmath0 .",
    "thus we constrain the molecular gas mass of the known lyman - break galaxies in this field to be m(h@xmath1)@xmath2m@xmath3 ( 2@xmath5 ) .",
    "one of our lbgs ( source b in table [ tab : sources ] ) is also close to the center of the beam in our 37ghz observations . for thermalized , optically - thick co emission ,",
    "the line luminosity is independent of transition . making this assumption , non - detection of the 2 - 1",
    "line places a tighter constraint on the mass of m(h@xmath1)@xmath42m@xmath3 ( 2@xmath5 ) , comparable to the inferred stellar mass in such sources .",
    "inspection of the atca data cubes revealed no evidence for continuum sources .",
    "only one emission feature was found to extend over more than two adjacent frequency channels .",
    "this feature , a spatially - unresolved emission line centered at 37.642ghz with a fwhm of 110kms@xmath8 ( equivalent to four independent frequency channels ) , lies on the beam half - power point .",
    "it has a peak flux of @xmath43mjy / beam , and a velocity integrated flux of @xmath7 jy km s@xmath8 . a combined frame of channels not containing line emission ( a total bandwidth of 180mhz ) shows no significant continuum emission with a formal limit on the continuum of @xmath440.49 mjy / beam at 37.73ghz .",
    "the line emission is centered 1 arcminute ( 370kpc , comoving ) north - west and 40 arcseconds ( 250kpc ) north - east of our spectroscopically confirmed lyman - break galaxies at @xmath36 and @xmath35 respectively , towards more lbgs in the field .",
    "this line emitter is undetected at 18.9ghz and not spatially coincident with a known source at any observed wavelength ( from 0.5@xmath45 m to 21 cm ) .",
    "our optical and ir data require that the host galaxy must have a flux density @xmath46jy at an observed frame wavelength of 4.5@xmath45 m ( 0.7@xmath45 m rest if at @xmath47 ) and @xmath48jy at a 0.8@xmath45 m ( 1300  rest ) .",
    "no sub - mm data exist at this location .",
    "we note that the lensing properties of this field are well understood , and we use the lensing maps of to estimate a maximum 10% enhancement in the flux of a source at this location .    in order to verify the reality of the 37.6ghz line , we investigated its properties thoroughly .",
    "the velocity - integrated line is a formal 8@xmath5 detection in a multi - frequency synthesis image of 6 channels centered on the line emission .",
    "it is detected in the @xmath49-dataset on multiple baselines , and in two independent sub - sets of the data .",
    "its strength in the flux - calibrated image is independent of image deconvolution algorithm and the location of the imaging center .",
    "we conclude that this is unlikely to be a spurious detection .",
    "we evaluate the probability that this is a line emitter at a redshift unrelated to our high redshift system ( i.e. not a co(2 - 1 ) emission line ) , by considering the population models of @xcite .",
    "these authors calculated the expected number density of line emitters as a function of frequency and line flux , given models for galaxy and dark matter distributions at @xmath50 . as a cautious assumption",
    ", we consider the source counts predicted at 50ghz at our integrated flux density ( while noting that source counts at 37.6ghz are likely to be lower ) . in our 256mhz total bandwidth , and allowing for source detections within 1.5 hpbw , we would expect 0.003 line emitters in our survey , with these dominated by redshifted co(1 - 0 ) lines at @xmath51 .",
    "coupled with the known existence of structure at @xmath0 in this field , we interpret the line detection as co(2 - 1 ) emission at @xmath6 at high confidence .    at the measured line flux in the co(2 - 1 ) transition , and assuming constant luminosity , the expected counterpart in the 1 - 0 transition would be below the 2@xmath5 level at 18.8ghz , consistent with our non - detection .",
    "using the same co - to - h@xmath1 conversion factor discussed in section [ sec : lbg_limits ] applied to the luminosity of the co(2 - 1 ) transition , we infer a molecular gas mass of m(h@xmath1)@xmath52 m@xmath3 in this source .",
    "the beam width at 37.7ghz implies an upper limit on the physical size of our unresolved source of 45@xmath3330kpc . a simple virial calculation assuming a uniform mass distribution suggests that our derived gas mass could represent up to 50% of the dynamical mass in the system , while remaining both bound and smaller than our beam size .",
    "this pilot survey at 37.7ghz probed only 3% of the projected spatial distribution and 35% of the redshift range occupied by clustered uv - luminous galaxies in our target field . despite this , the gas mass inferred from our single detection is comparable to the total stellar mass in uv - luminous sources in the structure .",
    "if this detection is typical of the space density of molecular line emitters in this field , then galaxies with unobscured star formation represent at best a few percent of the baryons present ( consistent with * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the nomenclature of",
    ", our detected source is an early universe molecular emission line galaxy ( emg ) , a broad category including radio galaxies , sub - mm galaxies and qsos at @xmath53 .",

    "this yield is plausible from @xmath55 population iii stars , each of 100m@xmath3 , in as little as the stellar lifetime ( 10myr , * ? ? ?",
    "by contrast , the yield of more conventional supernovae and the typical star formation rates of uv - luminous sources in this field ( @xmath5630m@xmath3yr@xmath8 ) , @xmath57 years would be required ( see * ? ? ? * ) implying either early and continuous star formation , or an early , intense starburst . a source with unobscured star formation of 10m@xmath3yr@xmath8 at @xmath0",
    "would have been detected in our deep optical imaging , but observations of dust emission in the rest - frame far - infrared will be necessary to distinguish between a mature stellar population at the time of observation and ongoing , but dust - obscured , star formation .",
    "it is interesting to compare our detection with a similar observation at @xmath23 , also using the atca .",
    "@xcite studied a high mass system at this redshift , marked out by the presence of at least six lyman-@xmath26 emitter galaxies and a powerful radio galaxy . based on uv - luminous stellar mass",
    ", this system should be comparable in mass to our target region .",
    "@xcite detected co emission in the 1 - 0 and 5 - 4 transitions , clearly associated with the radio galaxy . while the inferred gas mass is within a factor of four of our object , the velocity structure differs : the emission line detected by @xcite was twice as broad as our line emitter , possibly due to momentum input from the radio source .",
    "we note that the co luminosity and derived mass of our line - emitter are similar to those of sub - millimeter galaxies ( smgs ) at lower redshifts @xcite .",
    "these are also often a ssociated with galaxy overdensities at high redshift ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while some smgs with this mass would have been detected in our deep",
    "spitzer_/irac imaging ( based on their @xmath58-band magnitudes at @xmath59 , * ? ? ?",
    "* redshifted to @xmath0 ) , others would not .",
    "co emission is not a reliable star formation rate ( sfr ) indicator , but is loosely correlated with far - infrared luminosity , and hence sfr .",
    "data on this relation at high redshift is sparse , but known emgs with comparable gas masses to our detected source have sfrs of @xmath60m@xmath3yr@xmath8 .",
    "by contrast , the tight limit on h@xmath1 mass in the lbgs in our field would imply obscured star formation rates of less than a few hundred solar masses per year , even given dust properties similar to those of smgs .",
    "our detected source likely represents a more extreme environment than that seen in lbgs at the same redshift and could be a high redshift counterpart for the intense starbursts in smgs .",
    "it is becoming increasingly clear that no one survey technique can provide a complete picture of large scale structure at high redshift .",
    "overdensities of lyman break galaxies are correlated with the presence of lyman - alpha emitters , radio galaxies , smgs , dlas @xcite , and now molecular emission line galaxies at the same redshift .",
    "each component of the structure may account for only a few percent of the baryonic mass and each presents observational challenges . while lbgs and dlas probe comparable mass haloes at @xmath61 @xcite",
    ", molecular line emitters may probe more massive and denser regions of the same structures .",
    "extensive extrapolation based on a single line from a single source is risky .",
    "observations of this source in other emission lines will be required to confirm its redshift and luminosity .",
    "such observations will also begin to characterize the gas temperature and density , and determine whether the co to gas mass conversion factor for ulirgs is appropriate for low mass systems at early times .",
    "additional sources must be identified and characterized to determine whether our initial detection is anomalous or typical of its population .",
    "ultimately , more extensive millimeter surveys , based on existing deep datasets , are required to establish the molecular gas content of large scale structures at high redshift , and to probe this early stage of galaxy formation .",
    "our main conclusions can be summarized as follows :      \\(ii ) neither of two known lyman break galaxies in our survey area show associated molecular line emission , suggesting that their molecular gas content does not significantly exceed their stellar content .",
