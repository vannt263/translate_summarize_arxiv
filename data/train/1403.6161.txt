    "<S> our analytical results in @xcite were written , in contrast , in terms of a different function , @xmath31 which is defined in our works @xcite and @xcite by @xmath32 which is related to @xmath21 and @xmath23 by @xmath33 and whose finite part at zero external momenta was given in @xcite as @xmath34 we want to emphasise that our results in @xcite are correct . </S>",
    "<S> we would also like to remark that we did not mention at all in any of these two works the alternative function @xmath35 , contrary to what is transmitted in @xcite and in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , their comments on the relations of our results with @xmath35 are misleading . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we would also like to clarify that in order to make a proper comparison between our results here and those in terms of @xmath35 , one should make the identification of @xmath24 with @xmath35 </S>",
    "<S> .    finally , we would also like to correct here the formula ( b10 ) of the appendix b in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we wrote incorrectly the finite part of @xmath24 in terms of the finite part of @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , our equation ( b10 ) in @xcite , where it was incorrectly set @xmath36 , should be replaced by this now corrected ( b10 ) : @xmath37 we have redone all the plots in @xcite with the corrected formulas and we have found no difference at all in any of the numerical results and plots of this article . </S>",
    "<S> thus , these corrections are numerically totally irrelevant for our work in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have also checked that these corrections do not change any of our numerical results in refs.@xcite and @xcite where the @xmath0-penguin diagrams were also participating . finally , as an extra check of our formulas for the one - loop @xmath0-form factors , </S>",
    "<S> we have also found agreement with the corresponding lfv @xmath38 effective vertices of ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast we do not find agreement with the formulas for the @xmath0-penguin form factors in ref.@xcite . </S>"
