    "the fact that systems of coupled oscillators can describe problems in physics , chemistry , biology , neuroscience and many other disciplines , is already widely accepted by the scientific community .",
    "they have been used to model diverse phenomena such as : josephson junction arrays , multimode lasers , vortex dynamics in fluids , biological information processes , neurodynamics @xcite .",
    "the coupled oscillators have been observed to synchronize themselves ( say to a common frequency value ) in a variety of ways , such as total , partial , generalized , lag , etc .",
    ", when the coupling strength varies @xcite . in spite of the diversity of dynamics , all these systems synchronize themselves to a common frequency , in a tree - like clustering behavior , when the coupling strength between these oscillators increases @xcite",
    ". among the coupled oscillators systems , is the system of coupled limit cycle s , which has attracted interests .",
    "the synchronization phenomena of such system , in spite of the diversity of dynamics can be described using simple models of coupled phase equations .",
    "although there has been an extensive exploration of the dynamical behavior of the coupled limit cycles that show the synchronization phenomena , many interesting features remain unknown and little has been done analytically .",
    "special attention has been given to the complex synchronization tree of a system of non - chaotic oscillators with nearest neighbors sinusoidal interactions , which becomes chaotic when the interaction is turned on @xcite .",
    "this system , a diffusive version of the kuramoto model @xcite , in spite of its simplicity , possesses all the features of phase synchronization of a system of chaotic oscillators .",
    "\\label{kura : theta}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath1 are the natural frequencies , selected randomly from a normal gaussian distribution , @xmath2 is the coupling strength , @xmath3 is the instantaneous phase , @xmath4 is the instantaneous frequency and @xmath5",
    ". such oscillators with nearest neighbors interaction have been seen in the literature to describe josephson junctions , laser arrays and phase - locked loops @xcite .",
    "these nonidentical oscillators cluster in time averaged frequency , until they completely synchronize to a common value of the average frequency @xcite , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 using periodic boundary conditions @xmath9 , and scaling the frequencies such that : @xmath10 the above system ( 1 ) of @xmath11 oscillators has a critical coupling strength @xmath12 , where at @xmath13 a complete frequency synchronization can be observed and each @xmath3 is locked to a fixed value .",
    "there is no phase locking for @xmath14 although the system has clusters of oscillators of the same _ average _ frequencies .",
    "reducing further the coupling strength @xmath2 , the number of units which cluster to the same average frequency decreases , increasing the number of clusters , i.e. the number of branches in the synchronization tree , until finally all oscillators are independent and acquire their natural frequencies .",
    "the scaling of frequencies ( [ omega_scale ] ) in the case of system ( [ kura : theta ] ) limits the synchronization to zero frequency .",
    "when this scaling is not used @xcite , the general features of the system and the value of @xmath15 will not change , the synchronization occurs via the same transition tree but shifted to a common frequency value @xmath16 as long as we maintain the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "when we lift them , the system becomes dependent on the value of @xmath17 @xcite , therefore , we shall keep @xmath17 different from zero throughout this work .    in fig .",
    "[ kura_n10 ] we show the synchronization tree for a periodic system with @xmath18 oscillators . also in fig .",
    "[ lyap_periodic ] we plot the first three largest lyapunov exponents as a function of the coupling strength , @xmath2 . at and above the critical coupling strength , @xmath15 , the largest lyapunov exponent becomes zero with the rest     oscillators , with periodic boundary conditions ( @xmath19 ) . ]",
    "oscillators ]    of them being negative , an indication of synchronization .",
    "the initial frequencies for figs .  [ kura_n10 ] and [ lyap_periodic ] are chosen as @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "the analysis of synchronization and the loss of stability becomes particularly difficult since , as we mentioned above , it is on long time average that these systems synchronize .",
    "therefore , for a system ( 1 ) , one can performs analytic calculations only where the variables ( phase and frequency ) become time independent . in order to do that",
    ", it is necessary to make sure that we are in a zone of stationary states so that averages are equal to instantaneous values of the phases and frequencies .",
    "henceforward , it becomes clear that we need to arrive at @xmath15 from above ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "we shall start with the case of periodic boundary conditions . at complete synchronization",
    "all average frequencies are equal and all phase differences are constant , while its sum equals zero .",
    "since @xmath17 is different from zero it is necessary to use the phase differences defined as @xmath30 .",
    "then , the equation ( [ kura : theta ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath31 in order to have complete frequency synchronization , the above systems of equations should have stable steady states . it can be seen from equation ( [ kura : phase_diff ] ) that the stability of the frequency steady states is independent of the initial frequencies as well as the coupling constant @xmath2 provided @xmath32 .",
    "thus , if we could establish a criteria for the existence of a stable steady states for a minimum value of @xmath33 , then simply the minimum value of @xmath2 is equal to the critical coupling strength , @xmath15 , since the system remains synchronized once full synchronization has been achieved ( for @xmath13 ) . to find this minimum we use the method of lagrange multipliers .",
    "we should note that the frequencies of the system synchronize on time average , and after complete frequency synchronization all @xmath34 , and the @xmath35 s are all constants .",
    "therefore as long as the calculation is done above @xmath15 , we can exchange the variables by their time independent values .",
    "it is straightforward to see from the steady states of ( [ kura : phase_diff ] ) , where @xmath36 , that @xmath37 and @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 in addition , from the definition of @xmath35 , it follows that @xmath41 we optimize the function ( [ eq : kval ] ) subject to the conditions ( [ eq : cond1 ] ) and ( [ eq : cond2 ] ) .",
    "then the minimum value of @xmath33 is the critical value @xmath15 , provided that the set @xmath42 form a stable steady state of ( [ kura : phase_diff ] ) .    for the above purpose ,",
    "let us define a function @xmath43 as    @xmath44 + \\lambda_0 \\sum_{i=1}^{n } \\phi_i^*,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath45 , @xmath46 are parameters . to have an optimum @xmath2 one should solve @xmath47 the above conditions yield the following algebraic equation in addition to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : cond1 ] ) and ( [ eq : cond2 ] ) @xmath48 we can obtain the steady states @xmath49 , @xmath50 values by solving eqs .",
    "( [ eq : cond1 ] ) , ( [ eq : cond2 ] ) and ( [ eq : cond3 ] ) .",
    "hence we solve the above set of equations using newton - raphson method .",
    "assuming a random set of initial values for @xmath49 s , we look for converged and stable values for @xmath49 s , then the values of @xmath32 are estimated using eq .",
    "( [ eq : kval ] ) .",
    "the application of these equations bring the results shown in table  [ table1 ] .",
    ".critical @xmath2 values ( @xmath15 ) for the case periodic boundary conditions [ cols=\"^ , > , > \" , ]     @xmath49 , @xmath51 . in table",
    "[ table2 ] we show the results obtained for the case of fixed ends , where it is easy to see that the analytic and numeric values of the critical coupling are in a good agreement .",
    "in this paper we have performed analytic calculations , for a system of coupled oscillators through nearest neighbor coupling with different boundary conditions , at the transition to complete synchronization .",
    "these oscillators are known to synchronize on time average frequencies , forming clusters , increasing the number of oscillators in each , until they come to complete synchronization . until this",
    "is achieved the oscillators remain time dependent , chaotic or otherwise , as shown by the lyapunov exponent from fig .",
    "[ lyap_periodic ] .",
    "we calculated the value of the coupling strength , @xmath15 , at complete synchronization .",
