    "it has been previously observed in low - density 2dess of mesoscopic dimensions that @xmath1 saturates or even _ decreases _ upon lowering the temperature @xmath6 below @xmath7 1  k  @xcite suggesting a destabilisation of the insulating phase .",
    "this is especially remarkable in light of the fact that at these low values of density ( @xmath8 10@xmath2  m@xmath3 ) @xmath9 where it is expected that the 2des be strongly localised and the transport acivated .",
    "the density - dependence of @xmath1 in this regime has been observed to obey a kosterlitz - thouless law suggesting that the 2des is undergoing a disorder - to - order transition as @xmath10 is decreased  @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that the thermopower is more sensitive to inter - electron interactions than the electrical resistivity  @xcite and , as explained in the following , contains complementary information .",
    "the mott formula  @xcite relates the diffusion thermopower @xmath11 and the electrical conductivity @xmath12 of a system as :    @xmath13    here @xmath14 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath15 is the charge of the carriers , @xmath16 is the energy and @xmath17 is the chemical potential os the system .",
    "thus we see that @xmath18 contains complementary information to @xmath12 being , as it is , sensitive to its energy - derivative .",
    "motivated by this , we have recently performed thermopower measurements on low - density , mesoscopic 2dess to investigate many - body effects in them  @xcite . in the present manuscript",
    "we first briefly review our results and then present a picture that self - consistently explains the observations in refs .",
    "a schematic represenation of the device and measurement setup are given in figure  [ device ] .",
    "our measurement devices are fabricated in si - doped gaas / algaas heterostructures in which the dopants are confined to a monolayer 40  nm above the 2des .",
    "the as - grown mobility of the wafer is 220  m@xmath19/vs at a carrier density @xmath20  2.2 @xmath21 10@xmath22  m@xmath3 .",
    "we used optical and electron - beam lithography to define the mesoscopic 2des ( l@xmath21w = 1 - 2  @xmath17 m  @xmath21  8  @xmath17 m ) .",
    "@xmath1 was measured in a 4-probe setup using a lock - in amplifier at 7  hz . to measure @xmath0 we imposed a temperature gradient along its length using a large heating current @xmath23  = 4 - 5  @xmath17a at @xmath24  = 11  hz and detected the thermovoltage @xmath25 using a lock - in amplifier at 2@xmath24 . to measure the temperature difference",
    "@xmath26 across the device , we adapted a method following refs .",
    "@xcite wherein we measured the thermovoltage due to @xmath26 between pairs of large bar gate - defined regions ( @xmath7  10  @xmath17 m in linear dimension ) biased such that the 2dess underneath them are in the non - interacting drude - metal - like regime . under such circumstances ,",
    "the thermopower is given by :    @xmath27    here @xmath28 is the effective mass of the carriers , @xmath29 is the density of carriers and @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the momentum scattering time .",
    "further details regarding the measurement process can be found in ref .",
    "in figure  [ tempdependence ] we show the behavior of @xmath0 as a function of @xmath6 .",
    "the two panels contrast the behaviour in the two regimes where @xmath32 and @xmath9 .",
    "it is seen that in the former , the observed @xmath0 agrees closely with @xmath18 ( equation  [ drudemottformula ] ) while in the latter , while @xmath33 is still linear for @xmath34 0.7  k , @xmath0 is 2 orders of magnitude larger than @xmath18 . above 0.7",
    "k @xmath0 grows at a much more rapid rate attaining exceedingly large values of @xmath35  mv / k at 1  k. super - linear growths in @xmath0 are often associated with phonon - drag  @xcite , however , no similar increased growth rate is observed at higher @xmath10 ( see figure  [ tempdependence]a ) , leaving open the possibility that the observed phonomenon is diffusive in nature .",
    "the agreement between @xmath0 and @xmath18 at high @xmath10 serves as a good control experiment that validates the @xmath26 measurement and eliminates the possibility of artifacts arising due to sample parameters and device geometry .    in figures",
    "[ densitydependence]a and [ densitydependence]b we plot the @xmath10-dependence of @xmath1 and @xmath0 at @xmath6 = 0.3  k , respectively .",
    "there are several points worth noticing : 1 ) @xmath1 grows monotonically as a function of @xmath10 over the entire range .",
    "2 ) in sharp contrast to this , @xmath0 is highly non - monotonic over the same @xmath10-range , frequently changing sign .",
    "3 ) @xmath0 tracks @xmath18 closely until @xmath7 2 @xmath21 10@xmath2  m@xmath3 around which point the oscillations set in .",
    "4 ) as @xmath10 is lowered further @xmath0 increases rapidly in magnitude , exceeding @xmath18 by 2 orders of magnitude at the lowest @xmath10 .",
    "the data presented shows a measured breakdown of the mott formula , equation  [ mottformula ] .",
    "the mott formula is based on semiclassical , boltzmann - like transport and thus we can expect departures from it when interaction effects are strong as is the case in the present study .",
    "we first address the large magnitude of @xmath0 . in order to do so",
    ", we inspect the @xmath10-dependence of @xmath1 and , as noted in refs .",
    "@xcite we see that the dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath10 is well fit by a kosterlitz - thouless  @xcite law ,    @xmath36    here @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are fit parameters , @xmath39 being the transition density . as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , this implies that as @xmath10 is reduced towards @xmath39 the 2des approaches an ordered phase by the systematic elimination of topological defects and the topological defects rather than the bare electrons that mediate the electrical transport .",
    "while the exact nature of the ordered state can not be ascertained using transport measurements alone , possible candidates include wigner  @xcite , striped phases  @xcite and bubble phases  @xcite . since @xmath40 the number of topological defects @xmath41 , we estimate @xmath42 , where @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath43 are obtained from the fit in figure  [ densitydependence]a and @xmath44 is an unknown constant .",
    "we now test the applicablity of this idea to the case of @xmath0 , i.e. , we ask whether the topological defects mediate the thermal transport as well .",
    "we note that this idea can readily be used to explain the enhancement in @xmath45 since the number of topological defects @xmath46 which , according to equation  [ drudemottformula ] , would bring about such an enhancement . to check this quantitatively ,",
    "we plot @xmath0 as a function of @xmath41 in figure  [ svsnd ]",
    ". we immediately find that in the region where @xmath0 deviates from @xmath18 , oscillations notwithstanding , it obeys a @xmath47 envelope .",
    "this strengthens the notion that the topological defects and not the bare electrons are responsible for transport in the 2des ( see equation  [ drudemottformula ] ) .",
    "the value of @xmath44 used in figure  [ svsnd ] is obtained by fitting the observed @xmath0 to equation  [ drudemottformula ] and assuming the electronic values of @xmath48 and @xmath28 .",
    "we note that this need not be the case though it is beyond the scope of the present measurements to resolve this issue .",
    "the topological defects behave essentially as non - interacting , free quasiparticles and this also explains the observed metallic @xmath6-dependence of @xmath0 .",
    "we finally address the oscillations in @xmath0 as a function of @xmath10 .",
    "while the position and magnitude of these oscillations are device - dependent ( see reference  @xcite ) we note that in all the devices measured , they are completely absent in @xmath1 .",
    "this is in stark contrast to coulomb blockade oscillations in which @xmath12 and @xmath0 oscillate synchronously as the system parameters are varied ( see for example refs .",
    "we also note that previour conductance measurements on similar 2dess  @xcite have shown intriguing oscillations that , once again , can not be reconciled with coulomb blockade behaviour and suggest , rather , the formation of pinned charge - density - wave phases .",
    "it is possible that the oscillations reflect the entropy of the 2des  @xcite , though further experiments are required to resolve this matter .",
    "our electrical and thermal transport measurements combine to present a self - consistent picture in which novel quasiparticles born of inter - electron interactions mediate transport . these quasiparticles impart a metallic character to the 2des and enhance its thermopower by more than two orders of magnitude .",
    "the thermopower of the 2des is also seen to oscillate strongly as the density is varied and these oscillations are completely absent in the resistivity .",
    "while the origin of these oscillations is unknown , they are a striking example of the thermopower being more sensitive to interactions than the electrical resistivity .",
