    "the fabrication under controlled experimental conditions of graphene nanoribbons ( gnrs ) has attracted a lot of scientific interest in the last decade@xcite .",
    "gnrs are single atomic layers which can be understood as an infinite unrolled carbon nanotube .",
    "the special electronic behavior of gnrs defined by their quasi one - dimensional electronic confinement and the shape of the ribbons ends ( two cases of maximum symmetries can be obtained : zigzag and armchair ends@xcite ) , suggest remarkable applications in graphene - based devices@xcite .",
    "moreover , due to the flat structure gnrs seem to be easier to manipulate than carbon nanotubes . the transport properties of these structures have been studied with special interest by several scientific groups .",
    "peres et al@xcite find that for clean systems , the quantization condition for the electronic conductance is different for zigzag and armchair gnrs .",
    "shi et al@xcite show that applying a gate voltage to the ribbons it is possible to obtain an electronic switch very useful to study the klein paradox .    in this work we present a theoretical description of the electronic and transport properties of graphene heterostructures formed by armchair gnrs of different widths .",
    "the systems are composed by m unit cells of a semiconducting @xmath0 armchair gnr surrounded by two semi - infinite @xmath1 metallic ribbons [ with the condition @xmath0",
    "= @xmath1 + 4 ] .",
    "these kinds of systems allow us to consider two possible configurations : a cross - bar and a t - shaped heterostructure , which are schematically shown in fig.1@xcite .",
    "we investigate the effects of a weak external perturbation applied on the edges atoms of these two heterostructures .",
    "the external perturbation slightly modifies the on - site energies of these atoms , allowing the mixture of continuous and localized states of the system .",
    "we found the presence of two kind of localized states : interface states and bound states in the continuum .",
    "the former states reside in the interface of the two perpendicular nanoribbons .",
    "the latter states are bound states due to the quantum interference of the electron wavefunction inside of the nanoribbons intersection@xcite .",
    "the external potential allows the contribution of these localized states to the transmission of the electrons through the central conductor which can be observed in the conductance of these systems .    .",
    "the black rectangle define the unit cell of the central part.,width=6,height=7 ]",
    "the systems are described in a real - space picture which allows to incorporate the potential fluctuations at the microscopic scale .",
    "we adopt a single @xmath2-band tight - binding hamiltonian taking into account only nearest - neighbor hopping interaction ( with @xmath3 ) . the density of states ( dos ) and the conductance of the systems are obtained in the green s function formalism based on real - space renormalization techniques@xcite .",
    "the conductance is calculated using the surface green s functions matching formalism@xcite . within this picture",
    "the full system is partitioned into three parts : the central structure ( the gnr intersection region ) and two leads ( two semi - infinite metallic gnrs ) . in the linear response approach",
    ", the conductance can be calculated using the landauer formula given by : @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the transmission function of an electron crossing through a central conductor ( for more details see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the strength of the external perturbation is written in term of the potential difference between the edges atoms of the central structure , @xmath6 . in what follows all the energies",
    "are written in terms of the hopping parameter @xmath7 and the fermi energy level is taken as the zero of the energies .",
    "results of the dos for the heterostructures formed by m=3 unit cells of @xmath0=9 and leads with @xmath1=5 , for different external potential strengths @xmath6 , are shown in fig .",
    "2 . in the lower panel",
    "we show the behavior of the dos of the two considered structures as a function of the energy .",
    "we include in the plot the dos of a pristine armchair gnrs n=5 ( solid black online ) for comparison . for the cross - bar heterostructure ( dash blue online ) , two kind of states",
    "can be distinguished : interface states and bound states in the continuum ( resonant states ) .",
    "the interface states come from the junction region between the leads and the central ribbon structure .",
    "these states are pinned at the van hove singularities of the pristine n=5 armchair gnr . on the other hand , the bound states in the continuum ( two symmetric states with respect to the fermi level at @xmath8 ) arise from the interference of the electron wave function inside the central ribbon .",
    "the occurrence of these states is only an effect of the space symmetry of the heterostructure configuration .",
    "this can be corroborated comparing the behavior of the dos of the t - shaped structure ( dot red online ) with the cross - bar structure .",
    "it is possible to observe the interface states at the same energies as that for the cross - bar heterostructure but the bound states disappear due to the breaking of the spatial symmetry of the system @xcite .",
    "we analyze the effect of the external potential strength @xmath6 on the bound states and interface states of the heterostructures . in the central panel",
    "we show the behavior of one bound state ( @xmath9 ) and one interface state ( @xmath10 ) of the cross - bar heterostructure for different potential strengths @xmath6 .",
    "it is possible to observe that the bound state is not degenerated and the effect of the external potential is only a slight displacement of the energy level proportional to @xmath6 . on the other hand , besides of the energy shift , the interface state shows a break of its degeneracy at @xmath6=0.06@xmath7 .",
    "this fact affects the conductance of the system as we see later . in the upper panel",
    "we show the behavior of the interface state pinned at @xmath10 for the t - shaped heterostructure . as expected due to its nature , the same behavior of the cross - bar heterostructure is obtained , a break of the degeneracy and an energy shift proportional to @xmath6 can be observed .    .",
    "]    in what follow we consider the behavior of the conductance of the heterostructures described before as a function of the external perturbation potential",
    ". results of the conductance for the cross - bar heterostructures @xmath11 and @xmath12@xmath13 , for different external potential strengths @xmath6 are shown in fig .",
    "3 . for all considered values of @xmath6",
    "the system shows a semiconductor behavior@xcite . a fano antiresonance pinned at @xmath14 and a thin fano resonance pinned at @xmath15 , which arise from the electron interference inside of the central structure , are almost invariant when the external potential is applied over the cental structure . for @xmath6 @xmath16",
    "0 very thin peaks and dips can be observed in the conductance curves at defined energy levels .",
    "for instance , at energy equal to @xmath10 the conductance shows an evolution between peaks and dips depending on the strength of @xmath6 . this behavior is due to the shift and break of degeneracy of the interface states at that energy .",
    "the intensity of the dips becomes a quantum of conductance for @xmath6 @xmath17 @xmath18 . for energy equal to @xmath15 a thin peak in the conductance",
    "is observed , which evolves with the potential strength .",
    "these peaks are produced by a bound state that becomes a resonant one for finite @xmath6 values and it starts to contribute to the transmission of the system when the external potential is applied .",
    "results of the conductance for the t - shaped heterostructures for different potential strengths @xmath6 are shown in fig .",
    "4 . similar to the cross - bar heterostructures ,",
    "the system has a semiconductor behavior for all considered @xmath6 values . in comparison with the cross - bar heterostructure",
    ", the conductance shows more antiresonances ( i.e point of zero conductance ) .",
    "these antiresonances arise from the fano effect due to the destructive interference of the electron when it follows different pathways .",
    "it is possible to observe at energy equal to @xmath10 , a thin peak that evolves with the external perturbation , which grows in intensity and becomes narrower due to the break of the degeneracy of the interface state pinned at this energy level when the potential strength increase .",
    "we have calculated the dos and conductance of heterostructures formed by armchair gnrs .",
    "we analyzed their electronic properties when a weak external potential is applied on the edges atoms of the central ribbon structure .",
    "we found the presence of interface states and bound states in the continuum .",
    "this corresponds to the formation of collective states by the coupling of individual states and the interference among the intersection region .",
