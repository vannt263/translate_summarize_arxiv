    "red giants with @xmath1 are known to experience extra - mixing in their convectively stable radiative zones that separate the hydrogen burning shell ( hbs ) from the bottom of the convective envelope ( bce ) .",
    "it operates during their first ascent along the red giant branch ( rgb ) above the bump luminosity , after the hbs has crossed a chemical composition discontinuity left behind by the bce at the end of the first dredge - up .",
    "this causes the atmospheric @xmath2c/@xmath3c ratio and carbon abundance to resume their declines with an increase in luminosity .",
    "the most promising physical mechanism of rgb extra - mixing is thermohaline convection ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is driven by a double - diffusive instability that occurs when a scalar component that stabilizes a density stratification , e.g. the temperature @xmath4 , diffuses away faster than a destabilizing component , e.g. the mean molecular weight @xmath5 .",
    "@xcite brought our attention to the fact that the reaction @xmath0he(@xmath0he,2p)@xmath6he produces a local depression of @xmath5 , @xmath7 , in the hbs tail above the bump luminosity . as a result , @xmath5 is increasing with the radius , which turns the @xmath5 profile into the destabilizing component .",
    "moreover , the radiative thermal diffusivity @xmath8 exceeds the molecular diffusivity @xmath9 by many orders of magnitude ( the inverse lewis number @xmath10 in the region of @xmath5 depression ) , which should lead to the double - diffusive instability . in the ocean , a similar instability develops where warm salty water overlies cold fresh water .",
    "the oceanic thermohaline mixing usually takes the form of vertically elongated fluid parcels of rising fresh and sinking salty water adjacent to each other , called `` salt fingers '' ( @xcite ) .",
    "it has extensively been studied both experimentally and theoretically ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the efficiency of thermohaline mixing in stellar cases can be estimated only theoretically , e.g. via a linear stability analysis of its governing equations ( @xcite ) or via direct numerical simulations .",
    "denissenkov ( 2010 , hereafter paper  i ) has recently conducted a comparative study of thermohaline convection in the oceanic and rgb cases using both a linear stability analysis and 2d numerical simulations .",
    "unfortunately , the linear theory yields a thermohaline diffusion coefficient that is proportional to the square of the ( unknown ) aspect ratio , @xmath11 , of a finger , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the finger s length and diameter .",
    "applications of this diffusion coefficient to model the evolutionary decline of carbon abundance in low - mass red giants demand that @xmath14 ( paper  i ) , which is in agreement with the original result of @xcite .",
    "however , our 2d numerical simulations of @xmath0he - driven thermohaline convection in the vicinity of a @xmath5 depression yield a mixing rate equivalent to that approximated by the linear - theory diffusion coefficient with @xmath15 , i.e. it is a factor of @xmath16 of its observationally constrained value .",
    "the difference in the finger aspect ratios between the oceanic ( @xmath17 ) and rgb ( @xmath15 ) cases is most likely determined by the very low viscosity @xmath18 , or the prandtl number @xmath19 , in the rgb case .",
    "this facilitates the development of secondary shear instabilities that strongly limit the growth of salt fingers ( @xcite , and paper  i ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the diffusion coefficient for thermohaline convection with @xmath14 has been shown to reproduce many of the rgb extra - mixing observational patterns at all metallicities so well that we had to postpone further discussion of these findings until we were able to confirm or refute the results of our 2d numerical simulations using 3d computations .    in this letter , we present first results of our 3d numerical simulations of thermohaline convection for the oceanic and rgb cases .",
    "it turns out that they do not differ much from the 2d results reported in paper  i. we also consider a possibility , mentioned in paper  i , that rgb thermohaline mixing may be enhanced by large - scale mean - field instabilities , such as the collective , @xmath20- , and intrusive ones , that are known to occur in the ocean .",
    "finally , we speculate on possible alternative solutions of the problem of rgb extra - mixing .",
    "the basic equations and numerical techniques that are employed in our 3d simulations of thermohaline convection for the oceanic and rgb cases are described in detail by @xcite .",
    "they are very similar to those used in paper  i. the main goal of gargett et al . was to study differential scalar diffusion in 3d stratified turbulence .",
    "therefore , they considered a density stratification stable against the double - diffusive instability and used a specified turbulent velocity field as an initial condition . to apply their method and computer code for our purposes",
    ", we have made the slower diffusing component , which represents salinity @xmath21 in the ocean and @xmath5 in the current investigation , destabilizing by changing the sign of the vertical velocity term in their equation ( 16 ) .",
    "we have also reduced the amplitude of the initial velocity field , so that it serves as a mild perturbation to initiate the double - diffusive instability .",
    "our available computational resources have allowed us to run the code within reasonable time intervals with a spatial resolution of @xmath22 .",
    "simple estimates of the relevant turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate and the kolmogorov and batchelor length scales show that this resolution is close to marginal for our runs , however , not fully resolving the slower - diffusing component has been shown not to have a large effect on the computed fluxes ( @xcite ) .",
    "the 3d simulations have been carried out for the same number of fastest growing fingers in the computational domain and parameter sets from table  1 in paper  i that were used in our 2d computations .    the blue and red solid curves in the upper left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] show transitions of the ratio @xmath23 to its equilibrium values in our 2d and 3d simulations of the oceanic thermohaline convection . here ,",
    "@xmath24 and @xmath25 are the turbulent salt and microscopic thermal diffusivities .",
    "the 2d simulations were performed with the resolution @xmath26 ( paper  i ) .",
    "our estimated 3d equilibrium value of @xmath23 exceeds its corresponding 2d value merely by a factor of 1.5 ( compare the blue and red dashed lines ) .",
    "it is in good agreement with the result obtained using a better resolution by @xcite that we have interpolated for the value of density ratio @xmath27 ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the coefficients of thermal expansion and haline contraction ) from their table  1 ( star symbol ) .",
    "the upper right panel makes a similar comparison for the rgb thermohaline convection . in this case",
    ", we do not find any difference between the 2d and 3d equilibrium values of the ratio @xmath30 ( the blue and red dashed lines coincide ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that our results reported in paper  i seem to be correct .",
    "in particular , rgb thermohaline convection driven by @xmath0he burning yields a turbulent mixing rate that is by a factor of 50 lower than the value required by observations .",
    "observations , laboratory experiments , and direct numerical simulations show that small - scale salt - fingering convection in the ocean can lead to instabilities and the formation of dynamical structures on much larger scales .",
    "these include the so - called `` collective instability '' leading to the generation of internal gravity waves , the intrusive instability developing when fluid is stratified both vertically and horizontally ( in stars , such a situation may result from the rotational distortion of level surfaces ) , and the so - called `` @xmath20-instability '' that produces thermohaline staircases ( e.g. , see @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "the latter structures consist of thick well - mixed convective layers separated by thin salt - fingering interfaces .",
    "the staircases are of special interest to us because they have been observed to enhance vertical mixing in the ocean by up to an order of magnitude ( @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , our preliminary estimates in paper  i indicate that the turbulent flux ratio @xmath31 is a decreasing function of @xmath32 in the rgb case , which is a sufficient condition for the @xmath20-instability , according to @xcite .",
    "the large - scale instabilities are studied by averaging the boussinesq and advection - diffusion equations for @xmath4 and @xmath21 ( @xmath5 ) over length and time scales of many salt fingers . as a result",
    ", a system of mean - field equations is obtained in which the small - scale turbulent velocity is incorporated into the mean heat and salinity fluxes @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the fluxes are related to one another and to the large - scale temperature gradient via the flux ratio @xmath35 and the nusselt number @xmath36 , which are assumed to depend only on the local value of the density ratio @xmath32 ; specification of these dependences closes the mean - field equations .",
    "large - scale changes in @xmath32 thus result in modulations of @xmath33 and @xmath34 via the dependences of @xmath20 and @xmath36 on @xmath32 that can either amplify or damp initial perturbations .",
    "a linear stability analysis of the mean - field equations yields a third - order dispersion relationship for the growth rates of all the three large - scale instabilities mentioned above ( equation 2.13 of @xcite ) .",
    "coefficients of the cubic equation depend on the prandtl and inverse lewis numbers as well as on @xmath36 , @xmath20 and their derivatives with respect to @xmath32 .",
    "the coefficients are also functions of the horizontal and vertical wavenumbers , @xmath12 and @xmath37 . to calculate them",
    ", we first need to estimate the dependences of @xmath36 and @xmath20 on @xmath32 .",
    "@xcite estimated those dependences via a body of 3d numerical simulations of the oceanic salt - fingering convection .",
    "we have used data from their table  2 to reproduce , for a comparison , their `` flower plot '' depicting the growth rates of fastest growing instabilities at @xmath38 in the absence of lateral gradients ( the lower left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] ) .",
    "the bulb of the flower corresponds to the salt - fingering mode that turns out to be a solution of the general dispersion equation as well .",
    "the leaves of the flower represent the gravity waves of the collective instability , whereas the @xmath20-instability modes are the ones dominating in the region beneath the leaves . to obtain estimates of @xmath39 and @xmath40 for the rgb case ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f2 ] ) , we have performed additional 2d numerical simulations of the @xmath0he - driven thermohaline convection for the same parameter set that was used in paper  i but for a number of different values of @xmath32 . the resulting flower plot is shown in the lower right panel of fig .  [ fig : f1 ] .",
    "we see that in the rgb case only the salt - fingering mode is unstable in spite of the flux ratio @xmath20 being a decreasing function of @xmath32 , as in the oceanic case .",
    "this difference is explained by the fact that the nusselt number is extremely small , @xmath41 , in the rgb case .",
    "because of this , it is necessary to include horizontal diffusive fluxes in the mean - field stability analysis  something which was not done by @xcite but was treated by @xcite . in the rgb case , the inclusion of reasonable lateral gradients proportional to their corresponding vertical gradients multiplied by the ratio of centrifugal to gravitational acceleration only produces an asymmetry of the bulb with respect to the vertical axis .",
    "our 2d and 3d numerical simulations of thermohaline convection driven by @xmath0he burning have demonstrated that it is unlikely to be the sole mechanism of rgb extra - mixing .",
    "its corresponding mixing rate in the vicinity of a @xmath5 depression , @xmath42 ( the upper right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] ) , is too low compared to the observationally constrained value of @xmath43 ( paper  i ) .",
    "therefore , for its efficiency to be consistent with observations , the rgb thermohaline mixing has to be either assisted or modified by other processes . in paper",
    "i , we have shown that a turbulent viscosity @xmath44 exceeding the microscopic one by a factor of @xmath45 could enhance the rate of @xmath0he - driven thermohaline mixing up to the observed value , provided that it was not itself associated with strong turbulent mixing .",
    "the enhancement of thermohaline mixing in this case is caused by the fact that the higher viscosity suppresses the development of secondary shear instabilities that limit the growth of salt fingers .",
    "on the other hand , if the increase of viscosity is accompanied by a similar increase of the rate of turbulent mixing , the latter will reduce salt - finger buoyancy and vertical transports by smoothing out the chemical composition contrast between rising and sinking fluid parcels .",
    "the additional source of turbulence in the radiative zones of rgb stars could arise from the differential rotation that is produced by the mass inflow that feeds the hbs ( paper  i ) .",
    "we have employed the comsol multiphysics software package to solve the angular momentum transport equation for the radiative zone of the low - metallicity bump - luminosity rgb model from paper  i in the presence of mass inflow and turbulent shear mixing .",
    "their respective rate @xmath46 and diffusion coefficient @xmath47 are given by equation ( 23 ) from paper  i and equation ( 3 ) with the uncertainty factor @xmath48 from the paper of @xcite .",
    "the angular velocity at the bce was assumed to have the same value , @xmath49 rads@xmath50 , as in the m2 bump - luminosity rgb model of @xcite .",
    "simple estimates show that for @xmath51 the transport of angular momentum by the rotation - induced turbulent diffusion dominates over its advection by meridional circulation , therefore , and for the sake of simplicity , the latter was neglected .",
    "our computations show that the competition between the terms proportional to @xmath46 and @xmath47 leads to a stationary solution with @xmath52 in the vicinity of a @xmath5 depression that very weakly depends on both @xmath48 and @xmath53 , although the final rotational shear is a decreasing function of @xmath48 .",
    "this value exceeds the microscopic viscosity by a factor of @xmath54 , which is not enough to enhance @xmath55 to its observed value ( paper  i ) .",
    "it is also difficult to understand why the rotation - induced small - scale turbulence should not produce a mixing rate of the same magnitude as @xmath47 , in which case @xmath55 will not be enhanced at all ( paper  i ) .",
    "therefore , we do not think that the proposed viscosity enhancement is a possible solution of the problem .",
    "our angular momentum transport computations confirm the conclusion that radiative zones of low - mass rgb stars above the bump luminosity should possess strong differential rotation .",
    "this may lead to the generation of high - amplitude toroidal magnetic fields , especially close to the hbs , provided that a weak poloidal field is present in the radiative zone . under these circumstances ,",
    "a possible alternative solution of the problem could be magneto - thermohaline mixing ( @xcite ) .",
    "we intend to investigate this possibility using 2d numerical simulations in one of our forthcoming papers .",
    "toroidal magnetic fields in radiative zones may also filter out salt fingers with small diameters , so that the maximum growth rate is shifted towards thicker fingers . since the finger growth rate decreases with an increase in diameter as @xmath56 ( e.g. , paper  i ) , the square of the vertical velocity shear between the axes of neighbouring rising and sinking fingers , @xmath57 ,",
    "is proportional to @xmath58 .",
    "this parameter is likely to control the development of secondary shear instabilities ( @xcite ) ; consequently , thicker fingers will probably reach higher aspect ratios before they are destroyed .",
    "following @xcite , we have complemented the dispersion relationship ( 13 ) from paper  i ( note that the term @xmath59 was erroneously omitted ) with terms that take into account the lorentz force associated with a specified toroidal magnetic field @xmath60 .",
    "its solutions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : f3 ] for the field strengths @xmath61 , 10 , and 100 g ( the solid blue curves from left to right ) . in the case of @xmath62 g",
    ", the fastest growing fingers transverse to the field have a diameter that is nearly 40 times as large as that of fingers in the absence of a magnetic field .",
    "this diameter is also almost four times larger than the diameter of fastest growing fingers in the case of a viscosity that is amplified by the factor of @xmath45 ( the red solid curve ) .",
    "however the influence of such a field on the planform of the fastest growing fingers still needs to be studied . in our next study",
    ", we will perform 2d numerical simulations of the rgb thermohaline convection in the presence of a toroidal magnetic field to find out if the magnetic shift of the salt - finger growth - rate spectrum towards larger diameters can really enhance its associated mixing rate up to the empirically constrained value ."
