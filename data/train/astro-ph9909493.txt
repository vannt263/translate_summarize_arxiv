    "in hierarchical scenarios of galaxy formation ( white & rees 1978 ) , dwarfs would be the first galaxies to be formed , from small - amplitude density fluctuations and would latter on merge to form larger galaxies and structures .",
    "the fact that the gas - poor , des are usually found in denser parts of the universe than the gas - rich dirrs may indicate that both have the same origin , the former being in a more evolved evolutionary stage and in the process of being soon incorporated into bigger neighboring galaxies . if this were the case , isolated dirrs like ddo 187 should still have the traces of their formation process and early evolution and , eventually , a similar underlying structure to that of the less distorted des .",
    "it is hence of major relevance to study the structure , kinematics and spatial distribution of stellar populations , including the oldest ones , of these small , gas rich galaxies , checking in particular whether they have old / young subsystems similar to the halo / disk ones of spirals or any other structures that would trace their formation scenario .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to test the hypothesis of the existence of a two - component , halo / disk structure in the field dirr galaxy ddo 187 .",
    "ddo 187 ( ugc 9128 ) is a resolved , gas - rich dwarf galaxy first cataloged by van den bergh ( 1959 ) .",
    "it shows a morphology typical of dirr galaxies , with the bluest stellar population lying on one - half of its body , and has been subject of several works directed toward the study of its distance , stellar content , neutral gas , and chemical abundances .",

    "bias and flat - field corrections were done with iraf .",
    "then , daophot and allstar ( stetson 1994 ) were used to obtain the instrumental photometry of the stars .",
    "eighteen standard stars from the list of landolt ( 1992 ) were measured during the observing run to calculate the atmospheric extinctions for each night and the equations transforming into the johnson ",

    "the @xmath22 values are the dispersions of the fits at the centers of mass of the point distributions ; hence they are the minimum internal zero - point errors .",
    "dispersions of the extinctions for each night vary from @xmath23 to @xmath24 and dispersions of the aperture corrections are of the order of 0.04 . putting all these values together",

    ", they do not reproduce the external errors of the photometry , coming mainly from stellar crowding and blending ( see aparicio , & gallart 1995 and gallart , aparicio , & vlchez 1996a ) , but they provide with an indication of the internal accuracy of the photometry . in this sense ,",
    "our average allstar errors are 0.01 , 0.04 and 0.16 for @xmath25 , 22 and 24 respectively and for @xmath26 , 23.3 and 25.4 , respectively .",

    "a well populated blue - plume is also visible at @xmath29 , @xmath30 . formed by intermediate to massive stars in the ms and/or the core he - burning blue - loop phases , it is the trace of significant recent star formation , in good agreement with the presence of h  ii regions in the galaxy . at least some of the red stars in the region @xmath31 , @xmath32 are likely agb stars forming a _ red - tail _ structure of the kind discussed by aparicio & gallart ( 1994 ) .",

    "they identified two stars in the galaxy as very likely cepheids and three more as possible cepheids . using them ,",
    "they determine a distance of @xmath11 mpc .",
    "this distance implies that the trgb of ddo 187 should be fainter than @xmath34 , and hence difficult to reach by usual ground - based telescopes .",
    "however , this seems not to be the case in the light of the cmd shown in figure [ cmd ] .",
    "an independent estimate of the distance to ddo 187 can be made using the magnitude of the trgb and the relationships of lee , freedman , & madore ( 1993 ) .",
    "we have determined the magnitude of the trgb from the cmd of fig .",
    "[ cmd ] , applying a sobel filter to the luminosity function ( lf ) of stars with colors in the interval @xmath35 , and obtained @xmath36 .",
    "the error has been estimated from the width of the peak produced by the sobel filter around the trgb .",
    "several binning sizes and initial values for the lf were used , the former result being the average of all them .",
    "crowding , blending and other observational effects modify the measured star magnitudes in the sense that , in average , they appear brighter than they are ( see a discussion of this in aparicio , & gallart 1995 and gallart et al .",
    "this would eventually affect the magnitude of the trgb . to check this effect and for the analysis of the stellar populations presented in section 6",
    ", we have performed crowding tests using artificial stars in the way described by stetson ( 1994 ) .",
    "we have added 1190 artificial stars to our images with initial magnitude and color @xmath37 , @xmath38 , roughly corresponding to the position of the trgb .",
    "90% of them were recovered , their average magnitude and color being @xmath39 and @xmath40 , showing that shifts produced by observational effects are negligible at the position of the trgb .    the extinction towards ddo 187 can be estimated to be @xmath41 ( burstein & heiles 1982 ) .",
    "this can be neglected and hence the former value for @xmath36 can be assumed to be free of extinction and observational effects .    to apply the relationships of lee _ et al . _",
    "( 1993 ) , the metallicity of the stars and the bolometric correction ( bc ) at the trgb are necessary . both can be estimated from the color indices of rgb stars . @xmath42 and @xmath43",
    "have been obtained as the median of the color indices of stars with @xmath44 and @xmath45 respectively and having colors in the interval @xmath46 .",
    "some 35 stars have been used in each case and the quoted errors have been simply obtained as @xmath47 for each sample . from @xmath48 , an average metallicity of [ fe / h ] @xmath49",
    "is found using the calibration by lee _",

    "( 1989 ) and by van zee _ et al . _",

    "these values can finally be introduced in the relationships of lee _ et al . _",
    "( 1993 ) to obtain the absolute magnitude of the trgb , @xmath53 , and hence a distance modulus of @xmath54 , which corresponds to a distance to the milky way of @xmath55 mpc .      to check whether ddo 187 can be considered a field galaxy ,",
    "its distance to other nearby galaxies has been computed .",
    "the selected galaxies are gr 8 , ddo 187 , andromeda , m81 , m94 and m101 , as well as the barycenter of the local group .",
    "the first two galaxies are apparently the closest dwarfs to ddo 187 .",
    "the other ones are the dominant members of the closest groups .",
    "the distances to the milky way adopted for each one are : gr 8 , 2.2 mpc ( dohm - palmer _",

    "_ 1999 ) ; andromeda , 0.77 mpc ( freedman & madore 1990 ) ; m 81 , 3.6 mpc ( freedman _ et al .",

    "the position of the barycenter of the local group has been calculated neglecting the masses of all the galaxies in the lg except andromeda and the milky way , assuming that the the mass of the milky way is 0.7 times that of andromeda ( peebles 1989 ) and adopting a value of 0.77 mpc for the milky way ",
    "andromeda distance ( freedman & madore 1990 ) .    in this way , the resulting distances of ddo 187 to each galaxy are : 0.85 mpc to gr 8 ; 1.06 mpc to ddo 190 ; 2.9 mpc to andromeda ; 3.2 mpc to m 81 ; 2.6 mpc to m 94 ; 5.2 mpc to m101 and 2.7 mpc to the barycenter of the local group . hence ddo 187 is likely a field galaxy lying between the local , m81 and m94 groups , the closest galaxy being the dirr gr 8 .",
    "all the distances are summarized in table [ neig ] .      the large disagreement between the cepheid and trgb distances merits some comment . while the cepheid p ",
    "l relationship is the best distance indicator for nearby galaxies , its reliability has been recently questioned by several authors ( aparicio 1994 ; saha _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ; tolstoy _ et al .",
    "the problem arises from the fact that , for several dwarf galaxies ( namely , pegasus , leo a and , now , ddo 187 ) , a large disagreement has been detected between cepheid based distances and trgb or red - clump ( rc ) based distances .",
    "table [ dist ] summarizes the distances found with each method for the three galaxies .",
    "column 1 gives the galaxy name ; columns 2 to 4 list the cepheid distance , the number of cepheids used to determine it and the reference ; columns 5 to 7 give the cmd - based distance , the feature ( trgb or rc ) used to estimate it and the reference .",
    "in all cases , cepheid distances were based on just a few stars showing light curves resembling those of bona - fide cepheids . however , latter accurate two - color photometry ( aparicio 1994 ; tolstoy _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) demonstrated that the colors of these stars could in no way be reconciled with those of cepheid stars , which is also stressed by saha _",
    "( 1996 ) .",
    "in the case of ddo 187 , hoessel _ et al . _",
    "( 1998 ) identified only two stars as very likely long - period cepheids and three more , with lower quality photometry , as possible cepheids .",
    "they used a control cmd for these stars but perhaps it was not deep enough for the purpose .",
    "figure [ cmd_cef ] shows our cmd with the cepheid candidates of hoessel _ et al . _",
    "( 1998 ) marked with filled dots . from their location in the diagram , these stars are likely agb stars and could well be some kind of long - period variables ( for further discussion on the presence of long - period variables in ddo 187 see hoessel et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "considering that ddo 187 is the third case in which a large distance disagreement has been found , it seems clear that cepheid distance estimates based on a few stars , as usually happens for dwarf galaxies , must be accepted with caution .",
    "possibly , only galaxies with a large young star population , like spirals or dwarfs in a phase immediately following a strong star formation burst , are adequate for a confident use of cepheid stars as distance indicators , since only in these galaxies a significant population of cepheids is expected .",
    "the analysis should ever include checking colors in a reliable cmd and a good phase coverage in order to avoid aliased periods ( see also saha _ et al .",

    "it must be kept in mind that , at the distance of ddo 187 , @xmath59 corresponds to 12 pc , so the assumption that the h  ii regions are ionized by single stars may well be an oversimplification , even for the compact ones .",
    "the total @xmath13 flux , luminosity and number of ionizing photons are given in the last line of table [ fluxes ] including also the very diffuse emission , not comprised in the regions 1 to 10 listed in the table .",
    "@xmath60 can be used to estimate the current sfr .",
    "it is given by @xmath61 where time increases from the present to the past , the present time being 0 , @xmath62 is the imf , @xmath63 is the sfr in units of number of stars per year and @xmath64 is the ms life - time of a star of mass @xmath65 and @xmath66 is the number of lyman photons emitted per second by a ms star of mass @xmath65 .",

    "all these galaxies have undergone recent star formation episodes in their centers , but lack young stars in outer regions .",
    "however the conclusion can not be drawn from this fact alone that they have two differentiated structures , the outer being an old subsystem tracing out the formation and early evolution of the galaxy .",
    "this result would not be surprising , but sufficiently accurate age distributions and structural and kinematical information are needed before confidently accepting it .",
    "interesting steps towards establishing the primeval nature of the extended structures are supplied by minniti , & zijlstra ( 1997 ) who provide with clues compatible with an old age of the extended population in wlm ( although the presence of an intermediate - age component can not be , in our opinion , excluded ) and include a morphological analysis concluding that flattening is smaller for the halo than for the inner component .",
    "a further important step forward is supplied by the finding that the only globular cluster in wlm is indeed a very old object , sharing the metallicity of the outer component field stars ( hodge _ et al .",
    ". however , wlm has also a very extended gas component ( see minniti , & zijlstra 1997 ) which , at least and in principle , would play against the formation of the extended component before the collapse of the galaxy had finished .",

    "centering our attention on ddo 187 , we will show in this section how our data , together with information about the gas distribution , could indicate that a stellar population lacking young stars would be associated with an external , diffuse , perhaps differentiated subsystem of this galaxy . on the light of these finding",

    "the innermost part of the galaxy has been excluded to avoid completeness effects .",
    "the fit yields a scale factor @xmath105 , which corresponds to 310 pc at the distance of ddo 187 . after scaling to the same distance ,",
    "this is more than twice the result obtained by patterson & thuan ( 1996 ) for the surface brightness distribution , indicating that the galaxy is larger than was previously thought .",
    "in fact , the surface brightness distribution given by patterson , & thuan ( 1996 ) for ddo 187 extends to 50  , i. e. covering only the inner body of the galaxy .",

    "the scales can be obtained making @xmath106 for the case of @xmath107 and @xmath108 for the case of @xmath109 and have been computed comparing the logarithmic number of stars in a region of @xmath110 centered on the galaxy with the integrated magnitudes of the same region .",
    "the surface brightness profile by patterson , & thuan ( 1996 ) is to be preferred for the inner region of the galaxy , the surface brightness scale of figure [ densi ] being useful for the external region .",

    "the cmd of ddo 187 is not deep enough for such a detailed analysis but it is still possible to sketch the sfh of the galaxy for old , intermediate and young ages .",
    "the galaxy has been divided into three parts for the study of the sfh as shown in figure [ mapa ] .",
    "the inner part corresponds to the optical body of the galaxy down to the holmberg radius , as determined by patterson & thuan ( 1996 , 1998 ) .",
    "the intermediate part matches the gas component as given by lo _",
    "( 1993 ) , excluding the inner component .",
    "the outer part includes the rest of the galaxy out to @xmath113 where , according to the results given above , the galaxy seems to vanish .",
    "the resolved stars have also been plotted in figure [ mapa ] .",
    "while most of the blue and many bright red stars are in the inner component , the fainter red population extends outwards and defines the ellipticity and orientation of the outer component .    in what follows",
    ", we will discuss the derivation of the sfh for each region .",
    "note that the different stellar populations will evolve kinematically in different ways and will not necessarily be found in the same region where they were born .",
    "so , properly speaking , what we are going to obtain is the distribution of stellar ages , with indication of stellar metallicities in each region . for simplicity",
    ", we will continue to term the combined distribution as sfh .",
    "we will look for differences in these distributions as a first indication of differences in the underlying structure and/or evolutionary history of the galaxy .",
    "a simplified version of the method proposed by aparicio , gallart , & bertelli ( 1997b ) and used by gallart _",
    "( 1999 ) for leo i has been employed to obtain the sfh of the three regions defined in ddo 187 . in practice , a synthetic cmd with arbitrary , constant sfr of value @xmath114 , the imf of kroupa _ et al . _",
    "( 1993 ) , 25% of binary stars with mass ratios , @xmath115 , uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath116 , and a metallicity , @xmath117 , taking random values from @xmath118 to @xmath119 independently of age have been used .",
    "the @xmath117 interval has been chosen considering the metallicities for h  ii regions given by skillman _",
    "( 1989 ) and by van zee _ et al . _",
    "( 1997a ) , the value of [ fe / h ] given in sec . 4 , and the dispersion of colors in the red - tangle .",
    "the resulting synthetic cmd has been then divided into four age intervals : 00.1 gyr , 0.10.3 gyr , 0.34 gyr , and 415 gyr . following the nomenclature introduced in aparicio _",
    "( 1997b ) , each of these synthetic diagrams will be called a _ partial model _ cmd and any linear combination of them will be denoted as _",
    "global models_. eight regions have been defined in the observed and the partial model cmds with the criterion that they sample different age intervals ( see gallart _",
    "_ 1999 and aparicio 1999 ) .",
    "the regions are shown in figure [ cmd_reg ] .",
    "we will denote by @xmath120 the number of stars of the observed cmd lying in region @xmath121 and by @xmath122 the number of stars of partial model ( age interval ) @xmath123 populating region @xmath121 . the number of stars populating a given region in a global model is then given by @xmath124 and the corresponding sfr @xmath125 where @xmath126 are the linear combination coefficients , @xmath127 is a scaling constant , and @xmath128 if @xmath129 is inside the interval corresponding to partial model @xmath123 and @xmath130 otherwise .",
    "the @xmath131 having the best compatibility with the data can be obtained by a least - squares fitting of @xmath132 to @xmath120 .    in practice",
    ", several solutions can be found showing similar departures , @xmath22 , from the data . to smooth out the bias that selecting a single good solution would introduce , several",
    "are selected and averaged to obtain the best final solution . in the case of ddo 187 ,",
    "models showing @xmath22 values smaller than 1.5 times the @xmath22 of the best solution have been used .",
    "the resulting @xmath131 for the three regions in which ddo 187 has been divided are shown in figure [ psi ] .",
    "the right - hand vertical scales are normalized to the area covered by each region .",
    "the most interesting result from the sfh analysis is that the central region shows a strong increase of @xmath131 for the last few 100 myr and that the outer region shows no star formation activity , in good agreement with what is expected from the absence of gas .",
    "this will be used below for the discussion of the structure of ddo 187 .",
    "the current sfr obtained in sec .",
    "5 from the h@xmath133 luminosity refers to the last @xmath85 20 myr .",
    "it is a factor of eight smaller than the value derived here for the last 100 myr in the central region of the galaxy , but it is similar to the sfr averaged over the entire life - time of the galaxy .",
    "this picture favors a bursting star formation mode , with the last strong burst having taken place between 20 and 100 myr ago .",
    "if this burst had lasted 10 myr , its intensity would have been of @xmath134 m@xmath8 yr@xmath6 , which is not far from the values given by fanelli , oconnel , & thuan ( 1988 ) for blue compact dwarfs .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the picture of high present - day or very recent star formation activity much higher than the average for the entire life - time of the galaxy is frequently found in galaxies classified as dirr ( ngc 6822 : gallart _ et al .",
    "_ 1996b , c ; pegasus : aparicio , gallart , & bertelli 1997a , gallagher _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ; antlia : aparicio _ et al . _",
    "1997c ) . on the other hand , galaxies like phoenix ( martnez - delgado _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) or lgs 3 ( aparicio , gallart _ et al . _",
    "1997b ) , frequently considered as dsph - dirr transition objects , show similar @xmath131 histories until a few 100 myr ago , failing only in currently producing stars at a high rate .",
    "this would also point to a bursting mode of star formation , the dsph - dirr galaxies being in a quiescent period , and would also imply that an important bias could exist in the classification of dwarfs as bona - fide dirrs towards objects experiencing strong star formation bursts .",
    "the sfr averaged for different periods of time is given in table [ sfrave ] for the three regions defined in ddo 187 .",
    "the first four lines give the sfr averaged for the whole life - time of the galaxy ( assumed to be 15 gyr ) and for the intervals 151 gyr , 10 gyr , and 0.10 gyr ago .",
    "line 5 gives the current sfr derived from the @xmath13 flux .",
    "lines 6 to 10 give the same information as lines 1 to 5 after normalization to the area of each region .      some of the results presented here are compatible with ( but not conclusive of ) a two - components , disk / halo - like structure in ddo 187 .",
    "let us assume the two - component possibility as a working hypothesis and check to what extent it could be accepted .",
    "there are three facts supporting it :    1 .",
    "the high ellipticity of the inner star forming region could be due to it being a flattened , disk - like component , different from the almost spherical , low - density , outer region .",
    "the gas component is spatially much more compact than the outer stellar one .",
    "this would be qualitatively compatible with a collapse that left behind the formed stars earlier .",
    "3 .   the external component lacks young stars , as it would be expected in an early formed structure which was later on deprived of gas .",
    "these three results combine both age and morphological properties , thereby giving more self - consistency to the two - component hypothesis .",
    "but all them are necessary rather than sufficient conditions . in particular , the sufficient conclusive conditions should be of the three following kinds :    1 .",
    "kinematical , and not only morphological , decoupling should exist between the inner and the outer components .",
    "radial velocities of the stars would be necessary to determine if this is the case , but they are beyond reach of current instruments .",
    "the gas should be associated with the inner , flat component , rather than showing a spherical distribution .",
    "it could be , however , that the sphericity of the gas originates in the heating produced by supernova explosions in the inner region .",
    "3 .   the stellar population of the outer component should be old ( older than @xmath85 10 gyr ) , the fact that young stars lack there not being enough . with the time resolution for intermediate and old ages of the analysis presented here",
    "it is not possible to accept or reject the presence of an intermediate - age population with a high confidence level .    summarizing",
    ", the two - component hypothesis does not seem unrealistic . but nothing can be definitely stated until more detailed data , ideally including kinematics , are available . by now , this is the case for other dwarfs for which differentiated components have been sought ( antlia , ngc 3109 and with stronger clues , wlm and phoenix ; see references above ) .",
    "for these , as for ddo 187 , more data are needed .",
    "the sfr @xmath131 and the new estimate of the distance obtained here have be used , together with data from other authors , to calculate the integrated properties of ddo 187 listed in table [ global ] .",
    "the bracketed figures refer to the bibliographic sources for each data . first the metallicity , @xmath117 , the distance to the milky way , @xmath135 , and the distance to the barycenter of the local group , @xmath136 , are given .",
    "integrated absolute magnitudes and luminosities , referred to the holmberg radius at @xmath137arcsec@xmath138 ( which match the inner component of the former analysis ) follow .",
    "@xmath139 is the mass in stars and stellar remnants for the whole galaxy , calculated from integration of @xmath131 and assuming that 0.8 of this integral remains locked in stellar objects .",
    "@xmath140 is obtained by multiplying the h  i mass by 4/3 to take into account the mass in he .",
    "@xmath141 is the virial mass obtained from the velocity dispersion of the gas .",
    "@xmath142 is the gas fraction , relative to the total mass intervening in the chemical evolution .",
    "@xmath143 is the dark matter fraction , calculated as indicated in the table .",
    "finally , the gas and total mass to luminosity fractions are given .",
    "the hypothesis that dwarf star forming galaxies could have extended , primeval structures is tested for the dirr ddo 187 .",
    "together with the sfh and the structure of ddo 187 , this paper provides a new estimate of the distance and discusses the distribution of h  ii regions .    from the @xmath0 magnitude of the tip of the red giant branch ( @xmath144 ) , the distance of ddo 187 to the milky way is estimated to be @xmath2 mpc .",
    "the distance to several neighbor galaxies and groups have been computed , showing that it is an isolated , field galaxy : ddo 187 is at 2.6 mpc from m 94 ; at 2.7 mpc from the barycenter of the local group , and at 3.2 mpc from m 81 ; the closest dwarf galaxies to ddo 187 are gr 8 , at 0.85 mpc and ddo 190 , at 1.05 mpc .",
    "the distance of ddo 187 to the milky way ( 2.5 mpc ) found here is quite different from the value of 7 mpc , estimated from cepheid light - curves by hoessel et al .",
    "this is the third case ( pegasus , and leo a are the other two ) in which such a large disagreement is obtained between the two methods and implies that cepheid - based distances of dwarf galaxies must be accepted cautiously .",
    "we suggest that the scarcity of cepheids in dwarf galaxies , derived from the small amount of young stars , would not make worthwhile the effort of determining their distance with cepheids .",
    "ddo 187 has several h  ii regions . from analysis of their fluxes",
    ", it is found that the most massive star alive in the galaxy has a mass of some 30 m@xmath8 and that the current sfr is smaller by a factor of 3 than it was 20100 myr ago .",
    "the sfh of ddo 187 has been obtained using synthetic cmds .",
    "ddo 187 shows an overall decreasing sfr , but with high star formation activity over the last few hundred myr in its central region .",
    "the sfr for different regions of the galaxy are summarized in table [ sfrave ] . in particular , the data analyzed here are compatible with a maximum in the sfr between 20 and 100 myr ago that could have had an intensity comparable to that of some blue compact galaxies .",
    "interestingly , this picture of an overall decreasing sfr with a strong enhancement in the recent past is common to other dirr galaxies .",
    "it is suggested that perhaps the dirr morphology is only produced by the recent past sfr activity and that no large intrinsic differences exist between typical dirrs and other dwarf galaxies showing similar intermediate- to old - age sfhs but neither h  ii regions nor other traces of very recent star formation activity .",
    "several results suggest that ddo 187 has a two - component halo / disk - like structure : ( i ) differentiated morphologies for the inner and outer stellar components ; ( ii ) a gas component less extended than the outer stellar component , and ( iii ) an outer component lacking young stars .",
    "the working hypothesis that a real halo / disk structure could be present is discussed .",
    "the conclusion is reached that the two - components hypothesis is not unrealistic , but that nothing can be clearly stated until more detailed data , ideally including kinematics , are available .",
    "this paper has been largely improved after careful reading of the manuscript by carme gallart and david martnez - delgado and after the endless , fruitful discussions maintained with them .",
