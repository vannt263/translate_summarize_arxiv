    "the maximal dynamical speed of quantum system is a fundamental concept in many areas of quantum physics , such as quantum communication com - prl , com - nature , quantum metrology @xcite , optimal control @xcite , etc .",
    "the quantum speed limit ( qsl ) , defined as the minimal evolution time between two states was first introduced by anandan - aharonov using the fubini - study metric @xcite .",
    "later , the unified qsl is given for closed systems subject to the unitary evolution , by the combining the conclusion of the variance of the energy , i.e. , mandelstam - tamm bound ( mt - qsl ) @xcite and the average of the energy , i.e. , margolus - levitin bound ( ml - qsl ) @xcite , which is rigorously described by @xmath0 .",
    "the qsl bound for the driven system @xcite , and for the mixed quantum state evolution@xcite were also investigated . in reality",
    ", the system interacts with the its environment inevitably , so the theories of open quantum systems are usually employed @xcite .",
    "recently , the qsl for open system ( nonunitary evolution ) has attracted intensive interests , such as characterizing qsl for open system using quantum fisher information qslfisher , relative purity @xcite , bures angle @xcite , and so on @xcite .",
    "the works @xcite also apply to non - markovian dynamics . in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors extended the ml - qsl from closed system to open system using the technology of the von neuamnn trace inequality @xcite and operator norm horn , and showed that the non - markovian effects @xcite can speed up the quantum evolution and the ml - qsl is tight for the open system . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors showed that the mechanism of the acceleration in open systems is determined not only by the non - markovianity but also by the population of excited states during the quantum evolution .    in this paper , we find that the initial - state dependence is also a key factor to the acceleration of quantum evolution .",
    "in particular , the predications for the acceleration of quantum evolution based on different qsls could be quite inconsistent . here",
    "we first define a tight bound for the quantum speed limit without using the von neumann trace inequality ( we denote it by ni - qsl ) .",
    "then we use the ml - qsl and the ni - qsl to investigate the damped jaynes - cumming ( j - c ) model with a superposition state as the initial state and the dephasing model .",
    "it is found that neither the non - markovianity nor the population of the initial excited state is competent for the acceleration of quantum evolution , but the different initial states bring great effects .",
    "in addition , the ml - qsl and the ni - qsl sometimes produce contradictory predictions on the evolution acceleration , even though they are consistent in some particular cases .",
    "this implies that the qsl could need us further consideration and investigation .",

    "[ spintu2 ] .",
    "since the opposite prediction on the evolution acceleration has been analyzed by the two layers , it is also implied that the ni - qsl and the ml - qsl demonstrate contradictory predictions .",
