    "the most precise results in this case come from measurements of the production cross - section near threshold in the reactions @xmath11",
    "@xcite and in @xmath12  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we present new measurements of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 masses using decays to 3@xmath2 ( @xmath13 ) , with the na48 experiment at the cern sps .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : the first section describes the method used for the reconstruction of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 masses ; the second section shows the experimental setup ; details of the performances of the electromagnetic calorimeter are given in the third section ; results and cross - checks with a detailed evaluation of the systematic effects are presented in the fourth section .",
    "this measurement uses @xmath0 and @xmath14 particles with average energies of @xmath15 110 gev .",
    "photons from 3@xmath2 decays are detected with a precise quasi - homogeneous liquid krypton calorimeter .",
    "this device allows photon energies as well as impact positions in the plane orthogonal to the @xmath0 and @xmath14 momentum to be measured accurately .",
    "although photon angles are not measured directly with the calorimeter , the decay position can be inferred from two photons coming from a @xmath2 decay using the @xmath2 mass constraint . in the limit of small opening angles ( valid to better than @xmath16 for this experiment )",

    "can then be computed as @xmath25    the advantages of using this method for the mass measurement are the following :    * the 3@xmath2 decay mode is virtually background free .",
    "* thanks to the @xmath2 mass constraint , the resolution on @xmath26 is better than 1 mev / c@xmath4 . *",
    "the measurement of @xmath26 is independent of the energy scale of the calorimeter .",
    "indeed , the measured quantity is the ratio of the @xmath0 ( or @xmath1 ) mass to the @xmath2 mass , in which the absolute energy scale completely cancels .",
    "for the same reason , the absolute transverse size scale also cancels . *",
    "the measurement is only sensitive to residual non - linearities in the energy or position measurements . to minimise the sensitivity to energy non - linearities ,",
    "only symmetric decays are used , in which the photons all have about the same energy . indeed for perfectly symmetric decay",
    ", the sensitivity to energy non - linearities also cancels . *",
    "the same method can be applied to both the @xmath0 and the @xmath14 cases .",
    "the very large statistics available in the @xmath14 sample allows many systematic cross - checks to be performed to validate the measurement .",
    "the mass measurement relies only on measurements of relative distance between photons and ratio of energies with the calorimeter .",
    "furthermore the performance of this device can be studied in detail in situ using @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) decays , and @xmath2 and @xmath0 decays to two photons , which are present with very large statistics in the data samples .",

    "masses are described .",
    "the neutral @xmath14 beam  @xcite is derived from 450  gev / c protons extracted from the cern sps . for each sps pulse",
    "( 2.4  s spill every 14.4  s ) , @xmath29 protons hit a 40  cm long beryllium target , with an incidence angle of 2.4  mrad .",
    "the charged component of the outgoing particles is swept away by bending magnets .",
    "a neutral secondary beam with a @xmath300.15  mrad divergence is generated using three stages of collimation over 126  m , the final element being located just upstream of the beginning of the decay region . because of the long distance between the target and the beginning of the decay region , the decays in this neutral beam are dominated by @xmath14 .",
    "the decay region is contained in an evacuated ( @xmath31 @xmath32  mbar ) 90  m long tank . during the 1999 data taking , this decay region was terminated by a polyimide ( kevlar ) composite window 0.9  mm ( 0.003  radiation lengths ) thick .",
    "downstream of it a 16  cm diameter evacuated tube passes through all detector elements to allow the undecayed neutral beam to travel in vacuum all the way to a beam dump . in the normal @xmath6 data taking , a @xmath33 beam is also created using a second target closer to the decay region .",
    "the beam from which the decays originate is identified by tagging the protons directed to the @xmath33 target .      during special data taking periods ,",
    "a beam of negatively charged secondary particles is , by a suitable choice of the magnets in the beam line , directed along the nominal @xmath14 beam axis .",
    "this beam consists mostly of @xmath34 with a broad momentum spectrum of average energy@xmath35  gev , and with a flux of @xmath36 per pulse .",
    "it impinges on two thin polyethylene targets ( 2.0  cm thick ) , separated by 1462  cm , near the beginning and towards the end of the fiducial kaon decay region . through charge exchange reactions , @xmath2 and @xmath0",

    "neutral kaon are also produced in the targets , mostly from @xmath37 interactions .",
    "the layout of the detector is shown in figure  [ fig : detector.eps ] .",
    "a magnetic spectrometer  @xcite , housed in a helium tank , is used to measure charged particles .",
    "it is comprised of four drift chambers and a dipole magnet , located between the second and the third drift chambers , giving a horizontal transverse momentum kick of 265 mev / c .",
    "the momentum resolution is @xmath38 ( @xmath39 in gev / c ) , where @xmath40 means that the contributions should be added in quadrature .",
    "two plastic scintillator hodoscope planes are placed after the helium tank .    a quasi - homogeneous liquid krypton electromagnetic calorimeter ( lkr )",
    "is used to measure photon and electron showers .",
    "it consists of @xmath1510  m@xmath41 of liquid krypton with a total thickness of 127  cm ( @xmath15 27  radiation lengths ) and an octagonal shaped cross - section of @xmath155.5  m@xmath4 .",
    "the entrance face of the calorimeter is located 11501  cm from the beginning of the decay region and 11455  cm from the location of the first @xmath0 target .",
    "immersed in the krypton are electrodes made with cu - be - co ribbons of cross - section @xmath42m@xmath43mm@xmath44 cm , extending between the front and the back of the detector .",
    "the ribbons are guided through precisely machined slots in five spacer plates located longitudinally every 21  cm which ensure the gap width stability in the shape of a @xmath30  48  mrad accordion .",
    "the 13212 readout cells each have a cross - section of 2@xmath452  cm@xmath4 at the back of the active region , and consist ( along the horizontal direction ) of a central anode at a 3 kv high voltage in the middle of two cathodes kept at ground .",
    "the cell structure is projective towards the middle of the decay region , 110  m upstream of the calorimeter , so that the measurement of photon positions is insensitive to first order to the initial conversion depth .",
    "the initial current induced on the electrodes by the drift of the ionization is measured using pulse shapers with 80  ns fwmh and digitised with 40  mhz 10-bits fadcs  @xcite .",
    "the dynamic range is increased by employing four gain - switching amplifiers which change the amplification factor depending on the pulse height .",

    "the total output of the calorimetric information is restricted to cells belonging to a region around the most energetic cells , by a `` zero - suppression '' algorithm . for each event ,",
    "the information from 10 digitised time samples ( 250  ns ) is read out .",
    "an iron - scintillator hadron calorimeter is located downstream of the lkr , followed by a muon veto system .",

    "based on these projections , the total deposited energy , the energy - weighted centre of gravity of the event and the estimated decay vertex position along the beam axis are computed .    to select @xmath50 decays , the total energy is required to be more than 50 gev , the radial position of the centre of gravity to be less than 15  cm from the beam axis and the decay vertex position to be less than 9 @xmath33-lifetimes away from the beginning of the decay region .",
    "to select @xmath2 and @xmath0 decays in the @xmath0 runs , a cut on the total energy is applied .",
    "events with energy above 90 gev are taken without downscaling , events with energy between 40 and 90 gev are downscaled by a factor 10 or 12 depending on the run period , and events with energy between 15 and 40 gev are downscaled by a factor 4 to 6 .    during the @xmath6 run in 1998 and 1999 ,",
    "large statistics of @xmath27 decays were collected to study the calorimeter performance . in the year 2000 , the detector operated with vacuum in place of the spectrometer . during this period ,",
    "data with only the @xmath14 beam were recorded , as well as data with an @xmath0 beam .",

    "the shower position is derived from the energy - weighted centre of gravity of the 3@xmath453 central cells , corrected for the residual bias of this estimator .",
    "shower energies are corrected for the following effects : small ( @xmath31 1% ) variations of the energy measurement depending on the impact point within the cell , energy lost outside the calorimeter boundaries , energy lost in non - working cells ( about 0.4% of the channels ) , average energy lost in the material before the calorimeter ( 15  mev for photons , 45  mev for electrons ) , a small bias from the zero - suppression algorithm for energies below 5 gev and small space charge effects from the accumulation of positive ions in the gap  @xcite which is significant only in the case of data taken with the high intensity @xmath14 beam .",
    "energy leakage from one shower to another is corrected in the reconstruction using the transverse shower profile from a geant  @xcite simulation .",
    "special runs in which a monochromatic electron beam is sent into the calorimeter , taken without zero suppression , are used to check this modelling and to derive a small correction .",
    "fiducial cuts are applied to ensure that shower energies are well measured .",
    "these cuts include the removal of events with a shower too close to the inner beam tube or the outer edges of the lkr or falling within 2  cm of a non - working cell .",

    "the comparison of the electron momentum measured by the magnetic spectrometer ( @xmath39 ) and the energy measured by the lkr ( @xmath52 ) allows the performance of the calorimeter to be studied in detail , the resolution on the ratio @xmath53 being @xmath15 1% .",
    "the @xmath27 sample is first used to study and improve the cell - to - cell intercalibration of the calorimeter .",

    "electrons from @xmath27 in the energy range 25 - 40 gev ( to avoid possible correlations between non - uniformity and non - linearity ) are used to equalise the cell - to - cell energy response , requiring @xmath53 to be the same for all cells .",

    "the position resolution of the calorimeter is better than 1.3  mm above 20 gev .",
    "using the large sample of @xmath2 decays to two photons produced during the @xmath0 runs , the systematic effects in the calorimeter measurement can be estimated . from the known target positions , the @xmath2 mass can be reconstructed from the measured photon energies and positions at the lkr .",

    "the agreement obtained is particularly significant because we have found that the effect of the dominant systematic uncertainty , which originates from energy leakage effects , is actually anticorrelated between the 2@xmath2 and the 3@xmath2 samples . as an alternative to using symmetric decays for the @xmath1 mass measurement ,",
    "events have been selected by an algorithm which requires minimum sensitivity to energy non - linearities .",
    "this gives a higher statistics sample , spanning a wider range of energies , and the @xmath1 mass measurement agrees to better than 10  kev / c@xmath4 .    relaxing the cut on the symmetry of the decay and asking @xmath73  @xmath83  6  gev and at least 25  cm separation between photons , the reconstructed masses move by -9  kev / c@xmath4 for the @xmath0 and -10  kev / c@xmath4 for the @xmath1 , while the total systematic error is increased by almost a factor two because of the much stronger sensitivity to energy non - linearities .",

    ", the dominant uncertainty is the systematic uncertainty on the correction of energy leakage from one cluster to the other . in case ( b ) , it is the systematic uncertainty associated with energy non - linearity .",
    "these measurements suffer from larger sensitivities to systematic effects than the one using 3@xmath2 decays , but within the uncertainties , there is good agreement between the results , thus giving a further cross - check that systematic effects are under control .",
    "from the 3@xmath2 symmetric decay configuration , the following mass values are obtained : @xmath93 @xmath94    the @xmath1 mass is consistent with the present world average within 1.1 standard deviations , with a similar uncertainty . the uncertainty on the @xmath0 mass is about 2.4 times smaller than the current world average uncertainty , while the eta mass differs from the world average by about 0.1% , corresponding to 4.2 standard deviations .",
