    "extra gauge bosons , including @xmath4 s and @xmath6 s , are a feature of many models of physics beyond the sm @xcite . examples of such models are grand unified theories based on groups such as @xmath7 or @xmath8 @xcite , left - right symmetric models @xcite , little higgs models @xcite , and technicolour models @xcite to name a few . in addition , resonances that arise as kaluza - klein excitations in theories of finite size extra dimensions @xcite would also appear as new gauge bosons in high energy experiments .",
    "it is therefore quite possible that the discovery of a new gauge boson could be one of the first pieces of evidence for physics beyond the sm .",
    "evidence for extra gauge bosons can take two forms : either from direct production , or indirectly via deviations from standard model predictions .",
    "the first approach is limited by the kinematic reach of direct production at hadron colliders or @xmath9 colliders .",
    "however , given that the current direct limits of @xmath4 s are @xmath10  tev , it is clear that @xmath4 s will not be produced directly at any of the high energy lepton colliders envisaged for the foreseeable future .",
    "currently , the highest mass bounds on most extra neutral gauge bosons are obtained by searches at the large hadron collider by the atlas and cms experiments .",
    "recent results based on dilepton resonance searches in @xmath11 and @xmath9 final states use data from the 7 tev proton collisions collected in 2011 and the more recent 8 tev data collected in 2012 .",
    "atlas @xcite obtains exclusion limits at 95% c.l . of @xmath12  tev , @xmath13  tev , @xmath14  tev and @xmath15  tev from 8 tev collisions with 20 fb@xmath16 integrated luminosity , while cms @xcite obtains 95% c.l .",
    "exclusion limits of @xmath17  tev and @xmath18  tev from 8 tev collisions using @xmath19 fb@xmath16 of luminosity luminosity . for these values",
    ", ssm refers to the sequential standard model which has the same fermion couplings as the standard model and is often used as a reference when comparing constraints from different measurements .",
    "the labels @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 refer to @xmath4 s arising from different symmetry breaking scenarios of the @xmath8 group @xcite .",
    "hadron colliders can produce a @xmath4 boson via drell - yan production @xcite , which would then be observed in the invariant mass distribution of the pair produced final state particles . for most models with a @xmath0 ,",
    "the cleanest final state is dileptons , both muons and electrons , due to low backgrounds and clean identification .",
    "a very small number of dilepton events clustered in one or two bins of the invariant mass distribution would be taken as an obvious signal for new physics . to quantify this ,",
    "we consider two opposite sign leptons and impose kinematic cuts of @xmath23 and @xmath24  gev to reflect detector acceptance .",
    "for the discovery limits , we assumed a criteria of 5 isolated dimuon pair events , with a signal - over - background ratio of at least 5 , within @xmath25 of the resonance peak .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show the discovery limits for the various models for several hadron collider benchmark energies and luminosities .",
    "when the lhc reaches it s design energy and luminosity it should be able to see evidence for @xmath4 s up to @xmath1  tev for a large variety of bsm models @xcite , and the high luminosity upgrade ( hl - lhc ) will extend this reach up to @xmath2  tev .",
    "the high energy lhc ( he - lhc ) would substantially extend this reach to @xmath3  tev while the 100  tev very high energy lhc ( vhe - lhc ) could see evidence for @xmath4 s up to @xmath5  tev . for these future searches , the di - electron final state will be the most important as the electromagnetic calorimeters will still be able to measure the electron energy accurately , while the muon energy , measured from the curvature of the track , will not be easily measurable with the existing magnetic field for muons with transverse momenta much above 1 tev @xcite .    for models with a leptophobic @xmath0 and @xmath26 ,",
    "the dominant decay mode for the gauge bosons are to diquarks and leads to a resonance in the dijet invariant mass distribution .",
    "searches have been performed that require two well - separated jets with high transverse momentum .",
    "the cms collaboration excludes the existence of a ssm @xmath4 boson with mass between 1.20 and 1.68 tev at 95% c.l . and a ssm @xmath6 with mass between 1.20 and 2.29  tev using the @xmath27  tev , @xmath28 fb@xmath16 dataset @xcite .",
    "the cms collaboration have also developed a dedicated search for @xmath29 resonances and excluded the existence of a ssm @xmath4 boson within the range of 1.20 to 1.68 tev at 95% c.l . in the @xmath29 channel @xcite . for models with larger",
    "branching fractions to @xmath30-quarks the limit improves considerably , excluding a larger mass range .    to search for evidence of models with generation dependent couplings , such as technicolor models ,",
    "both cms and atlas have performed searches for @xmath0 resonances in the @xmath31 final state .",
    "the cms searches in the dilepton plus jets final state@xcite have excluded masses below 1.3  tev ( 1.9  tev ) for a @xmath0 width of @xmath32 ( 0.10 ) , while the search in the lepton plus jets final state@xcite have excluded masses below 1.49  tev ( 2.04  tev ) . similarly , atlas has excluded a @xmath0 resonance decaying to @xmath31 in topcolor assisted technicolor models within the mass range of @xmath33  tev at 95% c.l . in the single lepton plus jets final state , using 14 fb@xmath16 integrated luminosity @xcite .",
    "it is more difficult to project limits in the @xmath31 and @xmath29 channels to higher energies because of the added complications in dealing with hadronic final states so this topic is left for a future study .",
    "the other way to search for evidence for extra neutral gauge bosons is to look for deviations from the standard model due to interference and virtual effects . in particular",
    ", high energy @xmath9 colliders will be sensitive to new gauge bosons with @xmath35 .",
    "we mention results for the sensitivity of high energy @xmath9 colliders to @xmath4 s for comparison purposes and refer the interested reader to the existing literature @xcite including another contribution to the 2013 snowmass study @xcite .    in @xmath9 collisions below the on - shell production threshold ,",
    "extra gauge bosons manifest themselves as deviations from sm predictions due to interference between the new physics and the sm @xmath36 contributions .",
    "@xmath37 reactions are characterized by relatively clean , simple final states where @xmath38 could be leptons ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 ) or quarks ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath30 , @xmath46 ) , for both polarized and unpolarized @xmath47 .",
    "the basic @xmath37 processes can be parametrized in terms of four helicity amplitudes which can be determined by measuring various observables : the leptonic cross section , @xmath48 , the ratio of the hadronic to the qed point cross section @xmath49 , the leptonic forward - backward asymmetry , @xmath50 , the leptonic longitudinal asymmetry , @xmath51 , the hadronic longitudinal asymmetry , @xmath52 , the forward - backward asymmetry for specific quark or lepton flavours , @xmath53 , the @xmath41 polarization asymmetry , @xmath54 , and the polarized forward - backward asymmetry for specific fermion flavours , @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "the indices @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59`sum over all hadrons ' indicate the final state fermions . precision measurements of these observables for various final states ( @xmath11 , @xmath29 , @xmath31 ) can be sensitive to extra gauge boson masses that by far exceed the direct search limits that are expected at the lhc @xcite .",
    "further , precision measurements of cross sections to different final state fermions using polarized beams can be used to constrain the gauge boson couplings and help distinguish the underlying theory @xcite .",
    "a deviation for one observable is always possible as a statistical fluctuation and different observables have different sensitivities to different models ( or more accurately to different couplings ) . as a consequence ,",
    "a more robust strategy is to combine many observables to obtain a @xmath60 figure of merit .",
    "the ilc sensitivity to @xmath4 s is based on high statistics precision cross section measurements so that the reach will depend on the integrated luminosity . for many models",
    "a 500  gev @xmath9 collider with as little as 50  fb@xmath16 integrated luminosity would see the effects of a @xmath4 with masses as high as @xmath1  tev @xcite .",
    "recent studies @xcite find that a 500  gev ilc with 500  fb@xmath16 and a 1  tev ilc with 1  ab@xmath16 can see evidence or rule out a @xmath4 with masses that can exceed @xmath61 and @xmath62  tev respectively , for many models .",
    "these results also consider various polarizations for the @xmath63 and @xmath64 beams and show that beam polarization will increase the potential reach of the ilc .",
    "it should be noted that in the case of @xmath9 colliders the exclusion limits are very sensitive to the specific model in contrast to hadron colliders where the exclusion limits are are far less model dependent .",
    "we presented the discovery reach for extra gauge bosons that are possible for various high energy hadron colliders that have been considered for the snowmass study .",
    "the lhc should be able to see evidence for @xmath4 s up to @xmath1  tev for a large variety of bsm models , the hl - lhc will extend this reach up to @xmath2  tev , the 30  tev he - lhc to @xmath3  tev and the 100  tev vhe - lhc up to @xmath5  tev . in comparison , a 500  gev , 500  fb@xmath16 @xmath9 collider would be sensitive to @xmath4 s @xmath2  tev comparable to the hl - lhc and a 1  tev , 1  ab@xmath16 @xmath9 collider would be sensitive to @xmath4 s @xmath62  tev comparable to the he - lhc .",
    "we did not discuss the issue of @xmath4 identification if a @xmath4 were discovered .",
    "if a @xmath4 were discovered at a hadron collider , precision measurements at a high energy @xmath9 collider would give valuable information on it s couplings which could not be obtained at hadron colliders on the same time scale .",
