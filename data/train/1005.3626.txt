    "the pore is located at @xmath3 and we focus on the polymer segment to the right of the membrane ( the region located on the right - hand side of the pore is the _ target region _ of the translocation process ) . at a given moment , this polymer segment consists of a certain number @xmath4 of monomer units , each of size @xmath5 , labeled @xmath6 .",
    "translocation is reversible and the polymer can move by one - monomer unit to the right or left with equal rates , resulting in a zero average translocation velocity and a non - vanishing diffusion coefficient @xmath2 for the ` bare ' polymer .",
    "we now suppose that the medium on the right side of the membrane contains a fixed density of special molecules  `` chaperones ''  that adsorb irreversibly , with a certain rate @xmath1 , onto unoccupied adjacent sites of the polymer .",
    "a chaperone is sufficiently large that it can not pass through the pore ( fig .",

    "the complete description is provided by the length @xmath4 of the translocated segment of the polymer and the positions of the occupied monomers by adsorbed chaperones : @xmath28 the length @xmath4 of the translocated segment , the number @xmath29 of the attached chaperone molecules ( equivalently , the number of occupied monomers ) and their positions @xmath30 along the polymer chain are all random variables . at a given time , the first monomer to the right of the pore is always labeled as 1 .",
