    "the recent supernovae observations indicate that our universe is currently accelerating @xcite .",
    "however , from the standard cosmological model we know that earlier the universe decelerated because of domination of matter , and there should exist the moment when the switch from the deceleration phase to the acceleration phase takes place .",
    "the value of redshift for this transition @xmath8 has been recently found by riess et al .",
    "they obtained @xmath9 using a kinematic model independent on the content of the universe .",
    "their method does not allow to obtain both the equation of state parameters and the transition redshift in the same framework .",
    "the dark energy equation of state parameters are estimated in models with different ansatz on @xmath10 .",
    "however the constraint on the transition redshift was obtained using other relation for @xmath11 .",
    "let us note that there is no reason to treat the value of @xmath8 estimated in a certain model as a real value in another model .    in this paper",
    "we propose the method which allows to calculate both equation of state parameters and the transition redshift in the same model .",
    "we estimate the value of @xmath8 through the potential function @xmath12 $ ] of the hamiltonian system determining the evolution of the universe . in this approach",
    "the evolution of the universe is reduced to the motion of a fictitious particle with a unit mass in a one - dimensional potential .",
    "the information about the influence of matter content on the dynamics of the universe is derived from the shape of the potential function @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "namely the scale factor @xmath2 accelerates ( decelerates ) in the interval of @xmath3 if @xmath12 $ ] is an increasing ( decreasing ) function of @xmath3",
    ". therefore we should expect the potential function has a maximum for the universe with deceleration during its earlier epoch and acceleration at present .",
    "in our previous papers @xcite we developed the potential function method to probe the dark energy .",
    "the use of the potential @xmath12 $ ] instead of @xmath13 has an advantage because the former suffers less from the smearing effect caused by the double integral which relates @xmath13 and @xmath11 @xcite . in these papers we showed that the dynamics of the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) model of the universe , filled with non - interacting , non - relativistic matter with equation of state @xmath14 and dark energy with the equation of state @xmath15 , can be reduced to the hamiltonian system @xmath16 where an overdot denotes the differentiation with respect to the cosmic time @xmath17 , and the potential @xmath18 where the units @xmath19 are used and @xmath20 is the effective energy density of the mixture of non - interacting fluids which satisfy the conservation equation @xmath21 then @xmath20 also satisfies equation ( [ eq:5 ] ) . on the other hand",
    "the potential function @xmath0 can be reconstructed from the sn ia data through the hubble function @xmath22 which in the spatially flat universe is related to the luminosity distance @xmath11 as @xmath23^{-1}.\\ ] ]    because the trajectories of system ( [ eq:3 ] ) always lie on the zero - energy level ( as a consequence of the hamiltonian constraint ) we can rewrite potential ( [ eq:4 ] ) to the form @xmath24^{-2}.\\ ] ]    the potential @xmath1 contains all information necessary to determine the full dynamics of the universe on the phase plane @xmath25 .",
    "thus both the effective energy density @xmath26 and the equation of state coefficient @xmath27 \\equiv p_{\\rm eff}/\\rho_{\\rm eff}$ ] can be calculated unambiguously from the potential function @xmath0 @xmath28,\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the elasticity of the potential function @xmath30 with respect to the scale factor @xmath2 .",
    "as it is well known the behavior of the potential function in the neighborhood of a maximum can be approximated by a quadratic part of the expansion in taylor s series .",

    "note that as @xmath3 is close to @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) than the last two terms are negligible and only the `` cosmological constant '' dominates the dynamics of the late epoch of the universe .",
    "the value of the potential function at the maximum is given by @xmath38 the value of @xmath8 and @xmath39 inform us about the moment of transition and the hubble function at this moment .",
    "the estimation of these parameters will be done in the next section .",
    "in our previous papers the method of reconstruction of the potential function was applied to the analysis of global dynamics of the frw models in the phase space @xcite .",
    "the potential function was reconstructed from the sn ia data which allow us to determine all evolutional paths of the model for all admissible initial conditions .",
    "these results have the qualitative character , but it is also possible to obtain some quantitative attributes of the reconstructed dynamics of a model .    it seems to be important to determine when the switch from the deceleration to the acceleration happens in different cosmological models . because it is possible to differentiate between cosmological models through the quantitative features of their potential functions , we propose to use it as the test of cosmological models .",
    "the maximum of the potential function , interpreted as the time of switch between deceleration and acceleration phases , can be chosen as a one of the criteria ( another may be the value of the potential function at @xmath8 ) . if someone obtains the value of @xmath8 independently from any model ( e.g. one can numerically probe it directly from the observational data ) , it could be compared with values of @xmath8 found in different cosmological models .",
