    "since its introduction in 1975  @xcite the sherrington - kirkpatrick ( sk ) model for spin glasses has been one of the major challenges for the physicists interested in complex systems .",
    "although it is a mean - field model the exact solution is still not completely certain .",
    "nonetheless it is known  @xcite that in the low - temperature phase the replica symmetry is spontaneously broken and this makes the solution highly non trivial .",
    "in other words it can be rigorously proved that it is not possible that the connected correlation function of the spins at different points goes to zero when the total number of spins @xmath0 goes to infinity ; consequently the probability distribution of the overlap @xmath1 ( defined below ) can not be a single delta function as happens in usual model ( e.g.  ferromagnetic model ) .",
    "the existence of fluctuating intensive quantities ( like @xmath1 ) implies that it is not possible that only one equilibrium state is present in the thermodynamic limit . as usual extensive quantities",
    "do fluctuate when more than one equilibrium state is present and consequently we could say , with some abuse of language ( see  @xcite for a more precise discussion ) that in the sk model , for large values of @xmath0 more that one equilibrium state is present .",
    "the presence of many equilibrium states implies that any analytic solution of the model should tell us something on the nature of these states , on their relative relations and on the probability at equilibrium of finding the system in one of these states .",
    "of course this information should be of probabilistic nature given the presence of the quenched disorder in the system .",
    "using the replica formalism an ansatz was proposed almost twenty years ago  @xcite which makes some hypothesis on the nature of the states , the most notable being ultrametricity .",
    "roughly speaking ultrametricity implies that the distance among the different states is such that they can be put in a taxonomic or genealogical tree such that the distance among two states is consistent with their position on the tree .",
    "this hierarchical ansatz seems every day more reliable and , although the physical origin of ultrametricity was not fully evident , it is widely believed that it provides the correct solution of the sk model .",
    "the ultrametric solution has passed many numerical tests and it is in agreement with all the known analytical results  @xcite .",
    "it is quite possible , and in agreement with the numerical simulations , that the ultrametric organization of the equilibrium configurations is also present in finite dimensional spin glasses  @xcite .",
    "it is certainly very interesting to find which are the physical assumptions at the basis of the hierarchical ansatz for two reasons : it would be easier to understand if the assumptions make sense also in the finite dimensional case and it could be easier to prove them of to extract their consequences .",
    "a considerable progress has been done in recent years when it was realized that one of the main hypothesis at the basis of the hierarchical ansatz was stochastic stability : many compulsory arguments can be given for the validity of stochastic stability and the correctness of this hypothesis can be directly tested in experiments measuring the fluctuations and the response to a perturbation of the appropriate quantities . in the replica language _ stochastic stability _",
    "is equivalent to the usual assumption of _ replica equivalence _",
    "( i.e.  each replica is equivalent to the others ) .",
    "the other pillar of the hierarchical ansatz turned out to be ultrametricity .",
    "indeed it can be shown that if we assume stochastic stability and ultrametricity , the whole hierarchical ansatz can be reconstructed  @xcite .",
    "the aim of this note is to show that there is a simpler property which is equivalent to ultrametricity .",
    "this property can be called _ separability , _ in the replica language , or _ overlap equivalence _ : it states that all the mutual information about a pair of equilibrium configurations is encoded in their mutual distance or overlap .",
    "in other words according to the principle of overlap equivalence any possible definition of overlaps should not give information additional to that of the usual overlap .",
    "it is not clear if there are strong compulsory reasons for assuming overlap equivalence , however , the results presented here show that the hierarchical ansatz is certainly the simplest one that we may think for a stochastically stable system with many equilibrium states : any other possible proposal should include the presence of at least two inequivalent definitions of distance .",
    "these two assumptions , stochastic stability and overlap equivalence , are quite general and can be applied to many other systems beyond the sk model . a direct test or an analytic proof of the validity of both properties would have direct implications on the validity of the ultrametric solution .",
    "moreover as we have already remarked the results that we are going to present in this paper is interesting because they show the root of ultrametricity : ultrametricity is the unique possibility we have if we stay within the simple framework where stochastic stability and separability hold .",
    "it should be clear that the whole discussion applies to systems in which the overlap fluctuates also when the volume is very large and consequently replica symmetry is broken .",
    "for systems in which the overlap does not fluctuates and replica symmetry is exact we have nothing to say ( ultrametricity is satisfied , but in a trivial way ) .",
    "it should also be clear that the arguments presented here can not be used to argue if replica symmetry breaking happens or not in a particular system .",
    "we do not discuss here the criticism that have been done to the replica approach by  @xcite ( who cast some doubts on the viability of replica symmetry breaking in finite dimensional systems ) : the reader may find a quite long discussion in  @xcite .    in the second section we will recall the replica formalism , in the third section we will present our assumptions . next in the forth section we will present our main results on the relation among overlap equivalence and ultrametricity .",
    "finally we will present our conclusions .",
    "some of the arguments needed to show that overlap equivalence implies separability are presented in appendix i and a part of the tedious algebra we have to do to reach the results is confined in appendix ii .",
    "in this paper we make use of the replica formalism ( we address the reader to refs .",
    "@xcite for an introduction on the issue ) .",
    "let for simplicity restrict the discussion to systems with quenched random disorder in the hamiltonian .",
    "a similar discussion can be done for system without quenched disorder ( like structural glasses ) if we substitute the average over the quenched disorder with the average over the size of the system .",
    "we consider a system with @xmath0 spins characterized by an hamiltonian @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 represents the quenched disorder ) .",
    "we define @xmath4 to be the probability distribution of finding two equilibrium configurations @xmath5 and @xmath6 at the same inverse temperature @xmath7 with overlap @xmath1 , the overlap @xmath1 being defined as @xmath8    let us assume that , in the large @xmath0 limit , the function @xmath4 does not becomes a delta function ( otherwise we have nothing interesting to say ) and therefore the function @xmath4 has a non trivial shape also for large @xmath0 .",
    "when this happens , we are interested to find out the probability distribution of the function @xmath4 in the limit where @xmath0 goes to infinity . for a given value of @xmath0 different choices of @xmath3 may produce different functions @xmath4 and we can introduce the functional @xmath9 as the probability distribution of @xmath4 at fixed @xmath0 ( we assume that the @xmath3 have a given probability distribution ) .",
    "eventually we would like to know @xmath10 we are also interested to control the behavior of the probability distribution of the mutual overlaps among three or more equilibrium configurations ( e.g.  the probability @xmath11 which will be properly defined later ) .",
    "the origin of our interest in the probability distribution of the overlap is due to the fact that they control many others physical properties of the systems : e.g.  in some models one finds  @xcite that the magnetic susceptibility is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the average over @xmath3 of the equilibrium expectation value of @xmath1 .    in the replica formalism the behavior of the these probability distributions",
    "is encoded by an @xmath14 symmetric matrix @xmath15 in the limit of @xmath16 ( taken after the analytical continuation of @xmath17 from integer to real values ) .",
    "the limiting matrix depends on all the matrices with any value of @xmath17 and so the general solution has an infinite number of parameters and the analytical continuation of the matrix @xmath15 is , in general , dependent on an extremely high number of parameters .",
    "this is quite natural as far as the matrix @xmath15 encodes the properties of the functional which controls the probability distribution of finding for a random @xmath3 a set of probability distributions for the overlaps ( i.e.  @xmath4 , @xmath11 ,  ) .    in the hierarchical ansatz",
    "the @xmath17 replicas are divided into many groups of equal sizes , such that , if the replica indices @xmath18 and @xmath19 belong to the same group , then  has a higher value than whether @xmath18 and @xmath19 are in different groups .",
    "the groups are then divided in subgroups and so on for an infinite number of times .",
    "this kind of solution can be summarized in an infinite set of parameters ( the size of the group and the value of the overlap at each level ) . in the limit @xmath16 these parameters",
    "can be conveniently represented by a function  defined for @xmath20 $ ] , where  is the probability of finding in the matrix @xmath15 an element of value @xmath1 . to",
    "every ultrametric matrix @xmath15 corresponds one and only one probability distribution function .    in the paramagnetic phase all the elements of @xmath15 are equal and",
    "the function  is a delta function . in the spin glass phase",
    "the elements  take different values and the  acquires a finite width .",
    "the relation of this function with the probability distribution function of the overlap is @xmath21 where the bar denotes the average over @xmath3 at fixed @xmath0 .",
    "the equality of the two functions  and @xmath22 is one of the many relations among probability distribution functions of the overlaps and the matrix @xmath15 .",
    "more complicated probability distribution functions ( pdf ) can be defined , considering the joint probability of more than one overlap .",
    "for example a crucial role is played by the joint pdf of 3 real replicas @xmath23 , defined as the @xmath3-average of @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are three equilibrium configurations and @xmath28 with the indices @xmath29 and @xmath7 running from 1 to 3 .    if ultrametricity holds , this probability distribution has the following property @xmath30 as soon as the ultrametricity relations @xmath31 are not satisfied .",
    "the um property can be easier understood by a geometrical picture . given three configurations , that is three points in the configurational space , um implies that they can be the vertices of two kind of triangles only : equilateral or isosceles , with the two equal edges larger than the third one .",
    "the other kind of isosceles triangles , together with the scalene triangles , can not be obtained with any tern of equilibrium configurations , if these configurations are organized in an um fashion .",
    "this property , which is satisfied in the hierarchical ansatz , has rather strong consequences .",
    "firstly , as far as probabilities can not be negative , the previous relations implies that also for any @xmath3 ( with probability one ) we have that @xmath32 as soon as the relations in eq.([eq : dis ] ) are not satisfied .",
    "this result has the consequence that any equilibrium configuration can be assigned ( for fixed @xmath3 ) to a leave of a tree constructed in such a way that the overlap among two equilibrium configuration is related to the distance of the two configurations on the tree .",
    "ultrametricity implies for example that , if two equilibrium configurations 1 and 2 are at overlap @xmath33 , any equilibrium configuration 3 such that @xmath34 satisfies also the relation @xmath35 .",
    "ultrametricity is very interesting because it implies that many pdf of more than three overlaps are zero in a wide region and reduces the whole problem to the construction of the statistical properties of the aforementioned tree .    moreover , if stochastic stability is valid , the ultrametricity completely determines the @xmath36 given the .",
    "one can show that  @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 in other words stochastic stability and ultrametricity allow us to obtain all the pdf of the overlap starting from the knowledge of the function .",
    "it is clear that it is extremely difficult to arrive to some general conclusions on these probability distributions without doing extra assumptions .",
    "we now show that two rather simple assumptions : replica equivalence ( or equivalently stochastic stability ) and separability are giving very strong constraints .",
    "let us firstly consider replica equivalence as formulated in replica formalism .",
    "as we have already stated the properties of the probability distribution of the overlaps can be obtained in terms of the matrix . even in the low - temperature phase ,",
    "when the matrix elements  are not constant , we may expect no physical difference between the replicas ( which have been introduced as a mathematical trick ) .",
    "replica equivalence states that the observable which involve only one replica are replica symmetric , i.e.  the assume the same value .",
    "for example replica equivalence implies that we must have that @xmath40 does not depend on @xmath18 .",
    "replica equivalence is equivalent to the stochastic stability property introduced by guerra  @xcite and aizenman and contucci  @xcite which is valid under general conditions , i.e.  if we introduce an arbitrary small random long range hamiltonian ( see  @xcite for a more careful discussion ) .",
    "eq.([re ] ) implies that each line ( column ) of the matrix @xmath15 is a permutation of the other lines ( columns ) .",
    "moreover it has interesting consequences : with some algebra the following equalities can be proven @xmath41    the proof of these equations can be done by recalling some relations among the matrix  and the probability functions @xmath42 where the primed sum is done over all different replica indices .",
    "let us denote @xmath43 the sum does not depend on @xmath18 as consequence of replica equivalence .",
    "it is also evident that @xmath44    if we now look to the consequences of the previous equation and we use the relations in eq.([prima ] ) both for @xmath45 and @xmath46 , we obtain the two relations in eq.([gue_rel ] ) .",
    "identical relations have been proven by guerra  @xcite , using stochastic stability .",
    "we can very safely assume that they must be valid in any scheme of replica symmetry breaking .",
    "eq.([gue_rel ] ) determine all the joint pdf of 2 real replicas in terms of the .",
    "the consequences of stochastic stability have been lengthy discussed in  @xcite . in the nutshell stochastic stability implies that the system is a generic random system and it does not have any special properties : its properties are smooth functions of any external random perturbation .",
    "the second assumption we made is the separability ( also know as non - degeneracy ) of the matrix @xmath15  @xcite , which correspond to the following statement .",
    "let us consider all the matrices which can be generated from the matrix @xmath15 in a permutational covariant fashion .",
    "some example are @xmath47 separability states that , if we take two pair of indices ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) , we have that @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a generic matrix of the set generated by the rules shown in eq.([set ] )",
    ". in other words pairs of indices which have different properties have different values of the overlap .",
    "it means that we can classify a pair of replicas in terms of their mutual overlap  @xcite and that no finer classification of their mutual properties is possible .",
    "the physical meaning of separability can be understood if we introduce another concept , the overlap equivalence .",
    "let us consider an arbitrary local observable @xmath52 .",
    "simple examples of such an observable are @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are appropriate functions ( e.g.  they decrease sufficiently fast at infinity )",
    ". many more complex choices of the local observable @xmath56 can be constructed , for example those involving more than two spins .    for any choice of the operator @xmath56 we could define a generalized overlap  @xcite : @xmath57    in the hierarchical ansatz it turns out  @xcite that for any reasonable choice of the observable @xmath56",
    ", @xmath58 is a function of @xmath1 . in other words when we change the two equilibrium configurations and the couplings @xmath3 the values of @xmath1 and @xmath58 fluctuates also for very large @xmath0 , while the value of @xmath58 restricted on those pairs of configurations with a fixed value of @xmath1 does not fluctuate when @xmath0 goes to infinity ( that is a scattered plot of @xmath1 and @xmath58 should collapse on a curve in the limit of large @xmath0 ) . in other words",
    "overlap equivalence implies that in the case where replica symmetry is broken and all overlaps fluctuate in the usual thermodynamical ensemble , these fluctuations disappear in the fixed @xmath1 ensemble .",
    "in other words overlap equivalence states that for a system composed by two replicas the overlap is a good , complete order parameter in the same way as the magnetization is for ferromagnetic systems .",
    "if we stay in the usual thermodynamic ensemble , there are many quantities that fluctuates also at large distances , however if we consider the restricted ensemble where the order parameter takes a given value , all fluctuations at large distance disappear and the connected correlation functions go to zero at infinity .",
    "this happens only if the order parameter has been chosen in such a way to carry enough information : in a ferromagnetic heisenberg model the order parameter must be the three component vector of the magnetization , one or two components of the magnetization would be not enough to fully characterize the state of the system in case of a spontaneous magnetization",
    ".    a direct check of overlap equivalence can be done in usual numerical simulations and it would be very interesting to see the results .",
    "this property is called overlap equivalence because it states that all possible definitions of the overlap are equivalent and there is an unique correspondence among the values of the different overlaps .",
    "it is clear that the overlap equivalence is a very strong simplification .",
    "in general we could have that the mutual relations among two equilibrium configurations are characterized by a large , possibly infinite set of independent overlaps and therefore their mutual relations are characterized by a large ( or infinite ) set of parameters .",
    "the property of overlap equivalence implies a much simpler situation , where only one parameter ( the overlap @xmath1 ) characterizes the mutual relations among two equilibrium configurations .",
    "we can argue that separability is the way to code overlap equivalence in the replica formalism . both properties state that once the overlap among two _ objects _ is fixed , all the mutual relations among the two objects are also fixed .",
    "the difference among these two statements is that in the case of replica equivalence the two objects are equilibrium configurations while in the case of separability the two objects are replicas .",
    "the identification of separability with overlap equivalence is quite natural because the structure of the matrix @xmath15 in replica space mirrors the structure of the mutual overlaps of equilibrium configurations . in appendix",
    "i we present some more detailed considerations which points toward the correctness of the identification of these two properties , however a more general and formal proof of this statement would be welcome .    it is interesting to note that in the simplest model leading to ultrametricity , i.e.  a branching random process in the infinite dimensional space the condition of overlap equivalence is satisfied  @xcite .",
    "indeed if we consider a random vector @xmath59 in a finite dimensional space ( of dimension @xmath0 ) the quantities @xmath60 convey different information when @xmath29 changes from 1 to @xmath0 and can be used as different measures of the distance . on the other end ,",
    "when @xmath0 goes to infinity at fixed @xmath61 , thanks to the rotational invariance , we have that for each @xmath29 , @xmath62 .",
    "then if we introduce generalized distances parameterized by @xmath63 ( where @xmath64 ) and defined as @xmath65 it is easy to check that with probability 1 ( if the probability distribution is rotational invariant ) in the limit @xmath66 @xmath67 therefore in this simply model overlap equivalence is automatically satisfied .",
    "let us consider what happens in the usual hierarchical ansatz . in this case ,",
    "when replica symmetry is broken , there is a subgroup of the group of permutations that commutes with the matrix @xmath15 .",
    "let us consider the orbits in the space of pairs of indices .",
    "it can be checked that the values of the elements of the matrix @xmath15 and of any matrix derived using the rules in eq.([set ] ) are constant of the orbits and that different values of @xmath1 do correspond in general to different orbits .",
    "moreover it can be checked that both separability and overlap equivalence hold in this case .",
    "maybe the simplest non - trivial example of a non - ultrametric system is given by the union of separately ultrametric system with a non - trivial distribution of the overlaps  @xcite .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath68 does not satisfy the ultrametric condition also if @xmath69 and @xmath70 do satisfy it .",
    "however it is clear that in this example @xmath69 and @xmath70 are generalized overlaps which are not function of @xmath1 .",
    "both ultrametricity and overlaps equivalence disappear at the same time  .",
    "the separability condition is extremely powerful in determining the expectation values of higher order moments of the probability distribution .",
    "let us study a simple example and let us consider two matrices @xmath51 and @xmath71 constructed with the rules in eq .",
    "( [ set ] ) .",
    "it is evident that we can write @xmath72 where we have defined @xmath73 indeed separability implies that the matrix elements @xmath74 and @xmath75 are constant in the region where @xmath76 and their value is denoted @xmath77 and @xmath78 respectively . in the same way we have that : @xmath79 therefore separability implies that quantities like those in eq.([prod ] ) can be computed from the knowledge of those in eq.([due ] ) .",
    "if we introduce the functions @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 such that @xmath83 the previous equations implies that @xmath84 the last equation can also be written as @xmath85 if we apply the previous formula to the case where @xmath51 and @xmath71 have the form @xmath86 and we consider all the possible values of the @xmath87 s , we find ( after separating the contributions where some of the indices are equal ) the rather surprising formula @xmath88 similar results can be obtained for other probability distributions with more overlap .",
    "eq.([woh ] ) is particular interesting because integrating over @xmath1 it implies that @xmath89 + \\nonumber \\\\ + 2 \\int { { \\rm d}}q { p^{12,23,31}(q , q_1,q_2 ) p^{12,23,31}(q , q_3,q_4 ) \\over p(q ) } \\quad .",
    "\\label{main}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the previous equation is remarkable not only because it give the full expression of the probability with four overlap in terms of the probability with three overlaps but also because it puts hard constraints on the possible values of the function @xmath90 .",
    "indeed the l.h.s .  of eq.([main ] ) is by definition invariant under cyclic permutation of the @xmath1 s , while the r.h.s .  of the same equation",
    "is not invariant for a generic choice of the function @xmath36 .",
    "what is the form of the generic function @xmath36 that satisfy eq.([main ] ) ?",
    "we will argue in the next section that it must be ultrametric .",
    "our problem is now that of finding the most general matrix @xmath15 ( or equivalently the most general probability distribution ) compatible with the replica equivalence [ and then with guerra s relations , eq.([gue_rel ] ) ] and with separability [ and then in particular with eq.([main ] ) ] . we will show that the most general matrix is the ultrametric one .",
    "we consider the case when few values ( @xmath91 , @xmath92 or @xmath93 ) are allowed for the matrix elements .",
    "the generalization to more than 5 values is straightforward and we hope that our conclusions will still be valid for a generic  which have a continuous distribution of possible values .    when the overlap ( or the matrix elements ) can take only @xmath87 different values the function  is the sum of @xmath87 delta functions @xmath94 where the weights @xmath95 are , by definition , positive and such that @xmath96 , and the values @xmath97 are different .",
    "also the joint pdf of 3 overlaps @xmath36 ( that hereafter we will call for brevity ) is the the sum of @xmath98 delta functions on the points @xmath99 with @xmath100 and so we should give the @xmath98 weights @xmath101 in order to determine .",
    "we can lower the number of free parameters @xmath101 using some symmetries and the guerra relations",

    "the symmetries imply that @xmath108 while the guerra s relations imply some equalities like @xmath109 we end with only 4 free parameters ( @xmath110 ) : @xmath111 the way we have ordered the probabilities is meaningful : we call @xmath112 the weight of the scalene triangle ( which is forbidden in the ultrametric solution ) and we call @xmath113 the weights of the isosceles triangles ( which are also forbidden in the um ansatz if we assume the overlap ordering @xmath114 ) .    if we do not fix any order in the values of the @xmath97 , we have to keep in mind that , whether we exchange two of the overlap values , the forbidden isosceles triangle changes .",

    "the l.h.s .  of these equations will be called respectively @xmath157 and @xmath158 , for brevity .",
    "our demonstration follows two steps : first we show that the equations of the kind of eq.([dueq ] ) can be solved only if all the scalene parameters @xmath101 ( with @xmath159 different ) are zero , then we find all the solutions for the simplified set of equations corresponding to eq.([treq ] ) .",
    "our demonstration is essentially based on the non - negativity of the @xmath157 expressions and on the properties of the double - parenthesis symbol , previously introduced .",
    "first of all we note ( see appendix ii ) that when we set to zero all the scalene parameters @xmath101 ( with @xmath159 different ) , every @xmath157 becomes the sum of some double - parenthesis symbols , and so it is non - negative . moreover in some of the @xmath157 expressions all the scalene parameters have positive defined coefficients , and then we should set them to zero in order to solve the equation , @xmath160 . in appendix",
    "ii we present a possible way of choosing the @xmath157 expressions in order to systematically set to zero all the scalene parameters .",
    "once the scalene parameters have been set to zero , we prefer working with eq.([treq ] ) , because each equation identified by @xmath156 takes a very simple form : @xmath161 where we choose the indexes such that @xmath162 . in general , given 3 different overlap values , we can easily write down the corresponding equation [ of the kind of eq.([treq ] ) ] , which gives , once we set all the scalene parameters to zero , the corresponding double - parenthesis symbol [ of the kind of eq.([final ] ) ] .    what about the equation with 2 and 4 different overlaps ?",
    "when we set all the scalene parameters to zero , we have that the expressions @xmath157 are the sum of @xmath163 of these double - parenthesis symbols , those derived from the overlap terns @xmath164 with @xmath165 and @xmath166 ( that is those where the parameter @xmath167 appears ) . on the other hand the equations with 4 different overlaps are identically satisfied and they are useless .",
    "then we conclude that , in the more general solution , eq.([final ] ) must hold for every overlaps tern @xmath168 .",
    "what does it imply in terms of the ultrametric properties of ?    for any pair of overlaps @xmath169 we have two different isosceles triangles : a `` right '' one ( i.e.  allowed by um ) with probability @xmath170 and a `` wrong '' one ( i.e.  forbidden by um ) with probability @xmath171 . in the solution we have found , almost all the wrong isosceles triangles are forbidden .",
    "more precisely , for any pair of overlaps @xmath169 , such that there is an overlap @xmath172 in between ( @xmath173 ) , we have that @xmath174 and the wrong isosceles triangle is not allowed . that can be easily proved noting that , for any @xmath173 , the equation @xmath175 forces @xmath174 .",
    "small um violations can appear only when one considers nearest neighbors overlaps pairs .",
    "in this case both the right and the wrong isosceles triangles are allowed .",
    "however , for any fixed @xmath87 , the maximum number of wrong isosceles triangles allowed is @xmath176 $ ] , while the total number of isosceles triangles is proportional to @xmath177 .",
    "so in the limit @xmath178 the probability of having wrong isosceles triangles tends to zero .",
    "moreover , if in the continuum limit the @xmath22 is dense on a single compact domain , the distance between any pair of nearest neighbors overlaps tends to zero for @xmath178 and then strict um holds for any finite overlap difference @xmath179 .",
    "lastly it should be noted that we have not exploited all the available information and maybe even these small um violations could be ruled out with some more work .",
    "in fact we believe that the solution with both @xmath180 and @xmath170 different from zero , actually corresponds to the case @xmath181 and it is not really an um violation",
    ".    maybe it should be also possible to find a direct proof of our result directly in the continuum limit , without considering the intermediate case in which the number of steps are finite , using maybe the techniques introduced by ruelle  @xcite , however we have not succeeded in this task .",
    "we have seen that in systems where the function @xmath22 is non trivial and the overlap is a fluctuating quantity , stochastic stability and separability imply ultrametricity .",
    "the reader should notice that the proofs presented here are likely to be too involved and it is quite possible that there is a direct proof of the fact that replica equivalence implies ultrametricity .",
    "at this end we recall that in a dynamical approach it was show that one can identify a dynamical equivalent of separability : i.e.  we can assume that in the aging regime all the possible overlaps among two configurations at two quite different times ( @xmath182 and @xmath183 ) are functions of the usual overlap among the two configurations at the same times ( @xmath182 and @xmath183 ) .",
    "it was possible to prove that this dynamical overlap equivalence implies a dynamical form of ultrametricity .",
    "this result implies that , if we do not give up stochastic stability ( which is a general property of generic equilibrium systems ) violations of ultrametricity may be found only in systems for which the separability conditions does not hold and the mutual relations among equilibrium configurations is described by two or more overlaps .",
    "the probability distribution of such a system ( if it exists in the framework of equilibrium statistical mechanics ) would be much more complex of that of the usual ultrametric ansatz .",
    "we can thus conclude that the ultrametric solution is the simplest one .",
    "our arguments imply that it would be particularly interesting to check the numerical validity of overlap equivalence .",
    "this task can be done at high precision using present numerical technology .",
    "this could be done just doing numerical simulations in the ensemble with fixed overlap and looking to the fluctuations of the other overlaps .",
    "we thank s. franz and m. a. virasoro for many interesting discussion on the subject of the paper .",
    "in this appendix we present some arguments in order to show that _ separability _ implies _ overlap equivalence_.    to this end let us consider a specific spin glass model @xmath184 where the variables @xmath3 are gaussian uncorrelated random variables with zero average and variance @xmath185 in short range models @xmath186 is a fast decreasing function of the distance among the two points @xmath187 and @xmath87 while in the sk model @xmath188 , @xmath0 being the total number of spins .    in this model",
    "we can define not only the usual overlap but also a modified overlap among two configurations @xmath5 and @xmath6 which we denote by @xmath189 : @xmath190 in the same way we can define an overlap among two replicas , which we denote by @xmath191 @xmath192    we notice that by simple integration by part on the gaussian variables @xmath3 one can prove that @xmath193 with @xmath194 where by the overbar we denote the average over the random quenched variables @xmath3 .",
    "a similar computation tells us that the fluctuations of the quantity @xmath189 at fixed @xmath1 are ( neglecting terms which go to zero with the volume ) the same as the fluctuations of @xmath195 at fixed @xmath196 . on the other end",
    "it is evident that @xmath197 separability states that the last sum takes a fixed value which does not fluctuates if we stay in the ensemble of fixed @xmath198 .    at this level",
    "the relation among separability and overlap equivalence is clear : the first is equivalent to the statement that the quantity @xmath199 does not fluctuate ( in the fixed @xmath196 ensemble ) when @xmath200 is large , while for overlap equivalence we need the same quantities does not fluctuate when the distance among @xmath187 and @xmath87 is fixed .",
    "the two properties seems to be slightly different if the interaction is short range . on the contrary",
    "if the interaction is long range the two formulations are the same . in order to be more precise",
    "we can consider a model in which a small long range interaction has been added and the same argument as before can be used to prove that overlap equivalence implies separability .",
    "moreover the presence of a long range term should not affect too much the properties according to the principle of stochastic stability which tells us that the system should be stable with respect to a small random perturbation .",
    "the argument we have presented here tell us that replica equivalence implies separability .",
    "in this appendix we show some details of the computation we have done in the cases @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "in particular we show exactly how to derive the solution for the @xmath92 case , while we simply sketch it in the @xmath93 case .",
    "let s consider the equation of the kind of eq.([dueq ] ) with the two greatest overlaps ( @xmath204 and @xmath205 in the @xmath92 case ) , @xmath206 using some of eqs.([def ] ) and multiplying the previous equation by @xmath207 we end with the following equation @xmath208 ( p_{432}+p_{431 } ) + \\nonumber \\\\ + [ 4 p_1 p_3 p_4 ] p_{432 } p_{431 } + [ 2 p_1 p_4 ( p_2+p_3 ) ] p_{432}^2 + [ 2 p_2 p_4 ( p_1+p_3 ) ] p_{431}^2 = 0 \\quad .",
    "\\quad \\label{eq43}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in @xmath209 there are all the terms that survive from the expression @xmath210 when we set all the scalene parameters to zero . in general all the expressions",
    "@xmath211 are non - negative defined ( see below ) .    the coefficients of @xmath212 and @xmath213 in eq.([eq43 ] )",
    "are positive defined , thanks to the inequalities @xmath214 , that are direct consequence of eqs.([def ] ) and of probabilities positiveness .",
    "then we have that eq.([eq43 ] ) is equivalent to @xmath215 and @xmath216 .",
    "to force the two remaining scalene parameters to zero , it is enough to consider the equation analogous to eq.([ciao ] ) with @xmath217 and @xmath218 instead of @xmath205 and @xmath204 .",
    "once we set @xmath215 we obtain @xmath219 p_{421 } + \\nonumber \\\\ + [ 2 p_1 p_3 p_4 ( a_{42}+a_{32 } ) + p_1 p_2 p_4 ( p_3 p_2 -2 a_{32 } + p_3 p_1 -2 a_{31 } ) ] p_{321 } + \\nonumber \\\\ + [ 2 p_3 p_4(p_1+p_2 ) ] ( p_{421 } + p_{321})^2 = 0 \\quad . \\label{eq21}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] again we note that all the coefficient are positive defined thanks to eqs.([def ] ) and to the positiveness of the probabilities .",
    "eq.([eq21 ] ) implies @xmath220 and @xmath221 .      in order to obtain this result",
    "we have made only one assumption , about the non - negativity of @xmath209 and of @xmath222 , which we now show to be correct . using the rescaled variables , @xmath223 , those expressions read @xmath224",
    "note that @xmath209 ( resp .",
    "@xmath222 ) is the sum of the two double - parenthesis symbols containing @xmath225 ( resp .",
    "@xmath226 ) .    once we set to zero all the scalene parameters @xmath227 , we found easier to work with equations of the kind of eq.([treq ] ) .",
    "for example , considering the 3 overlaps @xmath114 , we have that @xmath228 in general for every 3 given overlaps we end with an equation like eq.([final ] ) .",
    "the way to force the scalene parameters to zero should be now clear : it exploit the coefficient positiveness in the equations with 2 different overlaps .",
    "maybe it is still not so clear if there is a systematic way to set all those parameters to zero , without getting lost in the many @xmath157 expressions .",
