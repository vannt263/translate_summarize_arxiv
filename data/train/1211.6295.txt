    "weather forecasting is crucial for government , military , industrial and agricultural applications . as well as an open scientific question .",
    "global numerical weather forecasting pioneered by  @xcite today is carried out using a multitude of methods , each having it s advantages and disadvantages .",
    "the foremost method consists of the solution of the global flow and energy equations of the atmosphere ( navier - stokes ) . due to the inherent complexity of these equations ,",
    "simplifications are used .",
    "these include hydrostatic , geostrophic and quasi - geostrophic approximations . the domain is then divided using a grid and equations are solved within the grid and advanced in time , using finite elements or finite difference methods .",
    "newer methods include spectral methods , which show exponential convergence for smooth problems  @xcite .",
    "manipulating the vast datasets and performing the complex calculations necessary to modern numerical weather prediction requires some of the most powerful supercomputers in the world .",
    "even with the increasing power of supercomputers , the forecast skill of numerical weather models extends to about only six days .",
    "factors affecting the accuracy of numerical predictions include the density and quality of observations used as input to the forecasts , along with deficiencies in the numerical models themselves .",
    "although post - processing techniques such as model output statistics ( mos ) have been developed to improve the handling of errors in numerical predictions , a more fundamental problem lies in the chaotic nature of the partial differential equations used to simulate the atmosphere .",
    "it is impossible to solve these equations exactly , and small errors grow with time ( doubling about every five days ) .",
    "in addition , the partial differential equations used in the model need to be supplemented with parameterizations for solar radiation , moist processes ( clouds and precipitation ) , heat exchange , soil , vegetation , surface water , and the effects of terrain . in an effort to quantify the large amount of inherent uncertainty remaining in numerical predictions , ensemble forecasts  @xcite",
    "have been used since the 1990s to help gauge the confidence in the forecast , and to obtain useful results farther into the future than otherwise possible .",
    "this approach analyzes multiple forecasts created with an individual forecast model or multiple models .",
    "monte carlo simulations are then carried out on the forecasts to obtain the statistical distribution of error of the forecast .",
    "the limitations of ensemble methods are inherent in the global modeling approach .",
    "other methods for weather forecasting include the `` downscaling '' of global climate models ( gcms )  @xcite to localized regions using statistical relations between _ predictors _ and _ predictands_. predictors are taken from the gcm model output such as temperature , pressure at different altitudes and locations .",
    "predictands are the local variables to be simulated , these include temperature , pressure , wind and precipitation .",
    "these methods are mainly used for the study of impact of global warming on surface variables .",
    "@xcite have shown that these models deviate significantly from observed data .",
    "statistical methods of weather forecasting from time series are known from the works of  @xcite and  @xcite . in these methods",
    "the series is decomposed into cyclical , trend and error terms .",
    "the cyclical component is approximated by a fourier decomposition , trend with linear term and error is approximated using garch model .",
    "these models however do nt teach us anything about the dynamics of the system .",
    "further more garch models explode at prediction ranges larger than 11 days .    in this work we present for the first time the existence of a deterministic ode system describing the evolution of temperature from daily mean temperature time series data .",
    "section 2 describes the embeding procedure , section 3 describes the model fitting and shows results for forecasting 100 days forward .",
    "we assume that the time series are generated by a dynamical system of the form : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the inherent noise of the system which is assumed to be i.i.d .",
    "( independent , identically distributed ) .    and the observable has measurement noise :",
    "@xmath2    in order to obtain the dynamical system ,",
    "data has to be filtered first .",
    "we use high - dimensional projection and singular value decomposition ( svd )  @xcite to obtain the attractor from the principal directions .",
    "i.e. noise is projected to high dimensional manifold ( dimension 12 ) .",
    "singular value decomposition is carried out on the projection to obtain principal directions of attractor .",
    "this is then projected back to time series as clean signal , filter takes about 250 iterations to converge to clean signal .",
    "numerical analysis was carried out using the tisean package  @xcite .",
    "tisean is a nonlinear time series analysis package developed on the principles of  @xcite ,  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "we sampled mean daily temperature from a few stations .",
    "data was obtained from european weather center http://www.knmi.nl .",
    "each time series consists of 15000 terms .",
    "[ rawfiltered ] ,  [ rawfilteredzoomed ] and  [ rawfilteredhist ] show an excellent fitting of the filtered dynamical system to raw data .",
    "the first one depicting the original data vs. filtered on 2000 points for berlin , paris and tel - aviv respectively .",
    "the second figure shows the first 600 points of fig .",
    "[ rawfiltered ] , remarkable fit is obtained . the third , fig .",
    "[ rawfilteredhist ] shows the distribution of residuals : @xmath3 variances being 10.97 , 10.97 , 3.28 for berlin , paris and tel - aviv respectively .",
    "we are given the filtered time series @xmath4 from previous section which is assumed to be generated by (  [ dynsys ] ) , possesing an attractor @xmath5 with box dimension @xmath6 .",
    "whitney s embedding theorem  @xcite states that any smooth @xmath7 dimensional manifold can be embedded in @xmath8 euclidean space .",
    "i.e. no two points on the manifold map to the same point in @xmath9 takens theorem  @xcite extends whitney s theorem such that an attactor @xmath5 with box dimension @xmath6 can be embedded in @xmath10 dimensional euclidean space provided @xmath11 .",
    "i.e. there exists a diffeomorphism @xmath12 from @xmath5 into @xmath13 .",
    "the delay theorem states that using the delay vector : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the delay , reconstructs the system in @xmath13 if the dimension of system @xmath16 .",
    "hence 2 parameters govern the reconstruction of attractor , namely @xmath17 the delay and dimension of space .",

    "@xmath22 can also be defined using the convolution theorem : @xmath23 where : @xmath24 the decorrelation time @xmath15 has physical significance , it is defined as the time at which the phase of the wave has wandered significantly and the wave is no longer coherent .",
    "formally it is defined as the inverse of the spectral width of the signal .",
    "@xmath25    for deterministic monochromatic waves",
    "the decorrelation time is infinite . for white grassbergernoise : @xmath26",
    "decorrelation is immediate .",
    "we use false nearest neighbor analyis  @xcite to determine the proper embedding dimension .",
    "the idea is quite intuitive .",
    "suppose the minimal embedding dimension for a given time series i s @xmath27 .",
    "this means that in a @xmath27-dimensional delay space the reconstructed attractor is a one - to - one image of the attractor in the original phase space .",
    "especially , the topological properties are preserved .",
    "thus the neighbors of a given point are mapped onto neighbors in the delay space . due to the assumed smoothness of the dynamics , neighborhoods of the points",
    "are mapped onto neighborhoods again .",
    "of course the shape and the diameter of the neighborhoods is changed according to the lyapunov exponents . but suppose now you embed in an @xmath28-dimensional space with @xmath29 . due to this projection",
    "the topological structure is no longer preserved .",
    "points are projected into neighborhoods of other points to which they would nt belong in higher dimensions .",
    "these points are called false neighbors .",
    "if now the dynamics is applied , these false neighbors are not typically mapped into the image of the neighborhood , but somewhere else , so that the average `` diameter '' becomes quite large . for each point in the series",
    "we compute the nearest points and pick the one with the minimal euclidean distance and compute the distance in the next iteration .",
    "@xmath30 if @xmath31 exceeds a certain heuristic then @xmath32 is a false neighbor .",
