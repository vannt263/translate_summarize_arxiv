    "open clusters have long been used as a key galactic tracer to probe chemical and age distributions within the milky way disk ( e.g. , carraro & chiosi 1994 ; janes & phelps 1994 ) because they provide the most reliable ` age - datable ' population tracer at low latitudes . however , as traced by open clusters , the galactic abundance `` gradient '' has been fit by a single linear gradient , a 2-function gradient , a polynomial , or a step function .",

    "the verification of aspcap was conducted by comparing its results to those of optical high - resolution studies for stars in a set of `` calibration '' open and globular clusters ( mszros et al .",

    "= 10 ( zasowski et al .  2013 ) .      because of the large sdss field of view and the plan for apogee to observe all galactic populations , but with a particular focus on the galactic disk and bulge , the survey is targeting a large number of open clusters with a relatively small subset of the 300 fibers available per plate .",
    "to utilize these fibers efficiently , a new technique was developed to improve the chances of targeting cluster stars in these crowded , highly contaminated , low galactic latitude fields .",
    "this technique to isolate cluster stars from the general field uses spatial information ( color - magnitude comparisons within and outside of the cataloged cluster visual radius , @xmath16 ) combined with filtering by reddening as derived from the rayleigh - jeans color excess ( rjce ) technique ( majewski et al .",
    "2011 ) , which derives star - by - star extinctions ( @xmath17 ) that can be used to remove background and foreground stars this method takes advantage of the fact that all stars have ir 2mass and _",
    "spitzer_/irac and/or _ wise _ photometry .",
    "this ir photometry allows a direct assessment of the line - of - sight reddening to any particular star across wavelengths where the reddening law is nearly universal . at these wavelengths",
    "the color effects of reddening and stellar atmospheres are almost completely separable : the long wavelength spectral energy distributions of stars have the same rayleigh - jeans shape , equivalent to saying that the vega - based , _ intrinsic _ colors of all stars are nearly constant for the correct combination of filters .",
    "thus , the _ observed _ mid - ir colors contain information on the reddening to a star _",
    "explicitly _ , whereas the near ir colors contain information on the stellar types .",
    "the technique identifies the cluster @xmath18 by maximizing the number of stars within the cluster radius relative to the number `` outside '' ( @xmath19 ) of the cluster radius for a given range of @xmath18 ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "given the difference of area and the sometimes non - uniform background , we measure the `` outside '' sample in four areas ( shown in figure 1a ) and then have to normalize the count by the area of sky covered ( e.g. , sq . degrees )    stars that are isolated as above and that lie within the apogee standard color - magnitude cuts ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 for a standard 3-hr apogee field ) can then be selected as likely cluster members . for longer length apogee fields ,",
    "fainter stars can also be targeted ( down to @xmath23 for a 24-hr field ) .",
    "this cleaning is required in most clusters for two reasons : ( 1 ) most open clusters are at low galactic latitude and hence are heavily contaminated with field stars .",
    "( 2 ) due to the plate scale of the sdss telescope and the size of the fiber ferrules , the minimum fiber - to - fiber distance is fairly large ( @xmath24 arcmin ) , which allows for the targeting of only a handful of stars ( @xmath25 ) per cluster for the most distant , reddened clusters , which tend also to be the most poorly studied .",
    "this method is more fully described in frinchaboy et al .",
    ", _ in prep _ and zasowski et al .",
    "stars targeted by apogee using this method are flagged in the dr10 database by _",

    "we present a demonstration of this technique utilizing the cluster king 7 , shown in figure  [ fig : cl_example ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : cl_example]a shows the galactic latitude and longitude area explored by our analysis . as described above , we selected likely cluster members utilizing @xmath26 , as shown in figure  [ fig : cl_example]b . for king 7 , we find a moderate extinction to the cluster .",
    "the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of the cluster shown in figure  [ fig : cl_example]c highlights the member stars having @xmath26 values within the selected window of extinction , and the dashed box denotes the area of apogee s primary target selection ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) .",
    "finally , we compare our `` cleaned '' cluster cmd to the padova isochrone matching catalog cluster values ( dias et al .",
    "2002 ) for king 7 and find good agreement . by comparing the cmd with isochrone values , when available , we are able to isolate candidate open cluster stars with a high probability for membership .      to determine cluster membership , we have combined the apogee sample with the ucac-4 ( zacharias et al .",
    "2013 ) dataset and have used the 3d kinematical membership analysis from frinchaboy & majewski ( 2008 ) to derive membership probabilities for each star . for this analysis",

    "( 2002 , version 3.3 ) catalog based isochrone fit we assumed it was a member for this study . after determining kinematical membership , a 3@xmath30 iterative cut was made on the stellar metallicities to further remove any potential non - members .",
    "for this paper , we analyze only reliable open clusters , which comprise clusters having member stars that clearly lie near the cluster s cmd locus ( see figures 1 - 3 ) , have survey quality data in dr10 , and have no aspcap warning flags for the analyzed stars ( e.g. , @xmath31 k and for @xmath32 ) .",
    "the clusters presented here have a median of three cluster radial velocity members and one member star with reliable [ m / h ] and [ @xmath0/m ] .",
    "a fuller description and detailed analysis for all dr10 apogee open clusters will be presented in frinchaboy et al .",
    "_ in prep_. using the rv kinematic membership criteria we analyzed 546 stars , finding 141 member stars , in 28 open clusters whose bulk cluster parameters and metallicities presented in table 1 . for 22 of these clusters , table 1 presents the first measured high - resolution metallicity .",
    "this study increases the number of open clusters with published high - resolution metallicities by about 30% .",
    "after our membership census and after adopting the [ m / h ] derived from our analysis of the apogee data , we refit the cmd by eye with padova isochrones ( marigo et al .  2008 ) to measure the other fundamental cluster parameters ( age , distance , and reddeneing ; figure 2 , blue lines ) . for most clusters , the dias et al .",
