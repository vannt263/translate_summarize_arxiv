    "one of the main motivations for r - parity conserving supersymmetry ( susy ) is the prediction that the lightest susy particle ( lsp ) is stable and may be identified as a candidate thermal dark matter ( dm ) particle if it is both electrically neutral and colorless .",
    "quite commonly the role of the lsp is played by the lightest neutralino , @xmath0 , and this be will assumed in the discussion here . while dm searches are superficially focused on the nature of the lsp , the properties of all the other superparticles as well as those of the extended susy higgs sector also come into play .",
    "thus it is impossible to completely separate dm searches from searches for and the examination of the rest of the susy spectrum .",
    "however , even in the simplest susy scenario , the mssm , the number of free parameters ( @xmath1 100 ) is too large to study in all generality .",
    "the traditional approach is to assume the existence of a high - scale theory with only a few parameters ( such as msugra    @xcite ) from which all the properties of the sparticles at the tev scale can be determined and studied in detail .",
    "while such an approach is quite valuable  @xcite , these scenarios are somewhat phenomenologically limiting and are under increasing tension with a wide range of experimental data including , in some cases , the @xmath2 gev mass of the recently discovered higgs boson@xcite .",
    "one way to circumvent such limitations is to examine the far more general 19-parameter pmssm@xcite .",
    "the pmssm is the most general version of the r - parity conserving mssm when it is subjected to several experimentally - motivated constraints : ( @xmath3 ) cp conservation , ( @xmath4 ) minimal flavor violation at the electroweak scale , ( @xmath5 ) degenerate first and second generation sfermion masses , ( @xmath6 ) negligible yukawa couplings and a - terms for the first two generations .",
    "in particular , no assumptions are made about physics at high scales , e.g. , the nature of susy breaking , in order to capture electroweak scale phenomenology for which a uv - complete theory may not yet exist . imposing the constraints ( @xmath3)-(@xmath6 )",
    "decreases the number of free parameters in the mssm at the tev - scale from 105 to 19 for the case of a neutralino lsp , or 20 when the gravitino mass is included as an additional parameter when it plays the role of the lsp . we have recently begun a detailed study of the signatures for the pmssm at the 7 and 8 ( and eventually 14 ) tev lhc , supplemented by input from dm experiments as well as from precision electroweak and flavor measurements@xcite . in this work ,",
    "we study and compare the sensitivities of present and future experiments employing different approaches to searching for dark matter : collider production , direct and indirect detection .",
    "independently of the lsp type we will not assume that the thermal relic density as calculated for the lsp necessarily saturates the wmap / planck value@xcite to allow for the possibility of multi - component dm .",
    "for example , the axions introduced to solve the strong cp problem may may make up a substantial amount of dm .",
    "the 19 pmssm parameters and the ranges of values employed in our scans are listed in table  [ scanranges ] .",
    "the lower and upper limits employed in our scan ranges were chosen to be essentially consistent with tevatron and lep data and to have kinematically accessible sparticles at the lhc , respectively . to study the pmssm",
    ", we generate many millions of model points in this space ( using softsusy@xcite and checking for consistency using suspect@xcite ) , with each point corresponding to a specific set of values for these parameters .",
    "these individual models are then subjected to a large set of collider , flavor , precision measurement , dark matter and theoretical constraints  @xcite .",
    "roughly 225k models with a neutralino lsp survive this initial selection and can then be used for further physics studies .",
    "( we have also obtained a model set of similar size for the case of gravitino lsps . ) decay patterns of the susy partners and the extended higgs sector are calculated using a modified version of susy - hit@xcite .",
    "in addition to these two large pmssm model sets , we have recently generated a smaller , specialized neutralino lsp set of @xmath1 10k ` natural ' models all of which predict @xmath7 gev , have an lsp that _ does _ saturate the wmap relic density and which produce values of fine - tuning ( ft ) better than @xmath8 using the barbieri - giudice measure  @xcite .",
    "this low - ft model set will also be used in the future as part of our completed study .",
    ".scan ranges for the 19 ( 20 ) parameters of the pmssm with a neutralino ( gravitino ) lsp .",
    "the gravitino mass is scanned with a log prior .",
    "all other parameters are scanned with flat priors , though we expect this choice to have little qualitative impact on our results  @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     figure  [ fig1 ] shows some results demonstrating the power of this combination of lhc analyses to constrain the set of pmssm neutralino lsp models . in particular",
    "this figure shows the fraction of models with a given sparticle and lsp mass which are excluded by the combined lhc searches . since the masses of the squarks and gluinos ,",
    "the lightest stops and sbottoms and the lsp itself are currently of particular interest , we have concentrated on those quantities in this figure . in the upper left - hand panel",
    "the coverage of the gluino - lsp mass plane by the lhc searches is displayed ; the solid white line represents the simplified model @xmath9 cl search limit from atlas  @xcite which we see is roughly the same as the all - black region excluded in the pmssm .",
    "the upper right - hand panel shows the corresponding coverage in the gluino - lightest squark mass plane with the analogous simplified model line from atlas  @xcite ( which assumes a zero mass lsp and that the 8 squarks of the first two generations are degenerate , neither of which are necessarily true in the pmssm ) .",
    "while most models with rather light squarks and/or gluinos are observed to be excluded by the lhc searches , it is clear that models with both squarks and gluinos below @xmath10 gev still remain viable .",
    "the lower two panels show the lightest stop / sbottom vs. lsp mass plane with the corresponding atlas simplified model search limits  @xcite . here",
    "we see several things , the most important being that the amount of coverage of these two mass planes in the pmssm by the lhc searches is significantly larger than what we would have expected from either simplified model analysis .",
    "we also find that the third generation searches are ineffective for models that have a relatively small splitting between the stop and lsp ( @xmath11 130 gev ) , so the exclusion of these models relies almost entirely on the standard jets + met searches . in the uncompressed regions , on the other hand , the third generation searches significantly outperform jets + met , as expected .",
    "in particular , the @xmath12+met analysis is found to be responsible for nearly all of the exclusion power in this region .",
    "clearly , the third - generation searches cover important gaps in the standard jets + met coverage . in general , the third - generation searches are most sensitive to models in which stop or sbottom decays produce hard @xmath13-jets , and have a more difficult time observing models with stops or sbottoms that produce tops or decay to multiple intermediate gauginos ( resulting in softer @xmath13-jets and leptons ) .",
    "lastly we again stress that the direct sbottom search is found to be responsible for the majority of the heavy flavor search exclusion power for models with relatively light stops .",

    "we note that since the results of the 7 and 8 tev analyses are essentially independent of the higgs mass , it is quite likely that our results for this narrow higgs mass range would in fact be applicable , at least to a very good approximation , to the entire neutralino lsp model set .",

    "[ fig2 ] for both 0.3 and 3 ab@xmath14 of integrated luminosity in the gluino - lightest squark mass plane . here",
    "we see that for typical models , the 14 tev lhc will be able to exclude squarks up to @xmath1 1.6 tev and gluinos up to @xmath1 2.7 tev , with only 7.9 ( 2.5 ) percent of models surviving after 300 ( 3000 ) fb@xmath14 of data .",
    "a few models are seen to survive with much lighter squark and/or gluino masses ; in most cases these models survive by producing high-@xmath17 leptons and therefore falling outside of the 0-lepton search region , so adding other searches with leptons in the signal region will undoubtedly exclude many of the surviving models with light colored sparticles . to fully understand the capabilities of the 14 tev lhc will of course require a far more realistic study than is presently available since the lhc collaborations themselves are still unsure of how their detectors will perform at 14 tev with very high pileup conditions , and we can currently only simulate one of the 14 tev search channels ( although this search is the most powerful at 7/8 tev and is expected to dominate the 14 tev exclusions as well ) .",

    "however , as the lower bounds on the first and second generation squark masses from the lhc become stronger the importance of these squark exchange contributions clearly become subdominant .",

    "figure  [ fig3 ] displays the predicted experimentally observable si and sd cross sections for our pmssm model set together with several present and anticipated future experimental constraints .",
    "note that the actual cross sections are appropriately scaled by the factor @xmath26 to account for the fact that most of our pmssm models lead to a thermal relic density somewhat below that which saturates the wmap value as discussed in the introduction .",
    "there are several things to note in this figure : ( @xmath3 ) future si searches will cut rather deeply into the model set ; a lack of signal at xenon1 t ( lz ) would exclude 23% ( 50% ) of these models .",
    "_ however _ , this implies that about half of our models are not accessible to si experiments due to their rather small scaled cross sections , @xmath27 .",
    "models with these values of @xmath27 tend to produce these small values due to both the suppression arising from their low thermal relic density as well as fact that the lsps tend to be rather close to being pure weak eigenstates as discussed above .",
    "note that if we only consider models which predict a relic density within 10% of the critical density , the situation improves significantly , with 60% ( 87% ) of models within the xenon1 t ( lz ) exclusion limit .",
    "( @xmath4 ) sd measurements are still rather far from the pmssm model predictions and we do not expect future sd measurements to have a significant impact on the parameter space ; sd experiments such as coupp500 will only be able to exclude @xmath28 of the models in this set if no signal is seen .    while direct detection experiments have significant power to cover much of the pmssm , clearly such experiments will need to be ` supplemented ' if we want to discover or exclude the full range of neutralino lsps in the pmssm model space . in the next two sections , we describe constraints on the pmssm from indirect detection and neutrino telescope experiments .",
    "indirect detection plays a critical role in searches for dm and , in the case of null results , can lead to very strong constraints on the pmssm parameter space . as will be seen below , both _",
    "fermi _  and cta can contribute in different regions of the pmssm parameter space in the future .",

    "fermi _ ,  on the other hand , will be seen to be mostly sensitive to well - tempered neutralinos that are relatively light .    the most promising dm targets for both _ fermi",
    "_  lat and cta are those with both a high dm density and low astrophysical gamma - ray foregrounds .",
    "these criteria have motivated a number of galactic and extragalactic targets including the galactic center ( gc ) , dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsphs ) , and galaxy clusters .",
    "the expected gamma - ray signal for dm annihilations is proportional to the integral of the square of the dm density along the line of sight to the source ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "the determination of @xmath29 is most reliable for dm - dominated objects such as dsphs and galaxy clusters in which the dm distribution can be robustly measured . in the milky way halo the uncertainty on the dm distribution rapidly increases as one approaches the inner galaxy where baryons dominate the gravitational potential .",
    "kinematic data at large scales constrain the density of dm at the solar radius to 0.20.4  gev  @xmath30 @xcite .    under well - motivated models for the dm distribution in the galactic halo ,",
    "the gc is expected to be the most intense dm source in the sky .",
    "cdm simulations predict that the galactic dm halo should have a density profile with an inner cusp , @xmath31 with @xmath32 . for an extrapolation of the galactic dm density profile with @xmath33 , the expected dm signal from the gc region",
    "is approximately two orders of magnitude greater than dsphs or galaxy clusters .",
    "however the gc is also the region of the sky with the highest density of gamma - ray sources and brightest diffuse gamma - ray emission produced from the interaction of cosmic rays with the interstellar medium .",
    "these foregrounds significantly limit the sensitivity of the _ fermi_-lat in the inner galaxy and complicate the interpretation of any observed signals . for our study of _",
    "we focus on the sensitivity to the dm signal from dsphs which are predominantly at high galactic latitudes where the astrophysical foregrounds are much weaker . above 50  gev the diffuse emission from the galaxy is much less intense relative to other backgrounds than in the _ fermi_-lat sensitivity band .",
    "the inner galaxy is thus the preferred target for cta under the assumption that the galactic dm halo possesses an inner cusp with @xmath32 .",

    "we calculate a joint likelihood to constrain the annihilation cross section of each pmssm model given the lat observations coincident with the ten dsphs .",
    "following a11 , we incorporated statistical uncertainties in the j - factors of the dsphs as nuisance parameters in our likelihood formulation  ( see equation 1 and the associated discussion in a11 ) .",
    "this likelihood formulation includes both the flux normalizations of background @xmath35-ray sources ( diffuse and point - like ) and the associated dsph j - factors and statistical uncertainties .",
    "no significant @xmath35-ray signal is detected from any of the dsphs when analyzed individually or jointly for any of the pmssm models .",
    "for each of the pmssm models , we calculate the maximum annihilation cross section , @xmath38 , consistent with the null detection in the lat data .",
    "we incorporate nuisance parameters to obtain a 95% one - sided confidence interval on the value of @xmath34using the profile likelihood method  @xcite .",
    "this one - sided 95% confidence limit on @xmath34serves as our value of @xmath38 , which is compared to the true value of the annihilation cross section for each pmssm model .",

    "background dominated regime , the lat point source sensitivity increases as roughly the square - root of the integration time .",
    "however , in the high - energy , limited background regime ( where many pmssm models contribute ) , the lat sensitivity increases more linearly with integration time .",
    "thus , 10 years of data could provide a factor of @xmath40 to 5 increase in sensitivity .",
    "additionally , optical surveys such as pan - starrs  @xcite , the dark energy survey  @xcite , and lsst  @xcite could provide a factor of 3 increase in the number of milky way dsphs corresponding to an increased constraining power of @xmath41 to 3  @xcite .",
    "ongoing improvements in lat event reconstruction , a better understanding of background contamination , and an increased energy range are all expected to provide additional increases in the lat sensitivity .",
    "thus , we find it plausible that the lat constraints could improve by a factor of 10 compared to current constraints .",
    "in figure  [ fig4 ] we display the boost required to constrain the various pmssm models at @xmath9 cl based on the _",

    "here we see that the lat analysis does not currently constrain any of our pmssm models .",

    "in particular we see that the i d searches ( here almost entirely cta ) are covering the heavy lsp region even in cases where the si cross section is very low and likely beyond the reach of any potential dd experiment .",
    "similarly , in the upper right panel we see that 22% ( 0% ) of the models are excluded uniquely by dd ( icecube ) only while 1% can be simultaneously excluded by both sets of searches and 77% would be missed by either search set . in the lower left panel ,",
    "i d and lhc searches are compared and we see that 17% ( 35% ) of the models would be excluded only by the i d ( lhc ) searches . however , 2% ( 47% ) of the models are seen to be excluded by ( or would survive ) both searches .",
    "the strong complementarity between the lhc , cta and xenon1 t experiments is evident here as cta probes the high lsp mass region very well where winos and higgsinos dominate , xenon1 t chops off the top of the distribution where the well - tempered neutralino lsp states dominate , and the lhc covers the relatively light lsp region ( independent of lsp type ) rather well .",
    "of course the strength of the lhc coverage will significantly improve when 14 tev searches are included , as we will see below . in the lower right panel",
    "the relative contributions arising from the lhc and cta searches to the model survival / exclusion are shown . here",
    "the intensity of a given bin indicates the fraction of models excluded there by the combination of both cta and the lhc while the color itself indicates the weighting from cta ( blue ) and lhc ( red ) .",
    "it is again quite clear that cta completely dominates for large lsp masses ( which correspond to the mostly wino and higgsino lsps ) and also competes with the lhc throughout the band along the top of the distribution where the lsp thermal relic density is approximately saturating wmap / planck .",
    "the lhc covers the rest of the region but is not yet as effective as cta ( excluding a smaller fraction of models in the relevant bins ) .                in order to study the complementarity arising from the various searches in more detail",
    ", we found that it is very useful to project their individual capabilities onto several sets of fixed parameter planes that are directly related to one of the search categories .",
    "we begin these projections with fig .",
    "[ figyy1 ] which compares the various search capabilities in the familiar lsp mass - scaled si cross section plane , most relevant for the si dd searches , as defined by the fraction of models excluded in the various bins .",
    "here we see the contributions to the search coverage coming uniquely from cta ( top left ) , the lhc ( top right ) , icecube ( bottom left ) and _ fermi _  ( bottom right ) and also show the limit that could arise from xenon1 t for comparison . here",
    "we see that both icecube and _ fermi _  probe models with low lsp masses and large si cross sections , where the lsp tends to be a bino - higgsino admixture ; this region is also accessible to the dd experiments such as xenon1 t . on the other hand",
    ", cta has access to the heavy lsp region , where there are a large fraction of relatively pure winos and higgsinos , while the lhc coverage is concentrated ( for now ) on the relatively low mass lsp region .",
    "interestingly , the lhc searches are not independent of the si cross - section ; a region of enhanced exclusion fraction is seen for si cross sections near @xmath69 pb . models with cross sections in this region mostly have wino - like lsps with light squarks ; wino - like lsps with heavier squarks have a lower si cross - section , while higgsinos and mixed states tend to have a higher si cross - section whether or not light squarks are present .",
    "annihilation into @xmath70 final states only.,title=\"fig:\",width=336 ]   annihilation into @xmath70 final states only.,title=\"fig:\",width=336 ]     annihilation into @xmath70 final states only.,title=\"fig:\",width=336 ]    annihilation into @xmath70 final states only.,title=\"fig:\",width=336 ]    taking these same results we can now project them in to the plane which is most relevant for dm i d searches . fig .",
    "[ figyy2 ] compares the various search capabilities as above but now in the lsp mass - lsp pair annihilation cross section plane , for which both _ fermi _  and cta are directly applicable . here",
    "we see the fraction of models that would be excluded by searches at cta ( top left ) , the lhc ( top right ) , icecube ( bottom left ) and xenon1 t ( bottom right ) . the potential bounds from _ fermi _  and cta are also shown in all cases as curves penetrating through the upper left and right parts of the figures , respectively . here",
    "the dashed ( solid ) curves correspond to the limit obtained when the lsp pair annihilation final state is exclusively @xmath70 ; we emphasize that a generic lsp in a pmssm model may annihilate to many different final states beyond these two cases .",
    "note again that cta is primarily sensitive to models with lsp mass above 100 gev and with @xmath34relatively close to the thermal relic value .",
    "as in the previous figure , the lhc is mainly effective in the lower lsp mass region .",
    "in addition , the lhc searches are seen to be particularly efficient along a thin line starting at annihilation cross sections of @xmath71 for 100 gev lsps and increasing with lsp mass ; this line corresponds to models with a pure wino lsp , which are subject to strong constraints from searches for heavy stable charged particles at the lhc .",
    "( note that this line is below the projected reach of the i d searches for lsp masses accessible to the current lhc searches . )",
    "icecube is seen to nicely complement cta in the region with large cross sections but low lsp masses .",
    "the projection of the xenon1 t coverage onto this plane is interesting with most of the exclusion appearing at lower lsp masses where the lsp pair annihilation cross section is also large .",
    "however , there is also an extended , somewhat diffuse region of substantial coverage throughout the entire right half of the parameter space as well as on the @xmath72 funnel ` island ' at small lsp masses .                    as a final example of these projections , we now consider the thermal relic density - lsp mass plane ;",
    "the relic density plays a ` linear ' role in the dd searches but a ` quadratic ' one in the i d case ( and none at all as far as the lhc is concerned ) . in fig .",
    "[ figyy3 ] we display the coverage comparisons for the various experiments : cta , lhc , icecube , xenon1 t and _ fermi _ ,  respectively .",
    "again we see that multiple searches can make overlapping contributions in various parts of this parameter space plane .",
    "these plots show several things : first , cta , as expected , does an excellent job at accessing most of the models with lsp masses above @xmath73 gev that saturate the relic density .",
    "however , for larger masses the cta coverage extends down to relic densities as much as a factor of @xmath42 or so below the wmap / planck value .",
    "_ fermi _   is seen to cover only the low lsp mass region with relic densities not far from the thermal value while icecube can go to much lower relic densities provided the lsp mass is below @xmath74 gev or so .",
    "xenon1 t displays coverage throughout this plane but does best for lsp masses below @xmath75 gev , providing coverage even for models with very low relic densities .",
    "of course , even for masses up to 1 - 2 tev , xenon1 t still provides quite decent model coverage in this parameter plane . as noted already , most of the impact of the lhc is at present seen to be at lower lsp masses below @xmath74 gev .",
    "the lhc coverage is relatively uniform as far as the value of the relic density is concerned except in the case of very light lsps where the coverage is very strong . of course",
    ", we again remind the reader that extending the lhc energy to 14 tev will substantially improve its effectiveness for excluding heavy lsps .    .",
    ", width=672 ]    finally , fig .",
    "[ figzz ] shows the impact of combining all of the different searches in this same @xmath76-lsp mass plane which should be compared with that for the original model set as generated that is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig00 ] . here",
    "we see that ( @xmath3 ) the models that were in the light @xmath77 and @xmath25-funnel regions have essentially evaporated ( and further measurements of the invisible width of higgs as well as the standard susy searches will likely further restrict these ) , ( @xmath4 ) the well - tempered neutralinos are now seen to be completely gone , mostly due to xenon1 t and icecube ; ( @xmath5 ) the possibility of almost pure higgsino or wino lsps even approximately saturating the relic density has vanished thanks to cta and ( @xmath78 the mixed wino - higgsino models , due to a combination of measurements , have also completely disappeared .",
    "( @xmath79 ) the only models remaining which _ do _ saturate the wmap / planck relic density are those with binos with resonant or co - annihilations .",
    "( @xmath80 ) we find that @xmath81 of all the pmssm models have been excluded by at least one of the searches considered in this paper .",
    "we now consider the effect of adding the 14 tev jets + met search with 300 fb@xmath14 of integrated luminosity to the full set of 7 + 8 tev searches , considering only the subset of models with @xmath82 gev .",
    "we note that both the lhc and dark matter results are essentially independent of the higgs mass , so that the results for this subset should reproduce the results we would get for the full model set , albeit with lower statistics .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ 14tevcomp ] shows the reach of the combined lhc searches in the lsp mass - si cross - section plane for models with @xmath82 gev . comparing this figure to the upper right panel of figure  [ figyy1 ]",
    ", we see two key changes with the inclusion of the 14 tev search .",
    "first , in both cases the effectiveness of the lhc searches is seen to fall off sharply above a particular lsp mass , since above this limit the spectrum is generically either too heavy or too compressed to observe . adding the 14 tev searches effectively doubles this cutoff , from @xmath1 700 gev to @xmath1 1400 gev , so that most lsps in our model set are now accessible given colored sparticle masses below @xmath1 2 - 3 tev .",
    "second , we see that the lhc now excludes a very high fraction ( but not all ) of the models with lsps lighter than the aforementioned cutoff .",
    "the large fraction of models which are excluded with 14 tev data is unsurprising , since our chosen upper limits for the sparticle masses were designed to ensure that most models would be ( at least kinematically ) accessible at the 14 tev lhc .     for models with the correct higgs mass , shown in the lsp mass - scaled si cross section plane ( left panel ) and a comparison between the fractions excluded by the lhc and cta in this plane ( right panel ) .",
    "the potential si bound from xenon1 t is also shown in all cases.,title=\"fig:\",width=336 ]   for models with the correct higgs mass , shown in the lsp mass - scaled si cross section plane ( left panel ) and a comparison between the fractions excluded by the lhc and cta in this plane ( right panel ) .",
    "the potential si bound from xenon1 t is also shown in all cases.,title=\"fig:\",width=336 ]    the right panel of figure  [ 14tevcomp ] shows a comparison between the reaches of the lhc and cta in this plane , analogous to the lower right panel of figure  [ figxx ] .",
    "we see that the lhc and cta sensitivities now exhibit a sizable region of overlap .",
    "however , the blue region on the far right edge of the plot shows that cta will still be sensitive to lsp masses beyond the reach of the lhc .",
    "we also note that lsps heavy enough to be seen by cta are generally too heavy to be seen in direct ( e.g. monojet ) searches , meaning that the lhc is excluding these models by observing other ( mostly colored ) sparticles .",
    "it is therefore important to note that cta has the potential to exclude winos and higgsinos with nearly thermal relic densities regardless of the characteristics of the rest of the sparticle spectrum .",
    "of course , the improved reach of the lhc means that there is also an increasing overlap between the lhc and xenon 1 t , however we see that ( as before ) the lhc searches are mostly independent of the si cross - section ( the white areas around the edges of the plot generally result from low statistics in those regions ) . of course",
    ", from a discovery perspective , the increased overlap means that there is more potential for a signal to be observed by two , or even all three , experiments , which would greatly aid in characterizing the lsp and model properties .",
    "finally , we note that not only has the total fraction of models excluded by the combined experiments increased dramatically ( from 63% to 97.4% ) as a result of the improved lhc reach , but the fraction of models not seen by the lhc which are excluded by direct or indirect detection has increased ( from 41% to 49% ) , since more of the undetected models have heavy lsps and are therefore likely to be excluded by cta .",
    "the results presented here are preliminary but directly lead us to a number of interesting conclusions which are already quite clear and which we expect to strengthen in the future :    * even if the lsp _ does not _ make up all of the dm , it can still be observed in both direct and indirect detection experiments as well as in neutrino experiments such as icecube .",
    "of course , searches at the lhc are not influenced by the lsp relic density .",
    "* the set of models remaining after all the searches are performed that saturate the thermal relic density consist only of those with ( co)annihilating bino lsps . * si direct detection , cta , and the lhc do most of the heavy lifting in terms of complementary searches covering the pmssm parameter space .",
    "* multiple / overlapping searches allow for extensive parameter space coverage which will be of particular importance if a dm signal is observed . *",
    "most of the experiments are seen to provide complementary probes of the pmssm parameter space .",
    "* the strength of the lhc component in these searches increases significantly with the inclusion of the 14 tev lhc jets + met search .",
    "however , the jets + met search is dependent on the rest of the model spectrum and therefore does not provide complete coverage of any given lsp scenario , in contrast to dm searches which rely more directly on the lsp properties .    in summary",
    ", the pmssm provides an excellent tool for studying complementarity between different approaches to the search for dark matter .",
