    "up to the present , a great deal of empirical analyses have pointed out the existence of non - gaussian activities lying in time - varying phenomena such as the log - return of stock prices , the spike noise of neurons , and so on . to incorporate them into statistical modeling , lvy processes , which can be interpreted as a natural continuous time version of random walks , are regarded as crucial components .",
    "hence the statistical theory of the stochastic differential equation driven ( sde ) by them ( including themselves as a matter of course ) based on high - frequency samples has been developed so far . since its genuine likelihood",
    "can not generally be obtained in a closed form , many other feasible ways have been considered , for instance , the threshold based estimation for jump diffusion models by @xcite and @xcite , the least absolute deviation ( lad)-type estimation for lvy driven ornstein - uhlenbeck models by @xcite , the non - gaussian stable quasi - likelihood estimation for locally stable driven sde models by @xcite , and the least square estimation for small lvy driven sde models by @xcite . these literatures assume the precise structure of their driving noises . as for the methods not assuming it , we refer to the gaussian quasi - likelihood ( gql ) based estimation schemes proposed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , all of the above studies premise that the data - generating model is correctly specified even though the risk of model misspecification is essentially inevitable .",
    "it should be considered in the deviation of the asymptotic properties of estimators and estimating functions such as for ensuring the reliability of the statistical methods and comparing candidate models . in this paper , we give the theoretical framework of the parametric inference for misspecified lvy driven sde models based on high - frequency samples for the first time .",
    "let @xmath0 be the one - dimensional stochastic process defined on the complete filtered probability space @xmath1 such that @xmath2 where :    * @xmath3 is a one - dimensional cdlg lvy process without wiener part .",
    "it is independent of the initial variable @xmath4 and satisfies @xmath5=0 $ ] , @xmath6=1 $ ] , and @xmath7<\\infty$ ] for all @xmath8 ; * the coefficients @xmath9 and @xmath10 are lipschitz continuous ; * @xmath11 .",
    "we suppose that the observations @xmath12 are obtained from the solution path @xmath0 in the so - called  rapidly increasing experimental design \" , that is , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "we consider the following parametric one - dimensional sde model : @xmath16 where the functional forms of the coefficients @xmath17 and @xmath18 are supposed to be known except for a finite - dimensional unknown parameter @xmath19 being an element of the bounded convex domain @xmath20 . here",
    "the true coefficients @xmath21 are not necessarily in the parametric family @xmath22 , namely , the coefficients are possibly misspecified .",
    "under such situation , we adopt the staged gaussian quasi - likelihood estimation procedure used in @xcite to estimate an _ optimal _",
    "value @xmath23 of @xmath24 .",
    "optimality _ is herein determined by minimizing the kullback - leibler ( kl ) divergence like quantities and below ; they are the probability limits of the staged gql .",
    "hereinafter , the terminologies  misspecified \" and  misspecification \" will be used for the misspecification with respect to the coefficient unless another meaning is specifically indicated .",
    "concerning misspecified ergodic diffusion models , it is shown in @xcite that although the misspecification with respect to their diffusion term deteriorates the convergence rate of the scale ( diffusion ) parameter , the gaussian quasi - maximum likelihood estimator ( gqmle ) still has asymptotic normality . in the paper , the differential equations endowed with their infinitesimal generator ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) is the key to derive the behavior of the gqmle .",
    "however , since the infinitesimal generator of @xmath0 contains the integro - operator with respect to the lvy measure of @xmath3 , it is difficult to verify the existence and regularity of the corresponding equation . to avoid such obstacle , we will substantially invoke the theory of the extended poisson equation ( epe ) for homogeneous feller markov processes established in @xcite . applying the result of @xcite for , the existence and weighted hlder regularity of the solution of epes",
    "will be derived under a mighty mixing condition on @xmath0 .",
    "building on the result , we will provide the asymptotic normality of our staged gqmle and its tail probability estimates under sufficient regularity and moment conditions on the ingredients of and . here",
    "we note that the absence of wiener part in is essential while it is not in the correctly specified case , for more details , see remark [ conj ] .    .gql",
    "approach for ergodic diffusion models and ergodic lvy driven sde models [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ comp ]    it will turn out that the convergence rate of the scale parameters is @xmath25 , and it is the same as the correctly specified case , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this is different from the diffusion case ( cf .",
    "table [ comp ] ) .",
    "such difference may be caused from applying the gql to non - gaussian driving noises , that is , the efficiency loss of the gqmle may occur even in the correctly specified case .",
    "indeed , the non - gaussian stable quasi - likelihood is known to estimate the drift and scale parameters faster than the gqmle in correctly specified locally @xmath26-stable driven sde models ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) ; each of their convergence rates are @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "further , for correctly specified locally @xmath26-stable driven ornstein - uhlenbeck models , the lad - type estimators of @xcite tend to the true value at the speed of @xmath27 and it is also faster than that of the gqmle .",
    "however , in exchange for its efficiency , the gql approach is worth considering by the following reasons :    * it does not include any special functions ( e.g. bessel function , whittaker function , and so on ) , infinite expansion series and analytically unsolvable integrals , thus computation based on it is not relatively time - consuming . *",
    "it focuses only on the ( conditional ) mean and covariance structure , thus it does not need so much restriction on the driving noise and is robust against the noise misspecification . in other words , we can construct reasonable estimators of the drift and scale coefficients in the unified way if only the driving lvy noise has moments of any order .",
    "our result ensures that even if the coefficients are misspecified , the gql still works for lvy driven sde models and completely inherits its merit written in above .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in section [ es ] , we introduce our estimation procedure and assumptions . section [ main ] provides our main results in the following turn :    1 .",
    "the tail probability estimates of the gqmle ; 2 .   the existence and weighted hlder regularity of the solution of epes for lvy driven sdes ; 3 .",
    "the asymptotic normality of the gqmle at @xmath25-rate .    a simple numerical experiment is presented in section [ ne ] .",
    "we give all proofs of our results in section [ ap ] .",
    "for notational convenience , we will use the following symbols without any mention :    * @xmath29 is referred to as a differential operator for any variable @xmath30 .",
    "* @xmath31 implies that there exists a positive constant @xmath32 being independent of @xmath33 satisfying @xmath34 for all large enough @xmath33 . *",

    "@xmath45 $ ] denotes the conditional expectation with respect to @xmath46 .",
    "we define our staged gqmle @xmath47 in the following manner :    1 .   _ drift - free estimation of @xmath48 . _ [ step1 ] define the maximizing - type estimator ( so - called @xmath49-estimator ) @xmath50 by @xmath51 for the @xmath52-valued random function @xmath53 2 .   _ weighted least square estimation of @xmath54 .",

    "we define an _ optimal _ value @xmath62 of @xmath24 by @xmath63 we assume that @xmath23 is unique , and that it is in the interior of @xmath64 .",
    "[ decay ] although our estimation method ignores the drift term in the first stage , the effect of it asymptotically vanishes .",
    "this is because the scale term dominates the small time behavior of @xmath0 in @xmath65-sense .",
    "specifically , we can derive @xmath66\\lesssim h_n f^2_{j-1 } , \\quad e^{j-1}\\left[\\left(\\intj g_{s}(\\theta)ds\\right)^2\\right]\\lesssim h_n^2 g^2_{j-1},\\ ] ] for suitable functions @xmath40 and @xmath67 .",
    "indeed , it has already been shown that the asymptotic behavior of the scale estimator constructed by our manner is the same as the conventional gql estimator in the case of correctly specified ergodic diffusion models ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) and ergodic lvy driven sde models ( cf .",
    "such ignorance should be helpful in reducing the number of simultaneous optimization parameters , thus our estimators are expected to numerically be more stabilized and their calculation should be less time - consuming .",
    "moreover , by choosing appropriate functional forms , each estimation stage is reduced to a convex optimization problem .",
    "for example , if @xmath68 and @xmath69 are linear and log - linear with respect to parameters , respectively , then the above argument holds . as for other candidates of @xmath70 and details ,",
    "see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* example 3.8 ) .    from the functional form of @xmath71 and @xmath72 , the maximizers of them correspond with the true parameters in the correctly specified case .",
    "hence an intuitive interpretation of @xmath23 is the parameter value which yields the closest model to the data - generating model measured by the kl divergence like quantities and .",
    "the estimation procedure at the first stage can be regarded as stein s loss function ( or jensen - bregman logdet divergence ) based estimation , too .",
    "thus @xmath23 can also be interpreted as the minimizer of each expected loss ( stein s loss and a weighted @xmath65 loss ) with respect to @xmath61 .    to derive our asymptotic results , we introduce some assumptions below .",
