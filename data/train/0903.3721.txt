    "deuteron stripping and pickup reactions @xmath0 and @xmath1 constitute an important tool for extracting nuclear structure information such as spectroscopic factors or spin / parity .",
    "of special interest are cases involving exotic weakly bound systems such as one - neutron halo nuclei assumed to consist of a core with a mass number @xmath4 and a neutron @xmath5 ; well known examples are @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath6 .",
    "the reaction @xmath7 and its time reverse @xmath8 may therefore be described in a three - body model @xmath9 .",
    "these reactions have been analyzed by several approximate methods such as distorted - wave born approximation ( dwba ) and various dwba - type adiabatic approaches @xcite or continuum - discretized coupled - channels ( cdcc ) method @xcite .",
    "recently , also the application of exact three - body faddeev / alt , grassberger , and sandhas ( ags ) scattering theory @xcite to three - body nuclear reactions has become possible @xcite due to a novel implementation @xcite of the screening and renormalization method @xcite for including the long - range coulomb force between charged particles .",
    "faddeev / ags framework , though being technically and computationally most complicated and expensive , has an advantage that , once numerically well - converged results are obtained , all discrepancies with the experimental data can be attributed solely to the shortcomings of the used optical potentials ( op ) or to the inadequacy of the three - body model .",
    "recent comparison @xcite of faddeev / ags and cdcc results revealed that cdcc is indeed a reliable method to calculate @xmath10 elastic and breakup cross sections but may lack accuracy for transfer reactions such as @xmath11 .",
    "no benchmark with adiabatic approaches is performed yet .",
    "furthermore , the nonlocal optical potential ( nlop ) , so far , has been included only in the faddeev / ags framework @xcite where an important effect of the op nonlocality was found in deuteron stripping on @xmath12 and @xmath13 , improving the description of the experimental data .",
    "therefore we expect the op nonlocality to be significant also in transfer reactions on one - neutron halo nuclei which we aim to study in the present work using momentum - space ags equations .",
    "the theoretical framework is shortly recalled in sec .",
    "[ sec : th ] .",

    "the ags equations @xcite @xmath14 are a system of faddeev - like coupled integral equations for the transition operators @xmath15 ; their on - shell matrix elements @xmath16 at the available three - particle energy @xmath17 are amplitudes for all scattering processes ( elastic , inelastic , transfer , breakup ) allowed by the chosen hamiltonian @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the free hamiltonian and @xmath20 the potential for the pair @xmath21 in odd - man - out notation . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : uba ] ) @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the free resolvent , and @xmath24 is the two - particle transition matrix .",
    "the channel states @xmath25 for @xmath26 are the eigenstates of the corresponding channel hamiltonian @xmath27 with the energy eigenvalue @xmath17 ; thus , @xmath25 is a product of the bound state wave function for pair @xmath21 and a plane wave with fixed on - shell momentum @xmath28 corresponding to the relative motion of particle @xmath21 and pair @xmath21 in the initial or final state .",
    "the ags equations ( [ eq : uba ] ) are applicable only to short - range interactions .",
    "nevertheless , the long - range coulomb force between charged particles can be included in this framework using the method of screening and renormalization @xcite where one has to solve ags equations with nuclear plus screened coulomb potential to obtain the coulomb - distorted short - range part of the transition amplitude ; the convergence of the results with the screening radius has to be established .",
    "the method has been successfully applied to proton - deuteron elastic scattering and breakup @xcite and to direct nuclear reactions dominated by three - body degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "we use momentum - space partial - wave basis .",
    "the screened coulomb potential and most of the nuclear potentials are given in coordinate space ; they have to be transformed to the momentum space where local and nonlocal potentials are treated in the same manner .",
    "the ags equations then become a system of integral equations with two continuous variables which are the absolute values of jacobi momenta .",
    "the technique of numerical solution is described in refs .",
    "the dynamic input to ags equations are the potentials @xmath20 for the three pairs of particles . for the @xmath29 interaction",
    "we take the realistic cd bonn potential @xcite . in order to describe reactions involving one - neutron halo nucleus",
    "we need a real @xmath30 potential that reproduces the bound state spectrum of nucleus @xmath31 .",
    "this is a standard choice in @xmath32 reactions where the @xmath33 potential is complex and is taken at the proton lab energy . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath7 and @xmath34 reactions are related by time reversal provided the energy in the center of mass ( c.m . ) system is the same . therefore we can calculate the latter one using the standard hamiltonian with the nucleus @xmath31 being in its ground or excited state and apply the detailed balance to obtain the observables for the former one .",
    "this is equivalent to calculating the @xmath7 transfer with a real @xmath30 potential and complex @xmath33 interaction which is a nonstandard choice .",
    "nevertheless , it provides quite a reasonable description of the @xmath10 elastic scattering , as demonstrated in ref .",

    "@xcite we checked that the op nonlocality effect observed in transfer reactions is insensitive to small variations of the parameter @xmath78 and therefore is not a consequence of only approximate on - shell equivalence between nlop and watson op .",
