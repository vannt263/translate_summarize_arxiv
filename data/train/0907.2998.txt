    "among the main tasks of the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) will be the uncovering of the mechanism which provides particles with their masses . a crucial role in this respect",
    "is assigned to the higgs boson whose discovery is awaited with great eagerness .    at lhc the standard model higgs boson is mainly produced in the so - called gluon fusion process where two gluons couple via a closed quark loop to the higgs boson .",
    "the leading order ( lo ) process for this channel has been evaluated in refs .",
    "@xcite and already almost 15 years ago also the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) corrections became available  @xcite . to this order",
    "the production cross section could be evaluated without any assumption on the hierarchy between the mass of the quark in the loop , the higgs boson mass , and the partonic center - of - mass energy .    on the contrary , at next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo )",
    "only quantum corrections involving the top quark yukawa coupling are available",
    ". it has been performed under the assumption that the top quark is much heavier than the higgs boson . in this limit",
    "it is suggestive to construct an effective theory where the top quark is integrated out .",

    "@xcite ( see also ref.@xcite ) and the production cross section has been evaluated in refs .",
    "let us mention that recently the virtual contributions to the nnnlo corrections have been completed  @xcite .",
    "in this letter we provide the first results beyond the effective - theory approach where three building blocks are required to nnlo : virtual three - loop corrections to the @xmath2 process , two - loop corrections to the @xmath3 process where next to the higgs boson a parton is radiated off , and one - loop corrections with radiation of two additional partons .",
    "we present results for the three - loop virtual corrections to the process @xmath4 including finite top quark mass effects .",
    "our results constitute a building block for the nnlo corrections beyond the heavy top quark limit .",
