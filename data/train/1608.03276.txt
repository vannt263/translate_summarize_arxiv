    "the gauge group is su(@xmath13 ) and @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) are @xmath16 hermitian matrices .",
    "we consider t hooft large-@xmath13 limit , @xmath17 , and the radius of the s@xmath18 is set to 1 .",
    "if the conjecture is correct , then the dual gravity description suggests the following behavior in phase diagram of the microcanonical ensemble at strong coupling ( see e.g. sec .",
    "3.4.1 of @xcite ) :    * when the energy @xmath19 is large enough , a large ads - bh , which fills the s@xmath4 direction , is formed .",
    "the energy scales as @xmath20 at high temperature @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the ten - dimensional newton constant and the ads radius , respectively .",
    "note that the large ads - bh has a positive specific heat . * the large ads - bh shrinks as the energy",
    "is decreased and the temperature goes down .",
    "when the schwarzschild radius becomes of order @xmath23 , the bh localizes along the s@xmath4 and can be regarded as a ten - dimensional bh .",
    "this transition is of first order @xcite , and the bh becomes hotter after the localization .",
    "when the schwarzschild radius becomes much smaller than @xmath23 , the bh should behave like the ten - dimensional schwarzschild bh in flat spacetime , @xmath24 .",
    "we will call this localized bh , the small bh . note that the small bh has a negative specific heat . * as the small bh shrinks towards the string scale , the description of it as a bunch of long strings become better .",
    "the system shows the famous hagedorn behavior , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the entropy and @xmath27 is the length of the strings . * finally ,",
    "when the energy is very small , the system is well described as a gas of short strings .",
    "the relation between the energy and temperature is shown in fig .",
    "[ phase_diagram ] .",
    "although the gauge / gravity duality conjecture has not been proven , there is accumulating evidence that it is most likely correct",
    ". hence the majority of string theorists believe that 4d sym has the same phase diagram .",
    "it is crucial however to understand this phase diagram directly from the gauge theory for several reasons .",
    "first of all , the duality has been poorly tested at finite temperature . as far as we know , the only quantitative tests currently understood@xcite , are for the duality @xcite between the type iia black zero - brane and d0-brane quantum mechanics @xcite , which is analogous to the large ads - bh in 4d @xmath0 sym .",
    "hence we need to test gauge / gravity duality for a small bh . furthermore",
    ", if we use the duality to understand the quantum gravitational aspects of black holes , we have to solve gauge theory .",
    "if we assumed the validity of the dual gravity description and used the gravitational description to explain gravity , we would be just be assuming the answer to answer the question .",
    "previously , the gauge theory description of the large ads - bh , the hagedorn parameter region , and string gas parameter region have been understood at least qualitatively ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we propose a simple gauge theory description of the small bh . by assuming the validity of the ads / cft correspondence _ for the large black hole _ , we derive the relation between the energy and temperature _ of the small black hole _ , @xmath5 , at strong coupling .",
    "we also give a heuristic explanation supporting this assumption based only on gauge theory .",
    "in addition , we will show that the same picture correctly reproduces the hagedorn behavior . in short ,    * the large black hole is described by a bound state of all the eigenvalues of scalar fields @xmath14 .",
    "all @xmath28 matrix entries are excited .",
    "* suppose some of the eigenvalues are emitted , after which and only @xmath29 eigenvalues form a bound state .",
    "such matrices describe the small black hole .",
    "the black hole is smaller when @xmath30 is smaller .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : microscopic_picture ] , we remind the readers how the microscopic , stringy degrees of freedom can be read off from the fields ( matrices ) in 4d sym .",
    "two seemingly different , but actually equivalent , pictures  ` open strings+d - branes ' and closed strings  are introduced , and the meaning of the emission of the d - branes ( eigenvalues ) from the bh @xcite is explained .",
    "[ sec : main ] is the main part of this paper . we propose a gauge theory description of the small black hole , and obtain the relationship between the energy , entropy and temperature expected from the conjectured gravity dual modulo a technical assumption explained at the end of the section . in sec .",
    "[ sec : others ] , we suggest that the same picture can hold for a rather generic class of theories holographically dual to superstring / m - theory .",
    "we study the abjm theory as an example and derive the right energy - temperature relation of the 11d schwarzschild black hole .",
    "while this work has been in progress , we have learned that leonard susskind had essentially the same idea independently .",
    "he conjectured the small black hole is described by a small sub - matrix , and considered a possibility of making the ` box ' ( ads space ) smaller in order to remove the degrees of freedom which are not needed for describing the small bh . in terms of gauge theory , this means a truncation to u@xmath31 .",
    "then he assumed the ` corresponding principle ' which relates the large and small black holes . on the gauge theory side , mathematically , this is exactly what we have done in order to derive @xmath32 .",
    "we would like to thank him for stimulating discussions and collaboration toward the end of the project .",
    "in this section , we explain how the stringy micro - states of a black hole are encoded into gauge theory .",
    "there are two seemingly different pictures , ( 1 ) the bound states of d - branes and strings @xcite and ( 2 ) long , winding strings @xcite . here",
    "we explain how they are related to each other .",
    "firstly let us consider the d0-brane quantum mechanics picture@xcite , the generalization to generic gauge theories including 4d @xmath0 sym is straightforward .",
    "we work in the hamiltonian formulation @xcite .",
    "the gauge field is set to zero , @xmath33 , and the physical hilbert space is obtained by acting traces of products of scalars @xmath34 on the vacuum state . when we follow the usual d - brane effective theory point of view @xcite , the diagonal components @xmath35 are regarded as the position of @xmath36-th d0-brane in @xmath37 , and the off - diagonal components @xmath38 describe open strings connecting @xmath36-th and @xmath39-th d0-branes .",
    "note that these strings are oriented .",
    "when @xmath38 is large , a lot of strings are excited between @xmath36-th and @xmath39-th d0-branes .",
    "this is picture ( 1 ) .    in order to go to picture",
    "( 2 ) , let us regard the d0-branes and open strings as sites and links of a non - local lattice ( fig .",
    "[ figure_lattice ] ) .",
    "here we use the adjective  nonlocal \" because all pairs of sites can be directly connected by links .",
    "gauge - invariant states are made of closed loops .",
    "for example , if we consider @xmath40 ; @xmath41 with different @xmath42 is a closed loop made of four links ( fig .  [ figure_loop_1 ] ) , while @xmath43 with different @xmath44 is a closed loop made of three links and one site ( fig .",
    "[ figure_loop_2 ] ) . hence the black hole , which is a bound state of d - branes and open strings , is naturally regarded as a long , winding string in the lattice description .",
    "( more precisely , a few long strings . )",
    "the maximum possible number of string bits ( open strings ) is the maximum possible length of a single trace operator , which is of order @xmath28 .",
    "this upper bound appears because single trace operators beyond this bound can be expressed by using shorter operators .",
    "note that this is slightly different from the ` correspondence principle ' @xcite in the usual sense , that the black hole is always described by strings in this picture @xcite .",
    "when the number of spatial dimension is nonzero , the gauge fields form other links ; the picture should be clear if one imagines a lattice discretization of space - time .",
    "then the link variables also become strings ; generic long string states are expressed by wilson loops ( qcd strings ) with scalar insertions . here",
    "the black brane can be regarded as a condensation of long strings . for more details , see @xcite .",
    "+      the dynamics of d - branes play an important role in the matrix ( gauge theory ) description of the black holes @xcite .",
    "suppose the d - branes form well separated and localized bunches consisting of @xmath45 d - branes .",
    "then strings inside each bunch are short , light and can be very excited , while strings connecting different bunches are long , heavy and can not be excited much . in terms of matrices ,",
    "such a configuration is expressed by almost block - diagonal matrices with block sizes @xmath45 .",
    "each block is regarded as long strings with maximum length @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "typically , the @xmath36-th block carries the energy and entropy of order @xmath47 .",
    "next let us consider the emission of eigenvalues , following @xcite .",
    "sym on @xmath1s@xmath2 , though there are no flat directions , emission still plays an important role , as we will see shortly .",
    "] when one of the d - branes is emitted , open strings between the emitted d - brane and the others become heavy and decouple from the dynamics .",
    "hence fully noncommutative @xmath16 matrices turn to block diagonal forms , @xmath48 where @xmath49 are fully noncommutative @xmath50 matrices and @xmath51 describe the position of emitted d - brane - components . technical details about this gauge choice will be explained in sec .  [",
    "sec : gauge_fixing ] . ] .",
    "this is the higgs mechanism . the number of light physical degrees of freedom decrease from @xmath52 to @xmath53 , while the energy is conserved during emission .",
    "hence the energy per degree of freedom ( @xmath54 temperature ) increases . as the emission continues more",
    "eigenvalues can be emitted and the black hole becomes hotter and hotter .",
    "the negative specific heat of the black hole follows from this simple fact . for details , see @xcite .    in the next section ,",
    "we show that the emission of d - branes can explain the properties of the small black hole in ads@xmath3s@xmath4 described by 4d sym on @xmath1s@xmath18 .",
    "the large ads@xmath56 black hole is obtained by rolling up a black three - brane with charge @xmath13 .",
    "the black brane is a bound state of all @xmath13 eigenvalues ( d3-branes ) ; as is the large black hole .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ rolling_up_d3 ] . as we declared in the introduction",
    ", we assume the ads / cft duality between sym and the large bh is correct . in principle ( and within a ten - year span , probably in practice ) , the duality can be tested by monte carlo simulation . for recent numerical studies ,",
    "see e.g. @xcite .",
    "when the black hole on the gravity side fills the s@xmath4 completely , the ads@xmath56 bh should be used in the dual gravity calculation .",
    "it has the minimum temperature @xmath57 ; see fig .",
    "[ ads5-bh-2 ] .",
    "let us call the energy at @xmath58 to be @xmath59 , and the solutions at @xmath60 and @xmath61 to be ` large ' and ` small ' ads@xmath56 black holes , respectively .",
    "( hence @xmath59 is the minimum energy of the ` large ' bh . ) to avoid confusion we will use small bh to refer to a 10d schwarzschild black hole and small ads@xmath56 bh to refer to a small ads black hole which still fills the s@xmath4 .    the small ads@xmath56 bh solution at @xmath61 does not have a counterpart in 4d sym ; it is unstable with respect to the gregory - laflamme instability @xcite along the s@xmath4 , and hence the 10d bh becomes the appropriate description . from the point of view of gauge theory , it can be understood as follows . in order for a bound state of eigenvalues ( non - commutative block ) to be formed , ( almost )",
    "all of the off - diagonal elements must be excited , which costs a lot of energy .",
    "hence the ads@xmath56 bh black hole can exist only when the energy is large enough .",
    "strictly speaking , the ` minimum energy ' @xmath59 corresponding to the instability might be slightly different from the energy at @xmath57 ; they should be of the same order but it is hard to determine the order one factor .",
    "a dual gravity analysis such as @xcite may provide us with a concrete number . in the following",
    "we will not consider order one coefficients which are sensitive to this ambiguity .",
    "the above argument , however , does not take into account the emission of eigenvalues .",
    "even if the energy is not large enough to bind all @xmath13 eigenvalues , it may still be possible to bind @xmath30 eigenvalues , with @xmath62 .",
    "note that , because the space is compactified , there is no superselection of vacua ; the value of the scalar field @xmath63 should be determined dynamically , like in the matrix model of m - theory @xcite .",
    "also note that , unlike the matrix model of m - theory , this theory does not possess flat directions , because the scalars have a mass proportional to the inverse of the s@xmath2 radius .",
    "hence the emitted particles do not roll to infinity ; they form a finite density gas and that can be absorbed again by the black hole . at some point , the emission and the absorption rates can balance .",
    "we consider a mixed state of bh and gas in 4d @xmath0 on @xmath64s@xmath2 .",
    "our proposal is that a black hole consisting of @xmath30 eigenvalues and a gas consisting of @xmath65 particles , where @xmath66 , can be described by matrices of the form we show how this gauge choice can be achieved , and that the gauge fixing and faddeev - popov terms are negligible . strictly speaking ,",
    "in addition to the elements shown in , there is some ` fuzziness ' which describes short open strings stretched between nearby d - branes ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : actual_shape ] .",
    "such a correction is negligible in the situations we consider below , where both @xmath67 is small but of order @xmath68 . ]",
    "@xmath69 where @xmath70 is an @xmath71 matrix .    intuitively ,    * in order for a bound state of eigenvalues ( non - commutative block ) to be formed , ( almost ) all off - diagonal elements must be excited , which costs a lot of energy . *",
    "if the total energy of the system is big enough , say @xmath72 , ( almost ) all off - diagonal elements can be excited .",
    "hence @xmath73 , @xmath74 can be realized .",
    "* if the energy is not that big , then @xmath30 becomes smaller .",
    "the number of degrees of freedom decreases dynamically , and the temperature of the system goes up .",
    "at some point , ( if the total energy is not too small ) @xmath30 can become small enough so that off - diagonal elements in @xmath70 ( number of degrees of freedom @xmath75 ) can be excited .",
    "* in the closed string picture : the string wants to become as long and winding as possible with the available amount of energy .",
    "it does this in order to gain more entropy .",
    "when the energy is not big enough , i.e. @xmath30 becomes too big , it ends up with a long but not very wound string . then @xmath30 becomes smaller so that the string can take more complicated shapes .",
    "strictly speaking , there are strings connecting different gas - branes , and also the ones connecting the bh and gas - branes .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : actual_shape ] .",
    "here we are assuming that most of them are long , heavy and do not play an important role .    in our calculation",
    ", we neglect the interaction between the emitted eigenvalues and the small bh , and treat it similarly as the ` large bh ' in the truncated u@xmath31 gauge theory .      here",
    "we explain how the ( almost ) block - diagonal form and fig [ fig : actual_shape ] can be obtained .",
    "let us first introduce the maximally - diagonal gauge @xcite .",
    "this gauge condition is based on the implicit assumption of the ` d - brane+open string ' picture  diagonal elements are large , off - diagonal elements are small .",
    "however this is actually a gauge - dependent statement .",
    "hence , we impose the condition that ` the matrices are as close to simultaneously diagonal as possible ' . for that purpose",
    "we introduce @xmath76 defined by @xmath77 under the gauge transformation @xmath78 , @xmath76 transforms as @xmath79 we choose @xmath80 which maximizes @xmath81 . unless there are accidental degeneracies ,",
    "such a @xmath82 is unique up to u@xmath83 and simultaneous permutations of rows and columns .",
    "the @xmath84 are ` as close to simultaneously diagonal as possible ' .",
    "now let us apply this gauge choice to the situation under consideration . among the @xmath13 d - branes ,",
    "@xmath30 form the small black hole .",
    "we assume both @xmath13 and @xmath30 are parametrically large , and @xmath67 is small but of order @xmath68 .",
    "then , the small black hole is stable , namely the value @xmath30 does not fluctuate much . the @xmath30 diagonal elements in the maximally diagonal gauge",
    "should then form a bunch ( implying that the off - diagonal elements connecting them are not small ) , while other @xmath85 diagonal elements are spread out .",
    "we can ( partly ) fix the ambiguity of the permutation of rows and columns by putting the @xmath30 size bunch in the upper - left corner of the matrices .",
    "then the matrices takes the form .",
    "in our arguments throughout the paper , intuitively , we are ` truncating ' ( or freezing out the gas degrees of freedom to reduce ) @xmath86 to @xmath87 . note that this ` truncation ' makes sense only in the microcanonical ensemble , and for a fixed value of the energy ; when the extra energy is added , the bunch size increases in the original theory , while the bunch size is fixed and temperature increases in the truncated theory .",
    "the gauge fixing and the faddeev - popov terms associated with the maximally - diagonal gauge should be taken into account .",
    "but the maximally - diagonal gauge condition is rather nontrivial ( note that @xmath82 is time - dependent ! ) and it is difficult to write down the gauge fixing and the faddeev - popov terms .",
    "in the situation we have in mind , however , these terms are negligible up to the interaction with emitted particles .",
    "this is because , at each time @xmath88 the truncated action written by @xmath89 is the same as the original action written by @xmath90 to the leading order ( i.e. @xmath91 parts of the actions agree ) , as long as @xmath67 is of order @xmath68 .",
    "as long as we consider physics of the small black hole ( the bunch of @xmath30 d - branes ) , any gauge - equivalent profiles give simply the same path - integral weight as the truncated theory , to the leading order in @xmath92 .",
    "another way to fix the gauge is to introduce an ` external field ' .",
    "let @xmath93 be a projector to the @xmath94 block , @xmath95 with @xmath96 1 s and @xmath97 0 s .",
    "we can introduce an ` external field ' which pushes bh to the upper - left corner , for example as @xmath98 note that this term manifestly breaks the full su@xmath99 symmetry .",
    "then the bh is pushed to the upper - left corner by minimizing @xmath100 which occurs at positive value @xmath101 which is small but @xmath102 . after taking @xmath103",
    ", we turn off @xmath101 .",
    "this is nothing but the usual prescription used for detecting spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "we will now make this scenario more precise .",
    "the ads - schwarzschild bh sitting at the origin of ads corresponds to a bound state of eigenvalues around @xmath105 .",
    "the energy is @xmath106 and roughly speaking , @xmath107 hence we ignore @xmath108 .",
    "we have to determine @xmath30 for given @xmath109 .",
    "let us firstly give a heuristic gauge theory argument which does not rely on the gravity dual .",
    "suppose the action is dominated by the @xmath110 ^ 2$]-term , which should be true at strong coupling .",
    "note that the coupling @xmath111 disappears in terms of @xmath112 ; hence the eigenvalues of @xmath113 are of order 1 , and the eigenvalues of @xmath86 scale as @xmath114 when @xmath115 is varied .",
    "when the bunch size decreases to @xmath30 , the radius of the bunch scales as @xmath116 , assuming the interactions with the emitted branes do not affect the size of the bunch significantly .",
    "here @xmath117 , and we assumed @xmath118 . it would be natural makes the situation subtle . when @xmath119 , the two energy scales @xmath120 and @xmath121 are clearly separated .",
    "then energy scale should be dominated by @xmath120 which is the size of the eigenvalue distribution . ] to expect that the typical energy scale is set by the inverse of the eigenvalue distribution , @xmath122 .",

    "namely we consider the chern - simons level @xmath178 , t hooft coupling @xmath179 .",
    "the gravity dual is m - theory on ads@xmath180s@xmath181 . in this case , the microscopic picture on the gravity side is not clear , other than that @xmath13 corresponds to the number of m2-branes . however it would be natural to _ assume _ that the small bh is described in the same way as in 4d @xmath0 sym , by a bunch of @xmath30 m2-branes , and the calculation goes through in the same manner .    with this assumption , by using @xmath182 and @xmath183 where @xmath184 and @xmath185 are the eleven - dimensional newton constant and planck scale , respectively ,",
    "the energy and entropy are estimated as sym , we used the fact that the eigenvalues scales as @xmath114 . here , we need to use a similar relation : the bifundamental scalars @xmath186 , which describes the moduli space of m2-branes , should scale as @xmath187 . in the t hooft limit ( @xmath188 ) , because @xmath186 has a potential of the form @xmath189 , the scaling should be @xmath190 .",
    "the same behavior is expected in the m - theory region , up to @xmath92-suppressed corrections @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath191 and @xmath192 therefore , @xmath193 yielding finally @xmath194 this correctly reproduces the property of the eleven - dimensional schwarzschild black hole . in this case",
    "( abjm , @xmath178 ) the system is strongly coupled even for small @xmath30 , and hence the hagedorn behavior discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : hagedorn ] does not set in .",
    "the same power counting will hold for other theories as well , including non - conformal theories , if they possess a similar matrix description .",
    "we assume that the geometry consists of @xmath195 non - compact and @xmath196 compact dimensions ( where @xmath197 and @xmath198 for theories with respectively string and m - theory duals ) . the space - time does not necessarily have to be a product like ads@xmath199x ( where x is a compact manifold ) , as long as the notion of large and small black holes still makes sense . furthermore , suppose there is only one typical length scale @xmath200 in the dual geometry , like @xmath23 .",
    "then , it is natural to expect that the minimum energy and temperature are obtained by the dimensional analysis as @xmath201 by going to the dual field theory description and applying the same argument for the small black hole , we obtain @xmath202 and @xmath203 where @xmath204 .",
    "the power @xmath205 may depend on the theory .",
    "this gives the expected scaling , @xmath206",
    "a rather striking consequence of our proposal is that the small bh is essentially like a large bh from the point of view of the gauge theory ; it is the ` smallest possible large bh ' , which is continuously connected to the high-@xmath21 region . seen from gauge theory ,",
    "it is simply a thermal state , but with different ` matrix size ' .",
    "hence the study of the large bh provides us with important lessons on the small bh .",
    "another lesson is the importance of eigenvalue dynamics in the gauge / gravity duality a la maldacena .",
    "although the importance of eigenvalue dynamics has been widely appreciated in the 20th century , for example in the matrix theory conjecture @xcite , it has somehow almost been forgotten after the maldacena conjecture ( ads / cft ) .",
    "it is , however , an important piece for understanding black hole evaporation , even in the context of the maldacena conjecture , as emphasized in this paper and refs .",
    "@xcite . due to this , a detailed study of eigenvalue dynamics should help lead us to an understanding of the bulk geometry , including the horizon of the black hole . note that the large bh can be studied by using the canonical ensemble , which makes the numerical simulation rather straightforward with the matsubara formalism",
    ". it would provide us with a first - principle study of the geometric structure of the schwarzschild black hole based on gauge theory @xcite .",
    "such a study should be important for various problems associated with the black hole information puzzle .",
    "more tests would be desirable to establish the proposal more rigidly .",
    "one interesting and doable direction would be a consistency check based on dual gravity calculations .",
    "if our proposal is correct , the small black hole and the large black hole at ` @xmath59 ' describe essentially the same dual gauge theory , up to the rescaling of the t hooft coupling associated with the emission of d - branes .",
    "recently , dual gravity calculations for the small black hole have been performed in @xcite .",
    "there is also an attempt for studying the small ads@xmath56 black hole , which is not localized along s@xmath4 which can be found in @xcite .",
    "since the agreement should become better when 10d black hole is smaller , such tests might be doable without relying on the very hard numerical calculations needed to include the finite - size effects @xcite .",
    "we have not yet understood how the breakdown of so(6 ) symmetry can be seen in terms of eigenvalues .",
    "it would be nice if we could make progress in near future .    in this paper we truncated large matrices to small matrices .",
    "more refined treatments , for example something like the matrix renormalization group @xcite which integrates out the emitted eigenvalues , would allow us to extract more information about black holes .",
    "we would like to thank leonard susskind for the collaboration toward the end of the project .",
    "as explained in the introduction , he had essentially the same idea as ours .",
    "we would also like to thank juan maldacena and kostas skenderis for pointing out miscalculations in the first version of this paper , which helped us correcting a few wrong arguments .",
    "furthernore we thank ahmed almheiri , tom banks , evan berkowitz , oscar dias , blaise goutraux , guy gur - ari , joao penedones , enrico rinaldi , jorge santos , andreas schfer , stephen shenker , david tong and ying zhao for discussions and comments .",
