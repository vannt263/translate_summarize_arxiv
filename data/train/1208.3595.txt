    "understanding the nonlinear and unstable nature of the quantum vacuum in the presence of a strong electromagnetic field constitutes an important task of theoretical physics .",

    "moreover , perspectives of achieving ultrahigh field intensities ( @xmath1 @xmath2 ) in short laser pulses of few femtoseconds duration @xcite have motivated a growing interest in the phenomenology purely associated with the quantum nature of the electromagnetic interaction ( see @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "this is because the envisaged laser field strengths lie only 1 - 2 orders of magnitude below the critical value @xmath3 where qed vacuum nonlinearities become substantial and spontaneous vacuum decay into electron - positron ( @xmath4 ) pairs via the schwinger mechanism is expected to occur @xcite .    in combination with an incident high - energy particle , strong laser fields can induce @xmath4 pair production already at intensities available today . in a pioneering experiment at slac @xcite , a multi - gev photon decayed into a pair while propagating through a moderately intense laser pulse ( @xmath5 @xmath2 ) .",
    "this process , involving the simultaneous absorption of several laser photons , represents a nonlinear version of the well - known breit - wheeler reaction @xcite .",

    "for example , due to their broad frequency composition , laser pulses of ultrashort duration have been shown to modify the created particle spectra @xcite and lead to characteristic enhancements in the pair production probability @xcite .",
    "photo - induced pair production also plays a crucial role for the development of qed cascades which may give rise to @xmath4 plasmas of very high density @xcite .",

    ", the very similar behavior of the production rates in this regime indicates that the process is mainly determined by the features of the weak photon and strong laser fields , rather than the particular property of the matter field .",
    "finally we point out that , whenever the energy scale remains within the phenomenological limits of qed and its fundamental principles are preserved , the photo - production of a hypothetical pair of spinless particles characterized by a tiny fraction @xmath207 of the electron charge @xmath42 would not differ qualitatively from the respective creation of a spinless electron - positron pair . in correspondence , the rate associated with the latter phenomenon can be obtained from the expression derived in this letter by replacing the electron parameters @xmath208 by the respective quantities @xmath209 associated with a minicharged particle .",
