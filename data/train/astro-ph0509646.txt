    "ultra - luminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) are extra - nuclear point x - ray sources with luminosities exceeding @xmath10 . these objects were first discovered with _ einstein _ observations ( reviewed by fabbiano 1989 ) .",
    "the nature of ulxs continues to be an enigma , since their adopted isotropic high energy output surpasses the eddington limit of even the most massive stellar mass black holes ( bhs ) , sometimes by large factors .",
    "several models have been proposed to explain the high luminosities of ulxs .",
    "the most popular is the `` intermediate mass black hole ( imbh ) '' with mass @xmath11 ( e.g. , colbert & mushotzky 1999 , hereafter cm99 ) bridging the gap between stellar mass bhs in xrbs and super - massive bhs in active galactic nuclei .",
    "other popular models include xrbs with anisotropic emission ( king et al .",
    "2001 ) , beamed xrbs with relativistic jets directly pointing towards us i. e. , scaled down versions of blazars ( mirabel & rodriguez 1999 ) , and xrbs with super - eddington accretion rates ( begelman 2002 ) .",
    "several observations suggest that ulxs may be similar or scaled up versions of xrbs .",
    "discovery of orbital modulations from several ulxs ( bauer et al . 2001 ; sugiho et al . 2001 ) implies their binary nature .",
    "recent _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations of ulxs show soft x - ray excess emission which has been interpreted as the emission from accretion disks with temperatures in the range @xmath12 ( see shrader & titarchuk 2003 and review by miller & colbert 2003 and references therein ) .",
    "observations of spectral transitions between low / hard and high / soft states in two ulxs in ic  342 ( kubota et al .",
    "2001 ) further demonstrate their similarity with the xrbs .",
    "the recent observation of a break at a frequency of @xmath13 in the power density spectrum ( pds ) of the ulx in ngc  5408 suggests a bh mass of @xmath14 ( soria et al .",
    "2004 ) .    the enigmatic nature of ulxs can be understood by determining their bh masses . the most reliable method is to measure the mass function through the secondary mass and orbital parameters such as velocities , period , orbit size etc . , which can be measured only if the secondary is optically identified .",
    "there are two cases of optical identification ( kuntz et al .",
    "2005 ; liu et al .",
    "2004 ) ; however , the orbital parameters of any ulx binary system are yet to be measured .",
    "good progress can still be made by establishing a direct physical connection between ulxs and xrbs .",
    "this can be done by comparing the characteristic time scales such as those associated with the low frequency quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) . however , this comparison is ambiguous without the information about a low frequency break , the shape of the pds and energy spectrum .",
    "m82 x-1 is one of the brightest ulx ( cxo m82 j095550.2 + 694047 , source 7 in matsumoto et al .",
    "2001 ) that is well suited for a determination of the shape of the pds .",
    "_ chandra _ high resolution camera observations showed that the source is unresolved and off - nuclear ( matsumoto et al .",
    "the ulx has no optically bright counterpart ( kaaret et al .",
    "2001 ) : there is a likely ir counterpart which is a super star cluster ( kaaret et al",
    "recently , strohmayer & mushotzky ( 2003 ) , hereafter sm03 , discovered a qpo in m82 x-1 at a frequency of @xmath15 based on a @xmath16 _ xmm - newton _ observation .",
    "they also found qpos in the @xmath17 frequency range in the _ rxte _ data .",
    "fiorito & titarchuk ( 2004 ) , hereafter ft04 apply a new method to determine the bh mass of m82 x-1 .",
    "the method uses the spectral index - qpo low - frequency correlation that has been recently established in bh xrbs grs 1915 + 105 , xte j1550 - 564 , 4u 1630 - 47 , and others ( titarchuk & fiorito 2004 , hereafter tf04 ) . using scaling arguments and the correlation derived from galactic bhs",
    ", they conclude that m82 x-1 is an intermediate mass bh of order 1000 m@xmath18 .",
    "we revisit the bh mass estimate in m82  x-1 using new data on the power spectrum and energy spectra .",
    "m82 was observed using _ xmm - newton _ on 2001 may 5 for @xmath19 and again on 2004 april 21 for @xmath20 .",
    "the first observation led to the discovery of a @xmath21 qpo from the ulx ( sm03 ) . here",
    "we consider the epic data from the second observation only .",
    "the epic pn and mos cameras were operated in the full frame mode using the medium filter .",
    "we used the sas version 6.1 and the most recent calibration data base to process and filter the event data .",
    "examination of the background rate above @xmath22 showed that the observation is completely swamped by the particle background after an elapsed time of @xmath23 and this latter period was therefore excluded from the rest of the analysis .    in the central regions of m82 , _ chandra _ images revealed diffuse emission and several point sources , m82 x-1 being the brightest among them ( matsumoto et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the diffuse emission is evident in the epic images but the point sources are not resolved .",
    "following sm03 , we extracted pn and mos events using a @xmath24 circular region around the bright point source whose position is consistent with the _ chandra _ position of m82 x-1 . above @xmath25 ,",
    "the diffuse emission contributes only @xmath26 to the point source inside the @xmath24 circular region . at the faintest flux level of m82 x-1",
    ", nearby point sources contribute @xmath27 to the @xmath28 x - ray emission in the @xmath24 region ( matsumoto et al .",
    "2001 ; sm03 ) .      for temporal analysis , we combined the pn and mos data and used the continuous exposure of @xmath29 during which both the pn and mos cameras operated simultaneously .",
    "we calculated a power density spectrum ( pds ) using the background corrected pn+mos light curves sampled at @xmath30 .",
    "figure  [ f1 ] ( _ left _ ) shows the @xmath4 pds of m82 x-1 rebinned by a factor of @xmath31 yielding a frequency resolution of @xmath32 .",
    "the pds continuum is approximately flat at low frequencies below @xmath33 and then falls off approximately following a power law up to @xmath34 where the white noise arising from the poisson errors starts to dominate the pds .",
    "there is a prominent qpo with its peak frequency near @xmath35 .",
    "we fitted the pds with two models : ( @xmath36 ) a broad lorentzian for the continuum and a narrow lorentzian for the qpo , and ( @xmath37 ) a broken power law ( bpl ) for the continuum and a lorentzian ( l ) for the qpo .",
    "we also used a constant to account for the poisson noise . both models provided statistically acceptable fits , giving a minimum @xmath38 of @xmath39 for 121 degrees of freedom ( dof ) and @xmath40 for 120 dof for the double lorentzian and bpl@xmath41l models , respectively .",
    "the errors on the best - fit pds model parameters , quoted below , are at a @xmath42 level .",
    "the double lorentzian model resulted in a qpo centroid frequency @xmath43 , a width @xmath44 , an amplitude @xmath45 and the broad lorentzian centroid @xmath46 , a width @xmath47 and an amplitude @xmath48 .",
    "the bpl@xmath41l model resulted in a qpo centroid frequency @xmath1 , a width @xmath49 , an amplitude @xmath50 , and broken power - law indices of @xmath51 below the break frequency @xmath52 and @xmath53 above the break frequency , and an amplitude @xmath54 at a reference frequency of @xmath55 .",
    "the total integrated power ( @xmath56 ) and the qpo power expressed as @xmath57 are @xmath58 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the use of a broken power law is an improvement ( @xmath59 for two additional parameters ) over a simple power law at a statistical significance level of @xmath60 based on the maximum likelihood ratio test .",
    "thus the break in the continuum of the power spectrum is real .",
    "the best - fit bpl@xmath41l model is shown in fig .",

    "we have also calculated the pds of an xrb xte  j1550 - 564 using the _ rxte _ observation of 10 september 1998 .",
    "xte  j1550 - 564 shows a large range in its low frequency qpo centroid ( @xmath61 ; sobczak et al .",
    "2000a ) . our choice of the particular _ rxte _ observation relies on the fact that xte  j1550 - 564 showed a power - law ( pl ) photon index of @xmath62 on 10 september 1999 ( sobczak et al .",
    "2000b ) , which is very similar to the @xmath63 photon index of m82 x-1 ( see below ) .",
    "[ f1 ] ( _ right _ ) shows the pds of xte  j1550 - 564 calculated from the pca light curve sampled at @xmath64 which was obtained from the _ rxte _ public data archive .",
    "we used a model comprising a broken pl and two lorentzians to fit the pds .",
    "this model resulted in a statistically acceptable fit ( minimum @xmath65 for 118 dof ) .",
    "the broken pl has best - fit parameters : @xmath66 below the break frequency @xmath67 , @xmath68 above the break and an amplitude @xmath69 at a reference frequency of @xmath55 .",
    "the two qpos have centroid frequencies @xmath70 and @xmath71 , widths @xmath72 and @xmath73 and amplitudes @xmath74 and @xmath75 for the fundamental and first harmonic , respectively .",
    "the total integrated power ( @xmath76 ) and the qpo ( fundamental ) power expressed as @xmath57 are @xmath58 and @xmath77 , respectively .",
    "we extracted pn and mos spectra using a @xmath24 circular region centered at the position of m82 x-1 .",
    "we also extracted pn and mos background spectra using nearby circular regions free of sources .",
    "we created appropriate response files using the sas tasks rmfgen and arfgen .",
    "the spectra were grouped to a minimum of @xmath78 counts per spectral channel and analyzed with xspec 11.3 .",
    "the errors on the best - fit spectral parameters are quoted at a @xmath79 confidence level .",
    "an absorbed power law ( pl ) model fitted to the pn data showed strong soft excess emission below @xmath80 due to the presence of the diffuse soft x - ray emission in the source extraction region .",
    "we ignored the data below @xmath81 and performed the spectral fitting of the pn and mos data separately .",
    "a simple pl model poorly describes both the pn and mos data .",
    "we show the ratio of the pn data and the best - fitting absorbed pl model in figure  [ f2](a ) . a prominent iron k@xmath82 line at @xmath6 is evident .",
    "addition of a gaussian line ( gl ) to the pl model improved the fit significantly ( @xmath83 for three additional parameters ) and resulted in a good fit ( minimum @xmath84 for 944 dof .",
    "the gaussian line has a centroid energy @xmath85 , a width @xmath86 , a line flux @xmath87 and an equivalent width of @xmath88 .",
    "the best - fit photon index is @xmath89 and the the absorption column is @xmath90 .",
    "the observed @xmath4 flux is @xmath91 and the corresponding luminosity is @xmath92 assuming a distance of @xmath93 ( sakai & madore 1999 ) . in figure  [ f2]b , we show the best - fit pl@xmath41gl model to the epic pn data . the pl@xmath41gl model fitted to the mos data resulted in slightly flatter pl ( @xmath94 ) , an absorption column @xmath95 and a weaker iron line , @xmath96 .",
    "based on long _ xmm - newton _ observations , we show clear evidence for the simultaneous presence of a low frequency break at @xmath97 and a qpo with centroid frequency @xmath98 in the power spectrum of m82 x-1 . the qpo frequency is similar to that found from the _ rxte _ observation of 1997 july 21 , while it is about a factor of two larger than that found in the first _ xmm - newton _ observation of 2001 may and an _ rxte _ observation of 1997 february 24 ( sm03 ) .",
    "thus the qpo frequency of m82 x-1 is variable .",
    "the m82 x-1 pds is flat below the break frequency and then falls off above the break as a power law with a prominent qpo on top of it .",
    "this form of the pds is characteristic of xrbs in their high / soft state or intermediate state ( e.g. , mcclintock & remillard 2003 ; see also fig .",
    "[ f1 ] for a comparison ) .",
    "pdss of many bh xrbs display low frequency qpos in the frequency range of @xmath99 ( remillard et al .",
    "the qpo frequency is strongly correlated with the break frequency ( wijnands & van der klis 1999 ) .",
    "the break frequency is always lower than the qpo frequency by at least a factor of three ( see , wijnands & van der klis 1999 ) .",
    "m82 x-1 follows this correlation as its qpo frequency is about a factor three larger than the break frequency .",
    "_ thus the pds of the ulx is very similar to the xrb pdss in their high / soft or transition state .",
    "_    since the characteristic time scales of accretion powered sources scale with bh mass , the similarity of the pdss of m82 x-1 and xrbs provides the opportunity to determine the ratio of their bh masses .",
    "however , as stated above , the xrbs show a large range in their low frequency qpo and break frequencies .",
    "therefore , the frequency scaling factor between any two power spectra of two xrbs will lead to an incorrect determination of the ratio of their bh masses . fortunately ,",
    "the pds features ( break and qpo frequencies ) are well correlated with the energy spectral parameters .",
    "the low frequency qpos are related to the flux of the pl energy spectral component .",
    "the variable frequency qpos in xte j1550 - 564 and gro j1655 - 40 appear only when the pl contributes more than @xmath100 of the @xmath4 flux ( sobczak et al .",
    "2000a and references therein ) .",
    "grs  1915 + 105 also shows similar behavior ( muno et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the pl index is well correlated with the centroid of the low frequency qpos in grs  1915 + 105 ( vignarca et al .",
    "2003 ) and xte  j1550 + 564 ( sobczak et al .",
    "2000a , 2000b ) .",
    "the photon index increases with the qpo frequency until it saturates .",
    "the frequency scaling factor between the low frequency qpos of two xrbs with similar pl photon indices can be used to determine the ratio of their bh masses ( tf04 ; ft04 ) .",
    "thus it is crucial to determine the shape of x - ray spectrum and detect both the qpo and the low frequency break in order to make sure that the detected qpo lies at a low frequency , but above the break frequency , and on top of a pds power - law continuum .",
    "the long _ xmm - newton _ observation of m82 x-1 has yielded all 3 pieces of information required to determine its bh mass .",
    "the photon index of the @xmath101 pl is @xmath102 as determined from the high signal - to - noise pn data .",
    "xrbs show a range of pl photon indices from @xmath103 in their low / hard state to @xmath104 in their high / soft state .",
    "thus m82 x-1 is likely in a state intermediate between the high and low states .",
    "sobczak et al .",
    "( 2000a ) studied the spectral behavior of xte  j1550 - 564 during its 19981999 outburst using 209 pointed observations with _",
    "rxte_. they used a model consisting of a multicolor disk blackbody and a pl to fit the spectra and found that the spectra gradually steepen from @xmath105 to @xmath106 for xte  j1550 - 564 .",
    "the low frequency qpo is also found to vary from @xmath107 . at a pl photon index of @xmath108 ( @xmath109 ) ,",
    "xte  j1550 - 564 shows a low frequency qpo at @xmath110 ( @xmath111 ) ( sobczak et al .",
    "2000a ; 2000b ) .",
    "noting that the bh mass scales inversely in proportion to the qpo frequency and the bh mass of xte  j1550 - 564 is about @xmath112 ( titarchuk & shrader 2002 , shrader & titarchuk 2003 ) , we can determine the bh mass of the m82 x-1 as @xmath113 ( ulx ) @xmath114(xte  j1550 - 564)/@xmath115(ulx ) @xmath116 ( xte  j1550 - 564 ) @xmath117 .",
    "another xrb grs  1915 + 105 shows a low frequency qpo with its centroid at @xmath118 ( @xmath119 ) when its pl photon index is @xmath120 ( @xmath121 ) ( vignarca et al . 2003 ) . noting that that the bh mass of grs  1915 + 105 is @xmath122 estimated dynamically from the ir spectroscopic observation of its companion star ( greiner et al .",
    "2001 ) , the bh mass for m82 x-1 is @xmath113 ( ulx ) @xmath123 .",
    "thus , scaling the mass of m  82 x-1 from the @xmath124 relation calibrated by the dynamical masses of several galactic bhs , we find @xmath113 ( ulx ) @xmath123 .",
    "the qpo frequencies and photon indices for m82 x-1 , xte  j1550 - 564 and grs  1915 + 105 correspond to a region of steep dependence in the @xmath124 relation ( see ft04 ) .",
    "it is therefore likely that the uncertainty in the calibration of the @xmath125 relation may introduce an additional factor of two uncertainty in the determination of the bh mass of m  82  x-1 .",
    "thus the true bh mass of m  82 x-1 is most likely in the range of @xmath126 .",
    "this is at least a factor of @xmath127 lower than the previous estimate by ft04 , which can be explained by the lower values of the qpo frequencies for m82 x-1 in our paper compared with those in ft04 .",
    "the above estimate of the bh mass is based on the assumption that m  82 x-1 also follows the @xmath124 relation found for xrbs .",
    "_ xmm - newton _ and _ rxte _ observations of m  82 x-1 have revealed that the qpo frequency is variable ( sm03 ) .",
    "the photon index is also variable ( ft04 ) but appears to be inconsistent with the @xmath124 relation for xrbs .",
    "however , there may be systematic errors in the photon indices measured with _",
    "xmm - newton _ and _ rxte _ due to contamination from nearby sources , as indicated by large apparent changes in the effective absorption column .",
    "_ chandra _ acis observations of m  82 x-1 were used to suggest an effective column in the range @xmath128 ( sm03 ) , while _ xmm - newton _ and _ rxte _ observations have been used to suggest large columns in the range @xmath129 ( see section 3.2 , ft04 ) . both _",
    "xmm - newton _ and _ rxte _ observations suffer from contamination by nearby sources .",
    "a small contribution from nearby sources may significantly alter the spectral shape of the ulx and a varying contribution may lead to the observed changes in the absorption column .",
    "thus , based on the currently available x - ray data on m  82 x-1 , it is neither possible to prove nor rule out the @xmath124 relation similar to that found for xrbs .",
    "m82 x-1 is one of the brightest ulxs . during the second _ xmm - newton _ observation ,",
    "its @xmath4 luminosity was @xmath130 ( sm03 ) , while it was a factor of @xmath131 brighter in the first _ xmm - newton _ observation .",
    "based on the first _ xmm - newton _ observation , sm03 quoted a bolometric luminosity of @xmath132 , equivalent to the eddington luminosity for a bh mass in the range of @xmath133 .",
    "given the uncertainty in the contamination by nearby x - ray sources , our estimated bh mass of m82  x-1 is marginally consistent with the observed luminosity and the eddington ratio .",
