    "one of the most outstanding astronomical discoveries of the last decade is the finding that every nearby massive galaxy harbors a central black hole with a mass directly proportional to that of the galaxy spheroid ( e.g. ,  magorrian 1998 ; ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt 2000 ; tremaine 2002 ; marconi & hunt 2003 ; hring & rix 2004 ) .",
    "this landmark result implies that all massive galaxies have hosted active galactic nuclei ( agn ) activity over the past @xmath7  13  gyrs ( e.g. ,  soltan 1982 ; yu & tremaine 2002 ; marconi 2004 ) and suggests that galaxies and their black holes might have grown concordantly , despite nine orders of magnitude difference in size scale ( e.g. ,  silk & rees 1998 ; fabian 1999 ; king 2003 ; wyithe & loeb 2003 ; di matteo 2005 ; bower 2006 ; croton 2006 ; hopkins 2006b ) .",
    "constraining the relative growth of the black hole and spheroid in the high - redshift progenitors of today s massive galaxies remains a fundamental goal of cosmology which can shed light on the connection between agn activity and star formation , and constrain galaxy formation models .",
    "a number of studies have searched for evolution in the black - hole ",
    "spheroid mass relationship at @xmath14  0.5 by `` weighing '' the black holes and host galaxies of luminous agn populations such as quasars and radio galaxies ( e.g. ,  shields 2003 , 2006 ; treu 2004 , 2007 ; adelberger & steidel 2005 ; mclure 2006 ; peng 2006 ) .",
    "these studies have typically concluded that the host galaxies of massive black holes ( @xmath15  @xmath16 ) at @xmath1  2 were up - to @xmath7  6 times less massive than those found for comparably massive black holes in the local universe , suggesting that the black hole may grow before the host galaxy .",
    "however , by focusing on luminous agns , these studies are biased toward selecting the most massive and rapidly growing black holes and could be biased toward evolved extragalactic source populations ( e.g. ,  lauer 2007 ) .",
    "these studies may therefore miss the early growth phase of today s massive galaxies where the black - hole ",
    "spheroid mass ratio may be different .",
    "this is an important consideration when attempting to model and understand how black holes and their host galaxies grow .    arguably , the best candidates for studying the early growth phase of today s massive galaxies are sub - millimeter ( submm ) emitting galaxies ( smgs ) , such as those identified in deep scuba surveys ( e.g. ,  smail 1997 , 2002 ; barger 1998 ; hughes 1998 ; scott 2002 ; webb 2003 ; borys 2003 ; coppin 2006 ) .",
    "after intensive multi - wavelength follow - up observations , it is clear that bright smgs ( @xmath17  mjy ) are ultra - luminous ( @xmath18  @xmath19 ) , gas - rich , massive galaxies at @xmath1  2 that are undergoing intense bursts of star formation ( e.g. ,  swinbank 2004 , 2006 ; chapman 2005 ; greve 2005 ; hainline 2006 ; kovcs 2006 ; tacconi 2006 ) ; their star - formation rates are large enough to form a massive galaxy of @xmath20  @xmath16 in just ( 12)@xmath21  yrs .",
    "the catalyst for this intense activity is probably galaxy major mergers ( e.g.,smail 1998 ; chapman 2003 ; conselice 2003 ) , which are predicted by hydrodynamical simulations to provide an effective mechanism to transport material toward the central region of the galaxy and trigger nuclear star formation and agn activity ( e.g. ,  di matteo 2005 ; springel 2005 ) .",
    "ultra - deep _ chandra _ observations ( the 2  ms _ chandra _ deep field - north survey ; alexander 2003a ) have shown that at least @xmath7  2850% of the bright smg population host heavily obscured agns ( e.g. ,  alexander 2003b , 2005a , b ) , implying joint growth of the galaxy and black hole ( see also ivison 2002 ; wang 2004 ; pope 2006 ) .",
    "the energetics of the agns measured at x - ray and mid - infrared ( mid - ir ) wavelengths are ( typically ) too low to explain the huge bolometric output of these objects ( @xmath22@xmath23  @xmath19 ; e.g. ,  ivison 2004 ; alexander 2003b , 2005b ; lutz 2005 ) , which appears to be dominated by star - formation processes ( as shown by the strong star - formation signatures in the mid - ir spectra ; e.g.,menndez - delmestre 2007 ; valiante 2007 ; pope 2008 ) .",
    "however , the large agn fraction implies that the black holes are growing almost continously throughout periods of vigorous star formation .",
    "this continuous black - hole growth suggests an abundance of available fuel , and hints that the accretion may be occuring at the eddington limit ( i.e. ,  exponential black - hole growth ; e.g. ,  rees 1984 ) .",
    "although hypothetical , this picture is in good agreement with models for the growth of black holes in smg - like systems ( e.g. ,  archibald 2002 ; di matteo 2005 ; king 2005 ; granato 2006 ; c.f . ,  chakrabarti 2007 ) .",
    "utilising deep rest - frame uv  near - ir observations , borys ( 2005 ) estimated the stellar masses of the x - ray obscured smgs identified in alexander ( 2005a ) .",
    "they suggested that the eddington - limited black - hole masses of these objects ( @xmath24  @xmath16 ) are @xmath7  50 times smaller than the black holes hosted by comparably massive normal galaxies ( @xmath25  @xmath16 ) in the local universe .",
    "this result suggests that either ( 1 ) the growth of the black hole lags that of the host galaxy in smgs , or ( 2 ) the black holes in smgs are accreting at sub - eddington rates .",
    "the former is in stark contrast with the growth of black holes determined for high - redshift quasars and radio galaxies ( e.g. ,  mclure 2006 ; peng 2006 ) while the latter is in conflict with that predicted by most models for the growth of smg - like systems with an abundance of available fuel ( e.g.,archibald 2002 ; granato 2006 ) .",
    "more direct constraints on the mases and eddington ratios ( @xmath5 ; i.e.,the fraction of the eddington limit ) of the black holes in smgs are required to distinguish between these different scenarios .",
    "these results can then be used to place constraints on the relative black - hole ",
    "galaxy growth of this key high - redshift population , including relating smgs to other high - redshift populations such as quasars and radio galaxies .",
    "in this paper we employ the well - established virial black - hole mass estimator ( e.g. ,  wandel 1999 ; kaspi 2000 ) to directly determine black - hole masses ( @xmath0 ) and @xmath26 for the small subset of smgs that have broad emission lines .",
    "the virial black - hole mass estimator provides the most direct and accessible method currently available to determine black - hole masses at high redshift , and this is the first study that has used this technique to estimate @xmath0 for the cosmologically important smg population .",
    "we use these results to estimate the black - hole properties of the x - ray obscured smgs identified in alexander ( 2005a , b ) .",
    "observations of nearby ultra - luminous ir galaxies ( @xmath27  @xmath19 ; ulirgs ; e.g. ,  sanders & mirabel 1996 ) hosting obscured agns are also used to determine the eddington ratios and intrinsic agn properties of these @xmath1  0 analogs to the x - ray obscured smg population and , by inference , place indirect constraints on the properties of typical smgs .",
    "we have adopted @xmath28  km  s@xmath29  mpc@xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 throughout .",
    "we have defined several samples to use in this study , which we briefly describe below . we have used two smg samples , a broad - line smg sample , to enable us to directly estimate @xmath32 and @xmath26 , and an x - ray obscured smg sample , which is more representative of the overall smg population than the broad - line smg sample .",
    "the broad - line smg sample is further broken down into `` lower - luminosity broad - line smgs '' , which includes objects with @xmath33  erg  s@xmath29 , and `` x - ray luminous broad - line smgs '' , which includes objects with @xmath34  erg  s@xmath29 ; see  3.1 for details of the sample selection . for",
    "the x - ray obscured smg sample we focus on the @xmath35 smgs that host x - ray identified agns in alexander ( 2005a , b ) , to probe the peak epoch of smg activity ( e.g. ,  @xmath1  2.2 ; chapman 2005 ) ; we thus removed three @xmath36 smgs , which make up the low - redshift tail of the smg population .",
    "the average redshift of the @xmath35 x - ray obscured smg sample ( @xmath37 ) is consistent with that of the broad - line smg sample ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "we have also defined two samples of nearby ulirgs to provide more direct insight into the black - hole masses and agns of dust - obscured objects with similar bolometric luminosities to the smg population . the first sample",
    "comprises ulirgs hosting obscured agn activity for which we were able to estimate @xmath0 and @xmath26 from the presence of broad near - ir emission lines ; see  4.1 for details of the sample selection . the second sample is distance limited and comprises all of the ulirgs hosting agn activity that lie within 200  mpc .",
    "the x - ray and far - ir data of this sample is used to assess whether the intrinsic properties of the agns in the x - ray obscured smg sample have been underestimated , which would lead to underestimates in @xmath0 ; see  4.2 for details of the sample selection .",
    "black - hole masses have been directly measured from the velocity dispersion of stars / gas in the nuclear regions of galaxies in the local universe ( e.g. ,  kormendy & richstone 1995 ; sarzi 2001 ; gebhardt 2003 ; pinkney 2003 ) .",
    "black holes can not be `` weighed '' using the same techniques at high redshift due to poorer spatial resolution and lower signal - to - noise ratio data .",
    "however , the well - established virial black - hole mass estimator , which works on the assumption that the broad - line region ( blr ) in agns is under the gravitational influence of the black hole ( i.e. ,  @xmath39 ; see peterson & wandel 1999 , 2000 for evidence ) , provides an apparently reliable , if indirect , measurement of @xmath0 for more distant agns ( e.g. ,  wandel 1999 ; kaspi 2000 ; mclure & dunlop 2002 ; vestergaard 2002 ; peterson 2004 ; vestergaard & peterson 2006 ) .",
    "using this technique , the masses of black holes in quasars up to @xmath1  6.4 have been estimated ( e.g. ,  willott 2003 ; mclure & dunlop 2004 ; vestergaard 2004 ) . the calibration of this technique is predominantly restricted to reverberation mapping of nearby agns in the local universe , however , the first reverberation mapping experiments at high redshift are already underway ( see kaspi 2007 ; kaspi 2007 ) .",
    "the primary aim of this paper is to estimate @xmath0 for the x - ray obscured smg sample to determine the relative black - hole ",
    "galaxy growth of smgs and explore their evolutionary status .",
    "the x - ray obscured smgs already have host - galaxy mass constraints ( e.g. ,  borys 2005 ) , and since @xmath7  2850% of smgs host heavily obscured agns they should be representative of the smg population . however , the presence of heavy absorption in these smgs hides the blr in the majority of these systems ( e.g. ,  swinbank 2004 ; alexander 2005b ; chapman 2005 ) , making it difficult to directly use the virial black - hole mass estimator to determine their black - hole properties .",
    "fortunately , the identification of broad emission lines from a small number of smgs ( e.g. ,  swinbank 2004 ; takata 2006 ) provides the opportunity to estimate the black - hole masses and eddington ratios for this subset of the smg population , providing a lever to determine constraints for the , more typical , x - ray obscured smgs .",
    "for example , taking the canonical approach that the relationship between broad - line agns and obscured agns is the orientation of an optically and geometrically thick torus ( i.e. ,  the unified agn model ; e.g. ,  antonucci 1993 ) , the average eddington ratios and black - hole masses of the x - ray obscured smgs should be comparable to the broad - line smgs . in this scenario we would calculate the black - hole masses of the smgs as    @xmath40    where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the black - hole mass and x - ray derived eddington - limited black - hole mass for the x - ray obscured smgs , and @xmath43 is the eddington ratio for the broad - line smgs , which is defined as    @xmath44    where @xmath45 is the x - ray - to - bolometric luminosity conversion .",
    "our overall approach is similar in essence to that adopted by mclure ( 2006 ) when exploring the black - hole ",
    "galaxy mass ratio for radio galaxies .",
    "we investigate @xmath0 , @xmath26 , and the black - hole ",
    "galaxy mass ratio for the smgs in  3 .    however , it is also possible that the relationship between the broad - line smgs and the x - ray obscured smgs is not the orientation of an obscuring torus toward the line of sight .",
    "for example , the broad - line smgs might represent a more evolved stage in the evolution of the smg population or they may be undergoing a period of increased mass accretion that makes the blr temporarily visible . since an optically bright broad - line agn is often considered to be at a later phase in the evolution of massive galaxies than an x - ray obscured agn ( e.g. ,  sanders 1988 ; granato 2006 ; hopkins 2006a ; chakrabarti 2007 ) , in the evolutionary scenario , the black - hole masses of the broad - line smgs will provide an upper limit to the black - hole masses of the x - ray obscured smgs . by comparison , in the increased mass accretion scenario , the black - hole masses of the x - ray obscured smgs would be the same as the broad - line smgs but the eddington ratios would be lower . unless we can rule out these alternative scenarios , our determination of @xmath0 for the x - ray obscured",
    "smgs will be subject to larger uncertainties .",
    "however , although the presence of absorption in the x - ray obscured smgs hinders direct black - hole mass measurements , the identification of broad pa@xmath3 in a small number of nearby obscured ulirgs provides the potential to gain insight into the eddington ratios for obscured agns similar to those found in the x - ray obscured smgs ( veilleux 1997 , 1999 ) , and hence distinguish between these different scenarios .",
    "the broad pa@xmath3 emission from these obscured ulirgs is thought to be observed through the atmosphere of a dusty obscuring torus , which is assumed to be optically thin at near - ir wavelengths .",
    "the similarity between the bolometric luminosities , spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , and morphological properties of smgs and nearby ulirgs suggests that distant smgs may be `` scaled - up '' versions of ulirgs , providing validation for this approach [ e.g. ,  mid - ir spectra ( menndez - delmestre 2007 ; valiante 2007 ) , submm dust / gas emission and extent ( greve 2005 , 2006 ; see table  2 in tacconi 2006 ) , major mergers ( chapman 2003 ; conselice 2003 ) ] .",
    "we determine @xmath0 , @xmath26 , and the black - hole ",
    "galaxy mass ratio for the nearby ulirgs in  4 .",
    "in this section we determine @xmath0 for the broad - line smgs using the virial black - hole mass estimator of greene & ho ( 2005 ) , which calculates black - hole masses solely from the properties of the h@xmath3 or h@xmath4 emission line , and reduces potential uncertainties on the luminosity of the agn ( e.g. ,  contaminating emission from the host galaxy or an accretion - related jet ) when compared to other estimators .",
    "we estimate eddington ratios for these sources using the black - hole mass and the x - ray luminosity , as a proxy for the mass accretion rate .",
    "we then compare the properties of the x - ray obscured smgs to the broad - line smgs and use these results to constrain @xmath0 and the black - hole ",
    "galaxy mass ratio for the more typical x - ray obscured smgs .",
    "the broad - line smg sample is selected from the redshift survey of submm - emitting galaxies by chapman ( 2005 ) , the same original source as the x - ray obscured smg sample ( alexander 2005a , b ) .",
    "the initial sample comprises 12 smgs with broad ( fwhm@xmath46  km  s@xmath29 ) h@xmath3 or h@xmath4 emission from swinbank ( 2004 ) , takata ( 2006 ) , and new keck nirspec data ( k.  menndez - delmestre et al .",
    ", in prep ) .",
    "we removed six objects where the [ oiii]@xmath475007 emission - line profile was found to be similar to the h@xmath3/h@xmath4 emission - line profile .",
    "[ oiii]@xmath475007 is a forbidden line that is not intrinsically broad ( typically fwhm@xmath48  km  s@xmath29 ) , suggesting that the broadening of the h@xmath3/h@xmath4 emission in these six objects might not be intrinsic to the blr and could , instead , be due to external kinematics ( e.g. ,  outflows and multiple components within galaxy mergers ; e.g. ,  heckman 1981 ; whittle 1985 , 1988 ) .",
    "however , before applying the virial black - hole mass estimator to the remaining six objects in the broad - line smg sample it is necessary to verify that the blr emission is not dominated by scattered light ( as would be expected if the blr was completely obscured ; e.g. ,  antonucci & miller 1985 ; young 1996 ) and to correct the broad - line emission for extinction .",
    "the detection of submm emission from the broad - line smgs implies the presence of dust , which might obscure the blr in some cases . to test if the blr emission is seen directly ( rather than in scattered light )",
    "we compared the broad - line luminosity to the rest - frame 210  kev luminosity ; see table  1 for the source properties .",
    "we found that the broad - line smgs have stronger h@xmath3 emission than expected from the local h@xmath3x - ray luminosity relationship of ward ( 1988 ) , indicating that the blr is brighter than found in typical broad - line agns , and demonstrating that the emission is being seen directly .",
    "indeed , the h@xmath3x - ray luminosity ratios of the broad - line smgs are similar to those of nearby ulirgs ( @xmath49 , a factor @xmath7  6 higher than the average in ward 1988 ; e.g. ,  imanishi & terashima 2004 ) .",
    "we estimated the extinction to the blr for each source on the basis of the broad h@xmath3/h@xmath4 emission - line ratio , following the prescription of ward ( 1987 ) for an intrinsic ratio of h@xmath50/h@xmath51  3.1 ( i.e. ,  case b recombination ; osterbrock 1989 ) and the reddening curve of calzetti ( 2000 ) .",
    "extinction corrections are rarely applied to the broad - line luminosities of agns used in studies estimating virial black - hole masses , even when rest - frame ultra - violet ( uv ) emission lines are used . however , even in our potentially dust obscured sample of broad - line agns we did not find evidence for large amounts of extinction ( the mean extinction correction was @xmath52  1.2  mags ) .",
    "the comparatively low level of extinction suffered by the nucleus when compared to the high extinction suffered by the star - forming regions in smgs ( e.g. ,  swinbank 2004 ; takata 2006 ) could be due to the dust tracing the extended star - forming regions rather than the nucleus ; we note that by selecting broad - line agns our sample will also be biased toward objects with low levels of nuclear extinction .",
    "the intrinsic broad h@xmath50/h@xmath53 emission - line ratio in many broad - line agns is larger than the theoretical case b limit ( e.g. ,  adams & weedman 1975 ; osterbrock 1977 ) , which would give slightly smaller black - hole masses for our broad - line smgs .",
    "two of the broad - line smgs did not have h@xmath3 emission - line constraints ; see table  1 .",
    "however , since these two objects are the optically brightest @xmath1  2 smgs in the chapman ( 2005 ) sample and have rest - frame uv and/or lower - order balmer broad emission lines in their spectra ( chapman 2005 ; takata 2006 ) , the extinction to their blrs are likely to be small . furthermore , since the average broad h@xmath3/h@xmath4 emission - line ratio of the agns used in the greene & ho ( 2005 ) virial black - hole mass estimation is larger than the expected intrinsic ratio ( the average broad h@xmath3/h@xmath4 ratio of the sample is 3.5 ) , this effectively allows for the inclusion of small amounts of reddening , and hence we adopted zero reddening for these two smgs .",
    "the basic properties of the broad - line smg sample are given in table  1 .",
    "although this sample is not complete , it is representative of smgs spanning a wide range in x - ray luminosity .",
    "we make a distinction between the broad - line smgs studied here and x - ray selected quasars detected at submm wavelengths ( e.g. , page 2001 ; 2004 ; stevens 2005 ) , which have smaller space densities than the smg populations studied here ; however , see  5.2 and coppin ( 2008 ) for possible overlap between these source populations",

    "we note that using different bolometric conversions ( e.g. ,  marconi et  al .",
    "2004 ; vasudevan & fabian 2007 ) will increase our estimate of the eddington ratio by up - to a factor of @xmath7  2 ( up - to @xmath85  70 for high accretion - rate agns ) .",
    "however , adopting different bolometric conversions will not change our determination of the black - hole masses for the x - ray obscured smgs ; see eqn .  3 &  3.4 .",
    "the x - ray luminosities of the six broad - line smgs were determined using _ chandra _ data from mushotzky ( 2000 ) , manners ( 2003 ) , and alexander ( 2003a ) .",

    "2 we show the x - ray derived mass accretion rate versus virial black - hole mass for the broad - line smg sample ; see  4.1 for a discussion of the obscured ulirgs .",
    "the most luminous broad - line smgs have an average eddington ratio comparble to those of @xmath77  1.82.1 sdss quasars with narrow broad lines ( @xmath86 ; e.g. ,  mclure & dunlop 2004 ) .",
    "however , an estimate of the average eddington ratio for the broad - line smg sample depends upon the distribution of the gas in the blr . if the blr gas is isotropically distributed and in random motion , as typically assumed , then the average eddington ratio is @xmath87 , while the average eddington ratio drops to @xmath88 if the blr gas is distributed in a disk that is observed close to pole on .",
    "the higher value is consistent with eddington - limited accretion while the lower value is similar to those found for the distant broad - line agn population ( e.g. ,  mclure & dunlop 2004 ; kollmeier 2006 ) and would appear to suggest that broad - line smgs are not growing their black holes at a significantly faster rate than typical submm - undetected broad - line agns ( only @xmath7  515% of @xmath1  2 quasars are submm detected ; priddey 2003 ; page 2004 ) .          due to the presence of heavy obscuration in the majority of the smg population ,",
    "we are unable to use the virial black - hole mass estimator to constrain directly the black - hole masses of the x - ray obscured smgs . however , if the x - ray obscured smgs are related to the broad - line smgs either via the orientation of an obscuring torus ( e.g. ,  antonucci 1993 ) or in terms of an evolutionary scenario ( e.g. ,  sanders 1988 ) , then we can use the black - hole masses and eddington ratios of the broad - line smgs to constrain the black - hole masses of the x - ray obscured smgs ; see  2 for discussion of these scenarios .",
    "for example , applying the eddington ratios of the broad - line smgs ( @xmath89  0.20.5 ) to the average eddington - limited black - hole mass of the @xmath35 x - ray obscured smg sample [ log(@xmath90/@xmath16 )  @xmath91 ; alexander 2005a ] gives ; see eqn .  1",

    "indeed , as can be seen in fig .",
    "3 , the x - ray luminosities for three of the broad - line smgs are @xmath7  10 times higher than the other broad - line smgs and the x - ray obscured smgs .",
    "the average black - hole mass and eddington ratio of these x - ray luminous broad - line smgs ( @xmath34  erg  s@xmath29 ) is log(@xmath98=  8.28.6 and @xmath8  0.40.9 , with an overall average of log(@xmath99  8.4 and @xmath100 . these black - hole masses and eddington ratios are similar to the average found for sdss quasars with fwhm@xmath78  km  s@xmath29 [ log(@xmath98=  8.5 ; @xmath101 ; see fig",
    ".  2 . the x - ray luminous broad - line smgs may therefore be more closely related to the submm - detected quasars studied by page ( 2001 , 2004 ) and stevens ( 2005 ) and are potentially more evolved objects than the x - ray obscured smgs ( e.g. ,  coppin 2008 ) .",
    "in contrast , the average black - hole mass and eddington ratio of the lower luminosity broad - line smgs ( @xmath33  erg  s@xmath29 ) is log(@xmath102=  7.88.2 and @xmath8  0.10.3 , depending upon the geometry of the blr gas ( see  3.2 ) , with an overall average of log(@xmath99  8.0 and @xmath103 .",
    "the x - ray obscured smgs lie in the same location of the @xmath10@xmath104 plane as the lower luminosity broad - line smgs , providing evidence that they are intrinsically similar systems where the nucleus is obscured at optical wavelengths in the x - ray obscured smgs ( e.g.,antonucci 1993 ) .",
    "under this scenario , the black - hole masses of the x - ray obscured smgs can be constrained from the eddington ratios of the broad - line smgs ; see eqn .  1 .",
    "since all of the lower luminosity broad - line smgs have @xmath105 , the estimated black - hole masses of the x - ray obscured smgs will be , and the average black - hole mass will be for the average eddington ratio of @xmath103 ; we provide further evidence for @xmath106 in  4 .",
    "we can combine the black - hole mass constraints with host - galaxy masses to extend the analyses of borys ( 2005 ) and explore the black - hole ",
    "galaxy mass relationship for the x - ray obscured smgs .",
    "the stellar - mass constraints from borys ( 2005 ) were calculated for the x - ray obscured smgs in alexander ( 2005a , b ) using rest - frame uv  near - ir observations ( ground - based , _",
    "hubble space telescope _ , and _",
    "imaging ) . adopting appropriate mass - to - light ratios for the stellar populations in these systems ( @xmath107  3.2 ) , borys ( 2005 ) found a mean stellar mass of @xmath108  @xmath16 for all of the smgs .",
    "however , excess rest - frame uv or near - ir emission beyond that expected from starlight indicates that agn activity is probably contaminating the stellar continuum in four galaxies ( see table  3 of borys 2005 ) .",
    "furthermore , the sample included three @xmath36 galaxies , which have lower redshifts than the broad - line smgs .",
    "therefore , when calculating the average stellar masses here we have only considered the six @xmath35 x - ray obscured smgs that do not have a uv or near - ir excess in borys ( 2005 ) , giving a mean stellar mass of @xmath109  @xmath16 , a factor @xmath7  2 less than the mean of all of the @xmath35 x - ray obscured smgs in borys ( 2005 ; @xmath110  @xmath16 ) .",
    "this stellar mass estimate is consistent with the galactic masses estimated from the co dynamics [ @xmath111  @xmath16 ; greve 2005 ; see swinbank 2004 , 2006 for similar h@xmath3 dynamical constraints ] .",
    "the maraston ( 2005 ) stellar population models , which take into account thermally pulsating asymptotic giant branch ( tp - agb ) stars , would predict similar stellar masses if the starbursts in smgs are long lived , as typically assumed . however , even in a less likely scenario where the starbursts in smgs are short lived ( i.e. ,  @xmath112  10  myrs ; which leads to improbably high space densities for the @xmath1  0 descendants of smgs ) , the stellar masses estimated from the maraston ( 2005 ) model are still only @xmath112  3 times lower than those given here ( see swinbank 2008 for a detailed discussion ) .    the local black - hole ",
    "galaxy mass relationship that we have adopted here is based on the galaxy spheroid rather than the entire galaxy .",
    "the co dynamical constraints of greve ( 2005 ) trace the mass within the central @xmath113  kpc of smgs , where the majority of the co gas lies ( e.g. ,  tacconi 2006 ) , while the stellar masses will include the whole galaxy .",
    "since the effective radius for early - type galaxies with @xmath114  @xmath16 is @xmath115  kpc [ see fig .  2 of desroches 2007 for @xmath116  21.5 ( @xmath7@xmath117 ) ; bell 2003 ] , the co gas is tracing scales smaller than the spheroid and therefore provides a lower limit to the spheroid mass .",
    "we also note here that the co dynamical constraint includes all baryonic material , not just the stars , however , the gas is likely to be ultimately converted to stars in these systems .",
    "similarly , the stellar mass is @xmath7  2 times the co dynamical mass and corresponds to the entire galaxy .",
    "however , since the surface - brightness distributions of most smgs are reasonably well fitted with a spheroid - like @xmath118 profile ( borys 2008 ) , the stellar masses of these galaxies are likely to be dominated by the spheroid .",
    "furthermore , we note that if smgs are massive elliptical galaxies in formation ( e.g. ,  blain 2004 ; swinbank 2006 ; tacconi 2006 ) , as commonly assumed , then any non - spheroid component in the host galaxy is likely to be subsumed within the existing spheroid component . in this scenario ,",
    "the entire stellar mass would ultimately represent the final galaxy spheroid mass of the system .    in fig .",
    "4 we plot the black - hole versus galaxy mass for the @xmath35 x - ray obscured smgs , with the objects with excess emission removed ; the average estimated black - hole mass of these objects is the same as that given for the full sample in  3.4 [ log(@xmath119/@xmath16 )  @xmath7  7.8 ; i.e. ,  log(@xmath90/@xmath16 )  @xmath91 ] .",

    "the primary reason for this difference is due to using @xmath106 ( rather than @xmath123 assumed by borys 2005 ) , although the exclusion of the smgs with excess emission also contributes to the higher value determined here .",
    "our analyses in  3 provided the first quantitative estimates of the black - hole masses and black - hole ",
    "galaxy mass relationship of the smg population .",
    "we estimated the black - hole masses of the x - ray obscured smgs under the assumption that they are the obscured counterparts of the lower - luminosity broad - line smgs , finding for @xmath8  0.2 .",
    "however , there are a number of uncertainities that could be better constrained .",
    "first , it would be useful to have independent black - hole mass constraints for the x - ray obscured smgs , to reduce the need to make assumptions about their relationship with the broad - line agns and to minimise the potential inclination - dependent effects on the widths of the broad emission lines .",
    "second , the determination of the black - hole masses of the x - ray obscured smgs depend upon accurate intrinsic x - ray luminosities , which relies on correcting the observed x - ray luminosities for the effect of absorption .",
    "we deal with these two issues here by studying nearby ulirgs that host obscured agns .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that the observations of nearby ulirgs are often more extensive and of a considerably higher signal - to - noise ratio than that obtained for distant smgs , although clearly the disadvantage is that we will be studying objects at a different epoch to the smgs .",
    "however , the similarity in the properties of smgs and the nearby ulirgs , and the fact that they both appear to be major - merger induced events suggests that smgs could be `` scaled - up '' versions of ulirgs ( e.g. ,  tacconi 2006 ) , providing some support for our general approach ( see  2.2 ) .",
    "although the presence of obscuration prevents the opportunity to measure the black - hole properties of the x - ray obscured smgs , the identification of broad pa@xmath3 emission provides the chance to constrain @xmath0 and @xmath26 in a small number of nearby ulirgs hosting obscured agns ( e.g. ,  veilleux 1997 , 1999 ) . the broad - line emission from these sources",
    "is thought to be observed through the atmosphere of the dusty torus , which is assumed to be optically thin at near - ir wavelengths .",
    "a benefit of focusing on obscured agns is that any potential inclination - dependent affects on the black - hole mass and eddington ratio will be minimised since the blr is unlikely to be seen close to pole on .    out of the sample of 64",
    "nearby obscured ulirgs observed by veilleux ( 1997 , 1999 ) , six have broad pa@xmath3 emission ; see table  2 for their properties .",
    "we determined the black - hole masses of these objects using the greene & ho ( 2005 ) virial black - hole mass estimator by correcting the pa@xmath3 luminosity to that expected for h@xmath3 using the case b approximation ( h@xmath3/pa@xmath3  =  8.6 ; e.g.,hummer & storey 1987 ) ; see fig .  1 .",
    "2 we show the mass accretion rate versus virial black - hole mass for the four obscured ulirgs that have sensitive x - ray constraints . the mass accretion rates were estimated from the absorption - corrected x - ray luminosity following  3.3 , and we converted to the 0.58.0  kev band assuming @xmath124 , when necessary . the eddington ratios of these obscured ulirgs range from @xmath89  0.10.5 , with an average of @xmath125 .",

    "when combined with host - galaxy mass constraints , the black holes of the x - ray obscured smgs appear to be @xmath7  35 times smaller than those found for comparably massive galaxies in the local universe , implying that the growth of the black hole lags that of the host galaxy in smgs .",
    "we provided corroborating evidence for this result from analyses of nearby obscured ulirgs , potentially the @xmath1  0 analogs of the x - ray obscured smgs . in this final section we compare our results to those found for @xmath1  2 radio galaxies and quasars and explore the evolutionary status and black - hole growth of the x - ray obscured smgs .",
    "our results for the x - ray obscured smgs are statistically inconsistent with investigations of @xmath1  2 radio galaxies and luminous quasars , where it has been found that the black holes hosted by these objects are up - to @xmath7  6 times larger than those found for comparably massive galaxies in the local universe ( e.g. ,  mclure 2006 ; peng 2006 ) .",
    "we demonstrate this in fig .  7 , where we show the black - hole  galaxy mass ratio versus redshift for the x - ray obscured smgs and compare them to the @xmath1  2 radio galaxies and quasars and the @xmath1  0 obscured ulirgs with black - hole mass constraints . to be consistent with the results of peng ( 2006 ) , the black holes in the smgs would need to be @xmath12  10 times more massive than those estimated here ( i.e. ,  @xmath163  @xmath16 ) .",
    "however , none of the broad - line smgs in our sample have such high black - hole masses , even allowing for potential blr inclination angle effects . furthermore , black holes with @xmath164  @xmath16 are rare even in the local universe , with a space density of @xmath165  mpc@xmath166 ( e.g. ,  mclure & dunlop 2004 ) , which is comparable to the observed space density of @xmath1  2 smgs and about an order of magnitude lower than the smg space density _ corrected _ for a 300  myr submm - bright phase ( @xmath167  mpc@xmath166 ; see  4.2 of swinbank 2006 ) .",
    "these analyses show that the @xmath1  0 descendants of typical smgs can not host massive black holes of @xmath163  @xmath16 and therefore suggests that the most luminous radio galaxies and quasars investigated by mclure ( 2006 ) and peng ( 2006 ) have a different evolutionary path to the smgs .",
    "indeed , given the significantly larger fraction of radio galaxies that are submm - detected at @xmath168 when compared to the submm - detected fraction of radio galaxies at @xmath169 ( @xmath12  75% at @xmath168 versus @xmath7  15% at @xmath169 ; archibald 2001 ) , it seems likely that these galaxies ( which represent the most massive galaxies at every epoch ; seymour 2007 ) underwent their major star - formation phases at higher redshifts than the smg population .",
    "we note that this conclusion is also consistent with detailed spectral fitting of the stellar populations of nearby massive galaxies ( e.g. ,  nelan 2005 ; panter 2007 ) .    however , it is also possible that the variations in the @xmath119@xmath13 relationship at @xmath1  2 are due to selection effects , as first suggested by lauer ( 2007 ) .",
    "the selection of the most luminous quasars and radio galaxies will clearly identify the most massive black holes since the eddington limit restricts the luminosity of small accreting black holes , potentially causing a bias toward objects with large @xmath0@xmath13 ratios .",
    "it is not clear that the selection of smgs will cause an opposite bias since there is not an equivalent stellar - mass based eddington - limited restriction in star - forming galaxies .",
    "however , empirically , the galaxies that are undergoing the most intense star formation at @xmath1  2 also appear to be massive galaxies at this epoch ( e.g. ,  papovich 2006 ) , suggesting that the selection of smgs will cause a bias toward the identification of massive galaxies . however , this selection is probably not as closely coupled to a bias in the @xmath0@xmath13 as the selection of radio galaxies and quasars .",
    "our results show that the @xmath1  0 descedants of smgs can not host black holes with @xmath164  @xmath16 .",
    "indeed , on the basis of dynamical mass estimates , stellar luminosities , and star - formation lifetimes , swinbank ( 2006 ) have shown that the local descendants of smgs are likely to be @xmath170 early - type galaxies [ @xmath171  @xmath16 , assuming the bell ( 2003 ) luminosity and stellar - mass functions ] , with space densities of @xmath172  mpc@xmath166 .",
    "we therefore expect the @xmath1  0 descendants of smgs to host black holes with @xmath173  @xmath16 , comparable to those of the x - ray luminous broad - line smgs .",
    "this would suggest that the black holes of smgs and their descendants typically only need to grow by a factor of @xmath7  6 by the present day .",
    "can we account for this black - hole growth in the estimated submm - bright lifetime of smgs ( @xmath7  100300  myrs ) ?    assuming that the black holes in the x - ray obscured smgs are growing at @xmath8  0.2 ( the average eddington rate estimated in  3.4 ) , it will take @xmath7  400  myrs for them to increase in mass by a factor @xmath7  6 .",
    "since we are likely to be observing a typical smg halfway through its submm - bright phase , this lifetime is longer than the remaining gas consumption timescale ( i.e. ,  @xmath7  150  myrs , taking the @xmath7  300  myr total lifetime estimated by swinbank 2006 ) .",
    "however , as mentioned in  3.4 , the eddington ratios derived for the broad - line smgs should only be considered indicative and it is possible that the x - ray obscured smgs are growing their black holes at @xmath174 .",
    "for example , taking the latest derivation of bolometric corrections from vasudevan & fabian ( 2007 ) for high accretion rate agns , the estimated eddington ratio would be @xmath8  0.4 ( i.e.,@xmath175  70 ; see  3.3 ) , which is sufficient for a black hole to grow by a factor @xmath7  6 in @xmath7  200  myrs and broadly consistent with current estimates for the submm - bright lifetime of smgs .",
    "we can also take the alternative approach adopted by kawakatu ( 2007b ) for local ulirgs , and assume that the bolometric luminosity produced by smgs is entirely due to agn activity . under this hypothesis",
    "we would estimate eddington ratios of @xmath8  2 ( i.e. ,  for a mean @xmath176  @xmath16 ; see fig .",
    "however , we consider this scenario too extreme since all of the current evidence indicates that star - formation dominates the bolometric luminosity of typical smgs , as witnessed by ( 1 ) the correlation between far - ir luminosity and reddening corrected h@xmath3 sfr ( e.g. ,  swinbank 2004 ; takata 2006 ) , ( 2 ) the strong pah features seen in their mid - ir spectra and the correlation between the luminosity of the pah emission and the total ir luminosity ( e.g.,menndez - delmestre 2007 ; pope 2008 ) , ( 3 ) the extended radio emission in high resolution ( @xmath177  kpc ) maps ( e.g. ,  chapman 2004 ; biggs & ivison 2008 ) , and ( 4 ) the absorption - corrected x - ray to far - ir luminosities , which indicate that agn activity contributes @xmath7  10% of the bolometric luminosity ( e.g. ,  alexander 2005b ) .",
    "all of these facts suggest that the bolometric luminosity of smgs is dominated by star - formation , and therefore this determination of the eddington ratio provides a firm upper limit .",
    "finally , we consider the properties of the x - ray luminous ( @xmath178  erg  s@xmath29 ) broad - line smgs ; see  3.4 .",
    "these objects have more massive black holes than the x - ray obscured smgs and they might represent transition objects between typical smgs and typical unobscured quasars ( e.g. ,  coppin 2008 ) ; see fig .",
    "7 for constraints on their @xmath0@xmath13 ratio , assuming that they have host - galaxy masses comparable to the x - ray obscured smgs . the location of the x - ray luminous broad - line smgs in the @xmath10@xmath11 plane indicates that these objects might be similar to the submm - detected quasars identified by page ( 2001 , 2004 ) and stevens ( 2005 ) .",
    "it has been argued that submm - detected quasars represent a late stage in the evolution of smgs ( e.g. ,  coppin 2008 ) , where accretion - related outflows from the black hole have started to remove gas and dust from the nucleus and the host galaxy ( as suggested by most models ; e.g. , sanders 1988 ; di matteo 2005 ; king 2005 ; granato 2006 ; hopkins 2006a ; chakrabarti 2007 )",
    ". a natural consequence of these accretion - related outflows should be a decrease in the fraction of luminous obscured agns .",
    "it is therefore interesting that current submm surveys have not yet identified a large population of luminous x - ray obscured quasars ( see bautz 2000 , mainieri 2005 , and pope 2008 for some objects ) , indicating that they are rare .",
    "the combination of the wide - area scuba2 cosmology legacy survey ( see footnote 4 ) with moderately deep x - ray and ir coverage will provide the most definitive constraints on the ubiquity of submm - detected x - ray obscured quasars and test whether they are transition objects between typical smgs and typical unobscured quasars .",
    "we have placed direct observational constraints on the black - hole masses ( @xmath0 ) and eddington ratios ( @xmath179 ) of the cosmologically important @xmath1  2 smg population , and used measured host - galaxy masses to explore their evolutionary status .",
    "our main findings are the following :    1 .   we used the virial black - hole mass estimator to `` weigh '' the black holes in six smgs with broad h@xmath3 or h@xmath4 emission and found that they typically host black holes with log(@xmath9 )  @xmath7  8.08.4 and @xmath8  0.20.5 , depending on the geometry of the broad - line region gas .",
    "these black holes are @xmath7  0.4  dex smaller than those found for @xmath1  2 optically bright quasars in the sdss with comparably `` narrow '' broad lines . see  3.13.3 .",
    "we found that the lower - luminosity broad - line smgs ( @xmath180  erg  s@xmath29 ) lie in the same location of the @xmath10@xmath11 plane as more typical smgs hosting x - ray obscured agns ( x - ray obscured smgs ) .",
    "these two subsets of the smg population may be intrinsically similar , where the rest - frame optical nucleus is visible in the broad - line smgs ( as suggested by the unified agn model ) . under this hypothesis",
    ", the x - ray obscured smgs host black holes of log(@xmath6 )  @xmath7  7.8 with @xmath106 ; we find corroborating evidence for @xmath103 from detailed analyses of nearby obscured ulirgs with broad pa@xmath3 emission , potentially the local analogs of the x - ray obscured smgs . by comparison , the black holes and eddington ratios of the x - ray luminous broad - line smgs ( @xmath34  erg  s@xmath29 ) are log(@xmath6 )  @xmath7  8.4 and @xmath8  0.6 , suggesting that they are more evolved objects than typical smgs .",
    "see  3.43.5 , &  4.1 .",
    "we demonstrated that the x - ray absorption corrections and estimated absorbing column densities of the x - ray obscured smgs are consistent with those typically found for nearby ulirgs .",
    "this suggests that we have not significantly underestimated the intrinsic x - ray luminosities ( and therefore the black - hole masses ) of the x - ray obscured smgs .",
    "see  4.2 .",
    "we combined the black - hole mass constraints with measured host - galaxy masses [ @xmath181  ( 12 )  @xmath182  @xmath16 ] .",
    "we found that x - ray obscured smgs typically host black holes @xmath12  3 times smaller than those found in comparably massive normal galaxies in the local universe , albeit with considerable uncertainty , and @xmath12  10 times smaller than those predicted for @xmath1  2 populations .",
    "these results imply that the growth of the black hole lags that of the host galaxy in smgs , in stark contrast with that previously found for optical and radio selected luminous quasars at @xmath1  2 , which is probably due to the smgs being selected at an earlier evolutionary stage than the quasars .",
    "we also found that the growth of the black hole lags that of the host galaxy in local ulirgs .",
    "see  3.5 , ",
    "4.3 , &  5 .",
    "we provided evidence that the black holes of the descendants of smgs are likely to be @xmath184  @xmath16 , rather than the @xmath185  @xmath16 that would be required if they were to lie on the @xmath0@xmath13 relationship found for @xmath1  2 radio galaxies and quasars .",
    "this implies that smgs only need to grow their black holes by a factor @xmath7  6 by the present day , which can be achieved within current estimates for the submm - bright lifetime of smgs , provided that the black holes are growing at rates close to the eddington limit .",

    "for example , mid - ir spectroscopy with the _ james webb space telescope _",
    "( _ jwst _ ; gardner 2006 ) will yield constraints on the presence of broad emission lines in the rest - frame near - ir band , potentially providing a direct route to estimating the black - hole masses of the x - ray obscured smgs , and the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ; kawakatu 2007a ; wootten 2006 ) will provide resolved dynamical measurements of the host galaxy down to @xmath7  100  pc scales , including the circumnuclear region around the black hole . if sufficiently sensitive optical and near - ir spectropolarimeters can be developed on 3050  m telescopes then it may also be possible to directly search for the presence of broad emission lines in scattered light in the x - ray obscured smgs ( e.g. ,  antonucci & miller 1985 ; young 1996 ) . finally , x - ray observations from planned and proposed telescopes over the next @xmath7  1015 years will provide the potential to constrain the energetics of the agn activity , from either high signal - to - noise high - resolution spectroscopy or photometric measurements out to x - ray energies of @xmath7  100  kev [ e.g. ,  the japanese x - ray observatory _ next _ ; ozawa ( 2006 ) , the nasa observatories _ constellation - x _ ( white 2004 ) and _ nustar _ ( harrison 2005 ) , and the esa observatory _ xeus _ ; parmar ( 2006 ) ] .",
