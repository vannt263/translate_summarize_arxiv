    "how do the correlations of natural quantum states of many - body systems behave ?",
    "if `` natural '' is taken to mean `` generic '' in the sense of a random pure state drawn from the haar measure , then the answer to this question is : subsystems will almost surely be very nearly maximally correlated with their complementary subsystems . however ,",
    "this is not the situation that one is usually interested in in many - body and condensed - matter physics .",
    "ground states of local hamiltonians typically exhibit far less entanglement than that suggested by the previous argument .",
    "indeed , there is a large body of evidence @xcite , suggesting that ground states of gapped quantum many - body systems on lattices satisfy an _ area law _ @xcite for the entanglement entropy . in other words ,",
    "given the pure state of a lattice system , if one distinguishes a certain ( connected ) region of the lattice , then the von - neumann ( or renyi ) entropy of the reduced state associated with this region does not grow , as one might expect , like the number of degrees of freedom of this region ( its `` volume '' ) . instead , it scales like the number of degrees of freedom on the boundary , hence as its `` area '' .",
    "area laws have been shown for all gapped one - dimensional models with local interactions @xcite .",
    "extensions to classes of higher - dimensional lattice models have also been obtained @xcite .",
    "these results and others therefore suggest that ground states of quantum many - body systems are much less entangled than they could be .",
    "these measures of entanglement  refined quantities revealing much more detailed information about the structure of correlations than more conventional correlation functions  in a way inherit the decay of correlations .",
    "this deep insight is also at the basis of classical efficient simulations of quantum many - body systems : the formulation and analysis of many - body systems in terms of matrix - product and other tensor network states have put this intuition on a solid theoretical footing @xcite . in numerical simulations of many - body systems ,",
    "the importance of such approximations can hardly be overestimated . as a consequence ,",
    "the last decade has seen an enormous amount of interest in the study of entanglement in quantum many - body systems in the condensed matter context and in issues of numerical simulation @xcite , entanglement spectra @xcite , and their relationship to quantifiers of topological order @xcite .",
    "can this analysis be extended to thermal states ?",
    "a moment of thought reveals that the entanglement entropy should in fact satisfy a volume law for thermal states .",
    "however , it turns out that the entanglement entropy is not the right quantity to grasp the correlations of a mixed quantum state .",
    "there exist many such measures , but the most natural and the most frequently adopted one is the _ mutual information_. for a subset @xmath0 of sites of the lattice and its complement @xmath1 , it is defined as @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the reduced states of @xmath5 with respect to @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively . for pure states ,",
    "the mutual information reduces to twice the entanglement entropy .",
    "one might then hope that this quantity fulfills an area law for thermal states of local hamiltonians on a lattice .",
    "this turns out to be true in fact for any fixed temperature @xcite .",
    "specifically , for the gibbs states of a hamiltonians with local interactions on a lattice , and with bounded operator norm @xmath6 , one finds that @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the boundary area of the region labelled @xmath0 .",
    "this statement is in fact surprisingly simple to prove .",
    "it following rather directly from the extremality of gibbs states with respect to the free energy .",
    "the strength of this result - that it is completely general - also constitutes its weakness ; eq .",
    "( [ lineararealaw ] ) does not say anything about the correlation behaviour of thermal states of specific models .",
    "given that the bound is linearly divergent in the inverse temperature , the law becomes less and less tight in the limit of small temperatures .",
    "in particular , at zero temperature , we know that there can be logarithmic corrections to the area law for critical systems . hence , it would be desirable to have bounds which depend more explicitly on the properties of the system at hand .",
    "what is more , asymptotically exact results for important classes of `` laboratory '' models seem important .    in this work , we present asymptotically exact results for important classes of `` laboratory '' models .",
    "we introduce a framework capable of rigorously computing the mutual information in free fermionic lattice models .",
    "this framework is based on new approximation techniques as well as on proof tools for dealing with tplitz matrices with smooth symbols .",
    "we separate the presentation in a discussion of the one - dimensional case and one of the higher - dimensional situation of a cubic lattice with the topology of a torus .",
    "we find rigorous area laws for the mutual information that are meaningful in the limit of small temperatures , and converge to the known results for the entanglement entropy for ground states @xcite .",
    "this feature is even present in higher - dimensional fermionic lattice models @xcite . for low temperatures ,",
    "we find a logarithmic divergence of the mutual information in the inverse temperature , in fact confirming predictions of conformal field theory .",
    "this scaling suggests that in order to detect criticality , extremely low temperatures are needed .",
    "this is an exponential improvement in the inverse temperature to the above bound .",
    "mathematically , we discuss new methods of approximation , allowing to use tplitz matrix techniques to studying arbitrary subsystems of translationally invariant fermionic models .",
    "what is more , we introduce a novel second order szeg theorem , simplifying widom s formula for smooth symbols .",
    "this approach allows to use the trace formula without encountering an infinite sum leading to arbitrarily highly oscillatory terms .",
    "hence , apart from the application in the study of quantum many - body physics , we expect our results to be a highly useful tool in the abstract theory of tplitz determinants .",
    "the paper is structured as follows :    * in section [ stage ] , we introduce renyi entropy mutual informations for free fermionic models , discuss fermionic covariance matrices and present new , easily computable and practical upper and lower bounds to mutual informations . * in section [ statement ] , we go on to formulate the problem , and we provide a synopsis of the mathematical argument .",
    "a general proof strategy for computing the mutual information is also provided .",
    "* section [ mainresult ] contains the main theorem  the asymptotically exact expression for the mutual information  and the core of the proof .",
    "since the argument is general enough to capture expressions deriving from all renyi entropies , the complete knowledge of the spectrum of reduced states is also obtained in this fashion .",
    "this section reports also the main technical progress when it comes to dealing with tplitz matrices with smooth symbols . *",
    "section [ sec : temp ] is dedicated to a thorough discussion of the temperature dependence of the area law , with an emphasis on the the very low temperatures behavior . *",
    "we then turn to higher - dimensional free fermionic models on the torus in section [ torussec ] , which we can treat with similar methods . * finally , we present an outlook in section [ outlook ] , comparing the findings with predictions of conformal field theory , and discussing implications to the study of entanglement spectra @xcite .",
    "we also consider the implications for noise - driven , open fermionic quantum many - body systems , as have recently been discussed also in the context of open majorana wires and notions of noise - driven criticality @xcite .",
    "in this work , we focus on isotropic translationally invariant fermionic models . for now , we assume the most general form for the couplings . later",
    ", we will concentrate on the fermionic variant of the xx spin model ( under the jordan - wigner transformation ) , which is a particularly important special case . in this section",
    ", we introduce the class of models discussed here .      we consider free fermionic models on cubic lattices @xmath9 for some even @xmath10 as @xmath11 becomes large .",
    "bi - sected geometries on the torus can be related to the situation of having @xmath12 . for simplicity of notation , but without loss of generality , we will therefore present this one - dimensional case in the main part of this work , while discussing the higher - dimensional situation in section [ torussec ] .",
    "the hamiltonian takes the general form @xmath13 with @xmath14 being a circulant matrix , referred to as the _ hamiltonian matrix_. we assume the coupling to be an specified , finite - ranged interaction of arbitrary interaction length @xmath15 .",
    "the couplings are defined by a sequence of numbers @xmath16 with the property that @xmath17 for @xmath18 . then take @xmath19 having a natural reflection symmetry , @xmath20 , and consider the hamiltonian matrix with entries @xmath21 for @xmath22 .",
    "this situation is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:1d ] . the most important special case is constituted by the fermionic variant of the _ xx model _ , which is originally a model for spin-@xmath23 systems . here",
    ", we directly consider its fermionic instance , by virtue of the jordan wigner transformation . in this language ,",
    "@xmath24 for @xmath25 and @xmath26 , so that @xmath27 is a circulant matrix with @xmath28 on the main diagonal and @xmath29 on the first off - diagonal .",
    "all these models are integrable and exactly solvable .",
    "thermal states are defined entirely by the collection of second moments of fermionic operators .",
    "the arbitrary finite range of interactions has in the main text been chosen for simplicity of notation only , and exponentially decaying interactions can easily be accommodated as well .",
    "a generalisation to exponentially decaying interactions is possible .",
    "since @xmath27 is circulant , we find the spectrum @xmath30 of @xmath27 to be @xmath31 for the well - studied fermionic variant of the xx model , see eq .",

    "these majorana fermions are hermitian , traceless , and form a clifford algebra .",
    "we are interested in thermal states of the quadratic hamiltonians , which are particular instances of ( quasi)-free or gaussian fermionic states .",

    "matrix functions of the covariance matrix can be computed exactly .",
    "this is the case because any covariance matrix is unitarily equivalent to a direct sum of @xmath41 covariance matrices , reflecting a situation of entirely uncoupled fermionic modes .",
    "this is the fermionic analogue of what is often called the williamson normal form in the bosonic setting . as a consequence",

    "we allow for arbitrary temperatures and will also later consider the asymptotic limits @xmath49 and @xmath50 .    reduced states of gaussian states are always gaussian ( as can be seen most easily by considering their grassman representation ; compare ref .",
    "the covariance matrix of a reduced state is the appropriate principle sub - matrix of the full covariance matrix .",
    "applied to gibbs states , we find that the reduced state of a subset @xmath51 is a gaussian state with covariance matrix @xmath52 where @xmath53 denotes the principal sub - matrix associated with the degrees of freedom of subsystem @xmath0 .",

    "colloquially speaking , such tplitz matrices largely resemble circulant matrices , with the `` upper right and lower left corners '' deviating from a strict circulant matrix .",
    "in fact , most of the theory on tplitz matrices ( tplitz determinants ) is in one way or the other concerned with the error made when replacing a tplitz matrix by a circulant matrix of the same dimension .",

    "in fact , given our assumptions on the interaction parameters , much better regularity results can be derived as we will show and use later on .",
    "mathematically , @xmath65 is equivalent to the requirement that the associated tplitz operator generates a continuous linear operator on @xmath66 .",
    "furthermore , note that all spectra can be expressed entirely in terms of the symbol .",
    "the starting point of our analysis is the following observation : covariance matrices of subsystems of thermal states of translationally invariant fermionic models are well approximated by tplitz matrices . since the hamiltonian matrix @xmath27 in eq .",

    "however , the given double integral always involves complex valued integration whereas our formula contains only real valued integrands right from the beginning ( whenever the symbol is real - valued and the analytic function restricted to the reals is also real - valued as usually satisfied in problems of practical relevance ) .",
    "indeed , the idea to approach the trace formula starting with the inverse function rather then the usual logarithm ( the term @xmath307 from szeg s theorem is just the second order term of the logarithm ) has many didactical and computational advantages in our opinion .",
    "first of all , this computationally inappropriate and practically incomputable @xmath308sum in @xmath240 is missing right from the beginning ",
    "note that for larger and larger @xmath255 , the integrand becomes more and more oscillatory in a fashion that is hard to grasp .",
    "furthermore , there exist well - known asymptotic expansions for asymptotic inverses even for higher order terms ( which are very useful for approximate solutions of systems of linear equation with coefficient matrix being a tplitz matrix for example ) .",
    "last but not least the authors of ref.@xcite were able to derive second order formulas for block tplitz matrices ( which require  unlike the final result in the one - dimensional setting ",
    "an explicit factorisation of @xmath309 where @xmath310 is the matrix - valued symbol and @xmath110 is an arbitrary complex number on the integration contour ) .",
    "our main result , theorem [ mainresult ] , gives an asymptotically exact expression for the mutual information of two neighbouring blocks of fermions in one dimension .",
    "it has been shown that for a given inverse temperature @xmath43 , @xmath311 in the system size @xmath11 .",
    "the result given constitutes an easily computable expression that paves the way for studying a number of physically meaningful regimes . at this point",
    ", we would like to pause for a moment , however , and would like to come back to one of the questions posed in the introduction , namely of the possible asymptotic behaviour of @xmath312 for large and small inverse temperatures . as we have seen above , the general bound of ref .",
    "@xcite following from the extremality of the free energy suggests that the mutual information should scale like @xmath48 for large temperatures , @xmath313 one might wonder whether this bound actually gives the proper asymptotic scaling on the temperature .",
    "conformal field theory actually suggests a behaviour which is logarithmic rather than linearly in the inverse temperature @xcite . in this section",
    ", we corroborate the prediction from conformal field theory by showing that the low temperature asymptotics are given by @xmath314 this has a quite remarkable consequence : in order to see features of the criticality of the ground state , one has to go to extremely low temperatures .",
    "this dependence is also convincingly depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : pic11 ] , where a logarithmic scale has been chosen  otherwise , signatures of ground state features could hardly be detected . only at extraordinarily low temperatures ,",
    "the familiar logarithmic divergence in the system size of the sub - block chosen becomes visible for a reasonably sized subsystem .",
    "needless to say , the low temperature asymptotics depends on the choice of the model parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "specifically , the scaling of the mutual information reflects signatures of the zero temperature quantum phase transition of this model taking place at @xmath315 . whenever @xmath316 the model is critical in its ground state , i.e. , there is no energy gap .",
    "it is known that the entanglement entropy then exhibits a logarithmic divergence ",
    "signatures of that are also seen in the mutual information at small but non - zero temperature .",
    "if the model is gapped , i.e. , whenever @xmath317 , the ground state is the vacuum or the fully occupied state , depending on the sign of @xmath28 . as expected , the mutual information converges exponentially quickly to zero in the non - critical phase at a rate proportional to the energy gap .",
    "the main insights for this model are summarised in the following theorem :    [ theo : tempdep ] the ( @xmath318 ) mutual information of the thermal state of the fermionic xx model with parameters @xmath319 and @xmath320 satisfies @xmath321 whenever @xmath322 , then @xmath323 whenever @xmath324 , then for any @xmath325 @xmath326    the proof of this statement is rather involved and requires a number of techniques developed in lemmas : hence , for better readability of the main text , it will be presented in the appendix in subsection [ tempproof ] .",
    "the results established above readily apply to the situation of a bi - sected , higher - dimensional fermionic lattice system on the torus .",
    "a quite similar strategy has already been exploited , e.g. , in ref .",
    "@xcite . using appropriate discrete fourier transforms",
    ", one can disentangle the constituents from each other with respect to all but one dimensions .",
    "the exception is the dimension in which the two regions labeled @xmath0 and @xmath1 are singled out , see fig .",
    "[ fig : torus ] . in this way",

    "we highlight the results obtained in this manner .",
    "an important application of this is the computation of the mutual information in _ higher - dimensional tight binding models_.      let us for simplicity consider in @xmath162 dimensions the geometry of slabs @xmath327 , for suitable @xmath11 and @xmath164 .",
    "so along one dimension , we have as before @xmath11 sites , whereas the system size with respect to the other dimensions is @xmath164 , see fig .",

    "we again allow for arbitrary finite - ranged interactions ( the generalization to exponentially decaying interactions is straightforward but omitted ) .",
    "that is to say , for @xmath334 , the hamiltonian tensor takes the form @xmath335 then the hamiltonian can be written in the following way @xmath336 we have singled our the special spatial dimension for which we consider the bi - partite cut .",

    "in this section , we compare our results with predictions from _ conformal field theory_. indeed , our findings can be seen as a confirmation of the predictions resulting from the conformal transformation relating finite systems at zero temperature to infinite systems at finite temperature . in our result",
    ", we provide system specific qualifiers of the asymptotic limits , and our main theorem constitutes a fully rigorous result applicable to a large class of models .",
    "also , higher - dimensional systems on tori can be captured with the methods presented here .",
    "still , it is interesting to see that the behaviour of the mutual information , scaling asymptotically as the logarithm in the inverse temperature , can also immediately be suggested from the analysis of conformal field theories in @xmath350 dimensions .",
    "this is an observation similar to the one made for ground state properties of the xx model in the ground state @xcite : here , the rigorous expression given relates to and confirms the formula @xcite @xmath351 in a connection already conjectured in ref",
    ".  @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath352 is a constant and @xmath28 is the lattice spacing , while @xmath353 is the conformal charge .",
    "the results on entanglement entropies in the xx models were proven using fisher - hartwig type methods for tplitz determinants @xcite .",
    "the main idea in the conformal analysis is that there exists a connection between correlation properties of finite systems at zero temperature and infinite systems at finite temperature .",
    "therefore , assume that at zero temperature , the entanglement entropy scales as @xmath354 for some function @xmath355 .",
    "then , at large inverse temperatures @xmath43 , we consider the conformal mapping @xmath356 for @xmath357 , to arrive at the expression @xcite @xmath358 combined with eq .",
    "( [ conformalentropy1 ] ) , one hence gets for @xmath43 @xcite @xmath359 for @xmath360 . the above statement becomes meaningful in the limit when @xmath361 .",
    "asymptotically , @xmath362 is well approximated by @xmath363 @xcite , but for our purposes , we also need a first order correction , namely @xmath364 in this way , one recovers the expression for the mutual information @xmath365 again exhibiting a logarithmic dependence in @xmath48 , as @xmath366 .",
    "the analysis of the finite temperature case axing arguments from conformal field theory has recently been carried out in refs .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the criticality of the ground state is not felt by the mutual information , unless one is at extremely low temperatures . in turn , the logarithmic scaling in the size of a subregion is turned into a logarithmic dependence on the inverse temperature .",
    "it is important to note that because the formalism developed here allows for the computation of all renyi entropies , the tools developed in this paper also allow for the study spectra of reductions ; i.e. _ entanglement spectra _",
    "@xcite , compare also refs .",
    "such entanglement spectra have turned out to provide a powerful tool when characterizing _ topological order _ , relating bulk to boundary theories , and discussing the possibility of approximating states with suitable _ tensor network states _ such as _ matrix product states and operators _ and higher - dimensional analogues .",
    "let us finally briefly mention that the formalism developed here in principle also allows for the study of _ open quantum systems _",
    ", undergoing dissipation and quantum noise .",
    "an extensive discussion of this topic is beyond the scope of the present article . in the mindset developed here",
    ", one can consider _ liouvillians _ capturing fermionic open quantum systems of the form @xmath367 + \\sum_{j\\in{\\ensuremath{\\mathbbm{z}}}_n } \\left (      l_j \\rho l_j^\\dagger - \\frac{1}{2}\\ {      l_j^\\dagger l_j,\\rho      \\ }      \\right)\\ ] ] with , as before , @xmath368 and the @xmath369 are operators linear in the fermionic operators , supported on finitely many sites only , which are all the same , except that they are all translates of each other .",
    "the lindblad operators @xmath369 hence act locally in the same way as the hamiltonian terms act locally .",
    "the equations of motions then become @xmath370 a state @xmath5 is called a steady state if @xmath371 . for fully translationally invariant systems",
    ", one can again define a symbol @xcite , and the methods developed here are applicable .",
    "details of such an approach will be pursued elsewhere .",
    "such an idea seems particularly timely in the light of the observation that open system dynamics should not only be viewed as a source of quantum noise added to the system .",
    "but that open system dynamics and dissipation can also be beneficial : indeed , dissipative dynamics allows for dissipative instances of quantum information processing @xcite , exhibiting an interesting way of protection . also , steady states can readily exhibit a number of exciting properties : they can be _ entangled _ , show phenomena of _ noise - driven criticality _ , or even exhibit _ topological order _",
    "the latter is specifically true for free fermionic models , an arena for which the machinery developed here should be fruitful .      in this work ,",
    "we have introduced a formalism allowing us to prove the validity of rigorous expressions for the renyi mutual information of gibbs states of translationally invariant quasi - free fermionic models .",
    "the expressions obtained are asymptotically exact ; the bounds given are also exponentially tighter than those derived from the extremality of the gibbs state with respect to the free energy .",
    "special emphasis has been put onto the technical development of novel methods of dealing with tplitz matrices , in particular a new and useful instance of a second order expression for smooth symbols .",
    "these tools , as well as the approximation results introduced here , are expected to be widely applicable and highly useful in various contexts .",

    "in this subsection , we will derive upper and lower bounds to the quantum mutual information , evaluated for gaussian fermionic states .",
    "these bounds are generally useful when bounding mutual information expressions .",
    "moreover , they are additive , so share this important feature with the actual mutual information .",
    "we expect these bounds to be useful also in other contexts , different from the study pursued here . what is more",
    ", it should be clear that one can immediately also formulate a bosonic variant of the bounds presented here , using the same strategy of proof .",
    "we consider covariance matrices @xmath372 of the form @xmath373 with @xmath374 .",
    "we write @xmath375 and denote with @xmath376 the pinching @xcite @xmath377 of @xmath248 .",
    "this is the covariance matrix of the tensor product of the two reduced states , as a moment of thought reveals . in these terms",
    ", the quantum mutual information can hence be written as @xmath378 so as a difference of two trace functions .",
    "let us now consider a quadratic function @xmath379\\rightarrow [ 0,1]$ ] defined as @xmath380 we will see that the corresponding difference of trace functions is a convenient , computable lower bound of the mutual information with reasonable properties .",
    "we hence relate the mutual information to _ purities _ only ( or , for that matter , to @xmath381-renyi mutual informations ) .      to start with",
    ", the additivity immediately follows from the definition .",
    "we have @xmath385 this lower bound as such can be shown using a result of the theory of convex trace functions called peierls inequality @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath386 is a concave function ( it is not required that it is operator concave ) .",
    "what is more , we can without loss of generality assume that @xmath141 and @xmath387 are both diagonal .",
    "if they are not , there exist real orthogonal matrices @xmath388 such that @xmath389 is diagonal , without altering the value of the mutual information or the bound . using the concavity of @xmath390 , we find @xmath391 but since @xmath141 and @xmath387 are diagonal , we have @xmath392 which is what we intended to show .",
    "note the similarity of this bound for the mutual information with the bound presented in ref .",
    "@xcite for the von - neumann entropy .",
    "it is quite remarkable that this bound can even be used for differences of entropies , not only of entropies as such .",
    "we now turn to upper bounds .",
    "let us define the function @xmath393\\rightarrow [ 0,1]$ ] as @xmath394 again , one can prove that the upper bound derived from this matrix function , @xmath395 shares the above additivity property .",
    "again , one can prove in the same way as above that one encounters an upper bound .",
    "of course , the function @xmath396 is no longer concave , but convex , so @xmath397 is concave .",
    "this bound is not a quadratic bound any more . using again peierls inequality , one arrives at the following result .                in this subsection",
    ", we elaborate on second order theorems for convex functions of self - adjoint tplitz operators .",
    "it builds upon the analysis of the main text , but is not directly required in any of the above proofs . for the main statement of this subsection , we will need peierls inequality in the following form .",
    "let @xmath401 be a hermitian @xmath402 matrix and let @xmath224 be a unitary @xmath402 matrix .",
    "then , for any function @xmath108 that is convex on some open interval @xmath403 with @xmath404 , one finds that @xmath405      [ th : szegoselfadjoint ] let @xmath229 be a symbol .",
    "assume further that @xmath406 ( or equivalently assume that @xmath407 ) .",
    "then the associated family of tplitz matrices , @xmath230 is hermitian .",
    "let @xmath408 be an open interval with @xmath409 and let @xmath410 be real- analytic .",
    "then there exists an analytic extension @xmath411 of @xmath158 to a small complex neighborhood of @xmath412 of @xmath413 with @xmath414 ( compare lemma  [ theo : analyticerror ] ) and the trace formula of theorem  [ th : szego ] holds true for this extension .",
    "moreover if @xmath158 is convex , then @xmath415    the only non - obvious statement is @xmath415 fix @xmath279 and @xmath225 large enough such that @xmath416 with @xmath417 for every @xmath226 . since @xmath219 is hermitian we have @xmath418",
    "choose unitary matrices @xmath224 that diagonalize @xmath419 .",
    "then @xmath420 hence , by peierl s inequality : @xmath421 therefore : @xmath422 since @xmath279 was arbitrary this implies @xmath423    since obviously @xmath424 and @xmath425 for @xmath426 this implies that @xmath427 whenever @xmath428 is convex .",
    "if both @xmath429 and @xmath430 are differentiable twice this holds true if and only if @xmath431 .",
    "we start with proving the part of the theorem relating to the high temperature dependence , eq .",
    "( [ eq : hightemplimit ] ) ) . for that purpose",
    ", we formulate the explicit asymptotic expression for the mutual information of a thermal state of the fermionic instance of the xx model .",
    "define @xmath432 then @xmath433 the symbol takes the form @xmath434 .",
    "in these terms , we can express the mutual information as @xmath435 where we have decomposed the integrand into the functions @xmath436 the high temperature ( small @xmath48 ) limit can be calculated simply by expanding the functions in the integrand , to leading non - zero order in @xmath48 , which yields @xmath437 now , noting that @xmath438 we find that @xmath439    the second part of the theorem , relating to the low temperature asymptotics ( i.e. , the asymptotics for large @xmath48 ) , turns out to be significantly more involved . in a first step , we will cast the integral into a more appropriate form . by an elementary argument involving the symmetry of the problem",
    ", one finds that @xmath440 where @xmath441 and @xmath442 in this expression , we have made use of the same notation as in the above proof of the low temperature behavior .",
    "note that both @xmath268 functions are monotonous functions of there argument in both regions of integration .",
    "the substitution @xmath443 and an appropriate rearrangement of factors then gives @xmath444 where @xmath445 in this equation , we have defined @xmath446 an analogous computation for @xmath447 yields : @xmath448 we need the following elementary but powerful lemma .          by the mean value theorem there exists some @xmath453 with @xmath460 such that @xmath461 hence @xmath462 where the last inequality follows from @xmath463 . by the same argument",
