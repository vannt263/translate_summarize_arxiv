    "the conversion of atomic to molecular gas is also crucial for formation of other important molecular tracers and coolants such as co , oh , and h@xmath0o ( e.g. ,   * ? ? ?",
    "understanding the transition is important for star - formation and galaxy evolution theories , and for interpreting observations of the ism .",
    "h@xmath0 molecules are photodissociated by far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) radiation within the lyman - werner ( lw ) band ( 11.2 - 13.6 ev ) .",
    "this occurs via a two - step process , in which a lw photon excites an electronic state , which in @xmath1 of the cases decays to rovibrational continuum that leads to dissociation of the h@xmath0 molecule . with increasing column density ,",
    "the fuv radiation is absorbed , and the h@xmath0 dissociation rate decreases .",
    "once the column density is large enough so that the local h@xmath0 dissociation rate becomes equal to the h@xmath0 formation rate , an transition occurs .    what are the properties of transitions in molecular clouds , and what are the properties of the ( predominantly ) shielding columns ?",
    "the perseus cloud is located at a distance of @xmath2  pc , with an angular extent of @xmath3 , and a total mass of @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "perseus consists of several dark and star - forming regions , which form low and intermediate mass stars ( later than b1 ) .",
    "thus the fuv radiation in perseus is probably dominated by external sources ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter l12 ) .",
    "l12 used 21 cm observations of the galfa survey @xcite , together with iris infrared data @xcite and the @xmath5 image from the complete survey @xcite , to derive and surface densities ( and @xmath6 ) towards b1 , b1e , b5 , ic348 , and ngc1333 , with a resolution of 0.4 pc .",
    "we use the data presented by @xcite , for which the columns were corrected for ( up to 20 % ) 21 cm depth effects .",
    "we apply the s14 theoretical model which assumes semi - infinite gas slabs irradiated by external fuv .",

    "assuming h@xmath0 formation on dust grains @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the fuv intensity in units of the @xcite field , @xmath15 is the volume density and @xmath16 is the fraction of lw photons that are absorbed in h@xmath0-dust ( see s14 ) . for multiphased gas ,",
    "the cnm density and @xmath14 are proportional @xcite . in this case",
    "@xmath17 . in our analysis",
    "however , we do not assume _ a priori _ cnm conditions ( as e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but rather constrain @xmath8 directly using the observational data .",

    "the grey strip is the @xmath19 typical range , and the two dashed horizontal lines are the typical @xmath20 and twice typical ( 3.8 ) values .",
    "the @xmath8 values for this range and the corresponding densities ( assuming @xmath21 ) are indicated.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    in fig .  1 ( a ) we test our theoretical prediction that @xmath22 is independent of @xmath18 by fitting @xmath23 , for each of the five regions",
    ". the theory and observations are in excellent agreement . in fig .  1 ( b ) we plot the columns as contours in the @xmath8  @xmath9 parameter space , using equation ( [ eq : sigma_hi ] ) .",
    "l12 obtained an elevated @xmath24 ratio in perseus , so @xmath9 probably lies within 1.9 to 3.8 ( dashed lines ) . for this realistic range in @xmath9 , @xmath8 spans from @xmath25 to @xmath26 , a factor of 2 - 7 larger than @xmath19 ( grey strip ) .",
    "therefore pure cnm shielding can not explain the observed columns in perseus .",

    "@xmath22 is effectively smaller , reducing the inferred @xmath8 and increasing @xmath15 .",
