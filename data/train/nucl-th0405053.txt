    "in previous papers @xcite , we have proposed a schematic model aimed at the description of the non - perturbative regime of qcd .",
    "the main concepts about the model can be found in @xcite , together with the applications to the meson spectrum of qcd . along this line ,",
    "@xcite deals with the appearance of phase transitions and condensates . a preliminary set of results , about the energy and parity of systems of the type @xmath1 ( pentaquarks ) , and @xmath2 ( heptaquarks ) , was presented in @xcite .    as it was discussed in @xcite ,",
    "this model describes reasonable well the main features of the meson spectrum of qcd .",
    "this is a nice result since it shows that , also in the conditions of low energy qcd , e.g. ; large coupling constants and non - conservation of particle number , the use of simple models may be very useful .",
    "the model of @xcite belongs to the class of models @xcite which may be solved by algebraic , group theory and symmetry - enforcing techniques , and that describe the interaction between fermions and bosons .",
    "some examples of this class of models can be found in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . concerning the use of symmetry principles ,",
    "the work of @xcite shows how the ordering of levels of many gluon states may be understood . in @xcite ,",
    "the predictive power of the model , based on the microscopical treatment of gluons configurations , was tested by means of the spectrum related to exotic quantum numbers .",
    "the purpose of this work is to extend the model of ref .",
    "@xcite to describe the main structure of the hadronic spectrum of qcd .",
    "the essentials of the model are the following :    a)color , flavor and spin degrees of freedom are taken explicitly into account to built the configurations , both in the quark and gluon sectors of the model ;    b)the quarks and antiquarks are placed in a s - state ;    c)the interaction of the quarks with the gluons proceeds via gluon pairs coupled to spin and color zero , only .",
    "other possible gluon states are considered as spectators .",
    "the present work is organized as follows .",
    "section [ s2 ] gives a brief description of the model .",
    "we shall avoid as much as possible the repetition of details which can be found in the already published papers @xcite , and concentrate in the aspects which are relevant for the description of the hadronic spectrum . in section [ s3 ]",
    "we discuss the classification of many quark - antiquark states , and the classification of many gluon states @xcite . in section [ s4 ]",
    "we show and discuss the hadronic spectrum predicted by the model , as a natural continuation of the study presented in @xcite , where the meson sector was analyzed .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section [ s5 ] .",
    "the basic degrees of freedom of the model are illustrated in the level scheme shown in figure 1 .",
    "the quarks occupy two levels , one at negative and the other at positive energy .",
    "antiquarks are depicted as holes in the lower level .",
    "if with @xmath3 and @xmath4 we denote the creation and annihilation operators of quarks , in the upper ( @xmath5 ) and lower ( @xmath6 ) level , the relation to quark ( antiquark ) creation and annihilation operators is given by @xmath7 where the index @xmath8 refers to color , flavor and spin quantum numbers . since three degrees of color , three degrees of flavor ( only u , d and s quarks are taken into account ) and two degrees of spin are considered , each level is 18-fold degenerate .",
    "the energy of each level is approximated to one third of the nucleon mass and it represents a constituent ( effective ) mass of the quarks . in this picture",
    ", the mass comes mainly from the kinetic energy because quarks are confined to a sphere of radius 1fm .",
    "the model describes quarks and antiquarks distributed in an orbital s - level .",
    "orbital excitations can also be accounted for by increasing the number of degrees of freedom",
    ".    0.5 cm    to this system of quarks we add a boson level , which represents pairs of gluons of color and spin zero . its position is fixed as it was done in ref .",
    "the coupling between quarks and antiquarks and gluons proceeds via this gluon - pair configurations .",
    "other couplings to different pairs of gluons are neglected , because their contributions , at least for the meson spectrum , were found to be negligible @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , gluons of other types are still present in the model but they are considered as spectators .",
    "the basic excitations in the fermion sector are @xmath9 pairs , which are described by @xmath10 and @xmath11 pair operators @xcite , where @xmath12=0,1 stands for flavor states ( 0,0 ) and ( 1,1 ) , and the spin @xmath13 can be 0 or 1 . these pair of fermions , a sub - class of bi - fermion operators @xcite , can be mapped onto a boson space @xcite . we denote the corresponding operators by @xmath14 .",
    "this is the basic structure of the model presented previously @xcite . in order to extend it to the description of baryons , and because we work in the boson space of quark - antiquark pairs , one should add three valence quarks via the operators @xmath15^{(\\lambda , \\mu       ) } _ { f , m}$ ] , where two _ ideal _ quark operators @xmath16 @xcite are coupled as a di - quark @xmath17 = @xmath18^{(\\lambda_0,\\mu_0)s_0}_{f_0 m_0}$ ] with flavor , spin @xmath19 either ( 0,1)0 or ( 2,0)1 .",
    "the interaction describes scattering and vacuum fluctuation terms of fermion and gluon pairs .",
    "the strength @xmath28 is the same for each allowed value of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , due to symmetry reasons , as shown in @xcite .",
    "these parameters were determined in @xcite and they are taken as fixed values in the present calculations .",
    "the matrix elements of the meson part of the hamiltonian are calculated in a seniority basis . for details",
    ", please see ref .",
    "the operators @xmath29 are number operators of the di - quarks coupled to flavor - spin @xmath19 .",
    "the interaction does not contain terms which connect states with different hypercharge and isospin . it does not contain flavor mixing terms , either .",
    "therefore , in the comparison with data , the energies should be corrected by the mass formula given in ref .",
    "@xcite , with parameters deduced as in @xcite and turning off flavor mixing terms .",
    "the procedure is explained in details in @xcite .",
    "the parameters @xmath30 are adjusted to the nucleon resonances , while the parameters @xmath31 are adjusted to the @xmath0 resonances .",
    "the two last terms in ( [ hamiltonian ] ) are needed to describe the interaction between the valence quarks and the meson - like states .",
    "the parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 were fixed at 0.33 gev and 1.6 gev , respectively .",
    "the parameters @xmath28 were adjusted to the mesonic spectrum and their values are : @xmath34=0.0337 gev , @xmath35=0.0422 gev , @xmath36=0.1573 gev and @xmath37=0.0177 gev , respectively .",
    "this shows the strong effects of the @xmath36 interaction , which acts on pairs coupled to flavor ( 1,1 ) and spin 0 ( pion - like states ) .",
    "the parameters @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( k=1,2 ) are adjusted to the nucleon resonances and @xmath0 resonances respectively .",
    "their values are @xmath38 - 1.442 gev , @xmath39=-0.439 gev , @xmath40=-1.187 gev and @xmath41=-0.362 gev .",
    "to obtain the values of @xmath60 one has to consider all possible partitions of @xmath70 . for colorless states we have @xmath71 .",
    "each partition of @xmath47 appears only once .",
    "the irrep @xmath72 $ ] of @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) fixes the irrep of @xmath54 , as indicated in ( [ group1 ] ) . for @xmath45 and",

    "as an example , in table [ table1 ] we list the partial @xmath77 content for meson states of the @xmath54 irrep @xmath75 $ ] and in table [ table2 ] the partial content of the @xmath63 irreps listed in table [ table1 ] .",
    "the irreps which are shown contain up to two quark - antiquarks pairs , only .",
    "the @xmath63 irreps have in general four rows while the @xmath78 of the flavor group have three rows @xmath79 $ ] . the adopted notation for flavor",
    "is @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "the minimal number of quarks in an @xmath63 irrep is given by the sum of the two last rows of the @xmath63 young diagram while the number of antiquarks is given by the difference between @xmath83 and the sum of the two first rows of the @xmath63 young diagram .",
    "in the spin representation for quarks ( @xmath84 $ ] ) , the sum @xmath85 gives the number of quarks and @xmath86 is the spin carried by the quarks .",
    "similarly , for antiquarks(@xmath87 $ ] ) @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "this is related to the fact that the unperturbed ground state , of the two level model space , contains 18 quarks , as it was defined before .",
    "the total spin @xmath13 of the system can be obtained via the condition @xmath90 . in tables",

[ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the simplest form to obtain a @xmath0 resonance is to couple a diquarks with ( 3,0)@xmath94 with the meson part to ( 3,0)@xmath95 , where in general more than one @xmath95 is allowed , depending on the meson state .",
    "coupling @xmath96 with @xmath97 leads to the @xmath98 resonance .",
    "the quark - antiquark and gluon content of the @xmath98 is somewhat lower than that of the nucleon .",
    "the theoretical state at 1.57 gev can be compared in structure to the roper resonance in the nucleon resonances .",
    "the first negative parity state with flavor ( 3,0 ) and spin @xmath94 ( there are other states in the table , also with flavor ( 3,0 ) but spin @xmath99 ) is at the theoretical energy 1.79 gev and it contains nearly one @xmath100 pair with flavor - spin @xmath101 .    to conclude with this section , we show in figure [ fig2 ] a compilation of the results commented upon previously .",

    "we have extended the schematic model of @xcite to the description of meson states , nucleon resonances and @xmath0 resonances .",
    "the schematic model does not conserve the number of quarks , antiquarks and gluons , rather an average number of them can be extracted from the calculations .",
    "it reflects the fact that the interaction is strong and the particle number is not conserved .",
    "it is found that the nucleon has nearly 50@xmath105 of gluon content , as expected .",
    "the degeneracy of states of the type @xmath106 is remove ( see @xcite ) , but there is still a degeneracy related to the seniority .",
    "the hilbert space is divided into subspaces with a given seniority of the different @xmath100 pairs involved .",
    "spaces with the same distribution of seniority but different flavor and spin are degenerate .",
    "this lead to the prediction of unusual flavor - spin combinations which can not be obtained by one @xmath100 pair or three quarks alone .",
    "we gave a complete classification for the quarks , antiquarks and gluons states .",
    "the quarks interact with pairs of gluons coupled to spin zero .",
    "other types of gluons are present as spectators @xcite the global agreement with data is reasonable and the model gives an insight on the detailed structure of the states .",
    "the lowest pentaquarks state is predicted at 1.51 gev @xcite .",
    "it has an unusual combination of flavor @xmath107 and @xmath108 , and it has negative parity . also heptaquarks states are predicted , with positive parity at an energy of about 2.5 gev , for the lowest lying state .",
    "the same was done for @xmath0 resonances .",
    "these are features which can not be obtained by working alone with three quarks or with one quark - antiquark pair .",
    "we think that the present results support the notion that the degrees of freedom included in the model may indeed be the relevant ones to describe the low - energy spectrum of qcd , within the limitations posed by the schematic nature of the proposed hamiltonian .",
