    "the detection of the double neutron star ( ns  ns ) prototype psr  b1913 + 16 as a binary pulsar ( hulse & taylor 1975 ) and its orbital decay due to emission of gravitational waves have inspired a number of quantitative estimates of the coalescence rate , @xmath5 , of ns ",

    "we present a newly developed statistical analysis that allows the calculation of statistical confidence levels associated with rate estimates .",

    "we derive the probability distribution function of the total galactic coalescence rate weighted by the two observed binary systems .",
    "the method involves the simulation of selection effects inherent in all relevant radio pulsar surveys and a bayesian statistical analysis for the probability distribution of @xmath6 . the small - number bias and the effect of the faint - end of the luminosity function , previously identified as the main sources of uncertainty in rate estimates ( kalogera et al .",

    "in the second part of this paper , we modify our statistical method in a way that allows us to calculate the probability distribution for the number of pulsars that could be detected by the parkes multibeam survey ( hereafter pmb survey ; lyne et al .  2000 ;",

    "we discuss in a some detail the the doppler smearing effect which is significant for recent surveys with relatively long exposures . for binary pulsars , we need to take account of the reduction in signal - to - noise ratio due to the doppler shift in period during an observation . for observations of ns ",
    "ns binaries , where the orbital periods are of the order of 10 hours or less , the apparent pulse period can change significantly during a search observation causing the received power to be spread over a number of frequency bins in the fourier domain . as all the surveys considered in this analysis search for periodicities in the amplitude spectrum of the fourier transform of the time series , a signal spread over several bins can result in a loss of signal - to - noise ratio @xmath9 . to take account of this effect in our survey simulations , we need to multiply the apparent flux density of each model pulsar by a `` degradation factor '' , @xmath10 .",
    "significant degradation occurs , when @xmath11 .",
    "using an analysis method described in camilo et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , we calculate the degradation factor for the two pulsars we consider in this work .",
    "as expected , we find that surveys with the longest integration times are most affected by doppler smearing .",
    "for the pmb survey , which has an integration time of 35 min , mean values of @xmath12 are 0.7 and 0.3 for psr  b1913 + 16 and psr  b1534 + 12 respectively . the greater degradation for psr  b1534 + 12 is due to its mildly eccentric orbit ( @xmath13 versus 0.6 for psr  b1913 + 16 ) which results in a much more persistent change in apparent pulse period when averaged over the entire orbit . in order to improve on the sensitivity to binary pulsars",
    ", the pmb survey data are now being reprocessed using various algorithms designed to account for binary motion during the integration time ( faulkner et al . ;",
    "these proceedings ) . for the jodrell bank and swinburne surveys ( nicastro et al .  1995 ; edwards et al .",
    "2001 ) , which both have integration times of order 5 min , we find @xmath14 for both systems . for all other surveys , which have significantly shorter integration times , no significant degradation is seen , and we take @xmath15 .",
    "as already mentioned , we generate large numbers of `` observed '' pulsar samples by modeling the survey selection effects and applying them to model populations of psr  b1913 + 16like and psr  b1534 + 12like pulsars , separately . for a fixed value of @xmath16 , we use these `` observed '' samples to calculate their distribution , which we find to be very well described by a poisson distribution : @xmath17 where @xmath18 . with our monte carlo simulations we calculate @xmath19 and find it to linearly correlate with @xmath20 ( for values in the range @xmath21 ) : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a constant that depends on the properties ( space and luminosity distributions and pulse period and width ) of the galactic pulsar population .    for a given @xmath7 , we calculate the rate using estimates of the associated pulsar beaming correction factor @xmath24 and lifetime @xmath25 : @xmath26 .",

    "the lower ( @xmath36 ) and upper ( @xmath37 ) limits to these ranges are determined by the following conditions : @xmath38    finally , we can calculate the detection rate for ligo , @xmath39 , defined by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the scaling factor ( based on the blue luminosity density of the nearby universe ) derived to be @xmath42mpc@xmath43 ( for details see kalogera et al .",
    "@xmath44 is the detection volume defined as a sphere with a radius equals to the maximum detection distance d@xmath45 for the initial ( @xmath46mpc ) and advanced ligo ( @xmath47mpc ; finn 2001 ) .",
    "we have chosen one of our pulsar population models to be our _ reference _ model based on the results presented by cordes & chernoff ( 1997 ) .",
    "for this model , we find the most likely value of @xmath7 , to be @xmath48 pulsars for the `` psr  b1913 + 16-like '' population , and @xmath47 pulsars for the `` psr  b1534 + 12-like '' population .",
    "using eq .",
    "( 45 ) , we evaluate the total galactic coalescence rate of ns ",
    "ns binaries for this reference case .",
    "the most likely value of the coalescence rate is @xmath49@xmath50myr@xmath1 and the ranges at different statistical confidence levels are : @xmath51  myr@xmath1 at 68% , @xmath52myr@xmath1 at 95% , and @xmath53  myr@xmath1 at 99% .",
    "also , the most likely values of detection rates , which correspond to @xmath49 are @xmath54yr@xmath1 and @xmath55yr@xmath1 , for the initial and advanced ligo .    to 8.0 cm    in fig .  1",
    ", @xmath56 along with @xmath57 and @xmath58 are shown for the reference model .",
    "it is evident that the total rate distribution is dominated by that of psr  b1913 + 16 .",
    "this is due to the fact that we calculate the two rate contributions having relaxed the constraint that pulsars have luminosities equal to that of the observed pulsar , and instead allowing for the full range in luminosity . in this case",
    "any differences in the two separate rate contributions depend _ only _ on differences in pulse periods , and widths . given that the latter are rather small",
    ", it makes sense that , for example , the most likely values of @xmath7 for the two pulsars come out to be very similar ( e.g. @xmath48 and @xmath47 , for psr  b1913 + 16 and psr  b1534 + 12 , respectively , in the reference model ) .",
    "consequently any difference in the rate contributions from the two populations is due to the difference in lifetimes ( about a factor of 10 ) for the two observed pulsars ( note that the two do not only have similar @xmath7 estimates , but also similar beaming correction factors ) . since the lifetime estimate for psr  b1913 +",
    "16 is much smaller , the total rate distribution is dominated by its contribution .    to 6.cm",
    "we have found that there are strong correlations between the peak value of the total galactic coalescence rate , @xmath59 , and the cut - off luminosity , @xmath60 , and its power index , @xmath61 . as seen in the fig .  2 , @xmath59 increases rapidly with decreasing @xmath60 ( left panel ) or with increasing p ( right panel ) .",
    "the peak rate does not show any strong dependence on scale lengths of the spatial distribution ( either @xmath62 or @xmath63 ) , except for rather extreme cases ( e.g. @xmath64 kpc).hence , the most important model parameter seems to be the slope and low - end cut - off of the luminosity function .",
    "we find that the most likely values for the rates are in the range @xmath65 3 - 22myr@xmath1 for all models with luminosity - function parameters consistent with pulsar observations at 68% confidence level ( cordes & chernoff 1997 ) .",
    "as mentioned in  2.1 , because of the long integration time , the signal - to - noise ratio for the pmb survey is severely reduced by doppler smearing due to the pulsars orbital motion .",
    "acceleration searches in the reanalysis by faulkner et al .",
    "( these proceedings ) promise to alleviate this reduction in the near future . here",
    "we calculate the probability distribution of the number of pulsars @xmath8 that could be detected with the pmb survey , assuming that the reduction in flux due to doppler smearing is corrected perfectly . using this distribution p(@xmath66 ) , we calculate the average value of @xmath8 , @xmath67 , for the pmb survey .",
    "we first calculate @xmath8 ( detected by pmb survey ) for a range of total number of pulsars in our model galaxy and determine the slope , @xmath68 using eq .",
    "( 2)(3.1 ) .",
    "we then use @xmath69 ( in practice @xmath70 ) derived in  3 , to calculate @xmath71 , for each type of pulsar : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is given in eq .",
    "( 1 ) . defining @xmath74 ,",
    "p(@xmath75 ) can be derived from p(@xmath7 ) : @xmath76 since @xmath23 s are different for each type of pulsar , @xmath77 is determined for each pulsar , separately .",
    "the normalized probability distribution of @xmath8 for each type of pulsar , p(@xmath8 ) , is then calculated as : @xmath78    once we have p(@xmath8)@xmath79 and p(n@xmath80)@xmath81 , we can calculate the combined @xmath82 .",
    "we define @xmath83 and @xmath84 , where all variables are integers .",
    "the joint probability distribution function for observing either psr  b1913 + 16-like or psr  b1534 + 12-like pulsar , p(@xmath85,@xmath86 ) is given by : @xmath87^{2 } } { \\frac { ( { { n_{\\rm + } } + { n_{\\rm -}}}+2 ) ( { { n_{\\rm + } } - { n_{\\rm -}}}+2 ) } { ( { 1+{\\beta_{\\rm 1}}})^{({{n_{\\rm + } } + { n_{\\rm -}}})/2 } ( { 1+{\\beta_{\\rm 2}})^{({{n_{\\rm + } } - { n_{\\rm -}}})/2 } } } } .\\ ] ] finally , we calculate @xmath88 by the summation of p(@xmath89,@xmath86 ) over @xmath90 .",
    "@xmath91 where @xmath90 lies in the range [ @xmath92,@xmath93 with an increment of 2 .",
    "to 6.5 cm    in fig .  3 , we show the distribution function p(@xmath85 ) that could be detected by the pmb survey for our reference pulsar population model .",
    "we have calculated the distributions and average predicted values , for other models with different cut - off luminosity @xmath60 and the power index of the luminosity function , @xmath61 ( kkl ) .",
    "for 7 different models with luminosity - function parameters within a 68% confidence level ( cordes & chernoff 1997 ) , we find values of @xmath94 in the range 1.351.5 ( 1.4 for our reference model ) .",
    "we conclude that , if orbital motion does not affect the signal - to - noise ratio , then the pmb survey could be expected to detect 1 - 2 new binary pulsars with pulse profile and orbital properties similar to either psr b1913 + 16 or psr b1534 + 12 in the pmb survey .",
    "we have recently developed a new method for estimating the total number of pulsars in our galaxy and have applied it to the calculation of the coalescence rate of double neutron star systems in the galactic field ( for more details see kkl ) . here , we extend this method to obtain a prediction for the average number of observed pulsars that the pmb survey could detect when acceleration searches are used to correct for the doppler smearing due to orbital motions .",
    "the modeling of pulsar survey selection effects is formulated in a `` forward '' way , by populating the galaxy with model pulsar populations and calculating the likelihood of the real observed sample .",
    "this is in contrast to the `` inverse '' way of the calculation of scale factors used in previous studies .",
    "we note that this method could be further extended to account for distributions of pulsar populations in pulse periods , widths , and orbital periods .",
    "it is important to note that both our rate estimates and the predictions for detections from the pmb survey do not apply to binary pulsars that are significantly different from with such properties that are significantly different psrs  b1913 + 16 and b1534 + 12 in terms of pulse shapes and orbital properties .",
    "most importantly the method can be applied to any type of pulsar population with appropriate modifications of the modeling of survey selection effects .",
    "currently we are working on assessing the contribution of double neutron stars formed in globular clusters as well as the formation rate of binary pulsars with white dwarf companions that are important for gravitational - wave detection by lisa , the space - based interferometer planned by nasa and esa for the end of this decade .",
