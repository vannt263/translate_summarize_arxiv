    "this analysis suggests the existence of gregory - laflamme instability at late time . on the other hand , since the direction of an extra dimension is shrinking , we can also expect that the spacetime will be stabilized at late time since the compactified extra dimension @xmath16 prohibits long wave length modes of perturbation . by considering the time evolution as a sequence of static spacetime , we have obtained a suggestion that the spacetime will be stabilized at late time .",
