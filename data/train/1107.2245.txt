    "bose - einstein condensates , which are ensemble of atoms in a single quantum state with long coherence time , offers the possibility to study quantum optics in a completely new regime .",
    "the high degree of spatial and temporal coherence of a condensate can alter the interactions between atoms and light .",
    "in particular , superradiant rayleigh scattering and matter - wave amplification caused by coherent center - of - mass motion of atoms in a condensate illuminated by a highly detuned laser were observed @xcite .",
    "the matter - wave grating is formed as a result of the coherent superposition of different atomic states , similar to the one produced in bragg scattering experiment in which the condensate atoms are diffracted by a standing light wave @xcite .",
    "the superradiant rayleigh scattering from a bec is the quantum analog of the collective atomic recoil laser ( carl ) @xcite . due to",
    "the absence of doppler broadening in bec , the atoms scatter a single laser photon and recoil with an extra momentum of @xmath0 in the direction of the incident photon ( @xmath1 is the wave - vector of the incident photon ) .",
    "the amplitude of the matter - wave grating and the number of scattered photons are exponentially enhanced via the carl instability @xcite . from the theoretical side , the semiclassical model of carl",
    "was extended to include the quantum mechanical description of the center - of - mass motion of the atoms in a bec @xcite .",
    "the influence of atomic motion on the superradiant light acattering from a moving bec was investigated theoretically and experimentally @xcite . in an optical cavity due to the multiple reflections of the pump laser from the cavity mirrors ,",
    "the interaction time of the light fields with the atoms can be enhanced by several orders of magnitude , which supports the amplification of the superradiant scattering process @xcite .",
    "recently the field of cavity optomechanics has become an attractive research topic with a wide variety of systems ranging from gravitational wave detectors @xcite , nanomechanical cantilevers @xcite , vibrating microtoroids@xcite , membranes@xcite and bose - einstein condensate @xcite .",
    "a cavity opto - mechanical system , generally consists of an optical cavity with one movable end mirror .",
    "such a system is utilized to cool a micromechanical resonator to its ground state by the pressure exerted by the cavity light field on the movable mirror .",
    "the studies on cavity opto - mechanics of atoms show that sufficiently strong and coherent coupling would enable studies of atom - oscillator entanglement , quantum state transfer , and quantum control of mechanical force sensors . due to coupling between the condensate wavefunction and the cantilever , mediated by the cavity photons ,",
    "the cantilever displacement is expected to strongly influence the superfluid properties of the condensate @xcite .",
    "recently , coupled dynamics of a movable mirror and atoms trapped in the standing wave light field of a cavity were studied @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the dipole potential in which the atoms move is modified due to the back - action of the atoms and that the position of the atoms can become bistable . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the effects of a movable cavity mirror on the superradiant light scattering from a bec in the quantum superradiant regime .",
    "the system under consideration consists of noninteracting ultracold atoms interacting with two counterpropagating modes of an optical cavity . a particular system that we could consider is an elongated cigar shaped cloud of @xmath2 two - level @xmath3 atoms with mass @xmath4 and frequency @xmath5 of the @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 transition .",
    "an external laser pump of frequency @xmath9 and amplitude @xmath10 is incident from one side mirror of the cavity as shown in fig.1 and couples to the cavity field and drives the system .",
    "the induced resonance frequency shift of the cavity is assumed to be smaller than the longitudinal mode spacing , so that we restrict our model to a single longitudinal mode .",
    "an elongated cloud is created by keeping the frequency of the harmonic trap along the transverse direction larger than the frequency along the axial direction .",
    "the cavity mode is also coupled to a mechanical oscillator ( one of the cavity mirror is allowed to move ) with mechanical frequency @xmath11 . the strength of coupling between the cavity mode and the mechanical oscillator is @xmath12 .",
    "the detuning of the pump laser frequency @xmath9 and the cavity mode frequency @xmath13 from the atomic transition frequency @xmath5 is assumed to be so large that the internal dynamics is continuously at a steady state . keeping the population of the excited state at a negligible level . in this case",
    "then one can safely ignore spontaneous emission as well as two body dipole - dipole interactions .",
    "however , we still allow for two - photon virtual transitions in which the atomic internal states do not change , but due to recoil , the atom s center - of - mass motion will change . an atom which absorbs a photon from one mode and emits a photon into the counter propagating mode experiences a recoil kick equal to the difference of the momenta of the two photons ( of the order of two optical momenta ) .",
    "the two photon transitions couple different states of the atomic center - of - mass motion .",
    "the system described above can be modeled by the second quantized hamiltonian    @xmath14    where , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 give the free evolution of the atomic field , light field and the mechanical modes . @xmath18 and @xmath19 describe the dipole coupling between the light field and the atomic field and the mechanical mode respectively .",
    "@xmath20 is the pump field driving the system .",
    "the free one dimensional atomic hamiltonian is given by    @xmath21    where @xmath4 is the atomic mass , @xmath5 is the atomic resonance frequency , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the atomic field operators for the excited and ground state atoms respectively .",
    "the atomic field operators satisfy the bosonic equal time commutation relations @xmath24=\\delta_{j , j'},\\delta(z , z')$ ] , and @xmath25=[\\psi_{j}^{\\dagger}(z),\\psi_{j'}^{\\dagger}(z')]=0 $ ] , where @xmath26",
    ". the free evolution of the cavity mode is governed by the hamiltonian    @xmath27    where @xmath13 is the cavity frequency and @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the cavity photon annihilation and creation operators respectively .",
    "the free evolution of the mechanical mode is given by the hamiltonian    @xmath30    where @xmath11 is the frequency of the mechanical mode and @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the annihilation and creation operator for a mechanical mode respectively .",
    "the pump mode is governed by the hamiltonian    @xmath33    where @xmath10 is the strength of the pump field .",
    "the atomic fields and the counter propagating cavity light fields interact in the dipole approximation via the hamiltonian    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is the atom - light coupling constant . here",
    "@xmath36 is the wavenumber of the cavity light mode .",
    "the counter - propagating cavity light modes are along the @xmath37 axis .",
    "finally the hamiltonian describing the coupling between the cavity photons and the mechanical mode is written as    @xmath38    the input pump laser populates the intracavity mode which couples to the moving mirror through the radiation pressure and the atoms through the dipole interaction .    since the detuning @xmath39 is large , spontaneous emission is negligible and we can adiabatically eliminate the excited state , using the heisenberg equation of motion @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "this yields the heisenberg equation of motion for the ground state field operator @xmath23 , the photon annihilation operator @xmath28 , the position of the mechanical operator @xmath41 and the momentum of the mechanical oscillator @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath43    @xmath44    @xmath45    @xmath46    where @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 . in eqn.[8 ] the second term on the right side of the equality is the self consistent optical grating whose amplitude depends on time according to eqn . [ 9 ] . in eqn .",
    "[ 9 ] , the fourth term on the right side of equality is the self consistent matter wave grating and the fifth term is the radiation pressure coupling of the cavity mode with the mirror displacement .",
    "the system we are considering is intrinsically open as the cavity field is damped by the photon leakage .",
    "this cavity photon decay rate is @xmath50 and @xmath51 is the dissipation rate of the mechanical mode .",
    "if the condensate is much longer than the radiation wavelength and the density is uniform , then periodic boundary condition can be assumed and the ground state wavefunction @xmath23 can be written as    @xmath52    where @xmath53 are the momentum eigensfunctions with eigenvalues @xmath54 .",
    "this description of the atomic motion is equivalent to the assumption that the atoms in a bec are delocalized inside the condensate and the momentum uncertainity is negligibly small . using eqn.[12 ] ,",
    "eqn.[8 ] and eqn.[9 ] reduce to the following set of ordinary differential equations ,    @xmath55a'+\\eta-\\frac{i2g^{2}n}{\\delta}a'-\\frac{i2g^{2}n}{\\delta}a'[c_{n}c_{n+1}^{*}+c_{n}^{*}c_{n-1}]-\\kappa a',\\ ] ]    @xmath56,\\ ] ]    @xmath57,\\ ] ]    @xmath58,\\ ] ]    where @xmath59 and we are assuming that only three momentum levels involved in the process are the initial level @xmath60 , final levels @xmath61 and @xmath62 . the levels @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the momentum side modes to the initial level @xmath60 , generated by the two - photon transitions . we have introduced rescaled photon operators @xmath63 . in eqn.(13 ) , the first term on the right hand side is the renormalized cavity detuning .",
    "the cavity detuning is now changing with time due to @xmath64.we note that when @xmath65 ( stationary cavity ) , @xmath66 is the bragg condition of the scattering process , arising from energy and momentum conservation .",
    "we also note from eqn.(13 ) that the mirror motion term has a dynamical dispersive effect on the bragg resonances , proportional to the mirror displacement @xmath67 . in the linear regime , when @xmath28 is still small and @xmath68 ( some initial constant value ) , the bragg condition is @xmath69 , which is just a shift of the bragg resonance .",
    "defining coherences , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , the population differences @xmath73 and @xmath74 , we have the following additional equations of motion .",

    "are the decoherence rates due to doppler broadening , inhomogeneous effects and phase diffusion .",
    "the phase diffusion mechanism depends on the frequency detuning between the incident and scattered radiation beams and on the initial momentum of the condensate @xmath84 .",
    "[ 13]-[22 ] , are then formally equivalent to the well known maxwell - bloch equations for a @xmath85-level system .     in the classical superradiant regime .",

    "before we proceed ahead with our analysis of the above equations , we identify two regimes of interest . in the quantum superradiant regime @xmath97 , and each atom scatters only a single photon coherently and the condensate momentum changes by @xmath98 . in the semiclassical superradiant regime @xmath99 , the momentum gained by the atoms scattering photons is much larger than @xmath100 .",
    "the collective dynamics begin as soon as the pump power builds up in the ring cavity .",
    "we study this dynamics via the evolution of the power @xmath101 . in the semi - classical regime",
    ", the time signal of the probe light shows characteristic maxima and minima as shown in fig.2 . here",
    ", we have taken the bec to be at rest initially ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "this behaviour can be explained as follows : the atoms occupy an initial momentum eigenstate and are coupled to the final momentum state by the two - photon transition .",
    "the time evolution is like the usual rabi oscillation .",
    "this coherent dynamics leads to the build up of an atomic density in each state and minimum when all atoms are in the initial or final state .",
    "the scattered light is proportional to the contrast of the atomic density grating .",
    "maxima in @xmath102 is observed whenever the momentum state of the atoms change .",
    "the temporal decay of the atomic density grating due to various decoherence mechanisms .",
    "in fig.2 , we show two curves for two different values of the mirror - photon coupling strength , @xmath95 ( dashed curve ) , @xmath96(solid curve ) . in the semi - classical regime ,",
    "the influence of the micro - motion of the mirror is almost negligible .",
    "the temporal evolution of the light power @xmath102 shown in fig.2 is very much similar to that measured experimentally in a stationary cavity @xcite .",
    "eventhough , the above quantum maxwell - bloch equations are strictly valid in the @xmath103 regime , we still see that it reproduces qualitatively the experimental superradiant spectrum well in the @xmath104 regime also . in the @xmath104 regime , the atomic motion is treated classically . in the following ,",
    "we only study the quantum superradiant regime .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in order to coherently control the superradiant process , we immediately identify a new handle which is inherently present in the current system , i.e the process by which the mechanical mode of the moving mirror can be cooled .",
    "it is well known that a red detuning of the pump laser frequency @xmath9 from the cavity mode @xmath13 by an amount @xmath11 will ensure that the desired anti - strokes process ( required for cooling the mirror to its ground state ) is resonantly enhanced while the deleterious strokes process , being off - resonant , is suppressed @xcite .",
    "consequently , we expect that when @xmath105 , the superradiant process will be amplified since the corresponding mechanical motion of the mirror will be suppressed due to the opto - mechanical cooling process by which energy from the mechanical mode is pumped into the photons . on the other hand when @xmath106 , the superradiant process is suppressed while the mechanical motion of the mirror is amplified due to energy transfer from the photons to the mechanical mode .",
    "this is exactly what we found in the resolved side band ( rsb ) regime ( @xmath107 and @xmath108 ) and the results are depicted in fig.5 .",
    "we note that the intensity of the scattered light is considerably reduced in the rsb regime .",
    "fig.5(a ) is for the case @xmath105 while fig5(b ) is for @xmath106 .",
    "note that this observation is only for strong mirror - photon coupling .",
    "we also found ( figures not shown ) that the amplitude of the mechanical mode @xmath67 was amplified for @xmath106 and was suppressed for @xmath105 .     on the time signal of the scattered light power @xmath109 in the quantum superradiant regime .",
    "all frequencies are in units of the recoil frequency @xmath86 parameters used are : @xmath87 , @xmath110 , @xmath89 , @xmath95 @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath111(dashed line ) and @xmath112 ( solid line ) . compare this figure with the dashed plot of fig 2(a ) .",
    "]    the efficiency of the superradiant process , driven by the coherent coupling between the matter waves , optical field and the phonons , strongly depends on the coherence of the matter - wave grating .",
    "the matter - wave grating has a finite lifetime .",
    "after this time , the matter - wave grating decays and the superradiant process stops .",
    "the decay of the matter - wave grating depends on the initial momentum state of the condensate . in fig.6",
    ", we show two plots , one for @xmath112 ( solid curve ) and for @xmath111 ( dashed ) . as evident , the light power for @xmath112 drops fast without appreciable bragg scattering peaks . on the other hand for @xmath111",
    ", the output light power has spectrum intermediate between that for @xmath90 ( dashed curve of fig.3(a ) ) and for @xmath112 . in the rsb regime",
    ", we found that the initial momentum did not influence the output spectrum anymore .",
    "this is due to the fact that at large detuning @xmath113 , the influence of the term @xmath64 is considerably reduced and since the influence of the initial condensate momentum on the scattered light comes in through this term , the power spectrum @xmath114 is effectively independent of the initial momentum . to demonstrate that the dynamics investigated here are within experimental reach",
    ", we discuss the experimental parameters from @xcite : a bec of typically @xmath115 @xmath116 atoms is coupled to the light field of an optical ultra high - finesse fabry - perot cavity .",
    "the atom - field coupling @xmath117 @xcite ( @xmath118 @xcite ) is greater than the decay rate of the intracavity field @xmath119 @xcite ( @xmath120 @xcite ) .",
    "the temperature of the ultracold atomic gas @xmath121 so that the coherent amplification or damping of the atomic motion is neglected .",
    "typically atom - pump detuning is @xmath122 . from @xcite , the mechanical frequency @xmath123 and @xmath124 . the coupling rate @xmath125 .",
    "the energy of the cavity mode decreases due to the photon loss through the cavity mirrors , which leads to a reduced atom - field coupling .",
    "photon loss can be minimized by using high - q cavities .",
    "our proposed detection scheme relies crucially on the fact that coherent dynamics dominate over the losses .",
    "it is important that the characteristic time - scales of coherent dynamics are significantly faster than those associated with losses ( the decay rate of state - of - art optical cavities is typically 17 khz @xcite ) .",
    "in conclusion , we have analyzed how the superradiant light scattering from an elongated bose - einstein condensate in an optical cavity in the quantum regime is modified by the micro - motion of one of the cavity mirrors . due to the coupling between the cavity photons and the mirror",
    ", the mirror motion has a dispersive effect on the bragg resonance .",
    "the resulting bragg resonance becomes time dependent .",
    "the spectrum of the scattered light shows bragg oscillations ( modified by the mirror motion ) superimposed on the usual superradiant spectrum .",
    "the mechanical frequency of the mirror and the cavity - pump detuning is found to be a new handle to coherently control and manipulate the superradiant light scattering process . in particular",
    ", we found that in the resolved side band regime of the mirror cooling , the superradiant process is enhanced .",
