    "<S> we study the problem of irreversibility when the dynamical evolution of a many - body system is described by a stochastic quantum circuit . </S>",
    "<S> such evolution is more general than a hamiltonian one , and since energy levels are not well defined , the well - established connection between the statistical fluctuations of the energy spectrum and irreversibility can not be made . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the entanglement spectrum provides a more general connection . </S>",
    "<S> irreversibility is marked by a failure of a disentangling algorithm and is preceded by the appearance of wigner - dyson statistical fluctuations in the entanglement spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> this analysis can be done at the wave - function level and offers an alternative route to study quantum chaos and quantum integrability .    in closed quantum systems </S>",
    "<S> , evolution is unitary and both irreversibility and nonintegrability are elusive notions . because of unitarity , evolution is always stable under errors in initial conditions . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in quantum mechanics irreversibility is defined by the vanishing of the probability ( known as fidelity ) of returning to an initial state under arbitrarily small imperfections in the hamiltonian during the reversed time evolution @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nonintegrability is associated to a wigner - dyson distribution of the energy - level spacings that shows level repulsion @xcite and nonintegrable hamiltonians in this context are irreversible . </S>",
    "<S> integrable hamiltonians , instead , tend to show clustering of energy levels but can be either reversible or irreversible @xcite . when the time evolution is not governed by a hamiltonian , or when the hamiltonian is time dependent , energy levels are not well defined and these associations cease to be meaningful </S>",
    "<S> . how can one relate nonintegrability and irreversibility in these more general cases of quantum evolution ?    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we show that one can answer this question by looking at the wave function alone . </S>",
    "<S> this route allows one to study generic quantum evolutions even when energy is not well defined . </S>",
    "<S> we show that by studying the level statistics of the entanglement spectrum one can determine whether the evolution is irreversible or not through a protocol that we call entanglement cooling . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that the onset of irreversibility is marked by the presence of wigner - dyson statistics in the entanglement spectrum .    </S>",
    "<S> the quantum system we consider contains @xmath0 qubits and evolves unitarily from an initial factorized state of the form @xmath1 , with @xmath2 and @xmath3 arbitrary . </S>",
    "<S> formally , the evolution is obtained by applying a unitary matrix @xmath4 to the state vector , @xmath5 form the computational basis , with @xmath6 for @xmath7 . using the language of quantum computing </S>",
    "<S> , we assume that this unitary matrix is represented by gates . </S>",
    "<S> we recall that the two - qubit cnot gate and arbitrary one - qubit rotations are sufficient for universal quantum computing @xcite . in </S>",
    "<S> what follows , we shall restrict the gates to the permutation group , which is a subgroup of the unitary group . </S>",
    "<S> the restriction to the permutation subgroup of unitary transformations allows for a much more efficient computation of the state of the system as it evolves with gates . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we consider the unitary gates in the set @xmath8 depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : gates ] . </S>",
    "<S> we build a stochastic quantum circuit @xmath9 by drawing randomly with uniform probability pairs or triplets of qubits and a random gate @xmath10 with probability @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> we remark that the toffoli gate alone is sufficient for universal classical computation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider more restricted ( and nonuniversal ) circuits obtained by employing only gates in the set @xmath12 .    at each step @xmath13 of the circuit </S>",
    "<S> , the @xmath0 qubits are partitioned into subsystems @xmath14 with @xmath15 and @xmath16 qubits , and the entanglement properties of the system are obtained through the singular values @xmath17 , @xmath18 , which result from the schmidt decomposition @xcite of the state @xmath19 and @xmath20 have eigenvalues @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> these @xmath22 define a probability distribution whose rnyi entropies are defined as @xcite @xmath23 with @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> the zeroth rnyi entropy is related to the rank , namely , the number @xmath25 of nonzero singular values , @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath27 rnyi entropy is the shannon entropy measuring the amount of information in the distribution @xmath28 : @xmath29 .    what happens to entanglement during the evolution with gates ? </S>",
    "<S> one can show that , under a generic stochastic random circuit , entanglement grows linearly with time , and then saturates to its maximum possible value @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this occurs typically , meaning that the probability of having a different outcome is zero in the thermodynamic limit . </S>",
    "<S> a similar behavior is obtained also for the restricted quantum evolutions considered here , whether one uses two- or three - qubit gates . </S>",
    "<S> the saturation value is typically reached after about @xmath30 transformations . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : heat - cool ] , we see a numerical simulation of the protocol used , with both two - qubit and three - qubit gates , which confirms this scenario . </S>",
    "<S> we call this part of the protocol `` entanglement heating . ''    because entanglement increases with the number of gates , in order to revert the evolution to return back to the initial state , it is natural to attempt an algorithm that completely disentangles the system . </S>",
    "<S> the entanglement entropies provide a natural metric to use in a minimization process . if one is able to remove all the entanglement while recording the moves that led to the decreases , one builds one possible reverse algorithm that takes the system from the final state back to the initial ( product ) state . in practice </S>",
    "<S> , we implement such disentangling or `` entropy cooling '' algorithm as follows . </S>",
    "<S> we attempt a gate , chosen at random , and compute the change in entanglement entropy . </S>",
    "<S> then we decide whether or not to accept this gate into the sequence according to a metropolis algorithm : if the entanglement goes down , we always take this move ; if not , we take it with a certain probability , which we decrease as function of the number of attempts ( similarly to simulated annealing , but applied to entanglement entropy and not energy ) . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , we use as the optimization function the sum of the entanglement entropies over all bipartitions of the system into @xmath15 and @xmath16 consecutive qubits with @xmath31 , namely , @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for this choice is that a single bipartition is sensitive only to gates that act on qubits in both subsystems @xmath33 and @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> however , if one considers the sums over the entanglement for all bipartitions , one is sensitive to all reductions in entanglement , no matter where the gates act .    </S>",
    "<S> the resulting @xmath27 rnyi entropy as a function of the gate number for a given sequence of the algorithm using _ only _ the gates in @xmath35 is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : heat - cool](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the data show two examples of the entanglement evolution for two particular `` heating '' and `` cooling '' runs , as well as the average of 128 different realizations with random initial product states for 16 qubits , with each @xmath2 randomly picked from the interval @xmath36 $ ] , and @xmath37 ( thus focusing on real wave functions ) . </S>",
    "<S> we show data for the case when the system is entangled with 512 and with 4096 gates . the system is `` cooled '' by minimizing @xmath38 ( </S>",
    "<S> similar results are obtained when minimizing @xmath39 ) . </S>",
    "<S> notice that the `` cooling '' time for the average curve does not depend on how long the system was `` heated , '' provided that the same maximum entanglement entropy is reached . </S>",
    "<S> the disentangling algorithm works for _ all _ individual realizations of the protocol . </S>",
    "<S> we were _ always _ able to reverse to a completely factorized tensor product state with zero entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> this is quite remarkable , because the success of the algorithm does not depend at all on the amount of the entanglement produced . </S>",
    "<S> so one may wonder whether _ every _ quantum circuit can be reversed with such a cooling protocol .    to answer this question , </S>",
    "<S> consider now the case when entanglement entropy `` heating '' involves the gates in @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> then , apply the disentangling algorithm using the same set of gates . for _ all _ realizations studied </S>",
    "<S> , we find that it is _ never _ possible to completely disentangle the state using the metropolis protocol described above @xcite . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : heat - cool](b ) we show two typical realizations of the heating and cooling protocol , with a random initial product state and 512 random gate sequences for the heating phase . </S>",
    "<S> we also show the average over 128 realizations .    and yet , by only looking at the amount of entanglement generated upon `` heating , '' we can not tell whether the evolution is reversible by the cooling algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> as we have shown , by heating with either two - qubit gates or a mixture of two - qubit and toffoli gates , one rapidly reaches an almost maximally entangled state . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , only for the former are we able to reverse the system back into a product - state form . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , it is known that most states in the hilbert space are maximally entangled , and that generic quantum evolutions will eventually lead to an almost maximally entangled state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this happens even under quantum quench with an integrable hamiltonian @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> what is in the entanglement , which is not the entanglement entropy , that tells us whether a quantum evolution is reversible or not ? </S>",
    "<S> the answer lies in the statistics of the levels @xmath28 in the entanglement spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we have computed the entanglement spectrum of the qubit string at the end of the heating period . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum is obtained from the singular values resulting from the schmidt decomposition of the quantum state upon bipartitioning of the qubit string in the middle ( i.e. , @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum is first unfolded to yield a constant density before the statistical analysis is performed ( see the appendix for a detailed description of the unfolding procedure ) . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : stat_cont](a ) we show the distribution of the spacings between adjacent singular values for reversible cases ( heating period performed with @xmath35 gates ) and irreversible ones ( heating period performed with @xmath40 gates ) . </S>",
    "<S> the difference is striking : while the data points for the irreversible case match quite closely the distribution of spacings of the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) of random matrices @xcite , the data points for the reversible case show a weaker repulsion and follow the so - called semi - poisson statistics , which has been proposed for the energy spectra of systems at metal - insulator transitions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the difference in behavior is also manifest in the spectral rigidity function @xmath42 , which measures , for a given interval @xmath43 , the least - square deviation of the spectral staircase from the best - fitting straight line @xcite . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : stat_cont]b , long - range correlations are much stronger in the irreversible case , with the data points also falling close to the goe prediction . for the reversible case , </S>",
    "<S> the singular values are much less correlated and the spectrum much less rigid . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the statistical fluctuations of the entanglement spectra of irreversible systems are similar to those observed in the energy spectrum of the so - called quantum chaotic systems @xcite .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : stat_disc ] we also show the entanglement level statistics for the particular case when one starts with initial factorized states of the form @xmath44 , @xmath45 , where @xmath46 for @xmath47 , and @xmath48 for @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> we evolve these @xmath50-bit states with @xmath51 gates chosen randomly from the set @xmath40 . the data in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : stat_disc ] clearly conform to the goe statistics , and we observe that the disentangling algorithm again fails , indicating that reversing the computation is extremely difficult . in quantum mechanics , </S>",
    "<S> irreversibility , chaos , nonintegrability and thermalization are phenomena often associated with one another . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , some of these notions are ill defined , such as integrability and lack thereof , and the associations are either weak or plagued by counterexamples . for instance </S>",
    "<S> , irreversibility can be associated to both chaotic and nonchaotic hamiltonians @xcite and there are nonintegrable systems that do not thermalize @xcite . moreover , </S>",
    "<S> some of these concepts are only defined in the context of time - independent hamiltonian evolutions . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the energy levels of a chaotic hamiltonian show wigner - dyson statistics .    in this letter we presented an alternative approach to the question of irreversibility and complex behavior in quantum systems that works purely at the wave - function level . </S>",
    "<S> we did so by studying the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix of a subsystem , the so - called entanglement spectrum @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we showed that ( i ) a disentangling metropolis algorithm provides a firm notion of reversibility , namely , the evolution can be inverted if the state can be disentangled , and ( ii ) irreversibility arises when the level statistics of the entanglement spectrum of a subsystem is wigner - dyson .    on the other hand , in the example we studied where the spectrum did not follow wigner - dyson statistics , we were always capable of reverting the evolution , even with zero knowledge about the quantum circuit . </S>",
    "<S> it is remarkable that the length of the reverted circuit does not depend on the length of the initial circuit , as long as the maximum entanglement entropy is reached . in the disentangling algorithm </S>",
    "<S> , we obtained similar results with the rnyi entropy @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> this is remarkable because @xmath52 is an observable that can be measured @xcite , for example , in optical lattices with ultracold atomic gases @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the results of this work motivate several questions and applications . </S>",
    "<S> the method presented here is applicable to any kind of quantum evolution , regardless of whether it comes from a quantum circuit , a time - dependent or -independent hamiltonian system , or an open quantum system . </S>",
    "<S> first of all , we can examine the behavior of the entanglement level spacing statistics in integrable hamiltonian models both in the ground state or during the time evolution after a quantum quench . </S>",
    "<S> using techniques such as the density matrix renormalization group , one can study these models once integrability is broken . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that our approach can shed new light on the notion of integrability and lack thereof in quantum systems . </S>",
    "<S> the possibility of studying quantum systems away from equilibrium and their universal properties in dynamical phase transitions @xcite and many - body localization @xcite is another feature of the method that only involves wave functions . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , we can study the behavior of the entanglement level spacing statistics at critical points of integrable and nonintegrable systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the adiabaticity of time - dependent quantum processes @xcite can be examined under the lens of the entanglement spectrum as well , with potential applications to adiabatic quantum computing . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , one can study how the complexity of the entanglement spectrum is related to quantum algorithms capable of giving an exponential speedup @xcite . under the same lens of the entanglement spectrum </S>",
    "<S> , one should study the typicality of quantum chaos in random states @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> entanglement is very ubiquitous in the hilbert space @xcite , and while this feature has been crucial to show the typicality of thermalization in closed quantum systems @xcite , this also means that entanglement entropy is unable to characterize quantum irreversibility , and the difference between integrable and nonintegrable systems . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that the understanding of complex quantum behavior lies in the statistics of the fluctuations of the entanglement level spacing .    </S>",
