    "provides a unique view of a photoionized plasma in the region near an accretion disk . is a low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) which exhibits",
    "eclipses , type i x - ray bursts , and intensity dips @xcite .",
    "the x - ray eclipses have a period @xmath4  hr and last for 8.3  min . assuming roche lobe overflow and a primary accretor with @xmath5 , parmar et al . obtained a companion mass of @xmath6 .",
    "they found that the largest @xmath7 corresponds to a main - sequence companion , with a system inclination of 75@xmath8 .",
    "as we will see below , this inclination is favorable for x - ray spectroscopic studies of the accretion flow .",
    "the type i bursts are due to a thermonuclear flash on the surface of an accreting neutron star , which requires a magnetic field @xmath9  g ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the x - ray burst luminosity is near the eddington limit , for a distance to of @xmath10 , so we will assume this value of @xmath11 .",
    "the low @xmath12 implies that the accretion disk can extend all the way in , down to the neutron star surface .",
    "the persistent x - ray luminosity is @xmath13 , and most of this power is released in the innermost radii of the accretion disk and in the boundary layer of the neutron star .",
    "intensity dips are often present in lmxb observed at high - inclination @xcite .",
    "frank et al . attributed the x - ray intensity dips to absorption from photoionized clouds in a two - phase medium above the outer accretion disk . in",
    ", dips are associated with x - ray spectral evolution .",
    "the dips are observed to precede eclipses at orbital phase @xmath14 , or to occur during mid - orbit at @xmath15 .",
    "the depth and duty cycle of the dips varies with each orbit . during the dips ,",
    "the spectrum hardens , as would be expected if they are caused by increased photoelectric absorption @xcite .",
    "a soft x - ray excess was observed at @xmath16    with and @xcite .",
    "this excess was presumed to be associated with the existence of two emission components , or with the `` partial covering '' of the x - ray source by a rapidly variable low - metallicity absorber @xcite .",
    "high - resolution 1023    spectra of showed broad x - ray line emission and drastic spectral variability . @xcite found recombination lines from , , , , and , using the reflection grating spectrometer ( rgs ) .",
    "the k edges of and were visible during the rapid variation periods , but they faded as the soft continuum dimmed .",
    "the velocity broadening of the recombination lines was @xmath17 , and it was found to be correlated with the ionization parameter .",
    "c01 concluded that both emission and absorption features originate from an extended , oblate structure above the accretion disk .",
    "a 335  ks - long exposure of obtained with the rgs also revealed that the cumulative spectrum of 28 type i bursts contains absorption lines which may be identified with and at a redshift of @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "these spectral features could represent the first measurement of a gravitational redshift from the surface of a neutron star , constraining @xmath19 and the nuclear equation of state at high density .",
    "the spectra of the 5 type i bursts detected with the high energy transmission spectrometer ( hetgs ) will be presented elsewhere ( marshall et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .    in this work",
    ", we use the hetgs to perform a spectroscopic analysis of during epochs exclusive of bursts in order to study the circumsource medium of the neutron star , and to constrain the elemental abundances of the accreting matter .",
    "the broadband high - resolution spectra of the hetgs , from @xmath20   , allows us to identify the nature of the absorber which produces the intensity dips .",
    "we measure the density , location , and kinematics of the recombination line region , which constrain models of accretion disk structure .",
    "the observation was performed on 2001 april 14 , with a 47.7  ks exposure ( starting at modified julian day 52013.052 ) .",
    "our data was obtained with the hetgs @xcite , which provides two independent spectra : the high - energy grating ( heg ) spectrum has a resolution of @xmath21    ( fwhm ) , and the medium - energy grating ( meg ) spectrum has a @xmath22   .",
    "we restrict our attention to the @xmath23  portion of the heg spectrum and the @xmath24    portion of the meg spectrum .",
    "the photons were detected with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis - s ) detector .",
    "the data were processed to level 2 with the ciao tools version 2.2.1 , using the default spatial and pulse - height extraction regions for the heg and meg spectra .",
    "we used the _ lightcurve _ tool to histogram the count rate as a function of event time .",
    "we used the _ dmcopy _ tool to select time cuts from the event list .",
    "we produced event lists for two different states which were selected by count rate .",
    "we generated an effective area for each event list selection , as well as the exposure maps needed to obtain fluxed spectra using _",
    "mkgarf_. the rebinning and fitting of spectra were performed using the isis program @xcite .",
    "spectra from the @xmath25 and @xmath26 grating orders were combined to obtain the total heg and meg spectra .",
    "these spectra are fit simultaneously with phenomenological models .",
    "the heg and meg spectra are summed for display purposes only , since their line response functions differ considerably .",
    "we performed continuum fits on the hetgs spectra and searched for discrete features .",
    "our criteria for the identification of a discrete spectral feature are that 1 ) the number of counts in the line represents a @xmath27 deviation from the continuum level , 2 ) the equivalent width ( ew ) of the feature is consistent in both heg and meg spectra when both gratings have sufficient counts , or else that the feature is observed in the @xmath25 and @xmath26 orders of the grating with the largest effective area , 3 ) the feature does not fall within a chip gap , and 4 ) the identified feature is spectroscopically tenable .",
    "we determined limits on some of the expected features .",
    "the unidentified residuals may , in some cases , be due to instrumental effects .",

    "the appearance of the light curve varies from one waveband to another ( as shown in figure [ fig : wavelc ] ) . both the behavior of the light curves and the spectroscopic data presented below indicate that this variation is mainly due to intensity dips . in the 1.5 to 3    band ,",
    "the x - ray flux is nearly constant outside the eclipse and burst epochs , and only traces of dips are discernible .",
    "most of the variability in the hard band of the persistent light curve is statistical .",
    "significant changes in the accretion rate are not discernible in the light curve .",
    "we observe four eclipses , each lasting @xmath29  s. we find five type i x - ray bursts which are each @xmath30  s in duration .",
    "at least some of the variation of burst brightness appears to be due to a variable absorbing column of gas in the line - of - sight , since the dimmest burst ( the fifth in time order ) occurs during a pre - eclipse dip phase .",
    "the second - dimmest burst ( also the second in time ) occurs just before a pre - eclipse dip . in the 3 to 6    band , there are two types of dips , stochastic and periodic .",
    "the periodic dips occur at mid - orbit ( @xmath15 ) and before eclipse ingress ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the light curve evolves with each successive binary orbit .",
    "the evolution of the dips from one binary orbit to the next indicates that the accretion flow geometry is changing at the outer edge of the accretion disk . above 6  ",
    ", the light curve appears to have `` soft flare '' events ( * ? ? ?",
    "* c01 ) , one of which is in our data near the 8  ks mark .",
    "alternatively , these `` soft flares '' can be explained by the variability of the absorber column , which is found in the high - resolution spectra (  [ sub : dips ] ) . above 6  ",
    ", the eclipse ingresses appear to fade away because of deep pre - eclipse dips .",
    "in contrast , the eclipse egresses do appear in the @xmath31    light curve because dips are shallow at those times .",
    "the intensity dip timescale is shorter than the size of the bins in the hetgs light curve ( @xmath32  s ) .",
    "there are rapid intensity fluctuations which drive the count rate from maximum to minimum , or an order of magnitude change in the soft ( @xmath31   ) band , as shown in figure [ fig : wavelc ] .",
    "these fluctuations are common in the data and are statistically significant .",
    "we obtain spectra for selected time intervals , with cuts based on the light curve , to isolate events during the deep dip state , the persistent ( or shallow dip ) state , the eclipses , and the burst events .",
    "to make the cuts , we use the light curve for @xmath31  in figure [ fig : wavelc ] .",
    "first , we exclude the times during bursts and eclipses .",
    "then , we set a fiducial cut at 0.3  , below which we obtain the _ dip state _ with an exposure of 29.5  ks , and above which we obtain the _ persistent state _",

    "the hetgs x - ray spectra reveal emission and absorption features which evolve with the soft x - ray intensity .",

    "components 2 and 3 have a smaller absorbing column than component 1 .",

    "the recombination lines have larger ews during dips , because the x - ray continuum is weaker during the dip states than during the persistent states .    in the following ,",
    "we constrain the density , temperature , and dynamics of the photoionized plasma .",
    "we measure the elemental abundance ratios in the emitting plasma .",

    "we caution that the detection of more ionic species is desirable to further constrain the dem and to make the mg / ne abundance measurements more robust .",

    "the dips at @xmath15 may originate in a warp or bulge on the outer rim of the disk .",
    "the stochastic dips are either due to stochastic structure at the outer disk rim or are located at the inner disk . whereas c01 reported no measured change in the k - shell absorption edges of and , we find evidence for variability of the optical depth of the k - shell edge , which is correlated with dip activity .",
    "the spectral changes imply that all the intensity variations outside eclipses and bursts are due to dips , and that these dips are produced by column density variations of the partially ionized absorber .",
    "the soft x - ray continuum region is spatially compact , whereas the recombination emission region is extended .",
    "the emission region size can be inferred from the orbital phase variations in the light curve .",
    "c01 concluded that both continuum and line emission regions should be extended , because the 635   intensity was independent of orbital phase .",

    "these density limits agree with those derived for the in emission ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mgdiag ] ) , and therefore the same region can produce the observed absorption and emission . similarly with @xmath113 , we set @xmath114 , which is consistent with the r ratio .",
    "our finding that the absorber has two components with distinct ionization parameters supports the picture proposed by @xcite to explain the origin of the intensity dips in lmxbs . in this picture , the presence of episodic dips is explained by the transit of clouds embedded in a two - phase medium which is produced by photoionization .",
    "the spectroscopic evidence points to a recombination region which is located above the outer accretion disk .",
    "we constrain the density and location of the emission region , based on 1 ) the ionization level of calculated with photoionization equilibrium models , 2 ) the emission measure derived from the he@xmath34 flux , and 3 ) the interpretation of the velocity broadening as circular keplerian motion around the neutron star .",

    "this implies that the emissivities of different ions have similar @xmath40 dependence . in that case , for ions at a given @xmath40 from the neutron star , a density gradient is needed to produce distinct ionization parameters . instead of the radially layered ionization structure proposed by c01",
    ", we find that vertical stratification of the disk density at each radius can explain the observed line widths .    the presence of photoionized plasma at large disk radii and at a height @xmath130 requires a mechanism to expand the disk in the vertical direction .",
    "the disk temperature predicted by the @xcite model for @xmath131 is @xmath132 and it is too low to explain the presence of the h - like and he - like ions , where @xmath133 is the accretion rate in units of @xmath134 , @xmath135 is the neutron star mass in units of 1.4  @xmath136 , and @xmath137 is the radius in units of @xmath138  cm . for @xmath131 , the @xcite scale height to radius ratio",
    "is @xmath139 which is too small to explain the absorption edges at @xmath140 .",
    "c01 suggested through a similar argument that the disk material must be far from hydrostatic equilibrium in the vertical direction .",
    "we propose that two mechanisms cause the disk expansion : 1 ) the impact of the accretion stream with the disk ; and 2 ) the illumination from the neutron star , since the disk is heated and its scale height increases .",
    "firstly , the ram pressure at the site of the impact of the accretion stream with the outer disk will increase the disk thickness . the increase in disk thickness depends on the ratio of the ram pressure to the outer disk pressure , as well as on the cooling timescale of the gas compared to the dynamical timescale .",
    "theoretical calculations show that at @xmath141 , the pre - eclipse dips in can be understood as a result of absorption from a bulge produced by disk - stream impact ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the mid - orbit dips could be due to a similar impact point at smaller radii .",
    "secondly , as shown in figure [ fig : mgdiag ] , photoionization equilibrium models show that irradiation from the observed neutron star continuum can energize the disk and produce the line emission . to illustrate this , consider that the effective temperature of the neutron star continuum is @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the luminosity in units of @xmath144 .",
    "another effect of photoionization heating is to increase the disk photosphere scale height significantly at large radii by roughly @xmath145 models of a centrally illuminated accretion disk atmosphere and corona , which include temperature and pressure gradients as well as radiation transfer , yield atmospheric scale heights @xmath146 which are compatible with the observed ionized absorption , with model parameters @xmath147and @xmath148   @xcite .",
    "these models show that an atmosphere heated by irradiation can produce a geometrically thickened disk in hydrostatic equilibrium .    while a detailed comparison of the data with accretion disk atmosphere models is outside the scope of this article , the models are constrained by the measured line fluxes , the line profiles , and by the dem(@xmath93 ) .",
    "for example , the behavior of the line profiles for ions at different ionization levels provides information on the disk structure .",
    "a disk in which the dem is set by vertical stratification will yield nearly equal @xmath87 for all ions , while if the dem is set by radial stratification , @xmath87 will increase with @xmath93 .",
    "we use the observed @xmath56 ratio to measure the uv emission of the accretion disk , for the low density case .",
    "having established the location of the recombination region by other means , we can use the @xmath56 ratios to estimate the uv luminosity of the disk .",
    "we use the limits on @xmath60 at @xmath149   , 1270   , and 1637   , which are local to the recombination region .",
    "the limits from photoexcitation calculations assume @xmath150 and are shown in table [ tab : helike ] ( see also  [ sub : helike ] ) . taking a fiducial distance between the recombination region and the disk photosphere to be @xmath151  cm",
    ", we get @xmath152@xmath153 , @xmath154@xmath155 , and @xmath156@xmath157 . the uv emission of a model disk with @xmath147is calculated using equation ( [ eq : sstemp ] ) plus a neutron star illumination term , with the disk albedos calculated by @xcite .",
    "the model disk luminosities ( for @xmath158  cm ) are @xmath152@xmath159 , @xmath154@xmath160 , and @xmath156@xmath161 .",
    "if @xmath162  cm , @xmath156@xmath163 is @xmath164% lower and @xmath165 is unchanged for @xmath166   .",
    "we conclude that in the low density limit , the derived lower limits on the uv luminosity are fully consistent with the expected disk emission .",
    "the effects of uv photoexcitation of @xmath63 in the @xmath56 ratio of low- and mid-@xmath167 he - like ions were identified in the spectra of stellar coronae and x - ray binaries .",
    "photoexcitation was taken into account to accurately measure the density in the solar corona with @xcite .",
    "photoexcitation by the uv field in the vicinity of o - stars was found to overwhelm the effect of electron - impact excitation , producing @xmath168 ratios of and , with evidence for similarly low @xmath56 ratios of and @xcite .",
    "direct observations of x - ray and uv spectra showed that photoexcitation can account for the @xmath168 ratio of through in hercules x-1 , an intermediate - mass x - ray binary @xcite . from our data and that of c01 , we have shown that in , photoexcitation by the accretion disk uv emission can drive the @xmath169 ratio of through .      while the ne / o and mg / o abundance ratios derived from our emission line model are within 3@xmath38 of solar , the edge - derived mg / o ratio is larger than the solar value .",
    "the recombination line analysis implies that the em decreases with @xmath93 .",
    "if we assume the line - of - sight gas follows a similar trend , then @xmath170 and the abundance ratio @xmath171 times the solar value ( 3@xmath38 limit ) .",
    "however , the edge - derived abundances may not be as reliable as those obtained from emission lines , since the soft continuum ( absorbed by ) and the hard continuum ( absorbed by ) require distinct spectral components , so our line of sight to them may differ .",
    "there is a marginal detection of a larger - than - expected neutral mg k edge at 9.48    in the spectrum of figure [ fig : tot_detail ] .",
    "the abundance ratio obtained from the emission lines is @xmath172 or @xmath173 times solar , depending on the model chosen ( table [ tab : elem ] ) .",
    "the hetgs spectra reveal discrete absorption and emission features which are the signatures of a photoionized plasma in orbit around the neutron star in .",
    "we discern a compact source of continuum x - rays with hard and soft components , as well as an extended recombination emission region originating in the outer decade in radius above the accretion disk .",
    "the recombination emission is more prominent above 8    and during dips , since it is less absorbed than the compact continuum emission . during three binary orbits , the color dependent x - ray light curves show that the intensity variations are due only to eclipses , type i bursts , and intensity dips , with no evidence for accretion rate changes @xmath174% .",
    "the high - resolution x - ray spectra show that intensity dips are caused by the increase in column density of an absorber which is composed of photoionized plasma and neutral gas . both the edge optical depth and are correlated with dip activity .",
    "the signatures of the photoionized absorber are the k - shell edges of and , as well as the and k - shell edges found by c01 .",
    "the periodic absorber is located in two bulges of the outer accretion disk , one of which is near the accretion stream .",
    "another component of the absorber does not correlate with orbital period .",
    "the photoionized medium also produces emission features with a large velocity broadening of @xmath175 , but with a small systemic velocity @xmath176(at 90% confidence ) .",
    "the radiative recombination emission lines ly@xmath34 , he@xmath34 , ly@xmath34 , he@xmath34 , ly@xmath34 , and he@xmath34 are detected , as well as the rrc of and , which are signatures of a photoionized gas with @xmath3 .",
    "our line model fits imply o / ne and mg / ne abundance ratios within 3@xmath38 of the solar values .",
    "the ionized edges may , however , require a mg / o abundance ratio @xmath177 times solar ( 3@xmath38 )",
    ".    the photoionized plasma is located at the outer decade in radius of an accretion disk which is thickened by x - ray illumination and by the impact of the accretion stream on the disk .",
    "the plasma is located at a height @xmath178 above and below the disk midplane , which is larger than the @xcite model predictions .",
    "spectroscopic constraints on the ionization parameter , density , kinematics , and uv radiation environment of the emitting plasma , all indicate that it is bound in kepler orbits inside the neutron star roche lobe .",
    "x - ray photoionization heating from the neutron star and ram pressure from the accretion stream can sufficiently expand the disk to explain the observed geometry .",
    "accretion disk atmosphere and corona models with vertically stratified ionization can produce disks with the required height .",
    "the ionization structure of the observed emission region can be attributed to vertical disk density gradients , with no evidence for radial temperature stratification .",
    "the measured spectra introduce stringent constraints on the accretion disk structure , and further model comparisons are warranted by the data .",
    "we expect the spectra of the type i bursts in to be partially absorbed by the ionized plasma in the outer accretion disk , particularly during the intensity dip phases and above @xmath179   .",
    "the fifth burst in our hetgs observation shows evidence for such absorption ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : totlc ] and [ fig : wavelc ] ) .",
    "the association we found between dips and an ionized absorber implies that the ionized absorber column on the burst spectra will be largest at orbital phases @xmath15 and @xmath14 , when a disk bulge is in the line of sight .",
    "@xcite reported an ionized absorber outflowing during the late burst phases , which they modeled in the spectrum to discern the gravitationally redshifted features attributed to the neutron star surface .",
    "since the burst duration is much shorter than the outer disk dynamical timescale , this ionized absorber outflow may be produced by material in the outer accretion disk which is radiatively driven by the burst . in that case",
    ", the nature of the outflow would be closely related to the structure of the accretion disk and its time - dependent response to a type i burst .",
