    "to understand the spectacular transport properties of single graphite layers @xcite one has to know which kind of scatterers dominates in a given sample .",
    "indeed , theory predicts the electrical conductivity to be strongly dependent on the particular type of the scatterers being present in the system @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate that the diversity of the conductivity behaviour observed in graphene @xcite can be naturally described employing the concentrations of long and short range scatterers as parameters . according to our microscopic model ,",
    "the conductivity measurements upon potassium doping @xcite obviously suggest a strong domination of the long range scattering potential at all possible carrier concentrations , whereas the nitrogen dioxide doping @xcite induces charged impurities dominating the scattering mechanisms near the conductivity minimum only .",
    "in addition , we shall see that zero chemical doping gives rise to the very sharp minimum conductivity dip observed in refs .",
    "our semiclassical approach fully incorporates the chiral nature of electronic states in graphene which is crucial for a correct description of transport properties .",
    "there are three most important regimes to consider : ( i )  _ long range scattering potential limit . _",
    "the long range potential of charged impurities strongly dominates the scattering processes and governs _ both _ the carrier mobility and the conductivity minimum , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and observed in ref",
    ".  @xcite . here",
    ", the width of the minimum conductivity region is rather broad , with a well defined plateau , and the conductivity minimum itself is around the universal value @xmath0 . upon further chemical doping",
    "the carrier mobility decreases , the conductivity as a function of carrier concentration above its minimum becomes more linear , whereas the residual conductivity defined by the linear fit keeps constant near @xmath1 .",
    "( ii )  _ both long and short range scattering potentials are in play .",
    "_ at somewhat lower charged impurity concentration , the long range scatterers do not play an essential role in the conductivity behaviour far away from the conductivity minimum . here ,",
    "the short range scatterers ( i. e. nano - sized ripples @xcite and other imperfections",
    "@xcite ) govern the carrier mobility which is defined by the linear fit as shown fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and , thus , turns out to be insensitive to the chemical doping , as observed in ref .",
    "the minimum conductivity dip is rather sharp , i. e. no plateau is unambiguously visible .",
    "the conductivity minimum is still around @xmath0 , whereas the residual conductivity can acquire a wide range of values depending on the scattering parameters .",
    "( iii )  _ short range scattering potential limit .",
    "_ if the concentration of the long range scatterers vanishes then the minimum conductivity dip becomes very sharp as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] and observed in refs .",
    "moreover , at zero concentration of long range scatterers the conductivity minimum becomes indistinguishable from its residual value which is not universal and can reach the values up to tens of @xmath2 as observed in ref .",
    "thus , in this latter case both the minimum conductivity dip and carrier mobility are governed by the short range scatterers .    to describe these three cases",
    "theoretically we choose a quasiclassical boltzmann approach since it allows us to get transparent analytical formulas for the electrical conductivity in a broad range of parameters . the most of the previous attempts @xcite based on the boltzmann equation discard the chirality of low energy excitations , and we argue that a proper model must necessary contain _ both _ peculiar properties of carriers in graphene , namely , the linear spectrum of low energy excitations _ and _ its chiral nature .",
    "the quasiclassical approach looks at the first sight inapplicable to investigate the conductivity near its minimum since it is expected to fail at low fermi energies @xmath3 as soon as @xmath4 becomes comparable with @xmath5 .",
    "note , however , that the relaxation time @xmath6 for short range scatterers diverges @xcite at @xmath7 that leads to a constant product @xmath4 larger than @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , as we shall see below , for the long range impurity potentials the conductivity approaches its minimum away from the dirac point which makes the quasiclassical model applicable again .",
    "we start from the dirac hamiltonian @xmath8 describing the low energy excitations in the @xmath9-system of graphene around the @xmath10 corner of the first brillouin zone .",
    "[ here @xmath11 is the effective `` speed of light '' , @xmath12 are the pauli matrices describing the pseudo-(or sublattice-)spin , and @xmath13 is the two - component particle momentum . ] to simplify the model we adopt the valley and spin degeneracy of the electron states , see appendix for details .",
    "the eigenstates have the form @xmath14 where @xmath15 , and the energy spectrum reads @xmath16 . the spinors ( [ psi ] ) contain momentum - dependent phase factor @xmath17 which entangles the momentum and the sublattice degree of freedom .",
    "this chirality of electronic states plays a crucial role in our description .    to consider both short and long range scatterers on the one hand and to avoid having too many fitting parameters on the other , we choose two opposite types of scattering potential , namely , @xmath18 ( with @xmath19 being the radius of the short range scatterers ) , and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the generic one given by @xmath22 .",
    "assuming that the short and long range scatterers have the concentrations @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively , it is easy to derive the corresponding relaxation times @xcite given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 are the renormalised concentrations being only the two fitting parameters .",
    "the characteristic size @xmath19 of ripples and other imperfections is assumed to be near a few @xmath27 .    to incorporate the chiral nature of dirac fermions into the stationary quasiclassical kinetic equation linear in the homogeneous electric field @xmath28 we have to start from its general form @xmath29 \\right ) = \\mathrm{i}[\\hat{f}],\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the density matrix , @xmath31 $ ] is the collision integral . in eq .",

    "to deal with such an equation it is natural to rewrite it in the basis of the eigenvectors ( [ psi ] ) .",
    "the distribution function @xmath32 represents then a @xmath33 matrix , and its off - diagonal elements do not drop out thanks to the chiral nature of the eigenstates ( [ psi ] ) .",
    "this important modification of the boltzmann equation allows us to deal with the essentially quantum effect suggesting that a particle could not only be in one of the states @xmath34 or @xmath35 but in an arbitrary superposition of them .",
    "alternatively one might think about the off - diagonal elements as a manifestation of the _ pseudospin _ precession @xcite associated with the chirality index @xmath36 .    to solve the kinetic equation with respect to @xmath32",
    "we assume the linear response regime ( small @xmath28 ) .",

    "( [ short ] ) is an estimate as well ] , it shows that the residual conductivity is not a constant anymore as long as the short range scatterers dominate .",
    "thus , the residual conductivity depends on both short and long range scatterers , whereas the conductivity minimum is governed by the long range scatterers alone and remains near the typical value @xmath0 , as one can observe in fig .",

    "on the other hand , the carrier mobility @xmath96 depends on @xmath56 and , thus , is unaffected by the chemical doping .",
    "such behaviour indicates the short range scatterers domination in the conductivity measurements upon nitrogen dioxide doping @xcite .",
    "it is instructive to consider the special case @xmath97 in detail . here",
    "the term @xmath43 does not dominate over the logarithmic one @xmath98 at @xmath99 , and , therefore , the latter must be retained .",
    "the conductivity then reads @xmath100 interrestingly , the conductivity minimum is uncertain , but since @xmath19 is small ( @xmath101 ) the conductivity at @xmath99 is indeed indistinguishable from its residual value @xmath102 .",

    "[ fig3 ] and corresponds to the chemically undoped @xcite and suspended @xcite graphene samples where the conductivity demonstrates rather sharp dip with nonuniversal minimum value strongly dependent on scattering parameters .",

    "comparison of the conductivity measurements for suspended and non - suspended graphene @xcite is also consistent with our predictions . ]",
    "given the above theoretical results , let us now analyse recent experiments on graphene samples upon chemical doping @xcite .",
    "we first discuss the case of potassium doping @xcite . here , the width of the minimum conductivity region broadens ( i. e. @xmath107 increases ) whereas both the minimum conductivity and mobility decrease , at least initially . at certain stage , however , the conductivity minimum becomes insensitive to further doping .",
    "these features are clearly understood within our model .",
    "initially , the sample is very weakly doped , and the minimum conductivity is governed by the short range scatterers rather than charged impurities in accordance with eq .",
    "( [ short0 ] ) . at larger potassium concentrations",
    "the long range scatterers start to dominate , the minimum concentration @xmath108 increases whereas the conductivity minimum keeps constant despite further decreasing the mobility .",
    "this limit corresponds to eq .",
    "( [ long0 ] ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite , graphene is dosed by nitrogen dioxide . here",
    ", the width of the conductivity minimum region broadens similar to the previous case but it remains much more narrow than upon potassium doping .",
    "moreover , the carrier mobility and conductivity minimum are both insensitive to doping . according to eq .",
    "( [ short ] ) such data suggest strong domination of the short range scatterers , at least at higher carrier concentrations @xmath109 .",
    "the reason of such a strong suppression of induced charges might be the strong screening of coulomb interactions in the samples examined . such precise description of charged impurities is certainly beyond the scope of this report , where @xmath110 is not screened at all .",
    "we can predict , however , that the minimum conductivity phenomenon takes place even in free hanging graphene sheets , without any influence of the silicon dioxide substrate considered in @xcite .",
    "moreover , our model offers a solution to the urgent minimum conductivity problem .",
    "previous measurements appear to be contradictory in so far as quite a representative group of graphene samples @xcite exhibits the conductivity minimum clustering around @xmath0 , whereas many other samples @xcite demonstrate very wide range of the minimum conductivity values , away from @xmath0 .",
    "now it is clear that the universal conductivity minimum in the samples from @xcite is due to the long range scatterers ( e. g. charged impurities ) with a little influence of ripples and other short range imperfections .",
    "this results in the conductivity dip broaden enough to resolve its bottom at @xmath111 .",
    "( the carrier mobility , however , is not necessarily governed by charged impurities . ) in contrast , the conductivity minimum far away from @xmath0 betrays the lack of the charged impurities in a given sample that makes the conductivity dip sharper and its bottom difficult to resolve , as it is seen from eq .",
    "( [ short0 ] ) .",
    "thus , the minimum conductivity becomes indistinguishable from its residual value which , in general , is sensitive to the concentrations of both long and short range scatterers .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that the conductivity minimum changes from sample to sample in this case . in that way",
    "our model is able to explain the wide diversity of the minimum conductivity values measured in single layer graphene .    as an improtant further conclusion we would like to emphasise that it is the chiral nature of low energy excitations , rather than its linear spectrum , that is responsible for the minimum conductivity phenomenon in graphene .",
    "it is especially obvious for quite perfect graphene samples where long range scatterers ( i. e. charged impurities ) dominate the scattering processes : the conductivity would be given just by the first term in eq .",
    "( [ long0 ] ) , and the conductivity minimum would certainly vanish as long as the chiral nature were discarded .",
    "such a conclusion is consistent with the theoretical investigation of ballistic graphene @xcite and strongly supported by the very experimental fact that bilayer graphene , despite obviously non - linear dispersion law , also exhibits a minimum conductivity of the same order as single layer samples @xcite .",
    "the conductivity measurements for chemically doped bilayer samples are not accessible yet , they would certainly be an _ experimentum crucis _ on which the mechanism is responsible for the conductivity minimum in graphene .",
    "the distribution function @xmath112 for carriers in presence of the electric field @xmath113 can be written as the sum of an equilibrium contribution @xmath114 ( which is just the fermi function ) and a nonequilibrium part @xmath115 which represents a @xmath33 matrix . to find @xmath116 one has to solve eq .",
    "( [ keq ] ) written in the helicity basis ( [ psi ] ) . to do that one has to bear in mind that the spinors are @xmath13-dependent ( via the phase @xmath117 ) ,",
    "thus , the kinetic equation differs from its standart analogue and reads @xmath118= \\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\left ( \\begin{array}{cc } 0 & f_{12}\\left(e_{k+}-e_{k-}\\right ) \\\\",

( [ master1 ] ) .",
    "the reason is that the total hamiltonian @xmath121 ( which includes , in addition to the sublattice index @xmath36 , the spin @xmath122 and valley @xmath123 indices ) does not contain the crossing ( off - diagonal ) terms @xmath124 and @xmath125 , and , therefore spin and valley coherence does not manifest itself in the conductivity . in contrast , the sublattice degree of freedom couples electron and hole states via the off - diagonal terms @xmath126 in the hamiltonian @xmath127 that leads to the non - diagonal velocity operator and electron - hole coherent contributions in the conductivity .    to find the collision integral in eq .",
