    "the discovery of the brout - englert - higgs ( beh ) boson @xcite at the lhc @xcite has completed the standard model ( sm ) , and with it the description of nature with a precision up to few per mille at the electro - weak scale @xcite . moreover , the picture which seems to emerge from the stringent limits set by many of the lhc searches for new physics shows a gap up to the next layer of physics @xcite . neglecting , for the time being , the diphoton excess observed at @xmath4 gev by the lhc collaborations @xcite . ] in this scenario one must use an effective lagrangian approach to study the low energy effects of possible heavy new resonances beyond the lhc reach : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the sm lagrangian , @xmath7 the next scale of new physics and @xmath8 the dimension of the local operators @xmath9 entering in @xmath10 , with @xmath11 the corresponding wilson coefficients .",
    "the classification of all operators @xmath12 of dimension 6 in @xmath13 parameterizing the sm extensions in a model independent way was put forward some time ago @xcite .",
    "the coefficients @xmath14 , which are expected to gather the largest low - energy contributions of the heavy particles , do depend on the particular sm extension considered .",
    "as already noticed , the picture emerging from the lhc searches has boosted the revival of the phenomenological interest in the theoretical prediction of the coefficients of the effective lagrangian up to dimension 6 and up to one - loop order , to cope with the expected experimental precision . with this purpose ,",
    "the procedure to evaluate the contributions of new ( heavy ) physics to this order has been revised in ref .",

    "the evaluation of the one - loop contribution of a generic heavy sector is reduced to an algebraic problem , getting rid of the difficulties associated to the handling of the loop integrals .",
    "this is achieved by the clever use of functional methods using the so called covariant derivative expansion ( cde ) .",
    "its results readily apply to supersymmetric models with r ",
    "parity @xcite , to models in which the heavy sector does not mix linearly with the sm  @xcite and , in general , to models with a ( discrete ) symmetry forbidding such linear terms @xcite .",
    "this work has been also generalized to extend its range of applicability to the case of non - degenerate heavy field masses @xcite .",
    "however , as already emphasized , although it has been claimed that the method applies in general , it does not fully account for all quantum corrections when the sm addition involves heavy fields coupling linearly to the light ( sm ) fields .",
    "since in this case there are one - loop corrections resulting from the exchange of both heavy and light fields within the loops which are not included in the algebraic result , which only accounts for the one - loop diagrams exchanging heavy particles alone . these contributions can be taken care of , however , performing a full matching with the proper local operators , as argued time ago in ref .",
