    "stabilization is one of the central topics of control theory .",
    "it was shown in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite that the class of continuous stationary feedbacks is too restrictive for the purposes of stabilization of nonlinear systems .",
    "in other words , in order to design a continuous feedback stabilizer one needs to use functions depending on time and state @xcite , @xcite . to stay with the class of stationary feedbacks one has to deal with piecewise continuous functions @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the synthesis procedures for both continuous and piecewise continuous stabilizers are developed only for some special types of systems .",
    "for example , in @xcite , @xcite it is shown how to construct stationary piecewise continuous stabilizers for generic two - dimensional affine nonlinear systems .",
    "on the other hand , the papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite show how to design feedbacks for certain types of nonholonomic systems .",
    "both approaches ( nonstationary continuous , and stationary discontinuous ) are quite complicated as far as the feedback synthesis is concerned",
    ".    this paper presents necessary and sufficient conditions for a nonlinear system to be stabilized by a feedback .",
    "the main results are presented in terms that are valid for continuous , discontinuous , stationary and time dependent feedbacks .",
    "our approach is based on the properties of the pontryagin type hamiltonian systems .",
    "the proposed sufficient conditions lead us to an effective feedback synthesis procedure that allows to construct piece - wise continuous stabilizing feedback laws for a general nonlinear system .",
    "consider a system @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the control input ; @xmath2 denotes the state of the system and @xmath3 @xmath4 ",
    "@xmath5-dimensional linear real space .",
    "@xmath6 is a vector field : @xmath7 and @xmath8 is continuously differentiable with respect to @xmath9 we write @xmath10 throughout the paper we assume that @xmath11 is equipped with the scalar product and @xmath12 denotes the magnitude of @xmath13 i.e @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the scalar product of @xmath2 with itself .",
    "consider the initial value problem @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the feedback .",
    "its solution is defined in filippov s sense @xcite .",
    "let @xmath19 be the filippov solution for ( [ system ] ) where @xmath20 and @xmath21 is a feedback law .",
    "we call such solution an equilibrium of ( [ system ] )",
    ". the goal of this paper is to find necessary and sufficient conditions for the feedback @xmath22 to stabilize the system ( [ system ] ) at the origin over a compact set @xmath23 throughout the paper we assume that @xmath18 takes its values from a compact subset @xmath24 the stabilization is defined as follows .",

    "our main goal is to find necessary and sufficient conditions for the feedback ( [ feedback ] ) to stabilize the system ( [ system ] ) .",
    "consider the optimal control problem ( with free end )      where @xmath29 is a lyapunov type function ( see @xcite , @xcite ) and @xmath26 is the solution for @xmath30 where the control input @xmath1 takes its values from the set @xmath31 defined in ( [ controlconstr ] ) .    the existence of the optimal solution for ( [ optimal1 ] ) , ( [ optimal2 ] ) was studied in great details @xcite .",
    "for simplicity we assume that @xmath32 are uniformly bounded for @xmath33 such that @xmath34 @xmath35    then the existence of the optimal trajectory for any @xmath36 follows from the classical arzela s theorem . the conditions ( [ bound ] ) can be relaxed ( at the expense of the simplicity of formulations ) with the help of the results from @xcite          [ necess1 ] if the system ( [ system ] ) with @xmath48 and ( [ bound ] ) is stabilizable over @xmath49 then @xmath50 @xmath51 such that for the solution @xmath52 of ( [ pontryagin1 ] ) , ( [ pontryagin2 ] ) with the initial conditions @xmath53 we have @xmath54 and @xmath55    * proof .",
    "* let the system ( [ system ] ) be stabilizable by a feedback @xmath18 over a compact set @xmath56 then @xmath57 where @xmath58 denotes the solution of the initial value problem @xmath59 we need to prove that for any @xmath60 and any @xmath61 there exist @xmath62 and @xmath63 such that @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the @xmath2-part of the solution @xmath52 of ( [ pontryagin1 ] ) , ( [ pontryagin2 ] ) .",
    "consider the extremal problem ( [ optimal1 ] ) , ( [ optimal2 ] ) , where @xmath66 it follows from ( [ bound ] ) and the classical arzela s theorem that the optimal solution exists .",

    "restriction of the differential form @xmath83 to this manifold is equal to zero .",
    "the lagrangian manifold @xmath84 defined by the trajectories of ( [ pontryagin1 ] ) , ( [ pontryagin2 ] ) emitted from @xmath79 plays an important role in analyzing stabilization and in designing feedback stabilizers . in order to illustrate the significance of @xmath85 for the stabilization problems",
    "we turn our attention to stationary control systems having the form @xmath86 the lagrangian manifold @xmath84 we define as the set of trajectories for @xmath87 emitted from the manifold @xmath88 where @xmath89      the property ( [ guigens ] ) implies the guigens principle for the propagation of `` light '' described by ( [ pontryagin3 ] ) . in other words ,",
    "the property ( [ guigens ] ) suggests ( see @xcite ) that we can treat stabilization similar to a problem from optics . in the terminology of optics theorem [ necess1 ]",
    "states that for the system to be stabilizable at the origin over a compact set @xmath94 it is necessary that the sources of `` light '' located on the surface of any tiny ball centered at the origin illuminate all points from @xmath56 the tiny ball can be replaced by the set where @xmath95 moreover , the wave fronts are defined by the projections to @xmath2-space the level sets of the function @xmath96 under certain conditions ( see @xcite ) theorem [ necess1 ] is not only necessary but also sufficient for stabilization .",

    "* we follow the ideas presented in @xcite and choose the feedback @xmath105 equal to @xmath106 for all @xmath2 such that @xmath95 on the other hand , if @xmath107 and @xmath2 belongs to the projection of @xmath102 onto the @xmath2-space then we define the feedback as @xmath108 where the function @xmath109 is defined by ( [ pontryagin3 ] ) along the lines of well - known pontryagin s procedure and @xmath110 is a function of @xmath2 by the assumption .",
    "theorem [ design ] suggests an efficient feedback design procedure .",
    "however , it tacitly imposes some restrictions in the form of requirements fulfilled by certain properties of the lagrangian manifold @xmath111 although the stabilization problem can be reformulated in optical terms the machinery of lagrangian manifolds and symplectic geometry is not readily available for the control problems .",
    "the main obstacle here lies in the lack of smoothness of the corresponding hamiltonian .",
    "however , since the property ( [ guigens ] ) implies the guigens principle for the propagation of `` light '' described by ( [ pontryagin3 ] ) the lagrangian manifold @xmath102 can be constructed numerically . moreover ,",
    "if the lagrangian manifold @xmath102 does not admit the parametrization by @xmath2 then the corresponding feedback can be designed ( for some applications ) with the ideology provided by the theory of viscosity solutions ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "theorem [ design ] leads us to an effective design synthesis of feedback laws suitable for various applications of control theory . the format and the size of this brief note",
    "does not allow us to consider in details various applied versions of theorem [ design ] .",

    "e.g. , @xcite for details and further references ) . due to the special form of ( [ pontryagin4 ] ) and the condition ( [ transversal ] ) we obtain with the help of liouville theorem that the jacobian @xmath134 is not equal to zero along the bicharacteristics .",
    "therefore , the lagrange manifold @xmath104 locally admits a generating function @xmath135 ( defined as ( [ generating ] ) , see also @xcite ) .",
    "hence , the control @xmath136 depends only on @xmath2 as long as the solutions of ( [ pontryagin4 ] ) are transverse to the switching surface defined by ( [ switching ] ) .",

    "it follows from ( [ fullrank ] ) ( see chapter 2 from @xcite ) that for any point from the equilibrium set one can construct a locally stabilizing feedback and the corresponding lyapunov function .",
