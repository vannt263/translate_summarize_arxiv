    "in @xcite witten pointed out the mathematical inconsistency of an @xmath0 gauge theory coupled to only an odd number of weyl fermions .",
    "the inconsistency arises when one considers the behaviour of the effective action under topologically non - trivial gauge transformations ( @xmath1 = { \\mathbb { z}}_2 $ ] ) , i.e. those that can not be continuously deformed to the identity mapping .",
    "let @xmath2 be one of those non - trivial mappings .",
    "the gauge fields @xmath3 and its gauge transformed @xmath4 are not connected by some smooth gauge transformations .",

    "witten showed that along this trajectory an odd number of eigenvalues of the square root of the dirac operator crosses zero , leading to a switch of sign in the fermionic determinant @xcite .",
    "the theory is thus ill - defined because the fermion determinant can not be defined in a gauge invariant and smooth way .",
    "afterwards , the witten anomaly has been established by other arguments . in particular",
    ", the change in the phase of the effective action under @xmath0 gauge transformations can be calculated using the so - called _ embedding technique _ @xcite .",
    "here one uses the fact that @xmath0 can be embedded in another group with a trivial @xmath7 , say @xmath8 .",
    "the gauge fields @xmath3 and @xmath9 are then connected by some smooth family @xmath10 of gauge transformations in @xmath8 . in this context",

    "progress has been made to formulate chiral gauge theories on the lattice as has been summarised in @xcite .",
    "any proper lattice formulation of an @xmath0 theory coupled to one doublet of chiral fermions should exhibit the witten anomaly .",
    "this has been studied in the context of the overlap formalism @xcite .",
    "our purpose is showing how global anomalies arise in the recently developed action formalism @xcite .",
    "exact chiral symmetry @xcite can be achieved on the lattice provided the wilson - dirac operator @xmath12 fulfils the ginsparg - wilson relation @xcite .",
    "having exact chiral symmetry allows us to split the fermion fields in left- and right - handed , independently transforming components @xcite . in particular",

    "the operator @xmath16 is such that @xmath18 . in this way",
    "@xmath16 is the transporter of @xmath19 along the path .",
    "one key point here is that if the path is a closed loop , the operator @xmath20 is not necessarily the identity map .",
    "indeed , @xmath21 is an indication of a non - trivial bundle structure of the gauge field . as a measure for this",
    "let us define the quantity =  , for all closed loops . using the unitarity of @xmath16",
    "one easily proves that @xmath22 is a phase .",
    "in particular , for gauge fields in @xmath0 , using charge conjugation symmetry and the reality properties of the @xmath0 representations we have @xmath23 .",
    "finally we remark that the composition law _",

    "the difficulty arises due to the gauge field dependence of the constraint ( [ cons1 ] ) .",
    "in fact , an infinitesimal deformation @xmath25 of the gauge field @xmath26 , induces a change in the phase of the fermionic measure given by the so - called measure term @xcite _ = i _ j ( v_j , _",
    "v_j ) a^4 _ x ^c_(x)j^c_(x )  , [ measu ] where @xmath27 is the colour index and @xmath28 is a basis of left - handed fields at @xmath26 .",
    "we are then left with a gauge dependent phase ambiguity which has to be fixed in order to achieve the gauge invariance and the locality of the effective action . in @xcite the problem is solved by choosing a current @xmath29 , local and gauge invariant function of the gauge fields , and such that an integrability condition is fulfilled .",
    "this condition is formulated in terms of the wilson line = \\ { i _ 0 ^ 1 dt l _ }  , where @xmath30 . @xmath31 measures the total change of phase along a given path @xmath14 in the set of gauge fields .",

    "let us discuss the meaning of this condition .",
    "a local and gauge invariant current defines @xmath31 only locally . in ( [ ic ] ) it is pointed out that the current must take into account the global geometry of the bundle underlying the gauge field .",
    "global anomalies arise when ( [ ic ] ) is not satisfied .    in the classical continuum limit , requiring a local and gauge invariant effective action implies @xcite j_(x ) = 0 + o(a )  .",
    "[ jcc ] therefore @xmath32 in this limit and the integrability condition can only be satisfied if @xmath33  for all closed loops .    in the next section",
    "we will show that in the @xmath0 theory with a single weyl fermion there are closed loops in configuration space on which @xmath34 .",
    "therefore the anomaly arises because the proper classical continuum limit can not be reproduced .",
    "let @xmath2 be a non - trivial @xmath0 gauge transformation , and consider its lattice version acting on the classical vacuum , @xmath35 .",
    "there are three different paths in configuration space connecting the classical vacuum with its gauge transformed , @xmath36 :    * @xmath37 @xmath38 $ ] pure gauge @xmath0 * @xmath39 @xmath40 $ ] pure gauge @xmath8 * @xmath41 @xmath42    @xmath43 has no continuum limit .",

    "this argument holds for the vacuum in @xmath51 .",
    "however , in @xmath0 the anomaly is identically zero in any configuration .",

    "we convert the line integral into a surface integral . on this surface",

    "we want to point out that our proof is not restricted to have the classical vacuum as starting configuration ( although it would be sufficient for the theory to be inconsistent ) . since @xmath22 is a homotopy invariant , smooth deformations of the loop can not change its value .",
    "next we want to show that the global anomaly we discovered in the previous section can be brought into a form that its equivalence to witten s anomaly @xcite is transparent .",
    "it will turn out that if we restrict ourselves to a real fermion determinant , @xmath61 implies a change of sign along the loop @xmath46 $ ] .    to start with consider the function f(t ) = ( 1-p_+ + p_+d_tq_td_0^ ) , that is a smooth function of @xmath57 for smooth paths .",
    "in addition it is real if the gauge group is @xmath0 . for closed loops that function satisfies f(0)>0 , & & f(1 ) = tf(0 )  , if @xmath12 has no zero mode at the starting point .",
    "this implies that @xmath62 passes through zero an odd number of times for @xmath63 if and only if @xmath64 .",
    "next one can show [ f_squared ] f^2 ( t ) = d_t d_0^. if @xmath65 , the eigenvalues of @xmath12 come in complex conjugate pairs , i.e. d=_i_i^ *  .",
    "according to ( [ f_squared ] ) a passing through zero of @xmath66 at @xmath67 implies a passing through zero of an odd number of eigenvalues @xmath68 .",
    "one can prove this by expanding both @xmath62 and @xmath69 around @xmath67 .",
    "hence we have found that for any given loop in field space , starting at a point where @xmath12 has no zero modes , an odd number of pairs of eigenvalues of @xmath12 cross zero if and only if @xmath34 .",
    "hence we find the same behaviour of the eigenvalues that witten proved in @xcite using the atiyah  singer index theorem and that he used to conclude a change of sign of the fermion determinant .",
    "we can find the same here .",
    "in general , the fermion determinant is given by @xcite [ formula_det ] m_tm_0^ = f(t ) w^-1  .",
    "if we define @xmath70 we end up with a real fermion determinant all along the path . according to the properties of @xmath62 , we find that @xmath71 is negative",
    ". therefore @xmath72 changes sign along a loop with @xmath61 .",
    "note however , that a change of sign is closely connected to the definition of a real fermion determinant .",
    "if we allow for complex values too and define a current @xmath73 such that @xmath31 equals @xmath74 at the end of the loop , the fermion determinant is single valued . in that case the anomaly shows up in the disguise of a conflict with the correct continuum limit of @xmath73 ( [ jcc ] ) and @xmath31 .",
    "in the last section we have seen that @xmath75 implies that an odd number of pairs of eigenvalues of @xmath12 cross zero . on a finite lattice it is possible to confirm this crossing by a numerical computation of the spectral flow of an appropriate lattice dirac operator , as we will see now .",
    "neuberger s operator @xcite is an example for a dirac operator that satisfies the ginsparg - wilson relation .",
    "it is explicitly given by [ def_neub_op ] ad & = & 1-a(a^a)^-1/2 , + a & = & 1 - ad_w .",
    "@xmath76 denotes the usual wilson  dirac operator .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath77 of @xmath78 lie on a unit circle around 1 in the complex plane",
    ". they can be parameterised by an angle @xmath79 according to [ def_ev ] _ j & = & 1 -e^i_j .",
    "furthermore the eigenvalues come in complex conjugate pairs @xmath80 due to @xmath65 .",
    "we are interested in the spectral flow of neuberger s operator along the loop @xmath81 $ ] . according to the last section we expect an odd number of eigenvalues that cross zero and go over into its complex conjugate value .    along @xmath43",
    "the eigenvalues are constant as a function of @xmath57 because it is a path of gauge transformations .",
    "the non  trivial part is along @xmath45 where we numerically computed the eigenvalues .",
    "this has been done in two steps .",
    "first of all we computed the low lying eigenvalues of the hermitian operator @xmath82 .",
    "they are given by the squared magnitude @xmath83 of the eigenvalues ( [ def_ev ] ) . in a second step we calculated the imaginary part of @xmath84 , i.e. the eigenvalue with the smallest imaginary part at the beginning of the path .",
    "this is sufficient for our purpose . before discussing the results",
    "let us make some remarks concerning the numerical computation itself .",
    "we used a power series expansion into chebyshev polynomials for the inverse square root of @xmath85 in ( [ def_neub_op ] ) .",
    "the conjugate gradient algorithm @xcite has been employed for the computation of the eigenvalues . in that way",
    "both the truncation and the numerical error are theoretically well under control .    for numerical reasons the path we used differs slightly from @xmath45 .",
    "we did not start at the classical vacuum configuration but at a constant gauge field instead .",
    "this results in a gap of the spectrum at @xmath86 and @xmath87 and is advantageous in the numerical computation .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the first six lowest lying eigenvalues of @xmath82 as a function of the path parameter @xmath57 .",
    "the obvious symmetry of the spectrum is due to our path parameterisation and the symmetry properties of the particular @xmath88 we used .",
    "the magnitude of all but one eigenvalue is unequal to zero for the whole path .",
    "only the lowest eigenvalue becomes zero for @xmath89 .",
    "hence only the imaginary part of @xmath84 may cross zero and changes sign . to see if it really changes sign we calculated directly the imaginary part of @xmath84 .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and indeed we find a crossing . hence only one pair of eigenvalues crosses zero and we numerically confirmed a spectral flow that we have expected .",
    "= 7.5 cm    = 7.5 cm    the change of sign of the fermion determinant can now be shown very explicitly . in terms of the angles",
    "@xmath90 the fermion determinant reads as [ def_detm ] m_t & = & _ j2 .",
    "here we fixed the phase of the fermion determinant such that @xmath91 is real .",
    "however , we still have a sign ambiguity .",
    "suppose we want to fix the sign but also insist on a smooth gauge field dependence of @xmath91 .",
    "this implies that the sign at @xmath86 fixes the sign along the whole path @xmath92 . in terms of the angle @xmath90 our numerical result runs as follows : only the angle @xmath93 crosses zero and changes sign . a glance at ( [ def_detm ] )",
    "immediately tells us that the fermion determinant changes sign along the closed path @xmath92 and is not a single valued function .",
    "let us give a brief summary of our result .",
    "we have shown that there are closed loops in configuration space on which the phase @xmath94 . in a finite lattice",
    "it would be possible to define a current @xmath29 such that the associated measure produces a wilson line @xmath95 .",
    "however , the conflict arises because the proper behaviour in the classical continuum limit can not be reproduced : going to large physical lattices ( small lattice spacing ) and insisting in @xmath96 , implies giving up the locality or the gauge invariance of the theory .",
    "our argument is completely analytical , in particular the behaviour close to the continuum limit is under control .",
    "we have also checked numerically the original argument given by witten .",
    "we find that along a path connecting two gauge fields that differ by a topologically non - trivial gauge transformation , the lowest eigenvalue of neuberger s operator crosses zero . subsequently there exist closed loops in configuration space where the fermion determinant changes sign .",
    "on the lattice all gauge transformations can be deformed to the identity mapping .",
    "as we have seen it does not mean that global anomalies are not present in the lattice formulation , but they rather arise in a different way .",
