    "in this paper we construct a nonsingular bouncing cosmology with an ekpyrotic contracting phase .",
    "the model is free from the problems typically associated with ` matter bounce ' or pure ekpyrotic models .",
    "both the matter bounce ( see e.g. @xcite for a recent review ) and the ekpyrotic scenario ( see e.g @xcite for an in - depth overview ) were proposed as alternatives to inflationary cosmology as an explanation for the origin of the observed structure in the universe . while these models are faced with serious challenges we show that these challenges can be ameliorated by combining attributes of both scenarios .",
    "we begin with a discussion of the successes and problems of the matter bounce model .",
    "some time ago it was realized that curvature fluctuations which originate as quantum vacuum fluctuations on sub - hubble scales and which exit the hubble radius during a matter - dominated epoch of contraction acquire a scale - invariant spectrum @xcite . in a number of toy models",
    ", it was shown that this spectrum often persists if the matter - dominated phase of contraction is continued in a nonsingular way to the expanding phase of standard big bang cosmology .",
    "a nonsingular bouncing model can be obtained by using null energy condition ( nec ) violating matter such as quintom matter @xcite or lee - wick matter @xcite , by making use of either a ghost condensate construction @xcite , the ghost - free higher derivative gravity model of @xcite , or galileon fields @xcite , and it arises in horava - lifshitz gravity @xcite in the presence of spatial curvature @xcite .",
    "a nonsingular bounce can also be obtained @xcite in the context of mirage cosmology @xcite , by taking into account the effect of extra time - like dimension @xcite , by making use of nonconventional k - essence model @xcite , or in a universe with nontrivial curved geometries @xcite . in all of these cases",
    "it was found ( under certain assumptions ) that the spectrum of perturbations on scales relevant to current cosmological observations does not change its spectral index during the bouncing phase .",
    "thus , such nonsingular cosmologies provide an alternative to inflation for producing a scale - invariant spectrum of cosmological perturbations today .",
    "a difficult problem facing bouncing cosmologies is that the homogeneous and isotropic background cosmological solution is unstable to the development of radiation @xcite and anisotropic stress .",
    "the latter instability leads to the famous bkl @xcite mixmaster cosmology , opposed to a homogeneous and isotropic bounce .    in the ekpyrotic scenario @xcite ,",
    "the contracting branch solution is a local attractor @xcite , similar to the accelerating expanding cosmological solutions in inflationary models . in ekpyrotic cosmology",
    "there is the assumed existence of a matter fluid with an equation of state @xmath0 ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 being pressure and energy densities , respectively ) .",
    "the energy density in this fluid blueshifts faster than the contribution of anisotropic stress in the effective energy density .",
    "thus , the fluid comes to dominate during the contracting phase and prevents the development of the bkl instability .    within the context of a pure ekpyrotic model , the curvature fluctuations on super - hubble scales in the contracting phase are not scale - invariant ; although , the fluctuation in the bardeen potential @xmath3 @xcite which describes the metric inhomogeneities in the longitudinal gauge are scale - invariant ( see e.g. @xcite for discussions of this issue ) .",
    "the initial ekpyrotic scenario @xcite had a singularity in the effective field theory at the transition point between contraction and expansion .",
    "the question of how fluctuations transfer from the contracting to the expanding phase is non - trivial in this context ( see e.g. @xcite for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "there are prescriptions according to which the spectrum of fluctuations after the bounce is scale - invariant @xcite . also , there are typically entropy modes present in ekpyrotic models .",
    "these entropy modes can acquire a scale - invariant spectrum by the same mechanism that @xmath3 acquires such a spectrum @xcite , and will then induce a scale - invariant spectrum for the curvature fluctuations by the usual mechanism of isocurvature modes seeding an adiabatic fluctuation .",
    "this leads to the so - called  new ekpyrotic \" scenario @xcite .",
    "scale - invariant entropy modes arise from fluctuations of the extra metric fluctuation modes in higher dimensions @xcite , the setting in which the ekpyrotic scenario was initially proposed .",
    "however , in the context of the new ekpyrotic scenario , one has to worry about instabilities during the bounce phase , an issue recently raised in @xcite .",
    "the model we propose in this paper is free from the complications associated with entropy modes and the transfer of fluctuations through singular bounces . in this scenario",
    ", it is the curvature fluctuations which are scale - invariant .",
    "this spectrum is inherited from the phase of matter contraction which preceded the phase of ekpyrotic contraction .",
    "there are no low mass entropy modes leading to the complicated issues existing in pure ekpyrotic models .",
    "the cosmological bounce is nonsingular and hence the transfer of fluctuations from the initial contracting phase to the expanding period can be treated exactly .",
    "we find that the spectral index of the fluctuations on infrared scales relevant to current observations does not change during the bounce .",
    "the amplitude of the curvature fluctuations are boosted by a significant , scale - independent , factor @xmath4 , ( for long wavelength modes ) .",
    "we demonstrate that our model is free from the instability problems raised in @xcite .    in this model",
    "the background dynamics before and during the bounce are determined by a single scalar field @xmath5 with non - trivial kinetic action of the form used in ghost condensate @xcite and galileon models @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we add to this field a negative exponential potential similar to what is used in the ekpyrotic scenario .",
    "this potential leads to a phase of ekpyrotic contraction . at high densities , the coefficient of the part of the kinetic term which is standard becomes negative , and this leads to a nonsingular cosmological bounce similar to what is achieved in the new ekpyrotic scenario @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "after the bounce , the coefficient of the kinetic term becomes positive again , a period of kinetic - driven expansion sets in , lasting until the radiation and matter dominated periods of standard cosmology .",
    "we can imagine that the initial contracting phase of the universe mimics our currently observed universe , namely a state filled with regular matter and radiation . since the kinetic energy density of @xmath5 increases faster in the contracting phase than both that of matter and radiation , eventually @xmath5 will begin to dominate .",
    "given this setup , our model provides a realization of the matter bounce scenario of @xcite which is free from the anisotropy problem which generically affects bouncing cosmologies .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in the next section we introduce the model and discuss the cosmological background dynamics , both analytically and numerically . in section iii",
    "we show how cosmological fluctuations evolve through the bouncing phase .",
    "the final section is reserved for discussion .",
    "we defined the reduce planck mass by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is newton s gravitational constant .",
    "the sign of the metric is taken to be @xmath8 .",
    "note that we take the value of the scale factor at the bounce point to be @xmath9 throughout the paper .",
    "it is well known that , in order to realize a successful nonsingular homogeneous and isotropic bounce in a spatially flat ( @xmath10 ) friedmann - robertson - walker - lemaitre ( frw ) universe in the framework of standard einstein gravity , the null energy condition for matter must be violated .",
    "this is because at the bounce point the time derivative of the hubble parameter is greater than zero while the hubble parameter itself is zero .",
    "this implies that the total energy density vanishes while the pressure is negative , _ i.e. , that the background equation of state is @xmath11 .",
    "one way to achieving such a scenario is via a ghost condensate field @xmath5 @xcite in which the lorentz symmetry is broken spontaneously in the infrared , with the kinetic term for @xmath5 taking on a non - vanishing expectation value .",
    "however , this type of model suffers a gradient instability since the square of the sound speed of its perturbations becomes negative in the phase of ghost condensation .",
    "another mechanism of achieving null energy condition violation is to make use of a galileon type field .",
    "the key feature of this type of field is that it contains higher order derivative terms in the lagrangian while the equation of motion remains second order , and thus does not lead to the appearance of ghost modes .",
    "galileon fields have been used to construct emergent universe scenarios in which the universe begins with a quasi - static phase @xcite",
    ". there have also been recent studies of galileon models which yield cosmologies with a nonsingular bounce , but in which a space - time singularity of big rip type arises after the bouncing phase @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we present a nonsingular bouncing solution in terms of a single field having the desirable features of both the ghost condensate and galileon - inspired models .",
    "_      the most general form of single scalar field lagrangian giving rise to second - order field equations in four - dimensional spacetime can be expressed as  @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath7 are functions of a dimensionless scalar field @xmath5 and its canonical kinetic term @xmath14 the standard kinetic lagrangian corresponds to @xmath15 and all other terms vanishing .",
    "a more general form is @xmath16 with @xmath17 used in  k - essence \" models @xcite .",
    "the other kinetic terms of @xmath5 include the operator @xmath18 the terms @xmath19 and @xmath20 are higher order operators which are usually suppressed at low energy scales .",
    "thus , in the present paper we will ignore them and focus on the first two terms adopting the form in the  kinetic gravity braiding \" ( kgb ) model of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "variation of the above matter action minimally coupled to einstein gravity leads to the modified einstein equation : @xmath21 in the above formalism , @xmath22 and @xmath23 denote derivatives with respect to @xmath5 and @xmath24 , respectively .    for the model under consideration",
    "we choose : @xmath25x + \\beta x^2 - v(\\phi)~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we introduce a positive - definite parameter @xmath26 so that the kinetic term is bounded from below at high energy scales .",
    "for @xmath27 a ghost condensate ground state with @xmath28 can arise .",
    "note that the first term of @xmath13 involves @xmath29 since in the present paper we adopt the convention that the scalar field @xmath5 is dimensionless .",
    "we have also introduced a non - trivial potential @xmath30 for @xmath5 .",
    "this potential is chosen such that ekpyrotic contraction is possible . in the specific model which we will discuss in the following , the scalar field evolves monotonically from a negative large value to a positive large value .",
    "the function @xmath31 is chosen such that a phase of ghost condensation only occurs during a short time when @xmath5 approaches @xmath32 .",
    "this requires the dimensionless function @xmath33 to be smaller than unity when @xmath34 but larger than unity when @xmath5 approaches the origin .",
    "the term @xmath7 is a galileon type operator which is consistent with the fact that the lagrangian contains higher order derivative terms in @xmath5 , but the equation of motion remains a second order differential equation .",
    "phenomenologically , there are few requirements on the explicit form of @xmath7 .",
    "we introduce this operator since we expect that it can be used to stabilize the gradient term of cosmological perturbations , which requires that the sound speed parameter behaves smoothly and is positive - definite throughout most of the background evolution . for simplicity",
    ", we will choose @xmath7 to be a simple function of only @xmath24 : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a positive - definite number .",
    "we now study the equations of motion which result from applying the lagrangian ( [ lagrangian ] ) to the flat frw universe whose metric is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is cosmic time , @xmath39 are the comoving spatial coordinates and @xmath40 is the scale factor .",
    "thus , the kinetic terms of a homogeneous and isotropic scalar field background become @xmath41 the dot denotes the derivative with respect to cosmic time @xmath38 .",
    "the hubble parameter is @xmath42 .    for this background",
    "the energy density is @xmath43 and the pressure is @xmath44 by computing the diagonal components of the stress - energy tensor ( [ energystress ] ) .    to derive the equation of motion for @xmath5 , one can either vary the lagrangian with respect to @xmath5 or require that the covariant derivative of the stress - energy tensor vanish .",
    "this yields @xmath45 where we have introduced @xmath46 the coefficient @xmath47 determines the positivity of the kinetic term of the scalar field and thus can be used to judge whether the model contains a ghost or not at the perturbative level .",
    "the coefficient @xmath48 is an effective damping term . by keeping the first terms of the expressions of @xmath47 and @xmath48 and setting @xmath49",
    "one can recover the standard klein - gordon equation in the frw background . neglecting the other terms",
    "is a good approximation when the velocity of @xmath5 is sub - planckian .",
    "we now consider a nonsingular cosmological bouncing solution . here , we focus on homogeneous solutions .",
    "it is well known that the homogeneous trajectory of a scalar field can be an attractor solution when its potential is an exponential function .",
    "one example is inflationary expansion of the universe in a positive - valued exponential potential , and the other one is the ekpyrotic model in which the homogeneous field trajectory for a negative exponential potential is an attractor in a contracting universe . for a phase of ekpyrotic contraction",
    ", we take the form of the potential to be @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a positive constant with dimension of @xmath52 .",
    "thus the potential is always negative and asymptotically approaches zero when @xmath53 . ignoring the second term of the denominator , this potential reduces to the form used in the ekpyrotic scenario .    for initial conditions we assume that @xmath5 begins at an asymptotically large negative value .",
    "the force due to the potential induces motion towards the right , i.e. with @xmath54 . the equation of state of @xmath5 matter is determined by the parameter @xmath55 . for sufficiently small values of @xmath55 ( as will be shown shortly , the transition value is @xmath56 ) , the equation of state is such that in a contracting universe the energy density in @xmath5 increases faster than that in matter , radiation and anisotropic stress .",
    "thus , the homogeneous trajectory is an attractor .",
    "as @xmath5 approaches zero , the second term in the denominator of the potential becomes important and the field evolution departs from the ekpyrotic trajectory .",
    "since the potential is bounded from below the model has a stable vacuum state .    to obtain a nonsingular bounce",
    ", we must make an explicit choice of @xmath33 as a function of @xmath5 . as we have discussed in the previous subsection",
    ", we want @xmath33 to be negligible when @xmath57 . in order to obtain a violation of the null energy condition after the termination of the ekpyrotic contracting phase , @xmath33 must become the dominant coefficient in the quadratic kinetic term when @xmath5 approaches @xmath58 .",
    "thus , we suggest its form to be @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a positive constant defined as the value of @xmath33 at the moment of @xmath32 , which is required to be larger than @xmath61 as will be discussed later .    at this point",
    "we have fully determined the model .",
    "the potential @xmath62 and the function @xmath31 are sketched as a function of @xmath5 in figure [ fig : sketch ] .",
    "the horizontal axis is the field value @xmath5 , the vertical axis shows the values of the functions @xmath30 ( blue curve , negative - definite ) and @xmath33 ( red curve , positive - definite ) .",
    "this figure is helpful in gaining a semi - analytic understanding of the evolution , the topic we turn to in the following subsection .     and of the potential @xmath30 as functions of the scalar field @xmath5 .",
    "depending on the value of @xmath33 , the field space is separated into three regimes : the contracting phase with nearly canonical kinetic term ( large negative field values ) , the ghost condensate phase when @xmath27 which occurs at field values close to @xmath58 , and the expanding phase with canonical kinetic term ( large positive field values ) , respectively .",
    "we find that the phase of ghost condensation leads to a nonsingular cosmological bounce . ]      as initial conditions for @xmath63 ( in planck units or units of the typical mass scale in the lagrangian , whichever yields a larger time ) , we assume a nearly homogeneous universe filled with pressureless matter , radiation , and a homogeneous @xmath5 field condensate with @xmath64 which is in a contracting phase . from fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] , we see that in this phase @xmath65 and ( since the gradient of the potential also approaches zero ) @xmath66 . in this case the lagrangian for @xmath5 approaches the conventional canonical form : @xmath67 this lagrangian admits the ekpyrotic attractor solution for @xmath5 in a contracting universe : @xmath68~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which yields an effective equation of state @xmath69 where the subscript ",
    "@xmath70 \" denotes the contracting phase .",
    "consequently , long before the bounce , the energy density of the scalar field @xmath5 evolves as that of a perfect fluid with a constant equation of state @xmath71 .",
    "provided @xmath71 is the largest among the equations of state of all the matter components in the universe , the contribution of @xmath5 to the total energy density will become dominant , as is well - known in the ekpyrotic model .",
    "if @xmath72 we have @xmath73 and in this case the importance of @xmath5 increases also relative to that of anisotropic stresses , demonstrating that the model is free from the bkl instability which plagues most bouncing cosmologies .",
    "as @xmath5 accelerates towards @xmath74 , the value of @xmath33 will increase . if @xmath75 ( which we require ) , then at some point in time @xmath33 will start to exceed the critical value @xmath76 and thus the sign of quadratic kinetic term in ( [ lagrangian ] ) will become negative . at that point",
    ", @xmath5 will become a ghost condensate .",
    "the critical value of @xmath33 which signals the onset of the ghost condensate phase is @xmath77 there are two solutions of this equation which are @xmath78 the ghost condensate phase occurs for @xmath79 . during this phase the null energy condition",
    "is violated   which could occur for @xmath80 before ghost condensation sets in . ] .",
    "this allows for the existence of a nonsingular bounce .",
    "however , a nonsingular bounce also requires that the energy density vanishes at the bounce point , which implies the following relation @xmath81 at the time @xmath82 when the bounce occurs ( subscripts b refer to the bounce point ) . in our specific example , @xmath83 and thus @xmath84 and @xmath85",

    "it follows immediately that a nonsingular bounce can only occur when @xmath87 ( otherwise there exists no real solution to eq .",

    "it will cross the second boundary of the ghost condensation region @xmath88 . at that point",
    ", the lagrangian of the model recovers the canonical form and the universe enters a kinetic - driven phase of expansion . note",
    "that although the potential approaches an exponential form , the scalar field does not approach the solution analogous to ( [ phiek ] ) which would be an attractor for positive @xmath5 values in a contracting universe . in an expanding space - time , this solution is a repeller rather than an attractor .",
    "instead , the scalar field experiences a fast rolling phase with an effective equation of state the same as that of a stiff fluid : @xmath89 where the subscript ",
    "@xmath90 \" denotes the expanding phase . as a consequence ,",
    "the energy density of the scalar field @xmath5 will dilute relative to that of conventional radiation and matter and then the universe will be able to enter the phases of the usual thermal history of standard big bang cosmology .",
    "following our qualitative analytical analysis we now turn to a numerical study of the background cosmology .",
    "above , we have presented a heuristic discussion of how the null energy condition can be violated in this setup .",
    "the key issue for the numerical analysis is to analyze whether the null energy condition can be violated smoothly and without any pathologies . in our model , we make use of the idea of ghost condensation to violate the null energy condition .",

    "the null energy condition is possible , but perturbations could become very large and force the background trajectory back away from the cosmological constant boundary .",
    "in addition , there are gradient instabilities @xcite . to cure these ,",
    "we take into account the effect of the galileon operator @xmath91 .    in order to prove that the model is well - behaved throughout the entire cosmological evolution",
    ", we need to study the evolution of perturbations about the background solution .",
    "we perform the analysis of cosmological perturbation in the next section . here",
    "we will focus on the pure background dynamics .    to illustrate that a nonsingular bounce can be achieved in our model ,",

    "throughout which implies the absence of ghost instabilities in the infrared limit . ]    to conclude this subsection , we have verified that our model leads to a nonsingular bounce which is free of instabilities at the level of homogeneous and isotropic cosmology .",
    "the stability of the model towards inhomogeneities is investigated in the next section .      in recent work",
    "@xcite , steinhardt and xue raised important concerns regarding the stability of modified ekpyrotic bounces .",
    "they find that in the model @xcite the anisotropy and the shear which are damped out during the phase of ekpyrotic contraction shoot up to values larger than their initial values during the nonsingular bounce phase .",
    "in addition , they find that the adiabatic mode which is suppressed during the phase of ekpyrotic contraction but which has a deep blue spectrum increases dramatically in amplitude during the bounce phase and dominates over the entropy mode which in the construction of @xcite has a scale - invariant spectrum .",
    "as we discuss in this subsection , our model appears to be free of these problems .",
    "the model of @xcite also uses a ghost condensate construction to achieve a nonsingular bounce",
    ". however , the null energy condition - violating ghost condensate appears at small values of @xmath24 , namely for @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is some critical value . in the model of @xcite , the value @xmath108 of @xmath24 at the beginning of the ekpyrotic phase of contraction is larger than @xmath107 , and it increases rapidly during the ekpyrotic contraction by a factor @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is the number of e - foldings of modes which exit the hubble radius during the ekpyrotic phase .",
    "the relative contributions of the anisotropy and shear to the energy density decrease by this factor during the phase of ekpyrotic contraction . in order to obtain a nonsingular bounce , @xmath24 must decrease after the end of the ekpyrotic phase by an even larger factor to reach the ghost condensate phase with @xmath111 . but this implies that the anisotropy and shear will increase by the corresponding factor and will come to dominate again .",
    "a corollary of this analysis is that the bouncing phase is long compared to the maximal value of the hubble expansion rate .    in our model ,",
    "the ghost condensate is triggered not by @xmath24 decreasing , but by @xmath5 increasing to some critical value . during the bouncing phase @xmath24",
    "can remain large .",
    "hence , the bounce phase will be short on the time scale corresponding to the maximal value of the hubble constant ( this is verified in our numerical results ) , and the anisotropy and shear will not increase .",
    "thus , it appears that our model is stable towards anisotropic stress and shear instabilities .",
    "since the main idea of our model is to provide the adiabatic mode of curvature fluctuations with a scale - invariant spectrum , the concern of @xcite regarding the spectrum of cosmological perturbations does not arise .",
    "in fact , the mode which we are following is the same mode as the one which becomes dominant after the bounce in @xcite .",
    "however , in our case it has a scale - invariant spectrum which is inherited from the matter - dominated phase of contraction which preceded the ekpyrotic phase .",

    "if there is no matter and entropy generation during the bounce phase , then the universe must have originated from a contracting phase which in the far past was dominated by matter and radiation",
    ". in particular , scales which we probe today in cosmological observations are likely to have exited the hubble radius during a matter - dominated contracting phase , and those which are probed by smaller scale observations ( e.g. qso observations ) would have been exited during a radiation - dominated contracting phase .",
    "thus , it is logical to consider the spectrum of fluctuations in this context .",
    "specifically , we must compute the spectrum of fluctuations for modes which have exited the hubble radius in a pre - ekpyrotic phase of contration .",

    "we apply the definition of @xmath264 to obtain @xmath265 where the parameter @xmath266 is the physical hubble parameter at the end of matter - dominated period of contraction .",

    "it is clear that the amplitude grows approximately exponentially with cosmic time .",

    "the equation of motion for gravitational waves is similar to that of cosmological perturbations , except that the function @xmath275 is to be replaced by the scale factor @xmath40 .",
    "since the scale factor is approximately constant around the bounce point , the amplitude of gravitational waves does not jump at the bounce .",

    "<S> we present a nonsingular bouncing cosmology using single scalar field matter with non - trivial potential and non - standard kinetic term . the potential sources a dynamical attractor solution with ekpyrotic contraction which washes out small amplitude anisotropies . at high energy densities </S>",
    "<S> the field evolves into a ghost condensate , leading to a nonsingular bounce . </S>",
    "<S> following the bounce there is a smooth transition to standard expanding radiation and matter dominated phases . using linear cosmological perturbation theory we track each fourier mode of the curvature fluctuation throughout the entire cosmic evolution . using standard matching conditions for nonsingular bouncing cosmologies </S>",
    "<S> we verify that the spectral index does not change during the bounce . </S>",
    "<S> we show there is a controlled period of exponential growth of the fluctuation amplitude for the perturbations ( but not for gravitational waves ) around the bounce point which does not invalidate the perturbative treatment . </S>",
    "<S> this growth induces a natural suppression mechanism for the tensor to scalar ratio of fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we study the generation of the primordial power spectrum of curvature fluctuations for various types of initial conditions . for the pure vacuum </S>",
    "<S> initial condition , on scales which exit the hubble radius in the phase of ekpyrotic contraction , the spectrum is deeply blue . for thermal particle initial condition , </S>",
    "<S> one possibility for generating a scale - invariant spectrum makes use of a special value of the background equation of state during the contracting ekpyrotic phase . </S>",
    "<S> if the ekpyrotic phase is preceded by a period of matter - dominated contraction , the primordial power spectrum is nearly scale - invariant on large scales ( scales which exit the hubble radius in the matter - dominated phase ) but acquires a large blue tilt on small scales . </S>",
    "<S> thus , our model provides a realization of the  matter bounce \" scenario which is free of the anisotropy problem . </S>"
