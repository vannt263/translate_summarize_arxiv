    "a wealth of data@xcite exists on charge - exchange processes in soft hadronic reactions , where an initial - state proton is transformed into a final - state neutron , @xmath60 .",
    "a successful phenomenological description of these results has been obtained with the concept of the exchange of virtual isovector mesons , such as @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 , using regge theory@xcite .",
    "since the pion is by far the lightest hadron , its exchange dominates the @xmath60 transition , particularly at small values of the squared momentum transfer , @xmath64 , between the proton and the neutron .",
    "the assumption of factorization , namely that the partonic nature of a hadron is independent of the hard scattering process in which it participates , has been shown to be valid in the case of the nucleon , whose partonic structure has been probed extensively in jet - production processes as well as in deep inelastic scattering .",
    "the idea of factorization may be extended to the exchanged objects in charge - exchange reactions . under this assumption ,",
    "hard processes occurring in charge - exchange reactions , such as the production of high-@xmath65 jets , provide a means of investigating the partonic nature of the exchanged objects .",
    "charge - exchange processes have been studied in deep inelastic scattering at hera@xcite .",
    "this paper reports the first observation of the photoproduction of dijets in association with an energetic forward neutron : @xmath66 where @xmath67 denotes the remainder of the final state .",
    "the virtuality of the exchanged photon , @xmath68 , was less than @xmath69  gev@xmath70 , with a median value of about @xmath71  gev@xmath70 .",

    "these results extend previous zeus photoproduction dijet studies@xcite .",
    "the present data are compared to an inclusive sample of dijet events selected without the requirement of a forward neutron .",
    "cross sections are presented both as a function of the kinematic variables of the jet and of the @xmath60 transition .",
    "the contributions to the cross section of direct processes , where the photon acts as a point particle , and resolved , where the photon acts as a source of partons , are compared in both the neutron - tagged and the inclusive samples .",
    "in addition , the fraction of the inclusive dijet sample with a leading neutron is given as a function of the jet transverse energy ( @xmath77 ) and pseudorapidity ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "these fractions are used to study the factorization properties of the processes .",
    "the results are compared to predictions of one - pion exchange .",
    "the dijet processes under consideration here are characterized by an initial state consisting of a positron @xmath79 , and a proton @xmath80 , and a final state consisting of the scattered positron , the scattered neutron @xmath81 , and a hadronic system @xmath82 : @xmath83 where @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 are the four - momenta of the initial and scattered positron , and the proton and neutron , respectively .",
    "the process is described by four lorentz invariants .",
    "two describe the positron - photon vertex and can be taken to be the virtuality of the exchanged photon ( @xmath68 ) and the electron s inelasticity ( @xmath88 ) , defined by : @xmath89 in photoproduction , where @xmath68 is small , @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the energy of the initial ( scattered ) positron , and @xmath92 is the incident photon energy .",
    "the other two variables , which describe the proton - neutron vertex , are the fraction of the energy of the initial - state proton carried by the neutron ( @xmath93 ) , and the square of the momentum transfer ( @xmath64 ) between the initial proton and the produced neutron , defined by : @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the energy of the incident proton .",
    "the transverse momentum , @xmath96 , of the neutron is related to @xmath64 and @xmath93 by : @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the mass of the proton ( neutron ) . in the photoproduction of dijets tagged with a leading neutron ,",
    "the hadronic system h contains at least two jets : @xmath99 in @xmath100 scattering of massless partons , the fractions of the four - momenta @xmath101 and @xmath102 carried into the hard scattering by the initial - state partons are given by : @xmath103 respectively , where @xmath104 is the four - momentum of the @xmath105th final - state parton , and the approximation @xmath106 has been used .",
    "the energy fraction contributed by the exchanged photon to the production of the dijets is @xmath107 ; in regge models , where @xmath60 is the result of the @xmath61 , @xmath62 or @xmath63 trajectory coupling to the @xmath108 vertex , the corresponding contribution of the exchanged meson is @xmath109 .",
    "a further relationship is : @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the fraction of the proton energy participating in the production of the dijets .",
    "the observables @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 , defined in terms of jets , are introduced@xcite : @xmath115 where the sum runs over the two jets of highest @xmath77 in an event .",

    "two types of processes contribute to jet photoproduction @xcite : either the entire photon interacts with a parton in the target ( the _ direct _ process ) , or the photon acts as a source of partons which scatter off those in the target ( the _ resolved _ process ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : feynman ] illustrates these processes for reaction  ( [ eqn : gpn ] ) with an assumed meson - exchange contribution .",
    "the observable @xmath112 is sensitive to which type of process occurs@xcite .",
    "direct processes are concentrated at high values of @xmath112 , resolved processes at low values .",

    "the zeus detector is described in detail elsewhere@xcite .",
    "the principal components used in the present analysis were the central tracking detector ( ctd)@xcite positioned in a 1.43  t solenoidal magnetic field , the uranium - scintillator sampling calorimeter ( cal)@xcite , and the forward neutron calorimeter ( fnc)@xcite . the tracking system was used to establish an interaction vertex with a typical resolution along ( transverse to ) the beam direction of 0.4(0.1 ) cm .",
    "energy deposits in the cal were used to find jets and to measure their energies and angles .",
    "the cal is hermetic and consists of 5918 cells , each read out by two photomultiplier tubes . under test beam conditions , the cal has energy resolutions of @xmath120 for electrons and @xmath121 for hadrons ( @xmath122 in gev)@xcite .",
    "jet energies were corrected for the energy lost in inactive material ( typically one radiation length ) in front of the cal .",
    "the forward neutron calorimeter@xcite was installed in the hera tunnel at degrees and at @xmath123 m from the interaction point in the proton - beam direction , and used for the 1995 data taking .",
    "the layout of the calorimeter is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fnc ] .",
    "the fnc is a sampling calorimeter with 134 layers of 1.25  cm thick lead as the absorber and 0.26  cm thick scintillator as the active material .",
    "the scintillator is read out on each side with wavelength - shifting light - guides coupled to photomultiplier tubes .",
    "it is segmented longitudinally into a front section , seven interaction - lengths deep , and a rear section , three interaction - lengths deep .",
    "the front section is divided vertically into 14 towers , allowing the separation of electromagnetic and hadronic showers using the energy - weighted vertical width of the showers .",
    "the energy resolution for hadrons , as measured in a beam test , is @xmath124 ( @xmath122 in gev)@xcite .",
    "neutrons are easily distinguished from protons , which are deflected upwards by the beam magnets and deposit most of their energy in the top four towers of the fnc .",
    "three planes of veto counters , each @xmath125 @xmath126 , are located 70 , 78 , and 199 cm in front of the calorimeter .",
    "these counters , which completely cover the bottom front face of the calorimeter , were used offline to identify charged particles and so reject particles which interacted in the inactive material in front of the fnc .",
    "magnet apertures limit the fnc acceptance to neutrons with production angles less than , that is to transverse momenta @xmath127  gev .",

    "the @xmath64 acceptance is strongly affected by the minimum value of @xmath131 , @xmath132 .",

    "the gain of the photomultiplier tubes is obtained by scanning the fnc with a @xmath133co radioactive source .",
    "changes in gain during data taking are monitored using energy deposits from interactions of the hera proton beam with residual gas in the beam pipe .",
    "the overall energy scale is set from the kinematic end point of 820 gev by fitting proton beam - gas interaction data with energy greater than 600 gev to that expected from one - pion exchange@xcite .",
    "the zeus detector uses a three - level trigger system . at the first level , events were selected by a coincidence of a regional or transverse energy sum in the calorimeter , and at least one track from the interaction point measured in the ctd . at the second level , at least 8  gev total transverse energy , excluding the eight calorimeter towers immediately surrounding the forward beam pipe , was required and cuts on calorimeter energies and timing were used to suppress events caused by beam - gas interactions  @xcite . at the third level , a cone algorithm used the calorimeter cell energies and positions to identify jets .",
    "events were required to have at least two jets , each of which satisfied the requirement @xmath134  gev and @xmath135 , or @xmath136  gev and @xmath137 .",

    "these cuts restricted the range of @xmath68 to be less than @xmath69  gev@xmath146 , with a median value of about @xmath71  gev@xmath70 .",
    "dijet candidates were selected using the ktclus@xcite jet algorithm ( details can be found in a previous zeus publication@xcite ) .",
    "cone@xcite algorithms were also used as a check : the conclusions did not change . the jet transverse energy measured in the zeus detector",
    "was corrected as a function of pseudorapidity and transverse energy to account for energy lost in inactive material .",
    "this correction was derived from the monte carlo ( mc ) simulation described in the next section . after all cuts , the kinematic region under study is defined by : , , and .",
    "events with a leading neutron were selected from the inclusive dijet sample by requiring a large energy deposit ( @xmath147 gev ) in the fnc .",

    "[ fig : fnc ] , the geometric aperture of the fnc for neutral particles at normal incidence is centered on towers 7 and 8 .",
    "scattered protons were eliminated from the sample by requiring that the tower with the maximum energy deposit be either 6,7,8 or 9 . although both photons and neutrons produce large energy deposits in the bottom section ( towers 1 - 10 ) , the vertical spread of electromagnetic showers is much less than that of hadronic showers .",
    "photons were removed by eliminating showers with a small vertical spread ( @xmath148 cm ) . finally , neutrons that started showering in front of the fnc were removed by requiring that the scintillator veto counter farthest from the fnc had an energy deposit below that of a minimum - ionizing particle .",
    "only the farthest counter was used , to minimize false vetoes due to calorimeter albedo .",
    "showers with spreads greater than 7.5  cm were also removed since they are inconsistent with originating from a single high - energy hadron .    after these cuts , 1921 events with a neutron remained , comprising approximately 1% ( before correction for the fnc acceptance ) of the inclusive dijet sample of @xmath149 events .",

    "the conclusions are independent of the monte carlo model used for the corrections : the jet energy corrections and acceptance calculations , both inclusive and neutron - tagged , can be performed with any of the four monte carlo programs ( pompyt , rapgap , herwig , pythia ) without significant change in the results .",
    "a detailed study of the sources contributing to the systematic uncertainties of the measurements was carried out@xcite .",
    "those associated with the ctd and cal , which impact on the jet measurement , and those associated with the fnc , which impact on the neutron measurement , are considered separately .    for the jet measurements ,",
    "the uncertainties are grouped into the following classes :    * absolute energy scale of the cal : the energy scale uncertainty of the low @xmath65 cal jets used in this study is 5% , leading to an uncertainty of 15 to 20% on the cross section ; * model dependence : for the inclusive dijet cross section , the jet - acceptance correction was performed using herwig instead of pythia .",
    "for the neutron - tagged sample , the acceptance correction was changed from pompyt to rapgap .",
    "the associated uncertainties were at the 5% level ; * parton parameterization : changing the parton densities of the proton ( cteq to mrsa ) contributed an uncertainty of 0.4% ; changing the parton densities of the photon ( grv to lac1 ) 2% ; * event selection : variation of each selection cut by one standard deviation of the resolution gave uncertainties of about 5% .",
    "the main systematic uncertainties associated with the fnc were :    * absolute energy scale of the fnc : the uncertainty on the fnc energy scale is @xmath158%@xcite .",
    "this introduced a 1.5% normalization uncertainty on the cross section ; * beam - gas background : charge - exchange processes for beam - gas interactions can produce a high - energy nucleon which might overlap with a dijet event .",
    "the uncertainty in the correction of 2% is less than 1% ; * event selection : veto - counter noise ( from beam halo and calorimeter albedo ) and veto - counter inefficiencies resulted in a 2.5% uncertainty ; * angular distribution of neutrons : the acceptance of the fnc was uncertain due to uncertainties in the angular distribution of the neutrons .",
    "the uncertainty in the acceptance was estimated by using different parameterizations of the pion flux . to obtain a model - independent estimate ,",
    "the angular distribution at fixed @xmath93 was assumed to fall exponentially with @xmath130 , @xmath159 , and the acceptance and its systematic uncertainty were determined by varying the slope parameter @xmath160 as a function of @xmath93 within the limits allowed by the data@xcite .",
    "the resulting acceptance uncertainty for neutrons with energy @xmath72 gev was 5.5% ; * sensitivity of the description of the beam - line : the calculated acceptance of the fnc depends on a complete and accurate description of the proton beam - line between the interaction point and the calorimeter .",
    "both the amount of inactive material and the alignment must be known .",
    "the model was tested by comparing the fraction of neutrons in the fnc surviving the selection cuts , according to rapgap , to that observed .",
    "the discrepancy between the expected and observed fraction gave a normalization uncertainty of 6% .",
    "the dominant systematic uncertainty is that associated with the energy scale of the cal jets .",
    "the statistical errors and the systematic uncertainties were added in quadrature and are shown as error bars in the figures .",
    "the systematic uncertainty associated with the absolute energy scale is shown as a shaded band .",
    "the systematic uncertainties from the fnc give a 9% normalization uncertainty on the neutron - tagged cross section .",
    "since this uncertainty does not affect the shape of any distribution , it is not included in the figures .",
    "in addition , a normalization uncertainty of 1.5% from the luminosity determination was not included ; this is not relevant in the measurement of the neutron - tagged to inclusive event - rate ratios .",
    "the usual simulation models for hard photoproduction processes such as herwig or pythia contain a fraction of events with a leading neutron , although it is not , a priori , expected that such simulations will properly describe particle production in the proton fragmentation region . for leading neutrons produced with high longitudinal momentum and low transverse momentum , particle - exchange models may be more appropriate . in this case",
    "the lo cross section can be expressed as : @xmath161 \\label{eqn : fac}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the exchanged meson is denoted by @xmath61 , and a sum over all exchanged mesons is implied .",
    "the dijet cross section in charge - exchange photoproduction contains contributions from both the direct and resolved processes . in eq .",

    "( [ eqn : fac ] ) also holds except that @xmath175 is replaced by the dirac delta function , @xmath176 , and there is no sum over partons @xmath105 in the photon .",
    "equation  ( [ eqn : fac ] ) incorporates the assumption of factorization .",
    "in particular , the resolved cross section depends on four `` parton '' densities and a two - body scattering cross section .",
    "the kinematic variables @xmath88 , @xmath93 , @xmath177 and @xmath109 are coupled only through the @xmath178 dependence of the hard - scattering cross section , @xmath179 . a priori",
    ", the shape of the neutron - tagged jet cross sections depends on the kinematic variables of the neutron . in a complete factorization of the baryon and the photon vertices , however , the shape of @xmath177 and the jet - variable distributions would not depend either on the presence of a neutron or explicitly on its kinematic variables",
    "similarly , the energy spectrum of the neutrons would be independent of the photon and jet variables .",
    "meson - exchange models , in the context of regge theory , are often used to describe nucleon charge - exchange reactions . since the mass of the pion is small compared to all other mesons , pion exchange ( see appendix )",
    "is expected to dominate the amplitude for the @xmath60 transition , with small contributions from @xmath62 , @xmath63 , etc .",
    "in fact , lo one - pion - exchange models account for both the shape and normalization of the distributions for the neutron - tagged data .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig4](a ) compares the shape of the uncorrected neutron energy spectrum to the prediction of the one - pion - exchange ( ope ) model pompyt for the monopole and light - cone pion form - factors .",
    "the pompyt ope model with the light - cone form - factor agrees well with the measured energy spectrum .",
    "rapgap gives essentially the same prediction .",
    "the figure also shows that the monopole choice for the form factor is disfavored .",
    "it gives a distribution which is both shifted in energy and too narrow .",
    "for this comparison , the pion parton densities have been used ; however , the predicted shape of the neutron spectrum is insensitive to the choice of parton density of the pion@xcite ( not shown ) .",
    "these parton densities are constrained by dimuon and prompt - photon production data from fixed - target experiments that are sensitive mainly to the valence quark distributions , and the parameterizations are similar in the @xmath109 range studied here .    figure  [ fig : fig4](b ) shows a comparison of the shape of the neutron energy distribution with the predictions of the monte carlo programs pythia and herwig .",
    "neither simulation provides a good description of the data .",
    "moreover , pythia ( herwig ) predicts a leading neutron ( @xmath72 gev ) in 2% ( 0.5% ) of the dijet events in comparison with the @xmath180% ( after correction for the acceptance of the fnc ) observed in the data .",
    "the monte carlo models considered here do not contain an explicit diffractive component ; however , neutrons can also be produced by the diffractive dissociation of the incoming proton through pomeron exchange .",
    "monte carlo studies indicate that such neutrons will have an energy spectrum which agrees qualitatively with that observed in the data .",
    "diffractive processes give rise to a large rapidity gap between the hadronic system and the remnant of the proton , which is either a single proton or a low - mass system with the quantum numbers of the proton .",
    "the pseudorapidity of the most - forward hadron ( @xmath181 ) in the central detector was used to select diffractive events .",
    "meson exchange can also give rise to events with a large rapidity gap via the deck mechanism@xcite in which the exchanged meson itself scatters diffractively off the incoming photon and escapes undetected down the beam pipe .",
    "diffractively dissociating protons are expected to account for only a small fraction of the dijet events , both inclusive and neutron - tagged , because the @xmath65 of diffractive events is severely limited by the small fraction of the proton energy carried by the pomeron ( @xmath182% ) .",
    "in contrast , in neutron production there is on average a much larger fraction of the initial proton energy ( @xmath183% ) available for jet production .",
    "figure  [ fig : figeta](a ) shows the @xmath181 distribution for both inclusive and neutron - tagged dijet photoproduction , normalized to equal area .",
    "the shapes of the two distributions are similar .",
    "although there are differences between the two distributions at large @xmath181 , this region is insensitive to diffractive processes .",
    "less than 1% of each sample has a large rapidity gap ( @xmath184 ) .",
    "in addition , the distributions of the jet variables , @xmath77 , @xmath154 , and @xmath112 for events with a large rapidity gap@xcite are different from those of the neutron - tagged sample , which strongly resemble the inclusive sample ( see section  [ sec : factorization ] ) .",
    "pompyt and rapgap also reproduce the @xmath181 distribution of neutron - tagged events , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : figeta](b ) , although neither monte carlo contains an explicit diffractive component .",
    "neutrons can also be produced indirectly through the production and decay of baryonic resonances .",
    "most prominent of these is the @xmath185 , which is itself produced directly through @xmath61 , @xmath62 or @xmath63 exchange , and which can decay via or .",
    "monte carlo studies indicate that such decay neutrons will also have an energy spectrum which agrees qualitatively with the data ; however , the study of hadronic interactions@xcite shows that the @xmath186 contribution to the fock state of the proton is approximately half that of @xmath187@xcite .",
    "when account is taken of the branching ratio for @xmath188 , such indirect neutron production is small compared to the direct @xmath60 transition .",
    "it can therefore be concluded that standard fragmentation processes , diffractively dissociating protons , and the decay of the @xmath185 resonance are ruled out as the dominant source of dijet events tagged with a leading neutron .",
    "the data will be further compared with the one - pion - exchange model in section  [ sec : ope ] .",

    "it is therefore appropriate in this section to make further comparisons to ope under the assumption that it is the dominant mechanism for the production of the neutron - tagged events .",

    "the shape of the neutron energy spectrum is observed to be independent of both @xmath77 and @xmath112 .",

    "these comparisons suggest that the rising ratio of neutron - tagged to inclusive dijet rates as a function of @xmath112 is at least partially due to the difference in remnant - remnant interactions in the two samples .",
    "the standard photoproduction monte carlo models , pythia and herwig , fail to reproduce either the neutron production rate or the neutron energy spectrum .",
