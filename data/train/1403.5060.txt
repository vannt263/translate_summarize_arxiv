    "the fractional calculus deals with differentiation and integration of arbitrary ( noninteger ) order @xcite . it has received an increasing interest due to the fact that fractional operators are defined by natural phenomena @xcite .",
    "a particularly interesting , and very active , research area is that of the fractional optimal control , where the dynamic control system involves not only integer order derivatives but fractional operators as well @xcite . such fractional problems are difficult to solve and numerical methods are often applied , which have proven to be efficient and reliable @xcite . typically , using an approximation for the fractional operators ,",
    "the fractional optimal control problem is rewritten into a new one , that depends on integer derivatives only @xcite .",
    "then , using necessary optimality conditions , the problem is reduced to a system of ordinary differential equations and , by finding its solution , one approximates the solution to the original fractional problem @xcite .",
    "our approach is different here : after replacing the fractional operator , we consider the augmented functional and apply an euler - like method .    the text is organized as follows . in section  [ sec:2 ]",
    "we briefly recall the necessary concepts and results .",
    "our method is presented in section  [ sec:3 ] and then illustrated , with an example , in section  [ sec:4 ] .",
    "we start with some definitions needed in the sequel . for more on the subject",
