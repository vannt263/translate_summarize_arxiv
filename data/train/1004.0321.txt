    "warped extra dimensions @xcite , which have been proposed as an alternative solution to the gauge hierarchy problem , also provide a simple framework in which fermion masses are explained by the overlap of the fermion and higgs wave functions in the bulk of the warped extra dimension @xcite .",
    "having the zero mode fermions peaked at different points in the fifth dimension , the exponentially hierarchical masses of quarks and charged leptons can be obtained with a tiny hierarchy of bulk masses and all 5d yukawa couplings being of order unity @xcite . however , letting the standard model ( sm ) fermion content propagate through the bulk generally results in large contributions to electroweak precision observables , such as the peskin - takeuchi @xmath8 , @xmath9 parameters , unless the lowest kaluza - klein ( kk ) mass scale is unnaturally pushed to values much higher than a tev . to suppress these contributions , more realistic models involving a bulk custodial symmetry , broken differently at the two branes @xcite were constructed .",
    "alternatively , large brane kinetic terms were introduced @xcite . in both cases a mass of the first kk excited state as low as @xmath10(3 tev ) , is now allowed by electroweak precision data .",
    "another problem arises , this time due to the presence of non degenerate 5d bulk mass parameters , governing the localization of bulk zero modes .",
    "the non degeneracy induces new physics ( np ) contributions to flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes mediated by kk excitations of the gauge bosons and fermions , through gauge interactions in the fermion kinetic terms and 5d yukawa interactions . in the most general case , without imposing any additional flavor symmetry and assuming anarchical 5d yukawa couplings , new physics contributions can already be generated at tree level through a kk gauge boson exchange . even if an rs - gim suppression mechanism @xcite is at work ,",
    "stringent constraints on the kk scale come from the @xmath11 oscillation parameter @xmath12 and the radiative decays @xmath13 @xcite , the direct cp violation parameter @xmath14 @xcite , and especially the neutron electric dipole moment @xcite , where a mass of the first kk state of @xmath10(3 tev ) gives rise to a np contribution which is roughly twenty times larger than the current experimental bound  a cp problem in itself , referred to as little cp problem .",
    "stringent constraints on the kk scale are also present in the lepton sector @xcite . even in the absence of neutrino masses ,",
    "severe bounds arise from contributions to fcnc processes mediated by tree level kk gauge bosons with anarchical 5d yukawa couplings @xcite .",
    "it was also recently observed @xcite that the mixing between fermion zero modes and kk modes generally induces a misalignment in the 4d effective theory between the sm fermion masses and the higgs yukawa couplings .",
    "this misalignment leads to higgs mediated flavor changing neutral currents , once the fermion mass matrix is diagonalized .",
    "in particular , @xmath15 is found @xcite to produce stringent combined lower bounds on the kk gluon and the standard model higgs mass in flavor anarchic models .",
    "additional flavor symmetries in the bulk can in principle allow to partially or fully remove these constraints , by forbidding or providing a further suppression of tree level fcncs and one loop contributions induced by the presence of kk modes .",
    "one example that removes or suppresses all tree level contributions is the generalization to 5d of minimal flavor violation in the quark sector @xcite and in the lepton sector @xcite . in these settings ,",
    "the bulk mass matrices are aligned with the 5d yukawa matrices as a result of a bulk @xmath16^{6}$ ] flavor symmetry that is broken in a controlled manner . in",
    "@xcite a shining mechanism is proposed , where the suppression of flavor violation in the effective 4d theory on the ir brane is obtained by confining the sources of flavor violation to the uv brane , and communicating its effects through gauge bosons of the gauged bulk flavor symmetry .",
    "there , it is also shown that higgs mediated fcncs are eliminated to leading order , and a lowest kk scale of about 2 - 3 tev seems to be allowed , rendering the model testable at collider experiments @xcite .",
    "all above considerations suggest that a candidate for a realistic model of lepton and quark masses and mixings in a warped setup should possibly be realized with all standard model fields in the bulk , including the higgs field , a bulk custodial symmetry and an additional flavor symmetry , to avoid large new physics contributions and maintain the kk scale of order a tev . in @xcite , see also @xcite , a bulk @xmath0 family symmetry @xcite was used to explain masses and mixings in the sm lepton sector . in this",
    "setting , the three left - handed lepton doublets form a triplet of @xmath0 to generate tribimaximal ( tbm ) neutrino mixing @xcite , in agreement with the recent global fit in @xcite .",
    "in addition , tree - level leptonic fcncs are absent in this scheme .",
    "while the simplest realization of @xmath0 well describes the lepton sector , it does not give rise to a realistic quark sector .",
    "in this paper , we propose a model based on a bulk @xmath6 family symmetry , implemented in a slightly different setup , in an attempt to describe both the quark and lepton sectors . in this setup",
    "the scalar fields that transform under non trivial representations of @xmath0 , namely two flavon triplets , reside in the bulk .",
    "consequently , they allow for a complete `` cross - talk '' @xcite between the @xmath17 spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) pattern associated with the heavy neutrino sector - with scalar mediator peaked towards the uv brane - and the @xmath18 ssb pattern associated with the quark and charged lepton sectors - with scalar mediator peaked towards the ir brane . as in previous models based on @xmath0 ,",
    "the three generations of left - handed quarks transform as triplets of @xmath6 ; this assignment forbids tree level gauge mediated fcncs and will allow to obtain realistic masses and almost realistic mixing angles in the quark sector .",
    "it will also be instructive to compare this pattern to the case of larger realizations of the flavor symmetry , like @xmath19 @xcite , which are usually associated with a rather richer flavon sector .",
    "an additional feature worth to mention is the constraint on the common left - handed quarks bulk mass parameter implied by the @xmath5 best fits in our model .",
    "the numerical significance of such a constraint has been thoroughly investigated in the minimal version of rs models @xcite , and it is largely relaxed in models with ( extended ) @xmath4 custodial symmetry @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : setup ] we review the basic setup of the model and the various representation assignments .",
    "we then present a rs model with custodial symmetry and a bulk @xmath0 family symmetry , and derive the leading order results for masses and mixings . in section  [ secho ]",
    "we classify all higher order corrections , including cross - talk and cross - brane operators for leptons and quarks and parametrize their effect .",
    "section  [ findckm ] contains our numerical analysis and results . in section  [ alignment ]",
    "we discuss the vacuum alignment problem and suggest possible solutions , while in section  [ sec : fv ] we briefly discuss constraints from flavor violating processes on the kaluza - klein scale in our model .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we adopt the rs1 framework and thus assume the bulk of our model to be a slice of @xmath20 , with the extra dimension , @xmath21 , compactified on an orbifold @xmath22 with radius @xmath23 . two 3-branes with opposite tension",
    "are located at the orbifold fixed points @xmath24 , the uv brane , and @xmath25 , the ir brane .",
    "the resulting bulk geometry is described by the metric @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the @xmath28 curvature scale .",
    "the geometric warp factor sequestering the two branes generates two characteristic scales within this setup , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , the latter referred to as the kk scale ] .",
    "the electroweak scale naturally arises for @xmath31 .",
    "all matter fields of our model , fermions and scalars including the higgs field , live in the bulk and we allow for arbitrary @xmath32 orbifold boundary conditions , where @xmath33 is the reflection about @xmath24 and @xmath34 is the reflection about @xmath25 .",
    "in other words , we allow for discontinuity of the bulk profiles at the orbifold fixed points by the presence of non trivial scherk - schwarz twists @xcite .",
    "the symmetry group in our model is @xmath35 the bulk gauge symmetry @xmath36 is augmented by an @xmath6 flavor symmetry plus an auxiliary @xmath37 , whose nature and role will be explained below . in addition , the electroweak gauge group is extended to @xmath38 to incorporate custodial symmetry @xcite , and thus protect electroweak precision measurements with the lightest kaluza - klein mass being as light as @xmath39(4tev ) .",
    "this symmetry is broken down to the sm group @xmath40 on the uv brane , and down to @xmath41 on the ir brane",
    ".    both breaking patterns can be realized by orbifold boundary conditions on the gauge fields under @xmath32 as in @xcite .",
    "in particular , the complete uv breaking pattern is achieved via an @xmath42 doublet @xmath43 or a triplet scalar vev , while a bidoublet @xmath44 higgs vev induces the ir breaking .",
    "these fields can either be decoupled by taking their infinite mass limit as in higgsless models , or be dynamical and used to generate masses of quarks and leptons , as it is true in our case for the higgs field .",
    "notice also that , in our case , the bidoublet higgs field lives in the bulk and it is peaked towards the ir brane .",
    "we introduce two scalar flavons @xmath45 and @xmath46 and a higgs field transforming under @xmath47 as @xmath48 the three families of quarks and leptons are assigned to the following representations : @xmath49 where the @xmath6 notation is explained in the appendix , and the @xmath50 notation is standard .",
    "the @xmath37 assignments will be specified later .",
    "models with similar a@xmath51 assignments for leptons and scalar fields have been considered before @xcite , thus many of the leading order properties are shared with our model .",
    "notice that the right - handed neutrinos are assigned to a @xmath52 of @xmath6 , whereas the right - handed charged - fermions are each given a @xmath53 structure .",
    "it is also important to notice that we have a separate @xmath54 doublet for each right handed fermion .",
    "bulk fermions are assigned specific parities under @xmath32 , so that zero modes will provide the standard model particle content . as implied by the invariance of the 5d action",
    ", the bulk fermion field @xmath55 transforms as @xmath56 and @xmath57 , with @xmath58 , under @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "the 5d fermion corresponds to two weyl spinors of opposite chirality in 4d @xmath59 and with opposite @xmath33 and @xmath34 parities .",
    "hence , if @xmath60 has parities @xmath61 , @xmath62 has parities @xmath63 .",
    "even parity at @xmath24 or @xmath25 implies neumann - like boundary conditions on the bulk fermion profile , while odd parity implies dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "it follows that a massless zero - mode only exists for a @xmath64 weyl spinor .",
    "the bulk profile of the would - be zero mode is shaped by the fermionic bulk mass term with mass @xmath65 , and @xmath66 is the sign function .",
    "for @xmath67 ( resp .",
    "@xmath68 ) , the zero mode is exponentially localized on the uv ( ir ) brane .",
    "finally , it is important to notice that since @xmath54 is broken on the uv brane , the two components of each @xmath54 doublet must have opposite @xmath33 parities . to get a massless zero mode from both components , we thus need to double the number of doublets @xcite , and we do this for quarks and leptons . taking into account the above considerations , we assign the following boundary conditions to leptons , in the absence of localized mass terms : @xmath69\\end{array}\\right ) & \\,\\ , e_r , \\mu_r , \\tau_r=\\left(\\begin{array}{cc }   \\tilde{\\nu}_{e,\\mu,\\tau } & [ + , -]\\\\e_r,\\mu_r,\\tau_r & [ -,-]\\end{array}\\right ) & \\,\\ , \\nu_r=\\left(\\begin{array}{cc } \\nu_r & [ -,-]\\\\\\tilde{\\ell } & [ + , -]\\end{array}\\right ) \\end{array},\\ ] ] where the parities @xmath70 are given for the upper weyl spinor @xmath60 , while @xmath62 has the opposite conditions .",
    "hence , there is a left handed zero mode for each left handed doublet in @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and a single right handed zero mode in @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 each .",
    "these fields have bulk masses , in units of the ads curvature , given by @xmath77 and @xmath78 , with @xmath72 , and we work in the basis where they are real and diagonal .",
    "an important restriction is due to the a@xmath79z@xmath80 bulk global symmetry : since the three left handed lepton doublets are unified into a triplet of a@xmath51 , they will share one common @xmath81 parameter which we label @xmath82 .",
    "analogously , the boundary conditions for the quarks are chosen to be : @xmath83\\end{array}\\right ) & u_r , c_r , t_r=\\left(\\begin{array}{cc } u_r , c_r , t_r & [ -,- ] \\\\\\tilde{d } , \\tilde{s } , \\tilde{b}&[+,-]\\end{array}\\right ) & d_r , s_r , b_r=\\left(\\begin{array}{cc } \\tilde{u } , \\tilde{c } , \\tilde{t } & [ + , -]\\\\d_r , s_r , b_r & [ -,-]\\end{array}\\right ) \\end{array}.\\ ] ] in this way we have a left handed massless zero mode for the three left handed doublets in @xmath84 and a single right handed zero mode in @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 each .",
    "again , the three left handed quark doublets , being assigned to a triplet of a@xmath51 , share one common bulk mass parameter , @xmath91 .",
    "the right handed quarks are assigned to distinct one dimensional representations of a@xmath51 , hence there are 6 different bulk mass parameters entering their zero mode profiles , @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",

    "are chosen to be peaked towards the ir brane at @xmath25 , while the field @xmath46 is peaked towards the uv brane at @xmath24 , for phenomenological reasons .",

    "( [ eq : yuk ] ) has a relatively simple structure .",

    "the neutrino dirac term is governed by a single coupling constant @xmath102 and involves the higgs only , while the right - handed majorana sector contains one bare majorana mass @xmath103 , and a single yukawa coupling @xmath104 to the electroweak singlet and @xmath6 triplet @xmath46 . in total",
    "there are only twelve , a priori complex , yukawa parameters to describe masses and mixings of nine dirac and six majorana fermions .",
    "all of these parameters will be taken to be universal and of @xmath105 in the construction of sec .",
    "[ findckm ] .",
    "the lagrangian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : yuk ] ) respects an additional @xmath37 symmetry , under which @xmath84 , @xmath71 , @xmath106 and @xmath45 are odd , while all other fields are even .",
    "this non - flavor symmetry ensures that the @xmath107 invariant term @xmath108 is absent from the lagrangian .",
    "all the sm fields are identified with the 4d components of the zero modes in the kaluza - klein decomposition of the bulk fields .",
    "masses and mixings for leptons and quarks are induced by eq .",
    "( [ eq : yuk ] ) once the flavons @xmath109 and the higgs have acquired a vev .",
    "the vevs of @xmath45 and @xmath46 will be responsible for providing two distinct patterns of spontaneous symmetry breaking of a@xmath51 .",
    "the vev profiles for the scalar fields in our model are solutions of the bulk equations of motion with almost vanishing bulk mass for stabilization purposes @xcite , an ir localized quartic double well potential for @xmath45 and the higgs , and a similar term for @xmath46 on the uv brane . to leading order in @xmath110",
    ", they read @xmath111 where @xmath112 denotes the @xmath6 component .",
    "the size of the sm fermion masses is thus determined by the amount of wavefunction overlap of two zero modes of opposite chirality , corresponding to the same dirac fermion in 4d , together with the vev profiles of the corresponding scalar fields .",
    "this holds as far as the zero mode approximation ( zma ) is a good description of the 4d reduction of our model . in general",
    ", the presence of kinetic and potential boundary terms for the scalar fields will , after ssb of a@xmath51 and the electroweak symmetry , lead to boundary conditions that mix all levels of kk fermions .",
    "the light modes are however rather insensitive to the presence of these boundary terms and can be treated as a small perturbation . thus , to leading order , the low energy mass spectrum can be obtained by using the zero mode profiles of all bulk fields .",
    "the accuracy of the zma in each specific case depends on the lightness of the lowest lying kk states .",
    "since the largest mass present in our model is that of the @xmath113 quark , @xmath114 gev , the zma turns out to be as accurate as @xmath115 for the masses of the zero mode fermions .",
    "writing out the charged - fermion @xmath116 yukawa invariants of eq .",
    "( [ eq : yuk ] ) , and following the rules in the appendix , one finds that each of the three mass matrices has the form @xmath117 where the scalar profiles @xmath118 and @xmath119 are from eq .",

    "the numerical subscripts @xmath124 denote @xmath6 components , as in the appendix . for the special vev pattern of @xmath45 @xmath125 we define @xmath126 , and",
    "each of the above mass matrices translates into the effective 4d mass matrix @xmath127 where we conveniently introduced the fermion overlap function @xmath128 product of the 5d profiles for the zero modes of the fermion fields , @xmath129 and @xmath130 , with @xmath116 and the factor @xmath131 included .",
    "this shows that the left - diagonalization matrices @xmath132 for the up - quark , down - quark and charged lepton sectors , respectively , are identical and equal to the unitary trimaximal mixing matrix  @xcite , @xmath133 this diagonalization property of mass matrices is referred to as `` form diagonalizability '' @xcite ; in this case the mixing angles are independent of the mass eigenvalues .",
    "one can easily see that , at this order and due to the above @xmath6 assignments , the @xmath45 vev of eq .",
    "( [ eq : c3vac ] ) forces the ckm matrix to be the identity : @xmath134 it also induces the breaking pattern @xmath135 where @xmath136 denotes `` isomorphism '' , see the appendix .",
    "the remnant @xmath137 flavor subgroup cyclically permutes the three @xmath6 triplet basis states with no change of signs , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : ca ] ) and @xcite .",
    "the @xmath138 and @xmath139 representations transform under this subgroup in the same way they do under the full flavor group , @xmath6",
    ". we will show below that , if the remnant @xmath137 symmetry remains unbroken , the ckm matrix will remain trivial to all orders .",
    "a further breaking is thus needed in order to produce deviations of the ckm matrix from unity . in @xcite",
    "it was first suggested that such small deviations can be generated by higher - order effects , able to induce a relatively weak subsequent breaking of the residual @xmath137 flavor symmetry , i.e. @xmath140 .",
    "our main goal is to implement this idea in our setup to obtain a realistic ckm matrix , without spoiling the results that will be obtained below for the neutrino and charged lepton sector .",
    "it is for this purpose that we choose to use bulk flavons .",
    "the non vanishing overlap between the profiles of @xmath45 and @xmath46 allows for the presence of higher dimensional operators , which communicate the symmetry breaking pattern associated with @xmath141 to the quark sector , as explained in section  [ crosstalk1 ] . on the other hand , having these profiles exponentially localized on different branes , combined with the internal symmetries of the model , strongly suppresses the mixed interaction terms in the scalar potential @xmath142 , thus allowing to approximately preserve the original alignment between the vevs of these fields , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ alignment ] .",
    "this is an immediate generalization to our model of the 4d derivation in @xcite and the 5d warped model with brane localized scalars on an interval in @xcite .",
    "the neutrino dirac mass matrix is derived from the yukawa term @xmath143 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : yuk ] ) . using eq .",
    "( [ eq:33tos ] ) , the 4d dirac mass matrix turns out to be proportional to the identity matrix @xmath144 in this equation @xmath145 is the effective 4d coupling and @xmath146 is dimensionless .",

    "given that only the @xmath6 triplet part of @xmath169 will contribute , it is clear that the corrections to masses and mixings of the above operators to all orders will be identical in structure to the leading order ones .",
    "this shows that the @xmath137 symmetry in the charged fermion sector will ensure @xmath170 and thus prevent quark mixing , so that the only way to allow for a non trivial ckm matrix is to further break @xmath137 .",

    "the cross - brane interactions between @xmath45 and @xmath46 are essential in order to obtain realistic results in the quark sector .",

    "quartic and higher @xmath497 interaction terms are obviously further suppressed and lie safely below the model theoretical error , originated by the zero mode approximation .",

    "after the scale @xmath426 is set according to the experimental value of @xmath517 , we are able to tell if this perturbative expansion is justified . due to the @xmath137 preserving vev of @xmath45 and the @xmath33 preserving vev of @xmath46 , the above operators involving @xmath518 will generate the same kind of contributions as those involving @xmath519 to the ckm elements .",

    "this means that , in total , we have 4 non degenerate real parameters governing the mixing data in the quark sector , a less appealing situation than the one with a @xmath33 extra discrete symmetry , where the two complex parameters turn out to be degenerate to a good approximation .",
    "the second solution we suggest is based on the simplifying assumption that the field @xmath45 can also play the role of the higgs as in many previous works on @xmath0 @xcite .",

    "we see that the most dominant cross - talk interactions , leading to quark mixing , are of the form @xmath536 and @xmath537 , both of which give similar contributions to those described in section  [ crosstalk1 ] .",
    "consequently , we can match the ckm matrix as we already did in section  [ findckm ] .",
    "differences will stem from redefinitions of @xmath279 and @xmath426 and consequent rescaling of fermion bulk masses .",

    "a matching of an almost realistic ckm matrix by 4 real parameter assignments analogous to the one in section [ findckm ] can be performed , yet the parameter space is still larger . as already said another possible drawback of this proposal may lie in the identification of the 5d flavon @xmath45 with the bulk higgs .    we should also add that in both solutions offered above to protect the desired vacuum alignment , the @xmath539 invariant interaction terms in the scalar potential with insertions of the new fields @xmath505 and @xmath252 are irrelevant to the vacuum alignment problem , since they are both flavor singlets . further constructions with additional fields and more complicated flavor symmetries are obviously possible at the price of an increased arbitrariness of the model .",
    "all models with extra dimensions will have to face the presence of mixing between the degrees of freedom of the effective 4d theory and their kk excitations .",
    "one of the crucial tasks in the construction of these models , is thus to guarantee that corrections induced by this mixing do not spoil the agreement with observations for a natural value of the lowest kk scale of order a few tev . in other words ,",
    "once new physics ( np ) contributions induced by the exchange of the kk excitations are taken into account , the agreement with observations will force a lower bound on the kk scale , and we demand it be naturally of order a few tev .",

    "possible scenarios already described in the literature include a spontaneous symmetry breaking of a continuous flavor symmetry @xcite or having @xmath6 as a remnant spacetime symmetry of a toroidal compactification scheme of a six - dimensional spacetime @xcite .",
    "it is worth to mention two additional points .",
    "it is appealing to explore the effects of a heavier higgs in this context .",
    "some of the model predictions would get closer to the best fits for certain observables , such as @xmath5 ratios and asymmetries , allowing for a larger parameter space . however , as discussed in the literature , a heavier higgs mass in a custodial setup easily induces conflicts with electroweak precision measurements and a more careful estimate of the allowed range of values for @xmath350 should be produced in each version of the custodial setup . the final point concerns possible extensions of the warped @xmath6 model .",
    "it is interesting and phenomenologically relevant to consider the possibility to embed @xmath4 ( or other versions of ) custodial symmetry @xcite into warped @xmath6 .",
    "this would release the most stringent constraint on the model parameter space due to the @xmath5 best fits and could provide new appealing features alternative to flavor anarchic models .",
    "we thank yuval grossman and gilad perez for useful discussions .",
    "the work of a.k is supported in part by the ubbo emmius scholarship program at the university of groningen .",
    "the alternating group of order four , denoted @xmath6 , is defined as the set of all twelve even permutations of four objects and is isomorphic to @xmath9 , the tetrahedral group .",
    "it has a real three - dimensional irreducible representation @xmath52 , and three inequivalent one - dimensional representations @xmath553 , @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "the representation @xmath553 is trivial , while @xmath138 and @xmath139 are non - trivial and complex conjugates of each other .",
    "the twelve representation matrices for @xmath52 are conveniently taken to be the @xmath158 identity matrix @xmath223 , the reflection matrices @xmath554 , @xmath555 and @xmath556 , the cyclic and anticyclic matrices @xmath557 respectively , as well as @xmath558 and @xmath559 . under the group element corresponding to @xmath560 , @xmath561 and @xmath562 , where @xmath563 is a complex cube root of unity , with both representations being unchanged under the @xmath564 .",
    "the basic non - trivial tensor products are @xmath565 where @xmath566 denotes symmetric ( antisymmetric ) product .",
    "let @xmath567 and @xmath568 denote the basis vectors for two @xmath52 s .",
    "then @xmath569 in an obvious notation .",

    "<S> we propose a spontaneous @xmath0 flavor symmetry breaking scheme implemented in a warped extra dimensional setup to explain the observed pattern of quark and lepton masses and mixings . </S>",
    "<S> the main advantages of this choice are the explanation of fermion mass hierarchies by wave function overlaps , the emergence of tribimaximal neutrino mixing and zero quark mixing at the leading order and the absence of tree - level gauge mediated flavor violations . </S>",
    "<S> quark mixing is induced by the presence of bulk flavons , which allow for `` cross - brane '' interactions and a `` cross - talk '' between the quark and neutrino sectors , realizing the spontaneous symmetry breaking pattern @xmath1 first proposed in [ x.g.he , y.y.keum , r.r.volkas , jhep0604 , 039 ( 2006 ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the observed quark mixing pattern can be explained in a rather economical way , including the cp violating phase , with leading order cross - interactions , while the observed difference between the smallest ckm entries @xmath2 and @xmath3 must arise from higher order corrections . without implementing @xmath4 ( or other versions of ) custodial symmetry , the bulk mass parameter of the left - handed quarks in this model is constrained by the @xmath5 best fits , still allowing for a kaluza - klein scale below 2 tev . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we briefly discuss bounds on the kaluza - klein scale implied by flavor changing neutral current processes in our model and show that the residual little cp problem is milder than in flavor anarchic models .    </S>",
