    "the purported detection of a very massive galaxy , hudf - jd2 , at a redshift of @xmath1 by @xcite provides a critical test for the standard paradigm of galaxy formation in a @xmath5cdm cosmology .",
    "however , the lack of an unambiguous spectral identification allows this galaxy to be a @xmath6 interloper in which obscuration by dust mimics the lyman break @xcite .",
    "if the galaxy is at @xmath7 , the estimated mass of the halo containing this galaxy is @xmath8 for a reasonable star formation efficiency , @xmath9 , of @xmath10 . in the concordance cosmological model ,",
    "the expected number of such galaxies in the hubble ultra deep field ( hudf ) field - of - view is less than @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "since the expected probability of finding such a galaxy in the hudf is extremely low , its redshift identification is of great importance for testing the standard cosmological model .",
    "here we point out that , despite the low average abundance of galaxies like jd2 ( due to its large mass and high redshift ) , such a galaxy can not exist alone .",
    "the large - scale over - density implied by its existence naturally results in neighboring halos over and above what would be expected from random fluctuations in the average galaxy population .",
    "the surrounding over - dense region behaves as if it is part of a closed universe , in which the formation of all galaxies occurs earlier .",
    "we approach this problem analytically in this _",
    "paper_. in addition to the deeper fundamental understanding gained from such a treatment , the extreme rarity of objects like jd2 make a statistical analysis using numerical simulations difficult . in  [ met ]",
    ", we show how the excursion set formalism can be used to calculate an approximate probability distribution for the number of neighbors around massive galaxies .",
    "we then calculate , in particular , the expected clustering of bright galaxies around the @xcite galaxy in  [ jd2 ] , and explore the dependence of our results on the star formation efficiency , duty cycle , and power - spectrum normalization in  [ param ] . in  [ future ] , we generalize these results to other halo masses and redshifts .",
    "finally ,  [ discussion ] summarizes our main conclusions .",
    "unless otherwise noted , we assume a flat , @xmath5cdm model for the universe with the _ wmap3 _ cosmological parameters @xcite .",
    "we assume the simple model for lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) considered by @xcite , which associates lbgs with merger - activated star formation in dark - matter halos and includes suppression of the star formation efficiency in low - mass halos by supernova feedback . in the model ,",
    "the star formation duty cycle , @xmath12 , gives the fraction of halos that contain active star formation .",
    "this fraction has recently been calibrated by the measured luminosity function of lbgs at @xmath13 to a best - fit value with @xmath14 errors of @xmath15 @xcite . here",
    "we adopt a conservative value of @xmath16 , in accordance with our assumed star - formation efficiency of @xmath17 ( which matches the fraction of @xmath18 in stars today ) .",
    "the remaining fraction , @xmath19 , of halos at @xmath20 will not be detected as i - dropout lbgs and may include a population of post - starburst galaxies similar to jd2 itself . for our calculations , we assume no variation of the duty cycle over the redshift range of the selection function of the hudf .",
    "halos with active star formation do not constitute a fair sample of the total halo population .",
    "@xcite show that these halos have undergone substantial accretion in their recent past giving them an extra  temporal \" bias . while the numerical simulations by @xcite were done at @xmath21 ,",
    "there is , as yet , no analytical method to predict this extra bias at higher redshift .",
    "thus , our calculations for the number of neighboring lbgs around massive galaxies at high redshift are lower limits that could be modified in the future with a better understanding of the evolution of the  temporal \" bias with mass and redshift .    according to the excursion set prescription @xcite",
    ", if the linear density fluctuations in the universe are extrapolated to their values today and smoothed on a comoving scale @xmath22 , a point whose over - density exceeds a critical value of @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the linear growth factor at redshift @xmath25 , belongs to a collapsed object with a mass @xmath26 if @xmath22 is the largest scale for which the criterion is met , where @xmath27 is the critical density of the universe today .",
    "the critical value of the over - density , extrapolated to today from @xmath28 , is @xmath29 . for a gaussian random field of initial density perturbations , as indicated by _",
    "wmap3 _ measurements of cosmic microwave background @xcite , the probability distribution of the extrapolated and smoothed over - density , @xmath30 , is also a gaussian : @xmath31 with zero mean and a variance given by : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the linear power - spectrum of density fluctuations today as a function of wave - number @xmath34 , and @xmath35 . since equation ( [ var ] )",
    "is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath22 ( or @xmath36 ) , the smoothing scale can be uniquely specified by the variance of the over - density field smoothed on that scale .",
    "the critical threshold for collapse introduces a small correction to the probability distribution such that the distribution of @xmath30 becomes : @xmath37 the conditional probability distribution of @xmath38 on a scale specified by @xmath39 given a value of @xmath40 on a scale larger scale specified by @xmath41 is : @xmath42 using bayes theroem , the conditional probability of @xmath40 on a scale @xmath43 given @xmath38 on a smaller scale specified by @xmath44 is : @xmath45 with a constant of proportionality such that the integral of equation ( [ q21 ] ) is unity . setting @xmath46 and @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the host halo mass of a detected massive galaxy , gives the probability distribution of @xmath49 on any comoving scale @xmath50 , due to the presence of that galaxy , where @xmath51 is the radius corresponding to @xmath48 .",
    "however , the excursion set formalism calculates the collapse of objects ( a nonlinear effect ) by considering the behavior of the linear over - density field extrapolated to the present day .",
    "this method functions entirely in lagrangian coordinates ( which move with the flow ) and does not take into account how the over - density field changes in the quasi - linear regime . obviously , when a region collapses , matter is pulled in from the surrounding region to fill the void .",
    "thus , if we assume the existence of jd2 at @xmath28 , the material in the rest of the hudf at that redshift would have started outside the region earlier in the universe s history .",
    "we denote the lagrangian radius of a region as @xmath52 . early in the history of the universe , before the region begins to collapse",
    ", this radius is equal to the radius of the region in eulerian coordinates ( which do not move with the flow ) . as the region collapses , the eulerian radius shrinks , while @xmath52 remains unchanged .",
    "we denote the final eulerian radius of the region at the redshift at which it is observed as @xmath53 .",
    "the extent of the collapse depends on the magnitude of the over - density in the presence of the massive galaxy whose probability distribution we have just calculated in lagrangian coordinates .",
    "the more over - dense the region , the larger it would have to be initially to collapse to the same value of @xmath53 . similarly , a lower value of the over - density would mean that the material inside @xmath53 came from a relatively smaller lagrangian size .",
    "we would like a mapping , then , between the comoving eulerian size of a viewed region ( such as the hudf ) , and the comoving lagrangian size of the region from where the same material originated in the early universe .",
    "this can be obtained via the spherical collapse model @xcite . a spherically symmetric perturbation of lagrangian radius @xmath52 and over - density @xmath54 collapses to a sphere of comoving eulerian size @xmath53 at redshift @xmath25 given by : @xmath55 @xmath56 for a fixed value of @xmath53",
    ", there is a one - to - one relationship between @xmath52 and the value of @xmath57 that collapses @xmath52 to @xmath53 .    in the presence of a massive galaxy ,",
    "the probability distribution of @xmath58 ( in the lagrangian sphere that collapsed to @xmath53 ) can be computed by considering the possible histories of the region @xmath53 having collapsed from different possible @xmath52 s weighted by the probability of the corresponding value of @xmath57 in each @xmath52 .",
    "these weights are given by equation ( [ q21 ] ) .",
    "the resulting probability distribution of @xmath58 ( dropping the subscript l )  seen \" in a fixed @xmath53 can be expressed generally as : @xmath59 where again the constant of proportionality is set so that @xmath60 .",
    "the upper panel shows the probability distribution of the over - density @xmath58 ( extrapolated to @xmath61 ) due to cosmic variance ( eq . [ pdel ] ) in a spherical region that collapsed to the size of the hudf assuming the existence of a @xmath62 halo containing jd2 at @xmath28 .",
    "the central panel shows , for each value of the over - density , the resulting number of lbgs in halos with mass above @xmath63 expected in this region .",
    "the final probability distribution of the number of lbgs in the region above @xmath63 is plotted in the bottom panel , taking into account both cosmic variance and poisson fluctuations . ]",
    "now that we know the distribution of over - densities in which the massive galaxy sits , we can easily calculate the expected number of neighbor galaxies seen in @xmath53 in the presence of each value for the over - density , @xmath64 , and thus , the probability distribution of @xmath65 .",
    "@xcite calculate the mass function of objects in a region of fixed over - density by combining the sheth - tormen and press - schechter prescriptions in the regimes for which each best fits results from numerical simulations .",
    "given the relationship between @xmath58 and @xmath52 for a given @xmath53 , the over - density determines the lagrangian scale size .",
    "we find @xmath66 @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the sheth - tormen mass function , @xmath69 is the volume enclosed by the lagrangian radius specified by @xmath58 , and @xmath70 is the mass fraction at @xmath25 contained in halos with mass in the range corresponding to @xmath71 .",
    "the mass limit @xmath72 is the mass enclosed by a sphere of today s critical density with radius @xmath52 corresponding to @xmath58 .",
    "we ignore the probability that @xmath52 , while containing an over - density @xmath73 , might be part of a larger collapsed region with @xmath74 .",
    "this is a good assumption given the unlikely occurrence of @xmath75 on the scale of @xmath48 in the first place .    the resulting probability distribution of @xmath65 , due to cosmic variance , is given by : @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the inverse of equation  ( [ nvsdel ] ) and @xmath78 is its derivative .",
    "poisson fluctuations contribute additional variation in the actual number , @xmath79 , of neighbor galaxies .",
    "the probability , @xmath80 , of each discrete value of @xmath79 in the presence of a mass @xmath48 galaxy at high redshift is obtained by convolving a discretized version of equation  ( [ pnbar ] ) with the poisson distribution in the following way : @xmath81 where @xmath82 @xmath83 and for @xmath84 , @xmath85 , are seen as neighbors to another galaxy in a halo of mass @xmath48 , then the quantity @xmath86 is approximately the confidence by which we can rule out either the existence of a halo of mass @xmath48 or the cosmological model .",
    "we show results for neighbor i - dropouts around jd2 in the hudf .",
    "if jd2 is indeed a massive galaxy at @xmath87 , then there should be many massive galaxies visible around it .",
    "figure  [ pdist ] shows the distribution of @xmath58 given by equation  ( [ pdel ] ) inside the lagrangian patch that collapses to an angular eulerian size of @xmath88 , enclosing an area on the sky roughly equivalent to the hudf field - of - view .",
    "this angular scale corresponds to a comoving size of @xmath89 at @xmath28 , which assuming an extrapolated over - density of @xmath90 , encloses within a spherical radius a mass of @xmath91 .",
    "also shown are the expected number of neighbors inside that radius , given each value of the over - density , and the resulting probability distribution of the number of neighbors that includes both cosmic variance and poisson fluctuations .    while the hudf should be sensitive to lbgs in hosts as small as @xmath92 , the number of random galaxies expected in such hosts without correlations from jd2 is comparable to the number of excess neighbors that result from these correlations .",
    "this creates some ambiguity in detecting the excess over the background . on the other hand , while the mean number of uncorrelated lbgs in halos as large as @xmath93 is orders of magnitude smaller than the excess due to jd2 , the probability of detecting no such neighbor is not small enough for a lack of a detection to be meaningful .     the dependence of the number of neighbor galaxies on the star formation efficiency and the duty cycle assuming a fixed value of @xmath94 for the stellar mass of jd2 .",
    "the upper two panels show the mean number of neighbor lbgs at @xmath28 with a host halo mass above @xmath95 in the hudf due to the presence of jd2 and the probability of detecting none of these objects as a function of the duty cycle .",
    "the assumed one - to - one relationship between the star formation efficiency and the duty cycle given in equation  ( [ parameters ] ) is plotted in the third panel , while the lower panel shows how the host halo mass of jd2 depends on the duty cycle through its relationship to the star formation efficiency .",

    "the mean abundance of such galaxies in the absence of jd2 is much less than unity , and indeed , no such objects have been detected in the hudf @xcite .",
    "figure  [ pdist ] shows that there should be a mean of @xmath106 very bright i - dropout lbgs in hosts with masses larger than within an angular lagrangian radius of @xmath107 of jd2 , where this is a lower limit due to the fact that lbgs should be more clustered than halos @xcite .",
    "the probability , given by equation  ( [ pn ] ) , of detecting no such galaxies in this region is @xmath108 .",
    "thus , we can rule out jd2 at redshift @xmath104 with 99.7% confidence . integrating the distribution",

    "also shown is the effect on the probability of detecting no such galaxies , given by setting @xmath127 in equation ( [ pn ] ) .",
    "as shown , the effect of varying parameters on @xmath126 is only modest . when considering the range of @xmath96 errors on @xmath12 , @xmath126 varies by only a factor of @xmath128 .",
    "the correlation between the star formation efficiency and the duty cycle given by equation  ( [ parameters ] ) , causes these parameters to moderate each other s effect on the expected number of neighbors .",
    "while the value of @xmath129 varies more significantly , our choice of parameters throughout the rest of the paper gives conservative values for both @xmath126 and @xmath129 .",
    "the best - fit value of @xmath130 derived by stark et al .",
    "( 2007 ) results in an even smaller probability of detecting no bright neighbor dropouts if jd2 is at @xmath28 .      the high over - density in the region surrounding a massive galaxy at high redshift results from the large density fluctuation required to produce such a galaxy .",
    "if the over - density must reach @xmath131 on the scale corresponding to the size of the galaxy , then on a smoothing scale only a little larger , the over - density could not have been very low , since the contribution from the intervening scales is a gaussian about zero with a standard deviation much less than @xmath131 . however ,",
    "varying the normalization of the matter power - spectrum will change the standard deviation of this gaussian contribution .",
    "reducing the value of @xmath99 will decrease the contribution from these intervening scales and cause the over - density around massive galaxies to be larger .",
    "this will result in more neighboring galaxies on average and a lower likelihood of detecting none .",
    "conversely , increasing @xmath99 will boost the possible contribution from intervening scales , shift the probability distribution of @xmath58 in regions around massive , high - redshift galaxies toward lower values , and result in lower average number of neighbors and a greater chance of detecting none .",
    "we explore the dependence of @xmath126 and @xmath129 on @xmath99 quantitatively in figure  [ neigh8 ] .",
    "the behavior is just as expected .",
    "the dependence is relatively strong given the wide range of proposed values for @xmath99 .",
    "however , @xmath129 reaches only @xmath132 at @xmath133 .",
    "as new surveys continue to probe for ever larger galaxies at ever higher redshifts @xcite , it is important to generalize our results to potential future detections of other massive , high - redshift galaxies in the future .",
    "we again assume @xmath134 and calculate the expected number of neighbors as for jd2 but now allowing the mass , @xmath48 , and redshift , @xmath117 , of the halo hosting the detected galaxy to vary .",
    "figure  [ neighm ] shows the mean number of neighbor lbgs , @xmath126 , with host halo mass @xmath135 that are within an angular eulerian separation @xmath136 from a central galaxy with a host halo mass of @xmath48 situated at a fixed @xmath117 as a function of @xmath48 . while the uncorrelated , average abundance of lower mass halos is larger than that of higher mass halos , the plot demonstrates that the average number of neighbors begins to increase as a function of @xmath48 , for @xmath137 and @xmath122 above @xmath138 due to the nonlinear increase in halo clustering with mass . below this value ,",
    "the increasing uncorrelated abundance of objects with lower mass causes the number of neighbors to increase with decreasing @xmath48 . at @xmath139 ,",
    "@xmath126 decreases as @xmath48 increases in the entire range considered .",
    "the correlative effects of even a very massive halo are dominated by the uncorrelated behavior at this redshift .",

    "the probability of detecting no such neighbors , @xmath129 , is also plotted in figure  [ neighm ] .",
    "its dependence on @xmath48 is as expected ; @xmath129 increases as @xmath126 decreases .    in figure",
    "[ neighz ] , @xmath126 and @xmath129 are plotted as functions of @xmath117 at fixed @xmath48 and @xmath136 .",
    "while the plots of @xmath126 and @xmath129 increase and decrease , respectively , with increasing @xmath117 for @xmath141 and @xmath62 due to increased clustering with the detected halo , this is not indicated for @xmath142 .",
    "as shown in figure  [ neighm ] , @xmath143 at @xmath142 for all values of @xmath117 considered indicating that clustering is less important for these halos and their neighbors .",
    "this is also seen in the larger values of @xmath126 for @xmath142 compared to @xmath124 .",
    "the increase is due to an uncorrelated population of halos with mass @xmath144 . for each set of parameters",
    ", a higher value @xmath126 corresponds to a lower value of @xmath129 , as expected .",
    "we have presented a clear signature for the existence of a massive galaxy at high redshift . due to large correlations among massive halos at high redshifts , once such an object is found , it is unlikely to be alone . on the contrary ,",
    "the more massive the halo and the higher its redshift , the greater the number of neighbors it has .",
    "this signature is helpful in situations where only photometric data is available or when the spectroscopic redshift identification is ambiguous . for a galaxy of a given observed flux , the inferred halo mass increases as its suggested redshift increases .",
    "it therefore becomes easier to rule out a higher - redshift hypothesis , using dropout techniques to locate the neighboring lbgs that are expected at a similar redshift .",
    "we derived a probability distribution for the number of neighbors around a massive galaxy at high redshift , which led to calculations of the mean number of such neighbors and the probability of detecting no such halos .    in the case of jd2 ,",
    "the number of neighbor galaxies observed in this way can distinguish between the @xmath104 interpretation of @xcite and that of a galaxy at @xmath111 @xcite . if at @xmath28 , the mean number of excess i - dropouts in the hudf with z - band magnitudes less than @xmath105 is predicted to be @xmath106 . the lack of such bright i - dropouts in the hudf @xcite implies that jd2 can not be at such high redshift with @xmath145 confidence .",
    "thus , future detections of massive galaxies at high redshift could be verified by looking for bright , massive neighbors .    additional research into exactly how lbgs form in dark matter halos and",
    "how biased they are compared to these halos would firm - up the predictions for the probability distribution of neighbors .",
    "such work would undoubtedly include various feedback processes and environmental effects on lbg formation .",
    "previous study indicates that lbgs are more clustered than dark matter halos @xcite , and our results for the number of neighbors are , thus , lower limits on the true values .",
