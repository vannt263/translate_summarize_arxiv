    "<S> [ ptb ]    local_eq.eps    in summary , our findings suggest that the evolution leading to a smooth  rare event is smooth : the continuous diffusion @xmath144 , makes an enduring high frequency perturbation highly unlikely . </S>",
    "<S> indeed we show that even when the evolution leading to the rare event is restricted to profiles involving just a few modes , good quantitative agreement with the exact large deviation may be found . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the large deviation is well - described in a space involving just a few variables .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we note that in general the action may have more than a single local minimum , an effect which is well - known in finite - dimensional systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while this does not happen in the well - known models used above in our comparisons , it does in fact exist in other models , and can be studied using the numerical method described here by considering various different final - state trajectories . </S>",
    "<S> for example , when two solutions are present , different choices of final - state trajectories will lead to the different local minima @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed account of this issue and its physical implications is beyond the scope of the present work , and will be disscussed elsewhere @xcite .    </S>",
