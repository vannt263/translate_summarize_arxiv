    "although the standard model ( sm ) has been tremendously successful in describing the physics of the electroweak interactions @xcite , it is quite possible that it is only an effective theory which at higher energies will break down as the deeper structure of the underlying physics emerges .",
    "there are reasons to believe that the deviation from the standard model might first appear in the interactions involving the third - generation fermions@xcite .",
    "the large value of the top quark mass@xcite , on the order of the fermi scale , means that the top quark couples significantly to the electroweak symmetry - breaking sector .",
    "considerations of `` triviality '' @xcite and `` naturalness '' @xcite suggest that the scalar sector of the full theory may be more complicated than the one in the standard model .",
    "if so , the higgs sector of the sm may be described by an effective theory which will most likely induce new physics interactions for the third - generation fermions .",
    "in fact , there are subtle deviations from standard model predictions for measurements involving the @xmath2-quark on the @xmath1 resonance @xcite , which , if they persist , could be an indication of new physics beyond the standard model .    in this paper",
    "we examine the new physics effects on @xmath0 production at the @xmath1 resonance and its implications for lep2 in terms of an effective lagrangian . specifically , we focus on a class of cp - conserving dimension - six operators which can contribute to @xmath3 , and which involve a derivative coupling",
    ". such operators in principle can be detected at lep1 and the slc , and their influence will increase at higher energies .",
    "we determine the limits on the operators which contribute to @xmath4 from the precision data at lep1 and the slc , and from partial - wave unitarity considerations .",
    "we find that the data slightly favors nonzero values of the anomalous couplings .",
    "then we determine the range of possible measurements at lep2 allowed by these constraints , and show how one might determine which operators are present if deviations from sm predictions are observed at lep2 .",
    "there are two kinds of effective lagrangians used in the literature to describe the new physics of the top quark . in the so - called linear realization ,",
    "an explicit higgs doublet of the sm is included and electroweak symmetry breakdown is assumed to be induced by the higgs potential as in the sm . in this effective lagrangian ,",
    "the leading terms are given by the sm and the corrections which come from the underlying theory beyond the sm are described by higher dimension operators .",
    "so the sm will be recovered in the limit @xmath5 and the mass of the higgs boson is constrained by the `` vacuum stability '' @xcite and `` triviality '' @xcite arguments . in the second common approach , the effective lagrangian with a non - linearly realization of the sm symmetry , one constructs non - linear fields from the fermions , such as the top quark , and the would - be goldstone bosons which give masses to the w and z bosons . without an explicit higgs doublet in the model , electroweak symmetry breakdown in the nonlinear realization is generally assumed , but no specific mechanism needs to be given . in this effective lagrangian",
    "the leading terms are again the sm , and the corrections , which come from the underlying theory responsible for the symmetry breaking and mass generation , are described by higher dimension operators and also by dimension-4 operators , which is @xmath6 from the linear realization of the effective lagrangian . a higgs field , as a singlet scalar ,",
    "can be easily added to the lagrangian , but its couplings to the matter fields will not be constrained by the mass of the latter .",
    "in this paper we take an effective lagrangian with a linear realization of the sm symmetry . in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , the higher dimension operators which involve fermions of the third generation , gauge bosons , and higgs bosons and which conserve cp are given .",
    "here we will restrict the list of the higher dimension operators to those which lead to changes in @xmath4 ( since these are accessible on the @xmath1 resonance ) and involve a derivative coupling .",
    "these operators are @xmath7 .",
