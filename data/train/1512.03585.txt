    "binary stars are frequent in the universe , composing approximately 50% of main sequence stars ( abt 1979 ; duquennoy & mayor 1991 ; raghavan et al . 2010 ) . due to inherent difficulties in monitoring the radial velocities of multi - star systems ,",
    "these have not been primary targets in exoplanet surveys ( eggenberger & udry 2010 ) .",
    "still , at least 10% of the currently known extra - solar planets are hosted in binary stars ( roell et al . 2012 ) .",
    "the gravitational perturbations of a binary star can drastically influence the motion of planetary systems .",
    "the dynamical stability of planets in such environments depends strongly on the orbital and physical parameters of the system ( rabl & dvorak 1988 ; holman & wiegert 1999 ; pilat - lohinger & dvorak 2002 ; morais & giuppone 2012 ; andrade - ines & michtchenko 2013 ) .",
    "the dynamical effects of the perturbation due to a secondary star can also affect the planetary formation , and even though many studies on this subject have been made ( nelson 2000 ; boss 2006 ; haghighipour 2006 ; nelson & kley 2008 ; thbault et al .",
    "2009 ; giuppone et al .",
    "2011 ) , recent theories still struggle to explain how giant planets can be formed so close to the stability boundary in close binaries ( thebault 2011 ; mart & beaug 2012 , 2015 ; silsbee & rafikov 2015 ) .",
    "nevertheless , secular perturbations rule the dynamics of many of these subjects .",
    "giuppone et al .",
    "( 2011 ) showed that the planet formation appears more favorable in orbital configurations corresponding to the secular stationary solution . during the later stages of the formation ,",
    "michtchenko & rodrguez ( 2011 ) showed that the migrating planets tend towards stationary configurations , independent of the specific migration mechanism .",
    "andrade - ines & michtchenko ( 2014 ) studied the orbital stability of the secular stationary solution . for the particular case of the habitable zone of the @xmath1 centauri binary system",
    ", they also showed that , for orbits close to the secular stationary solution , the variation of the orbital distance to the central star is comparable to that suffered by the earth despite the strong perturbations of the companion star .    due to high eccentricities and larger perturbing masses usually found in close binary systems , the classical secular theories based on the laplace expansion of the disturbing function ( _ e.g. _ brouwer & clemence 1961 ) are of limited use .",
    "an alternative approach is the use of the legendre expansion of the disturbing function ( heppenheimer 1978 ; ford et al .",
    "2000 ; georgakarakos 2003 , 2005 ; laskar & bou 2010 ) . even though this expansion has a larger radius of convergence in terms of the eccentricity , it has a slow convergence rate with respect to the semimajor axis ratio , and is thus usually applied only in hierarchical systems .",
    "another possible approach is the construction of a semi - analytical model ( e.g. michtchenko & malhotra 2004 ) , as applied by andrade - ines & michtchenko ( 2014 ) . in this case , the averaging over short - period perturbations is performed numerically over the exact expression of the disturbing function , resulting in a model with no constraints in eccentricities or semimajor axis .",
    "however , the procedure is still limited to first - order averaging theories ( giuppone et al . 2011 ; andrade - ines & michtchenko 2014 ) . still in the planetary case , libert & sansottera ( 2013 ) developed an analytical second - order in the masses secular model using laplace coefficients , up to a high degree in the eccentricities .",
    "their model displayed a significant improvement over the first - order model in comparison with the integrations of the exact equations of motion of extra - solar planetary systems , specially close to mean motion resonances .",
    "the development , however , was explicitly displayed only for the @xmath2 andromedae system .    a second - order ( in the masses )",
    "coplanar analytical secular model was developed for the @xmath0 cephei binary system , by giuppone et al .",
    "( 2011 ) using a legendre expansion of the disturbing function .",
    "using lie - series canonical perturbation theory and considering the restricted case ( when the gravitational effects of the planet over the binary stars were neglected ) , the authors constructed an analytical model that was able to match numerical integrations , at least for initial conditions close to the observed planet .",
    "however , the authors also have emphasized that their full model was overly complex and preferred the use of empiric corrections specific for the @xmath0 cephei binary system .",
    "due to the difficulty of constructing and implementing a second - order model , it is of the utmost interest to determine for which orbital configurations the first or second - order models are applicable .",
    "the aim of this paper is to develop a general approach for the second - order coplanar secular model and determine the regimes of applicability of the first- and second - order secular models .",
    "the limits of applicability will be evaluated in the space of parameters of the problem for planets in s - type orbits ( dvorak 1984 ) , comparing the predictions of each analytical model with direct numerical integrations of the exact equations of motion .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "section [ analytical ] presents the analytical foundation of this work , with the expansion of the disturbing function and the application of a canonical perturbation theory for the construction of the first- and second - order secular models .",
    "section [ num_sim ] presents a numerical method to obtain the main features of the mean secular motion from direct n - body simulations .",
    "a comparison between different analytical models and numerical integrations is presented in section [ compare ] .",

    "similarly , @xmath40 are the newcomb operators and @xmath41 and @xmath42 are ( respectively ) the mean anomaly and eccentricity of the @xmath18th orbit . introducing ( [ hansen1 ] ) into ( [ perturbadora5 ] ) we obtain @xmath43 } , \\end{array } \\label{perturbadora10}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 in this last expression we have denoted @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .    the newcomb operators can be obtained using recurrence relations ( hughes 1981 ; ellis & murray 2000 ) , although this calculation can be extremely costly in cpu time .",
    "the good news is that @xmath49 are independent of both initial conditions and the parameters of the system and need only be calculated once .",
    "we calculated the coefficients @xmath49 for every value of the set @xmath50 , truncating the series expansion of the disturbing function considering values of the indexes in the range @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "we verified that the error caused by this truncation is of the order of the numerical error when comparing the integration of the complete equations of motion of the hamiltonian to the exact problem for any orbit with @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "therefore , this truncation guarantees that any difference between the results of the secular models and the numerical simulations of the exact problem will be only due to the averaging theory adopted in the parameter range @xmath54 and @xmath55 , as we discuss in section [ app_limits ] .",
    "the advantage of this method is that the factor @xmath49 is calculated just once and then can be applied to any system with @xmath54 and @xmath55 by just reading a file of @xmath56 lines .",
    "we re - indexed our sum with respect of the line @xmath16 of that file and we reordered the lines of the file with respect to the magnitude of the term @xmath57 , for @xmath58 and @xmath59 ( for more details see appendix [ coef_num ] ) .",
    "this allows us to rewrite the disturbing function as @xmath60    where we introduced @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63,@xmath64 and @xmath65 with respect to the new index @xmath16 .",
    "the calculated coefficients of the disturbing function are available as an electronic supplementary material , with the files description presented in appendix [ coef_num ] .      to construct our secular model we applied hori s perturbation theory ( hori 1966 ; see also ferraz - mello 2007 ) to eliminate the short - period terms associated to the mean anomalies .",
    "in the particular case when @xmath66 , the mean motions of both bodies @xmath67 and @xmath68 are of different orders of magnitude and only one of the fast angles has to be eliminated .",
    "however , in the general case when @xmath68 is of the same order of @xmath67 , we should eliminate both the fast angles .",
    "our set of canonical variables is given by    @xmath69    where @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "at this point , we notice that the disturbing function ( [ perturbadora11 ] ) does not depend on @xmath73 . therefore its conjugated action @xmath74 ( _ i.e. _ the total angular momentum ) is a constant of motion and the problem can be reduced to three degrees - of - freedom .    from ( [ hamiltonian1 ] ) , ( [ hamiltonian2 ] ) and ( [ perturbadora11 ] ) , and introducing the definition of @xmath75 , the complete hamiltonian can be written as @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 and @xmath79 taking the real part of ( [ variables5 ] ) and introducing the keplerian terms into the sum as the terms with @xmath80 and @xmath81 by defining the coefficients @xmath82 and @xmath83",
    ", we obtain @xmath84      the first step in the application of hori s method is to reorganize the terms of the hamiltonian , separating the integrable part ( function only of the actions ) , the secular part ( function of the actions and the secular angle @xmath85 ) and the short - period part ( function of all variables ) .",
    "we rearranged the terms of the disturbing function such that :    * for @xmath86 , all the terms have no angular dependence , that is , @xmath87 ; * for @xmath88 , all the terms depend only of the angle @xmath85 , that is @xmath89 and @xmath90 ; * for @xmath91 , all the other terms .    finally , for the small parameter of the problem , we adopted @xmath92    this choice for @xmath93 allows the perturbation theory to be applied even to the case where the mass of the perturber @xmath5 is larger than the mass of the central body @xmath3 , provided that @xmath94 is small enough .",

    "therefore , a fixed point in the secular ( averaged ) problem will correspond to a quasi - periodic orbit in osculating elements with frequencies @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "determining such a quasi - periodic solution from n - body simulations can be a challenging task .",

    "( 2008 ) and later by couetdic et al .",
    "( 2010 ) based on frequency analysis of the numerical integration ( laskar 1990 ; michtchenko et al .",
    "this method has proved to be very efficient and yields accurate results .",
    "its main steps are summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "numerical integration of an orbit for a given set of initial conditions ; 2 .   harmonic decomposition of the time series of the orbital elements to determine the fundamental frequencies ; 3 .",
    "quasi - periodic decomposition of the time series in function of the fundamental frequencies ; 4 .",

    "determination of a new set of initial conditions from the time series of the orbital elements with @xmath188 suppressed .",
    "this process is iterative in nature , with each new set of initial conditions being closer to the solution and the convergence is generally fast , reducing the amplitudes of the secular components by 2 orders of magnitude in just 4 steps ( couetdic et al .",
    "2010 ) .    in order to identify all the 3 frequencies of motion with the harmonic decomposition",
    ", the integrations must be long enough to include at least one secular period .",
    "moreover , the integration step must be small enough such that the keplerian period of the planet is identifiable .",
    "for the present work , we used the _ naff _ ( laskar 1999 ) algorithm for the harmonic decomposition , with a time step of @xmath189 and a total time of integration of @xmath190 , where an approximate value for @xmath166 was adopted following ( [ hepp6 ] ) .",
    "since we expect the real secular frequency to be different from that estimated from first - order models , we used a total integration time at least 6 times the approximate secular period .",
    "the iterative process was stopped whenever the relative difference between the initial eccentricities of the planet in two consecutive iterations was smaller than @xmath191 .",
    "once the initial conditions of the quasi - periodic orbit were determined , the forced eccentricity was estimated by @xmath192    with the secular frequency @xmath188 obtained at the quasi - periodic decomposition step of the last iteration of the method .",
    "the method described above provides an accurate approximation of the fundamental frequencies as long as the trajectory satisfies two conditions : ( i ) is regular ( i.e. not chaotic ) , and ( ii ) is not dominated by mean - motion resonances ( mmrs ) . if one of these conditions is met , then the quasi - periodic secular approximation is no longer valid and the iterative process will not be convergent . even though these cases are not covered by the secular models ,",
    "the analysis of these orbits is important in order to compare the predictions of the analytical models with n - body simulations .",
    "applying the quasi - periodic decomposition method in an unstable or a resonant orbit will lead to an inaccurate determination of the fundamental frequencies that will compromise the convergence of the method .",
    "for this reason , it was imposed in the algorithm that if the convergence condition was not satisfied in 20 steps , the orbit would go through a stability check .",
    "the stability of the orbits was numerically estimated by determining the proper mean motion of the planet @xmath67 with a quasi - periodic decomposition routine ( robutel & laskar 2001 ) : the analysis of the first two thirds of the data defined a value @xmath193 for the mean - motion , while the last two thirds of the data was used to calculate a second value @xmath194 . if the difference @xmath195 was found to be greater than @xmath196 , the orbit was considered unstable and the algorithm issued fictitious values of @xmath197 and @xmath198 .",

    "in contrast , the secular frequency predicted by heppenheimer s model shows no dependence with @xmath104 .",

    "even so , as indicated by the black crosses in figure [ ecte1 ] , the secular dynamics of a few known planetary systems may be well described by this simple analytical model .",
    "the second - order model has a larger region of applicability , reaching approximately twice the range in @xmath176 for a given binary companion .",
    "figure [ mcte1 ] shows that , for a fixed value for the mass ratio , the influence of @xmath105 on the limits of applicability of the analytical secular models is mostly due to the stability boundary ( area in magenta ) .",
    "for example , we can see at the bottom plane , with @xmath246 , that the applicability limits are approximately constant as function of @xmath105 .",
    "more details of this feature will be discussed in section [ families ] .",
    "figure [ ecte1 ] shows that the white region is larger for lower values of @xmath105 . for the case @xmath247",
    ", we can see a white region even for the mass ratio @xmath248 , and , as the mass ratio gets larger , the white region also gets wider .    both figs .",
    "[ ecte1 ] and [ mcte1 ] show that the only case that there is a white region above the curve in black is for the case @xmath249 .",
    "however , we must remember that the disturbing function was developed to describe precisely systems with @xmath250 ( section [ dist_func ] ) .",
    "therefore , this difference may be due to the inadequate development of the disturbing function for this case specifically , even though we can see that the models are applicable to most of the space of parameters .    for the cases where @xmath251 we can see that the regions in white are always located above the curves in black , which indicates that , in fact , these are regions strongly influenced by the short - periodic terms .",
    "as it was discussed in section [ sec_ef ] , this is a strong evidence that the regions in white should be able to be properly described by extending the perturbation theory to third or higher order .",
    "we can see as well that there is a large portion of the green regions that are located above the curves in red .",
    "this indicates that the width of the first detected mmrs are narrow enough such that the dynamics in their neighborhood is still strongly secular . at this point",
    ", it is also worthy emphasizing that the stability limits presented in both figs .",
    "[ ecte1 ] and [ mcte1 ] were calculated for coplanar systems with @xmath104 close to the stationary solution and for the initial values of the angular variables at 0 .",
    "all these regions were located above the curves in red , therefore mmrs could play a meaningful part in the system dynamics such as to form stability islands for higher values of eccentricity in the space of parameters .",
    "andrade - ines & michtchenko ( 2014 ) shows as well that there is a very high dependence to the planetary initial eccentricity and inclination to the plane of the binaries in the system dynamics and stability .      figure [ ex_familias ] shows the families of forced eccentricities ( left panels ) and secular frequencies ( right panels ) for zero - amplitude secular solutions as function of the semimajor axis ratio @xmath176 .",
    "these were calculated for @xmath237 , @xmath223 , @xmath224 au , @xmath227 and three different values of @xmath105 . within each plane",
    "we also varied the mass ratio between the secondary and central star .    , the middle panels for @xmath252 and the bottom panels for @xmath253.,scaledwidth=98.0% ]    for the forced eccentricities , the second - order secular model yields very accurate results in the case @xmath248 , even for large values of @xmath105 and @xmath176 .",
    "thus , this theory appears very reliable in systems orbiting the larger of the binary components . for equal mass binaries ( @xmath254 ) , the precision of the analytical model",
    "is restricted to smaller values of the semimajor axis , especially for binaries in more circular orbits .",
    "finally , less accurate results are obtained for @xmath246 , indicating that our theory has limited applicability in systems where the planet orbits the less massive star .    for the secular frequencies ( right - hand panels ) ,",
    "the second - order model presents a good approximation to the exact solution in all cases , even in the case of planets orbiting the less massive star .",
    "the first - order frequencies , however , are only reliable for small values of semimajor axis .",
    "the difference in values of @xmath166 between both models can reach up to a factor two , depending on the parameters of the system .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that , while the general behavior of @xmath166 of the different models is scaled by the semimajor axis ratio , the values of the secular frequencies will depend on the individual values of @xmath207 and @xmath255 .",
    "the secular frequencies will also depend on the initial value of the planetary eccentricity @xmath104 , as was discussed in section [ num - secular_frequencies ] .",

    "planet @xmath300 , however , is located in the borderline region between the blue and green regions , which means that depending on the accuracy desired for the study , a second order approach may be necessary ; * @xmath0 ceph ab - located in the boundary between the blue and green regions , again indicating that a second - order approach may be necessary .",
    "this system also presents a low osculating eccentricity ( @xmath301 ) , very close to the forced value @xmath167 . due to the large perturbations from the binary companion ,",
    "the origin of this planet has been subject of many studies ( thbault et al .",
    "2004 ; giuppone et al .",
    "2011 , among others ) .",
    "a second - order secular theory has been proved necessary in analytical studies ; * hd 196885 ab - located in the green region , this is another system for which a second - order model is necessary .",
    "the planet is located close to the mmr region , and perhaps high - order resonances could play should be taken into consideration .",
    "the dynamical evolution of the system and constraints to the orbital parameters have been focus of several works ( giuppone et al .",
    "2012 ; satyal et al .",
    "2014 ) ; * @xmath1 cen bb - even though its existence is still under debate , the planetary candidate is located in the blue region and a first - order model is adequate to describe its secular dynamics .",
    "however , studies of the planetary formation around the b star , such as thbault et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , suggests a non - linearity of the eccentricity of putative planetesimals located at larger values of @xmath207 , whose dynamics would require a second - order model ; * gl 86 ab - due to difficulties of determining the orbital parameters of the binary ( farihi et al .",
    "2013 ) , this system possesses a high indetermination of the semimajor axis and eccentricity of the binary .",
    "nevertheless , in both cases the system is properly described by a first - order secular theory ; * hd 126614 ab - located in the boundary between the blue and green regions , once again indicating the necessity of a second - order approach .",
    "also , this system is very closely located to the mmr region , which would means that high - order resonances could play an important role in its dynamical evolution .",
    "in this work we showed the importance and influence of high - order averaging theories in the study of s - type planetary orbits around tight binaries . to be assured that any difference that could arise with respect to simpler models would be only due to the averaging method itself ,",
    "the disturbing function was expanded to high orders in semimajor axis ratio and eccentricities guaranteeing a precise representation for @xmath302 and @xmath55 .",
    "we then used this expansion for the construction of a second - order secular model applying a lie - series canonical perturbation technique .",
    "the basic properties of the secular dynamics are characterized by two quantities : the forced eccentricity @xmath257 and the secular frequency @xmath258 .",
    "we defined and applied a geometric method ( section [ sec_ef ] ) to determine these quantities from a general secular hamiltonian function .",
    "we showed that these can also be accurately obtained from n - body simulations with the aid of an iterative algorithm based on a quasi - periodic decomposition given by a frequency analysis method .    to compare the families of stationary solutions obtained from the secular models to those obtained from the n - body code",
    ", we introduced characteristic limits that define the applicability domain of each analytical theory .",
    "we calculated these limits to a large grid of parameters and constructed parametric planes that show , for any given system , whether it should be studied with a first , a second or higher - order model .",
    "these parametric planes also yield information concerning its orbital stability , the influence of mmrs on its dynamics and the magnitude of short - period oscillations .",
    "we then applied these parametric planes to several real examples , including confirmed , candidates and contested planets in binary star systems .",
    "these planes show that there is always a region in the space of parameters that can be properly described by the first - order model for @xmath303 and @xmath304 .",
    "we also conclude that the second - order model is adequate up to higher values of @xmath176 , but there is still a region that can not be properly described , specially for lower values of @xmath105 and larger values of @xmath305 .",
    "we believe this region ( white area in the parametric planes ) should be properly described with a third or higher - order models . however , in many other cases , the limit of applicability of the second - order model coincides with the limit of orbital stability , indicating that higher - order models are unnecessary and will not improve the existing results .",
