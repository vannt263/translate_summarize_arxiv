    "first , for a given sample geometry and sensor placement ( in our case , a right rectangular prism with hall bars placed along one face ) , one must calculate the relationship between the intrinsic susceptibility and the measured hall voltage using maxwell s equations and coulomb s law for magnetic poles , and implemented by using finite element methods such as those of pardo _ et al .",
    "second , a calibration of the absolute value of the susceptibility must be obtained by comparing with measurements on a bulk sample for which the intrinsic susceptibility can be easily measured or calculated . in our case , for example , we used squid - based measurements in zero transverse field of the @xmath3 obtained from bulk measurements as a function of aspect ratio extrapolated to the value for an infinitely long sample , as described earlier @xcite .",
    "these steps provide a relationship that allows us to convert between the @xmath3 and the @xmath112 .",
    "the relationship can then be used to correct for the demagnetizing effect by extension where appropriate . in our case ,",
    "the parameters and the relationships that were obtained by a simple analysis using electromagnetic theory in the absence of transverse field were then assumed to be unaltered in the presence of transverse magnetic field , enabling us to correct ( by extension ) for the demagnetization effect ( to obtain @xmath3 from @xmath112 ) in a field .",
