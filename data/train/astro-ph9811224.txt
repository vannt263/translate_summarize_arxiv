    "galaxy evolution is strongly influenced by the environment .",
    "the galaxy morphology is related to the density of its environment ( dressler 1980 ) and , in the case of galaxy clusters , elliptical galaxies are more common than spirals with respect to the field . if we look to distant clusters we detect some evolution effects as butcher - oemler effect ( 1984 ) or a variation in the morphological content with the redshift ( dressler et al . , 1997 ) .",

    "the part of the galaxy spectrum seen by each isocam filter is a function of the redshift ( k correction ) .",
    "the galaxy spectrum is the sum of three different components : uibs , warm dust and forbidden lines of ionized gas . in the case of nearby clusters ,",
    "the lw3 band is centered on the warm dust emission and the lw2 band is dominated by the contribution of the uibs .",
    "when we consider distant clusters ( @xmath6 ) , the lw3 band is more and more contaminated by the uibs , while in the lw2 band the contribution of the stellar continuum , especially from old population stars , overtakes the uib features ( see fig .  [",

    "we detect a spatial segregation in the distribution of isocam sources .    in the a1689 field ( fig .",
    "[ fig : a1689-images ] ) we can remark an overdensity of lw2 sources in the cluster center , while lw3 sources seem to avoid the central region . there are more detections associated to the dust ( lw3 band ) in the outskirts than in the central region , likely because galaxies which are far from the cluster center are generally more active than central galaxies ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : a1689-dens ] ) .",
    "if we compare the distribution of colors for the galaxies ( gudehus & hegyi 1991 ) with the analogous distributions for galaxies detected in the two bands ( fig .",
    "[ fig : a1689-colors ] ) , we note that these distributions do not differ significatively , as in the case of isocam observations of the hubble deep field ( aussel et al .",
    "this shows that the activity unveiled by the mid - infrared images is hidden in the optical , corroborating the observation of the antennae galaxy by mirabel et al .",

    "[ fig : j1888-dens ] ) .",
    "this effect could be due to a more intense activity of galaxies or to a favored detection of arclets at 15 @xmath0 m as in the case of a2390 ( altieri & al , 98 ) .",
    "for the cluster gho 1603 + 4313 at @xmath7 we find an uniform distribution for the lw2 band and an overdensity of galaxies at the cluster center for the lw3 band ( fig .",
