    "improved ground based instrumentation and especially the use of @xmath6 have shown a widespread presence of central dark objects of @xmath7 , most likely supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) , at the center of spheroids ( bulges and early - type galaxies ) in the local universe ( magorrian et al .",
    "1998 , van der marel 1999 , gebhardt et al . 2003 ) . a possible relationship between these galaxies and the relics of the `` quasar era ''",
    "has therefore been suggested ( richstone et al .",
    "1998 , yu and tremaine 2002 ) .",
    "most nearby nuclei , though , are radiatively quiescent or exhibit low levels of activity . for example , in terms of the eddington luminosity , while @xmath8 in powerful agns , @xmath9 in sgra@xmath10 ( yuan et al .",

    "1997 ) only @xmath13% of the nuclei show line emission that could be explained by accretion .",
    "this radiative quiescence represents one of the most intriguing aspects of smbhs in the local universe ( as already recognized by fabian and canizares 1988 ) . at the same time",
    ", correlations have been discovered involving the smbh masses ( @xmath0 ) and global properties of their host galaxies , as the central stellar velocity dispersion @xmath14 ( gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 , ferrarese and merritt 2000 ) .",
    "these observational facts have led to think that the birth , growth and activity cycle of smbhs and the evolution of their host galaxies are tightly linked .",
    "however , it is still under study how the tight correlations were established , whether the radiative quiescence is linked to the mechanism responsible for the @xmath15 relation , and why and how the luminous agns switched off ( e.g. , haiman et al .",
    "2003 ) .    in this work",
    "the question of why local smbhs are not bright is addressed .",
    "the answer is not in a different value for @xmath0 , since the respective smbh masses of distant agns and local nuclei cover roughly the same range ( ho 2002 ) .",
    "it could then reside in a low mass accretion rate @xmath16 , or in a low radiative efficiency , or in the existence of activity cycles .",
    "the most promising solution among these is here looked for by collecting three quantities that play a fundamental role in this problem ( the nuclear emission , @xmath0 and @xmath16 ) for a sample of galactic nuclei in the local universe , and by searching for possible relationships among them .",

    "1997 ) it has become possible to get a clean look at the faint nuclear emission that may be associated with smbhs and also at the hot gas properties close to the accretion radius , where the dynamics of the gas start to be dominated by the potential of the smbh .",

    "4 the observational findings are summarized and compared with the predictions of various models for low luminosity accretion . in sect .",

    "for this study all nearby nuclei with a chandra investigation of their nuclear luminosity @xmath1 are considered . a few nuclei classified as seyfert ( ho et al .",

    "the next interesting relationship to investigate is that between the nuclear luminosity and the mass potentially available for accretion .",
    "this makes use of @xmath19 and @xmath20 collected in table 1 .",
    "the simplest assumption to make is that gas accretion is steady and spherically symmetric as in the standard theory developed for gas accreting onto a point mass at rest with respect to it ( bondi 1952 ) .",

    ". a re - calculation of @xmath4 in a homogeneous way was needed here in order to consider the problem of the nature of accretion for these nuclei as a class .",
    "unfortunately , residual uncertainties remain on the @xmath4 derived here . from eq .",
    "( 1 ) , they are due to the errors on the estimate of @xmath54 , @xmath53 and @xmath0 ; in addition , the possible range of values for @xmath45 between 1 and 5/3 causes @xmath4 to vary by a factor of @xmath55 . the size of the uncertainty on @xmath4 can be estimated accurately for 7 galaxies for which errors on @xmath19 and @xmath20 in tab .",

    "the results are shown in figs . 2 and 3 .",
    "cen a and sombrero have the largest uncertainties on @xmath4 , due to the error on the respective @xmath0 values .",
    "if at very small radius the accreting gas @xmath4 joins a standard accretion disc ( shakura and sunyaev 1973 ) , so that the final stages of accretion are similar to those of bright agns , an accretion luminosity @xmath57 is expected .",
    "this is plotted as a solid line in fig .",
    "all the nuclei lie well below this expectation , which is a representation of the underluminosity problem for nearby galactic nuclei with the presently best available data . on the contrary ,",
    "the nucleus of cen a ( recognizable by its highest @xmath1 value in fig .",
    "2 ) could host a standard disc with an accretion rate close to @xmath4 .",
    "note that the bolometric luminosity @xmath58 of the nuclei should be used for a comparison with @xmath56 ; however , even when considering @xmath58 instead of @xmath1 , the conclusions are likely to remain unchanged .",
    "for example , the canonical bolometric correction for agns is @xmath59 ( elvis et al .",
    "1994 ) ; more specifically for the nuclei of ngc4261 , ngc4594 and m87 ( three galaxies in table 1 ) the ratio @xmath60 is respectively 14 , 8 and 17 , calculated from their whole spectral energy distributions ( ho 1999 ) .",
    "these values do not fix the underluminosity problem .",
    "3 shows the relationship between the eddington - scaled quantities @xmath61 and @xmath62 ( with @xmath63 ) .",
    "the reason for plotting eddington - scaled quantities lies in the possibility of a direct comparison with the predictions of low radiative efficiency accretion flows ( adaf , narayan and yi 1995 ) .",
    "these can develop in the conditions of very low @xmath64 ( defined as @xmath65 ) , precisely when @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is a viscosity parameter for the flow .",
    "adaf models predict a rate of mass accretion @xmath16 comparable to the bondi rate , with a more accurate estimate that may be @xmath68 ( quataert 2003 ) . given the values of the abscissae for the points in fig .",
    "3 , these nuclei are candidate to host adafs . in",
    "these flows the matter is so hot and tenuous that it is unable to radiate strongly ; most of the gravitational potential energy is advected by ions inside the event horizon .",
    "the adaf emission is in the x - ray and in the radio bandserg s@xmath69 erg s@xmath22 ( yi and boughn 1999 ) . ] , and scales as @xmath70 ( narayan and yi 1995 ) .",
    "this emission level is plotted in fig .",
    "3 as a dashed line , for the two cases of @xmath71 and @xmath72 , with @xmath73 ( a value typically assumed for galactic smbhs , di matteo et al .",
    "3 shows that @xmath74 is in fact much lower than @xmath56 , so that an adaf may explain the emission level for a few nearby galactic nuclei .",
    "however , @xmath74 is still too high for the emission level of many other nuclei .",
    "the most discrepant cases are those of the galaxies in the lower right portion of fig .",
    "3 , that are ngc4472 and ngc1399 ( see also loewenstein et al . 2001 ) , ngc4649 and the galactic center ( e.g. , baganoff et al . 2003 , yuan et al . 2003 ) .",
    "note also how the possibility for an adaf to reproduce the observed values of @xmath1 decreases with increasing @xmath62 , since @xmath75 increases steeply as @xmath76 .",
    "for a sample of galaxies of the local universe that excludes seyferts , starbursts and peculiar objects , the most accurate estimates available for @xmath0 , @xmath1 and circumnuclear @xmath19 , @xmath20 have been collected , with the aim of studying possible relationships between @xmath0 , @xmath1 and the bondi mass accretion rate @xmath5 .",
    "it is found that :    @xmath77 @xmath1 does not show a relationship with @xmath0 .",
    "it exhibits a large scatter , up to @xmath3 orders of magnitude , for any fixed @xmath78 .",
    "note that the core _",
    "radio _ luminosity of nearby galactic nuclei shows a similar large variation and lack of relation with the smbh mass , for @xmath42(ho 2002 ) .",
    "@xmath79 @xmath1 does not show a relationship with @xmath4 either , even though the uncertainties in the latter may be large .",
    "@xmath4 also spans a range of @xmath3 orders of magnitude .",
    "the emission level given by @xmath80 , describing the expected emission if @xmath4 ends in a standard accretion disc , is much larger than the observed @xmath1 values .",
    "therefore in general , as long as @xmath4 is a good estimate of the true mass accretion rate @xmath16 , the nuclei are not downsized agns , in the sense that their low level of emission can not be accounted for just by a @xmath81 .",
    "@xmath79 radiatively inefficient accretion as in the standard adaf modeling may explain the low luminosities of some nuclei ; for others , the predicted emission level is still higher than observed .",
    "in addition , the adaf - predicted luminosity is increasingly higher than the lowest @xmath1 observed , for increasing @xmath62 .",
    "radiatively inefficient scenarios include also ` advection dominated inflow / outflow solutions ' ( adios , blandford and begelman 1999 ) and ` convection dominated accretion flows ' ( cdafs , quataert and gruzinov 2000 , igumenshchev et al .",
    "2000 ) , where much less than the mass available at large radii ( i.e. , of @xmath4 ) is actually accreted on the smbh .",
    "adios prevent accretion by removing completely some of the inflowing matter via a polar outflow , in cdafs accretion is stalled by convecting the material back out to larger radii .",
    "the accretion of rotating gas may also result in a reduced @xmath16 relative to the bondi rate ( proga and begelman 2003 ) .",
    "all these variants of the simple radiatively inefficient scenario may be able to reproduce the low emission levels observed , by reducing considerably the amount of matter that is actually accreted",
    ".    however , the observational evidence of the independence of @xmath1 from @xmath0 and @xmath4 provided by figs . 1 , 2 and 3 is best explained if there is feedback from the smbh accretion on the surrounding ism .",
    "feedback can be provided by radiative or momentum driven heating of the circumnuclear gas . in this scenario accretion",
    "undergoes activity cycles : while active , the central engine heats the surrounding ism , so that accretion is offset ; then the ism starts cooling again and accretion resumes .",
    "intermittent accretion was already suggested and investigated in the context of the evolution of galactic cooling flows , and proposed heating sources were the nuclear hard radiation ( ciotti and ostriker 2001 ) or the deposition of the mechanical energy of nuclear outflows ( binney and tabor 1995 , omma et al .",
    "also in the case of adios the predicted wind may have an impact on the hot gas at large scales , although this aspect has not been addressed in detail yet .",
    "the intermittent accretion scenario could then be described by a series of adios with time dependent outer boundary conditions ( e.g. , yuan et al . 2000 ) .",
    "if there is feedback , and accretion becomes intermittent , the estimate of @xmath16 given by a steady spherically symmetric theory without heating sources , such as the bondi theory , may be misleading .",
    "also , no clear relationship of @xmath1 with @xmath4 and @xmath0 is expected . in a plot like fig .",
    "2 cen a could be accreting at the present time with @xmath82 and with a high radiative efficiency ; the bulk of the nuclei would be accreting with a largely different @xmath16 , since they are captured in various stages of their complex evolution .",
    "nearby early - type galaxies for which a search for nuclear emission has been made using the @xmath2 data , but no detection was found , together with a few of the upper limits on @xmath1 , may correspond to truly inactive smbhs , where accretion is temporally switched off due to feedback .",
    "other , more indirect , arguments favoring a role for feedback are discussed in this last section .    in favor of the existence of activity cycles",
    "is some observational evidence coming from a galactic scale , where @xmath2 revealed hot gas disturbances that are reconducted to the effects of recent nuclear activity .",
    "for example two symmetric arm - like features cross the center of ngc4636 ( jones et al .",
    "2002 ) , and are accompanied by a temperature increase with respect to the surrounding hot ism ; they were related to shock heating of the ism , caused by a recent nuclear outburst .",
    "a similar hot filament crosses the nuclear region of ngc821 ( fabbiano et al .",
    "2004 ) and a nuclear outflow has been detected in ngc4438 ( machacek et al .",
    "cavities and surface brightness edges related to radio activity have been revealed in ngc4374 ( finoguenov and jones 2001 ) and ngc4472 ( biller et al .",
    "2004 ) .    on the other hand the possibility that radiatively inefficient accretion takes place after the end of the bright qso phase for cosmological times seems problematic .",
    "if accretion at an average rate ( from fig .",
    "2 ) of @xmath83yr@xmath22 steadily accumulates mass at the galactic centers for @xmath84 gyrs , then smbh masses of @xmath85 @xmath39 are formed .",
    "smbhs of masses @xmath86@xmath39 already come from accretion with high radiative efficiency during the optically bright qso phase ( yu and tremaine 2002 ) , therefore after the end of this phase smbh growth by accretion with low radiative efficiency at the @xmath4 of fig .",
    "2 can not have been very important .",
    "solutions as adios and cdaf predict an effective @xmath16 much lower than @xmath4 ; in this case , however , it is unclear where does the gas that fails to accrete go , whether it accumulates in the circumnuclear region and for how long these solutions can prevent mass from accreting . on the contrary ,",
    "feedback modulated accretion has the possibility of displacing gas far from the galactic center and even removing it from the galaxy ; therefore it presents the advantage of accumulating much less mass at the galactic centers ( e.g. , ciotti and ostriker 2001 ) .",
    "the low radiative efficiency solutions could however represent a temporary effect , for example taking place within an intermittent accretion scenario , or considering that the circumnuclear environment may be modified by different astrophysical processes over timescales longer than the accretion time near @xmath27 .",
    "finally , it must also be considered that the galactic ism has a substantial and continuous mass input from stellar mass losses .",
    "a robust estimate for this source of mass is @xmath87yr@xmath22 for an early - type galaxy of present blue luminosity @xmath88 and age @xmath89 ( valid after an age of @xmath90 gyr ; ciotti et al . 1991 ) ; i.e. , @xmath91yr@xmath22 in a 15 gyrs old galaxy of @xmath92 .",
    "in stationary conditions ( or quasi - stationary , since @xmath93 is a decreasing function of time @xmath89 ) this @xmath93 , or a fraction of it coming from the inner few kpc of the galaxy , feeds a cooling flow towards the galactic center , if no strong heating sources are present ( e.g. , sarazin and white 1988 ; pellegrini & ciotti 1998 ) .",
    "this has two consequences : 1 ) in the past the mass accretion rate towards the galactic center was likely higher than at the present epoch , since @xmath93 was higher ; therefore in the past we may expect @xmath4 values higher than in fig .",
    "2 , which constrains the duration of accretion phases to be even shorter ; 2 ) for a low radiative efficiency scenario , where much less than @xmath4 can be accreted , to accomodate this continuous flow of mass towards @xmath27 ( and the continuous mass source from within @xmath27 as well ) may represent an additional problem . again",
    ", feedback modulated accretion shows the advantage of efficiently removing gas from the galactic centers .",
    "this aspect of the intermittent scenario was in fact previously suggested as a solution for the well known problem of galactic cooling flows of accumulating too much cold gas at the galactic centers with respect to the observations , if lasting for many gyrs .    in conclusion , the observational evidence provided by @xmath2 and the best estimates currently possible for the smbh masses of nearby galactic nuclei",
    "show a large dispersion of the @xmath1 and @xmath4 values , and lack of relationship between @xmath1 , @xmath0 , @xmath4 , or their eddington - scaled values , all quantities playing a fundamental role in accretion models .",
    "this seems to pose a challenge to models not providing feedback to the ism , such as the bondi accretion , adaf and cdaf .",

    "<S> in order to find an explanation for the radiative quiescence of supermassive black holes in the local universe , for a sample of nearby galaxies the most accurate estimates are collected for the mass of a central black hole ( @xmath0 ) , the nuclear x - ray luminosity @xmath1 and the circumnuclear hot gas density and temperature , by using @xmath2 data . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 varies by @xmath3 orders of magnitude and does not show a relationship with @xmath0 or with the bondi mass accretion rate @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 is always much lower than expected if @xmath4 ends in a standard accretion disc with high radiative efficiency ( this instead can be the case of the active nucleus of cen a ) </S>",
    "<S> . radiatively inefficient accretion as in the standard adaf modeling may explain the low luminosities of a few cases ; for others , the predicted luminosity is still too high and , in terms of eddington - scaled quantities , it is increasingly higher than observed , for increasing @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> variants of the simple radiatively inefficient scenario including outflow and convection may reproduce the low emission levels observed , since the amount of matter actually accreted is reduced considerably . </S>",
    "<S> however , the most promising scenario includes feedback from accretion on the surrounding gas : this has the important advantages of naturally explaining the observed lack of relationship between @xmath1 , @xmath0 and @xmath5 , and of evading the problem of the fate of the material accumulating in the central galactic regions over cosmological times . </S>"
