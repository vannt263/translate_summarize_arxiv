    "the use of the hyperspherical adiabatic ( ha ) expansion method @xcite to describe a @xmath0 collision between a particle and a bound state of two particles , called dimer in atomic physics or the deuteron in nuclear physics , was considered to be rather inefficient due to the slow pattern of convergence of the elastic channel @xcite .",
    "this fact seemed to limit the applicability of the method only to the description of bound states .",
    "the problem is due to the fact that the hyperradial coordinate used in the adiabatic expansion is not suitable to describe the asymptotic behavior of the elastic outgoing wave . in this case",
    "the use of the relative coordinate between the two particles in the outgoing dimer , and the one between the center of mass of the dimer and the third particle is much more convenient . in particular , due to the finite size of the dimer , this last relative coordinate and the hyperradius coincide only at infinity .",
    "for this reason , a correct description of the asymptotic 1 + 2 wave function and , therefore the determination of the @xmath1-matrix , requires knowledge of the wave function at very large distances , which in turn requires a huge amount of terms in the adiabatic expansion @xcite .",
    "a new method , based on two integral relations derived from the kohn variational principle ( kvp ) , was introduced in @xcite in order to permit the determination of the elastic @xmath1-matrix from the internal part of the wave function .",
    "therefore , when used together with the adiabatic expansion method , the number of adiabatic terms needed in the calculation is much lower .",
    "in fact , the pattern of convergence is similar to that observed for bound states @xcite .",
    "the details of the procedure for elastic , inelastic and recombination processes are given in refs.@xcite for energies below the dimer breakup threshold .",
    "the extension to treat the elastic channel at energies above the breakup threshold was discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the knowledge of the elastic , inelastic and recombination @xmath1-matrix elements can be used to compute different observables characterizing the reaction .",
    "furthermore , using the unitary condition @xmath2 where @xmath3 indicates the finite set @xmath4 of the elastic , inelastic and recombination channels and @xmath5 labels the infinite set of breakup channels , it is possible to obtain the total breakup cross section @xmath6 where , for three particles with equal mass , we have that @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the incident energy in the center of mass frame . examples of this procedure can be found in refs.@xcite where the inelasticities in @xmath9 scattering have been computed as well as the recombination and dissociation rates in the direct and inverse atomic processes @xmath10",
    ". therefore , an accurate calculation of the elastic and , if allowed , inelastic and recombination @xmath1-matrix elements leads to an accurate determination of the corresponding total breakup cross section through the unitary condition .",
    "on the other hand , when the knowledge of the breakup amplitude is required , the @xmath11 matrix elements have to be computed explicitly . using the ha method ,",
    "the index @xmath5 is related to the number of adiabatic channels taken into account in the description of the three - body scattering wave function . in the present work each adiabatic channel is expanded in the hyperspherical harmonic basis ( hh ) .",
    "therefore a study of the convergence properties of the breakup amplitude in terms of the adiabatic channels and the hh basis is in order .",
    "these two convergencies have to be achieved separately .",
    "as we will see , the number of adiabatic channels needed to describe the elastic channel with high accuracy is sufficient for an accurate determination of the breakup amplitude .",
    "however there are particular kinematic conditions of the outgoing particles in which the convergence of the breakup amplitude is terms of the hh basis becomes very delicate .",
    "this is the case when two of the particles move away close to each other with almost zero relative energy . in order to treat this specific configuration",
    "we will make use of an integral relation for the breakup amplitude as discussed for example in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the method discussed in the present work is general and can be applied to different kinds of three - body reactions . in this work",
    "we shall consider the @xmath12 case , which is frequently described using the faddeev equations , as shown for instance in refs.@xcite or in the recent review of ref.@xcite , or using the hh formalism in conjunction with the kvp  @xcite .",
    "calculation using the faddeev equations in momentum space including the coulomb force between the two protons can be found in ref .",
    "this and the hh method have been compared in the elastic channel up to @xmath13 mev  @xcite .",
    "attempts to explicitly determine the breakup amplitude using the hh formalism can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite whereas the formalism using the kvp is discussed in ref .",
    "those calculations have shown the intrinsic difficulties of a variational description of the breakup amplitude . as mentioned above",
    ", the main problem appears in the description of particular kinematics as for example the case in which two particles , for instance two neutrons travel close to each in a relative zero - energy state .",
    "this configuration represents a kind of clusterization inside the breakup amplitude and requires a huge number of basis states to be described properly .    using the experience gained in refs  @xcite in which the ha method was used to describe elastic , inelastic and recombination processes by means of two integral relations derived from the kvp , in the present work we extend the ha method to describe the breakup amplitude explicitly .",
    "expressions for the differential cross sections in the lab frame for @xmath0 reactions at incident energies above the dimer breakup threshold are derived .",
    "the neutron - deuteron ( @xmath9 ) reaction is studied with a semi - realistic @xmath14-wave force for illustration .",
    "this choice is motivated by the existence of benchmark calculations @xcite which allow a test of the method .",
    "this study is a first step in the application of the method to describe @xmath12 scattering using realistic two- and three - body forces and including the coulomb interaction .    in the first part of the paper we provide the details of the formalism used to compute the differential cross sections",
    "this part is divided into several subsections where we give the expression of the cross section in the lab frame , the expansion of the transition amplitude in terms of ha functions and , finally , an integral relation to compute the transition amplitude which removes the convergence problem inherent to the ha expansion . in section",
    "iii the computation of the integral relation is discussed , in particular the treatment of the long tail of the kernel .",
    "the results obtained for the case of neutron - deuteron breakup are described in section iv and the last section is devoted to some conclusive remarks . for the sake of completeness ,",
    "the paper includes six appendices in which some derivations not essential for the understanding of the paper are given . in particular ,",
    "several technical aspects of the scattering theory are discussed in terms of the hyperspherical adiabatic expansion method .",
    "in this section we summarize the formalism employed to compute the differential cross sections for 1 + 2 reactions at energies above the breakup threshold . to this end",
    ", we have divided the section into four parts , which correspond to :    @xmath15 description of the notation used ;    @xmath16 derivation of the general expression of the cross section in the lab frame in terms of the transition amplitude ;    @xmath17 expansion of the transition amplitude in terms of the ha functions ;    @xmath18 derivation of the integral relation in terms of the three - nucleon scattering wave function in which the outgoing six - dimensional wave is not expanded in the ha basis .",
    "this relation can correct some inaccuracies in the computed transition amplitude ( see for example ref.@xcite ) .",
    "it also manifests the variational character of the method .",
    "the details of how to compute this matrix element and , in particular , how to compute the long tail of the integral contained in this matrix element are discussed in the next section .",
    "some theoretical derivations , not crucial for an understanding of the formalism , but in order to have a compact presentation of the method , have been collected in the appendices .",
    "let us denote by @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) the coordinates of the three particles involved in the 1 + 2 reaction under investigation , and by @xmath21 ( @xmath20 ) their corresponding momenta .",
    "from these coordinates we construct the usual jacobi coordinates , which are given by : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the reduced mass of the @xmath24 two - body system , @xmath25 is the reduced mass of particle @xmath26 and the two - body system @xmath24 , @xmath3 is an arbitrary normalization mass , and @xmath27 ( @xmath20 ) are the masses of the three particles .",
    "cyclic permutations of @xmath28 give the three possible sets of jacobi coordinates .",
    "the corresponding jacobi coordinates in momentum space take the form : @xmath29    from the jacobi coordinates we construct the hyperspherical coordinates .",
    "they are given by one radial coordinate , the hyperradius @xmath30 , defined as @xmath31 ( the definition is independent of the jacobi set used ) , and five hyperangles , which are given by @xmath32 , and the polar and azimuthal angles describing the direction of @xmath33 and @xmath34 , i.e. , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 .",
    "the hyperangles depends on the jacobi set chosen to describe the three - body system , and we shall denote them in a compact form as @xmath37 .",
    "the corresponding hyperspherical coordinates in momentum space are given by the three - body momentum @xmath38 , and the five hyperangles @xmath39 , where @xmath40 .",
    "the three - body momentum @xmath41 is related to the total three - body energy @xmath42 of the process by the expression @xmath43 .",
    "note that the volume element is given in terms of the relative coordinates @xmath44 and @xmath45 defined in eqs.([eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "therefore : @xmath46 where @xmath47 , and which means that the hypersurface element of the hypersphere with hyperradius @xmath30 is given by : @xmath48    it is important to note that asymptotically the hyperangles in coordinate ( @xmath49 ) and momentum ( @xmath50 ) space coincide .",
    "this is related to the fact that the hyperspherical harmonics transform into themselves after a fourier transformation .",
    "a more intuitive way of checking this fact is that asymptotically , at a given time @xmath51 , the coordinate of particle @xmath26 is just given by @xmath52 . when replacing this expressions for @xmath19 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 into eqs.([eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) , and taking into account the definitions ( [ eq3 ] ) and ( [ eq4 ] ) , we immediately get that @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "therefore , asymptotically , the polar and azimuthal angles describing the directions of @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the same as those describing the directions of @xmath57 and @xmath58 , and also , @xmath59 which implies that , asymptotically , @xmath60 . therefore , asymptotically , @xmath61 .    when describing the incoming 1 + 2 channel it is convenient to choose the jacobi set such that the relative coordinate @xmath62 in eq.([eq1 ] ) is the relative coordinate between the two particles in the dimer . in this case the jacobi momentum @xmath63 in eq.([eq4 ] ) is given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 is just the incident relative projectile - dimer momentum in the center of mass frame .",
    "we shall denote these two vectors , @xmath63 and @xmath65 , as @xmath66 and @xmath67 , such that they can be distinguished from the corresponding momenta in the final state .",
    "the momentum @xmath67 is related to the incident energy @xmath68 ( in the center of mass frame ) by the expression @xmath69 , and the total energy @xmath42 is then given by @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the binding energy of the dimer ( @xmath72 ) . in the following ,",
    "unless explicitly mentioned , we shall use this jacobi set ( the dimer wave function depends only on the @xmath73 coordinate ) and we shall omit the index @xmath26 when referring to the @xmath74 or @xmath75 coordinates defined in eqs.([eq1 ] ) to ( [ eq4 ] ) .      the differential cross section @xmath76 after a 1 + 2 breakup reaction is given by the outgoing flux of the particles through an element of the hypersurface , eq.([eq6 ] ) , normalized with the incident flux .",
    "the expression for the outgoing flux is derived in appendix [ app1 ] , and it is given by eq.([apen7 ] ) : @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the breakup transition amplitude , in which we have made explicit the spin projections @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 which correspond to the three particles found after the breakup ( with spins @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 ) , and to the dimer ( with spin @xmath87 ) and the projectile ( with spin @xmath88 ) .",
    "the incoming flux is the one corresponding to a particle - dimer two - body process , and it is given by : @xmath89 where the connection between incident momentum @xmath90 and @xmath91 is given in eq.([eq4 ] ) .",
    "the ratio between eqs.([eq7 ] ) and ( [ eq8 ] ) gives then the differential cross section in the three - body center of mass frame , and it takes the form : @xmath92 where we have already averaged over the initial states and summed over all the possible final states .",
    "this procedure gives the @xmath93 factor and the summation over all the spin projections .    in appendix [ app2 ]",
    "we have derived the phase space in terms of the center of mass coordinates , eq.([apb5 ] ) , and in terms of the laboratory coordinates , eq.([apb24 ] ) . for simplicity ,",
    "derivation of eq.([apb24 ] ) has been made assuming three particles with equal mass @xmath3 ( which is also taken to be the normalization mass in eqs.([eq1 ] ) to ( [ eq4 ] ) ) .",
    "thus the expression below is valid only for this particular case , although the generalization to three particles with different masses is straightforward . making equal eqs.([apb5 ] ) and",
    "( [ apb24 ] ) we then obtain : @xmath94 where @xmath26 and @xmath95 refer to two of the outgoing particles , @xmath96 , @xmath97 are the polar and azimuthal angles giving the direction of momentum @xmath21 ( and similarly for particle @xmath95 ) , the arclength @xmath98 is defined by eq.([apb21b ] ) , and , finally , @xmath99 is given by eq.([apb25 ] ) .",
    "since : @xmath100 we get the following final expression for the cross section in the laboratory frame : @xmath101 where @xmath102 is given in eq.([eq9 ] ) .",
    "in this work we shall focus on neutron - deuteron breakup reactions . for this case",
    "we have three spin 1/2 particles with mass @xmath3 equal to the nucleon mass , and such that the spin of the dimer and the projectile are , respectively , @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "also , @xmath91 is given by @xmath105 , where @xmath90 is the relative momentum between projectile and dimer .",
    "using then eqs.([eq9 ] ) and ( [ eq12 ] ) we obtain for the @xmath9 case : @xmath106    in our calculations the particles @xmath26 and @xmath95 in the equation above will be taken to be the two outgoing neutrons .",
    "the input will be the neutron incident energy in the lab frame ( @xmath107 ) , the polar angles @xmath108 and @xmath109 for the two outgoing neutrons , and @xmath110 .",
    "these angles , as shown in eqs.([apb11 ] ) , ( [ apb12 ] ) , and ( [ apb13 ] ) , determine the values of @xmath111 , @xmath112 , and @xmath113 entering in @xmath99 ( eq.([apb25 ] ) ) .",
    "the input incident energy @xmath107 immediately provides the momentum of the projectile in the lab frame : @xmath114 which also enters in @xmath99 .",
    "the lab energy @xmath107 can be easily related to the incident energy in the center of mass frame ( @xmath68 ) , which for the case of the @xmath9 reaction becomes @xmath115 . from it",
    "we can get the center of mass relative momentum @xmath90 entering in eq.([eq13 ] ) , which is given by @xmath116 , where @xmath117 is the projectile - dimer reduced mass .",
    "the cross section given in eq.([eq13 ] ) is a function of the arclength @xmath98 .",
    "for each value of @xmath98 , given the input @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath118 , the values of @xmath119 and @xmath120 are uniquely determined , as shown in appendix [ app3 ] .",
    "these two momenta , together with the already known values of @xmath121 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 , permit now to compute @xmath99 according to eq.([apb25 ] ) and then obtain the differential cross section .",
    "the only piece remaining is the determination of the breakup transition amplitude @xmath122 , which is discussed in the following sections .",
    "when using hyperspherical coordinates the three - body hamiltonian operator @xmath123 takes the form @xcite : @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the hyperradial kinetic energy operator and @xmath126 is defined as @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the grand - angular operator , and @xmath3 is an arbitrary normalization mass .",
    "the operator @xmath126 contains all the dependence on the hyperangles and the potential energy , which has been taken to include two - body forces only .",
    "eventually three - body forces can be considered as well .",
    "this hamiltonian can be solved for fixed values of @xmath30 , such that the angular eigenfunctions @xmath129",
    "satisfy @xmath130    the set of angular eigenfunctions @xmath131 forms the ha basis with definite values of the total angular momentum and projection @xmath132 .",
    "they form a complete basis that can be used to expand the three - body wave function .",
    "the advantage of this basis is that the large distance behavior of each term can be related to the different open channels . in particular ,",
    "the possible elastic , inelastic and recombination 1 + 2 channels are associated to specific adiabatic terms  @xcite , whose corresponding eigenvalues @xmath133 go asymptotically as @xmath134 , where @xmath71 is now the binding energy of the dimer in that specific 1 + 2 channel .",
    "the remaining infinitely many adiabatic basis terms describe three free particles in the continuum , and each of their corresponding eigenvalues",
    "@xmath133 behaves at large distances as @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the grand - angular quantum number .",
    "therefore , each breakup channel is associated to a single value of @xmath136 . in other words , if a breakup angular eigenfunction @xmath137 is expanded in terms of the hh basis , at very large distances , only the hh basis elements with that specific value of @xmath136 survive .",
    "asymptotically the ha basis describing the breakup channels coincides with the hh basis since , in this case , the ha basis elements are eigenfunctions of the @xmath126 operator given in eq.([omegah ] ) without the interaction term .    in the following",
    "we shall focus on a @xmath0 process where inelastic or recombination channels are not possible .",
    "this means that there is only one possible dimer in the @xmath0 system that can be either the target or the projectile not having any bound excited state .",
    "the inclusion of additional @xmath0 channels does not present any intrinsic difficulties @xcite , and they are not relevant for the description of the breakup channel discussed in this work .",
    "in fact , the @xmath9 reaction that we shall consider corresponds precisely to this kind of reactions ( the deuteron does not have excited states and is the only two - nucleon bound system ) .    in the appendix [ app4 ]",
    "we have shown that the adiabatic expansion of the outgoing three - body wave function describing the breakup of the dimer can be written as ( eq.([expan ] ) ) : @xmath138 where @xmath139 is the adiabatic angular function ( in momentum space ) associated to the incident 1 + 2 channel ( channel 1 ) , and @xmath140 and @xmath4 are the total angular momentum and projection of the three - body ( projectile+target ) system .",
    "the summation over @xmath5 refers to all the breakup adiabatic channels , whose corresponding angular functions are given by @xmath141 ( as mentioned above , we have assumed that the incident channel 1 is the only 1 + 2 channel in the three - body system ) .",
    "the wave function is projected over the initial spin states @xmath142 of target and projectile , and the final spin states @xmath143 of the three particles after the breakup .",
    "the hyperradial functions @xmath144 in eq.([eq17 ] ) depend on the total angular momentum @xmath140 and are obtained by solving the set of coupled differential equations @xmath145 f^j_{n1}(\\rho ) } \\nonumber \\\\ & & - \\sum_{n } \\left(2 p_{n n'}(\\rho ) \\frac{d}{d\\rho } + q_{n",

    "details are given in @xcite .",
    "for the breakup channels ( @xmath148 ) the radial wave functions @xmath144 behave asymptotically as @xcite : @xmath149 where @xmath136 is the grand - angular quantum number associated to the breakup adiabatic channel @xmath5 , @xmath150 is a hankel function of first kind , and @xmath151 is the corresponding matrix element of the @xmath1-matrix .    using the expression above ,",
    "we can write the asymptotic behavior of the outgoing wave function in eq.([eq17 ] ) as : @xmath152 where the breakup transition amplitude is given by : @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the angular eigenfunction @xmath139 is derived in appendix  [ app5 ] , and for the particular case of relative @xmath14-waves between the particles takes the form ( eq.([apd10 ] ) ) : @xmath155 where @xmath91 is related to the incident relative projectile - dimer momentum @xmath90 through eq.([eq4 ] ) and @xmath156 is the reduced mass of the two particles in the dimer .",
    "the expression above permits to write the transition amplitude given in eq.([eq20 ] ) as : @xmath157 which is valid for relative @xmath14-waves only .",
    "the angular eigenfunctions @xmath158 can be decomposed in the three faddeev amplitudes as ( see refs.@xcite for details ) @xmath159 where each of the three components of the angular eigenfunction is written in terms of each of the three possible sets of jacobi coordinates .",
    "moreover , in the present work the angular eigenfunctions @xmath160 are expanded in terms of the hh basis . in general , the corresponding expansion coefficients contain the dependence of the angular eigenfunction on @xmath30 .",
    "asymptotically each breakup adiabatic channel is associated to some specific value of @xmath136 , and the eigenfunction becomes a @xmath30-independent expansion .",
    "more precisely , it results in a linear combination of hh functions having well - defined grand - angular quantum number .",
    "in particular , if we consider only relative @xmath14-waves between the particles the following expression can be obtained @xmath161 where the @xmath162 s are the coefficients in the expansion , @xmath163 is a normalization coefficient and @xmath164 is a jacobi polynomial .",
    "moreover @xmath136 is associated to the asymptotic behavior of the adiabatic channel , @xmath165 , @xmath166 is the coupling between the spins of the two particles used to construct the @xmath73 jacobi coordinate , @xmath167 is the spin of the third particle , and @xmath168 is the total three - body spin function arising from the coupling of @xmath166 and @xmath167 to the total angular momentum @xmath140 with projection @xmath4 . taking this into account , the transition amplitude in eq.([eq23 ] ) can be written in a more compact form as : @xmath169 where the index @xmath170 numbers the three possible sets of jacobi coordinates and @xmath171 where we have made use of eq.([eq21 ] ) . from eq.([eq25 ] ) we can then finally write : @xmath172 where @xmath173 and @xmath170 run over the three possible sets of jacobi coordinates , and @xmath174 is the three - body spin function in the jacobi set @xmath173 , where the spin @xmath175 , associated to the jacobi coordinate @xmath176 , couples to the spin @xmath177 of the third particle to give the total three - body angular momentum @xmath140 ( all the orbital angular momenta are assumed to be zero ) . finally , eq.([eq27 ] ) , together with eq.([eq26 ] ) , permits to obtain the cross section in the center of mass frame in eq.([eq9 ] ) , and therefore the cross section in the lab frame as given by eq.([eq12 ] ) .",
    "it should be noticed that the transition amplitude in eq.([eq23 ] ) is obtained from the asymptotic behavior of the wave function in eq.([eq17 ] ) .",
    "this means that the hyperangles @xmath178 entering in eq.([eq23 ] ) , or ( [ eq26 ] ) , are the asymptotic hyperangles , which are known to be the same in coordinate and momentum space .      the working equation in the calculation of the breakup amplitude using the ha basis is eq.([eq26 ] ) .",
    "the feasibility of the method could be limited by the number of adiabatic terms needed in the expansion , given by the index @xmath5 which in principle runs up to @xmath179 . since asymptotically the ha and the hh basis tend to be the same , the coefficients @xmath180 have the property of being close to a non - zero constant when @xmath136 takes the value associated to the asymptotic behavior of the adiabatic potential @xmath5 , and close to zero otherwise .",
    "therefore the number of terms in the expansion is intrinsically related to the ability of the hh basis to describe the asymptotic configurations .",
    "if the hyperangle @xmath181 approaches zero , the relative momentum of the two particles connected by the @xmath182 jacobi coordinate approaches zero as well , and the two particles appear in an almost zero - energy relative state . as mentioned before , this produces a kind of clusterization in the breakup amplitude very difficult to describe with the hh basis .",
    "in fact , for this particular geometry , the breakup adiabatic angular eigenfunctions entering in the transition amplitude ( see eq.([eq23 ] ) ) should be similar to the one corresponding to a 1 + 2 channel , given by eq.([apd1 ] ) , but replacing the bound dimer wave function by the zero energy two - body wave function .    to illustrate this point we take the @xmath9 case with total spin @xmath183 as an example . in this case , according to eq.([apd1 ] ) , for the geometries having @xmath184 ( @xmath185 ) and assuming relative @xmath14-waves between the particles we should get : @xmath186 for all the angular eigenfunctions associated to breakup channels ( @xmath148 ) , where @xmath187 is the zero energy neutron - proton wave function , and @xmath188 is the relative distance between the neutron and the proton . in fig.[fig1 ] we plot the function @xmath189 as a function @xmath188 for three fixed values of the jacobi coordinate @xmath190 , 57 fm ( dot - dashed curve ) , 85 fm ( dashed curve ) , and 114 fm ( solid curve ) .",
    "obviously , the larger the value of @xmath190 the smaller the value of the hyperangle @xmath191 associated to a given @xmath188 , and therefore the more should the function @xmath192 approach the zero - energy two - body function @xmath193 given in eq.([0en ] ) , which is shown in fig.[fig1 ] by the thin solid line .",
    "the expected behavior is what we observe in the figure , where , as we can see , for @xmath194 fm the function @xmath192 ( thick solid curve ) matches the two - body wave function @xmath193 ( thin solid curve ) pretty well up to almost 20 fm ( the thin solid curve has been scaled to fit the same minimum as @xmath192 ) .",
    "the zero - energy two - body wave function is linear in the relative radial coordinate ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) , and therefore proportional to @xmath195 .",
    "the reconstruction of this behavior by use of an expansion in terms of @xmath196 , as in the expansion given in eq.([eq26 ] ) , requires in principle infinitely many terms . accordingly , as @xmath197 the number of adiabatic terms needed to get a convergent value for @xmath198 increases without limit .",
    "hence , eq.([eq26 ] ) is not operative in this particular situation .    to overcome this problem",
    "we shall develop in this section an alternative expression for the transition amplitude where the adiabatic expansion in eq.([eq23 ] ) , in terms of the coefficients @xmath180 , does not enter explicitly",
    ". this procedure will be more expensive from a numerical point of view , but more accurate in the kinematic regions where @xmath199 .",
    "the starting point here is the well known expansion of the three - body plane wave in terms of the hyperspherical harmonics : @xmath200 } i^k j_{k+2}(\\kappa \\rho )   { \\cal y}_{[k]}^{jm}(\\omega_\\rho )   \\langle \\sigma_i \\sigma_j \\sigma_k | { \\cal y}_{[k]}^{jm*}(\\omega_\\kappa ) , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath201}^{jm}$ ] is a hh function coupled to a three - body spin function @xcite .",
    "all the quantum numbers are collected into the set @xmath202 \\equiv\\{k,\\ell_x,\\ell_y , l , s_x , s\\}$ ] . on the other hand ,",

    ", these three momenta permit us to construct @xmath258 and @xmath63 , and the matrix element in eq.([eq45 ] ) can then be computed as a function of the arclength @xmath98 .",
    "note also that in eq.([eq45 ] ) , since only @xmath14-waves are assumed to contribute , the full dependence of the integrand on @xmath259 and @xmath260 is contained in the exponential . the integration over @xmath259 and @xmath260 can then be made analytically , leading to the expression : @xmath261 which is real ( the integral involving the sinus is just zero ) .",
    "the remaining integral over @xmath262 and @xmath190 has to be performed numerically :    @xmath263    as we can see , the dependence on the directions of @xmath258 and @xmath264 has disappeared .",
    "the dependence on the momenta is only through @xmath265 and @xmath266 , where @xmath267 and where @xmath42 is the three - body energy above threshold .",
    "it is important not to get confused with @xmath191 ( @xmath268 ) , which is a variable in coordinate space to be integrated away , and @xmath269 ( @xmath270 ) , which is a variable in momentum space , and which takes a well defined value for each value of the arclength @xmath98 .",
    "the integral over @xmath262 is limited by the short - range character of the potential @xmath271 .",
    "therefore the numerical computation of the integral does not present any particular difficulties . in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a we show two examples of the typical behavior of the integrand as a function of @xmath262 for two arbitrary fixed values of @xmath190 .",
    "the curves correspond to the @xmath9 breakup reaction whose details will be given later on .",
    "they have been obtained for two fixed values of the @xmath190-coordinate .",
    "as we can see , the function becomes basically zero for rather small values of @xmath262 .",
    "the integral over @xmath190 is however more complicated . in general",
    ", the integrand does not fall off exponentially at large distances , and its calculation is therefore more delicate .",
    "we can distinguish two different cases depending on the asymptotic behavior of the @xmath272 radial wave function , i.e. , when @xmath5 is associated to the 1 + 2 channel or to a breakup channel . in the following",
    "we discuss the two cases .      when @xmath5 labels a 1 + 2 channel ( @xmath273 in our case ) , the corresponding faddeev amplitudes of the angular function @xmath158 behave at large distances as given by eq.([apd1 ] ) , which reduces to @xmath274 when only @xmath14-waves are involved .",
    "in this expression @xmath275 is the bound two - body wave function of the dimer associated to the 1 + 2 channel @xmath5 and @xmath87 is the spin of the dimer .    having this in mind , we can observe that the sum on the hh index @xmath136 in eq.([eq47 ] ) can be reconstructed for @xmath273 ( 1 + 2 channel ) as @xmath276 the last expression shows that , at large distances , the integrand in eq.([eq47 ] ) contains explicitly the dimer wave function in the different jacobi permutations .",
    "two different possibilities appear : the potential and the dimer depend on jacobi coordinates belonging to two different permutations , for example @xmath33 and @xmath277 . in this case the integral in eq.([eq47 ] ) has an exponential fall off in both coordinates , @xmath262 and @xmath190 .",
    "in fact , when the two - body potential refers to the two particles that do not form the dimer ( for instance the @xmath278 potential in the @xmath9 case ) , large values of @xmath190 would correspond to large distances between the third particle and the one with which that third particle forms the dimer ( large neutron - proton distance in the @xmath9 case ) .",
    "thus , for sufficiently large values of @xmath190 the integrand should be zero due to the presence of the bound dimer wave function , which is now basically associated to the @xmath190-coordinates at large distances .",
    "taking again the @xmath9 case as an illustration , the solid curves in fig.[fig2]b correspond to the integrand of eq.([eq47 ] ) as a function of @xmath190 for two different values of the arclength @xmath98 ( after integrating away the @xmath262-coordinate ) for the case of the neutron - neutron potential .",
    "as shown in the figure , the integrand in the @xmath190 coordinate dies pretty fast , and it is negligible already at distances of even less than 40 fm .",
    "a similar case arises when the interaction is the one giving rise to the dimer ( the neutron - proton potential in the @xmath9 case ) and @xmath166 is different to the spin of the bound dimer ( @xmath279 in the @xmath9 case ) .",
    "the reason now is that the coefficients @xmath280 in eq.([eq47 ] ) go to zero for large values of the hyperradius ( as shown in eq.([eq48 ] ) , asymptotically only the terms with @xmath281 survive ) .",
    "this case is illustrated in fig.[fig2]b by the dashed lines , which correspond to the @xmath9 case , and which show that also in this case the integrand goes to zero rather fast .",
    "therefore , in the particular cases shown in fig.[fig2]b the numerical computation of the integral in the both variables , @xmath262 and @xmath190 , do not present particular problems .",
    "a different situation appears when the potential in eq.([eq47 ] ) and the dimer depend on the same variable @xmath73 and when @xmath281 ( neutron - proton potential and @xmath282 in the @xmath9 case ) . in this case",
    "the the @xmath190-coordinate integrand in eq.([eq47 ] ) does not vanish exponentially and a particular analysis of the integrand tail has to be performed .",
    "it is well known @xcite that the large distance behavior of @xmath272 , for @xmath5 being a 1 + 2 channel , is given by : @xmath283 where @xmath162 and @xmath284 are complex numbers ( the @xmath285-functions are complex ) , and @xmath286 , where @xmath287 is the binding energy of the dimer present in the 1 + 2 channel associated to the adiabatic term @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , using eqs.([eq50 ] ) and ( [ eq48 ] ) it is clear that the integrand in eq.([eq47 ] ) is asymptotically separable into @xmath262 and @xmath190 coordinates , and the integrand of the @xmath190 part goes like : @xmath288 where @xmath162 and @xmath284 are complex constants , and where we have used that , since @xmath262 is restricted to small values , then @xmath289 .",
    "this behavior is shown in fig.[fig2]c again for the @xmath9 case .",
    "the solid curve is the integrand in the @xmath190-coordinate obtained numerically for some value of the arclength @xmath98 , and the dashed curve is the matching with the expression in eq.([eq51 ] ) .",
    "as shown in the figure the matching is pretty good for distances already of about 30 - 40 fm .",
    "therefore an easy way of computing the integral over @xmath190 in eq.([eq47 ] ) ( for the two - body potential giving rise to the dimer and @xmath281 ) is to do it numerically after subtracting the asymptotic behavior given in eq.([eq51 ] ) , i.e. , integrating numerically the difference between the solid and the dashed curves in fig.[fig2]c , which dies asymptotically sufficiently fast , and afterward add the analytical integral of eq.([eq51 ] ) from @xmath290 to @xmath179 .",
    "this analytical integral can be easily made by using that :    @xmath291 = 0 ; ( a>0 ) \\label{an1}\\ ] ]    @xmath292 =     \\frac{k_y}{(k_y)^2-(k_y^{(n)})^2 } ; ( a>0 ) \\label{an2}\\ ] ]    where we have to remember that @xmath293 and @xmath294 , which are always different ( @xmath295 ) .      due to the short - range character of the potential , the @xmath262-values are in any case restricted to relatively small values ,",
    "no matter the character of the channel @xmath5 in eq.([eq47 ] ) . for this reason , even if @xmath5 corresponds to a breakup channel , the large distance behavior of the integrand is given by contributions fulfilling that @xmath296 ( or , in other words , @xmath297 ) .",
    "also , for a breakup channel @xmath5 , the coefficients @xmath298 go to constant values ( the angular eigenfunctions @xmath299 become just a linear combination of hyperspherical harmonics , see eq.([eq21 ] ) ) , and the jacobi polynomials @xmath300 contained in the hyperspherical harmonics go also to the constant value @xmath301 .",
    "finally , the general behavior at large distances of the radial functions @xmath272 is given by a linear combination of the hankel functions of first and second order @xcite , which means that their asymptotic behavior is given by : @xmath302 where we have already replaced @xmath30 by @xmath190 .",
    "therefore , when @xmath5 is associated to a breakup channel , the @xmath190-part of the integrand in eq.([eq47 ] ) goes asymptotically as : @xmath303 where , again , the constants @xmath304 and @xmath305 are complex and @xmath306 .",
    "obviously , the higher the value of @xmath4 , the lower the value of @xmath190 at which the matching with the numerical integrand is obtained .",
    "thus , for outgoing breakup channels , the @xmath190-part of the integral in eq.([eq47 ] ) goes to zero asymptotically as @xmath307 .",
    "it could then seem that such integral could be done numerically without much trouble .",
    "however , the fall off is not fast enough , and at relatively large distances the integrand is not really negligible . taking again the @xmath9 case as an example , this is shown in fig.[fig2]d , where the blue curve is the integrand in eq.([eq47 ] ) as a function of @xmath190 for some value of the arclength @xmath98 and for @xmath5 being one of the breakup channels ( @xmath148 ) . at a distance of about 200 fm",
    "the integrand is not at all negligible , in fact the amplitude of the oscillations shown in the figure are still about 10% of the maximum computed amplitude .",
    "the dashed curve shows the matching given by eq.([eq55 ] ) and @xmath308 .",
    "it is clear that this matching is less accurate than the one shown in fig.[fig2]c , and the agreement now with the true integrand is observed much farther , at 150 fm at least",
    ".    therefore , due to the too slow fall off of the integrand , it is convenient to integrate numerically up to some @xmath309 value at which the matching with the asymptotic behavior in eq.([eq55 ] ) has already been achieved , and to perform analytically the integrand from @xmath309 up to @xmath179 .",
    "these analytical integrations involve the so - called fresnel integrals , and they can be performed as indicated in appendix [ app6 ] .",

    "the details concerning the integral relations formalism applied to the description of breakup 1 + 2 reactions are given in ref.@xcite .",
    "this method permits to extract the @xmath1-matrix of the reaction from the internal part of the wave function .",
    "when this wave function is obtained by means of the adiabatic expansion method , the pattern of convergence of the @xmath1-matrix is similar to the one obtained with the same method for bound states .    in @xcite the integral relations method",
    "is applied to the @xmath9 reaction .",
    "only @xmath14-waves are considered in the calculation , which implies that only two different total angular momenta are possible , the quartet case ( @xmath140=3/2 ) , for which only the triplet @xmath14-wave potential in eq.([eq60 ] ) enters , and the doublet case ( @xmath140=1/2 ) , for which both the singlet and the triplet potentials contribute .",
    "the unitarity of the @xmath1- matrix implies that given an incoming channel , for instance , channel 1 ( @xmath9 channel ) , we have that @xmath315 , or in other words : @xmath316 which means that an accurate calculation of the elastic term @xmath317 amounts to an accurate calculation of the infinite summation of the @xmath318 terms ( @xmath319 ) corresponding to the breakup channels , and therefore allowing the calculation of the total breakup cross section given in eq.([crossb ] ) .    the complex value of @xmath317 can be written in terms of a complex phase shift @xmath320 as @xmath321    the value of @xmath322 gives the probability of elastic neutron - deuteron scattering , and @xmath323 is what usually referred to as the inelasticity parameter ( denoted by @xmath324 in @xcite ) .",

    "we have used the same two lab energies considered in ref.@xcite , i.e. , 14.1 mev and 42.0 mev .",
    "the value of @xmath326 given in the tables corresponds to the asymptotic grand - angular quantum number associated to the last adiabatic potential included in the adiabatic expansion .    as seen in the tables , the agreement with the results in ref.@xcite is good . actually , we obtain precisely the same result for the two incident energies in the quartet case , and a small difference clearly smaller than 0.1% in the doublet case .",
    "furthermore , the pattern of convergence is rather fast , specially in the quartet case , for which already for @xmath327 we obtain a result that can be considered very accurate . in the doublet case the convergence is a bit slower , and a value of @xmath326 of about 16 is needed .",
    "once the @xmath1-matrix of the reaction has been computed , we can now obtain the transition matrix according to the expression in eq.([eq26 ] ) , and therefore also the expression eq.([eq27 ] ) and the lab cross section in eq.([eq12 ] ) .",
    "we shall consider an incident energy in the lab frame of @xmath328 mev and four different outgoing geometries specified by the polar angles @xmath329 and @xmath330 and the difference of azimuthal angles @xmath331 , where @xmath332 and @xmath333 describe the direction of the two outgoing neutrons .",

    ", @xmath344 refers to the asymptotic value of the grand - angular quantum number @xmath136 associated to last adiabatic term included in the expansion in eq.([eq26 ] ) . a value of @xmath345 amounts to including 18 adiabatic terms in the expansion .",
    "this is enough to reach convergence .",
    "in fact , the same calculation with @xmath346 ( 12 adiabatic terms ) is basically indistinguishable from the curves shown in the figure .",
    "the cross sections given in the benchmark calculation in ref.@xcite are shown by the dotted curves . as we can see , the results given in the benchmark calculation are nicely reproduced .",
    "the corresponding cross sections for the doublet case ( @xmath347 ) are shown by the dashed curves in the upper parts of figs.[fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] . when the contribution from the quartet state ( fig.[fig3 ] ) is added , we get the total cross section given by the solid curves in the same figures .",
    "the doublet cross sections have been obtained with @xmath345 , which for @xmath347 corresponds to inclusion of 35 adiabatic terms in the expansion of eq.([eq26 ] ) .",
    "again , when @xmath344 is reduced to 22 ( 23 adiabatic terms ) the computed curves can not be distinguished from the ones shown in the figure .",
    "as we can see , even if the computed cross sections have converged , there is a clear discrepancy with the benchmark calculation for case 1 , and , to a lower extent , for case 2 ( fig.[fig4 ] ) . for cases 3 and 4 ( fig.[fig5 ] )",
    "the agreement is reasonably good .",
    "as anticipated in section  [ 2d ] , the discrepancy with the benchmark calculation appears in the @xmath98-regions corresponding to an outgoing kinematics where two of the particles have zero relative energy .",
    "this can be seen in fig.[fig4 ] , where the lower part shows , as a function of the arclength @xmath98 , the hyperangle @xmath348 for the cases 1 and 2 .",
    "the index @xmath349 corresponds to the jacobi coordinates where @xmath73 connects the two neutrons ( solid curve ) , and the indices @xmath350 correspond to the jacobi coordinates where @xmath73 connects the proton and one of the neutrons ( dashed and dot - dashed curves ) . for case 1 ( left part of the figure ) , we can see that @xmath351 and @xmath352 approach zero very much for @xmath98 slightly below 5 mev and about 13 mev .",
    "in these regions the proton and one of the neutrons move with relative zero ( or very small ) energy , and these are precisely the regions where the discrepancy with the benchmark calculation is observed . for case 2",
    ", @xmath353 and @xmath354 do not approach zero as much as in case 1 , and the discrepancy with the benchmark calculation is now much smaller than in case 1 ( or even not visible , as it happens for the second peak of the cross section ) .    for completeness ,",
    "we show in the lower part of fig.[fig5 ] the same as in fig.[fig4 ] but for cases 3 and 4 .",
    "now the values of @xmath355 do not reach zero for any @xmath98-value , and the agreement between our calculation and the benchmark is fine for all values of @xmath98 .",
    "as already mentioned , the problem is related to the fact that @xmath356 means two of the particles flying together with relative zero ( or very small ) energy , and the third particle moving far apart . the adiabatic expansion in eq.([eq26 ] )",
    "is then trying to reproduce the zero energy two - body wave function ( which is proportional to @xmath357 ) in terms of a set of polynomials ( the jacobi polynomials ) that have @xmath358 as argument .",
    "a correct description of the zero energy two - body wave function would require then infinitely many adiabatic terms .",
    "as seen in fig.[fig3 ] , the inaccuracy mentioned above for @xmath356 is not visible in the quartet case , where only triplet nucleon - nucleon components enter . however , as seen in fig.[fig4 ] , where the contribution from the doublet has been added , the mismatch with the benchmark calculation becomes very significant .",
    "this is due to the fact that in the doublet case there is an important contribution from the singlet nucleon - nucleon components .",
    "this little difference is actually very relevant , because the singlet nucleon - nucleon potential has a rather large scattering length of about @xmath359 fm , more than four times bigger ( in absolute value ) than the scattering length of the triplet nucleon - nucleon potential ( of about @xmath360 fm ) .",
    "this means that the @xmath14-wave singlet nucleon - nucleon system has a pretty low - lying virtual state that favors the structure mentioned above of two nucleons flying together after the collision at a very low relative energy . for the case of the triplet nucleon - nucleon state",
    "the energy of the corresponding virtual state is about 20 times higher than in the singlet case ( the virtual state energy is proportional to the inverse of the scattering length squared ) .",
    "the solution suggested in order to solve the disagreement observed in fig.[fig4 ] is to skip the expansion of the outgoing wave in terms of the different adiabatic channels and compute instead the transition amplitude as given in eq.([eq41 ] ) , where the adiabatic expansion does not enter .",
    "the results obtained by using this alternative method are given in the following section .",
    "the cross section in eq.([eq13 ] ) is now computed making use of eq.([eq41 ] ) . the matrix element in this expression",
    "is given by eq.([eq47 ] ) , whose calculation requires using the techniques described is sections  [ int1 ] and [ int2 ] when integrating over the @xmath190-coordinate . for the case described in fig.[fig2]c the integral over @xmath190",
    "is made by integrating numerically the difference between the computed integrand and its analytic asymptotic behavior ( difference between the solid and dashed curves in figs.[fig2]c ) , and adding the analytical integral , from zero to @xmath179 , of the asymptotic behavior .",
    "these analytical integrals can be made with the help of eqs.([an1 ] ) and ( [ an2 ] ) .",
    "for the case described in fig.[fig2]d the integral over @xmath190 is made by integrating numerically up to some @xmath309 at which the asymptotic behavior in eq.([eq55 ] ) has already been reached , and the integral from @xmath309 to @xmath179 is made as described in appendix  [ app6 ] .    the integral in eq.([eq47 ] ) contains a summation over the adiabatic terms @xmath5 and the grand - angular quantum number @xmath136 .",
    "this double summation comes from the expansion of the incident three - body wave function @xmath361 given in eq.([expa ] ) .",
    "the convergence in terms of @xmath5 has been found to be fast , and use of around 20 adiabatic terms is enough to get a converged result .",
    "however , the summation over @xmath136 is much more delicate .",
    "in fact , in the @xmath98-regions where the discrepancy between the old calculation and the benchmark was found , the number of hyperspherical harmonics needed in eq.([eq47 ] ) can be pretty high .",
    "this is shown in fig.[fig6 ] , where we show the same cross sections as in fig.[fig4 ] for the cases 1 and 2 .",
    "the benchmark result is given by the solid circles and the old computed cross sections , as shown in fig.[fig4 ] , are given by the dashed curves .",
    "the cross sections obtained with the new procedure have been computed including 35 adiabatic terms in the expansion in eq.([eq47 ] ) , and the number of hyperspherical harmonics used in the same expansion are 1200 for the dotted curves , 1800 for the thin - solid curves , and 3000 for the thick - solid curve .    needless to say , when the same procedure is used to compute the cross sections for the cases 3 and 4 , the same results as the ones shown for these two cases in fig.[fig5 ] are obtained .",
    "as we can see , in the regions where the results shown in fig.[fig3 ] were matching the benchmark , the new calculations still reproduce the results equally well .",

    "as already mentioned , the agreement is actually reached when a sufficiently high number of hyperspherical harmonics is included in the calculation .",
    "in fact , as we can see , 1200 hyperspherical harmonics are still not enough , and 1800 of them are at least needed in case 2 , and 3000 in case 1 .    for completeness",
    ", we also show the results for the two benchmark calculations given in ref.@xcite corresponding to an incident energy in the laboratory frame of 42.0 mev .",

    "now this happens for values of @xmath98 around 13 mev and 40.5 mev .",
    "for this reason , an accurate calculation of the cross section for case 5 in the vicinity of these two @xmath98-values requires use of the expansion given in eq.([eq41 ] ) . for case 6",
    "the value of the hyperangle @xmath191 is always far from zero ( as in the cases 3 and 4 shown in fig.[fig5 ] ) , and use of the expansion in eq.([eq26 ] ) is enough to get a sufficient accuracy in the calculations .    the upper part of fig.[fig7 ] shows the corresponding cross sections .",
    "the dot - dashed and dashed curves are the quartet ( @xmath183 ) and doublet ( @xmath347 ) contributions , respectively .",
    "the total cross section is given by the solid curves .",
    "as we can see , the agreement with the benchmark calculations ( solid circles ) given in ref.@xcite is very good . in case 5 the convergence in the vicinity of the two peaks , computed through eq.([eq41 ] ) , has required inclusion of up to 40 adiabatic terms in the expansion of the three - body wave function ( see eq.([eq17 ] ) ) .",
    "this number is higher than in the calculations for @xmath328 mev , where even less than 30 adiabatic channels were enough .",
    "this is because for a given value of the hyperradius @xmath30 only the adiabatic potentials whose value at @xmath30 is smaller than the incident energy ( or close enough to the energy if they are above ) contribute to the radial wave functions @xmath272 obtained through eq.([radeq ] ) .",

    "the description of three - body systems , and in particular of @xmath0 reactions , by use of the adiabatic expansion method has been proved to be efficient provided that the integral relations introduced in ref.@xcite are used . because of these two relations the @xmath1-matrix of the reaction can be extracted from the internal part of the wave function , and subsequently the pattern of convergence of the adiabatic expansion is fast .",
    "knowledge of the @xmath1-matrix permits then to obtain accurate results for the total cross sections for the different open channels ( elastic , inelastic , transfer , or breakup ) .",
    "however , even if the @xmath1-matrix and the total cross sections can be accurately computed , it is not obvious that the differential cross sections that one extracts from the @xmath1-matrix are also accurate .",
    "in fact , the calculation of the differential cross sections requires knowledge of not only of the @xmath1-matrix , but of the full transition amplitude .",
    "when the adiabatic expansion is applied to obtain the transition amplitude , the number of adiabatic terms necessary in order to achieve convergence strongly depends on the geometry of the outgoing particles , and under some circumstances this number can be exceedingly large .    in this work we have given the details of how to compute differential cross sections for 1 + 2 reactions above the threshold for breakup of the dimer .",
    "the expressions that permit to transform the cross sections from the center of mass frame to the laboratory frame have been derived .",
    "the three - body wave function describing the three - body system as well as the transition amplitude are computed by use of the adiabatic expansion method .",
    "the case of neutron - deuteron breakup has been taken as a test , and our results have been compared with the benchmark calculations described in refs.@xcite .",
    "six different geometries have been considered for the three outgoing nucleons after the breakup .    in general , the agreement with the benchmark results has been found to be good .",
    "the only discrepancy appears in those cases corresponding to two outgoing particles flying away together after the breakup with zero relative energy . in this case",
    "the adiabatic expansion of the transition amplitude is not convenient , since the number of adiabatic terms needed to reproduce such structure is too large .",
    "we have shown that this problem can be solved by skipping the partial wave expansion of the outgoing wave , and expressing the transition amplitude in terms of a full , non - expanded , outgoing plane wave .",
    "this calculation is much more demanding from the numerical point of view , and special care has to be taken with the number of hyperspherical harmonics used to describe the incoming wave function .",
    "this study can be seen as a first step in the inclusion of the coulomb interaction in the study of 1 + 2 nuclear processes .",
    "preliminary studies using the ha expansion have been done in ref .",
    "@xcite for the elastic channel of the @xmath366 reaction . in the breakup case , eq.([eq47 ] ) can not be applied directly since the free plane wave was used in its derivation , and it should be replaced by a distorted wave due to the long range of the coulomb potential .",
    "this study is at present underway following the analysis given in ref.@xcite .",
    "however , it should be noticed that the configuration in which two protons move away together is suppressed and the one in which a neutron - proton pair moves away together far from the second proton shows tiny coulomb effects ( see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "hence , we expect to extend the analysis here presented to the @xmath366 case , and in general to @xmath0 nuclear processes allowing us to analyze several reactions of astrophysical interest in which the inclusion of the coulomb interaction can not be avoided .",

    "<S> general expressions for the breakup cross sections in the lab frame for @xmath0 reactions are given in terms of the hyperspherical adiabatic basis . </S>",
    "<S> the three - body wave function is expanded in this basis and the corresponding hyperradial functions are obtained by solving a set of second order differential equations . the @xmath1-matrix is computed by using two recently derived integral relations . even though the method is shown to be well suited to describe @xmath0 processes , </S>",
    "<S> there are nevertheless particular configurations in the breakup channel ( for example those in which two particles move away close to each other in a relative zero - energy state ) that need a huge number of basis states . </S>",
    "<S> this pathology manifests itself in the extremely slow convergence of the breakup amplitude in terms of the hyperspherical harmonic basis used to construct the adiabatic channels . to overcome </S>",
    "<S> this difficulty the breakup amplitude is extracted from an integral relation as well . for the sake of illustration </S>",
    "<S> , we consider neutron - deuteron scattering . </S>",
    "<S> the results are compared to the available benchmark calculations . </S>"
