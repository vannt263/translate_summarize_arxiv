    "mkn  501 , an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) at a redshift @xmath5 , was discovered several years ago as a faint source of tev @xmath0-radiation ( quinn et al .",
    "@xcite ; bradbury et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in 1997",
    "it turned into a state of high activity , unique in both its strength and duration .",
    "the tev emission of the source from march to september 1997 was characterized by a strongly variable flux .",
    "it was on average more than three times larger than the flux of the crab nebula , the strongest known persistent tev source in the sky .",
    "fortunately , the time period of the outburst coincided with the source visibility windows of several ground - based imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( iacts ) designed for the detection of very high energy ( vhe ) cosmic @xmath0-rays .",
    "thus almost continuous monitoring of mkn  501 in tev @xmath0-rays with several iacts ( cat , hegra , tactic , telescope array , whipple ) located in the northern hemisphere was possible ( e.g. protheroe et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the observations of mkn  501 by the hegra stereoscopic iact system during this long outburst made a detailed study of the temporal and spectral characteristics of the source possible , based on an unprecedented statistics of more than 38,000 tev photons ( aharonian et al .",
    "@xcite ; hereafter paper  1 ) .",
    "the `` background - free '' detection of @xmath0-rays , with an average rate of several hundred @xmath0-rays per hour ( against @xmath6 background events caused by charged cosmic rays ) , allowed us to determine statistically significant signals for @xmath7 minute intervals during much of the 110  h observation time , spread over 6 months .",
    "moreover , it was possible to monitor the energy spectrum of the source on a daily basis . within the errors the energy spectrum maintained a constant form over the range from 1 tev to 10 tev .",
    "this was the case even though the flux varied strongly on time scales @xmath8 day .",
    "we believe that this is an important result , and it was to some extent unexpected .    the diurnal spectra exhibit a power - law shape at low energies ( between 1 tev and several tev ) , with a gradual steepening towards higher energies ( paper 1 ) . such a spectral form could not be unequivocally ensured in the first analysis which was performed during the period of activity of the source , since the systematic errors of the recently commissioned stereoscopic system of hegra",
    "were not well studied at this time . as a consequence , the energy spectrum",
    "could not be determined more precisely than implied by a power law fit ( aharonian et al .",
    "@xcite ) , even though the tendency for a gradual steepening of the observed spectra was noticed ( aharonian et al .  @xcite ) .",
    "the results of paper 1 and the new results in a broader energy interval presented below are based on detailed systematic studies ( see paper 1 and konopelko et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and extend and supersede these previous results . this allowed us to come to the definite conclusion that the spectrum determined in the energy region from 1 to 10 tev steepens significantly ( paper 1 ) .",
    "a similar tendency has been found also by the whipple ( samuelson et al .",
    "@xcite ) , telescope array ( kajino et al .  1999 , private communication ) , and cat ( djannati - atai et al .",
    "@xcite ) groups .",
    "independent spectral measurements by the hegra telescopes ct1 and ct2 will be published elsewhere .",
    "apart from its astrophysical significance , the constancy of the spectral shape has the important practical consequence that it allows to measure the spectrum with small statistical errors also in the energy regions below 1 tev and above 10 tev .",
    "indeed , the low photon statistics of the detector in both `` extreme '' energy bands ( towards low energies basically due to the decrease of the detector s collection area ; towards high energies due to the steep photon spectrum ) can be drastically increased by using the data accumulated over the whole period of observations .    in sect .  2 we describe the hegra stereoscopic system and the specific form of the data analysis , based on monte carlo simulations of both , the air showers and the detection system .",
    "the data sample is the same as in paper 1 and is described in sect .",
    "a detailed study of the systematic errors in the spectrum derivation is contained in sect . 4 ;",
    "most of this methodology was actually developed in the context of the mkn 501 data analysis .",
    "we believe that this is the first study of this kind .",
    "the experimental results are then presented in sect .  5 , whereas sect .  6",
    "attempts a first discussion .",
    "this discussion concentrates on the @xmath0-ray results of sect .  5 and what one can learn from them alone .",
    "a multiwavelength analysis is clearly outside the scope of this paper .",
    "our conclusions are contained in sect .",
    "readers only interested in the astrophysical results , should skip sect .  2 - 4 and proceed to sect .",
    "the vhe @xmath0-ray observatory of the hegra collaboration consists of six imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( iacts ) located on the roque de los muchachos on the canary island of la palma , at 2200  m above sea level .",
    "a prototype telescope ( ct1 ) started operation in 1992 and has undergone significant hardware upgrades since then .",
    "this telescope continues to operate as an independent instrument .",
    "the stereoscopic system of cherenkov telescopes consists of five telescopes ( ct2 - ct6 ) , and has been taking data since 1996 , initially with three and four telescopes , and since 1998 as a complete five - telescope system .",
    "four of the telescopes ( ct2 , ct4 , ct5 , ct6 ) are arranged in the corners of a square with roughly 100 m side length , and one telescope ( ct3 ) is located in the center of the square . during 1997 ,",
    "when the data discussed in this paper were taken , ct2 was still used as stand alone detector .",
    "the telescopes have an 8.5 m@xmath9 tessellated reflector , focusing the cherenkov light onto a camera with 271 photomultipliers ( pmts ) , covering a field of view of @xmath10 in diameter .",
    "a telescope is triggered when the signal in at least two adjacent pmts exceeds an amplitude of 10 ( before june 1997 ) or 8 ( after june 1997 ) photoelectrons ; in order to trigger the ct system and to initiate the readout of data , at least two telescopes have to trigger simultaneously .",
    "typical trigger rates are in the 10 - 16 hz range .",
    "the pmt signals are digitized and recorded by 120 mhz flash - adcs .",
    "the telescope hardware is described by hermann ( @xcite ) ; the trigger system and its performance are reviewed by bulian et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .      the routine data analysis",
    "( see paper 1 for details ) includes a screening of data to exclude data sets taken at poor weather conditions or with hardware problems . in particular ,",
    "the mean system trigger rate proved to be a sensitive diagnostic tool .",
    "reconstruction of data involves the deconvolution of flash - adc data ( hess et al .",
    "@xcite ) , the calibration and flat - fielding of the cameras , the determination of hillas image parameters , and the reconstruction of geometrical shower parameters based on the stereoscopic views of the air shower obtained with the different telescopes ( daum et al .",
    "@xcite , aharonian et al.@xcite ) .",
    "the characteristic angular resolution for individual @xmath0-rays is @xmath11 ; by sophisticated procedures @xmath0-ray sources can be located with sub - arcminute precision ( phlhofer et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the separation of hadronic and electromagnetic showers is based on the shape of the cherenkov images , in particular using the _ width _ parameter .",
    "the width of each image is normalized to the average _ width _ of a @xmath0-ray image for a given impact parameter of the shower relative to the telescope , and a given image intensity . here",
    ", impact distances are obtained from the stereoscopic reconstruction of the shower geometry .",
    "cuts are then applied to the _ mean scaled width _ obtained by averaging the scaled width values over telescopes . for a point source both the _ pointing _ information and the image _ shape _ information are used .",
    "each of them provides a cosmic - ray background rejection of up to 100 .",
    "the reconstruction of the energy of air showers is based on the relation between the shower energy and the image intensity ( _ size _ ) at a given distance from the shower axis ( aharonian et al .",
    "this relation is tabulated based on monte carlo simulations , with the zenith angle of the shower as an additional parameter .",
    "the distance between a given telescope and the shower core is known from the stereoscopic reconstruction of the shower , with a typical precision of 10 m or less , for not too distant showers .",
    "the energy estimates from the different telescopes are then averaged , taking into account the slightly different sensitivities of the telescopes .",
    "these sensitivities are calibrated to 1% by comparing the light yield in two telescopes for events with cores halfway between the two telescopes ( hofmann @xcite ) . according to monte carlo simulations",
    ", this energy reconstruction provides an energy resolution of 15% to 20% , depending on the selection of the event sample .",
    "any quantitative analysis of iact data has to rely on detailed monte carlo simulations to evaluate the detection characteristics of the instrument .    the simulation of air showers and of cherenkov light emission ( konopelko et al .",
    "@xcite ) includes all relevant elementary processes . on their trajectory to the detector ,",
    "photons may be lost by ozone absorption , mie scattering , and rayleigh scattering .",
    "atmospheric density profiles , ozone profiles and aerosol densities have been checked against local experimental data where available ( e.g.  hemberger @xcite ) .    on the detector side ,",
    "the simulations include the wavelength dependence of the mirror reflectivity , of the light collection system , and of the pmt quantum efficiency .",
    "the point spread function of the mirror system is modeled after measurements of images of bright stars .",
    "the readout electronics is simulated in significant detail .",
    "pmt output waveforms are modeled by superimposing the response to single photoelectrons , with their relative timing and amplitude smearing .",
    "these signals are then sampled , quantitized , and fed into the same analysis path as regular flash - adc data .",
    "the simulation includes the measured saturation effects both in the pmt / preamplifier and in the flash - adc .",
    "details concerning the monte carlo simulation used here , the performance of the system , and the comparison with experimental data are described by konopelko et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the analysis is based on the same data sample as used in paper 1 , corresponding to a total exposure time of 110  h , between march and october of 1997 .",
    "mrk 501 was observed in the so - called wobble mode , with the source positioned @xmath12 in declination away from the optical axis of the telescopes , alternating every 20 min . for background subtraction , an equivalent region displaced by the same amount in the opposite direction",
    "the separation of @xmath13 of these on - source and off - source regions is large compared to the angular resolution of the telescope system . in total",
    ", the sample comprises about 38,000 @xmath0-ray events .",
    "to select @xmath0-ray candidates , the same loose cuts were applied as in paper 1 . in particular ,",
    "the reconstructed shower direction had to be within @xmath14 from the source , and the _ mean scaled width _",
    "parameter had to be less than 1.2 .",
    "events were accepted up to a maximum impact parameter of 200  m from the central telescope ct3 .",
    "events with larger impact parameters frequently suffer from truncated images in the cameras and , due to small angles between the stereo views , have larger uncertainties on the shower parameters .",
    "since the analysis presented in the following emphasizes the control of systematic errors , it was felt that in this case the advantage of having clean events and a well - defined effective area at large energies  basically all events within the 200  m radius trigger above a few tev  outweighs the gain in statistics which could have been achieved by accepting all events .- ray selection cuts , respectively . ] for the following analysis a software threshold of two or more triggered telescopes , each with at least 40 recorded photoelectrons was used .",
    "properties of this mrk 501 data sample were examined in detail in paper 1 .",
    "compared to single iacts , stereoscopic iact systems permit drastic reduction of systematic errors , in particular for tasks like the precision determination of energy spectra . using the redundant information provided by the multiple views , essentially all relevant characteristics , such as the radial distribution of cherenkov light or the trigger probabilities of the telescopes can be verified experimentally ( see also hofmann @xcite )",
    ". simultaneous sampling of the intensity of the cherenkov light front in different locations emphasizes the calorimetric nature of the energy determination , and reduces the effect of local fluctuations .",
    "finally , given the unambiguous reconstruction of the shower geometry and the fact that at energies of one tev virtually all events within 100  m from the central telescope trigger the system , and that above a few tev almost all events within 200  m trigger , the effective detection area above 1 tev can be basically defined by pure geometry , without relying on simulations .",
    "only the threshold region requires a critical consideration .    under ideal conditions , the differential energy spectrum of the incident radiation",
    "is determined as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the measured rate of @xmath0-rays of energy @xmath17 after background subtraction , @xmath18 is the effective detection area and @xmath19 is the efficiency of the cuts applied to isolate the signal and to suppress the background . the effective area and",
    "the cut efficiencies are usually derived from monte carlo simulations .",
    "a complication arises from the finite energy resolution , described by the response function @xmath20 , the probability that a @xmath0-ray of energy @xmath17 is reconstructed at an energy @xmath21 .",
    "the measured rate is hence given by the convolution @xmath22 eq .",
    "[ eqb ] can no longer be trivially inverted to yield @xmath23 .",
    "options to find @xmath23 include the explicit deconvolution using a suitable algorithm , which will usually make some assumption concerning the smoothness of the spectrum .",
    "another approach is to assume a certain functional form for the shape of the spectrum , and to determine free parameters such as the flux and the spectral index from a fit of eq .",
    "[ eqb ] to the data .",
    "finally , one can absorb the effect of the energy smearing into a modified effective area @xmath24 , defined such that eq .",
    "[ eqa ] holds .",
    "the latter approach is the simplest , but has the disadvantage that now @xmath24 depends on the assumed shape of the spectrum .",
    "however , with the @xmath25 energy resolution provided by the hegra ct system , shape - dependent corrections are negligible for most practical purposes , and results are stable after one iteration .",
    "therefore , while both other techniques were pursued , the final results are based on this third method .",
    "the typical energy dependence of the effective area is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_area ] .",
    "below 1 tev , the effective detection area rises steeply with energy , and then saturates at around @xmath26 m@xmath9 .",
    "the saturation reflects the cut on a maximum distance from the central telescope of 200  m.    the technical implementation of the energy reconstruction and flux determination is described in detail in paper 1 .",
    "compared to the brief discussion given above , a main complication for real data arises from the dependence of @xmath24 on the zenith angle @xmath27 , which varies during runs and from run to run . in order to be able to interpolate between monte carlo - generated effective areas at certain discrete zenith angles ,",
    "a semi - empirical scaling law is exploited , which relates the effective areas at different zenith angles .",
    "the variation of zenith angles with time is accounted for through replacing eq .",
    "[ eqa ] by the sum over all events recorded within the observation time @xmath28 @xmath29 where each event is weighted with the appropriate effective area , given its energy and zenith angle .",
    "note that for each period of a certain hardware configuration a set of effective areas is used which has been determined from the monte carlo simulations which model in detail the specific hardware performance , i.e.  which take into account the trigger configuration and the mirror point spread function ( see paper 1 ) .",
    "the key aspect in a precise and reliable determination of @xmath0-ray spectra is the control of systematic errors .",
    "sources of systematic errors include , e.g. ,    * systematic errors in the determination of the absolute energy scale . * deviations from the linearity of the energy reconstruction , caused e.g. by threshold effects at very low energies , and possible saturation effects in the pmts or the electronics at very high energies .",
    "* systematic errors in the determination of the effective area @xmath24 ; particularly critical is the threshold region , where @xmath24 is a very steep function of @xmath17 . * systematic errors in the determination of the ( energy - dependent ) efficiency of the angular and image shape cuts .",
    "as discussed in detail in appendix a , a non - accurate modeling of the detector response or the atmospheric transmission possibly results in 1 ) a shift in the energy scale of the reconstructed @xmath0-ray spectrum , and 2 ) a distortion of the shape of the spectrum .",
    "most systematic uncertainties , e.g.  mirror reflectivities and pmt quantum efficiencies , exclusively contribute to an error of the energy scale .",
    "the calculations in appendix a show that the curvature of the spectrum is reconstructed correctly provided that the monte carlo simulations accurately model the correlation between the detector threshold and the reconstructed energies including the fluctuations involved .",
    "if the monte carlo description of this correlation is incorrect , the energies reconstructed in data and the effective areas computed from monte carlo simulations do not match . a shift of the reconstructed energies by a factor @xmath30 relative to the effective area @xmath24 used for the evaluation of the spectrum results in a flux error of @xmath31 the flux error is potentially large in the threshold region , where @xmath24 varies quickly with @xmath17 , @xmath32 with @xmath33 and @xmath34 , but is negligible at high energies , where @xmath24 is constant , and is simply governed by the geometrical cuts ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the remainder of this section is dedicated to a discussion of the various sources of systematic errors .",
    "a crucial input for the determination of shower energies is of course the expected light yield as a function of core distance .",
    "since the average core distance varies significantly with energy , inadequacies in the assumed relation will not only worsen the energy resolution , but will systematically distort the spectrum .",
    "with the redundant information provided by a system of cherenkov telescopes , it is possible to actually measure the light yield as a function of the distance from the shower core and to verify the simulations ( aharonian et al .",
    "@xcite ) . briefly",
    ", the idea is to select showers with a fixed impact parameter relative to a telescope a , and with a fixed light yield in this telescope .",
    "this provides a sample of showers of constant energy , and now the light yield in other telescopes can be measured as a function of core distance .",
    "[ fig_yield ] shows the characteristic shape of the light pool for @xmath0-ray showers , which is well reproduced by the simulation ; this holds also for the variation of the shape with shower energy and zenith angle ( aharonian et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "a second key ingredient in the energy determination is the reconstruction of the core location . unlike in the case of the angular resolution , where it is easy to show that the simulation reproduces the data by comparing the distribution of shower directions relative to the source with the simulations , a direct check of the precision of the core reconstruction is not possible .",
    "however , noting that two telescopes suffice for a stereoscopic reconstruction , one can split up the four - telescope system into two systems of two telescopes and compare the results ( hofmann @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ fig_res]a illustrates the difference in core coordinates between the two subsystems for data and for the monte carlo simulations . as can be recognized the monte carlo simulations accurately predict the distribution of the distances between the two cores .",
    "under the assumption that the two measurements are uncorrelated and that the reconstruction accuracy achieved with two telescopes is the same for two telescope and four telescope events the width of the difference distribution should be @xmath35 times the resolution of a two - telescope system . by this means",
    ", the 2 telescope resolution is determined to be @xmath36  m. the monte carlo simulations show , that this reconstruction accuracy does indeed agree nicely with the true reconstruction accuracy for 2 telescope events .",
    "+    the same technique can be used to study the energy resolution ( fig .",
    "[ fig_res]b ; see also hofmann @xcite ) . also here",
    "the data is in excellent agreement with the simulations . in this case , the monte carlo studies predict , that the energies measured with the two subsystems are considerably correlated : assuming uncorrelated estimates , an energy resolution of @xmath37 is inferred ; the monte carlo simulations predict a true energy resolution for two telescope events of 23% . on the basis of simulations , fluctuations in the shower height",
    "can be identified as the origin of this correlation .",
    "work is ongoing to use the stereoscopic determination of the shower height to improve the energy resolution .",
    "the excellent agreement between data and monte carlo simulations confirms that the experimental effects entering the energy determination are well under control , and that consequently the estimate of the energy resolution based on the simulations is reliable .",
    "the absolute energy calibration of iacts is a significant challenge , lacking a suitable monoenergetic test beam .",
    "factors entering the absolute energy calibration are the production of cherenkov light in the shower , the properties and the transparency of the atmosphere , and the response of the detection system involving mirror reflectivities , pmt quantum efficiencies , electronics calibration factors etc . so far , mainly three techniques were used to calibrate the hegra telescopes :    * the comparison between predicted and measured cosmic - ray detection rates . given the integral spectral index of 1.7 for cosmic rays , an error @xmath38 in the energy scale results in an error of @xmath39 in the rate above a given threshold .",
    "apart from the slightly different longitudinal evolution of hadronic and of @xmath0-ray induced showers , this test checks all factors entering the calibration .",
    "the monte carlo simulations reproduce the measured cosmic - ray trigger rates within 10% ( konopelko et al .",
    "the iact system was furthermore used to determine the flux of cosmic - ray protons in the 1.3 to 10  tev energy range ( aharonian et al .",
    "the measured flux of protons @xmath40 @xmath41 excellently agrees with a fit to the combined data of all other experiments , indicating that systematics are well under control and that the assigned systematic errors  partially related to the energy scale  are rather conservative .",
    "* given the measured characteristics of the telescope components such as mirrors or pmts , the sensitivity of the telescopes can be determined with an overall error of 22% .",
    "* using a distant , calibrated , pulsed light source , an overall calibration of the response of the telescope and its readout electronics could be achieved , with a precision of 10% ( fra",
    "@xcite ) .    the last three techniques have to rely on the monte carlo simulations of the shower and of the atmospheric transparency .",
    "while monte carlo simulations have converged and different codes produce consistent results , details of the atmospheric model and assumptions concerning aerosol densities can change the cherenkov light yield on the ground by about 8% ( hemberger 1998 ) .    within their errors ,",
    "all calibration techniques are consistent .",
    "overall , we believe that a 15% systematic error on the energy scale is conservative , given the state of simulations and understanding of the instrument . based on the comparison with cosmic - ray rates , one would conclude that the actual calibration uncertainty is below 10% .      as discussed earlier in detail , the threshold region is very susceptible to systematic errors . in the sub - threshold regime events trigger only because of upward fluctuations in the light yield , and energy estimates tend to be biased towards larger values .",
    "[ fig_ereco ] shows the mean reconstructed energy as a function of the true energy for a sample of simulated events at typical zenith angles .",
    "note that for the 1997 data set we have a noticeable number of detected @xmath0-rays events below 500 gev .",
    "however in this energy region the bias is so strong that a reliable correction is no longer possible .",
    "therefore spectra will only be quoted above this energy .",

    "independent tests of saturation and saturation corrections were provided by omitting , both in the data and in the simulation , the highest pixels in the image , and by comparing event samples in different ranges of core distance and zenith angle .",
    "the saturation effect is non - negligible only at very high energies , namely @xmath56 .",

    "finally , the exponential cutoff in the observed tev spectrum could be caused by @xmath0-@xmath0 absorption of tev photons in a possible dust torus surrounding the agn ( protheroe & biermann @xcite ) and in the extragalactic diffuse background radiation ( nikishov @xcite , gould & schreder @xcite , jelly @xcite , stecker et al .",

    "this effect could be explained by a significant increase in each of the three parameters which determine the position of the synchrotron peak , i.e. the maximum electron energy @xmath127 , the magnetic field @xmath128 , and the jet doppler factor @xmath117 .",
    "the rather stable energy spectrum of tev radiation implies that the spectrum of the parent electrons does not significantly vary during the hegra observations , the latter performed with typical integration times between one and two hours .",
    "the condition of a constant acceleration spectrum does not yet guarantee a stable energy spectrum of tev radiation .",

    "the lack of correlation between spectral shape and absolute flux , as well as the very fact that @xmath0-rays with energy @xmath135 are observed , could also be explained , perhaps even in a more natural way , by the assumption of a ` @xmath120-decay ' origin of the @xmath0 -radiation . yet",
    "the efficiency of this mechanism in the jet appears to be too low to explain the observed time variability and the high fluxes of the tev radiation .",

    "[ fig1_dis ] and [ fig2_dis ] , curves 2 . a slight increase of the debra density by as little as a factor of 1.5 leads to a dramatic ( exponential ) deviation of the reconstructed spectrum at",
    "the highest observed @xmath0-ray energies around 16 tev from the @xmath195 power - law extrapolation .",
    "a power law with @xmath196 would give similar and complementary results .",
    "the resulting source spectra ( fig .",
    "[ fig2_dis ] ) and the upper limits on the debra density ( fig .",
    "[ fig1_dis ] ) obtained in this way assuming power - law spectra for debra with @xmath192 and 3 , are given by the curves 2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "the power law @xmath197 corresponding to @xmath198 complements fig .",
    "[ fig1_dis ] .",
    "it should be noted however that any realistically expected spectrum of the debra in a broad range of wavelengths deviates from a simple power - law .",
    "in fact , all models of the debra , independently of the details , predict two pronounced peaks in the spectrum at 1  @xmath199 m and 100  @xmath199 m contributed by the emission of the stars and of the interstellar dust , respectively , and a relatively flat ` valley ' at mid ir wavelengths around 10  @xmath200 m ( see e.g. dwek et al .",
    "the strong impact of the debra spectrum on calculations of the opacity of the intergalactic medium has been emphasized by dwek & slavin ( @xcite ) and macminn and primack ( @xcite ) .",
    "note that the power law with @xmath201 characterizes the shape of the spectrum of debra at near ir wavelengths , typically between 1 and several microns , and the power - law with @xmath202 characterizes the debra between 10 and 100 microns .",
    "interestingly , the sum of these two power law spectra `` reproduces '' a reasonable shape of the ` valley ' .",
    "this is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1_dis ] and fig .",
    "[ fig3_dis ] where the measured fluxes or estimated upper and lower limits obtained directly at different wavelengths of the debra are shown .",
    "finally , an interesting numerical criterion for the derivation of upper limits on the debra was suggested by biller et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "it relies on independent @xmath0-ray observations . a variant of this approach , where the additional restriction forbids a differential source spectrum harder than @xmath203 within the observed energy range , is shown by the horizontal bars in fig .  [ fig1_dis ] .",
    "the results described above could be `` improved '' assuming a more realistic , @xmath204 optical depth for the @xmath197 power law branch at short wavelengths , and a steeper , @xmath205 , power law branch at long wavelengths ( see fig .  [ fig3_dis ] ) .",
    "the latter choice for @xmath0 is due to the rapid rise of the data points towards far infrared wavelengths @xmath206 in order to fit the recent measurements of the flux at @xmath207 by dirbe aboard the cobe satellite . for the far infrared ( fir )",
    "branch the absolute flux of the power - law with @xmath205 is chosen again from the condition that the differential @xmath0-ray source spectrum should not exponentially rise at energies up to @xmath208 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4_dis ] ) .",
    "note also that the criterion of @xmath204 for the @xmath197 branch at short wavelengths is pretty close to the level of the flux of the recent tentative detection of debra at @xmath209 ( dwek & arendt @xcite ) .",
    "the sum of the nir and fir power - law branches with the above indices and absolute fluxes results in a deeper mid ir `` valley '' and predicts a very steep spectrum of debra between 30 and 100 @xmath174 . in figs .",
    "[ fig3_dis ] and [ fig4_dis ] this spectrum has been truncated at @xmath210 that corresponds to the kinematic threshold of pair production at interactions with the maximum observed energy of @xmath0-rays of about 20 tev .",
    "the spectrum is also truncated at @xmath211 in order to avoid significant excess compared with the fluxes at optical / uv wavelengths recently derived from the hubble deep field analysis ( pozzetti et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the effect of `` reconstruction '' of the @xmath0-ray spectra of mkn 501 corresponding to this `` best estimate '' of debra between 1 and 80 @xmath200 m is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig4_dis ] .",
    "it shows , in the simple absorption picture ( using two truncated power - laws ) that even a conservative choice for the debra field implies intergalactic extinction at all observed energies .",
    "especially the reconstructed spectrum around 1 tev could be considerably harder than the observed spectrum , with a maximum of @xmath212 at 2 tev ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_spectrum ] ) .",
    "this also demonstrates that it would be dangerous to interpret the observed spectral slope at low energies in terms of a power law extending from still lower energies .",
    "the discussion of intergalactic @xmath115 absorption effects is in principle incomplete without considering secondary radiations .",
    "briefly , when a @xmath0-ray is absorbed by pair production , its energy is not lost .",
    "the secondary electron - positron pairs create new @xmath0-rays via inverse compton scattering on the 2.7 k mbr .",
    "the new @xmath0-rays produce more pairs , and thus an electromagnetic cascade develops ( berezinsky et al .",
    "@xcite , protheroe & stanev @xcite , aharonian et al .",
    "in fact , in our discussion of absorption we have neglected any secondary @xmath0-rays in the field of view of the detector and we finally turn now to these .    for a primary @xmath0-ray spectrum @xmath66 harder than @xmath213 , extending to energies @xmath214 , the cascade spectrum at tev energies could strongly dominate over the primary @xmath0-ray spectrum .",
    "in addition , the spectrum of the cascade @xmath0-rays that reach the observer has a standard form independent of the primary source spectrum with a characteristic photon index of @xmath215 at energies between @xmath216 and an exponential cutoff determined by the condition @xmath217 .",
    "thus , somewhat surprisingly , the measured time - averaged spectrum of mkn  501 can in principle be fitted by a cascade @xmath0-ray spectrum for a reasonable debra flux level of about @xmath218 , provided that the _",
    "invisible _ source spectrum extends well beyond 25 tev , say up to 100 tev .",
    "for an intergalactic magnetic field ( igmf ) @xmath219 the cascade @xmath0-rays could be observed in the form of an extended emission from a giant pair halo with a radius up to several degrees formed around the central source ( aharonian et al .",
    "although the possible extinction of @xmath0-rays from mkn  501 , at least above 10 tev , unavoidably implies the formation of a pair halo , the tev radiation of mkn  501 can not be attributed to such a halo simply due to arguments based on the detected angular size and the time variability of the radiation .",
    "however , the speculative assumption of an extremely low igmf still allows an interpretation of the observed tev @xmath0-rays of mkn  501 within the hypothesis of a cascade origin .",
    "instead of extended and persistent halo radiation , we expect in this case that the cascade @xmath0-rays penetrate from the source to the observer almost on a straight line . yet at cosmological distances to the source even very small deflections of the cascade electrons by the igmf lead to significant time delays of the arriving @xmath0-rays : @xmath220 ( plaga @xcite ) .",
    "this implies that in order to see more or less synchronous activity ( within several days or less ) of mkn  501 at different wavelengths , as was observed during multiwavelength observations of the source ( see e.g. pian et al .",
    "@xcite ) , we would have to require @xmath221 .",
    "although indeed quite speculative , such small magnetic fields on spatial scales large compared to 1 mpc can not be _ a priori _ excluded ( e.g. kronberg @xcite ) .",
    "in this paper we have presented the 1997 mkn 501 time averaged spectrum as measured with the hegra iact system in the energy range from 500 gev to 24 tev .",
    "the absence of strong temporal evolution as well as a significant correlation of the emission strength and the spectral shape in the energy region from 500 gev to 15 tev made the determination of a time averaged spectrum astrophysically meaningful .",
    "due to unprecedented @xmath0-ray statistics and the 20% energy resolution of the instrument , it was possible to detect for the first time @xmath0-rays from an extragalactic source with energies well beyond 10  tev , and to measure a smooth , curved energy spectrum deeply into the exponential regime .",
    "we found , that the spectrum above 0.5 tev is well described by a power law with an exponential cutoff @xmath222 = @xmath223 , the highest recorded photon energies being 16 tev or more .",
    "the detection of tev @xmath0-rays from mkn  501 leads to the unavoidable conclusion that the observed @xmath0-radiation is produced in a relativistic jet with a doppler factor @xmath111 . actually , assuming a pure power - law production spectrum of @xmath0-rays we may naturally explain the exponential cutoff in the observed spectrum spectrum by an internal @xmath0-@xmath0 absorption in the jet . because of the strong dependence of the optical depth on the jet s doppler factor",
    ", this hypothesis gives an accurate determination of the latter , @xmath224 .",
    "remarkably , the uncertainty of this estimate , which is mainly due to the uncertainty in the value of the hubble constant , @xmath225 and in the measured energy of the exponential cutoff @xmath226 , does not exceed @xmath227 .",
    "however , since there could be other reasons for the steepening of the tev spectrum , this estimate can only be considered as a robust lower limit on @xmath117 . in particular , the steepening of the @xmath0-ray spectrum at the highest energies could be attributed to an exponential cutoff in the spectrum of accelerated particles , as well as  in the case of the inverse compton origin of @xmath0-rays  to the klein - nishina effect .",
    "in addition , a modification of the intrinsic ( source ) spectrum of tev @xmath0-rays takes place during their passage through the intergalactic medium .",
    "the recent claims about tentative detections of the diffuse extragalactic background radiation by the dirbe instrument aboard the cobe at near infrared ( @xmath228 ) and far infrared ( @xmath229 ) wavelengths , both at the @xmath230 flux level imply a strong effect of intergalactic @xmath0-@xmath0 extinction on the observed mkn  501 spectrum over the entire energy region measured by hegra .",
    "in particular , the shape of the highest energy part of the observed @xmath0-ray spectrum combined with the dirbe flux at @xmath231 requires a very steep ( @xmath232 with @xmath233 ) spectrum of the debra with a characteristic flux at mid infrared wavelengths ( @xmath234 ) around 1 to 2 @xmath235 . due to the expected flat spectrum of debra at near infrared wavelengths ( close to @xmath236 )",
    "the modification of the @xmath0-ray spectrum is less prominent at energies of a few tev , although the absolute extinction could be very large .",
    "this does not allow us to draw definite conclusions about the absorption effect based on the analysis of the shape of the @xmath0-ray spectrum .",
    "nevertheless , in the case of mkn  501 this ambiguity can be significantly reduced by rather general arguments regarding the @xmath0-ray _",
    "energetics_. indeed , even relatively modest assumption about the optical depth of about @xmath188 which corresponds to a flux of the debra in the k - band ( @xmath237 ) of about @xmath238 creates uncomfortable conditions for any realistic models of the high energy radiation from mrk  501 .",
    "thus , this value of the flux of the debra may be considered as a rather strong upper limit comparable with the dirbe upper limit at this wavelength .    to summarize",
    ", our excursion through the nonthermal physics of agns shows that @xmath0-ray observations alone do not allow a unique interpretation of a spectrum like the one we have presented for mkn  501 , even though one can make a number of highly interesting inferences .",
    "in particular , our current poor knowledge about the intrinsic spectrum of mkn  501 does not allow us to make definite conclusions about the effect of the intergalactic absorption of tev @xmath0-rays . and _ vice versa _ , the uncertainty in the density of debra does not allow us to take into account the effect of the intergalactic absorption , and thus to `` reconstruct '' the intrinsic @xmath0-ray spectrum .",
    "the knowledge of the latter is an obvious condition for the quantitative study of the acceleration and radiation processes in the source .",
    "therefore we believe that decisive progress in this field could be achieved by the analysis of both the spectral and temporal characteristics of x - ray and tev @xmath0-ray emissions obtained during the multiwavelength campaigns of several x - ray selected bl lac objects at different states of activity , and located at different distances within 1 gpc . due to the time variability of such sources",
    "this requires simultaneous observations together with extensive theoretical modeling .",
    "given these we expect to obtain independent knowledge of the diffuse intergalactic radiation fields which can be compared with direct measurements and models of galaxy formation .",
    "we hope that the successful multiwavelength campaigns of mkn 421 and mkn  501 in 1998 with participation of several x - ray satellites and the hegra iact system will provide highly interesting results in this area . + _ acknowledgments_. the support of the german ministry for research and technology bmbf and of the spanish research council cycit is gratefully acknowledged .",

    "we gratefully acknowledge the technical support staff of the heidelberg , kiel , munich , and yerevan institutes .",
    "to illustrate the effect of systematic errors for determination of energies and effective areas in more detail , we consider here the following model . for simplicity , we consider a detector consisting of a single cherenkov telescope , which is located inside a uniformly illuminated cherenkov light pool of area @xmath239 . to good approximation ,",
    "the light yield @xmath240 ( in photons per m@xmath9 ) is proportional to the shower energy , @xmath241 neglecting logarithmic corrections .",
    "the response of the telescope is now characterized by two quantities , namely the total intensity @xmath242 detected in the image ( usually the _ size _ , measured e.g. in units of adc channels , or , with a conversion factor , in units of ` photoelectrons ' ) , and the signal @xmath243 induced in the highest pixel(s ) , which is fed into the trigger circuitry . both @xmath242 and @xmath243 should be proportional to @xmath240 , @xmath244 but they are influenced by rather different factors .",
    "while both @xmath245 and @xmath0 include the mirror reflectivity , the pmt quantum efficiency , and the pmt gain , @xmath243 is to a much higher degree sensitive to the point spread function of the mirror , and to the shape of the signal generated by the pmt . the effective detection area is given by @xmath246 where @xmath247 is the trigger probability for a given value of @xmath243 .",
