    "the study of stable curves and , more generally , stable pointed curves is by now a classical subject .",
    "stable surfaces were introduced by kollr and shepherd - barron in @xcite and it was consequently realized ( see , for instance , @xcite and references therein ) that this definition can be extended to higher - dimensional varieties and pairs .",
    "so the study of ( semi-)log - canonical pairs became an important topic in the theory of singular higher - dimensional varieties .",
    "here we consider two - dimensional log - canonical pairs in which the log - canonical divisor is cartier and has self - intersection equal to 1 , and we give some applications to gorenstein stable surfaces .",
    "first we study the case with non - empty boundary :    [ thm : pairs ] let @xmath0 be a log - canonical pair of dimension 2 with @xmath5 , @xmath1 cartier and ample and @xmath2 .",
    "then @xmath6 belongs to one of the types @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 or @xmath10 described in list  [ list ] .",
    "in particular , theorem [ thm : pairs ] implies that @xmath11 is either the projective plane , a del pezzo surface of degree 1 , the symmetric product @xmath12 of an elliptic curve , or a projective bundle @xmath13 over an elliptic curve with the section of square @xmath14 contracted .",
    "it came rather as a suprise to us that the list is so short and that in each case the underlying surface itself is gorenstein .",
    "the case in which @xmath4 can not be described so precisely , since it includes , for instance , all smooth surfaces of general type with @xmath3 ; however in section [ section : bigandnef ] we give a rough classification , according to the kodaira dimension of a smooth model of @xmath11 ( see theorem [ thm : normal - case ] ) .",
    "although log - canonical pairs are interesting in their own right , our main motivation for proving the above results is that , by a result of kollr , a non - normal gorenstein stable surface gives rise to a pair as in theorem [ thm : pairs ] via normalisation ( see corollary [ cor : main motivation ] ) . in section [ section : applications to moduli ] , we explain how the above pairs can be used to construct stable surfaces and which pairs can occur as normalisations of stable surfaces for given invariants @xmath15 and @xmath16 . in particular , we show that @xmath17 for a gorenstein stable surface @xmath11 with @xmath18 improving upon results in @xcite .",
    "we will study the geometry and moduli of gorenstein stable surfaces with @xmath3 more in detail in a subsequent paper , building on the classification results proven here .",

    "the aim of this section is the classification of gorenstein stable lc pairs with @xmath2 and @xmath22 .",
