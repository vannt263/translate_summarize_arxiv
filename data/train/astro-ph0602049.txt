    "a major challenge still remaining in astronomy is to determine how mass accumulates to form stars .",
    "we now know from observations that almost the entire mass of a star like the sun is gained during a short protostellar stage ( adams et al .",
    "@xcite ) . some of these protostellar objects are luminous yet cool , suggesting the existence of an even briefer phase within which the protostar accretes rapidly from a highly obscuring core ( andr et al .",
    "the existence of this so - called class0 phase , however , highlights the need for the development of models which predict how a protostar abruptly evolves .",
    "a successful model would also predict the total accumulated mass or ` final mass ' , providing a fundamental input for the subsequent stellar evolution .",
    "however , it is debatable whether the development of low mass stars can be described by an evolutionary model or if the systems are simply too complex and diverse .    to further the debate , we require three factors : reliable observations of protostars , models for how cores form and collapse out of a molecular cloud and a means of converting model parameters into observational parameters . here",
    ", we develop a statistical method for comparing observational data to model data and proceed to test the method by making a specific comparison .",
    "this requires us to develop an appropriate technique to compare data within a three dimensional parameter space .",
    "we first introduce , in turn , the data , the model and the interfacing scheme .",
    "the protostellar stage begins soon after the start of collapse of the cloud core .",
    "half of the final stellar mass is gained in the very earliest , deeply embedded phase .",
    "further accretion occurs during the class1 phase while an accretion disk still feeds material in the extended class2 stage .",
    "the number of observable class0 sources at any given instant is relatively small , due to their brief lifespans .",
    "in addition they are difficult to detect since their massive envelopes cause their spectral energy distributions ( sed ) to peak in the far infrared .",
    "consequently , a variety of strategies have been adopted to discover class 0 sources : ( 1 ) large scale imaging for outflows in the optical or near infrared ( nir ; e.g. ziener & eislffel ; stanke et al . ) ; ( 2 ) high resolution processing of iras data ( e.g. hurt & barsony @xcite ; olinger et al .",
    "@xcite ) ; ( 3 ) sub - millimetre or millimetre continuum mapping ( e.g. shirley et al . @xcite ; motte & andr ) ; ( 4 ) deep radio continuum or line surveys ( e.g. bontemps et al .",
    "; bourke et al .",
    "therefore it is evident to keep in mind that source samples are subject to strong selection effects .",
    "we require a statistically significant observational sample of protostars with accurate individual properties .",
    "the latter demand a uniform observational coverage of the entire sed from the nir to the millimetre range .",
    "froebrich @xcite recently presented a catalogue with all known confirmed and candidate class0 sources in the literature .",
    "this catalogue contains 50 objects that possess sufficient observational data to compute the three main source properties ( bolometric temperature and luminosity , envelope mass ; t@xmath0 , l@xmath0 , m@xmath3 ) accurately .",
    "we can potentially test a range of cloud models .",
    "each model assumes a particular environment , with initial conditions , boundary conditions , external forces and feedback effects to be considered ( mac low & klessen @xcite ) .",
    "however , in the present study , our attention is focused on a set of accretion rates obtained from numerical simulations of turbulent clouds ( see  [ gravomod ] ; schmeja & klessen ; hereafter sk04 ) .",
    "the mass distribution of the cores so formed can be compared to the initial mass function and the total mass fraction accumulated in protostellar cores can be related to the overall star - formation efficiency ( klessen @xcite , padoan & nordlund @xcite ) .",
    "these recent numerical studies are able to provide an almost complete model of star formation in clusters , including the formation of disks and binary systems ( see also bate et al .",
    "@xcite ) . as a more fundamental test of these models , we need to compare model predictions to the observable properties of stars caught in the act of forming ( t@xmath0 , l@xmath0 , m@xmath3 ) .",
    "the numerical models used here , as well as the works from other groups ( e.g. bate et al .",
    "@xcite ) are only able to follow the density and velocity of material .",
    "they are hence very useful in obtaining final mass spectra , binary fraction , etc .. however , they are not able to predict observables like bolometric temperature and/or luminosity . to derive those quantities , in principle a 3d radiative transfer calculation",
    "needs to be performed at each time step .",
    "since this is much too time consuming we applied an evolutionary scheme to obtain those quantities ( see sect.[evolmodel ] ) .",
    "alternatively , mass accretion rates can be calculated from theoretical and semi - empirical approaches . in the so - called `` standard solution '' of the collapse of an isothermal sphere ( shu @xcite )",
    "the mass accretion rate is constant at a value of 0.975@xmath4@xmath5 g , where @xmath6 is the sound speed and g the gravitational constant .",
    "larger but also constant accretion rates ( 47@xmath4@xmath5 g ) are found by larson @xcite and penston @xcite for the collapse of initially uniform isothermal spheres .",
    "henriksen et al .",
    "find that mass ejection and mass accretion both decline significantly with time during protostellar evolution .",
    "using a plummer - type density profile whitworth & ward - thompson @xcite predict an accretion rate that possesses a very early peak during the class0 phase and falls off rapidly after the object develops into a class1 protostar .",
    "shu et al .",
    "@xcite obtained similar results through analytical and numerical works .",
    "hydrodynamical simulations of star formation ( foster & chevalier @xcite ; tomisaka @xcite ) controlled by supersonic turbulence ( e.g. klessen @xcite ; sk04 ) yield similar behaviour .    in theory",
    ", there are two means to interface model and observed data sets .",
    "ideal would be to derive a set of mass accretion rates directly from observations of protostellar cores but infall speeds are extremely difficult to measure .",
    "hence , conversely , we convert the mass infall rates from the models into the observable quantities . the main three are the bolometric temperature and luminosity , t@xmath0 and l@xmath0 , and the envelope mass , m@xmath3 .",
    "several such conversion schemes have been developed .",
    "evolutionary models were first discussed by bontemps et al . and saraceno et al . .",
    "along these lines , andr et al .",
    "@xcite took an exponentially decline in both envelope mass and accretion rate to predict l@xmath0-m@xmath3 tracks .",
    "an analytical scheme was presented by myers et al .",
    "they assumed a mass infall rate matching the shu solution at early times and then displaying an exponential fall off with time .",
    "the core which supplies the mass also provides the obscuration , thus fixing evolutionary tracks on a t@xmath0-l@xmath7 diagram .",
    "based on this work , smith (;",
    "s98 hereafter ) presented an evolutionary scheme but adopted alternative analytical forms for the mass accretion ( exponential increase and power law decrease ) which resemble the results obtained by whitworth & ward - thompson @xcite or sk04 .",
    "this evolutionary model , founded on mass transfer between the envelope , disc , protostar and jets , has provided successful interpretations for various sets of observational data ( t@xmath0 , l@xmath0 , m@xmath3 , outflow luminosity ) of class0 and class1 objects ( e.g. davis et al .",
    "@xcite ; yu et al .",
    "@xcite ; stanke @xcite ; froebrich et al .",
    "@xcite ) . here",
    ", we adopt the s98 scheme but replace the analytical accretion rates with those derived numerically .",
    "we note that this scheme does not include any inclination effects that become very important during the class1 phase for t@xmath0 and l@xmath0 determinations .",
    "we thus focus our work on class0 objects .",
    "our approach in this paper is as follows .",
    "we combine different sets of mass accretion rates obtained from gravoturbulent molecular cloud fragmentation calculations ( gt - models ; klessen et al .",
    "@xcite ; klessen @xcite ; appendix[details_gtmodels ] ) , as described in detail in sk04 , and the evolutionary scheme ( e - model ) from s98 ( see also appendix[details_emod ] ) . for each set of mass accretion rates ,",
    "we determine evolutionary tracks in the t@xmath0-l@xmath0-m@xmath3 parameter space and compare them with the distribution of the observed class0 sample .",
    "a 3d - kolmogorov - smirnov test ( ks - test , see also appendix[details_kstest ] ) yields a probability for the two distributions to be drawn from the same basic population ( called _ agreement _ hereafter ) .",
    "the agreement parameter will thus determine how well a model is able to explain the currently available set of observations .",
    "we remark that two separate models ( gt - models and e - models ) are needed to obtain the model protostellar quantities that can be compared to the observational data .",
    "thus , we are only able to determine how well the _ combination _ of _ both _ can explain the observations .",
    "we are not able to decide which model is responsible for potential disagreement with the observations .",
    "however , the variation of free parameters in the models and a search for correlations of the parameter values with the agreement will help to define constraints and provide suggestions for improved model combinations .    in sect.[methods",
    "] we describe the observational data and our models .",
    "results and the discussion are put forward in sect.[analysis ] .",
    "details of the gravoturbulent and evolutionary models and the kolmogorov - smirnov test are described in appendixes[details_gtmodels ] to [ details_kstest ] .",
    "several samples of class0 sources have been published ( e.g. chen et al .",
    "@xcite ; andr et al .",
    "@xcite ; shirley et al . @xcite",
    "; motte & andr ) .",
    "the latest study , which combines all previous ones and computes the object properties uniformly from all published data , is presented by froebrich @xcite . there , a list of 95 confirmed or candidate objects was compiled .",
    "fifty of these sources possess sufficient observational data to be classified as class0 or class0/1 objects and allow us to determine the three source properties t@xmath0 , l@xmath0 , and m@xmath3 accurately . to ensure a reliable comparison of models and observations , we apply the following restrictions to this sample :    \\(1 ) we omit sources that have distances larger than 500pc .",
    "this reduces the bias towards higher mass objects .",
    "\\(2 ) all objects in taurus are underluminous compared to the other sources , considering t@xmath0 and m@xmath3 .",
    "note that this does not only mean a low luminosity for these objects , but rather a low luminosity combined with a high envelope mass .",
    "the three very low luminosity objects in our sample ( see fig.[tracks ] ) combine low luminosity ( 1l@xmath8 ) with low envelope mass ( 0.2m@xmath8 ) and might form ( very ) low mass stars . in total , 25% of the class0 objects in the sample are underluminous .",
    "we exclude them for the comparison between the models and observations ( but see the discussion in sect.[underlumi ] ) .",
    "\\(3 ) a histogram of the number of sources in a certain t@xmath0-bin shows that the observational sample is very incomplete at high bolometric temperatures .",
    "hence the comparison of observations and models is restricted to t@xmath980k .",
    "this selection procedure leaves us with a sample of 27 class0 sources .",
    "this sample consists mostly of objects in perseus , orion and serpens .",
    "we performed numerical simulations of the fragmentation and collapse of turbulent , self - gravitating gas clouds and the resulting formation and evolution of protostars .",
    "we employed a code based on smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ; monaghan ) in order to resolve large density contrasts and to follow the evolution over a long timescale .",
    "the code includes periodic boundary conditions ( klessen @xcite ) and sink particles ( bate et al .",
    "@xcite ) that replace high - density cores while keeping track of mass , linear and angular momentum .",
    "a detailed study of the 24 sets of protostellar mass accretion rates resulting from the gt - models is presented in sk04 ( see also jappsen & klessen ) and we adopt their gt - model notation .",
    "we now define when a model core is considered to be a class0 object .",
    "observationally , a protostar is a class0 source according to the definition given in andr et al .",
    "it is shown by andr et al .",
    "@xcite that this definition is roughly equivalent to the physical state where the mass in the envelope exceeds the mass of the central protostar .",
    "thus , a model protostar is considered a class0 object when ( a ) the mass of the central core exceeds 10@xmath10m@xmath8 ( this corresponds to the time when the second hydrostatic core is formed in the centre ( larson @xcite ) and distinguishes the class0 sources from the pre - stellar core phase ) and ( b ) the mass of the envelope is larger than the mass of the central star .",
    "this separates the class0 from the class1 objects .",
    "small number statistics will always be a major concern when comparing models and observations of class0 objects . in order not to introduce further uncertainties from the model side , we restricted our analysis to those gt - models that possess more than 37 stars and have a numerical resolution of at least 2@xmath110@xmath11 particles .",
    "this leaves 16 out of the 24 sets of accretion rates of sk04 for further analysis .",
    "in addition , accretion rates for individual protostars from the gt - models are smoothed by a viscous time scale of the accretion disc of @xmath12yrs ( see appendix[details_gtmodels ] for details ) .",
    "a small fraction of model protostars were highly accelerated ( e.g. by ejection from a multiple system ) .",
    "due to the adopted periodic boundary conditions in our calculations , these objects cross the computational domain many times while continuing to accrete . in reality , however , these protostars would have quickly left the high - density gas of the star - forming region and would not be able to gain more mass .",
    "we therefore consider accretion to stop after the object has crossed the computational box more than ten times .",
    "the radius of a sink particle is fixed at 280au , the physics ( e.g. exact accretion , radiation ) inside this volume can not be resolved .",
    "therefore , an evolutionary model describing the processes inside the sink particle is required .    .[params ] variable parameters from the e - model of s98 , together with the range they were varied in and the original value .",
    "the last two columns provide the overall range found to lead to the best agreement . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      in fig.[prob_all ] we show how the model tracks ( m05k8 , m2k2 , m6k2a , from left to right ) are distributed in the full t@xmath0-l@xmath0-m@xmath13 parameter space .",
    "the grey - scale background of the individual panels gives the probability to find one of the model stars at this particular position .",
    "darker regions indicate higher probabilities .",
    "we used typical e - model parameters ( see table[best_agree ] ) to determine these diagrams . for comparison",
    "the observational datapoints are overplotted .",
    "note that we plotted only model points with t@xmath14k , as this is the limit of the observational data and only these are used in the comparison with the observations .    as evident in fig.[prob_all",
    "] , the model distributions cover roughly the same area as the observations . especially in the t@xmath0-l@xmath0 and t@xmath0-m@xmath3 plane",
    "the models are able to explain the peak in the observed distribution . in the l@xmath0-m@xmath3 plane , however , the models fail to explain this peak ( see right column in fig.[prob_all ] ) .",
    "our models predict smaller envelope masses ( by a factor of two ) compared to parts of the observations .",
    "considering the cluster of observational points at about m@xmath15m@xmath8 , the discrepancy could be a selection effect in the observations .",
    "in addition , observed envelope masses are uncertain by a factor of two ( motte & andr ) .",
    "see also the discussion in sec.[further ] .",
    "we analyse the mass function of the final masses of model stars ( imf ) in the gt - models in order to compare it to that of the observational sample .",
    "the protostellar mass functions of the gt - models show a decline for masses larger than about 0.3m@xmath16 .",
    "the mean value of the slope of all considered models is @xmath17=@xmath18 in the mass range @xmath19@xmath20@xmath21@xmath201 .",
    "this is less steep than the salpeter slope of @xmath22 ( salpeter @xcite ) but our results are biased by the fact that binaries or multiple systems can not be resolved . at the low - mass end , the mass function is constrained by the sph resolution limit of @xmath230.05m@xmath16 . nevertheless , the mean value is in good agreement with the estimated final stellar mass spectrum in the corresponding observational sample ( @xmath24=-0.9@xmath250.2 ; froebrich @xcite ) .",
    "recall , that for this sample also no binary correction has been made .",
    "we test if the slope of the imf in the gt - models is related to the best agreement ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "however , no systematic dependence of @xmath26 on @xmath24 is present .",
    "in particular , a good agreement of @xmath24 between the gt - model and the observations does not necessarily lead to a high @xmath27-value .",
    "as discussed in the last paragraph ( see also the middle panel of fig.[tracks ] ) , the differences in the position in the t@xmath7-l@xmath0 diagram are partly due to the accretion history and not due to the final mass .",
    "hence , the test performed here is much more sensitive to the distribution of individual accretion histories than to the slope of the imf .      to constrain the free parameters in the e - model",
    ", we investigate here how the chosen values influence the agreement @xmath26 .",
    "table[best_agree ] contains the range of values which provide the highest agreement for each gt - model .",
    "in particular we show the values for the best fitting 5% of the e - models .",
    "it is more meaningful to provide these ranges instead of the particular parameters for the single best fitting model .",
    "these are statistically less significant , since not the whole parameter space is tested by our method .",
    "we obtain the following results for all gt - models :    * the temperature at the outer envelope boundary is lower than the standard value of 24k .",
    "typically temperatures between 15 and 19k lead to a good agreement . *",
    "a wide range for inner envelope radii ( @xmath28 ) leads to high @xmath27 .",
    "values from 35 to 80au are typical .",
    "this wide range is in agreement with the fact that a change in @xmath28 , while fixing all other parameters , usually results in very small changes of @xmath26 .",
    "however , the range for the best fitting models does not include the hitherto standard value of 30au . * in most cases small amounts of extra mass in the envelope ( @xmath29 ) lead to high agreement . *",
    "the parameter @xmath30 shows a wide range of possible values for a good agreement ( 1.4@xmath313.2 ) .",
    "a similar wide range is found for @xmath32 which ranges from 30 to 80@xmath110@xmath33yrs .",
    "the larger values found for @xmath32 suggest that the additional mass stays longer in the envelope to sustain low bolometric temperatures . *",
    "a range of values of @xmath34 is found to be able to best explain the data .",
    "however , in the majority of the cases @xmath35 leads to the best results .",
    "these values are in between the theoretical solutions for a free falling envelope ( 1.5 ) and a singular isothermal sphere ( 2.0 ) .",
    "the range found here seems to be a compromise between younger and older objects .",
    "since there are probably more older sources in the sample , the best values are closer to @xmath36 . in principle an evolution from @xmath37 to @xmath36 would be expected .",
    "our findings do not contradict this .",
    "our obtained values are in good agreement with ( sub)-mm observations of envelopes ( chandler & richer @xcite ; motte & andr ) . *",
    "we found the mass fraction in the envelope to be in the range from 86 to 96% .",
    "this would imply a disc mass of 4 to 14% of the envelope mass , mostly smaller than the standard value of 13% used so far , but in agreement with millimetre interferometric observations ( e.g. looney et al .",
    "@xcite ) . *",
    "the amount of mass ejected into the jets is found to range from 36 to 44% .",
    "this is a narrow range and somewhat contradictory to the observations and jet launching models which predict that at maximum 30% of the material is ejected into the jets .",
    "we interpret the high amount of ejected material here as a combination of two things .",
    "( 1 ) material really ejected into the jets . ( 2 )",
    "material accreted onto the star , but the resulting luminosity escapes directly through the cavity generated by the jets and is not observed .",
    "if the accretion luminosity is radiated uniformly away , then the additional ejected material would imply opening angles between 30 and 60 degrees for the cavities , not an untypical value for many of the older class0 sources ( e.g. padman et al .",
    "@xcite ) . to conclusively prove this hypothesis one needs to include the outflow luminosity for all objects into the comparison of models and observations . * the best - fitting opacity range ( 3.0 to 5.0@xmath38g@xmath39 ) agrees very well with the standard value of 4@xmath38g@xmath39",

    "there are , however , large differences in the quality of agreement between the various gt - models and the observations . in the following",
    "we investigate the cause of these differences .",
    "we determined for each set of accretion rates the median and the mean duration of the class0 phase of the model stars .",
    "the median for all gt - models ranges from 14 to 87@xmath110@xmath33yrs , while the mean duration spans from 23 to 124@xmath110@xmath33yrs .",
    "the much wider range for the average duration is due to some model stars ( outliers ) that go through an extremely long class0 phase .",
    "these objects have a large , secondary accretion peak which in many cases might not be physical but is caused by the lack of feedback mechanisms .",
    "due to the mass criterion used , such peaks shift the transition from class0 to 1 to later times . in table[best_agree ] we list the median and mean duration of the class0 phase of all stars in the models in the last two columns .",
    "all gt - models with @xmath26-values larger than 30% are associated with a mean duration of the class0 phase between 2 and 6@xmath110@xmath2yrs .",
    "most of them possess a ratio of median to mean duration of the class0 phase exceeding 0.7 .",
    "this indicates that no or only a few outliers are present in the set of accretion rates . when applying these two conditions to all gt - models , we select nine of them ( circles + @xmath40 in fig.[durationvsp ] ) .",
    "only m01k2 ( 12.2% ) and m6k2b ( 14.2% ) do not possess @xmath41 .",
    "hence 80% of the gt - models with these properties lead to high agreement .",
    "there are seven models that do not fulfil one of the criteria ( triangles in fig.[durationvsp ] ) .",
    "six of these possess @xmath26-values smaller than 30% .",
    "hence 85% of the gt - models that do not comply with both criteria lead to low agreement .",
    "this shows that high @xmath26-values are only obtained for gt - models that generate few outliers and the ` right ' duration of the class0 phase .",
    "the duration of the class0 stage shows a linear correlation with the median of the fit parameter @xmath42 of sk04 .",
    "this parameter indicates the time it takes until the peak accretion rate is reached .",
    "it is related to the local free - fall time and , thus , can be used as a rough estimate of the average density of the core at the onset of collapse ( see sk04 for details ) . given our best fitting models and the corresponding class0 lifetimes , we infer a range of 1 - 5@xmath110@xmath11@xmath43 for the local density at the start of the collapse .",
    "this is in good agreement with measured central densities of pre - stellar cores ( e.g. bacmann et al . ) .",
    "our results thus suggest that stars in the observational sample may only form in pre - stellar cloud cores that reach a central density of order of @xmath44@xmath43 .",
    "obviously , the duration of the class0 phase depends directly on the initial local density .",
    "as can be seen in table[best_agree ] , gt - models with mach numbers @xmath45 best describe the observations ( filled symbols in fig.[durationvsp ] ) .",
    "six out of seven such models possess a high @xmath27-value , while only one out of eight models with @xmath46 has a high @xmath26 .",
    "the exceptions m3k4 ( @xmath47 , @xmath27=5.99% ) and m6k2a ( @xmath46 , @xmath26=46.5% ) , as well as the fact that similar gt - models ( e.g. m6k2a / b / c ) result in very different @xmath26-values are , however , understandable since protostellar collapse is , in essence , a rather localised process , connected to the turbulent cloud environment only via the available mass and angular momentum inflow rate .",
    "it indicates that star formation is a highly stochastic process , influenced more strongly by local properties than by the global initial conditions , a fact which is also found , for example , by bate et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the range of mach numbers found as best explanation for the data reflects the composition of the observational sample .",
    "it mainly contains sources from perseus , orion , and serpens ( froebrich @xcite ) .",
    "there typical mach numbers are in the range @xmath48 ( e.g. castets & langer , schmeja et al . ) .",
    "it is , however , interesting to note that the majority of gt - models with @xmath46 are not able to explain the observations , independent of the choice for the e - model parameters .",
    "this indicates that the initial conditions do influence the observational properties of class0 protostars .",
    "we recall that we excluded 25% of the observational data in our determination of @xmath26 .",
    "those excluded exhibit a much lower bolometric luminosity than the other objects , for their given bolometric temperature and envelope mass",
    ". they could be objects which experience either ( a ) quiescent states of low accretion or ( b ) a different time dependence of the accretion rate ( froebrich @xcite ) .    a detailed investigation of the individual accretion rates from the gt - models rules out the existence of quiet accretion phases as the dominant cause for the low luminosity of these sources .",
    "on average , the individual model stars spend less than 5% of their time in a phase of suppressed accretion which we define as being a factor of six lower than the average value .",
    "this implies that we should observe only about 5% of the sources in such a state , compared to 25% .",
    "hence , these objects appear to follow a different accretion history .",
    "we investigate this in more detail by performing the procedure of determining @xmath26 using not only the ` normal ' sources , but also the taurus - like objects .",
    "we find that this reveals worse agreement with @xmath26 values typically halved .",
    "the agreement between models and observations is always lower when we try to explain the taurus like sources .",
    "this strengthens the proposal that in the case of ` normal ' sources , turbulence governs the accretion process , while other processes are responsible for the underluminous objects .",
    "considering their lower luminosity and hence lower accretion rates , we speculate that ambipolar diffusion might be an important process governing accretion in these sources",
    ".    a more detailed analysis of a sub - sample of taurus like objects would be desirable since the time dependence of the mass accretion rate might vary from region to region ( henriksen et al . ) .",
    "even though more and more such objects are discovered ( e.g. young et al .",
    "@xcite ) , indicating that the known percentage of these objects is clearly a lower limit , the current sample still suffers from too small number statistics to perform a reliable statistical analysis .      as evident from table[best_agree ]",
    ", the best agreement between observations and models is rather low ( @xmath4970% ) . here",
    "we will discuss three possible causes for this :    1 .",
    "there are many free parameters which , in principle , could take values within a large range , as noted in table[params ] . a straightforward test of all possible combinations",
    "to solve this highly non - linear minimisation problem of many variables is impossible .",
    "we thus applied a monte carlo method to obtain the best fitting parameter combination ( see appendix[details_kstest ] ) .",
    "the obtained probability @xmath26 is a lower limit since not all possible parameter combinations have been tested .",
    "note that only slightly smaller values for @xmath50 can lead to probabilities much closer to 100% , especially for models that already possess a high agreement .",
    "+ when converting @xmath50 to @xmath26 we restricted the random selection to model values with bolometric temperatures smaller than 80k .",
    "this is the limit of our observational sample of class0 sources .",
    "there are further restrictions in the observational data .",
    "no objects outside a given range in l@xmath0 and m@xmath3 .",
    "this is most likely an observational bias .",
    "we refrain from applying the other observational limits for the random selection process for the @xmath26 determination because the observational limits are not well defined / understood .",
    "if doing so , however , we would increase the probabilities for the agreement in many cases significantly towards 100% .",
    "2 .   as stated above",
    ", the observations clearly cover only a limited range of the t@xmath0-l@xmath0-m@xmath3 parameter space .",
    "all limits , except t@xmath14k , are observational biases .",
    "note that the observational sample consists of sources from several star forming regions .",
    "it is possible that e.g. the sensitivity limit for the bolometric luminosity is not the same in all regions , changing the observed statistics of low luminosity / mass sources compared to the real one .",
    "+ as shown in fig.[tracks ] , applying a fixed limit for t@xmath0 as a divide between class0 and class1 objects is not valid ( see also young & evans @xcite ) .",
    "most of the solar mass stars undergo this transition at temperatures close to 80k .",
    "however , depending on the individual accretion history of each star , some quite significant deviations from this value are evident .",
    "furthermore , lower mass class0/class1 transition objects tend to be warmer than the temperature limit applied here .",
    "thus , the object sample might suffer from misclassified objects .",
    "this also shows that there is a difference in the definition for class0 protostars based on observations and models .",
    "furthermore , the observational definition describes a different physical state of the object depending on its accretion history and final mass .",
    "we overcome most of these uncertainties , however , by applying the t@xmath51k restriction when determining @xmath26 .",
    "all our models are constructed on the most basic principles ( e.g. the gt - models neglect feedback mechanisms , the disc mass is a constant fraction of the envelope mass , etc . ) .",
    "in addition , all model stars are treated with the same set of e - model parameters .",
    "it is not clear if some of the parameters might depend on the final mass of the star .",
    "many parameters are also kept constant in time .",
    "this might not be valid ( e.g. the inner envelope radius , the fraction of mass in the disc , and the powerlaw index of the envelope density distribution could depend on the evolutionary state , final mass of the star ) .",
    "it is in many cases , however , uncertain how these dependencies can be parameterised .",
    "we thus kept these parameters constant so as not to introduce even more free arbitrary parameters .",
    "given these three points , we conclude that a very good agreement between the models and observations should not be expected .",
    "it would rather be very worrying if our method would result in a 99% agreement between models and observations .",
    "we further have to consider the possibility that star formation , and in particular the mass accretion process , might take such a diversity of paths that no simple unifying model can expect to capture them all , leading to low agreements even for future much improved observational samples and models .",
    "we extracted mass accretion rates within cores generated by gravoturbulent simulations and inserted them into a simple protostellar evolutionary scheme to calculate protostellar evolutionary tracks .",
    "a principle dependence of the position of these tracks in the t@xmath0-l@xmath0 diagram on the final mass is found .",
    "a detailed analysis , however , shows that we are not able to determine the final mass of a particular object from its measured bolometric temperature and luminosity more accurately than a factor of two . the particular shape of an evolutionary track is largely determined by the accretion history and by its final mass .",
    "hence , in the context of the gravoturbulent scheme , unique evolutionary tracks do not exist in the class0 or class0/1 phase , as opposed to the ensuing pre - main sequence evolution .",
    "it also implies that t@xmath7 is not always a reliable guide to the envelope - protostar mass ratio , as suggested also by young & evans @xcite .",
    "a 3d - ks - test was used to compare the distribution of our evolutionary tracks in the t@xmath0-l@xmath0-m@xmath3 parameter space with an observational sample of class0 objects . by varying free parameters associated with the evolutionary scheme , we are able to determine constraints for some of the parameters ( @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath34 ) .",
    "others were found to have no significant influence on the agreement between models and observations ( @xmath32 , @xmath30 , @xmath28 , @xmath56 ) . a comparison of the parameter values obtained by our method with observational constraints from individual objects ( e.g. for @xmath53 or @xmath34 ) can be conducted .",
    "this supports the reliability of our method as similar parameter values are obtained .    only gravoturbulent models generating model stars with a specific density at the start of the collapse and class0 lifetimes between 2 and 6@xmath110@xmath2yrs lead to a good agreement with the observations .",
    "this class0 lifetime is consistent with estimates of a few 10@xmath2yrs based on number ratios or dynamical timescales of outflows ( see e.g. andr at al .",
    "it is shown that the class0 lifetime is correlated with the local density at the onset of the collapse .",
    "the determined density range agrees well with density measurements for pre - stellar cores .",
    "gravoturbulent models with @xmath57 lead to the best agreement with the observations .",
    "the failure of models with @xmath46 to explain the data indicates that the initial conditions influence the observational properties of class0 sources .",
    "the initial mass function appears not to influence the agreement systematically .",
    "the highest probability that our distributions of model tracks and observational data points are drawn from the same basic population is 70% .",
    "this is reasonable given the uncertainties in the observations and the simple assumptions in the models .",
    "however , the method can be readily adapted to compare larger future source samples , different sets of accretion rates or other envelope models .    applying the ks - test to both the ` normal ' and underluminous , ` taurus - like ' objects in the source sample , we find that the determined probability @xmath27 is about twice as large when testing the ` normal ' objects .",
    "this is consistent with the proposal that turbulence governs the accretion rates in the majority of the objects .",

    "the radius of a sink particle is fixed at 280au .",
    "infalling gas particles undergo several tests to check if they remain bound to the sink particle before they are considered accreted .",
    "we can not resolve the evolution in the interior of the control volume defined by the sink particle .",
    "because of angular momentum conservation most of the infalling matter will accumulate in a protostellar disc within which it is transported inwards by viscous and possibly gravitational torques ( pringle ; papaloizou & lin ; see also jappsen & klessen for the models discussed here ) .",
    "the latter will be provided by spiral density waves that develop when the disc becomes too massive .",
    "this occurs when mass is loaded onto the disc faster than it is removed by viscous transport .",
    "altogether , the disc will not prevent or delay material from accreting onto the protostar for long .",
    "it acts as a buffer and smoothes possible accretion spikes . for the mass range considered here",
    "feedback effects are too weak to halt or delay accretion ( wuchterl & klessen @xcite ; wuchterl & tscharnuter ) . with typical disc sizes of the order of a few hundred au , the control volume encloses both protostar and disc .",
    "the measured core accretion rates are hence good estimates of the actual stellar accretion rates .",
    "strong deviations may be expected only if the protostellar core fragments into a binary system , in which case the infalling mass is distributed over two stars .",
    "in addition , if material with very high angular momentum is accreted , a certain mass fraction may end up in a circumbinary disc and not accrete onto the star at all .",
    "the timescale over which accretion is smoothed by the disc can be approximated by the viscous timescale @xmath70 ( pringle ) , with the viscosity parameter @xmath71 , the disc radius @xmath72 , the disc scale height @xmath73 , and the rotational period @xmath74 .",
    "using typical values of @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77yr this yields a rough estimate of @xmath78yrs for the viscous timescale at a radius of 1au",
    ". a large fraction of mass will lie external to this radius , leading to a larger @xmath79 , but this will be compensated for by stronger gravitational torques , which can lead to significantly larger values of the effective viscosity in the disc ( see e.g. laughlin & ryczka @xcite ) . since we can not model the detailed behaviour inside the disc , we take 10@xmath2 yrs as a rough measure for the smoothing timescale .",
    "this value is used to smooth the individual mass accretion rates from the gt - models .",
    "our results do not significantly depend on the smoothing scale that we apply . adopting viscous timescales of 5 or 15@xmath110@xmath33yrs yields very similar results .",
    "there are further smoothing effects and time - shifts , e.g. the luminosity generated in the centre typically escapes a class0 envelope in about 300yrs ( as determined by a random walk model ) .",
    "hence , this time lag is neglected in comparison to the disc viscosity timescale .",
    "the viscosity of the disc has additionally the effect that material transported from the envelope onto the disc needs some time before it gets accreted onto the star and the accretion luminosity is generated .",
    "hence , the observed envelope masses and luminosities do not represent the same time in the evolution . the observed luminosity corresponds to that of an envelope mass which was present about a viscosity timescale earlier .",
    "however , since this effect does not become significant until the disc is formed , it can be neglected in the very early stages of the evolution . in later stages , the evolution along the t@xmath0-l@xmath0 track is slower and the luminosity only slightly changes within one viscosity timescale .",
    "in particular the change is smaller than typical errors of the measurements .",
    "hence , we also neglect this effect in our calculations .",
    "accretion rates applied in the e - model to date assume specific functional forms with a fixed time scale for all protostars . as a consequence , even without a statistical comparison",
    ", it fails to explain the data . to overcome this , new parameters were introduced by myers et al .",
    "they took different evolutionary timescales for the envelope and the accretion , and subsequently found that the observations required ( 1 ) the accretion time scale to exceed the envelope timescale by a factor of a few and ( 2 ) the final mass of the star to be quite a small fraction of the original envelope mass .",
    "in addition , there are several free parameters in the e - model .",
    "some of their values are not as yet tightly constrained through observations or theory .",
    "plausible values , however , predict evolutionary tracks across the same region as occupied by the observed protostars ( e.g. froebrich et al .",
    "nevertheless , an immediate problem encountered with the basic model was that the protostars spent little time in the early class0 phase but lingered in the late class0 phase for periods exceeding 10@xmath11yr , implying contrary statistics to those observed . to overcome this , a distinct mass component was introduced into the envelope . in the e - model ,",
    "this arbitrary mass would not accrete , but would be dispersed directly .",
    "the rationale was that star formation remains inefficient due to outflow activity from the protostar .",
    "the second arbitrary parameter was the fraction of mass contained within a flattened distribution .",
    "that is , it is assumed from the outset , that a small fraction of the gas is available to accrete but does not add to the obscuration of the protostar .",
    "however , given these additions , it becomes difficult to relate the predictions uniquely to the chosen parameter set through the ks - test if we attempt to calculate analytically which parameter values would lead to the highest agreement between models and observations .",
    "additional free parameters in the e - model are an inner density , and inner and outer radius for the envelope .",
    "we have generalised the previous studies by introducing a power - law index ( @xmath34 ) for the radial density distribution , where @xmath80 , rather than fixing the value at 1.5 . instead of the inner density",
    "we employ the total envelope mass as the variable .",
    "in addition , rather than the outer radius , we adopt the outer temperature @xmath52 as the variable which then determines the outer radius .",
    "most of the mass initially contained in the envelope will eventually fall onto the protostar .",
    "the accretion luminosity depends on the collapse radius and the contraction of the central hydrostatic object . here",
    ", we assume that a constant density core develops .      in the following",
    "we describe in more detail the equations and parameters used in the evolutionary model for this work .",
    "the initial mass of the envelope and circumstellar disk , @xmath81 , is found by integrating the mass accretion rate , @xmath82 , over time .",
    "hence , the envelope / disk mass is given by @xmath83 the mass just in the spherical envelope is taken as @xmath84 in the first approximation , the accreting material is taken as instantaneously reaching the central hydrostatic core , defining the protostellar radius , @xmath85 .",
    "a fraction ( @xmath86 ) of this material is accreted onto the star i.e. @xmath87 the parameter @xmath88 will depend on the jet launching mechanism .",
    "we suppose that it is a function of the relative accretion rate i.e. @xmath89^\\zeta   \\label{eqn - hm}\\ ] ] where @xmath90 is the peak accretion rate and @xmath91 has been assumed to date .",
    "thus , @xmath55 is the maximum fraction of material ejected into the jets .",
    "we assume here that the hydrostatic core grows at constant density during the very early stages of star formation ( no energy released through contraction ) : @xmath92^{1/3 } \\cdot      \\left [ \\frac{m_0}{m_\\odot } \\right]^{2/3}.\\ ] ] we have found that alternative treatments produce similar results .",
    "the particular dependence on envelope mass corresponds to the case where the final escape speed of the jets is constant .",
    "the gravitational energy released is assumed to end up in radiation or in the jets .",
    "we thus write the accretion luminosity as @xmath93    the initial _ cloud core _ mass could exceed the _ envelope _ mass .",
    "that is , some extra mass is introduced .",
    "this mass is dispersed rather than being accreted . in other words",

    "hence , the test described above has to be performed about 10@xmath2 times to determine @xmath116 for one case , resulting in a huge amount of computations .",
    "since we are only interested in the maximum of the absolute differences between the relative numbers of the model points and observational points in the octants , we can constrain the investigated area to a cuboid containing all the observational datapoints . a test outside these boundaries will not lead to absolute differences larger than obtained inside the cuboid . in other words",
    ", @xmath117 corresponds to a point situated inside or at the boundary of the cuboid defined as : [ t@xmath118@xmath20t@xmath7@xmath20t@xmath119 ; l@xmath120@xmath20l@xmath0@xmath20l@xmath119 ; m@xmath121@xmath20m@xmath3@xmath20m@xmath122 . however , since most of the model points are still situated within this cuboid , the required amount of computations is not significantly reduced .    hence , we do not perform the test at all data points within this area , but rather at a certain number of points inside the cuboid .",
    "we performed extensive tests in order to establish the best compromise between computing time ( number of points where the test has to be performed ) and the accuracy of the method . as a result",
    ", we found that a @xmath123 point grid in the cuboid is sufficient to determine @xmath50 with the same accuracy as the probability of the agreement between observations and models ( see below ) .",
    "the ranges in t@xmath0 , l@xmath0 , and m@xmath3 are thus divided into four equally sized regions . while for t@xmath0 linear spacing was chosen , l@xmath0 and m@xmath3 are divided into equal spaces in logarithmic units .    in order to convert the @xmath50 value into a probability of agreement @xmath26",
    ", a monte carlo method has to be applied . for this purpose",
    ", we generated artificial observational data points by randomly selecting 27 model points out of all model points and treating them as observational data .",
    "since the observational data is limited to t@xmath14k , we applied this limit for the random selections as well .",
    "then the ks - test was performed ( using the same grid positions as with the real observational data points ) , leading to a value @xmath124 . repeating this process , a distribution n(@xmath125 )",
    "is created .",
    "the probability @xmath26 can then be determined by :      all @xmath50-values need to be converted to @xmath26 by such a monte carlo simulation . to minimise the computational needs we tested if this is needed for every single @xmath50-value .",
    "it turned out that the distributions n(@xmath127 ) obtained by a monte carlo simulation for one gt - model but different parameter sets in the e - model are similar .",
    "hence all @xmath116-values of one gt - model can be converted into @xmath26 using the same distribution .",
    "however , distributions n(@xmath127 ) for distinct gt - models are partly very different .",
    "thus , to find the best fitting model combination we selected the parameter combination leading to the smallest @xmath50-value for each gt - model to determine n(@xmath127 ) .",
    "this was then used to calculate the agreement @xmath26 .",
    "the total number of random selections to build up the distribution n(@xmath125 ) was a critical point concerning the accuracy of the method .",
    "hence , we tested for which number of repeats the final values of @xmath26 did not vary by more than one percent if the same test was repeated . for our distribution of model points ,",
    "this was the case for 3@xmath110@xmath2 random selection processes .",
    "this accuracy is not degraded by the @xmath123 grid , chosen for performing the ks - test , instead of doing the test at all datapoints in the cuboid .",
    "there are nine free parameters in the e - models which we kept variable .",
    "our task here is to find the combination of these parameters that leads to the best agreement with the models . a test of all possible combinations with an accurate spacing requires an immense amount of computations .",
    "we thus decided to use a monte carlo approach for this task as well .",
    "we randomly selected 100 values for each parameter from the range given in table[params ] and determined @xmath50 for these 100 random combinations .",
    "we then selected the parameter sets that lead to @xmath50-values which were smaller than @xmath128 .",
    "the maximum and minimum for each parameter value used in these selected sets was then taken to re - set the ranges out of which parameter values are selected . then again 100 e - models with randomly selected parameters out of the new range were tested .",
    "this procedure was repeated 30 times , finally leading to 3100 tested e - models .",
    "these models are used to determine the best fitting parameter ranges ( table[best_agree ] ) for the individual gt - models .",
    "these ranges were then used to determine another 10000 random parameter combinations , in order to find the best agreement .",
    "we tested for a subset of parameters and smaller ranges if the monte carlo method leads to the same results as a straight forward testing of all possible parameter combinations .",
    "both , the smallest @xmath50-value and the best fitting ranges for the parameter values , are found to be similar .",
    "note that the smallest found @xmath50-value has to be considered an upper limit , since not the whole parameter space was tested .",
    "alternatively the probability @xmath26 is a lower limit ."
