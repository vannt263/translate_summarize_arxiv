    "the time scale for this gas to cool to @xmath7 k can be shorter than the cluster lifetime ( e.g. , @xcite ) , giving rise to a subsonic , pressure - driven cooling flow that deposits mass onto the luminous and massive cd elliptical galaxy at the cluster center .",
    "`` cool core '' clusters such as these often exhibit intense optical emission line nebulae associated with these central brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) .",
    "the nebulae exhibit extended ly@xmath0 emission @xcite and far uv continuum emission @xcite .",
    "a previous study of two bcgs , abell 1795 and abell 2597 @xcite , found that the nebula exhibited both a diffuse component of ly@xmath0 and more compact features such as knots and filaments .",
    "the ly@xmath0 emission was closely tied to the radio morphology suggesting that star formation and associated ionization was present at the edges of radio lobes .",
    "that work demonstrated how ly@xmath0 and far - ultraviolet continuum observations provide unique constraints on the physical properties of the nebulae in clusters .",

    "nearly all bcgs with young stellar populations are in cooling flows @xcite .",
    "however , some bcgs in cooling flows do not have significant star formation @xcite .",
    "hence bcgs exhibiting elevated rates of star formation could be those experiencing a low level of feedback from the agn .",
    "evidence for residual cooling can be inferred from the reservoirs of cold gas found in bcgs .",
    "alternatively , star formation could also be attributed to stripping from a gas rich galaxy @xcite .",
    "recent estimates of condensation and star formations rates show that in a few systems they are in near agreement ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recent work suggests that star formation tends to occur when the central cooling time drops below a critical value @xcite . in our study of 62 bcgs with the spitzer irac and mips we found that about half of the bcgs in our sample showed evidence for mid - ir emission produced by star formation @xcite .",

    "in addition , studies of the kinematics of the optical emission line nebulae in cool core bcgs find that the gas motions are mostly turbulent with very little organized rotation ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "one caveat is that if processes other than recombination ( e.g. , shocks , cosmic ray heating ) contribute to h@xmath0 , the intrinsic h@xmath0/h@xmath8 ratio would be higher than the theoretical `` case b '' value and the estimated extinctions would be upper limits . with this possibility in mind , the upper - limit intrinsic optical extinction is @xmath58 for a balmer decrement of 5 , corresponding to an extinction in the fuv of @xmath59 and therefore a correction factor of 160 to the measured flux .",
    "we note from table [ tab : sfr ] that ir star formation rates exceed those estimated in h@xmath0 and these exceed those estimated from the fuv continuum",
    ". this would be consistent with patchy but significant levels of extinction .",
    "the correction factor estimated for the uv photometry of 160 for a balmer decrement of 5 is vastly higher than that required to make up the deficit of star formation rates estimated between the uv and ( e.g. ) the ir .",
    "large levels of extinction are also likely because of the high molecular gas content in these galaxies and the dust lanes seen in the optical images .",
    "previous comparisons by @xcite between h@xmath0 and ly@xmath0 flux suggested modest extinctions intrinsic to the cluster of order @xmath60 .",
    "this was done assuming an unabsorbed ly@xmath0/h@xmath0 ratio of 13 for photoionization and collision models @xcite .",
    "however the bcgs considered by @xcite were not chosen via their h@xmath0 luminosity .",
    "as h@xmath0 luminosity is correlated with both molecular gas mass and infrared luminosity @xcite is it perhaps not surprising that the sample considered here would have higher estimated internal extinctions than the same considered by @xcite .    in short ,",
    "fuv estimated star formation rates range from @xmath61 to @xmath62 times lower than those estimated from the _ spitzer _ observations .",
    "balmer decrements and molecular gas observations suggest that internal extinction could be extremely high in some regions .",
    "the discrepancy between the estimated star formation rates and the internal extinction correction factor from the balmer decrement suggest that internal extinction is patchy .",
    "as the infrared estimated star formation rate is least sensitive to extinction , it can be considered the most accurate , and suggests that about 90% of the fuv continuum has been absorbed .",
    "when taking patchy extinction into account , the discrepancy between star formation rates estimated at different wavelengths may be reconciled . moreover , even when accounting for internal extinction , a one - to - one correspondence between star formation rates measured in the uv and ir are not necessarily expected , as the associated star formation indicators in those wavelength regimes may probe different aspects of the star forming region ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite found that in gas - rich star forming bcgs the nominal gas depletion time scale is about 1 gyr .",
    "since star formation is not highly efficient , it seems likely that 1 gyr is an upper limit to the life time of the star formation .",
    "@xcite suggest that the star formation in bcgs is relative recent with ages less than 200 myr .",
    "thus , a typical star formation rate of 50 @xmath63  yr@xmath12 would result in a total mass of less than @xmath64 @xmath63 which is a small fraction of the total stellar mass in a bcg ( e.g. , @xcite ) as also noted by , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "@xcite noticed a discrepancy between the infrared estimated star formation rates and the size of the star forming regions .",
    "here we have confirmed that the star forming regions are not large and remain under 30 kpc .",
    "this puts the galaxies somewhat off the kennicutt relation @xcite but ( as shown by @xcite in their figure 8) only by a modest factor of a few . while we confirm the discrepancy we find that it is small enough that it could be explained by other systematic effects such as an overestimate of the h@xmath65 mass .",
    "the co to h@xmath65 conversion factor is suspected to be uncertain by a factor of a few ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "the ratio of the observed star formation rate to that required by the zanstra method is of order unity , suggesting that the fuv continuum provides a significant fraction of ionizing photons for the nebula .",

    "this result is consistent with the notion that the nebula is ionized locally by the young stars embedded within it , as supported by the similar morphologies of the ly@xmath0 emission and fuv continuum emission .",

    "in this paper we have presented high angular resolution images in fuv continuum and ly@xmath0 of 7 bcgs selected on the basis of ir emission which suggested the presence of significant star formation .",

    "however , both the balmer decrement in the central arcsec , the presence of dust lanes seen in the optical images , and the detection of co in these galaxies suggest that there are regions of dense gas and high extinction within the central 10 - 30 kpc .",
