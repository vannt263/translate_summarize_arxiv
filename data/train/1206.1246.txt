    "the inversion of the wave equation is basically equivalent to the problem of recovering the function @xmath7 from its averages over circles with centers on @xmath0 .",
    "both reconstruction problems are essential for the novel hybrid imaging methods photoacoustic tomography ( pat ) and thermoacoustic tomography ( tat ) .",
    "the standard setups in pat / tat using point - like detectors require the inversion of the wave equation in three spatial dimensions  @xcite .",
    "the two dimensional version considered in this paper arises in a variant of pat / tat that uses linear integrating detectors instead of point - like ones ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "inversion of circular means and the wave equation is also relevant for other imaging modalities , such as sonar @xcite or ultrasound tomography @xcite .    in the recent years , many reconstruction techniques for the wave inversion and the inversion from circular means ( or spherical means in higher dimensions ) have been developed .",
    "these techniques can be classified in iterative reconstruction methods ( see @xcite ) , model based time reversal ( see @xcite ) , fourier domain algorithms ( see @xcite ) , and algorithms based on explicit reconstruction formulas of the back - projection type ( see @xcite ) . the back - projection approach is particularly appealing since it is theoretically exact , stable with respect to data and modeling imperfections , mathematically elegant , and quite straightforward to implement numerically . until recently , however , exact back - projection type reconstruction formulas were only known for the cases where @xmath10 is a spherical , planar or cylindrical surface ( in three spatial dimensions ) and a circle or a line ( in two spatial dimensions ) .",
    "many researchers even believed that exact reconstruction formulas of the back - projection type exist only in such cases . only very recently",
    "the so called universal back - projection formula ( originally introduced to pat / tat in @xcite ) has been shown in @xcite to provide theoretically exact reconstruction for ellipsoids in @xmath11 . in the same paper",
    "it has further be shown that for general convex domains in @xmath11 the universal back - projection formula is exact modulo an explicitly given smoothing integral operator .    in this paper",
    "we establish back - projection type reconstruction formulas for the inversion of the two dimensional wave equation on convex domains @xmath1 . as their counterparts in three spatial dimensions ,",
    "the derived formulas provide exact reconstruction modulo an explicitly computed smoothing integral operator @xmath3 .",
    "we further show that for elliptical and circular domains the operator @xmath3 vanishes and therefore we obtain exact back - projection type reconstruction formulas in these cases . the same type of results are derived for reconstructing a function from its mean values over circles with centers on the boundary of a convex domain in the plane .",
    "note that our reconstruction formulas as well as the proofs differ from the ones given in @xcite .",
    "this partially accounts for the fact that the three dimensional wave equation satisfies a strong form of huygens principle , whereas the two dimensional wave equation does not .      before presenting our main results",
    "we introduce some notation that will be used throughout this article .    for any @xmath12 ,",

    "since the operator @xmath61 preserves the locations of the singularities of @xmath62 this shows that the kernel in ( [ eq : kern ] ) has at most a weak singularity proportional to @xmath63 and hence is at least smoothing by one degree .    for special domains , the integral operator @xmath3 may vanish ,",

    "we will further make use of the operator @xmath75 , which maps any @xmath46 to the solution @xmath76 of the initial value problem @xmath77 one easily recognizes that @xmath73 and @xmath75 are related by the identity @xmath78 .",

    "therefore , one application of fubini s theorem , the definition of the radon transform and the definitions of @xmath89 and @xmath90 yield @xmath98 finally , after performing one further integration by parts in the inner integral , the last expression is seen to be equal to @xmath99 this shows that ( [ eq : intphi2 ] ) indeed holds for all @xmath100 . in order to verify the corresponding identity for @xmath92 in place of @xmath101",
    "we may write @xmath92 as the @xmath102-limit of continuously differentiable functions @xmath103 .",
    "application of ( [ eq : intphi2 ] ) with @xmath103 in place of @xmath101 and taking the limit @xmath104 afterwards then implies the desired identity  ( [ eq : intphi ] ) .",
