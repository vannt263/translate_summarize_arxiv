    "algorithms for solving polynomial systems have become increasingly important over the past years , because of the many situations where such algebraic systems appear , including both theoretical problems ( algorithmic geometry , polynomial inversion  ) , and real - life applications ( cryptography , robotics  ) .",
    "examples of such algorithms include eigenvalues methods for systems with a finite number of solutions , or resultant calculations for polynomial elimination ( see  @xcite for a survey ) .",
    "the theory of grbner bases is another tool which has proved useful for this purpose , and many algorithms for computing grbner bases have been described since their introduction .",
    "they include direct algorithms , computing the grbner basis of any system : to name only a few , the historical buchberger algorithm  @xcite , and later the faugre 4  @xcite and 5  @xcite algorithms ; as well as change of order algorithms , computing a grbner basis of an ideal from another grbner basis : the main examples are the  algorithm @xcite for systems with a finite number of solutions , and the grbner walk @xcite for the general case .",
    "systems arising from applications usually have some structure , which makes the resolution easier than for generic systems . in this paper",
    ", we consider one such structure , namely _ weighted homogeneous _",
    "polynomials : a polynomial @xmath11 is weighted homogeneous with respect to a system of weights @xmath0 ( or @xmath1-homogeneous ) if and only if @xmath12 is homogeneous in the usual sense .",
    "moreover , in order to obtain precise results , we will assume that the systems satisfy some _ generic _ properties , which are satisfied by almost any system drawn at random .",
    "this is a usual assumption for grbner basis complexity estimates .",
    "more generally , we will also consider affine systems with a _ weighted homogeneous structure _ , that is systems whose component of maximal weighted degree will satisfy these generic properties .",
    "the complexity estimates given in this paper can be applied to a wide range of grbner basis algorithms .",
    "however , we mainly focus on two algorithms : matrix-5 , which is a matrix variant of 5 described in  @xcite , allowing for complexity analyses , and .    [",
    "[ sec : previous - work ] ] prior work + + + + + + + + + +    the special case @xmath13 is the usual homogeneous case . in this case , all the results from this paper specialize to known results .",
    "furthermore , some hypotheses are always satisfied , making the properties and definitions simpler . in particular ,",
    "the description of the hilbert series of a homogeneous complete intersection is adapted from  @xcite , and the asymptotics of the degree of regularity of a semi - regular sequence were studied in  @xcite .    weighted homogeneous systems have been studied before , from the angle of singularity theory and commutative algebra . in particular ,",
    "some results about the hilbert series and the hilbert function of weighted homogeneous ideals , including the weighted bzout bound  , can be found in most commutative algebra textbooks .",
    "the computational strategy for systems with a weighted structure is not new either , for example it is already implemented ( partially : only for weighted homogeneous systems with a degree order ) in the computer algebra system magma @xcite .",
    "additionally , the authors of  @xcite proposed another way of taking into account the weighted structure , by way of the hilbert series of the ideal .",
    "the authors of  @xcite generalized this algorithm to systems homogeneous with respect to a multigraduation .",
    "their definition of a system of weights is more general than the one we use in the present paper .    to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "nobody presented a formal description of a computational strategy for systems with a weighted homogeneous structure ( not necessarily weighted homogeneous ) , together with complexity estimates .",
    "some of the results presented in this paper about regular sequences previously appeared in a shorter conference paper @xcite , of which this paper is an extended version : these results are the weak form of the weighted macaulay bound   and the formal description of the algorithmic strategy for weighted homogeneous systems , with the complexity estimates   and  .",
    "this conference paper lacked a hypothesis ( reverse chain - divisible systems of weights ) , and as such lacked the precise description of hilbert series required to obtain results for semi - regular sequences .",
    "the sharp variant of the weighted macaulay bound  , under the assumption of simultaneous noether position , was also added in the present paper .",
    "finally , the benchmarks section of the current paper contains additional systems , arising in polynomial inversion problems .",
    "the conference paper was using _ quasi - homogeneous _ to describe the studied structure , instead of _ weighted homogeneous_. while both names exist in the literature , _ weighted homogeneous _ seems to be more common , and to better convey the notion that this structure is a generalization of homogenity , instead of an approximation .",
    "the same notion is sometimes also named simply _ homogeneous _ ( in which case the weights are determined by the degree of the generators ; see for example  @xcite ) , or homogeneous for a _ nonstandard graduation _",
    "@xcite .",
    "[ [ sec : main - results ] ] main results + + + + + + + + + + + +    by definition , weighted homogeneous polynomials can be made homogeneous by raising all variables to their weight .",
    "the resulting system can then be solved using algorithms for homogeneous systems .",
    "however , experimentally , it appears that solving such systems is much faster than generic homogeneous systems . in this paper",
    ", we show that the complexity estimates for homogeneous systems , in case the system was originally @xmath1-homogeneous , can be divided by @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the complexity exponent of linear algebra operations ( @xmath16 for naive algorithms , such as the gauss algorithm ) .",
    "these complexity estimates depend on two parameters of the system : its _ degree of regularity _ @xmath17 and its _ degree _ @xmath18 .",
    "these parameters can be obtained from the _",

    "this property has several equivalent definitions in the homogeneous case .",
    "while these definitions can be easily extended to the weighted case , their equivalence is not necessarily true .",
    "however , we prove that these definitions are equivalent in the special case where the weights form a reverse chain - divisible sequence .    in the homogeneous case ,",
    "the property of being semi - regular is only conjectured to be generic , but this conjecture is proved in a handful of cases  ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "1.5 ) . in this paper",

    "more generally , in the homogeneous case , one can compute asymptotic estimates on the degree of regularity of a semi - regular sequence @xcite .",
    "these estimates can be adapted to the weighted homogeneous case . as an example , we give an asymptotic bound on the degree of regularity for semi - regular systems with @xmath40 for a given integer @xmath41 :    [ thm : intro - dreg ] let @xmath42 and @xmath41 be two positive integers , and let @xmath40 .",

    "if we lift the assumption that the system of weights is reverse chain - divisible , the degree of regularity does not appear to rise too far beyond the bound .",
    "future work on the topic could include characterizing the hilbert series of @xmath1-homogeneous semi - regular sequences in full generality , in order to obtain bounds on the @xmath1-degree of regularity .    in practice , taking advantage of the weighted structure when applicable yields significant speed - ups .",
    "some instance of a weighted structure has already been successfully exploited for an application in cryptography @xcite .",
    "we also present timings obtained with several polynomial inversion problems , with speed - ups ranging from 12 to almost 100 .",
    "in particular , we use these techniques in order to compute the relations between fundamental invariants of several groups ( see @xcite ) .",
    "for some groups such as the cyclic-5 group or the dihedral group @xmath50 , computing these relations is intractable without considering the weighted structure of the system , while it takes only a few seconds or minutes when exploiting the weighted structure .",
    "all these systems are examples of applications where the weights giving the appropriate @xmath1-homogeneous structure are naturally reverse chain - divisible .",
    "these experimentations have been carried using 5 and with the grbner basis library fgb  @xcite and 4 with the computer algebra system magma  @xcite .",
    "there are other applications where grbner bases are computed for polynomial systems with a weighted - homogeneous structure , for example in coding theory , both for generating codes ( @xcite , @xcite ) and for decoding through guruswami - sudan s algorithm ( see @xcite for an overview ) .",

    "<S> furthermore , the maximum degree reached in a run of algorithm 5 is bounded by the weighted macaulay bound @xmath9 , and this bound is sharp if we can order the weights so that @xmath10 . for overdetermined semi - regular systems , estimates from the homogeneous case can be adapted to the weighted case .    </S>",
