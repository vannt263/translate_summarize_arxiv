    "the neutron stars ( nss ) of the sxrts undergo recurrent surges of x - ray activity ( due to intense accretion onto the stellar surface ) separated by longer periods of relative _",
    "quiescence_. the quiescent emission , around @xmath0 erg s@xmath1 is characterized by a thermal spectrum plus a power law tail at higher energies . though accretion can not be excluded as energy source ( van paradijs et al .",
    "1987 ) , observations hint in favor of interpreting the thermal component as due to the cooling of the old ns , heated during the episodes of intense accretion ( brown , bildsten & rutledge 1998 , bbr98 hereafter ; rutledge et al .",
    "2000 ; campana et al .",
    "freshly accreted matter undergoes nuclear burning ( brown 2000 ) whose energy is almost instantly lost through the photosphere . as accretion proceeds recurrently , the ns envelope becomes progressively enriched of fe elements .",
    "the old crust is eventually assimilated into the core and the ns , after a few million years , is endowed by a new crust of non - equilibrium matter which is approaching its lowest energy state through a sequence of pycnonuclear reactions ( haensel & zdunik 1990a , 1990b ) . the heat , deposited deeply into the crust , emerges in quiescence with a luminosity @xmath2 ( visible between outbursts ) , depending on the balance between photon and neutrino cooling with pycnonuclear heating .",
    "we here calculate @xmath2 with an exact cooling code to derive the upper theoretical bound on the efficiency of rediffusion of the pycnonuclear energy as function of the recurrence time of a sxrt . we will also prove that charting the temperature of the old hot ns in a sxrt is a valuable tool to investigate the properties of nuclear matter in its core , in alternative to the study of isolated young cooling nss . as some of these compact objects may have accreted a substantial amount of mass from the companion ( burderi et al .",
    "1999 ) , this study opens also the possibility to explore the interior of nss which can be more massive than the isolated ones . as an illustration of this approach",
    "we compare the results of our calculation with the observation of the quiescent emission seen in some sxrts ( aql x-1 , cen x-4 , 4u 1608 - 522 , exo 0748 - 676 , rapid burster ) and in the transient x - ray 2.5 ms pulsar sax j1808.4 - 3658 .",
    "the agreement between theory and observation is quite remarkable .",
    "we use an exact cooling code which solves the equations of heat transport and the corresponding effective temperature @xmath3 and energy conservation in a wholly general relativistic scheme ( page 1998 ) .",
    "the _ cooling sources _ are neutrino emission ( in the crust and the core ) and surface photon radiation .",
    "the _ heating source _ is accretion - induced production of nuclear energy : in a fully replaced crust , the bulk of the energy is released by the pycnonuclear fusions ( @xmath4 mev / baryon ) in a time - scale @xmath5 months.\\ ] ] representing the energy deposited per unit time at the current time .",
    "a minor energetic contribution comes from electron captures and neutron emissions ( haensel & zdunik 1990a ) occurring at a rate proportional to the instantaneous accretion rate @xmath6.@xmath7 is the atomic mass unit . ]",
    "the chemical composition and the equation of state ( eos ) of the crust are the ones of an accreted crust ( haensel & zdunik 1990b ) while for the core we follow prakash , ainsworth & lattimer ( 1988 ) .",
    "we include the strong suppressing effects of superfluidity ( neutron ) and superconductivity ( protons ) on both the specific heat and neutrino emission .",
    "have only the modified urca process allowed in their core and suppression by neutron pairing is strong , while stars with @xmath8 have the direct urca process operating with suppression at lower temperatures so that fast neutrino cooling does affect significantly their thermal evolution . ]",
    "we model the transient accretion rate @xmath9 ( measured at @xmath10 ) with a fast exponential rise , on a time scale @xmath11 days , reaching a maximum @xmath12 , followed by a power law decay of index @xmath13 accretion is never turned off but becomes negligible at @xmath14 days ( a typical duration @xmath15 of the outbursts in sxrts ) .",
    "a new exponential rise recurs every @xmath16 .",
    "thus , the total accreted mass during one cycle is @xmath17 ; the time averaged accretion rate is @xmath18 and the outburst luminosity ( at @xmath10 ) @xmath19 is such that the fluence @xmath20 with @xmath21 the efficiency .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "1a an example of the heating ( cooling ) of an initially cold ( hot ) neutron star after the onset of intermittent accretion .",
    "it is compared with a model ( _ dot - dashed line _ ) having constant accretion at a rate equal to @xmath22@xmath23 the star reaches thermal equilibrium on a time scale @xmath24 yr , much shorter than any binary evolution time , and also much shorter than the time necessary to replenish the crust with fresh non catalyzed matter .",
    "the equilibration temperature is attained when the net injected heat is exactly balanced by the energy loss from the surface and/or from neutrino emission .",
    "1b shows that @xmath2 depends crucially on whether fast neutrino emission in the inner core is allowed or inhibited ( and in turn on the value of the critical temperature @xmath25 for both proton and neutron pairing ) . for @xmath26 stars with superfluidity ( upper solid lines ` 1.4sf ' and ` 1.6sf ' ) , neutrino emission",
    "is totally suppressed and the equilibrium temperature is determined by balance of nuclear heating with photon cooling .",
    "when superfluidity is not included , the stars are slightly less luminous ( we omit the results in the figure ) . in these cases , with a fixed accreted mass @xmath27 per cycle we see that , naturally , @xmath2 is proportional to @xmath28 .",
    "when fast neutrino emission is allowed ( ` 1.7sf ' & ` 1.8sf ' lines ) , the equilibration temperature is much lower and the lowest @xmath2 are obtained in the case neutrino emission is not affected by neutron pairing ( ` 1.8nsf ' ) . in these fast cooling models",
    "the dependence of @xmath2 on @xmath29 is weak since most of the heat deposited during a cycle is rapidly lost into neutrinos .",
    "in fig .  2 we compare the results of our calculation with the ratios @xmath30 and @xmath31 observed in 6 sxrts ( rutledge et al . 2000 ; stella et al .",
    "it appears remarkable that aql  x-1 and 4u  1608 - 52 stands just on the theoretical line constructed for 1.4 @xmath32-star , thus strongly supporting the hypothesis that the quiescent luminosity @xmath2 seen in sxrts comes from the rediffusion toward the surface of the heat deposited in the core by the pycnonuclear reactions triggered in the crust due to transient accretion ( bbr98 ) .",
    "@xmath33 is the fraction of the heat released in the crust during accretion which is stored in the stellar interior and later slowly leaking out to the surface : the expected results for @xmath34 , are shown for our 1.4 @xmath35-star ( _ dashed - dot line _ ) and 1.8 @xmath35-star ( _ dashed line _ ) .",
    "it appears that @xmath36 when direct urca emission switches on , as in the core of our heavier stars ( ` 1.7sf ' and ` 1.8sf ' , _ solid lines _ ) . in these framework",
    "we can now use our results to infer properties of the neutron star .",
    "for example , the measured ratio @xmath30 of cen x-4 may be explained if its ns is heavier than the canonical 1.4 .",
    "the rapid burster would fit the theory if its mass lies in an intermediate range .",
    "measuring the masses of sxrts by charting the x - ray temperature may provide a clue for establishing the link between the nss in low mass binaries and the millisecond pulsars ( stella et al .",
    "1994 ) . more concretely , combining the observed ratio @xmath30 with future independent measurements of the mass of the nss in the sxrts",
    ", one could pose constraints on the value of the critical temperature for neutron pairing @xmath37 ( page et al . 2000 ) ."
