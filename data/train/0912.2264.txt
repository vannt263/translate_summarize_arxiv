    "@xcite and has one - baryon and two - baryon pieces .",

    "current that are consistent with the effective @xmath2 and @xmath1 forces . since the underlying potential cd bonn + @xmath9 is based on the exchange of standard isovector mesons @xmath10 and @xmath11 and isoscalar mesons @xmath12 and @xmath13 ,",
    "the same meson exchanges are contained in the effective nucleonic forces and currents .",
    "the initial and final @xmath1 bound and scattering states are respectively described by the exact faddeev and alt , grassberger , and sandhas ( ags ) three - particle equations @xcite in the isospin formalism that are solved in momentum space using partial wave decomposition @xcite . the coulomb interaction between charged baryons is important in the considered low - energy reactions and is included using the method of screening and renormalization @xcite .",
    "the current is expanded in electric and magnetic multipoles .",
    "the magnetic multipoles are calculated from the one- and two - baryon parts of the spatial current .",
    "the electric multipoles use the siegert form of the current without the long - wavelength approximation ; assuming current conservation , the dominant parts of the one - baryon convection current and of the diagonal @xmath10- and @xmath11-exchange current are taken into account implicitly in the siegert part of the electric multipoles by the coulomb multipoles of the charge density ; the remaining non - siegert part of the electric multipoles not accounted for by the charge density is calculated using explicit one- and two - baryon spatial currents .",
    "although the continuity equation is not exactly fulfilled for the nonlocal potential cd bonn + @xmath9 or when the relativistic @xmath4 current corrections are included , the employed calculational scheme , based on the siegert form of the current , effectively corrects the current nonconservation as argued in ref .",
    "@xcite and is therefore reliable for the observables of low - energy photoreactions considered in this paper .",
    "we also note that the use of the nonrelativistic hadronic dynamics together with the relativistic current corrections is somehow inconsistent .",
    "however , in the low - energy reactions it is natural to expect the effect of the relativistic hadronic dynamics to be small ; this expectation is consistent with the results of ref .",

    "we start with the @xmath7 radiative capture where significant relativistic effects were predicted in ref .  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ayd ] we show the deuteron vector analyzing power @xmath15 at deuteron lab energies @xmath16 , 17.5 , and 29 mev as a function of the center - of - mass ( c.m . ) @xmath17 ( or @xmath18 ) scattering angle .",
    "the effect of the @xmath4 spin - orbit charge is sizable and clearly improves the description of the experimental data whereas the relativistic corrections of the @xmath4 spatial current contributing to the magnetic multipoles and to the non - siegert part of the electric multipoles yield only minor changes .",
    "furthermore , it is interesting to note that the spin - orbit charge effect increases with decreasing energy as the @xmath15 itself does .",
    "a strong and beneficial effect is seen also in the proton analyzing power @xmath19 at @xmath20 mev proton lab energy in fig .",
    "[ fig : ayp ] .",
    "in contrast , the differential cross section and deuteron tensor analyzing powers at low energies remain almost unaffected by the spin - orbit charge as can be seen from our previous results @xcite at @xmath21 mev ; those results are not documented in this paper again .",
    "the spin - orbit charge effect shows up in the deuteron tensor analyzing powers as the energy increases , especially at forward and backward angles where the differential cross section is small . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ayy ] we show @xmath22 at @xmath23 mev ; further examples can be found in refs .",

    "one may conjecture that large spin - orbit charge effect in low - energy @xmath19 and @xmath15 is due to the high momentum components present in the @xmath8 wave function .",
    "we therefore performed additional calculations with av18 @xcite and effective field theory n3lo @xcite potentials that , although having quite comparable @xmath8 binding energies , 6.923 mev and 7.128 mev , respectively , differ significantly in the @xmath8 d - state probability , 8.47% and 6.32% , and in the expectation value for the @xmath8 internal kinetic energy , 45.68 mev and 33.78 mev .",
    "however , the spin - orbit charge effect turns out to be the same in both cases thereby ruling out the above conjecture .",
    "in fact , at low energy only the matrix elements @xmath24 with @xmath25 and @xmath26 , i.e. , the e1 transitions between the @xmath27 @xmath7 scattering states and the @xmath8 bound state , calculated using either the siegert form ( as in our standard procedure ) or the explicit one- and two - baryon spatial currents , are significantly affected by the relativistic corrections .",
    "the nonrelativistic ( spin - independent ) charge contribution for these matrix elements is suppressed compared to the @xmath28 due to the total spin of the @xmath8 bound state being predominantly @xmath29 . as a consequence ,",
    "the spin - orbit charge becomes important , especially for the @xmath30 which is responsible for about 90% of the observed effect in the vector analyzing powers that are very sensitive to this particular matrix element .    for curiosity",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : rc100 ] also the results at considerably higher energies , i.e. , @xmath31 mev or @xmath32 mev , where not only the spin - orbit charge but also the relativistic corrections of the @xmath4 spatial current yield visible effects for the differential cross section and spin observables .",
    "the description of the experimental data is quite satisfactory although in this energy regime one can expect further changes due to relativistic hadronic dynamics .",
    "next we consider the two - body photodisintegration of @xmath8 that is related to the @xmath7 radiative capture by time reversal . in fig .",
    "[ fig : g2b ] we present results for the linear photon asymmetry @xmath33 , the target analyzing power @xmath34 , and the beam - target parallel - antiparallel spin asymmetry @xmath35 .",
    "the importance of the spin - orbit charge is different for these observables : @xmath33 remains almost unaffected , @xmath34 shows moderate effect around the minimum whereas @xmath35 is strongly affected but only at forward and backward angles where the differential cross section is small ; the different effects are due to the different sensitivity of the observables to the crucial matrix elements @xmath24 , as already encountered in the radiative capture .",
    "the effect of the relativistic corrections of the @xmath4 spatial current is negligible for all considered @xmath8 photodisintegration observables and therefore will be not shown for the three - body breakup .        finally in figs .",
    "[ fig : g3b ] and [ fig : g3bzz ] we show our predictions for the semi - inclusive observables of the @xmath8 three - body photodisintegration .",
    "we note in passing that the inclusion of the coulomb interaction for this reaction is  among all reactions considered in this paper  most important ; that fact is also explicitly documented in refs .",
    "the inclusion of the spin - orbit charge yields no visible changes in the semi - inclusive differential cross section and in the spin observables @xmath33 and @xmath34 but leads to a significant effect for the asymmetry @xmath35 that , in contrast to the two - body photodisintegration , is seen at _ all _ scattering angles of the detected proton or neutron .",
    "note that the corresponding observable in the deuteron photodisintegration is affected by the relativistic @xmath4 current corrections in a similar way @xcite .",
    "we performed calculations of @xmath1 photonuclear reactions at low energies and studied effects of various relativistic corrections to the @xmath4 e.m .",

    "current including relativistic @xmath4 corrections are quite successful in accounting for the existing @xmath7 radiative capture data .",

    "the effect of the relativistic @xmath4 current corrections becomes visible for other observables as well .    among the observables of the two- and three - body photodisintegration of @xmath8 the beam - target parallel - antiparallel spin asymmetry @xmath35 appears to be most sensitive to the relativistic @xmath4 current corrections .",
