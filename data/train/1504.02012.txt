    "such transformations are rarely discussed in electrodynamics textbooks , except for the doppler effect , which is essentially a change in frequency due a moving source or scattering medium as seen by a stationary observer . however , time - varying media systems not involving any motion , such as magnetoplasma and magneto - elastic media , may be more practical in electromagnetic applications  @xcite .",
    "related effects include frequency conversion , time reversal , and angular spectrum engineering possibilities , with a wide range of potential applications in electromagnetics and optics .",
    "in this work , we present a space - time cross - mapping approach where scattering in space - varying media is treated as scattering in corresponding time - varying media .",
    "this approach may simplify the analysis of space - varying scattering problems by leveraging the breaking , due to causality , of the inherent space - time symmetry in the wave equation .",
    "indeed , while the wave equation admits solutions that correspond to waves propagating forward and backward in space and in time , however , causality prevents temporal backward - propagating waves . in the case of discontinuous time - varying media , such abruptly switched media ,",
    "this breaking of space - time symmetry prohibits multiple reflection between the temporal interfaces .",
    "treatment of wave scattering in such media is inherently simpler than in corresponding space - varying media with multiple reflections between the interfaces .",
    "however , certain challenges also arise in the cross - mapped configuration , such as the presence of boundaries outside the line - of - sight ( los ) of the source and observer .",
    "this challenge arises precisely due to space - time asymmetry , where boundaries outside the los in a time - varying configuration are not permitted to reflect waves backward in time .",
    "a second closely related challenge is the proper cross - mapping of sources from spatial into temporal configurations .",

    "the relevant continuity conditions , conservation laws and an ongoing controversy pertaining to the electromagnetic wave momentum are discussed and canonical scattering at simple temporal discontinuities are analyzed . in section  [ sec:3 ] , the space - time cross - mapping method is formulated .",
    "first , the appropriate mapping between the incident and scattered waves in temporal and spatial configurations , and the relevant mapping of media properties are established .",

    ", we show the difference between the continuity conditions at spatial and temporal interfaces , and apply these conditions to scattering by simple temporal discontinuities .      in the scattering of electromagnetic fields at a spatial interface ,",
    "the conventional continuity conditions imply the continuity of the tangential electric and magnetic fields at the interface . even though the mathematical formulation of these conditions is not rigorous in the case of discontinuities  @xcite , it yields satisfactory results away from the discontinuity in most practical configurations",
    ". however , a more rigorous interpretation of the continuity conditions in terms of actual physical principles is still preferable , especially when investigating unconventional configurations .",
    "the physical principles involved are conservation laws , such as the conservation of energy and momentum across the discontinuity .",

    "accordingly , at a temporal discontinuity , an incident wave splits into a forward- and a backward - propagating waves while incurring shift in the angular frequency .",
    "the conservation of @xmath27 suggests that corresponding physical conservation law invoked at a temporal discontinuity is the conservation of momentum flow of the wave .",
    "this implies that the momentum flow of the incident wave must be equal to the momentum flow of the scattered wave at the discontinuity , which splits the scattered wave into a forward- and backward - propagating waves . the continuity condition for a space - harmonic wave",

    "this scalar representation avoids ambiguity in the correct form of the continuity condition at temporal discontinuities , since the expressions for the energy and momentum densities are unambiguous for scalar waves .",
    "this representation however does not limit the applicability of the proposed method , since what is actually modeled is a spatial scattering problem , not a temporal scattering one , and the correct continuity conditions are therefore well - defined .",
