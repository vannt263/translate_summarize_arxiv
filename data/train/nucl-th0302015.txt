    "in addition , we identify the probability @xmath130 with the size distribution of the domains containing the liquid phase .",
    "our choice of the instant for the onset of the phase separation is also supported by the observation that this time roughly coincides with the beginning of the plateau observed in the behavior of the ratio @xmath163 .",
    "thus , while fluctuations continue to grow with time , the size distribution @xmath130 does not change considerably . the times for the beginning of the plateau in the three cases shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , corresponding to @xmath168 , are @xmath169 respectively .    in order to assess the validity of our approach , we compare the results of our calculations with the corresponding experimental data by identifying the probability @xmath130 with the distribution of the fragment yield observed in processes of nuclear multifragmentation .",
    "the probability @xmath130 is calculated with the value of @xmath163 at the plateau .",
    "like in ref .",
    "@xcite , finite  size and surface effects are not included in our model , consequently a transition from surface to bulk multifragmentation , as suggested recently by the analysis of the isis results @xcite , can not be described within our approach .",
    "however , we expect that our treatment should reliably account for the gross features of the bulk instabilities of nuclear matter , at least at a qualitative level .",
    "since experimentally the fragments are detected according to their charge , we have to transform @xmath130 into the corresponding function of @xmath170 , @xmath171 . for this purpose , we assume a homogeneous distribution for the charge , @xmath172a$ ] , with @xmath173 and use @xmath174 , that corresponds to the average asymmetry of the nuclear systems considered .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that the probability @xmath175 can be fitted with good accuracy by a power law @xmath176 .",
    "the parameter @xmath177 depends only on the expansion rate of nuclear matter , once the temperature and density at @xmath51 have been fixed .",
    "we have taken the initial values @xmath134 and @xmath178 , however , even if the temperature is changed in a rather large interval , the value of the ratio @xmath163 at the plateau does not change appreciably . in fig .  [",

    "figure [ fig4 ] shows a moderate rise of @xmath177 when the energy of the hydrodynamic motion increases .",
    "the cause of the expansion can be either dynamical , following an initial compression , or thermal , due to a release of energy in the bulk of the nuclear system from very energetic particles , for instance protons , antiprotons or pions . in both the cases",

    "[ fig5 ] a comparison is made between the charge distributions predicted by our approach and recent experimental data obtained by the the indra collaboration for @xmath185 and @xmath187 collisions at @xmath186 and at @xmath188 respectively @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , the same comparison is made for @xmath189 collisions at @xmath190 @xcite .",

    "we have normalized both the experimental and the calculated distributions to one in order to perform the comparison on an absolute scale .",
    "the agreement between experimental data and our calculated charge distributions is quite satisfactory for @xmath191 at the lower incident energies of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , and for @xmath192 at the higher energy of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . for the higher values of @xmath170",
    "the observed distributions display a steeper slope than that predicted by our calculations .",
    "this faster decrease of the experimental yields should be ascribed to finite  size effects @xcite that have not been included in our nuclear matter treatment .",
    "the comparison also show that experimental data at higher energy are better reproduced with smaller values of the parameter @xmath163 and correspondingly larger values of @xmath177 , compared with the values needed to reproduce the data at lower energy .",
    "this trend is explained by our scheme , since a growth of the radial collective energy corresponds to an increase of @xmath177 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) and it is reasonable to expect that for central collisions the radial collective motion becomes faster when the incident energy increases .    a further remark about the effective exponent @xmath177 .",
    "it has been experimentally observed that the onset of an expansion in nuclear matter is a signal for a transition from surface  dominated to bulk emission , as expected for a spinodal decomposition , and that the power  law parameter @xmath177 grows with excitation energy for expanding nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "our results are in qualitative agreement with this observed behavior and so is our estimate of the radial collective energy . however , the experimental values of @xmath177 reported in ref .",
    "@xcite are systematically larger than our values .",
    "we have studied the density fluctuations of expanding nuclear matter within a one  body treatment of nuclear dynamics . in our approach",
    "the fluctuations are generated by adding a stochastic term to the mean field and they develop about a local  equlibrium state described by a hydrodynamic expansion .",
    "this additional random force is constrained by an extension of the usual fluctuation ",
    "dissipation theorem to the case of uniformly expanding systems . in this more general context , we have confirmed the main results obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite about the particular physical conditions in which a white  noise assumption for the stochastic field can be retained : the density and temperature of the system should be sufficiently close to the borders of the spinodal region in the ( @xmath193 ) plane , so that the limit @xmath106 gives a reasonable approximation to the density  density response . in this case",
    "the equilibrium fluctuations can be adequately described by means of thermodynamic functions .",
    "we have extended the results obtained for the probability distribution of fluctuations in a system at local - equilibrium to unstable situations .",
    "this has been done by extrapolating the relevant quantities across the boundary of the spinodal region .",
    "because of the linear approximation used for evaluating the response of the system to the stochastic force , the probability distribution of the fluctuations is gaussian .",
    "the variance of the distribution at a given point in the ( @xmath193 ) plane , strongly depends on the expansion velocity and instabilities are favoured in the case of slower expansions .    in sec .",
    "[ pp ] we have discussed a procedure to determine the size distribution of the domains containing correlated density fluctuations .",
    "this procedure is quite general and can be applied to any gaussian distribution . for the size distribution",
    "we have found an expression similar to that obtained in ref .",
    "it again contains only one parameter , the ratio between the dynamical correlation length and the mean interparticle spacing , @xmath163 .",
    "however , in the present case the time behavior of @xmath128 is mainly determined by the expansion velocity , in other words by the collective energy stored in the excited nuclear system .",
    "in particular , the parameter @xmath163 displays a flat behavior in time after a certain instant that depends on the expansion velocity .",
    "roughly at this time , the amplitude of fluctuations acquires at least twice its initial value and keeps growing .",
    "therefore , the decomposition of the system can be viewed as a quasi stationary process .    in sec .",
    "[ bb ] we have compared the obtained mass distribution to the yield of intermediate ",
    "mass fragments observed in the multifragmentation of heavy nuclei .",
    "the comparison with experiment has shown that our approach fairly reproduces the measured charge distributions with @xmath194 for collisions at lower energy and with @xmath195 at higher energies .",
    "since we have modeled the system as infinite nuclear matter , we expect to overestimate the number of large fragments . however , it could be worthwhile studying whether and how the finite size effects could become more important with increasing incident energy .",
    "our approach does account for both the power ",
    "law distribution found experimentally and the observed behavior of the effective exponent with the excitation energy , but the calculated exponent is systematically smaller than that determined from experiments .",
    "this discrepancy deserves further investigation .      in this appendix",
    "we briefly discuss the statistical properties of nuclear matter that undergoes the expansion described in sec .",
    "[ oo ] . for this hydrodynamic motion",
    "we can assume that in the local reference frame moving with the hydrodynamic velocity @xmath50 , the physical system is described by the equilibrium density matrix : @xmath196 where @xmath197 is the partition function and @xmath198 is the hamiltonian in the local reference frame @xmath199 it can be shown that , for a generic couple of states @xmath200 and @xmath201 @xmath202 where @xmath203 is a gauge function such that @xmath204 . thus , the statistical density matrix of eq .",

    "( [ stat ] ) reproduces the correct expression both for the collective current and for the density of the hydrodynamic kinetic energy @xmath207 and @xmath208 where @xmath209 is the density of the intrinsic kinetic energy .",
    "the observables that commutate with @xmath11 take the same mean value as for a homogeneous medium at equilibrium , having the specific values of density and temperature at a given instant .",
    "the same result holds for the equal  time correlation functions of such observables .",
    "in particular , for the density fluctuations we obtain @xmath210    as far as the correlation functions at different times are concerned , the result of eq .",
    "( [ resp ] ) of sec .",
    "[ oo ] suggests that , when the collective expansion is slow with respect to the fermi velocity , these functions depend only on the values of density and temperature of the system at a given instant . in this case",
    ", we can reasonably neglect the velocity field @xmath211 in the expression of the density matrix when evaluating the density correlations .",
    "then we expect that a instantaneous fluctuation  dissipation relation still holds for a medium undergoing a hydrodynamic uniform expansion .",
