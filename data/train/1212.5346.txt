    "the mathematical framework of quantum field theory ( qft ) is a powerful tool for the description of elementary particle interactions .",
    "the concept of renormalization and the technique of the @xmath8-operation generate renormalizable models of qft as self - consistent tools for a phenomenological analysis  @xcite .",
    "the standard model ( sm ) of `` all interactions '' is formulated entirely as a local quantum field theoretical model .",
    "the proof of its renormalizability has required some extension of the standard techniques  @xcite . despite the success in explaining the properties of interactions at high energies , a closed - form solution of the sm is still missing .",
    "the main route for a quantitative investigation is still the use of perturbation theory ( pt ) where one expands in the small coupling constant where the coefficients of the perturbation series are computed in terms of integrals represented by feynman diagrams .",
    "the classical example of the perturbation theory approach has been developed in the context of qed which is part of the sm .",
    "after renormalization of qed there are two parameters  the electron mass and the fine structure constant @xmath9  which are to be fitted to observables in terms of a perturbation series in @xmath9 . with @xmath10 being small",
    ", the precision of the results is impressive .",
    "however , the question has been raised about the behaviour of pt series at high orders .",
    "arguments have been put forward that the series is merely an asymptotic one  @xcite .",
    "this has caused much interest in the summation of asymptotic series in qft  @xcite .",
    "different theoretical aspects of the problem have been discussed in ref .",
    ". a quantitative investigation of the perturbation series in qft and the question of its convergence has been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .    as concerns the problem of pt convergence",
    "it has been realized that one can identify some `` important '' terms in the entire pt series and resum them .",
    "for example , `` large logs '' have first been resummed in  @xcite .",
    "these first results even provoked extreme statements about the fate of local qft  @xcite .",
    "the correct interpretation of the `` resummed '' results emerged within the technique of the renormalization group  @xcite ( as a review , see ref .",
    "different types of resummation have been suggested later on : the analysis of classical solutions  @xcite , the famous example of the @xmath11 expansion in qcd  @xcite , the large @xmath12 limit in qed  @xcite , and the naive nonabelianization in qcd  @xcite .    a precision analysis of the sm requires an extensive use of the renormalization group ( rg ) .",
    "the energy scales of sm are quite different and the coupling constants ( especially @xmath13 ) are quite large .",
    "indeed , the electroweak scale given by @xmath14 and @xmath15 is quite high while the hadronic scales are rather low as e.g.  given by @xmath16 and the light hadron masses at around @xmath17 .",
    "the process of deep inelastic scattering allows one to probe a wide range of scales by varying @xmath18 .",
    "modern experiments include hadrons ( lhc ) that requires the analysis of hadronization and the use of qcd at this scale with @xmath19 .",
    "thus the use of pt in @xmath20 at low energies @xmath21 requires resummation as the convergence is slow .",
    "let us list a few technical issues used in the perturbative description of the phenomenology of the sm :    * use of higher order pt corrections including nnlo corrections which has almost become a standard ; * precise definition of the expansion parameter or the choice of the renormalization scheme .",
    "the @xmath22-scheme is a standard for technical reasons since dimensional regularization has become the main computational framework for the calculation of radiative corrections .",
    "however , other more physical schemes are also in use such as @xmath23 from the coloumb part of the potential of heavy quarks when using nonrelativistic qcd to describe the dynamics of heavy quark production near threshold ; * resummation of some infinite subsets of the perturbation series in @xmath13 .",
    "the most popular way of improving perturbation theory is the use of the rg to sum powers of e.g.  logs @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "but some other ways are also used : the @xmath12 dominance ( naive nonabelianization ) which sums terms of the form @xmath26 , or effects of analytic continuation between euclidean and minkowskian regions that basically deal with terms @xmath27  @xcite .    in case of using infinite subsets of the perturbation series ,",
    "pt allows for nonpolynomial terms in @xmath13 .",
    "the pt series are asymptotic and resummation may provide terms that interfere with non - perturbative expansions for the description of some processes that account for terms of the form @xmath28 : higher twists in light - cone type expansions , or condensate type terms for the expansion of correlation functions at short distance .",
    "this means that numerical values of such non - perturbative parameters depends on how the pt series are treated .",
    "this is very important for the analysis of hadronic @xmath0 decays .",
    "the theoretical description is simple and related to @xmath1 annihilation .",
    "an unprecedented number of pt terms are available .",
    "it is clear that the structure of the series is important .",
    "also it is not an academic exercise as it is important for hadronic contributions to @xmath29 @xcite and to the muon @xmath30 @xcite which are important for constraints on the higgs mass and are also key players in constraining new physics search beyond the sm  @xcite . and",
    ", it is also a field of interest of dima kazakov .",
    "a classic example of application of the pt series in qcd is the analysis of the @xmath1 cross section  @xcite .",
    "the relevant expansion parameter is large , such that a requisite accuracy requires a high order pt expansion .",
    "with such a large number of terms one may already encounter the asymptotic nature of the perturbation series in which case no further increase of precision is possible .",
    "the main problem for the theory is convergence and the interpretation of the numerical values given by the series .",
    "an additional freedom and also complication is that the expansion parameter is not uniquely determined and the series should be analyzed in a scheme - invariant way  @xcite . because of the freedom to redefine the scheme it is difficult to judge the quality of convergence of the series . in this section",
    "we present a way to bypass this complication by establishing a relation between observables .      within massless perturbative qcd",
    "the same green s function determines the hadronic contribution to the @xmath0-decay width and the moments of the @xmath1 cross section .",
    "this allows one to obtain relations between physical observables in the two processes up to an unprecedented high order of perturbative qcd  @xcite .",
    "a precision measurement of the @xmath0 decay width allows one then to predict with high accuracy the first few moments of the spectral density in @xmath1 annihilation integrated up to @xmath31 .",
    "the question of numerical convergence is influenced to a large extent by the freedom of choosing the renormalization scheme for the truncated perturbation series  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to obtain predictions for observables which are renormalization scheme independent .",
    "we compare moments of the spectral density in @xmath1 annihilation and the hadronic contributions to @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "the reduced decay width @xmath33 appearing in @xmath34 is determined by massless perturbative qcd , for which the axial and vector contributions are identical .",
    "the expansion for @xmath33 starts directly with @xmath35 , where @xmath36 . in @xmath1 annihilation",
    "the cross section is determined by the imaginary part of the vacuum polarization function , @xmath37 in perturbative qcd one has @xmath38 with @xmath39 .",
    "we define moments of @xmath40 , @xmath41 such that @xmath42 eq .",
    "( [ eqn2 ] ) can be inverted within perturbation theory .",
    "one can then express the perturbative representation of one observable , i.e.  any given @xmath1 moment @xmath43 , in powers of @xmath33 using the perturbative expansion of the @xmath0-decay observable .",
    "the strong coupling constant @xmath13 in any given scheme serves only as an intermediate agent to obtain relations between physical observables .",
    "the reexpression of one perturbative observable through another is a perfectly legitimate procedure in perturbation theory and the result is independent of the choice of the renormalization scheme .",
    "one finds @xmath44 where the coefficients @xmath45 are given in the appendix .    for @xmath46 one can investigate the convergence properties of the series for the first few moments .",
    "one obtains @xmath47 one clearly observes the divergent behaviour of the perturbation series for the moments @xmath48 .",
    "since the relations between different sets of observables are scheme independent , there is no freedom in the redefinition of the expansion parameter .",
    "one sees very poor convergence .",
    "therefore , the question is whether the asymptotic regime has already been reached .",
    "how can the asymptotic nature of the series reveal itself ? with a redefinition of the charge one can create any type of the series that hides the true rate of convergence .",
    "therefore , one should work in a scheme invariant way .",
    "we concentrate on the analysis of the @xmath0-system only .",
    "the spectral density has been calculated with a very high degree of accuracy within perturbation theory ( see e.g. @xcite ) and has been confronted with experimental data to a very high degree of precision  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite arguments have been given that , within the finite order perturbation theory , the ultimate theoretical precision has been reached already now .",
    "the limit of precision exists due to the asymptotic nature of the perturbation theory series .",
    "the actual magnitude of this limiting precision depends on the numerical value of the coupling constant which is the expansion parameter .",
    "we do not discuss power corrections here  @xcite .",
    "the central quantity of interest in the @xmath0 system is the hadronic spectral density which can be measured in the finite energy interval @xmath49 .",
    "the appropriate quantities to be analyzed are the moments .",
    "we define moments of the spectral density by @xmath50 ( @xmath51 is chosen to be the unity of mass ) .",
    "the invariant content of the investigation of the spectrum , i.e.  independent of any definition of the charge , would be the simultaneous analysis of all the moments .    in order to get rid of artificial scheme - dependent constants in the perturbation theory expressions for the moments we define an effective coupling @xmath52 directly on the physical cut by the relation",
    "@xmath53 all the constants that may appear due to a particular choice of the renormalization scheme are absorbed into the definition of the effective charge ( see e.g.@xcite ) . when defining the effective charge directly by @xmath54 itself we obtain perturbative corrections to the moments only because of the running of @xmath13 . without @xmath13 running",
    "one would have @xmath55 at any given order of pt the running of the coupling @xmath52 contains only logarithms of @xmath56 , @xmath57 where @xmath58 , @xmath59 . at fixed order of pt",
    "the effects of running die out for large @xmath60 moments improving the convergence of the series @xmath61 for large @xmath60 the moments behave better because the infrared region of integration is suppressed but in high orders they start to diverge . for large @xmath60 , the coefficients of the series in eq .",
    "( [ momff ] ) are saturated by the lowest power of the logarithm .    to suppress experimental errors from the high energy end of the spectrum",
    ", the modified system of moments @xmath62 can be used . the integral in eq .",
    "( [ intmomkl ] ) is dominated by contributions from the low scale region .",
    "a disadvantage of choosing such moments is that the factor @xmath63 enhances the infrared region strongly and ruins the perturbation theory convergence .",
    "as an example one has @xmath64 which shows a poor convergence .",
    "the reason is the contribution of the logarithmic terms @xmath65 and @xmath66 which grow as @xmath67 and @xmath68 for large @xmath69 .",
    "the large difference in accuracy between the moments @xmath70 and @xmath71 is a general feature of the moment observables at the fifth order of perturbation theory : one can not get a uniform smallness at this order for several moments at the same time . for any single moment",
    ", one can always redefine the charge and make the series converge well at any desired rate , but then other moments become bad in terms of this redefined charge .",
    "the invariant statement about the asymptotic growth is that the system of moments @xmath72 including @xmath73 can not be treated perturbatively at the fifth order of perturbation theory .    in order to demonstrate this in a scheme invariant way",
    ", we choose the second moment ( which is already well convergent ) as a definition of our experimental charge and find @xmath74 there is no convergence .",
    "having in mind that the series expansion has reached the ultimate accuracy , we try to avoid expansions and analyze the system in a different but still concise way  @xcite .",
    "the observation is that any perturbation theory observable generates a scale due to dimensional transmutation and this is its internal scale .",
    "it is natural for a numerical analysis ( and this is also our suggestion ) to determine this scale first and then to transform the result into a @xmath75-scheme using renormalization group invariance .",
    "we use the explicit renormalization scheme invariance of the theory to bring the result of the perturbation theory calculation into a special scheme first , followed by a numerical analysis in this particular scheme . only after that we transform",
    "the obtained numbers into the @xmath75 reference - scheme .",
    "a dimensional scale in qcd emerges as a boundary value parameterizing the evolution trajectory of the coupling constant .",
    "the renormalization group equation @xmath76 is solved by the integral @xmath77 with @xmath78 the @xmath75-scheme parameter @xmath79 is defined through the expansion @xmath80 the evolution trajectory of the coupling constant is parametrized by the scale parameter @xmath79 and the coefficients of the @xmath81 function @xmath82 with @xmath83 ( see e.g. ref .",
    "the evolution is invariant under the renormalization group transformation @xmath84 with the simultaneous change @xmath85 where @xmath86 is left invariant and @xmath87 this invariance is violated at higher orders of the coupling constant because one has omitted higher orders for the @xmath81 functions .",
    "this is the source for different numerical outputs of analyses in different schemes .",
    "we introduce an effective charge @xmath88 @xcite and extract the parameter @xmath89 which is associated with @xmath90 through eq .",
    "( [ lqcd ] ) with an effective @xmath81 function @xmath91 in this procedure the only perturbative objects present are the @xmath81 functions related to @xmath1 annihilation ( in eq .",

    "( [ betatau ] ) ) .",
    "we treat them both as concise expressions , and at every order of the analysis we use the whole information of the perturbation theory calculation . for the coupling constant in the @xmath75 scheme",

    "yes , but then one has to resum !",
    "since new higher order terms in the perturbation series will not become available in the near future for @xmath1 annihilation or the @xmath0 decays , it is tempting to speculate on the general structure of the series within pt  @xcite .",

    "going beyond finite order pt directly by taking into account rg logs in @xmath54 does not work . using a simple approximation @xmath96 and @xmath97",
    "one finds @xmath98 with factorial growth which is not borel summable .",
    "the reason is the landau pole in the expression for @xmath99 or the divergence of the integrand outside the convergence circle @xmath100 .",
    "higher order terms in @xmath101 are important  @xcite .    for an estimate of the uncertainties of the theoretical predictions for the @xmath0 lepton width",
    ", different approaches have been used for the definition of the integration over the infrared region .",
    "this problem has been widely discussed in the literature ( see , e.g.  ref .",
    "we propose a set of schemes that regularize the infrared behaviour of the coupling constant in general and allow one to use any reference scheme for the high energy domain  @xcite .",
    "all these schemes are perturbatively equivalent at high energies .",
    "the uncertainties that come from the low energy region are quite essential as our study will show .",

    "the example shows that a particular way of summing an infinite number of specific perturbative terms for the @xmath81 function can cure the landau pole problem .",
    "no nonperturbative terms are added but the freedom of choosing a renormalization scheme for an infinite series was used .",
    "this result can be considered either as a pure pt result in some particular rge after an infinite resummation or as a sort of pad approximation of some real @xmath81 function that may also include nonperturbative terms .",
    "the only important point is that the running coupling obeying the rg equation with such a @xmath81 function has a smooth continuation to the infrared region .",
    "because the expansion parameter becomes large in the infrared region , the polynomial approximation is invalid in this domain .",
    "this is a particular example of the general situation that the expansion in the unphysical parameter @xmath13 is incorrect and the appropriate way to proceed is to expand one physical quantity through another .",
    "consider an example with @xmath109 in this case the integral @xmath110 can be found explicitly  @xcite .",
    "the rg equation for the effective charge @xmath52 is given by @xmath111 and @xmath112 reads @xmath113 the last term gives the `` condensate '' contribution up to logarithmic corrections @xmath114 .",
    "this example shows that a change of the evolution in the infrared region resums factorials .",
    "the last term can not be detected by integrating the series near @xmath115 .    in order to study higher orders of pt , the borel transformation is often used .",
    "the borel analysis for this example reads @xmath116 and the borel image @xmath117 is @xmath118 .",
    "the pt series with all coefficients known does not allow one to restore the exact answer through borel summation .",

    "one then obtains @xmath128 where the integral over the hadronic spectrum is computable in perturbative qcd .",

    "the value of @xmath90 is outside the convergence region .",

    "in this case , the coupling has an infrared fixed point with the value @xmath196 .",
    "if adler s function starts with another power of the coupling constant , as is the case for gluonic observables , this picture will change . for @xmath197",
    "the spectral density in the leading - order @xmath81-function approximation reads @xmath198 and an effective coupling is @xmath199 the @xmath81 function for the effective coupling obtained from eq .",
    "( [ effm2 ] ) , @xmath200 differs from the @xmath81 function of the effective coupling @xmath201 ( c.f.eq .",
    "( [ almev ] ) ) , @xmath202 at next - to - leading order .",
    "thus , resummation on the contour and on the positive semi - axis of the @xmath56 plane differs by the integral over the negative real semi - axis for @xmath56 .    in the context of the contour formulation",
    "it is not essential what particular point - by - point behaviour exists in the infrared region . for the analytically continued correlator",
    "this is not important unless the contour crosses a nonanalytic region . whatever singularities exist in the infrared region ( regions b , b , or b  in fig .",
    "[ figa ] ) , the contour includes them .",
    "the resummation on the contour is explicitly perturbative . for the resummation on the cut ,",
    "the extrapolation of the running of the coupling constant to the infrared region is crucial since one has to interpret the integration over the infrared region .",
    "formal manipulations with @xmath203 give @xmath204 not all expressions in  ( [ irborel ] ) are well - defined .",
    "this is particularly true for the third form being a borel representation .",
    "the problem can be reformulated as a divergence of the asymptotic series . indeed , by expanding the expression for the running coupling under the integration sign in a pt series one has @xmath205 the summation of the series in eq .",
    "( [ serir ] ) is related to the interpretation of the integral .",
    "therefore , an integrable behaviour of the coupling constant at small @xmath56 offers a recipe for the summation of the asymptotic series .",
    "this solution is strongly model dependent because the extrapolation of the evolution into the infrared region is essentially arbitrary . the explicit form of the extrapolation in eq .",
    "( [ sigmadef ] ) gives an extrapolation motivated by analytic continuation .",
    "it can also be considered as a special change of the renormalization scheme  @xcite . indeed , for the coupling @xmath201 with the evolution given in eq .",
    "( [ almev ] ) one obtains an infrared fixed point . without the negative part of the spectrum that emerges in the exact treatment of quantities originally defined in the euclidean domain",
    "the analytic moments can be defined by @xmath206 one can relate these moments to the moments on the contour by the relation @xmath207 which contains an explicit `` non - perturbative '' term .",
    "the question of uniqueness of the resummation is important .",
    "however , it is only relevant if many terms of the pt expansion are known .",
    "it happens that this uniqueness can be usefully employed in multi - loop computations  @xcite .",
    "note that it is also important to have examples of higher order pt behaviour in simple qft models as unique record - breaking computations show  @xcite . in some cases uniqueness",
    "is good laboratory for checking multi - loop techniques  @xcite .",
    "the methods are also applied in some exotic areas as nonlinear sigma model , topological theories , and susy  @xcite .",
    "we have reviewed different ways of interpreting perturbation theory results for the description of @xmath0-decay observables .",
    "experimental data are very precise and theory matches it by unprecedented numbers of pt terms .",
    "higher orders of pt are available for many cases that allows both for the description of data and for the extraction of the parameters of the theory with high accuracy .",
    "however , the pt series converge slowly requiring improvement that can be achieved through :    * manipulation with schemes for a set of related observables avoiding artificial intermediate quantities such as @xmath22 quantities ; * different resummation techniques ; * the avoidance of unnecessary expansions  treating final polynomials in the coupling as exact expressions , e.g.  @xmath81 function and anomalous dimensions in renormalization group equations for coefficient functions of operator product expansions    and some other improvements that you name .",
    "this richness is available due to rg properties that allows one to control the scaling behaviour and the invariance of the theory .",
