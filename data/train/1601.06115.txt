    "for a long time bars in disc galaxies were explained by a so - called bar mode instability , discovered in the first @xmath0-body simulations of soft - centred stellar models @xcite .",
    "however , applicability of this phenomena to models with cusps , for which a volume density @xmath1 with positive index @xmath2 in the centre , has been questioned for two reasons .",
    "first , simple estimates show that in the case of interest the angular velocity @xmath3 and epicyclic frequency @xmath4 are @xmath5 , which indicates the presence of the inner lindblad resonance ( ilr ) for any bar pattern speed @xmath6 .",
    "the ilr absorbs waves @xcite and damps the formation of global modes by breaking the feed - back loop for wave amplification @xcite .",
    "second , hubble deep field observations show a significant decline of the fraction of barred galaxies beyond redshifts @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "if usual bar formation begins to operate just after the stellar disc is formed , at these redshifts we should observe approximately the same fraction of barred galaxies . according to @xcite ,",
    "these objections call for alternative mechanisms of bar formation for cuspy galaxies .    despite the theoretical input",
    ", we know examples of n - body simulations that incorporate cuspy models which demonstrate an exponential growth of bars @xcite , and here we verify their conclusion with a larger number of particles .",
    "our main goal is to explain how such bars are formed in the presence of the ilr . throughout this paper",
    "we analyse bisymmetric ( @xmath8 ) modes only .",
    "it is still a question whether our milky way galaxy accommodates a cuspy bulge or not .",
    "the rotation curves published earlier @xcite suggest a bulge with mass about @xmath9 solar mass and a weak cuspiness ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , more recent models taking into account non - circular gas motion shift these estimates toward less massive and more extended bulges @xcite . anyway , our model galaxy adopts parameters possibly inherent to the milky way .",
    "in particular , we assume a weak cusp with @xmath10 in the bulge , and and nfw dark halo rescaled from the via lactea ii cosmological simulations @xcite .",
    "n - body simulations of the rigid cuspy models also yield bars .",
    "@xcite noted that bulgeless models with live halos evolve faster and produce better shaped bars . in terms of unstable modes , this means larger growth rates .",
    "interesting questions are related to whether this holds in cuspy models , and if the pattern speeds of bars change substantially under this replacement .",
    "this will be a by - product of our main investigation .    in stability theory , bar and spiral",
    "modes are described by solutions of the linearised collisionless equations of stellar dynamics exponentially growing in time @xcite . at the moment , however , finding unstable global modes is impossible , if the stellar disc has a finite thickness , or if particles rather than a fixed external potential ( rigid models ) are used to represent the spheroidal components",
    ". furthermore , except for a few special cases ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , unstable modes were only found reliably in soft - centred models , i.e. in the absence of a central cusp .",
    "a comparison of the relevant matrix methods for calculation of unstable global modes can be found in @xcite .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following . in section 2",
    "we describe the basic model used in section 3 to show by means of numerical simulations , with a different number of particles and calculation schemes , that bar instability really takes place in cuspy models , both with live and rigid halo and bulge . ignoring a difference between thick and razor - thin discs , one can try to reproduce unstable bar modes of the rigid models by matrix methods .",
    "however , preserving the cuspy velocity curve profile we obtain no unstable modes .",
    "section 4 considers potential issues and details of the global mode calculation for stellar discs , and compares characteristics of the unstable modes for discs with different vertical scales . in the final part ,",
    "section 5 , we discuss the results and outline some perspectives .",
    "our 3-component model is adopted from @xcite , and consists of the stellar disc , bulge , and dark matter halo .",
    "the disc is exponential , with radial scale @xmath11kpc , truncation radius 15 kpc , mass @xmath12m@xmath13 , and characteristic height @xmath14pc ( @xmath15 is defined so that the surface density @xmath16 ) .",
    "the radial velocity dispersion @xmath17 is exponential , with central value @xmath18km / s and radial scale length @xmath19 . in the solar neighbourhood ( @xmath20kpc ) ,",
    "the radial velocity dispersion is @xmath21km / s and the surface density is 50 m@xmath13/pc@xmath22 .",
    "the density profile for the bulge is taken in the form @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a spherical radius . instead of the scale density @xmath25",
    ", we use the bulge velocity scale @xmath26 r^2_e \\rho_\\textrm{b } \\right\\ } ^{1/2}\\ . \\label{eq : bulge_veld}\\ ] ] with this definition , @xmath27 corresponds to the depth of the gravitational potential associated with the bulge . for the bulge ,",
    "free parameters are the srsic index @xmath28 , @xmath29 km / s , @xmath30 kpc ; the derived parameters are @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and mass of the bulge @xmath33 m@xmath13 .",
    "the target density profile of the halo is a truncated nfw profile with scale @xmath34kpc , truncation radius @xmath35 kpc , and total mass @xmath36 m@xmath13 . despite the halo density distribution being more cuspy than the bulge one , the latter dominates in the rotation curve down to @xmath37 kpc . in section 5",
    "we argue that the parameters used in our model give a disc resolved only up to @xmath38 kpc , thus the cusp index for the model @xmath39 .",
    "the upper panel ( a ) in fig.[fig1 ] shows the total circular velocity profile ( solid curve ) and contributions of separate components .",
    "the rotation curve is bulge - dominated at radii @xmath40 kpc , and halo - dominated at @xmath41 kpc . at radius @xmath42 kpc , where the disc contribution peaks , the force from the halo is about 2/3 of the force from the disc in the galactic plane .    z    the angular velocity profile @xmath3 is presented in panel ( b ) , along with the curves",
    "@xmath43 which give positions of the inner and outer lindblad resonances ilr and olr respectively",
    ". the ilr for a pattern speed @xmath6 is determined from the relation @xmath44 physically , @xmath45 determines a precession rate of nearly circular orbits and plays an important role in the formation of bars in razor thin discs @xcite ; thus one can refer to it as a ` precession ' curve . for the basic model , the curve diverges weakly at @xmath46 as @xmath47 with @xmath48 .",
    "panel ( c ) of fig.[fig1 ] shows the toomre @xmath49 profile @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the disc surface density .",
    "the profile remains below 3 in the region @xmath52 kpc .",
    "the minimum @xmath53 is attained at @xmath54 kpc .",
    "initial conditions of stars in single mass simulations have been generated by the ` galactics ' code provided by @xcite .",
    "numerical calculations have been performed with three different codes .    a particle  mesh code called superbox-10 ( bien et al .",
    "2013 ) solves the poisson equation by fast fourier transform .",
    "the number of grid points @xmath55 for each coordinate is the same and is taken so that the number of grid cells is comparable with the number of particles .",
    "the code uses grids with three sizes .",
    "the largest grid allows one to simulate an extensive halo and interaction between galaxies .",
    "medium - size grids are designed to study separate galaxies and is used for the disc in our case , and the smallest grids are used to resolve fine structures in galactic centres . in all our runs @xmath56 , and",
    "the grid radii were 300 , 30 and 1 kpc .",
    "effective gravity softening @xmath57 in particle ",
    "mesh codes is equal to half of the grid cell @xcite , so in the centre within 1 kpc @xmath58pc , while outside the centre in the disc @xmath59pc .    for the largest simulations in our set of runs we use the modification of the recently developed and very popular @xmath0-body tree - gpu code implementation bonsai2 @xcite , which includes expansion for force computation up to quadrupole order .",
    "the code was used with very conservative opening angle ( @xmath60 = 0.5 ) and with the individual gravitational softening option ( the softening was set to 10 pc ) . in our runs",
    "we use the simple leap - frog integration scheme with a fixed time - step @xmath61 t = 0.2  myr to advance the particle positions and velocities during the calculation .",
    "for the simulations of the rigid halo / bulge models and to analyse the snapshot data of all simulations we also use the self coded tree - gpu based gravity calculation routine ber - gal0 @xcite , which includes expansion for force computation up to monopole order , with the same ( @xmath60 = 0.5 ) opening angle .    in the last years",
    "we have already used and extensively tested our hardware accelerator based on the tree gravity calculation routine in a few of our galactic dynamics projects and get quite accurate results with a good performance @xcite .",
    "the current set of simulations was carried out with the gpu version of the code using local gpu clusters available at the authors institutions ( ari : kepler , mao : golowood , naoc : laohu ) and also the specially dedicated for sfb 881 ( `` the milky way system '' ) gpu cluster milkyway , located in the jlich supercomputing centre in germany .",
    "tab.[tab_runs_live ] contains parameters of live runs , where all components , disc , bulge and halo , are live , for the basic model .",
    "capital letters denote the numerical code : ` s ' for superbox and ` b ' for bonsai2 . most of the runs have equal mass of the particles within a component , but two runs denoted by ` m ' have multimass halo particles in order to achieve a better resolution in the bar region . for this , we modified the galactics code utilising the same strategy as described in @xcite . in the region between 0.1 and 1 kpc ,",
    "the number density ratio of our multimass and single mass runs varies from 10 to 100 , thus the effective numerical resolution there is enhanced by this factor .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     fig.[fig_ozd ] shows pattern speeds of the modes . for each @xmath62",
    "we have four modes with the highest growth rates which were used to calculate a pattern speed as an average weighted by the growth rates .",
    "these pattern speeds are then used to calculate a smooth fit ( black solid curve ) .",
    "upper and lower limits of the red error bars show pattern speeds of modes with the largest growth rates . as expected , matrix modes appear above the maxima of the precession curves .",
    "n - body modes agree well with the matrix calculations .",
    "fig.[fig_gzd ] shows growth rates of the modes . for each @xmath62",
    "we have shown two maximum growth rates ( upper and lower limits of the error bars ) .",
    "the growth rates were calculated using bar strength ( eq . [ eq : barstr ] ) and wave amplitudes ( eqs .",
    "[ eq : sd1][eq : vp2 ] ) , in both series of n - body runs .",
    "the growth rates obtained with the two methods are quite close .",
    "comparison with matrix equations shows good agreement for 150 , 250 , 300 pc runs .",
    "the model with 100 pc is an outlier , for a reason which is not well understood . in particular , for 6 m run we were unable to determine the pattern speed and growth rate @xmath63 $ ] . for the thicker discs , @xmath64 pc , n - body shows a decrease of the instability , while the matrix method shows a weak trend of instability increase .",
    "a possible reason for the different trends is an effect of increasing vertical velocity dispersion that act similar to the radial velocity dispersion and stabilise the disc , which is not included in the martix method .",
    "in this paper we study bar formation in a galactic model with a cusp and other parameters which our galaxy possibly possesses .",
    "the model consists of three stellar components : exponential disc , cuspy bulge , and nfw halo .",
    "our study includes @xmath0-body simulations with particle  mesh ( pm ) and tree codes , and the calculation of global modes .",
    "first of all , using one ` basic ' model and more than 100 m particles , we definitely show that a bar really forms despite the presence of the ilr .",
    "this is the case in live and rigid halo and bulge runs .",
    "maximum bar radius is achieved soon after saturation of the instability . in the live",
    "runs it is around 5 kpc , with ellipticity of about 0.75 ( tab.[tab_rb_live ] ) . in the rigid runs , the obtained bars are somewhat shorter and rounder : maximum radius is 4.3 kpc , with ellipticity 0.68 ( tab.[tab_rb_rigid ] ) .",
    "substitution of halo and bulge particles with the rigid external potential revealed that rigid cuspy models are less unstable than live ones , i.e. typical growth rates are twice as small .",
    "this is in agreement with results by @xcite obtained for the bulgeless models . at the same time ,",
    "pattern speeds in live and rigid runs are close ( relative difference is 5 per cent or less ) .",
    "stochastic behaviour of n - body models , mentioned e.g. by @xcite for disc evolution after bar formation , is also seen in our runs , especially in the case of the rigid halo and bulge , when growth rates are small .",
    "this manifests itself in appearance of the random lag before the exponential growth of the amplitude , and sometimes in the non - exponential character of the growth .",
    "special techniques are used to obtain models that demonstrate more evident exponential growth ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but here we avoid using it emphasising that stochasticity and shot noise are inherent properties of the stellar systems .",
    "the models demonstrating the exponential growth preserve initial axisymmetric parameters quite well so that the toomre @xmath49 parameter remains unchanged almost until saturation .",
    "this fact allows one to calculate unstable global modes using matrix methods of linear perturbative analysis , and compare them with rigid n - body runs .",
    "while using the cuspy potential in the equatorial plane , no unstable modes are found by the matrix method @xcite .    for usual bar mode instability in thin discs ,",
    "the behaviour of the @xmath65 profile determining the position of the ilr is important .",
    "we emphasise that the resonance radius for the ilr is well defined only for nearly circular motion in razor thin discs . for eccentric orbits in the plane ,",
    "the ilr is a curve in action space .",
    "if the orbit is not planar , frequencies determining the ilr can be approximated if radius @xmath66 is much larger than the maximum elevation @xmath67 above the plane .",
    "however , if @xmath68 , the orbit is essentially 3-dimensional and generally not quasiperiodic .",
    "thus , at radii @xmath68 , the resonances are smeared out and the appeal of an ilr is meaningless .    using a toy model that averages radial forces along the axis perpendicular to the disc plane , we obtain an effective potential and @xmath45 that possesses a maximum .",
    "in other words , the obtained precession curve is typical for cored models , which allows for the unstable modes .",
    "the obtained global modes in models with various vertical scales in the range @xmath69 pc agree well with the @xmath0-body calculations .",
    "matrix calculations show strong dependence of the growth rates from the disc mass .",
    "for example , for @xmath70 only 11 per cent lower than adopted in our models , the obtained growth rates are 2.5 times smaller .",
    "if one can extrapolate these results to live discs preserving the ratio of the growth rates of the live and rigid models at factor of 2 , it means that the galactic disc remains nearly stable ( instability time is larger than age of the universe ) for a long time , and the bar started to form only recently .",
    "our crude estimates using reasonable star formation rates show that during 10 gyr small disc perturbations grow by a factor @xmath71 which is needed for the poisson noise of the disc consisting of @xmath72 particles to grow into a bar .",
    "this fact can explain the observed lack of barred galaxies at redshifts @xmath73 @xcite , and typical ratios of corotation to bar radii , @xmath74 @xcite , as a sign of relatively young bars close to their maximum size .    in this paper",
    "we have revealed an ilr is practically non - existent , taking into consideration the thickness of the disc . on the other hand , according to the waser theory ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , unstable modes could be excited if there is an inner q - barrier and such a barrier shields the existing ilr .",
    "in fact , a cubic dispersion relation by @xcite gives one ` shielded ' mode with the pattern speed @xmath75 km / s / kpc , i.e. very close to predictions of n - body simulations and matrix equations ( shielding starts from 44 km / s / kpc ) . in a separate paper",
    "we plan to explore waser mechanism in more detail using models with different radial velocity dispersions .",
