    "in their paper on noncongruence subgroups atkin and swinnerton - dyer @xcite gave a description of a practical computational algorithm to obtain numerical approximations to modular forms .",
    "their ideas were further developed by hejhal @xcite , strmberg @xcite , booker , strmbergson and venkatesh @xcite to calculate maass waveforms and by selander and strmbergson @xcite to calculate a bely map @xcite .    in this brief note",
    "we describe an iterative algorithm based on these ideas to calculate values of modular functions of any finite index subgroup @xmath1 of the modular group numerically to any given precision and use it to obtain bely maps . to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm we proof the following theorem    let @xmath2 be the permutation given in the appendix",
    ". then the janko group @xmath3 is generated by @xmath4 and @xmath5 and the triple @xmath6 define up to simultaneous conjugation a subgroup @xmath7 of the full modular group @xmath0 with a rational bely map @xmath8 which obeys the equation @xmath9 relating the branching at the elliptic points of order two and three with the polynomial @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 given in the accompanying material .",
    "these polynomials are defined over the number field @xmath13/(a^{10 } - a^{9 } - 2 a^{8 } + 8 a^{7 } - 14 a^{6 } + 35    a^{4 } - 68 a^{3 } + 89 a^{2 } - 74 a + 23)$ ] with the galois group @xmath14 of order 3840 and discriminant @xmath15 .",
    "it is easy to check that the permutations @xmath4 and @xmath5 fulfil the defining relations of the janko group @xmath3 , @xmath16 .",
    "the theorem @xmath17 of magaard @xcite states which of the sporadic groups with triple @xmath6 defines a subgroup @xmath7 of @xmath0 with a riemann surface @xmath18 of genus zero .",
    "in addition this is an admissible for the theorem of millington @xcite and therefore define ( up to simultaneous conjugation ) an index 100 subgroup @xmath1 .",
    "using theorem ( 3.1 ) of hsu @xcite it is easy to verify that the group is a noncongruence subgroup of @xmath0 .",
    "this group has no elliptic point of order 2 and 4 elliptic points of order 3 and 2 cusps of width 1 and 14 cusps of order 7 .",
    "this defines the branching structure of the bely map @xmath8 and the factorization of the polynomials . using the explicit form of the polynomials",
    "an easy calculation shows that @xmath19 which completes the proof .",
    "a number of major improvements make the algorithm numerically stable and efficient enough to use arbitrary precision arithmetic .",
    "the new ideas are : using domain decomposition techniques for the modular tessellation , fast fourier transform to precondition the resulting linear system , krylov subspace methods to solve the resulting linear equations iteratively .",
    "the algorithm can easily be extended to calculate cusp forms and vector valued modular forms .",
    "we have implemented our algorithm in _ haskell _ @xcite which allows to easily write generic arbitrary precision code and to parallelize the domain decomposition .",
    "the determination of large zero bely maps is in general a difficult problem @xcite .",
    "the subject has recently attracted interest and some substantial results were obtained for genus zero belyi maps of degree up to 250 @xcite , the hs sporadic group@xcite , for hurwitz groups @xcite and composite genus 1 belyi maps @xcite . for a detailed review of previously known methods and some new techniques and results",
    "see @xcite and my lecture at the euler institute 2014 @xcite for a more detailed account of complex analytic methods .",
    "let @xmath20 be the projective special linear group over @xmath21 acting on the complex upper half plane @xmath22 by mbius transformations @xmath23 @xmath24 let @xmath25 be a finitely presented group and @xmath26 a finite index subgroup of @xmath25 .",
    "the generators of @xmath25 induce a permutation of the right coset @xmath27 .",
    "then the group @xmath26 is determined up to isomorphism by the permutations induced by the action of the generators of @xmath25 on the right coset @xmath27 .",
    "this fact allows for the classification of all finite index subgroups of @xmath0 . a theorem by millington @xcite states that up to simultaneous conjugation there is a one to one correspondence between triples of permutations @xmath28 with the finite index subgroups of @xmath0 where @xmath29 is the symmetric group of @xmath30 objects ( in this case cosets ) .",
    "let @xmath1 be a finite index subgroup of the modular group of index @xmath30 defined by a triple of permutations as above .",
    "if @xmath7 contains @xmath31 for some fixed integer , @xmath32 , it is called a congruence subgroup otherwise it is called a noncongruence subgroup .",
    "both cases can be distinguished easily by testing relations of the generators @xcite .",
    "a fundamental domain @xmath33 of @xmath7 is a subset of @xmath34 such that for all @xmath35 there is exactly one element @xmath36 for which @xmath37 .",
    "here we choose @xmath38 as fundamental domain for the full modular group .",
    "since @xmath7 is a subgroup of finite index @xmath30 we have @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a list of right coset representatives which implies that @xmath41 is a fundamental domain of @xmath7",
    ".    in general @xmath7 will contain a number of finite index subgroups of of the borel subgroup with fix points in @xmath42 called cusps .",
    "two cusps related by a @xmath36 are called equivalent .",
    "each cycle of @xmath43 gives rise to a cusp ( equivalence class ) with the corresponding cusp width being defined as the length of the cycle .",
    "let @xmath44 enumerate the cycles and let @xmath45 be a list of unique inequivalent cusp representatives and @xmath46 be the width of cusp @xmath47 .",
    "let @xmath48 be the extended complex upper half plane .",
    "a modular function is a complex valued function that extends to a meromorphic function on the compactified upper half plane @xmath49 satisfying @xmath50 for every @xmath51 and every @xmath35 .",
    "the genus of @xmath7 is defined to be the genus of the riemann surface @xmath52 .",
    "here we focus on the genus zero case where the field of modular functions is generated by one modular function usually called hauptmodul .",
    "we choose one of the cusps with the smallest cusp width , @xmath53 , as principal cusp and fix the generator @xmath54 uniquely by imposing a growth condition on it so that as @xmath55 it grows like @xmath56 where @xmath57 and stays finite at all the other cusps .",
    "the rational map @xmath8 is of degree @xmath30 and a famous theorem by bely @xcite asserts that it can be defined up to isomorphism over @xmath58 .",
    "once @xmath59 is determined fix an explicit representation of @xmath60 relating the modular @xmath61 invariant of the full modular group to @xmath62 so that we have @xmath63 for all @xmath35 .",
    "we choose the normalization of the modular @xmath64 invariant such that at the elliptic point of order two the modular invariant takes on the value @xmath65 and vanishes at the elliptic point of order three @xmath66 .",
    "let @xmath67 enumerate the cusps with @xmath68 being the principal cusp .",
    "define @xmath69 where @xmath70 and for the remaining cusps @xmath71 , with @xmath72 , pick a fixed @xmath73 from the solutions of the congruence @xmath74 to define @xcite @xmath75 it is easy to see that @xmath76 sends @xmath47 to infinity and @xmath77 stabilizes @xmath47 .",
    "the modular function can therefore be expanded at each cusp in a poincar series @xcite @xmath78 with @xmath79 and @xmath80 for @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 and ( unknown ) fourier coefficients @xmath84 . here",
    "we set the principal part @xmath85 and fix the arbitrary constant term @xmath86 in agreement with the growth condition .",
    "the fourier coefficients are known to have at most polynomial growth with @xmath87 .",
    "the poincar series for different cusps are obviously not independent .",
    "modular transformations @xmath88 act transitively on the cusps .",
    "zuckerman @xcite used this fact to generate linear relations between the expansions on different cusps for general finite index subgroup @xmath1 .",
    "from an numerical analysis point of view determining a numerical approximation for a modular function is equivalent to solving two laplace equations for two real functions on an infinitely extended domain with complicated `` periodic '' boundary conditions ( coming from the generators of the finite index subgroup ) .",
    "domain decomposition is a technique for the large scale numerical solution of boundary value problems of elliptic partial differential equations .",
    "it goes back to an 1870 paper by h. schwarz @xcite and is one of several constructive techniques of conformal mapping he developed for the uniformization problem .",
    "the basic idea is to solve a dirichlet problem for an elliptic partial differential equation on a complicated domain by decomposing it into simpler overlapping domains on which the dirichlet problem is easily solved .",
    "its convergence for general second order differential equations has been proven by mihlin@xcite for very general domains .",
    "we now explain how to apply these ideas to the calculation of modular functions .    for each cusp with label @xmath67",
    "we define a domain @xmath89 of the complex upper half plane by @xmath90 at this point the important observation here is that the preimage of @xmath91 form an overlapping domain decomposition of the fundamental domain @xmath33 . the domain @xmath89 contains the cosets of the cycle ( cusp ) @xmath67 as well as parts of its neighboring cosets determined by @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "we solve the laplace equation in the domain @xmath89 .",
    "the periodic boundary conditions and the boundary condition as @xmath55 are taken care of by the particular form of the fourier expansion .",
    "the dirichlet boundary condition is given by the values of the hauptmodul calculated at the lower boundary of the domain which are determined by the expansions in the domains @xmath92 with @xmath93 and the upper boundary .",
    "we approximate the modular function by a truncated expansions @xmath94 where we choose @xmath95 with @xmath32 fixed .",
    "suppose now that we already have obtained some approximation for the fourier coefficients at all cusps .",
    "for any given @xmath96 in @xmath34 we can determine algorithmically a unique coset representative @xmath97 such that @xmath98 .",
    "the label @xmath99 can be found uniquely in one of the cycles of @xmath100 , say in cycle @xmath67 , since the permutation group generated by @xmath4 and @xmath5 acts transitively",
    ". then we approximate @xmath59 by @xmath101 . for each @xmath67",
    "we evaluate the approximate modular function according to the procedure outlined above at points @xmath102 for @xmath103 where @xmath104 is chosen such that @xmath104 is a power of two with integer exponent and @xmath105 .",
    "the first condition ensures that we can use the simplest form of fast fourier transform to obtain the fourier coefficients while the second condition avoids aliasing effects .",
    "we then apply fft to determine the expansion coefficients of @xmath106 for every domain .",
    "this completes one step of the domain decomposition iteration .",
    "we can view the procedure as iterative solution of the linear equations for the fourier coefficients with the inhomogeneous part arising from the principal cusp .",
    "the rate of convergence is determined by the largest eigenvalue of the ( linear ) iteration operator which is less than one if the overlap of the domains is finite @xcite which implies linear convergence .",
    "we observe linear convergence when using the simple ( picard ) iteration .",
    "the advantage of the procedure described above is that convergence is guaranteed and it can easily be implemented in multiprecision arithmetic @xcite .",
    "a further advantage is that it can be used as a pre - conditioner for more sophisticated iterative techniques which go under the name of krylov methods @xcite to solve the linear equation . using gmres",
    "@xcite which we implemented in multiprecision we actually do observe quadratic convergence in all cases we have investigated .",
    "one important point is that compared to direct methods the operation count is substantially reduced .",
