    "although tm mixing reduces to tb mixing in the limit that @xmath13 , it is worth emphasising that in general tm mixing involves a reactor angle @xmath0 which could in principle be large or even maximal ( e.g. @xmath14 ) .",

    "however there is no good reason not to include flavons transforming as @xmath19 or @xmath3 and once included they will lead to deviations from tb mixing @xcite in particular it has been noted that they lead to tm mixing @xcite .",
    "however , as remarked above , tm mixing by itself does not account for the smallness of the reactor angle , and in particular the model in @xcite does not provide any explanation for this .",
    "another aspect is that higher order operators in @xmath1 models lead to deviations from tb mixing in a rather uncontrolled way @xcite , and in such models any simple tm structure may be washed out unless the theory is promoted to a renormalisable one in which the higher order operators are under control .",

    "we then propose a renormalisable @xmath5 model of leptons in which the @xmath2 and @xmath3 flavons of @xmath1 are unified into a doublet of @xmath5 which is spontaneously broken to @xmath1 by a flavon which enters the neutrino sector at higher order .",

    "it is argued in @xcite that higher order operators which are allowed by the imposed symmetries should be considered as well , both in @xmath42 as well as in the superpotential that generates the flavon alignments in eq .  .",
    "in general such additional terms would lead to deviations from tb mixing which are important in the light of the latest experimental hints for a non - zero reactor angle @xcite . in order to account for a ( relatively ) large value of @xmath0 the higher order corrections need to be large enough which can be arranged by assuming different suppression scales for different non - renormalisable operators .",
    "this assumption , however , raises the question about the origin of the suppression scales .    in this context , it was pointed out recently that particular ultraviolet ( uv ) completions of flavour models do not necessarily give rise to all effectively allowed terms in the superpotential @xcite .",
    "in fact , it was found that the minimal uv completion of the af model does not generate any deviations from tb mixing .",
    "the simplest way to obtain the desired deviations is to add new messengers to the minimal model such that certain higher order yukawa operators are switched on . in the neutrino sector , the effective non - trivial operators allowed by the symmetries read , [ af - completion ] all of which break tb neutrino mixing",
    ". inspection of the flavour structure of these terms shows that only the first two terms lead to mass matrices that have an eigenvector @xmath43 , thus retaining tm neutrino mixing . however , requiring the messengers that mediate these effective operators to be matter - like , i.e. they should have a @xmath26 charge of 1 , we find that we will always get a contribution from the third term of eq .   as well .",
    "therefore , without introducing new flavon fields , we can not find a simple uv completion of the af model where the neutrino mixing features a trimaximal pattern while breaking the tri - bimaximal one .",
    "the discussion in the previous subsection leads us to consider the case where extra flavons @xmath23 in the @xmath2 representation and @xmath24 in the @xmath3 representations of @xmath1 are added to the model as already shown in table  [ tab - af ] .",
    "this has previously been suggested ( without the see - saw mechanism ) in @xcite where the phenomenological consequences of the lo terms were studied numerically .",
    "however the flavon alignment was not derived in @xcite but simply postulated .",
    "remarkably , although the difference between the @xmath23 and @xmath24 flavon vevs breaks the accidental @xmath38 symmetry and thereby violates tb mixing , the presence of these flavons respects the @xmath37 symmetry and leads to tm mixing .    in this subsection",
    "we consider the effect on the neutrino mass matrices of adding flavons @xmath23 in the @xmath2 representation and/or @xmath24 in the @xmath46 representations . in the subsequent subsection",
    "we consider the vacuum alignment problem including these flavons . assuming the flavon alignments in eq .  , it is straightforward to find the structure of the charged lepton and the light neutrino mass matrices . as the charged lepton yukawa couplings are non - renormalisable , a particular set of messengers is necessary to generate the required couplings .",
    "following @xcite , one can show that a minimal messenger completion does not generate any off - diagonal entries in @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , the leptonic mixing matrix @xmath47 is solely determined by the neutrino sector .",
    "given the symmetries of table  [ tab - af ] , the corresponding renormalisable neutrino part of the superpotential is extended to , w^_a_4  =   y lh_u n^c + ( y_1 _ s + y_2 + y_3  + y_3  ) n^cn^c  .[ynu ] inserting the flavon vacuum alignments in eq .  , and assuming both @xmath23 and @xmath24 as well as sm higgs vevs , we obtain the dirac neutrino mass matrix @xmath31 as well as the right - handed neutrino mass matrix @xmath32 , m_d  =     1&0&0 + 0&0&1 + 0&1&0    y v_u  , [ md ] m_r  =   , [ mr ] where @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",

    "one can easily verify that @xmath43 is an eigenvector of @xmath53 , the eigenvalue being @xmath54 .",
    "therefore the matrix @xmath52 will have a trimaximally mixed column which , for phenomenological reasons , will be identified as the second column .",
    "the other two columns are more difficult to determine and we will discuss the analytic approximate calculation in section [ sec - analytic ] .",
    "however , they can be parameterised as a linear combination of the first and third columns of the tb mixing matrix @xmath55 .",

    "note that a majorana phase matrix would still have to be multiplied on the right in order to render the right - handed neutrino masses real . disregarding this and other issues about phase conventions ,",
    "we can now rewrite the effective light neutrino mass matrix , m_^ = - m_d^ m_r^-1 m_d^t = -m_d^ u_r^ ( m^_r)^-1 u_r^t m_d^t = - u_^ u_^t  , [ meff ] where the matrix @xmath58 is defined as u _  =   u_r  .[urunu ] due to the trivial structure of @xmath31 , see eq .  , it is unitary and again of trimaximal form .",
    "in fact , @xmath58 differs from @xmath52 only in the interchange of the second and the third row . assuming diagonal charged leptons , the matrix @xmath58 is just the lepton mixing matrix @xmath59 . from eq .",
    "it is then apparent that the dirac neutrino mass matrix in the basis of diagonal right - handed neutrinos and charged leptons , is given by @xmath60 .",
    "in this basis , the columns of @xmath61 are proportional to the columns of @xmath47 , and thus we see that the @xmath1 model with additional @xmath23 and @xmath24 flavons satisfies form dominance @xcite and hence leptogenesis vanishes @xcite .",
    "however , form dominance does not imply that the effective light neutrino mass matrix is form diagonalisable , and indeed this is not the case since the mixing matrix @xmath58 depends on the yukawa couplings and vevs ( which in turn determine the neutrino masses ) . only in the limit where @xmath62",
    "do we recover a form diagonalisable mass matrix corresponding to the tb case .",
    "the size of the deviations from tb mixing are controlled by the parameters @xmath63 and @xmath64 as well as the vevs @xmath65 and @xmath66 . from the vacuum alignment discussion in the next subsections ,",
    "however , there is no reason to believe that these vevs should be small , i.e. one would expect a large reactor angle as well as large deviations from maximal atmospheric mixing . in order to meet the experimental bounds",
    ", one would therefore have to assume the input parameters of the flavon and yukawa superpotential to conspire so as to yield only small deviations from the tb mixing pattern .",
    "eventually this will motivate us to go beyond @xmath1 to @xmath5 where the two extra flavons @xmath23 and @xmath24 are unified into a doublet representation .",
    "in this subsection we scrutinise the modifications to the alignment mechanism of altarelli and feruglio due to the addition of flavons @xmath23 in the @xmath2 and/or @xmath24 in the @xmath3 representation of @xmath1 .",
    "our main result is that contrary to @xcite one need not introduce the auxiliary flavon singlet @xmath25 which does not acquire a vev and so plays no direct role in the flavour structure of the neutrinos . in that sense",
