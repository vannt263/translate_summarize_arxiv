    "the cubic anharmonic oscillator is an interesting example of quantum mechanical system that can not be solved by a conventional use of perturbation theory ( * ? ? ?",
    "* , section 48 ) .",
    "a heuristic application of the dilatation - transformation method allowed yaris _",
    "et al _ @xcite to identify localized solutions of the cubic anharmonic oscillator that could be interpreted as resonances .",
    "caliceti , graffi , and maioli s rigorous study @xcite of this problem with a complex coupling constant revealed the existence of a discrete spectrum , which admits analytic continuation as the imaginary part of the coupling constant goes to zero .",
    "they concluded that one can speak of resonances in a real cubic anharmonic oscillator .",
    "the behavior of these resonances for small and large values of the coupling constant was discussed by alvarez @xcite , who also showed , in a different paper @xcite , that the quantum rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation series can be rearranged as the classical birkhoff series plus quantum corrections in correspondence with the jeffreys - wentzel - kramers - brillouin ( jwkb ) series .",
    "investigations on different aspects of the cubic anharmonic oscillator , like bender - wu branch points @xcite , jwkb expansions @xcite , and precise determination of eigenvalues @xcite , have continued up to the present .",
    "additional interest in cubic potential arose from the conjecture of bessis and zinn - justin about the positivity and reality of its spectrum in the case of pure imaginary coupling constant .",
    "this observation motivated the birth of the @xmath0-symmetric quantum theory @xcite , a very fertile field of research where the cubic anharmonic oscillator has been subject of several studies @xcite .",
    "( for a recent explanation of the foundations of this theory see @xcite . )",
    "the interest stirred by the cubic oscillator has reached potentials of the form @xmath1 , with integer @xmath2 .",
    "voros s paper @xcite deserves a special mention , as it uses very elegant methods of functional analysis to establish a relation between the cases of even and odd @xmath2 . in particular",
    ", the author proves a duality between the linear ( @xmath3 ) an the quartic ( @xmath4 ) potentials which allow him to derive , as a byproduct , new properties of the well known airy function and its zeros .",
    "zinn - justin and collaborators , in a series of papers @xcite , developed a procedure , based on instanton configurations , to be rid of the divergence of the perturbation series , a disease of anharmonic oscillators , and to obtain , for the eigenvalues , a resurgent expansion in terms of the coupling constant .",
    "the procedure has been applied in the computation of the eigenvalues of the cubic oscillator @xcite .",
    "besides , it allows one to establish a bridge between even anharmonic oscillators with negative coupling and odd anharmonic oscillators with imaginary coupling ( i. e. , @xmath0-symmetric ones ) leading to a unified treatment of anharmonic oscillators of both parities @xcite .",
    "the analytic properties of the eigenvalues of the cubic oscillator , considered as a function of the intensity ( assumed to be complex ) of the cubic term , have been discussed recently .",
    "two papers deal with the ( divergent ) perturbation series for the eigenvalues summed by means of order - dependent mappings @xcite or pad approximants @xcite .",
    "a different strategy has been adopted in a paper by fernndez and garca @xcite , who use both complex rotation and riccati - pad methods to determine the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian with extraordinary accuracy .    in this paper",
    ", we are concerned with the study of the eigenstates of a cubic anharmonic oscillator with a complex coupling parameter .",
    "our approach to the problem , however , is a rigorous one : we obtain a global solution of the schrdinger equation that satisfies the appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "the general problem of finding global solutions of a second - order differential equation with one or two singular points was solved , forty years ago , by naundorf @xcite .",
    "an improvement of his method has been proposed @xcite and applied in the study of several quantum problems @xcite .",
    "the procedure consists of writing exact solutions of the schrdinger equation , in the form of convergent series expansions , and analyzing their behavior far from the origin .",
    "the requirement that this behavior be regular determines the eigenvalues . in addition , the procedure provides algebraic expressions of the eigenfunctions , which facilitate easy computation of the expected value of any quantity .",
    "different notations have been used to represent the hamiltonian of the cubic anharmonic oscillator .",
    "we adopt here the notation of @xcite , namely @xmath5 where @xmath6 is assumed to be real , while @xmath7 may be complex .",
    "notice that we have introduced an additional parameter , @xmath6 , which is redundant : an adequate scaling of the variable @xmath8 would transform the hamiltonian ( [ uno ] ) into another one with a fixed value @xmath9 , for instance , and a scaled value of @xmath7 .",
    "nevertheless , we prefer to maintain the hamiltonian in the form ( [ uno ] ) to facilitate the discussion of the interesting case of @xmath10 . concerning the parameter @xmath7 , it is sufficient to consider its values in the sector @xmath11 .",
    "eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of @xmath12 with @xmath7 in any other sector could be trivially obtained from those for @xmath7 in the first quadrant by complex conjugation and/or reflection @xmath13 .",
    "we deal with the solutions of the schrdinger equation corresponding to the hamiltonian ( [ uno ] ) in section 2 .",
    "two kinds of solutions are considered : series expansions , convergent in the finite complex @xmath8-plane , and formal asymptotic solutions , with a well defined behavior for @xmath14 .",
    "the connection between the two kinds of solutions , which is crucial point of our method for the determination of eigenvalues , is discussed in section 3 .",
    "the particular case of real @xmath7 is treated in section 4 , where the scattering problem is formulated .",
    "sections 5 and 6 deal with the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian and show numerical results for certain values of the parameters . the phase shift and the time delay in the scattering by a cubic real potential",
    "are illustrated in section 7 .",
    "some final comments are added in section 8 .",
    "finding the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian given in eq .",
    "( [ uno ] ) is a quantum mechanics exercise similar to that of determining bound states in a harmonic oscillator or in a coulomb potential .",
    "the solution of the schrdinger equation , for undetermined energy , is written as a power series expansion around the origin .",
    "the coefficients of the expansion are obtained by following the well known method of solving a second - degree homogeneous differential equation . since",
    ", in the mentioned problems , the nearest - to - the - origin singular point of the schrdinger equation is at infinity , the convergence of the series is guaranteed for finite values of the variable . at infinity , however , the series becomes divergent unless the energy takes certain discrete values .",
    "there is , nevertheless , a difference between the aforementioned algebraically solvable problems and the problem at hand . in those cases ,",
    "the recurrence relation obeyed by the coefficients of the power series solution is a difference equation ( of the hypergeometric class ) that can be solved algebraically , making possible to determine the behavior of the power series solution at infinity . in the cubic oscillator case , instead",
    ", the rank of the singularity at infinity is larger .",
    "the difference equation that gives the coefficients of the power series solution is of higher order ( it does not belong to the hypergeometric class ) , so it can not be solved algebraically and , as a result , the behavior at infinity of the power series solution can not be obtained so easily .",
    "the procedure to be followed here consists of considering , aside from and independently of the conventional ( frobenius ) power series around the origin , asymptotic ( thom ) solutions in the vicinity of @xmath15 and @xmath16 , selecting those being physically acceptable ( regular ) at the singular point .",
    "the next step is to require the coincidence , up to a constant factor , of the power series ( frobenius ) solution with the asymptotic ( thom ) solutions regular at @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "both conditions can be satisfied only for certain values of the energy , which can be determined in this way .",
    "let us use @xmath17 to denote the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian , and @xmath18 to denote the eigenfunctions .",
    "these satisfy the schrdinger equation @xmath19 with adequate boundary conditions to be given below . instead of solving the schrdinger equation on the whole real axis",
    ", we may solve it only on the positive semiaxis with a signal , @xmath20 , indicating whether we are considering the true eigenfunction or its mirror image with respect to the vertical axis , @xmath21 .",
