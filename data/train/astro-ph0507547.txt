    "the galaxy luminosity function ( lf ) is well - known as a fundamental measurement of the properties of galaxies .",
    "it constrains theories of their formation and evolution , such as biased galaxy formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and is needed for many other measurements .",
    "examples are the luminosity density in the universe ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the selection function in magnitude - limited galaxy surveys ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the distances to various types of object , the number of absorbing objects subdivided by redshift and deprojecting the angular correlation function from two dimensions to three ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the general or universal luminosity function , i.e. that for all galaxies , is defined as the comoving number density of galaxies from luminosity @xmath5 to @xmath6 @xmath7    measurements of the universal form began with @xcite , who claimed a gaussian form . various studies followed , which included data on dwarf galaxies in clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and the study of @xcite of galaxies in the field . both of these argued for a power - law faint - end slope to the overall lf , as opposed to a gaussian form .    in the mid 1970s",
    "it was suggested @xcite that the optical lf can be approximated by the function @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the normalisation , @xmath10 is the characteristic luminosity above which the function has an exponential cutoff and @xmath11 is the value of the power - law slope below @xmath10 . the schechter function , as it is now known , has been used for most subsequent characterisations of the universal lf .",
    "the function is motivated by self - similar gravitational condensation of structures @xcite , except that @xmath11 is not a fixed parameter .    until recently the study of the lf , particularly for field galaxies as opposed to those in clusters , has been hampered by the lack of large samples .",
    "few galaxies had redshifts and the photometry was from photographic plates , resulting in a large variation in the measured lf between different surveys . in the past decade data from large redshift surveys , such as the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have become available , greatly improving the situation , although the lfs are still not in perfect agreement  for example , @xcite gives revisions to the normalisations of the lf in various surveys based on the deeper wide - field imaging obtained by the millennium galaxy catalogue ( mgc ) , which they also describe , and recent comparisons of lfs such as @xcite conclude that the variations between surveys are dominated by the systematic errors , particularly at the faint end .",
    "the differences are most likely due to surface brightness selection effects .",
    "whilst the universal lf is reasonably well constrained , it is well - known that the lf varies as a function of intrinsic galaxy properties .",
    "thus the universal lf needs to be augmented by a description of this variation .",
    "as above , the lack of data until recently has hampered such studies , but with the large sample sizes ( 2dfgrs and sdss ) and five band ccd photometry ( sdss ) now available , detailed divisions of the galaxies into samples which are still statistically significant is now possible .",
    "one can also apply fairly strict sample cuts to minimize biases and still retain large samples .",
    "previous studies of non - universal lfs have included 1 ) those focusing on specific environments , particularly clusters as the galaxies are all at approximately the same distance and in a narrow field of view , 2 ) those focussing on specific types of galaxies , the large number of studies which divide the general lf according to some criterion and fit functions to each bin , and 3 ) those which study the lf bivariate with another parameter , either binned or as an analytical function .",
    "recent examples , some of which are bivariate , are @xcite for clusters , @xcite for superclusters , @xcite for voids , @xcite and @xcite for spirals , and @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for ellipticals .    various theories and simulations exist pertaining to the origin of the lf , tied in with the physics of galaxy formation .",
    "examples are @xcite who begin with the mass function of dark matter haloes in the @xmath12cdm cosmology and add gas cooling , photoionization , feedback ( e.g. from supernovae ) , galaxy merging and thermal conduction . @xcite assume that the segregation of the galaxy population by environment is due to that of halo properties and use the halo occupation distribution to give predicted lfs by environment .",
    "@xcite reconstructs the schechter form of the lf using empirical relations between the central galaxy luminosity and halo mass , and the total galaxy luminosity and halo mass .",
    "further details of the lf are in various reviews , for example @xcite and subdivided by morphological type in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "the bivariate lf is studied in bins using the nonparametric stepwise maximum likelihood method of @xcite and two - dimensional analytical functions are fitted to the results .",
    "previous studies that have done this include @xcite subdivided by radius , @xcite subdivided by galaxy diameter and @xcite , @xcite and @xcite subdivided by absolute effective surface brightness . the latter quantity is also known as the bivariate brightness distribution .",
    "@xcite showed that morphological types can be reliably assigned to galaxies in the sdss using artificial neural networks ( anns ) provided a representative training set is available . here",
    "types are assigned to the resolution e , s0 , sa , sb , sc , sd and i m for 37,047 galaxies . in ball",
    "( 2006 , in preparation , hereafter b06 ) we use these types to study the variation of galaxy morphology with environment and compare the results to those for colour .",

    "the absolute magnitude range used for each bivariate lf was @xmath38 in 18 bins of @xmath39 , with two exceptions : the jpg morphological type ( see below ) was binned in 12 bins of @xmath39 for @xmath40 , and the environmental density was in 22 bins for @xmath41 , due to its restricted redshift range ( see below ) .",
    "details of each bivariate lf are given in table [ table : bivlfs ] .",
    "the upper limit of approximately 40 evenly spaced bins in the second parameter was chosen to give a reasonable execution time .",
    "the extent of the bins is based on visual inspection of the distributions of the input parameters , but the value of the lf in each bin is independent of the others .",

    "[ sec : lf results ] .",
    "the overall completeness is estimated to be 93% .",
    "6% of galaxies are missed due to the minimum 55 arcsec separation between adjacent spectroscopic fibres on a plate , and the main galaxy sample is about 99% complete overall @xcite . however , this completeness is in terms of those objects that are targeted for spectroscopy in the first place , and in particular is subject to an explicit petrosian 50% light surface brightness cut of @xmath42 for all objects .",
    "@xcite show that the faint end is incomplete .",
    "we therefore calculate the sampling rate for each bin in the bivariate lf and correct for this in the estimation of the lf ( see  [ sec : bivlfs ] ) .",
    "because we calculate the sampling rate , the galaxies used in the process of obtaining our results do not necessarily have spectra .",
    "we therefore apply the set of recommended photometric flags described at http://www.sdss.org/dr4 to generate a clean sample .",
    "we also require the resolve_status flag to be survey_primary and the vagc_select flag to be main .    for spectra ,",
    "as mentioned , the vagc main - like sample cuts are slightly more inclusive than the sdss main sample , in particular allowing in some binary stars by the removal of the cut for small bright objects . here",
    "we reapply the main criteria as given in @xcite . for objects with spectra",
    "we also require the specprimary flag to be set , the primtarget flag to be set to either galaxy , galaxy_big , or galaxy_bright_core , the progname flag to be main , the zwarning flag to be 0 and the platequality flag to be good .",
    "the vagc does not contain a redshift confidence parameter equivalent to the zconf in the cas , but bad spectra and redshifts are excluded by zwarning .    in the optical , many spiral galaxies that are edge - on or near to this",
    "suffer internal extinction and reddening due to dust .",
    "here we attempt to minimize this effect by restricting the sample to galaxies with an axis ratio of less than that for an e7 elliptical galaxy .",
    "galaxies with larger axis ratios than this are likely to be edge - on or close to edge - on spirals . because the radial light profiles available from the sdss and vagc are either axisymmetric or specific to certain types of galaxies ( de vaucouleurs or exponential ) , we use the @xmath43 isophotal major and minor axes isoa and isob in @xmath21 and restrict the sample so that @xmath44 .",
    "this excludes 30,407 ( 2.5% ) of the galaxies .",
    "4 of @xcite shows that the vast majority of the bright galaxies removed are those with an exponential or mixed exponential and de vaucouleurs profile .",
    "very few galaxies with a pure de vaucouleurs profile are removed . at faint magnitudes",
    "similar numbers of galaxies are removed for both profile types , so many more faint ellipticals are removed than bright . here",
    "` bright ' depends on the profile type , varying from @xmath45 for de vaucouleurs to @xmath46 for exponential .",
    "a potential alternative measure is the axis ratio derived from the adaptive moments @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite show that this would be affected by seeing for most of the galaxies in our sample due to their small sizes and consequent poor resolution . as our purpose",
    "is simply to exclude very elongated objects we use the isophotal cut .",
    "a similar example is @xcite , who require @xmath47 in @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , and @xmath48 for their sample of edge - on galaxies .",
    "the vagc also contains eyeball quality checks of spectra for 17,422 objects , mostly bright ( @xmath49 ) or of low redshift ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "the sample is not complete in any particular sense , but it does exclude numerous spurious objects such as bad deblends of large galaxies , hii regions , clearly incorrect classifications and so on .",
    "we require that the quality flag be set to done with no other bit set , unless use_anyway is set .",
    "the requirement noticeably reduces the numbers of objects in some of the sparsely populated outlying bins of the lf .    besides the vagc",
    ", we use data from five other sources : 1 ) the japan participation group ( jpg ) catalogue of eyeball - classified galaxy morphologies , based on the sdss early data release ( edr , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , 2 ) the neural network morphological types of @xcite ,",
    "3 ) the public sdss dr4 cas , 4 ) the max planck / johns hopkins ( mpa / jhu ) catalogues for galaxies and agn at http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/sdss and 5 ) the pittsburgh - carnegie mellon value - added catalogue ( vac ; http://nvogre.phyast.pitt.edu/dr_value_added ) for galaxies . the cas gives the eclass spectral type , the mpa / jhu the stellar mass and the vac the environmental density .",
    "petrosian magnitudes measure a constant fraction of the total light , in a model - independent manner .",
    "they are available in the sdss in a modified form from that introduced by @xcite .",
    "the petrosian flux is given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the petrosian radius , which is the value at which the petrosian ratio of surface brightnesses @xmath53}{\\int_{0}^{r}2\\pi r'dr'i(r')/(\\pi r^2)}\\ ] ] has a certain value , chosen in the sdss to be 0.2 .",
    "the number @xmath54 of petrosian radii within which the flux is measured is equal to 2 in the sdss .",
    "further details are given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the petrosian radii are not seeing corrected , which causes the surface brightness and concentration to be underestimated for objects of size comparable to the psf .",
    "however the seeing effect is not yet quantified , and there are other approximations such as using a circular as opposed to elliptical aperture and not correcting for dust obscuration .",
    "as described in @xcite the petrosian aperture is not missing much flux compared to an ideal galaxy light profile , the amount missing being about 20% for a de vaucouleurs profile and only 1% for an exponential profile .",
    "the effect of seeing , which would make the profiles tend towards a psf , for which 5% of the light is lost , is also small for galaxies in the main sample .",
    "@xcite show that the resulting luminosity density in @xmath21 is very similar to that from the srsic profile , the difference being @xmath55 .",
    "they suggest that the similarity shows that the true luminosity density is also of a similar value .",
    "the vagc also contains srsic fits to the galaxy light profiles . the srsic profile @xcite",
    "is obtained by generalising the de vaucouleurs profile @xcite to have index @xmath56 instead of @xmath57 , giving @xmath58\\ } , \\label{eq : sersic}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is such that half the total luminosity is within @xmath60 .",
    "the fitting procedure used in the vagc is described in @xcite and in more detail in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "the axisymmetric srsic profile is fitted to the azimuthally averaged galaxy light profile available from the sdss database .",
    "the profiles are corrected for seeing , which is modelled using three axisymmetric gaussians .",
    "the de vaucouleurs and exponential profiles correspond to @xmath61 and @xmath62 respectively .",
    "@xcite show the discrepancy between the petrosian and srsic magnitudes .",
    "in particular , the difference depends on the shape of the galaxy light profile .",
    "their table 1 for the sdss petrosian aperture shows that for inverse concentration index ( @xmath63 ;  [ sec : dr4 ] ) , the difference is negligible above @xmath64 , but below this increases to , where @xmath65 is the total effective half light surface brightness , @xmath66 , 1.09 and 1.74 @xmath67 for @xmath68 , 0.28 and @xmath69 respectively for mean half - light surface brightness , and @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 in magnitude over the same range .",
    "thus only a few percent of our galaxies are affected significantly .",
    "their fig .",
    "6 shows that the vagc srsic fits are consistent with the expected differences .",
    "the @xmath63 of 0.28 corresponds to a srsic index of 6 .",
    "although the srsic index is an improvement in that it fits a more accurate radial light profile to a galaxy and is seeing - corrected , there are still some biases present . in their fig .",
    "9 , @xcite show the residuals of their srsic fits for 1,200 simulated galaxies . as a function of @xmath73 , the value of @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the fitted value of @xmath73 , decreases monotonically from less than -0.05 at @xmath62 to -0.1 , -0.25 , -0.5 and -0.65 at @xmath76 and 4.5 respectively .",
    "thus a de vaucouleurs galaxy ( @xmath77 ) is assigned an index of @xmath78 and the indices are all systematically underestimated . the error of 0.5 is comparable to the bin size in the same area of our bivariate luminosity - srsic index distribution .",
    "the range of the error as shown by the quartiles also broadens from around 0.1 to 0.5 over the same range .",
    "the fitted 50% light radius and flux decrease similarly over their range to around 0.8 and 0.9 of their true values . also , the fitted radius and flux decrease with @xmath73 , the fitted flux with radius and the fitted radius with flux .",
    "however , the fitted @xmath73 does not decrease with radius and flux .",
    "the overall performance for @xmath73 is characterized as good because the bias is similar to the uncertainty and comparable but opposite to that from the assumption of axial symmetry .",
    "the overall fits are thought to be approximately correct for srsic - shaped galaxies and supply a seeing - corrected estimate of size and concentration for the others .",
    "here we investigated the lfs for both petrosian and srsic profiles .",
    "the lfs are generally similar and because the samples used are based on the sdss main galaxy sample , which is based on petrosian magnitudes , we present the results based on those magnitudes .",
    "the derivation of a fully srsic - based sample is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "1,875 sdss galaxies to @xmath0 in the sdss edr have been classified into morphological types by @xcite , forming the jpg catalogue .",
    "the system used was a modified version of the t - type system @xcite , with the types being assigned in steps of 0.5 .",
    "the corresponding hubble types are e=0 , s0=1 , sa=2 , sb=3 , sc=4 , sd=5 and im=6 .",
    "we have previously shown @xcite that artificial neural networks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are able to assign types to galaxies in the sdss with an rms accuracy of 0.5 on this scale , using the jpg catalogue as a training set .",
    "this is the same as the spread between the human - classified types by the members of the jpg team .",
    "we used the same procedures here , updated for dr4 over dr1 and with some modifications .",
    "the dr4 cas was matched to the jpg catalogue using a tolerance of 2 arcsec and a flux limit of @xmath0 .",
    "unassigned types ( @xmath79 ) and galaxies flagged as being likely to have bad photometry were removed as before .",
    "the clean photometry flags described above were also applied here . after these cuts 1,290 galaxies remained , 1,131 with spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "the training and test sets were 645 each with no overlap , from which , as before , galaxies with severely outlying parameters and targets ( @xmath80 from the mean value for the parameter , generally indicative of a measurement error ) were iteratively removed for each parameter in turn .",
    "the network trained on the 645 was applied to the dr4 sample using the cas photometry .",
    "one could also retrain on all 1,290 for the final network to be applied to the sample , but it would make very little difference .    it was also found that when trained on the full set of 29 parameters in @xcite the types were biased towards early type with increasing redshift to a greater extent than in the jpg catalogue",
    ". however , when one trains on the purely morphological subset of the parameters ( all those except the magnitudes and colours ) , the bias is similar to the jpg , reflecting the flux - limited nature of the sample , but the rms variation between network type and target type is not significantly larger .",
    "hence the latter set is used as the training set here .",
    "the network also has a tendency to ` avoid the ends of the scale ' , resulting in few very late type galaxies and a slight bias away from early type galaxies .",
    "this is shown in fig . 1 of @xcite .",
    "this is likely due to the severe lack of galaxies in our training set of type @xmath81 or later compared to the earlier types , and the importance of the concentration index in the morphological training set , which shows a similar deviation away from the ends of the scale for both early and late types .",
    "we restrict the absolute magnitude range of the morphologies presented to @xmath82 .",
    "this is due to a lack of galaxies in the training data at fainter magnitudes than this .",
    "thus the neural network types are not extrapolated from the training set in apparent or absolute magnitude .",
    "the bivariate lf parameters described in this section are the inverse concentration index , srsic index , absolute effective surface brightness , reference - frame colours and absolute radius .",
    "the morphological parameters are measured in the @xmath21 band , since this band is used to define the aperture through which petrosian flux is measured for all five bands .",
    "the inverse concentration index @xmath63 is @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the radii within which 50 and 90 per cent of the petrosian flux is received .",
    "the inverse is used because it has the range 01 .",
    "the srsic index @xmath73 is monotonically related to the concentration ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , if the latter is measured using srsic radii .",
    "here we use petrosian circular radii and for the bivariate luminosity - srsic index distribution we use @xmath86 , as the index is in the exponent in the equation defining the srsic profile ( equation [ eq : sersic ] ) .    the absolute effective surface brightness used here",

    "a major question raised by these results and other bivariate lf studies is whether a theory or simulation can be constructed which will correctly predict the distributions over the different second lf parameters presented .",
    "two major themes in the lfs are the bimodality of the galaxy population and whether the underlying lfs per galaxy type are schechter , gaussian or some other form .    here",
    "we fitted a chooniewski function to the bivariate luminosity - surface brightness distribution , and for earlier sdss data releases experimented with it on other bivariate distributions and fitted schechter , gaussian , dual power - law schechter and a sum of two schechters to some of the individual lf slices . in all cases , the formal fits were found to be poor , with @xmath387 values of 10 or more .",
    "it is thus difficult to tell when a fit is the best that one can do and quote the numbers or if the fit really is poor and should be improved .",
    "we therefore have not quoted function fit parameters for individual lf slices in this paper , although with more work one could attempt to do so .",
    "concerning a bimodal population , the bivariate distributions are consistent with an early type , bright , concentrated , red population and a late type , faint , less concentrated , blue , star forming population .",
    "this idea of bimodality has been explored by others as it suggests two major underlying physical processes .",
    "these processes are thought to be connected to the formation of the bulge of the galaxy via mergers and the disc by accretion .",
    "thus simulations of galaxy formation could be compared to the bivariate lfs presented .",
    "this is discussed further below .",
    "several results support the idea that the underlying lfs of the giant galaxies , i.e. the usual e , s0 and spirals are gaussian , whereas those for the dwarfs are schechter .",
    "@xcite and @xcite study the cores of nearby clusters ; @xcite reviews the lfs subdivided by morphology in various surveys and @xcite focusses on the eso - sculptor survey . a physical model supporting the idea is given in @xcite in which the maximum galaxy mass is limited by baryonic cooling within a dynamical time - scale and a minimum mass is given by the minimum virial temperature required for cooling to occur .",
    "this gives the gaussian lf for giants and gas stripping then gives the schechter function for dwarfs .",
    "@xcite find that the morphological classes e / s0 , sabc and sd / irr have distinct distributions relative to the bimodal population defined in the space of core @xmath246 colour and srsic index @xmath73 .",
    "the e / s0 and sd / irr correspond to the red and blue peaks respectively , whereas the sabc spread across the two peaks .",
    "this is argued to be strong evidence that the bulges and discs are the fundamental two components to the bimodal population , not two separate galaxy types .",
    "our ann types contain few sd / irr due to the lack of these types in the training set , but our morphological",
    "lf supports this idea in the sense that the lfs for t types 1.5 through 3.5 ( sa through sc corresponds to types 24 ) are essentially indistinguishable , in contrast to the e / s0 lfs which are distinctly brighter .",
    "the bimodality in colour compared to that in morphology is also considered by b06 in the context of galaxy colour and ann t - type morphology . there",
    "we find that whilst the distributions in colour are clearly bimodal and well - fit by a sum of two gaussians , those in morphology are less so , with galaxies bridging the gap .",
    "this supports the non - fundamental nature of the sabc types in this context .",
    "also discussed by , most recently , @xcite and @xcite are blue spheroidal galaxies . these mimic faint ellipticals in morphology but are indistinguishable from blue galaxies by spectra .",
    "these galaxies could cause type contamination in the lfs , for example causing a steeper faint - end slope in the lf subdivided by @xmath246 , as shown by @xcite .",
    "again this agrees with the trends seen in our lfs and therefore requires spectroscopic and morphological information to resolve .",
    "numerous studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) find that cluster lfs are better fit by a sum of a gaussian at bright magnitudes and a schechter at faint magnitudes , rather than a single schechter function .",
    "the functions have a dip at @xmath388 , caused by the flattening of the gaussian before the power - law faint end kicks in .",
    "field galaxies are consistent with a schechter function .",
    "a hint of a similar dip is seen here , as might be expected as the sample encompasses all galaxy environments .",
    "the faint end slope is thought to be caused by numerous faint red galaxies which are present in clusters but not in the field .",
    "our lfs do not probe deep enough to say anything definitive .",
    "for the more schechter - like results such as ours , the question is whether the lfs are as they appear , or whether the underlying types are gaussian , appearing schechter because type mixing makes the functions tend towards the overall lf , which is schechter , or a superposition of gaussian at the bright end and schechter or power law at the faint end .",
    "the idea has previously been discussed in terms of the hubble morphological types and the effects can be seen here , particularly in fig . [",
    "fig : ann bivlf ] .",
    "the lf for the early types could either be schechter or gaussian with a faint - end slope contaminated by dwarfs . in their sample which is essentially a subset of the one used here ,",
    "@xcite use the concentration index to show that the sample is not contaminated with faint galaxies with soft cores , which will be dwarfs .",
    "their concentration index lf is similar to their hubble type lf .",
    "the same is seen here .",
    "the bimodality supports the idea that concentrated , early spectral type , red , high srsic index galaxies correspond to the early morphological types .",
    "if this is the case then the gaussian lf idea is also consistent with the lf plots bivariate with concentration index , eclass , reference frame colours and srsic index .",
    "these all show lfs for the early types which could be gaussian with a rise at faint magnitudes , rising to a schechter function for later types .",
    "the idea is also supported by the lf bivariate with absolute petrosian radius , which shows steeply declining faint - end slopes which become less steep for galaxies smaller than @xmath389 .",
    "whatever processes cause the bimodality do not , however , show up in the lf subdivided by absolute effective surface brightness .",
    "however , it may well be the case that the sum of two bivariate distributions is still required and that , unlike the chooniewski function , the relation between the mean of the distribution on the surface brightness axis must be a non - linear function of absolute magnitude to fit the lack of variation in the peak surface brightness at bright magnitudes followed by dimming at fainter levels . at fainter levels",
    "the two distributions could diverge and thus reproduce the broadening seen .",
    "it may even be the case though that to get a formally good fit in the @xmath372 sense requires the distribution to be able to change width in the surface brightness axis as a function of absolute magnitude . if the schechter function is also required to be a dual power law or schechter plus gaussian the number of parameters to fit rises to around 20 .",
    "this may be impractical , at which point one would want to consider summing perhaps a greater number of simpler physically motivated functions , becoming more akin to semi - analytic models .",
    "these functions might be based on the kormendy relation for bulges @xcite , freeman s law for discs @xcite , or the more recent relation of @xcite , and a relation for dwarf spheroids such as that in @xcite .",
    "another possibility is that central surface brightness may better distinguish between spirals and ellipticals than the absolute effective surface brightness used here .",
    "a useful way to connect observations to simulations is the conditional luminosity function , i.e. the luminosity distribution of galaxies in a dark matter halo . @xcite",
    "construct the schechter form of the galaxy lf using a model in which the central massive galaxies in haloes are distributed with a lognormal scatter and the satellite galaxies , where the total galaxy luminosity is greater than the central galaxy , are a power law .",
    "this predicts that the faint end of the lf is determined by the galaxies in low mass haloes and should have a slope independent of colour selection or band .",
    "if this was combined with a prescription for predicting surface brightness then one might be able to predict the bivariate lfs presented here .",
    "this could be done by relating the absolute half - light radius to the dimensionless spin parameter of the dark matter halo @xcite , as done by several studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if the same dark matter haloes are used for both models then one could predict the bivariate brightness distribution , at least for discs .",
    "relations of the haloes to other galaxy properties could similarly predict the other bivariate lfs , perhaps along the lines of e.g. @xcite .",
    "however , our results show an lf faint end that does depend on the colour , so further comparison of observations and theory is clearly important .",
    "the conclusion from various studies is that the two physical processes are likely to be merger to form spheroids and accretion on to discs to give the star formation . in the sense that we see the bimodal early - red versus late - blue population , our results support this conclusion . to test the ideas",
    "further requires bulge to disc decomposition and quantitative comparison with simulations incorporating the ideas discussed above , as well as the future work detailed below .",
    "however , there is likely to be more to the story than simply mergers and accretion .",
    "for example , pseudobulges ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) resemble bulges in disc galaxies but are formed due to internal ( secular ) evolutionary processes .",
    "thus the relative importance of secular evolution on the observables discussed here is a further avenue of investigation . also , for example , none of the morphologies here take into account the presence of bars , which are important in a secular evolution sense , if not in larger scale environment ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "there is then the question of more complex light profiles such as the core - srsic model of @xcite , types that do nt fit the classifications used here such as cd galaxies , higher redshifts , and so on .",
    "important followup work to the work presented in this paper is to more rigourously separate the dwarf and giant galaxies in the lf , to apply reliable bulge to disc decomposition and to fit functional forms to the two underlying distributions .",
    "more refined structural parameters than those used to generate the main galaxy sample such as fully srsic - based measurements using elliptical isophotes should be used . here",
    "dust - obscuration is addressed by simply requiring that the axis ratio is less than that for an e7 elliptical galaxy , therefore excluding edge - on spiral discs that are highly reddened by internal extinction .",
    "multiwavelength data could improve this , for example matches to swire @xcite data would be less affected .",
    "one could also match to galex @xcite data to extend to the uv for the star formation .",
    "the conclusions of this paper are as follows .",
    "+ the luminosity function is measured bivariate with various galaxy properties from the sdss and its associated value - added catalogues",
    ". the properties are eyeball morphological type , neural network morphological type , inverse concentration index @xmath63 , the srsic index of the light profile , absolute effective surface brightness , the reference frame colours @xmath246 , @xmath301 , @xmath302 and @xmath303 , the absolute petrosian 90% radius of the galaxy , eclass pca spectral type , the stellar mass and the @xmath390 surface density of galaxies .",
    "some of the parameters plotted here are new in the context of a bivariate lf , and for those that have previously been studied , the trends seen are confirmed at high signal - to - noise .",
    "this is the largest number of parameters studied in one framework for a bivariate lf .",
    "the sdss is one of the best datasets currently available for this work , and the large sample combined with ccd photometry is ideal for precision bivariate lfs , enabling division of the galaxy population into numerous smaller samples , each of which is still highly statistically significant .",
    "in addition , the stepwise maximum likelihood estimator used is well - known and has been shown to be a good estimator .",
    "the magnitudes are k - corrected for each individual galaxy using the well - tested k - correct code written for the sdss by @xcite .",
    "the k - corrections do not take into account galaxy evolution or the effects of reddening due to dust , however we restrict the sample to galaxies at @xmath4 and those with an isophotal axis ratio less than 10/3 to minimize these effects .",
    "near - infrared datasets of comparable size to the sdss should improve the situation .",
    "the variation of the lf with all of the parameters is highly significant , both in shape and normalisation , except for @xmath390 where the lf does not change significantly in shape and the normalisation is arbitrary .",
    "the bivariate lfs are consistent with an early type , bright , concentrated , red population and a late type , faint , less concentrated , blue , star forming population .",
    "this idea of bimodality has been explored by others as it suggests two major underlying physical processes , which in agreement with other studies we conclude are likely to be mergers leading to bulges and accretion on to discs .",
    "the bimodality is considered further in b06 in the context of galaxy colour and morphology as a function of environment .",
    "the various morphological measures are consistent , with the srsic index showing the same broad trends as the @xmath63 , eyeball and neural network morphological type .",
    "the overall patterns of the lfs in the four colours @xmath246 , @xmath301 , @xmath302 and @xmath303 are similar , as are those for the other six from the sdss @xmath300 bands .",
    "the main change is the increased star formation in the bluer bands and the corresponding lack of bimodality in the redder bands .",
    "the lf bivariate with absolute galactic radius shows a steeply declining faint - end slope which becomes flat then rising for the smallest galaxies , supporting the idea that it is the small galaxies which cause the lf to be shaped like a schechter function .",
    "the lf bivariate with galaxy stellar mass shows a tight correlation of higher mass for brighter magnitude , with gaussian lfs , as expected as the luminosity is used in the calculation of the stellar mass .",
    "the lf bivariate with @xmath390 surface density of galaxies shows little variation in shape over a large range in density from that in a cluster core to the field , being of power - law form throughout .",
    "further work would be needed to quantify the variation that is seen .",
    "no definitive conclusion is reached as to whether the underlying lfs for individual types are gaussian or schechter , due to the possibility of type mixing .",
    "this is particularly prominent in the lfs bivariate with eyeball morphological type assigned by the neural network , as those for the normal galaxies e , s0 , and spirals might be expected to be gaussian but if type mixing is present this causes them to tend towards the overall lf , which is well fit by a schechter function . the idea is supported by the lfs bivariate with absolute galactic radius and to a lesser extent by srsic index , concentration index , spectral type and colours ( the bimodality suggests that these correspond to similar galaxy populations ) .",
    "however , the plots are also consistent with schechter functions with more or less steeply declining faint - end slopes .",
    "further work would be required to investigate the effect of blue spheroidals , which mimic faint red galaxies in morphology but have bluer colours .",
    "it may be that the morphology of whole galaxies , particularly sa  sc spirals , is an intrinsically ` fuzzy ' measure , so that the gaussian lfs will not be seen",
    ". however , the contamination may be from dwarf galaxies so an important step is to separate these from the normal galaxies and determine their lf separately .",
    "the lf by absolute galactic radius is a step towards this but the next step should be using the azimuthally averaged light profiles available for all galaxies in the sdss .",
    "similarly , further work would be required to see to what extent the faint - end upturns seen in some of the lf slices are real .",
    "some of the lfs are fitted with analytical functions , which are generally poor fits , probably due to this detail being beyond that reproducible by a simple function .",
    "an example is the fit of the chooniewski function to the bivariate brightness distribution in which the fit may need to also allow for a variation in the width of the gaussian with surface brightness , and a possibly non - linear relation between mean absolute magnitude and mean surface brightness , which results in the addition of two parameters to the six already present .",
    "the poor fit is also seen in @xcite , where it is interpreted in terms of the diverging trends of bulges and discs with decreasing surface brightness .",
    "the fitting method used is easily extended to any of the other bivariate lfs presented here .",

    "for each result in which the second lf parameter does not require spectroscopy , i.e. @xmath168 , @xmath169 , @xmath63 , and @xmath73 , the completeness maps for the bins used in the lf swml estimate are shown .",
    "the parameters are therefore selected with the explicit cuts implied by the extent of their axes on these maps .",
    "for @xmath264 we show the completeness as a function of apparent sb .",
    "maps for the other parameters are shown as a function of apparent magnitude . with the exception of @xmath168 , which is selected from a smaller area with much higher spectroscopic coverage ,",
    "the overall completeness will generally not exceed the ratio of the spectroscopic areal coverage to that of the imaging over the whole survey .",
    "this is about 70% , from 4,783 or 4,681 @xmath391 versus 6,851 or 6,670 @xmath391 for the vagc and the cas respectively . in general",
    ", the completeness will be lower , due to further objects being masked out for the various reasons described above .",
    "the maps give an indication of the possible extent of biases in the lfs due to incompleteness in spectroscopy .",
    "whilst these maps show the completeness in spectroscopy compared to selected targets , they do not show incompletenesses in the imaging compared to the true galaxy distribution .",
    "these will arise if either the object is not detected , or it is masked out from the photometry that is compared to the spectroscopy in the maps .",
    "the photometric incompleteness due to surface brightness selection effects is investigated by @xcite for the ranges in apparent surface brightness and magnitude @xmath392 and @xmath393 .",
    "they process simulated galaxies with the same software used to process the real dr2 imaging data .",
    "the effects of seeing , noise and sky subtraction are included . at low surface brightness , they find that the overall completeness drops below 90% around @xmath260 , reaching 50% at @xmath394 and 0 at @xmath253 = 24.3 .",
    "this drop is fairly uniform over the whole range in @xmath21 . at the bright end",
    ", there is slight incompleteness ( 90% ) for dim high surface brightness objects ( @xmath261 and @xmath262 ) , ascribed to the star / galaxy separator misclassifying the objects as stars in marginal seeing .",
    "there is more substantial incompleteness for bright high surface brightness objects , the overall completeness dropping to 80% for @xmath395 and 64% for @xmath396 .",
    "this is ascribed to the explicit surface brightness cut in the main galaxy sample to eliminate binary stars (  [ sec : properties ] ) .",
    "the overall fraction of galaxies affected by incompleteness at the faint end is small because the numbers observed drop well before the completeness drops .    at the bright end",
    ", objects will be missed either through being shredded into smaller objects by the deblender or , as mentioned , by being misclassified as an object other than a galaxy . besides the marginal seeing example mentioned , in recent years evidence has also emerged for a class of galaxies , ultra - compact dwarfs ( ucds , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which are affected by this .",
    "again any effect on the overall lf for the apparent magnitude range investigated in this paper is unlikely to be significant because , as shown by @xcite , few objects are observed in this regime .",
    "the vagc quality flag rejects objects which are bad deblends in the ranges @xmath50 and @xmath397 .",
    "most bad deblends are likely to be fragments of large galaxies and would therefore be within this range , being both nearby due to the apparent size of the galaxy in which they are contained and intrinsically faint due to their small mass and therefore light compared to a galaxy .",
    "objects without a spectrum will not be in the range but will also not be shown in the lf .",
    "@xcite show that in the range @xmath398 , 35% of the objects are bad deblends after applying their local versus global sky value cut .",
    "therefore objects that are in this 35% but not in the range rejected by the quality flag may remain in the lfs presented here . accurately quantifying the number of objects for which this is the case would require detailed inspection of images in large numbers of lf bins , which is beyond the scope of this paper . here",
    "we inspect the images for some of the outlying bins and plot the lf slices ( but not the greyscale ) only for bins containing more than 20 galaxies , for which any contamination is small .",
    "bad deblends are therefore unlikely to cause any significant biases in the overall lfs .",
    "an exception is again made for @xmath168 , where the cut is 5 galaxies per bin , because these were manually inspected for outliers by the jpg and so the shot noise becomes the limiting factor .",
    "objects missed altogether by the survey will mean that we are not measuring the true lf .",
    "however , studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have shown that low - surface brightness galaxies do not contribute significantly to the luminosity density of the universe , particularly in the range of brightness we study here .",
    "similarly , ucds have absolute magnitudes of @xmath399 @xcite and so would not enter into our lfs ."
