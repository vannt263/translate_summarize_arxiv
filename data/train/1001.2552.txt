    "we prove several new results concerning the spectral properties of the discrete schrdinger operator with fibonacci potential , the so - called fibonacci hamiltonian , using methods from the modern theory of dynamical systems ( uniformly hyperbolic and normally hyperbolic dynamics ) .",
    "the fibonacci hamiltonian is a central model in the study of electronic properties of one - dimensional quasicrystals .",
    "it is given by the following bounded self - adjoint operator in @xmath0 , @xmath1 ( n ) = \\psi(n+1 ) + \\psi(n-1 ) + v \\chi_{[1-\\alpha , 1)}(n\\alpha + \\omega \\!\\!\\ !",

    "this operator family has been studied in many papers since the early 1980 s and numerous fundamental results are known .",
    "let us recall some of them and refer the reader to the survey articles @xcite for additional information .",
    "the spectrum is easily seen to be independent of @xmath5 and may therefore be denoted by @xmath6 .",
    "that is , @xmath7 for every @xmath8 .",
    "indeed , this follows quickly from the minimality of the irrational rotation by @xmath9 and strong operator convergence .",
    "it was shown by st that @xmath6 has zero lebesgue measure for every @xmath2 ; see @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is compact ( since it is the spectrum of a bounded operator ) and perfect ( because the irrational rotation by @xmath9 is ergodic ) .",
    "thus , @xmath6 is a zero - measure cantor set .",
    "this result was recently strengthened by cantat @xcite who showed that the hausdorff dimension of @xmath6 lies strictly between zero and one .",
    "naturally , one is interested in fractal properties of @xmath6 , such as its dimension , thickness , and denseness .",
    "while such a study is well - motivated from a purely mathematical perspective , we want to point out that there is significant additional interest in these quantities .",
    "in particular , it has recently been realized that the fractal dimension of the spectrum is intimately related with the long - time asymptotics of the solution to the associated time - dependent schrdinger equation , that is , @xmath10 ; see @xcite .",
    "fractal properties of @xmath6 are by now well understood for large values of @xmath11",
    ". work of casdagli @xcite and st @xcite shows that for @xmath12 , @xmath6 is a dynamically defined cantor set .",
    "it follows from this result that the hausdorff dimension and the upper and lower box counting dimension of @xmath6 all coincide ; let us denote this common value by @xmath13 . using this result , damanik , embree , gorodetski , and tcheremchantsev have shown upper and lower bounds for the dimension ; see @xcite .",
    "a particular consequence of these bounds is the identification of the asymptotic behavior of the dimension as @xmath11 tends to infinity : @xmath14 the paper @xcite also discusses some of the implications for the dynamics of the schrdinger equation ; let us mention @xcite for further recent advances in this direction for the strongly coupled fibonacci hamiltonian .",
    "by contrast , hardly anything about @xmath6 ( beyond it having hausdorff dimension strictly between zero and one ) is known for small values of @xmath11 .",
    "the largeness of @xmath11 enters the proofs of the existing results in critical ways .",
    "consequently , these proofs indeed break down once the largeness assumption is dropped .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to fill out this gap by completely different methods .",
    "we would like to emphasize that quantitative properties of regular cantor sets such as thickness and denseness are widely used in dynamical systems ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and they have found an application in number theory ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , but to the best of our knowledge , these kinds of techniques have never been used before in the context of mathematical physics .      in this subsection we describe our results for small coupling @xmath11 .",
    "clearly , as @xmath11 approaches zero , @xmath15 approaches the free schrdinger operator @xmath16 ( n ) = \\psi(n+1 ) + \\psi(n-1),\\ ] ] which is a well - studied object whose spectral properties are completely understood . in particular , the spectrum of @xmath17 is given by the interval @xmath18 $ ] .",
    "it is natural to ask which spectral features of @xmath15 approach those of @xmath17 .",
    "it follows from st s 1989 result @xcite that the lebesgue measure of the spectrum does not extend continuously to the case @xmath19 .",
    "given this situation , one would at least hope that the dimension of the spectrum is continuous at @xmath20 .",
    "it was shown by us in @xcite ( and independently by cantat @xcite ) that @xmath6 is a dynamically defined cantor set for @xmath21 sufficiently small ( i.e. , the small coupling counterpart to casdagli s result at large coupling ) .",
    "a consequence of this is the equality of hausdorff dimension and upper and lower box counting dimensions of @xmath6 in this coupling constant regime .",
    "our first result shows that the dimension of the spectrum indeed extends continuously to @xmath19 .",
    "[ t.1 ] we have @xmath22 more precisely , there are constants @xmath23 such that @xmath24 for @xmath2 sufficiently small .",

    "since these notions and connections may be less familiar to at least a part of our intended audience , let us recall the definitions and some of the main results ; an excellent general reference in this context is @xcite .    let @xmath25 be a cantor set and denote by @xmath26 its convex hull .",

    "the fibonacci hamiltonian belongs to this class ; more precisely , it is in many ways the most important example within this class of models .",
    "one of the most spectacular discoveries is that , in this class of models , the spectrum jumps from being an interval for coupling @xmath20 to being a zero - measure cantor set for coupling @xmath2 .",
    "that is , as the potential is turned on , a dense set of gaps opens immediately ( and the complement of these gaps has zero lebesgue measure ) .",

    "our next result resolves this issue completely and shows that , in the fibonacci case , all gaps open linearly :    [ t.3 ] for @xmath2 sufficiently small , the boundary points of a gap in the spectrum @xmath6 depend smoothly on the coupling constant @xmath11 .",

    "their study suggested that at small coupling , the spectrum of @xmath53 is a cantor set ; quite on the contrary , it has no gaps at all .",
    "our next theorem confirms this observation :    [ t.4 ] for @xmath2 sufficiently small , we have that @xmath54 is an interval .",
    "certainly , the same statement holds for the cubic fibonacci hamiltonian ( i.e. , the analogously defined schrdinger operator in @xmath55 with spectrum @xmath56 ) .",

    "one of the most important applications of the integrated density of states is the so - called gap labeling .",
    "that is , one can identify a canonical set of gap labels , that is only associated with the underlying dynamics ( in this case , an irrational rotation of the circle or the shift - transformation on a substitution - generated subshift over two symbols ) , in such a way that the value of @xmath67 for @xmath68 must belong to this canonical set . in the fibonacci case ,",
    "this set is well - known ( see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq .  ( 6.7 ) ) ) and the general gap labeling theorem specializes to the following statement : @xmath69 for every @xmath70 .",
    "here @xmath71 denotes the fractional part of @xmath72 , that is , @xmath73 .",
    "notice that the set of gap labels is indeed @xmath11-independent and only depends on the value of @xmath9 from the underlying circle rotation .",
    "since @xmath9 is irrational , the set of gap labels is dense . in general , a dense set of gap labels is indicative of a cantor spectrum and hence a common ( and attractive ) stronger version of proving cantor spectrum is to show that the operator `` has all its gaps open . '' for example , the ten martini problem for the almost mathieu operator is to show cantor spectrum , while the dry ten martini problem is to show that all labels correspond to gaps in the spectrum .",
    "the former problem has been completely solved @xcite , while the latter has not yet been completely settled .",
    "indeed , it is in general a hard problem to show that all labels given by the gap labeling theorem correspond to gaps and there are only few results of this kind .",
    "here we show the stronger ( or `` dry '' ) form of cantor spectrum for the weakly coupled fibonacci hamiltonian and establish complete gap labeling :    [ t.completegaplabeling ] there is @xmath74 such that for every @xmath75 $ ] , all gaps allowed by the gap labeling theorem are open .",

    "we conjecture that holds for every @xmath2 .",
    "let us return to the existence of the limit in theorem  [ t.3 ] . as was pointed out there , the value of the limit will depend on the family of gaps chosen .",

    "the standard transport exponents capture the spreading of the quantum state in space .",

    "either one uses the boundedness of @xmath1076 for energies @xmath1086 to prove explicit polynomial upper bounds for @xmath1134 ( as in @xcite for @xmath1135 or in @xcite for general @xmath1023 ) , or one combines the proof of the absence of decaying solutions at @xmath1121 for @xmath1086 given in the next subsection with osceledec s theorem , which states that @xmath1136 would imply the existence of an exponentially decaying solution at @xmath1121 .",
    "here we use one more time that @xmath1102 is comparable in norm to @xmath1137 .",
    "the existence of the uniform spectrum @xmath1045 was shown in lemma  [ l.l3 ] and the fact that @xmath1045 has zero lebesgue measure follows from lemmas  [ l.l4 ] and [ l.l5 ] .",
    "the set of bounded orbits of the restriction of the trace map @xmath1138 to the invariant surface @xmath1139 is hyperbolic ; see @xcite ( and also @xcite for @xmath28 sufficiently small and @xcite for @xmath28 sufficiently large ) .",
    "due to lemma  [ l.l2 ] , the points of the spectrum correspond to the points of the intersection of the line of the initial conditions @xmath1140 with the stable manifolds of the hyperbolic set of bounded orbits .",
    "properties  ( ii ) and ( iii ) can be proved in exactly the same way as theorem  6.5 in @xcite . the line @xmath1141 intersects the stable lamination of the hyperbolic set transversally for sufficiently small @xmath809 , as can be shown in the same way as for the diagonal fibonacci hamiltonian with a small coupling constant ; see @xcite .",
    "therefore the spectrum @xmath1045 for close enough @xmath1017 and @xmath1027 is a dynamically defined cantor set , and the properties ( iv)(vi ) follow ; see @xcite and references therein .",
    "the statement ( vii ) follows as in the diagonal case since the thickness of @xmath1045 tends to infinity as @xmath1142 approaches @xmath176 .",
    "notice that a proof of the transversality of the line @xmath1141 to the stable lamination of the hyperbolic set of bounded orbits for arbitrary @xmath1143 would imply the properties ( iv)(vi ) for these values of @xmath1017 and @xmath1027 .",
    "since the absence of absolutely continuous spectrum follows from zero measure spectrum , we only need to show the absence of point spectrum .",
    "it was shown by damanik and lenz @xcite that , given any @xmath1023 and @xmath89 , the restriction of @xmath5 to @xmath1144 begins with a square @xmath1145 such that @xmath1146 is a cyclic permutation of @xmath1019 . by cyclic invariance of the trace",
    ", it follows that @xmath1147 for every @xmath65 .",
    "if @xmath1086 and @xmath36 is a solution of the difference equation , it therefore follows that @xmath1151 if @xmath36 does not vanish identically , this shows that @xmath1152 as @xmath1153 since the @xmath1076 s are bounded above and the @xmath1101 s are bounded below away from zero .",
    "in particular , if @xmath1086 , then no non - trivial solution of is square - summable at @xmath1121 and hence @xmath65 is not an eigenvalue .",
