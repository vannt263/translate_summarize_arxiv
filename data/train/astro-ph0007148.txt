    "infrared spectroscopy is a particularly useful tool for studying supernova remnants ( and other shocks ) in dense gas for the following reasons . (",
    "1 ) infrared atomic fine - structure lines are produced by gas with the physical conditions expected behind radiative shocks .",
    "dense , shocked gas rapidly cools to temperatures of @xmath11@xmath12  k , where infrared transitions are excited .",
    "this cool layer dominates the shocked column density , while the layer that emits optical to x - ray lines is extremely narrow .",
    "the kinetic temperature of the cooling post - shock gas is perfectly suited to the energy levels of infrared fine - structure lines from atoms and ions and infrared vibrational , ro - vibrational , and quadrupole vibrational ( h@xmath5 ) lines from molecules .",
    "( 2 ) infrared fine - structure lines trace the ground - state populations of the all of the abundant elements that have electronic ground - states with non - zero angular momentum . by measuring the brightness of transitions directly to the ground - state or within a narrow multiplet of energy levels including the ground - state , a reasonably accurate measure of the column density of each species can be determined .",
    "using pairs of lines from different elements due to energy levels with similar spacings , it is possible to measure relative abundances with confidence .",
    "( 3 ) far - infrared fine - structure lines are not affected by extinction .",
    "the light produced by post - shock gas is significantly affected by extinction from dust in the pre - shock cloud and the intervening medium along the line of sight .",
    "extinction effects are severe in the ultraviolet and also in the optical and near - infrared for inner - galaxy supernova remnants , where the line - of - sight column density often exceeds @xmath13 @xmath14 , but it is negligible in the far - infrared .",
    "many supernova remnants interacting with clouds are known only from their radio or hard x - ray emission , despite being copious producers of soft x - rays and optical line emission , because they are too distant or they are within or behind a molecular cloud .",
    "recent advances in infrared astronomy have opened the far - infrared window to spectroscopy of faint emission .",
    "the observations used in this paper were made with the long - wavelength spectrometer ( lws ; @xcite ) aboard the _ infrared space observatory _ (;",
    "@xcite ) , whose mission lasted from 19961997 .",
    "a complete spectrum with the lws , covering the 40190 @xmath0 m wavelength region with a resolution of @xmath15@xmath16 @xmath0 m , took less than half an hour to reach a sensitivity adequate to detect atomic fine - structure lines and molecular rotational lines for a variety of astronomical sources .",
    "instruments planned for the stratospheric observatory for infrared astronomy ( sofia ; @xcite ; expected to begin observing in 2002 ) will open opportunities for far - infrared spectroscopic observations over most of the far - infrared wavelength range  specifically , the part not affected by absorption and emission by very abundant molecules in the residual atmosphere such as h@xmath5o . in the somewhat - more - distant future , instruments aboard the far - infrared space telescope ( first ; @xcite ; anticipated launch 2007 ) will allow continuous spectral coverage to even deeper levels for extended sources .",
    "the goal of this paper is to present our _ iso _ lws and sws spectral observations of the molecular supernova remnants w  44 , w  28 , and 3c  391 , and to illustrate from basic physical principles why the spectral lines we detected are bright .",
    "shocked gas in supernova remnants emits virtually all fine - structure lines from the abundant elements .",
    "we show the inferred elemental abundances after impact from the supernova shock , and we discuss implication of grain destruction for elements such as fe , si , and p which were locked in grains .",
    "this paper continues our investigation of infrared emission from molecular supernova remnants .",
    "the brightness of the [ ] 63.2 @xmath0 m line for w  44 and 3c  391 was presented in our first paper ( @xcite ) .",
    "the far - infrared molecular emission of oh , co , and h@xmath5o was presented in the second paper ( @xcite ) .",
    "the millimeter - wave molecular emission of co , cs , hco@xmath1 was presented in the third paper for 3c  391 ( @xcite ) , and in this paper we also present some molecular results for w  44 from new iram 30-m observations .",
    "two recent and closely - related studies of molecular emission were presented by seta et al .",
    "( 1998 ) for w  44 and arikawa et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for w  28 .",
    "the millimeter - wave observations show beyond doubt that all three of the supernova remnants discussed in this paper are interacting with molecular clouds .",
    ".observed far - infrared atomic fine - structure lines [ cols= \" < , < , > , > , > , > \" , ]",
    "the moderate - resolution far - infrared spectra are dominated by a bright continuum underlying the spectral lines . because the remnants we discuss here are in the galactic plane , much of this continuum emission is likely to be unrelated to the remnant , produced instead by clouds along the line of sight both in front of and behind the remnant , as well as the molecular cloud close to the remnant .",
    "we have attempted to extract the remnant contribution to the continuum emission by searching for distinct spatial and spectral variations . in this paper",
    "we present a spectral separation of the remnant emission from the unrelated emission ; in paper 1 and in future work , we use the reference positions and spatial correlations with the line brightness .",
    "the continuum spectrum of 3c  391:bml is shown in figure  [ contspec ] . even by inspection ,",
    "it is evident that the spectrum can not be fitted with a modified blackbody : there is a significant positive excess at wavelengths shorter than 120 @xmath0 m .",
    "it is not surprising for the continuum spectrum to require multiple components . in the _ cobe _ firas observations of the galactic plane in a @xmath17 beam , the spectrum of the inner galaxy at wavelengths of 100200 @xmath0 m has contributions from two components : 20 k dust associated with atomic gas , and 13 k dust associated with molecular gas ( @xcite , @xcite ) . at wavelengths shorter than 100 @xmath0 m",
    ", continuing all the way to the pah features in the mid - infrared , emission from small , transiently - heated dust grains becomes important ( @xcite ) . for our supernova remnant observations in an @xmath18 beam",
    ", we expect all components to be brighter than in the _",
    "cobe_/firas data , because ( 1 ) the atomic gas column density peaks sharply in the galactic plane , ( 2 ) the lines of sight pass directly through giant molecular clouds , and ( 3 ) the emission from the remnants themselves are completely beam - diluted in the _ cobe _ firas beam .    to estimate the remnant contribution to the spectrum , we used a nominal spectrum for dust in the local interstellar medium , which big grains , at a temperature of 17.5 k , and small grains with a brightness that matches the _ cobe _ diffuse infrared background experiment ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we use two components , for the atomic and molecular gas , with radiation fields equal to @xmath19 times the local interstellar radiation field . for each component ,",
    "the temperature of big grains scales as @xmath20 , and the brightness of the small grain emission scales as @xmath19 .",
    "the atomic regions were assumed to have @xmath21 ( to account for the enhanced radiation field in the inner galaxy ) , and the molecular regions were assumed to have @xmath22 ( to account for extinction of the ultraviolet radiation field inside molecular clouds ) .",
    "the scale of the model and the ratio of the two components was set to match the far - infrared spectrum at wavelengths longward of 120 @xmath0 m .    the continuum spectral models are shown for each remnant in fig .  [ contspec ] .",
    "the models with a single diffuse ism component can not explain the brightness of the continuum at wavelengths shortward of 110 @xmath0 m ; there is a clear excess at 40110 @xmath0 m .",
    "the amount of excess emission depends rather sensitively on the assumed spectrum of the unrelated interstellar material , so the present results must be used with caution .",
    "there is a good correlation of the 74 @xmath0 m continuum with the line brightness ( paper 1 ) , supporting our claim that a significant portion of the 40110 @xmath0 m emission is from the remnants .",
    "there is also a tentative detection of 3c  391 at 60 @xmath0 m using _ iras _ data ( @xcite ) .",
    "this excess emission has a color temperature of @xmath23 k , corresponding to an enhancement of the radiation field by more than 2 orders of magnitude .",
    "such a high radiation does not occur in the diffuse interstellar medium over many - pc scales such as observed here .",
    "instead , we must be seeing dust that is either physically different from that in the diffuse interstellar medium , or dust that is excited locally , for example behind the shock fronts .",
    "the optical depth of the remnant emission at 100 @xmath0 m is @xmath24 , and the total surface brightness of the far - infrared continuum , assuming a @xmath25 spectrum , is @xmath26 erg  s@xmath27  @xmath14  sr@xmath27 .",
    "thus the infrared continuum is significantly brighter than any of the individual spectral lines .",
    "the luminosity of the excess emission , within the single lws beam that we observed for each remnant , ranges from @xmath28 for 3c  391:bml to @xmath29 for w  44 and w  28 ; however , these numbers are rather uncertain . using the optical depth required to produce the excess emission ,",
    "the opacity per unit mass for ` normal ' interstellar dust ( @xcite ) , the mass of shock - excited dust within the single lws beam that we observed for 3c  391:bml , is @xmath10 .      in order for the fe and si emission lines to be as bright as observed ,",
    "at least part of the refractory dust mass must have been vaporized . in the cool diffuse cloud toward @xmath30 oph , 95% of si and @xmath31% of fe",
    "are locked in dust grains ( @xcite ) .",
    "using our single - slab model , we found that 50% of the si and 30% of the fe are required to be in the post - shock _ gas _ , which would mean that about half of the dust mass is destroyed by the shock .",
    "the single - slab model will , however , give less accurate measures of the abundances for fe and si relative to o ( for which the model parameters were determined ) , because the fe and si lines we observed are from higher energy levels than those of o. there is likely to be a stratified post - shock emitting region , with somewhat warmer regions producing some of the si and fe lines .",
    "thus , the exact fraction of refractory dust mass that was vaporized is highly uncertain .",
    "we have experimented with a multiple - slab model , using the approximate density and temperature profiles behind a 100 km  s@xmath27 j - shock into @xmath32 @xmath7 gas ( @xcite ) , to see how much of the observed 35.2 and 26 @xmath0 m line brightnesses could be produced by warmer layers closer to the shock .",
    "the multiple slab model predicts relatively brighter 26 @xmath0 m lines for a given column density , by up to a factor of two in extreme cases .",
    "thus it is possible that the gas - phase abundance of fe was overestimated by up to a factor of 2 using the single - slab model , meaning that as little as @xmath33% of the fe is required to produce the observed lines .",
    "an identical result is obtained for si .",
    "even with the lower gas - phase abundance of si and fe , we can conclude that a non - trivial fraction of the fe - bearing dust mass was vaporized .",
    "it is essentially impossible to produce all of the observed brightness of the 26 @xmath0 m line from normally - depleted pre - shock interstellar matter .    using the observed traces of the vaporized and surviving dust grains",
    ", we can work backwards to estimate the fraction of dust that was destroyed .",
    "the total mass of si and fe vapor in 3c  391:bml is about 0.11 @xmath34 , within the lws beam .",
    "based on the dust - phase elemental abundances in a cold interstellar cloud , the total mass of elements ( mainly o , fe , c , si , and mg ) in dust is 3.65.0 times the mass of si and fe in dust , with the lower number coming from b - star reference abundances and the higher number coming from solar reference abundances ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we infer that about 0.5 @xmath34 of dust was vaporized by shocks into 3c  391:bml . for comparison , our far - infrared conntinuum observations indicated at least 1 @xmath34 of dust remaining in solid form after the shock",
    ". therefore , we estimate that approximately 1/3 of the dust mass was vaporized by the shocks .",
    "how does our inferred fraction of dust vaporization compare to theoretical predictions ?",
    "jones , tielens , & hollenbach ( 1996 ) have calculated the destruction probabilities for dust grains in shock fronts with a range of shock velocities and pre - shock densities .",
    "their models included sputtering and shattering : sputtering removes material from the grain via collisions with the hot gas , while shattering destroys large grains and creates small grains from them .",
    "the models for @xmath35 km  s@xmath27 are most relevant for the shocks we discuss in this paper .",
    "clearly there are faster shocks that create the x - ray - emitting plasma , and slower shocks that create the molecular line emission .",
    "but the ionic lines from which we determined the abundances arise from a layer with a post - shock density of order @xmath12 @xmath7 (  [ section : abundance ] ) into which shocks with a velocity of about 100 km  s@xmath27 have been driven (  [ fabry ] ) .",
    "the model of jones et al .",
    "( 1996 ) with parameters most similar to our present case has pre - shock density @xmath36 @xmath7 . while their models do not extend to higher @xmath37 , the dependence on @xmath37 is surprisingly mild , with a slight trend toward _ more _ dust destruction for denser shocks .",
    "the models of jones et al .",
    "( 1996 ) predict that about 37% of silicate dust and 12% of graphite dust are destroyed , mostly via non - thermal sputtering .",
    "these predictions are in excellent agreement with our results .",
    "there are at least two significant theoretical models that predict the structure ( density and temperature ) and emission behind radiative shocks comparable to those that seem to be occurring in the molecular supernova remnants we observed .",
    "one model , by hollenbach & mckee ( 1989 ; hereafter hm89 ) , includes an extensive network of chemical reactions and detailed treatment of the dynamics of the post - shock gas ( from @xcite ) .",
    "the other model , by hartigan , raymond , & hartmann ( 1987 ; hereafter hrh87 ) , includes more ionization states and more ultraviolet and optical lines .",
    "we will use the hm89 model as a benchmark , and we will use the [ ] 63 @xmath0 m line as the normalizing factor . in the hm89 model ,",
    "the 63 @xmath0 m line is a significant coolant and should reliably indicate the total energy passing through the shock .",
    "based on the observed width of the line (  [ fabry ] ) , we consider the models with shock velocity @xmath38 km  s@xmath27 . the hm89 model at that velocity that matches the observed [ ] 63 @xmath0 m brightness has pre - shock density @xmath39 @xmath7 .",
    "such a pre - shock density is reasonable considering that we are observing shocks into molecular clouds .",
    "this shock corresponds to what we called ` region m ' (  [ sec : cartoon ] ) , although we suggested a somewhat lower pre - shock density of @xmath11 @xmath7 for this shock .",
    "in fact we do not directly measure @xmath37 and instead estimated it from the density in the emitting region , so a higher @xmath37 could be consistent with the observations .",
    "the compression by the shock depends on many unknown factors , including the strength of the preshock magnetic field .    before stepping through the comparison of more observed results to the models",
    ", we should clarify that the models are themselves significantly different .",
    "the physics of shock fronts , especially into dense gas and dust clouds , with so many modes of energy release and interaction , is exceedingly complex and can not be expected to be accurately predicted by a simple theoretical model .",
    "let us compare the hm89 and hrh87 models for @xmath39 @xmath7 and @xmath38 km  s@xmath27 .",
    "the hrh87 model is called d100 in their paper .",
    "the magnetic field is negligible in the d100 model , but comparing the e100 and b100 models it appears that a stronger magnetic field makes relatively little difference in predicted line brightness within the context of the hrh87 model .",
    "comparing the line brightnesses between the hm89 and hrh87 models , it is clear that there are very significant differences .",
    "an extreme case is the [ ] 6300   line , which is very bright in the hm89 model but weak in the hrh87 model ; the difference is a factor of about 8 .",
    "a significant part of the difference could be neglect of the higher ionization states in the hm89 model ; we suspect the [ ] and [ ] optical lines are much brighter than [ ] .",
    "other significant differences are the importance of ly@xmath40 , many high - excitation ultraviolet lines , and the 2-photon continuum ; all of these are very bright in the hrh87 model .",
    "part of the difference could be neglect of the radiative transfer through dust in the hrh87 model ; we expect most of the ultraviolet photons are absorbed by the cooler layers of the post - shock gas and dust or by the remaining unshocked gas and dust .",
    "comparing our observations to the theoretical shock models , we reach the following conclusions :    _ dust emission_we observe a far - infrared continuum toward the shock fronts , in excess of what we would expect from dust in the quiescent pre - shock gas .",
    "the dust has a color temperature distinctly warmer than dust in molecular or atomic clouds .",
    "this could be due to significant collisional or radiative heating in the post - shock gas raising the equilibrium temperature of the grains , or it could be due to a significant difference in the size distribution of the post - shock grains . indeed the post - shock size distribution is predicted to be significantly different because the larger grains are shattered ( @xcite ) .",
    "the hm89 model predicts too little [ ] 26 @xmath0 m and [ ] 35 @xmath0 m emission by about a factor of 10 . this is probably due to treatment of dust destruction : the elemental abundances in the hm89 model are set at depleted cosmic abundances typical of what may occur in the pre - shock gas , while dust destruction is now predicted to be significant at these shock velocities ( @xcite ) .",
    "the hm89 model predicts some infrared continuum , but its flux is weaker than the [ ] 63 @xmath0 m line , which does not agree with our observations : we find that the continuum flux is much greater than that of any of the emission lines .",
    "the hrh87 is on the opposite extreme : they use the entire cosmic abundance in the gas phase , implicitly assuming complete destruction of the dust and predicting no infrared continuum .",
    "_ infrared versus ultraviolet_the infrared emission escapes from the shocks and arrives at our telescopes , while the ultraviolet ( and optical ) emission either never escapes the shock or is absorbed before reaching us .",
    "the hrh87 model predicts copious ultraviolet emission , with the strongest emission ( in order of brightness ) arising from ly@xmath40 , 2-photon continuum , 977   , and 304   .",
    "the sum of the 5 infrared lines they report is still 20 times weaker than ly@xmath40 and 3 times weaker than just the 304    line .",
    "thus ultraviolet lines ( and 2-photon continuum ) are by far the dominant cooling behind radiative shocks according to the hrh87 model . on the other hand ,",
    "the hm89 model predicts a significantly different spectrum , with relatively brighter optical and infrared lines . the brightest line in the hm89 model is the optical [ ] 6300    line , followed by h@xmath40 and comparable brightnesses of infrared [ ] 63 @xmath0 m , optical [ ] 6731    and [ ] 6560   , and ultraviolet ] 2326    lines .",
    "remarkably , the brightness of the ] 2326    and [ ] 3726 + 3729    lines , and h@xmath40 and h@xmath41 , agree for the two models , but there are many brighter ultraviolet lines in the hrh87 model .",
    "the difference between the two models is at least partially due to the different assumptions about dust grains .",
    "the hrh87 model has no dust grains , so that ultraviolet transitions that are optically thick can scatter from ion to ion and eventually escape the shock or have a quantum decay into two photons .",
    "if dust grains were included , the ultraviolet photons would not last long before being absorbed .",
    "the ultraviolet photons are produced in a thin layer behind the shock , and their energy would heat the surrounding gas , as a radiative precursor into the pre - shock gas and as an enhanced radiation field in the cooler layers of the post - shock gas . in the hm89 model , the radiative transfer does take into account absorption of the ultraviolet lines by dust grains ( @xcite ) , which explains why this model predicts much weaker ultraviolet emission than the hrh87 model .",
    "our detection of a far - infrared continuum suggests that the models must include the effects of dust on the ultraviolet photons .    _",
    "molecules_we detected both the s(3 ) and s(9 ) lines of h@xmath5 (  [ section : h2 ] ) , as well as oh and weak h@xmath5o emission ( @xcite ) .",
    "the model of hrh87 does not include molecules , so we will not discuss it here .",
    "the model of hm89 includes a chemical reaction network , and they predict the brightness of the s(3 ) and s(9 ) lines to be @xmath42 and @xmath43 erg  s@xmath27  @xmath14  sr@xmath27 , respectively .",
    "the predicted brightness of the s(9 ) line is about half of what we observed , suggesting that a significant fraction of the s(9 ) line could be produced by a j - type shock .",
    "however , the predicted brightness of the s(3 ) line is far lower than we observed .",
    "indeed , for all 4 of the molecular shocks we observed , the s(3 ) line is brighter than the s(9 ) line ; this is contrary to the model , which predicts s(3 ) about 10 times weaker than s(9 ) .",
    "instead , it appears that a denser , non - dissociating shock is required to explain the s(9 ) line brightness .",
    "this picture agrees with presence of a preshock cloud with a range of densities , as shown in our cartoon model .",
    "therefore , it appears that the shock models can not simultaneously predict both the ionic lines and ( all of ) the molecular lines with @xmath39  @xmath7 and @xmath38 km  s@xmath27 .",
    "instead , it appears that a denser , non - dissociating shock is required to explain the s(3 ) line brightness .    to explain the brightness and excitation of the oh and h@xmath5o emission , and the @xmath44 km  s@xmath27 width of the co and cs lines , we suggested c - type shocks into gas with density @xmath45 @xmath7 ( reach & rho 98 , 99 ) .",
    "models for such shocks were developed by draine , roberge , & dalgarno ( 1983 ; hereafter drd ) . for @xmath46 @xmath7 and @xmath47 km  s@xmath27 , the drd models predict that h@xmath5 is the dominant coolant , with the brightest lines being s(3 ) and s(5 ) . in the drd model , the s(9 )",
    "line is about 10 times weaker than the s(3 ) line . given that we observe s(3 ) and s(9 ) lines of comparable brightness , it appears that we are required to have the bulk of the the s(3 ) line arise from a c - type shock and part of the s(9 ) line arise from a j - type shock .",
    "the observed surface brightness of the s(3 ) line is lower than the predicted brightness from the drd model ( @xmath48 ) , but that could be due to beam dilution of small , dense clumps that produce the c - type shock .    _",

    "second , we note that the uniform pre - shock conditions in the cox et al . model are not realistic in a large region of the multiple - phase interstellar medium . in our model , we attribute the molecular line observations of w  44 , including h@xmath5 near - infrared emission ( @xcite ) , infrared co lines ( @xcite ) , wide millimeter co and other lines ( @xcite ) , and radio oh 1720 mhz masers ( @xcite ) , to dense , shocked gas .",
    "these lines can not be produced by an ionized low - density post - shock region .",

    "the excitation of [ ] evidenced by the 145/63 @xmath0 m ratio requires a higher density region ( fig .",

    "obviously , [ ] also requires a neutral region , for if the h is ionized the o will also be ionized .",
    "the observed lines were so ` shockingly ' bright that we concluded immediately that they were due to a dense shock ( @xcite ) .",
    "in this paper we considered a wide range of densities and ruled out the low densities because ( 1 ) they are inconsistent with the line ratios , and ( 2 ) the path length required through a low - density gas would be longer than the remnant size in order to build up enough column density to produce the observed line brightness .",
    "cox et al . reduced the brightness of the 63 @xmath0 m by a factor of 100 to match their models .",
    "one of the reduction factors is a a factor of 10 to match the estimated average over the entire remnant .",
    "another factor applied by cox et al . was to enhance their prediction because of limb brightening and local rippling of the shell . while this is perfectly reasonable ,",
    "this correction was applied to the low - resolution 63 @xmath0 m line observations , which trace relatively cool gas , and not to the higher - resolution h@xmath40 observations ( @xcite ) , which trace warmer gas that might be even more edge brightened .",
    "all of these factors probably cancel out to first order when the average over our large beam is made , so that the [ ] /h@xmath40 ratio is not matched by their model .",
    "the truth is probably that there were both high and low density regions in the interstellar medium around the w  44 progenitor star ( as considered in this paper and by @xcite ) .",
    "the particular lines of sight studied in this paper are centered on a special regions , where evidence for a dense shocks are overwhelming .",
    "away from these positions , it is likely that the lower - density shocks contribute some of the low - level 63 @xmath0 m emission . in figure",
    "[ fig : cartoon ] , we are pointed right at a region c clump , while the average over a large region would include different regions in different proportions .",
    "because the 63 @xmath0 m line brightness is expected to scale approximately as @xmath52 ( hm89 ) , the denser regions contribute relatively more to the observed brightness , when they are present . further observational work may be able to separate the dense shocked gas from the more rarefied and widespread interclump gas , using imaging to resolve the clumpy spatial distribution and spectroscopy to separate the narrower line widths .",
    "based on _ iso _ spectroscopic observations of supernova remnants interacting with molecular clouds , we found evidence for a wide range of pre- and post - shock conditions ; these properties are summarized in table  [ tab : cartoon ] and illustrated in figure  [ fig : cartoon ] .",
    "of the three density regimes that we identified , most of the infrared emission arose from the shocks into moderate - density molecular gas ( ` region m ' ) .",
    "the energy of these shocks is radiated via continuum emission from surviving dust grains and [ ] 63 @xmath0 m and [ ] and other infrared atomic fine structure lines .",
    "the dust continuum was difficult to separate from the far - infrared emission from cold , unrelated dust , but the shocked dust was evident at 80100 @xmath0 m as a warmer component of the spectrum .",
    "some of the dust grains must have been destroyed , because we observe bright emission lines from dust ` vapors , ' including the [ ] 26 @xmath0 m line . to produce the observed line dust vapor lines",

    "theoretical models can reproduce the brightness of the 63 @xmath0 m line with such shock velocities and the properties of ` region m ' ( @xcite ) ; theoretical models can also reproduce the observed amount of grain destruction ( @xcite ) .",
    "higher - density gas was required to explain the bright h@xmath5 line emission , leading to our ` region c , ' for clumps .",
    "lower - density gas was required to explain the higher - ionization lines , leading to our ` region a , ' for atomic gas .",
    "a general conclusion from these observations is that molecular shock fronts are copious producers of infrared emission .",
    "we anticipate many applications of these types of observations for further understanding the nature of molecular supernova remnants , such as the fate of dense clumps , the fate of dust grains , and the effect of cooling on the remnant evolution . in turn",

    "if molecular clouds were uniform , or nearly so , then we would expect an orderly progression of pre - shock to post - shock gas , with radiative coolants characteristic of a single shock velocity . on the contrary , we observe emission from coolants as diverse as multi - atom molecules , multiply - ionized atoms , and dust grains and their vapors .",
    "we would like to thank pierre - olivier lagage for helpful discussions in interpreting atomic fine structure lines , and we thank emmanuel caux , steve lord , and sergio molinari for clarifying details of the lws instrument and calibration .",

    "<S> we present _ infrared space observatory _ spectroscopy of sites in the supernova remnants w  28 , w  44 , and 3c  391 , where blast waves are impacting molecular clouds . </S>",
    "<S> the complete wavelength range from 42 to 188 @xmath0 m was observed with the long wavelength spectrometer , as well as narrow ranges centered on 4.695 , 9.665 , 25.98 and 34.82 @xmath0 m with the short wavelength spectrometer . </S>",
    "<S> atomic fine - structure lines were detected from ( in order of atomic number ) : c@xmath1 , n@xmath1 , n@xmath2 , o@xmath3 , o@xmath2 , o@xmath4 , si@xmath1 , p@xmath1 , and fe@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the two lines of h@xmath5 that we observed , s(3 ) and s(9 ) were detected for all three remnants . </S>",
    "<S> the observations require both shocks into gas with moderate ( @xmath6 @xmath7 ) and high ( @xmath8 @xmath7 ) pre - shock densities , with the moderate density shocks producing the ionic lines and the high density shock producing the molecular lines . </S>",
    "<S> no single shock model can account for all of the observed lines , even at the order of magnitude level . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the principal coolants of radiative supernova shocks in moderate - density gas are the far - infrared continuum from dust grains surviving the shock , followed by collisionally - excited [ ] 63.2 @xmath0 m and [ ] 34.8 @xmath0 m lines . </S>",
    "<S> the principal coolant of the high - density shocks is collisionally - excited h@xmath5 rotational and ro - vibrational line emission . </S>",
    "<S> we systematically examine the ground - state fine structure of all cosmically abundant elements , to explain the presence or lack of all atomic fine lines in our spectra in terms of the atomic structure , interstellar abundances , and a moderate - density , partially - ionized plasma . </S>",
    "<S> the [ ] line at 60.6 @xmath0 m is the first known astronomical detection , but its brightness can be explained using the solar abundance of p. there is only one , bright unidentified line in our spectra , at 74.26 @xmath0 m ; as there is no plausible atomic fine - structure line at this wavelength , we suggest this line is molecular . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of bright [ ] and [ ] lines requires partial destruction of the dust . </S>",
    "<S> the required gas - phase abundance of fe suggests 1530% of the fe - bearing grains were destroyed . adding the si and fe gas mass , and correcting for the mass of other elements normally found in dust , we find @xmath9 of dust vapors from the shocked clump 3c  391:bml . </S>",
    "<S> the infrared continuum brightness requires @xmath10 of dust survives the shock , suggesting about 1/3 of the dust mass was destroyed , in agreement with the depletion estimate and with theoretical models for dust destruction . </S>"
