    "quantum computers take direct advantage of superposition and entanglement to perform computations . because quantum algorithms compute in ways which classical computers can not , for certain problems they provide exponential speedups over their classical counterparts @xcite .",
    "that prospect has fostered a variety of proposals suggesting means to implement such a device @xcite .",
    "demille has detailed a prototype design for quantum computation using ultracold polar molecules , trapped in a one - dimensional optical lattice , partially oriented in an external electric field , and coupled by the dipole - dipole interaction @xcite .",
    "this offers a promising platform for quantum computing because scale - up appears feasible to obtain large networks of coupled qubits @xcite .    in previous work , we focused on entanglement and on consequences of using a strong external electric field with appreciable gradient , required to prevent quenching of the dipole moments by rotation and to enable addressing individual qubit sites @xcite .",
    "the molecules were represented as identical , rigid dipoles a fixed distance apart and undergoing pendular oscillations imposed by the external electric field .",
    "we determined the dependence of the entanglement of the pendular qubit states , as measured by the concurrence function , on three unitless variables , all scaled by the rotational constant .",
    "the first specifies the stark energy and intrinsic angular shape of the qubits ; the second specifies the magnitude of the dipole - dipole coupling ; the third variable specifies the thermal energy . under conditions deemed amenable for proposed quantum computers",
    ", we found that both the concurrence and a key frequency shift , @xmath0 , that has a major role in logic gates , become very small for the ground eigenstate . in order that such weak entanglement can suffice for operation of logic gates ,",
    "the resolution must be high enough to detect the @xmath0 shift unambiguously .    for diatomic molecules ,",
    "the stark effect is second - order , therefore a sizable external electric field is required to produce the requisite dipole moments in the laboratory frame . in a subsequent study , we examined symmetric top molecules as candidate qubits @xcite .",
    "symmetric top molecules offer advantages resulting from a first - order stark effect , which renders the effective dipole moments nearly independent of the field strength . that permits the use of a much lower external field strength in addressing sites .",
    "moreover , for a particular choice of qubits , the electric dipole interactions become isomorphous with nmr systems .    here",
    "we study further aspects of how to implement a set of basic quantum gates for pendular qubit states of polar diatomic or linear molecules .",
    "we apply the multi - target optical control theory ( mtoct ) @xcite to design laser pulses that enable resolving and inducing transitions between specified states of the qubit system .",
    "this approach has been previously employed to study optimal control for elements of quantum computation in molecular systems , using as qubits vibrational or rotational states @xcite .",

    "the hamiltonian for an individual trapped polar diatomic or linear molecule in an external electric field @xmath2 can , for our purposes , be reduced just to the rotational kinetic energy and stark interaction terms @xcite :    @xmath3    this represents a spherical pendulum : @xmath4 is the rotational energy , with @xmath5 the rotational constant , and @xmath6 the permanent dipole moment ; @xmath7 is the polar angle between the molecular axis and the external field direction . at the ultracold temperatures that we consider ,",
    "the translational kinetic energy of the trapped molecules is very small and nearly harmonic within the trapping well , so the trapping energy is nearly constant and hence is omitted .",
    "interactions involving open shell electronic structure or nuclear spins or quadrupole moments are also omitted ( but could be incorporated in familiar ways@xcite ) .",
    "the eigenstates of @xmath8 , resulting from mixing of the field - free rotational states by the stark interaction , are designated as pendular states . as proposed by demille @xcite , the qubits @xmath9 and @xmath10",

    "however , @xmath15 remains good as long as azimuthal symmetry about @xmath2 is maintained .",
    "the qubits thus are superpositions of spherical harmonics ,    @xmath16    adding a second molecule into the trap , identical to the first but at distance @xmath17 from it , introduces in addition to its pendular term the dipole - dipole interaction , @xmath18 .",
    "averaging over the azimuthal angles @xcite , which for @xmath19 states are uniformly distributed , reduces the dipole - dipole interaction to    @xmath20    where @xmath21 , with @xmath22 . as depicted in fig .",

    ", it remains an open question whether , in the presence of line broadening induced by the static external electric field , adequate resolution can be obtained to resolve unambiguously a frequency shift of only  50 khz @xcite .",
    "such a small @xmath0 is also a severe handicap for our theoretical simulation of laser - driven logic gates .",
    "for instance , the laser pulse duration @xcite required for realizing the cnot gate is @xmath90 .",
    "hence a frequency shift so small as 50 khz requires that the laser pulse duration is at least 31@xmath91 .",
    "recently , zaari and brown studied the effect of laser pulse shaping parameters about the fidelity in realizing the quantum gates .",
    "they proved that the amplitude variation and frequency resolution plays the important role in the fidelity @xcite .",
    "we will explore the impacts of those two coefficients in the future work .",
    "that is much longer than the self - evolution period of the system , about 29 ps . if we set the computation time step at 0.25 ps , a single simulation run would need @xmath92 steps .",
    "our mtoct calculations involve many iterative runs ; e. g. , for a cnot gate about 440 iterations . with current computers",
    ", such a calculation would be daunting : it would need about 700 gb of ram storage to perform and each iteration would take about 2.8 days , in total nearly 3.5 years for standard i7 core .    to make the calculation feasible , we reduced the spacing between the dipoles ten - fold , which increases @xmath93 by 1000-fold , and thus @xmath94 and the laser pulse duration shortens to  33 ns . then simulation runs have @xmath95 steps , the ram needed shrinks to 700 mb , and the computation time to about 4 minutes per iteration , so @xmath96 hours for 440 iterations",
    "the reduced dipole - dipole spacing , which becomes only 50 nm , actually corresponds to the range recently proposed for plasma - enhanced , electric / electrooptical traps , for which the trap frequencies can exceed 100 mhz @xcite , and might be attainable in an optical ferris wheel device @xcite . reducing the spacing",
    "so markedly is not considered practical , however , because it would strongly foster inelastic , spontaneous raman scattering of lattice photons and hence induce unacceptably large decoherence @xcite .",
    "the resort to taking @xmath17 unrealistically small was done reluctantly but enables us to illustrate the general utility of mtoct applied to quantum logic gates .    in the simulations ,",

    "@xcite , mishima and yamashita pointed out that the purpose of the phase constraint is preventing each state evolving to different phases , which can provide the correct quantum logical gates .",
    "recently , zaari and brown pointed out that align the phase of all qubits appropriately can lead to effective subsequent quantum gates ( laser pulses ) @xcite .    in table",
    "[ table_not ] , we show both the initial and target states for the not gate for the two dipoles .",
    "the optimized laser pulse for not gates applied to dipole 1 and dipole 2 separately is shown in the upper panel of fig . [ not ] . the pulse for the not gate applied on dipole 1",
    "was obtained after 146 iterations with the converged fidelity difference of @xmath101 ; the pulse for dipole 2 took 76 iterations with the converged fidelity of 0.985 . in our simulation , the total iteration number is decided by two main effects , the fidelity and the difference between the fidelity and the fidelity of the previous step .",
    "if the fidelity is greater than 0.9 and the difference is smaller than @xmath102 , the iteration will stop .",
    "both pulses have similar maximum intensity , about 1.2 kv / cm . in order to verify the performance of this pulse as well as the time evolution of the system within the laser pulse , we chose an initial state @xmath103 and examined the population evolution .",
    "for an ideal pulse , the final state for the action of a not gate on dipole 1 should yield a final state of @xmath104 .",
    "correspondingly , the final state for a not gate on dipole 2 should be @xmath105 .",
    "the population evolution due to this pulse assistance is shown in the lower panel of fig . [ not ] . before achieving the final state ,",
    "the population of each state oscillates a number of cycles .",
    "the not pulse for dipole 1 produced the converged population for state @xmath106 to be 0.756 and that of @xmath107 to be 0.240 , while the pulse for dipole 2 yielded populations of 0.263 and 0.723 for states @xmath106 and @xmath107 , respectively .",
    "as this final yield result approaches the ideal case @xmath108 , we conclude that the optimal laser pulse drives the system from an initial state to a target state according to table [ table_not ] for not gates .    the converged laser pulses by which to realize the hadamard gate for both dipoles are shown in fig .",
    "[ hadamard ] and the initial and target states are given in table [ table_hadamard ] .",
    "the fidelity for each pulse on each site is 0.944 and 0.902 , respectively .",
    "the maximum intensity for the pulse is around 1.8 kv / cm , slightly larger than that for not gates .",
    "we selected @xmath106 as our initial state and plotted the time evolution in fig .",
    "[ hadamard ] .",
    "the population evolution of the hadamard gate for dipole 1 is similar to the situation of the not gate ( fig . [ not ] ) .",
    "the population of different states oscillates and finally yields 0.491 for @xmath109 and 0.508 for @xmath107 . for the hadamard gate on dipole 2 ,",
    "the population for @xmath110 and @xmath107 is almost zero during the entire evolution .",
    "but the population switches between @xmath106 and @xmath109 .",
    "this population oscillation commences at 6 ns and continues until the end of the pulse with a mean value of 0.5 and amplitude around 0.5 .",
    "the final converged population is 0.529 for @xmath106 and 0.470 for @xmath109 .",
    "the population transfer , shown in table [ table_hadamard ] , going from an initial state to a target state , indicates that the design pulse successfully implemented the hadamard gate .",
    "there is a small variation among all fidelity values we obtained in the simulation , which range from 0.902 to 0.985 .",
    "this is due to the short duration of the laser pulse we are using in the simulation .",
    "the fidelity could be improved further by extending the duration of the laser pulse .",
    "fig.[cnot ] shows the converged laser pulse which performs the cnot gate ; the pulse is highly oscillatory with total duration time of 33 ns .",
    "the rapid oscillation is due to the short system evolution period .",
    "the maximum amplitude of the pulse is around 1.5 kv / cm , in the range easily achieved experimentally .",
    "the laser pulse was obtained after 441 iterations and yields fidelity of 0.975 .",
    "if we use the same initial condition as that for not gates , the ideal final state should be @xmath111 .",
    "the simulated population evolution due to the laser pulse evolved is plotted in the lower panel of fig.[cnot ] .",

    "[ cnot ] follows the initial and target results of table [ table_cnot ] , thus confirming the correct operation of the cnot gate .    in order to test , at least modestly ,",
    "how the mtoct approach responds to a change in pulse duration for the dipole - dipole system , we increased the spacing between the two dipoles to 75 nm .",
    "the frequency shift then becomes @xmath114 and the duration of the laser pulse is 110 ns .",
    "we carried out the simulations just for the cnot gate .",
    "the optimized laser pulse is shown in fig .",
    "[ cnot_15p ] .",
    "after 500 iterations , the converged fidelity is 0.90 , which is slightly smaller than for the 50 nm spacing .",
    "again , we tested one sample initial state . the population evolution is plotted in fig .",
    "[ cnot_15p ] . as before , the population oscillation continued during the whole process and the final population obtained confirms the cnot operation .",
    "this serves to indicate that the mtoct approach is stable and provides a useful general means to implement logic gates for dipole - dipole systems .",
    "we have applied the mtoct methodology to pendular states for a pair of polar molecules ( sro ) to determine the optimum laser pulse for implementing the not , cnot and hadamard quantum logic gates .",
    "our results confirm that , for the conditions adopted ( @xmath115 , resulting in @xmath116 ) , a single laser pulse ( with minimum duration @xmath117 ns and amplitude @xmath118 kv / cm ) suffices to operate these gates with high fidelity .",
    "however , computational limitations ( storage and time ) did not permit us to treat conditions ( @xmath119 nm , with @xmath120 khz ) that are considered congenial for experimental implementation .",
    "this shortcoming is also manifest , in different ways , in two previous applications of mtoct to assess laser - operated logic gates for polar molecules .",
    "table [ table_compare ] compares our conditions with those studies .",
    "both nominally emulated the design by demille @xcite , with two ultracold trapped diatomic molecules entangled via dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "the version most akin to ours , presented by bomble , et al @xcite , considered a pair of nacs molecules , with the external static field aligned along the intramolecular axis , @xmath17 . then @xmath121 ( rather than @xmath122 as in our case ) and hence @xmath123 .",
    "the qubits were taken as rotational states mixed by the stark effect to second order ( thus a fairly good approximation to the pendular eigenstates we used ) .",
    "the conditions adopted ( @xmath124 nm , resulting in @xmath125 ) are considered suitable for experimental implementation . however , in carrying out the mtoct computations for our system , a very large step size of 10 ps was used . that avoided entirely the storage and time limitations we encountered ( with step size 0.25 ps ) .",
    "however , we found that replicate calculations using a 10 ps step size gave markedly irreproducible results for the optimal laser properties and population evolution of the logic gates under our simulation system .    the other previous version , presented by mishima and yamashita @xcite omits altogether an external static electric field , and takes as qubits the lowest `` pure '' rotational states ( @xmath126 , @xmath127 and @xmath128 , @xmath127 ) and lowest vibrational states of each molecule",
    ". specific alignments of the molecular axis with respect to a laboratory fixed z - axis are considered , but that is unrealistic because without an external electric field the molecular axis distribution is isotropic and the laboratory projections of the dipole moments vanish , as emphasized elsewhere @xcite . also unrealistic from an experimental perspective",
    "is the choice of an extremely small distance between the molecules @xmath129 .",
    "that produces large entanglement but would induce severe decoherence @xcite .",
    "the mtoct treatment of logic gates is nonetheless of interest , since the choice of `` pure '' rotational states as qubits results in @xmath130 .",
    "then , if the molecules are identical , transitions involving qubits on different sites can not be resolved . in order to target individually the two sites , two different laser fields were used . in the mtoct analysis ,",
    "the separate laser pulses for gate operations then were much shorter and simpler than in our application using the same laser for both sites .",
    "for instance , to perform a cnot gate using `` pure '' rotational states with two lasers took only @xmath131 ps @xcite , whereas our use of pendular qubits with one laser required up to @xmath132 ps ( see figs . [ cnot ] and [ cnot_15p ] ) .",
    "although the two - laser mode is theoretically inviting , it requires spatial resolution adequate for each laser to drive only one of the two molecules . that is not feasible unless the distance between the molecules is much larger than 5 nm .",
    "another means to contend with @xmath133 , or when it too small to resolve , has been exemplified in designs employing superconducting flux qubits @xcite .",
    "again , that method requires spatial resolution sufficient to enable qubits on different sites to be driven individually .",
    "taken together , the three studies of table [ table_compare ] illustrate both the utility of mtoct and the limitations imposed by present - day computational capability .",
    "aptly , those limitations foster yearning for the arrival of a quantum computer .",
