    "blazars are one of the most intriguing class of objects among the active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and include bl lacertae objects ( bl lac ) and flat - spectrum radio quasars ( fsrq ) .",
    "the intrinsic differences between these two types of sources are in their optical spectra and in the intensity of their emission : a bl lac source does not show any optical emission lines ( @xmath12 ) and it is basically a low - power blazar ( @xmath13 erg s@xmath14 ) , whereas a fsrq source shows significant emission line equivalent widths and corresponds to a high - power blazar ( @xmath15 erg s@xmath14 ) @xcite . in the agn unified scheme @xcite ,",
    "blazars are interpreted as radio - sources with a relativistic jet aligned along the line of sight @xcite ; in other words , the class of blazars is represented by radio loud ( rl ) agn observed very close to the direction of the relativistic jets ( @xmath16 ) .    the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of blazars is usually modelled with two large humps produced via synchrotron ( peaking in the infra - red to soft x - ray energy band ) and inverse compton ( ic ) emission , dominating the hard x - ray to gamma - ray regimes , respectively .",
    "the lower energy emission component is synchrotron radiation from the jet whereas the high - energy component arises through the inverse compton of soft photons by highly relativistic electrons in the jet plasma .",
    "these soft photons originate from the local synchrotron radiation within the jet or the nuclear optical / uv emission , namely synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) and external compton ( ec ) components , respectively ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the x - ray spectrum of an agn is usually well described by a power - law with a specific flux ( i.e. per unit energy interval ) of the form @xmath17 , where e is the energy , n(e ) is the number of photons in units of s@xmath14 @xmath3 kev@xmath14 and @xmath8 is the _",
    "photon index_. however , x - ray spectra of blazars show some deviations from the simple power - law .",
    "these spectral signatures appear in the soft x - ray band with a curvature ( a flattening or a steepening of the spectrum ) ; in addition , the presence of compton reflection components in rl objects is still debated .    a clear physical interpretation of these features has not yet been found . in the present work ,",
    "we investigate these still open questions in order to achieve a better understanding of the general properties of the blazars spectra .",
    "the state - of - art of the study of these important issues can be summarize as follows :    1 .",
    "two physical interpretations to the flattening of the primary intrinsic continuum with respect to a simple power - law exist so far @xcite : absorption in excess of the galactic component ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and a break in the intrinsic continuum @xcite . for the absorption excess ,",
    "a dependence between the hydrogen column density of the absorber ( @xmath6 ) and the redshift @xmath18 has been proposed .",
    "in fact in a former work by @xcite based on xmm observations of a sample of 32 rl sources , a @xmath6-@xmath18 correlation has been found .",
    "contrary to radio quiet ( rq ) sources the presence of reflection features - most notably the fe @xmath5 line and the associated compton reflection `` hump '' at about @xmath19 kev - from the cores of the rl agn is not well established . in particular , the reprocessed features are generally intense and always detected in rq agn @xcite , whereas in rl agn the iron line and the reflection component can be absent or weak .",

    "the wide energy range covered by the instruments is well suited to better address their spectral behaviour .    in sections 2.1 - 2.4",
    "we present the data set and analysis , while in section 3.1 we show the details of the spectral analysis .",
    "the results are discussed in section 3.2 and in section 3.3 a study of the distribution of different spectral parameters and possible correlation is discussed and finally , we summarize the results in section 4 .",
    "the integral / ibis total sample is derived from the third ibis / isgri survey catalog that included 421 sources for a total exposure time of 40ms ; 131 sources out of 421 have been identified as agn .",
    "the survey input data set consists of all pointing data available at the end of 2006 may , from revolutions 12 - 429 inclusive , covering the time period from launch ( 17 october 2002 ) to the end of 2006 april .",

    ", we can see that the spectra of the majority of the sources clearly show a deficit of soft x - ray counts with respect to the simple power - law model , indicating the possible presence of excess absorption and/or of an energy break in the intrinsic continuum .    in order to properly reproduce such a feature we tested the impact of different models .",
    "in the model b we added an extra - absorption in the rest - frames of the sources ( phabs*zphabs*zpo model in xspec ) and results are presented in table 5 .",
    "all sources of our sample , with the exception of pks 2149 - 307 and pks 1830 - 211 , were well fitted with the model b , while for the source pks 2149 - 307 we have obtained an upper limit value on the intrinsic absorbing column density and for pks 1830 - 211 only a poor quality fit to the data has been derived .",
    "details on this source will be discussed later in this section .",
    "then , we tested a broken power - law continuum model c ( phabs*bknpo model in xspec ) for the whole sample .",
    "results are shown in the table 6 .",
    "this model did not improve the fit further in most of the cases and , also in those cases for which a slightly better @xmath40 is obtained , the null hypothesis probability increases only a few per cent with respect to model b. although strong statistical evidence does not exist for a broken power - law respect to the absorbed one , however the presence of an intrinsic spectral break can not be ruled out .",
    "for pks 1830 - 211 , both models b and c fail to reproduce source data .",
    "pks 1830 - 211 is a gravitationally lensed galaxy and the excess absorption can be attributed to the intervening galaxy at redshift @xmath71 . the best - fit of the observed spectrum requires both an absorber and a broken power - law ( model d ) , confirming the results reported by @xcite with three xmm - newton observations obs.id 0204580201 , 0204580301 and 0204580401 and the integral average data ( up to april 29 , 2006 ) .",
    "in fact , in addition to the excess cold absorption , pks 1830 - 211 also exhibits an energy break at about @xmath72 kev in the observer frame .",
    "moreover , our result for the absorption in excess to the galactic one , is in agreement with that obtained previously by @xcite with chandra observations and a subset of the actual ibis data .",
    "table 7 reports the results of our best - fit model .",
    "finally , we also checked a compton reflection component with a power - law reflected from neutral matter ( pexrav model in xspec , @xcite ) ; the reflection component is parameterized in terms of @xmath73=@xmath74 , the solid angle in units of @xmath75 subtended by the reflecting matter , assumed to be observed face - on ) .",
    "this model resulted in a worst fit and upper limit values on @xmath73 for all absorbed sources ( see table 8) .",
    "in addition , we have searched for the presence of an iron line emission in the spectra of our sources . to this aim",
    ", we adopted the following method : we exclude the fe k band , fit a continuum , then freeze the continuum , after we include the fe k band and perform the fit again .",
    "the comparison between the values of the @xmath40 of the fits performed including and excluding the fe k band provides us a clear indication for the real presence of this feature of the observed spectra .",
    "for all sources , but one ( igr j22517 + 2218 ) , the application of this method does not produce any clear evidence for the presence of this feature in the spectrum .",
    "the main results for the source igr j22517 + 2218 can be summarized as follows : the first step described before resulted in a photon index @xmath8=1.5 and an upper limit on @xmath76=5@xmath7710@xmath78 @xmath3 with @xmath79/dof=23/29 ; in the second step we included the iron channels and then we added a narrow line ( @xmath80=0.01 kev ) and the fit has been repeated obtaining @xmath79/dof=37/44 with a probability @xmath81 implying that this feature is real with an equivalent width ew=@xmath82 ev ; repeating the fit with a free photon index a value of @xmath83 is obtained with an iron line that is significant at the 99% . in summary , for this source there is the evidence for the presence of a weak line significant at the 99% level .    as a conclusion",

    "this phenomenon has been previously observed in several samples of rl objects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and its origin is not yet well understood .",
    "it can be produced by either an intrinsically curved continuum or an extra absorption component .",
    "the broken continuum hypothesis is linked to the blazar - type source .",
    "in fact , in the hypothesis of an intrinsically curved blazar continuum , one can assume that the relativistic electrons in the jet follow a broken power - law energy distribution with a low energy cut - off , producing a flattening in the observed spectrum .",
    "this is a purely phenomenological form assumed to reproduce the observed shape of the blazar seds , without any specific assumption on the acceleration / cooling mechanism acting on the particles ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "alternatively , it can be also assumed there is an inefficient radiative cooling of lower energy electrons of the jet producing a few synchrotron photons to be scattered at higher energies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we emphasize that on basis of our spectral analysis an intrinsic spectral break can not be ruled out ( see the values of the reduced @xmath40 and of the null hypothesis probability listed in the tables 5 and 6 ) . in this context",
    ", we just noted that the existence of a break in the intrinsic continuum is tightly related to the electron distribution , but important constraints on the curved electron distribution can be derived only analyzing both synchrotron and ec components in the sed , that is out of the aim of present work .",
    "therefore we will focus the following discussion on the absorption scenario .",
    "the absorption explanation takes into account an absorbing gas in excess of the galactic one ; in some cases , the absorbing medium can be cold ( not ionized ) and located either between the observer and the source along the line of sight at a different redshift with respect to the blazar ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or at the same redshift of the source ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and it is namely an intrinsic cold absorber .    for an absorber located at several redshifts between the observer and the source , the damped ly - alpha systems are the more plausible cause ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the line of sight would have to pass through two or more very high column density damped ly - alpha systems ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , this is a rare occurrence ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and favours the hypothesis of an intrinsic absorber with column densities of the order @xmath175 @xmath3 . an intrinsic origin is also confirmed by the soft x - ray spectral flattening detected so far only in radio loud objects @xcite .",
    "the intrinsic hypothesis also suggests that the medium could be `` warm '' at the same stage . in this case , the absorbing medium , at the same redshift of the agn ( probably , the inner part of the dense interstellar medium of the young host galaxy ) , is ionized as due to the proximity from the jet ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    ".    for our sample , the fitting procedure supports the presence of an intrinsic ( local to the agn ) cold absorber for all sources .",
    "nevertheless a warm absorber model ( absori in xspec ) can be excluded since the model with an ionized - gas produces a worse fit and an inconsistent value for the ionization parameter ( @xmath176 @xmath177 @xmath178 @xmath64 and @xmath179 @xmath180 @xmath177 @xmath178 @xmath64 , values indicating a neutral absorber and a completely ionized absorber , respectively ) .    the information on the absorption is of crucial importance to understand the blazar environment and its interaction with the jet .",
    "absorption originating from the material present in the agn environment seems to be a more convincing explanation for many sources belonging to the class of rl agn ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "there is some evidence not only of absorption but also of a correlation between absorption and redshift , with the more distant sources being more absorbed and the increase in @xmath6 with @xmath18 occurring starting at @xmath181 @xcite .",
    "we note that more than half of the sources in our sample appear in agreement with this scenario , since this fraction of objects has a redshift larger than 2 .    as far it concerns the nature of this absorber , we suggest it could be associated to the presence of gas in the host galaxy illuminated by the blazar jet .",
    "the excess of intrinsic absorption in the rest - frame of the rl objects compared with the lack of absorption above the galactic value of their rq counterparts @xcite , suggests that an intrinsic difference could exist in the local environments of the two classes of objects .",
    "since the x - ray spectra of rl agn appear to be dominated by the emission of the jet component , most likely the absorbing material is linked to the presence of this component .",
    "this working scenario is supported by a theory presented , e.g. , in @xcite , in which the confinement of the radio jet needs the presence of a cold medium ( local to the agn ) so that jet expansion is suppressed .    in our sample",
    "we have found neither an evidence of an iron emission line at 6.4 kev nor evidence of a compton reflection `` hump '' above 10 kev .",
    "the lack of these spectral features  interpreted as the result of reprocessing of the primary continuum by cold matter around the x - ray source , presumably the accretion disk @xcite  can be explained either with the out - and - out absence of reprocessing features in blazar - type objects or with the hypothesis that these features are difficult to be detect in strong radio sources being likely dilute by the jet @xcite .",
    "there is also evidence that the spectral shape does not change between @xmath22 kev and @xmath26 kev energy ranges , supporting the idea that , above @xmath182 kev , no additional component to the power - law ( e.g. compton reflection hump ) is present in the spectrum .",
    "the value of the cross - calibration constant ( see tables b and c ) shows that a strong flux variability is present in qso b0836 + 710 , 1es 0033 + 595 , pks 1830 - 211 , igr j22517 + 2218 , bl lac , and 3c 279 . in particular , we derived that igr j22517 + 2218 showed severe intensity changes between the integral and the swift observations with a value of the xrt / ibis inter - calibration factor of about @xmath183 .",
    "this is not a surprise because of the nature of the object and data being not simultaneous .",
    "in addition , we remark that integral / ibis data set correspond to an average performed on observations spanning on 3 years , while the data for the low - energy range ( xmm and xrt ) correspond to observations with a time baseline of few hours .",
    "although the number of sources of our sample is not large , we have also analyzed the distribution of the spectral parameters ( absorbing column density , spectral index , redshift ) and their possible correlations .",
    "this type of analysis has been performed , so far , only between @xmath22 kev @xcite .",
    "our study is still preliminary and has been performed with a detailed comparison among the results of our own spectral analysis and those already available in literature in a limited energy range .",
    "the reference sample includes 35 rl objects  with 19/35 sources identified as blazars ",
    "@xcite and shows an absorption of unknown intrinsic nature . in order to avoid any problem of `` orientation dependence bias '' when studying the @xmath6 and @xmath8 distribution , we have selected , from the quoted sample , only the blazar - type objects . in particular , for the @xmath6 study we have accounted for the blazars with a specific value of the intrinsic absorption",
    "( we have not accounted for the upper limits on @xmath6 ) , obtaining a sub - sample of 16 objects .    in the framework of a possible @xmath6-redshift relation",
    ", we also combined our results with the larger sample of rl objects @xcite , counting out three sources belonging to our sample ( qso b0836 + 710 pks 2149 - 307 and pks 0537 - 286 ) .",
    "in fact , it is interesting to check whether the 9 selected blazars in the sample and analyzed in a more wide energy band , follow the trend of @xmath6 with the redshift previously found by @xcite . if this would be the case , we would have further evidence that the absorbing column density , in these sources , is linked to the distance and thus a confirmation of a cosmic evolution effect .",
    "we made a detailed analysis of the rest - frame hydrogen column density for our selected blazars , in conjunction with the intervening absorption in excess to the galactic one .",
    "for our sample objects over the @xmath20 kev energy range.,width=241 ]     distribution of a larger sample of 16 blazars over the @xmath22 kev energy range .",
    "see text for more details.,width=241 ]     as a function of the redshift for our sample.,width=321 ]     as a function of the redshift , combining the results of our sources ( filled rhombs ) and the ones of a larger sample ( plus and cross signs ) analyzed in the soft x - ray energy range.,width=321 ]    the @xmath6 distribution shown in figure 2 appears to be asymmetric , with a peak located at about @xmath184 and tails extending towards low and high values up to @xmath185 and @xmath186 , respectively .",
    "it is worth to note that the statistical significance of this result is strongly affected by the limited number of objects in our sample .",
    "therefore we compare our sample with the larger sub - sample from the literature observed in the @xmath22 kev energy range from xmm - newton that includes 16 rl objects identified as blazars and with a specific value of the absorption .",
    "we underline that this one includes only one object belonging to our sample ( the blazar qso b0836 + 710 ) .",
    "the @xmath6 distribution of the larger sample is shown in figure 3 , with a peak located at @xmath187 and a tail extending towards lower values up to @xmath185 .",
    "comparing the distributions in figure 3 and in figure 2 , we note that sources with absorbing column density around @xmath186 are `` missing '' .",
    "this evidence is expected in view of the fact that in the soft x - ray energy range ( @xmath22 kev ) the sources with an absorbing column density @xmath188 @xmath2 @xmath3 are almost completely obscured .",
    "this occurrence strongly suggests that data above @xmath182 kev represent a crucial tool to construct an unbiased selection of heavily absorbed objects .",
    "the @xmath6-redshift trend of our sample is shown in figure 4 .",
    "the comparison of this @xmath6-@xmath18 plot with those previously analyzed by @xcite at various redshifts for a sample of 32 rl sources , seems to indicate that the property of the x - ray absorbing gas evolves with cosmic time .",
    "this trend is shown in figure 5 , where we added 3 objects analyzed by @xcite .",
    "in fact , at first glance , a correlation between @xmath6 and redshift seems to exist and , compared to low redshifts ( @xmath189 ) , a shift toward higher values of @xmath6 seems to be indicated at high redshifts .",
    "the sample of 32 sources includes 3 objects of our sample ( qso b0836 + 710 , pks 0537 - 286 and pks 2149 - 307 ) and the @xmath6 values for these 3 sources as obtained through our spectral analysis are in agreement with those presented in the work of yuan and collaborators ( 2006 ) .    the existence of a correlation is also confirmed by the statistical analysis : we obtain a correlation coefficient ( @xmath73 ) around 0.7 ( figure 5 ) , when the results corresponding to our sample are added to the sources investigated by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "all together these results seem to support the hypothesis of an intrinsic absorber .",
    "three further hints support its intrinsic nature :    * the existence of a spatial isotropy of the inter - galactic absorbers is most unlikely ; * the x - ray absorption is associated with rl but not with rq objects @xcite .",
    "this evidence supports the hypothesis that the absorber are physically associated with the rl quasars ; * the change of the @xmath6 distribution that seems to occur at @xmath181 and the decrease of the slope in the @xmath6-@xmath18 relation at @xmath190 could indicate an effect of cosmic evolution .",
    "this effect could be due , e.g. , to a rate of stellar formation .",
    "in fact , an increase of the stellar formation at @xmath191 could reduce the amount of gas in the host galaxy .",
    "the photon - index distribution was then investigated by adding the fsrq 3c 273 and 4c 04.42 in our analysis ( @xmath192 and @xmath193 , respectively , as obtained by our broad - band analysis ) .",
    "the @xmath8 distribution for the complete sample is shown in figure 6 and the mean value obtained in @xmath20 kev energy band is @xmath194 .",
    "kev energy range.,width=241 ]        for comparison , in figure 7 we also show the photon index distribution derived from @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for 35 sources .",
    "the @xmath8 distribution of our sample shows a peak at @xmath10 , whereas the @xmath8 distribution of the rl objects shows a peak corresponding to a steeper value of @xmath8 @xmath195 .",
    "however , we note here that our sample is mainly composed by fsrq , while the larger sample contains different types of rl objects - not all identified as blazars . therefore , in order to perform a meaningful comparison , we have studied the photon index distribution for sources  in the larger sample  identified as blazars ( 19 objects ) .",
    "the peak of the @xmath8 distribution ( see figure 8) is , again , around @xmath196 .            to account for the fact that most of the sources in our sample are fsrq - type objects and that fsrqs in x - rays show a lower value of @xmath8 with respect to bl lac objects",
    ", we studied the @xmath8 distribution including only the fsrq sources ( 15 objects ) in the larger sample . in this case",
    ", the @xmath8 distribution in figure 9 shows a peak at @xmath192 , a value steeper than that for our blazars sample",
    ".    the differences between the values of @xmath8 of our sample and those of the larger sample could be due to the hard x - ray selection of our integral / ibis sample , which is clearly biased towards the flatter values of the photon index .",
    "in this work we presented a broad - band x - ray spectral study of a sample of 9 blazars ( with a redshift range of @xmath197 ) observed with integral , xmm - newton and swift . the main results can be summarized as follows :    * the broad - band spectra of all selected sources are well reproduced with a power - law model absorbed by an amount of gas in excess to the galactic one ( @xmath1-@xmath2@xmath3 in rest - frame of the source ; only an upper limit of @xmath198 @xmath199@xmath3 has been derived for the fsrq pks 2149 - 307 ) . *",
    "the absorption seems to be a signature of a cold intrinsic absorber , confirming and extending to larger sample previous results quoted in the literature @xcite . *",
    "the present work provides a further confirmation of the existence of a @xmath6-redshift trend , obtained for a large sample of rl objects ( not only blazars ) . *",
    "the broad - band analysis of our sample of blazars revealed a harder spectrum with a photon - index of the order of @xmath10 , compared to the value obtained with the distribution including the fsrq sources of the larger sample ( 15 objects ) .",
    "such a difference could be due to the hard x - ray selection of our integral / ibis sample which is clearly biased towards flatter values of the photon index .",
    "* we have found no evidence of reflection components ( reflection `` hump '' and iron emission line ) , with the exception of the source igr j22517 + 2218 that shows the presence of a weak iron line .",
    "this result is expected in blazar - type objects .    in conclusion , the analysis presented here has shown that our integral - sample selection favours objects heavily absorbed and with a flatter value of spectral index .",
    "on the other hand , the present broad - band analysis of integral / ibis , xmm - newton and swift observations of rl qsos confirms that the observed flattening is common in these objects , and is clearly detected in eight quasars of our sample ( 8/9 ) .",
    "the assumption of an intrinsic origin and a cold nature for the absorber is consistent with previous results up to @xmath182 kev obtained by @xcite and @xcite with xmm - newton data only .",
