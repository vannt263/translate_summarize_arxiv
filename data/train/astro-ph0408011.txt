    "since the publication of the apm survey @xcite the deficit of galaxies in the resulting number counts has remained a troublesome issue ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "however , invoking strong galaxy evolution at low redshifts is also problematic as it requires the presence of a high - redshift tail in the @xmath2 which is not apparent .",
    "evidence for the presence of a large zero - point error in the apm photometry has recently been provided by @xcite , who find an offset of 0.31 magnitudes with respect to ccd @xmath4-band photometry for 725 matched galaxies over 297 deg@xmath1 below @xmath10=17.15 . together with a small correction to the fainter @xmath1117 apm photometry by @xcite , the apm counts are now more reasonable with only a @xmath025% deficit at @xmath4=16 .",
    "recently , large redshift surveys have also begun to elucidate a possible cause of the low apm counts .",
    "the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the las campanas redshift survey ( lcrs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the eso slice project ( esp ; * ? ? ?",

    "the 2dfgrs strips along with the corresponding @xmath3-band counts extracted from the 2 micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) second incremental release catalogue , to models guided by the 2dfgrs @xmath2 .",
    "they found good agreement between the optical and @xmath3-band counts and the expected trends defined by the 2dfgrs @xmath2 , indicating that the number counts in the 2dfgrs fields are a direct consquence of real features in the galaxy distribution and that low redshift luminosity evolution does not play a significant role .",
    "however , due to incompleteness in the 2mass second incremental release , a comparison between the apm survey area number counts and the corresponding @xmath3-band counts could not be made .    here",

    "the counts are in good agreement with these models and confirm the earlier work of @xcite suggesting that features in the bright number counts are exclusively due to real structures in the local galaxy distribution .",
    "the fact that the deficit in the counts can be explained purely by features in the @xmath2 and that this agreement is present to the same extent in different passbands suggests that deficiencies in bright magnitude galaxy counts are unlikely to be caused by strong luminosity evolution at low redshifts .",
    "having verified the usefulness of number counts as a probe of the local galaxy distribution , we now wish to examine the counts over the much larger apm survey area in order to determine to what extent the observed deficiency in the optical apm counts may be due to a real underdensity , and whether the deficit in the optical counts is complemented by a similar deficit in the 2mass @xmath3-band counts .",

    "this indicates that the local hole can only be explained if the large - scale correlation of galaxies is significantly more extended than detected by the 2dfgrs or predicted by the @xmath6cdm model .",
    "we can also gain a handle on the significance of the under - density more directly by using the 2-dimensional equivalent of equation 1 which employs the 2-point angular correlation function .",

    "the angular power spectrum is useful in determining the form of galaxy fluctuations at extremely large scales .",
    "the 2mass survey is particularly useful for applying this technique as it covers almost the entire sky and so has a well - behaved window function .",

    "the angular power is then determined as the ratio of the observed signal to the expected poisson fluctuation , @xmath40 :    @xmath42    such that @xmath43=1 corresponds to a random distribution for all - sky coverage .    in order to compare the empirical power spectrum to some cosmological prediction",
    ", we take the transfer function fitting formulae of @xcite which are essentially perfect in the linear regime ( @xmath4430 ) .",
    "we take a linear biasing scheme such that @xmath45=@xmath46 .",
    "the three dimensional power spectrum is then collapsed to two dimensions using a bessel function transform , and the 2mass selection function is imposed upon it @xcite .",
    "= 3.4 in    = 3.4 in    in fig .",
    "[ fig : cl1 ] we show the angular power spectrum for 518,576 @xmath47 , @xmath4820@xmath33 2mass galaxies . also shown are the mean and 1@xmath34 spread from 27 mock 2mass catalogues constructed from the @xmath6cdm hubble volume mock catalogue , and the corresponding linear model for the input hubble volume mock catalogue parameters . in each case , we take a bias of @xmath49=1.0 . we compute the angular power spectrum to @xmath44=100 only , since beyond this the angular scales involved become dominated by uncertain forms to the bias .",
    "the 2mass angular power spectrum is in reasonable agreement with the unbiased mock angular power spectra although the 2mass angular power spectrum slope is steeper , implying some discrepancy with the hubble volume mock in the unbiased case .",
    "therefore it seems that either the hubble volume mock angular power spectrum does not agree with the 2mass angular power spectrum or there exists a scale - dependent bias . with the introduction of scale - independent bias this discrepancy may clearly shift to smaller scales where there is good agreement in the unbiased case ; clearly , the issue of bias is critical in determining the level of disagreement between the hubble volume mock catalogue and 2mass . if we take a bias of @xmath50 @xcite , the disagreement at large scales ( @xmath5130 ) is at the @xmath03@xmath34 level .",
    "the model linear prediction is in good agreement with the mock 2mass power spectra below @xmath5230 although the model slope is shallower than the mean mock power spectrum ; beyond this scale non - linear effects begin to dominate .",
    "we wish to probe to what extent the 2mass angular power spectrum discriminates between different cosmologies , and whether it is in disagreement with @xmath6cdm . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cl1 ] we show the 2mass angular power spectrum as before with errorbars taken from the 1@xmath34 spread of the 27 mock 2mass power spectra ; in doing this we assume that the form of the clustering in the hubble volume mocks is realistic at the scales of interest . along with this",
    "we show a @xmath6cdm linear prediction using the best - fit wmap-2dfgrs parameters , the hubble volume input parameter prediction as before , and an scdm prediction . to these models",
    "we apply a linear bias of @xmath49=1.1 @xcite .    using this bias prescription ,",
    "the @xmath6cdm linear predictions derived from the wmap-2dfgrs best - fit and the hubble volume mock input parameters are in excellent agreement with the 2mass angular power spectrum to @xmath5240 .",
    "the scdm prediction gives a very poor fit to the 2mass angular power spectrum , indicating that this analysis may provide useful constraints on the cosmology ; this is examined by @xcite .",
    "while there appears to be an excess of power in the 2mass galaxy angular power spectrum compared with the @xmath6cdm hubble volume mocks at large scales , it is not enough to account for the local hole described in sections 2 and 3 : we use a bessel function transform to convert the angular power spectrum to the 2-point angular correlation function ; the result is in good agreement with the 2mass correlation function determined by @xcite , and so the implied significance of the local hole described in sections 2 and 3 remains high .",
    "therefore , somewhat paradoxically , the local hole in the 2mass data in the apm survey area does not seem to be explained by the angular power spectrum or 2-point correlation functions from the same 2mass data ; possible explanations are discussed below .",
    "in order to investigate the number count deficiency in the sgc detected by the apm survey , we have used models guided by the 2dfgrs @xmath2 as predictions of the @xmath4-band and @xmath3-band number counts .",
    "first , we wanted to verify the usefulness of this technique as a probe of the underlying large - scale structure and so compared the 2dfgrs @xmath2 models to the corresponding number counts extracted from the 2dfgrs parent catalogue and the 2mass full release catalogue for the 2dfgrs fields . in both passbands and both the northern and southern declination fields , the predicted counts agree very well with the observed counts .    using this technique",
    ", we then probed the galaxy distribution over the much larger apm field of @xmath04000 deg@xmath1 .",
    "the 2mass counts and the apm counts ( corrected for a zero - point offset of 0.31 magnitudes found with respect to recent @xmath4-band ccd photometry @xcite ) are in good agreement , and suprisingly , agree well with the 2dfgrs southern @xmath2 model .",
    "this suggests that a similar deficiency to the 2dfgrs southern distribution exists over the entire apm field ; that would be a @xmath030% deficiency to @xmath50.1 over @xmath04000 deg@xmath1 .    this deficiency , while less extreme than the galaxy distribution implied by the original apm counts , poses a significant problem for our present understanding of clustering and possibly a @xmath6cdm cosmology .",
    "we calculate the significance of such an underdensity , considering several possible forms for the real - space correlation function . in all cases",
    "the apm deficiency as described above represents a 3@xmath34 fluctuation .",
    "in particular we found that the apm deficiency represents a 4.6@xmath34 fluctuation using the @xmath6cdm hubble volume mock correlation function .",
    "the deficiency in the apm survey area therefore suggests an excess of power which is incompatible with the 2dfgrs or hubble volume mock @xmath49=1 @xmath6cdm angular correlation functions ; only an extension of the small scale 2dfgrs @xmath29=-1.67 power law correlation function would explain the hole . in order to investigate this discrepancy and probe the galaxy clustering at extremely large scales , we finally determined the angular power spectrum of 2mass @xmath47 , @xmath53 galaxies and also 27 mock 2mass catalogues constructed from the @xmath6cdm hubble volume mock catalogue .",
    "there is a discrepancy between the two in the range @xmath54 , in that the hubble volume power spectrum slope is significantly flatter .",
    "inclusion of linear bias will therefore not improve this agreement .",
    "however , we find that the increased power at large scales is still not large enough to explain the deficiency in the apm survey area . in the more restricted range of @xmath55 , where the effect of non - linear clustering and any scale dependent bias may be assumed to be less , @xmath6cdm models can give a good fit to the 2mass power spectrum and the constraints on the cosmological parameters from fitting these data are explored by @xcite .    in conclusion ,",
    "the issue of the large local hole has yet to be resolved .",
    "the new data from the 2dfgrs and 2mass catalogues along with the large @xmath4-band ccd survey of @xcite indicates that the low apm counts may be due partly to a zero - point error in the bright apm photometry and partly to a large deficiency in the galaxy distribution stretching to @xmath14=0.1 .",
    "the angular power spectrum of the 2mass galaxies , although steeper than the hubble volume @xmath6cdm mock catalogue , still has too shallow a slope to explain the hole .",
    "this may not be too surprising since the depth of 2mass is comparable to the previous @xmath1317 surveys in the apm survey area which only sampled the deficient volume with @xmath56 .",
    "so it is still possible that even the entire 2mass volume may still not represent a fair sample of the universe .",
    "another possible explanation is that the clustering is non - gaussian on the scales of 150 - 300@xmath57mpc .",
    "although this seems unlikely , there have recently been tentative reports of non - gaussianity detected on even larger scales in the wmap cmb data ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the final possibility is that the agreement between the @xmath4 and @xmath3-band counts predicted on the basis of 2dfgrs @xmath2 models and the data is coincidental and this has caused us to overestimate the angular size of the deficiency in the apm survey area . a new @xmath58 galaxy redshift survey over the whole 4000deg@xmath1 apm survey area would help resolve this question .",
