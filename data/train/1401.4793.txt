    "directed compact percolation , introduced by domany and kinzel  @xcite , is an exactly solvable model .",
    "the results for various cluster properties in the _ bulk _ case , away from any confining walls , are given in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the addition of a _ wet _ wall to the model was considered in  @xcite , and it was found that the critical exponents for the cluster properties follow that of the bulk case . however , the addition of a _ dry _ or non - conducting wall , considered in  @xcite , produced different exponents to the wet and bulk cases .",
    "this led to the consideration of a _ damp _ wall , introduced in  @xcite , which interpolates between the wet and dry cases .",
    "it was found that the critical behaviour followed the dry case , and the calculation of several cluster properties  @xcite was possible using the same methods as near a dry wall .",
    "this paper extends the work on directed compact percolation near a damp wall , to consider the mean size of finite clusters in the low - density region . in previous work on the bulk",
    "@xcite , wet  @xcite and low - density dry  @xcite cases , the mean size was found by solving the associated recurrence relations .",
    "for other cluster properties near a damp wall  percolation probability  @xcite , mean length  @xcite and mean number of contacts  @xcite  the same methods yielded a solution , albeit in a more complicated form , exhibiting the same critical behaviour as the dry case .",
    "so we proceed with the mean size near a damp wall , guided at first by the work near a dry wall in  @xcite .    however , we find that the recurrence relations for the mean size can not be solved using the same methods as for the dry wall case , and it can be shown that they do not have the same form of solution .",
    "this was supported by a functional equations approach , which led us to consider alternative methods of analysing the mean size .",
    "the series expansion for the special case @xmath4 , which tends to a wet wall near the critical point , can be successfully analysed using the guess.m package @xcite for mathematica ; we find that the mean size in this case satisfies a second order inhomogeneous differential equation .",
    "we then applied a more involved series analysis method @xcite , which makes use of modular arithmetic to more efficiently find differential equations satisfied by the series for the mean size . in the general case @xmath6 with @xmath7 rational the series is a solution to a homogeneous ode of order 4 and degree 33 , with the exception of the special cases corresponding to simpler models .",
    "analysis of the ode shows that the critical exponent for the mean size in the general damp case ( @xmath8 ) is @xmath9 and the physical critical point occurs at @xmath10 , in line with the dry result .",
    "the model of compact percolation is defined on a directed square lattice , the sites of which are the points in the ( @xmath11)-plane with integer co - ordinates such that @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is even .",
    "the damp wall is represented by the sites at @xmath14 , where each wall site is ` wet ' ( occupied ) with probability @xmath1 and ` dry ' ( unoccupied ) with probability @xmath15 , while sites in the bulk ( away from the wall ) are wet with probability @xmath0 and dry with probability @xmath16 .",
    "we begin with an initial _ seed _ of @xmath17 contiguous sites at @xmath18 , the midpoint of which is located @xmath19 units above the wall .",
    "the seed is placed with certainty , and a cluster is grown from this column by column according to the rules of directed compact percolation . the new site @xmath20 becomes wet with certainty if both the previous sites @xmath21 are wet .",
    "if only one of the previous sites is wet the new site is wet with probability @xmath0 and dry with probability @xmath16 .",
    "when both previous sites are dry the new site is dry with certainty , thus ensuring that the cluster remains compact .     with midpoint located @xmath22 units from the wall at @xmath14 .",
    "the probability of this cluster being grown from the seed can be calculated a column at a time , as @xmath23 . ]",
    "the size of a cluster is defined as the number of wet sites in the cluster , including the seed .",
    "we will also consider adjacent wet sites on the wall to form part of the cluster .",
    "we define @xmath24 to be the mean size of finite clusters grown from a seed of width @xmath17 with midpoint @xmath19 units from the wall , and @xmath25 to be the unnormalized mean size , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the probability that a finite cluster is grown from this seed .",
    "we note that in the _ low - density _ region , below the critical point @xmath28 , we have @xmath29 and hence @xmath30 .    the critical exponent for the mean size , @xmath31 , describes the behaviour near the critical point . as @xmath32",
    "we have @xmath33 we briefly review the results found for the mean size in other cases of directed compact percolation , which will guide our work on the damp wall case .",
    "the mean size of finite clusters in the bulk case , found in @xcite by solving the associated recurrence relations , is @xmath34 and so the critical exponent @xmath35 .",
    "the mean cluster size near a wet wall was found in @xcite , again by solving the associated recurrence relations .",
    "this was done for clusters grown from a seed of width @xmath17 adjacent to the wet wall ( the cluster then remaining attached due to the attractive wet wall ) with the result @xmath36 this exhibits the same critical behaviour as the bulk case with @xmath37 .    note that the work in @xcite does not include adjacent wall sites in a cluster s size , unlike the general damp model .",
    "this effectively shifts the location of the wall by one unit , and so we consider the result in ( [ swet ] ) to apply to seeds beginning _ on _ the wall .",
    "we consider in particular the @xmath38 case , @xmath39      in @xcite , the mean size of clusters near a dry wall was calculated in the low - density region by solving the recurrence relations .",
    "the result for the mean size of a cluster grown from a seed of width @xmath17 , with midpoint @xmath19 units from a dry wall , is @xmath40 it can be seen from ( [ sdrybulk ] ) that in the bulk limit , as @xmath41 , the dry case tends to the bulk result , and so in the bulk limit this expression has exponent @xmath5 .",
    "however , everywhere else the exponent is @xmath42 , as a factor of @xmath43 cancels in the second term of ( [ sdrybulk2 ] ) for any integer value of @xmath19 , and hence the dry wall mean size exhibits different critical behaviour to the bulk and wet cases .",
    "we focus in particular on the case where a seed of a single site is situated adjacent to the wall , and we define @xmath44 to be the mean size in this situation , @xmath45",
    "we set up the recurrence relations by considering the possibilities after one time step for a seed of width @xmath17 , with midpoint @xmath19 units from the wall , for each of three seed classifications : seeds located on , adjacent to , and away from the wall .      in the bulk",
    "the cluster is unaffected by the wall .",
    "the corresponding recurrence for the mean size will therefore be the same as in the dry wall case @xcite , @xmath47 this encompasses the four different possible configurations of the cluster in the column following the seed as illustrated in figure [ gen_rec_size ] .",
    "however , we note that for a seed consisting of a single site , that is @xmath38 , the term with coefficient @xmath48 in ( [ sbulk ] ) would not be present , as this would correspond to the cluster terminating .",
    "so we consider this case separately and impose the condition @xmath49    .",
    "the different configurations possible for a cluster beginning with a seed of width @xmath17 , with midpoint @xmath19 units from the wall , and their probabilities for each seed classification , shown through a sample cluster of initial seed width @xmath50 . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     thus , as expected , the mean size follows the pattern of the percolation probability , mean length and mean number of contacts , in that its critical behaviour is the same as the corresponding dry wall result .",
    "we have the dry wall exponent @xmath51 for @xmath52 , and the wet exponent @xmath5 only at the wet singularity @xmath3 , and at the wet - like case of @xmath4 .",
