    "high - precision parameter estimation is fundamental throughout science . quite generally , a number of probe particles are prepared , then subjected to an evolution which depends on the quantity of interest , and finally measured . from the measurement results an estimate",
    "is then extracted . when the particles are classically correlated and non - interacting , as a consequence of the central limit theorem , the mean - squared error of the estimate decreases as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the number of particles ( probe size ) .",
    "this best scaling achievable with a classical probe is known as the _ standard quantum limit _ ( sql ) @xcite .",
    "quantum metrology aims to improve estimation by exploiting quantum correlations in the probe .    in an ideal",
    "setting without noise , it is well known that quantum resources allow for a quadratic improvement in precision over the sql  @xcite ; i.e , the mean - squared error of the estimate after a sufficient number of experimental repetitions can scale as @xmath2 , yielding the the so - called _ heisenberg limit_. realistic evolution , however , always involves noise of some form , and although quantum metrology has been demonstrated experimentally , e.g. , for atomic magnetometry @xcite , spectroscopy @xcite , and clocks @xcite , there is currently much effort to determine exactly when , and by how much , quantum resources allow estimation to be improved in the presence of decoherence @xcite . it is known that for most types of uncorrelated noise ( acting independently on each probe particle ) the asymptotic scaling is constrained to be sql - like @xcite .",
    "specifically , when estimating a parameter @xmath3 , the mean - squared error obeys @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the number of repetitions and @xmath6 is a constant which depends on the evolution . if the evolution , which each probe particle undergoes , is independent of @xmath1 , the scaling is constrained to be sql - like .",
    "however , for frequency estimation this is not necessarily the case . in frequency estimation scenarios , such as those of atomic magnetometry @xcite , spectroscopy @xcite , and clocks",
    "@xcite , there are two relevant resources , the total number of probe particles @xmath1 and the total time @xmath7 available for the experiment @xcite .",
    "the experimenter is free to choose the interrogation time @xmath8 and , in particular , @xmath9 may be adapted to @xmath1 . in this case , the time over which unitary evolution and decoherence act is different for each @xmath1 and thus the evolution is not independent of @xmath1 .",
    "schematically , the no - go results for noisy evolution in this case become @xmath10 with @xmath11 . thus , if for some optimal choice of @xmath12 the coefficient @xmath13 decreases with @xmath1 , although the no - go results may hold for any fixed evolution time , the bound does not imply sql - like scaling .",
    "note that the bound eq .",
    "( [ eq.sqllike ] ) is always achievable in the many - repetitions limit @xmath14 @xcite , which corresponds to @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "although without noise it is optimal to take @xmath9 as large as possible , i.e , @xmath16 , for any noisy evolution the optimal @xmath9 becomes finite because of noise dominating at large times .",
    "so the many - repetitions regime can always be ensured by considering sufficiently large @xmath7 @xcite .    in frequency estimation scenarios , for the asymptotic",
    "scaling to be superclassical , @xmath13 must vanish as @xmath17 , which is only possible if the evolution is such that decoherence can be neglected at short time scales , and the no - go theorems then do not apply @xcite .",
    "this is also necessary for error - correction techniques , which utilise ancillary particles not sensing the parameter @xcite or employ correcting pulses during the evolution @xcite , to surpass the sql @xcite . without such additional resources",
    " considering just interrogation - time optimisation  the possibility of superclassical scaling has been demonstrated for non - markovian @xcite evolutions ( for which the effective decoherence strength vanishes as @xmath18 ) , as well as for dephasing directed along a direction perpendicular to the unitary evolution @xcite . in the latter case , it was shown that an optimal variance scaling of @xmath19 can be obtained by choosing @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "this result was based on numerical analysis of the _ quantum fisher information _ ( qfi ) @xcite and was shown to be saturable by greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) states @xcite .",
    "however , ghz states of many particles are not easily generated in practice , and the fisher information approach does not explicitly provide the required measurements .",
    "thus , the question of whether the scaling is achievable in practically implementable metrology was left open .    in this paper , we argue that the transversal - noise model applies to atomic magnetometry , in particular the experimental setting of @xcite , and study the quantum advantage attainable with use of _ one axis - twisted spin - squeezed states _ ( oatsss )",

    "we further consider the case of noise which is not perfectly transversal and find that , although the asymptotic precision scaling is then again sql - like , the precision may be substantially enhanced by optimising the geometry .",
    "as the previous results @xcite were based on numerics , we also provide an analytical proof of the scaling for ghz states in appendix  [ app.ghz_states ] .",

    "scenario ( b ) is similar , but the state is initially perpendicular to @xmath46 . in the rotating frame , it is squeezed in @xmath51 and @xmath52 is measured .",
    "the dominant noise in both cases comes from individual atomic motion causing variations in the effective magnetic field and hence the energy splitting .",
    "this results in uncorrelated dephasing noise in the direction of @xmath46 ; the impact on the collective spin is schematically illustrated by the inner prolate spheroids .",

    "the relevant magnetometer consists of a vapour of caesium atoms , which is subject to a strong external dc magnetic field @xmath46 and used to sense a weak radio - frequency field @xmath45 perpendicular to @xmath46 ( note that in ref .",
    "@xcite two separate ensembles were used ; this is not important for the present argument ) .",
    "the atoms are optically pumped into an extreme magnetic sublevel and may be treated as effective two - level systems with an energy splitting determined by @xmath46 . with @xmath53 ,",
    "the dominant noise is due to small variations in the dc magnetic field seen by different atoms ( e.g. , due to field inhomogeneities and atomic motion ) , which leads to fluctuations of the individual energy splittings .",
    "this corresponds to a dephasing noise which acts on each atom independently and is characterised by the spin - decoherence time @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "as the experiment is conducted at a time scale much shorter than the ones of spontaneous emission and @xmath46-field fluctuations , other noise sources are suppressed .",
    "in particular , the spin - relaxation time @xmath55 can be taken infinite ( see appendix  [ app.master ] for discussion ) and collective noise can be neglected .",
    "the larmor frequency of the strong field @xmath46 is matched to the frequency of the weak field @xmath45 , and it is then convenient to describe the system in a _ rotating frame _ ( rf ) . if @xmath56 is the state of a single atom in the non - rotating frame and @xmath46 is directed along the @xmath51 axis ( see fig .",

    "we show that in scenario ( b ) , for one axis - twisted spin - squeezed states , a superclassical scaling @xmath67 of the mean - squared error can be maintained , thus demonstrating that a scaling quantum advantage is possible with feasible states and measurements . at the same time , we find that in the case of ( a ) the quantum advantage is limited by a constant , which matches the bound for parallel dephasing @xcite . as a consequence , for an atomic ensemble size and parameters matching the experiment ref .",
    "@xcite , ( b ) may considerably outperform ( a ) .",
    "as an aside , we note that when the true value of the estimated parameter is zero , the bound of eq .",

    "this does not mean that the precision is unbounded , but indicates that the bound gives no information in such a limit .",
    "one may then speculate whether the scaling can be further improved if @xmath3 can be made arbitrarily small in an adaptive manner .",
    "we discuss this issue in appendix  [ app.omega_zero ] .",

    "<S> under ideal conditions , quantum metrology promises a precision gain over classical techniques scaling quadratically with the number of probe particles . at the same time , no - go results have shown that generic , uncorrelated noise limits the quantum advantage to a constant factor . in frequency estimation scenarios , </S>",
    "<S> however , there are exceptions to this rule and , in particular , it has been found that transversal dephasing does allow for a scaling quantum advantage . </S>",
    "<S> yet , it has remained unclear whether such exemptions can be exploited in practical scenarios . here , </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the transversal - noise model applies to the setting of recent magnetometry experiments and show that a scaling advantage can be maintained with one - axis - twisted spin - squeezed states and ramsey - interferometry - like measurements . </S>",
    "<S> this is achieved by exploiting the geometry of the setup that , as we demonstrate , has a strong influence on the achievable quantum enhancement for experimentally feasible parameter settings . </S>",
    "<S> when , in addition to the dominant transversal noise , other sources of decoherence are present , the quantum advantage is asymptotically bounded by a constant , but this constant may be significantly improved by exploring the geometry . </S>"
