    "although at his appearence the standard form of cdm was very successful in describing the observed structures in the universe ( galaxy clustering statistics , structure formation epochs , peculiar velocity flows ) ( peebles , 1982 ; blumenthal et al .",

    "; efstathiou 1990 ) recent measurements have shown several deficiencies of the model , at least if any bias of the distribution of galaxies relative to the mass is constant with scale .",
    "some of the most difficult problems to reconcile with the theory are the strong clustering of rich clusters of galaxies , @xmath0 @xmath1 , far in excess of cdm  predictions ( bahcall & soneira 1983 ) , the x - ray temperature distribution function of clusters , over - producing the observed cluster abundances ( bartlett & silk 1993 ) , the conflict between the normalisation of the spectrum of the perturbation which is required by different types of observations . +",
    "alternative models with more large - scale power than cdm have been introduced in order to solve the latter problem .",
    "several authors ( peebles 1984 ; efstathiou , sutherland & maddox 1990 , turner 1991 , white , efstathiou & frenk 1993 ) have lowered the matter density under the critical value ( @xmath2 ) and they have added a cosmological constant in order to retain a flat universe ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the spectrum of the matter density is specified by the transfer function , but its shape is affected because of the fact that the epoch of matter - radiation equality ( characterized by a red - shift @xmath4 ) is earlier , @xmath5 being increased by a factor @xmath6 . around the epoch @xmath7 , where @xmath8 , the growth of the density contrast slows down and ceases after @xmath7 . as a consequence the normalisation of the transfer function begins to fall , even if its shape is retained .",
    "mixed dark matter models ( mdm ) ( bond et al .",
    "1980 ; shafi & stecker 1984 ; valdarnini & bonometto 1985 ; schaefer et al . 1989 ; holtzman 1989 ; schaefer 1991 ; shaefer and shafi 1993 ; holtzman & primack 1993 ) increase the large - scale power because neutrinos free - streaming damps the power on small scales . alternatively changing the primeval spectrum several problems of cdm are solved ( cen et al . 1992 ) .",
    "finally it is possible to assume that the threshold for galaxy formation is not spatially invariant but weakly modulated ( @xmath9 on scales @xmath10 ) by large scale density fluctuations , with the result that the clustering on large - scale is significantly increased ( bower et al .",
    "+ here we propose a different solution to several of the cdm model problems connected to the non - radial motions developing during the protocluster evolution .",
    "+ it has long been speculated that angular momentum could have a fundamental role in determining the fate of collapsing proto - structures and several models have been proposed in which the galaxy type can be correlated with the angular momentum per unit mass of the structure itself ( faber 1982 ; kashlinsky 1982 ; fall 1983 ) .",
    "some authors ( see barrow & silk 1981 , szalay & silk 1983 and peebles 1990 ) have proposed that non - radial motions would be expected within a developing proto - cluster due to the tidal interaction of the irregular mass distribution around them , typical of hierarchical clustering models , with the neighboring proto - clusters .",
    "the kinetic energy of this non - radial motions opposes the collapse of the proto - cluster , enabling the same to reach statistical equilibrium before the final collapse ( the so called previrialization conjecture by davis & peebles 1977 , peebles 1990 ) .",
    "this effect may prevent the increase of the slope of the mass autocorrelation function at separations given by @xmath11 , expected in the scaling solution for the growth of @xmath12 but not observed in the galaxy two - point correlation function .",
    "the role of non - radial motions has been pointed by several authors ( see davis & peebles 1983 , gorski 1988 , groth et al . 1989 , mo et al .",
    "1993 , weygaert & babul 1994 , marzke et al .",
    "1995 and antonuccio & colafrancesco 1997 ) .",
    "antonuccio & colafrancesco derived the conditional probability distribution @xmath13 of the peculiar velocity around a peak of a gaussian density field and used the moments of the velocity distribution to study the velocity dispersion around the peak .",
    "they showed that regions of the proto - clusters at radii , @xmath14 , greater than the filtering length , @xmath15 , contain predominantly non - radial motions .",
    "+ non - radial motions change the energetics of the collapse model by introducing another potential energy term .",
    "in other words one expects that non - radial motions change the characteristics of the collapse and in particular the _ turn around _ epoch , @xmath16 , and consequently the critical threshold , @xmath17 , for collapse .",
    "one expects that non - radial motions produce firstly a change in the turn around epoch , secondly a new functional form for @xmath17 , thirdly a change of the mass function calculable with the press - schechter ( 1974 ) formula and consequently of the predicted x - ray temperature distribution function of clusters and finally a modification of the two - point correlation function .",
    "moreover this study of the role of non - radial motions in the collapse of density perturbations can help us to give a deeper insight on the so called problem of biasing . as pointed out by davis et al .",
    "( 1985 ) , unbiased cdm suffers of several problems : pairwise velocity dispersion larger than the observed one , galaxy correlation function steeper than observed ( see liddle & lyth 1993 and strauss & willick 1995 ) .",
    "the remedy to these problems is the concept of biasing ( kaiser 1984 ) , i.e. that galaxies are more strongly clustered than the mass distribution from which they originated .",
    "the physical origin of such biasing is not yet clear even if several mechanisms have been proposed ( rees 1985 ; dekel & rees 1987 ; dekel & silk 1986 ; carlberg 1991 ; cen & ostriker 1992 ; bower et al .",
    "1993 ; silk & wyse 1993 ) .",
    "recently colafrancesco , antonuccio & del popolo ( 1995 , hereafter cad ) have shown that dynamical friction delays the collapse of low-@xmath18 peaks inducing a bias of dynamical nature .",
    "because of dynamical friction under - dense regions in clusters ( the clusters outskirts ) accrete less mass with respect to that accreted in absence of this dissipative effect and as a consequence over - dense regions are biased toward higher mass ( antonuccio & colafrancesco 1995 and del popolo & gambera , 1996 ) .",
    "non - radial motions acts in a similar fashion to dynamical friction : they delay the shell collapse consequently inducing a dynamical bias similar to that produced by dynamical friction .",
    "this dynamical bias can be evaluated defining a selection function similar to that given in cad and using bardeen , bond , szalay and kaiser ( 1986 , hereafter bbks ) prescriptions .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following : in  2 we obtain the total specific angular momentum acquired during expansion by a proto - cluster . in  3 we find the effect of non - radial motion on the critical density threshold , @xmath19 . in ",
    "4 we derive a selection function for the peaks giving rise to proto - structures while in  5 we calculate some values for the bias parameter , using the selection function derived , on three relevant filtering scales . in  6 we find the effects of non - radial motions on the x - ray temperature distribution function and then we compare this prevision to the x - ray observed data . in   7 we study how non - radial motions influence the cluters two - points correlation function .",
    " 8 is devoted to conclusions and discussions .",
    "the explanation of galaxies spins gain through tidal torques was pioneered by hoyle ( 1949 ) in the context of a collapsing protogalaxy .",
    "peebles ( 1969 ) considered the process in the context of an expanding world model showing that the angular momentum gained by the matter in a random comoving _ eulerian _",
    "sphere grows at second order in proportion to @xmath20 ( in a einstein - de sitter universe ) , since when the proto - galaxy is still a small perturbation , while in the nonlinear stage the growth rate of an oblate homogeneous spheroid decreases with time as @xmath21 .",
    "more recent analytic computations ( white 1984 , hoffman 1986 , ryden 1988 ) and numerical simulations ( barnes & efstathiou 1987 ) have re - investigated the role of tidal torques in originating galaxies angular momentum .",
    "in particular white ( 1984 ) expanded an analysis by doroshkevich ( 1970 ) showing that the angular momentum of galaxies grows to first order in proportion to @xmath22 and that the result of peebles is a consequence of the spherical symmetry imposed in the model .",
    "white showed that the angular momentum of a lagrangian sphere does not grow either in first or in second order while the angular momentum of a non - spherical volume grows to first order in agreement to doroshkevich s result .",
    "hoffman ( 1986 ) has been much more involved in the analysis of the correlation of the growth of angular momentum with the density perturbation @xmath23 .",
    "he found an angular momentum - density anticorrelation : high density peaks acquire less angular momentum than low density peaks .",
    "one way to study the variation of angular momentum with radius in a galaxy is that followed by ryden ( 1988 ) . in this approach",
    "the protogalaxy is divided into a series of mass shells and the torque on each mass shell is computed separately .",
    "the density profile of each proto - structure is approximated by the superposition of a spherical profile , @xmath24 , and a random cdm distribution , @xmath25 , which provides the quadrupole moment of the protogalaxy . to first order ,",
    "the initial density can be represented by : @xmath26 \\left [ 1+\\varepsilon ( { \\bf   r})\\right]\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the background density and @xmath28 is given by : @xmath29 being @xmath30 the power spectrum , while the density profile is ( ryden & gunn 1987 ) : @xmath31 \\cdot \\xi ( 0)^{-1/2 }   \\label{eq : dens}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the height of a density peak , @xmath33 is the two points correlation function , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are two spectral parameters ( bbks , eq . 4.6a , 4.6d ) while @xmath36 is a function given in bbks ( eq .",

    "we have obtained the rms torque , @xmath52 , on a mass shell using eq .",
    "( [ eq : tau ] ) then we obtained the total specific angular momentum , @xmath53 , acquired during expansion integrating the torque over time ( ryden 1988 eq .",
    "35 ) : @xmath54 where @xmath55 @xmath56 and @xmath57 are respectively the torque , the mean overdensity and the mean overdensity within a sphere of radius @xmath58 at the current epoch @xmath59 .",
    "the functions @xmath60 , @xmath61 are given by ryden ( 1988 - eq .",

    "1 we show the variation of @xmath53 with the distance @xmath58 for three values of the peak height @xmath32 . the rms specific angular momentum , @xmath53 , increases with distance @xmath58 while peaks of greater @xmath32 acquire less angular momentum via tidal torques .",
    "this is the angular momentum - density anticorrelation showed by hoffman ( 1986 ) .",
    "this effect arises because the angular momentum is proportional to the gain at turn around time , @xmath16 , which in turn is proportional to @xmath68 .",
    "one of the consequences of the angular momentum acquisition by a mass shell of a proto - cluster is the delay of the collapse of the proto - structure . as shown by barrow & silk ( 1981 ) and szalay & silk ( 1983 ) the gravitational interaction of the irregular mass distribution of proto - cluster with the neighbouring proto - structures gives rise to non - radial motions , within the protocluster , which are expected to slow the rate of growth of the density contrast and to delay or suppress collapse . according to davis & peebles ( 1977 ) the kinetic energy of the resulting non - radial motions at the epoch of maximum expansion increases so much to oppose the recollapse of the proto - structure .",
    "numerical n - body simulations by villumsen & davis ( 1986 ) showed a tendency to reproduce this so called previrialization effect . in a more recent paper by peebles ( 1990 ) the slowing of the growth of density fluctuations and the collapse suppression",
    "after the epoch of the maximum expansion were re - obtained using a numerical action method . in the central regions of a density peak ( @xmath69 )",
    "the velocity dispersion attain nearly the same value ( antonuccio & colafrancesco 1997 ) while at larger radii ( @xmath70 ) the radial component is lower than the tangential component .",
    "this means that motions in the outer regions are predominantly non - radial and in these regions the fate of the infalling material could be influenced by the amount of tangential velocity relative to the radial one .",
    "this can be shown writing the equation of motion of a spherically symmetric mass distribution with density @xmath71 : @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are , respectively , the mean radial and tangential streaming velocity .",
    "( [ eq : peeb ] ) shows that high tangential velocity dispersion @xmath75 may alter the infall pattern . the expected delay in the collapse of a perturbation",
    "may be calculated using a model due to peebles ( peebles 1993 ) .",

    "we may find the angular momentum , @xmath111 , needed to calculate @xmath19 using eq.([eq : ang ] ) .",

    "1993 ) , structures form more easily in over - populated regions .",
    "according to biased galaxy formation theory the sites of formation of structures of mass @xmath122 must be identified with the maxima of the density peak smoothed over a scale @xmath123 ( @xmath124 ) . a necessary condition for a perturbation to form a structure is that it goes nonlinear and that the linearly extrapolated density contrast reaches the value @xmath125 or equivalently that the threshold criterion @xmath126 is satisfied , being @xmath127 the variance of the density field smoothed on scale @xmath123 .",
    "when these condition are satisfied the matter in a shell around a peak falls in toward the cluster center and virializes . in this scenario",
    "only rare high @xmath32 peaks form bright objects while low @xmath32 peaks ( @xmath128 ) form under - luminous objects .",
    "the kind of objects that form from nonlinear structures depends on the details of the collapse",
    ". moreover if structures form only at peaks in the mass distribution they will be more strongly clustered than the mass .",
    "several feedback mechanisms has been proposed to explain this segregation effect ( rees 1985 , dekel & rees 1987 ) .",
    "even if these feedback mechanisms work one can not expect they have effect instantaneously , so the threshold for structure formation can not be sharp ( bbks ) . to take into account this effect bbks introduced a threshold or selection function , @xmath129 .",
    "the selection function , @xmath129 , gives the probability that a density peak forms an object , while the threshold level , @xmath130 , is defined so that the probability that a peak form an object is 1/2 when @xmath131 .",

    "the ic gas temperature - mass relation is easily obtained by applying the virial theorem and for a flat matter - dominated universe we have that ( kaiser 1986 , evrard 1990 ) : @xmath201 the assumptions of perfect hydrostatic equilibrium and virialization are in reality non completely satisfied by clusters . clusters profile may have departure from isothermality , with sligth temperature gradients throughout the cluster .",

    "the introduction of non - radial motions gives a more careful description of the experimental data .",
    "as we have seen the x - ray temperature distribution function obtained taking account of non - radial motions is different from that of a pure cdm model for two reasons : + 1 ) the variation of the threshold , @xmath19 , with mass , @xmath102 .",
    "this is due to the changement of the energetics of the collapse model produced by the introduction of another potential energy term ( @xmath218 ) in @xmath219 ; + 2 ) the modification of the t - m relation produced by the alteration of the partition of energy in virial equilibrium . + for values of mass @xmath220 the difference between the two theoretical lines in fig .",
    "4 is due to the first factor for a @xmath221 and this value increases with increasing mass .",
    "the uncertainty in our model fundamentally comes from the uncertainty of the t - m relation whose value has been previously quoted .",
    "+ one of the objection to the result of this paper may that the effect described has not been seen in some hydrodynamic simulations ( evrard & crone 1992 ) .",
    "the answer to this objection is that our model is fundamentally based on the previrialization conjecture ( davis & peebles 1977 ; peebles 1990 ) , ( supposing that initial asphericities and tidal interactions between neighboring density fluctuations induce significant non - radial motions , which oppose the collapse ) and while some n - body simulations ( villumsen & davis 1986 ; peebles 1990 ) appear to reproduce this effect , other simulations ( for example evrard & crone 1992 ) do not . an answer to this controversy was given by ( lokas et al .",
    "the problem is connected to spectral index @xmath222 used in the simulations .",
    "the `` previrialization '' is seen only for @xmath223 . while peebles ( 1990 ) used simulations with @xmath224 , evrard & crone ( 1992 ) assumed @xmath225 . excluding this particular case generally the ensemble properties of clusters like their optical and x - ray luminosity functions , or their velocity and temperature distribution functions , are difficult to address directly in numerical simulations",
    "because the size of the box must be very large in order to contain a sufficient number of clusters ; an then analytical approach remains an effective alternative .",
    "supposing that the universe at some early epoch can be described using the same assumptions of the previous section the probability @xmath226 per unit volume per unit masses of finding two collapsed objects of mass @xmath227 and @xmath228 separated by a distance @xmath58 is obtained by integrating both variables of the bivariant gaussian distribution in @xmath229 and @xmath230 , with correlation @xmath231 from @xmath121 to infinity and then taking the partial derivatives with respect to both masses . the correlation function for collapsed objects is simply obtained from : @xmath232 which for equal masses and weak correlations @xmath233 is ( kashlinsky 1987 ) : @xmath234\\xi _ \\rho ( r )   \\label{eq : coo}\\ ] ] where @xmath235 is the variance of the mass fluctuation and @xmath236 is the correlation function of the matter density distribution when the density fluctuations had small amplitude .",
    "( [ eq : coo ] ) shows that the correlation of collapsed objects may be enhanced relative to that of the underlying mass fluctuations .",
    "this condition is usually described by the bias parameter @xmath198 which is sometimes defined as @xmath237^{1/2}=\\delta_{c}/\\sigma_{\\rho}(m)$ ] .",
    "+ studies of clustering on scales @xmath238 have shown that the correlation function given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : coo ] ) is different from that obtained from observations .",
    "the most compelling data are angular correlation functions for the apm survey .",
    "these decline much less rapidly on large scales than the cdm prediction ( maddox et al .",
    "1990 ) . as discussed in the introduction",
    "there are two ways to reduce the quoted discrepance : either with a modification of cdm theory involving the physics of early universe , or with a modification of cdm theory involving the physics of galaxy formation .",
    "this discrepancy can be reduced , similarly to the problem of over - abundance of clusters , taking into account the non - radial motions that originate when a cluster reaches the non - linear regime .",
    "in fact , the calculation of the correlation function requires the specification of @xmath121 which is changed by non - radial motions and whose new value is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : ma7 ] ) . in fig .",
    "5 the correlation function derived taking into account non - radial motions is compared both with the two - point correlation function obtained by sutherland & efstathiou ( 1991 ) from the analysis of huchra s et al .",
    "( 1990 ) deep redshift survey as discussed in geller & huchra ( 1988 ) and with the data points for the apm clusters computed by efstathiou et al .",
    "( 1992 ) .",
    "as shown the discrepancy between pure cdm previsions and experimental data is remarkable .",
    "the cdm model seems to have trouble in re - producing the behaviour of the data .",
    "in fact , the predicted two - point cluster function is too steep and rapidly goes nearly to zero for @xmath239 , while the data show no significant anticorrelation up to @xmath240 ( see borgani 1990 ) .",
    "the introduction of non - radial motions gives a more accurate description of the experimental data .",
    "the result obtained is in agreement with that of borgani ( 1990 ) who studied the effect of particular thresholds ( erfc - threshold and gaussian - threshold ) on the correlation properties of clusters of galaxies .",
    "the fundamental difference between our and borgani s approach is that our threshold function is physically motivated : it is simply obtained from the assumptions of a gaussian density field and taking account of non - radial motions .",
    "borgani s threshold functions ( erfc and gaussian threshold ) are ad - hoc introduced in order to reduce the discrepancy between the observed and the cdm predicted two points correlation functions of clusters of galaxies .",
    "the connection with the quoted non - sphericity effects , even if logical and in agreement with our results , is only a posteriori tentative to justify the choice made .",
    "in these last years many authors have shown the existence of a strong discrepancy between the observed properties of clusters of galaxies and that predicted by the cdm model . to reduce this discrepancy",
    "several alternative models have been introduced but no model has considered the role of the non - radial motions . here",
    "we have shown how non - radial motions may reduce some of these discrepancies : namely + a ) the discrepancy between the observed @xmath241 of cluster of galaxies and that predicted by cdm model ; + b ) the discrepancy between the measured x - ray temperature distribution function and that predicted by the cdm model .",
    "+ to this aim we calculated the variation of the treshold parameter , @xmath156 , as a function of the mass @xmath102 , produced by the presence of non - radial motions in the outskirts of clusters of galaxies .",
    "we used @xmath242 to calculate the two - point correlation of clusters of galaxies and the x - ray temperature distribution function .",
    "we compared the prediction for the two point correlation function with that obtained by sutherland & efstathiou ( 1991 ) from the analysis of huchra s et al .",

    "5 ) show how the non - radial motions change both the correlation length of the correlation function , making it less steep than that obtained from a pure cdm model where the non - radial motions are not considered , and the x - ray temperature function . in both cases",
    "our model gives a good agreement with the data .",
    "+ finally we calculated the bias coefficient using a selection function that takes into account the effects of non - radial motions , and we show that the _ bias _ so obtained can account for a substantial part of the total bias required by observations on cluster scales .",

    "<S> in this paper we show how non - radial motions , originating from the tidal interaction of the irregular mass distribution within and around protoclusters , can solve some of the problems of the cdm model . </S>",

    "<S> we compare the two - points correlation function , that we obtain taking account of non - radial motions , with that obtained by sutherland & efstathiou ( 1991 ) from the analysis of geller & hucra s ( 1988 ) deep redshift survey and with the data points for the apm clusters obtained by efstathiou et al . </S>",

    "<S> we compare the x - ray temperature distribution function , calculated using press - schechter theory and evrard s ( 1990 ) prescriptions for the mass - temperature relation , taking also account of the non - radial motions , with henry & arnaud ( 1991 ) and edge et al . </S>",
