    "with the discovery of the double quasar b0957 + 561 in 1979 ( @xcite ) , the door was opened for observational cosmology using gravitational lenses .",
    "lenses offer the possibility of determining angular diameter distances at large redshifts , independent of the assumptions that underlie other distance measurement techniques . the time delay between pairs of lensed images of a variable source , when combined with a model of the lensing potential ,",
    "gives an estimate of angular diameter distance , and thus constrains the hubble parameter @xmath2 , the deceleration @xmath3 , and the cosmological constant @xmath4 ( refsdal 1964 , 1966 ; @xcite ) .",
    "since cosmological parameters other than @xmath2 affect the time delay , measurements of many lensed systems at various redshifts will ultimately be needed .",
    "the possibilities for b0957 + 561 were realized immediately , and vla and optical monitoring for the time delay began in 1979 .",
    "table  1 lists measurements of the time delay of b0957 + 561 , showing the literature reference , light curves , and estimate of the time delay in days and in years .",
    "note that before 1989 the results were scattered in delay , with large errors .",
    "more recently , estimates for the delay have clustered around 415  days and 540  days . before 1992",
    "it seemed that the optical light curves gave shorter delays and the radio light curves gave longer delays , and since 1992 a variety of analyses have been used on the light curves in attempts to resolve the discrepancy .",
    "although some statistical techniques have found consistent delays at optical and radio wavelengths , the techniques have not been consistent with each other .",
    "the statistical properties of the noisy irregularly sampled light curves ( complicated by microlensing effects at optical wavelengths ) have proven difficult to understand , and the conclusion has often been that more observations are needed .",
    "we present here lengthened radio light curves with additional features .",
    "although the ultimate goal of this project is to determine the angular diameter distance to the lens , we focus this paper primarily on the value of the time delay and techniques for measuring it accurately .",
    "determining @xmath2 from the time delay requires assumptions about @xmath3 and @xmath5 , and a good model of the lensing potential , in itself a subject of much recent work ( grogin &  narayan 1996a , 1996b ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "recent observations have provided an improved understanding of the cluster and galaxy lensing potentials ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , which should allow for better constrained models .",
    "in addition to the time delay , the light curves give the flux ratio between the a and b images , an important parameter in lens modeling .",
    "since the lensing effect is achromatic , this relative magnification is independent of wavelength , as long as the emission region size is also independent of wavelength and the angular resolution of the observations is comparable .",
    "these conditions are not met when comparing the vla flux ratio to the optical flux ratio , since the optical emission region is much smaller than the 6  cm emission region .",
    "the vla flux ratio will also differ from the vlbi ratio , since the vla beam averages over the varying magnification on mas scales ( @xcite ) .",
    "all flux ratios reported here are ratios between the vla 6  cm images of a and b.    it is four years since our last report on the vla 6  cm monitoring of b0957 + 561 .",
    "preliminary results on the most recent data have been released ( @xcite ; @xcite ) ; here we provide the complete data and results of 15  years of observations .",
    "new features have appeared that allow us to improve our estimate of the time delay . to determine the time delay , we have chosen three of the techniques referred to in table  1 : prh@xmath0 analysis ( press , rybicki ,  &  hewitt , 1992a , b , hereafter prha , prhb ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , dispersion analysis ( pelt  _ et  al .",
    "_ 1994 , pelt  _ et  al .",
    "_ 1996 , hereafter p94 , p96 ) , and discrete correlation function analysis ( lehr  _ et  al .",
    "_ 1992 , hereafter l92 ; @xcite ) .",
    "these were selected to provide consistency with our previous work and to explore an additional technique .",
    "all three avoid interpolation of the light curve , a practice that biases the result for irregularly sampled data by weighting assumed data during observing gaps the same as real observations ( falco  _ et  al . _ 1991b ; prha ; l92 ) .",
    "the application of the selected methods to the same light curves , described in similar notation and tested with the same monte carlo data , may help to clarify some of the issues related to this problem .",
    "in section  2 we report our observations and the recent features in the light curve .",
    "section  3 describes the synthetic data used to determine the confidence interval for each statistic . in section  4",
    "we use prh@xmath0 analysis to find the time delay , and discuss issues related to this method . in section  5",
    "we report the results of dispersion analysis of these light curves , and in section  6 we discuss the results of the discrete correlation function analysis .",
    "our conclusions are in section  7 .",
    "the gravitational lens b0957 + 561 has been observed about once a month from 1979 to the present at the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) very large array radio telescope ( vla ) .",
    "results through 1990 were reported by l92 . since then",
    ", 32 observations have been added to the light curves , yielding 112 observations of good quality between 1979  june and 1994  december .",
    "the observations are made at two bands , 4.885 and 4.835  ghz ( both @xmath6 ) , with 50  mhz bandwidth each .",
    "here we report only the 4.885  ghz observations since the other band was not in use in the early 1980s at the vla .",
    "the vla cycles through four configurations ( a , b , c , and d ) about once every 480  days . at 6  cm ,",
    "the angular resolution of the four arrays is approximately 0.3 , 1 , 3 , and 10 , respectively .",
    "since the separation of the a and b images in b0957 + 561 is 6 , the images are not resolved in the d configuration , causing gaps in the monitoring of approximately 120  days in every 480  day period .",
    "of the 112 observations , 50 are from a , 31 from b , and 31 from c.    all of the observations have been reduced using the techniques of l92 , in order to keep the treatment of the data as uniform as possible over the 15  years .",
    "all were flux- and phase - calibrated to the nearby point source 1031 + 567 , which was found by l92 to not vary by more than 2% in flux density with respect to the vla flux calibrator 3c286 .",
    "after two iterations of phase self - calibration , the data were cross - calibrated to a reference map to align the coordinate systems for all the maps .",
    "the reference map for each vla configuration was made from the observation with the best uv - coverage for that array , and we have used the same reference maps as l92 . finally , the extended structure in the map was subtracted from each data set , leaving behind only the two point images of the quasar core .",
    "a gaussian was fitted to each image to determine its flux density .",
    "the final light curves are reported in table  2 .",
    "although the flux densities are reported in mjy , all of the real and synthetic data in this paper were converted to `` dbj '' units for analysis . for a flux density @xmath7 the conversion to dbj",
    "is @xmath8 this logarithmic scale is similar to the optical magnitude scale , and we have used it in order to be consistent with prhb . in these units ,",
    "a 2% change in @xmath7 is 0.088dbj@xmath9 .    due to the deconvolution and self - calibration techniques involved in vla data reduction",
    ", the accuracy of the flux densities listed in table  2 can not be determined analytically .",
    "l92 estimated the errors on these measurements in three ways : as the rms during the quiescent period ( 1983.3 to 1988.0 for a and 1984.5 to 1989.5 for b ) , as the rms in the residuals to a 2nd - order polynomial fit to the long decline ( 1980.5 to 1984.0 ) , and by splitting a single observation into subsections in time .",
    "l92 concluded that the errors are approximately 2% of the flux density , which is about 0.6  mjy for the a image , and about 0.4  mjy for the b image . due to the different synthesized beams in the three vla arrays used ( a , b , c )",
    ", it is possible that the errors are significantly different for these arrays .",
    "table  2 lists the vla array at the time of observation ( sometimes a hybrid array ) , and the array assumed during the data reduction ( one of the standard arrays , either a , b , or c , whichever is most similar to the observation array ) . for simplicity",
    "we have assumed a homogeneous error model for each light curve , such that every data point has the same fractional error , irrespective of the array of observation .",
    "the 6  cm vla light curves are plotted in figure  [ lightcurve ] . since 1990 ,",
    "the a and b images have both declined to approximately the flux density of the mid 1980s .",
    "in addition , the a image rose in flux density during 1993 .",
    "we have been closely monitoring the b image in 1995 - 96 , which has also increased in flux density , and these data will be reported in a future publication .",
    "this continued variation is fortunate for those interested in measuring angular diameter distances through the b0957 + 561 time delay . as more features",
    "enter the curve , the determination of the delay should continue to improve .",
    "note that the two light curves have very similar features , with no significant differences on long time scales .",
    "this is evidence that the radio light curves , unlike the optical light curves , are not affected by microlensing on time scales of one to fifteen years .    in spring  1990 , the b image changed in flux density by nearly 4  mjy in a few months .",
    "these data points have already been the subject of considerable discussion ( @xcite ; p94 ; p96 ) .",
    "we have looked carefully at the raw data , and find that there were no abnormalities in these observations : there were no weather problems , no bad antennas , and the self - calibration , mapping , and subtraction of extended emission all proceeded smoothly .",
    "the final maps had no artifacts from the reduction and were of low noise .",
    "the flux densities of a and b observed with the second vla band ( 4.835  ghz ) were slightly different than the reported data ( about 0.15mjy@xmath10 for these data sets ) , a difference which is typical for data sets at other times in the light curve ( @xcite ) .",
    "this implies that there was no frequency - dependent measurement errors or corruption of the data .",
    "thus , we conclude that the fluctuation of spring  1990 is of physical origin and that the points can not be excluded as poor quality data .",
    "possible explanations for this fluctuation might be refractive interstellar scintillation ( riss ) , microlensing in the lensing galaxy , or intrinsic variation of the quasar ( if the variation in the a image occurred in a gap , such as summer  1988 ) .",
    "all of these processes would require the source to be extremely small to achieve a fluctuation time scale of a few months .",
    "since the fluctuation occurs during the start of an outburst , it is possible that the emission is from a compact jet component emerging from the core . the feature in 1989 - 91 ( a image ) and 1990 - 92 ( b image )",
    "would be due to the component expanding and then cooling .",
    "such a component could be small enough to be susceptible to riss or microlensing .",
    "to find the uncertainty in the time delay estimates we made a suite of synthetic data sets .",
    "we will describe these synthetic data here , then refer to them as they are used in later sections .",
    "we made a set of 500 gaussian monte carlo light curve pairs , with 112 points in each curve at the same observation times as the real radio light curves .",
    "we will use the notation n = x to denote different lengths of the light curves , where x is the number of points in the curve .",
    "the curves were generated using a gaussian process , with the same structure function as that assumed for the real light curves ( see section  4 , eq .",
    "[ [ n=107sf.eq ] ] ) .",
    "the measurement errors were modeled as gaussian random variables with zero mean and rms @xmath11  dbj ( image a ) and @xmath12  dbj ( image b ) ( eq .",
    "[ [ n=107err.eq ] ] ) .",
    "the data were then given a randomly chosen time delay and flux ratio , uniformly distributed in the ranges 350 to 650  days in delay and 0.68 to 0.72 in ratio .",
    "in each of the following sections , these 500 gaussian monte carlo data sets are used to determine the uncertainty in the time delay and flux ratio values found for the real n=112 light curves .",
    "this is done by determining the minimum with respect to delay and ratio of the prh@xmath0 and dispersion surfaces , or the maximum with respect to delay of the discrete correlation function , for each of the 500 data sets .",
    "the differences between the fitted and true delays ( and the fitted and true flux ratios ) are then found for all the monte carlo data .",
    "the median of the fitted - minus - true values measures the bias in the result , and we subtract this value from the fitted delay and ratio of the real data . to find the 68% confidence interval",
    ", we count out 170 data sets on both sides of the median , enclosing 68% of the points , then adjust the interval for the bias by subtracting the median .    we also did a quasi - jackknife analysis of the data .",
    "p94 chose to remove some points from the radio light curve , choosing the points that seemed to have the biggest influence on the time delay . to do a more formal analysis of the effect of leaving out points",
    ", we made a second set of synthetic data by leaving out each data point , one at a time .",
    "this created 112 data sets , each with 111 data points .",
    "this is the procedure used when doing a `` jackknife '' analysis on data that is _ not _ in a time series .",
    "it is not formally correct for a time series , because the data are correlated in time and do not meet the necessary condition of being independent and identically distributed .",
    "our purpose in using these `` pseudo - jackknife '' data sets is to demonstrate the impact of leaving out individual points , and to create data sets with statistical properties identical to the real data , even if those properties are non - gaussian or non - stationary .",
    "as mentioned in section  2 , the b image has a strong variation in spring  1990 which is not due to measurement error and must be of physical origin . for reasons explained in section  4 ,",
    "we have chosen to do our analysis for both the complete light curves and for the light curves with five data sets from spring  1990 removed , leaving 107 data points . in order to find the confidence intervals in the n=107 analysis",
    ", we made 500 gaussian process data sets in the same manner as described above , except that each contains 107 data points .",
    "we have also made 107 pseudo - jackknife data sets of 106 points each .",
    "thus , we have four sets of synthetic data : 500 gaussian process monte carlo data sets with 112 points each , 500 gaussian process monte carlo data sets with 107 points each , 112 pseudo - jackknife data sets of 111 points each , and 107 pseudo - jackknife data sets of 106 points each .",
    "press , rybicki , and hewitt ( prha , prhb ) have determined time delays from the published optical and radio light curves ( vanderriest  _ et  al .",
    "_ 1989 ; l92 ) using structure function analysis and a chi - squared fitting technique .",
    "rybicki  &  press ( 1992 ) and rybicki  &  kleyna ( 1994 ) further describe the technique and present some modifications . in this section",
    "we apply the technique to the new radio light curves .",
    "following prha , we describe the measured light curve @xmath13 as the sum of the signal @xmath14 from the source and the noise signal @xmath15 representing the measurement error @xmath16 given the covariance matrix associated with @xmath14 , @xmath17 , the covariance model * b * associated with @xmath13 has elements @xmath18 and its inverse is @xmath19 .",

    "the prh@xmath0 statistic is a measure of the goodness - of - fit of a light curve to a model that assumes the temporal correlations of the light curve are described by the covariance matrix @xmath25 .",
    "it was shown by prha to be independent of the underlying mean and variance of the time series .",
    "prha , b estimated the time delay by adopting trial delays @xmath26 and trial flux ratios @xmath27 , combining the light curves according to these trial values , and computing the prh@xmath0 statistic of the combined light curve for each ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) pair using the covariance matrix that describes a single light curve .",
    "note that the prh@xmath0 sum includes contributions from all pairs of points @xmath28 in the light curve under consideration ( @xmath29 pairs for the combined curve ) .",
    "each point is compared to every other point to test how well that pair fits the model , and thus all information available in the light curve is used .",
    "rybicki  &  kleyna ( 1994 ) point out that _ both _ the prh@xmath0 statistic and the normalization factor in the joint probability distribution ( eq .  [ [ prob.eq ] ] )",
    "are functions of parameters of the correlation model .",
    "therefore , minimizing only the prh@xmath0 statistic does not give a true measure of the most likely dataset .",
    "rather , maximum likelihood estimators are found by minimizing the following quantity : @xmath30 since the time delay is a parameter of the covariance model that applies to the combined light curves , the neglect of @xmath31 in the prh@xmath0 minimization procedure is a concern .",
    "the effect of neglecting the @xmath31 term is to favor samplings of the combined light curve that discriminate less among different time delays . in other words ,",
    "time delays are favored in which the overlap is small when the light curves are combined .",
    "thus , the use of @xmath32 rather than prh@xmath0 will , in part , alleviate the impact of sampling on the result .",
    "for this data set , however , we find that the value of @xmath31 does not change by more than a few ( in units of @xmath0 ) for delays in the range 200800  days .",
    "also , the location of the minimum in delay - ratio space for the @xmath32 and prh@xmath0 surfaces does not differ by more than two days in delay .",
    "we also found that for `` window function '' data ( light curves of constant flux density but the same sampling as the real light curves ) , @xmath32 was not immune to the sampling and varied over the range of delays in a way similar to prh@xmath0 . since it is the correct maximum likelihood estimator in this problem , we report the time delay that minimizes the @xmath32 statistic , although it differs only slightly from the time delay that minimizes prh@xmath0 .    in order to use @xmath32 or prh@xmath0 , the covariance model @xmath25 for the data",
    "must be determined .",
    "the variability properties of the light curves can be described by a first - order structure function ( @xcite ) @xmath33 ^ 2\\rangle,\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the lag between two points on the light curve .",
    "we assume a power law form for this structure function , which is typical of quasar light curves ( @xcite ) , and make a fit to the power law using point estimates found directly from the data @xmath35,\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the measurement error for @xmath23 .",
    "if we assume the light curves are stationary , then @xmath37 , and we can relate this autocorrelation function to the structure function by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the variance of the signal @xmath14 .",
    "thus , from an expression for @xmath40 , elements of the covariance matrix are computed by @xmath41 as shown by prha , the prh@xmath0 and @xmath32 statistics are independent of the assumed value of the variance @xmath42 .",
    "an optimal reconstruction @xmath43 of the underlying signal @xmath14 can be found by minimizing the squared difference @xmath44 ^ 2\\rangle$ ] between them for each time .",
    "prha show that @xmath45 and thus the optimal reconstruction @xmath43 can be found from * y * once @xmath46 is known .",
    "we have applied the above analysis to the n=112 light curves , following exactly the prhb analysis of the n=80 light curves .",
    "we assumed the same power - law structure function , @xmath47 and the same error estimate , @xmath48 this fit of the structure function to the point estimates @xmath49 of @xmath40 is shown in figure  [ n=112sf.prh ] for n=112 .    using this model of the underlying quasar emission process and the measurement error",
    ", we used a downhill simplex search , or `` amoeba '' ( @xcite ) , to find the delay and ratio minimizing prh@xmath0 .",
    "the prh@xmath0 surface is plotted in figure  [ n=112chi2surf ] . for 221 degrees of freedom ( 2n minus three for @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath24 ) , the global minimum is prh@xmath50 at @xmath51  days and @xmath52 .",
    "this time delay is much shorter than the delay prhb found for the first 80 data points ( @xmath53  days , 95% confidence interval ) .",
    "the estimate of the delay has changed significantly with the addition of new features to the light curves .",
    "there are , however , several reasons to suspect this result for the n=112 data set .",
    "first , for 221 degrees of freedom and gaussian light curves , @xmath54 has a probability of 0.3% .",
    "if the real light curves are indeed a gaussian process with gaussian noise , we can use prh@xmath0 as a measure of goodness - of - fit . even if not , prh@xmath0 of the a light curve alone plus prh@xmath0 of the b light curve alone should equal prh@xmath0 of the combined curve , if the covariance model , delay , and ratio are correct . here , prh@xmath0=111",
    "( for a ) plus prh@xmath0=116 ( for b ) equals 227 , which is much less than 283 , indicating a bad fit . for n=80 , prh@xmath0 was also large , but the probability ( 8% ) was more acceptable ( prhb ) .",
    "second , the prh@xmath0 surface has several secondary minima , including one at @xmath55  days with prh@xmath56 . while the minimum at 455  days is formally more significant than the minimum at 530  days , it still raises some doubt about which is the best delay for the data set .    finally , the optimal reconstructions of the individual a and b n=112 light curves indicate problems ( figure  [ n=112recon ] ) .",
    "the reconstruction of the a image light curve has a lot of short time scale variation . by eye",
    ", one would guess that many of the small fluctuations in the real data are measurement error , but the covariance model causes the reconstruction to interpret them as signal .",
    "figure  [ n=112recondiff ] shows the differences between the real data and the optimal reconstruction . for both light curves",
    ", we have scaled the one @xmath57 error bars of the reconstruction to equal unity and applied this scale to the flux densities and errors of the corresponding real observations . for the b image",
    ", it can be seen that several observations in spring  1990 ( around julian day 2448000 ) have an unusually high deviation from the optimal reconstruction .",
    "we have found no structure function for the individual light curves that provides a better fit to the spring  1990 points .",
    "therefore , we believe that they have _ different _ statistical properties than the rest of the light curve . this is evidence that a different ( or additional ) physical process is at work during this epoch than during the rest of the light curve .",
    "the above concerns are indications that the assumed structure function and measurement error ( eqs .",
    "[ [ n=112sf.eq ] ] and [ [ n=112err.eq ] ] ) , found by prhb for the n=80 data set , are not a good covariance model for the n=112 data set ; the additional observations since 1990 show that a better covariance model for the data is needed .",
    "the optimal reconstructions show that the b image data points from spring  1990 can not be fit with the same model as the rest of the b image light curve .",
    "since we know these data are modeled incorrectly in the individual curve , we remove them so that they will not confuse the analysis of the combined curve .",
    "thus we repeat our analysis with five consecutive observations from spring  1990 removed : 1990  february  19 , 1990  march  15 , 1990  april  10 , 1990  may  7 , and 1990  may  23 ( to be conservative , both the a and b measurements are removed at each of these times ) .",
    "all of the analysis in this paper has been done with two versions of the light curve , n=112 points and n=107 points .      with the removal of the spring  1990 points",
    ", we believe the n=107 light curves are a homogeneous data set for which a single structure function accurately describes the underlying physical process for both light curves . to find the new covariance model , we use the prh@xmath32 statistic .",
    "the @xmath32 statistic allows for the parameters of the covariance model to be fit at the same time as the delay and ratio , so that the model is found directly from the _ combined _ data .",
    "there are seven parameters to fit : @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath24 , and the exponent and normalization of the power - law structure function .",
    "we had difficulties with the minimization in seven - dimensional space , so we instead found a preliminary fit for the measurement errors and then used @xmath32 to optimize the fit for the other parameters while holding @xmath58 and @xmath59 fixed . to find the measurement errors , we made the point estimates to the structure function @xmath49 for all possible pairs in the individual n=107 light curves , assuming @xmath60  dbj ( about 2% in flux density , as suggested by l92 ) , then fit a power law to the point estimates in the range @xmath61 , and found a preliminary fit for the structure function . using this preliminary fit , we adjusted @xmath58 and @xmath59 until prh@xmath0 for each curve to the preliminary structure function was approximately equal to the number of degrees of freedom , obtaining @xmath62 next , we minimized @xmath32 using a downhill simplex search ( @xcite ) for the combined light curve with respect to @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath24 , and the structure function parameters , while holding @xmath58 and @xmath59 fixed . for the 209 degrees of freedom ( 2n minus five ) , the minimum was @xmath63 , with prh@xmath64 .",
    "the best structure function fit ( see figure  [ n=107sf.best ] ) was @xmath65 equations  [ n=107err.eq ] and [ n=107sf.eq ] are our best covariance model for the light curves . at the minimum ,",
    "the time delay and flux ratio are @xmath66 and @xmath52 .",
    "the @xmath32 surface in delay and ratio is shown in figure  [ n=107qsurf ] ( the prh@xmath0 surface is very similar , with a minimum of 241 at @xmath67  days and @xmath68 ) .",
    "when the bias and 68% confidence intervals are found using the 500 n=107 gaussian process monte carlo data sets , we obtain @xmath69    the value of the delay for n=107 is very similar to that obtained for the n=112 data set with prh@xmath0 . this time , however , the result is more reliable for several reasons .",
    "first , the value of prh@xmath0 at the @xmath32 minimum is 241 , and the probability that @xmath70 for 209 degrees of freedom is 6.4% .",
    "if the curves are gaussian , we can use prh@xmath0 as a measure of goodness of fit , because @xmath71 is a constant ( given a covariance model and sampling ) , and thus @xmath32 will have the same distribution as prh@xmath0 .",
    "( the prh@xmath0 of the individual curves was already used to determine @xmath58 and @xmath59 , so it can no longer be used as a check on the goodness of fit . )",
    "second , both the @xmath32 and prh@xmath0 surfaces for n=107 and the new covariance model are smooth and have a single minimum , without the secondary minima that characterized the n=112 analysis using the old covariance model .",
    "note that the width of the global minimum has also increased in delay space .",
    "the optimal reconstructions of the individual n=107 curves are shown in figure  [ n=107recon ] .",
    "the reconstruction of the n=107 a light curve has less short time scale power than n=112 , agreeing with our guess by eye that most of the short time scale activity is measurement error rather than signal .",
    "the differences between the reconstruction and the original data is shown in figure  [ n=107recondiff ] .",
    "all of the data now fall further from the reconstruction than before , but there are no data points falling much further from the reconstruction than their neighbors , as the spring  1990 points did in figure  [ n=112recondiff ] .    to test the impact of sampling on our result , we made an `` ersatz '' or `` window function '' data set , where the light curves have the same sampling as the real data but constant flux density .",
    "the @xmath32 statistic for the ersatz data is plotted in figure  [ n=107ersatz ] , along with the @xmath32 statistic for the real data ( where the flux ratio has been set to @xmath72 ) .",
    "the ersatz data show a mild peak at about 480  days , corresponding to the vla configuration cycle .",
    "delays of 480  days are excluded most strongly because at that delay there is the most overlap between the a and b light curves .",
    "thus , the real data show a minimum at a time delay of 460  days in _ spite _ of the sampling effects .    with the covariance model for n=107 in hand , we can go back and use it to analyze the n=112 light curve .",
    "the n=112 @xmath32 surface is shown in figure  [ n=112qsurf ] , and we find that the surface is now smooth .",
    "thus , the change between figures  [ n=112chi2surf ] and [ n=107qsurf ] was due to the new covariance model , _ not _ to the removal of points ( or to the use of @xmath32 instead of prh@xmath0 , since @xmath73 is nearly flat over the surface ) .",
    "the minimum of the n=112 surface is @xmath74 at @xmath66 , @xmath75 , and prh@xmath76 .",
    "when the 500 n=112 gaussian process monte carlo data sets are analyzed with the same procedure , we find the bias and confidence intervals and obtain @xmath77 for 221 degrees of freedom ( 2n minus three for @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath24 ) , the probability of @xmath78 is 0.03% .",
    "the n=112 a light curve with the new model has prh@xmath79 , and the b light curve has prh@xmath80 , thus the b image is the cause of the bad fit , as we would expect since the spring  1990 points are included .",
    "the optimal reconstructions for n=112 a and b , using the new covariance model , are comparable to figures  [ n=107recon ] and [ n=107recondiff ] , except the spring  1990 points are more than five @xmath57 away from the reconstruction .    finally , we analyzed the pseudo - jackknife data using prh@xmath32 .",
    "delays for the n=112 jackknife sets were scattered between 446 and 472  days ( -14 and + 12  days from the delay found above for the real data ) .",

    ", the delays were scattered between 448 and 473  days ( -12 and + 13  days from the real data ) , except removal of 1992  january  6 shifted the delay estimate by + 21  days to 481  days .",
    "this is not surprising , since 1992  january  6 is the first point after the flux density decrease in the b image in 1991 , and the alignment of this feature with the a image decrease in 1990 is essential to the calculation of the delay .",
    "the removal of no single point caused the time delay estimate to shift by more than twice the confidence interval obtained from the gaussian monte carlo data .",
    "the scatter in time delays obtained from the pseudo - jackknife data , which has all the properties of the real data ( including any non - gaussian characteristics ) , is confirmation that the confidence intervals determined from the gaussian monte carlo data are roughly correct .",
    "the time delay estimate found using prh@xmath0 has changed significantly since press , rybicki ,  &  hewitt ( prhb ) applied their analysis to the first 80 data points in the vla light curves ( n=80 ) .",
    "the change is due to the new features that have entered the light curves , particularly the flux density decrease in both images in 1990 - 91 .",
    "we reanalyzed the n=80 light curves , and the n=80 light curves with five spring  1990 points removed ( n=75 ) , trying both the old and new covariance models . with the old model , the n=80 and n=75 prh@xmath0 surfaces have local minima ( around 455 and 600  days ) , and the global minimum in both cases is around 550  days . with the new covariance model ,",
    "the n=80 and n=75 prh@xmath0 surfaces are smooth , with a single minimum at 540  days .",
    "the minimum is also much broader with the new covariance model , indicating a larger confidence interval . _ since removing points and changing the covariance model has little effect on the best - fit delay in any version of the light curves , the change in the delay estimate since 1992 is not due to the new covariance model or to the removal of certain points , but to the additional features .",
    "_ we confirm the finding of prha that the choice of covariance model has little effect on the value of the best fit time delay , but we find that it has a significant effect on the topology of the prh@xmath0 surface and the confidence interval .",

    "we evaluate the light curves using the dispersion method of pelt  _ et  al . _",
    "( 1994 ) and pelt  _ et  al . _ ( 1996 ) .",
    "the dispersion method compares the flux densities of nearby pairs of points and sums the squared differences over the whole curve . to measure the dispersion ,",
    "the light curves from the a and b images are first combined at a trial time delay @xmath26 and trial flux ratio @xmath27 . for this combined set of points ,",
    "the dispersion is @xmath81 with weighting terms @xmath82 and @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the statistical weight for each observation .",
    "the pairs included in this sum are all ab pairs in the combined curve with separation less than @xmath85  days , which is of order 2n pairs",
    ". the @xmath86 term , a modification to p94 added by p96 , decreases the weight on pairs with larger separations , and is essential for making the dispersion a smooth function of time delay .",
    "we used @xmath87 , just as in p96 .",
    "this weighting is in effect a type of covariance model , where points less than 60  days apart are expected to have identical flux densities , and points more than 60  days apart can have any flux density difference .",
    "the minimum of @xmath88 with respect to @xmath26 and r is the estimate of the time delay and flux ratio .",
    "p94 also define a statistic @xmath89 to show the effects of the removal of points , @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the location in the list of observations where @xmath92 points are removed .",
    "the statistic compares the dispersion at two different delays ( @xmath93 and @xmath94 ) when certain points are removed , indicating whether those particular points favor one particular delay or another .",
    "p94 discussed mainly the case of @xmath95 points , @xmath96 , and @xmath97",
    ".    figures  [ n=112dispsurf ] and [ n=107dispsurf ] show the dispersion surface in delay and ratio for the n=112 and n=107 data sets , respectively . in order to find the global minima of the surfaces we again used a downhill simplex search ( @xcite ) . to avoid local minima",
    ", we started ten `` amoeba '' searches at various locations in the surface , then used the deepest point found as the global minimum .",
    "the global minimum for the n=112 real data set was @xmath98 at @xmath99  days and @xmath100 .",
    "the number of ab pairs used in the calculation of the dispersion at the minimum was 276 .",
    "the bias and the 68% confidence intervals were found from the 500 n=112 gaussian monte carlo data sets , giving @xmath101 for n=107 points , the global minimum was @xmath102 at @xmath103  days and @xmath104 .",
    "the number of pairs used in the calculation at the minimum was 234 .",
    "there is also a secondary minimum of @xmath105 at @xmath106  days and @xmath107 .",
    "the bias and the 68% confidence intervals were determined from the 500 n=107 gaussian monte carlo data sets . when the bias is taken into account , the deepest minimum is @xmath108",
    "p96 found that the value of the time delay for n=80 , with no points removed , was 616  days , and that the value shifted to 421  days when the 1990  april  10 and 1990  may  7 observations were removed . when all five spring  1990 points are removed from the n=80 data set , the estimate of the time delay shifts to 555  days .",
    "now with the new features in the curve ( n=112 ) the value of the delay is 443  days , and decreases to 398  days with the removal of the spring  1990 points .",
    "delays for the n=112 pseudo - jackknife data , found using the dispersion , were mostly around 442 to 444  days ( just @xmath109  day from the delay found above for the real n=112 data ) , with only thirteen data sets scattered out to 423 to 458  days ( or -20 to + 15  days from the real data ) .",
    "this scatter is comparable to the confidence interval found for the monte carlo data .",
    "the n=107 pseudo - jackknife data had delays at a few particular values , rather than a random scatter over a range of delays : one data set at 456  days ( 1992  january  6 , + 57  days from the real n=107 data ) , eighteen data sets at 427  days ( + 28  days from the real data ) , four data sets at 401  days ( + 2  days from the real data ) , and the rest at 399  days . since 1992  january  6 is the first point after the flux density decrease in the b image in 1991 , it is not surprising that it is crucial to the calculation of the delay .",
    "this pseudo - jackknife test is not the same as the p94 @xmath89 statistic .",
    "we only remove one point at a time , rather than two neighboring points .",
    "more importantly , our test determines the _ best _ delay for each data set , while @xmath89 checks whether @xmath110  days or @xmath111  days is a better fit ( probably neither is the _",
    "best _ fit ) . finally ,",
    "even if two points have a strong effect on the value of the time delay , that does not mean they should be excluded from the analysis , just that they are very influential to the final result ( for instance , if they occur during a rise or fall in the curve ) .",
    "p94 and p96 found that the removal of 1990  april  10 and 1990  may  7 shifted the delay to a shorter value for the n=80 data set , and we confirm that finding for the n=112 set ( the delay estimate is shifted to 399 days ) .",
    "this in itself , however , is not a sufficient motivation to exclude the points .",
    "to be consistent with earlier work , we also analyzed the light curves using a discrete correlation function .",
    "we follow exactly the analysis of l92 , which is based on work by edelson &  krolik ( 1988 ) .",
    "a cross - correlation function was one of the first statistical techniques used to find the time delay ( see table  1 ) .",
    "the peak in the correlation between two signals in time should be a reasonable estimate of the delay between them .",
    "however , serious errors can result if the signal is irregularly sampled or if interpolation is used ( falco  _ et  al . _ 1991b ; prha ; l92 ) , so the correlation function needs to be modified to handle a discrete set of points rather than a continuously measured function .",
    "the correlations must found directly from discrete pairs of points in the a and b light curves , and these correlations are then binned according to the time separation between the a and b points .",
    "so we use the locally normalized discrete correlation function ( lndcf ) @xmath112^{1/2}},\\ ] ] where the sum is over all ab pairs in the delay bin , _",
    "i.e. _ all pairs such that @xmath113 @xmath114 is the number of pairs in the bin , @xmath115 and @xmath116 are the mean and standard deviation of the @xmath117 in the bin , @xmath118 are measurement errors , and @xmath119 is the size of the bin around @xmath26 . since the mean and variance may not be constant for the entire light curve ( _ i.e. _ if the curve is not stationary ) , they are calculated separately for each delay bin .",
    "the lndcf is binned by definition , so it can not be determined independently for all values of @xmath26 . decreasing the bin size",
    "improves the resolution with respect to @xmath26 , but also increases the error for each bin .",
    "we used a bin size of 30  days , the same as l92 , and the number of pairs in this calculation for the radio light curves is of order n/2 . to find the time delay more precisely than the bin size , a cubic polynomial was fit to the peak of the lndcf .",
    "an advantage of the lndcf is that it is independent of the flux ratio and only a function of time delay . to obtain the flux ratio , we combined the two curves using the fitted delay , then adjusted the flux ratio to minimize the summed dispersion between the curves .",
    "the dispersion at each observed time was computed using a linear interpolation of the adjacent points from the other curve .",
    "the lndcf for the n=112 and n=107 light curves is plotted in figure  [ n=112.107lndcf ] , showing the lndcf and its errors for each delay bin , and the cubic fit to the peak of the lndcf . for n=112 ,",
    "the maximum correlation of 0.943 is at @xmath120  days , where about 70 pairs were used in the calculation .",
    "the fitted flux ratio for this delay was @xmath68 .",
    "the 68% confidence intervals and the bias were determined from the 500 n=112 gaussian monte carlo data sets , giving @xmath121 for n=107 , the maximum correlation of 0.971 was at @xmath122  days , where about 60 pairs were used in the calculation .",
    "the fitted flux ratio for this delay was @xmath123 .",
    "using the 500 n=107 gaussian monte carlo data sets to find the bias and the 68% confidence intervals , @xmath124    l92 found a value for the delay of @xmath125 ( with a correlation of 0.97 ) when using this method on the first 80 data points . with the addition of the new features in the light curves ,",
    "the estimate of the delay has shifted to a lower value , in agreement with the prh@xmath32 and dispersion results . unlike the prh@xmath32 result but in agreement with the dispersion result ,",
    "the delay estimate is significantly affected by the removal of the five points in spring  1990 .",
    "the lndcf is dominated by the flat portions of the light curve , which swamp out the signal from sharp features , so the removal of the points from the strong 1990 rise make the lndcf less able to distinguish between delays of interest ( note the flatness of the n=107 lndcf from 350 to 600  days in figure  [ n=112.107lndcf ] ) .",
    "we calculated the lndcf for the n=112 pseudo - jackknife data sets , and found that the delays were scattered between 428 and 489  days ( or -30 to + 31  days from the delay found above for the real n=112 data ) , except that removal of 1990  april  10 shifted the delay estimate -44  days to 414  days .",
    "the scatter is comparable to the confidence interval obtained from the gaussian monte carlo data .",
    "removal of 1990  april  10 effectively selects the `` first rise '' in the b image in 1990 ( see section  7 ) .",
    "the lndcf for the n=107 pseudo - jackknife data found delays scattered between 395 and 417  days ( -10 to + 12  days from the real n=107 data ) , with the removal of 1989  september  27 shifting the delay estimate -19  days to 386  days .",
    "the scatter is smaller than the confidence interval obtained from the monte carlo data . since 1989",
    "september  27 is the last point before the b rise in 1990 , it is crucial for alignment with the rise in 1988 of the a image .",
    "we have calculated time delays by using three different statistical techniques on the complete light curves , and on the light curves with five points removed .",
    "confidence intervals have been found using gaussian process monte carlo data with the same sampling and structure function as the real light curves .",
    "table  3 lists our results .",
    "note that the flux ratio increases with decreasing time delay , a trend that can be seen in the delay - ratio surfaces .",
    "some time delay studies have made the error of assuming one flux ratio while finding the delay , rather than fitting for both parameters at once .",
    "the degeneracy between the fitted delay and ratio is probably due to the long decline in the early part of the light curves .",
    "table  3 contains values ranging from 398 to 461  days .",
    "thus , the new features in the light curves show convincingly that the time delay for the radio light curves is less than 500  days . but",
    "which of the delays in table  3 is correct ?",
    "we comment here on the advantages and disadvantages of the different statistical methods used .",
    "the prh@xmath32 statistic has the advantage of using all of the data in the light curves ( @xmath126 pairs ) . each point",
    "is compared to every other point , and the difference is checked for consistency with the covariance model , rather than just comparing every point to its nearest neighbors and checking if the difference is zero .",
    "the method is less dependent on the exact features of the light curve than the other methods , and instead relies on the statistical properties of the underlying quasar emission and the measurement error .",
    "however , prh@xmath32 , as applied here , requires two important assumptions about the data : that the light curve is statistically stationary ( assumed when we fit one structure function for the whole light curve ) , and that the covariance model correctly describes the variations in the light curve . since @xmath32 was used to find the covariance model , the second assumption should be a good one .",
    "although the use of @xmath32 has reduced the impact of sampling , the gaps in the observations still cause delays of about 480  days to be excluded more strongly than other delays for `` window function '' data .",
    "we confirm the finding of prha that the choice of covariance model for the prh@xmath0 or @xmath32 analysis has little affect on the best fit delay , but find that the choice of covariance model can have a significant affect on the topology of the prh@xmath0 surface and the confidence interval found from monte carlo analysis .",
    "the dispersion method does not assume that the light curves are stationary , but does assume that nearby points will have identical flux densities if their separation is less than 60  days .",
    "the dispersion only uses about 2n pairs of points in the calculation . while the original version of the dispersion given in p94 produced very rough surfaces in time delay",
    ", the weighting modifications of p96 have made the dispersion a smooth function of delay and ratio , so that there is a convincing ( but broader ) global minimum .",
    "the discrete correlation function has the advantage of being completely independent of the flux ratio , since it fits only in delay .",
    "it assumes that the light curves are stationary within each delay bin , and assumes that nearby points will have similar flux densities .",
    "the number of pairs going into a calculation is on the order of n/2 .",
    "because of the bin size , the lndcf has poor resolution in delay unless it is interpolated at the peak .",
    "furthermore , it is dominated by the non - performing parts of the signal , such as linear ramps and flat sections , rather than the sharper features ( thus , non - linear variability is more important for this method than the others ) .    given the arguments for and against each method , we are not convinced that one method is superior to the others , and so we are not convinced of a particular value of the time delay .",
    "we _ are _ convinced that the time delay , based on the current radio light curves , is in the range 375 to 485  days , and definitely less than 500  days .",
    "the flux ratio is then in the range 0.695 to 0.707 .",
    "the large range for the delay has two causes .",
    "first , there have been unlucky coincidences of key features in the light curves with gaps in the monitoring ( the 1991 b decrease and 1994 a increase ) , or with unusual variations ( the 1990 b increase ) .",
    "second , although all three methods agree on the time delays inserted in stationary , gaussian monte carlo light curves ( with @xmath15% uncertainty ) , they disagree by @xmath115% on the time delay for the real light curves , indicating that the data may have non - gaussian properties .    ideally , monte carlo data should be made to have _ all _ the statistical properties of the real data .",
    "the only way to do this with certainty is to derive the monte carlo light curves directly from the real ones .",
    "p94 and p96 did this by using a bootstrap technique to make monte carlo data .",
    "they first combined the light curves at their best delay , then applied an adaptive median filter to the combined curves , and finally bootstrapped the residuals .",
    "although they derive the synthetic data from the real data , they also assumed a value for the delay and and assumed that the residuals about the median - filtered light curve are independent and identically distributed ( probably not the case ) .",
    "although our pseudo - jackknife analysis was not formally correct , it was another way to produce synthetic light curves directly from the data .",
    "we found that the scatter in the time delay estimates for the pseudo - jackknife data was comparable to , and in some cases better than , the confidence intervals from the gaussian monte carlo light curves . to improve the statistical analysis of the current 6  cm light curves beyond what has been done , the non - gaussian characteristics of this time series need to be incorporated into the analysis .",
    "the analyses discussed above are statistical , but often one can gain insights into the problem by sliding the curves across one another to get an estimate of the time delay by eye .",
    "figure  [ combine ] shows the light curves combined at three delays .",
    "when combining the curves , one finds that for longer delays ( greater than 500  days ) , the a image decline around julian day 2448000 - 8500 does not happen soon enough to line up with the b image drop around julian day 2448500 - 2449000 .",
    "this leads one to expect that the time delay we obtain based on the current light curves will be shorter than the delay obtained previously , which is exactly what we find from the statistical analysis above .",
    "note that at shorter delays ( less than 500  days ) the fluctuation in the b image in spring  1990 starts to look out of place .",
    "in fact , the b image seems to have two possible rises , either in 1990  february - march or in 1990  may , depending on which points you choose to ignore ( see figure  [ lightcurve ] ) .",
    "shorter time delays seem to correspond to assuming the first rise is the real one , the longer time delays seem to correspond to the second rise being real .",
    "this explains why the 1990  april  10 and 1990  may  7 b image points are so influential to the time delay analysis , as found by p94 .",
    "the prh optimal reconstruction gave us additional information about these points , indicating that the observations in that epoch were produced by a different physical process than the rest of the light curve .",
    "thus we removed the points for both the first and the second rise in spring  1990 for the n=107 analysis . in the future",
    "we may gain a better understanding of the different underlying physical processes , and may be able include those in the model .",
    "since the a and b light curves show no large differences on time scales of one to fifteen years , we conclude that the vla 6  cm light curves are not affected by microlensing or other mechanisms on these time scales .",
    "this is an advantage of the radio monitoring over optical monitoring projects .",
    "however , shorter fluctuations such as that in the b image in spring  1990 do confuse the analysis .",
    "such variations may be due to microlensing or riss of a compact jet component emerging from the core of the quasar , and thus would be more likely to occur during times of flux density increase than at other times in the light curve .",
    "an estimate of the time delay , when combined with a mass model , gives us a measurement of the angular diameter distance to the lens .",
    "if assumptions are also made about the cosmology , then we can find the hubble parameter @xmath2 . while kochanek ( 1991 ) warns against modeling without sufficient observational constraints ,",
    "others make basic assumptions about the galaxy and cluster in the lens and then do the fit .",
    "falco  _ et  al . _",
    "( 1991a ) model the galaxy as a king model sphere with a core mass , and the cluster as a shear effect .",
    "grogin  &  narayan ( 1996a , 1996b ) model the galaxy as a softened power - law sphere with a core radius , and the cluster as a shear .",
    "grogin  &  narayan ( 1996a , 1996b ) fit both of these models to the vlbi observations of garrett  _ et  al . _",
    "( 1994 ) , assuming @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "grogin &  narayan found the fit to the king sphere lens model to have a lower @xmath0 than the power - law sphere model , although the reduced @xmath0 of 3.4 was still large , indicating a poor fit to the observational constraints . for the king sphere model",
    "they find @xmath129 the velocity dispersion of the galaxy was measured recently by falco  _ et  al . _",
    "( 1996 ) to be @xmath130 for positions more than 0.2 from the center of the lensing galaxy . using this velocity dispersion and the shortest delay in table  3 , the king sphere model gives @xmath131",
    ", while using the longest delay in table  3 gives @xmath132 .",
    "the quoted uncertainties on these values of @xmath2 are one @xmath57 , and 5% error has been added for the ambiguity due to large scale structure along the line of sight ( @xcite )",
    ".    continued vla monitoring of this source will improve our estimate of the delay .",
    "the quasar has been more variable in recent years than in the 1980s , and new features may continue to enter the light curve .",
    "we have yet to achieve dense sampling of a sharp increase or decrease in _ both _ the a and b light curves that is not confused by an unusual variation .",
    "since 1990  october we have been monitoring b0957 + 561 at 4  cm as well as 6  cm . at the shorter wavelength ,",
    "the a and b images are resolved in the vla d array , so the 4  cm light curves will be free of long gaps .",
    "the flat - spectrum cores of the a and b images will be better isolated from the extended emission in the image , and the cores should also be more variable .",
    "finally , the multi - wavelength information on the quasar variability will aid in understanding the physical origin of the fluctuations .",
    "joint analysis of the 4  cm and 6  cm light curves will improve our measure of the time delay in the 0957 + 561 gravitational lens system , and will be reported in a future publication .",

    "<S> we report on 15  years of vla monitoring of the gravitational lens b0957 + 561 at 6  cm . </S>",
    "<S> since our last report in 1992 , there have been 32 additional observations , in which both images have returned to their quiescent flux density levels and the a image has brightened again . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the time delay from the light curves using three different techniques : the @xmath0 analysis of press , rybicki , &  hewitt ( 1992a , b ) , the dispersion analysis of pelt  _ et  al . _ </S>",
    "<S> ( 1994 , 1996 ) , and the locally normalized discrete correlation function of lehr  _ et  al . _ </S>",
    "<S> ( 1992 ) . </S>",
    "<S> confidence intervals for these time delay estimates are found using monte carlo techniques . with the addition of the new observations , </S>",
    "<S> it has become obvious that five observations from spring  1990 are not consistent with the statistical properties of the rest of the light curves , so we analyze the light curves with those points removed , as well as the complete light curves . </S>",
    "<S> the three statistical techniques applied to the two versions of the data set result in time delay values in the range 398 to 461  days ( or 1.09 to 1.26  years , a leading b ) , each with @xmath15% formal uncertainty . the corresponding flux ratios ( b / a ) are in the range 0.698 to 0.704 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the new features in the light curve show that the time delay is less than 500  days , in contrast with analysis of earlier versions of the radio light curves . </S>",
    "<S> the large range in the time delay estimates is primarily due to unfortunate coincidences of observing gaps with flux variations . </S>"
