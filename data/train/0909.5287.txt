    "most of our knowledge of the inner structure of the nucleon is encoded in parton distribution functions .",
    "they are used to describe hard scattering processes involving nucleons . while there has been achieved a lot of understanding concerning the longitudinal structure of a fast moving nucleon , very little is known about its transverse structure @xcite .",
    "transverse refers to the direction of motion and concerns both the transverse spin distribution and the parton intrinsic motion , @xmath4 .",
    "recent data on single spin asymmetries in semi - inclusive deep - inelastic scattering ( sidis ) off transversely polarized nucleon targets @xcite triggered a lot of interest towards the transverse momentum dependent and spin dependent distribution and fragmentation functions @xcite .",
    "correlations between spin and transverse momentum ( @xmath4 ) induce new spin effects , which would be zero in the absence of intrinsic motion of the quarks in the nucleon @xcite .",
    "the sidis cross - section in the one - photon exchange approximation contains eight transverse - momentum dependent distribution functions @xcite .",
    "some of these can be extracted in sidis measuring the azimuthal distribution of the hadrons in the final state @xcite .",
    "three distribution functions survive upon integration over the transverse momenta : these are the quark momentum distribution @xmath5 , the helicity distribution @xmath6 , and the transversity distribution @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the latter is defined as the difference in the number density of quarks with momentum fraction @xmath8 with their transverse spin parallel to the nucleon spin and their transverse spin anti - parallel to the nucleon spin @xcite .    to access transversity in sidis",
    ", one has to measure the quark polarization , i.e. use the so - called quark polarimetry. different techniques have been proposed so far .",
    "three of them are used in compass :    * a measurement of the single - spin asymmetries ( ssa ) in the azimuthal distribution of the final state hadrons ( the collins asymmetry ) * a measurement of the ssa in the azimuthal distribution of the plane containing final state hadron pairs ( the two - hadron asymmetry ) * a measurement of the polarization of final state hyperons ( the @xmath3-polarimetry )    of special interest among the transverse - momentum dependent distribution functions are the sivers function @xmath9 @xcite , which describes a possible deformation in the distribution of the quark intrinsic transverse momentum in a transversely polarized nucleon @xcite , and its chiral - odd partner , the boer - mulders function @xcite , describing the transverse parton polarization in an unpolarized hadron .",
    "the boer - mulders function generates azimuthal asymmetries in unpolarized sidis , together with the so - called cahn effect @xcite , which arises from the fact that the kinematics is non - collinear when @xmath4 is taken into account , and with the perturbative gluon radiation , resulting in higher order qcd processes .    in the past",
    ", unpolarized azimuthal asymmetries have been measured by the emc collaboration  @xcite , with a liquid hydrogen target and a muon beam , without separating hadrons of different charge .",
    "these data have been used  @xcite to extract the average @xmath10 of quarks in the nucleon .",
    "azimuthal asymmetries have been also measured by e665  @xcite and at higher energies by zeus  @xcite .",

    "a @xmath11  gev muon beam is scattered off a transversely polarized @xmath2 or @xmath1 target .",
    "the scattered muon and the produced hadrons are detected in a wide - acceptance two - stage spectrometer with excellent particle identification capabilities @xcite . in the years 2002 , 2003 , and 2004 , data were collected on a transversely polarized @xmath1 target . in the run @xmath12 , data were taken with a transversely polarized @xmath2 target . in the following",
    "i will focus on the new results from the data taken on the polarized @xmath2 target and on the results for unpolarized azimuthal asymmetries .",
    "the latter were obtained by averaging over opposite spin orientations of the @xmath1 target .",
    "in semi - inclusive deep - inelastic scattering the transversity distribution @xmath13 can be measured in combination with the chiral odd collins fragmentation function @xmath14 . according to collins , the fragmentation of a transversely polarized quark into an unpolarized hadron generates an azimuthal modulation of the hadron distribution with respect to the lepton scattering plane @xcite .",
    "the hadron yield @xmath15 can be written as : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the average hadron yield , @xmath18 the fraction of polarized material in the target , @xmath19 the target polarization , @xmath20 the depolarization factor , and @xmath21 the fractional energy transfer of the muon .",

    "@xmath28 : @xmath29 here , @xmath30 is the quark charge , @xmath31 the unpolarized fragmentation function , @xmath32 the fraction of available energy carried by the hadron and @xmath33 the hadron transverse momentum with respect to the virtual photon direction .",

    "this definition of @xmath40 is invariant under boosts along the virtual photon direction .",
    "the number of produced oppositely charged hadron pairs @xmath47 can be written as : @xmath48 here , @xmath49 is the angle between the momentum vector of @xmath45 in the center of mass frame of the @xmath37-pair and the momentum vector of the two hadron system @xcite .",

    "since the collins and sivers asymmetries are independent azimuthal modulations of the cross section for semi - inclusive deep - inelastic scattering @xcite , both asymmetries can be determined experimentally from the same dataset .",
