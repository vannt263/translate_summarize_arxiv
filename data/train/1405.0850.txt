    "in recent years , the late - time cosmic acceleration has been confirmed by several observational evidences @xcite .",
    "this important discovery leads to one of the great puzzles in cosmology , and various plausible models have been developed to unravel the nature of such a late - time speed - up over the last decade .",
    "there have been many attempts at building up reasonable and consistent models by modifying the standard cosmology , which can be roughly categorized into two major directions : one is to introduce a dominant dark energy component in the universe ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , while the other is to modify einstein s general relativity ( gr ) at large scales ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    an intriguing brane - world scenario proposed by dvali , gabadadze , and porrati ( dgp ) provides a new mechanism with an induced gravity ( ig ) term , i.e. , a four - dimensional ( 4d ) ricci scalar , included in the brane action @xcite .",
    "the ig term is expected to arise as a quantum correction due to the matter field on the brane @xcite , and it makes possible to reproduce the correct 4d newtonian gravity at short distances even if the bulk is a five - dimensional ( 5d ) minkowski space - time with an infinite size @xcite .",
    "the promising feature of the dgp model is that , when generalized to a friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) brane with ordinary matter on it , one of its solutions , called the self - accelerating branch , will become asymptotically de sitter in the far future , giving rise to a late - time accelerating phase without needing to introduce additional substances on the brane that violates the strong energy condition @xcite .    despite this advantage , it was pointed out later on that the self - accelerating branch is plagued with a ghost instability @xcite .",
    "the spin-2 perturbations in this branch , viewed as an effective 4d massive gravity theory on a de sitter background , are composed of a tower of infinite kaluza - klein ( kk ) massive gravitons .",
    "then , the mass of the lowest mode @xmath0 is within the range @xmath1 if the brane tension is positive , where @xmath2 is the hubble parameter , and thus there will be a spin-2 ghost excitation in its helicity-0 component @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if the brane tension is negative , the lowest mass is larger than the critical scale , i.e. , @xmath3 , but the spin-0 perturbation , associated with the brane - bending mode , becomes a ghost instead @xcite . in the specific case without brane tension ,",
    "the lowest mass is equal to the critical scale . even in this marginal case",
    "a detailed analysis shows the existence of a ghost from the mixing between the spin-0 sector and the helicity-0 part of the spin-2 sector @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the appearance of ghosts in the dgp self - accelerating branch can not be eliminated even by invoking a second brane in the bulk with a stabilization mechanism @xcite . for more discussions on dgp ghosts ,",
    "please see ref .",
    "@xcite and the references therein .",
    "nonlinear instabilities of the model have also been discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will investigate the possibility of avoiding the ghost in a generalized dgp model . a natural generalization to the dgp gravitational action , based on its higher - dimensional nature ,",
    "is by adding the gauss - bonnet ( gb ) term to the original 5d bulk action @xcite .",
    "this modification then yields the most general field equation for the bulk metric with its derivatives only up to the second order @xcite .",
    "moreover , this gb term keeps the bulk theory ghost - free and arises as the leading - order correction to the low - energy effective action of the heterotic string theory @xcite , and furthermore , it plays an essential role in the chern - simons gauge theory of gravity @xcite .",
    "this approach has been first discussed in ref .",
    "modes that have the potential to be ghosts are ( i ) the helicity-0 excitation of the lightest kk graviton and ( ii ) the brane bending mode . in ref .",
    "@xcite , considering a model with a minus sign in front of the bulk einstein - hilbert term , the authors succeeded in eliminating these modes .",
    "however , considering only an einstein - hilbert term in the 5d action even with a minus sign generates ghost modes for the graviton in the bulk .",
    "the ghosts can be eliminated by introducing a gb term with a negative prefactor and by taking the anti - de sitter ( ads@xmath4 ) vacuum called the gb vacuum .",
    "it is a kind of a ghost condensation of spin-2 particles .",
    "therefore , their model is ghost - free both in the five - dimensional theory and in the four dimensional effective theory .",
    "the purpose of this paper is , in contrast , confirming if the straightforward extension of dgp model with the gb term still bothers the ghost mode . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we expect that the discrete light mode of the kk tower of the graviton and the brane bending mode to appear in the four dimensional effective action . even though these two modes have the potential to be a ghost , their existence does not necessarily imply a ghost excitation .",
    "the massive graviton is a ghost excitation only if its mass squared is less than @xmath5 , while the brane bending mode becomes a ghost only if the kinetic term has a wrong sign .",
    "in the original dgp model , the ghost conditions have been carefully checked  @xcite , and one of the above mentioned condition is always satisfied , i.e. one of the ghost modes appears .",
    "this means that the flip of the sign in the kinetic term of the brane bending mode happens when the squared value of the mass of the lightest kk graviton is @xmath5 .",
    "nevertheless , its reason is still mysterious  @xcite and there is no reason why in the extended models the same happens .",
    "moreover , we may expect that the gb terms give a large correction to the self - accelerating branch . with gb corrections ,",
    "there are three branches of solutions ; two branches appearing in the original dgp ( the normal branch and the self - accelerating branch ) and one additional branch called the gb branch .",
    "the transition into the gb branch appears at the high energy region of the self - accelerating branch , and thus it is natural to expect that the self - accelerating branch is largely modified .",
    "therefore , a detailed analysis is needed to confirm the existence of the ghost .",
    "then , we study herein the linear perturbations around the background given by ( [ metric ] ) and ( [ warp ] ) with @xmath6 which includes as a particular case the self - accelerating branch , and carefully examine whether or not the ghost excitations appearing in the dgp model could be possibly evaded in this framework .",

    "furthermore , we have also applied the operator decomposition as follows , @xmath110 as long as @xmath111 . as can be seen from the resulting solution in eq.([hb ] ) , the physical degrees of freedom contained in the induced metric perturbations on the brane are effectively composed not only of a kk tower of massive spin-2 gravitons [ cf .",
    "eq.([hfp2 ] ) ] but of a spin-0 excitation associated with the brane - bending mode , corresponding to the second term of eq.([hb ] ) . in addition",
    ", we highlight that , if the trace of the energy - momentum tensor is nonzero , @xmath112 , there is no pathology appearing in this model when @xmath113 , in contrast with the fierz - pauli model for the spin-2 field ( see appendix [ appendix ] ) . in the fierz - pauli model ,",
    "if the graviton mass square reaches the critical scale , @xmath5 , the constraint for the trace of the field , eq.([constraintt ] ) , implies that the trace of the energy - momentum tensor is zero .",
    "however , the seemingly divergent expression in eq.([hb ] ) when @xmath113 is simply because we have decomposed the result into the spin-2 and the spin-0 sector through eq.([decomposition ] ) , which does not hold if @xmath113 . in this sense , the spin-2 and the spin-0 sector are degenerate at this critical scale .",
    "moreover , we can also check that there are no divergent expressions in eqs.([trace ] ) and ( [ htt2 ] ) when @xmath113 before arriving at the final result ( [ hb ] ) .",
    "to check explicitly the existence of ghosts in this model , we need to construct the 4d effective action responsible for all the degrees of freedom included in the solution ( [ hb ] ) . as we mentioned in the previous section , the induced metric perturbations ( [ hb ] ) in general consist of a massive kk tower of spin-2 modes as well as a spin-0 mode , which are denoted here by @xmath114 and @xmath115 , respectively .",
    "therefore , the induced metric perturbations @xmath116 can be expressed as @xmath117 in terms of these notations , the lowest order action for the coupling of the matter trapped on the brane to the induced gravitons is then written as @xmath118    now we continue to deduce the kinetic part of the effective action , and we will deal with the spin-2 and the spin-0 sector separately for convenience . for the spin-2 modes alone , we temporarily consider the traceless source here for simplicity , i.e. , @xmath119 , and so are the spin-2 fields @xmath120 ( see appendix [ appendix ] for the general case without this restriction ) .",
    "then , the kinetic part of the effective action for these tt spin-2 fields @xmath120 takes the form @xmath121 where the undetermined coefficients @xmath122 can be fixed by comparing the equation of motion derived from the action @xmath123 with the one given in eq.([hb ] ) as we consider only the spin-2 part with @xmath119 . as a result",

    "then , we end up with the result ,    @xmath129^{-1}.\\label{betas}\\ ] ]    for the massive kk modes in this framework , it can be shown that the zero mode with @xmath130 satisfying the eigenvalue equation ( [ eigen ] ) is not normalizable with respect to the scalar product ( [ inner ] ) .",
    "therefore , as in the dgp model , there is no physically admissible zero mode in the self - accelerating branch here .",
    "however , it has been shown that , as mentioned in the introduction , the helicity-0 component of the spin-2 field becomes a ghost if its mass is in the range @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "thus , if the lightest massive kk mode in this model has a mass in this forbidden range , this system will contain a spin-2 ghost . on the contrary , if the mass of the lightest kk mode is higher than the critical scale , i.e. , @xmath3 , the spin-2 perturbations become healthy ; however , whether the spin-0 mode is healthy in this case has yet to be checked .",
    "we now turn to the spin-0 mode in the case where the mass of the lightest kk mode satisfies @xmath3 .",
    "the coefficient of the action for the spin-0 mode , @xmath126 , is explicitly given in eq.([betas ] ) , in which the second term inside the bracket is always positive in this case .",
    "besides , it is known that , from fig .  [ fig : fig.pdf ] , the self - accelerating branch of this model is restricted to the parameter space @xmath131 where the upper and lower bounds come from the transition to the gb branch and the normal branch but with @xmath6 , respectively . out of the range ( [ range ] ) with @xmath6 ,",
    "since the hubble parameter is a decreasing function of the energy density , it can not describe our universe  @xcite . within the region of the above parameter space , the first term in the bracket of eq.([betas ] ) turns out to be a positive value . as a result ,",
    "the coefficient @xmath126 is always negative as long as the mass of the lowest mode is larger than the critical scale , i.e. , @xmath3 , indicating the presence of a spin-0 ghost .",
    "consequently , similarly to the dgp model , there always exists a ghost in the self - accelerating branch of this model , which implies that the ghost instability present in the dgp model still can not be removed by invoking a gb term in the bulk action .",
    "the surprising fact is that the sign flip of the first term in the bracket of eq.([betas ] ) always happens with the transition of branches , that is , they are mysteriously related .",
    "the lower bound of the inequality ( [ range ] ) has been already found in the original dgp model , while the upper bound the inequality ( [ range ] ) is shown here for the first time .",
    "then , although the gb branch ( with @xmath6 ) is a theoretical object and can never describe our universe , it is interesting that this branch can be ghost - free .",
    "indeed , the gb branch despite having both modes ( helicity-0 of the spin-2 sector and the brane bending mode ) can be ghost free , unlike the self - accelerating branch where either the brane bending or the helicity-0 of the spin-2 is a ghost .",
    "the normal branch has a similar behaviour to that of the gb branch . in summary",
    ", it might be possible to construct a viable cosmological model where despite the existence of the brane bending and the helicity-0 modes , there is no ghost .",
    "this may imply the possibility of a ghost - free interesting solution for @xmath6 with a nontrivial modification of the dgp model .",
    "in this paper , we looked into a generalized dgp brane - world scenario with a gb term as well as a cosmological constant both incorporated in the bulk action . to check whether this framework can possibly provide a way out of the dgp ghost instability",
    ", we have studied the linear perturbations around a de sitter self - accelerating brane embedded in an ads@xmath4 bulk space - time .",
    "having the linear perturbations analyzed in this system , we end up with the effective induced metric perturbations on the brane , eq.([hb ] ) , the physical degrees of freedom in which , as long as none of the kk modes has a critical mass , @xmath111 , can be effectively described in terms of the massive kk tower of the spin-2 gravitons as well as the spin-0 excitation associated with the brane - bending mode .",
    "moreover , in contrast with the fierz - pauli model for the spin-2 field , gravity in this system can couple to matter with nonzero trace of the energy - momentum tensor when @xmath113 , at which the spin-2 and the spin-0 perturbations are degenerate .",
    "therefore , one can no longer divide the degrees of freedom into the spin-2 and the spin-0 sector at this critical scale .",
    "it has been shown that the massive spin-2 field contains a ghost excitation in its helicity-0 component if the mass is in the range @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "thus , from the massive gravity theory viewpoint , if the mass of the lightest kk mode here is within this forbidden range , there will be a spin-2 ghost excitation present in this system .",
    "on the other hand , provided that the mass of the lightest mode becomes larger than the critical scale , @xmath3 , although the spin-2 sector becomes healthy in this case , the spin-0 mode is shown to be a ghost instead , similarly to the dgp model .",
    "for the specific case where the lightest mass is equal to the critical scale , @xmath113 , whether or not a ghost exists in this model can not be verified rigorously through the method we used here .",
    "presumably , this model still contains a ghost in this marginal case as happens in the dgp model @xcite .",
    "however , this specific fine - tuning condition , i.e. , @xmath113 , is easily broken provided that we consider physical matter fields on the brane , in which case the hubble parameter in general varies with time . as a result",
    ", the dgp ghost instability at the level of linear perturbations still can not be eliminated by invoking the gb term in the bulk action .",
    "our result shows that in the self - accelerating branch the ghost mode always appears , while in the other branches ( with @xmath6 ) we have the ghost - free parameter range , although these branches can not describe our universe .",
    "this is because the sign of the kinetic term of the brane bending mode not only depends on the mass of the lightest kk graviton but also seems to be related to the branches .",
    "we can see it from eq.([betas ] ) .",
    "the sign of the first term in the bracket of eq.([betas ] ) is positive for the self accelerating branch and negative for the other two branches .",
    "therefore , the brane bending mode has both informations of the branch and the value of the lightest kk mass .",
