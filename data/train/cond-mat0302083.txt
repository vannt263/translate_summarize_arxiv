    "many approaches have been put forward to address the nature of in - plane versus out - of - plane transport in terms of anisotropy of the in - plane quasiparticle ( qp ) self energies @xmath16 , @xmath7-axis hopping @xmath17 , impurity assisted hopping , interband transitions , or deconfinement of electrons @xcite . recently the issue of spectral weight transfers in optical conductivity measurements brought about by superconductivity has attracted a great deal of attention@xcite .",
    "the mechanism by which 3d superconducting phase coherence sets in is of continued interest and debate which has been guided in a large part by the measurements of the @xmath1axis transport properties .",
    "the issue is still largely unsettled basically due to the open question of whether electron hopping in the out - of - plane direction is coherent@xcite .",
    "if there were an at least partial conservation of the in - plane momentum for qp tunnelling along the c - axis , lda@xcite would indeed predict an interrelation between c - axis transport and the qp scattering rate close to @xmath18 in the brillouin zone ( bz ) . what would be extremely useful",
    "would be a transport measurement beside conductivity which might directly test whether transport in the plane is intimately tied to out - of - plane transport .    a behavior similar to the resistivity anisotropy is reflected in electronic raman scattering measurements when comparing the temperature dependence of the low energy continuum measured in @xmath0 polarization orientations , which project out charge fluctuations near the bz axes , to @xmath2 configurations , which probe charge fluctuations along the bz diagonals .",

    "this loss of spectral weight with temperature is very similar to the behavior seen in raman scattering in kondo and mixed - valent insulators and is indicative of gapped excitations@xcite .    in the superconducting state ,",
    "the temperature dependence of the @xmath6-plane low frequency ( or regular part of the dc ) conductivity@xcite typically shows a peak around 35@xmath37 which is material dependent and has been attributed to the rapid collapse of the quasiparticle ( qp ) inelastic scattering rate below t@xmath38 and the rise of the qp elastic scattering rate for low @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "a similar peak seen in in - plane thermal conductivity measurements was found to be sensitive to annealing conditions@xcite .",

    "the @xmath1axis thermal conductivity was found to show a very weak peak also sensitive to annealing conditions@xcite .",
    "much less is known about the temperature dependence of raman scattering in the static limit in the superconducting state , although some theoretical treatments have appeared@xcite .",
    "one would like to test whether features shown in conductivity measurements are found in raman scattering measurements and vice - versa .",
    "shastry and shraiman have noted the close similarity between the conductivity and the raman response and have suggested a scaling relation exists between the two which follow the same temperature and frequency dependence@xcite : @xmath42 with @xmath43 a constant independent of frequency and temperature .",
    "this shastry - shraiman ( ss ) relation holds if the qp self energy @xmath44 is independent of * k * and has been shown to be exact for both the falicov - kimball@xcite and hubbard@xcite models in the limit of large dimensions where the self energy and vertex corrections are local . generally though any * k*-dependence of @xmath44 and/or the irreducible raman or current vertices invalidates the ss scaling relation making it inappropriate for strongly anisotropic systems such as the cuprates .",
    "however , an approximate scaling relation may hold for certain cases and one purpose of this paper is to point out some of the connections between the conductivity and raman response for strongly anisotropic systems and derive appropriate scaling relations .",
    "in particular we will , based on symmetry arguments , determine that a variant of the ss relation can be formulated to show that a scaling relation exists separately between @xmath32 and @xmath45 and between @xmath46 and @xmath47 as a consequence of the momentum dependence of @xmath17 , in - plane self energy @xmath48 , and a @xmath35 energy gap @xmath49 .",
    "these scaling relations are also found to also hold in the superconducting state .",
    "comparison with the available data on y-123 and b-2212 in the normal state suggests that qps located near the bz axes or `` hot spots '' become gapped above optimal doping@xcite while the qps located along the bz diagonals or `` cold spots '' are largely doping independent and remain metallic . thus the c - axis transport is partially influenced by a correlation gap near @xmath18 because of partial conservation of the in - plane momentum in c - axis transport and not completely by c - axis diffusion .",
    "there are important differences however with la-214 .",
    "various models for qp scattering as a function of doping are discussed , and it is found that generally no single model can adequately capture the complex nature of electron dynamics over a wide range of doping .",
    "features of the theory in the superconducting state qualitatively describe the behavior seen in the @xmath1axis conductivity , but there are important questions left unanswered . in conclusion ,",
    "experimental evidence in both the normal and superconducting states suggest that the in - plane momentum is at least partially conserved in c - axis transport over a very wide doping range .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : sections ii and iii present the formalism used and the results for the temperature dependence of the low frequency in - plane and out - of - plane conductivity and raman response in the normal and superconducting states , respectively , for the common model where @xmath33 vanishes along the bz diagonals , summarized in the appendix .",
    "the results are summarized and open points are discussed in section iv .",
    "the quantum chemistry of the tetragonal cu - o system yields an out - of - plane hopping which is modulated by the in - plane momentum in such a way that it is strongly governed by qps located along the bz axes as opposed to qps along the zone diagonal , @xmath50^{2}$ ] , as reviewed in the appendix .",
    "this form for the hopping has been widely used to study the penetration depth@xcite , c - axis conductivity@xcite , and bi - layer splitting@xcite in arpes@xcite .",
    "however we note that inclusion of the cu - o chains or o displacements would lower the symmetry with the consequence that the out - of - plane hopping would no longer vanish along the bz diagonals which could only be noticeable at very low temperatures .",
    "we now explore the consequences of such a term on the regular part of the dc conductivities and the symmetry - dependent electronic raman response for qp scattering in the @xmath51 plane and along the @xmath1axis in the following sections .    in linear response theory ,",
    "expressions for the regular part of the conductivity and raman response in the absence of vertex corrections are given as ( here and throughout we set @xmath52 ) @xmath53\\\\ & & \\times\\sum_{\\bf k } \\left ( \\begin{array}{c } j^{\\alpha}_{\\bf k}j^{\\beta}_{\\bf k}\\\\ \\gamma^{2}_{\\bf k}\\\\ \\end{array } \\right ) g^{r}_{\\bf k}(x)g^{a}_{\\bf k}(x+\\omega ) .",

    "the inclusion of vertex corrections is crucial for satisfying ward identities for the conductivity and particle number conservation for the charge density response .",
    "they convert scattering lifetimes into transport lifetimes , and also add an additional source of momentum and temperature dependence to the corresponding response functions .",
    "vertex corrections have been recently been considered in flex treatments of the hubbard model@xcite and a spin - fermion model@xcite where it was shown the @xmath0 raman irreducible vertex is highly renormalized near the @xmath18 regions of the bz .",
    "in addition vertex corrections have been calculated exactly in the limit of large dimensions for the falicov - kimball model , where it was shown they are important in the @xmath34 channel to properly lead to gauge invariance and particle - number conservation but do not contribute to other channels@xcite .",
    "generally , vertex corrections have not yet been generically or systematically investigated in 2d and we thus neglect them since we are interested in exploring simple symmetry properties of the various experimental probes .",
    "the current vertices are simply @xmath61 , and @xmath62^{2}$ ] , where @xmath63 and @xmath64 have only a mild momentum dependence . in the limit where the incident and scattered photon energies are small",
    "compared to the bandwidth the raman vertex is given as the curvature of the band : @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "the vertices are thus determined from the above band structure as @xmath66 , b_{2 } \\sin(k_{x}a)\\sin(k_{y}a)$ ] for @xmath67 orientations , respectively , while for @xmath1axis @xmath34 raman @xmath68^{2}$ ] .",
    "the prefactors @xmath69 and @xmath70 can also be assumed to be only mildly frequency dependent corresponding to off - resonant scattering and therefore are only multiplicative constants .",
    "since the energy range considered is very small in comparison to all electronic bandwidths involved the assumption @xmath71 and @xmath72 to be constant is robust under all realistic circumstances .",
    "as can be seen by the weighting of the vertices , we may expect similar behavior for the @xmath2 raman and in - plane conductivity , and the @xmath73 @xmath1axis @xmath34 raman , and the out - of - plane conductivity as well .",
    "the former two quantities assign weight around the fermi surface ( fs ) to the diagonals while the latter three assign weight along the zone axes .    in correlated electron systems",
    "the density of states ( dos ) plays a strong role in determine transport properties . in mott insulators ,",
    "charge transport occurs via excitations across a mott gap from the lower to upper hubbard bands , while in metallic systems the dos near the fermi level plays the dominant role in low frequency transport .",
    "the nature of how the density states evolves across a mit has been an issue of intense debate for a large number of years as few exact results are available .",
    "however , in the limit of large dimensions dynamical mean field theory has a great deal of insight for some model hamiltonians@xcite .",
    "away from half - filling the hubbard model and the falicov - kimball both possess metallic ground states .",
    "the dos has a typical three - peak structure : the separated upper and lower hubbard bands and a qp dos at the fermi level emerging from the abrikosov - suhl resonance in the related impurity problem .",
    "as the system approaches half - filling and/or for larger values of @xmath74 at fixed filling , the qp dos generally diminishes and vanishes in the mott insulating phase as spectral weight is transferred into the hubbard bands . capturing this transfer in models in realistic dimensions is one of the most important and difficult problem in condensed matter physics .",
    "we thus consider charge transport in correlated systems having coherent qps as well as large energy incoherent charge excitations related to the hubbard bands .",
    "we model coherent qps near the fs by a phenomenological momentum , frequency , and temperature dependent self energy derivable in principle from a renormalizable effective low energy theory : @xmath75 . here",
    "@xmath76 is the renormalized band structure , @xmath77^{-1}$ ] is the qp residue , and @xmath78 is the momentum , frequency , and temperature dependent qp scattering rate .",
    "the full green s function also includes an incoherent part @xmath79 accounting for larger energy excitations such as those involving the lower and upper hubbard bands . in what follows",
    "we focus on low frequency transport in metallic phases and neglect @xmath79 and singularities of the self energy indicative of an incipient phase transition .    converting the momentum sum to an integral over an infinite band",
    "we obtain in the limit of low frequencies @xmath80^{2}}}\\biggr\\rangle , \\label{static}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath81 is the density of states per spin at the fermi level and @xmath82 denotes performing an average over the fs .",
    "it can be immediately seen that the ss relation eq .",
    "( [ ss ] ) follows if @xmath83 is independent of momentum , as it is in local theories@xcite . in what follows we neglect specific features on and off the fs ( such as van hove ) and approximate the 2d fs as a circle and expand the @xmath1axis dispersion for small @xmath84 to obtain : @xmath85 we note that the @xmath1 axis conductivity and @xmath86 are given by the same expressions , in accordance with the qp scattering rate not having a @xmath87 dependence .",
    "therefore we confirm the ss relation for the c - axis @xmath34 raman and c - axis conductivity , respectively : @xmath88 independent of the form for @xmath89 .    at low temperatures",
    "we find from eq .",
    "( [ static ] ) @xmath90 showing the interplay of anisotropies of the scattering rate and the vertices governing the response functions .",
    "the simple expressions for @xmath91 and @xmath92 allow for a straightforward comparison of models for the qp scattering rate .",
    "we choose a generic model which describes strong scattering weighted largely along the bz axes plus a temperature dependent scattering rate taken to be uniform around the fs : @xmath93 this form for the qp scattering rate has been widely employed in a number of models differing in the representations of @xmath94 and @xmath95 constrained only to possess the full symmetry of the lattice ( @xmath34)@xcite . further parameterizations of the anisotropy do not lead to appreciable differences . for the @xmath2 raman as well as the in - plane conductivity ,",
    "the vertices weight out regions of the fs where the scattering rate is small , along the fs diagonals or `` cold spots '' .",
    "however , the @xmath0 and @xmath1axis @xmath34 raman and the out - of - plane conductivity assign no weight to the diagonals and thus will be governed by the scattering at the `` hot spots '' .    neglecting the @xmath96-dependence of the qp residue @xmath97 ,",
    "the resulting integrals can be easily performed to give @xmath98 these results for the ab - plane and c - axis conductivity have been derived several times , most recently by refs .",
    "however here it can be seen that there is a direct connection between conductivities and raman response functions .",
    "it is clear that the function form for the scattering rate determines the temperature dependence of all four response functions , and that the ss relation eq .",
    "( [ ss ] ) does not hold in general .",
    "early on , arpes measurements yielded @xmath99 from smeared spectral functions seen near the bz axes compared to the bz diagonals@xcite .",
    "however , recent arpes measurements indicated bi - layer splitting may have led to an overestimation of @xmath94@xcite , but still the limit @xmath99 is a useful limit to explore . in this limit",
    "the response functions are @xmath100 this directly shows the similarity between the @xmath0 raman slope and the @xmath1axis conductivity , and @xmath2 raman slope and the in - plane conductivity , regardless of the functional form chosen for two contributions to the qp scattering rate .",
    "thus in this model consistent with experiments , a variant of the ss relation for the cuprates may be expressed as @xmath101 this demonstrates how out - of - plane transport can be directly inferred from in - plane optical transport measurements .",
    "further , this confirms the behavior shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) , indicating that the in - plane momentum must be at least partially conserved for transport perpendicular to the cuo@xmath4 planes .",
    "moreover , with eq .",
    "( [ a1gzzscaling ] ) this indicates that the c - axis @xmath34 raman should scale with @xmath0 raman : @xmath102 eqs .",
    "( [ genss]-[a1gb1gscaling ] ) are the central results of this section .    when and how might the scaling relations eqs .",
    "( [ genss]-[a1gb1gscaling ] ) breakdown ?",
    "clearly these scaling relations result from the momentum dependence of the respective response vertices , and since they are dictated solely on symmetry grounds , changes in how one represents the momentum dependence of the vertices can only lead to qualitative effects . however , there are a number of important factors to consider .",
    "first , the inclusion of @xmath79 will change the scaling relations if there is appreciable spectral weight near the fs , but if we restrict ourselves to metallic systems and low frequencies , then these changes are expected to be small .",
    "they might however be large for a system lying near a quantum critical point and the scaling relations may be violated .",
    "next , relating the c - axis conductivity to the @xmath34 c - axis and @xmath0 raman requires that the c - axis coherent hopping vanishes along the bz diagonals .",
    "deviations would come from incoherent diffusive hopping , or more complex coherent hopping paths such as via the cu - o chains in y-123 , and would result in a mixing in the scaling properties for in - plane conductivity and @xmath2 raman transport .",
    "lastly , vertex corrections can appreciably alter the scaling relations .",
    "vertex corrections yield transport scattering rates in place of @xmath103 as required by ward identities , and yield a @xmath104sum rule for the integrated conductivity proportional to minus the kinetic energy .",
    "ward identities can be useful for the conductivity to show that vertex corrections vanish for a momentum - dependent self energy , but no ward identities exist for raman with crossed polarization vectors .",
    "for example , vertex corrections may renormalize even - parity momentum charge vertices ( raman ) but not odd - parity current vertices ( conductivity ) .",
    "if these scaling relations are found to hold , they would imply that vertex corrections at low frequencies and c - axis hopping along the bz diagonals would play only a very minor role in determining low frequency transport .",
    "the scaling relations of eq.([genss ] ) can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] to be qualitatively obeyed .",
    "we now consider several models for @xmath105 and @xmath106 to explore the scaling relations eqs.([normal1]-[normal4 ] ) to address the role of anisotropic qp scattering . in all models , @xmath105 and @xmath106",

    "these preceding exponents are summarized in table i. as can be seen from fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) , all of these models can _ qualitatively _ describe the experimental results for overdoped systems , but important deviations occur for optimal and underdoped systems .",

    "a major issue@xcite is whether the pseudogap is caused by pairing without long - range phase coherence or due to loss of well defined qps at the fs related to the formation of a precursor mott gap , or spin - density and/or charge - density wave states , for example .    in the former case ,",
    "the superconducting gap amplitude closes at t@xmath131 while strong phase fluctuations force the superfluid density to appear at t@xmath38@xcite . in more exotic phases emerging from @xmath132 gauge theories , electrons fractionalize away from the bz diagonals , spinons become deconfined and holons condense and become gapped@xcite . in these scenarios",
    "one might expect a feature in the spectra appearing at a high energies which merges into the superconducting feature at t@xmath38 .",

    "relatedly strong electron and umklapp scattering in particular due to the nearness of a nesting condition can drive fs topological changes near the bz axes or `` hot spots '' which preserve@xcite or lower@xcite the symmetry of the fs .",
    "it is clear that the pseudogap is a manifestation of strong correlations regardless of which scenario is considered .",
    "thus we take a simple approach and relate the pseudogap to a correlation gap as a precursor to the mott insulating phase regardless of any underlying order , characterized by the development of @xmath79 involving large energy transfers across a precursor mott gap .",
    "the gapping can thus be crudely understood as the loss of well defined qps located near the @xmath18 regions of the fs , implying that the coherent part of the green s function diminishes away from the bz diagonal .",
