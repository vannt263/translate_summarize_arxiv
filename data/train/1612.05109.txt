    "it is clear that the investigation of the field of spheroidal bodies in general relativity has important astrophysical consequences , due to the fact the rotation of planets and stars produce spheroidal shapes .",
    "so , it seems that is a good approximation ( slow rotation ) to consider an static spheroidal spacetime to represent the gravitational field of these celescial bodies .",
    "therefore in the present work the vaidya - tikekar prescription @xcite has been employed to get the matter density , radial pressure and other quantities from the einstein field equations .",

    "from this situation one can calculate the value of integration constant @xmath69 .",
    "\\(4 ) it is well known that the anisotropic factor @xmath144 should vanish at the origin but our model does not show this feature rather it has a finite positive value . however , for the maximum part of our stellar distribution the anisotropy is repulsive which allows formation of more massive star .",
    "\\(5 ) our model satisfies all the energy conditions for @xmath101 and @xmath103 .",
    "so our model provides a stable stellar configuration .",
    "\\(6 ) we observe that by obeying herrera s cracking condition our model maintains stabilty with increase of the radius .",
    "\\(7 ) the mass , compactification factor and surface redshift all are monotonic increasing function of the radius of the star .",
    "the maximum value of the compactification factor indicates that our model represents an ultra compact object .",
    "the maximum value of the redshift is about @xmath142 for the present model .    finally , we would like to made some comments on our toy models in 3-dimension relative to the 4-dimensional one .",
    "as mentioned earlier , it seems that the 3d may have a radically different qualitative behavior with respect to the 4d having a more realistic setups . in connection to this",
    "it is to be noted that we have used the data from a 3-spatial dimensional object in order to estimate the constants of the model .",
    "even though one can not have a strong argument about the physical meaning of the consideration of stellar objects of 2-spatial dimensions , however , for an observer in the plane , @xmath145 , all characteristics will reveal as a @xmath0 dimensional portrait .",
    "so superficially it will be more or less justified to use all the data which are apparently the same for both the spacetime .",
    "however , regarding to develop a valid approach to represent in the arena of lower dimensional gravity spheroidal shapes one may follow the methodology of the refs .",
