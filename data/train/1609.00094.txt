    "a fundamental challenge in studying complex networked systems is to reveal the interplay between network topology and functionality@xcite . here",
    "we tackle this challenge by investigating a classical notion in graph theory , i.e. articulation points .",
    "a node in a network is an articulation point ( ap ) if its removal disconnects the network or increases the number of connected components in the network@xcite .",
    "those ap nodes play important roles in ensuring the connectivity of many real - world networks .",
    "for example , in infrastructure networks such as air traffic networks or power grids , aps , if disrupted or attacked , pose serious risks to the infrastructure @xcite . in wireless sensor networks , failures of aps will block data transmission from one network component to others @xcite . in the yeast protein - protein interaction network ,",
    "lethal mutations are enriched in the group of highly connected proteins that are aps @xcite .",
    "identification of aps also helps us better solve other challenging problems , e.g. the calculation of determinants of large matrices @xcite ; and the vertex cover problem on large graphs , which is a notorious np - complete problem @xcite .",
    "representing natural vulnerabilities of a network , aps are potential targets of attack if one aims for immediate damage to a network .",
    "for example , in the terrorist communication network of the 9/11 attacks on u.s .",
    "( fig.1a ) , cutting off those ap members ( shown in red ) could have caused a great deal of disruption in the terrorists ability to communicate @xcite .",
    "note that the removal of an ap in a network may lead to the emergence of new aps in the remainder of the network .",
    "a brute - force strategy of network destruction is to _ iteratively _ remove the most destructive ap that will cause the most nodes disconnected from the giant connected component ( gcc ) of the current network . given a limited `` budget '' ( i.e. the number of nodes to be removed ) , this ap - targeted attack ( apta ) strategy is very efficient in reducing the gcc , compared with other existing strategies @xcite .",
    "indeed , we find that for a small fraction of removed nodes apta leads to the quickest reduction of gcc for a wide range of real - world networks from technological to infrastructure , biological , communication , and social networks ( see appendix [ sec.si-i-a ] ) .",
    "depending on the initial network structure , apta would either completely decompose the network or result in a residual gcc that occupies a finite fraction of the network .",
    "this residual gcc is a biconnected component ( or bicomponent ) , in which any two nodes are connected by at least two independent paths and hence no ap exists @xcite . for accuracy , we will call it residual giant bicomponent ( rgb ) hereafter .",
    "this rgb naturally represents a _ core _ that maintains the _ structural integrity _ of the network .",
    "identification and removal of aps also provide us a novel perspective on the organizational principles of complex networks .",
    "for example , in a terrorist communication network , each ap member can be considered as a _ messenger _ of a particular subnetwork , because any information exchange between that subnetwork and the rest of the network passes through the ap .",
    "all the aps and their associated subnetworks in the original network constitute the _ first layer _ of the terrorist network . after removing all the aps in the original network ,",
    "the first layer is peeled off , new aps emerge and the _ second layer _ of the network is exposed .",
    "we can repeat this greedy aps removal ( gapr ) process until there is no ap left in the network .",
    "figure 1 illustrates this novel network decomposition process in the 9/11 terrorist communication network , which has 62 terrorists .",
    "we find that this network consists of 3 layers and an rgb of 26 nodes .",
    "( note that the rgb associated with the gapr process is similar to but not necessarily the same as that of the apta process , see appendix [ sec.si-i-b ] ) interestingly , among those 26 rgb nodes , 16 of them are hijackers in the 9/11 terrorist attack , which in total has 19 hijackers . in a sense",
    ", this rgb serves as a _",
    "core _ maintaining the _ functionality _ of this covert network , which has a particular goal  hijacking . note that some of the hijackers in the rgb are not hubs ( i.e. highly connected nodes ) , but only have two or three neighbors in the network .",
    "hence they can not be easily identified through traditional network decompositions , e.g. the classical @xmath0-core decomposition @xcite .    despite the importance of aps in ensuring the connectivity of many real - world networks , we still lack a deep understanding on the roles and properties of aps in many complex networks .",
    "we do nt have a theory to quantify if a given network has overrepresented or underrepresented aps comparing to its randomized counterparts .",
    "moreover , the implication of the rgb serving as a core that maintains the structural integrity and/or functionality of a network has never been explored before . in this article",
    "we offer an analytical framework to study those fundamental issues pertinent to aps in complex networks .",
    "we first study the fraction of aps ( @xmath1 ) and the relative size of the rgb ( @xmath2 ) in a wide range of real - world networks .",
    "the aps of a network can be identified all together by a linear - time algorithm based on depth - first search @xcite . as for rgb , we find that the two rgbs associated with the apta and gapr processes significantly overlap for many real - world networks ( appendix [ sec.si-i-b ] ) .",
    "hereafter we focus on the rgb obtained from the gapr process , which is deterministic and hence analytically solvable .",
    "we find that many real networks have a non - ignorable fraction of aps and a rather small rgb ( fig.2a ) .",
    "one may expect that infrastructure networks should have a relatively small fraction of aps and a large rgb , and hence are very robust against ap removal .",
    "ironically , this is not the case .",
    "the power grids in two regions of u.s .",
    "have almost the largest fraction ( @xmath3 ) of aps among all the real networks analyzed in this work .",
    "and they have almost no rgb .",
    "the road networks of three states in u.s .",
    "have almost 20% of aps , and a small rgb ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "in contrast , among all the 28 food webs we analyzed , 22 of them have no aps ( and hence @xmath5 ) , indicating that those networks are biconnected and the extinction of one species will not disconnect the whole network .",
    "more interestingly , we find that most of the real networks analyzed here have either a very small rgb or a rather big one ( fig .",
    "2a light red and green regions ) .",
    "later we will show that this phenomenon is related to a novel discontinuous phase transition associated with the gapr process .    to identify the topological characteristics that determine these two quantities ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 )",
    ", we compare @xmath6 ( or @xmath7 ) of a given real network with that of its randomized counterpart . to this aim ,",
    "we randomize each real network using a complete randomization procedure that turns the network into an erds - rnyi ( er ) type of random network with the number of nodes @xmath8 and links @xmath9 unchanged @xcite .",
    "we find that most of the completely randomized networks possess very different @xmath6 ( or @xmath7 ) , comparing to their corresponding real networks ( fig .",
    "this indicates that complete randomization eliminates the topological characteristics that determine @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "by contrast , when we apply a degree - preserving randomization , which rewires the links among nodes while keeping the degree @xmath0 of each node unchanged , this procedure does not alter @xmath1 and @xmath2 significantly ( fig .",
    "2d , e ) . in other words ,",
    "the characteristics of a network in terms of @xmath1 and @xmath2 is largely encoded in its degree distribution @xmath10 .",
    "most of the real - world networks display slightly smaller @xmath6 and bigger @xmath7 than their degree - preserving randomized counterparts .",
    "we attribute these differences to higher - order structure correlations , such as clustering @xcite and degree assortativity @xcite , which are eliminated in the degree - preserving randomization .",
    "the results of real - world networks prompt us to analytically calculate @xmath1 and @xmath2 for networks with any prescribed degree distribution .",
    "this is achieved by analyzing the discrete - time dynamics of the deterministic gapr process , which generates a series of snapshots for the remainder network with a clear temporal order @xmath11 . here",
    ", @xmath12 is the total number of gapr steps , which is also the number of layers peeled off during the gapr process .",
    "we denote the fraction of aps and the relative size of the gcc in the original network as @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "removal of the original aps leads to a new fraction of aps @xmath15 and a smaller gcc of relative size @xmath16 .",
    "we repeat this process and denote the fraction of aps and the relative size of the gcc of the network snapshot at time step @xmath17 as @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively . at the end of the gapr process , we have @xmath20 and @xmath21 . based on the configuration model of uncorrelated random networks @xcite",
    ", we can analytically calculate @xmath18 and @xmath19 for networks with arbitrary degree distributions at any time step @xmath17 .",
    "this enables us to further compute @xmath12 and @xmath7 ( see appendix [ sec.si-ii ] for details ) .",
    "we first investigate the fraction of aps in the original network , i.e. @xmath22 .",
    "we calculate @xmath6 in two canonical model networks :",
    "( 1 ) er random networks with poisson degree distributions @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the mean degree ; and ( 2 ) scale - free ( sf ) networks with power - law degree distributions @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is often called the degree exponent ( fig .",
    "the fraction of aps is trivially zero in the two limits @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and reaches its maximum at a particular mean degree @xmath29 . for er networks ,",
    "we find that @xmath30 , which is larger than @xmath31 , the critical point of ordinary percolation where the gcc emerges .",
    "the phenomenon that @xmath6 displays a unimodal behavior and the fact that @xmath32 can be explained as follows . the process of increasing the mean degree @xmath24 of an er network can be considered as the process of randomly adding links into the network .",
    "when the mean degree @xmath24 is very small ( nearly zero ) , there are only isolated nodes and dimers ( i.e. components consisting of two nodes connected by one link ) , and thus @xmath33 . with @xmath24 gradually increasing but still smaller than @xmath34 , the network is full of finite connected components ( fccs ) , most of which are trees ( fig .",
    "3c ) . hence , in the range of @xmath35",
    "most of the nodes ( except isolated nodes and leaf nodes ) are aps , and adding more links to the network will decrease the number of isolated nodes and dimers and hence increase the number of aps . when @xmath36 , the gcc develops and occupies a finite fraction of nodes in the network ( highlighted in light blue in fig .",
    "3d - f ) . in this case",
    ", we can classify the links to be added to the network into two types : ( i ) links inside the gcc ( yellow dashed lines ) ; and ( ii ) links that connect the gcc with an fcc or connect two fccs ( green dashed lines ) .",
    "the probability that an added link is type - i ( or type - ii ) as a function of the mean degree @xmath24 is shown in fig .",
    "3a ( light blue region ) .",
    "adding type - i links to the network will never induce new aps , and may even convert the existing aps ( see fig.3d , e , nodes in black boxes ) back to normal nodes . by contrast , adding type - ii links will never decrease the number of aps and could convert normal nodes ( see fig.3c - e , nodes in orange boxes ) to aps .",
    "the contributions of these two types of links to @xmath1 compete with each other . at the initial stage of this range of @xmath24 ( @xmath37 ) , since the gcc is still small , most of the added links are type - ii ( fig .",
    "3a , green dashed line ) , and thus @xmath1 continues to increase ( fig .",
    "3a , red line ) . at certain point",
    "@xmath29 , where the peak of @xmath1 locates , the contribution of type - i links to @xmath6 overwhelms that of type - ii links , hence @xmath1 begins to decrease .",
    "when the mean degree @xmath24 is large enough , the network itself becomes a bicomponent without any ap .",
    "the phenomena that @xmath38 is even more prominent for sf networks , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "this is because , for sf networks , even though the gcc emerges at lower @xmath34 , its relative size is rather small at the initial stage of its emergence , which results in larger @xmath41 ( fig .",
    "3b ) .      we now systematically study the behaviors of @xmath19 and @xmath2 as functions of the mean degree @xmath24 for infinitely large er networks . to emphasize the @xmath24-dependence ,",
    "hereafter we denote @xmath19 and @xmath2 of er networks as @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively . as shown in fig .",
    "4a ( thin grey lines ) , after any _ finite _ steps of gapr , the gcc always emerges in a continuous manner , suggesting a _ continuous _ phase transition .",
    "hereafter we will call it gcc percolation transition . for @xmath17 steps of gapr",
    ", the gcc percolation transition displays a critical phenomenon : @xmath44 for @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the critical mean degree , i.e. the percolation threshold , and @xmath47 is the critical exponent .",
    "we find that as @xmath17 increases , @xmath46 becomes larger and larger , but eventually converges to @xmath48 .",
    "note that , for any finite @xmath17 , the critical exponent @xmath47 associated with the gcc percolation transition is the same : @xmath49 ( see fig .",
    "4c , thin grey lines ) .",
    "by contrast , if we allow for _ infinite _ steps of gapr ( i.e. we stop the process only if there is no ap left ) , the size of the resulting gcc ( which is nothing but the rgb ) , denoted as @xmath50 , displays a remarkable _ discontinuous _ phase transition : @xmath50 abruptly jumps from zero ( when @xmath51 ) to a finite value at @xmath52 , and then increases with increasing @xmath24 ( see fig.4a thick black line ) .",
    "hereafter we will call it rgb percolation transition .",

    "interestingly , the gcc and rgb percolation transitions have completely different critical exponents associated with their critical singularities ( fig .",
    "we also calculate the total number of gapr steps @xmath58 needed to remove all aps of an infinitely large er network of mean degree @xmath24 ( fig .",

    "in this region , with increasing @xmath17 , @xmath70 quickly reaches an equilibrium value @xmath71 , which is smaller than 1 ( fig .",

    "consequently , @xmath63 converges to a finite value for @xmath72 ( fig .",

    "since @xmath58 is infinite in this region , we can use @xmath69 to characterize the relaxation behavior of gapr process .",

    "consequently , @xmath70 is initially less than 1 , but then becomes drastically larger than 1 ( fig .",
    "g , red lines ) , which causes @xmath63 quickly decays to zero ( fig .",
    "4e , red lines ) , and hence @xmath58 is finite and the rgb dose not exist .",
    "the sudden collapse of the rgb upon an infinitesimal decrease in @xmath24 suggests the discontinuous nature of the rgb percolation transition in er networks .",
    "note that at time step @xmath12 , the network will break into pieces and there is no ap left .",
    "hence in the last few gapr steps the growth of @xmath64 will slow down and eventually decrease ( fig .",

    "the value of @xmath2 at criticality @xmath52 is subject to large sample - to - sample fluctuations , being either zero or a large finite value ( fig . 5a and inset ) , which is another evidence of discontinuous phase transition @xcite .",
    "this discontinuous phase transition also partially explains the fact that real - world networks have either a very small or a rather big rgb ( fig .",
    "2a ) .",
    "the nature of the rgb percolation transition in sf networks is qualitatively the same as that in er networks .",
    "the transition from the non - rgb phase to the rgb phase is discontinuous ( fig .",

    "<S> an articulation point in a network is a node whose removal disconnects the network . those nodes play key roles in ensuring connectivity of many real - world networks , from infrastructure networks to protein interaction networks and terrorist communication networks . despite their fundamental importance , </S>",
    "<S> a general framework of studying articulation points in complex networks is lacking . here </S>",
    "<S> we develop analytical tools to study key issues pertinent to articulation points , e.g. the expected number of them and the network vulnerability against their removal , in an arbitrary complex network . </S>",
    "<S> we find that a greedy articulation point removal process provides us a novel perspective on the organizational principles of complex networks . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , this process is associated with two fundamentally different types of percolation transitions with a rich phase diagram . </S>",
    "<S> our results shed light on the design of more resilient infrastructure networks and the effective destruction of terrorist communication networks . </S>"
