    "semiconductor nanostructures.@xcite    in this work , we investigate the two competing physical effects of a thermalized bosonic environment ( bath ) in which two qubits are immersed .",
    "specifically , the induced interaction , which is effectively a zero - temperature effect , and the quantum noise , originating from the same bath modes , are derived within a uniform treatment .",
    "we study the dependence of the induced coherent vsnoise ( decoherence ) effects on the parameters of the bath modes , the qubit system , and their coupling , as well as on the geometry .",

    "specifically , in section  [ section4 ] , we discuss the onset and development of the interaction hamiltonian , as well as the density matrix . it is shown that the initially unentangled spins can develop entanglement .",

    "for the rest of this section , we will consider an illustrative one - dimensional ( 1d ) example favored by recent experiments,@xcite leaving the derivations for higher dimensions to sections  [ section5 ] and [ section6 ] .",
    "we comment that the 1d geometry is also natural for certain ion - trap quantum - computing schemes , in which ions in a chain are subject to coulomb interaction , developing a variety of phonon - mode lattice vibrations.@xcite    in 1d geometry we allow the phonons to propagate in a single direction , along @xmath1 , so that @xmath52 . here , for definiteness , we also assume the linear dispersion , @xmath53 , since the details of the dispersion relation for larger frequencies usually have little effect on the decoherence properties .",

    "we point out that , due to the instantaneous rethermalization assumption ( resetting the density matrix of the bath to thermal ) , in the markovain formulation it was quite natural to assume that the bath density matrix is also thermal at time @xmath17 ; the total density matrix retained an uncorrelated - product form at all times . in the context of studying the short - time dynamics , in this section the choice of the initial condition",
    "must be addressed more carefully . in quantum computing applications",

    "the structure of @xmath175 in the @xmath176-space becomes important .",
    "provided @xmath177 is nearly isotropic , the integrals entering eqs.([eq : s2:he - c])-([eq : s2:eta - s ] ) will include ( in 3d ) a factor @xmath178 , which can be written as @xmath179\\cos ( k|\\mathbf{d}|)$ ] , e.g. , eqs.([eq : b : i - xy ] , [ eq : b : i - z ] ) in appendix  [ secb ] .",
    "when the dependence of @xmath180 on @xmath181 is negligible , the interaction is simply @xmath182 , where @xmath183 and @xmath184 are sets of three integers representing the @xmath60-dependence of @xmath185 and @xmath186 . otherwise , a more complicated dependence on @xmath97 is expected .",

    "however , reduced dimensionality in the @xmath187-space might allow for better control over the magnitude of the interaction by external potentials that modify the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "as a specific example , let us consider a model of two localized impurity - electron spins of phosphorus donors in a si - ge type semiconductor , coupled to acoustic phonon modes by spin - orbit interaction .",
    "in what follows , we first obtain the coupling constants @xmath190 , entering eq.([eq : s1:x_jm ] ) , which define the interaction and noise amplitudes . a brief discussion",
    "is then offered on the possibility of having an ohmic bath model realized in 1d channels .",
    "the rest of the present section is devoted to calculations of the induced interaction and noise in 3d bulk material .",
    "a comparison with the dipole - dipole spin interaction is given .",
    "averaging the spin orbit hamiltonian over the localized electron s wave function , one obtains the spin - orbit coupling in the presence of magnetic field @xmath191 in the form @xmath192 where @xmath193 is the bohr magneton . here",
    "the tensor @xmath194 is sensitive to lattice deformations .",
    "it was shown@xcite that for the donor state which has tetrahedral symmetry , the hamiltonian ( [ eq : s5:h - so ] ) yields the spin - deformation interaction of the form @xmath195 \\\\ \\label{eq : s5:h - sd - hxyz } & + & { \\rm b}\\mu _ { \\textrm{b } } \\left [ { \\bar \\varepsilon _ { xy } \\left ( { \\sigma_x h_y+\\sigma_y h_x}\\right)+{\\text{c}}{\\text{.p}}{\\text{.}}}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here c.p .  denotes cyclic permutations and @xmath196 is the effective dilatation .",
    "the tensor @xmath197 already includes averaging of the strain with the gradient of the potential over the donor ground state wave function .",
    "as before , let us assume that the separation * d * , as well as the magnetic field , are directed along the @xmath198-axis , for an illustrative calculation .",
    "then the spin - deformation interaction hamiltonian simplifies to @xmath199 in terms of the quantized phonon field , we have@xcite @xmath200 where in the spherical donor ground state approximation@xcite @xmath201 here @xmath202 is _ half _ the effective bohr radius of the donor ground state wave function . in an actual si or ge crystal ,",
    "donor states are more complicated and include corrections due to the symmetry of the crystal matrix including the fast bloch - function oscillations .",
    "however , the wave function of the donor electrons in our case is spread over several atomic dimensions ( see below ) .",
    "therefore , it suffices to consider `` envelope '' quantities .",
    "thus , the spin - phonon hamiltonian ( [ eq : s1:h_sb ] , [ eq : s1:x_jm ] ) coupling constants will be taken in the form @xmath203 where @xmath204 and @xmath205 .     and",

    "this will give an example of an ohmic bath model discussed towards the end of section  [ section2 ] .",
    "in 1d channel the boundaries@xcite can approximately quantize the spectrum of phonons along @xmath220 and @xmath206 , depleting the density of states except at certain resonant values .",
    "therefore , the low - frequency effects , including the induced coupling and quantum noise , will become effectively onedimensional , especially if the effective gap due to the confinement is of the order of @xmath221 . as mentioned earlier , this frequency cutoff comes from eq.([eq : s5:f(k ) ] ) , namely , it is due to the bound electron wave function localization .",
    "a channel of width comparable to @xmath222 will be required .",
    "this , however , may be difficult to achieve in bulk si or ge with the present - day technology .",
    "other systems may offer more immediately available 1d geometries for testing similar theories , for instance , carbon nanotubes , chains of ionized atoms suspended in ion traps,@xcite etc .",
    "in our case , the longitudinal acoustic ( la , @xmath223 ) phonons of the one - dimensional spectrum will account for the @xmath224 component of the coupling , whereas the transverse acoustic ( ta , @xmath225 ) phonons will affect only the @xmath220 and @xmath206 spin projections .    one can show that the contributions of the crossproducts of coupling constants , @xmath226 with @xmath227 , to quantities of interest vanish .",
    "the diagonal combinations are @xmath228 with our usual assumption for the low - frequency dispersion relations @xmath229 and @xmath230 , the expressions ( [ eq : s5:gk-1d ] ) lead to the ohmic bath model discussed at the end of section  [ section2 ] .",
    "the shape of the frequency cutoff resulting from eq.([eq : s5:gk-1d ] ) is not exponential .",
    "however , to estimate the magnitude of the interaction and noise one can utilize the results obtained earlier for the 1d ohmic bath model with exponential cutoff .",
    "the coupling constants in eqs.([eq : s2:h - int-1d ] ) and ( [ eq : s2:m - explicit-1d ] ) should , then , be taken as @xmath231 where @xmath232 is a cross section of the channel , and the cutoff is @xmath233 for the @xmath198 component , and @xmath234 for the @xmath220 and @xmath206 components .",
    "considering si as an example , we arrive at an approximately adiabatic hamiltonian ( @xmath235 ) with ohmic - type coupling .",
    "the dynamics of the concurrence , then , is qualitatively similar to the one shown on fig .  2 , with the peak entanglement @xmath236 as well .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath237 , however , is significantly smaller due to the weakness of the spin - orbit coupling of p - impurity electrons in si , which results in low magnitude of the induced interaction ( and the noise due to the same environment ) , and slightly modifies the shape of the concurrence .    in the 3d geometry ,",
