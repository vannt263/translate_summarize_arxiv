    "a superfluid flows without friction but becomes dissipative above a certain critical velocity @xmath1 via generating its elementary excitations such as phonons and vortices .",
    "the landau criterion provides a conventional energetic consideration to determine the critical velocity , stating @xmath10 $ ]  @xcite , where @xmath11 is the energy of an elementary excitation of momentum @xmath12 . for a homogeneous system ,",
    "the landau critical velocity is equal to the speed of sound @xmath5 .",
    "however , the dynamic response of a superfluid flow is significantly sensitive to the boundary condition of the system and hence a quantitative understanding of the critical velocity has been a challenging task in the study of superfluidity .",
    "one of the paradigmatic situations considered in fluid mechanics is a two - dimensional ( 2d ) flow past a circular cylinder . for an incompressible flow ,",
    "the local velocity is increased by a factor of 2 at the lateral sides of the cylinder  @xcite and the local landau supersonic criterion suggests a critical velocity of @xmath13 that is independent of the radius @xmath14 of the cylinder .",
    "theoretical studies showed that the onset of dissipation involves generating a counter - rotating vortex pair  @xcite .",
    "more rigorous calculations , taking into account the compressibility of the superfluid and quantum pressure near the boundary of the cylinder , predicted that the critical velocity converges to @xmath15 in the large cylinder limit @xmath16  @xcite , where @xmath8 is the superfluid healing length .",
    "experimental verification of the predictions on @xmath9 is highly desirable .    in previous ultracold atom experiments ,",
    "a similar situation was investigated by stirring superfluid samples with a repulsive laser beam  @xcite .",
    "the existence of finite critical velocities  @xcite and generation of vortex dipoles  @xcite were successfully demonstrated . however , the measured values of @xmath9 ranged widely from 0.1 to 0.45 , which did not allow a quantitative study of the homogeneous 2d problem .",
    "theoretical investigations showed that the inhomogeneous density distribution of a trapped sample  @xcite , 3d vortex dynamics  @xcite , or the manner of stirring  @xcite should be critical in the measurements .",
    "recently , the vortex shedding dynamics was also investigated experimentally with polariton superfluids flowing past static defects  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we systematically study the critical velocity for vortex shedding in a bose - einstein condensate with a repulsive gaussian potential .",
    "we measure the critical velocity as a function of the barrier height @xmath0 of the potential over a wide range of the beam width , @xmath17 . in particular , in order to address the 2d homogeneous regime , we employ spatially large and highly oblate condensates , ensuring vortex dynamics in two dimensions .",
    "the key difference of a gaussian potential from a hard cylinder is its soft boundary .",
    "a gaussian potential , @xmath18 , produces a density - depleted hole in the condensate when @xmath19 , where @xmath3 is the chemical potential of the condensate .",
    "the radius of the hole and the potential slope at the hole boundary are given as @xmath20 respectively . in comparison to the case with a hard cylinder",
    ", the soft boundary reduces the density in the proximity of the obstacle and consequently lowers the local speed of sound .",
    "then , from the local landau criterion it is naturally suggested that the critical velocity of the hard cylinder defines an upper bound for that of the obstacle formed by the gaussian potential . when the hole radius @xmath14 becomes larger with higher @xmath0 [ fig .",
    "1(b ) ] and/or the beam width @xmath7 decreases for fixed @xmath14 [ fig .",

    "the main result of our measurements is that in the deep non - penetrable regime ( i.e. , @xmath21 ) , the critical velocity @xmath1 increases with decreasing @xmath6 for fixed @xmath22 and approaches about @xmath23 .",
    "this observation is consistent with the expectation from the aforementioned discussion based on the local landau criterion .",

    "the corresponding trajectories are indicated by the arrows in ( a).,width=328 ]",
    "our experiment starts with a bose - einstein condensate of @xmath27na atoms in a harmonic trap formed by combining optical and magnetic potentials  @xcite .",
    "the condensate fraction of the sample is over 90% . in a typical sample condition , where the trapping frequencies are @xmath28 = @xmath29 hz and the atom number of the condensate is @xmath30 , the condensate healing length is @xmath31 m and the speed of sound is @xmath32mm / s at the trap center , where @xmath33 is the planck constant divided by 2@xmath34 and @xmath35 is the atomic mass . by adjusting the trapping frequencies or the atom number of the condensate , @xmath8",
    "is varied up to @xmath36 m . the thomas - fermi radius and thickness of the condensate",
    "are @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively . in this highly oblate condensate , vortex line excitations",
    "are strongly suppressed  @xcite and the vortex dynamics is expected to be two dimensional .",
    "we adiabatically ramp up the power of a repulsive gaussian laser beam in 1  s and hold it for 0.2  s to ensure that the condensate is stationary .",
    "then , we translate the laser beam horizontally by @xmath39 m by using a piezo - driven mirror [ fig .  2(a ) ] .",
    "the velocity @xmath40 of the laser beam is kept constant during the translation and controlled by adjusting the traveling time .",
    "the sweeping region of the laser beam is centered in the condensate [ fig  2(b ) ] .",
    "the density variation over the sweeping region is less than 10% and the speed of sound can be well approximated to be spatially constant . after completing the sweeping , we slowly ramp down the laser beam power for 0.5  s , and take an absorption image of the condensate after expansion by releasing the trapping potential to detect vortices .     of having vortex dipoles ( blue circles ) and the number of vortices ( red diamonds ) as a function of the velocity @xmath40 of the optical obstacle .",

    "the beam waist of the laser beam is @xmath45 m at the focal plane and the gaussian width @xmath7 of the optical obstacle is controlled by defocusing the laser beam at the sample plane .",
    "the sample thickness ( @xmath46 m ) is much shorter than the rayleigh length of the laser beam and we ignore the beam divergence .",
    "the beam width is much smaller than the condensate radius and the chemical potential of the condensate is negligibly affected by the presence of the laser beam .",
    "a vortex dipole is identified with two density - depleted holes that are symmetrically located in the condensate with respect to the sweeping line of the laser beam  [ fig .",
    "2(c ) inset ] .",
    "after beinggenerated in the center region of the condensate , the vortex dipole moves toward the edge of the condensate and splits into two individual vortices that subsequently travel along the boundary of the condensate in the opposite direction .",
    "this peculiar obrit motion of the vortices was studied in ref .",
    "a single vortex was observed occasionally at low @xmath40 with probability @xmath47 . because the vortex lifetime is over 10  s  @xcite",
    ", we attribute the single vortex to uncontrolled perturbations in sample preparation and we do not count it as a vortex dipole .",
    "the critical velocity @xmath1 for vortex shedding is determined from the probability distribution @xmath43 for having vortex dipoles after sweeping with the laser beam . here",
    "@xmath43 is obtained from 15 realizations of the same experiment with a given sweeping velocity @xmath40 , i.e. , @xmath43 is the ratio of the number of images showing vortex dipoles to the total number of measurements .",
    "the critical velocity @xmath1 is determined by fitting a sigmoidal function to the probability distribution as @xmath48 [ fig .",
    "we use the value of @xmath49 as the measurement uncertainty of @xmath50 , corresponding to the range of @xmath51 .",
    "figure 3(a ) displays the results of the critical velocity as a function of the barrier height @xmath0 for various beam widths .",
    "the critical velocity shows a dip structure having a minimum at @xmath52 , clearly distinguishing the two regimes : a penetrable regime with @xmath53 and a non - penetrable regime with @xmath19 .",
    "the dip structure of the critical velocity can be accounted for by a consideration based on the local landau criterion . for @xmath53 ,",
    "the density minimum is located at the top of the gaussian potential and decreases for higher @xmath0 , and thus , lowering the local speed of sound . on the other hand , when @xmath19 , as described before , the potential slope becomes steeper with higher @xmath0 and the density in the proximity of the obstacle boundary is gradually restored back to the bulk density , leading to a higher critical velocity .",
    "the dip structure around @xmath54 becomes more pronounced with larger @xmath6 by lowering the minimum value [ fig .",

    "the inset displays @xmath60 at @xmath61 as a function of @xmath6 and the solid line is a line to guide the eye .",
    "( b ) same data in the non - penetrable regime ( @xmath19 ) as a function of the hole radius @xmath25 , together with additional data points for @xmath62.,width=313 ]    in terms of the vortex shedding mechanism , the penetrable regime is different because there is no density - depleted region in the fluid and it has been anticipated that vortex nucleation would be initiated by generation of rarefaction pulses  @xcite .",
    "recently , the critical velocity of penetrable obstacles for dissipation was investigated in effective 1d systems  @xcite . in one dimension ,",
    "the critical velocity is predicted to vanish as @xmath0 approaches @xmath3  @xcite but it is not the case in our 2d situation .",
    "moreover , the critical velocity shows a quite intriguing dependence on @xmath6 [ fig .",
    "3(a ) inset ] .",
    "further investigation of the functional form of @xmath63 in the penetrable regime is warranted .",
    "however , in this work , we focus on the non - penetrable regime to address the 2d hard cylinder situation .    in fig .",
    "3(b ) , we recast the data for the non - penetrable regime ( @xmath19 ) as a function of the hole radius @xmath14 , together with additional data obtained for @xmath64 with @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "note that the hole radius is weakly dependent on the barrier height as @xmath67 . from the previous discussion of the boundary stiffness effect and @xmath68  [ fig .",
    "1(b ) ] , one may expect that @xmath9 would be saturated to a certain value with increasing hole radius and also that the saturation behavior would be faster with smaller beam width .",
    "we see that the experiment data are roughly fit to the expectation in a small @xmath14 region .",
    "however , when @xmath14 is increased to be larger than @xmath7 , the growth rate of the critical velocity slows down and becomes negative .",
    "note that at @xmath69 , the critical velocity with small @xmath70 is even lower than that with large @xmath71 .",
    "one possible explanation for such climbing - over behavior of the critical velocity is the imperfection of the laser beam profile .",
    "if the beam profile is not perfectly gaussian , for example , the intensity profile of the outer part of the laser beam decays slower than exponential and then the potential slope @xmath72 at the obstacle boundary would decrease with increasing @xmath14 .",
    "we see that the climbing - over of @xmath1 occurs at @xmath73 in both of the data sets with @xmath70 and 35 .",
    "this seems to support the beam profile effect because in our experiment @xmath7 is varied by defocusing the same laser beam .",
    "the @xmath74 factor of the laser beam is measured to be 1.2 .    to further investigate the soft boundary effect on the critical velocity , we take a different scanning trajectory in the parameter space of the gaussian obstacle : decreasing @xmath6 for fixed @xmath22 . in this",
    "setting , the hole radius @xmath14 is also varied proportionally with @xmath7 [ eq .",
    "( 1 ) ] and the trajectory corresponds to a diagonal line in fig .",
    "1(a ) . a scanning with fixed @xmath25 , as depicted in fig .",
    "1(c ) , might be more ideal in terms of isolating the finite-@xmath25 effect  @xcite , but this would require exponentially high @xmath22 for small @xmath6 as @xmath75 , necessarily recalling the outer part of the laser beam .",
    "we set @xmath76 , where @xmath77 and the normalized boundary slope @xmath78 . in the previous measurements ( fig .",
    "3 ) , @xmath79 shows a maximum around this potential height .    in the new set of measurements , we observe that the critical velocity monotonically increases as @xmath6 decreases ( fig",
    ".  4 ) , which is consistent with our expectation from the boundary stiffness .",
    "it is worth noting that although the data are obtained from various samples with different healing lengths , they agree with each other in the plane of the dimensionless parameters @xmath6 and @xmath9 .",
    "this demonstrates the 2d character of the vortex dynamics in our system because the healing length is the only relevant length scale in 2d superfluid hydrodynamics .     versus @xmath6 for fixed @xmath80 . here",
    "@xmath81 m for black closed squares and @xmath82 m for black closed circles .",
    "the blue open circles show the results of theoretical calculation for a 2d hard cylinder of radius @xmath83 from ref .",
    "the red open diamonds indicate the numerical results for a gaussian potential with @xmath84 from ref .",
    "@xcite , where the potential slope @xmath85 would be about two times higher than ours .",
    "the dashed line denotes the theoretically predicted value , @xmath86 for a 2d homogeneous case with a hard cylinder in the large obstacle limit  @xcite.,width=302 ]    for our stiffest obstacle , @xmath9 is measured to be about 0.40 , which is slightly higher than the predicted value of 0.37 for a 2d hard cylinder in the large-@xmath25 limit . in our measurement",
    ", @xmath87 marginally satisfies the large obstacle condition , and the deviation of the measured value might be attributed to the finite-@xmath25 effect .",
    "the dependence of the critical velocity on @xmath25 was investigated theoretically  @xcite and it was shown that @xmath9 gradually increases from the value of 0.37 as @xmath88 . in fig .  4 , for comparison , we display the theoretical results of ref .",
    "@xcite for a 2d hard cylinder of radius @xmath89 ( blue open circles ) and the result of numerical simulations performed with a gaussian potential with @xmath84 in ref .",
    "@xcite ( red open diamonds ) .",
    "the experimental results converge to the theoretical predictions when @xmath6 decreases , i.e. , the optical obstacle becomes similar to a hard cylinder by stiffening its boundary .",
    "our results are inconsistent with the @xmath90 dependence of @xmath1 that was predicted from analytic analyses on the stability of a superfluid flow  @xcite .",
    "it is clearly seen that when @xmath91 increases by a factor of 5 , the @xmath9 decreases less than a factor of 2 . even without including the additional reduction effect due to the soft boundary of the obstacle , the critical velocity decreases much smaller than what would be expected from the @xmath90 dependence .",
    "finally , we want to recall a few aspects of the experimental condition that should be considered for the quantitative comparison of the measurement results to theoretical predictions for a 2d homogeneous case .",
    "first , the critical velocity was not measured for a steady flow condition but by sweeping a finite section of a trapped condensate .",
    "the measurement can be affected by the sweeping manner .",
    "for example , if vortex nucleation requires a finite time , which might be longer than the sweeping time near the critical velocity  @xcite , it would result in a systematic , upward shift of the measured value of @xmath1 .",
    "second , although we expect suppression of 3d vortex dynamics in a highly oblate condensate , it is an inevitable fact that the condensate has an inhomogeneous density distribution along the axial direction .",
    "thus , one can not completely ignore 3d responses of the condensate , in particular , at the moment of vortex nucleation .",
    "it might be necessary or sufficient to introduce an effective speed of sound that would be lower than the peak value @xmath5 of the condensate  @xcite .",
    "we have presented the measurements of the critical velocity for vortex shedding in highly oblate bose - einstein condensates and investigated the soft boundary effect of the moving obstacle formed by a gaussian potential .",
    "our results are consistent with a picture based on the local landau criterion and the measure value of @xmath9 with the stiffest obstacle is in good agreement with the theoretical predictions for a homogeneous 2d superflow past a cylindrical object .",
    "this work has established a reliable experimental method to measure the critical velocity of a trapped condensate and its intriguing extension is to investigate the temperature dependence of the critical velocity , which might provide a new setting to study the role of thermal atoms in vortex nucleation  @xcite .",
