    "the poisson limit theorem as commonly found in textbooks of probability states that the number of successes in @xmath0 independent trials converges in distribution to a poisson distribution with mean @xmath1 if the maximum of the success probabilities tends to @xmath2 and their sum converges to @xmath3 .",
    "the case where the trials have equal success probabilities was implicitly proved by abraham @xcite in his solution to the problem of finding the number of trials that gives an even chance of getting @xmath4 successes .",
    "however , it was simon - denis @xcite who first gave an explicit form of the poisson distribution and proved the limit theorem for independent trials with equal success probabilities , that is , for the binomial distribution .",
    "the poisson distribution was not much used before ladislaus @xcite expounded its mathematical properties and statistical usefulness .    in his book",
    "_ ars conjectandi _ , published posthumously in 1713 , jacob bernoulli ( 16541705 ) considered games of chance and urn models with two possible outcomes and proved what is now known as the weak law of large numbers .",
    "he stressed that the probability of winning a game or of drawing a ball of a particular color from an urn ( with replacement ) remains the same when the game or the drawing of a ball is repeated .",
    "this has led to the use of the term bernoulli trials to represent independent trials with the same probability of success .",
    "representing success by @xmath5 and failure by @xmath2 , a random variable taking values @xmath2 and @xmath5 is called a bernoulli random variable .",
    "however , in this article , a set or a sequence of bernoulli random variables need not be independent nor take the value 1 with equal probabilities .",
    "also , if the success probability of a bernoulli random variable is small , the event corresponding to success is called _",
    "rare_. the poisson limit theorem suggests that the distribution of a sum of independent bernoulli random variables with small success probabilities can be approximated by the poisson distribution with the same mean if the success probabilities are small and the number of random variables is large .",
    "a measure of the accuracy of the approximation is the total variation distance . for two distributions @xmath6 and @xmath7 over @xmath8 ,",
    "the total variation distance between them is defined by @xmath9 which is also equal to @xmath10 for the binomial distribution @xmath11 , @xcite proved that @xmath12,\\ ] ] where @xmath13 denotes the poisson distribution with mean @xmath14 . here , following barbour , holst and janson ( @xcite ) , the formulation corrects a minor error in the original paper .",
    "this result is remarkable in that the approximation is good so long as @xmath15 is small , regardless of how large @xmath14 is .",
    "the result of prohorov was generalised by @xcite to sums of independent bernoulli random variables @xmath16 with success probabilities @xmath17 that are not necessarily equal .",

    "this form of the error bound has become the characteristic of poisson approximation in subsequent developments of the subject .    in this article",
    "we will discuss the use of stein s ideas in the poisson approximation to the distributions of sums of dependent bernoulli random variables , its historical development , applications , and some generalisations and open problems .",
    "the article is not intended to be a survey paper but an exposition with a focus on explaining stein s ideas and presenting some results and recent applications .",
    "the references are not exhaustive but contain only those papers that are relevant to the objective of this article .",
    "this paper is organised as follows .",
    "section [ sec2 ] is a brief introduction to stein s method .",
    "section  [ sec3 ] gives a brief overview of two approaches to poisson approximation using stein s method , and sections [ sec4 ] and [ sec5 ] discuss the developments of these two approaches .",
    "section  [ sec6 ] is devoted to two recent applications of poisson approximation and section [ sec7 ] discusses three generalisations of poisson approximation .",
    "in his seminal 1972 paper published in the sixth berkeley symposium , charles stein introduced a new method of normal approximation .",
    "the method did not involve fourier analysis but hinged on the solution of a differential equation .",
    "although the method was developed for normal approximation , stein s ideas were very general and the method was modified by @xcite for poisson approximation . since then the method has been constantly developed and applied to many approximations beyond normal and poisson and in finite as well as infinite dimensional spaces .",
    "it has been applied in many areas including computational biology , computer science , combinatorial probability , random matrices , reliability and many more .",
    "the method , together with its applications , continues to grow and remains a very active research area .",
    "see , for example , @xcite , @xcite , barbour , holst and janson ( @xcite ) , @xcite , barbour and chen ( @xcite ) , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    in a nutshell ,",
    "stein s method can be described as follows .",
    "let @xmath27 and @xmath28 be random elements taking values in a space @xmath29 and let @xmath30 and @xmath31 be some classes of real - valued functions defined on @xmath29 . in approximating the distribution @xmath32 of @xmath27 by the distribution @xmath33 of @xmath28 , we write @xmath34 for a test function @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is a linear operator ( stein operator ) from @xmath30 into @xmath31 and @xmath37 a solution of the equation @xmath38 the error @xmath39",
    "can then be bounded by studying the solution @xmath40 and exploiting the probabilistic properties of @xmath27 .",
    "the operator @xmath36 characterises @xmath33 in the sense that @xmath41 if and only if for a sufficiently large class of functions @xmath42 we have @xmath43    in normal approximation , where @xmath33 is the standard normal distribution , the operator used by @xcite is given by @xmath44 for @xmath45 , and in poisson approximation , where @xmath33 is the poisson distribution with mean @xmath1 , the operator @xmath36 used by @xcite is given by @xmath46 for @xmath47 .",
    "however the operator @xmath36 is not unique even for the same approximating distribution but depends on the problem at hand .",
    "for example , for normal approximation @xmath36 can also be taken to be the generator of the ornstein  uhlenbeck process , that is , @xmath48 , and for poisson approximation , @xmath36 taken to be the generator of an immigration - death process , that is , @xmath49 + w[f(w - 1 ) - f(w)]$ ] . this generator approach , which is due to @xcite",
    ", allows extensions to multivariate and process settings . indeed , for multivariate normal approximation , @xmath50 , where @xmath42 is defined on the euclidean space ; see @xcite and @xcite , and also @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in poisson approximation , the main focus has been on bounding the total variation distance between the distribution of a sum of dependent bernoulli random variables and the poisson distribution with the same mean .",
    "one of the main objectives has been to obtain a bound which is the `` correct '' generalisation of the bound obtained by @xcite , specifically , one with the multiplicative factor @xmath51 .",
    "broadly speaking , there are two main approaches to poisson approximation using stein s method , the local approach and the size - bias coupling approach .",
    "the local approach was first studied by @xcite and developed further by arratia , goldstein and gordon ( @xcite ) , who presented chen s results in a form which is easy to use and applied them to a wide range of problems including problems in extreme values , random graphs and molecular biology .",
    "the size - bias coupling approach dates back to @xcite in his work on poisson approximation for random graphs .",
    "@xcite presented a systematic development of monotone couplings , and applied their results to random graphs and many combinatorial problems . a  recent review of poisson approximation by @xcite used stein s method of exchangeable pairs to study classical problems in combinatorial probability .",

    "] for any set of dependent bernoulli random variables .",
    "the operator @xmath36 given by @xmath44 for @xmath52 , which was used by @xcite for normal approximation , is constructed by showing that @xmath53 for all bounded absolutely continuous functions @xmath42 if @xmath54 .",
    "this identity is proved by integration by parts . as a discrete counterpart , the operator @xmath36 given by @xmath46 for @xmath55 , which was used by @xcite for poisson approximation , is constructed by showing that @xmath56 for all bounded real - valued functions @xmath42 if @xmath57 , using summation by parts .    using the stein equation @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath28 has the poisson distribution with mean @xmath60 , @xcite developed stein s method for poisson approximation for sums of @xmath61-mixing sequences of bernoulli random variables @xmath62 with success probabilities @xmath63 .",
    "when specialised to independent bernoulli random variables , his results yield @xmath64 and @xmath65 where @xmath66 .",
    "these results improve slightly those of @xcite .",
    "chen s proofs depend crucially on the bounds he obtained on the solution of ( [ 3 ] ) and its smoothness .",
    "these bounds were improved by @xcite , who proved that for @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 where denotes the supremum norm and @xmath71 .",
    "it is perhaps instructive to see how easily le cam s results , with substantially smaller constants , can be proved by stein s method using ( [ 5 ] ) .",

    "compound poisson distributions on the real line , the distributions of poisson point processes , and multivariate poisson distributions are all compound poisson distributions if viewed in an appropriate way , but the three approximations have been studied separately because of the different contexts in which they arise and the different problems to which they are applied .      in many probability models ( see @xcite ) , events occur in clumps at widely scattered localities or at long irregular intervals in time . in such situations ,",
    "the poisson approximation for the number of events occurring either fails or performs poorly .",
    "if the number of clumps is approximately poisson , the clumps are roughly independent and their sizes close to identically distributed , then the number of events occurring can be approximated by a compound poisson distribution .",
    "a typical example of events occurring in clumps is earthquakes exceeding certain magnitude .",
    "often such an earthquake is followed by a quick succession of several earthquakes before normalcy is resumed .",
    "we illustrate further the notion of clumps by presenting the example of the longest head run discussed in arratia , goldstein and gordon ( @xcite ) .",
