    "the emergence of calculable and detectable vacuum energy as a consequence of imposing external boundary conditions in quantum field theory was predicted more than @xmath0 years ago by casimir @xcite . since that time",
    "the vacuum energy of fluctuating quantum fields that are subject to boundary conditions was studied in various setups ( see , e.g. , reviews in @xcite ) .",
    "usually , the boundary manifold is chosen to be noncompact disconnected ( e.g. , two parallel infinite plates , as generically in @xcite ) or closed compact ( e.g. , box or sphere ) ; see @xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we shall consider the boundary manifold which is noncompact connected and has the form of an infinite tube in three - dimensional space .",
    "as has been first demonstrated by aharonov and bohm @xcite in the framework of first - quantized theory , the magnetic flux enclosed in such a tube affects the properties of quantum matter outside the tube . this effect which is named after them has no analogues in classical physics and is characterized by the periodic dependence on the value of the flux , vanishing at integer multiples of the london flux value , while being maximal at the half of the london flux value .    in the framework of second - quantized theory ,",
    "one is interested in the vacuum polarization effects which are induced outside the tube by the magnetic flux enclosed in the tube . in particular",
    ", the question is , whether the vacuum energy is induced .",
    "if this is the case , then this may be denoted as the casimir - bohm - aharonov effect ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it should be noted that initially @xcite the bohm - aharonov effect was considered under the assumption that the transverse size of the tube is zero , which corresponds to the singular magnetic vortex configuration . to take into account the finite transverse size of the tube was an important task , since in reality a vortex - forming solenoid is of finite width .",
    "this task was fulfilled at one time , see @xcite .",
    "although , unlike the case of a singular vortex , the quantum - mechanical problem in the case of a finite - thickness vortex is not exactly solvable , a thorough analysis has been carried out , and , in particular , it has been shown that the bohm - aharonov effect disappears at a sufficiently large thickness of an impenetrable magnetic vortex @xcite .    returning to quantum field theory , and , appropriately , to the casimir - bohm - aharonov effect , we note that up to now this effect was considered for the case of a singular magnetic vortex only @xcite .",
    "therefore the aim of the present paper is to make a first step in the study of the dependence on the thickness of an impenetrable magnetic vortex .",
    "it should be noted that vacuum polarization effects which are induced by magnetic fluxes of finite thickness were considered by different authors , see @xcite .",
    "however , these authors are concerned with the case when there is no boundary at all and the region of the flux is penetrable for the quantized matter fields ; therefore , the obtained results have no relation neither to the casimir , nor to the bohm - aharonov effects . in the present paper",
    "we shall show that , similarly to the bohm - aharonov effect , the casimir - bohm - aharonov effect disappears at a sufficiently large thickness of the vortex .",
    "the second - quantized matter will be represented by the charged massive scalar field .    in the next section a general definition of the vacuum energy density for the quantized scalar field",
    "is reviewed and a starting expression for its renormalized value is given . in section 3 this value",
    "is calculated numerically in the case of @xmath1-dimensional space - time .",
    "finally , the results are summarized and discussed in section 4 .",
    "the operator of the quantized charged scalar field is represented in the form @xmath2,\\ ] ] where @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) are the scalar particle ( antiparticle ) creation and destruction operators satisfying commutation relations ; wave functions @xmath7 form a complete set of solutions to the stationary klein - gordon equation @xmath8 @xmath9 is the covariant derivative in an external ( background ) field and @xmath10 is the mass of the scalar particle ; @xmath11 is the set of parameters ( quantum numbers ) specifying the state ; @xmath12 is the energy of the state ; symbol @xmath13 denotes summation over discrete and integration ( with a certain measure ) over continuous values of @xmath11 .",
    "we are considering the static background in the form of the cylindrically symmetric magnetic vortex of finite thickness , hence the covariant derivative is @xmath14 with the vector potential possessing only one nonvanishing component given by @xmath15 outside the vortex ; here @xmath16 is the vortex flux and @xmath17 is the angle in the polar @xmath18 coordinates on a plane which is transverse to the vortex .",
    "the dirichlet boundary condition on the edge @xmath19 of the vortex is imposed on the scalar field : @xmath20 i.e. quantum matter is assumed to be perfectly reflected from the thence impenetrable vortex .",
    "provided the orthonormalization condition is satisfied , @xmath21 the solution to and in the case of the impenetrable magnetic vortex of thickness @xmath22 takes form @xmath23,}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the coordinate along the vortex , @xmath25^{-1/2}\\!\\!,\\ ] ] and @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 ( @xmath29 is the set of integer numbers ) ; @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the bessel functions of order @xmath32 of the first and second kinds .",
    "it should be noted that the vortex can be obviously generalized to @xmath33-dimensional space by adding extra @xmath34 longitudinal coordinates to @xmath24 ; then factor @xmath35 is changed to @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the @xmath38-dimensional vector which is orthogonal to the @xmath18-plane in @xmath33-dimensional space .    in general , the vacuum energy density is determined as the vacuum expectation value of the time - time component of the energy - momentum tensor , that is given formally by expression @xmath39 which is ill - defined , suffering from the ultraviolet divergencies : the momentum integral corresponding to the last expression in diverges as @xmath40 for @xmath41 .",
    "the well - defined quantity is obtained with the use of regularization and then renormalization procedures ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . as to regularization ,",
    "one employs conventionally either heat - kernel or zeta - function methods ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . as to renormalization",
    ", it has been shown @xcite that , for a specific configuration of a vortex through the excluded region , it suffices , irrespective of the number of spatial dimensions , to perform one subtraction , namely to subtract the contribution corresponding to the absence of the vortex .",
    "this fact owes to the symmetry in the problem , being of rather general nature .",
    "it is consistent , for instance , with a more recent result obtained in a quite different setup in paper @xcite , where the casimir energy per unit length for @xmath42 non - overlapping parallel cylinders of infinite length in three - dimensional space is shown to be directly related ( without the need of an extra subtraction or an extra counter - term ) to the casimir energy for @xmath42 non - overlapping discs in two - dimensional space .    thus , the renormalized vacuum energy density in the case of the finite - thickness vortex takes form @xmath43,\\ ] ] where , in view of , @xmath44 ^ 2.}\\ ] ] owing to the infinite range of summation , the last expression is periodic in flux @xmath16 with period equal to @xmath45 , i.e. it depends on quantity @xmath46\\!\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath47 $ ] is the integer part of quantity @xmath48 ( i.e. the integer which is less than or equal to @xmath48 ) .",

    "we restrict ourselves to the case of @xmath62 and @xmath65 , when the expression for the vacuum energy density takes form @xmath66 where @xmath67",
    "we rewrite in the dimensionless form @xmath68 where @xmath69 , @xmath70 $ ] .",
    "let us point out some analytical properties of the integrand function in : it vanishes at the edge of the vortex @xmath71 at large distances from the vortex the case of a singular vortex is recovered @xmath72 at small values of @xmath24 one gets @xmath73 ^ 2.\\ ] ]    numerical analysis indicates that in the calculation of function @xmath74 one can use series in and with finite limits , namely for calculation @xmath74 at point @xmath75 it is enough to cut off the summation limits by @xmath76 $ ] . in this case",

    "so , for the finite - thickness magnetic vortex we can compute values of dimensionless quantity @xmath78 for different ( not very small ) values of @xmath11 . to do this",
    ", we have to be able to perform integration in ( [ c3 ] ) with high precision",
    ". we make it in a following way .     at different values of @xmath11.,width=340 ]    as one can see from fig.2 , the function @xmath74 is negative from @xmath79 to the first function root at @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "so , the appropriate integral in is negative .",
    "the subsequent roots are denoted by @xmath82 , @xmath83 , etc . because of decreasing character of the envelope function the integral from @xmath84 to @xmath83 will be positive .",
    "it is useful to define a period of function @xmath74 as an interval between two next to neighboring roots , i.e. from @xmath84 to @xmath83 , from @xmath83 to @xmath85 , and so on .",
    "then the full integral in will be a sum of the negative integral from @xmath79 to @xmath80 and a multitude of positive integrals over subsequent periods . in the case of sufficiently small transverse size of the tube ( @xmath86 ) the integrals over some finite number of first periods may be negative but thereupon they become and remain positive also .    for small @xmath24 ( @xmath87 )",
    "we make a direct integration of function @xmath74 over periods using 25 digits of precision in internal computations .     at @xmath88.,width=340 ]    for large @xmath24 we make integration for each period separately .",
    "to do it we create a table of values of function @xmath74 for a separate period and replace this function by more simple function in the form @xmath89 where sine function ensures that roots of @xmath90 coincide with roots of @xmath74 ; @xmath91 and @xmath92 are @xmath93-degree polynomials , @xmath93 can be 3,4 or 5 ; all unknown parameters can be found from an interpolation procedure .",
    "we allow a relative error of interpolation to be @xmath94 for each period .",
    "the function @xmath90 can be immediately integrated with the required accuracy . in this way we made integration up to @xmath95 with absolute accuracy up to @xmath96 .     at @xmath97 as a function of @xmath98.,width=340 ]    with the help of the above procedure",
    "we obtain a table of contributions from integration over each period , extrapolate this table to infinity , and after that we find the full integral in as a sum of the negative integral over first period(s ) , a multitude of positive integrals over periods up to @xmath95 and an interpolation term .",
    "the absolute accuracy of the obtained result is @xmath99 .",
    "it should be noted that nearly 99 % of the integral value in is obtained by direct calculation and only nearly one percent is the contribution from the interpolation .",
    "at @xmath100 as a function of @xmath98.,width=340 ]    dimensionless quantity @xmath78 is a function of two dimensionless parameters , @xmath101 and @xmath102 . using the above described procedure , we calculate @xmath78 at several values of @xmath101 as a function of dimensionless distance from the edge of the vortex , @xmath103 , in the range @xmath104",
    ". further increase of the distance from the vortex results in a significant increment of computational time , because there the envelope of @xmath74 fails to be a sufficiently decreasing function as it is at smaller distances .",
    "the results of our numerical calculations are presented in figs.37 , where @xmath78 is along the ordinate axis and @xmath98 is along the abscissa axis ; solid lines are interpolating the dots that have been calculated .     at @xmath105 as a function of @xmath98.,width=340 ]    the typical behaviour of @xmath78 is clearly illustrated in cases @xmath106 by fig.3 and fig.4 the vacuum energy density is zero at the edge of the vortex ( at @xmath107 ) , starts increasing by some power law @xmath108 with @xmath109 , reaches maximum at @xmath110 , and decreases at larger distances to zero ( probably exponentially as @xmath111 ) .",
    "however , as @xmath101 decreases , the available range of @xmath98 is shrunk due to above mentioned restriction @xmath112 . in the case of @xmath105 a maximum at @xmath110 is clearly seen ( fig.5 ) , and a following decrease to zero may be anticipated . in the cases of @xmath113 ( fig.6 ) and @xmath114 ( fig.7 )",
    "one may suppose that there will be a maximum at @xmath110 and a following decrease to zero .",
    "but , one can be sure for certain from figs.37 that the vacuum energy density decreases to zero as @xmath108 with @xmath109 at @xmath115 .     at @xmath113 as a function of @xmath98.,width=340 ]    as to values of the vacuum energy density , they are rapidly decreasing as parameter @xmath101 increases and becomes more than unity .",
    "namely , the maximal values of @xmath78 are : @xmath116 at @xmath105 ( fig.5 ) , @xmath117 at @xmath100 ( fig.4 ) and @xmath118 at @xmath97 ( fig.3 ) .",
    "these should be compared with much larger values which are already attained below maxima in fig.6 and fig.7 : @xmath119 at @xmath113 and @xmath120 at @xmath114 .",
    "it should be noted that , in the case of the singular vortex ( @xmath121 ) , the maximal value of @xmath78 is @xmath122 @xcite ; the appropriate plot of @xmath78 as a function of @xmath102 is taken from @xcite and is presented in fig.8 .",
    "thus , one may suppose that , in the case of the vortex with thickness in the range @xmath123 , the maximal value of @xmath78 will be somewhere in the range @xmath124 .",
    "for more clarity , the results of fig.6 and fig.7 are plotted as functions of variable @xmath125 in fig.9 .",
    "note that , as @xmath101 falls by three orders from @xmath126 to @xmath127 , quantity @xmath78 changes by factor @xmath128 only .",
    "this should be compared with @xmath78 at @xmath129 , which is plotted as a function of @xmath130 in fig.10 ; the latter plot coincides actually with that corresponding to @xmath114 in fig.9 .",
    "it should be noted also that at sufficiently small distances from the vortex edge ( at @xmath131 ) the behaviour of @xmath78 coincides with that in the @xmath129 case .     at @xmath114 as a function of @xmath98.,width=340 ]     at @xmath132 as a function of @xmath102.,width=340 ]",
    "we have studied the influence of finite thickness of the impenetrable magnetic vortex on the vacuum polarization of the quantized charged massive scalar field . since units @xmath133 are used , the london flux value is @xmath45 , and we show that induced vacuum energy density is periodic in the value of vortex flux @xmath16 , vanishing at integer multiples of the london flux value ( at @xmath134 ) and being presumably maximal at half of the london flux value ( at @xmath135 ) .",
    "if the vortex thickness decreases , @xmath136 , or a distance from the vortex increases , @xmath137 , then the contribution of @xmath52 and @xmath138 to tends smoothly to zero , and the vacuum energy density converges with that induced by the singular magnetic vortex",
    ".     at the smallest values of @xmath101 as a function of @xmath130.,width=340 ]    our numerical analysis of the vortex thickness effects has been carried out for the case of the vortex flux equal to half of the london flux value ; the quantized scalar field is confined to a plane which is orthogonal to the vortex .",
    "as follows from this analysis , the vacuum polarization actually disappears , when the transverse size of the vortex @xmath139 exceeds the compton wavelength of the scalar particle @xmath140 : the maximal value of the induced vacuum energy density falls by two orders from @xmath141 to @xmath142 as @xmath101 increases from @xmath143 to @xmath144 .",
    "this result should be compared with the influence of the vortex thickness on the conventional bohm - aharonov effect . in the framework of first - quantized theory ,",
    "one considers elastic scattering of a quantum - mechanical charged particle on the impenetrable magnetic vortex of thickness @xmath22 .",
    "the incident wave is characterized by momentum @xmath145 , so the dimensionless parameter of the problem is @xmath146 . in the long - wavelength limit , @xmath147",
    ", scattering converges with scattering on the singular magnetic vortex @xcite .",
    "since the short - wavelength limit , @xmath148 , corresponds to the case when quasi - classical approximation is applicable , one would anticipate that the purely quantum effect , as is the bohm - aharonov one , disappears in this limit . as has been shown in @xcite , this anticipation",
    "is indeed confirmed , and scattering in the @xmath148 limit converges with scattering of a classical point particle on the impenetrable tube , being independent of the enclosed magnetic flux .    in the framework of second - quantized theory ,",
    "one considers the vacuum polarization in the background of the impenetrable magnetic vortex .",
    "the appropriate dimensionless parameter is @xmath101 , and , as we have shown in the present paper , the casimir - bohm - aharonov effect disappears in the @xmath149 limit , becoming actually negligible at @xmath150 .    in the case of the singular magnetic vortex ,",
    "the induced vacuum energy density diverges at the location of the vortex @xcite .",
    "as it has been shown in the present paper , this divergence is unphysical , disappearing when thickness of the impenetrable magnetic vortex is taken into account : under the dirichlet condition for the quantized field , the induced vacuum energy density is vanishing as @xmath151 with @xmath109 at the edge of the vortex .",
    "therefore , the vacuum energy which is induced on the whole transverse plane , @xmath152 is finite , contrary to the case of the singular vortex when it is infinite .",
    "although we are unaware of the value of @xmath153 , the maximal value of @xmath154 is estimated to be somewhat of the order of @xmath155 if @xmath156 .",
    "a brief discussion of polarization of the vacuum of the quantized massless scalar field is in order . in this case , the induced vacuum energy density is zero at the edge of the vortex , starts increasing as @xmath151 with @xmath109 ( see fig.10 ) , reaches its maximum and then decreases with asymptotics @xmath157 @xcite . induced vacuum energy is finite in this case also .     at @xmath129 as a function of @xmath130.,width=340 ]    the finite - thickness vortex can be formed as a topological defect appearing after a phase transition with spontaneous breakdown of the gauge symmetry @xcite .",
    "such a structure under the name of a cosmic string @xcite is currently discussed in various contexts in cosmology and astrophysics , see , e.g. , @xcite . the cosmic string is characterized by flux @xmath158 , where @xmath159 is the coupling constant of the higgs scalar field to the string - forming gauge field ; the transverse size of the string is of the order of correlation length @xmath160 , where @xmath161 is the mass of the higgs scalar field .",
    "then , as it follows from our consideration in the present paper , the cosmic string can polarize the vacuum of quantum matter only in the case when the mass of the matter field is much less than that of the higgs field , @xmath162 .",
    "for instance , the cosmic string which is formed at the grand unification scale can polarize the vacuum of the electroweak theory , whereas the would - be cosmic string corresponding to the electroweak symmetry breaking has no impact on the vacuum of quantum matter at the grand unification scale .",
