    "recently there has been considerable progress both in the visualization ( bednar et al . ,",
    "1998 ) and micromanipulation ( cui and bustamante , 2000 ) of chromatin fibers .",
    "these results constitute an important step towards the understanding of dna  folding  , i.e. , the problem of how plant and animal genomes organize themselves into volumes whose linear dimensions are many orders of magnitude smaller than their contour lengths .",
    "for instance , human dna is billions of base pairs ( bp ) long ( about a meter ) , this length of highly - charged ( about one fundamental charge per two angstroms ) and hard - to - bend ( persistence length of @xmath0 ) linear polymer must be condensed into chromosomes that fit into cell nuclei whose characteristic size is a _",
    "micron_.    an important part of the condensation process is the complexation of dna with oppositely - charged globular protein ( histone ) aggregates that have the shape of squat cylinders .",
    "these aggregates are octameric complexes consisting of pairs of the four core histones h2a , h2b , h3 , and h4 .",
    "a dna stretch of 147 bp s is wrapped in a @xmath1-@xmath2and-@xmath3 left - handed superhelical turn around the histone octamer and is connected via a stretch of ",
    "dna to the next such protein spool .",
    "each protein aggregate together with its wrapped dna comprises a _",
    "nucleosome core particle _",
    "( cf . fig .",
    "1 ) with a radius of about 5 nm and a height of about 6 nm ; with its linker dna it is the fundamental chromatin repeating unit .",
    "it carries a large negative electrostatic charge ( khrapunov et al . , 1997",
    "; raspaud et al . , 1999 ) . whereas the structure of the core particle has been resolved up to high atomic resolution ( luger et al . ,",
    "1997 ) , there is still considerable controversy about the nature of the higher - order structures to which they give rise . when stretched , the string of dna / histone complexes has the appearance of  beads - on - a - string  .",
    "this basic structure can be seen clearly when chromatin is exposed to very low salt concentrations , and is known as the 10-_nm fiber _ ( thoma et al . , 1979 ) , since the diameter of the core particle is @xmath4 . with increasing salt concentration",
    ", i.e. , heading towards physiological conditions ( @xmath5 ) , this fiber appears to thicken , attaining a diameter of @xmath6 ( widom , 1986 ) .",
    "the absence of the extra ",
    " ( h1 or h5 ) leads to more open structures ( thoma et al .",
    ", 1979 ) so it is surmised that the linker histones act near the entry - exit point of the dna ( cf . fig .",
    "1 ) ; they carry an overall positive charge and seem to bind the two strands together leading to a stem formation ( bednar et al .",
    "increasing the salt - concentration is expected to decrease the entry - exit angle of the stem as it reduces the electrostatic repulsion between the two strands",
    ".    longstanding controversy ( van holde , 1989 ; widom , 1989 ; van holde and zlatanova , 1995 , 1996 ) surrounds the structure of this 30_-nm fiber _ , for which there are mainly two competing classes of models : the solenoid models ( finch and klug , 1976 ; thoma et al . , 1979",
    "; widom and klug , 1985 ) ; and the zig - zag or crossed - linker models ( woodcock et al . , 1993 ; horowitz et al . , 1994 ; leuba et al . , 1994 ; bednar et al . ,",
    "1998 ) . in the solenoid model ( fig .",
    "2a ) it is assumed that the chain of nucleosomes forms a helical structure with the axis of the core particles being perpendicular to the solenoid axis ( the axis of an octamer corresponds to the axis of the superhelical path of the dna that wraps around it ) .",
    "the dna entry - exit side faces inward towards the axis of the solenoid . the linker dna ( shown as a dashed curve at the top of fig .",
    "2a ) is required to be bent in order to connect neighboring nucleosomes in the solenoid .",
    "the other class of models posits _ straight _ linkers that connect nucleosomes located on _ opposite _ sides of the fiber .",
    "this results in a three - dimensional zig - zag - like pattern of the linker ( fig .",
    "images obtained by electron cryomicroscopy should in principle be able to distinguish between the structural features proposed by the different models mentioned above ( bednar et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "the micrographs show a zig - zag motif at lower salt concentrations and they indicate that the chromatin fiber becomes more and more compact when the ionic strength is raised towards the physiological value . however , for these denser fibers it is still not possible to detect the exact linker geometry .",
    "an important experimental achievement was the stretching of a single chromatin fiber via micromanipulation ( cui and bustamante , 2000 ) .",
    "the  force - extension  measurements show a rich behavior of the mechanical properties as a function of the ionic strength . at low ionic strength ( @xmath7 nacl )",
    "the force - extension curves are reversible as long as the tension does not exceed @xmath8 . for higher tension levels ( @xmath9 )",
    "there are irreversible changes that lead to an increase of the fiber length , probably due to the loss of linker histones and/or histone octamers . at high ionic strength ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 nacl ) a @xmath12-plateau in the force extension curve",
    "was found which would lead to extensive irreversibility in the force - extension curve .",
    "although irreversibility is encountered at high force levels , as mentioned , the @xmath12 plateau is reversible indicating that there was no nucleosomal loss . ] .",
    "the authors interpreted their results as indicating a coexistence between  swollen  and  condensed  parts of the fiber . in order to reproduce the force - extension curves , katritch et al .",
    "performed monte carlo simulations ( katritch et al .",
    ", 2000 ) based on a geometrical  two - angle  model introduced by woodcock et al . for the 30-nm fiber ( woodcock et al . , 1993 ) combined with the worm - like chain (  wlc  ) hamiltonian for the linkers .",
    "the wlc is widely used for predicting the mechanical properties of _ naked _ dna .",
    "the low - salt behavior could be reproduced for several sets of angles and bond lengths of the model , demonstrating both that it is a reasonable model and that it is not possible to deduce a unique structure from the measured response of the fiber under stretching .",
    "katritch et al .",
    "found that an internucleosomal attraction of roughly @xmath13 might explain the experimentally observed plateau in the force - extension profile .",
    "the biological importance of these results lies in the fact that significant changes can be achieved in the degree of chromatin condensation with only modest levels of external stress .",
    "the fact that chromatin at physiological salt concentrations apparently can exist in two alternative forms that interconvert under low levels of stress is particularly interesting .",
    "the success of the model motivated the present study to provide an _ analytical _",
    "framework for understanding the geometrical and mechanical properties of the 30-nm fiber based on the two - angle model .",
    "our first main result is the derivation of a general structural phase diagram of the chromatin fiber as a function of the two basic angles @xmath14 and @xmath15 determined by the nucleosome properties and the linker length @xmath16 ( see below ) .",
    "the various solenoidal , zig - zag and crossed - linker structures  all of which are assumed to have straight linkers  appear as ",
    "points  in this phase diagram ( see fig .",
    "we find that , within the two - angle model , the position of chromatin fibers at physiological conditions ( the  native  fibers ) in the phase diagram is surprisingly close to the point in the diagram with the _ highest density _ and the _ maximal accessibility _ , consistent with excluded - volume restrictions .",
    "changes in bond angles induced by physico - chemical changes in the environment lead to predictable changes of the fiber away from this optimal point towards more open structures .",
    "our second main result is that we can obtain approximate analytical results for the bending stiffness of the two - angle model  and hence for the persistence length  and for the force - extension curve .",
    "we find ( _ i _ ) that the persistence length of the fiber should be comparable or less than that of naked dna , for a wide range of @xmath14- and @xmath15-values and ( _ ii _ ) that the stretching modulus should be so low that there is no longer a pronounced difference between  soft  entropic elasticity ( for low forces ) and  hard  entropic elasticity ( for high forces ) , in marked contrast with the case of naked dna . using the estimated values of @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 the predicted force - extension curves ( _ with no fitting parameter _ ) are in good agreement with the data found for the stretching of chromatin fibers ( cui and bustamante , 2000 ) .",
    "the implication of our results is that a swollen 30-nm fiber should be very _ soft _ in terms of its elastic properties , over a wide range of values of the angle parameter @xmath14 and @xmath15 , a very reasonable  design feature  in terms of its biological role .",
    "this swollen state competes with a more rigid condensed state that appears , as a function of bond angle @xmath17 , when we allow for ( weak ) attractive forces between nucleosomes .",
    "the physical properties of the condensed state are beyond the scope of the current paper , but the condensed fiber is expected to be significantly stiffer that the swollen fiber . in general , our results appear to indicate that the  engineering design  of the 30-nm fiber combines high compaction levels with high structural accessibility and flexibility .",
    "independent of the question whether the swollen or the condensed state is realized , modest changes in the control parameter @xmath18 ( the nucleosome entry - exit angle ) produce large structural changes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the section 2",
    "we derive the geometrical properties of the two - angle model and present the general diagram of states . in section 3",
    "we apply our results of the two - angle model to interpret the structure of the 30-nm chromatin fiber in terms of simple optimization principles .",
    "section 4 derives the elastic properties of the two - angle model and gives the bending stiffness and the force - extension relation . in the concluding section",
    "we summarize our results and discuss alternative models .",
    "to address the folding problem of dna at the level of the 30-nm fiber we need a mathematical description for the different possible folding pathways . at the simplest level",
    ", it is assumed that the geometric structure of the 30-nm fiber can be obtained from the intrinsic , single - nucleosome structure .",
    "the specific roles of linker elastic energy , nucleosome - nucleosome interaction , preferred binding sites , h1 involvement , etc . will be treated afterwards as ",
    "corrections  to this basic model . to see how single - nucleosome properties can control the fiber geometry , consider the fact that dna is wrapped a non - integral number of turns around the nucleosome , e.g. , 1-and-@xmath19 times ( 147 bp s ) in the case of no h1 .",
    "this implies that the incoming and outgoing linker chains make an angle @xmath14 with respect to each other  the entry - exit angle @xmath18 is nonzero . in the presence of the histone h1 ( or h5 ) the in- and outcoming linker are in close contact forming a stem before they diverge ( bednar et al . , 1998 ) . while the precise value of the resulting exit - angle depends on salt concentration , degree of acetylation of the histones , etc .",
    ", we may nevertheless assume @xmath14 to be a quantity _ that is determined purely at the single - nucleosome level_. next , we define the rotational ( dihedral ) angle @xmath15 between the axis of neighboring histone octamers along the necklace ( see fig .",
    "because nucleosomes are rotationally positioned along the dna , i.e. , adsorption of dna always begins with the minor groove turned in towards the first histone binding site , the angle @xmath20 is a _ periodic _ function of the linker length @xmath16 , with the @xmath21 repeat length of the helical twist of dna as the period .",
    "there is experimental evidence that the linker length shows a preferential quantization involving a set of values that are related by integral multiples of this helical twist ( widom , 1992 ) , i.e. , there is a preferred value of @xmath15 .",
    "( note that the  linker length ",
    "@xmath16 is strictly speaking defined here as the distance between two neighboring nucleosomes , cf .",
    "if we treat the pair of angles @xmath22 , together with the linker length @xmath16 , as given physical properties ( even though in vivo they are likely under biochemical control ) , then the geometrical structure of the necklace is determined entirely by @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the model only describes linker geometry and does not account for excluded volume effects and other forms of nucleosome - nucleosome interaction ; it assumes that the core particles are pointlike ( @xmath23 ) and that they are located at the joints of the linkers .",
    "the model also assumes that the linkers are _ straight_. it is under dispute whether this last condition holds for the 30-nm fiber at higher salt concentrations , and we will return to this issue later .",
    "the @xmath22-model is similar to the freely rotating chain model encountered in polymer physics literature ( see , for instance , doi and edwards , 1986 ) .",
    "the main difference is that in the present case there is no free rotation around the linker and so torsion is transmitted ( see also plewa and witten , 2000 ) .",
    "as shown in appendix a it is now possible to construct a spiral of radius @xmath24 and pitch angle @xmath25 such that the nucleosomes - but not necessarily the linker chain - are located on this spiral .",
    "the nucleosomes are placed along the spiral in such a way that successive nucleosomes have a fixed ( euclidean ) distance @xmath16 from one another . from straightforward geometrical considerations we can derive analytical expressions that relate pitch angle @xmath26 and radius @xmath24 of the solenoid to the pair of angles @xmath14 , @xmath20 and linker length @xmath16 .",
    "specifically the linker length @xmath16 can be expressed as a function of @xmath25 , @xmath24 and @xmath27 ( defined as the vertical distance between successive ",
    "nucleosomes  along the helical axis ) , @xmath28 , as given by eq .",
    "the corresponding relationships for the angles @xmath14 and @xmath15 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , are given by eq .",
    "[ cost ] and eq .",
    "[ cosf ] . using these relations",
    ", we can construct a catalog of structures .      if either one of the angles @xmath14 or @xmath15 assumes the value @xmath31 or @xmath32 , then the resulting structure is _ planar _ , and",
    "calculation of the associated geometrical properties is straightforward .",
    "let us start with the case @xmath33 .",
    "if we also have @xmath34 the fiber forms a straight line ( see structure  1  in fig .",
    "4 ) . for small",
    "non - vanishing @xmath14 the structure forms a _ circle _ of radius @xmath35 .",
    "for the special case @xmath36 , with @xmath37 an integer , the ring contains @xmath37 monomers before it repeats itself and we obtain a _ regular polygon _",
    "( see  2  ) .",
    "the special case is @xmath38 corresponds to the square (  3  ) . with increasing @xmath14 the radius of the circle shrinks and approaches asymptotically the value @xmath39 .",
    "for @xmath40 with @xmath37 being an odd integer one encounters a series of closed _ star - like polygons _ with @xmath37 tips .",
    "in particular , @xmath41 corresponds to the equilateral triangle (  4  ) , @xmath42 to the regular pentagram (  5  ) , etc .",
    "next we consider the case @xmath43 and @xmath14 arbitrary .",
    "this case corresponds to 2d _ zig - zag - like structures _ , as shown by  6  and  7  at the top of fig .",
    "the length of a fiber consisting of @xmath44 monomers is given by @xmath45 and the diameter is given by @xmath46 .",
    "note that the length of the fiber increases with decreasing @xmath14 .    to complete our discussion of planar structures we mention the remaining cases : @xmath34 with an arbitrary value of @xmath15 leads to the straight line mentioned earlier (  1  ) ; @xmath47 and arbitrary @xmath15 corresponds to linkers that go back and forth between two positions (  8  ) .",
    "( _ i _ ) _ solenoids _ :",
    "for small angles , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , we find structures that resemble solenoids where the linkers themselves follow closely a helical path ( see  9  in fig .",

    "other geometrical information can be obtained easily .",

    "if we move from the line @xmath99 towards larger values of @xmath15 the circles and star - like polygons stretch out into the direction perpendicular to their plane , forming a solenoid and a fiber with crossed linkers , respectively . on the other hand , if we start at the top of the diagram ( @xmath43 ) and decrease the value of @xmath15 the planar zig - zag structure extends into the third dimension by becoming twisted . if we start with a structure with entry - exit angle @xmath100 and increase the value of this angle , then the structure folds either into a solenoid with large pitch angle for small @xmath15-value or into a twisted zig - zag for large values of @xmath15 .",

    "we calculate here the effect of linker _ flexibility _ on the persistence length of the two - angle fiber .",
