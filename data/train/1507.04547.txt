    "the topic of a massive white dwarf accreting hydrogen - rich material from a non - degenerate companion and processing that material into heavier elements on its surface is of relevance to the understanding of a number of astrophysical objects , including symbiotics ( e.g. @xcite ) and single - degenerate type ia supernova progenitors ( e.g. @xcite ) . in the the case of the single - degenerate scenario ,",
    "the accretion process is necessary for the white dwarf to grow in mass until it becomes massive enough to undergo thermonuclear runaway in its degenerate core and explode .",
    "the steady burning of accreted hydrogen - rich material on the surface of a massive white dwarf is believed to be possible only in a narrow interval of mass - accretion rates ( @xcite ) , and the process is expected to emit copious amounts of super - soft x - rays @xcite .",
    "however , several studies have established a discrepancy of one to two orders of magnitude between the expected and observed number of systems , as well as the integrated luminosities of super - soft x - ray sources in old galactic populations , provided type ia supernova progenitors are in fact single - degenerates @xcite .",
    "the missing super - soft x - ray sources could perhaps be explained if the x - ray emitting systems were obscured by local material .",
    "there is growing evidence for the presence of circumstellar material around at least a subset of type ia supernova , as inferred from supernova spectra ( @xcite ) , as well as from historical supernova remnants @xcite    circumstellar material around type ia supernova progenitors could be supplied in a variety of ways , e.g. by a wind from either of the binary components , stellar pulsations of the companion , incomplete accretion of wind - roche lobe overflow @xcite or tidal interactions between the components @xcite .",
    "the effect of circumstellar obscuration on the observability of super - soft x - ray emission from progenitor systems was investigated by @xcite .",
    "both studies suggested that relatively modest amounts of circumstellar material could obscure super - soft x - ray sources to the point where they would no longer be detectable with current x - ray telescopes .",
    "however , both studies either ignored or used rather simple assumptions concerning the effect of photo - ionisation of the circumstellar material , and specifically did not take photo - ionisations of metals into account .",
    "the present study seeks to remedy those shortcomings by conducting a full treatment of the photo - ionisation of the obscuring circumstellar material , to get a more accurate handle on how much circumstellar material is required for obscuration .",
    "the reader should note the terminology used in the following : _ mass - transfer rate _ denotes the rate of mass transferred from the donor to the accretor , regardless of whether the transferred material is retained on the accretor , whereas _ mass - accretion rate _  or just accretion rate  is the rate of material transferred _ and _ retained on the accretor ; lastly , _ mass - loss rate _ refers to the rate of mass lost from the binary into the circumbinary region where it may obscure the super - soft x - ray source .",
    "we use the symbol @xmath0 for the latter .",
    "in section [ sect : model ] we describe our model , section [ sect : results ] presents the results of our calculations , while section [ sect : discussion ] discusses the implications of the results .",
    "section [ sect : conclusion ] concludes .",
    "the geometry of the model examined in this study is identical to the one considered in @xcite .",
    "the primary difference between that study and the present one is the incorporation of full photo - ionisation calculations . in particular , we consider a super - soft x - ray source inside a spherically symmetric shell of material , surrounded by vacuum . throughout the following , we assume that the source is a blackbody , with effective temperature @xmath1 between 30 ev and 150 ev , and luminosities @xmath2 between @xmath3 erg / s and @xmath4 erg / s , parameters characteristic of canonical , persistent super - soft x - ray sources @xcite .",
    "the gas shell surrounding the source is defined by an inner and outer boundary ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively ) , and the density is given by an @xmath7-law , characteristic of spherically symmetric , constant - velocity wind mass loss : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the mass density as a function of radius , @xmath0 is the mass - loss rate into the circumstellar region and @xmath10 is the velocity of the wind , assumed to be constant in the region of interest . inside the inner and outside",
    "the outer boundaries we assume vacuum . the inner radius can be envisioned as equivalent to the orbital radius of the binary ( see also sections [ sect : results ] & [ subsect : caveats ] ) .",
    "realistic density profiles are likely to be more complex than this , and clearly depend on the mass - loss history of the binary , however , the simple @xmath7 profile is a useful first approximation and also facilitates comparison with previous results .",
    "the total mass of the gas shell is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the mass loss rate in units of @xmath13 m@xmath14 , @xmath15 is the outflow velocity in units of 100 km / s and @xmath16 is the outer radius of the shell in astronomical units .    the column density of the gas shell is : @xmath17 where @xmath18 for solar abundance , and @xmath19 is the mass of the proton .",
    "a column density of @xmath20 @xmath21 of neutral material of solar abundance can easily obscure emission from a super - soft source with temperature of @xmath22 ev , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "however , photo - ionisation of the wind material by the emission from the super - soft source can significantly reduce its opacity .",
    "similar to the classical strmgren sphere problem , the effect of the photo - ionisation can be estimated , to the first approximation , by comparing the total rates of photo - ionisation and recombination in the gas shell : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the photo - ionisation threshold of the main absorbing ion , @xmath25 its recombination coefficient , @xmath26 is the luminosity of the central source and the factor @xmath27 depends on its radiation spectrum . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rate_i ] ) , it was assumed that the gas shell is optically thick to the radiation of the central source ( in the absence of photo - ionisation ) . if the photo - ionisation rate @xmath28 exceeds the recombination rate @xmath29 , the shell material will be fully ionised and therefore transparent to the radiation of the central source .",
    "the critical value of the mass outflow rate is determined by the condition @xmath30 . at lower @xmath0 the gas shell is fully ionised and transparent , whereas at higher outflow rates it is opaque to the radiation of the central source . for monoatomic hydrogen gas ,",
    "the value of the critical outflow rate can be computed straighforwardly ; with @xmath31 ev and @xmath32 @xmath33sec@xmath34 ( case b ) one obtains : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the luminosity in units of @xmath4 erg / s . for the central source temperature of @xmath37 ev , for example , @xmath38 and the leading factor in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mdot_crit_h ] ) becomes @xmath39 m@xmath14 .",
    "( [ eq : mdot_crit_h ] ) is sufficiently accurate for hydrogen gas shell , but gives only an order of magnitude estimate for gas of solar abundance .",
    "the latter case requires a more careful account of the ionisation state of the main absorbing species .",
    "however , eq . ( [ eq : mdot_crit_h ] ) predicts a nearly correct scaling of the critical mass loss rate ( as confirmed by cloudy calculations in the following sections ) : @xmath40 as one can see from eq .",
    "( [ eq : mdot_crit ] ) , the critical mass loss rate relatively weakly depends on the luminosity of the central source and the inner radius of the shell and is nearly insensitive to the outer radius of the shell ( for sufficiently large @xmath41 ) .",
    "the latter should be expected , given the steepness of the assumed density profile .",
    "the above considerations strictly apply to a stationary gas shell . in the case of the wind",
    ", ( presumably ) neutral material is continuously added at the inner edge of the shell .",
    "it is promptly s. ] photo - ionised by the radiation from the central source . however , if the new material is added at a sufficiently large rate  i.e. one comparable to the photon injection rate",
    " it will screen the rest of the shell from the ionising radiation , thus reducing its degree of ionisation and increasing its opacity .",
    "the importance of advection is determined by the ratio of the rate at which new material is added to the inner edge of the shell to the injection rate of ionising photons : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the factor @xmath27 in units of @xmath44 . the ratio given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : adv ] ) becomes of the order of unity at @xmath45 m@xmath14 , which is much larger than the mass outflow rates considered here .          for detailed photo - ionisation calculations",
    ", we used the one - dimensional photo - ionisation code cloudy , version 13.02 ( for a detailed description of the latest release of cloudy see @xcite ) .",
    "cloudy calculates the ionisation and thermal state of a cloud of gas that is irradiated by a central source , by simultaneously solving equations of photo - ionisation and thermal equilibrium .",
    "it is assumed that atomic processes in the gas have become time - steady .",
    "this assumption is reasonable , at least in the context of single - degenerate type ia supernova progenitors , since all microphysical time scales in the shell are much shorter than time scales relevant to super - soft sources .",
    "in our simulations , we fix the density distribution and compute the gas temperature self - consistently , as maintained by the photo - ionisation of the gas by the central source . for the gas density distribution , we use the built - in ` dlaw wind ` option in cloudy which reproduces the density structure in eq .",
    "( [ eq : density.structure.from.wind ] ) , and the sphere keyword as appropriate for a closed geometry . the advection effects are not included in our calculations , as justified above .",
    "cloudy s output files specify the emergent spectrum , temperature , pressure , and ionisation structure , in addition to a host of other data .",
    "we run cloudy for three values of @xmath10 : 10 , 50 , 100 km / s .",
    "this spans the likely wind velocities expected from red giant and asymptotic giant star donors @xcite . for the purposes of this study we do not specify the nature of the wind . for each combination of @xmath2 , @xmath1 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath10",
    "we run cloudy for a range of values of @xmath0 from @xmath46 m@xmath47 to @xmath48 m@xmath47 .",
    "the chemical composition of the material in the shell is solar , as given in @xcite . in subsection",
    "[ subsect : dependence.on.chemical.abundances ] we compare this with the abundances used in @xcite .    for hydrogen and helium , cloudy can be expected to give reliable results up to @xmath49 @xmath50 . however , for number densities @xmath51 @xmath50 the full treatment of a plasma containing heavier elements should not be considered reliable , see the cloudy manual hazy. for comparison , the largest value of @xmath0 for which one of our plots have data points ( @xmath48 m@xmath52/yr at @xmath53 au and @xmath54 km / s on figure [ fig : emission_line_luminosities_vs_mdot ] ) corresponds to the number density of @xmath55 @xmath50 , i.e. within the nominal density range of cloudy .",
    "cloudy s output can be used to reconstruct the spectrum of the system consisting of the super - soft x - ray source and circumstellar cloud , along with the ionisation structure of the circumstellar material . in the following ,",
    "we use the term _ output spectrum _ to mean the sum of the spectrum of transmitted radiation and the emission from the irradiated cloud . for the output data , we concentrate on the photon energy interval between 0.3 and 1.5 kev . below 0.3 kev ,",
    "even a modest ism column effectively blocks any super - soft emission , and above 1.5 kev the emitted energy of a super - soft x - ray source is negligible .    to quantify how the attenuation depends on the various input parameters",
    ", we calculated the integrated emitted super - soft luminosity @xmath26 of the output spectrum for each input configuration and compared this with the integrated emitted luminosity of the unabsorbed super - soft source spectrum , @xmath56 ( using the photon energy interval between 0.3 and 1.5 kev as integration limits ) .",
    "this yielded a transmission ratio @xmath57 between 1 ( no obscuration ) and 0 ( complete obscuration ) for each input configuration .      to demonstrate the general trends in our results , figure [ fig : absspectr_combined_1 - 10au ]",

    "shown the output spectrum is only weakly attenuated . for larger values of @xmath0",

    "the behaviour shown in figure [ fig : absspectr_combined_1 - 10au ] is qualitatively similar for other configurations of @xmath1 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath10 , although the critical mass - loss rate where obscuration becomes significant is of course different for different combinations of parameters . results of our calculations are summarised in figure [ fig : atten_comb ] where we show the attenuation curves as a function of the mass loss rate for different values of the source temperature and gas shell parameters .",
    "table [ table : nh_required_for_0.01_transmission ] gives the @xmath66 values required to produce an attenuation of a factor of @xmath67 .",

    "( [ eq : mdot_crit ] ) , the attenuation curve is moderately dependent on the value of the inner radius and nearly insensitive to the position of the outer boundary of the shell , as long as @xmath41 is sufficiently large .",

    "this is because the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : mdot_crit ] ) did not take collisional ionisation into account .",

    "as figure [ fig : atten_comb_50ev_gass10vsmm83 ] shows , the difference between the transmission curves computed for the two abundance tables is insignificant . for comparison ,",

    "the results presented above demonstrate the importance of the proper account for photo - ionisation when considering attenuation of super - soft x - ray sources by circumbinary material .",
    "in particular , the values of @xmath0 required for significant obscuration of a canonical super - soft x - ray source are about an order of magnitude larger than those reported in @xcite .",

    "the significantly larger mass - loss rates required for obscuration of the super - soft source provide a stronger constraint on the possibility of nuclear burning massive white dwarfs being hidden by absorption by local circumstellar material .",
    "for example , in @xcite it was suggested that for a 1 and 10 au inner and outer radius , and a wind velocity of 10 km / s it would be possible for a massive , steady - burning white dwarf accreting at a few times @xmath76 m@xmath47 to be more or less fully obscured if @xmath7710% of the material lost from the donor star did not become accreted onto the white dwarf but instead were available for obscuration in the circumstellar region . in the current study",
    ", we find for the same input values of parameters , that this amount of obscuration would require a mass loss into the circumstellar region of @xmath78% of the mass - transfer rate , i.e. the amount of material lost into the circumstellar region would have to be of the order as the material being accreted onto the white dwarf . for wind velocities of @xmath79 km",
    "/ s the circumstellar mass loss rate should exceed @xmath80% of the mass - transfer rate , i.e. @xmath81 times more material should be lost into the circumstellar space than be accreted on to the white dwarf . recalling",
    "that the steady - burning rate for a massive white dwarf is a few times @xmath76 m@xmath47 , this means that to sustain both the steady burning super - soft x - ray source and the obscuring envelope the donor would have to lose @xmath82 m@xmath47 for a @xmath83 years .",
    "the high mass - loss rate and the total mass lost ( around a solar mass or more ) constrains the population of possible donors , and hence binary systems capable of producing significantly obscured , super - soft x - ray sources that eventually reach the chandrasekhar mass and becomes type ia supernovae .",
    "although we considered here a specific case of the circumbinary wind , interpreted broadly , our results show that a canonical super - soft source is capable of ionising about @xmath84 @xmath21 of material located at the distance of a @xmath63 few astronomical units from the source ( table [ table : nh_required_for_0.01_transmission ] ) .    looking from a different perspective",
    ", a narrow but dense shell of gas with the hydrogen column density in excess of @xmath85 @xmath21 around a single - degenerate type ia supernova progenitor could conceivably obscure the super - soft x - ray emissions from such a system .",
    "because of the large velocities of supernova ejecta ( upwards of @xmath63 10,000 km / s  or @xmath63 5.8 au / day  for type ia supernovae ) such a shell would be overtaken by the ejecta within a matter of days .",
    "hence , upper limit measurements from e.g. radio observations would need to be made almost immediately after the supernova explosion to provide useful constraints on the amount of circumbinary material present at the @xmath63au distances from the supernova .",
    "the example of nearby sn2011fe is probably to be considered a best case in this respect , as it was discovered and subjected to follow - up observations almost immediately after exploding @xcite .",
    "even so , the radio limits placed on sn2011fe were based on observations conducted a little over two days after the supernova @xcite , which means that the blast wave would have moved to a distance of @xmath86 au ( assuming the above - mentioned ejecta velocity ) at the time observations began .",
    "hence , a very dense shell of material of , say , between 1 and 10 au from the exploding object may conceivably have eluded detection , as the supernova ejecta would have passed through the obscuring medium before observations began .",
    "more distant type ia supernovae are typically discovered several days to weeks after the explosion , and in such cases radio observations should not be expected to yield upper limits capable of ruling out narrow configurations of circumstellar material . however , since single - degenerate progenitors of type ia supernovae need to be super - soft x - ray sources for extended periods of time and require continuous mass - loss rates @xmath87 to remain hidden , the extent and mass of the circumstellar gas surrounding such sources could be much larger than the narrow configurations mentioned above and should therefore , theoretically at least , be detectable via post - supernova radio observations .",
    "also , such extended systems should be detectable in pre - supernova observations in the recombination lines of hydrogen and helium and forbidden lines of metals ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "although circumbinary obscuration is unlikely to explain the paucity of super - soft sources in the context of progenitors of type ia supernovae , it is plausible that stably nuclear - burning white dwarfs experience various degree of circumbinary obscuration . in particular , this may be one of the factors ( along with the reasons intrinsic to the population synthesis calculations ) explaining the discrepancy between the number of super - soft sources predicted in population synthesis studies and their observed numbers ( e.g. @xcite ) . while quenching the bulk of the x - ray emission from the stably nuclear - burning white dwarf , circumbinary obscuration leads to the appearance of various emission signatures at all wavelengths ( including x - ray band itself ) , which can be exploited to search and identify such obscured super - soft x - ray sources .",
    "figure [ fig : absspectr_combined_1 - 10au_long_wlengths ] shows the output spectrum of an attenuated super - soft x - ray source in the broad wavelength range from infrared to x - ray wavelengths .",
    "spectra for three values of the mass - loss rate @xmath0 are shown , corresponding to different obscuration levels in the x - ray band  from completely unobscured to completely obscured source ( cf .",
    "fig.[fig : atten_comb ] ) . in the completely unobscured case ,",
    "the gas in the wind is nearly fully ionised and optically thin , and the attenuation at these mass - loss rates is negligible ( save for a short period when the source initially turns on and ionises the cloud ) .",
    "such sources would be similar to naked super - soft sources when observed in x - rays , as discussed previously .",
    "in the obscured case , the soft x - ray radiation is reprocessed to the optical and uv bands , giving rise to copious emission lines . in the intermediate case of moderate obscuration",
    "a number of emission features can be observable in the x - ray band as well .",
    "x - ray lines , although not the brightest among the emission features in our calculations , can carry away up to @xmath88 of the luminosity of the central source . the brightest among them are resonant lines of h - like ions and he - like triplets of the low - z metals . in figure",
    "[ fig : xray_emission_line_luminosities_vs_mdot ] we show luminosities of several of the brightest x - ray lines as a function of the mass - loss rate . as the amount of the circumbinary material increases with the mass - loss rate , luminosities of these lines",
    "initially grow with @xmath0 , until obscuration in the x - ray region sets in at @xmath89 m@xmath52/yr ( see figure [ fig : atten_comb ] ) . at this point ,",
    "the x - ray line luminosities plummet due to absorption by the neutral outer layers of the wind .",
    "the behaviour of particular lines is mainly determined by the changes of relative abundances of respective ions , with the intrinsic line ratios being characteristic for photo - ionised plasma with ionisation parameter of @xmath90 . however , as the mass - loss rate approaches the critical value , the escaping line luminosities and their ratios are significantly modified by the absorption by the neutral outer part of the wind , giving rise to the patterns shown in fig.[fig : xray_emission_line_luminosities_vs_mdot ] .",
    "@xcite studied high - resolution spectra for a number of super - soft x - ray sources in local galaxies . based on these observations",
    ", they suggested a subdivision of super - soft x - ray sources into two classes : ssa ( absorbed ) and sse ( emitting )  the former having generally blackbody - like spectra with some prominent absorption features , and the latter showing strong emission features ( comparable in strength to the continuum ) superimposed on weak blackbody spectra . when correlated with the inclinations of the systems of that study ( and with the caveat that inclination determination is quite problematic in most of the cases ) members of the ssa class",
    "were predominantly high - inclination systems , while sse systems were predominantly viewed more edge - on .",
    "this led ness and collaborators to suggest that the spectral differences of the two classes might arise as a result of viewing - angle , rather than from intrinsic differences between the systems themselves , conceptually similar to the viewing - angle effect in the unified model for agns .",
    "although the direct comparison with observed spectra is outside the scope of the present work , our study does recreate several of the features of the sse class reported in @xcite in the interval where the central sources transition from unobscured to fully obscured regime .",
    "the two strongest emission features in the spectra of u sco and cal 87 on figure 3 in @xcite correspond to the o viii - doublet at 18.97 , 18.98 , and the line blend consisting of the n vii - doublet at 24.78 , 24.79 , and the n vi at 24.89 .",
    "we find the same features are prominent in our spectra , as seen on our figure [ fig : absspectr_combined_1 - 10au ] .",
    "several other , less pronounced lines in our spectra can be also found in the observed spectra of u sco and cal 87 , e.g. ne ix at 13.45 , o viii at 21.6 , and possibly three n vi lines around 29  ( 28.78 , 29.1 , 29.5 ) . at lower x - ray energies the similarities between our spectra and those of @xcite",
    "become less obvious , presumably due to interstellar absorption in the observed spectra .",
    "the fact that our relatively simple model setup can reproduce some of the features of the sse spectra disucssed in @xcite is not in itself surprising , since any model with significant incident luminosity in x - rays which interacts with a solar metallicity gas is likely to produce a somewhat similar set of emission features .",
    "however the luminosities of these lines , their ratios and the presence and strength of absorption lines and edges are determined by the details of the model such as geometry of the gas and emission pattern , ionisation parameter and chemical abundances . detailed analysis of these effects is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "as the mass - loss rate @xmath0 grows towards full obscuration , the x - ray emission is gradually quenched , and the absorbed energy increasingly re - emitted at uv and optical energies . in this regime ,",
    "copious emission lines in the uv , optical and infrared bands are produced in the photo - ionised wind material .",
    "the majority of these lines ( except for extreme uv lines ) , unlike x - ray lines , escape the wind material without significant attenuation and therefore may serve as a valuable diagnostic tool in the search for and identification absorbed super - soft sources .",

    "@xcite modelled the effect of persistent , unobscured , super - soft x - ray sources on the surrounding ( low density ) interstellar medium .",
    "their results showed that such sources should develop parsec - sized ionisation nebulae which should exhibit strong emission in forbidden optical lines , most importantly [ o iii ] 5008 , as well as in recombination lines of hydrogen and helium , including he ii 4686 .",

    "figure [ fig : rckm_compar_plot ] shows a comparison of the [ oiii ] 5007  and heii 4686   to h@xmath97 line ratios in the case of the obscuration by the wind with those expected from the ionisation nebulae computed by @xcite ( their figure 5 ) . as one can see from the plot , a super - soft source obscured by the dense wind considered in this work will be easily distinguishable from the case of the ionised nebula around a super - soft source imbedded in the low density ism .    to conclude , the observational signatures of a fully obscured super - soft x - ray sources should be significant ( up to @xmath101 erg / s for a @xmath4 erg / s source ) ly@xmath93 emission , coupled with the low [ oiii]-to - h@xmath97 ratio , of @xmath102 , and relatively high heii 4686 - to - h@xmath97 ratio , @xmath100 .",
    "these characteristics make obscured super - soft sources an observationally distinct class of compact line emission sources .     5007   and heii 4686  to h@xmath97 line ratios expected from the ionised nebulae in the low density ism ( rappaport et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , red triangles ) and the corresponding ratios expected for an obscured super - soft source imbedded in the dense wind considered in this work ( blue circles ) .",
    "the wind case was computed for our default model ( @xmath58 ev , @xmath103 erg / s , @xmath104 au ) ; the points shown are for @xmath0 values for which the [ oiii ] luminosity is non - negligible , i.e. @xmath105 m@xmath52/yr . ]",
    "the critical mass - loss rate at which obscuration of the central source becomes significant shows moderate dependence on the assumed inner radius of the wind .",
    "[ eq : mdot_crit_h ] predicts that @xmath106 , whereas numerical calculations with cloudy show marginally stronger scaling .",
    "the moderate @xmath107-dependence is a consequence of the two assumptions made in our calculations : ( i ) that the @xmath108 density profile extends to infinitely small radii and ( ii ) that the source of radiation is located in the locus of this density distribution , i.e. at the point @xmath109 .",
    "these two assumptions combined together lead to the strong dependence of the total recombination rate in the gas shell on its inner radius , eq.([eq : rate_i ] ) . to eliminate these assumptions , one would need to specify the driving mechanisms behind the mass loss and accurately consider the physical conditions at the inner wind boundary , which is far beyond the scope of this work .",
    "below we consider the example of symbiotic systems to attribute some physical meaning to the inner radius in our simulations .",
    "recent modelling of the red giant winds @xcite demonstrated that the @xmath108 density profile may indeed be a valid representation of the wind structure down to rather small radii , as low as @xmath630.1 au . the source of ionising radiation ( i.e. the white dwarf ) , however , is offset by the distance @xmath110 ( binary separation ) from the singular point of the gas distribution . in the absence of the singularity ,",
    "the dependence of the total recombination rate in the gas shell on its inner radius is insignificant ( as long as @xmath111 ) and the only role of the @xmath107 in this case is to provide the normalisation of the density distribution , via the mass continuity equation @xmath112 .",
    "therefore it is natural to set @xmath113 in this case , i.e. the inner radius is of the order of the orbital separation in the binary system .",
    "note also , that the 3-dimensional nature of the problem becomes essential at @xmath114 , as the red giant will be casting a shadow onto the wind material located behind it .",
    "obviously , the simplified 1-dimensional consideration in this paper is applicable only to the lines of sight which are not passing close to the donor star .    to conclude , while the picture of a spherical shell confined between the inner and outer boundaries is a simplification of the real geometry of a circumbinary gas cloud , our model is a useful first approximation .",
    "this is the geometry considered in the previous work @xcite and its use here facilitates comparison with those results and helps to isolate the effect of photo - ionisation .",
    "future work ( currently in progress ) will aim at dealing with more realistic density structures and source spectra than those discussed here .",
    "we have presented full photo - ionisation simulations of the interaction between the radiation from a super - soft x - ray source and a circumstellar cloud of solar metallicity gas .",
    "this seeks to model a single - degenerate system that has lost material from either the donor or the accretor into the circumstellar region .",
    "the aim has been to determine the amount of material ( parametrised by a circumstellar mass - loss rate ) required to significantly obscure the x - ray emission from the accretor .    to simulate the effect of the x - ray source on the gas cloud we used the one - dimensional photo - ionisation code cloudy @xcite .",
    "our analysis explored intervals of source temperature , luminosity , inner and outer radii of the gas cloud , and wind velocity , to cover the range of values for realistic systems .",
    "we found that the amount of circumstellar matter required to hide a super - soft x - ray source from our current observational capabilities is about an order of magnitude larger than that found in @xcite .",
    "in particular , the required mass - loss rates from the binary typically exceeds @xmath76 to a few times @xmath13 m@xmath14 for the parameters considered in the default case in this work . since the donor star has to provide both the material being accreted onto the white dwarf ( and hence powering its x - ray emission ) and the circumstellar material , this places significant constraints on the mass of the donor star .",
    "we discussed the observational appearance of hypothetical nuclear burning white dwarfs obscured by a wind .",
    "such systems would appear as luminous ( @xmath115 erg / s ) compact sources of ly@xmath93 emission with strong heii recombination lines ( heii 4686  to h@xmath97 ratio @xmath100 and suppressed forbidden lines of metals , e.g. [ oiii]-to - h@xmath97 ratio , of @xmath102 ) , making them distinct from photo - ionised nebulae predicted to exist around super - soft x - ray sources imbedded in the low density ism .",
