    "trautman spacetimes represent a class of expanding nontwisting and nonshearing solutions @xcite describing generalized black holes .",
    "various aspects of this family in four dimensions have been studied in the last two decades . in particular , the existence , asymptotic behaviour and global structure of _ vacuum _ robinson  trautman spacetimes of type  ii with spherical topology were investigated , most recently in the works of chruciel and singleton @xcite . in these rigorous studies , which were based on the analysis of solutions to the nonlinear robinson  trautman equation for generic , arbitrarily strong smooth initial data ,",
    "the spacetimes were shown to exist globally for all positive retarded times , and to converge asymptotically to a corresponding schwarzschild metric .",
    "interestingly , extension across the `` schwarzschild - like '' future event horizon can only be made with a finite order of smoothness .",
    "subsequently , these results were generalized in @xcite to the robinson ",
    "trautman vacuum spacetimes which admit a nonvanishing _ cosmological constant _ @xmath2 .",
    "these cosmological solutions settle down exponentially fast to a schwarzschild(anti-)de sitter solution at large times @xmath3 . finally , the chruciel ",
    "singleton analysis was extended to robinson - trautman spacetimes including matter , namely _ pure radiation _ @xcite .",
    "it was demonstrated that these solutions with pure radiation and a cosmological constant exist for any smooth initial data , and that they approach the spherically symmetric vaidya(anti-)de  sitter metric .    in @xcite ,",
    "trautman spacetimes ( containing aligned pure radiation and a cosmological constant @xmath2 ) were generalized to any dimension .",
    "the evolution is governed by a simpler equation in higher dimensions , contrary to the four - dimensional case where fourth order parabolic type robinson  trautman equation occurs . also , the possible algebraic types were determined .",
    "but still several interesting features deserve attention , the presence of horizons being among them . similarly to four dimensions , higher - dimensional robinson ",
    "trautman family of solutions contains several important special cases , e.g. schwarzschild  kottler  tangherlini black holes and generalizations of the vaidya metric .",
    "the study of higher - dimensional spacetimes and their features help to comprehend which properties survive the generalisation and which are closely tied to four dimensions , thus deepening the understanding of general relativity . lately",
    ", considerable interest in higher dimensions comes from outside of the purely relativistic community .",
    "our concern here is to locate the past ( white hole ) horizon . in general dynamical situations",
    "this might be rather nontrivial since the obvious candidate - event horizon - is a global characteristic and therefore the full spacetime evolution is necessary in order to localize it .",
    "therefore , over the past years different quasilocal characterizations of black hole boundary were developed .",
    "the most important ones being apparent horizon @xcite , trapping horizon @xcite and isolated or dynamical horizon @xcite .",
    "the basic _ local _ condition in the above mentioned horizon definitions is effectively the same : these horizons are sliced by marginally trapped hypersurfaces with vanishing expansion of outgoing ( ingoing ) null congruence orthogonal to the surface .",
    "quasilocal horizons are frequently used in numerical relativity for locating the black holes or in black hole thermodynamics .    for the vacuum four dimensional robinson ",
    "trautman solutions without cosmological constant the location of the horizon together with its general existence and uniqueness has been studied by tod @xcite .",
    "later , chow and lun @xcite analyzed some other useful properties of this horizon and made numerical study of both the horizon equation and robinson  trautman equation .",
    "these results were recently extended to nonvanishing cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "robinson  trautman spacetimes ( containing aligned pure radiation and a cosmological constant @xmath2 ) in any dimension were obtained in @xcite using the geometric conditions of the original articles about the four - dimensional version of the spacetime @xcite .",
    "namely , they required the existence of a twistfree , shearfree and expanding null geodesic congruence .",
    "they have arrived at the following metric valid in higher dimensions @xmath4 where @xmath5 .",
    "the unimodular spatial @xmath6-dimensional metric @xmath7 and the function @xmath8 must satisfy the field equation @xmath9 ( with @xmath10 being the rescaled metric ) and @xmath11 is a `` mass function '' ( we assume @xmath12 ) . in @xmath1",
    "the field equation is always satisfied and @xmath13 ( ricci scalar of the metric @xmath14 ) generally depends on @xmath15 .",
    "however , in @xmath0 the dependence on @xmath15 is ruled out ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "but generally , it still allows a huge variety of possible spatial metrics @xmath17 ( e.g. , for @xmath18 and @xmath19 an infinite number of compact einstein spaces were classified ) .",
    "the dynamics is also different in @xmath0 . while in four dimensions there is a fourth order robinson ",
    "trautman equation , the corresponding evolution equation is much easier in higher dimensions @xmath20 where function @xmath21 describes the aligned pure radiation .",
    "in our case , we will be dealing only with the condition of vanishing expansion defining the marginally trapped hypersurfaces .",
    "concretely , we will search for the past horizon similarly to previous studies in four dimensions and corresponding to the form of the metric containing retarded time .",
    "as will be clear later , we might call it _ trapping horizon _ or even _ dynamical horizon _ if it is spacelike , assuming appropriate higher - dimensional generalization of these notions ( see @xcite ) . in four - dimensional case",
    "the parabolic character of robinson  trautman equation makes it generally impossible to extend the spacetime to past null infinity ( the solutions of the robinson ",
    "trautman equation are generally diverging when approaching @xmath22 ) and it is impossible to define event horizon . in higher dimensions",
    "this is no longer truth ( the evolution equation is different ) but since one would like to investigate the horizon existence generically , without prior specification of all necessary functions ( e.g. dynamics of pure radiation ) and geometry of @xmath6-dimensional spatial hypersurfaces , the best approach is still using the quasilocal horizons . in figure",
    "[ fig ] , the schematic conformal picture of robinson  trautman spacetime ( for @xmath1 and without cosmological constant for simplicity ) is presented together with the approximate location of the horizons ( initial data are given at @xmath23 ) .     with @xmath24 and indicated past ( trapping ) horizon ( ph ) and event horizon ( eh ) . ]",
    "the explicit parametrization of the _ past horizon _",
    "hypersurface is @xmath25 such that its intersection with each @xmath26 slice is an outer marginally past trapped ( @xmath27)-surface .    for the calculation of the expansion of an appropriate null congruence we will use a straight - forward generalization of the tetrad formalism to arbitrary dimension .",
    "note that one can no longer use complex vector notation .",
    "using two null covectors @xmath28 ( with normalization @xmath29 ) and @xmath27 spatial covectors @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) we suppose the following decomposition of the metric @xmath32 null d - ad ( d - bein ) adapted to the trapped hypersurface ( using the above mentioned parametrization ) has the following form : @xmath33\\ , , { \\mathbf \\nabla } r\\right)\\label{d - ad}\\\\ m^{a}_{\\{i\\}}&=&\\left(0,\\,pr\\ , h({\\mathbf \\nabla}r,{\\mathbf w}_{i})\\,,{\\textstyle \\frac{1}{r}}{\\mathbf w}_{i}\\right)\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 vectors @xmath34 diagonalize metric @xmath14 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 denotes scalar product w.r.t.@xmath37 .",
    "fortunately , in subsequent calculations we do not need the explicit form of the vectors @xmath34 , it is sufficient to know their orthogonality properties .    by straight - forward computation one",
    "easily calculates the expansion associated with the congruence generated by @xmath38 to be @xmath39 meaning that the outgoing null congruence is diverging .",
    "this is exactly what one assumes when dealing with the past trapped surface and is the additional condition in the definition of trapping horizon @xcite .",
    "ingoing null congruence expansion can be calculated using the formula ( sometimes a @xmath6 factor is used in the definition , but we are going to evaluate it to zero anyway ) @xmath40 , where the tensor @xmath41 corresponds to the hypersurface projector . from @xmath42 (",
    "equivalent to penrose ",
    "tod equation in four dimensions ) we get the marginally trapped hypersurface condition @xmath43 @xmath44 it is a nonlinear second order partial differential equation , where both the laplacian and scalar product in the last term correspond to the einstein metric @xmath17 .",
    "interesting property of this equation is that for @xmath0 its nonlinearity is much worse since the term quadratic in derivatives appears .      in four - dimensional case",
    "one can no longer use the existence proof for equation ( [ pt ] ) given by tod @xcite when the cosmological constant is present .",
    "however , one can use the version of sub and super - solution method adapted to riemannian manifolds by isenberg @xcite and valid for equations of the form @xmath45 . for",
    "the proof of uniqueness one may use a straightforward modification of the original tod s proof @xcite incorporating the cosmological constant . using newmann - penrose equations one can also determine the character of the horizon as a three - dimensional hypersurface .",
    "these results ( for @xmath46 ) are derived in @xcite and summarized in the following table :    @xmath47{\\frac{3\\mu}{2\\lambda}}\\\\ \\hline \\mbox{spacelike or null } &   \\mbox{always } & \\mbox{always }   & r <",
    "\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{3\\mu}{2\\lambda}}\\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{array}\\ ] ]    the restrictions for the positive cosmological constant can be easily understood by specializing to spherical symmetry and @xmath48 ( schwarzschild de  sitter ) :    * @xmath49 rules out an over - extreme case .",
    "* @xmath50{\\frac{3\\mu}{2\\lambda}}=\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{3m}{\\lambda}}$ ] for the extreme case ( @xmath51 ) reduces to @xmath52 which may be interpreted as showing the uniqueness of the past black / white hole horizon ( as opposed to the cosmological one ) .",
    "both explanations are quite natural and not surprising",
    ".      the methods used in @xmath1 are not applicable when the equation is of the form ( after the substitution @xmath53 in ( [ pt ] ) , assuming @xmath54 with a suitable constant @xmath55 ) @xmath56 where @xmath57 is quadratic in gradient .    to prove existence of the solution to this quasilinear equation we will proceed by combining several steps ( motivated by @xcite and using results from @xcite ) .",
    "* we will consider the differential operator @xmath58 , with @xmath59 on a riemannian manifold @xmath60 . by using maximum principle",
    "we can prove that @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "* the linear differential equation @xmath62 with @xmath63 ( hlder space over @xmath60 ) has unique solution @xmath64 ( this standard result can be proven for example by fredholm alternative@xcite and the previous step ) . *",
    "to proceed with the nonlinear problem @xmath65 , with @xmath66 determined from ( [ pt ] ) as ( @xmath67 stands for the norm with respect to the positive definite metric @xmath17 ) @xmath68 @xmath69 we introduce the following truncature @xcite : @xmath70 - truncature of @xmath66 by @xmath71.then the map @xmath72 is bounded .",
    "using the previous step together with results on composition of hlder functions there exists a unique @xmath73 solving @xmath74 . *",
    "the map @xmath75 from previous step satisfies conditions of schauder fixed point theorem , namely the _ a priori _ boundedness ( see @xcite or @xcite ) @xmath76 for each @xmath21 there is a fixed point @xmath77 ( even @xmath78 ) solving @xmath79 and moreover one can easily verify that @xmath80 ( considering @xmath81 and compactness for evaluation at the maximum of @xmath82 ) . * using results of boccardo , murat & puel @xcite , in particular their proposition 3.6 , we can state the following corollary : assuming that metric @xmath17 is smooth , function @xmath57 can be estimated like @xmath83 ( where @xmath84 is increasing function on @xmath85 ) , and there exist a sub- and a super - solution @xcite @xmath86 , @xmath87 , then there is a @xmath88-bounded subsequence @xmath89 of the approximating solutions from the previous step satisfying @xmath90 a.e.indeed , inspecting the above defined function @xmath91 one can verify that function @xmath84 might be found , namely there is no singular behaviour at @xmath92 .",
    "also , the domain we are dealing with is compact and therefore any dependence on @xmath93 can be bounded for well behaved objects we use .",
    "for example , one may select the following bounding function @xmath94 @xmath95 where @xmath96 and the matrix norm of @xmath14 was used . *",
    "thanks to elliptic estimate @xmath97 it is even @xmath98-bounded . to estimate @xmath99 in the last inequality one can use its representation as @xmath100 ,",
    "where function @xmath101 is responsible for the truncation and @xmath102 is the heaviside function .",
    "using the results for composition ( e.g. hlder index of composed map is a product of indices of components ) and multiplication ( e.g. index is a minimum of indices of components ) of hlder continuous functions on bounded sets there has to be a new hlder coefficient @xmath103 and a suitable constant @xmath104 fulfilling the inequality .",
    "function @xmath66 in the elliptic estimate is dependent on @xmath93 not only explicitly but also via @xmath105 and @xmath106 , which is reflected in the constant @xmath104 .",
    "while @xmath89 is bounded independently on @xmath107 by @xmath108 we need to bound the gradient in the same way .",
    "using the fact that our function @xmath57 has the form @xmath109 ( with strictly positive @xmath110 ) and integrating over the manifold ( using the stokes theorem to eliminate the laplacian ) we get @xmath111 @xmath112 where the left hand side might be independently estimated . according to previous results gradient of @xmath89",
    "is bounded and from the last equation even independently .",
    "therefore , the constant @xmath104 does not depend on @xmath113 .",
    "* then there is a @xmath98-convergent subsequence @xmath114 , which proves the existence of the solution provided the sub- and super - solutions are obtained .",
    "moreover , using the second step with @xmath115 we must have @xmath116 .",
    "as is most common in the literature , we would be looking for constant sub- and super - solutions , first in the case @xmath117 ( assuming @xmath118 which can always be arranged by a suitable choice of @xmath55 ) :    * @xmath119 @xmath120\\ , } \\ ] ] @xmath121\\ , } \\ ] ] * @xmath122 @xmath123 @xmath124    these solutions satisfy all the conditions for any @xmath125 , but for positive cosmological constant one has to demand @xmath126 so that @xmath127 is valid for such a constant @xmath55 which is maximizing the value of @xmath128 .",
    "interestingly , this last condition reduces in the four - dimensional case ( that was not explicitly studied here , but can be included trivially - note that then @xmath13 is not a constant on @xmath129 and @xmath108 has to be adjusted @xcite ) to the condition from the table [ table ] for the existence of the solution when @xmath130 .",
    "one has to remember that for @xmath1 scalar curvature @xmath13 asymptotically ( as @xmath131 ) approaches value @xmath132 .",
    "one may wonder whether the condition ( [ restriction ] ) is necessary or if it might be weakened by the choice of more suitable non - constant sub- and/or super - solution .",
    "let us assume we have a positive solution @xmath133 of ( [ pt ] ) with @xmath130 . since it represents a function on a compact manifold it has to attain its maximum @xmath134 and minimum @xmath135",
    ". at @xmath135 the gradient term in ( [ pt ] ) vanishes while @xmath136 leading to the following inequality @xmath137 the right - hand side of ( [ rmin ] ) has minimum at @xmath138 .",
    "the inequality ( [ rmin ] ) must also hold for this value and after its substitution one arrives exactly at the condition ( [ restriction ] ) .",
    "therefore , it represents not only sufficient but also necessary condition for the existence of the horizon when positive cosmological constant is present .    since according to mathematical results any manifold ( including compact ones ) of dimension greater than or equal to @xmath139",
    "can be endowed with a complete riemannian metric of constant negative scalar curvature @xcite one should also consider that @xmath140 for our @xmath6-dimensional spatial hypersurface .",
    "one can propose the following constant sub- and super - solutions for @xmath141 ( assuming @xmath118 )    * @xmath142 @xmath143 @xmath144}\\ ] ] and select @xmath145 that is defined by @xmath146 * @xmath147 : impossible to find constant @xmath148 .",
    "so for nonpositive scalar curvature @xmath13 we can prove the existence only for negative cosmological constant .    in the four - dimensional case one can infer some useful results from the previous inequalities , mainly due to the fact that one can bound the scalar curvature from the asymptotic behaviour or using gauss - bonnet theorem .",
    "however , in higher - dimensional spacetime neither tool is available ( the generalizations of gauss - bonnet theorem are very complicated and not immediately applicable ) .",
    "after establishing the existence of the past horizon @xmath149 as a hypersurface foliated by marginally trapped surfaces one is naturally interested in whether it satisfies other conditions of recent quasilocal horizon definitions .",
    "we will consider trapping and dynamical horizons .",
    "the previous results tell us that @xmath150 and @xmath151 holds on the past horizon .",
    "since the lie derivative @xmath152 is in general nonvanishing on the horizon its closure is a trapping horizon @xcite .",
    "moreover , we can try to determine whether @xmath153 on the horizon which would mean that it is outer trapping horizon .",
    "after simple manipulations one arrives at the following formula @xmath154 and we need to prove that @xmath155 integrating the last equation over the @xmath27 dimensional compact subspace spanned by coordinates @xmath15 ( thus eliminating the right - hand side in ( [ lie - derivative ] ) ) we get the necessary condition for the horizon being outer @xmath156 which is satisfied for any @xmath125 and for positive cosmological constant one shall demand @xmath157    alternatively , one can consider ( [ lie - derivative ] ) at the maximum of @xmath158 , where @xmath159 .",
    "notice , that for non - negative cosmological constant the right - hand side of ( [ lie - derivative ] ) is strictly increasing function of @xmath158 , so it has maximal value at maximum of @xmath158 .",
    "if the horizon is everywhere non - degenerate ( @xmath160 ) then it is really an outer trapping horizon .",
    "next , we will consider a gradient of the horizon hypersurface which in our parametrization reduces to @xmath161 we can use the sign of its norm to determine the causal character of the horizon . using the null d - ad ( [ d - ad ] ) the corresponding vector can be expressed in the following form @xmath162 and beside being normal to the horizon @xmath149 it is also orthogonal to its @xmath129 @xmath27 dimensional sections @xmath163 .",
    "one can introduce a second vector orthogonal to these sections @xmath164 which satisfies @xmath165 and therefore is tangent to the horizon @xmath149 .",
    "then ( inspired by @xcite ) @xmath166 holds identically which gives the following equation @xmath167 if the outer trapping horizon condition is satisfied ( @xmath153 ) we need to determine the sign of the second term @xmath168 .",
    "one can consider the higher - dimensional generalization of raychaudhuri equation @xcite which in the case of nontwisting and nonshearing solution on the horizon where @xmath151 simplifies to @xmath169 since we are considering only aligned null radiation ( in the direction of @xmath170 with radiation density @xmath171 ) and cosmological constant @xmath2 the ricci tensor in ( [ raychaudhuri ] ) can be written as @xmath172 and substituting into ( [ raychaudhuri ] ) we get @xmath173 therefore , for nonnegative radiation density @xmath171 we conclude that @xmath174 .",
    "since both lie derivatives in ( [ null - condition ] ) are nonpositive it follows that @xmath175 which means that the horizon is either null ( for @xmath176 ) or spacelike ( for @xmath177 ) . in the latter case it presents an explicit example of dynamical horizon in higher - dimensional spacetime",
    "we have derived the generalization of the penrose  tod equation to higher dimensional robinson - trautman spacetimes including cosmological constant and pure radiation .",
    "using several mathematical tools we have proved the existence of its solution for any @xmath125 and for @xmath117 .",
    "the limitations arising for positive @xmath2 ( [ restriction ] ) are shown to correspond to similar restriction arising in four - dimensional case that are naturally related to the more complicated horizon structure of relevant spacetimes ( e.g. naked singularities ) .",
    "since the sign of scalar curvature of @xmath6-dimensional spatial hypersurface does not restrict their topology as it does in @xmath1 we have included the nonpositive case as well .",
    "the results show that in terms of the presence of the quasilocal horizons the higher - dimensional generalization shares the same qualitative behavior as the standard four - dimensional robinson - trautman spacetime .",
    "this provides support for considering the generalization given in @xcite to be natural not only mathematically but also physically .",
    "several important issues were not investigated here , namely uniqueness of the horizon hypersurface and its possible topologies .",
    "the question of uniqueness is much harder to solve for @xmath0 because of the nonlinearity in gradient . due to our parametrization of the horizon the issue of its topology",
    "is connected with the topology of the underlying spatial geometry ( given by @xmath17 ) of the @xmath6-dimensional manifold @xmath60 .",
    "so the obvious starting point should be the classification of einstein spaces of corresponding dimension .",
    "for @xmath178 the @xmath179 ( black ring ) is ruled out since it can not be endowed with einstein metric @xcite ( the second homotopy group has to vanish @xmath180 ) and the poincar conjecture singles out three - sphere as the only simply connected case . in @xmath181 topological obstructions arise for example due to generalized gauss - bonnet theorem relating the euler characteristic @xmath182 and curvature of compact oriented four - manifold .",
    "it turns out that @xmath183 and it is zero only in the flat case .",
    "this rules out @xmath184 . in higher dimensions the restrictions are much weaker ( positive ricci curvature implies finite first homotopy group ) ."
