    "during the evolution of a cancer disease , a fundamental step for the tumor consists in provoking proliferation of the surrounding blood vessels and migration toward the tumour .",
    "this process , called tumoral neo - angiogenesis establishes a proper vascular network which ensures to the tumour supply of nutrients and allow the tumor to grow further than 2 - 3 mm diameter .",
    "it is also important in the metastatic process by making possible the spread of cancerous cells to the organism which then can develop in secondary tumors ( metastases ) .",
    "thus , an interesting therapeutic strategy first proposed by j. folkman @xcite in the seventies consists in blocking angiogenesis with the goal to starve the primary tumor by depriving it from nutrient supply .",
    "this can be achieved by inhibiting the action of the vascular endothelial growth factor molecule either with monoclonal antibodies or tyrosine kinase inhibitors .",
    "although the concept of the therapy seems perfectly clear , the practical use of the anti - angiogenic ( aa ) drugs leaves various open questions regarding to the best temporal administration protocols . indeed , aa treatments lead to relatively poor efficacy and",
    "can even provoke deleterious effects , especially on metastases @xcite . regarding to these therapeutic failures",
    ", it seems that the _ scheduling _ of the drug plays a major role .",
    "indeed , as shown in the publication @xcite , different schedules for the same drug can lead to completely different results .",
    "moreover , aa drugs are never given in a monotherapy but always combined with cytotoxic agents ( also named chemotherapy ) which act directly on the cancerous cells .",
    "again , the scheduling of the drugs seems to be highly relevant @xcite and the optimal combination schedule between these two types of drugs is still a clinical open question .",
    "thus , the complex dynamics of tumoral growth and metastatic evolution have to be taken into account in the design of temporal administration protocols for anti - cancerous drugs . + in order to give answers to these questions ,",
    "various mathematical models are being developed for tumoral growth including the angiogenic process .",
    "we can distinguish between two classes of models : mechanistic models ( see for instance @xcite ) try to integrate the whole biology of the processes and comprise a large number of parameters ; on the other hand phenomenological models aim to describe the tumoral growth without taking into account all the complexity levels ( see @xcite for a review and @xcite ) .",
    "most of these models deal only with growth of the primary tumor but in 2000 , iwata et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a simple model for the evolution of the population of metastases , which was then further studied in @xcite .",
    "this model did not include the angiogenic process in the tumoral growth and thus could not integrate a description of the effect of an aa drug .",
    "we combined it with the tumoral model introduced by hahnfeldt et al .",
    "@xcite which takes into account for angiogenesis .",
    "the resulting partial differential equation is part of the so - called structured population dynamics ( see @xcite for an introduction to the theory ) : it is a transport equation with a nonlocal boundary condition .",
    "its mathematical analysis is not classical because the structuring variable is two - dimensional ; as far as we know such models have only been studied in the case where one structuring variable is the age and thus has constant velocity ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this is not the case in our situation and the theoretical analysis of the model without treatment ( autonomous case ) was performed in @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper , we present some mathematical and numerical analysis of the model in the non - autonomous case that is , integrating both cytotoxic and aa treatments and with a general growth field @xmath0 satisfying the hypothesis that there exists a positive constant @xmath1 such that @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the normal to the boundary .",
    "we first simplify the problem by straightening the characteristics of the equation .",
    "we perform some theoretical analysis first at the continuous level ( uniqueness and a priori estimates ) using the theory of renormalized solutions .",
    "then we introduce an approximation scheme which follows the characteristics of the equation ( lagrangian scheme ) .",
    "the introduction of such schemes in the area of size - structured population equations can be found in @xcite for one - dimensional models . here",
    ", we go further in the lagrangian approach by doing the change of variables straightening the characteristics and discretizing the simple resulting equation , in the case of a general class of two - dimensional non - autonomous models . we prove existence of the weak solution to the continuous problem through the convergence of this scheme _ via _ discrete a priori @xmath4 bounds and establish an error estimate in the case of more regular data .",
    "+ finally , we use this scheme to perform various simulations demonstrating the possible utility of the model .",
    "first , as a predictive tool for the number of metastases in order to refine the existing classifications of cancers regarding to metastatic aggressiveness . secondly , the model can be used to test various temporal administration protocols of aa drugs in monotherapy or combined with a cytotoxic agent .",
    "the model is based on the approach of @xcite to describe the evolution of a population of metastases represented by its density @xmath5 with @xmath6 being the structuring variable , here two - dimensional @xmath7 with @xmath8 the size ( = number of cells ) and @xmath9 the so - called angiogenic capacity .",
    "it is a partial differential equation of transport type .",
    "the behavior of each individual of the population ( metastasis ) , that is the growth rate @xmath10 of each tumor is taken from @xcite and is designed to take into account for the angiogenic process , as well as the effect of both anti - angiogenic ( aa ) and cytotoxic drugs ( ct ) .",
    "its expression will be established in the following subsection .",
    "the model writes    where @xmath11 , the birth rate @xmath12 , the repartition along the boundary @xmath13 and the source term @xmath14 will be specified in the sequel , @xmath15 is a positive time and @xmath3 is the unit external normal vector to the boundary @xmath16 .",
    "let @xmath17 denote the size ( number of cells ) of a given tumor at time @xmath18 .",
    "the growth of the tumor is modeled by a gompertzian growth rate modified by a death term describing the action of a ct .",
    "the equation is : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a parameter representing the velocity of the growth , @xmath9 the carrying capacity of the environment , and the term @xmath21 stands for the effect of a cytotoxic drug , where @xmath22 is the concentration of the ct , @xmath23 is a minimal size for the drug to be effective ( @xmath24 ) and the function @xmath25 is a regularization of the heaviside function ( for example @xmath26 , with @xmath27 being a parameter controlling the slope at @xmath28 ) , in order to avoid regularity issues in the analysis .",
    "the idea is now to take @xmath9 as a variable of the time , representing the degree of vascularization of the tumor and called `` angiogenic capacity '' .",
    "the variation rate for @xmath9 derived in @xcite is : @xmath29 where the terms @xmath30 and @xmath31 represent respectively the endogenous stimulation and inhibition of the vasculature and @xmath32 is the effect of an anti - angiogenic drug .",

    "this could lead to interesting clinical applications such as a refinement of the existing classifications like tnm or sbr , which deal only with the visible metastases . + as shown in @xcite , the metastatic response to aa treatment depends on the time schedule of the drug .",
    "the results of the simulations are encouraging in the perspective of using the model as a tool able to test various real temporal administration protocols of the drugs and to perform predictions of the mathematically optimized schedule for a given drug .",
    "moreover , aa are never used in a monotherapy but rather combined with a cytotoxic drug , and determining the best way to combine both drugs is still a clinical open question @xcite .",
    "as shown in the figure [ combinaisonctaa ] , the model could help in this direction , regarding both to tumor regression and metastatic evolution of the disease .",
    "we should also develop further the modeling in order to take into account for the competition effects between ct and aa .",
    "indeed , by reducing the vasculature aa drugs should induce worse supply of both drugs and on the contrary some arguments are expressed in favor of a normalization effect on the tumor vasculature by aa therapy @xcite , at least at the beginning of the treatment .",
    "these elements should be incorporated to the model _ via _ nonlinear terms involving the drugs concentrations in the equations - .",
    "the relative simplicity of the model ( @xmath427 parameters without treatment ) is a great advantage in view of concrete applications since we have to be able to fit the model to patients data in order to retrieve their parameters and then perform predictions about the optimal schedule . +",
    "a fundamental problem that we have to integrate in our model is the one of toxicities which have to be dynamically controlled to optimize the scheduling of the drug . in the case of ct and on the tumoral growth ,",
    "a model dealing with hematological toxicities is used to drive phase i clinical trials @xcite . in our case",
    ", we also have to integrate a module to control the toxicity and address the resulting problem of optimization under constraints .",
    "+ eventually , our model can be used to run _ in silico _ tests about the paradigm of metronomic chemotherapies which consists in delivering a cytotoxic drug at low doses and uniformly distributed in the treatment cycle rather than administrating the maximum tolerate dose ( mtd ) at the beginning of the cycle . indeed , these metronomic protocols seem to have a dynamical anti - angiogenic effect @xcite that can be integrated in the model of @xcite for the tumour growth and in our model for the effect on metastases .",
    "the result for the second map is classical . for the first one , we have to deal with irregular points of the boundary @xmath16 .",
    "we denote by @xmath428 the set of such points and set @xmath429 . in order to prove the result , it is sufficient to prove that the map @xmath4300,t[\\times \\d\\om\\setminus\\chi & \\rightarrow & \\om_1^t\\setminus\\chi_t \\\\                 ( \\tau,\\sig )                   & \\mapsto       & x(t;\\tau,\\sig )    \\end{array}\\ ] ] is a diffeomorphism , that globally the map @xmath431\\times\\d\\om\\rightarrow \\bom_1^t$ ] is bilipschitz and that its inverse is @xmath432 . for the first point , since we avoid the irregular points of the boundary by excluding the set @xmath428 , we have the @xmath433 regularity .",
    "it remains to prove that @xmath434 is one - to - one and onto , and that its inverse is @xmath433 .",
    "+ @xmath121 _ the map @xmath435 is one - to - one and onto_. let @xmath51 and @xmath436 .",
    "we have @xmath437 .",
    "+ for the injectivity , we remark that if we have @xmath438 with for instance @xmath439 , then @xmath440 which is prohibited by the assumption that @xmath441 .",
    "thus @xmath435 is one - to - one and we have , for @xmath442\\times \\d\\om$ ] : @xmath443 which implies @xmath444 .",
    "thus , we have proven that the inverse of @xmath435 is @xmath432 .",
    "+ @xmath121 _ the map @xmath435 is a diffeomorphism_. we will prove the formula for @xmath390 which will conclude the proof by using the local inversion theorem .",
    "we have @xmath445 , with @xmath446 for @xmath374 being a parametrization of @xmath16 and @xmath447 the derivative in @xmath448 of @xmath449 viewed as the flow on @xmath450 .",
    "we compute @xmath451 we compute now directly the value of @xmath452 .",
    "we define @xmath453 and now notice that we can write @xmath454 now when @xmath77 goes to zero @xmath455 since @xmath456 .",
    "finally , we have @xmath457 , thus @xmath458 and @xmath459 . solving the differential equation between times @xmath460 and @xmath18 and taking the absolute value",
    "then gives the formula .",
    "+ @xmath121 _ globally , @xmath435 is bilipschitz . _",
    "it is possible to show that @xmath461\\times\\d\\om)}\\leq e^{t|||dg|||_{l^\\infty([0,t]\\times\\bom}}$ ] . on the other hand , using the formula @xmath462 and the fact that from @xmath463 is bounded on @xmath464 thanks to the assumption we have @xmath465 .",
    "thus @xmath435 and @xmath466 are lipschitz on @xmath467\\times\\d\\om\\setminus\\chi$ ] and @xmath468 respectively , and they are both globally continuous on @xmath467\\times\\d\\om$ ] and @xmath464 .",
