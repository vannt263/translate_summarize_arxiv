    "the discovery of the higgs boson completes the list of particles of the standard model . however , there are many open questions regarding the dynamics of electroweak symmetry breaking . addressing these questions",
    "has been a driving force in both theoretical and experimental explorations of the energy frontier .",
    "one of the most outstanding problem is the nature of the electroweak phase transition .",
    "currently , we have measured with precision the size of the higgs vacuum expectation value ( vev ) and the mass of the higgs boson . however , we know very little about the shape of the higgs potential beyond that .",
    "the standard model defines its higgs potential with only renormalizable terms  the so - called  mexican \" hat form . in this case the electroweak symmetry is smoothly restored via a continuous cross - over as the temperature is raised above the electroweak scale @xcite .",
    "however , new physics can modify the nature of the phase transition , possibly turning it into an abrupt first - order phase transition . on the one hand ,",
    "such new physics can be searched for directly at current and future colliders . on the other hand ,",
    "a first order electroweak phase transition in the early universe would generate a stochastic background of gravitational waves that can be searched for with interferometers @xcite .",
    "discovering such a gravitational wave signal would establish the electroweak phase transition as a new milestone in our understanding of the early universe .",
    "it will advance our knowledge into an epoch significantly earlier than nucleosynthesis .",
    "a first order electroweak phase transition requires a significant deviation away from the renormalizable higgs potential , which implies the presence of new physics close to the weak scale .",
    "we can look for such new particles directly , such as at the lhc .",
    "even though it can be powerful in certain cases , the reach of this approach is limited .",
    "the new physics can be weakly coupled , and the searches at the lhc suffers from large background . at the same time , the most model independent effect of such new physics is the induced deviation in the higgs couplings .",
    "measuring such couplings precisely , and uncovering potential new physics , is a major physics goal of proposed higgs factories . in this paper",
    ", we will focus on the potential of probing new physics associated with electroweak symmetry breaking at these facilities .",
    "if a first order electroweak phase transition occurred in the early universe , the collision of bubbles and damping of plasma inhomogeneities would have generated a stochastic background of gravitational waves .",
    "the frequency of these waves is relatively model independent , being related to the scale of the cosmological horizon at the time of the phase transition .",
    "therefore today we expect the waves to have redshifted into the milli - hertz range .",
    "this potential signal is impossible to probe with ground - based gravitational wave interferometers like advligo due to seismic noise .",
    "however , the signal is ideal for a space - based interferometer like elisa @xcite with arm lengths of order millions of kilometers . in this paper",
    ", we assess the possibility of using gravitational waves as probes of a first order electroweak phase transition and the complementarity of this technique with the collider searches .",
    "there are a number of ways in which new particles may cause the electroweak phase transition to become first order . in general a first order phase transition",
    "can occur if the higgs effective potential is modified from its standard model form so as to develop a potential energy barrier separating the phases of broken and unbroken electroweak symmetry . as discussed in , there are three general model classes in which the barrier can arise .",
    "first , if the new degrees of freedom are scalar fields that participate in the electroweak phase transition ( their vev changes at the same time as the higgs ) then _ tree - level interactions _ with the higgs field can make some regions of field space energetically dis - favorable and lead to a barrier .",
    "second , the presence of new particles coupled to the higgs boson affects the running of the higgs mass parameter and self - coupling .",
    "then the barrier can arise by virtue of _ quantum effects_. third , if the new particles are present in the early universe plasma and acquire their mass ( at least partially ) from the higgs field , then a barrier can arise via _",
    "thermal effects_. this can be understood as a tradeoff between minimizing the energy , represented by the tree - level higgs potential , and maximizing the entropy , which prefers the higgs field to take on values where particles in the plasma are light .",
    "then , this third case can be further divided into two categories : a barrier arising from light scalars via the thermal cubic term @xmath6 and a barrier arising from heavy particles that get their mass predominantly from a large coupling with the higgs field .    in this paper",
    ", we survey a number of simplified models that demonstrate the basic ingredients necessary for a first order electroweak phase transition .",
    "we focus on four models in which the sm is extended , respectively , to include a real scalar singlet , a scalar doublet , heavy chiral fermions , and varying yukawa couplings .",
    "this set of models exemplifies all of the different phase transition model classes , enumerated above .",
    "in each of the models discussed here , the higgs field is represented by @xmath7 , and the standard model lagrangian contains @xmath8 in calculating the scalar effective potential we write @xmath9 with @xmath10 real .",
    "the vacuum spontaneously breaks the electroweak symmetry , @xmath11 with @xmath12 .",
    "the higgs mass is denoted as @xmath13 , and it takes the value @xmath14 .",
    "first , we add to the sm a real scalar field @xmath15 , which is a singlet under the sm gauge group .",
    "this is probably the simplest extension of the higgs sector of the sm . at the same time , due the lack of other interactions , it gives rise to the most independent signal .",
    "the most general renormalizable lagrangian is written as @xmath16 without loss of generality , we can set @xmath17 .",
    "since the new scalar is a singlet , it only interacts with the standard model via the higgs portal , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the electroweak phase transition and collider phenomenology in this model , sometimes called the xsm , have been studied extensively ; see _ e.g. _ and references therein . the gravitational wave signal in this model has been studied recently by refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "there is no single reason why this model admits a first order electroweak phase transition .",
    "in fact different limits of this simple model exhibit each of the phase transition model classes that were identified in .",
    "most notably , the tree - level interactions play a significant role in most of the parameter space . during the electroweak phase transition , the singlet @xmath20 need",
    "not remain fixed .",
    "if @xmath20 changes along with @xmath21 , then the higgs portal terms , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , can give rise to a barrier in the effective potential , and the phase transition is first order .",
    "after electroweak symmetry breaking @xmath24 , and generically we expect the singlet field to acquire a vacuum expectation value as well , @xmath25 . then , the higgs portal operators allow the higgs and singlet fields to mix",
    ". the mixing angle @xmath26 satisfies @xmath27 where @xmath14 is the physical higgs boson mass , and @xmath28 is the physical mass of the singlet .",
    "interactions between the higgs boson and the singlet scalar affect the coupling of the higgs to the z - boson . writing the effective @xmath29 coupling as @xmath30 , we define the fractional deviation from the sm value as @xmath31 where the couplings are evaluated at a center of mass energy @xmath32 .",
    "we calculate @xmath33 as @xmath34 the first term arises from the tree - level higgs - singlet mixing ( [ eq : singlet_mixing ] ) .",
    "this is typically the dominant contribution to @xmath33 . at the one - loop order",
    ", the singlet contributes to the wavefunction renormalization of the higgs .",
    "this gives rise to the second and third terms in .",
    "we have generalized the calculation in refs .",
    "@xcite , to allow for the cases without a @xmath35 symmetry .",
    "the bosonic loop function is given by  @xcite @xmath36 the wavefunction renormalization terms are typically sub - dominant , except for the @xmath35 limit ( discussed in ) where @xmath37 and the @xmath38 term is dominant .",
    "the fourth term in also arises at the one - loop order . as recognized in this term",
    "appears when the higgs trilinear coupling @xmath39 deviates from its sm value @xmath40 .",
    "the effect on @xmath33 depends on the center of mass energy , and for @xmath41 the prefactor evaluates to @xmath42  @xcite",
    ". the cubic self - coupling of the mass eigenstate higgs ( @xmath43 ) is calculated as @xmath44 in the standard model we have @xmath45 .",
    "the last term in @xmath39 arises from a three - vertex , one - loop graph .",
    "as we will see , models exhibiting a strongly first order phase transition , typically have an @xmath46 deviation in @xmath47 , and therefore , this effect on @xmath33 can be sizable .",
    "if the singlet is sufficiently light , @xmath48 , the higgs decay channel @xmath49 opens .",
    "this decay contributes to the higgs invisible width .",
    "the invisible width is calculated as  @xcite @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the effective tri - linear coupling of the mass eigenstates . if the invisible channel is open , the branching fraction is typically so large as to be excluded already by lhc limits , @xmath52 @xcite",
    ". therefore we require @xmath53 .    in general the model has @xmath54 parameters corresponding to the potential terms in with @xmath17 .",
    "two parameters can be exchanged for the higgs mass and vev , leaving @xmath55 free parameters . in",
    "we present the main result for this model , which entails a scan over the @xmath55-dimensional parameter space . in the following sub - sections we discuss a couple of special limiting cases of this model .",
    "even though they do not represent generic models with first order electroweak phase transition , they give rise to different predictions .",
    "we include them in our discussion for completeness .",
    "we impose the @xmath35 discrete symmetry under which the singlet is odd , @xmath56 , and the standard model fields are even . in terms of the singlet lagrangian ( [ eq : singlet_l ] ) the symmetry enforces @xmath57",
    "we also require that the @xmath35 symmetry is not broken spontaneously , and thus @xmath58 .",
    "the only interaction between the standard model and the singlet is through the higgs portal , @xmath59 .",
    "the @xmath35 symmetry forbids a mixing between the higgs and singlet fields . in the absence of mixing ,",
    "modifications to the @xmath29 coupling ( [ eq : singlet_dzh ] ) first arise at the one - loop level .",
    "the tree level modifications to the trilinear coupling ( [ eq : singlet_lam3 ] ) are also suppressed in this limit , and therefore , only the @xmath60 term contributes to @xmath33 .",
    "thus we expect that this corner of parameter space can evade constraints on @xmath33 from future colliders as discussed later . as such",
    ", this model has been identified as a `` worst case scenario '' for finding evidence of a first order ew phase transition at colliders @xcite .    despite the vanishing mixing ,",
    "the electroweak phase transition may still be first order .",
    "morally speaking , the higgs - singlet mixing is a `` local '' property of the theory , related to the behavior of small fluctuations about the vacuum , but the nature of the phase transition depends also up `` global '' properties of the theory , _",
    "e.g. _ whether the theory admits other metastable vacua .",
    "the presence or absence of such metastable vacua is not _",
    "directly _ related to the mixing at the true vacuum .",
    "two specific scenarios have been studied .",
    "if the higgs portal coupling is sufficiently large , the singlet can affect the running of the higgs self - coupling , which may induce a barrier in the effective potential @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the higgs portal interaction , @xmath61 with @xmath62 , may give rise to a barrier in the effective potential at tree - level when the phase transition passes from a vacuum with @xmath63 and @xmath64 to a vacuum with @xmath65 and @xmath66 .      the tree - level higgs - singlet mixing ( [ eq : singlet_mixing ] ) vanishes when we take @xmath67 unlike the @xmath35 symmetric limit of , the choice of parameters in is not associated with any enhanced symmetry .",
    "significant fine - tuning among tree - level parameters is necessary to reach this limit .",
    "furthermore , such a tuning is not technically natural ; the mixing is induced radiatively . at the one - loop order ,",
    "the induced mixing is @xmath68 .",
    "otherwise , the first order electroweak phase transition and collider phenomenology is similar to the @xmath35 case . in the unmixed limit",
    ", the singlet can be pair produced through an off - shell higgs via the @xmath69 coupling @xmath70 , and can decay to @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 final states via the radiatively generated mixing",
    ". then by the goldstone equivalence theorem , the singlet decay branching ratios for the @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 channels are 25@xmath74 , 50@xmath74 , and 25@xmath74 respectively .",
    "those final states contribute to a multi - lepton , multi - jet signature , which can be probed at the lhc . with a large @xmath72 branching ratio",
    ", the 4@xmath75 channel leads to a same - sign dilepton with multiple jets ( zero b - jet ) final state .",
    "the background processes for this channel include @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and same sign @xmath72 plus jets .",
    "all backgrounds except same sign @xmath72 plus jets , can be estimated from the @xmath80 searches in the same sign dilepton with at least two b - jets channel , by replacing the b - tagging with a b - jet veto  @xcite .",
    "we assume the b - tagging efficiency is 70@xmath74 .",
    "for the same sign @xmath72 plus jets , we include both single parton scattering and double parton scattering  @xcite , and assume a 90@xmath74 acceptance to account for the lepton efficiency , and kinematics .",
    "we assume the same 90@xmath74 acceptance for signal as well .",
    "then at the hl - lhc , we expect a 2@xmath81 significance for @xmath82 , which corresponds to @xmath83 , and @xmath84  @xcite .      in this section",
    ", we go beyond the singlet to consider new particles in non - trivial representations of the sm gauge group .",
    "some of the simplest cases are obtained by introducing @xmath85 scalar doublets and singlets with @xmath86 charge .",
    "perhaps the most well - known example is the mssm stop .",
    "however , the light stop scenario is very restricted and , at least in simple cases , it can not give rise to a first order electroweak phase transition without running afoul of collider constraints @xcite , see also  @xcite .",
    "many of these constraints are a consequence of the supersymmetry .",
    "for example , the scalar top partner must to be colored and hence the stop is subject to stringent limits from collider searches . to avoid the collider constraints , models like folded susy",
    "have been proposed  @xcite , in which the stops can still solve the hierarchy problem , but are not colored . in the following ,",
    "we consider a similar stop - like model .",
    "the new particles are taken to have the same electroweak gauge quantum numbers as the stop , but they are not colored .",
    "in addition , their couplings are not subject to the constraints of supersymmetry .",
    "we extend the sm to include @xmath87 copies ( flavors ) of scalar doublets and complex scalar singlets .",
    "we will denote the doublets and singlets as @xmath88 and @xmath89 where the index @xmath90 runs from @xmath91 to @xmath92 . in order to mimic the interactions of colored squarks",
    ", we require the lagrangian to respect the global @xmath93 symmetry , under which the @xmath94 and @xmath89 transform in the fundamental representation , and the sm fields are invariant .",
    "notice that we have used a susy - like notation to indicate the electroweak gauge quantum numbers , but no susy relations are implied .    with the new stop - like particle content",
    ", the scalar potential can be written as @xmath95      \\nonumber      \\per\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the sum over @xmath96 flavors has been suppressed . in general",
    "the model has @xmath97 parameters , but @xmath98 of these can be exchanged for the higgs mass and vev , leaving @xmath99 free parameters .",
    "additionally , we will later assume a universal dimensionless coupling , @xmath100 , which reduces the free parameters to four : @xmath101 .",
    "we present the results of a parameter - space scan in .    in the well - known light",
    "stop scenario of the mssm @xcite , the electroweak phase transition can become first order due to the presence of these scalar particles in the plasma .",
    "their contribution to the higgs thermal effective potential ( background - dependent free energy density ) goes as @xmath102^{3/2 } t$ ] where @xmath103 is the number of colors , and the effective stop mass @xmath104 depends on the background higgs field @xmath10 and the plasma temperature @xmath105 ( daisy correction ) .",
    "this non - analytic term in @xmath106 arises only for relativistic bosonic fields , due to the non - analyticity of the bose - einstein distribution function at @xmath107 . in a regime where the stop mass can be approximated as @xmath108 ,",
    "the effective potential acquires a cubic term , @xmath109 , which can provide the requisite barrier for a first order phase transition . in our stop - like model , the same thermal effects can give rise to a first order electroweak phase transition .",
    "however , since we do not impose the susy relations , @xmath110 is replaced by some combination of the quartic couplings @xmath111 in . in principle",
    ", @xmath111 can be larger than @xmath110 , which increases the height of the potential energy barrier and strengthens the first order the phase transition .",
    "for simplicity , we neglect the daisy resummation , _",
    "i.e. _ the one - loop temperature - dependent mass correction , which plays an important role in the mssm s light stop scenario @xcite .",
    "we expect that this effect will weaken the pt strength on a parameter point - by - point basis without affecting our broader conclusions regarding testability of models with a first order electroweak phase transition .",
    "we assume that the new scalar fields do not acquire vevs , @xmath112 .",
    "thus , the the flavor symmetry prevents the higgs from mixing with the squark - like fields .",
    "nevertheless , the trilinear interactions allows the stop - like fields to mix after electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the mixing angle satisfies @xmath113 the spectrum consists of two `` stops '' and one `` sbottom , '' and we denote their mass eigenvalues by @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and @xmath116 .",
    "their couplings to the higgs are given by    [ eq : g_stop ] @xmath117    these dimensionful couplings can be read off of upon diagonalizing the stop mass matrix .    since the stop- and sbottom - like particles are not actually colored , they do not affect the higgs coupling to gluons . however , the new charged scalar particles do increase the strength of the higgs - photon coupling radiatively .",
    "this increases the higgs diphoton decay rate @xcite @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the electromagnetic fine structure constant and    [ eq : stoplike_a ] @xmath120    with @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",

    ", we drop the @xmath127 and @xmath128 terms from .",
    "the new charged scalars also affect the higgs coupling to z - bosons .",
    "at one - loop order the dominant effect typically comes from a wavefunction renormalization on the higgs leg .",
    "this graphs brings two factors of the quartic couplings @xmath111 , which appear in .",
    "the other one - loop graphs , _",
    "i.e. _ the vertex renormalization and the z - boson wavefunction renormalization , are suppressed compared to the higgs wavefunction renormalization by factors of @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the electromagnetic coupling . as long as @xmath131",
    "the higgs wavefunction renormalization is the dominant effect on the @xmath29 coupling .",
    "consequently the @xmath29 coupling deviates from its sm value by  @xcite @xmath132 where the loop function is defined in .      in the previous sections we have discussed how new scalar states can lead to a first order electroweak phase transition . here",
    "we investigate models in which the first order transition derives from new fermions .",
    "the key ingredient is that the fermions have a large coupling to the higgs , which gives them a large mass during the electroweak phase transition .",
    "prior to the phase transition the fermions were lighter , since the higgs vev does nt contribute to their mass .",
    "since it is energetically unfavorable for the fermion masses to grow , the effective potential develops a barrier , which leads to a first order phase transition .",
    "we discuss two implementations of this idea .",
    "extend the sm to include the left - chiral fermions @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 , and @xmath136 .",
    "they have the same gauge charge assignments as higgsinos and gauginos in the mssm .",
    "two doublets @xmath137 are required for anomaly cancellation , and either the singlet @xmath135 or the triplet @xmath138 is required to allow a yukawa coupling with the standard model higgs .",

    "this makes it energetically preferable for the system to remain in the symmetric phase , and the phase transition is delayed until a lower temperature thereby becoming more strongly first order . since we will be interested in a region of parameter space with large couplings , there is a threat that the new fermions will exacerbate the electroweak vacuum instability .",
    "following we counter this problem by introducing new scalar particles that have field - dependent masses @xmath156 where @xmath157 .",

    "i.e. _ the bubble wall , the properties of particles and their interactions can vary rapidly .",
    "specifically , thermal diffusion of @xmath85 chern - simons number leads to efficient violation of baryon number outside of the bubbles ( symmetric phase ) , but inside of the bubbles the weak gauge fields become massive , @xmath207 , and these processes ( electroweak sphalerons ) acquire a boltzmann suppression .",
    "thus , a baryon asymmetry can be generated outside of the bubble and diffuse into the bubble , where it is approximately conserved .",

    "the exponent is calculated as @xmath286 this affects the size of bubbles at the time of collision , and therefore it factors into the gravitational wave spectrum .",
    "we must have @xmath287 otherwise the phase transition would not occur .",
    "we calculate the spectrum of gravitational waves generated at the electroweak phase transition by following , which summarizes the results of various original sources .",
    "gravitational waves at a first order phase transition are produced in three ways : from the collision of bubbles , from the decay of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence , and from the propagation of sound waves .",
    "the spectrum of gravitational waves produced by bubble collisions is given by the envelope approximation to be @xmath288 where @xmath289 is the fraction of the liberated vacuum energy transferred into motion of the bubble wall and @xmath290 is the speed of the wall .",
    "the spectrum peaks at a frequency @xmath291 given by @xmath292 the decay of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence contributes to the gravitational wave spectrum as @xmath293 where @xmath294 is the fraction of energy transferred to turbulent motions of the plasma , and @xmath295 this spectrum peaks at a frequency @xmath296 given by @xmath297 finally , sound waves contribute to the gravitational wave spectrum as @xmath298^{7/2 } }      \\com\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath299 is the fraction of energy transferred to bulk motions of the fluid .",
    "the spectrum peaks at @xmath300 note that @xmath301 and @xmath302 are larger than @xmath303 by a factor of @xmath304 .",
    "this is because gravitational wave production from plasma effects can continue even after bubble collisions have completed",
    ".    the efficiency factors ( @xmath289 s ) are model - dependent and vary with the strength of the phase transition .",
    "if the phase transition is weakly first order , the energy in the scalar field is depleted by interactions with the plasma , and it reaches a terminal velocity ( possibly relativistic ) . then the energy transferred to the plasma ( @xmath294 and @xmath299 ) is limited by the vacuum energy that was initially available in the field , which is parametrized by @xmath277 . on other hand , for a strongly first order transition the pressure gradient drives the bubble wall to expand and `` run away '' with @xmath305 . in this regime , the amount of energy transferred to the plasma saturates , and the surplus energy causes the bubble wall to accelerate .",
    "consequently , for large @xmath277 we have @xmath306 and @xmath307 .",
    "since only the strongest phase transitions will be detectable by elisa , we can simplify by assuming that all models lead to runaway phase transitions . in this way",
    ", we accurately assess the gravitational wave signal for the strongest phase transitions .",
    "following , the following expressions parametrize the fraction of energy that is carried by the bubble wall , that is carried by the bulk motion of the plasma , and that is lost as heat : @xmath308 a fraction @xmath309 of the energy carried by bulk motions is transferred to mhd turbulence , @xmath310 .",
    "simulations motivate @xmath311 and @xmath312 .",
    "we also take @xmath313 .",
    "these expressions are valid for sufficiently strong phase transitions , @xmath314 where @xmath315 we calculate @xmath209 , @xmath316 , @xmath277 , @xmath317 , and @xmath318 from the one - loop thermal effective potential , as described in .",
