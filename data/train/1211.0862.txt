    "the studies of nuclear electromagnetic response along isotonic and isotopic chains of nuclei led to surprising new observations of new modes of excitations different from known surface vibrations and giant resonances in nuclei close to the isospin n = z symmetry .",
    "a clear example is the existence of an enhanced dipole strength located below or closely above the neutron particle emission threshold which was found to be a common feature of stable and unstable nuclei with neutron excess @xcite . as far",
    "as this bunching of dipole states with very similar spectroscopic features resemble a resonance , the new mode was named pygmy dipole resonance ( pdr ) .",
    "even though , the nature of the pdr is a subject of outstanding discussions , the most common theoretical interpretation associated it with oscillations of a weakly bound neutrons ( for n / z@xmath01 ) or protons ( for n / z@xmath11 ) with respect to an isospin symmetric core @xcite .",
    "a question , coming up immediately in this connection , is to what extent the presence of a neutron or proton skin will affect excitations of other multipolarities and parities and _ vice versa_. promising candidates are low - energy 1@xmath2 , 2@xmath2 , 3@xmath3 states ect . , especially those in excess of the spectral distributions known from stable nuclei .",
    "recently , quadrupole response functions were investigated , theoretically in neutron - rich sn nuclei . a close connection of low - energy 2@xmath4 excitations and nuclear skins was found .",
    "these quadrupole states were related to pygmy quadrupole resonance ( pqr ) @xcite . in this connection , qrpa and",
    "qpm calculations of dipole and quadrupole strength distributions for pygmy resonances in nuclei with z=12,13,50 and n=50,82 are discussed .",
    "the model hamiltonian resembles in structure the standard quasiparticle - phonon model ( qpm ) @xcite but in detail differs in the physical content in important aspects as discussed in @xcite :    @xmath5    here , @xmath6 is the mean - field part defining the single particle properties including pairing interactions for protons and neutrons .",
    "different from the standard qpm scheme this part is obtained self - consistently by a fully microscopic hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) approach @xcite .",
    "@xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are residual interactions , taken as a sum of isoscalar and isovector separable multipole and spin - multipole interactions in the particle - hole ( @xmath10 ) and multipole pairing interaction in the particle - particle @xmath11 channels .",

    "the reliable description of ground state properties is of genuine importance for extrapolations of qrpa and qpm calculations into unknown mass regions .",

    "a common observation found in the investigated isotopic and isotonic chains of nuclei is that the thickness of the neutron skin is related to the neutron - to - proton ratio n / z .",
    "thus , in sn isotopes with a@xmath28106 the neutron distributions begin to extend beyond the proton density and the effect continues to increase with the neutron excess , up to @xmath29 .",

    "[ fig4ab ] ( left panel ) we display dipole qrpa transition densities for several tin isotopes for three different regions of excitation energies : the low - energy pdr region below the neutron emission threshold , the transitional region up to the gdr and in the gdr region and beyond .",

    "[ fig4ab ] ( left panel ) were obtained by summing over the transition densities of the individual one - phonon 1@xmath53 states located in the energy intervals denoted at the top of each column of the figures .",
    "a common features of the presented @xmath54sn cases is that up to @xmath55  mev the protons and neutrons oscillate in phase in the nuclear interior , while at the surface only neutron transitions contribute .",
    "this pattern is generic to the lowest dipole states making it meaningful to distinguish these excitations from the well known gdr states .",
    "hence , we are allowed to identify the pdr as a distinct and unique excitation different from the giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) .",

    "the transition of the neutron pdr to a proton pdr manifests itself via the proton and neutron transition densities as well .",
    "thus , in @xmath52sn the proton oscillations dominate at the nuclear surface due to the formation of a proton skin ( see in ref .",

    "the close relationship of the pdr strength and the skin thickness is also confirmed in our investigations of n=82 nuclei @xcite .",
    "the comparison of qrpa and two- and three - phonon qpm calculations of dipole strengths indicates that for the pdr region the coupling of qrpa pdr and gdr phonons and multiphonon states is very important .",
    "the result is a shift of e1 strength toward lower energies which is well visible in fig .",
    "[ fig6ab ] ( left panel ) .",
    "consequently in the energy interval @xmath59 mev the qpm calculations give about twice as much total e1-strength than the qrpa calculations , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6ab ] ( right panel ) . differently , with the increase of the excitation energy toward the gdr the qrpa and qpm summed b(e1 ) transition strengths are of comparable size which suggests the prevalence of @xmath60 excitations of gdr type .",

    "the comparison of @xmath61sn and @xmath62sn nuclei shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6ab ] ( right panel ) shows that the relative difference between the e1 strengths calculated for certain energy regions , both for the qrpa and qpm cases , reduces with the increase of the excitation energies toward gdr .",
    "this behavior is expected because of the weak dependence of gdr on n / z ratios in tin isotopes .",
    "furthermore , in theoretical investigations of 2@xmath4 excitations in sn isotopic chain , we find a strength clustering of quadrupole states , at low - energies , with predominantly neutron structure . at the same time , the proton contribution to state vectors and b(e2 ) strengths , located in the energy range e@xmath63 2 - 4 mev , increases toward @xmath64sn and brings to more intensive proton quadrupole excitations in @xmath64sn there .",

    "the clustering of quadrupole states at low - energies shows a pattern similar to the pdr phenomenon .",
    "therefore , we may consider the spectral distribution of a pygmy quadrupole resonance ( pqr ) .",
    "correspondingly , the connection of the pqr with neutron or proton skin oscillations is demonstrated in analysis of transition densities ( see in ref.@xcite ) .",
