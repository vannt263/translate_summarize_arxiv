    "heavy ionized nuclei are collided at high energies in laboratory experiments to recreate temperatures and densities similar to those in the early universe at approximately one microsecond after the big bang  @xcite . at that time",
    ", the universe was filled with deconfined quarks and gluons , a phase of matter known as the quark - gluon plasma .",
    "studying the quark - gluon plasma in the laboratory involves observing hadrons emitted from the fireball created in the collision of ultrarelitivistic heavy nuclei .",
    "the fireball is @xmath0 meters across and expands for approximately @xmath1 seconds before hadrons form , re - scattering ceases , and the stable particles stream away from the collision zone to eventually be detected by particle detectors many of orders of magnitude larger than the speck of quark - gluon - plasma created in the collisions .",
    "understanding the evolution of the matter created in those collisions by observing the hadrons that stream into the detectors is a challenge .    in this",
    "talk i discuss how fluctuations in the geometry of the initial overlap zone  @xcite can manifest as two - particle correlations .",
    "these correlations may therefore provide information about the expansion phase that converts the over - densities in the initial overlap zone into momentum space correlations in the final - state .",
    "i use a toy monte - carlo model to illustrate the relevance of @xmath2 fluctuations where @xmath2 are the coefficients in a fourier expansion of the particle multiplicity with respect to the reaction plane .",
    "it s important to consider the odd values of @xmath3 particularly since some of the interesting features of recent two particle correlations data from rhic can be readily understood in terms of @xmath4 fluctuations .",
    "an analysis of @xmath5 to study the expansion of heavy - ion collisions was first proposed in ref .",
    "@xmath6 fluctuations and di - hadron correlations are discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite where @xmath2 fluctuations for @xmath7 are argued to be zero and the remaining structures in correlations data are argued to arise from jets .",
    "correlations and fluctuations have long been considered a good signature for quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) formation in heavy - ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "early proposals for qgp searches suggested searching for a non - monotonic dependence of fluctuations on variables related to the energy systems density ( _ e.g. _ center - of - mass energy or collision centrality ) the expectation being that above some energy density threshold , a phase transition to qgp would occur .",
    "data from the experiments at rhic indeed reveal interesting features in the two - particle correlation landscape @xcite but that data does not seem to support a picture based on correlations arising from a phase transition .",
    "correlation structures unique to nucleus - nucleus collisions are found but their longitudinal width demonstrates that they come from the earliest moments of the collisions  @xcite . while two - particle correlations in p+p and d+au collisions show a jet - peak narrow in relative azimuth @xmath8 and pseudo - rapidity @xmath9 , the near - side peak in au+au collisions broadens substantially in the longitudinal direction and narrows in azimuth  @xcite .",
    "an analysis of the width of the peak for particles of all @xmath10 finds the correlation extends across nearly 2 units of pseudo - rapidity @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "when triggering on higher momentum particles ( @xmath12  gev / c for example ) , the correlation extends beyond the acceptance of the star detector ( @xmath13 ) and perhaps as far as @xmath14 as indicated by phobos data  @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed that the ridge - like correlations are related to either non - perturbative multi - quark or gluon effects on mini - jets in au+au collisions  @xcite , to soft gluons radiated by hard partons traversing the overlap region  @xcite , to initial spatial correlations in the system converted to momentum - space correlations by a radial hubble expansion  @xcite , to beam - jets also boosted by the radial expansion  @xcite , or to viscous broadening  @xcite .",
    "the modifications to the correlations are not limited to small @xmath8 .",
    "when at least one of the particles used in the analysis has @xmath12  gev / c ( a selection made to attempt to increase sensitivity to jets ) , the correlation structure at @xmath15 ( away - side ) is also highly modified in comparison to @xmath16 collisions  @xcite . instead of a narrow peak with a maximum at @xmath17 corresponding to an away - side jet ,",
    "a peak shifted away from @xmath17 is observed .",
    "it has been proposed that the correlations on the away - side may be the result of a mach - cone induced by the fast moving away - side parton as it traverses the medium  @xcite .",
    "other proposals suggest the off - axis peak is due to cerenkov radiation from the away - side jet  @xcite or deflection of jets in the medium  @xcite .    in this talk",
    ", i argue that the ridge and away - side `` cone '' may be a manifestation of @xmath2 fluctuations ; the distinction between two- or few - particle correlations and @xmath2 fluctuations being that @xmath2 fluctuations are a property of the bulk - medium . the ridge and cone",
    "might not be related to a single hard or semi - hard scatterred parton , but instead might be due to acoustics in the expansion of the quark - gluon plasma initiated from a highly textured initial energy density ; one having hot - spots and regions of over- and under - densities .",
    "this hypothesis will need to be further developed to test for consistency with the full set of heavy - ion data including the @xmath9 , charge , and particle type dependence of correlations .",
    "a hydrodynamic expansion leads to strong space - momentum correlations : spatial density gradients and interactions lead to boosts which are largest in the direction of the largest gradient .",
    "information about the spatial gradient is therefore transferred into momentum space via the boost driven by the pressure .",
    "a system that starts from lumpy initial conditions and then undergoes a hydrodynamic expansion  @xcite should contain non - trivial two - particle correlations in the final momentum space  @xcite .",
    "the conversion of the initial eccentricity @xmath18 into @xmath6 has been discussed extensively in the literature ; see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein . the manifestation of smaller scale spatial fluctuations into @xmath2 fluctuations , however , is a novel topic .",
    "i show results from a toy model to illustrate the connection of @xmath2 fluctuations and azimuthal correlations to fluctuations in the initial overlap geometry .",
    "the toy model assumes that particles in an event are generated from a finite number of boosted sources .",
    "these boosted sources could be `` hot - spots '' left over from high - density regions in the initial overlap area .",
    "the boost velocity depends on the radial and azimuthal position of the source .",
    "the number of sources is taken to be @xmath19 from a monte carlo glauber model  @xcite .",
    "the coordinates of the sources are also taken from the monte carlo glauber model .",
    "a blast - wave source function  @xcite is sampled enough times for each source point so that the total multiplicity produced in our toy model matches the @xmath20 200 gev au+au data  @xcite .",
    "we simulate particles within @xmath21 .",
    "the details of the model will be published in an upcoming publication .",
    "applying a pure hubble boost to sources distributed according to the distribution of participants in a glauber model will lead to negative @xmath6 values .",
    "typically the blast - wave model is used to model particle emission from a freeze - out surface which can be highly deformed from the initial geometry .",
    "the deformation is assumed to arise from rescattering and flow .",
    "this toy model is constructed to study how correlations in the initial conditions can be reflected in correlations and fluctuations in the produced particles . since in our model",
    ", the freeze - out geometry is fixed by the initial distributions , we must apply a boost with a large azimuthal asymmetry in order to obtain reasonable @xmath6 values .",
    "we do not attempt to model the expansion or to evolve the hot spots with a dynamic model .",
    "such a calculation has been carried out elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ boost ] shows how the boost employed in our model influences the momentum of the produced particles .",
    "the arrows in the figure show the average transverse momentum vector for particles emitted from sources at @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "this model clearly leads to the desired space momentum correlations since particles emitted from positive @xmath22 have a preference for having momentum in the same direction .",
    "the boost also leads to the desired @xmath6 with most arrows pointing preferentially in the direction of the shortest axis as anticipated for a pressure driven expansion .",
    "the red points show the locations of participants in one event .",
    "the points have been shifted so that @xmath24 and @xmath25 are centered at 0,0 .",
    "this shift has a major effect on @xmath26 fluctuations , reducing the value of @xmath27 significantly .",
    "the uneven distribution of participants in a single event indicates that , in the case that space - momentum correlations develop in the expansion of the system , the produced particles should possess non - trivial correlations .",
    "the model parameters have been tuned so that the integrated @xmath6 matches rhic data  @xcite .",
    "the odd @xmath28 terms from the model are zero at mid - rapidity but we will see that the odd @xmath29 terms can be finite .",
    "first , in fig .  [ sigv ] , i show the variance of @xmath6 relative to the mean @xmath6 .",
    "this ratio has been used in comparisons of data to model calculations for eccentricity fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "the data in this figure should be compared with data using @xmath30 with respect to the reaction plane and not the participant plane .",
    "these model results are similar to what has been observed in preliminary data .",
    "we do not compare to published star data  @xcite because that data was calculated by integrating @xmath31 weighting by the spectra which is not equivalent to what is shown in this figure .",
    "the ratio is very large in central and peripheral collisions where the denominator approaches zero . in the intermediate region ,",
    "the ratio has a minimum of about 0.5 at @xmath32  fm .",
    "two - particle azimuthal correlations for all unique pairs of particles from our model with @xmath33 fm are shown in fig .",
    "the correlation function @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the pair density and the reference @xmath36 is @xmath37 ( @xmath38 is the average multiplicity ) . in the left panel ,",
    "the correlations are fit to a gaussian peak centered at @xmath39 , a @xmath40 , a @xmath41 term , and a constant offset ( gaussian fit ) . in the bottom panel ,",
    "the same model results are fit with @xmath42 for @xmath43 and 4 ( cosine fit ) .",
    "@xmath44 denotes the fit parameters which should be equal to @xmath45 .",
    "both functions have the same number of fit parameters and give equally good descriptions of the correlation function .",
    "fits similar to the gaussian fit have been used to parametrize data in terms of a near - side mini - jet peak plus two cosine terms for momentum conservation and for elliptic flow  @xcite .",
    "neither of the fits returns the correct value for @xmath46 .",
    "the cosine fit comes closest but overestimates the value by 4.6% while the gaussian fit underestimates the value by 18% .",
    "the gaussian fit underestimates @xmath47 because part of @xmath48 and @xmath49 along with all of the higher order @xmath50 terms are subsumed into the gaussian peak which over - estimates the contribution from non - flow in our model .",
    "we use the true values of @xmath50 in our model to extract the true nonflow that arise from correlations between particles emitted from the same participant pair . the true nonflow peak ( not shown )",
    "is well described by an offset and a narrow gaussian with a width of 0.54 radians .",
    "the @xmath51 component of the the true nonflow accounts exactly for the differences between the known @xmath52 and the parameter @xmath53 in the cosine fit .",
    "this exercise demonstrates that the parameters extracted from a fit to a correlation function are not easily related to @xmath29 .",
    "the results of this simulation contradict the conclusion in ref .",
    "@xcite that @xmath47 is typically over - estimated in di - hadron analyses and that a gaussian type fit can be used to extract @xmath46 with minimal systematic error .",
    "even when that fit uses the @xmath9 dependence , it requires the assumption that @xmath54 has no covariance : @xmath55 .",
    "such an assumption can mimic a gaussian dependence for the nonflow in @xmath9 . in this simulation ,",
    "the gaussian fit underestimates @xmath47 and overestimates the nonflow correlations .",
    "it is best for model builders to compare their models to measured correlation functions and experiments should publish unmanipulated correlation functions .              fig .",
    "[ vnrms ] shows @xmath2 fluctuations as a function of @xmath3 where @xmath56 .",
    "results are shown for pions and protons produced from events with impact parameters of 0 and 6 fm . as anticipated ,",
    "both the even and the odd terms of @xmath57 are non - zero . except for @xmath58",
    ", the values of @xmath57 generally drop with @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath59 term is suppressed because we applied a shift to the @xmath22 and @xmath23 of the participants in our model so that @xmath60 and @xmath61 ( re - centering the events ) .",
    "this significantly reduces @xmath62 by constraining the geometric fluctuations , so that for most cases @xmath63 .",
    "the @xmath57 values are larger for protons than for pions .",
    "this comes about in our model because geometry fluctuations drive the @xmath2 fluctuations and heavier particles carry more information about the geometry ( space - momentum correlations are larger when the ratio of the particle mass to freeze out temperature @xmath64 is larger ) .",
    "the non - zero values of @xmath57 for odd terms and the falling trend of @xmath57 with @xmath3 implies that @xmath4 fluctuations should not be neglected . in this model , the @xmath4 fluctuations are particularly prominent for protons and at higher momentum where the space - momentum correlations are strongest .",
    "@xmath4 fluctuations provide a ready explanation for the double - hump structure on the away - side of di - hadron correlations .",
    "@xmath2 fluctuations also provide a ready explanation for why correlations on the near- and away - side of di - hadron correlations both increase rapidly together with centrality  @xcite ; they are actually the same correlation function arising from the bulk but artificially divided into components .      at this conference ,",
    "several speakers have discussed how correlations and fluctuations affect @xmath10 spectra .",
    "fits using tsallis statistics have proved successful for fitting the spectra of strange and heavy flavor hadrons  @xcite ( the focus of this conference ) . the same lumpy initial energy density that leads to the @xmath2 fluctuations presented here",
    ", can also be the source of the temperature fluctuations implied by the tsallis fits .",
    "if this is true , one should be able to construct a model that describes all these phenomena at once .",
    "that model of bulk qcd matter should transition smoothly to a pqcd picture when enough energy is focused within a small enough region .    in this talk ,",
    "i ve shown results from a toy monte - carlo model that illustrate the potential importance of @xmath2 fluctuations in understanding the initial conditions and expansion of heavy - ion collisions .",
    "i showed that lumpy initial conditions coupled with space - momentum correlations developed in an expansion phase , leads to correlations and fluctuations similar to those seen in rhic data .",
