    "we investigate the weak interaction emission of spin-@xmath0 fermions from classical and semiclassical currents .",
    "we denote by semiclassical those currents which possess classical trajectories and are endowed with quantized inner energy levels .",
    "our results can be used to investigate a broad class of processes involving accelerated particles provided that they have a well defined world line , as indeed verified in many situations of interest . in the case where the particle is accelerated by a background electromagnetic field ,",
    "such processes could be fully analyzed quantum - mechanically . as a consequence",
    ", any recoil effects due to the fermion emission would be automatically taken into account  @xcite .",
    "for instance , in ref .",
    "@xcite a quasiclassical approach to quantum electrodynamics was developed to consider @xmath1-synchrotron radiation from an electron in a classical background magnetic field .",
    "this approach is basically characterized by assuming that the electron motion is quasiclassical .",
    "this is always possible as far as the magnetic field is not very strong , namely @xmath2 and @xmath3 , where @xmath4  gauss and @xmath1 is the lorentz factor for the electron .",
    "this quasiclassical approach applied for neutrino - antineutrino emission is analyzed in detail in sec .",
    "6.1 of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "although this is hard to take into account the current recoil in our semiclassical approach , the relations here obtained , which agrees with the full quantum mechanical treatment in the proper limit ( @xmath5 , see e.g. sec .  [ neutrino emission ] )",
    ", are easily applicable when the process involves particle decay and the trajectory itself ( rather than the underlying dynamical process which generates it ) is inferred from the observational data . explicit results for uniformly accelerated currents are exhibited .",
    "as far as we know , the first ones to call attention to the possibility that non - inertial protons may decay were ginzburg and syrovatskii  @xcite but only recently muller  @xcite obtained the first estimation for the decay rate associated with the process @xmath6 by assuming that all the involved particles are scalars . here , as a particular application of modeling accelerated particles by semiclassical currents , we perform a comprehensive ( inertial - frame ) analysis of the inverse @xmath7 decay for uniformly accelerated protons . we show that under certain astrophysical conditions , high - energy protons in strong background magnetic fields should rapidly decay .",
    "the observation of non - inertial neutrons is less trivial .",
    "notwithstanding the calculation of the @xmath7 decay rate for accelerated neutrons may be of some relevance in situations where they are under the influence of `` relatively '' strong background gravitational fields and , thus , will be also performed .",
    "some features of the @xmath7 and inverse @xmath7 decays for uniformly accelerated nucleons will be discussed in terms of the fulling - davies - unruh ( fdu ) effect .",
    "the fdu effect asserts that the minkowski vacuum corresponds to a thermal bath with respect to uniformly accelerated observers @xcite .",
    "it is perhaps remarkable that although inertial observers associate the inverse @xmath7 decay to the channel @xmath6 , coaccelerated observers associate the _ same _ proton decay event to one of the following channels : @xmath8 @xmath9 or @xmath10 where the absorbed @xmath11 and @xmath12 are rindler particles present in the fdu thermal bath `` attached '' to the proton s frame  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding branching ratios can be also calculated as a function of the proton acceleration .    under a certain restriction",
    ", we can make our semiclassical current to behave as a classical one .",
    "this is suitable to investigate neutrino - antineutrino emission from accelerated electrons .",
    "this process is of relevance in some astrophysical situations as , e.g. , in the cooling of neutron stars .",
    "eventually we compare our results in the proper limit with the ones in the literature obtained by quantizing electrons in a background magnetic field @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ dnc ] we introduce the semiclassical currents and discuss how they model particle decays . in sec .",
    "[ inertial ] , we introduce the weak - interaction action and couple our current to a spin-@xmath0 fermion - antifermion field .",
    "afterwards we calculate the differential transition probability for currents following arbitrary world lines . in sec .",
    "[ accelerated ] we use the results obtained in the previous section to explicitly evaluate the fermion emission rate and radiated power for the particular case of a uniformly accelerated current .",
    "the next two sections , sec .  [ decay ] and sec .  [ neutrino emission ] , are dedicated to analyze in detail the decay of uniformly accelerated protons and neutrons , and the neutrino - antineutrino emission from uniformly accelerated electrons , respectively .",
    "we also comment on the possible astrophysical relevance of our results .",
    "we dedicate sec .",
    "[ discussions ] for our final discussions .",
    "we will use natural units @xmath13 throughout this paper unless stated otherwise .",
    "let us consider a particle in a four - dimensional minkowski spacetime covered by the usual inertial coordinates @xmath14 .",
    "let @xmath15 be the particle s world line and @xmath16 its proper time .",
    "the classical vector current associated with this particle is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a `` small '' coupling constant and @xmath19 .",
    "the current above is suitable to describe a pointlike classical ( i.e. , with no - inner structure ) particle .",
    "eventually it can be used to describe a fermion @xmath20 and antifermion @xmath21 emission from an accelerated particle @xmath22 : @xmath23 ( e.g. , a non - inertial electron emitting a neutrino - antineutrino pair ) .",
    "notwithstanding , this current must be improved in order to allow more general processes of the form @xmath24 where particle @xmath22 turns into particle @xmath25 with a fermion - antifermion pair emission ( e.g. , decay of an accelerated proton into a neutron with a positron - neutrino emission ) .",
    "this is attained by replacing the real coupling constant @xmath18 by an operator - valued function ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath26 this can be regarded as the usual first - quantization procedure , where a classical observable , @xmath18 , is replaced by a self - adjoint operator , @xmath27 , evolved by the one - parameter group of unitary operators @xmath28 . here",
