    "the determination of the primordial @xmath6he ( hereafter he ) abundance and of some other light elements such as d , @xmath7he and @xmath8li , plays an important role in testing cosmological models . in the standard theory of big bang nucleosynthesis ( sbbn ) , given the number of light neutrino species , the abundances of these light elements depend only on one cosmological parameter , the baryon - to - photon number ratio @xmath9 .",
    "because of the strong dependence of its abundance on @xmath9 , deuterium has become the baryometer of choice .",
    "the d / h measurements in damped ly@xmath10 systems appear to converge to a mean primordial value log d / h = @xmath114.56 @xmath1 0.04 , corresponding to a baryon mass fraction @xmath12 = 0.0213 @xmath1 0.001 @xcite .",
    "this estimate of @xmath12 is in excellent agreement with the value of 0.02273 @xmath1 0.00062 obtained by @xcite from analysis of five years of observations with the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) .",
    "although he is not a sensitive baryometer ( @xmath0 depends only logarithmically on the baryon density ) , its primordial abundance depends much more sensitively than that of d on the expansion rate of the universe and on a possible lepton asymmetry in the early universe @xcite .",
    "thus , accurate measurements of the primordial abundance of he are required to check the consistency of sbbn .",
    "however , to detect small deviations from sbbn and make cosmological inferences , @xmath0 has to be determined to a level of accuracy of less than a few percent .",
    "the primordial abundance of he can , in principle , be derived accurately from observations of the he and h emission lines from low - metallicity h ii regions .",
    "several groups have used this technique to derive the primordial he mass fraction @xmath0 , with somewhat different results . in",
    "the most recent study @xcite based on a large sample of 93 spectra of 86 low - metallicity extragalactic h ii regions ( hereafter the hebcd sample ) derived @xmath0 = 0.2472 @xmath1 0.0012 and @xmath0 = 0.2516 @xmath1 0.0011 , using @xcite and @xcite he i emissivities , respectively . on the other hand , @xcite obtained @xmath0 = 0.2477 @xmath1 0.0029 based on a sample of 5 h ii regions , @xcite he i emissivities , and adopting non - zero temperature fluctuations .",
    "@xcite derived @xmath0 = 0.250 @xmath1 0.004 for a sample of 31 h ii regions studied by @xcite , adopting @xcite he i emissivities .",
    "it is generally believed that the accuracy of the determination of the primordial he abundance is limited presently , not so much by statistical uncertainties , but by our ability to account for systematic errors and biases .",
    "there are many known effects we need to correct for to transform the observed he i line intensities into a he abundance .",
    "these effects are : ( 1 ) reddening , ( 2 ) underlying stellar absorption in the he i lines , ( 3 ) collisional excitation of the he i lines which make their intensities deviate from their recombination values , ( 4 ) fluorescence of the he i lines which also make their intensities deviate from their recombination values , ( 5 ) collisional and ( 6 ) fluorescent excitation of the h lines , ( 7 ) the temperature structure of the h ii region and ( 8) its ionization structure .",
    "all these corrections are at a level of a few percent except for effect ( 3 ) that can be much higher , exceeding 10% in the case of the he i @xmath135876 emission line in hot and dense h ii regions .",
    "most of these effects were analyzed and taken into account by @xcite for their hebcd sample .",
    "we present here a new determination of the primordial he abundance .",
    "a new study is warranted because there are several recent new developments that allow more accurate estimates of some of the systematic effects mentioned above .",
    "thus , @xcite have calculated evolutionary stellar population synthesis models with high spectral resolution , so that equivalent widths of h i and he i absorption lines for different ages of single stellar populations and for a wide range of metallicities are now available . furthermore , @xcite has estimated the collisional enhancement of hydrogen balmer lines , while @xcite have considered the fluorescent excitation of balmer lines in gaseous nebulae ( their case d ) .",
    "we incorporate all these new calculations in our new determination of the primordial he abundance .    in  [ method ]",
    ", we briefly discuss the method used to derive he abundances in individual objects and the primordial he abundance from the total sample . in ",
    "[ primo ] , we derive the best value for @xmath0 and the linear regression slope d@xmath14/d@xmath15 .",
    "the cosmological implications of our new results are discussed in  [ cosmo ] .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in  [ summary ] .",
    "as in our previous work ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , we determine the primordial he mass fraction @xmath0 by fitting the data points in the @xmath14  o / h plane with a linear regression line of the form @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the he mass fraction , @xmath15 is the heavy element mass fraction , @xmath18 = ( @xmath19 + @xmath20)@xmath21@xmath22(he@xmath23+he@xmath24 ) is the he abundance , @xmath19 @xmath25 he@xmath23/h@xmath23 and @xmath20 @xmath25 he@xmath24/h@xmath23 are respectively the abundances of singly and doubly ionized he , and @xmath22(he@xmath23+he@xmath24 ) is the ionization correction factor for he .",
    "the slope of the @xmath14  o / h linear regression can be written as : @xmath26 where o and @xmath15 are respectively the mass fractions of oxygen and heavy elements .",
    "we also take into account the depletion of oxygen on dust grains .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the ne / o abundance ratio for low - metallicity bcds is not constant , but increases with increasing oxygen abundance .",
    "this effect is small , with @xmath27logne / o = 0.1 when the oxygen abundance changes from 12+logo / h = 7.0 to 8.6 .",
    "we attribute such a change to oxygen depletion , and correct the oxygen abundance for it , using the log ne / o versus oxygen abundance regression line found by @xcite , and assuming that depletion is absent in galaxies with 12+logo / h = 7.0 .",
    "to derive the parameters of the @xmath14 versus o / h linear regressions , we use the maximum - likelihood method @xcite which takes into account the errors in both @xmath14 and o / h for each object .",
    "following @xcite , we use the five strongest he i @xmath133889 , @xmath134471 , @xmath135876 , @xmath136678 and @xmath137065 emission lines to derive the electron number density @xmath28(he@xmath23 ) and the optical depth @xmath29(@xmath133889 ) .",
    "the he i @xmath133889 and @xmath137065 lines play an important role because they are particularly sensitive to both quantities .",
    "since the he i @xmath133889 line is blended with the h8 @xmath133889 line , we have subtracted the latter , assuming its intensity to be equal to 0.107 @xmath30(h@xmath31 ) @xcite .",
    "the derived @xmath19 abundances depend also on a number of other parameters : the fraction @xmath27@xmath30(h@xmath10)/@xmath30(h@xmath10 ) of the h@xmath10 emission line flux due to collisional excitation , the electron number density @xmath28(he@xmath23 ) , the electron temperature @xmath32(he@xmath23 ) , the equivalent widths ew@xmath33(@xmath133889 ) , ew@xmath33(@xmath134471 ) , ew@xmath33(@xmath135876 ) , ew@xmath33(@xmath136678 ) and ew@xmath33(@xmath137065 ) of he i stellar absorption lines , and the optical depth @xmath29(@xmath133889 ) of the he i @xmath133889 emission line . to determine the best weighted mean value of @xmath19",
    ", we use the monte carlo procedure described in @xcite , randomly varying each of the above parameters within a specified range .    additionally , in those cases when the nebular he ii @xmath134686 emission line was detected , we have added to @xmath19 the abundance of doubly ionized helium @xmath20 @xmath25 he@xmath24/h@xmath23 @xcite .      for the determination of he abundance ,",
    "we adopt he i emissivities from @xcite and take into account the following systematic effects : 1 ) reddening ; 2 ) the temperature structure of the h ii region , i.e. the temperature difference between @xmath32(he@xmath23 ) and @xmath32(o iii ) ; 4 ) underlying stellar he i absorption ; 4 ) collisional and fluorescent excitation of he i lines ; 5 ) collisional and fluorescent excitation of hydrogen lines ; and 6 ) the ionization structure of the h ii region .",
    "most of these effects were analyzed by @xcite ( see also references therein ) .",
    "we define the following set of parameters :    \\1 . the reddening law of @xcite is adopted .",
    "@xcite have shown that he abundances are not sensitive to the particular reddening law adopted .",
    "for example , use of the @xcite reddening curve results in he and other element abundances similar to those obtained with the @xcite reddening law . the extinction coefficient @xmath34(h@xmath31 )",
    "is derived from the observed hydrogen balmer decrement , after correcting the h@xmath10 , h@xmath31 , h@xmath35 and h@xmath36 line fluxes for the effects of collisional and fluorescent excitation .",
    "finally , all emission lines are corrected for reddening , adopting the derived @xmath34(h@xmath31 ) .",
    "the electron temperature of the he@xmath23 zone is varied in the range @xmath32(he@xmath23 ) = ( 0.95  1.0)@xmath21@xmath32(o iii ) .",
    "we have chosen this range following the work of @xcite and @xcite who have derived the electron temperature in the h@xmath23 zone from the balmer and paschen discontinuities in the spectra of more than 100 h ii regions , and showed that @xmath32(h@xmath23 ) differs from @xmath32(o iii ) by not more than 5% .",
    "we also assume that @xmath32(he@xmath23 ) = @xmath32(h@xmath23 ) because the h@xmath23 and he@xmath23 zones in our objects are nearly coincident .",
    "oxygen abundances are calculated by considering two possible values of the electron temperature : 1 ) @xmath32 = @xmath32(he@xmath23 ) and 2 ) @xmath32 = @xmath32(o iii ) .",
    "@xmath28(he@xmath23 ) and @xmath29(@xmath133889 ) are varied respectively in the ranges 10  450 @xmath37 and 0  5 , typical for extragalactic h ii regions .",

    "the fraction of h@xmath31 , h@xmath35 and h@xmath36 emission due to collisional excitation is adopted to be 60% that of the h@xmath10 emission , in accordance with @xcite .",
    "we note that @xcite underestimated that fraction for h@xmath31 , adopting a value of only 1/3 , and neglected altogether to correct the h@xmath35 and h@xmath36 emission lines for collisional excitation .",
    "@xcite have shown that the fraction of h@xmath31 emission due to fluorescent excitation by the far - uv non - ionizing stellar continuum could be as high as 2% , and somewhat lower for the h@xmath10 emission ( their case d ) .",
    "we have adopted the conservative value of 1% for the fraction of h@xmath10 , h@xmath31 , h@xmath35 and h@xmath36 emission due to fluorescent excitation , since a similar effect could affect the he i emission lines and partly compensate the effect for the balmer h lines ( the he abundance is calculated relative to that of h ) .    \\7 .",

    "the equivalent widths of the other absorption lines are fixed according to the ratios ew@xmath33(@xmath133889 ) / ew@xmath33(@xmath134471 ) = 1.0 , ew@xmath33(@xmath135876 ) / ew@xmath33(@xmath134471 ) = 0.8 , ew@xmath33(@xmath136678 ) / ew@xmath33(@xmath134471 ) = 0.4 and ew@xmath33(@xmath137065 ) / ew@xmath33(@xmath134471 ) = 0.4 .",

    "two @xmath14  o / h linear regressions for the hebcd galaxy sample of @xcite , with the above set of parameters , are shown in fig .",
    "the two regression lines differ in the way oxygen abundances have been calculated . for the first regression line ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) , oxygen abundances have been derived by setting the temperature of the o@xmath39 zone equal to @xmath32(he@xmath23 ) , while for the second ( fig .",

    "the 2% difference is due to the inclusion of the correction for fluorescent excitation of h lines , the correction for a larger correction for collisional excitation to the h@xmath31 flux and larger adopted equivalent widths of the stellar he i 5876 , 6678 and 7065 absorption lines .",
    "we adopt the value of @xmath0 from fig .",
    "[ fig1]a , where both o / h and @xmath14 are calculated with the same temperature @xmath32 = @xmath32(he@xmath23 ) .",
    "we have varied the ranges of some parameters to study how the value of @xmath0 is affected by these variations .",
    "we have found that varying the fraction of fluorescent excitation of the hydrogen lines between 0% and 2% , and/or setting @xmath32(he@xmath23 ) = @xmath32(o iii ) or changing @xmath32(he@xmath23 ) in the range ( 0.9  1.0)@xmath21 @xmath32(o iii ) ( instead of making it change between 0.95 and 1.0 @xmath21 @xmath32(o iii ) ) , result in a change of @xmath0 between 0.254 and 0.258 .",

    "@xmath1 0.0050(syst . ) , where `` stat '' and `` syst '' refer to statistical and systematic errors , respectively .",
    "thus , the value of @xmath0 derived in this paper , is 3.3% greater than the value of 0.2482 obtained from the 3yr wmap data , assuming sbbn @xcite .",
    "however , it is consistent with the @xmath0 = 0.25@xmath40 obtained by @xcite from the available wmap , acbar , cbi , and boomerang data [ actually , the peak value in their one - dimensional marginalized distribution of @xmath0 ( their fig.3 ) is equal to 0.254 ] .    using eq .",

    "its value derived from observations of low - metallicity halo stars @xcite is @xmath42 5 times lower than the one obtained from the wmap analysis @xcite . because mechanisms that may lead to a reduction of the @xmath8li primordial abundance , such as diffusion or rotationally induced mixing , are not well understood and we do not know how to correct for them , we have adopted the value of the primordial abundance of @xmath8li abundance as derived from the 5yr wmap data of @xcite .",
    "the predicted primordial abundances of light elements depend on the adopted neutron life - time @xmath5 .",

    "we note that @xmath44 and @xmath3 only slightly depend on the value of the @xmath8li abundance .",
    "they are decreased by 3% and 2% , respectively , if the observed @xmath8li abundance by @xcite is adopted .",
    "the joint fit of @xmath9 and @xmath3 is shown in figures [ fig2]a and [ fig2]b for the two values of @xmath5 .",
    "the 1@xmath2 ( @xmath41  @xmath43 = 1.0 ) and 2@xmath2 ( @xmath41  @xmath43 = 2.71 ) deviations are shown respectively by the thin and thick solid lines .",

    "we note that , although both values are consistent with @xmath3 = 4.4 @xmath1 1.5 derived from the analysis of 5yr wmap observations @xcite , the primordial helium abundance sets tighter constraints on the effective number of neutrino species than the cmb data , the error bars of @xmath3 being approximately half as large in the first case as compared to the latter case .",

    "an equivalent number of neutrino flavors in the range 3.68  3.80 , depending on the lifetime of the neutron , is required .",

    "<S> these include collisional and fluorescent enhancements of he i recombination lines , underlying he i stellar absorption lines , collisional and fluorescent excitation of hydrogen lines and temperature and ionization structure of the h ii region . </S>",
    "<S> using monte carlo methods to solve simultaneously for the above systematic effects , we find the best value to be @xmath0 = 0.2565 @xmath1 0.0010(stat . ) </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 0.0050(syst . ) . this value is higher at the 2@xmath2 level than the value given by standard big bang nucleosynthesis ( sbbn ) , implying deviations from it . </S>",
    "<S> the effective number of light neutrino species @xmath3 is equal to 3.68@xmath4 ( 2@xmath2 ) and 3.80@xmath4 ( 2@xmath2 ) for a neutron lifetime @xmath5 equal to 885.4 @xmath1 0.9 s and 878.5 @xmath1 0.8 s , respectively , i.e. it is larger than the experimental value of 2.993@xmath10.011 . </S>"
