    "in this paper , we compare the dynamics of solar active - region `` moss '' with the dynamics of non - mossy plage .",
    "the context is the dynamical structure of the transition region as interface between the chromosphere and the corona .",
    "the transition region is highly complex due to the fine structure of the chromosphere , which is dominated on small scales by jet - like features .",
    "the latter are observed in  as spicules at the limb , and as active - region fibrils and quiet - sun mottles on the disk .",
    "they bring cold ( @xmath9 ) , dense plasma up to greater heights than expected from hydrostatic equilibrium ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "understanding the formation and behavior of these structures is of key importance , because their role as agents in the momentum and energy balances of the outer solar atmosphere remains unclear .",
    "moss is characterized by highly dynamic dark inclusions over a bright background in active - region plages as observed in image sequences taken through the euv passbands of the transition region and coronal explorer ( trace , * ? ? ?",
    "it is best visible in images taken in the  passband around @xmath10 , but it is also present in images taken in the other euv passbands around @xmath7 ( ) and @xmath11 ( ) .",
    "the bright background consists of @xmath12 foot points of hot , high - pressure coronal loops at heights low enough to be obscured by cool chromospheric jets @xcite .",
    "non - mossy plage does not have such overlying high - density coronal loops , so that its emission in the trace euv passbands is of lower intensity and formed over a large height range .",
    "previous studies by @xcite and @xcite concentrated on the spatial correlations between various chromospheric and transition - region diagnostics in plage .",
    "@xcite studied individual positions in plage with wavelet techniques , and found that oscillations in moss correspond well with oscillations in  diagnostics , and occasionally also with oscillations in photospheric dopplergrams . in the present analysis ,",
    "we concentrate on temporal brightness modulations in image sequences of mossy and non - mossy plage taken in trace s euv @xmath3 and @xmath7    passbands and its uv passbands around @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 .",
    "we analyzed image sequences recorded simultaneously on 1999 june  4 between 8:31 and 9:43  ut and on 1998 july  1 between 19:36 and 20:53  ut .",
    "the target of the 1999 observations was plage around noaa active region 8558 at a heliocentric viewing angle of @xmath13  degrees ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "trace took images sequentially in the three uv passbands at @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , and in the  euv passband at @xmath10 , at a cadence of @xmath15 .",
    "the 1998 observations targeted plage around noaa active region 8235 at a heliocentric viewing angle of @xmath16  degrees ( @xmath17 ) in the @xmath1    uv passband and in the euv @xmath3    ( ) and @xmath7    ( ) passbands .",
    "the size of all images is @xmath18  pixels , and their angular resolution is @xmath19 per pixel",
    ". the uv passbands sample the low chromosphere in the respective continua , but the @xmath0 and @xmath1    passbands also have a transition - region contribution from  lines .",
    "the images were corrected for dark current and were flat - fielded by the solarsoft procedure ` trace_prep ` described in the trace analysis guide .",
    "cosmic ray hits were removed iteratively from each image with a median filter that removes spikes exceeding a @xmath20 threshold and replaces them with the median of the surrounding pixels until less than @xmath21 particle hits are detected .",
    "the uv sequences were subsequently aligned with high precision using the fourier cross - correlation technique implemented in the solarsoft routine ` tr_get_disp ` in three steps following the procedure developed by .",
    "the euv sequences of the 1999 observations were each first aligned frame by frame .",
    "next , the average displacement to the @xmath1    uv passband was calculated by comparing the position of the light bridge of the large sunspot around @xmath22 .",
    "this light bridge has a cross - like shape in the @xmath1    image .",
    "the corona above it is hot and of high - pressure , so that the @xmath3    emission is formed at low altitude , and closely matches the @xmath1    emission in shape .",
    "this allows for accurate co - alignment of the uv and euv passbands .",
    "the final sequence was resampled in a single interpolation step from the original image sequence .",
    "there also are several white - light images in the 1999 observations .",
    "we use these to identify the positions of the sunspots and pores in the field of view .",
    "we align each of the white - light images to the logarithm of the brightness of the @xmath1    image nearest in time .",
    "the 1998 sequences are similar , except for the absence of @xmath0 and @xmath23    uv sequences , and the addition of a @xmath7    sequence .",
    "we process them akin to the 1999 sequences , simplifying the procedure of to align the images of the @xmath1    sequence , and treating the @xmath7    sequence the same as the @xmath3    sequence . in this case , the average offset to the @xmath1    sequence was computed by alignment on the central plage around @xmath24 ( cf .",

    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1    passbands include the  lines at @xmath25 and @xmath26 that are formed at temperatures around @xmath27@xmath28 , and sample the transition region .",
    "there are also considerable contributions from the surrounding continuum due to the broad passbands ( @xmath13 and @xmath29 , respectively ) .",
    "the @xmath23    passband has a width of @xmath30 , but does not contain the  lines . the @xmath3    passband samples emission from the transition region and low corona primarily from  and  ions at temperatures of about @xmath31 .",

    "it is similar to the @xmath3    passband , sampling much the same structures in the transition region and low corona .",
    "we selected mossy and non - mossy plage in the field of view for analysis .",
    "we applied a suitable high - pass brightness threshold to the time - averaged @xmath3    sequence , and then selected those areas that contain moss to produce the mask . for the non - mossy plage",
    ", we select areas from a mask created by applying a high - pass brightness threshold to the time - averaged @xmath33 sequence and a low - pass threshold to the average of the @xmath3    sequence .",
    "some non - mossy plage in the 1999 observations is not usable , because it is covered by loops in the @xmath3    sequence .",
    "there is no usable non - mossy plage in the 1998 observations .",
    "the resulting masks are smoothed with @xmath34-pixel boxcar averaging and restricted to those pixels that do not suffer from partial sampling due to solar rotation and image motions . in case of the 1999 observations",
    ", we also exclude those pixels that are insufficiently bright in the average white - light image in order to mask off the sunspots and pores .",
    "the resulting mossy - plage mask for the 1999 observations contains seven patches with a total surface area of @xmath35  pixels , while the mask for the 1998 observations consists of a single patch of @xmath36  pixels .",
    "the 1999 non - moss mask has @xmath37  pixels in three patches .",
    "figure  [ fig : sample1999 ] shows the outlines of masks of mossy ( black ) and of non - mossy plage ( white ) , together with the sunspot mask indicated by dashed black contours .",
    "figure  [ fig : sample1998 ] shows the mossy - plage mask outlined in black .",
    "we computed fourier power , coherence , and phase - difference spectra averaged over pixels in mossy and in non - mossy plage using the masks shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : sample1999 ] and  [ fig : sample1998 ] . following and",
    ", the power and coherence were averaged directly over all relevant pixels .",
    "we calculated the coherence per pixel using frequency smoothing over 5 bins .    in the evaluation of phase differences , we employed averaging of the fourier cross - power vectors as introduced by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this method avoids the problems that arise in averaging due to the @xmath38 ambiguity , and in addition weighs the samples with their cross - power amplitude .",
    "furthermore , in the case of pure noise , the summation of the cross - power vectors resembles a random walk around the origin , thus producing a random phase .",
    "as long as the phase - difference spectrum does not display random variation from one frequency to the next , the input contains a signal , be it solar , instrumental , or the result of data processing .",
    "a more recent analysis by also follows this method of computing phase differences .",
    "the fourier spectra resulting from the 1999 sequences are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : confusomaximus ] . the power , coherence , and phase - difference spectra in the leftmost two columns are similar to those of and , but are less accurate , because of the smaller number of pixels transmitted by the mask and the shorter sequence length .",
    "note that mossy and non - mossy plage exhibit similar behavior .",
    "the phase differences are well - defined and small",
    ".    the @xmath3    passband samples much hotter structures of the atmosphere . in non - mossy",
    "plage the @xmath23@xmath3    and @xmath1@xmath3    phase - difference spectra are very noisy , which is indicative of the lack of any correspondence . however , the @xmath0@xmath3    phase - difference spectrum is nearly constant at zero degrees up to high frequency , about @xmath39 .",
    "the mossy plage exhibits radically different behavior .",
    "all three uv sequences show a well - defined phase difference with the @xmath3    sequence , with a strong upward trend up to about @xmath40 .",
    "the @xmath1 and @xmath0@xmath3    phase - difference spectra show a flat tail at @xmath41  degrees beyond @xmath40 .",
    "the @xmath23    sequence ( third column ) wraps around a second time , while the @xmath1    sequence ( fourth column ) reaches a higher phase difference than the @xmath0    sequence ( fifth column ) .",
    "the frequency at which the phase difference ceases the upward trend and falls to zero appears to shift somewhat towards lower frequencies .",
    "the flat tail at zero degree is most pronounced in the @xmath0@xmath3    panel ( fifth column ) .",
    "it appears to be very noisy in the @xmath23@xmath3    panel ( third column ) .",
    "the power spectra are normalized by their value in the second frequency bin , so they can only be compared relatively .",
    "the mossy - plage power spectra have a lower relative noise floor on account of the larger brightness variation . in the uv passbands ,",
    "the power hump due to @xmath42-minute oscillations is smaller in mossy plage than in non - mossy plage .",
    "it is absent in the @xmath3    power spectra for either network or mossy plage .",
    "the coherence spectra show large values at the lowest and highest frequencies , which however is an artifact resulting from the 5-bin frequency smoothing .",
    "the coherence is small for the uv versus euv comparisons , which indicates that the signals in the phase - difference spectra are weak , as is shown by the large scatter in the grayscale background of the phase - difference panels .",
    "in contrast , in the first two columns the strong signal has coherence well above the noise floor , and small grayscale scatter around the average value .",
    "figure  [ fig : confuse1998 ] shows the results for the 1998 sequences .",
    "the upward trend is present in both the @xmath1@xmath3    and the @xmath1@xmath7    phase - difference spectra , up to about @xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath3@xmath7    phase - difference spectrum shows a slightly negative phase difference up to @xmath8 with reasonable coherence , and a constant zero - degree phase difference beyond .",
    "the power spectra show behavior similar to those in fig .",
    "[ fig : confusomaximus ] .",
    "the well - defined @xmath0@xmath3    phase difference for non - mossy plage in the top - rightmost panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : confusomaximus ] shows that there is common modulation in the @xmath0 and the @xmath3    sequences .",
    "the correspondence is weak , as is evident from the extensive scatter and the low coherence , but nevertheless significant .",
    "the @xmath1 and @xmath23@xmath3    panels in the top row show noise , indicating that this apparent signal is not caused by low brightness , cadence irregularity , or non - simultaneous sampling .",
    "we attribute the larger noise in these panels to the smaller or absent contribution of the  lines , which sample some of the structures and dynamics governing the @xmath3    signal .",
    "the @xmath1    panel shows somewhat less noise than the @xmath23    one , as is expected from the small contribution of  in case of the former , and its absence in the latter . it does not seem unreasonable to assume there is some signal present in the @xmath1@xmath3    phase - difference spectrum , but drowned in noise due to the reduced  contribution .",
    "we can not establish from these observations what the cause is of the apparent dynamical correspondence between the @xmath3 and @xmath0    brightness in non - mossy plage .",
    "small - scale energy deposition by , e.g. , wave energy deposition , reconnection , or turbulent heating may cause simultaneous brightening . on the other hand",
    ", the @xmath3    passband also contains  lines , which sample temperatures similar to the  lines .",
    "alternatively , coronal rain in overlying loops may cause intermittent brightening in both diagnostics . despite our effort to select only those regions that do not suffer much from @xmath3    loops , avoiding them",
    "completely is impossible .",
    "a study of loop areas without underlying plage shows random phase difference , suggesting that they are not to blame . however , the statistics are poor as a result of a limited number of pixels in the loop mask .",
    "summarizing , it is clear that the weak signal is somehow related to the  lines sampled best by the @xmath0    passband , and less so by the @xmath1    one .",
    "a number of processes may contribute to the signal , and we can not exclude with certainty that it is caused by overlying loops rather than by the plage .      there is a strong upward trend in all uv  euv phase - difference spectra at low frequencies .",
    "it continues up to higher frequency in the @xmath1@xmath3    phase - difference spectrum than in the @xmath0@xmath3    spectrum , and yet further in the @xmath23@xmath3    spectrum .",
    "the upward trend extends to frequencies up to @xmath40 in the 1999 sequences , and somewhat further in the 1998 sequences .",
    "the phase differences depend linearly on frequency , suggesting that disturbances propagating upward through strong flux tubes travel a fixed distance with a velocity independent of frequency .",
    "it wraps around to zero at around @xmath43-minute periods , indicating a delay of approximately @xmath44 between the lower and higher layers . in principle",
    ", one would expect the slope of the trend to change for spectra of different uv  euv pairs , because of the height difference between the layers sampled by the passbands .",
    "however , the linear relation appears the same within experimental errors in all uv  euv phase - difference spectra , irrespectively of the specific uv or euv passband .",
    "we attribute this to the large height difference between the layers sampled by uv and the euv passbands .",
    "pairs of uv or euv passbands sample layers with comparatively small height difference , as indicated by a phase difference close to zero degrees ( fig .",
    "[ fig : confusomaximus ] first and second column , and fig .",
    "[ fig : confuse1998 ] third column ) , so that the height difference and associated travel time do not depend much on the choice of uv or euv passband .",
    "what is the upward trend caused by ?",
    "the trend is observed in all uv passbands , and it is therefore not related to  emission , which is present only in the @xmath0 and @xmath1    passbands .",
    "also , it is not seen in the non - mossy panels , indicating that it is unlikely to be an artifact of instrumental origin or related to data processing .",
    "it thus seems of a solar origin : brightness changes in the uv passbands are followed about @xmath44 later by changes in the emission in the euv passbands .",
    "the uv passbands are dominated by emission from low chromospheric heights .",
    "plage is brighter than its surroundings in these passbands .",
    "this excess brightness is related to enhanced chromospheric heating in areas of strong magnetic flux .",
    "the euv passbands in mossy plage are dominated by emission from @xmath45@xmath46 plasma in a thin layer at the transition - region foot points of hot ( @xmath47@xmath48 ) coronal loops .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite showed that moss is heated by thermal conduction from the hot loops above the moss .",
    "our observations indicate that brightness changes on timescales of @xmath42@xmath49  minutes in the low chromosphere are followed by brightness changes on similar timescales in the upper transition region about @xmath44 later .",
    "this relationship has not been reported before and may offer an intriguing clue to the nature of chromospheric and coronal heating , and how they are related .    what is the cause of this relationship ?",
    "it is difficult to imagine that real wave packets with such long periods are present and propagating .",
    "changes on timescales of order @xmath50@xmath49  minutes are typically considered to be dominated by solar evolution , i.e. , slow variations of the atmosphere because of , e.g. , evolution of the magnetic network or plage as a result of buffeting by convective flows , reconfiguration or emergence of magnetic field , etc .",
    "disturbances associated with such slow changes may propagate up in the atmosphere , while real wave packets would find it difficult to maintain their oscillatory identity .",
    "it would seem that our observations show solar evolution causing chromospheric brightness changes that are followed by an associated modulation in upper transition - region brightness .    the fixed time delay of about @xmath44 may provide an important clue to the nature of the correlation between the chromosphere and the upper transition region .",
    "the uv passbands have formation heights of a few hundred km above the photosphere @xcite .",
    "the euv moss is estimate to be formed several thousand km above the photosphere , over a range of heights between @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , since it is buffeted up and down by dynamic fibrils that shoot up from the chromosphere .",
    "a height difference between uv and euv passband formation heights of order @xmath53@xmath54 would lead to propagation speeds between @xmath55 and @xmath56 , assuming a vertical wave guide .",
    "these velocities are too low for slow - mode magnetosonic disturbances if the moss occurs at @xmath57 , and low , but perhaps possible if the moss occurs at @xmath54 .",
    "while the magnetic field is likely mostly vertical in the interior of plage , it can be strongly inclined at the edges .",
    "however , for our pixel - based analysis , the large height difference and the size of the trace pixels limits the angle to about @xmath50  degrees .",
    "the maximum inclinations are then @xmath58 and @xmath59  degrees for the 1999 and 1998 observations , respectively , assuming that the offset introduced by the viewing angle is not ( partly ) corrected by the alignment procedure . for the 1999 observations",
    ", these corrections could increase the estimated propagation speeds to more reasonable values between @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the correction is small ( @xmath62 ) for the 1998 observations .",
    "is it possible for slow - mode disturbances with long periods of @xmath42@xmath49  minutes to actually propagate upward ? while their periods are longer than the acoustic cutoff , it is possible for the initial disturbance , i.e. , before any evanescent wave pattern is established , to propagate .",
    "so , perhaps the density and temperature perturbations associated with slow - mode disturbances , maybe driven by granulation , supergranulation , waves , or reconnection , could lead to chromospheric brightness changes , and upper transition - region brightness changes @xmath44 later .",
    "note , however , that the time delay of @xmath43  minutes is quite long for slow - mode disturbances .",
    "this problem is even more severe for fast magneto - acoustic disturbances .",
    "perhaps then the relationship between chromospheric and upper transition - region brightness is not mediated by waves , but indicative of a connection between chromospheric and coronal heating mechanisms ?",
    "in such a scenario , heating in the chromosphere ( e.g. , through dissipation of currents ) would be followed by heating in the corona , which , some time later , would lead to increased emission in the transition - region moss , since the latter is heated by thermal conduction from hot loops above . in this case , the time delay would be determined by a combination of the delay between chromospheric and coronal heating events , and the timescale associated with moss brightness changes .",
    "the brightness of moss emission can change because of a change in temperature ( related to thermal conduction ) , and because of a change in density ( related to chromospheric evaporation or coronal loop dynamics ) .",
    "it is difficult to estimate these timescales without advanced numerical models .",
    "similarly , the delay between chromospheric and coronal heating events is unknown , and can only be addressed by advanced radiative magnetohydrodynamics simulations of the low atmosphere that include the corona .",
    "our findings can thus provide an interesting observational constraint on chromospheric and coronal heating models .",
    "the phase difference of the @xmath1 or @xmath0    sequence in relation to the @xmath3    one is close to zero for frequencies exceeding @xmath63 in the 1999 june  4 sequences .",
    "the 1998 sequences have more noise due to a reduced number of pixels in the mossy - plage mask , but the same behavior appears present in the @xmath1@xmath3    phase - difference spectrum between @xmath64  and @xmath65 .",
    "intensity changes in moss are known to be directly related to chromospheric fibrils ( as observed in ) that have lifetimes around @xmath42  minutes @xcite .",
    "we therefore attribute this behavior to active - region fibrils that periodically occult the bright foot points of hot loops .",
    "the `` fibrils shutter '' causes simultaneous extinction of  and  emission , thus producing a signal with zero phase difference .",
    "it has fourier power up to high frequencies due to its instantaneous blocking of bright foot points , causing step - like intensity modulation .",
    "the @xmath1    passband includes the  lines , but with more surrounding continuum than the @xmath0    passband .",
    "it is affected by the shutter , as is indicated by the turn to zero - degrees phase difference , but not as much as the @xmath0    sequence . the @xmath1@xmath7    phase - difference spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : confuse1998 ] second column ) is expected to behave in a similar fashion .",
    "there is too much noise , however , to confirm this , most likely because moss becomes less pronounced in the euv passbands at longer wavelengths .",
    "the fibril shutter does not act on the @xmath23    sequence , since it does not include the  lines .",
    "accordingly , it does not show a clear zero - degree phase difference .",
    "it appears that the @xmath23@xmath3    phase - difference spectrum does not continue its upward trend to the nyquist frequency of our observations , but becomes noisy and flattens out somewhat around @xmath64@xmath39 .",
    "many non - linear effects may disrupt the process that causes the trend at higher frequencies .",
    "there is no evolution on such short time scales , so that the trend may disappear if it is caused by evolutionary processes .      figure  [ fig : cartoon ] shows a cartoon of mossy plage .",
    "fibrils intermittently obscure , , and  emission , but do not affect emission from the uv continuum .",
    "a signal with a broad signature in fourier space at low frequencies propagates upward .",
    "the observer thus measures the signal propagating from low layers to higher ones while it is modulated with an external fibril shutter .",
    "the timing of the shutter is identical in all passbands , but with varying efficiency .",
    "one can use a toy model to confirm that an upward propagating signal with a superimposed shutter reproduces the phase - difference spectrum observed in mossy plage .",
    "artificial observations were constructed with identical exponential power spectra , but the upper layer was retarded by @xmath66  degrees per  mhz ( @xmath67  s ) .",
    "the shutter is simulated by @xmath68-s wide block functions with a period of @xmath69 .",
    "the reduced effect of the shutter on the uv passbands was simulated by applying @xmath70 shutter to the intensity of the lower level , and @xmath71 to the upper level .",
    "we so created 200 independent samples , and computed an average phase - difference spectrum from them .",
    "the result is represented by the solid curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasesim ] .",
    "it exhibits the desired behavior , i.e. , a strong upward trend at low frequencies , and a small phase difference at high ones .",
    "the dotted curve displays the phase - difference spectrum if the shutter is not installed .",
    "it shows the linear dependence on frequency that was inserted into the artificial observations .",
    "the point at which the trend turns toward zero phase difference can be adjusted toward lower frequency by decreasing the period of the shutter , or by increasing the spread in the period , the efficiency of the shutter , or the slope of the power spectrum .",
    "the observed @xmath3@xmath7    phase - difference spectrum is reassuring in that it indeed shows near - zero degrees up to the nyquist frequency , with little noise up to @xmath6 .",
    "the shutter causes a phase difference of zero degrees , starting at as little as @xmath8 and continuing up to the nyquist frequency .",
    "@xcite similarly found good correlation and zero second lag time between the @xmath3 and @xmath7    passbands .",
    "the increased noise upward from @xmath6 is most likely due to the reduced clarity of moss in the @xmath7    passband as compared to the @xmath3    one .",
    "the spectrum has a dip around @xmath72 , similar to the @xmath23@xmath1    and @xmath23@xmath0    phase - differences spectra ( fig .",
    "[ fig : confusomaximus ] first and second column ) .",
    "the latter is caused by reversed granulation .",
    "however , there is no reversed granulation visible in the @xmath3 or @xmath7    passband .",
    "it is tempting to assume that this dip is evidence of loop cooling .",
    "this would cause a slight delay between corresponding passbands , with emission in @xmath4 preceding @xmath10 .",
    "it reaches a minimum of about @xmath73  degrees at @xmath74 , corresponding with a time delay of @xmath75 .",
    "@xcite find longer cooling times .",
    "the loops they studied are less dense and colder than those that originate from mossy plage , that are expected to have a steeper gradient and therefore have a shorter cooling time .",
    "we have compared phase - difference spectra between the trace uv passbands around @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 and the euv passbands around @xmath3 and @xmath4 in non - mossy and mossy plage .",
    "we find a nearly constant zero phase difference between the @xmath0 and @xmath3    passbands in non - mossy plage .",
    "we attribute this to  emission in the @xmath0    passband that corresponds with emission in the @xmath3    passband , possibly from small - scale energy deposition events , from  contamination in the @xmath3    passband , or from coronal rain in loops overlying the non - mossy plage .",
    "the uv  euv phase - difference spectra in mossy plage show a strong upward trend with increasing frequency from zero up to @xmath5@xmath6 . beyond @xmath5@xmath6 , they show a constant zero phase difference . in the @xmath3@xmath23    phase - difference spectrum , the upward trend continues to higher frequencies than in the @xmath3@xmath1    spectrum .",
    "it continues yet further in the @xmath3@xmath0    spectrum .",
    "its absence in the non - mossy panels indicates that it is not an artifact of instrumental origin , or due to data processing",
    ".    a possible cause of the upward trend in the phase - difference spectrum might be propagation of slow - mode magnetosonic disturbances .",
    "however , the delay of @xmath44 sets a low average propagation speed .",
    "alternatively , it may be that chromospheric and coronal heating may be somehow correlated , so that heating in the chromosphere is followed by heating in the upper transition region through thermal conduction from above by excess coronal heating .",
    "such a connection between chromospheric and coronal heating is potentially very interesting for heating models .",
    "we attribute the zero phase difference at higher frequencies in mossy plage to active - region fibrils occulting the foot points of hot loops , causing moss in the euv passbands , and also causing simultaneous extinction of the  lines in the @xmath1 and @xmath0    passbands .",
    "the @xmath23    passband does not include the  lines , and is therefore not affected by the shutter - like action of the fibrils .",
    "a simple toy model reproduces this behavior well .",
    "the @xmath3@xmath7    phase - difference spectrum of mossy plage shows a shallow dip up to about @xmath8 .",

    "<S> the transition from this upward trend to zero phase difference at higher frequencies is due to the intermittent obscuration by fibrils that occult the foot points of hot loops , which are bright in the euv and  lines , in oscillatory manner . </S>"
