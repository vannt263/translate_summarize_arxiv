    "<S> accurate density - functional based calculations have been performed on the co@xmath0(hmp)@xmath0(ch@xmath1oh)@xmath0cl@xmath0 molecular magnet where hmp is deprotonated hydroxymethyl pyridine . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the experimentally observed staggered geometry , we identify two isomers , referred to as eclipsed and half - staggered / half - eclipsed , that are reasonably low in energy . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations show that the magnetic anisotropy is strongly dependent on the pyridine - pyridine separation and that the three structures exhibit easy axis , easy plane and triaxial behavior . </S>",
    "<S> other effects such as partial reprotonation of the hmp is considered .    </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic molecules containing transition metal atoms are being widely studied due to potential technological applications for information storage and quantum computing @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic molecules show magnetic hysteresis behavior reminiscent of single domain magnets and exhibit the phenomenon of quantum tunneling of magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> observation of such behavior in a molecular magnet is greatly facilitated by a reasonably high net spin and a large magnetic anisotropy energy ( mae ) . </S>",
    "<S> a very recent experimental report of a single molecule magnet consisting of co@xmath0(hmp)@xmath0(ch@xmath1oh)@xmath0cl@xmath0 where hmp- is the deprotonated hydroxymethylpyridine , suggests that this molecule is quite promising since the magnetic anistropy energy per transition metal atom is high (  25 - 50k ) @xcite compared to other magnetic molecules fe@xmath2-tacn @xcite , mn@xmath3-acetate @xcite where it is (  3 - 6k ) . </S>",
    "<S> the reported ferromagnetic ordering of the co@xmath0 molecule also differs qualitatively from the ferrimagnetic spin ordering observed in the mn@xmath3 and fe@xmath2 . the negative anisotropy energy for a transition metal with more than 5 d electrons is also considered to be unusual .    </S>",
    "<S> in order to gain more insight into the properties of this molecule , we have carried out a detailed _ ab initio _ study of the electronic structure and magnetic anisotropy energy of [ co@xmath0(hmp)@xmath0(ch@xmath1oh)@xmath0cl@xmath0 ] for different conformers . </S>",
    "<S> density functional theory @xcite based all - electron , spin - polarized calculations were carried out with the nrlmol code @xcite within the generalized gradient approximation to the exchange - correlation functional @xcite . in the experimentally obtained co@xmath0 cluster @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the four cobalt atoms in the molecule are bonded to organic hydroxy - methyl - pyridine(hmp ) ligands ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ geom](a ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the four co(ii ) atoms and the four oxygens from the ch@xmath5o@xmath6 radicals of the hmp ligand form an inner cubane structure . </S>",
    "<S> the experimentally observed molecule exhibits s@xmath0 point group symmetry and is made up of four units where each 22-atom unit ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ geom](b ) ) consists of co@xmath7 , cl@xmath6 , ch@xmath1oh and the hmp@xmath6 ligand . an eclipsed geometrical isomer ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ geom2](a ) ) can be generated by continuously distorting the lower half of the staggered experimental geometry or from the inequivalent 22-atom complex from the group of order 4 generated from ( xyz ) @xmath8 ( -x ,- y , z ) and ( xyz ) @xmath8 ( y , x ,- z ) . </S>",
    "<S> another energetically competive structure ( fig . [ geom2](b ) ) , which we refer to as half staggered and half eclipsed ( hshe ) , can be generated by rotating and appropriately reorienting only the cl and ligands on the lower half of the experimental structure . </S>",
    "<S> this structure has one symmetry operation [ ( xyz)@xmath8 ( x ,- y ,- z ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> complete geometry optimizations were carried out for each conformer .    </S>",
    "<S> the starting parameters for the experimentally reported staggered geometry were taken from the reported isostructure of the [ ni@xmath0(hmp)@xmath0(ch@xmath1oh)@xmath0cl@xmath0 ] @xcite molecular crystal . upon relaxation , the volume of the molecule increases due to the repulsion of the hmp ligands in parallel positions . </S>",
    "<S> the eclipsed structure was found to be higher in energy than the staggered structure by 2.77 ev . </S>",
    "<S> since this energy difference is probably due to intraplanar and interplanar steric repulsions , we have been motivated to look at the half - staggered and half - eclipsed geometry as well . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the relaxed hshe geometry is only 0.79 ev above the experimental geometry . </S>",
    "<S> the cohesive energy was found to be approximately 4.7 ev / atom for all structures .    </S>",
    "<S> the spin - projected total density of states ( dos ) as well as the co d density of states of the staggered structure are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ dos ] . the fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ dos ] clearly shows that the states near the fermi level arises mainly from the co atoms . </S>",
    "<S> these states also contain minor contributions from the oxygen and chlorine atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the co d majority states are fully occupied . </S>",
    "<S> the figure shows that both the homo and the lumo belongs to the minority spin co _ d _ levels which is true in all the structures . </S>",
    "<S> the minority gap in the staggered structure is 0.55 ev . </S>",
    "<S> a smaller gap leads to a higher value of the magnetic anisotropy energy . </S>",
    "<S> the gap is found to be highly sensitive to the orientation of the ligands .    the spin - density in a sphere of radius 2.6 a.u . </S>",
    "<S> around each co atom shows that co atoms have a local moment of 3 @xmath9 which is also expected from electron counting considerations . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a ferromagnetic structure with a total moment of 12 @xmath9 ( or s=6 ) for all isomers and is in agreement with experiment @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the orientation of the hmp ligands does not affect the magnetic moment . </S>",
    "<S> an isolated co@xmath0o@xmath0 cubane is also found to possess a magnetic moment of 12 . </S>",
    "<S> our investigation on the effect of hydrogen dopants shows that the inclusion of additional hydrogens leads to a partial reprotonation of the cubane oc - ch@xmath5 groups and insertion of the electrons into the vacant minority co@xmath10 states just above the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> this reduces the magnetic moment by 1 @xmath9 per hydrogen atom .    </S>",
    "<S> our calculations have shown that the states near the fermi level are dominated by the cobalt d states with both the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals ( homo and lumo ) belonging to the minority spin co d levels . </S>",
    "<S> the homo - lumo gap in the staggered structure is 0.55 ev . </S>",
    "<S> the gap is found to be highly sensitive to the orientation of the ligands . in the eclipsed structure , </S>",
    "<S> the homo - lumo gap is small ( 0.09 ev ) , while for the hshe structure , it is 0.41 ev . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to interesting magnetic behavior in the three structures . </S>",
    "<S> the values of the gap and the mae of the three conformers are summarized in table [ table1 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> the lowest order spin hamiltonian for a single molecular magnet can be modelled as @xmath11 where d and e are the second - order axial and transverse anisotropies . @xmath12 and g are the applied magnetic field and the land g - factor , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the main contribution to the second - order anisotropy energy arises from the spin - orbit coupling . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the spin - orbit coupling and the second - order anisotropy energy was calculated here using the second - order pertubative treatment presented in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also used an alternative treatment given in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite where the principal axes and anisotropy energies may be determined by diagonalizing the anisotropy tensor . while the experimental staggered structure with s@xmath0 symmetry is uniaxial,(i.e . </S>",
    "<S> e=0 by symmetry ) the other two structures will have a transverse component ( e ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the calculated magnetic anisotropy energy of the uniaxial , optimized staggered structure was found to be 23 k although the initial structure , based on experimental parameters , showed a high value of mae of 57 k. the separation between pyridine rings was found to increase upon optimization which in turn increased the homo - lumo gap . </S>",
    "<S> the homo - lumo gap for the initial geometry of the experimental structure was found to be 0.09 ev . this observation opens up an exciting possibility of altering the mae by manipulating the pyridine - pyridine separations , in particular , by the application of pressure . </S>",
    "<S> it may be mentioned here that yang et al . @xcite </S>",
    "<S> have established that the magnetization barrier is @xmath13 100 - 200 k. the large discrepancy between the theoretical and experimental values further supports the possibility that the mae may exhibit significant pressure dependencies . </S>",
    "<S> so crystal packing effects may play an important role here .    </S>",
    "<S> the eclipsed structure , on the other hand , shows a more promising magnetic behavior ( table [ table1 ] ) . in this case , the magnetization has easy , medium and hard axes . </S>",
    "<S> the easy axis lies along the axis of the molecule as in the experimental structure . </S>",
    "<S> the energy barrier between the easy and the medium axes is 95k while that between the medium and hard axes is 65k . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a rather large d parameter of -3.55k and an e parameter of -0.91k . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the mae of the hshe structure ( 50k ) lies between the mae of the staggered and the eclipsed structures . </S>",
    "<S> however , this geometry has an easy plane of magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> thus , changing the orientation of the ligands significantly , albeit indirectly , influences the magnetic behavior of the co@xmath0 through band gap changes .    </S>",
    "<S> one possible way of achieving an overall easy axis is through the orthogonal hard axis alignment model in which each cobalt exhibits a local easy plane and the intersection of easy planes between the lower and upper co atoms determines an easy axis @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another way is for each atom to exhibit a local easy axis along the global uniaxis . </S>",
    "<S> within the second - order perturbation theory , and the lcao method used here , it is possible to decompose the anisotropy hamiltonian into a sum of 4-center terms by expanding the relevant matrix elements into their atomic constituents . </S>",
    "<S> because the co d states are localized and dominate the behavior near the fermi level , one expects that the single - center diagonal terms will be primarily responsible for the anisotropy energy . </S>",
    "<S> we have determined numerically that this is an excellent approximation and find that in all structures , the local alignments are identical with the local hard axis lying along the in - plane co - o bond in the cubane ( co and o are attached to two parallel hmp ligands ) and the local medium axis lying along the co - n bond ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ toc ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to the situation where the local hard and easy axes lie on a plane bisecting the molecule . for the case of the staggered structure , </S>",
    "<S> the local hard axes of the upper and lower co atoms are orthogonal , which leads to the global easy axis lying along the axis of the molecule . in the other two structures , </S>",
    "<S> the local hard axes are aligned parallel and the competition between the medium and the local easy axes leads to a triaxial alignment in one and to an easy plane of alignment in the other . for the latter , </S>",
    "<S> the easy and the medium axes are nearly degenerate .    in conclusion , we show that the magnetization of the co@xmath0 molecule varies strongly with the orientation of the various ligands . </S>",
    "<S> while the staggered and eclipsed structures have a preferred axis of magnetization , the intermediate structure has a preferred plane of magnetization . for the higher energy isomer , </S>",
    "<S> the energy barrier between the hard and the medium axis is quite high ( @xmath13 95k ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is especially interesting in view of the small number of transition metal atoms in the molecule . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that the anisotropy energy may be strongly varied by manipulating the pyridine - pyridine spacing and ligand orientation . </S>",
    "<S> determining a means for constraining the ligands by either chemical , physical or electrostatic means would be a worthwhile investigation . </S>"
