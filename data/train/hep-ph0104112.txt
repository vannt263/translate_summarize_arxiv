    "<S> april 2001 +    one fundamental problem in particle physics is to understand the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) that leads to the pattern of vector boson and fermion masses in the standard model ( sm ) . </S>",

    "<S> are quadratically sensitive to the cutoff ( which jeopardizes the consistency of the theory ) , while in its minimal supersymmetric extension ( mmsm ) , the sensitivity is only logarithmic .    </S>",
    "<S> it is a common belief that in supersymmetric theories with one extra dimension radiative corrections to scalar masses are not sensitive ( at least at one - loop ) to the ultraviolet ( uv ) cutoff of the theory  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a similar result holds in ( four - dimensional ) theories at finite temperature , where the size of the extra dimension is given by the inverse temperature . </S>",
    "<S> present calculations have been performed summing over all kaluza - klein ( kk)-modes . this is known as kk - regularization and ignores that a five dimensional ( 5d ) theory must be seen as an effective theory below the cutoff ( @xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this fact has recently been accounted by imposing the sharp cutoff @xmath2 on the momentum integration and truncating the summation in the kk - tower  @xcite to modes with @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to quadratic divergences because the sharp truncation of the kk - modes spoils the tower structure of the 5d theory .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we analyze a regularization where kk - modes are not truncated , but instead the brane is extended over the extra dimension with a finite length @xmath8 by a gaussian distribution . </S>",
    "<S> this regularization is suggested from string theories  @xcite . in particular we will study the uv sensitivity of the higgs mass in the prototype model presented in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , although the results are much more general and should also apply to other mass calculations and models . </S>",
    "<S> the model is based on a 5d @xmath9 theory whose massless modes constitute the usual four dimensional ( 4d ) @xmath9 mssm . </S>",
    "<S> supersymmetry breaking is a bulk phenomenon induced by scherk - schwarz ( ss ) boundary conditions  @xcite and radiative breaking is triggered by the presence of a bulk top / stop hypermultiplet .    </S>",
    "<S> the setup of the model is as follows . </S>",
    "<S> the 5d space - time is compactified on @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the orbifold @xmath11 has two fixed points at @xmath12 where the two 3-branes are located ( @xmath13 is the length of the segment ) . </S>",
    "<S> there are two types of fields : those living in the bulk of the extra dimensions , similar to the untwisted states in the heterotic string language ( @xmath14-states ) , and those living on the branes localized at the fixed points , similar to the heterotic string twisted states ( @xmath15-states ) . </S>",
    "<S> we will assume that gauge fields are @xmath14-states organized in @xmath16 gauge multiplets @xmath17 . even and odd components under @xmath18 are separated by a semicolon , as @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> notice that only the even fields have zero modes . </S>",
    "<S> matter fields can either be @xmath14- or @xmath15-states . in order to have yukawa interactions to generate ( after ewsb ) fermion masses only two possibilities for the localized superpotential </S>",
    "<S> are allowed  @xcite : they are of the form @xmath20 or @xmath21 . we will deal only with the latter   was recently studied in refs .  </S>",

    "<S> both , even and odd components , form independent chiral multiplets .    </S>",

    "<S> we will regularize the interactions with localized states by assuming that the brane has a finite extension of length @xmath38 along the fifth dimension with a gaussian distribution @xmath39 the rapid fall - off of the gaussian will produce an exponential suppression of the coupling of kk - modes with masses @xmath40 which leads to an effective cutoff of these modes without spoiling the tower structure of the 5d theory . </S>",

    "<S> we can now calculate the contribution at one - loop to the higgs mass as @xcite : @xmath59 where @xmath60 @xmath61 being the number of colours .    using the schwinger representation for the propagators and performing the @xmath62 integration over @xmath63 one </S>",

    "<S> the integral over @xmath67 can then be performed and yields @xmath68 e^{-\\frac{(n+\\omega)^2\\pi^2}{(\\ell\\lambda_s)^2}}. \\label{twoterms}\\ ] ] this contribution to the higgs mass contains a quadratically divergent term . however , this quadratic divergence is canceled by supersymmetry . in fact , using the poisson resummation formula @xmath69 which , for the case of the gaussian simply gives @xmath70 we find for the first term of ( [ twoterms ] ) @xmath71 the corresponding contribution to @xmath72 can then be written ( after including supersymmetric terms ) as @xmath73 whose @xmath35 term cancels from supersymmetry and whose leading contribution in the limit @xmath74 is provided by the @xmath75 mode . </S>",
    "<S> this one behaves like @xmath76 and clearly vanishes when @xmath74 .    </S>",
    "<S> if we neglect the contribution ( [ two ] ) we can write @xmath72 as : @xmath77 using again the poisson resummation formula we can cast this expression into the form @xmath78 where the function @xmath79 is the fourier transform of @xmath80.\\ ] ] the dependence of @xmath79 for large fourier modes @xmath62 is obtained from the behaviour of the function @xmath81 at the non - analytic point @xmath27 . </S>",

    "<S> , the convergence of @xmath85 to @xmath88 is very fast , as can be seen from fig .  </S>",

    "<S> even if the gaussian distribution ( [ gaussian ] ) we have assumed for the localization of the brane along the extra dimension is a physical one , and strongly motivated by string theories , we would like to comment about the generality of our results with respect to the distribution choice . since the aim of a general distribution @xmath91 is to regularize the @xmath44-function , </S>",
    "<S> a clear requirement the function @xmath91 must satisfy is that @xmath92 . </S>",
    "<S> a simple example satisfying that requirement is provided by the distribution @xmath93 its fourier transform over the orbifold length , @xmath94 , defines the @xmath3-dependent couplings in ( [ l4 ] ) as @xmath95 which again provides an exponential decoupling of heavy modes . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , for @xmath96 the function @xmath97 behaves as @xmath98 while , unlike @xmath99 , it is analytic at @xmath100 .    carrying out similar steps as in the gaussian case leads to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ analytic ] ) with different subleading , @xmath101 , corrections . </S>",
    "<S> we have found that analyticity of @xmath97 is an essential ingredient for the uv insensitivity of the higgs mass in a supersymmetric theory . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , any distribution with well defined moments , and satisfying the property that @xmath102 , should lead to a suppressed uv sensitivity for the one - loop higgs mass . we have checked this point by explicit calculations .    to conclude , we have proven that in the case of a gaussian distribution the sensitivity on the cutoff of the higgs mass is suppressed at one loop and no quadratic divergences appear in a supersymmetric theory . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore fully justified to exchange the ( infinite ) summation and the ( infinite ) integral as done in the kk - regularization . </S>",
    "<S> notice also that a similar calculation can be done for the gauge interactions , and its contributions to the higgs mass , leading to a mode dependent gauge coupling @xmath103 and a finite correction . </S>",
    "<S> moreover radiative corrections to the mass of other massless scalars ( squarks , sleptons ) localized on the brane also lead to finite results . </S>",
    "<S> we have also shown that the same conclusions hold for any well - defined distribution of the brane along the extra dimension .    </S>",
    "<S> let us finally notice that this result is also supported by explicit string calculations  @xcite , where the squared higgs mass is obtained to be @xmath104 ( the string scale , @xmath105 , playing the role of the uv cutoff @xmath2 ) in the region @xmath106 ( stringy region ) , and @xmath107 in the region @xmath108 ( field theory limit ) and given by the expression ( [ analytic ] ) , in agreement with our present results . </S>"
