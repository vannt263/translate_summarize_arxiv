    "using so - called cross - diffusion terms in mathematical models in natural sciences , in particular in biology , is nowadays a routine trick to incorporate into classical models additional effects such as taxis movement , crowding , pursuit , or evasion ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "two particular examples , which received especial attention amongst other models , are the keller ",
    "segel model of chemotactic movement @xcite ( _ taxis _ is defined as behavioral response to a directional stimulus ) , and the lotka  volterra type cross - diffusion model to describe predator pursuit of an evading prey @xcite .",
    "a distinct feature of many studies on cross - diffusion models ( pde systems where diffusion matrix is not diagonal ) is that usually a particular model is analyzed , where terms of reaction and diffusion coefficients are given in fixed explicit form ; notable exceptions are given by @xcite .",
    "it also appears that almost all the models considered contain reaction terms , only one exception we know of notwithstanding @xcite , although it might be argued that systems without reaction terms possess numerous solutions which may be relevant in biological modeling .",
    "taking a step further , in this note we consider the systems that lack the self - diffusion terms ; pde systems we analyze possess only cross - diffusion ( as , e.g. , in @xcite , but with nonlinear cross - diffusion coefficients ) .",
    "we dub such systems without reaction and self - diffusion terms _ pure cross - diffusion systems_. in particular , we study the pde system in the following form : @xmath0 where @xmath1 @xmath2",
    "are real constants , and @xmath3 are arbitrary functions whose properties will be specified later .",
    "qualitatively system describes mutually dependent movement of conserved entities @xmath4 and @xmath5 on gradients of their respective counterparts . of particular interest for us are the _ traveling wave solutions _ of system , which , e.g. , can describe a replacement process of one species by another species . as usual , a wave solution of is a bounded solution having the form @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the wave speed .",
    "on substituting these traveling wave forms into we obtain the ode wave system @xmath8 note that we can integrate system , and therefore , is essentially two dimensional , as the original pde system .",
    "each wave solution of has its counterpart as a bounded orbit of , which , due to the particular structure of , is an orbit on a phase plane .",
    "there is a known correspondence between wave solutions of and bounded orbits of : _ a wave front _ in , e.g. , @xmath4 component corresponds to a heteroclinic orbit of that connects singular points with different @xmath4 coordinates ; _ a wave impulse _ in , e.g. , @xmath4 component corresponds to a heteroclinic orbit of that connects singular points with identical @xmath4 coordinates or to a homoclinic curve of a singular point ; _ a wave train _ corresponds to a closed orbit of system .    in the next section",
    "we show that , under some natural restrictions on functions @xmath9 and @xmath10 , all possible traveling wave solutions of can be classified .",
    "in particular , a family of wave trains of is a generic phenomenon intrinsic to .",
    "section 3 provides some examples and extensions .",
    "section 4 is devoted to discussion and conclusions .",
    "in this note we confine ourselves to a particular case of , whereby the functions @xmath9 and @xmath10 can be represented as products of functions that depend on one variable : @xmath11 here the functions @xmath12 are smooth or rational .",
    "the models of the form for which holds will be termed _ separable pure cross diffusion models _ , or _",
    "separable models _ for short .    the rationale behind the choice of the from of the functions @xmath13 and @xmath14 as in is twofold .",
    "firstly , such assumption allows complete analysis of possible structures of the corresponding wave system , and thus , exhaustive classification of possible wave solutions of as was done for different models in @xcite .",
    "secondly , such forms are abundant in the modeling literature being the consequence of a biased random walk on the lattice ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    for the separable model and after integration and rearrangement wave system takes the form @xmath15 where @xmath16 are constants of integration that in general depend on boundary conditions , and which are considered here as new parameters of the system ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "after the change of independent variable @xmath17 which is well defined and smooth for any @xmath18 except where @xmath19 or where @xmath9 or @xmath10 are not defined ( see @xcite ) , we obtain @xmath20 in the case if @xmath9 or @xmath10 are rational , the change of independent variable is chosen such that the resulting wave system is well defined for all @xmath4 , @xmath5 ( for examples see the next section ) . therefore , without loss of generality , we assume that our wave system has the form @xmath21 which is defined for all @xmath22 .",
    "first we note that system is integrable .",
    "function @xmath23 represents its integral .",
    "we remark that under the assumption @xmath24 system is hamiltonian , and @xmath25 is its hamiltonian , which automatically yields that the singular points of can be only topological saddles or centers .",
    "we assume that the following conditions of non - degeneracy are fulfilled ( these conditions are natural as far as we consider @xmath26 the only parameters in the system ):",
    "@xmath27    system always has singular point @xmath28 .",
