    "the observations from type i supernovae indicate that our universe has a positive cosmological constant and is accelerating in its expansion @xcite-@xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is known that general theory of relativity has not tested at very large or very small scales , and it is possible for the general theory of relativity to be modified at such scales . however , as gravity has been thoroughly tested at the scale of solar system , it is important for any theory of modified gravity to reduce to the general theory of relativity at the scale of the solar system .",
    "it may be noted an interesting model of modified gravity is called the dgp brane model has been proposed to explain accelerating cosmic expansion @xcite .",
    "this model has two branches and one these branches admits a self - accelerating solution .",
    "however , this model contains ghost instabilities , and thus can not be used as a physical model for the cosmic acceleration @xcite .",
    "it may be noted that such instabilities also occur for other models of modified gravity @xcite .",
    "such instabilities occur due to the introduction of extra degrees of freedom into the theory because of the existence of higher derivative terms .    however , it is possible to construct an infrared modification of general theory of relativity @xcite .",
    "this theory contains a self - interaction term of the form @xmath0 , and so general relativity is recovered at high densities .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the minkowski background , this theory is invariant under the galileon shift symmetry , @xmath1 .",
    "this symmetry prevents the occurrence of higher derivative terms in the equation of motion of this theory .",
    "as this theory does not contain extra degrees of freedom , it can not also contain ghost instabilities .",
    "the coupling between a galileon scalar field and massive gravity through composite metrics has also been studied @xcite.a full set of equations of motion for a flat friedmann - robertson - walker background were obtained in this theory .",
    "the cosmology has also been studied using galileon gravity , and this has been done by analyzing the linear perturbation in galileon gravity @xcite .",
    "furthermore , low density stars with slow rotation and static relativistic stars have also been analyzed using galileon gravity @xcite .",
    "it was observed that the the scalar field solution ceases to exist above a critical density , and this corresponds to the maximum mass of a neutron star .",
    "the spherical collapse has also been analyzed in the galileon gravity @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this was done by analyzing the solutions to the einstein equations in galileon gravity . then these solution were used for discussing the conditions for the formation of a black hole or a naked singularity in galileon gravity . in this paper",
    ", we shall perform such an analysis in a theory which combines galileon gravity with gravity s rainbow .    another interesting modification to general relativity",
    "is called the horava - lifshitz gravity @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this theory of gravity is obtained from a uv completion of general relativity , such that general relativity is recovered in the ir limit @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this is done by taking different lifshitz scaling for space and time .",
    "such a different lifshitz scaling for space and time has also been taken in type iia string theory @xcite , type iib string theory @xcite , ads / cft correspondence @xcite-@xcite , dilaton black branes @xcite-@xcite , and dilaton black holes @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the horava - lifshitz gravity is based on the modification of the usual usual energy - momentum dispersion relation in the uv limit such that it reduces to the usual energy - momentum dispersion relation in the ir limit .",
    "the gravity s rainbow is another modification of gravity based on such a modified energy - momentum dispersion relation in the uv limit @xcite-@xcite . in gravity",
    "s rainbow the metric depends on the energy of the test particle used to probe the structure of the spacetime .",
    "the gravity s rainbow can be related to the horava - lifshitz gravity , for a specific choice of rainbow functions @xcite .",
    "there is a strong motivation to study such theories based on the energy - momentum dispersion relation in the uv limit .",
    "this is because the lorentz symmetry fixes the form of the energy - momentum relations , and there are strong theoretical indications from various different approaches to quantum gravity that lorentz symmetry might only be a symmetry of the low energy effective field theory , and so it will break in the uv limit @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this is expected to occur in discrete spacetime @xcite , models based on string field theory @xcite , spacetime foam @xcite , the spin - network in loop quantum gravity ( lqg)@xcite , and non - commutative geometry @xcite .",
    "it may be noted that such a deformation of the standard energy - momentum dispersion relation in the uv limit of the theory leads the existence of a maximum energy scale .",
    "the doubly special relativity is build on the existence of such a maximum energy scale @xcite , and gravity s rainbow is the generalization of doubly special relativity to curved spacetime @xcite . in gravity s rainbow ,",
    "the metric describing the geometry of spacetime depend on the energy of the test particle used to probe the structure of that spacetime .",
    "so , the geometry of spacetime is represented by a family of energy dependent metrics forming a rainbow of metrics . in gravity s rainbow ,",
    "the energy - momentum dispersion relation is modified by energy dependent rainbow functions , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , such that @xmath4 as it is required that the usual energy - momentum dispersion relation is recovered in the ir limit , these rainbow functions are required to satisfy @xmath5 the energy dependent metric in gravity s rainbow can be written as @xmath6 the rainbow functions are defined using the energy @xmath7 , which is the energy at which the spacetime is probed , and this energy can not exceed the planck energy @xmath8 .",
    "vaidya spacetime is a a non - stationary schwarzschild spacetime @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the gravitational collapse in vaidya spacetime has been studied in galileon gravity @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will analyze the gravitational collapse in vaidya spacetime in galileon gravity deformed by rainbow functions .",
    "the gravitational collapse has also been studied in gravity s rainbow @xcite-@xcite .",
    "in fact , the thermodynamics of black holes has also been discussed in gravity s rainbow @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this has been done by deforming the black hole metric by rainbow functions .",
    "the energy @xmath7 used to define the rainbow functions can be identified with the energy of quantum particle in the vicinity of the event horizon , which could be emitted in the hawking radiation .",
    "it is possible to obtain a bound on this energy @xmath9 , using the uncertainty principle @xmath10 . here",
    "the uncertainty in position of a particle in the vicinity of the event horizon can be equated with the radius of the event horizon radius @xmath11 the existence of this bound on the energy modifies the temperature of the black hole in gravity s rainbow .",
    "this modified temperature of the black hole has been used for calculate the corrected entropy of a black hole in gravity s rainbow .",
    "this deformation of the black hole thermodynamics lead to the formation of black remnants , and these black remnants can have important phenomenological implication for the detection of mini black holes at the lhc @xcite .",
    "it may be noted that this energy which is used in constructing rainbow functions dynamically dependent on the coordinate @xcite . even though we do not need this explicit dependence of this energy on the coordinate , but it is important to note that the rainbow functions are dynamical , and so they can not be gauged away .",
    "the galileon theory is invariant under the galileon shift symmetry . now",
    "if @xmath12   is the matter lagrangian and @xmath13 is the galileon field , then the action for such a theory can be written as @xcite-@xcite , @xmath14,\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the galileon parameter , and the coupling @xmath16 has dimension of length .",
    "furthermore , we also have @xmath17 , and @xmath18 . now for a spherically symmetric spacetime , we can write @xcite , @xmath19 here the radial coordinate is denoted by @xmath20 and the null coordinate is denoted by @xmath21 . the gravitational mass inside the sphere of radius @xmath20 is denoted by @xmath22 , and the line element on a unit @xmath23-sphere is denoted by @xmath24 .    the rainbow deformations the above metric can be written as @xmath25 the einstein s equations for this metric can be written as @xmath26\\ ] ] @xmath27\\nabla^{\\lambda}\\phi-\\nabla_{\\mu}[f(\\phi)\\left(\\nabla \\phi\\right)^{2}]\\nabla_{\\nu}\\phi+f(\\phi)\\nabla_{\\mu}\\phi\\nabla_{\\nu}\\phi~^{\\fbox{}}~\\phi\\right\\}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the energy momentum tensor .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor for the vaidya null radiation is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the energy density corresponding to vaidya null radiation .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor for a perfect fluid is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the energy density and pressure for the perfect fluid .",
    "now we can write @xcite @xmath34 it may be noted that @xmath35 and @xmath36 are linearly independent future pointing null vectors , @xmath37 furthermore , they satisfy @xmath38      so , the deformed metric ( [ rainbow ] ) can be expressed as @xmath78dt^{2 } \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{f(e)g(e)}dtdr+\\frac{1}{g(e)^2}r^{2}d\\omega_{2}^{2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is the rainbow deformed generalized vaidya metric in galileon gravity . it may be noted that this solution represents a special class of solution of the general model .",
    "this is because the general solution was very complicated , and so we made this assumption to simplify our analysis .",
    "in the previous section , we analyzed the rainbow deformation of the vaidya metric in galileon gravity . in this section",
    ", we will analyze the gravitational collapse in this theory .",
    "we can let @xmath79 in eq .",
    "( [ rainbow ] ) , and obtain the equation for outgoing radial null geodesics .",
    "it may be noted that @xmath80 , and @xmath81 thus , the central singularity exists at the point @xmath82 .",
    "now we can study the behavior of the function @xmath83 as it approaches this singularity at @xmath82 along the radial null geodesic .",
    "let us denote this limiting value by @xmath84 , and so we can write @xmath85 now from eqs .",

    "thus , a black hole will be formed when none of the solutions of this equation are positive .",
    "it is difficult to find analytic solutions for @xmath84 , and so we will find numerical solutions for @xmath84",
    ". this will be done by assigning specific numerical values to the constants associated with this model .",
    "we will also need to use a specific form of the rainbow function for performing this numerical analysis .",
    "thus , we will use the rainbow functions motivated from loop quantum gravity approach and @xmath93-minkowski non - commutative spacetime @xcite , @xmath94 in the above expressions , @xmath95 is the planck energy and it is given by @xmath96 gev .",
    "the behavior of the roots of this equation can be obtained from contour plots of @xmath84 vs @xmath61 , for fixed values of other parameters .",
    "thus , we will be able to understand the behavior of the collapse at different cosmological eras .",
