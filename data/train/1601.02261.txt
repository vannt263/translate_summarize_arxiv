    "this way , the energies of the tip and the sample will represent functions of distance and the performance of the interaction energy curve will depend on the strength of the tip - sample interaction : the stronger interaction ( the more significant modification the tip and the sample undergo ) yields stronger modification of the qualitative performance of the interaction energy curve relative the performance of the total energy of the interacting assembly versus the tip - sample distance .    in this work we employed the second approach ,",
    "i.e. after initial relaxation of the tip - sample geometry , the structures of the isolated tip and sample for each fixed tip - sample distance were frozen when calculating the interaction energy .",
    "our choice has the following reasoning . at the distance ranges of our interest",
    "the interaction between the w - tip and sample is rather strong , meaning that the structures of the w - cluster as well as graphene will be significantly modified compared to the isolated cases . in order to simulate experimental conditions we need to consider the interaction between already modified tip and sample .",
    "the latter is possible with the chosen approach . if the structures of isolated tip and sample are fully relaxed ( i.e. the first approach is employed ) , then the interaction between unmodified sub - systems is investigated .",

    "( ii ) the first minima of this curve gives the reaction of the elastic graphene nanobubbles on the intending tip and if tip was not moved further towards to the substrate then it would describe the adsorption of the metallic cluster at the atop position .",
    "therefore , the linear fit of the repulsive part of this curve , in the first approximation , can give the stiffness of graphene at the atop position .",
    "such fit yields the stiffness obtained from the experimental data : @xmath71n / m .",

    "<S> formation of the ordered commensurate moir structures of graphene on different substrates leads to the cloning of dirac cones in the reciprocal space that in its turn modifies the electronic spectrum of carriers via opening of mini - gaps around the dirac point , deviates the energy band dispersion from the linear one , changes the effective mass and velocity of the carriers , etc .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> all these effects are a manifestation of the additional large - scale modulation potential originating from the moir superlattice , which usually has a size of several nanometers .    </S>",
    "<S> the existence of moir structures on the basis of graphene is known for many years and they were successfully imaged by means of scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) for graphene on common graphite  @xcite and graphene on si- or c - faced sic  @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> graphene moir structures appear naturally during preparation of these systems for experiment due to the weak interaction between single graphene layers . </S>",
    "<S> the periodicities as well as corrugations of such graphene moir structures are defined by the misalignment angle between two carbon lattices in the neighboring graphene layers . </S>",
    "<S> the recent experiments on the transport properties of the ultraflat graphene in the artificial graphene / h - bn heterostructures reveal the modified mass - less electronic spectrum of graphene . </S>",
    "<S> the appearance of the moir - lattice related dirac points in the electronic structure of graphene is manifested as local dips in the stm spectroscopy data  @xcite ( @xmath1 signal is proportional to the local density of states ) and via observation of the so - called hofstadter butterfly `` self - similar '' superlattice energy spectrum  @xcite for the charge particle moving under simultaneous influence of two periodic potentials , atomic - lattice- and moir - lattice - related , and magnetic field .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the moir lattices classes is a graphene layer on the close - packed surfaces of @xmath2 and @xmath3 transition metals , like ir(111 ) , pt(111 ) , or ru(0001 ) . </S>",
    "<S> such graphene - metal systems are the subject of the long - term surface science studies and they were proposed as substrates for the ordered arrays of metallic clusters , which then can be used in storage technology or in catalysis as the behaviour of a clusters array could be modelled on the basis of a single element . </S>",
    "<S> the electronic or magnetic properties of such cluster arrays strongly depend on the underlying graphene - metal substrate . </S>",
    "<S> the crystallographic structure of these graphene - metal systems , and hence their electronic properties , are defined by the lattice mismatch of graphene and metal surface as well as by the strength of the local interaction at the interface , leading to the observation of various moir structures with different corrugations even for the same graphene - metal combinations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus the precise knowledge of the crystallographic structure of the graphene - metal system is crucial for the modelling of its electronic properties . </S>",
    "<S> macroscopic diffraction experiments , like low - energy electron diffraction ( leed ) , or local probe methods , like stm and atomic force microscopy ( afm ) , can give information about symmetry of the system and lattice alignment of graphene and metal  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the graphene moir lattice corrugation on metal is extracted from the comparison of experimental and theoretical data , e.g. from the modelled stm images at different bias voltages  @xcite or from simulated @xmath4 curves in leed experiments  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> afm in principle can do this job , but as was shown , the correct topography in this case is influenced by the residual electrostatic forces between tip and sample  @xcite . in such afm experiments , </S>",
    "<S> the compensation of the local contact potential difference variation over the moir lattice is not a trivial task . </S>",
    "<S> also , because graphene is very elastic material , the imaged topography in afm experiments can be influenced by the indentation effect from the tip , which is placed in the close vicinity to the surface  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the necessity of the tool , which gives full information about graphene moir , is obvious and our approach is based on the complementary stm and afm spectroscopy measurements in this case .    </S>",
    "<S> let us consider a graphene layer on ru(0001 ) as the most representative case of the strongly corrugated graphene - metal system with the alternating places of the different stacking of graphene on metal substrate . here </S>",
    "<S> high - symmetry places of the moir structure are called with respect to the adsorption places of ru(0001 ) which are centres of the carbon rings : atop , fcc , and hcp ( see inset of fig.1a ) . </S>",
    "<S> such different local atom stackings of carbon and metal atoms lead to the modulation of the interaction strength at the interface yielding the formation of a strongly corrugated graphene layer on ru(0001 ) with the height difference between two limit positions of @xmath5pm as deduced from our dft calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the natural approach to use stm or afm to measure true corrugation does not work here as the variation of the local density of states leads to the strong dependence of the apparent corrugation on the bias voltage between tip and sample  @xcite or graphene nanodoms can be modified via the local chemical interaction with the apex of the tip  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> if scanning metallic tip is placed above one of the high - symmetry positions of the graphene moir structure then one can expect that the interaction energy between tip and graphene will be described by morse or lenard - jones ( lj ) potential ( see fig.s1 and the respective text in the supplementary material for the discussion ) . </S>",
    "<S> both of them consist of the attractive and repulsive parts , which are more effective on long and short distances between objects , respectively . </S>",

    "<S> distance @xmath6 denotes the interval between middle w layer of the model tip and middle ru layer in the graphene / ru(0001 ) slab . </S>",
    "<S> such computational experiments model the real afm force - spectroscopy measurements . for hcp or fcc places </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the expected curves for the tip - sample interaction energy ( top panel of fig.1a ) , which have a shape very close to the one for morse or lj potential . </S>",
    "<S> the minimum value for the interaction energy is @xmath7aj at @xmath8 nm .    </S>",

    "<S> this effect is explained by the drum - like behavior of the atop places of graphene moir on ru(0001 ) . </S>",
    "<S> if tip is approaching the graphene bubble at the atop position , first it interacts with a graphene layer and this interaction can be described by morse or lj potential and can be assigned to the formation of the w - c bond at the short distance between apex of the tip and graphene layer ( fig.1b , panels 1 - 4 ) . however it is possible to press with the tip on a graphene layer further until the strong repulsive interaction between graphene and the underlying ru prevent further graphene flexure . </S>",
    "<S> this complex behaviour leads to the appearance of the global minimum on the curve for the interaction energy between tip and graphene at the atop position and leads to the formation of several w - c bonds between tip and graphene ( fig.1b , panels 4 - 6 ) . </S>",

    "<S> we prepared graphene on ru(0001 ) in the usual fashion via decomposition of the ethene gas at @xmath15k . </S>",

    "<S> interaction between tip and surface leads to the slight change of the resonance frequency and this frequency shift @xmath17 signal is measured , which is later transformed in the component of the force parallel to oscillations , @xmath18 , and interaction energy , @xmath19 , between tip and graphene  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such measurements can be performed on the @xmath20-grid on the sample surface producing the 3d data sets , @xmath21 , that allows the careful analysis of the data ( see fig.s5 and movies2 of the supplementary material ) . </S>",
    "<S> figure 2a ( top panel ) shows representative @xmath17 curves extracted from such data sets for the middle positions of the respective high - symmetry places . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding forces acting on the tip and the respective tip - graphene interaction energy curves at different places of the moir structure are presented in the middle and the bottom panels , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> all sets show a clear depression on the attractive part of the curves for the atop positions </S>",
    "<S> . we can indicate the extremely good agreement between experimental and theoretical curves for @xmath18 and @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> simultaneously with the signal , we also perform measurements of the so - called dissipation signal , @xmath22 , which indicates the energy need in order to keep the oscillation amplitude constant ( fig.2b ; see also fig.s5 and movies3 of the supplementary material ) . </S>",
    "<S> several dissipative mechanisms might be responsible for this effect , but here , the most relevant one is the excitation of the movement of the graphene sheet due to the attractive interaction between graphene and oscillating tip . </S>",
    "<S> one can clearly recognise two bumps on the curve for the dissipative channel for the atop places , each of them is connected with the respective minima in the curve for the interaction force . </S>",
    "<S> the difference in the value for the dissipation energy between atop and hcp / fcc places is due to the weaker interaction between graphene and ru for the atop place compared to hcp / fcc , that causes the smaller energy loss for keeping oscillation amplitude constant .    </S>",
    "<S> comparison of the obtained experimental results with the previously discussed dft data shows very good agreement between theory and experiment ( keeping in mind the complexity and size of the studied system consisting of 1140 atoms in the dft simulations ) . analysing the @xmath17 signal we can take the difference between the positions of the first minima in the curve for the atop place and of the minima for the hcp place as a corrugation of the graphene on ru(0001 ) that yields a value of @xmath23pm , which coincides with @xmath5pm obtained in dft calculations .    </S>",
    "<S> analysis of the force curves shows that subtraction of the long - range tail ( originating from the macro - tip ) from the curve for the atop place gives for the first minima ( in the first approximation ) the reaction of the graphene nanobubble on the pressure from the tip side . </S>",
    "<S> linear fit of the initial retraction part of this curve gives a stiffness of the graphene layer of @xmath24n / m and finally the resonant frequency of approximately @xmath25thz ( see supplementary material for details ) . </S>",
    "<S> this value can be compared with the similar values of @xmath26n / m and @xmath27thz , for graphene stiffness and resonance frequency of graphene - bubbles , respectively , obtained from the theoretical data . of course </S>",
    "<S> , the validity of the elastic theory for the continuous media might be questionable on the nanoscale and further theoretical analysis is necessary . </S>",
    "<S> however , even this simplified approach gives very good agreement between experimental and theoretical data .    </S>",
    "<S> the reproducibility of the observed effect is demonstrated in fig.2c ( see also figs.s5 and s6 , movies2 and movies3 of the supplementary material ) , where several maps for the @xmath17 and @xmath22 channels measured in the constant height afm mode for the graphene moir lattice on ru(0001 ) are shown , i.e. for the array of graphene nanoresonators . the cuts presented in fig.s5 were extracted from the 3d sets of data , which were collected on the @xmath20-grid as discussed earlier . </S>",
    "<S> one can clearly see that all graphene nanobubbles in atop places show the same nanodrum behaviour with the same elastic properties . </S>",
    "<S> the similar effect was also observed in the pure constant height data for the @xmath17 and @xmath22 channels as shown in fig.2c and fig.s6 of the supplementary material . as was demonstrated  @xcite such assembly of graphene nanoresonators </S>",
