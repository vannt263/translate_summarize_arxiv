    "since the original theoretical proposals@xcite of the existence of topological insulators ( tis ) and their eventual realization in hgte / cdte and inas / gasb quantum wells ( qws),@xcite extensive studies of their properties have been performed .",
    "because of the topological non - triviality of topological insulators , it was expected that the dissipationless current carried by topologically protected edge states could be utilized to construct electronic devices with low power consumption .",
    "experimentally , however , the edge states that were expected to be robust were found to become unstable when the sample of hgte / cdte quantum wells became somewhat larger and reached sizes of a few microns .",
    "this experimental finding stirred up a lot of interest .",
    "how disorder , magnetic impurity , electron - electron interaction , electron - phonon interaction , etc , and the various combinations of these effects , could affect transport in edge states as well as the topological properties of tis themselves have been intensively studied.@xcite    the notion that topological superconductors ( tss ) , similar to tis , possess topologically protected gapless edge or surface states traversing through the superconductor gap , was also put forward .",
    "it is anticipated@xcite that superconducting vortices in two dimensional chiral @xmath0-wave tss can bind majorana fermions ( mfs ) , which persist at zero energy and obey non - abelian braiding statistics .",
    "this implies that adiabatically exchanging two majorana fermions noncommutatively transforms the system from one ground state to another .",
    "due to the protection of the non - abelian braiding properties a quantum bit encoded in mfs is immune to external environmental noise .",
    "this gives mfs considerable promise in topological quantum computing .",
    "motivated by this idea , a great deal of effort has been expended to examine many materials and structures to find ways to produce mfs .    because mfs can appear when @xmath1 wave superconductors are put in close proximity to tis , great attention has recently been focused on this kind of superconducting hybrid system.@xcite one phenomenon that also appears in superconducting hybrid systems is andreev reflection ( ar ) , which is an important transport process found about fifty years ago.@xcite ar occurs near the interface of a conductor and a superconductor : an electron incident from the metallic side is reflected as a hole while a cooper pair is created in the superconductor .",
    "recently , it has been reported theoretically that ar in ti - superconductor ( ti - s ) hybrid junctions should manifest quantized characteristics due to topologically protected helical edge states@xcite and thus may be used as a powerful method to probe helical edge modes in ti system.@xcite more intriguingly , it is anticipated that the promising existence of mfs in josephson junctions with a superconductor - ti - superconductor ( s - ti - s ) structure will make the josephson supercurrent oscillate with a period of @xmath2-twice that of conventional junctions.@xcite  theoretical proposals focus on correlated phase measurements to prove the existence of mfs in these hybrid systems .",
    "this means that the first crucial thing to do is to study the behavior of the helical edge or surface states in close proximity to a superconductor .    to date",
    ", many experimental groups have observed proximity - induced superconductivity in the surface or edge states of tis.@xcite in particular , proximity - induced superconductivity in the quantum spin hall edge of hgte / cdte qws has been reported , and clear superconducting quantum interference patterns due to the superconducting helical edge states of tis were obtained independently by two experimental groups.@xcite following the dynes - fulton analysis process , the supercurrent as a function of transverse position in a s - ti - s junction was obtained and found to be localized on two edges of the junction . however , one large puzzle remained in the discussion in ref .",
    "[ ] ; namely , that the supercurrent was localized on the two edges of the junction even though the system still had measurable resistance due to residual bulk states , which are supposed to spread widely in whole sample .",
    "the dynes - fulton approach was discussed in very recent theoretical work,@xcite where it was pointed out the space - distributed supercurrent obtained through the frourier transformation of the dynes - fulton process is not quantitatively accurate and sometimes deviates significantly from the correct value .",
    "therefore , it is very important to perform a direct numerical simulation on this s - ti - s hybrid junction and clearly verify the existence of proximity - induced superconductivity in the helical edge states of quantum spin hall systems , and also present reasonable explanations of the experimental results .",
    "that is the purpose of the present work .",

    "[ ] , where the sample width was @xmath122 and the residual resistance from bulk states was approximately @xmath123 . because the wave functions of these residual bulks states spread over the whole cross - section of the sample and thus are much weaker than those of two pairs of edge states which are always confined at the sample boundaries , to detect the contribution of finite residual bulk states to the supercurrent becomes very difficult experimentally .",

    "finally , it should be noted that in order to obtain interference patterns similar to those seen in the experiment,@xcite a relative large linewidth , @xmath124 , had to be used for every lattice site of the central ti sample .",
    "it is found that the interference pattern deviates significantly from that reported in the experiment@xcite if the linewidth @xmath79 is set to be small .",
    "the reason is twofold : ( 1 ) the finite width of the central sample adopted in our simulation leads to discrete energy levels , therefore a relative large linewidth @xmath125 is needed to smear discrete energy levels and makes them look like continuum energy spectrum ; ( 2 ) the experimental samples are somewhat disordered , which leads to broadening of states , however this supposition needs to be further confirmed experimentally . since residual bulk states and dephasing are two significant factors influencing the robustness of the edge states of tis , production of a clean , high quality ti sample is a long sought goal of this field . at present ,",
    "residual bulk states are still always observed , no matter whether in 2d ti samples or in 3d ones . how to tune the fermi energy completely away from the conduction / valence band edges into the band gap",

    "the fact that experiments have only observed induced superconductivity only in quantum spin hall edge states is just due to the effect of size : the magnitude of the wave functions from bulk states become very small when these residual bulk states spread over the relatively large cross section of the sample ( @xmath122 ) .    from the results of this work",
