    ", we explore the intrinsic mechanism for the quantum tunneling assisted by repulsive nonlinear mean - field interactions in a matter - wave interferometer .",

    "our numerical simulations , employing a time - dependent 1d mean - field gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation , show that multiple moving dark solitons are generated as a result of the nonlinearity - assisted quantum tunneling between the ground and excited nonlinear eigenstates of the system , and the qualitative mechanism is independent on the particular shape of the symmetric double - well potential .",
    "furthermore , the number of the generated dark solitons is found to be highly sensitive to the strength of the effective nonlinearity that in turn depends on the total number of condensed atoms and the atom - atom s - wave scattering length .",

    "for such a small value of @xmath18 , both the ground and first excited eigenstates of the initial double - well potential adiabatically evolve into the corresponding ground and first excited eigenstates of the final single - well potential .",
    "this means that the _ non - adiabatic effects are negligible _ for such a slowly varying process .",

    "below , we consider the case of the initial state of the bec being fully localised in a single well of a symmetric double - well potential with a sufficiently high barrier , so that there is _ no significant overlap _ between the wannier states of the two wells .",
    "the fully localised initial state can be viewed as the equal - probability superposition of the ground and first - excited eigenstates , so that it can be used to observe the interference of these two eigenstates @xcite .",
    "for becs trapped in such a deep potential , the mean - field ground and first excited states are degenerate or quasi - degenerate . even for low barriers ,",
    "if the tight - binding condition is still satisfied , the two - mode approximation will give the picture of a classical bose - josephson junction .",

    "then both the quasi - degeneracy between the ground and first excited states in the mean - field picture and the quasi - degeneracy between the highest excited and sub - highest excited states in the quantum picture break down .",
    "the quantum tunneling of the fully localised state becomes more pronounced as the barrier height is decreasing . due to the very slow reduction in the barrier height",
    ", the kinetic energy stays small during the whole process , and the quantum tunnelling dominates the dynamics .",

    ", the fully localised initial state can be viewed as an equal - probability superposition of the symmetric and antisymmetric states , so that , according to the adiabatic theorem , the evolving state is always the equal - probability superposition of the ground and the first excited states of the system . due to the nonlinear interactions , the superposition principle becomes invalid , and the resulting behavior can be interpreted as the coupled dynamics of the ground and multiple excited states of the nonlinear system .",
    "akin to the linear systems , the quantum tunneling appears once the quasi - degeneracy between the ground and the first excited state is broken , and gradually becomes significant with decreasing barrier height .",
    "the time scale on which the quantum tunneling appears in the nonlinear system shortens with the growth of nonlinear interaction strength @xmath32 .",
    "the excited nonlinear states of the bec in a single - well potential can be thought as stationary configurations of single or multiple dark solitons @xcite . as a result of the population transfer to such excited modes",
    ", the condensate develops multi - peak distribution with significant phase gradients across density notches between neighboring peaks .",
    "these notches are dark or gray solitons with well - defined phase gradients close to @xmath35 ( see fig .",
    "the number of dark solitons formed in this process varies with the effective nonlinearity @xmath32 ( see fig . 5 ) .",
    "this dependence exhibits multiple plateaus as the effective nonlinearity @xmath32 changes , as shown in fig .",
    "5 . given the relationship between the nonlinear interaction strength and the key parameters of the system , @xmath36 , one can control the number of generated solitons by adjusting the s - wave scattering length with the feshbach resonance , the total number of atoms in the condensate with initial preparation , and/or the transverse trapping frequency by tuning the transverse trapping field strength .",
    "the number of solitons remains unchanged for a long period of time before multiple collisions between solitons take place .",

    "there exist additional stationary states ( e.g. , self - trapped states ) which have no linear counterparts @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , every stationary state of the nonlinear system can be composed from the orthogonal basis @xmath42 .",
    "the nonlinear eigenstates of time - independent potentials are also time - independent . however , due to the violation of the superposition principle",
    ", population transfer between different nonlinear eigenstates also occurs in time - independent systems @xcite .",
    "this type of population transfer , which originates from the exchange collisions between atoms in different eigenstates , will be considered in detail below .",

    ", we observe a fast population transfer from the ground state to the first excited state .",
    "after the recombination of the two wells , i.e. for @xmath57 , the populations in different nonlinear eigenstates oscillate with time , even though the nonlinear system has a time - independent potential , time - independent eigenstates , and no energy degeneracy between neighbouring eigenstates .",
    "this behavior differs drastically from the linear dynamics where populations in different eigenstates always remain unchanged .",
    "we find that at this value of the effective nonlinearity the total population probability @xmath65 in the first four eigenstates is always close to one .",
    "the low - frequency population oscillations are dominated by the linear coupling between different modes and the high - frequency ones are due to the nonlinear cross - coupling of the nonlinear modes which corresponds to the exchange collision of atoms in different eigenstates .    for small @xmath32 ,",
    "the dynamics of @xmath66 after the merging of the two wells can be approximately captured by the projection of the bec state at the moment of the merging ( here @xmath58 ) onto the set of @xmath10 stationary nonlinear states @xmath67 of the single - well potential @xmath68 of @xmath69 .",

    "the number of eigenstates , @xmath10 , that must be considered in the coupled - mode theory , increases with the effective nonlinearity .",
    "the highest - order mode ( @xmath70 ) of the harmonic potential @xmath68 with significant ( non - zero ) excitation probability @xmath71 at the merging time will therefore determine the number @xmath10 of dark solitons that are likely to be formed .",
    "figure 6(c ) shows the excitation probabilities at @xmath58 for the first six lowest eigenstates of @xmath68 and different @xmath32 . by comparing the number of significantly excited states for different values of @xmath32",
    ", one can see that the number of dark solitons formed is indeed approximately determined by the highest - excited nonlinear mode of the harmonic trap that is still sufficiently populated .",

    "we have explored the nonlinearity - assisted quantum tunneling and formation of nonlinear collective excitations in the matter - wave interferometer based on a time - dependent double - well potential , dynamically reconfigured to form a single - well harmonic trap .",
    "in contrast to the josephson tunneling and landau - zener tunneling , the nonlinearity - assisted quantum tunneling is brought about by the nonlinear inter - mode population exchange scattering .",
