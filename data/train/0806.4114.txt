    "the @xcite and @xcite _ chandra _  surveys of the nuclear bulgerevealed a large population of weak , hard point - like x - ray sources  that could account for up to 10% of the previously observed `` diffuse '' x - ray emission from the nuclear bulge .",
    "numerous studies have tried to characterise these newly discovered x - ray sources  of the nuclear bulge  surveys based on their x - ray properties .",
    "@xcite suggest that a large fraction may be wind - accreting neutron stars with high mass companions . @xcite and",
    "@xcite propose that they could be white dwarfs accreting from main sequence counterparts ( cataclysmic variables , polars and intermediate polars ) . @xcite and",
    "@xcite believe them to be neutron stars with low mass companions and @xcite have speculated that they could be isolated neutron stars and black holes accreting from the interstellar medium .",
    "however , the weak nature of the sources means that positive identification of the majority of the sources is impossible based solely on the x - ray data .",
    "identification of the stellar counterparts to these x - ray sources  we will allow the differentiation between these possibilities .",
    "as shown in @xcite , to identify candidate counterparts to x - ray sources  in the nuclear bulge , very high resolutions imaging is required to avoid issues of confusion due to the high stellar density of the region .",
    "in addition to that , the extremely high , variable extinction towards the nuclear bulge requires these observations to be performed in the near - infrared  or longer wavelengths .",
    "previously , only the denis and 2mass  surveys had observed the nuclear bulge  entirely in the near - infrared , however as will be shown , their depth and resolution is insufficient for the purposes of identifying the counterparts to the majority of the nuclear bulgex - ray sources .",
    "the ( united kingdom infrared deep sky survey - galactic plane survey ) ukidss - gps is one of the five near infrared public legacy surveys that are being undertaken by the ukidss consortium , using the wide field camera on the united kingdom infrared telescope @xcite .",
    "surveying the northern galactic plane and the nuclear bulge  in @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 bands , integration times of 80s , 80s and 40s respectively achieve median 5-@xmath4 depths of @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( vega system ) for the most recent data release 2 ( dr2 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the resolution of the ukidss - gps observations are 0.2 , an order of magnitude better than the 2mass  survey , with a similar positional accuracy of @xmath8 .        in the nuclear bulge",
    ", the crowding of this extremely dense stellar region coupled with the high level of intervening extinction reduces the completion limit of the survey to @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 with detection limits of @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 . despite this",
    ", the @xmath15 region shown in figure [ f : nbimage ] contains @xmath16 point sources . as",
    "such it is the first survey covering the entire nuclear bulge  to have the resolution and depth to allow the identification of candidate counterparts to the majority of the nuclear bulge  x - ray sources .",
    "we used the topcat program to identify candidate counterparts to the x - ray sources .",
    "we used a larger @xmath17 positional error for the ukidss - gps nuclear bulge  source positions , than the stated accuracy of @xmath18 , to account for the confusion in the nuclear bulge caused by the very high stellar density .",
    "the `` out - of - the - box '' _ chandra_positional error is @xmath19 , though this can be considerably larger ( up to @xmath20 ) in some cases due to image distortion in the outer regions of the _ chandra _  array and/or to the very low s / n of the faintest sources detected . for the purpose of this study , we discarded all x - ray sources  for which the x - ray positional errors were greater than @xmath21 radius ; for error circles greater than this size , the number of candidate counterparts is sufficiently high ( 5 - 30 stars ) to render meaningless any attempt at astrometric matching between the near - infrared  and x - ray catalogs .",
    "we used the @xmath17 positional error for the ukidss - gps source positions , along with the derived positional errors from the @xcite and @xcite x - ray source  catalogues to set a maximum separation of @xmath22 between and x - ray source  and a star that can be considered a match .",
    "[ cols=\"^ , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     [ t : ncounterparts ]    of the 4256 x - ray sources  in the @xcite catalogues , 3963 x - ray sources  have positional errors of less than @xmath21 . from these , we found 3076 candidate counterparts to 1963 of the x - ray sources .",
    "there are 1368 x - ray sources  with only one candidate counterpart , 341 with two candidate counterparts , 151 with three and 103 with 4 or more candidate counterparts .",
    "table [ t : ncounterparts ] gives a breakdown of the numbers of counterparts for x - ray sources  with error circles of @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "as can be seen , for x - ray sources  with positional errors of @xmath26 , the majority of these have only one candidate counterpart , whereas those with @xmath24 errors have a slightly larger proportion with 2 candidate counterparts . as might be expected , it is the sources with the larger error circles , @xmath25 , which have a much larger proportion with multiple candidate counterparts .",
    "figure [ f : xrscolmag ] shows colour magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of the candidate counterparts compared to a representative sample of nuclear bulge stars from the ukidss - gps dr2  catalogue . from the diagrams it can be seen that the x - ray sources  follow the general trend of the overall stellar distribution but with some differences to their specific distribution .",
    "for instance , the cmds containing @xmath1-band data reveal a high proportion of the candidate counterparts to be in the local , main - sequence arm of the cmds .",
    "the majority of the remaining candidate counterparts in all three cmds are consistent with red giants at a galactic centre distance with variable levels of extinction ( see poster contribution by gosling et al . for details of the nuclear bulgeextinction ) .",
    "figure [ f : xrscolmag ] also demonstrates the increase in candidate counterparts that occurs when sources with photometry in the @xmath2 and @xmath3-band is compared to those for which there is photometry in all 3 or @xmath1 and @xmath2-bands .",
    "there is a large amount of extinction towards the nuclear bulge  ( see additional poster contribution of gosling et al . for further details ) , this extinction has a greater effect on shorter wavelengths and so is most likely to obscure a source in the @xmath1 band .",
    "this is also apparent in the increase in sources being predominately those with large values of @xmath27 indicating high levels of extinction .",
    "identifying the candidate counterparts to the nuclear bulge  x - ray sources  is only the first step in understanding this population . to better understand them",
    ", it will be necessary to identify the true companion to each of the x - ray sources  where possible . in order to do this ,",
    "we intend to search for accretion signatures in the candidate counterparts .",
    "we are undertaking a narrow - band brackett-@xmath28 ( br-@xmath28 , a known accretion signature ) imaging survey of the nuclear bulge  to identify sources with br-@xmath28excess , and will also follow - up the candidate counterparts with near - infraredmulti - object spectroscopy using the flamingos-2 instrument soon to be commissioned on gemini south .",
    "we will also compare our catalogue of candidate counterparts to the _ spitzer _  catalogue of point sources of @xcite to increase our wavelength coverage of these sources and to identify those with spectra indicating that they are likely to be in accreting or x - ray emitting systems .",
    "we have presented an initial matching of the source positions of the _ chandra _  nuclear bulge  surveys of @xcite and @xcite to the new ukidss - gps near - infrared  survey of the nuclear bulge . in doing so ,",
    "we have identified candidate counterparts to @xmath29 of the x - ray sources  in this extremely crowded and heavily extincted region .",
    "we show that these candidate counterparts are consistent with the overall stellar distribution of observations towards the nuclear bulge  although the relative proportions of the populations are different .",
    "candidate counterparts that are observed in the @xmath1-band have a higher tendency to be foreground sources and those observed only in the @xmath2 and @xmath3-bands are more likely to be nuclear bulge  sources .",
    "this is most likely to be an effect of the high levels of extremely spatially variable extinction ( see additional poster contribution by gosling et al . for further details ) towards the nuclear bulge .",
    "further observations including narrow - band br-@xmath28  imaging and near - infraredspectroscopy using the flamingos-2 instrument as well as comparison to other datasets such as the _ spitzer _  observations of the nuclear bulge  will be used to better identify the true companions to these x - ray sources  and so gain an understanding as to the nature of the nuclear bulge  x - ray source  population ."
