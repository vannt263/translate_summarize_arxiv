    "<S> we offer interferometry models for thermal ensembles with one - body losses and the phenomenological inclusion of perturbations covering most of the thermal atom experiments . a possible extension to the many - body case is briefly discussed . </S>",
    "<S> the ramsey pulses are assumed to have variable durations and the detuning during the pulses is distinguished from the detuning during evolution . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the pulses are not restricted to resonant operation and give more flexibility to optimize the interferometer to particular experimental conditions . </S>",
    "<S> on this basis another model is devised in which the contrast loss due to the unequal one - body population decays is cancelled by the application of a non - standard splitting pulse . for the importance of its practical implications , an analogous spin - echo model is also provided . </S>",
    "<S> the developed models are suitable for the analysis of atomic clocks and a broad range of sensing applications , they are particularly useful for trapped - atom interferometers . </S>"
