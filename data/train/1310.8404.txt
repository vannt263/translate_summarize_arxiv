    "<S> thus it is very important to identify the new resonance with the elementary higgs boson in the sm . </S>",
    "<S> atlas @xcite and cms @xcite have observed several decay channels of this higgs - like particle , including @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 channels , and have found that its properties are consistent with the sm higgs boson .    with the increasing of the experimental data , besides the above dominant decay channels , some rare decay modes will also be interesting . </S>",

    "<S> therefore , in order to analyze these exotic decays in the new physics beyond the sm , we should first evaluate their contributions in the sm . </S>",

    "<S> actually , we have confirmed this point in our numerical analysis .    </S>",
    "<S> the decay rate of @xmath75 can be obtained by integrating @xmath63 in the decay spectrum @xmath69 , so we get @xmath76 in which the contribution of the three - point diagrams is @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> since the four - point diagrams give very small contributions , both the charged lepton and neutrino masses can actually be neglected in our numerical calculations . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ rateemode ] ) for the @xmath73 and @xmath3 modes . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , the neutrinos are invisible , only a single photon and missing energy can be observed , so the decay rate of the higgs decays to a photon and invisible particles in the sm is @xmath78    in conclusion , we have analyzed the rare decay modes @xmath1 with @xmath2 and @xmath3 in the sm . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that these processes are dominated by the @xmath25 pole transition @xmath79 , and four - point box diagrams only give very small contributions . </S>",
