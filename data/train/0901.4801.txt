    "recent star and phenix experimental results @xcite have shown that light partons with high transverse momentum lose a significant amount of energy @xcite when traversing the dense nuclear medium created in central au+au collisions .",
    "this leads to suppression of high - p@xmath0 hadron yields and the disappearance of the away - side peak in azimuthal hadron - hadron correlation function .",
    "the investigation of the azimuthal correlation function of high - p@xmath0 hadrons with medium- or low - p@xmath0 associated particle have shown on the away side ( @xmath2 ) a broad double - peak structure .",
    "there is intensive discussion of the possible explanation of this observation including mach cone scenario @xcite , gluon cherenkov radiation @xcite , or jet deflection @xcite .",
    "an interesting question is whether similar effect is present in a case of heavy quarks passing the medium .",
    "heavy quarks are primarily produced during early stages of a nuclear collision , then they interact with the medium , and they can be used as a probe of the space - time evolution of the medium arising from a heavy ion collision . because of their large masses , they thermalize later and their energy loss is expected to be influenced by dead - cone effect and elastic energy loss .",
    "the direct identification of heavy quark mesons ( d , b ) is difficult with current detectors and rhic luminosities .",
    "therefore most previous studies used non - photonic electrons consisting of electrons from semileptonic decays of d and b. the identification uses semileptonic decays of open heavy flavor mesons ( e.g. @xmath3 ) over broad p@xmath0-range .",
    "these non - photonic electrons keep well direction of the mother heavy meson when electron has p@xmath4 3 gev / c @xcite .    for results presented here the data from cu+cu at @xmath1 = 200 gev measured in 2005 by star",
    "the analysis steps of the electron identification @xcite has been reported in details previously . in general , electrons are identified by the combination of the tpc @xcite ( time projection chamber ) ionization energy loss , the deposited energy in the bemc @xcite(barrel electromagnetic calorimeter ) , and the electromagnetic shower profile in the smd @xcite ( shower maximum detector ) .    the major difficulty in the electron analysis is the fact that there are many sources of the electrons other than semileptonic decays of heavy mesons , for instance from photon conversions in the detector material between the interaction point and the tpc and @xmath5 and/or @xmath6 dalitz decays .",
    "these photonic electrons are identified by the invariant mass distribution of electron - positron pairs .",
    "the photonic electron yield is given by the difference between the opposite- and same - sign distribution below the invariant mass cut ( typically @xmath5 mass ) .",
    "the same - sign distribution is due to combinations of random pairs .",
    "the purity of electron sample is above 99% @xcite .",
    "the study of the azimuthal non - photonic electron - hadron correlations ( trigger electron with @xmath7 gev / c and associated charged hadron with 0.15@xmath8 gev / c ) uses the semi - inclusive electron sample @xcite , when electrons with the opposite - sign partner with an invariant mass cut are excluded from the inclusive electron sample .",
    "the non - photonic electron - hadron correlations ( @xmath9 ) are obtained by the formula @xmath10 where each term represents correlation functions of the individual electron samples ( si - semi - inclusive , ss - same - sign , and os - opposite - sign ) with charged hadrons and @xmath11 is the efficiency of the photonic electron reconstruction estimated by embedding simulated data into real events .    despite large statistical errors ,",
    "one can see clear correlation structure of non - photonic electrons with hadrons in central ( centrality 0 - 20% ) cu+cu collisions ( fig .",
    "[ pict ] ) . on the nearside ( @xmath12 = 0 )",
    ", the single peak represents the heavy quark fragmentation . on the awayside ( @xmath12 = @xmath13 )",
    ", the correlation function shows a broad or possible double - hump structure . the elliptic flow ( v@xmath14 ) background was subtracted with the use of the zyam @xcite method .",
    "similar pattern has been seen in central au+au collisions ( centrality 0 - 20% ) @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ pict ] ) .",
    "the broad modification of the awayside peak in both cu+cu and au+au central collisions is similar to the di - hadron correlations in au+au , and probably indicates interaction of heavy quarks with the dense medium .",
