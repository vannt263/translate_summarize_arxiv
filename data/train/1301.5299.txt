    "* section 3 ) for a survey on bands and examples of left regular bands ; see also @xcite for a similar description for complex line and hyperplane arrangements ) .",
    "moreover , as @xmath2 determines the combinatorics of the arrangement , one can ask what are the connections between @xmath2 and other invariants of these arrangements .",
    "the relations between the face lrb on @xmath0 and its combinatorics can be found in the numerous restriction - deletion principles : zaslavsky s chamber counting formula @xcite , the deletion - restriction formula for the poincar polynomial @xmath6 and the addition - deletion theorem for the module of @xmath0-derivations @xmath7 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "other applications can be found in the description of the algebra @xmath8 in terms of quivers ( see @xcite ) , random walks on the faces of a hyperplane arrangement @xcite and in the ongoing investigation of the connections between the fundamental group @xmath9 and the combinatorics of @xmath0 ( see e.g. @xcite and many more ) .",
    "a natural question is what happens to these algebraic structures , associated to @xmath2 , when one deals with arrangements of smooth curves in @xmath1 ; i.e. topologically speaking , when we deal with real conic  line arrangements in @xmath1 .",

    "another motivation for a deeper investigation of the algebraic structure associated to @xmath2 for a conic - line arrangement @xmath0 , is that it is a natural candidate for an alternative product .",
    "this kind of phenomenon - an alternative product that replaces the associative one - is not unnatural : it appears also when looking at the poset of the faces of a building ( see tits ( * ? ? ?",

    "second , for deleting a component @xmath233 , the chamber counting restriction - deletion formula ( proposition [ prop - res - del - cl ] ) depends on the number of 1-dimensional faces in @xmath2 on this component having the same sign in @xmath93 , a number which does not appear on the restriction - deletion theorem for @xmath7 for deleting a component ( see ( * ? ? ?",
