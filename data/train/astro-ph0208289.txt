    "this represents only 13% of the detected luminosity .",
    "several hypotheses could explain this discrepancy : a metallicity effect ( berghfer s relation was determined for galactic stars but smc stars have weaker winds ) ; x - ray emission from the other ( unclassified ) stars in this region , especially from the low - mass stars ( see e.g. getman et al .",
    "2002 ) ; additional emission linked to interactions in binary systems ( such as colliding winds ) ; or an extended region of hot gas as the winds from the individual stars combine to form a cluster wind @xcite .",

    "both the arches and ngc3603 clusters the fitted temperature of the x - ray emission is higher than the @xmath27  kev value for ngc346 .",
    "+ it is important to note that the calculations presented by @xcite and @xcite for the arches cluster assume that there are about 60 stellar sources having mass - loss rates of 10@xmath28 m@xmath29 yr@xmath1 . if we take the list of the bluest stars in ngc 346 given by @xcite , the first 60 sources have spectral types in the range o3-b0 . assuming mass - loss rates for 8 smc stars given by @xcite to be typical , then all stars in ngc346 ( excluding hd5980 ) have mass - loss rates smaller than 10@xmath30 m@xmath29 yr@xmath1 .",
    "only mpg 435 ( o4iii(n)(f ) ) has a mass loss rate as high as 9@xmath1110@xmath31 m@xmath29 yr@xmath1 .",
    "however , the majority of these 60 stars are late o - type main sequence stars or cooler , which must have much smaller mass - loss rates ( 10@xmath32 m@xmath33 yr@xmath1 or less ) , and they are more widely distributed than in arches .",
    "thus , it is not surprising that the x - ray luminosity is lower than in arches , and , in fact , it may be too large to be explained solely with the cluster wind scenario .",
    "among all stars in ngc346 , hd5980  is unique in its spectral variations in the last two decades , and warrants further examination . this eclipsing binary ( or triple system ? ) was classified as wn+ob before 1980 , but its spectral type changed to wn3+wn4 in 19801983 , and to wn6 , with no trace of the companion in 1992 . in 1994 ,",
    "this star underwent a lbv - type eruption , and presented at the same time a wn11 type .",
    "the eruption has now settled down and the spectrum is returning to its pre - eruption state ( for more details see koenigsberger et al .",
    "2000 , and references therein ) . we will label the 1994 eruptor as ` star a ' and its companion as ` star b ' .",
    "+ _ chandra _ is the first x - ray telescope to detect this peculiar system , since the low spatial resolution of previous x - ray observatories did not allow the distinction of hd5980  from the extended emission surrounding it .",
    "however , even with a 100ks exposure , the data possess a rather low signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "acis - i count rate of hd5980  is only @xmath34  cnts  s@xmath1 in the @xmath35  kev band or about 300 counts in the total observation .",
    "this limits our ability to sensitively determine the spectral shape of the emission and to look for source variability . on the other hand",
    ", the relative faintness of the source means that photon pileup will not affect our analysis to any great degree .",
    "+ we have extracted a spectrum of hd5980  using the ciao tool _ psextract_. an annular background region around the source ( but sufficiently far from it ) was chosen , in order to eliminate contamination from the surrounding extended emission ( see   5 ) .",
    "this spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "[ spec59]a . the best fit model to the spectrum",

    "these absorption columns are consistent with the value expected for ngc346 ( see paper ii ) but part of these columns are probably due to wind absorption and/or absorption from the 1994 ejecta .",

    "+ we can compare hd5980  with other wr stars detected in x - rays .",
    "the unabsorbed x - ray luminosity of hd5980  is @xmath44  erg  s@xmath1 in the @xmath9  kev energy range and @xmath45  erg  s@xmath1 in the _ rosat _ range , i.e. @xmath46  kev .",
    "this places hd5980  amongst the x - ray brightest single wn stars @xcite and the brightest wr+ob binaries @xcite of the galaxy . +",
    "two factors could explain this high x - ray luminosity .",
    "first , the fast wind from the post - eruptive phases ( from 1300 ^-1kms@xmath1  in 1994 to @xmath32000 ^-1kms@xmath1  in 2000 ) should now collide with the slow wind ( ejected with a velocity as low as 200 ^-1kms@xmath1  during the eruption , see e.g. koenigsberger et al .",
    "2000 ) , which will increase the post - eruptive x - ray luminosity .",
    "x - ray emission from colliding ejecta has already been observed for another lbv , i.e. @xmath47 carinae . an elliptically shaped extended emission of 40@xmath1170(i.e . 0.4  pc@xmath110.8  pc ) in size",
    "surrounds the star in the x - ray domain @xcite .",
    "it is correlated to the high velocity ejecta of the homunculus nebula @xcite , which was created after the last great eruption .",
    "for hd5980 , however , the ejecta from the 1994 eruption has not had sufficient time to form a detectable lbv nebula around the star , and no ` homunculus - like ' nebula from a previous eruption is visible around hd5980  ( see fig .",
    "[ hst6540x ] ) : any x - ray emission from the colliding ejecta should thus still be blended with the stellar emission from hd5980  and that may contribute to explain the high x - ray luminosity .",
    "unfortunately , no x - ray detection of hd5980  before the 1994 eruption is available .",
    "a rosat all - sky survey image taken in 1990 ( exposure number 933001 ) provides only an upper limit of l@xmath4810@xmath49  erg  s@xmath1 at the position of hd5980 .",
    "@xcite gave a 3@xmath50 upper limit of 2@xmath1110@xmath51  erg  s@xmath1 for all smc wr stars , except ab7 .",
    "these limits are compatible with the detected luminosity of hd5980  and do not allow us to quantitatively compare the pre- and post - eruption luminosities to confirm the predicted luminosity enhancement .",
    "+ the fact that hd5980  is a close binary system containing two very massive stars , suggests that colliding winds may provide another source for the observed x - rays .",
    "we can thus estimate the expected x - ray luminosity .",
    "for the system , we assume that the stellar winds of the stars have returned to their pre - eruption values and we assume that @xmath52=1.4@xmath11  10@xmath31  m@xmath29  yr@xmath1 , @xmath53=2500  km  s@xmath1 for the o - star , and @xmath54= 2@xmath1110@xmath31  m@xmath29  yr@xmath1 , @xmath55=1700  km  s@xmath1 for the wn wolf - rayet star @xcite .",
    "thus the momenta of each star s wind are very similar , and the total wind kinetic energy is @xmath56 erg s@xmath1 .",
    "these wind parameters lead to a momentum ratio of @xmath57 @xcite and the wind - wind collision shock will lie halfway between the stars . in this configuration",
    "we expect about 1/6 of the wind kinetic energy to pass perpendicularly through the two shocks and be thermalised @xcite , and because the systems are relatively close much of this energy will be radiated defined by @xcite , for the wn wind @xmath58 and for the o - star wind @xmath59 . ] .",
    "+ consequently , we would expect the x - ray luminosity of hd5980  to be @xmath60  erg  s@xmath1 or more , rather than the observed value of @xmath61  erg  s@xmath1 .",
    "the discrepancy between the predicted and observed x - ray luminosities could be due to a range of factors , e.g. the winds may not be at the pre - eruption levels - lower mass - loss rates or lower wind velocities will translate to a lower x - ray luminosity .",
    "radiative braking , wind clumping , or the eclipse of the colliding wind region by the thick wind of star b could also reduce the luminosity .",
    "alternatively , the wind momenta may not be so nearly equal , as a low value of @xmath47 also tends to lower the luminosity .",
    "+ using the ephemeris of @xcite , we have computed a phase of @xmath62 for our _ chandra _ observation : this is close to the eclipse of star a by star b ( @xmath63=0.36 ) .",
    "if the eccentricity is @xmath64 , a simple adiabatic model predicts that the x - ray luminosity will vary inversely with separation .",
    "we may expect a change in the intrinsic x - ray luminosity of a factor of @xmath65 through the orbit and by @xmath3 10% during the",
    "_ chandra _ observation .",
    "we have detected a variation of apparently larger amplitude ( factor @xmath32 ) in the count rate of hd5980  ( see fig .",
    "[ spec59]b ) .",
    "this still suggests we are seeing orbital variability associated with colliding winds , since the additional effects of changing absorption on the observed luminosity can either reduce or enhance this variability . this observed variability is much more likely to be due to colliding winds than wind - blown bubble type emission , where no short timescale variability would be expected .",
    "the high fitted temperature of hd5980  @xmath66  kev also suggests that we are likely seeing colliding wind emission , as this temperature corresponds to a shock velocity of @xmath67 km s@xmath1 , comparable to the wind speed of star a ( @xmath53 above ) . + the detailed characteristics of the x - ray properties of hd5980   need to be studied further , in conjunction with detailed colliding wind models ( c.f .",
    "the case of @xmath47 carinae ; pittard & corcoran 2002 ) .",
    "xmm - newton _ observation is scheduled at phases @xmath68 , just after periastron : the comparison between these two datasets may enable us to detect further the signature of the colliding wind region , and constrain it more precisely .",
    "+ finally , we note that the unabsorbed x - ray luminosity of the central source in @xmath47 carinae , if we assume a distance of 2.3  kpc , varies between ( 0.6 and 2.5)@xmath1110@xmath69  erg  s@xmath1 @xcite .",

    "the snr hypothesis is further supported by the comparison of the size of this feature to its x - ray and radio fluxes @xcite . + as hd5980  is projected more or less at the center of the diffuse x - ray emission and it underwent a lbv - type eruption in 1994 ( which is unlikely to be the only one undergone by the system ) , it is tempting to associate the diffuse x - ray emission with hd5980 . to investigate whether this association is likely , we first compare hd5980with @xmath47 carinae , the most well - known lbv that have gone through multiple eruptions .",
    "@xmath47 car is also surrounded by bright , extended x - ray emission that appears to be assciated with the carina nebula : it is comparable in x - ray temperature ( @xmath18 ) , size and morphology to the x - ray emission around hd5980  ( seward & mitchell 1981 ; fig.[carina ] ) .",
    "but it is generally assumed that this nebula has been formed through the collective action of all stars of the carina cluster , not only by the single action of @xmath47 carinae .",
    "+ we have also searched for clues of an interaction between hd5980  and its surroundings ( e.g. a lbv nebula ) .",
    "@xcite noted evidence of such interaction : an arc of radius @xmath92 centered on the star is actually visible in h@xmath7  and [ oiii ]  ( but not in [ sii ] ) .",
    "however , this arc is rather diffuse ( see fig .  [ hst6540x ] ) , indicating a lack of shock compression .",
    "moreover , its velocity coincides with that of the quiescent region , and no line - splitting region is seen beginning at the arc and extending towards the star @xcite : this arc is certainly not the rim of an expanding shell .",
    "this optical arc has different size , shape , and location from an x - ray bright arc ( fig .",
    "[ hst6540x ] ) , therefore we conclude that they are probably two distinct features unrelated to each other .",
    "echelle spectra of this area also do not show any enhancement of the [ nii]/h@xmath7  ratio which usually indicates the presence of circumstellar material surrounding the star .",
    "the comparison between x - rays and visible data thus do not show any clear indication of an interaction between hd5980  and its environment .",
    "we also note that no circumstellar nebula produced by hd5980  could explain the redshifted uv absorptions in the spectra of the star , or the non - thermal radio emission from the extended source .",
    "+ the last possibility is that the source is indeed a snr , but that hd5980is still directly responsible for it .",
    "several authors have proposed the existence of a third component in hd5980 , ` star c ' , to interpret the visual light curve @xcite and the presence of stable photospheric absorptions in uv @xcite . to explain the existence of a snr , an additional , fourth component of the system , ` star d ' , is needed .",
    "it would now be a compact object , a remnant of the star that exploded in sn long ago .",
    "if star c is much farther away than the system a+b+d , then the high velocity redshifted uv absorptions could be produced by star c shining through the receding back wall of the snr .",
    "the presence of a compact object might explain the @xmath36  h variations seen in the lightcurve of hd5980by @xcite .",
    "accretion onto this compact object might also constitute another source of x - rays , thus contributing to understand the high x - ray emission from the system .",
    "in this series of articles , we report the analysis of the _ chandra _ data of n66 , the largest star formation region of the smc . in this first paper",
    ", we have focused on the most important objects of the field : the ngc346 cluster and hd5980 .",
    "+ the cluster itself is relatively faint , with a total luminosity of @xmath0  erg  s@xmath1 in the 0.3 - 10.0  kev energy range .",
    "most of this emission seems correlated with the location of the brightest stars of the core of the cluster , but the level of x - ray emission probably can not be explained solely by the emission from individual stars . + in this field lies another object of interest : hd5980 , a remarkable star that underwent a lbv - type eruption in 1994 .",
    "_ chandra _ is in fact the first x - ray telescope to detect hd5980  individually . in x - rays",
    ", the star appears very bright , comparable only to the brightest wr stars in the galaxy , but still fainter than @xmath47 carinae .",
    "the comparison of our results with future x - ray observations will enable us to better understand hd5980 : for example , phase - locked variations will be analysed in the perspective of the colliding wind behaviour of this binary , while other variations may be related to the recent lbv eruption .",
    "follow - up observations are thus needed to complete the study of this system .",
    "+ a bright , extended x - ray emission is seen to surround hd5980 .",
    "it is most probably due to a snr whose progenitor is unknown .",
    "the spatial coincidence of this extended x - ray emission with the peculiar massive star suggest an association between these two objects .",
    "we also note the close resemblance of this x - ray emission to the carina nebula in which the lbv @xmath47 carinae lies .",
    "+    we are grateful to dr martin a. guerrero roncel for useful suggestions on data analysis techniques .",
