    "consider the following experimental arrangement .",
    "a particle moves in one dimension , along the @xmath0 axis .",
    "a detector is placed in the position @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath2 be the time at which the particle is detected , which we denote as the `` time - of - arrival '' of the particle at @xmath3 .",
    "can we predict @xmath2 from the knowledge of the initial state of the particle ?    in classical mechanics ,",
    "the answer is simple .",
    "let @xmath4 be the general solution of the equations of motion corresponding to initial position and momentum @xmath5 and @xmath6 at @xmath7 .",
    "we obtain the time - of - arrival @xmath2 as follows .",
    "we invert the function @xmath8 with respect to @xmath9 , obtaining the function @xmath10 .",
    "the time of arrival @xmath2 at @xmath3 of a particle with initial data @xmath5 and @xmath6 is then @xmath11 two remarks are in order .",
    "first , if @xmath12 is multivalued , we are only interested in its lowest value , since the particle is detected the first time it gets to @xmath3 .",
    "second , for certain values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , it may happen that @xmath3 is outside the range of the function @xmath4 .",
    "this indicates that the detector in @xmath3 will never detect a particle with that initial state .",
    "the time - of- arrival is a physical variable that in a sense can take two kinds of values : either a real number @xmath13 , or the value : ",
    "@xmath2 = _ never _ \" .",
    "notice that in the latter case , the quantity @xmath2 formally computed from ( [ cl : tgen ] ) turns out to be complex .",
    "thus , a complex @xmath2 from ( [ cl : tgen ] ) ( for given @xmath14 ) means that the particle with initial data @xmath15 is never detected at @xmath3 .    in quantum mechanics ,",
    "the problem is surprisingly harder . in this case",
    "the time of arrival can be determined only probabilistically .",
    "let @xmath16 be the probability density that the particle is detected at time @xmath2 .",
    "namely , let @xmath17 be the probability that the particle is detected between the time @xmath18 and the time @xmath19 .",
    "how can we compute @xmath16 from the quantum state , e.g. from the particle s wave function @xmath20 at @xmath7 ?    to the best of our knowledge , this question has not received a complete treatment in the standard literature on quantum mechanics .",
    "the problem of computing the time of detection of a particle is usually treated in very indirect manners . for instance , the probability ( in time ) of detecting a decay product  say a particle escaping the potential of a nucleus can be obtained from the time evolution of the probability that the particle is still within the confining potential .",
    "alternatively , one can treat the detector that measures the time - of - arrival quantum - mechanically , and compute the probabilities for the positions of the detector pointer at a later time ; in this way one can trade a meaurement of the time - of - arrival for a measurement of position at a late fixed time . in the fifties , wigner considered the problem of relating the energy derivative of the wave function s phase shift to the scattering delay of a particle @xcite .",
    "this approach , later developed by smith @xcite and others ( see for instance gurjoy and coon @xcite ) gives the average delay , but fails to provide the full probability distribution of the time of arrival .",
    "( smith s paper begins with : `` it is surprising that the current apparatus of quantum mechanics does not include a simple representation for so eminently observable a quantity as the lifetime of metastable entities . '' ) in the seventies , piron discussed the problem in a conference proceeding @xcite , sketching ideas related to the ones developed here .",
    "ideas related to the ones presented here were explored in ref .",
    "@xcite , but in this case too only the average time - of - arrival was obtained , and not its full probability distribution .",
    "kumar @xcite studied the quantum first passage problem in a path integral approach , but did not obtain a positive probability density .",
    "the problem has been studied in the framework of hartle s generalized quantum mechanics @xcite by using sum over histories methods .",
    "various attempts in this direction and discussions of difficulties can be found in ref .",
    "see also the recent paper ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion of the problem and for references ; in particular , ref .",
    "@xcite discusses the difficulties one has to face in trying to compute _ sequences _ of times - of - arrival ",
    "an important problem which , however , we do not address here . as stressed by hartle in @xcite , generalized quantum mechanics",
    "_ generalizes _",
    "`` usual quantum mechanics '' ; here , on the other hand , we are interested in the question whether @xmath16 can be computed within the mathematical framework of conventional _ hamiltonian _ quantum mechanics .",
    "we see two reasons of interest for discussing the problem of computing time - of - arrival in quantum mechanics .",
    "first , it is a well posed problem in simple quantum theory , and there must be a solution .",
    "echoing smith @xcite , we do not expect that quantum mechanics could fail to predict a probability distribution that can be experimentally measured by simply placing a detector at a fixed position and noting the time at which it `` clicks '' .",
    "the problem is not just academic : it is related to the problem of computing the full probability distribution ( as opposed to the expectation value ) for the tunnelling time through a potential barrier .",
    "this problem has relevance , for instance , in computing rates of chemical reactions ( see , for example , kumar @xcite ) .",
    "second , the problem bears directly on the interpretation of quantum theories without newtonian time @xcite and thus on quantum gravity ; we shall briefly comment on this issue in closing .",
    "this paper is the first of a sequence of two .",
    "here we develop a general theory for the time - of - arrival operator , and study the free nonrelativistic particle case in detail . in a companion paper @xcite",
    ", we investigate a technique for the explicit construction of the time - of - arrival operator in more general cases , we extent our formalism to parametrized systems , and we study some less trivial models : a particle in an exponential potential and a cosmological model .",
    "in the next section we give a general argument , based on the superposition principle , for the existence of an operator @xmath21 ( the time - of - arrival operator ) such that @xmath16 can be obtained from the spectral decomposition of @xmath20 in eigenstates of @xmath22 , in the usual manner in which probability distribution are obtained in quantum theory .",
    "@xmath21 has peculiar properties that distinguish it from conventional quantum observables .",
    "we give a general argument based on the correspondence principle indicating that @xmath21 can be expressed in terms of position and momentum operators by the inverse of the classical equations of motion , eq .",
    "( [ cl : tgen ] ) .",
    "this does not suffice in fixing the operator , since factor - ordering ambiguities can be serious .",
    "the problem of the actual construction of the operator @xmath21 in more general systems will be addressed in @xcite . in section 3",
    "we study an explicit form of the operator in the case of a free nonrelativistic particle .",
    "we diagonalize the operator , providing a general expression for the time - of - arrival probability density @xmath16 . in particular , we calculate @xmath16 explicitly for a gaussian wave packet . in section 4",
    "we discuss some consequences of our construction .",
    "we notice that the existence of the operator implies that the quantum mechanics of a free particle can be expressed in a `` time - representation '' basis .",
    "we derive time  energy uncertainty relations .",
    "we conclude in section 5 with a general comment on the equivalence between time and position variables suggested by our results .",
    "in the appendix , we study whether the probability distribution we computed is reasonable , by comparing it with the one estimated indirectly using the schrdinger current . we find that the two agree within second order in the debroglie wavelength of the particle .",
    "the probability computed from the schrdinger current can not be physically correct to all orders because it is not positive definite ; whether or not the probability distribution computed with @xmath21 is physically correct to all orders is a question that can , perhaps , be decided experimentally .",
    "consider the quantum analog of the experimental situation sketched at the beginning of the paper : a particle is in an initial state @xmath24 at @xmath7 , and a particle detector is placed at @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath2 be the time at which the particle is detected .",
    "let @xmath25 be the probability that the particle is detected between times @xmath2 and @xmath26 .",
    "let @xmath24 and @xmath27 be two quantum states such that both @xmath28 and @xmath29 have support in the interval @xmath30 . consider the state formed as the linear combination @xmath31 ( where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are any two complex numbers with @xmath34 ) .    according to the superposition principle ,",
    "if a measurable quantity has a definite value @xmath35 when the system is in the state @xmath24 and value @xmath36 when the system is in the state @xmath27 , then a measurement of such a quantity in the state @xmath31 will yield either @xmath35 , or @xmath36 ( with respective probabilities @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) @xcite .",
    "if we assume the general validity of the superposition principle , we must then expect that the probability distribution @xmath39 will have support in the interval @xmath40 as well .",
    "therefore , the states @xmath24 such that @xmath28 has support on a given interval @xmath41 form a linear subspace of the state space .",
    "we can therefore define a projection operator @xmath42 as the projector on such a subspace .",
    "the superposition principle could fail for the time - of - arrival .",
    "however , we would be surprised if it did .",
    "notice that the question can ( probably easily ) be decided experimentally .",
    "perhaps an experiment testing the validity of the superposition principle in this contest could have some interest . here , we assume that the principle holds , and thus the projectors @xmath43 are well defined .    by their very definition ,",
    "the projectors satisfy @xmath44 if the interval @xmath45 is contained in the interval @xmath46 , and @xmath47 if the two intervals are disjoint .",
    "the operators @xmath42 can therefore be written in terms of a family of ( spectral ) projectors @xmath23 as @xmath48 the ( spectral ) family @xmath23 contains all the information needed to compute @xmath16 .",
    "indeed , from the definition given , and using again the superposition principle , we have easily @xmath49 thus the probability distribution @xmath16 can be obtained in terms of the spectral family @xmath23 , in the same way in which all probability distributions are obtained in quantum mechanics .",
    "indeed , recall that if @xmath50 is the self - adjoint quantum operator corresponding to the observable quantity @xmath51 , then the probability distribution @xmath52 of measuring the value @xmath51 on the state @xmath24 is @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the spectral family associated to @xmath50 , namely @xmath55      one may be immediately tempted to define a `` time - of - arrival operator '' in analogy with ( [ pa ] ) as @xmath57 so that an eigenstate of this operator with eigenvalue @xmath2 would be a ( generalized ) state detected precisely at time @xmath2 .",
    "however , there is an important difference from usual self - adjoint quantum mechanical observables that must be addressed before doing so . if @xmath54 is the spectral family of a self - adjoint operator @xmath50 , then",
    "@xmath58 where @xmath59 is the identity operator .",
    "on the other hand , define @xmath60 by @xmath61 there is no reason for @xmath60 to be the identity .",
    "if it is not , we say that the spectral family @xmath23 is  incomplete \" .",
    "incompleteness occurs because it is not true that any state is certainly detected at some time .",
    "most likely , there are states that are never detected , given that such states exist in the classical theory as well .",
    "thus , @xmath60 projects on the subspace @xmath62 formed by the states in which the particle is detected at some time at @xmath3 , and @xmath63 is the projector on the subspace @xmath64 of states in which the particle is never detected at @xmath3 . the fact that those two classes of states form orthogonal linear subspaces follows from the superposition principle again .",
    "thus , @xmath65 is properly defined by ( [ t1 ] ) on @xmath66 only .",
    "if we define the time - of - arrival operator by ( [ t1 ] ) on the entire state space , then we have the awkward consequence that the states in the range of @xmath67 and the ones in @xmath68 are both annihilated by @xmath65 .",
    "namely @xmath65 does not distinguish the states in which the particle is detected at @xmath69 from the ones in which it is never detected .    the full information that we need in order to compute @xmath16 is contained in the incomplete spectral family @xmath23 , or , equivalently , in the two mutually commuting operators @xmath60 , and @xmath65 , where @xmath65 is a self - adjoint operator on the hilbert space @xmath70 .",
    "notice that @xmath71 is the expected time - of - arrival in those states that are detected at all , and is thus a _",
    "conditional _ expectation value .",
    "as defined in ( [ t1 ] ) , @xmath21 annihilates all states in @xmath72 .",
    "it is useful to replace this definition by fixing the following convention for the action of @xmath21 on @xmath73 .",
    "we define @xmath65 on the _ entire _ state space , by mimicking what happens in classical mechanics : we choose ( arbitrarily , at this stage ) a ( diagonalizable ) action of @xmath21 on @xmath74 with a complex ( non - real ) spectrum , with the understanding that any complex eigenvalue be interpreted as ",
    "the particle is never detected \" .",
    "if we use this convention , the operator @xmath21 is not self - adjoint , but it still has a complete and orthogonal basis of eigenstates .",
    "the reason for such a convention ( which we postulate from now on ) will be given below ; its utility will be particularly clear in @xcite .      in the previous section",
    "we have argued on general grounds that a time - of - arrival operator @xmath21 giving the time - of - arrival probability distribution should exist .",
    "how can we construct the operator @xmath75 , from the knowledge of the dynamics of the system ?",
    "let us work in the heisenberg picture .",
    "the quantum theory is defined by the heisenberg state space , in which states do not evolve .",
    "let @xmath24 be a heisenberg state .",
    "the elementary operators are heisenberg position operator @xmath76 and the momentum operator @xmath77 , representing position and momentum at @xmath7 .",
    "since all operators can be constructed in terms of @xmath76 and @xmath77 , we expect to be able to express @xmath78 as an operator function of @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "a key requirement on @xmath21 is that it yield the correct results in the classical limit ( bohr s correspondence principle ) .",
    "if so , the dependence of @xmath21 on @xmath76 and @xmath77 should reduce to the classical dependence of @xmath2 on @xmath5 and @xmath6 in the classical limit .",
    "this indicates that the dependence of the operator @xmath21 on @xmath76 and @xmath77 is given by some ordering of the function ( [ cl : tgen ] ) , which , we recall , was obtained by inverting the solutions @xmath4 of the classical equations of motion .",
    "thus , we should have that @xmath79 where an ordering has to be chosen .",
    "the @xmath80-number @xmath3 , we recall , is the position of the detector .",
    "notice at this point the usefulness of the convention that complex eigenvalues represent non - detection : this can go through naturally in the classical limit .",
    "( [ t11 ] ) does not suffice in general for characterizing @xmath21 uniquely , because the correct physical ordering of the operator function can be highly non - trivial . in the companion paper @xcite",
    ", we investigate a technique for constructing the operator @xmath81 and fixing the ordering ambiguities .    in order to emphasize the dependence of the time - of - arrival operator @xmath21 on the position @xmath3 of the detector",
    ", we will , from now on , write the operator as @xmath81 .",
    "analogously , we will denote the spectral family of projectors associated to @xmath81 as @xmath82 , and the probability distribution of the time - of - arrival at @xmath3 as @xmath83 .",
    "the construction above can be easily generalized to a systems with @xmath84 degrees of freedom .",
    "a classical state of such a system is described by a point in the @xmath85dimensional phase space @xmath86 , with coordinates @xmath87 .",
    "the dynamics is generated by the hamiltonian @xmath88 .",
    "the hamilton equations of motion are @xmath89 .",
    "the general solutions to these equations can be written as @xmath90 where @xmath91 are @xmath92 independent integration constants .",
    "in particular , we may choose as integration constants @xmath93 the values of @xmath94 at @xmath7 , @xmath95 .",
    "the above equations enable us to compute the state of the system at any time @xmath9 .",
    "we are interested in the time - of - arrival of the particle at a given value of _ one _ of the phase space coordinates , say @xmath96 .",
    "( since the coordinates @xmath94 are arbitrary , @xmath96 can be any combination of dynamical variables . ) to compute the time - of - arrival @xmath97 at @xmath98 , we solve the 1st equation of the system ( [ ham ] ) @xmath99 with respect to @xmath9 , obtaining @xmath100 .",
    "the time - of - arrival @xmath97 is then given by @xmath101    now , in the quantum theory , the constants of motion @xmath102 correspond to heisenberg operators @xmath103 .",
    "( [ t11 ] ) is immediately generalized by `` quantizing '' ( [ t21 ] ) as @xmath104 where , again , the operator @xmath105 is given only up to the ordering .    before concluding this section , we add an important comment on the seemingly puzzling case @xmath106 , namely when the detection time is _ earlier _ than @xmath7 . in the classical case",
    ", the particle can be detected without being disturbed , but not so in quantum mechanics ; therefore one might wonder about the meaning of a detection at @xmath106 for a particle that has a certain state at time @xmath7 .",
    "the difficulty is avoided by choosing the definition of  state \" appropriate to the present context .",
    "consider the classical case first . @xmath5 and",
    "@xmath6 fix a unique solution of the equations of motion .",
    "this solution could be characterized by the values of @xmath0 and @xmath107 at any other time , or any two constants of the motion .",
    "the definition of  time - of - arrival \" that avoids the problem of detection - before - preparation is the following .",
    "we are interested in the arrival time of a particle which is moving according to the ( unique ) solution of the equations of motion characterized by the fact that at @xmath7 the particle is at @xmath5 and @xmath6 if not disturbed .",
    "analogously , in quantum mechanics @xmath2 is the time - of - arrival of a particle that at an earlier time @xmath9 ( arbitrarily in the past ) was in the ( schrdinger ) state @xmath108 uniquely characterized by the fact that , if not disturbed , it would evolve to the state @xmath109 at @xmath7 . in the last section we shall describe a general way of dealing with this situation .",
    ".5 cm    to summarize : in this section we have put forward two physical hypotheses :    * the probability for the time - of - arrival @xmath83 an experimentally measurable quantity can be computed by @xmath110 where @xmath82 are the projectors on the real component of the spectrum of a diagonalizable operator @xmath81 .",
    "the states in the span of the non - real component of the spectrum of @xmath81 are never detected at @xmath3 . *",
    "the operator @xmath81 is given by a suitable choice of ordering from the equation @xmath111 or , in general , equation ( [ t22 ] ) .",
    "the first hypothesis is motivated by our confidence in the general validity of the superposition principle .",
    "the second hypothesis is motivated by our confidence in the correspondence principle .",
    "in the next section we investigate some of the implications of these hypotheses and we illustrate the construction and the use of the operator @xmath81 in a simple case .",
    "more interesting models , with a non trivial @xmath56 operator , will be presented in the companion paper @xcite .",
    "consider a nonrelativistic free particle in one dimension .",
    "dynamics is generated by the hamiltonian @xmath112 .",
    "the solutions of the classical equations of motion are @xmath113 the inversion of these yields the time at which a particle that at @xmath7 has initial position and momentum @xmath15 is detected at the position @xmath3 ( as in equation ( [ cl : tgen ] ) ) @xmath114 notice that up to problems at the point @xmath115 ( problems with which we shall deal extensively later ) the particle is always detected . in particular , @xmath116 is never complex .",
    "this simplifies the setting greatly , since we may disregard the complications arising from the existence of ( finite ) regions of phase space in which the particle is not detected .",
    "let us consider the usual quantum theory of a free particle .",
    "we work in the heisenberg picture .",
    "we have heisenberg ( non - evolving ) states @xmath24 , and time dependent heisenberg position and momentum operators @xmath117 , expressed in terms of @xmath76 and @xmath77 . following the ideas of the previous section , we explore the hypothesis that the quantum probability distribution @xmath83 of the time - of - arrival at @xmath3 of the particle can be computed in terms of an operator @xmath81 defined by a suitable ordering of the ( formal ) operator function @xmath118    notice that the heisenberg position operator is @xmath119 to be compared with ( [ cl ] ) : thought rarely emphasized ,",
    "classical and quantum dynamics are generically related by the equation @xmath120 where the rhs is an operator function corresponding to an ordering of the solution @xmath121 of the classical equations of motion . in general , equation ( [ dotting ] ) is of scarce use for solving the quantum dynamics , since the associated ordering problem is serious ; but in simple cases such as the free particle , we see from ( [ simple ] ) that the natural ordering suffices .",
    "we explore here the possibility that in the case of a free particle a natural ordering suffices for the time - of - arrival operator as well .",
    "namely , we study the choice of a symmetric ordering for the operator ( [ eccolo ] ) .",
    "we thus define , tentatively , @xmath122 in order to study this operator , let us choose a concrete representation for the hilbert space , namely a basis .",
    "it is convenient to use the momentum basis that diagonalizes @xmath77 , because this basis makes the definition of @xmath123 simpler .",
    "thus , we work in the heisenberg - picture momentum basis . the states are represented as functions @xmath124 , and the elementary operators @xmath76 and @xmath77 are given by @xmath125 in terms of the above operators , we have , for example , the heisenberg position operator ( [ simple ] ) @xmath126 in this representation , the operator @xmath81 given in ( [ t3 ] ) is @xmath127\\psi(k).\\ ] ] ( we always take the principal value of the square root : @xmath128 for @xmath129 . )    notice that the @xmath130parameter family of operators @xmath81 can be generated unitarily via translations @xmath131 therefore it is sufficient to study the operator @xmath132 , namely we do not loose generality by assuming the detector to be at the origin .",
    "we thus put @xmath133 from now on , and drop the explicit @xmath3 dependence @xmath134 we will be interested in the operators corresponding to other positions of the detector later on .    in the momentum representation , the eigenvalue equation for @xmath22 @xmath135 becomes @xmath136g_t(k)= t\\    g_t(k).\\ ] ] where we have introduced the notation @xmath137 for the momentum representation of the eigenstate of @xmath21 .",
    "the eigenvalue equation is easily solved ( in each half of the real line ( @xmath138 ) by @xmath139 where @xmath140 is the characteristic function of the positive half of the real line , and @xmath141 are constants independent of @xmath142 . in order to fix the relation between @xmath143 and @xmath144 , let us act on @xmath145 by @xmath21 .",
    "a simple calculation shows @xmath146 thus , in order to satisfy the eigenvalue equation , it is necessary that .",
    "one then obtains the same continuity condition ( [ concon ] ) on @xmath145 . ]",
    "@xmath147 at this point , we encounter a difficulty .",
    "the operator we have constructed does _ not _ have a basis of orthogonal eigenstates .",
    "this pathology destroys the possibility of giving @xmath21 the interpretation we want . in the next subsection",
    "we show that the eigenstates of @xmath21 are not orthogonal and we discuss a way out from this difficulty .",
    "a simple calculation shows that for any two eigenstates of @xmath21 with eigenvalues @xmath2 and @xmath148 @xmath149 the eigenstates fail to be orthogonal .",
    "one can also see that @xmath78 as defined above has no self - adjoint extensions by noticing that its deficiency indices are unequal .",
    "this difficulty stalled us for sometime , and various attempts to circumvent the problem failed .",
    "a way out was then suggested by marolf @xcite . the idea is to seek an operator that in the classical limit would not reproduce the time - of - arrival exactly , but",
    "would rather reproduce a quantity arbitrary close to the time - of - arrival .",
    "namely , we want to approximate the time - of - arrival with a different quantity , free from pathologies .",
    "it is easy to trace the above pathology to the singular behavior of @xmath150 at @xmath151 .",
    "even classically , a state with @xmath151 is physically disturbing : either the particle is never detected or the particle may stably sit over the detector .",
    "therefore , we seek a small modification of ( [ t ] ) such that no divergences occur at @xmath115 . the modified time - of - arrival",
    "can perhaps be interpreted as the outcome of a measurement by an apparatus arbitrarily similar to a perfect detector , but which does not allow the particle to stand still .",
    "let us introduce an arbitrary small positive number @xmath152 . consider a 1parameter family of real bounded continuous odd functions @xmath153 which approach @xmath150 pointwise .",
    "more precisely , we require @xmath154 for instance , we may choose @xmath155 to be compared with the unregulated operator ( [ tonex ] ) .",
    "notice that on any state with support on @xmath156 the operators @xmath157 and @xmath158 are equal .",
    "their action differs only on the component of a state with arbitrary low momentum .",
    "as we shall see , the probability distribution for the time - of - arrival @xmath16 computed from @xmath159 will turn out to be _ independent of @xmath152 _ for states with support away from @xmath151 reinforcing the credibility of the regulation procedure we are using .",
    "let us study the operator @xmath159 .",
    "a key point is that @xmath159 commutes with @xmath160 .",
    "thus , we can choose a basis of solutions of the eigenvalue equation for @xmath159 formed by functions of @xmath142 which have support on positive or negative @xmath142 only .",
    "now @xmath161 is a linear differential operator and since @xmath162 as @xmath163 , there is no continuity condition on its eigenstates at @xmath151 .",
    "these two related properties lead to a degeneracy in the spectrum . for each eigenvalue @xmath2 , there are two eigenstates , which we choose as having support in the @xmath164 regions respectively . namely @xmath165 where @xmath166 we introduce the notation @xmath167 for the momentum representation of the eigenstates of @xmath161 .",
    "a simple calculation shows that these are @xmath168 explicitly , for @xmath169 we have @xmath170    in order to derive various properties of these eigenstates , it is convenient to introduce new coordinates on the right and left halves of the real line , as follows .",
    "@xmath171 in the region @xmath156 , @xmath172 . in what follows",
    ", we do not need the specific form of @xmath173 in the region @xmath174 .",
    "note first that in each half , the jacobian of the coordinate transformation is non - vanishing @xmath175 , and thus , the new coordinates are strictly monotonic . at the points @xmath176 ,",
    "@xmath177 respectively . furthermore , since @xmath178 rapidly enough as @xmath179 , we see that both @xmath180 . in terms of these coordinates ,",

    "the expectation values obviously satisfy ehrenfest s theorem . a more accurate check which goes beyond the semiclassical approximation",
    "is to compare the probability distribution we have obtained with the one we can _ estimate _ by indirect but intuitive methods . in appendix a.1 ,",
    "we first compute an approximation to the probability amplitude ( [ psi(tx ) ] ) and the resulting probability density for a gaussian state .",
    "this also gives us some intuition for the behavior of the the distribution .",
    "then in appendix a.2 , we compute the schrdinger current through the detector position , and compare this with the approximation we will obtain in section a.1 .      consider the gaussian wavepacket of section 3.5 . in the momentum representation , this state is given by @xmath279 the envelope of this wave function is a gaussian of width @xmath209 at positive momentum @xmath210 . in order to simplify the calculations , we slightly modify this state by assuming it to be zero for @xmath280 .",
    "clearly , since this modification is far out on the tail of the gaussian , the error we make is very small ( more precisely , one can show that it vanishes as @xmath281 ) .",
    "we thus replace ( [ ss : krep2 ] ) by @xmath282 where @xmath283 is the characteristic function of the positive line . substituting this expression into ( [ tofxrep ] ) , we find that the amplitude for the particle to be detected between @xmath2 and @xmath26 at the position @xmath0 is @xmath284\\cr&&\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath285 is again exponentially small , @xmath286 , and we have disregarded an @xmath152-dependent phase , which is not going to affect the probability distribution .    now we can expand @xmath287 about the peak of the gaussian as @xmath288 using this expansion , we can compute the gaussian integral in ( [ psiapp1 ] ) @xmath289\\left(1+i \\frac{x - x_0-\\frac{\\hbar t k_0}{m}}{4k_0(\\delta^2   + i\\frac{\\hbar t}{2 m})}\\right)+r_2\\right],\\cr&&\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath290 is of second order in @xmath291 .",

    "in fact , the current @xmath312 is _ not _ positive definite , and we believe that this is related to the difficulties in the approaches of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "equivalently , we may try to interpret the current _ of a pure right moving state _ as the probability density that the particle crosses @xmath1 .",
    "we are reassured in doing this by the fact that in this case the current is positive definite , and its integral over all times gives one .",
