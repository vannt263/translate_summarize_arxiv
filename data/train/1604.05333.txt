    "however , taking in account the error bars , our data does not support a rise of the ratio towards higher redshifts as might be expected if bh growth preceded galaxy stellar mass growth for the whole population .",
    "in this work we use the mass densities of stellar matter and bhs to investigate co - evolution over a wide redshift range .",
    "the smd is the integrated average stellar mass per @xmath261 and as such does not provide any information about the underlying mass distribution .",

    "the bhmd represents the average bh mass in a volume of one comoving @xmath261 .",
    "we derived this quantity using the soltan argument and therefore assume that the bulk bh mass growth occurs in quasar phases . therefore the bhmd is naturally dominated by the most luminous agn , which show the highest bh mass growth .",
    "although we have lost the information about the underlying bh and galaxy mass distributions , we have gained the ability to robustly estimate both quantities over a wide redshift range .    the majority of the panels in fig.[figure_smdbhmdrelation ] show a power law correlation between bhmd and smd below @xmath183 with a slope around unity .",
    "the same signature can be seen in fig.[figure_bhmd_div_smd ] where the logarithmic ratio of both quantities has remarkable little to no redshift evolution up to @xmath183 .",
    "we interpret this as lock - step growth of the two quantities from @xmath183 to @xmath145 .    while this result does not allow us to conclude that all individual bhs and their hosts grow in lock - step in this redshift range",
    ", it does strongly suggest that as a population , the systems , which dominate the mass growth , do follow this lock - step growth .    at higher redshifts around @xmath264 and given the completeness of the smfs and qlfs , the bhmd to smd ratio does not show a strong evolution . however , at the highest redshifts the ratio of bhmd to smd seems to decrease slightly rather than to increase . while an increase could be interpreted as generally over massive bhs compared to the local value , a decrease would imply the opposite .",
    "the evolution of the bh galaxy scaling relations has been a vivid topic of investigation .    while at redshifts below @xmath265 the bh to galaxy bulge mass relation does no seem to evolve ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , studies at higher redshift ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) find a positively evolving relation , suggesting that larger bhs ( @xmath266 ) pre - date the formation of their host galaxy bulges at these redshifts .",
    "most similar to our method , @xcite estimate the evolution on the @xmath11 relation using bhmds and smds .",
    "their results also favor a positively evolving bh to galaxy bulge mass relation .",
    "however , simulations of merging disc galaxies @xcite seem to disfavor the picture in which smbhs develop significantly before their parent bulges .",
    "regarding the relation between the bh and the total galaxy stellar mass , @xcite find the bh mass to _ total _ stellar mass relation not to be evolving , whereas @xcite and @xcite find a positive evolution .",
    "@xcite illustrate in their figure38 that on average @xmath267 increases from its local value @xcite towards higher redshift .",
    "however , these high redshift data points suffer selection effects that are hard to quantify and sample bias towards more luminous systems .",
    "also bulge disc decomposition becomes increasingly difficult in non - local systems with an agn .",
    "if the total instead of the bulge stellar mass is used , the evolution of the ratio with z weakens or even disappears below @xmath268 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "38b , green points ) .",
    "@xcite showed very convincingly that evolutionary trends in the apparent ratio of the bh to galaxy bulge mass relations do not carry over to an intrinsic offset once selection effects @xcite are taken in account .",
    "they do not demonstrate this for the studies of @xcite and @xcite above but for a variety of other works ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) ) .    in conclusion",
    "the bh to bulge mass relation seems to be evolving positively with redshift ( see also @xcite ) , while the studies on bh to total stellar mass ratio are more ambiguous .",
    "while our work somewhat disagrees with @xcite , it fits well into the line of recent works ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) finding only very little evidence for an evolution of the ratio of bh to _ total _ galaxy stellar mass up to @xmath183 .",
    "on this basis we find that bh mass growth _ did not _",
    "precede _ total _ stellar mass growth in any of our data sets .",
    "the data of systems that show over massive bhs compared to their galaxy properties could well be only a subset of the total distribution of bh and host galaxy systems .",
    "we compare our results , which are based on observational data , with the results of the illustris @xcite and the eagle @xcite simulations .",
    "the illustris simulation is a large scale cosmological hydrodynamical simulation .",
    "it covers a volume of @xmath269 with more than 12 billion resolution elements .",
    "state - of - the - art physical models describing the relevant physics for galaxy formation are included , allowing for the study of the properties black holes and their host galaxies .",
    "for our purpose we use the bh accretion rate ( bhar ) and star formation rate density ( sfrd ) of the highest resolution illustris simulation ( @xmath270 ) , published in @xcite .",
    "both quantities are integrated across redshift to calculate the bhmd and the smd .",
    "we rescale the sfrd from a chabrier to a salpeter imf and use a return fraction of 0.27 , according to salpeter imf , to calculate the smd .",
    "the simulation calibrates the efficiency of the bh feedback to reproduce the observed cosmic star formation history and the @xmath145 stellar mass function .",
    "furthermore , the quasar efficiency factor has been set to match the normalization of the @xmath271 relation in isolated galaxy mergers .",
    "while the illustris simulation slightly over predicts the absolute values of the total stellar and black hole mass density , their evolution follows the data calculated in this work and the smd from the sfrd of @xcite closely .",
    "regarding the smd this is not surprising , since the bh feedback was tuned to reproduce the star formation history .",
    "the evolution of the bh mass density , however , is not pre - determined .",
    "the eagle simulations @xcite are a suite of hydrodynamical cosmological simulations run with a version of the gadget 3 code that includes a new hydrodynamics solver , new time stepping , and new sub - grid physics . we adopt the smd of @xcite and the bhmd ( rosas - guevara et al . , in preparation ) from the large simulation ref - l100n1504 with @xmath272 particles in a box of @xmath273 comoving @xmath274 .",
    "while the illustris simulation is designed to match the observed star formation history and therefore the redshift evolution of the feedback efficiency is calibrated , the eagle simulation only matches to @xmath275 observational data and thus both bhmd and smd evolution are not pre - determined .",
    "the sub - grid physics concerning stellar and agn feedback are calibrated to match the @xmath275 , local galaxy stellar mass function as well as the normalization of the bh galaxy mass scaling relation , which is mainly determined by the efficiency parameter of agn feedback .",
    "the smd includes only stellar mass in galaxies excluding the mass associated with intra cluster light .",
    "the eagle simulation uses a chabrier imf and thus we have rescaled the mass density to a salpeter imf .",
    "the bhmd only includes the accreted black hole mass and not the original seed masses and is thus the best comparison to the bhmd we calculated .",
    "the simulations and our data are computed assuming slightly different cosmological parameters . yet , the maximum difference in terms of cosmological volumes at a redshift of @xmath183 are below @xmath276 and thus we are confident to compare them to another without recalibrating to one cosmological parameter set .",
    "we compare the simulation data to our inferred bhmd to total smd ratio in fig.[figure_bhmd_div_smd ] .",
    "the data from the illustris simulation is portrayed as a black solid line , while the data from the eagle simulation is shown as a black dashed line .",
    "the illustris bhmd to smd ratio ( black solid line ) follows our data points closely and is almost always within the @xmath27 error bars of the data points .",
    "the data from the eagle simulation , the black dashed line in fig.[figure_bhmd_div_smd ] , matches our data points as well in panels c ) , d ) , e ) and f ) and at @xmath277 in all panels .",
    "both simulations agree well with our data and show a nearly flat redshift evolution of the bhmd to smd ratio up to redshifts of @xmath40 where it starts to decline slightly .",
    "in this work we have calculated the bhmd and smd to evaluate possible signatures from bh - galaxy co - evolution up to high redshifts .",
    "we calculated the smd from multiple measurements of smfs and the cosmic sfrd of @xcite , while we have used the soltan argument on various qlfs to obtain measurements of the bhmd .",
    "the values of our calculated smds at various redshifts agree well with the values in the recent review of @xcite .",
    "we also compare our bhmd at @xmath145 with previous studies and find generally good agreement .",
    "our data shows clear lock - step growth of the bhmd with the smd in the redshift regime @xmath278 .",
    "if the bhmd - smd - relations , shown in fig.[figure_smdbhmdrelation ] , are fitted with power laws , we find values for the exponent between @xmath279 to @xmath280 .",
    "these values are surprisingly close to unity . while local estimates of the bh mass to stellar bulge mass relation have very similar slopes ,",
    "the smd - bhmd can not be easily compared to the local relations .",
    "it is an evolutionary sequence of integrated distributions of bh mass and stellar mass and not a `` snapshot '' of their distributions at @xmath145 .",
    "we show that the logarithmic ratio of bhmd to smd seems to be roughly constant from @xmath145 to @xmath163 within the @xmath27 uncertainties .",
    "therefore bh mass growth and stellar mass growth trace very well over long periods of time up to high redshifts .",
    "since the considered quantities hold information about the integrated distribution of bhs and galaxies , information about the distributions itself can not be accessed .",
    "therefore we can not distinguish between physical processes that connect or regulate bh and stellar mass growth and scenarios of secular evolution for both quantities .",
    "however , our data does not support a scenario in which bh growth preceded _ total _ galaxy stellar mass growth . in light of this result ,",
    "bhs , which are over massive according to bh galaxy scaling relations , are likely to be outliers of the full distribution .      at high redshifts measurements of bh mass and galaxy properties",
    "become increasingly difficult . on this basis following the local bh mass galaxy relations up to high redshifts to understand their evolution and origins",
