    "one of the postulates of quantum mechanics tells us that an observable physical quantity is represented by a hermitian operator .",
    "the postulate ensures that every eigenvalue of such an operator is real , and , since every result of a measurement corresponds to an eigenvalue of an operator , all measured quantities are real .",
    "one may now ask , if there is the possibility that , when dealing with a non - hermitian hamiltonian , an entirely or partially real eigenvalue spectrum occurs .",
    "the answer brings us to the notion of @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "@xmath0 symmetry stands for the combined action of the operators parity reflection @xmath1 and time or motion reversal @xmath2 . a @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonian does not necessarily have to be hermitian .",
    "nevertheless , bender and boettcher found in their paper from 1998 @xcite that there are parameter regimes in @xmath0-symmetric systems where the eigenvalue spectra are entirely real .",
    "the non - hermiticity entering @xmath0-symmetric systems can be interpreted in that this is an effective description of an open quantum system with a situation of balanced gain and loss .",
    "due to a close analogy between the schrdinger equation and the equations describing the propagation of light in structured wave guides , the theory of @xmath0 symmetry was applied to these optical systems @xcite .",
    "soon , the first @xmath0-symmetric optical systems could be realized @xcite .",
    "other analogies with quantum mechanics could be used to create @xmath0-symmetric systems , including laser modes @xcite , electronics @xcite , and microwave cavities @xcite .",
    "it was proposed @xcite that a system similar to @xmath0-symmetric wave guides could be realized using a in a double - well potential , where in one well particles are injected , while from the other well particles are removed . however , as was already mentioned by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite care must be taken with regard to the interaction in since this could modify or even destroy the @xmath0-symmetric properties .",
    "nevertheless , could provide an experimental realization of @xmath0 symmetry in a genuine quantum system , which up to date is still missing .    in a schematic approach ,",
    "the @xmath0-symmetric bose - hubbard model for two modes has been considered , and it could be shown that the mean - field limit is a good approximation even in the presence of a complex non - hermitian potential @xcite . in terms of the and a model @xmath3-type potential",
    "it was confirmed that the nonlinear term entering the dynamical equation does not destroy the features of @xmath0-symmetry , rather these properties are maintained and even new prospects do appear @xcite .",
    "the extension of the model to a realistic external potential gives qualitatively the same results @xcite .",
    "in all those investigations the @xmath0-symmetric potential was predetermined and no detailed mechanism was explained on how to actually realize @xmath0 symmetry , which leaves some discomfort . as mentioned above ,",
    "a non - hermitian system is an effective description of an underlying hermitian system , so when discussing in detail the realization of @xmath0-symmetry , this hermitian system must be given .",
    "it is the purpose of this work to demonstrate that a @xmath0-symmetric external potential for can be realized with tilted optical lattices with a defect .",
    "the defect consisting of two potential wells at the same height , i.e. , a discontinuity in the tilt , acts as a @xmath0-symmetric subsystem .",
    "the in- and outfluxes of the condensate s probability density can be modeled as imaginary @xmath0-symmetric contributions .",
    "when such a system is explicitly given , an experimental realization of @xmath0 symmetry in a is possible .",
    "this is an important step in the research of @xmath0-symmetric , since even when no future experiment is done according to the proposals of this work , the investigations performed in the above mentioned references are justified and the gap originating from the sketchiness of the @xmath0-symmetric potential is closed .",

    "this yields the solutions @xmath101 and @xmath102 with the plus sign in eq .  , otherwise there are no solutions . if we can make sure that for a certain realization the minus sign is chosen in eq",
    "then the linear system of equations can be solved as long as the embedded and reservoir wells are not empty , which is an advantage compared to the case of constant @xmath71 .      with the previous investigations we fixed the matrix elements of the hamiltonian   @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 of the multi - mode model . for the minimal four - mode model @xcite , all matrix elements are determined and no freedom",

    "this possibility should allow for an easy experimental realization as an optical lattice with a linear stark potential is an approved technique used in many experiments .",

    "in addition , a large population in the reservoir wells can make the onsite energies extremely large , which would be another difficulty in an experimental setup .    for this reasons we continue",
    "the investigations started in @xcite by choosing more than two reservoir wells and consequently increasing the number of wells which leads us to the discussion of @xmath0-symmetric currents in optical lattices with a linear stark potential .",
    "here , we give only a few example calculations .",

    "we start with the six - mode model with one additional reservoir well on each side compared to the four - mode model .",
    "this is the most simple extension of the four - mode system with a symmetric number of wells on each side of the embedded wells .",
    "it effectively enlarges the reservoir , since the reservoir wells directly coupled to the embedded wells can now be fed by the outer wells and thus the time that is available for realizing @xmath0 symmetry is extended . as a first example we consider the case where the additional wells are chosen to be at the same energy level as the wells directly coupled to the embedded wells , so called",
    "_ leveled out _ energies .",
    "for the six - mode model this implies @xmath143 where wells @xmath144 and @xmath145 are the embedded wells .",
    "all matrix elements are now fixed , solely the initial wave functions in wells @xmath62 and @xmath146 are arbitrary and thus the initial populations and currents to the adjacent wells . a somewhat naive approach to choose arbitrary values of the parameters of the initial wave function",
    "is a possibility , but this results in large oscillations between the reservoir wells , which is a valid , but not a suitable realization for an experiment .    .",
    "( ii ) the time that is available for realizing @xmath0 symmetry should be extended .",
    "on the one hand one can simply increase the initial number of particles in the reservoir wells .",
    "( iii ) on the other hand the six - mode model can be used to effectively enlarge the reservoir .",

    "( ii ) still with the four - mode model , for the second simulation the particle number in the reservoir wells is doubled to @xmath157 .",
    "( iii ) for the third scenario we use the six - mode model , where the onsite energies are chosen such that for the initial time we have @xmath158 , giving the same number of reservoir particles as in the second case .",
    "figure  [ fig : level - probs ] shows the time - dependent populations of the wells , where a non - interacting is simulated .",
    "the first two cases are analogous to the results of @xcite .",
    "for the six - mode model we see that the reservoir wells left of the embedded wells are emptying with a slower speed , which was expected , since both wells serve as a common reservoir .",
    "the wells to the right are filling analogously .",
    "the time that is available for realizing @xmath0-symmetry is the same for the last two cases , hence the six - mode model gives no advantage with respect to the time that is available . however , there are other advantages discussed in the following",
    ".    of further interest is the time - dependence of the matrix elements , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : level - elements ] .",
    "the tunneling elements show almost the same behavior for the cases  ( ii ) and  ( iii ) .",
    "the difference lies in the onsite energies . due to the smaller amount of particles per well for the six - mode model",
    "the magnitude of the onsite energies is smaller than in case  ( ii ) , as well as the rate of change .",
    "this could result in an easier experimental realization .    with more wells we now have a second possibility to enlarge the particle reservoir .",
    "besides putting more particles in the two outer wells of the four - mode model we can add more wells .",
    "the difference is the resulting onsite energies , which with this method can be brought into an experimentally accessible range .",
    "the second possibility for choosing the onsite energies is by requiring specific currents between the additional wells .",
    "of course , the choice of these target currents is free .",
    "a somewhat natural choice is to require that each of the reservoir wells should contribute equally to the @xmath0-symmetric currents . for our six - mode model",
    "this means that when wells @xmath159 and @xmath160 are the embedded wells , the current @xmath161 is given by the condition  , and for @xmath162 we require @xmath163 .",

    "[ sec : other - matr - elem ] .",
    "this leads to a scenario that is similar to that of leveling out the onsite energies , the difference is that now we can choose arbitrary initial conditions for the embedded wells and the phases of the reservoir wells can be calculated appropriately , thus extending the possibilities .",
    "when the reservoir wells to the left are emptying at the same speed , this can be unfavorable when one well has a lower initial population than the other : when this well gets empty , the simulation stops although there are particles in the left reservoir .",
    "this can be overcome by choosing the specific inter - well currents proportional to the initial population .",
    "suppose that @xmath106 and @xmath107 are given by conditions  .",

    "[ fig : energies](a ) ) by a negative slope of the linear energy part , and the wave packet is accelerated to the right . at the end of the adiabatic current ramp @xmath210 ,",
    "the slope is again close to zero , the acceleration stops and there is a constant current . when the wave packet now moves to the right ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lattice - wavefunction ] ) , the population in the reservoir well left of the embedded wells decreases .",
    "this is compensated by an increasing negative slope .",
    "when coming close to the end of the simulation time , the negative slope must increase and finally diverges to @xmath211 .",
    "the influence of the interaction strength can be understood by noticing that a repulsive interaction leads to a faster dispersion of the wave packet and hence a slightly larger negative slope is necessary .",
    "the opposite is true for an attractive interaction , for some time interval the slope even can get positive .",
    "the energy offset @xmath119 is zero at the beginning , and then must change to maintain @xmath0 symmetry .",

    "the initial gaussian wave packet is accelerated to the right due to the negative energy slope @xmath118 . at the same time the purely gaussian shape is perturbed due to the energy offset . in combination , these effects contribute to the realization of @xmath0-symmetry in the embedded wells @xmath201 and @xmath202 with a constant number of particles @xmath213 and @xmath214 .",
    "the dashed curves give the wave function of the semiclassical approximation , where the energy offset is ignored . ]",

    "the particles in the reservoir can not be completely used , which is the cost of this simple energy distribution .    ,",
    "but for the wave function in momentum space .",
    "the dashed line gives the wave function of the semiclassical approximation .",
    "the last row ( e)(f ) shows an enlarged plot of the previous row ( c)(d ) . in momentum space , the wave function is dominated by the sharp peak in @xmath131 , of which the time - dependence can be calculated according to the semiclassical approximation and which gives a good description for the dominating peak . only in the enlarged views ( e)(f )",
    "one notices the perturbation due to the energy offset .",
    "this perturbation is getting stronger during the simulation time , however , it does not reach the magnitude of the momentum peak . ]    of further interest is the fourier transform of the wave function that can be calculated according to @xmath215 figure  [ fig : lattice - wavefunction - k ] shows this fourier transform for a selection of different times . as to be expected , it is dominated by a sharp peak in @xmath125-space .",
    "this dominance does not vanish during simulation time and can be reasonably described by the semiclassical approximation .",
    "the position of this peak moves according to eq .  .",
    "the energy offset induces a perturbation , which is in particular visible near the end of the simulation time @xmath216 .",
    "note that its maximum magnitude is smaller than one percent of the momentum peak .",
    "we have developed the basic idea to realize a @xmath0-symmetric two - mode model by embedding this system into a larger hermitian system with in total at least four wells where the additional wells are considered as reservoir wells . in the limit of large number of wells",
    "@xmath0 symmetry is realized by a tilted optical lattice where the embedded double well is a necessary defect .",
    "the coupling of the embedded wells to the reservoir wells is due to the overlapping wave functions between adjacent wells .",
    "it has already been shown that the necessary potential can be created experimentally @xcite .",
    "the coupling of overlapping wave functions is experimentally accessible contrary to the methods used in @xcite , where a coupling is assumed without giving possible realizations of such a coupling and thus leaving some ambiguity . with our method",
    "we are thus able to give a realistic scenario for realizing @xmath0 symmetry where all parameters used in a possible experiment are determined .    for the theoretical investigations we used the matrix model developed in @xcite , where we concentrated on using the four - mode model .",
    "we applied all the theoretical results to calculate the dynamical evolution of the realizations of @xmath0 symmetry . due to a finite particle reservoir the time that is available for realizing @xmath0 symmetry is always limited .",
    "for a four - well system this time can be extended by filling more particles in the reservoir wells .",
    "however , a large difference between the number of particles in the embedded wells on one hand and the particle population in the embedded wells on the other hand can be a huge experimental challenge for both preparing such a state and measuring the particle numbers .",
    "furthermore , such a large difference can make the necessary matrix elements of the hamiltonian   extraordinarily large . for these reasons",
    ", we extended the model to more than two reservoir wells in this article , such that there are more possible realizations with an arbitrary number of reservoir wells .",
    "thus , we have a wealth of possible realization of @xmath0 symmetry , and an experimentalist can choose the system parameters such that they are in an accessible range .",
    "we analyzed a system with a large number of wells in the framework of optical lattices . in that sense , @xmath0 symmetry can be interpreted by a moving and accelerating wave packet that scatters at a defect of a tilted optical lattice , which leads to a realization of @xmath0 symmetry at that double well .",
    "many of the investigations of @xmath0-symmetric were performed in terms of the mean - field approximation .",
    "first extensions were made @xcite , and it could be possible to study a realization using the many - particle bose - hubbard model .",
    "the results from the matrix model in this work could then be used as a possible road map . due to the higher degrees of internal freedom",
