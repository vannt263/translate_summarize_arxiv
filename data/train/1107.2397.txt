    "at all but the most modest redshifts , the measurement of the velocity width of broad permitted lines ( e.g. h@xmath13 , mgii , civ ) from unobscured type-1 active galactic nuclei ( agn ) offers the only direct way to estimate the masses of super - massive black holes ( wandel , peterson & malkan 1999 ; kaspi et al .",

    "; willott et al .",
    "for this reason , determining the properties of agn host galaxies remains of crucial importance for exploring the relationship between black - hole and galaxy evolution over cosmic history , and in particular for testing alternative theories for the origin of the now well - established proportionality between black - hole and galaxy bulge mass found in the local / present - day universe ( kormendy & richstone 1995 ; magorrian et al .",

    "quasars , as the most extreme of agn , offer potentially the greatest challenge to theory , especially at high redshift where , for example , black holes with masses @xmath14 already appear to have been in place less than 1 billion years after the big bang ( fan et al .",
    "2001 , 2003 ; willott et al . 2007 ; mortlock et al . 2011 ) .",
    "however , extracting reliable information on the host galaxies of these overwhelmingly bright agn presents a formidable technical challenge .    at low redshift ( @xmath15 )",
    "this challenge was effectively met when the first refurbishment of the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) enabled optical imaging of the necessary depth _ and _ exquisite+stable angular resolution to allow the scalelengths and morphologies of low - redshift quasar hosts to be reliably determined for the first time ( e.g. disney et al . 1995 ; mclure et al . 1999 ; dunlop et al .",
    "2003 ; floyd et al .",
    "2004 ) . indeed ,",
    "the results of these deep _ hst _ optical imaging programs of quasar hosts , when combined with `` virial '' measurements of the black - hole masses in the same objects , were instrumental in demonstrating that these most active objects displayed the same black - hole : host - galaxy mass proportionality as found in quiescent galaxies ( mclure & dunlop 2002 ) .",
    "however , extending the effective study of quasar host galaxies out to higher redshifts , and in particular into the `` quasar epoch '' at @xmath16 , has proved to be extremely difficult .",
    "there are a number of reasons for this .",
    "first , there is the obvious cosmological dimming of the host - galaxy light .",
    "second there is the necessity of observing in the near - infrared , in order to continue to sample the rest - frame optical light of the host galaxy ( both for comparison with low - redshift studies , and to avoid the host - galaxy light being completely swamped by the uv - bright quasar ) .",
    "some success in detecting the hosts of quasars out to @xmath17 was achieved with the nicmos infrared camera on _ hst _ ( kukula et al .",
    "2001 , ridgway et al .",
    "2001 ; peng et al .",
    "2006b ) but , even with this high - resolution near - infrared imaging , obtaining reliable measurements of host - galaxy luminosities and scalelengths proved extremely difficult .",
    "we now know that this was almost certainly in part due to the fact that , in general , massive galaxies at high - redshift have since been discovered to be generally much more compact than their low - redshift counterparts ( daddi et al .",
    "2005 ; trujillo et al .",

    "if this is also true for quasar hosts , then the separation of galaxy and nuclear light in quasars at @xmath18 will inevitably be even more problematic than was perhaps first anticipated .",
    "nonetheless , these difficulties have not deterred several groups from attempting to repeat this experiment at redshifts as high as @xmath19 .",
    "such studies have been encouraged ( at least in part ) by the advent of active / adaptive optics on ground - based 8-m class telescopes , and by the fact that @xmath1 is the natural limit for ground - based studies of quasar host galaxies if one hopes to detect host - galaxy light longward of the 4000 / balmer break in the @xmath0-band .    however , perhaps unsurprisingly , existing studies of the host galaxies of quasars at @xmath1 have met with very limited success .",
    "for example , using _",
    "nicmos @xmath20-band data , peng et al .",
    "( 2006b ) attempted to measure the luminosities and sizes of the hosts of two gravitationally - lensed quasars at @xmath21 and @xmath22 via two - dimensional modelling .",
    "although reliable host - galaxy luminosities were claimed , the _ hst _ images sampled light shortward of @xmath23  and , in addition , the complexity of the lensing model led the authors to conclude that the extracted morphological parameters could not be trusted . in an alternative ground - based approach ,",
    "hutchings ( 2003 , 2005 ) observed seven quasars at @xmath24 with the gemini 8-m telescope in the @xmath25 , @xmath20 , and @xmath0-bands . using point - spread function ( psf ) subtraction ,",
    "host - galaxy luminosities were estimated from the psf - subtracted images , although no evidence of smooth centrally - concentrated host galaxies was found and , again , this time due to the decision to observe quasars at @xmath24 , this imaging sampled rest - frame wavelengths @xmath26 , limiting the usefulness of the extracted luminosities .",
    "most recently , mcleod & bechtold ( 2009 ) observed 34 @xmath1 quasars in the @xmath0-band with the magellan i and gemini north telescopes . however , despite the use of well - controlled psf subtraction , only four host galaxies were detected in their deepest and sharpest data , at an average quasar redshift @xmath27 .",
    "host - galaxy luminosity and size estimates were attempted from the psf - subtracted images of these 4 quasars , although the authors noted that the surface - brightness limit of these data was really of inadequate depth for the accurate recovery of host - galaxy sizes .",
    "the deepest imaging obtained by these authors ( @xmath28 hours per source on 8-m class telescopes ) would thus seem to represent a minimum requirement for the discovery and study of quasar host galaxies at @xmath1 .",
    "in this paper we present and analyse even deeper ( @xmath7 hours per source ) european southern observatory ( eso ) 8.2-m very large telescope ( vlt ) @xmath3-band imaging of two @xmath1 sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) quasars .",
    "these two quasars were carefully chosen to have a redshift which ensures line - free imaging of the host - galaxy stellar population at @xmath2 , and to have a star of comparable brightness within an angular radius of 40 arcsec , in order to provide a robust , high signal : noise ratio , on - detector representation of the vlt @xmath3-band psf over the complete duration of the host - galaxy imaging .",
    "this care in quasar target selection , combined with deliberate ( flexibly scheduled ) use of only the very best seeing conditions ( and the deliberate avoidance of adaptive optics ) , has enabled us to achieve robust detections of the host galaxies of both quasars , despite the fact that , with @xmath5 , these objects are representative of the most luminous / massive black holes in existence at this ( or indeed any ) epoch .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe our observing strategy , our target selection , and summarise the new near - infrared data obtained with the vlt .",
    "next , in section 3 we explain the psf subtraction technique used to separate host and nuclear light .",
    "then , in section 4 we describe the determination of host - galaxy properties and the estimation of the central black - hole masses .",
    "finally , in section 5 we attempt to place our results in the context of studies of other galaxy populations at both high and low redshift , and briefly explore the consequences of this study for the inferred cosmic evolution of the black hole - to - galaxy mass ratio . throughout",
    "we adopt a cosmology with @xmath29kms@xmath30mpc@xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 . unless otherwise noted , we report all magnitudes in the vega system to ease comparison with previous studies , but our @xmath3-band photometry can be simply converted to the ab magnitude system via @xmath33 .",
    "the deep @xmath3-band imaging presented here was performed with the 8.2-m vlt ( located on cerro paranal in the atacama desert , northern chile ) , using the infrared spectrometer and array camera ( isaac ) , a 1024 @xmath34 1024 hawaii rockwell array with a pixel scale of 0.15 arcsec .",
    "this pixel scale provided the necessary good sampling of even the very best seeing disc , while still providing sufficient field - of - view to include the required nearby field stars for accurate on - image psf characterisation .",
    "the reliable detection of host - galaxy light around luminous quasars is difficult at all redshifts , but especially at high redshift , due to the small angular size of any reasonable anticipated host galaxy , the faintness of any potential host galaxy relative to the scattered nuclear light in the wings of the psf , and the fact that the rest - frame optical light has been redshifted to the near - infrared .    predicting surface brightnesses ( and hence exposure times ) for high-@xmath35 quasar host galaxies is complicated by unknown amounts of stellar and morphological evolution to offset against the cosmological dimming and anticipated @xmath36-corrections . in an attempt to best define our observational strategy we generated synthetic vlt / isaac exposures of a @xmath37 quasar with a nuclear / host ratio of 15 , 0.6-arcsec seeing , and background - limited noise .",
    "the synthetic quasar had a total @xmath3-band apparent magnitude of @xmath38 ( consistent with the anticipated @xmath3-band magnitudes of our target sdss quasars ) , comprising a nuclear point source with @xmath39 and a de vaucouleurs host galaxy with @xmath40 ( consistent with existing studies of the @xmath41 relation for massive galaxies ) .",
    "for the simulated host galaxy we assumed a half - light radius of 5kpc .",
    "separate psfs were used to construct the synthetic quasar and to carry out nuclear / host separation , with both psfs obtained from the publicly - available isaac image of the goods - south field , on which they were @xmath42-arcsec apart ( thus accurately reflecting our observing strategy of using a nearby star to characterise the on - image psf ) . in order to separate host and nuclear components and reliably determine total luminosities for such galaxies",
    ", we found that we needed to follow the surface brightness profile out to @xmath43 galaxy half - light radii .",
    "this required integrating down to a @xmath44 surface brightness level of @xmath45magarcsec@xmath46 .",
    "the vlt isaac exposure time calculator indicated that we could achieve this level in @xmath47 hours on source , and so this was set as the minimum on - source exposure time for our observations .      for the reasons explained above , we wished to obtain emission - line free images of the most luminous quasars at @xmath1 .",
    "contamination of the observed @xmath0-band light by [ oiii ] and h@xmath13 line emission is avoided by insisting on @xmath48 , and so we aimed to select quasar targets at only slightly higher redshift to ensure that the @xmath3-band filter was still essentially filled by the continuum light starting at @xmath49 .",
    "we confined our attention to the most luminous quasars in the sdss quasar catalogue at these redshifts , corresponding to absolute magnitudes @xmath5 .",
    "these objects are rare ; the final sdss quasar catalogue contains only @xmath50 such quasars in the redshift range @xmath51 over the full @xmath52deg@xmath53 of the sdss quasar survey ( schneider et al .",
    "they thus have a comoving number density of @xmath54 per comoving gpc@xmath55 at @xmath1 , which corresponds to @xmath56 object in the cosmological volume simulated in the `` massive black '' simulation recently discussed by di matteo et al .",
    "( 2011 ) ( see section 5 ) .    finally , we further limited our observational options to quasars from within this sample which happened to have at least one bright star within a radius of 40 arcsec , in order to provide a high signal : noise ratio representation of the real form of the point - spread - function ( psf ) on the final science image .",
    "it was deemed essential that the nearby stars were at least as bright as the quasar at @xmath3-band , but not so bright as to risk saturation or non - linearity in the background limited imaging .",
    "this final rather stringent requirement reduced our potential target list to less than 10 quasars .",
    "our insistence on long ( @xmath57hr ) integrations in the very best seeing conditions meant that we only obtained the required deep imaging for two of the potential target quasars , but all data were taken in photometric conditions and consistent high - quality ( @xmath6-arcsec ) atmospheric seeing .",
    "our observations of these two @xmath1 quasars are summarised in table 1 .",

    "column 1 lists the target names .",

    "column 3 provides the measured 4-arcsec diameter aperture @xmath3-band magnitude ( vega ) for each quasar .",

    "2000 ) . under the assumption that the broad - line emitting gas is in virial motion within the central black hole s gravitational potential ,",
    "the central mass can be estimated via @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the radius of the broad - line region ( blr ) and @xmath60 is the orbital velocity of the line - emitting gas . in practice , @xmath59 is estimated via the correlation between optical luminosity and @xmath59 discovered from reverberation mapping of low - redshift agn ( kaspi et al .",
    "2000 ) , and the gas orbital velocity is taken to be the full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of one or more of the h@xmath13 , mgii or civ emission lines , depending on which lines are observable given the source redshift .    at @xmath61 , the civ line is the only one available within the sdss optical spectra , and can be used to estimate @xmath62 using the virial black - hole mass estimator from vestergaard & peterson ( 2006 ) :    @xmath63 + 6.66\\ ] ]    the results of this calculation for the two quasars considered here are given in table 4 .",
    "it should be noted that there is some concern when using high - ionisation lines as a proxy for blr rotational velocity , such as civ , which can be blueshifted with respect to lower - ionisation lines such as h@xmath13 and mgii , and often shows a strong blue excess asymmetry ( baskin & laor 2005 ) .",
    "this suggests that non - gravitational effects , such as obscuration and radiation pressure , may affect the line profile , and hence distort black - hole masses derived assuming a gravity dominated linewidth .",
    "baskin & laor ( 2005 ) analyse the h@xmath13 and civ lines for a sample of 81 pg quasars to conclude that civ is inferior to h@xmath13 for @xmath62 estimates .",
    "however , for civ lines wider than 4000kms@xmath30 such as the ones in this study , baskin & laor ( 2005 ) find that the virial bh mass estimator may actually be biased toward low bh estimates .",
    "any such bias would therefore reinforce the observed evolution discussed in section 5 .",
    "conversely , vestergaard ( 2009 ) reanalyse the baskin & laor ( 2005 ) data , and the civ line in a larger sample of agn , and conclude that civ is a robust measure blr rotational velocity .",
    "this result is confirmed in peng et al .",
    "( 2006b ) , who find no significant offset between h@xmath13 and civ linewidths in a sample of six @xmath64 quasars .",
    "although possibly inferior to h@xmath13 and mgii , as the only line available at @xmath65 it would seem both necessary and acceptable to utilise the civ line as a proxy for blr rotational velocity .",
    "in fig . 5 ( adapted from miley & de breuck 2008 following rocca - volmerange et al .",
    "2004 ) we attempt to illustrate how the @xmath3-band brightness of our two @xmath1 quasar host galaxies compares both with other estimates of quasar host - galaxy brightness at comparable redshift , and with the brightness of other well - studied populations of high - redshift galaxies . here",
    "it can be seen that our quasar hosts lie on the now well - established @xmath41 relation for powerful radio galaxies ( e.g. lilly & longair 1984 ; eales et al . 1997 ; van breugel et al .",
    "1998 ; de breuck et al . 2002 ) . as can be seen from fig . 5 , and as inferred from a series of deep near - infrared imaging studies of powerful radio galaxies ( e.g. dunlop & peacock 1993 ; best et al .",
    "1998 ; willott et al . 2003 ; targett et al . 2011 ) , the radio - galaxy @xmath41 relation essentially defines the high - mass envelope of the evolving galaxy population .",
    "regardless of their precise stellar masses , it is thus clear that , as perhaps expected , the host galaxies of the most luminous sdss quasars at @xmath1 are amongst the most massive known galaxies at this epoch . in addition , while we have argued that our data are of higher quality , and our results more robust than those derived from previous studies of quasar hosts at @xmath1 , our host galaxy luminosities are basically consistent with those derived by mcleod & bechtold ( 2009 ) , hutchings ( 2003 , 2005 ) and peng et al .",
    "( 2006b ) . as judged from the galaxy evolution models of rocca - volmerage et al .",
    "( 2004 ) over - plotted on fig .",
    "5 , it would seem that all of the @xmath1 quasar host galaxies uncovered to date have stellar masses in the range @xmath66 , which is entirely consistent with our own derived bounds on the possible stellar masses of our two quasar host galaxies as given in table 4 .",
    "our study is , however , the first to yield apparently robust values for the half - light radii of quasar host galaxies at such high redshifts . despite their large stellar masses , the derived half - light radii of the @xmath1 quasar hosts ( @xmath67kpc ) are clearly much smaller than those of either low - redshift quasar hosts ( @xmath68kpc ; dunlop et al .",
    "2003 ) or indeed the vast majority of present - day galaxies of comparable mass ( e.g. hyde & bernardi 2009 ) .",
    "however , our small derived values for @xmath69 seem broadly as expected given the rapidly growing observational evidence for the increasing compactness of massive galaxies with increasing redshift ( daddi et al .",
    "2005 ; trujillo et al .",
    "2006 , 2007 ; longhetti et al . 2007 ; zirm et al . 2007 ; cimatti et al . 2008 ; buitrago et al . 2008 ; van dokkum et al . 2008 ; targett et al .",
    "2011 ) and the expectations from recent simulations of galaxy growth ( e.g. oser et al . 2012 ) .",
    "our results are also consistent with the only existing indirect size estimates for several @xmath70 quasars based on lensed measurements of the molecular gas content ( riechers et al .",
    "2008a , b ; riechers et al .",
    "we conclude that , just as at low redshift , the properties of quasar host galaxies at @xmath1 seem broadly as expected for `` normal '' galaxies of comparable mass at that particular cosmological epoch .",
    "the derived black - hole masses given in table 4 are clearly very large , approaching @xmath71 for both quasars , and so it is worth pausing to consider whether such values are plausible / expected .",
    "our conclusion is that these masses , while high , are certainly not unreasonable given the relative rarity of these ultra - bright quasars , our understanding of quasar demographics , and the results of the latest high - redshift simulations .",
    "specifically , our target objects were selected from a parent sample which contains only 1 such luminous quasar in the redshift range @xmath51 per 50 deg@xmath53 on the sky , corresponding to a comoving source density of only @xmath72 .",
    "these are thus extreme objects , arguably the natural descendents of the most extreme quasars found at @xmath73 , which already appear to have black - hole masses @xmath74 ( willott , mclure & jarvis 2003 ; mortlock et al .",
    "only 60 million years of further eddington - limited growth would be required to boost these black - hole masses by a further factor of 4 , to values consistent with those derived here 800 million years later .",
    "this viewpoint receives some further theoretical support from recent simulations of black - hole growth in the young universe , such as the `` massive black '' simulation of di matteo et al .",
    "the luminous quasars targeted here are sufficiently rare that , on average , only one would be expected in the @xmath75 comoving volume followed in this simulation , and di matteo et al .",
    "report that the most massive black hole in their simulation has already achieved a mass of @xmath76 by @xmath24 . by this point feedback and shock heating of infalling gas",
    "are inferred to limit further growth , but clearly the concept that such rare black holes may achieve masses approaching @xmath71 by @xmath1 is consistent with current observational and theoretical constraints .",
    "finally , we can combine our estimates of black - hole mass and galaxy stellar mass to infer the black hole - to - galaxy mass ratio for our @xmath1 quasars .",
    "the averaged value of @xmath77 is shown in fig .",
    "6 , where we plot two @xmath61 data points to indicate the different values which arise from adoption of either the maximum or minimum possible galaxy stellar masses ( as derived assuming a formation redshift of @xmath78 or @xmath79 respectively ) .",

    "however , note that in this case the host - galaxy mass refers not to a stellar mass inferred from the sort of host - galaxy imaging attempted here , but is a dynamical mass inferred from very large array measurements of molecular gas in the quasar host galaxy by walter et al .",

    "our results imply a black - hole : host - galaxy mass ratio ( @xmath11 ) which appears to be a factor of @xmath68 higher than typically seen in the low - redshift universe .",
    "6 demonstrates that this is consistent with the growing body of evidence for a systematic growth in this mass ratio with increasing redshift , at least for objects selected as powerful active galactic nuclei ( decarli et al .",
    "2010 , and references therein ) .",
    "indeed , an order of magnitude increase in @xmath77 is exactly as anticipated given the redshift dependence of @xmath87 inferred from recent studies of x - ray selected agn ( bennert et al .",
    "2011 ) , and recent numerical simulations of galaxy and black hole growth ( e.g. shankar et al .",
    "2011 , power et al . 2011 ) .    the observed evolution in the black - hole : host galaxy mass ratio shown in fig . 6 , although consistent with numerous results in the literature , could be subject to various selection effects .",
    "the necessity of using black - hole masses derived from the velocity width of broad permitted lines limits candidate objects to luminous rapidly - accreting unobscured type-1 active galactic nuclei , which implies that results will necessarily be biased from the true distribution of a volume - limited sample ( e.g. lauer et al . 2007 ) .",
    "for example , the low @xmath77 estimated for submillimetre selected galaxies at @xmath88 ( borys et al .",
    "2005 ) could imply a large scatter in the relationship at high redshift not sampled by quasars .",
    "however , the agreement between our results and other studies using both quasars and radio galaxies indicates that , at least for the most massive galaxies , the growth of the central supermassive black hole may be completed before that of the host spheroid .",
    "we have obtained and analysed the deepest , high - quality @xmath3-band images ever obtained of luminous quasars at @xmath1 , in an attempt to determine the basic properties of their host galaxies less than 1 gyr after the first recorded appearance of black holes with @xmath89 . to maximise the robustness of our results , we carefully selected two sdss quasars at @xmath1 . with absolute magnitudes @xmath5 , these quasars are representative of the most luminous quasars known at this epoch but they also , crucially , lie within 40 arcsec of comparably - bright foreground stars ( required for accurate point - spread - function definition ) , and have redshifts which ensure line - free @xmath3-band imaging .",
    "our new data were obtained in excellent seeing conditions ( @xmath6-arcsec ) with isaac on the eso vlt , with integration times of @xmath7 hours per source . via carefully - controlled separation of host - galaxy and nuclear light , followed by two - dimensional galaxy model - fitting",

    "we find that the @xmath3-band magnitudes of the quasar host galaxies are consistent with those of luminous radio galaxies at comparable redshifts .",

    "<S> deep @xmath0-band imaging of the most luminous @xmath1 quasars currently offers the earliest possible view of the mass - dominant stellar populations of the host galaxies which house the first super - massive black holes in the universe . </S>",
    "<S> this is because , until the advent of the james webb space telescope , it is not possible to obtain the necessary deep , sub - arcsec resolution imaging at rest - frame wavelengths @xmath2  at any higher redshift . </S>",
    "<S> we here present and analyse the deepest , high - quality @xmath3-band images ever obtained of luminous quasars at @xmath1 , in an attempt to determine the basic properties of their host galaxies less than 1 gyr after the first recorded appearance of black holes with @xmath4 . to maximise the robustness of our results we have carefully selected two sloan digital sky survey quasars at @xmath1 . with absolute magnitudes @xmath5 , these quasars are representative of the most luminous quasars known at this epoch but they also , crucially , lie within 40 arcsec of comparably - bright foreground stars ( required for accurate point - spread - function definition ) , and have redshifts which ensure line - free @xmath3-band imaging . </S>",
    "<S> the data were obtained in excellent seeing conditions ( @xmath6-arcsec ) at the european southern observatory on the very large telescope with integration times of @xmath7 hours per source . via carefully - controlled separation of host - galaxy and nuclear light </S>",
    "<S> , we estimate the luminosities and stellar masses of the host galaxies , and set constraints on their half - light radii . </S>",
    "<S> the apparent @xmath3-band magnitudes of the quasar host galaxies are consistent with those of luminous radio galaxies at comparable redshifts , suggesting that these quasar hosts are also among the most massive galaxies in existence at this epoch . however , the quasar hosts are a factor @xmath8 smaller ( @xmath9 ) than the host galaxies of luminous low - redshift quasars . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the stellar masses of the @xmath1 host galaxies to lie in the range @xmath10 , and use the civ emission line in the sloan optical spectra to estimate the masses of their central supermassive black holes . </S>",
    "<S> the results imply a black - hole : host - galaxy mass ratio @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> this is an order of magnitude higher than typically seen in the low - redshift universe , and is consistent with existing evidence for a systematic growth in this mass ratio with increasing redshift ( i.e. @xmath12 ) , at least for objects selected as powerful active galactic nuclei .    </S>",
