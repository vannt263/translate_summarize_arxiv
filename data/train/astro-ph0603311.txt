    "modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) was proposed by milgrom @xcite-@xcite asserting that gravitational field requires modifications when the gravitational field strength @xmath1 is weaker than a critical value @xmath0 .",
    "this has been shown to be a good candidate as an alternative to cosmic dark matter ( sanders 2001 ) .",
    "the phenomenological foundations for mond are based on two observational facts : ( 1 ) flat asymptotic rotation curve , ( 2 ) the successful tully - fisher @xcite law , @xmath2 for the relation between rotation velocity and luminosity observed in many spiral galaxies .",
    "here @xmath3 is close to 4 .",
    "it was pointed out @xcite-@xcite that there exists a critical acceleration parameter @xmath4 characterizing the turning point of the effective power law associated with the gravitational field in mond .",
    "gravitational field of the following form was suggested @xmath5 with a function @xmath6 considered as a modified inertial . here",
    "@xmath1 is the newtonian gravitational field produced by certain mass distribution .",
    "milgrom suggests that @xmath7 and shows that it provides a best fit with many existing observation data including the rotational curve of many spiral galaxies .",
    "recently it was shown that a simpler inertial function of the following form @xcite @xmath8 fits better with rc data of milky way and ngc3198 .",
    "evidences accumulated @xcite-@xcite show that the theory of mond is telling us a very important message .",
    "either the newtonian force laws do require modification in the weak field limit or the theory of mond may just represent some collective effect of the cosmic dark matter . in both cases ,",
    "the theory of mond deserves more attention in order to reveal the complete physics underlying these successful fitting results .",
    "there is , however , a known problem with the momentum conservation law associated with the theory of mond .",
    "one finds that the conservation of momentum , a result of the action - reaction principle , can be resolved with the existence of an extra dimensional space .",
    "one will also be able to show that the proposed critical acceleration @xmath9 might be closely related to the existence of an extra dimensional space . here",
    "@xmath10 is the current hubble constant .",
    "in fact , one will show that a spring - like extra dimensional space with squeezable thickness can not only absorb the missing piece of momentum but also provide a natural accommodation of the expanding universe in a consistent way .",
    "assuming that there exists an extra dimension space with a squeezable thickness @xmath11 related to the induced field strength @xmath12 and the inertial mass @xmath13 of the associated test particle .",
    "5-space and 4-space will denote the five - dimensional space time and four - dimensional space time respectively .",
    "in addition , 3-space , the hyper surface of the four dimensional spatial space ( or the 4d bulk space ) , will denote the conventional three spatial geometry where newtonian dynamics holds when @xmath14 .",
    "moreover , @xmath15-space will also be denoted as the extra fifth dimensional space and @xmath16-space will denote the 4d bulk space without its 3-space hyper surface .    for simplicity , one will write the four dimensional spatial geometry as a two - dimensional @xmath17 strip with the @xmath18-coordinate as an abbreviate for the conventional @xmath19 3-space .",
    "@xcite for example , each point on the @xmath18-line represents a two - dimensional surface .",
    "@xmath15-membrane will also denote the 4d bulk space without its 3-space hyper surface .",
    "three assumptions on the properties of the space will be proposed : ( 1 ) one has assumed that the @xmath15-space has a squeezable thickness @xmath20 related to the interaction with the gravitational field @xmath12 . in the presence of a strong field @xmath1 , it is assumed to have a standard thickness @xmath21 .",
    "( 2 ) one will further assume that the thickness @xmath11 also has to do with the existence of inertial mass @xmath13 of the test particle .",
    "in particular , one will assume that there is also a @xmath15-space mass @xmath22 at the same point @xmath18 associated with the existence of any particle with 3-space mass @xmath13 .",
    "one assumes that the @xmath15-space mass @xmath23 only acts in the @xmath16-space and is also proportional to 3-space mass @xmath13 in the strong field limit . without losing any generality ,",
    "one sets @xmath24 in the strong field limit .",
    "( 3 ) finally , one assumes that the @xmath15-space mass density @xmath25 remains constant for all @xmath18 throughout the @xmath16-space .    here",
    "is how the idea works : once the field strength @xmath1 goes weak , when mond effect is apparent , the thickness of the extra dimension will be squeezed appreciably in response to the decreasing of @xmath1 acting on the 3-space world . as a result ,",
    "part of its tensional force ( or @xmath23 ) in the @xmath16-space is released to the 3-space world such that the third law of newtonian dynamics is preserved in 5-space .    to be more specific",
    ", one will show how this could be working closely with the real world in a consistent way by studying the simple model proposed by famaey and binney @xcite .",
    "any different models can also be shown to give similar results with some necessary modification in the intermediate field strength region where the strength of @xmath1 is close to the critical value @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , one can show that the mond field strength @xmath12 is @xmath26 when the newtonian field strength produced by a source @xmath27 with a 3-space mass @xmath27 .",
    "let us assume that @xmath27 is a point mass such that @xmath28 for simplicity for the moment .",
    "generalization to any mass distribution is straightforward .",
    "the force @xmath29 acting on the particle @xmath13 at a distance @xmath30 to @xmath27 is @xmath31 . on the other hand",
    ", the test particle @xmath13 will also produce a newtonian field strength @xmath32 at the location of the particle @xmath27 .",
    "it is known that @xmath13 will produce a force @xmath33 on @xmath27 .",
    "note that one has @xmath28 and @xmath34 acting in the 3-space world .",
    "it is apparent that the newton s third law of dynamics @xmath35 fails to be observed if the theory of mond is the whole story . here",
    "@xmath12 and @xmath36 represent the mond field strength acting at @xmath13 and @xmath27 respectively .",
    "there have been many stimulating research activities @xcite-@xcite trying to find a covariant field theory that is capable of resolving this problem . instead of these approaches",
    ", we will try a simpler approach .",
    "indeed , one possible resolution to this dilemma is to assume that the third law of the newtonian dynamics is still obeyed in the 5-dimensional space by assuming that part of the 3-space force @xmath29 goes into the extra @xmath15-dimension .",
    "this can be done by assuming @xmath37 throughout the 5-space .",
    "if this is true , the total 5-dimensional force @xmath38 will automatically follow the newton s third law .",
    "assume that the @xmath15-force @xmath39 is a repelling force directing outward from the source @xmath27 and @xmath40 is pointing inward representing an attracting force .",
    "note that these directions are all perpendicular to the normal direction of the 3-space hyper surface , i.e. outward and inward directions do not have any projection in the @xmath15-direction .",
    "one can show that the magnitude of @xmath39 is that @xmath41 note that we have assumed that : 1 ) @xmath29 only acts on the 3-space world responsible for the dynamical motion of the particle with inertial mass @xmath13 moving in the 3-space world .",
    "2 ) similarly , the force @xmath42 only acts on the @xmath16-space with inertial mass @xmath23 responsible for the expansion or contraction of the @xmath17-membrane .",
    "@xmath42 is supposed to do nothing directly on the particle s inertial mass @xmath13 on the 3-space world .",
    "writing @xmath43 , with @xmath44 as a parameter of acceleration , one can show that @xmath45 it is straightforward to show that @xmath46 therefore , one finds that the critical parameter @xmath0 shows up naturally as a physical parameter of the bulk acceleration acting on the @xmath17-membrane .",
    "assumption ( 4 ) : in addition to the first three properties of the bulk geometry assumed earlier in this letter , one will also assume that the bulk @xmath17-space is acting as a spring - like membrane with a small thickness @xmath21 when the field strength @xmath14",
    ". the thickness @xmath20 of the the @xmath15-space will be squeezed in response to the change of the field strength @xmath12 such that @xmath47 is observed for all @xmath18 in the 3-space world .",
    "note that one has assumed that @xmath22 is the total bulk mass of the membrane segment associated with the presence of the point mass @xmath13 at @xmath18 .",
    "one has also assumed that @xmath48 is proportional to the thickness of the the @xmath15-space such that @xmath49 , up to some proportional constant set as 1 , in the strong @xmath1 limit .",
    "therefore , one can show that @xmath50 such that @xmath51 is strictly obeyed . in another word , the whole @xmath16-space membrane is experiencing a constance acceleration @xmath0 everywhere outward from the source @xmath27 at @xmath52 .",
    "similarly , point mass @xmath27 will also see a constant acceleration @xmath0 outward from the source @xmath13 at @xmath18 .",
    "precisely , each particle of the system sees a @xmath16-space acceleration @xmath0 repelling each other .    in fig .",
    "1 , thin line represents the function @xmath53 with @xmath12 and @xmath1 both written in unit of @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , thick line represents the function @xmath54 with @xmath11 and @xmath1 written in unit of @xmath55 and @xmath0 respectively .",
    "in fact , the thick line @xmath56 in this set of unit .        one has to assume that the bulk - space acts like a spring pulling against the repelling bulk forces and holds the space time from accelerating far apart .",
    "the spring tension acts in response to the repelling force in a consistent way such that the total force acting on the @xmath15-membrane is cancelled or close to nothing .",
    "the resulting universe is therefore seen to only undergo a constant expansion or a mild accelerating expansion accordingly .",
    "this situation is rather similar to an incompressible pressurized fluid in a closed container that has constant pressure everywhere .",
    "since the accelerating parameter @xmath0 associated with the @xmath15-space has to do with the expansion of the universe , it should be closely related to the unique physical parameter of the expanding universe : the hubble constant @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , it is nature to expect @xmath9 based on dimensional argument .",
    "even one does not know how to relate this relation formally in a rigorous way .",
    "this question may also be related to the question we did not answer in this letter : why the thickness @xmath20 of the @xmath15-space takes the form given by eq .",
    "( 9 ) or any other form prescribed by a different alternative model .",
    "our result only shows that the law of momentum conservation can be secure in a consistent way with the help of the proposed fifth dimensional bulk space with finite thickness .",
    "hopefully , in light of the consistent setup shown in this letter , one will soon be able to find a more rigorous way to derive these relations from a formal field theoretical approach in the near future .",
    "one has made totally four assumptions on the properties of the bulk @xmath15-space : ( 1 ) it has a finite thickness @xmath20 , ( 2 ) it has an inertial mass @xmath22 in response to the force @xmath42 acting on the bulk space , ( 3 ) bulk mass density @xmath57 constant throughout the bulk space , ( 4 ) the force acting on the @xmath16-space @xmath47 tends to be acting on an `` incompressible '' fluid such that particle far apart tends to accelerate outward against each other with a constant acceleration @xmath0 .    as a result ,",
    "one derives the dependence of @xmath20 shown in eq .",
    "it indicates that part of the effect of the mass @xmath23 in the @xmath16-space is released to the 3-space world in compensation as a deformation of the inertial @xmath58 acting on the 3-space world .",
    "all forces adding together are therefore managed to obey the third law of newtonian dynamics .",
    "the first three assumptions are quite reasonable assumptions one can imagine for a well behaved membrane .",
    "the forth assumption asserts that the membrane tends to distribute forces acting on it equally such that constant acceleration is achieved everywhere on the bulk space .",
    "for example , two distinct galaxies tend to expand or accelerate outward from each other .",
    "this property is similar to the equal pressure acting on an ideal fluid enclosed in a closed container .",
    "therefore , the forth assumption is also a reasonable one .    the result shown",
    "here with a simple toy model indicates that the theory of mond might have to do with the input from the extra dimensional space .",
    "the expansion of the bulk space ( along the 3-space direction @xmath18 ) is achieved as a bonus of the toy model .",
    "assumptions made on the properties of the extra dimensional space are considered to be reasonable ones .",
    "therefore , it appears that the somewhat successful theory of mond does have close relation to the effect from the extra dimension .",
    "one can not rule out the possibility that the theory of mond is merely a collective effect of the cosmic dark matter working closely following the models proposed by milgrom , famaey & binney , and many others . in any case , the theory of mond deserves more attention for a more clear physical picture of the galaxy dynamics .",
