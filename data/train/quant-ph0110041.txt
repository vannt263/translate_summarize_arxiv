    "logic operations for quantum computation ( qc ) between two or more quantum bits ( qubits ) have so far been experimentally demonstrated in liquid - state nmr @xcite , trapped ions @xcite , and cavity quantum electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "recently , time - frequency resolved coherent anti - stokes raman scattering ( tfrcars ) in the molecular ro - vibronic hilbert space , was proposed as an alternative approach @xcite . through measurements on room temperature iodine vapor , it was demonstrated that the elements sufficient for executing universal quantum logic , namely , the single qubit rotations and the two - qubit controlled - not gate , are naturally contained in tfrcars . here , we give an illustrative example of how such elements can be combined into a useful algorithm .",
    "we show how a tfrcars _ interference _ experiment can use the molecular vibrational level structure to solve the deutsch - jozsa ( dj ) problem @xcite .",
    "the dj problem has become a benchmark for demonstrations of algorithms on prototypes of quantum computers ; having so far been used in nmr @xcite , linear optics @xcite , ro - vibrational molecular wavepackets in a pump - probe experiment @xcite , and excitons in semiconductor quantum dots @xcite .",
    "tfrcars is a four - wave mixing experiment in which a sequence of three non - collinear , short laser pulses ( labeled p , s and p ) are used to resonantly prepare and manipulate molecular ro - vibronic coherences .",
    "the p - pulse acts on a statistical state to prepare the first - order polarization @xmath0 where @xmath1 represents the rotational , vibrational and electronic quantum indices @xmath2 .",
    "the s and p pulses then allow manipulation of the coherence through stimulated transitions to sequentially prepare second- and third - order coherences , consisting of complex superpositions determined by the radiation field .",
    "transform - limited interrogation of the evolving third - order coherence can then be accomplished through the projective measurement of gated detection of the spectrally dispersed third - order polarization , @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "energy and momentum conservation conditions , enforced through spectral and spatial filtering of @xmath3 , allow its detection without any interference from the incoherent background .",
    "the process can be mapped out as logic operations on the molecular register of eigenstates , by identifying the p pulse as initialize , s and p pulses as process , and the gate pulse as readout .",
    "the approach has several attractive features with regard to qc .",
    "since transitions involve electronic resonances , they can be carried out on fs time scales . a very large ratio of coherence to process time @xmath4 is afforded , even when we allow for decoherence to be determined by the non - fundamental limit of inhomogeneous translational distribution ( doppler broadening ) at room temperature .",
    "unlike nmr , which aims to manipulate effective pure states , in tfrcars the signal is only from the polarized sub - ensemble @xcite .",
    "very large superpositions , @xmath5 ro - vibrational eigenstates , can be manipulated with precision . finally ,",
    "since the signal consists of a coherent radiation beam , information can be transferred effectively and can be used to cascade operations .",
    "small scale cars - qc experiments , using several qubits , are currently being set up at irvine .",
    "the limited number of qubits and process steps in the presently conceived algorithms , suggest applications in quantum communication @xcite , and simple quantum information processing tasks , such as quantum privacy amplification and cryptography @xcite .",
    "even the simplest of propositions in quantum control of molecules @xcite must contend with complications inherent in molecular state structures , such as vibrational level structures imposed by anharmonicity of electronic potential energy surfaces .",
    "as such , principles of optimal control @xcite will invariably be required in devising pulse shapes tailored for various implementations @xcite .",
    "we highlight these considerations , by using realistic molecular parameters , intuitively obvious pulse shapes , and a clear computational task of solving the dj problem .",
    "finally , we note that in the short time after suggesting the mapping of 4-wave mixing onto qc @xcite , there have been demonstrations of the general approach by other groups as well @xcite .",
    "the dj algorithm is one of the first examples of a quantum algorithm exhibiting a speedup compared to classical computers .",
    "the algorithm solves the following problem : `` there is a finite set @xmath6 where @xmath7 is even , and an unspecified function @xmath8 that is promised to be either constant [ @xmath9 or @xmath10 @xmath11 or balanced [ @xmath9 on exactly half the inputs ] .",
    "decide with certainty whether @xmath12 is constant or balanced in the least number of evaluations of @xmath12 . ''",
    "the dj algorithm has been extensively analyzed @xcite .",
    "we now describe an alternative algorithm for solving the dj  problem , one that is optimized for an interference experiment .",
    "let @xmath13 be an @xmath7-dimensional hilbert - space , where @xmath14 .",
    "define a basis in @xmath13 in one - to - one correspondence with the elements @xmath15 : @xmath16 .    1 .",
    "prepare the equal coherent superposition @xmath17 .",
    "2 .   define an operator @xmath18 by its action on the basis elements as : @xmath19 . then : @xmath20 .",
    "3 .   make a projective measurement on @xmath21 .",
    "the output ( the signal ) becomes : @xmath22 since @xmath23 is either @xmath24 or @xmath10 , the terms in the sum are @xmath25 or @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "it is clear that for @xmath12 balanced , the sum contains an equal number of positive and negative terms .",
    "the signal in this case is zero . for constant @xmath12 ,",
    "all the terms have the same sign , so the absolute value of the signal becomes maximal .",
    "the signal therefore distinguishes the two types of functions and hence this modified algorithm performs the same task as the standard algorithm @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it too does so using just one @xmath12-evaluation .",
    "we now propose a concrete experiment on iodine ( i@xmath27 ) vapor to perform our alternative dj algorithm .",
    "we illustrate the proposal through numerical simulations using accurately known molecular parameters .",
    "vibrational levels represent the basis states @xmath28 of @xmath29 .",
    "1 shows the iodine potentials for the ground ( @xmath30 ) and excited ( @xmath31 ) electronic states .",
    "we choose pulse widths and processing times @xmath32  1  ps , on which time scale the evolution of molecular rotations can be ignored , and therefore , we need only to be concerned with the vibrational levels on each potential .",
    "the cars process is illustrated in fig .  1 through the relevant time - circuit diagram ( feynman diagram in inset ) .",
    "initially the molecule is in its ground electronic state  @xmath33 , where the first ( second ) index denotes electronic ( vibrational ) quantum numbers .",
    "the p ( pump ) pulse induces the transition @xmath34 . a short enough p - pulse is chosen to prepare the desired number of @xmath35-states with comparable amplitude .",
    "this step is the preparation of the equal coherent superposition state @xmath29 .    after a delay of an integer multiple of the vibrational period on the b state ,",
    "the s ( stokes ) pulse arrives to induce the transition @xmath36 .",
    "the delay is kept short ( once or twice the vibrational period of the b state ) , so the s pulse acts on the same superposition as that prepared by the p - pulse .",
    "otherwise , the s - pulse must be shaped to compensate for dispersion of the vibrational packet due to the anharmonicity of the b - state .",
    "the s pulse is designed to encode the function @xmath12 .",
    "this is done by phase - shifting its spectral components ( colors ) , corresponding to the @xmath37 transitions ( or @xmath38 ) , using a phase - mask .",
    "we need only consider @xmath24 shifts and @xmath39 shifts here , i.e. , the mask element multiplies the spectral component @xmath38 of the pulse by @xmath40 . a mask with a specific sequence of phase factors @xmath41 is therefore in one - to - one correspondence with a function @xmath12 .",
    "note , the s pulse provides a many - to - one mapping of the b - state vibrations on the x - state vibrations , and generates a broad coherent superposition @xmath42 .",
    "however , only the @xmath43 coherence carries the processed phase information .",
    "this step corresponds to the application of @xmath18 , i.e. , the computation of @xmath44 .",
    "the amplitude transferred to the @xmath45 coherence is measured by applying the p(probe ) pulse , and then collecting the time - integrated spectrally dispersed anti - stokes radiation over a pre - selected transition .",
    "for the p pulse which induces the @xmath46 transition , it is sufficient to select pulse characteristics that provide a one - to - one map of vibrational levels . thus , for p centered on the @xmath47 transition , as long as the spectral width of the pulse is narrower than the vibrational spacing near @xmath48  =  22 of 85  @xmath49 ( therefore a p pulsewidth longer than 0.7 ps ) , we are guaranteed the unique projection @xmath47 .",
    "the desired signal is therefore obtained by dispersing the anti - stokes radiation through a monochromator to detect the spectral amplitude on the @xmath50 transition .",
    "it is useful to note here that by limiting the detection window at the rotational band origin , where rotational recursions occur on a timescale @xmath51  10  ps , it is possible to eliminate all potential interferences from rotational evolution .",
    "let us summarize the scheme :    \\1 ) preparation : the p pulse prepares the equal coherent superposition .",
    "\\2 ) computation : the phase - masked s pulse performs the @xmath18 operation .",
    "\\3 ) measurement : the @xmath45 coherence is measured as the time integrated spectrally - dispersed cars signal on the @xmath50 transition , after application of the vibrationally selective probe pulse .",
    "this signal is proportional to the absolute value of the coherence @xmath52 .",
    "the output characterizes @xmath12 .",
    "we require an @xmath53 transition scheme with the following properties : a ) for the general dj algorithm @xmath35 should assume @xmath7 values . here",
    "we consider for definiteness the case of @xmath54 ( equivalent to two and three qubits ) .",
    "b ) the franck - condon ( fc ) overlap between @xmath30 and @xmath31 should be as large as possible and roughly constant for all ( @xmath55 ) and ( @xmath56 ) pairs , in order to maximize the efficiency of coherent transfer by the pulses .",
    "c ) by choosing a large frequency shift between the p and s pulses it is guaranteed that the single time - circuit diagram of fig .",
    "1 describes the cars process .",
    "the following values satisfy the above criteria : @xmath57 ; @xmath58 for @xmath59 , and @xmath60 for @xmath61 .",
    "the product of fc  factors characterizes the overall strength of the @xmath62 , which motivates our choice of the @xmath35 values . in fig .  2 , we show the chosen pulse - shapes for p and s in the frequency domain for @xmath59 .",
    "p is broad , covering @xmath63 .",
    "s is red - shifted , and phase - masked . fig .",
    "2 shows the effect of the @xmath64 mask , corresponding to a balanced function  @xmath12 . both the p pulse , and the s pulse before masking have durations of @xmath65 fs .",
    "the p pulse which must provide vibrational selectivity , is the same color as s but its duration is taken to be 1  ps .",
    "we use morse functions for the @xmath30 and @xmath31 electronic potentials with parameters @xmath66=12550 @xmath49 , @xmath67=2.666  , @xmath68=1.858@xmath69 , @xmath70=4500 @xmath49 , @xmath71=3.016  , @xmath72=1.850@xmath69 , the energy difference between the minima of the potentials is 15647 @xmath49 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "we calculate the vibrational eigenfunctions on both surfaces using the sinc - dvr method , and obtain the fc factors @xcite .",
    "the time - evolution is explicitly integrated using the energy - representation .",
    "time - ordering of the p and s pulses was not enforced : contributions from ( p , s ) and ( s , p ) sequences were added coherently .",
    "only the liouville pathway depicted in fig .",
    "1 was taken into account .",
    "no decoherence mechanism was included ( decoherence , which occurs with @xmath73 , can be neglected on the execution time - scale of 1 - 2 ps ) . after the application of the two pulses , the prepared @xmath74 and oscillates with the @xmath75 beat - frequency . by explicit calculation of the time - integrated cars spectrum , using the perturbative evaluation of @xmath76 as described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , we verify that the experimentally observable @xmath50 spectral component is proportional to @xmath77 . in what follows",
    "we simply consider @xmath77 as the signal .",
    "the signal @xmath78 as a function of delay - time @xmath79 between the p and s pulses was computed for all @xmath80 different phase - masks ( i.e. , for all possible different encoded @xmath12 functions , including those that are neither constant nor balanced ) .",
    "3 shows the @xmath59 signals as functions of the delay time between the p and s pulses for a constant and a balanced function . for the constant function ( left ) the signal is large at integer multiples of the ( @xmath31 ) period , while the signal is close to zero for the balanced function ( right ) .",
    "this is therefore a clear experimental signature that distinguishes constant from balanced functions .",
    "notice , however , that the signal from the balanced function is not exactly zero . in fig .",
    "4a , we show the signal @xmath81 for all @xmath82 different encoded @xmath12 functions _ vs. _",
    "@xmath83 [ eq .  ( [ eq : sn ] ) ] ( only @xmath84 points are actually shown , since the signal is symmetric in @xmath85 ) . for balanced functions @xmath86 ,",
    "so they should yield zero signal .",
    "for the two constant functions @xmath87 , so they should give maximal signal .",
    "for the other functions @xmath88 , so they should give half the signal amplitude .",
    "in reality , as expected from fig .  3 , there is a spread along the signal axis , indicating that not all balanced functions yield exactly zero signal .",
    "4b shows the results for @xmath61 case . here",
    "the spread of signals corresponding to the same class of functions is significantly larger , thus reducing the fidelity of distinguishing constant from balanced functions .",
    "it is useful to introduce a formal fidelity measure in order to quantify the performance of the algorithm .",
    "perhaps the simplest measure is the distinguishability @xmath89 , which we define as the ratio of signal strengths    @xmath90    where the maximum is taken over all balanced signals .",
    "in the ideal case all @xmath91 so @xmath92 . a second measure is the pearson s correlation coefficient @xmath93 for a straight line interpolation between the signal @xmath94 and @xmath95 , which also accounts for the spread in the other ( neither constant nor balanced )  functions .",
    "this measure is important in case one decides to use our algorithm to also distinguish these other functions . in table  1",
    "we present these fidelities for different @xmath7 values and for different delay times .",
    "the reasons leading to a degradation in fidelity are the following : i ) non - uniform fc factors , causing different @xmath96 and s pulses .",
    "ii ) spectral breadth of the laser - pulses , with the same consequence as i ) .",
    "these effects lead to non - uniformity in the prepared and projected coherent superpositions , thus misrepresenting @xmath29 and @xmath97 somewhat .",
    "iii ) anharmonicity of the @xmath98 potential , leading to wavepacket dispersion on both the @xmath30 and @xmath31 potentials .",
    "in order to explore these effects , we performed simulations for the @xmath61 case , where all fc factors were artificially set equal ( a pulse achieving this effect can in principle be shaped by amplitude masking ) , and the p pulse was spectrally broadened , by reducing its duration to @xmath99 fs .",
    "we refer to this as the `` tailored '' case .",
    "the results are presented in fig .  4c , and the improvement in distinguishability is remarkable .",
    "this convincingly demonstrates the role of the non - uniform superposition in fidelity degradation .",
    "the solution , a spectrally broader p pulse together with tailoring the _ amplitudes _ of the p and s pulses to compensate for the non - uniformity of the fc factors , greatly improves the fidelity of the algorithm . to test the role of anharmonicity we also performed simulations at delays @xmath100",
    "obviously , at zero delay anharmonicity can not play a role . on the other hand anharmonicity",
    "should be more significant at @xmath101 than at @xmath102 .",
    "these expectations are confirmed in table 1 : a significant improvement in fidelity is seen when comparing the bare @xmath61 results to the tailored results , but only for @xmath103 . in contrast , for @xmath104 the fidelity remains low .",
    "the degradation for large @xmath7 values at large delay should be attributed to wavepacket dispersion due to anharmonicity .",
    "the simple solution is to apply the s pulse at @xmath105 or @xmath106 .",
    "the choice @xmath102 is actually preferable since interference from the time - reversed ( s , p ) sequence at @xmath107 , as well as higher order processes ( 6-wave mixing etc . )",
    "not accounted for in our simulations , lead to smaller signal strength .",
    "optimization of the _ phases _ of the s and p pulses ( chirping ) is another option that can be used for compensating for anharmonicity effects @xcite .",
    "the cars - qc proposal @xcite is a promising new implementation of quantum logic , with potential near - term implications for quantum communication .",
    "our main purpose in this work was to test the feasibility of this proposal by studying in detail the implementation of a benchmark quantum algorithm .",
    "we chose the deutsch - jozsa ( dj ) problem for its conceptual and technical simplicity , and devised a modified algorithm that only requires quantum interference , not entanglement .",
    "this allowed us to directly test aspects related to the preparation of input vibrational superposition states and their dynamical evolution . to maintain fidelity ,",
    "it is necessary to devise pulses that compensate for non - uniform franck - condon factors and counteract anharmonicity effects .",
    "these can be achieved through amplitude masking and frequency chirping using spatial light modulators @xcite , to optimally tailor the fields for a given choice of delay between pulses .",
    "here , we have indicated that intuitively obvious pulses already allow a clear demonstration of how computational algorithms may be implemented in tfrcars . the strategy in the laboratory demonstration of this , and similar algorithms involving rotation - vibration - electronic qubits , will be to rely on genetic algorithms to design pulses optimized for particular tasks @xcite .",
